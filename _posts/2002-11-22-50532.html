<div id="ygrps-yiv-57723177">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I could use some input.  I have 5 kids, ages 12 to 3, and this post is in<br/>
reference to the older two.  We are radical unschoolers and the kids are in<br/>
complete control of what they do or don&#39;t do and have been for several<br/>
years.  Here is the problem:  I end up having to nag.  Example:  Adriane and<br/>
Zach signed up for a dog training project with 4-H.  Once a week they meet<br/>
with a professional trainer and then have daily practice with their dogs.<br/>
We discussed all of what was required with the project before they signed up<br/>
and the kids were sure it wouldn&#39;t be a problem, in fact it was their idea,<br/>
etc..  Well, a few weeks into the project and the kids forget to train their<br/>
animals.  I gently ask if the dogs have been trained and I get &quot;Oh yeah, in<br/>
a minute, I want to watch this&quot; or whatever.  Well, the minute comes and<br/>
goes and the dog doesn&#39;t get trained, the day comes and goes and the dog<br/>
doesn&#39;t get trained, then when they meet with the trainer, the entire class<br/>
is slowed down because my kids didn&#39;t do what they agreed they would do.<br/>
<br/>
This is an ongoing thing with almost all of their projects or activities.<br/>
Last night, the kids wanted to bring the dogs inside.  I said fine but<br/>
please don&#39;t fall asleep with the dogs in the house, make sure you put the<br/>
dogs out before you go to bed.  I then go to bed and an hour or so later<br/>
wake up...Adriane has gone to bed and Zach is asleep in the chair and both<br/>
dogs are roaming the house. (We have a very old (18 years) cat that the dogs<br/>
like to harass).  I bounced the kids up and had them do what they said they<br/>
would do in the first place but I didn&#39;t like how that felt.  Often I pick<br/>
up the slack but then I feel put upon because the kids said they would take<br/>
care of it and they didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Zach will use his father&#39;s tools and just leave them laying around all over<br/>
the place.  He is well aware that he is welcome and encouraged to use<br/>
anything he wants if he will just put it back when he is done.  He doesn&#39;t.<br/>
I remind him and I get put off.  It usually then doesn&#39;t get picked up at<br/>
all unless I remind him again (nag).  Yuck.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I am still having to control, having to make them do things or<br/>
having to tell them &quot;no, because remember last time.....&quot;  I have fallen<br/>
into this role and I don&#39;t like it.  I do resent the fact that the kids<br/>
choose to do these things and then I&#39;m the one left holding the bag.<br/>
<br/>
We talk about this stuff at length.  &quot;Why do you think you are having a<br/>
problem remembering....&quot;, &quot;What do you think would help....&quot;, &quot;What if we<br/>
tried.....&quot;      The kids see my point and it is better for a day or two and<br/>
then we are right back to Mom being everybody&#39;s nag about stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Help me get a better grip on this.  Or perhaps I simply have too high of<br/>
expectations of the kids and nagging is simply part of the territory.  But<br/>
then if I am having to &quot;make&quot; them train the dog or whatever....what is the<br/>
big difference between that and making them clean their room or nagging them<br/>
about what they eat?<br/>

<br/>
I ask Holly sometimes if she had practiced her fiddle. She usually remembers <br/>
on her own.  If she doesn&#39;t, I don&#39;t press.   I might say &quot;Is it going to be <br/>
okay with you if you go and haven&#39;t practiced?&quot;  And she&#39;ll be honest and say <br/>
yes or no.  It&#39;s not the same answer every week.<br/>
<br/>
I have to remind Kirby to wash his karate gi sometimes.  I used to just do it <br/>
all the time.  Gradually it&#39;s become his job.   I used to wake him up for <br/>
work but it&#39;s been a long time since he didn&#39;t get up on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is pretty organized.  Sometimes I &quot;checklist him,&quot; like if he&#39;s having <br/>
friends over and it&#39;s nearly time I might ask if he&#39;s thought about snacks, <br/>
if there are enough places for people to sit, if they have drinks, if he has <br/>
something for Renee (vegetarian).  Usually his answers are yes, but he seems <br/>
to like to go over it with me.<br/>
<br/>
If they forget to feed the animals, I just do it.  (I&#39;m able to feed the cats <br/>
now, but not the dog yet, but that&#39;s temporary.)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes if I&#39;ve done something they were supposed to do, I&#39;ll ask them to <br/>
do something for me, and &quot;give them the bill,&quot; like...  &quot;Kirby, I washed and <br/>
dried your gi; can you bring in some firewood?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remind my  husband of things, too, and he reminds me. I think it&#39;s just <br/>
part of being a team.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate to nag, too.  I don&#39;t do it, though.  I ask a couple of times, and <br/>
then, depending on the age of the child, I will either take them by the hand <br/>
and lead them to the chore and give them the physical support to do it, or, <br/>
in the case of the teenagers, stand in their way until they go and do it.  <br/>
(Am I the only one whose teens are always on their way out the door!?)  <br/>
Sometimes I only have to suggest the first step to the task and that gets <br/>
them going.  I also follow them and while they&#39;re doing it and make sure they <br/>
take the right steps to make it right (no shortcuts!).  By this time, I feel <br/>
I&#39;m entitled to see it followed through. They hate that, naturally.  It&#39;s a <br/>
disincentive to leave their messes lying around.  I don&#39;t have to do it very <br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer:  I wouldn&#39;t do this with dog training or something like <br/>
that...only chores that they said they would do or it is right for them to <br/>
do--like put away my stuff that they&#39;ve used.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this only occurs after they&#39;ve given their word they were going to do it <br/>
and much other conversation and time and gentle reminders have intervened.  <br/>
It&#39;s more of an issue with the teenagers, because if they don&#39;t do something <br/>
like clean up a mess, then they leave the house for hours or days and I have <br/>
to do it if I need the house cleaned up for something.  It&#39;s not fair for me <br/>
to have to clean up after the whole family just because they have busy <br/>
schedules, right?<br/>
<br/>
Instead of nagging, I use my physical closeness to get their attention, is <br/>
basically what I&#39;m saying.  <br/>
<br/>
With regard to the dog training, there&#39;s a great chapter about readiness in <br/>
the book &quot;Living Joyfully with Children&quot; (Win & Bill Sweet) about that.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s different with the kids, at least a lot of kids.  When they<br/>
aren&#39;t doing what they&#39;ve agreed to do or whatever, I&#39;m thinking that they<br/>
don&#39;t consider themselves part of the team.  That&#39;s the way it often feels<br/>
with Lars.  He hardly helps at all since I stopped making him do chores, and<br/>
it&#39;s been months now.  Maybe that&#39;s part of de-choring.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
So then the question becomes, what do we do so that they *will* feel a part<br/>
of the team?  I&#39;ve been making more of a point of doing little things for<br/>
him lately, and that seems to have changed the feel some, but he still<br/>
forgets what he&#39;s agreed to far more often than he remembers.  Maybe it&#39;s<br/>
the testosterone?<br/>

If they used to be made to do things, and some things weren&#39;t their job, it <br/>
will take a while, just in general.  And I don&#39;t think any mom should expect <br/>
any child to do an adult&#39;s share of housework.  There are rare cases in which <br/>
a child&#39;s interest runs to interior decorating or something, or someone&#39;s <br/>
anal about germs and decides to use a can of cleanser each week just to save <br/>
the universe.  Generally, kids have better things to do than clean sinks.  <br/>
And if moms do too?  Don&#39;t clean the sinks so much.<br/>

thinking.  We don&#39;t insist on it being my way or the highway.  We do insist <br/>
on a little thinking towards at least being sanitary in their rooms and the <br/>
bathrooms, picking up after yourself, etc.  Pitching in when necessary just <br/>
because they like peace and love me.  <br/>
<br/>
I know my children&#39;s homes will be as well kept (relative term!) as mine is <br/>
eventually.  They&#39;ll grow up and feel differently about chores; it will be <br/>
for their own reasons, which I can&#39;t possibly inculcate into them directly.  <br/>
(I believe they already have the reasons in &#39;em, just waiting to develop, <br/>
like permanent teeth.)  My room was always a mess and I didn&#39;t do everything <br/>
my mother told me to do.  Mostly, we did it right as she was pulling in the <br/>
driveway!  <br/>

complain about their husbands in this way, I just want to go and shake the <br/>
husbands!   I had this very scenario yesterday.  <br/>
<br/>
Those marriages are in trouble, I think.  The one carrying the load only had <br/>
two options, IMO.  She can leave, or she can adapt her thinking that this is <br/>
what it is, and adjust her idea of what she can reasonably get accomplished <br/>
in her life with the dead weight she&#39;s dragging around.  Nagging doesn&#39;t <br/>
help, and usually she&#39;s already tried it.  I suppose the dead weight could <br/>
have a change of heart, but what do you do until then?<br/>

My housekeeping is about as far from anal is it could get.  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m really<br/>
thinking more about the little stuff that keeps the house from looking like<br/>
a complete disaster.  And someone mentioned tools.  That&#39;s a big one for me<br/>
too.  Even just the household stuff like tape and scissors, etc.  It&#39;s so<br/>
annoying to spend ages looking for the tool to do some little job that might<br/>
take 2 seconds to do once you find the tool.  (I&#39;ve taken to building a<br/>
collection of such tools in our bedroom that are off-limits to the one who<br/>
doesn&#39;t put tools away.)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Those marriages are in trouble, I think.  The one carrying the load only <br/>
had <br/>
two options, IMO.  She can leave, or she can adapt her thinking that this is <br/>
what it is, and adjust her idea of what she can reasonably get accomplished <br/>
in her life with the dead weight she&#39;s dragging around.  Nagging doesn&#39;t <br/>
help, and usually she&#39;s already tried it.  I suppose the dead weight could <br/>
have a change of heart, but what do you do until then? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
More than two options.<br/>

Go on vacation for a while so he appreciates things like socks in the drawer <br/>
and dishes back in the cabinet and kids being driven around.  (I don&#39;t <br/>
recommend breaking a leg, but that&#39;s having an effect here.  Keith didn&#39;t <br/>
know where to plug the vacuum cleaner in to do the stairs.  Kirby didn&#39;t know <br/>
where the biggest cooking pot was kept.)<br/>

Counselling.  If the husband won&#39;t go to couples counselling, the wife can go <br/>
without him.  <br/>

the place.  He is well aware that he is welcome and encouraged to use<br/>
anything he wants if he will just put it back when he is done.  He doesn&#39;t.<br/>
I remind him and I get put off.  It usually then doesn&#39;t get picked up at<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How important are your husband&#39;s tools to him? I know my dh is pretty anal about his tools...partly because some are expensive and partly because...well its just the way he is. Plus when you&#39;ve got a job to do and you can&#39;t find the one tool you need...ugh. Maybe dh could deal with the tool issue, since they belong to him. For that matter, except for the really expensive ones, how about helping Zach get tools of his own?<br/>
