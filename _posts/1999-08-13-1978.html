<div id="ygrps-yiv-537194272">Hi!  I&#39;ve been lurking for several weeks now.  Receiving all these messages <br/>
is new to me, and a bit difficult to keep up with.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe I saw info here (or on another homeschooling list?) about a way to <br/>
exchange postcards with other home/un schoolers across the world.  It sounded <br/>
like a great way to learn a bit of geography, etc.  Does anyone have the <br/>
info?  I can&#39;t get organized enough to try to sort through all of my old <br/>
email.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your help!  My 8 yr old son has decided he really wants to send <br/>
the postcards!<br/>

volume across all of them combined, i&#39;m really starting to get myself <br/>
confused.  but they all have such great posts!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  i saw something like this on onelist but i think it was just for <br/>
the states in the U.S. not the world.  it popped up when i did a <br/>
keyword search on the main onelist site for &quot;montana&quot; cuz it was one <br/>
of the states listed in the exchange.  i remembered the list because <br/>
i thought it was such a neat idea for a geography project for a <br/>
homeschooler.  not sure if this is what you <br/>
were looking for but you might try a keyword search for &quot;post card&quot;.  <br/>
might turn up all sorts of interesting lists!<br/>
