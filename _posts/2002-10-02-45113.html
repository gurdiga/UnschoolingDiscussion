&lt;&lt; Esther is like this: she won&#39;t talk under certain conditions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sierra is like this too.<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t want to talk to someone, she won&#39;t look at them and just acts <br/>
like they don&#39;t exist. It drives some people batty.<br/>
But she is slowly getting more open and talkative. Even ordered her own food <br/>
at the restaurant last week, a first! Usually the waiters get ignored.<br/>

I find as time goes by she is getting over this...which is why I threw the article down in disgust...if the child overcomes it naturally let them...just be open and try and gently give them opportunities to talk to others...<br/>
<br/>
Usually it is adults she doesn&#39;t want to respond to...  <br/>
<br/>
And it is adults who get the most upset.  What ails people anyway that a kid has to talk to them?   That I don&#39;t understand at all.<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
