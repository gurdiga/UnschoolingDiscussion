<div id="ygrps-yiv-143228061">Group, <br/>
Luz and I will be on a panel for aHSing information night in a few days. The<br/>
organizer sent out some questions that she thought should be answered during<br/>
the discussion. Maybe these will interest some of our egroup members. If you<br/>
don&#39;t live in CT, you might want to begin at #4.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Questions for Homeschooling Information Session<br/>
<br/>
                   <br/>
1. What is the law in Connecticut on homeschooling?<br/>
A. There is no law in CT about homeschooling (and that is a good thing). Any<br/>
answer to this question needs to say that the law that covers homeschooling<br/>
is the one that covers all other forms of education. It was written in 1650<br/>
and is still in effect. It says, simply that parents (or guardians) are<br/>
responsible for the education of their children, whether or not they send<br/>
them to school. <br/>
The answer would usually continue to address the &quot;guidelines&quot; for<br/>
homeschooling that were established in 1990, and it must be noted that<br/>
guidelines are not laws, and that the guidelines are not in any way to be<br/>
construed as requirements by homeschoolers, but only suggestions. If parents<br/>
wish to use them or follow them, they can do so voluntarily. Some parents<br/>
do, some don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
2. Does the school provide materials?<br/>
A.  No, and if you homeschool, you probably won&#39;t want to have &quot;public<br/>
schooling&quot; at home, would you?<br/>
<br/>
3. Is testing required?<br/>
A. No, not in CT. None at all. There are no requirements at all, other than<br/>
the state law that says your child must instructed in the basic skills, plus<br/>
how government works, but it doesn&#39;t say how, or how much, or when.<br/>
<br/>
4. My child is currently in school and receiving special education services.<br/>
If we homeschool, will the school discontinue them?<br/>
A.  Yes. Unless your child is physically handicapped, the chances are<br/>
extremely high that s/he does not belong in &quot;special&quot; education. If s/he has<br/>
schooling problems, they were almost certainly caused by the school, and<br/>
will not ever be solved there, but only made worse. Getting away from<br/>
Special Ed is one of the best reasons to homeschool your child.<br/>
<br/>
5. My child is an introvert, and generally isn&#39;t very social.  Although he<br/>
wants to homeschool, I am reluctant because I think he needs school for<br/>
socialization.  I am concerned he would be alone too much as a homeschooler<br/>
with just his brother and me for company.  I am anxious for your thoughts on<br/>
this.<br/>
A.  &quot;Socialization&quot; is a selling point for public schools, but is that what<br/>
they offer? Sitting with same age, same ability children all day in rows of<br/>
desks in bleak buildings (even &quot;decorated&quot; ones) and being told to sit still<br/>
and keep quiet and that what you think or questions you have are not<br/>
important, is not socialization. Being outside of that place, being with<br/>
people of all ages doing all sorts of real life activities in a variety of<br/>
settings is socialization -- learning how people behave in actual life<br/>
situations. (What&#39;s wrong with not being &quot;social&quot;? -- lots of kids are not<br/>
social. Usually, a child does just fine with one friend to get together with<br/>
when they can. They don&#39;t need to be in a crowd of peers all the time, or<br/>
even at all.)<br/>
<br/>
6. I was not particularly good in math or science when I was in high school.<br/>
 How will I be able to teach subjects such as algebra or physics to my<br/>
child? <br/>
A. It&#39;s not your job. (How much algebra and physics have you used since<br/>
school? Hmmm?) As a homeschooling parent, you are responsible only for what<br/>
you can do, and for other things, you find others who can help. First,<br/>
understand that in schools, not every child is taught every subject. Many<br/>
fail; many teachers are terrible and do not teach well, and so the children<br/>
are neglected and denied much of what parents expect them to be given. The<br/>
academic level of MOST schools in America (including the so-called good<br/>
ones) is POOR. That is the best reason to homeschool for most parents. With<br/>
homeschooling, parents can at least have control over what is taught and<br/>
how, and (don&#39;t forget) they also control what is NOT taught that they don&#39;t<br/>
want to be taught.<br/>
 <br/>
8. How do you teach several children who are all at different grade levels?<br/>
(Unit studies? Prepared curriculum?)<br/>
A. Our son&#39;s favorite expression regarding his own education was this (from<br/>
Winston Churchill) : &quot;I love to learn, but I hate being taught.&quot;  Most<br/>
parents, after they have been homeschooling a while, realize that most<br/>
learning does not require teaching. Another fact is that school subjects do<br/>
not relate to children&#39;s interests. Learning happens when the learner is<br/>
curious and interested in something; it does not happen when s/he is not<br/>
engaged. Thus, education is up to the learner, not the &quot;schooler.&quot;  Unit<br/>
studies and prepared curriculum are tools for the control of masses by<br/>
uncreative school employees. Use real books about real subjects by real<br/>
authors. In other words, get your information from libraries, not curriculum<br/>
salespeople or schools.<br/>
<br/>
9. What is unschooling?<br/>
A. First, Homeschooling does not necessarily mean Schooling at Home. If you<br/>
choose homeschooling, you probably don&#39;t want to turn your home into the<br/>
thing you&#39;re getting away from.<br/>
As for Unschooling: go to www.borntoexplore.org/unschool -- it&#39;s where Luz<br/>
and I explain it in some depth.<br/>
In general, it is anything that doesn&#39;t look or feel like school. It is<br/>
Growing Without Schooling, sometimes referred to as learner-directed living,<br/>
or self-education, or child-led learning. The key is trusting the child to<br/>
follow his/her curiosity wherever it leads. For parents, it can mean<br/>
learning from (or with) your child. Unschooling means allowing your child to<br/>
be responsible for his/her own learning instead of doing what someone else<br/>
tells him/her for all those years. It means &quot;start your own life NOW&quot;<br/>
instead of waiting for someone to tell you when it should start -- usually<br/>
when they&#39;re finished with you. This idea worked well for our son. He was<br/>
always glad that he was in charge of his own learning.<br/>
<br/>
10. What are some other teaching methods? (Classical, Charlotte Mason,<br/>
Montessori, Waldorf, Eclectic)<br/>
A.  I have no answer here. I&#39;m an unschooling advocate. Our son quit<br/>
Montessori at age four after ten sessions. After that, he took charge of his<br/>
own life and learning.<br/>
 <br/>
11. How do I choose a teaching method?  What are the advantages and<br/>
disadvantages of each?<br/>
A. Same. Every time we tell our child to think about a certain thing, we<br/>
deny them a chance to investigate something that interests them.<br/>
<br/>
12. I have such a hard time getting my kids to do homework now, when they<br/>
are in school, that I canÂ’t imagine getting them to do their schoolwork if I<br/>
homeschool them.  How do you motivate your kids to do their work?<br/>
A. Homework: No. NO!  Homework is the school system&#39;s way of controlling<br/>
parents along with their children, making everyone&#39;s life totally<br/>
preoccupied with SCHOOL instead of real life. In addition, being a parent is<br/>
demanding enough. Giving care, comfort, nurturing, etc, is plenty and it is<br/>
what children need and is satisfying for parents. But when you turn yourself<br/>
into your child&#39;s taskmaster by requiring him/her to do schoolwork -- and<br/>
homework on top of that -- you create a huge risk of ruining your<br/>
relationship with your child. That&#39;s another good reason to UNschool. Be a<br/>
parent, be your child&#39;s protector, role model, comforter. Do not be his/her<br/>
boss or critic or judge. Be the person they ask questions of, not the person<br/>
asking them questions, or deciding what they should think about. Trust them.<br/>
Give them space. They&#39;ll love you for it...always.<br/>
<br/>
13. How do you choose which homeschool resources, books, and curricula to<br/>
use, and where do you get them?<br/>
A. It doesn&#39;t matter.  (But if you must, go to a homeschool fair and buy<br/>
used books from other homeschoolers -- it supports the organization, too)<br/>
Curricula are all bad and limiting. Let your child decide what is<br/>
interesting in the world, and go to the library or the local museum or<br/>
someplace else in order to find out what s/he wants to know about that<br/>
subject. HINT: It will never be algebra or french or social studies or etc,<br/>
etc. It will be airplanes, or dinosaurs or money or the sky or etc, etc.<br/>
Learn with him/her about his/her interests.<br/>
 <br/>
14. How do homeschoolers get a high school diploma?<br/>
A. Homeschoolers don&#39;t get high school diplomas. That&#39;s another good thing,<br/>
because almost nobody cares about them. What some hsers do is take the GED<br/>
(State General Equivalency Test) and get a diploma from the state. The test<br/>
is not hard -- it&#39;s designed at the eighth grade level.<br/>
 <br/>
15. How do homeschoolers get into college?<br/>
A. College takes some planning. There are counselors who can help, but you<br/>
can research it with your kid. More and more homeschoolers are entering<br/>
college earlier than kids who go to school. Kids who have been in control of<br/>
their education for a long time are especially well equipped and prepared<br/>
for college life, and do well. Colleges also are now aware that<br/>
homeschoolers are making a great impression with colleges, and are actually<br/>
in demand, especially at good independent colleges.<br/>
 <br/>
16. My husband is against homeschooling but I think it would be best for our<br/>
two children.  How do I convince him to let me try it?<br/>
A.  I can&#39;t know your husband, but he sounds like me -- I just didn&#39;t get it<br/>
at first. Be patient as long as you can, then have him call me and Luz to<br/>
get a copy of our homeschooling packet of information. Email for it at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:nedvare@...">nedvare@...</a> if you&#39;re in a rush.<br/>
Meanwhile, ask him what he wants the children to learn, and then make it his<br/>
job to teach it to them. It shouldn&#39;t take him long to realize that there<br/>
really isn&#39;t much that schools teach, and there&#39;s so much more to learn<br/>
OUTSIDE school!<br/>
<br/>
17. Although I want to homeschool, I am concerned that I will never have any<br/>
time to myself.  How do other homeschoolers deal with that?<br/>
A. Who is telling you that you have to spend all your time schooling. We<br/>
raised our kid without ANY schooling -- we lived our lives and he joined in<br/>
or didn&#39;t, as he wanted. In fact, time spent schooling is bad for everyone;<br/>
time spent doing other stuff is good for everyone. Schooling is a stupid<br/>
activity. Ask any kid. Schooling is the slowest possible way to learn. Don&#39;t<br/>
waste everyone&#39;s time with it.<br/>
<br/>
18. What made each of you decide to homeschool?<br/>
A. Once we realized what an unhappy and unproductive experience school was<br/>
(even accounting for the good moment with friends and a few satisfactions)<br/>
we saw schooling as mere babysitting by strangers and warehousing of<br/>
children by not well educated adults who couldn&#39;t get other indoor work. On<br/>
the plus side, homeschooling allows parents to truly raise their own<br/>
children, to get to know them well and not let the state take them<br/>
emotionally away from them. Did you have children so that you could give<br/>
them to the government to raise for you, badly?<br/>
<br/>
19. What, in your opinion, have been the greatest benefits of homeschooling<br/>
for you/your family?<br/>
A. Benefits: Mutual respect; happiness; trust; a lasting good understanding<br/>
between parents and child. As for academics, schools can&#39;t touch<br/>
homeschooling by conscientious parents. Public schools do not educate; they<br/>
merely indoctrinate children.<br/>
The public school system is based on deceit, force and coercion, not love or<br/>
trust.<br/>
Homeschooling: No institutional education system can compare to it.<br/>
