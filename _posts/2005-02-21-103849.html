<div id="ygrps-yiv-1703112875">I made a reference to &quot;manus&quot; in another post and intended to clarify.  Sorry.  Here that is.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Manipulate,&quot; if you dissect it and lay out its parts, means to move things by hand.  So when someone says someone was manipulated, it means they were treated marionette-like, and their movements were created by another person.<br/>
<br/>
Persuasion, on the other hand, is done by trying to change another&#39;s thoughts or viewpoint or emotion, by using soothing messages in words.  It&#39;s a much older word.   <br/>

Entries from the Online Etymology Dictionary are below.  These are histories of the words--not quite the same as current definitions, but I think they&#39;re more interesting myself.<br/>

<br/>
Since we can&#39;t know what the child is feeling we have to become aware of who<br/>
they are, what they want and the power differences between us.<br/>
<br/>
*But* out of the context of a problem it&#39;s hard to discuss in a meaningful<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a personal situation you&#39;d like to discuss? It&#39;s easier to<br/>
discuss principles when jumping off from a real situation. If we were<br/>
discussing a real situation, we could ask &quot;What does the child want?&quot; And<br/>
offer suggestions that are respectful of the child.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Where is the line drawn?  (Because of the inherent power difference<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
manipulating? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different every time in each dyad.  Some parents manipulate all the <br/>
time.  It is neither ideal nor illegal.   Some parents never manipulate nor even <br/>
learn to persuade, to the point that they are what is called &quot;walked on&quot; and <br/>
marginalized by even their own family.<br/>
<br/>
In the middle is a balance point and that will be different in different <br/>
circumstances.   <br/>
<br/>
If I see one of my boys getting emotionally involved with a girl who seems <br/>
desperately needy to have a baby to get away from her family, that would call <br/>
for more commentary and discouragement than if he&#39;s liking a girl who seems calm <br/>
and thoughtful and balanced.   To declare in advance a rule about how I will <br/>
be in future unseen circumstances would be to turn off my own freedom and <br/>
judgment.  <br/>
<br/>
Living by principles and not by rules, as I try to do, having a rule about <br/>
what is and what isn&#39;t violates my principles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-382640881">Sandra, I just want to thank you for your honesty and the way you explain things. I pray everyday to find that balance, not to manipulate, but to know when I need to speak more on something and when I need to not interject my own opinions. It is a day to day, moment to moment call, but one that I believe is worth finding. I don&#39;t ever want to return to that person that used manipulation to get my kids to do something. There are days that I feel myself starting to slip, but this list always help me get my perspective straight. Thanks again to you and all the moderators for your commitment to unschooling.</div>

<br/>
===============<br/>
 <br/>
There are some slogans some people find helpful in decision-making moments,  <br/>
and one is &quot;How important is it?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
My current problem (a small one) is my urge to suggest that Kirby not eat  so <br/>
much breakfast cereal.  I could easily put a spotlight on that by  mentioning <br/>
it, though, and we&#39;ve gone a long time without pressuring them about  food.  <br/>
He&#39;s just on a cereal binge, partly because we went a few weeks  without much <br/>
whole milk (which he loves), and I got some Reese&#39;s Puffs, which is  his <br/>
favorite.  So I guess it will pass by, but I&#39;ve had to breathe and NOT  say a word, <br/>
and I&#39;m glad.  My guilt or &quot;advice&quot; would just be  irritating.  He won&#39;t eat <br/>
cereal exclusively forever (and isn&#39;t eating it  exclusively now).<br/>
 <br/>
-=- There are days that I feel myself starting to slip, but this list  always <br/>

 <br/>
Me too.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
