<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123777413">Thank-you to everyone who has responded so far!<br/>
<br/>
  aj, I am excited to share with ds the ideas you have mentioned - we have<br/>
talked about games/videos, and he was excited by that so now I have a place<br/>
to start.  Online is free!  I think he&#39;ll like helping me to label household<br/>
items too - we&#39;ll see once he wakes!  (sleeping in is one of his favourite<br/>
parts of homeschooling!  Really realized this once hockey started this<br/>
year....lol!)<br/>
<br/>
  I have tried the suggestion of informing him that others are not reading<br/>
now, which I know to be true wholeheartedly, but he seems to internally want<br/>
to read, and my &quot;telling him&quot; that it&#39;s okay doesn&#39;t seem to help much.  The<br/>
magic books I&#39;ve found do have lots of pictures - but it&#39;s not quite enough!<br/>
I think I will look for a video though - that&#39;s a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
  So, any other suggestions out there would be great!<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
But his desire doesn&#39;t equal ability, either.<br/>
Lots of kids want to read years before it comes to them.<br/>
Some babies want to ride a bike.<br/>
Some children want to play football with the big boys.<br/>
 <br/>
All of those things take time to mature, and desire doesn&#39;t do it.<br/>
 <br/>
Keep him busy and distracted and buy him magazines with lots of pictures,  so <br/>
that even reading one word of a caption would be helpful, but not  necessary. <br/>
 Find DVDs of movies he knows well and leave the subtitles on  (if he wants) <br/>
but don&#39;t make a deal out of it.  I watch with subtitles lots  of times so <br/>
that if someone talks to me I can still keep up with the movie (that  hyperactive <br/>
multi-tasking ability helps sometimes).  I never turned them on  for kids&#39; <br/>
benefit, but for mine.  And with foreign accents or mumbling  actors, subtitles <br/>
are great!!  <br/>
 <br/>
(Frustratingly for me, there were no English subtitles on &quot;Flawless&quot; in  <br/>
which Robert deNiro, playing a stroke victim, talks without moving one side of  <br/>
his mouth.)<br/>
 <br/>
Sing-along videos--we had lots of them.  Disney, Animaniacs.  But  with DVDs <br/>
and subtitles all KINDS of things become &quot;sing along videos.&quot;   Any musical or <br/>
kid-concert video can be a singalong.<br/>
