<div id="ygrps-yiv-518049751">I am a strong supporter of schools ceasing to exist and I&#39;ve signed <br/>
the proclamation at www.sepschool.org.  I *might* support them if <br/>
they became optional resource centers, like really big libraries with <br/>
staff persons available when needed.  In other words, if all public <br/>
schools became sudbury schools.  And if they became optional, without <br/>
fines and threats of jail for the parents and threats of kids being <br/>
taken from homes if the family is found guilty of &quot;truancy&quot;.  There <br/>
should be no such thing as truancy because if and how often the child <br/>
goes to school should be up to the child.  <br/>
<br/>
Even then I might not be totally in support of them, because if my <br/>
kids chose not to go to them, I would have to pay for their existence <br/>
(through taxes) and then also pay for my own children&#39;s unschooling, <br/>
which can be very straining financially.  <br/>
