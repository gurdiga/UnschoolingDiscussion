<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689172492">We bought some for fun when my kids were young. We live in a nice area, near a huge park. One night, I went to check on one of the kids that was in room, and discovered that there were strangers on the walkee talkee calling randomly to many of the channels looking for someone to reply. When use use scan it picks up all the conversations. I had to teach my kids about safety issues when using them the next day. The thought they could have been loured away using the radio was terrible! We do use them all the time for all kinds of situations, but young kids can be tricked.<br/>
