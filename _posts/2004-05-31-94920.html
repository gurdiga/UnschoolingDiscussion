So for those of you that are actually worried about this issue (and I&#39;m not saying there won&#39;t be an energy crisis), please research fuel cells and hydrogen technology.<br/>
<br/>
The automobile industry already agrees that hydrogen is the future and they are working hard to create cars that are affordable and make hydrogen readily available...we will see them on the market in the next 10 years.<br/>
There are skyscrapers in big cities being totally run on fuel cell techonology, totally off the grid. The new technologies are here....it&#39;s going to be commonplace in our lifetimes.<br/>

I saw in the Timberdoodle catalog a fuel cell car kit.  Kinda pricy, but it <br/>
looks like a really cool investment if you can afford it.<br/>

Unfortunately, it&#39;s a bit more complicated than it seems at the <br/>
surface. While hydrogen can be extracted from water using solar or <br/>
wind-powered electricity, current plans for the hydrogen <br/>
infrastructure call for most of the hydrogen to be produced from oil, <br/>
natural gas, and other non-renewable resources.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;According to the administration&#39;s National Hydrogen Energy Roadmap, <br/>
drafted last year in concert with the energy industry, up to 90 <br/>
percent of all hydrogen will be refined from oil, natural gas, and <br/>
other fossil fuels -- in a process using energy generated by burning <br/>
oil, coal, and natural gas. The remaining 10 percent will be cracked <br/>
from water using nuclear energy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This quote is from the article &quot;Hydrogen&#39;s Dirty Secret&quot; at <br/>

I certainly hope that hydrogen will become a totally clean and <br/>
renewable fuel supply at some point, but in the immediate future, <br/>
it&#39;s not looking like that is going to be the case. I&#39;m going to <br/>
stick with biodiesel for now, something that can be made from almost <br/>
anything grown in the ground that makes oil (some folks have talked <br/>
about making it from kudzu, now wouldn&#39;t that be a bonus!!) <br/>
Additionally, biodiesel can be pumped from existing fuel station <br/>
infrastructure, instead of the expensive hydrogen stations that will <br/>
need to be built. <br/>
<br/>
And, from an unschooling perspective, biodiesel is way cool because <br/>
you can make it yourself. I&#39;m a big fan of anything that we, as a <br/>
family, can do for ourselves, rather than relying on a big <br/>
beauracracy to accomplish for us. Families running on biodiesel might <br/>
never even have to go to a gas station. I&#39;m fairly sure this is why <br/>
hydrogen is getting a lot of press and talk time from the government, <br/>
because it can be controlled by big business. No one in the corporate <br/>
world wants to think about a fuel that people could make themselves - <br/>
where&#39;s the profit in that? Kind of like unschooling, in a way. If <br/>
the emperor isn&#39;t wearing any clothes (if we don&#39;t need schools, or <br/>
fuel pumps), those who stand to make money from the emperor&#39;s parade <br/>
start getting scared. To me, hydrogen cells aren&#39;t all that different <br/>
from charter &quot;home&quot;schools, just the same beauracracy trying to sell <br/>
us something different that we don&#39;t really need.<br/>
