This is not really appropriate, but I let it through because it was so  <br/>
cheery and such a great picture of a special week for an unschooling  <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
And what a cool idea, to ask for help from other unschoolers for  <br/>
things that would be good for such a family, in that place.<br/>
<br/>
So go for it!  If anyone has suggestions and we can help a family do  <br/>
something cool, we all get to share in it just a little bit. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647965044">We really loved the Karls kirche at Karls Platz.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles%27s_Church,_Vienna.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Charles%27s_Church,_Vienna.</a> It&#39;s been three<br/>
years and I don&#39;t know if this is still possible: There was an elevator we<br/>
could take up close to the ceiling of the church to see newly restored<br/>
almost 300 year old murals. Just a few yards from the old fresco, we got a<br/>
good view and beautiful pictures! If you have young children, there&#39;s a<br/>
small park right next to the church.<br/>
<br/>
We also enjoyed the museum of Natural History.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturhistorisches_Museum.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturhistorisches_Museum.</a> It&#39;s huge and may be<br/>
overwhelming for small children, our boys were most interested in the<br/>
pharaohs and dinosaurs!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962982937">My husband was scheduled to be in Vienna for a business trip a couple of years ago. I thought about going but it was in the winter and I decided not to go and save the money for a different trip. Turns out we will now be visiting New Zealand in September which is being referred to as winter by all the people in New Zealand I&#39;ve spoken to. I like to call it early spring. It sounds so much better.......  Anyway, I researched Vienna a little and I was thinking about taking the kids to see the Lippizzaner Horses     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lipizzaner.com/home.asp">http://www.lipizzaner.com/home.asp</a>    I don&#39;t remember the cost. There is a practice or warm up that can be attended, but I read that can be disappointing in that they don&#39;t do the jumps/dance. I don&#39;t know if they have a museum with video.<br/>
25 years ago I was in Salzburg and went on a salt mine tour. If you aren&#39;t already going to Salzburg, you might consider a day trip by train. I think my kids would love this, but we don&#39;t ever travel by train in the States so it&#39;s a different and fun thing to do. I remember the salt mine being fun. We rode on a small train into the mine and I remember going down long wooden slides once inside. We also dressed like miners.  www.SalzburgTours.net   I&#39;m not sure now if this is the mine I went in, but it would give you a general idea of what it is. I think there could be a silver mine closer to Vienna.<br/>
I have horticulturist as parents so I always look for gardens and botanical centers when traveling. They usually have wide open spaces for kids to run. I think Vienna might have a castle or two with  beautiful gardens.<br/>
Being a cello player, I had also thought about looking into classical music performances and opera. I would have needed a park performance that was kid friendly but decided not to go before searching very long for that type of thing. I think it would be great fun to see an opera that was done with kids in mind.<br/>
