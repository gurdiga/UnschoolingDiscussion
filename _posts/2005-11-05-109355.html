<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995698455">&lt;I was hoping that you and others might share some suggested <br/>
unschooling<br/>
&quot;comebacks&quot; that teens might keep handy to use when they run up against<br/>
skeptical friends and relatives. Many members of our extended family <br/>
are<br/>
in education careers, elementary through college level, and we&#39;re<br/>
coming up<br/>
on relative season.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any off the top of my head, I just know that I have <br/>
listened with a big grin on my face, on several occasions.  I will <br/>
start taking note and maybe ask Kevin some of the things that he has <br/>
told his friends.<br/>
<br/>
I know one thing that I often come back at people with is &quot;How much, <br/>
of what you learned in school, do you actually remember?&quot;  99% of the <br/>
people I ask that too go &quot;Uuuuhhhhh, not much.&quot;  Thank you, point <br/>
made!  The other day I got in a very heated discussion with a group of <br/>
pro-public school people.  After the discussion had died down the <br/>
group was discussing the school schedule and the reason that school is <br/>
starting earlier here is so the testing can be done before Christmas, <br/>
otherwise the kids forget what they learned during the holidays.  I <br/>
piped up with &quot;Well, I guess that proves that they really <br/>
didn&#39;t &#39;learn&#39; it in the first place!&quot;  I got a bunch of blank stares <br/>
but I think I made my point.  <br/>
