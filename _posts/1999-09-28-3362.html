 I couldn&#39;t agree with you more! We occasionally do birthday parties (for the <br/>
neighbors and family) but it&#39;s never an extravagant to-do. We had a friend <br/>
who gave a party at the skating rink and paid for skate rental, food, etc. <br/>
for 20 kids! She must have taken out a loan! :)<br/>
 I like the idea of having kids donate mittens, hats, etc. instead of <br/>
presents. Since my sons&#39; birthdays are close to Earth day, I may try to <br/>
incorporate that into it this year...I&#39;m still thinking. Maybe some type of <br/>
volunteer project for themselves and their friends? I&#39;ll let you know what I <br/>
come up with.<br/>

     This year we are having a very small celebration.  So far we have had <br/>
one of the four kids birthdays, and we plan on following the same for each.  <br/>
First of all I bake a cake from scratch (I use a favorite recipe of the kids <br/>
and the taste beats any box cake mix or even a cake from Donut Bank) and <br/>
decorate it for the younger ones.  We use all of the money (since we don&#39;t <br/>
have to pay for a party) on the gifts that they choose (they know the amount <br/>
that we spend, so they aren&#39;t expecting something that is way out of the <br/>
price range---causing a dissapointment).  We give grandma a few gift ideas <br/>
(she also has given them an amount that she will spend).  The only other <br/>
person that comes is my best friend with her two kids.  It is a very small, <br/>
intimate gathering with all attention paid to the birthday child.  The <br/>
weekend of that childs birthday, he or she can have 2 or 3 friends over to <br/>
spend the night.  Since we have already had &quot;the party&quot;, this is just for the <br/>
companionship of friends for the birthday child.  Sometimes these friends may <br/>
opt to bring a gift, but we let them know that it is not necessary.  My kids <br/>
have really enjoyed doing things this way.  Usually the night of the <br/>
sleepover is spent playing with all the birthday gifts the child received <br/>
from the party of a few days before.  Relaxing and yet fun!<br/>
