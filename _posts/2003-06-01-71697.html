My hubby is 39 and I am 33 next month so I guess he is older.  I dont think I <br/>
would do any one shriveled up but I have had not one relationship in my life <br/>
that wasn&#39;t someone older than me. I actually my DH is the youngest.  When I <br/>
was younger I was never into the whole party scene. It was hard to see someone <br/>
and deal with that. Blaaa<br/>

I really like Sean Connery. I think he&#39;s a good actor, I like him from what<br/>
I&#39;ve seen on interviews and I think he&#39;s attractive. But he&#39;s not doable for<br/>
me. Same with John Travolta. I like most of what he does and think he comes<br/>
across as the nicest guy, with his wife, children and family and friends.<br/>
But not doable. I&#39;d like him as a neighbor though.<br/>

Urban Cowboy is one of my all time favorites no matter how cheesy, but he is <br/>
not do-able for me either. I&#39;d like him for a brother though. Then I&#39;d have <br/>

Isn&#39;t it funny how we percieve other people???  I mean really, I&#39;ve never <br/>
actually *seen* him all decked out like that but that&#39;s what I imagine.  <br/>

Sean Connery - just keeps getting sexier - in fact (well, my fact anyway LOL) is way more doable now than he ever was when he was younger (James Bond movies).

Once upon a time it was Harrison Ford (loved all the cat and mouse scenes with him and carrie fisher in starwars *sigh*), but now he&#39;s not aging too well and seems to be having a difficult time finding an &#39;older&#39; look that isn&#39;t ick.<br/>

  &gt; see him in &quot;Chocolat&quot;?  A VERY cool somewhat unschooly movie. :o)<br/>
<br/>
  He just had way too little a role in that movie!  The only one I have <br/>
  seen him in yet that I just couldn&#39;t get into him in is Blow.  He was <br/>
  okay during one of the decades, but near the end of the movie, oh how <br/>
  yuck was that!<br/>
<br/>
  My other doables are John Cusack and Nicolas Cage.  (I love actors <br/>
  who do wacked-out roles.)  <br/>

How sweet. :o) My husband was once mistaken for Jason Alexander (the <br/>
guy who played George Costanza on Seinfeld.) He was walking down the <br/>
street during the Sundance Film Festival and somebody across the <br/>
street starting yelling &quot;Hey George!&quot;<br/>

Lucky for me his personality is nothng like George&#39;s. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think Kevin Klein is a terrific actor. I couldn&#39;t EVEN believe it, <br/>

gotta agree with you, there. Keanu is pretty slurp-able. A good <br/>
friend of mine, when her marriage was breaking up, got hooked on <br/>
Keanu. At one point, when we were out on the town, sitting in the <br/>
parking lot at Blockbuster, looking at the poster for Matrix and <br/>
drooling! L<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053853725">Hi All !!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am brand new here. In fact, this is the first thread that I have read. I <br/>
usually lurk for a while after joining a new list but I have to say right away <br/>
...........WOW !!!! <br/>
<br/>
Thought I would come into some unschooling topics but sexy men works for me <br/>
too !!!!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with many of the previously mentioned group.I have to add Brad Pitt <br/>
who always looks too yummy for words. And last night I watched &quot; A Time to Kill <br/>
&quot; - Matthew McConahey (sp?) - double yummy !!!!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to be part of  such a fun group !!!!<br/>
