<div id="ygrps-yiv-626936581">I have been lurking for a few weeks and really enjoying the <br/>
conversations. ;-) Even though we are secure in our choice to <br/>
unschool and the changes we have made I felt the need to be a part of <br/>
a bigger unschooling community. This list seemed like the perfect way <br/>
to gather wisdom from other unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
I am currently trying to come to grips with some of my oldest <br/>
daughter&#39;s choices. She is a mature 16 yr old (17 in March) who holds <br/>
down a part-time job, takes a few classes at the community college <br/>
and is just a great teen who is passionate about a lot of things. She <br/>
is also convinced she is in love. This has not been a huge issue <br/>
because her boyfriend lives in Washington (we are in Texas)and they <br/>
only see each other every 5 or 6 months. Well .. . .he just turned 18 <br/>
and is planning to move here. His father has used bribes (money and a <br/>
car) to convince him to take his GED and enroll in college. His <br/>
father is willing to help him financially as long as he is in school. <br/>
His mother is also willing to help with his living expenses. This man <br/>
(aahhh! he is a man now) has been in my daughters life for almost 2 <br/>
years now and they have been discussing living together for the past <br/>
6 months or so. <br/>
<br/>
Right now I am managing to remain calm while pointing out that we <br/>
will not offer any financial assistance if she chooses to move out. <br/>
The voice in my head is screaming though and I really want to tell <br/>
her not to make a huge mistake, that there is plenty of time to take <br/>
on this kind of responsibility, etc. I was discussing my feelings <br/>
with a friend, who is also a list member, and she suggested I post <br/>
here and ask for advice. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

You sound like you are very happy with how your daughter is handling her<br/>
life in the beginning of the post. Somehow I don&#39;t get that feeling where<br/>
her boyfriend is concerned. It seems by saying *she&#39;s convinced* she&#39;s in<br/>
love, you don&#39;t believe that to be so. I also get the impression you don&#39;t<br/>
think much of her boyfriend. I could be wrong and reading things into your<br/>
post that you aren&#39;t feeling. Not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if your daughter is making great choices for her now, what makes you<br/>
think she will make choices that are disasters when it comes to her<br/>
boyfriend? It is possible that those two are meant to be together and will<br/>
live happily ever after. Maybe not probable, but possible. So support that<br/>
part of her life as you support all her other choices. She will need you in<br/>
the future to either share her happiness with her, or be there for her when<br/>
things don&#39;t go well. And if she does chose to move in with him, it will be<br/>
much easier sharing that experience with her instead of trying to talk her<br/>
out of it, maybe losing some trust you two have established along the way,<br/>
and even her doing something behind your back because you don&#39;t approve.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not always easy watching our older children make decisions that we may<br/>
know in our heart aren&#39;t right for them, but most likely, with our love and<br/>
support, they learn something from that experience whether it&#39;s a good one<br/>
or bad one. And most likely if that&#39;s the case, those kids are the kind that<br/>
need to learn it for themselves, not just by someone telling them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it takes a lot to keep our mouths shut, but it&#39;s worth the effort<br/>
when our children see us respect them and their wishes, no matter how much<br/>
we disagree. Telling her what you feel is fine, as long as you&#39;re not<br/>
telling her what you think she should do.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter will soon be 18, I&#39;ve been through what you are speaking of. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t easy for me to see her making decisions I considered far from the<br/>
best. But she still stayed the great kid she was while finding her way<br/>
through what she wanted. It took longer than what was comfortable for me<br/>
&lt;bg&gt; but she made wise choices along the way and worked her way through it.<br/>
And more importantly was how our relationship grew through it all. I can&#39;t<br/>
imagine how either one of us would have felt if she wasn&#39;t comfortable<br/>
sharing with me what she was going through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050980106">Plenty of kids go off to college at their age.  Moving in with someone is,<br/>
yes, a big deal.  But it&#39;s not like she just met the guy.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t help her any less than I would if she were getting an apartment<br/>
with any roommate.  Why?  Because if withhold help, she&#39;s going to not only<br/>
know you don&#39;t approve (which I&#39;m sure she&#39;s figured out) but feel that<br/>
because you don&#39;t back her on this, you don&#39;t back her on anything.<br/>
<br/>
Then if she DOES have trouble, you&#39;ve just put a big, fat, furry wall in<br/>
between you both.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you should trip over yourself to help her move.  I&#39;d be very<br/>
honest about the reasons I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea.  I&#39;d even ask her<br/>
not to.<br/>
<br/>

You might be hyperventilating at this possibility.  So<br/>
first off, breathe!! <br/>
<br/>
I would like to suggest that instead of drawing a line<br/>
in the sand that should not be crossed about something<br/>
that has not yet occured, you should instead talk with<br/>
your daughter and really listen to her, even if you<br/>
think you have already done this.<br/>
<br/>
Draw her out and talk with her about what she wants to<br/>
do.  If you think of something she might not have<br/>
thought of, you might ask in this way, &quot;Have you<br/>
thought about the possibility...&quot; and then let her<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
Give her a chance to tell you her thoughts and dreams<br/>
and plans.  Don&#39;t interrupt.  Don&#39;t criticize or<br/>
control.  Every time you feel like you can&#39;t breathe,<br/>
take a sip of your chai tea and inhale the steam from<br/>
the mug.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like she has made some great and mature<br/>
decisions about her life so far, holding down a job<br/>
and going to school, pursuing her interests.<br/>
<br/>
She might have very mature, sensible plans and they<br/>
might surprise you.  If she has definite goals for her<br/>
life, she may already have some ideas about how she<br/>
wants to reach them.<br/>
<br/>
She is almost grown.  You have one more year before<br/>
she is a legal adult.  It sounds like she is<br/>
responsible and mature.  Trust her a little bit more.<br/>
<br/>
Lines in the sand can be erased with a big toe, a hug,<br/>
an apology.  Talking together can help her solidify<br/>
her goals and the steps needed to get there, and help<br/>
her establish her own personal boundaries.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093810520">I assume her age is mostly the issue? I mean, would you be this <br/>
worried that it would be a &quot;huge mistake&quot; if everything else about <br/>
the situation were the same except for her age? Do you think it <br/>
would be a mistake at this age even if this guy was just wonderful <br/>
for her and they were really in love? Why is it bad to get into a <br/>
serious relationship at that age? Whatever issues are you concerned <br/>
about that you believe are specific to her age?<br/>
<br/>
Not trying to be combative :), I&#39;m just thinking that answering some <br/>
of these questions might help clarify the situation for you a little <br/>
bit. <br/>
<br/>
In some cultures a sixteen-year-old is considered an adult, <br/>
biologically and socially, with complete ability to survive <br/>
independently in his/her society. Our society, through our school <br/>
system, on the other hand, artificially extends childhood, so that <br/>
unschooled children are more likely to have that survival ability <br/>
earlier than their schooled counterparts. Perhaps she is as &quot;ready&quot; <br/>
(whatever that means) now as some people are when they are much <br/>
older.<br/>

&lt;&lt;The voice in my head is screaming though and I really want to tell <br/>
her not to make a huge mistake <br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Dedra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From someone who actually DID make a huge mistake and moved in with <br/>
a man (I use the term loosely) when I was 19, let me tell you the <br/>
one thing that made me actually admit my mistake and leave (although <br/>
it took 4 years).  I too was a mature 16 and 17 year old who had <br/>
made very sound decisions up until that point.  <br/>
<br/>
My family never once judged me or told me what a HUGE mistake I was <br/>
making.  They supported me every step of the way.  If I needed money <br/>
(I actually only asked for money once in 4 years), it was given <br/>
without 1000 questions as to why and what I was going to do with <br/>
it.  They were always kind to my boyfriend and included him in every <br/>
family event, never once (at least not to me or him) complaining or <br/>
criticizing.<br/>
<br/>
When I finally wised up and really looked at what kind of man I was <br/>
living with, I went to my grandmother (my mother had passed away) <br/>
and asked her if I could move in for a while until I could get back <br/>
on my feet.  She gave me a hug and cried with me because it hadn&#39;t <br/>
worked out.  BUT, the one thing that she didn&#39;t do was say &quot;I told <br/>
you so.&quot;  None of my family did (although I&#39;m sure it killed them <br/>
not to).  At least not until many years had gone by and even I could <br/>
laugh about what an idiot I was back then.  <br/>
<br/>
So....as hard as it may be, please don&#39;t cut your daughter off.  She <br/>
just may need your help (emotionally or financially) and, if you <br/>
have told her not to call you (with words or with actions).....who <br/>
knows what might happen.  If she feels that you support her, and she <br/>
feels that she really has made a huge mistake, at least she will <br/>
come to you for help when (or if) she needs it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Everyone, please remind me of these words if my DD starts down <br/>
the same road I have already been down.  I just hope that I am <br/>
strong enough to really support her when she needs it the most.</div>

her daughter off,* to withdraw emotionally, or to (heaven forfend) <br/>
not even be in touch with her.  Far from it.  I read this as a plea <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My sister is married to the guy she was in love with when she was 13 <br/>
years old. They waited until she turned 18 to date - he is 8 years <br/>
older than she is and dating an under-18 yo would not have been cool, <br/>
so they were just friends and she was considered just a little kid with <br/>
a sort of obvious crush on an older guy....cute.  On her 18th birthday <br/>
he asked her out on a real date and they got married pretty soon after <br/>
that. Waited a long time to have kids. They are now 45 and 53 and have <br/>
a 17 yo daughter and a 9 yo son.<br/>
<br/>
My 19 yo is in love, too. Her boyfriend (also an unschooler) lives in <br/>
Wisconsin and we live in Southern California. They met here, at an <br/>
unschooling get-together. He came and spent a week or two with us, then <br/>
she went there for a week, and then she went back and spent 3 months, <br/>
came home for a few months and went back for a week or two. He&#39;ll be <br/>
here for a week in March. At the end of the summer, she&#39;s planning to <br/>
go back there and a group of unschooled teen/young adults have plans to <br/>
rent a house together. She plans to stay there for a year and then both <br/>
of them are coming back here so she can go to a state university.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d be surprised at all for this to work out or for this <br/>
to be a permanent relationship. Why not? These kids have a tendency to <br/>
be serious and passionate and devoted TO their passions.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe 16 almost 17 seems really different than 19. But, the principles <br/>
are the same.<br/>
<br/>
Read &quot;Parent-Teen Breakthrough: A Relationship Approach,&quot; PLEASE!!!!!!! <br/>
You&#39;ll find it to be a very new and different point of view on raising <br/>
teens. I cannot recommend this book highly enough!!!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Melissa.  I did the same thing.  At 17 I got into a <br/>
serious relationship and moved in with someone that hadn&#39;t finished <br/>
growing up yet.  Even though I knew my mother didn&#39;t agree she never <br/>
threw it in my face or cut me off.  When I finally came back, it was <br/>
happily.  I kind of kicked myself for &quot;wasting&quot; five years but it <br/>
was a learning experience.  I am very grateful that my mother didn&#39;t <br/>
throw it in my face or hold it against me. She was just happy to <br/>
have me back.  It&#39;s hard to let your children go but if you cut her <br/>
off she really won&#39;t come back, even if she wanted to.  One thing I <br/>
do suggest is that you sit down with her and explain your fears. Not <br/>
in a judgmental way, but from a human perspective.  Let her know <br/>
that aside from worrying for her as a mother, you have your own <br/>
fears as a person.  Show her that you are just as frail as she is.  <br/>
Sometimes parents approach things from the &quot;parent with authority&quot; <br/>
position and it tends to separate you even further from your <br/>
children.  If your daughter is as thoughtful as she sounds I&#39;m sure <br/>
she would appreciate your concerns and fears presented as a friend <br/>
worrying about another friend.  It&#39;ll let her know that you are not <br/>
made of stone or pretending to have all of the answers.  She may <br/>
surprise you with her own strenth and you will have made a friend.<br/>

him into my home 3 times over the last 18 months and some of his <br/>
comments/stories concern me. His parents divorced when he was young <br/>
and seem to have spent the following years trying to buy his <br/>
affection. From what I have been able to piece together he was left <br/>
alone a lot at an early age. Once the relationship with my daughter <br/>
started his father began to use trips to Texas and a cell phone to <br/>
try and force his son to &quot;get his act together&quot;. His father sent me <br/>
an e-mail which made it clear my daughter had become the carrot he <br/>
had decide to dangle in front of his son. Because he didn&#39;t have any <br/>
parental involvement growing up he spent a lot of his early teen <br/>
years as a vandal and a bully. The racial slurs that flew out of his <br/>
mouth during his first visit scared the crap out of me. After saying <br/>
all of that I do have to admit that he treats my daughter wonderfully <br/>
and once I set down the rules here he followed them to the best of <br/>
his ability. <br/>

Quote from the original:<br/>

<br/>
&quot;You&#39;ll be on your own&quot; used as a threat is directly saying &quot;we will cut you <br/>
off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a daughter goes anyway, it&#39;s not unreasonable to expect that the parents&#39; <br/>
anger or the child&#39;s resentment will cause a rift.<br/>
<br/>
And the point made that the only way she can come home is in shame and <br/>
failure is valid.  It&#39;s another kind of cutting off.  It&#39;s the burning of bridges <br/>
and safe havens.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I read this as a plea <br/>
<br/>
from someone who is very concerned and is coming from a position of <br/>
<br/>
support for a daughter whom she loves very much.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seemed a request for us to help someone control her daughter.<br/>
It seems a call for any magical advice we could give to help the mom convince <br/>
the daughter that she is NOT &quot;in love&quot; or to help her see that she wants <br/>
parental financial support more than she wants what she thinks and claims she <br/>
wants (to live with her boyfriend).<br/>

the most. I would never cut her off emotionally and would offer <br/>
financial support if she had an emergency. Most of the areas she has <br/>
talked about wanting to live in are within 30 minutes of our home so <br/>
that is comforting at least. I am going to save your post and re-read <br/>

&gt; In some cultures a sixteen-year-old is considered an adult, <br/>
&gt; biologically and socially, with complete ability to survive <br/>
&gt; independently in his/her society. Our society, through our school <br/>
&gt; system, on the other hand, artificially extends childhood, so that <br/>
&gt; unschooled children are more likely to have that survival ability <br/>
&gt; earlier than their schooled counterparts. Perhaps she is as &quot;ready&quot; <br/>
&gt; (whatever that means) now as some people are when they are much <br/>
&gt; older.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All good points to think about. Part of the problem could be that it <br/>
just seems too early to have her leave home. Maybe it is too early <br/>
for me rather than for her? I think there are more questions I should <br/>
be asking myself. <br/>

You can&#39;t shelter her from the world.  The only thing you can do is <br/>
hold up your end of the bargain.  Be there when she needs you.  <br/>

<br/>
Girlosophy 2 by Anthea Paul (Be sure to get 2 since it deals with love and romantic <br/>
relationships)<br/>
<br/>
She empowers young women/teens to make decisions about love, living together, sex <br/>
etc. I love the non-judgmental sensible approach she has. The book is gorgeous to <br/>
look at and hold (it&#39;s not a text drvien book, but is almost entirely visual with an look <br/>
of India about it).<br/>
<br/>
My daughter told me she likes it because the realistic possiblities are laid and out but <br/>
the chices are left to the girl. And even mistakes are treated as stepping stones to <br/>
empowerment rather than highlighted as regrets to suffer over.<br/>
<br/>
One of the hardest lessons for me this last year was learning to trust my daughter&#39;s <br/>
relationships and judgment about her friends, boys etc. It&#39;s not that I feel better <br/>
because things turned out well. It&#39;s that I learned through the process that this really <br/>
is her life and she really is choosing it. So I decided I wanted to be an ally not an <br/>
obstacle.<br/>

help you keep your priorities in order and have perspective during this <br/>

in CA, boyfriend in Wisconsin, lots of travel, and plans to move in <br/>

also unschooled his whole life - and seems to be very thoughtful and <br/>

wanted advice on how to control any of my children I wouldn&#39;t ask for <br/>
it on an unschooling list. ;-) I hope that I have explained the part <br/>
about not offering financial support. We simply do not have the <br/>
resources to help her pay rent, etc. in order for her to live with <br/>
her boyfriend. This would be the case if she wanted to move in with a <br/>
roommate or go to college in another state. My daughter wants to be a <br/>
Vet. and we have talked about the fact that she will need to help <br/>
fund this dream. We can afford tuition *in district* while she lives <br/>
at home. We can not afford out of state tuition without a commitment <br/>
on her part to help with the expense. This is just a fact of life and <br/>
one we have discussed. The same way I discussed that we couldn&#39;t help <br/>
them &quot;financially&quot; if they got their own apartment. I would not cut <br/>
her off as far as her tuition though she has already pointed out that <br/>
she would have no problem getting financial aid if she were living on <br/>

Parents income and assets counts even if kids live away from home and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Check on that -- when I did similar thing 17 years ago or so, I ended <br/>
up not qualifying for a couple of years, until my tax forms showed me <br/>
as an independent for two (or three?) consecutive years.  If you are <br/>
currently claiming her as dependent, and if the rules for federal aid <br/>
are the same, she may run into the same situation.  Have her get a <br/>
copy of the FFA from any college admissions office, and look <br/>
carefully at that requirement.<br/>
<br/>
Since I posted this, I&#39;ll share just a bit of my experience.  I moved <br/>
in with a guy when I was 19, in part because my mom had 1. taken away <br/>
my college money and 2. made such a big issue of me seeing him <br/>
seriously -- those actions nearly destroyed our mother/daughter <br/>
relationship, and when I needed help and a place to live, I could not <br/>
make myself turn to her.  In one sense, she was right -- he was an <br/>
awful fit for me, and 5 years later I could admit that and move on.  <br/>
But I learned a lot along the way, and much of that I wouldn&#39;t trade <br/>
for a more normal college experience.  My mom and I are reconciled <br/>
and quite close now, but that history is forever a part of our <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
So my point is this:  even if it&#39;s not a love that will last for her <br/>
lifetime, it is certainly something she can learn from.  She will <br/>
come out on the other side; she will be okay.  She will be even more <br/>
okay if she still has her mom on her side.  I can see by your posts <br/>
that you are realizing this.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
