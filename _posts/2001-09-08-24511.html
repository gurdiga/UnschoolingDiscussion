<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449956049">I joined this list looking for adult conversation, support, advice and <br/>
debate in an area I care very much about and want to learn more about. If I <br/>
want to hear name-calling, back biting, and arguing I can get plenty of that <br/>

they learn better. I think I&#39;ll look for my advice elsewhere.<br/>

&lt;&lt; A word of warning to all on this unschooling list, I can be very direct, <br/>
to <br/>
 the point, some may think downright rude and inpolite.  So when a subject <br/>
 catches my attention I&#39;m going to be very outspoken about it.... Whether <br/>
 people like the way I write or not, is not my concern... It&#39;s important that <br/>
 I say what I need to say... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I like this Dawn. I think if I said what I wanted more often on this <br/>
computer it may just help me IRL. I am such a scaredy cat. OK just jump in <br/>
the pool no wading.;o)<br/>
<br/>
    Also I can&#39;t remember,are you in the US now or are you in Britain <br/>
somewhere?<br/>
