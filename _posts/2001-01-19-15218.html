The History of Homeschooling email list is designed to share personal <br/>
experiences and first-hand information about the development of the <br/>
homeschooling movement. This is a forum to share the experiences and <br/>
memories of the people who have been involved with homeschooling over <br/>
the last twenty years: the families who found themselves facing legal <br/>
action for their educational decisions, the networkers who helped <br/>
build support groups and organizations, the activists who helped <br/>
draft and pass laws and regulations, the entrepreneurs who created <br/>
businesses serving the homeschooling community, the authors who wrote <br/>
books on the subject, the families who homeschooled their children - <br/>
and, of course, the children who were homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
There have been several &quot;histories of homeschooling&quot; compiled in the <br/>
last few years, by such notable writers as Linda Dobson , Patrick <br/>
Farenga, Cheryl Seelhoff, Dr. Raymond Moore, Dr. Patricia Lines, and <br/>
an ongoing series in the National Home Education Network journal, <br/>
&quot;Voices.&quot; This list is a place to relate personal experiences of what <br/>
has been so frequently written about; the &quot;I was there&quot; reports of <br/>
events which transpired five, ten, fifteen or twenty years ago. The <br/>
goal of this list is to share the first-hand stories, to relate the <br/>
history of homeschooling in the United States through the words of <br/>
people who shaped - and continue to shape - the movement.<br/>
