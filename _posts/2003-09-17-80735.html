<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183775950">I have also. I am normally a reserved personal person esp with my body. With <br/>
my first I was a wreck nursing in public but with my last two I have been much <br/>
more relaxed. <br/>
I nursed with my sling every where. The mall, dinner, holidays with family, <br/>
grocery shopping, outings, church (where it was well accepted even without a <br/>
sling) and others. I dont recall not feeling comfortable to nurse anywhere.  The <br/>
slings are big enough with an infant that you are totally covered as is the <br/>
baby.  <br/>
I have never made it past 7-8mo in my nursing so I have no clue what it is <br/>
like to nurse a toddler as that would be out of the sling, bigger and much more <br/>
obvious.  But getting to the 8 mo mark and knowing and wishing I had gone <br/>
longer I plan to with this next baby/s.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592953730">(quotes from two different posts- dont know who- digest - sorry)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Whole large boob, WHOLLY out, twice as big as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the baby, mom being purposely shocking<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;It wasn&#39;t about nursing, it was about shock value, attention, look at me<br/>
 </span></blockquote>people!  THAT kind of nursing gives nursing moms a hard row to hoe if you<br/>
ask me,<br/>
not the ones that are discreet.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming that because you are shocked (or alot of people are shocked), it<br/>
must be that person&#39;s intention to shock, is faulty reasoning and a reason<br/>
to justify judgement and &quot;attitude&quot; against the person- and in this case<br/>
distain for the human body and its natural functions.<br/>
<br/>
If a person responds defensively to a &quot;helpful comment&quot; (to find an<br/>
&quot;appropriate&quot; place to nurse, or &quot;this is Kinkos, a place of business, and<br/>
children should not be loud&quot;, or anything like that ) it is because they<br/>
felt attacked.<br/>
<br/>
If we have distain for the human body and its natural functions in certain<br/>
places or at all, it is because of our culture and society.  If we ourselves<br/>
claim that we don&#39;t have distain for the human body and its functions, but<br/>
feel it is our business to let others know in a way that entices<br/>
defensiveness when they might &quot;offend others&quot; who are shocked by the sight<br/>
of a breast in an &quot;inappropriate place&quot;, that is also because of our culture<br/>

are due.  THe time to learn to breastfeed is BEFORE you give birth, this <br/>

didn&#39;t need to be as hard as it was.  It would have helped for me to have <br/>

other for me and it just felt a natural progression. What better way to<br/>
continue respecting your child and responding to them than by unschooling?<br/>
