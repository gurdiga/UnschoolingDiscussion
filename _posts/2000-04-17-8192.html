&gt;Hi all, I am working on an article on the common myths or misconceptions<br/>
&gt;about unschooling and unschooling families. We have all heard the very<br/>
&gt;sad.... If left to there own devices kids would just sit and watch TV or <br/>

<br/>
You will have learning gaps...<br/>

-unschoolers are lazy and don&#39;t discipline their children.
<p>-unschoolers are chaotic and are anit-rules just to be anti-rules&nbsp;
they have no deeper reasons. i.e. unschoolers are contrary and non-conformist
for it&#39;s own sake.
<p>here&#39;s a website that really annoyed me because it passes opinion off
as fact.&nbsp; i think it will provide you with lots of &#39;fallacies&#39;.&nbsp;
the author happens to be on our local list and i had a very brief interaction
but quickly realized (and was advised) it was a waste of time because she
needed to <u>defending</u> &#39;teaching&#39; by attacking unschooling.&nbsp; imo
this is a really silly thing to do.&nbsp; anyway here are some excerpts
and links to check out for yourself:<i></i>
<p><i>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Unschooling in Theory ...&nbsp;</u></i>
<br><i>John Holt&#39;s philosophy of unschooling is based on a false premise:
the premise that ideas are innate. His radical position is that children
automatically know how and what to learn, that they&#39;re born with the knowledge
of how to get nonsense.&nbsp; The proper methods of developing one&#39;s own
intellect have to be learned just like any other knowledge, and having
a teacher to guide the process is of significant value. (See Objective
Approach.) A parent who insists that a child must lead his own education
places an undue burden upon his young shoulders. Children do not yet have
a broad enough context to see how knowledge fits together; they dont mysteriously
&quot;know&quot; what they can&#39;t possibly know.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm">http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm</a>
<p>imo:&nbsp; the burden, placed on children, of parents who lack faith
in a child&#39;s ability and desires is the true burden.&nbsp;&nbsp; and the
fallacy is that unschooling parent don&#39;t facilitate the &#39;fitting together
of knowledge&#39;.&nbsp; which leads to the denial that children question the
world around them and that these questions led to the experience of &#39;how
knowledge fits together&#39; and these experiences, if not discovery naturally
but the child, are provided and facilitated by the parents.&nbsp; unschooling
parents and their children choose a lifestyle of learning and thereby don&#39;t
make a distinction between life and teaching.
<p>&nbsp;<i>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Unschooling is:&nbsp; Anti-schooling...</u></i>
<br><i>John Holts advice to unschooling parents from Teach Your Own (p.
229) sums up his theory in practice:</i><i></i>
<p><i>&quot;I say, above all else, dont let your home become [a] miniature
copy of the school. No lesson plans! No quizzes! No tests! No report cards!
Even leaving your children alone would be better; at least they could figure
out some things on their</i>
<br><i>own. Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as
much as you can.&quot;</i><i></i>
<p><i>In other words, let the child be responsible for his own education.
You parents dont have to do anythingdont plan a curriculum, dont try
to evaluate your childs progress, dont try to teach him. Just leave him
alone to learn from life.</i>&nbsp; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" HREF="http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm">http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>imo: i don&#39;t know how you can &#39;live together&#39; and then &#39;leave your [kids}
alone&#39;.&nbsp; and the point that life-learners are people who have developed
the skills of self-motivation and curiosity is completely lost in this
&#39;interpretation&#39;.
<p>overall this author exhibits a need, for whatever reason, to have control
over her children and their learning process, yet is not secure enough
in this position to just do it, but must support the position by negating
the possibility that there is a way where a child can learn and not be
controlled.&nbsp; imo we as parents need faith in ourselves as well as
our children and this is perhaps the toughest hurdle presented by unschooling
- obviously this author was unable to make this &#39;leap of faith&#39; and perhaps
should follow a different philosophy.

This is what I posted as a comment to a lengthy discussion on intellectualcapital.com
about schools, schooling and teachers:
<p>{ This discussion (the one on intellectualcapital.com) is truly like
discussing astrology or phrenology. A great raft of accepted notions which
have ZERO validity are bandied about with much quoting of statistics.
<p>The EMPEROR HAS NO CLOTHES! &quot;Education&quot; is about making money, enforcing
values, stifling questioning, ensuring conformity, destroying the
<br>inherent love of learning, detaching children from their families,
insuring that armies have willing solidiers, protecting the power of the
powerful. To silently witness this discussion is like being ensnared in
a nightmare/dream. Schooling is little better than wholesale incarceration
of the young.
<p>Each day of freedom is bright with promise. Boredom when you are free
is the matrix of creativity. When you are imprisoned boredom is the cauldron
in which cruelty boils. Schools are rife with bullies because they are
run by well-meaning bullies who are oblivious to the fact that their function
is to bully. Just as in a prison, the powerful control the less powerful
right down the line.
<p>I know that people may have good intentions but I just can&#39;t stand the
hollowness of this discussion. I know that iconoclasm is only popular if
it is not your icon being thwacked. }
<p>I post this here because arguing with a schooled, schooling teacher
is maddening to say the least.

places an undue burden upon his young shoulders. Children do not yet have
a broad enough context to see how knowledge fits together; they dont mysteriously
&quot;know&quot; what they can&#39;t possibly know.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm">http://www.hometaught.com/app_unschooling.htm</a>
<p>imo:&nbsp; the burden, placed on children, of parents who lack faith
in a child&#39;s ability and desires is the true burden.&nbsp;&nbsp; and the
fallacy is that unschooling parent don&#39;t facilitate the &#39;fitting together
of knowledge&#39;.&nbsp; which leads to the denial that children question the
world around them and that these questions led to the experience of &#39;how
knowledge fits together&#39; and these experiences, if not discovery naturally
but the child, are provided and facilitated by the parents.&nbsp; unschooling
parents and their children choose a lifestyle of learning and thereby don&#39;t
make a distinction between life and teaching.
<p>&nbsp;<i>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Unschooling is:&nbsp; Anti-schooling...</u></i>
<br><i>John Holts advice to unschooling parents from Teach Your Own (p.
229) sums up his theory in practice:</i>
<p><i>&quot;I say, above all else, dont let your home become [a] miniature
copy of the school. No lesson plans! No quizzes! No tests! No report cards!
Even leaving your children alone would be better; at least they could figure
out some things on their</i>
<br><i>own. Live together, as well as you can; enjoy life together, as
much as you can.&quot;</i>
<p><i>In other words, let the child be responsible for his own education.
You parents dont have to do anythingdont plan a curriculum, dont try
to evaluate your childs progress, dont try to teach him. Just leave him
alone to learn from life.</i>&nbsp; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm">http://www.hometaught.com/john_holt.htm</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>imo: i don&#39;t know how you can &#39;live together&#39; and then &#39;leave your [kids}
alone&#39;.&nbsp; and the point that life-learners are people who have developed
the skills of self-motivation and curiosity is completely lost in this
&#39;interpretation&#39;.
<p>overall this author exhibits a need, for whatever reason, to have control
over her children and their learning process, yet is not secure enough
in this position to just do it, but must support the position by negating
the possibility that there is a way where a child can learn and not be
controlled.&nbsp; imo we as parents need faith in ourselves as well as
our children and this is perhaps the toughest hurdle presented by unschooling
- obviously this author was unable to make this &#39;leap of faith&#39; and perhaps
should follow a different philosophy.
