understanding the spiritual cause and cure of ADHD<br/>
<br/>
The United States uses 90% of the world&#39;s supply of Ritalin, a stimulant<br/>
that affects the central nervous system the way amphetamines do.<br/>
Use and production of Ritalin is up by 700% since 1991. Seventy five percent<br/>
of the drug goes to children.<br/>
Nearly 5 million children and adults are diagnosed with Attention Deficit<br/>
Disorder (ADD).<br/>
Some experts say 10% of our kids have it.<br/>
If all took Ritalin, 1 in 6 boys ages 5-12 would use the drug.<br/>
(USA Today, Fall 1998, Lawrence H. Diller, author of Running on Ritalin)<br/>
<br/>
Americans believe drug abuse - more than crime or the breakdown of home<br/>
life - is the biggest danger facing children, according to a survey of 1,501<br/>
adults conducted by Harvard&#39;s School of Public Health and the University of<br/>
Maryland Survey Research Center. (USA Today, Summer 1998)<br/>
<br/>
Recently I was eating lunch with a student here at the College of<br/>
Metaphysics while my son Hezekiah and his friend Briana were playing five<br/>
feet away. Hezekiah, who is almost four years old, was moving his super<br/>
balls from a basket into a box in order to transport them upstairs. Every<br/>
once in a while he would call Briana&#39;s name, compelling her to look and<br/>
eventually inviting her participation.<br/>
<br/>
After watching him for some time Bill said, &quot;He never stops.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rarely,&quot; I replied, &quot;he&#39;s quite something. So quick, so bright, so vital<br/>
and vibrant.&quot;<br/>
I went on to tell Bill that if I was twenty years younger, without my<br/>
metaphysical background, Hezekiah would probably join the increasing legions<br/>
of bright but unruly kids being drugged by well-intentioned parents,<br/>
teachers, and physicians within the next two years.<br/>
<br/>
I would be like a growing number of mothers. I would have a profession that<br/>
demanded my attention and that a good part of my identity depended upon. I<br/>
would have stopped breast feeding by the second month, if tried it at all,<br/>
partly so I could return to my job. My son would have been cared for, and in<br/>
large part raised by someone else, whether a relative, friend, or employee<br/>
paid out of the money I made while working elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I would have believed I was doing the right thing. Providing the best for my<br/>
child.<br/>
I would not know what to do to calm him. I would often find myself too tired<br/>
to respond well to cries for attention, misinterpreting the plea for love<br/>
and discipline as something else and thus failing to fulfill my child&#39;s<br/>
needs. And my own.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, as early as three, the caregiver might show concern for my<br/>
son&#39;s disruptiveness, disobedience, or mere absent-mindedness. If I delayed<br/>
I might find my child refused care or even schooling. I would seek a<br/>
doctor&#39;s advice.<br/>
<br/>
Being a good physician, he would tell me that once we start there is no<br/>
stopping and two to three doses everyday are required. The drug does not<br/>
heal. Ritalin is thought to increase chemicals in the brain and to simulate<br/>
the inhibitory receptors producing the result of a stimulant drug&#39;s acting<br/>
to increase inhibition. Nobody knows the long term affects but while drugged<br/>
my child would be able to focus on what is at hand and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually I&#39;d give in. Believing I was doing, if not the best for my child,<br/>
at least what I had to do. His constant energy supply would be chemically<br/>
altered through daily doses of socially acceptable and even fashionable<br/>
drugs.<br/>
<br/>
I would lose my son.<br/>
<br/>
More importantly, he would lose himself.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, he wouldn&#39;t be such a problem for others anymore. Not so demanding. Nor<br/>
so bright and inventive.<br/>
<br/>
This is not just a hypothetical projection of what could have been in my<br/>
life, it is the story of increasing numbers of parents I am meeting and<br/>
counseling. Too often we, as a society, look for an easy way out. Pills are<br/>
seen as an easy way out, just look at the shelves of every pharmacy section<br/>
in your local market. It is a symptom of denial, stemming from a lack of<br/>
self discipline. On the whole, Americans don&#39;t know how to discipline<br/>
themselves toward positive, productive thinking that leads to health so they<br/>
don&#39;t teach this wisdom to their children.<br/>
<br/>
The greater problem we will face ten, twenty, forty years from now. Only<br/>
then will we realize, individually and collectively, what we have caused by<br/>
putting millions of human beings at age 4 or 6 or 8 on a type of &quot;speed&quot;.<br/>
The mental, emotional, and physical effects upon that child as he or she<br/>
enters puberty or when he is 16 or 29 or 42 or 60 will be known only as time<br/>
progresses.<br/>
<br/>
This is just the physical perspective. The real problem is once we get there<br/>
it will be too late to change several generations of drug abuse, intentional<br/>
drug addiction. We may never know the losses to individuals or society. We<br/>
must change.<br/>
<br/>
Attitudinal changes are the hardest. Yet when children are involved mothers<br/>
and fathers can and have often moved mountains.<br/>
<br/>
When I identify the significant changes in my thinking that have produced<br/>
the conditions in my life that have led me to be a parent, a role by the way<br/>
that I did not visualize for myself from the time of puberty until I was 41<br/>
years old, I hope there is insight that can help others.<br/>
<br/>
First realizing I am more than a body. Coming to terms with the difference<br/>
between and separation of mind and body freed me to put the physical world<br/>
in a more proper perspective. In time what had been important in my mind -<br/>
steady relationships, financial security, being needed and valued - was<br/>
replaced by a more deep-thinking, spiritually-centered, service-motivated<br/>
consciousness. This led to the current conditions in my life, including a<br/>
wonderful husband who is my life partner and our visionary lifestyle that<br/>
enables my husband, son and I to live and work together. It also brings some<br/>
wonderful people into our son&#39;s life. Many teachers, each with different<br/>
areas of expertise to offer.<br/>
<br/>
Second, taking my next step in understanding myself as a soul. The idea of a<br/>
soul is something I was taught as a child, but it was lost in a turbulent<br/>
adolescent because it was belief based rather than knowing based. Maturing<br/>
my idea of soul, bringing it to the here and now rather than leaving it<br/>
before and after birth, caused major shifts in how I see myself and others.<br/>
This became very meaningful when I was pregnant. My husband and I<br/>
communicated with the soul who became our son Hezekiah before he entered<br/>
this life. By learning his soul needs we could prepare ourselves to respond<br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as he is growing, we can encourage his talents and teach the skills<br/>
that will prepare him to meet his destiny. It frees me to learn and teach in<br/>
ways foreign to how I was taught as a child. I can respond to Hezekiah&#39;s<br/>
intense Michelangelo-scale illustrations of Moses and the Burning Bush which<br/>
persisted every morning for three months then give way to a month of<br/>
scientific invention including waterfalls made from suspending a ladle on a<br/>
facet spout and tongs used as arm extenders to put superballs in places<br/>
otherwise beyond his reach.<br/>
<br/>
Third, learning that thought is cause and developing the will power to apply<br/>
the knowledge. Concentration exercises were essential in this process, and<br/>
are an important part of what my husband and I are teaching our son. The<br/>
capacity to focus attention at will directed my creative energies and laid<br/>
the foundation for reasoning skills to flourish. I have taught hundreds of<br/>
adults the basics of how to use mind effectively - undivided attention,<br/>
remembering, imagination, listening - and it is such a joy to be able to<br/>
teach them to such a new soul. And quite a challenge for someone accustomed<br/>
to the civilities of adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
Advanced development in intuition is an enormous asset. Being able to<br/>
connect with Hezekiah is essential in him knowing we love him and in<br/>
teaching meaning behind actions. I have found my own creativity stretched<br/>
and so in the midst of a &quot;crying jag&quot; I can connect with Hezekiah&#39;s soul,<br/>
&quot;crying&quot; with him which quickly provokes giggles thus breaking the<br/>
nonproductive train of thought so a more productive one can be introduced.<br/>
<br/>
Fourth is acting upon a desire to aid others. Together my husband and I have<br/>
almost fifty years of teaching experience. We teach metaphysics,<br/>
understanding the universal laws and truths that govern creation and how to<br/>
live in harmony with them. We both know it is the most fulfilling life<br/>
anyone can hope to have.<br/>
<br/>
I have met many people in my life who function under the mistaken belief<br/>
that it is easier to teach children than adults. If that is so, we would not<br/>
be drugging our brightest children in order to &quot;control&quot; them. We would be<br/>
teaching them to become the geniuses they are meant to be.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching requires a high level of giving. A sacrificing of self for the<br/>
welfare of another. I think it is time to redefine what it means to bring a<br/>
child into the world. It is time to consider that we are vessels for souls<br/>
to enter, evolved souls who want to serve even before the body knows how to.<br/>
<br/>
Hezekiah is such a soul. He is not attention deficit anymore than probably<br/>
99% of those diagnosed as such. There may be moments when his mom is<br/>
attention deficit, from being tired or preoccupied thus her mind and body<br/>
are not in the same place. Hezekiah knows it, every time. And he lets me<br/>
know it too, which is becoming a great enrichment in my life for I am able<br/>
to practice being here now in ways I totally missed before.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with Hezekiah&#39;s attention. Rather his attention is<br/>
free, vital, lightning quick, and so very easy to arrest when the mind<br/>
meeting his is focused and wizened. I am dedicated to being such a focused,<br/>
wise mind, for to me I am much more than my child&#39;s parent, I am a soul&#39;s<br/>
mentor. That is the greatest any of us can ever hope to be.<br/>
