<div id="ygrps-yiv-132543837">I apologize in advance to Sandra if I do not respond appropriately to the rules of this forum. I do wish to offer a few sentences to &quot;sukaynalabboun&quot; immediately as time is of the essence.<div><br></div><div>My background to this type of experience is in loosing my brother at 29 to murder in a city on the opposite coast to his own. He was a tourist and taken in a moment of rage and confusion the night before his return. The city, who was as surprised as our family to this outcome, took great heed to find the people who made their city unsafe to visit. We were greatly comforted by this compassion.</div><div><br></div><div>Your family can unite at 17, 14 and 11. You can lean on each other to produce what this family desires and held most dear TOGETHER. My long lasting experience is that death affects everyone, no matter what age. Sharing sadness through reading books or watching movies about similar topics help build that discussion. &quot;Remember when. . .&quot; &quot;Maybe she/he would like. . .&quot; &quot;That makes me think maybe we could. . .&quot; may come up and propel you all forward together, not alone. It sounds like your friends exhibited this value. Do what you each feel. Even if you question a child&#39;s response, let them play it out. The gifts, actions, and quirky moments I received from friends and family helped me feel loved, helped me release sadness and soon laugh again.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Katherine Kubler-Ross books were most helpful for my Mom who has struggled with depression as she walks you through the stages of loss and how to support yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>Live for today rings true at this time.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137629425"><div dir="ltr">This is the first time posting for me. I have been so inspired by all of these discussions. I felt completely drawn to giving my feed back about this sad, sad predicament. <br><div><br></div><div>My experience of trauma and how to deal with it within my family is extensive. I am a survivor, which also tends to draw me to depression on anger. On top of that we fled from the Four Mile Fire in Boulder, Colorado and relocated for six months. As soon as we got settled, I found a large lump on my neck and found out that I had stage 4 Lymphoma. My daughter was eight years old. Then she was attending a two room school house in the mountains. For the last four years she has been unschooled. </div><div>I know that this sounds crazy, but all of this trauma has made my daughter wise beyond belief. She has already lived many lives (if you know what I mean). The fire and cancer has given her lessons of being strong for our family as well as for others. She has very deep compassion for people who are sick, dying, loss of a a family member etc. </div><div>What I can share with you, is that although at the time, she had counselors in her second grade, the life experience of such an ordeal changed  her for ever and <span class="ygrps-yiv-1137629425">unschooling</span> has given her the chance to feel what she is feeling, be directly involved with our family transitions and growth. </div><div>Although it has not been pretty, she has seen that through perseverance and compassion people can make it through horrific situations.  I was on anti depressants through Chemo, so I would not yell at her. I was constantly honest with her, explaining what was happening to my nervous system when she jumped on the bed. Or when my husband and I almost split up after thirty years and went to therapy and saved our precious family. She has seen first hand how all of it works if there is love and caring and a desire to heal. I think if she was in school, she would not have been able to see all of this transformation. </div><div>Be gentle with your clan, be honest, show them the big picture (loss and grieving, and growth and celebration). </div><div>By being honest of what you are going through and what they are going through they learn life lessons that most of us never learn until our 50s! I was always so protected in my child hood about death and trauma. And I had so much of it. </div><div>This is one thing I am learning about <span class="ygrps-yiv-1137629425">unschooling</span>, is that my child who is now 12 is wise beyond her years. She has never been protected from life in these last four years. She is really experiencing it all and I am grateful for this.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-38667104"><div><div>---I am asking the group for suggestions in terms of my maintaining a peaceful nest at this time. ---<br></div><br><div>I
 am sorry to hear about your loss. I would have replied earlier but I 
have only recently seen your post. I am a mum of two daughters who have 
always been unschooled. I worked for some time as a Clinical 
Psychologist with a Child and Family Bereavement Service in the UK 
before having my daughters.<br></div><div><br>It sounds like you were 
closely connected with the family that was involved in this tragic 
accident and that you spent a lot of time with them during the course of
 the week and that they were very much part of your lives.&nbsp;It would have
 been a huge shock and it is still very recent. It may feel as if your 
world has been turned upside down.&nbsp;Finding things that can bring you 
some comfort and familiarity at this time may help:&nbsp;things that you were
 used to doing as a family or for yourself, for example, going shopping 
together, walking the dog, watching a film, bringing food/drinks to 
family members and remembering to eat and to nurture yourself.<br>&nbsp;<br>It
 may also help to accept that your family life may look different for a 
while as you all take time to adjust to what has happened. The process 
of bereavement may last over many months and so it can be helpful to 
give yourselves time to grieve and to heal.&nbsp;Talking through what has 
happened either together or with those family members that would like to
 can be helpful. As can sharing memories and stories about what you were
 used to doing together as and when memories come up throughout the day.<br>Although
 this is an experience that you have all shared it can also help 
to&nbsp;recognise that each family member will grieve differently and may 
need different things. Being radical unschoolers can be helpful as your 
children are used to you responding to them as individuals and being 
sensitive to their unique needs. Some family members might find it 
helpful to talk about how they are feeling whilst others may prefer to 
express how they are feeling in different ways, such as in creative or 
physical activities or they may want to distract themselves. Your 
children might want to be more or less involved with the family you were
 close to depending on how they are feeling and it is helpful for them 
to have a choice about their level of involvement. Knowing your children
 well will help guide you as will having conversations with them when it
 feels right and letting them know you or another trusted adult or 
friend are available to talk to or to spend time with.<br></div><div><br>It
 can also be helpful to give the children the option to talk to someone 
outside of the immediate family whether that is a supportive family 
friend they trust or a bereavement counsellor (depending on what feels 
most comfortable to them). Sometimes children/young people might find it
 helpful to speak to someone outside of the family as they can be 
concerned about upsetting their parents or causing them more pain. &nbsp;This
 might be the case if they are aware that you have experienced 
depression and it might also help you to know that your children have an
 additional way of sharing their grief if you are feeling overwhelmed.<br>&nbsp;<br>I
 was not sure from your post who the surviving family members were, 
their ages and who was looking after them? It would be useful for you to
 know what support they have in place so that you know that they are 
being cared for, they are safe and their basic needs are being met and 
this may provide some relief. This could include checking if they have 
access to family bereavement support and counselling if they choose as 
well as any practical support they might need. Finding out how the 
family might like you to be involved at this time will enable you to be 
in a better position to know how you can be supportive and what you are 
able to offer.<br></div><div><br>It can also be helpful to find ways of 
enabling your children to feel connected to the family members that died
 or are injured in both the short and longer term. This might be by 
talking about things you did together, sharing stories or watching films
 that you all enjoyed or places you may have visited together. However, 
this will depend upon how each person is feeling and wanting to do but 
it can be helpful for family members to know that the family will still 
continue to be a part of your lives although they may no longer be 
physically present. It could also be worth exploring whether your 
children would like to visit the younger children who are injured in 
hospital or have some other way of staying in touch with what is 
happening to them, for example, if they would like to be given updates 
on their progress. They might like to write messages, draw pictures or 
send a gift (depending upon what is meaningful to them). &nbsp;<br></div><div><br></div><div>I
 don&#39;t know whether the funeral has taken place for the parents that 
have died but it might be helpful to consider how the children might 
want to be involved and whether they would like to attend. If they don&#39;t
 there could be other ways of creating a meaningful/personalised ritual 
together to enable them to say goodbye. There is some information in the
 links below about supporting children around grief and loss and how to 
include them and prepare them for the funeral.&nbsp;</div><div><br>It&nbsp;can be 
helpful for children and young people to be involved in what is 
happening if they wish and to be given choices.&nbsp;You&nbsp;mentioned that they 
wanted to help with joyfully distracting the younger grandchildren and 
this sounds like a good idea if this is something that you felt you 
could help facilitate. It may bring some comfort and joy to the children
 and enable them to be involved and connected to the family in a 
positive way. Your&nbsp;children might have more ideas about how they would 
like to be involved and ways of staying connected. When a death has 
occurred suddenly it is not unusual for the bereaved to experience 
seeing the deceased, to feel their presence or dream about them. For 
some children this can bring comfort and connection while others might 
be anxious about it. It can help to normalise these experiences and to 
let them know it is something that often happens when a person is 
grieving after a sudden loss. <br></div><div><br>---I have suffered from
 severe depression in the past, and this is a very depressing situation 
for us as we want to support this family, and to be the reliable kind 
friends they deserve. At the same time, I can feel the unavoidable 
negative/depressing parts seeping into my own behaviour. I want to be 
there for them (losing both parents at once is hard!) and also make sure
 I stay stable and positive for my own family.---<br></div><div><br>In 
order to be there for your family and to help maintain a peaceful nest 
it would help if you are feeling supported and that your feelings and 
needs are being understood and listened to. Because you have experienced
 depression in the past it sounds like you feel concerned that you will 
be pulled into a depth of grief and despair that might be overwhelming 
or may be difficult to re-surface from. This may be an understandable 
fear because you have been vulnerable to depression and you recognise 
the feelings. However, it also sounds like you are in a different 
position than you were in before because you have an awareness of this 
reaction in yourself to withdraw and you realise that it is not 
something that has been helpful to you or your family. The act of 
reaching out for support and talking about how you feel may enable you 
to find ways of experiencing your grief while staying connected with 
your family.<br></div><div><br>What have you found that has helped when 
you have been feeling low? It could help to talk to a supportive person 
whether this is a grief counsellor or someone who is able to be there 
with you, listen and be alongside you. Having an outlet for your 
feelings and your fears might enable you to keep connected to your 
family whilst at the same time acknowledging and taking care of your own
 needs. It might also help to connect with someone that you trust in 
your family or friendship circle and share with them how you are feeling
 so that they can be on your team and help notice if you are needing 
some extra nurturing or support. Even things like offering you something
 to eat or drink or if you need a few moments to take a bath or a walk, 
giving you a hug. Sometimes family members can provide each other with 
this support and sometimes it helps to enlist the help of someone 
outside of the family.<br></div><div><br>In the UK there are charities 
and services such as the one I worked for that can offer support for the
 whole family at various stages in the grieving process. Sometimes 
issues may come up later in your journey and meeting with other families
 or talking with people who have a knowledge of bereavement and loss can
 be help. I don&#39;t know what is available where you live? However, there 
is information about grief and supporting yourself, children and family 
members in the links below. There are also books and publications linked
 to on these websites for both children and families who have 
experienced a traumatic loss.<br></div><div><br></div><div>Winston&#39;s

and families. There is a range of info here as well as special section 
on the website for young people who have experienced different types of 
bereavement and a chat forum supervised by bereavement professionals.
