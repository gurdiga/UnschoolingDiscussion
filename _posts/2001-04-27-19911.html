&gt;     Many people still talk of our wedding as the coolest they have been to<br/>
&gt; but I can&#39;t remember much of it. We made the rounds and didn&#39;t even get<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of the best advice I got before my wedding was to consciously stop<br/>
yourself and watch and listen to what is going on around you. So many people<br/>
go through their weddings and don&#39;t remember it, because of the excitement<br/>
and activity. So when it&#39;s happening, let your mind open up and record it.<br/>
I&#39;m so glad someone told me this!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you&#39;re going to hire a photographer, make sure you like their<br/>
personality and that they understand your expectations. They can get awfully<br/>
pushy just to get &quot;the shot&quot;. Given my passion for photography, I knew I&#39;d<br/>
be *way* picky about our wedding photos, so I interviewed about 12<br/>
photographers and looked at their portfolios, talked with them about their<br/>
approach, etc. Boy, there are some BAD wedding photographers out there<br/>
charging money!<br/>
<br/>
We had a huge formal wedding, which is maybe not what I&#39;d choose now, but it<br/>
was really wonderful then (despite all the planning). One of the most fun<br/>
things we did is that we each created a photo collage from childhood on up,<br/>
and then we created one of us together. It was really cool to sit down with<br/>
my then-DH-to-be and go through our childhood and teenage pictures. And fun<br/>
for our friends to be able to see the background of the person their friend<br/>
was marrying. Lots of people told us they really liked looking at those.  We<br/>
also tried to have some personal touches that really reflected us. Our<br/>
wedding cake had an airplane on top and us sitting on a cloud, it was blue<br/>
:-)<br/>
