Asthma, other breathing related allergies like pet dander; severe eczema<br/>
and skin allergies to dyes, perfumes and other elements; severe fatal food<br/>
allergies to nuts and eggs and severe allergies to all diary products, most<br/>
preservatives and some heavy spices.  I don&#39;t think we have discovered all<br/>
of his allergies yet, but we have made quite a few trips to the ER, as we<br/>
found out the ones we know the hard way.  He made me very nervous when he<br/>
was tiny, due to his strange breathing patterns.<br/>
<br/>
We treat his Asthma with albuterol syrup, only symptomatically for acute<br/>
attacks.  We have been advised to carry his meds for his food allergies<br/>
with us wherever he goes, as some of his allergies are dangerous enough<br/>
that there would not be time to save him if we did not have direct access<br/>
to his medication.<br/>
<br/>
When he was a newborn his eczema and other skin allergies required that he<br/>
recieve daily oil rubs, daily doses of various creams and sleep with a cool<br/>
mist humidifier, as he was scaly and/or rashy from head to toe for a few<br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
We feed him anything and everything we can find with added calcium and with<br/>
iron, and all sources of protien that he can eat.  He eats cereal with rice<br/>
milk, sorbet instead of ice cream or sherbert, etc.  So far we have not<br/>
discovered any new severe allergens in a while.<br/>
<br/>
I have not noticed a problem with his sleeping pattern, though.  He did not<br/>
sleep through the night until about 10 months, but woke up at around 1-2am<br/>
ravenous and would wolf down a feeding and go promptly back to sleep.  Now,<br/>
he sets his own schedule, and is alseep by 10pm almost every night and<br/>
wakes around 8am.  He takes a 2-3 hour nap about every 2nd or 3rd day at<br/>
mid-day, the same time as his baby brother, which allows me to get some<br/>
rest also or have quiet time a few times a week.  He wakes occasionally in<br/>
the night, but usually due to a nightmare or night terror recently, and is<br/>
usually easily soothed back to sleep by lying with him and petting him for<br/>
a few minutes.<br/>

    I was thankful to find this group for support for unschooling....I have<br/>
4 children(11, 8, 6 and 3) that have been unschooled since...well, since<br/>
always.  We live in Western Massachusetts.<br/>
But it looks like for once this year I got TRULY lucky and found this<br/>
conversation as well.<br/>
    I&#39;m sorry for such an abrupt introduction but I just had to jump in on<br/>
this while I had the chance to learn more from others in a similar<br/>
situation.<br/>

&gt;Nice to meet you all,<br/>
&gt;Carrie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nice to meet you too, Carrie.  I believe that Homeschooling is one of the<br/>
best ways to help kids with multiple allergies and/or sensitivities.  In a<br/>
very real and important sense we can control their environment much more<br/>
than if they were in IS.  This is not to say that I am &quot;sheltering&quot; my<br/>
child or giving him some unreal advantage that he will not be able to copy.<br/>
 On the contrary, adults have a lot of choices about what and where and<br/>
when they eat, spend time, etc.  People can choose to leave a job if the<br/>
situation is not a healthy one, for whatever reasons.  Children in IS have<br/>
no such luxury and must be where, when and what the schools tell them to<br/>
be.  We all know how inflexible and unhealthy IS can be for our children,<br/>
and how many decisions are made in ignorance of, or contrary to, a child&#39;s<br/>
well being or a parent&#39;s wishes.<br/>
<br/>
Also many allergies are cumulative in nature and by minimizing our<br/>
children&#39;s exposures early in life we can give them the advantage of a<br/>
stronger defense later.  I do not believe that exposure to allergens builds<br/>
a tolerance.  It has just not been my experience that allergies work this<br/>
way.  Think about people who develop allergies from overexposure to things<br/>
like, say, shellfish.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, simple snack-time at a preschool could kill my child if they<br/>
should serve him cookies or peanut butter, or at the least send him into<br/>
swelling, mucus from every oroface and prjectile vomitting if they serve<br/>
him milk, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
He has severe hives and asthma reaction to most dogs, but seems to do well<br/>
with cats, conversely.  However, the cats are not allowed in his bedroom at<br/>
all, least of all on his bed.<br/>
<br/>
I had undiagnosed (due to neglect) asthma and some food allergies as a<br/>
child, and I was constantly suffering.  Going hungry if the school lunch<br/>
was not something I could eat (which is BAD as I am hypoglycemic) having<br/>
Astma attacks in PE, etc.  I got to the point where I would sit out of PE<br/>
and take constant F&#39;s and 0&#39;s and the daily blows to self esteem, etc,<br/>
rather than compromise myself in an Asthma attack.<br/>
<br/>
Having my children at home also helps me to be more in tune with their<br/>
natural ups and downs in energy, mood swings, and other bodily reactions<br/>
that might be signals of food or other problems.  I believe it lets me stay<br/>
on top of the issue much better than if I only spent a few hours a day with<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
As I said before, I have not had much problem with sleeping for my son who<br/>
has Asthma and allergies.  I guess I have been lucky.  However, if you have<br/>
forced air heat, try a filter in your child&#39;s room vent, and change the<br/>
main furnace filter (which should be a high efficiency one) every month.<br/>
Also you might try a humidifier, or mister to keep the air from being too<br/>
dry.  Hard wood floors, or linoleum and lighter materials that are not as<br/>
prone to holding dust on draperies and upholstered furniture are also<br/>
helpful.  If you have indoor pets I would try to keep them out of the<br/>
child&#39;s room, and or keep them in another area of the home, if possible.<br/>
Use an ostrich feather duster or the new magnetic dust cloths for dusting,<br/>
to avoid stirring up dust.  Put anti-allergy coverings on matresses and<br/>
pillows and buy bedding with anti-allergy fillings.  Remove extra stuffed<br/>
animals from your child&#39;s room, or other items that can catch and hold<br/>
allergens.  Vacume often, floors, draperies and furnishings.<br/>
Hmmmm....that&#39;s about all I can think of off the top of my head.  Of course<br/>
you may have already evaluated all of these areas, but I hope you can find<br/>
something useful here.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this is necessarily the case, although there could be a<br/>
connection with some kids.  The one of mine who had night terrors does not<br/>
have any problems with allergies.  The one who has allergies never had<br/>
night terrors.<br/>
<br/>
fwiw, all of us keep late hours.  We have no reason to have to get up early<br/>
most of the time, so it isn&#39;t an issue.  It&#39;s easier now that the kids are<br/>
old enough to stay awake later than I do if they want. It is not unusual<br/>
for the two boys to get to bed around 5:30am or so.  I usually go to bed<br/>
somewhere between 2 and 3, our youngest usually goes when I do (but not<br/>
always), my dh goes to bed around 6 or 7 most nights/mornings.  It varies<br/>
somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids were younger and didn&#39;t sleep much, it was difficult for me<br/>
at times.  My oldest didn&#39;t sleep through the night even once until he was<br/>
two years old.  Even now, he doesn&#39;t need much sleep.<br/>

The night terrors I believe are the result of allergies---My daughter also<br/>
Has a severe allergy to bees and I KNOW how scary that is!<br/>
She blew up like a balloon hives every where vomiting and etc.......I am<br/>
sure you have been there!!<br/>
AND we were camping during the week and I had no car and I was running like<br/>
a stark raving lunatic through the campground after calling 911 and just<br/>
made it before the ranger left for the day---he sent another ranger to watch<br/>
my four other kids .....OFF to the hospital and I am bawling etc....BUT that<br/>
is one allergy that I do TREAT---though she has not been stung in TWO years<br/>
since that time!<br/>
WHOOPEEEE<br/>
She does get hives occasionally (though she never did before---SHE had to<br/>
have steroids etc....because her body kept reacting and reacting (and the<br/>
bee only nipped her)--)The steroids etc.. gave her headaches and belly aches<br/>
and to this day she complains of them<br/>
I was saying that letting ones body build up immunity instead of relying on<br/>
medicines (I feel) helped my son overcome some of his allergies...HE does<br/>
not have them as severely as your son!!<br/>
Good luck tho&#39;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810883409">My one son who does not have &quot;classic&quot; allergy symptoms was having night<br/>
terrors for several weeks and we would have to go through the house and<br/>
search out any monsters..I believe it was something in his diet as it went<br/>
away!<br/>
He does get the occasional allergic symptom to certain changes in his<br/>
diet---I.E. when we run out of rice milk or are eating out alot---as do some<br/>
of the other children!<br/>
Sometimes it is as simple as a change in detergent!<br/>
WE had some friends cats for a couple of months and now they are gone and he<br/>
no longer has the night mares/terrors maybe it was the cats?!<br/>
Anyways you are right about not really knowing sometimes!<br/>
I just try my best!!!<br/>
SOSusan..glad to not search out the monsters etc anymore!<br/>
PS<br/>
yeah we also do not get up early so it does make for an easy late night<br/>
sleeping pattern!</div>
