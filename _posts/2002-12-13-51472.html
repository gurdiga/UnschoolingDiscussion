<br/>
Your right, hindsight is always 20/20.  I DO want to hear what others think, <br/>
because it&#39;s likely there will be a next time.. If not with Landon, with my <br/>
other children.  We did exhaust all possiblities.  The shopping trip had <br/>
already been planned, and there were about 20 other kids involved, so they <br/>
couldnt change the date &quot;just for him&quot;.. We only had one vehicle capable of <br/>
making the trip.. The tires weren&#39;t reliable on our car.   I asked Mom and <br/>
Dad to bring him down the next day, but they also had previous plans ( and, <br/>
they dont like to camp.. lol)  So, we did try to find a solution.  I did feel <br/>
guilty.. I felt like I was depriving him of some life changing experience.. <br/>
That is how he felt,and how he wanted me to feel. And there was plenty of <br/>
resentment go go around too. .He resenting us for outvoting him.. And us <br/>
resenting him for have such a bad attitude and trying to make the rest of us <br/>
miserable.    I guess the good thing is, we all survived.    And the hard <br/>
lesson is, in life, you can&#39;t always get what you want. <br/>
<br/>
 As a matter of fact, I had to say no again to him last week.    The big ice <br/>
storm was forecast and it has started freezing rain.  He wanted to go out to <br/>
lunch with some of his friends.  The roads were already beginning to get <br/>
slippery.  His friend who was driving has only had his liscense for a few <br/>
months.  I said, No. I&#39;m sorry, you can&#39;t go, its too risky.  He was mad <br/>
again. That indestrutible attititude that &quot;nothing will happen to me&quot; kicked <br/>
in and he argued that he should be allowed to go.  I didn&#39;t give in.    I <br/>
asked him if the other kids parents said they could go.   He said that they <br/>
were working and didnt know where they were or really care what they were <br/>
doing.  I said.. Oh, OK, so you wish I didnt care about you.. He said., well, <br/>
no, but it would be a lot more fun..  Well,I would rather him be alive and <br/>
mad at me than killed while having fun.  Anyway, he ranted and fussed and <br/>
raved for about an hour.. Then he realized that the roads were completetly <br/>
iced over.. He called his friend and guess what.. They didnt go out to lunch <br/>
either. He is the stage manager of a play that is running this weekend.  He <br/>
and his friends all went out to eat last night after the play.  And the roads <br/>
were clear :-)  Again, alls well that ends well. IMO.. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am really behind... but in a case like this, I would have said<br/>
something like, &quot;I&#39;m concerned about you driving with an inexperienced<br/>
driver on icy roads&quot; and started a dialogue from there. A response like<br/>
that just seems much easier for my daughter to take than the sort of<br/>
response you gave  - then we can focus on the really issue, my concern<br/>
about her safety, and often she comes up with solutions I hadn&#39;t thought<br/>
of, or adds information that changes things.<br/>
