<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597918224">Hey all, <br/>
Jacli here :)  Helen I have one thing to say to you.<br/>
AMEN.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly I have been concerned about the indicators you<br/>
mentioned <br/>
for a while.  Every time I hear of another government<br/>
program directed for<br/>
homeschoolers I cringe.  The other day I watched the debate<br/>
for governor in New Jersey.  Yeah, I know I don&#39;t live in<br/>
NJ.  I just like to watch this stuff occasionally.  I&#39;m<br/>
odd.  Anyway, a man got up and said something like &quot;We&#39;re<br/>
homeschoolers.  Why do we have to pay for public schools?&quot;<br/>
Another one asked why doesn&#39;t the state do something to<br/>
help out private schoolers and homeschoolers.  My daughter<br/>
thought it was really cool to hear homeschoolers speaking<br/>
out.  She also thought they all had a point.  <br/>
She wanted to know why I haven&#39;t spoken up like that.  She<br/>
wanted to know why I cringed with each statement.<br/>
<br/>
I told her quite simply, I don&#39;t want any help from the<br/>
government.  I don&#39;t want any of their strings or their<br/>
attention.  I don&#39;t want to give them a chance to get their<br/>
foot in the door.  Basically I want Uncle Sam to leave me<br/>
alone (on that score anyway).  <br/>
<br/>
And yet.   When I heard of the demise of GWS I couldn&#39;t<br/>
help the shiver of vulnerability (fear?) that ran down my<br/>
spine.  Although I personally have always preferred reading<br/>
HEM to GWS the fact is that I liked having both magazines<br/>
around.  I liked knowing that John Holts legacy was one of<br/>
our most respected supporters.  Now I feel like my guard<br/>
has been let down and one of my protectors is gone.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately I have rediscovered the Unschooling list.  This<br/>
list is my connection to the unschooling community at<br/>
large.  It is an open forum that encourages and provokes<br/>
thinking and re-thinking.  Friendships are made, networking<br/>
and sounding off is done and on the way a whole lot of<br/>
unexpected learning.  Just my idea of what unschooling/home<br/>
education should be.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t lose heart Helen, politicians come and go but we&#39;re<br/>
here for each other *and for HEM.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Jacli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The fact is I liked having both magazines around too, Jacli. There&#39;s <br/>
a certain comfort in numbers, and Patrick (GWS publisher) was - still <br/>
is - a good friend. We&#39;re working together on a Holt/GWS tribute of <br/>
some sort for an upcoming issue of HEM.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re studying the situation, trying to figure out what  - if <br/>
anything - we should do to strengthen our position as a publication <br/>
offering a different way of thinking about children and learning. <br/>
There are no easy answers - discussions on several state lists right <br/>
now are focusing on the relentless drive of public school programs to <br/>
reingage homeschooling families. I fear homeschooling as we now know <br/>
it will be a thing of the past before too many more years.<br/>
