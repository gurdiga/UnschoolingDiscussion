<div id="ygrps-yiv-62197915">I just finished reading all the intros and now here is mine.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Claudia I live in Kansas with my husband and 4yr old daughter,<br/>
We decided to homeschool Victoria when she was still very young.  I love<br/>
to do research and so after we decided I set about reading as much as I<br/>
could about homeschooling<br/>
and that is how we ended up becoming unschoolers.  I am now reading John<br/>
Holts books and they<br/>
just reinforce everything I knew in my heart and logical mind.  I still have<br/>
the problem with testing or not<br/>
testing, I really like feedback and I still have the public school instilled<br/>
need for knowing if she is learning<br/>
I fight my urge to test her even informally.  And everyonce and awhile she<br/>
will surprise me by knowing something I was sure she didn&#39;t.<br/>
I am so glad there is this list and site I don&#39;t know any unschooler in my<br/>
area everyone seems or school at home.  and I just love getting email!!!!</div>
