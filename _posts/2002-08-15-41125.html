&gt; And pre-unschooling programs have curricula<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mom teaches &quot;early childhood education curriculum&quot; courses....science, <br/>
math, etc.<br/>
<br/>
She spends the entire time trying to convince her students that they just <br/>
need to provide an environment that lets the kids have freedom and lots of <br/>
choices of cool stuff to do. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s promoted that idea, as an early childhood professor, for many many <br/>
years (she retired last year from running a lab preschool after 35 years - at <br/>
age 71) and still teaches college courses. Her ideas on &quot;preschool&quot; (she <br/>
HATES the very word) are that kids should spend most of their time home with <br/>
their family, but that that coming 2 or 3 mornings a week for a couple of <br/>
hours to a place where they can have access to lots of art supplies, big <br/>
playground equipment, water, dirt, animals, etc., is nice for them and maybe <br/>
a needed break for parents. Also - she figures that if kids are going to be <br/>
in daycare and if it isn&#39;t going to be with other family members or friends, <br/>
that at least it ought to include FREEDOM to choose what to do with their own <br/>
time within the constraints imposed by being cared for as a group. In her <br/>
program, nothing was compulsory and all materials and equipment were <br/>
available all the time for any child to use as they wished.<br/>
<br/>
I was brought up with these ideas so that they seem self-evident to me. And, <br/>
I easily moved beyond my mom - I could never see any good reason why &quot;school&quot; <br/>
should be any different from her &quot;preschool&quot; and it was really easy for me to <br/>
recognize the deep human truth of the unschooling philosophy -- it was a <br/>
logical next step.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - she&#39;s fought an uphill battle for more than 3 decades - and it is <br/>
getting harder and harder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532012331">So... I have filled out the papers to start unschooling my youngest who<br/>
is 11. My 19 year old is having a hard time with it. Basically he said<br/>
suffering the trauma of school has helped him grow. I just asked him why<br/>
he felt he needed to suffer to learn. He just looked away in thought. I<br/>
admit I am a little fearful too so we will work through it together just<br/>
like anything else. It is hard because on this same day - today - I<br/>
enrolled my 14 year old with bipolar  and dyslexia in a therapuetic<br/>
school. The school is hands-on learning with 20 kids and 10 teachers. He<br/>
has learned to hate himself and feel useless and stupid at school. He is<br/>
full of fear and mistrust. He is so much less &quot;bipolar&quot; - stressed -<br/>
during the summer when he is out of school. If this doesn&#39;t work I will<br/>
teach him at home although at time he is like grabbing a tiger by the<br/>
tail. I feel this is it - the last straw. He just wants to quit school<br/>
yet, will try this school. It did look cool. <br/>
If I had to do it all over again I would have taught them all (6) at<br/>
home. I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t because I am a bit &quot;outside of the box.&quot;<br/>
My husband didn&#39;t want me to - I hardly ever listen to him:)... Oh well,<br/>
no sense looking back on the past. Michele<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, you&#39;re right. We have to trust we made the best decision we could based<br/>
on what we knew at the time and accept that where we are now is where we<br/>
need to begin.<br/>
