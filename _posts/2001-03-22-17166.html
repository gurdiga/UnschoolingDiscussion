&gt; Most of the time, when we&#39;re out, we get a positive response. With all<br/>
&gt; the school shootings lately and all the arrests of kids who have been<br/>
&gt; caught planning them, most people no longer think that you are crazy<br/>
&gt; to take your kids out of school. We get a lot of approving smiles. Of<br/>
&gt; course, we still get that dead stare when people don&#39;t quite know WHAT<br/>
&gt; to say --- this always makes me laugh inside.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s amusing that the most positive responses we get are from<br/>
younger people - late teens and early twenties - who invariably say<br/>
something like &quot;You&#39;re so LUCKY&quot; to my kids when they find out they&#39;re<br/>
homeschooling. That says it all :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to say that all the school shootings have certainly made our<br/>
relatives think we&#39;re more or less sane for not having our kids in school.<br/>
Ah, how things have changed in the last generation or so. Anyone remember<br/>
that in &quot;Charlotte&#39;s Web&quot;, Avery (Fern&#39;s brother) takes his pop gun on the<br/>
school bus to school with him??<br/>
