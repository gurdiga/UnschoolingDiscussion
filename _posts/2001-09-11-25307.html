&gt; Donating to the Red Cross is one of the few<br/>
&gt; things that we outside NYC and DC can do to help.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t comprehend this tragedy.  I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; comprehend why there was no forewarning.<br/>
&gt; Someday, maybe, we&#39;ll know.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the meantime, thousands of very good people<br/>
&gt; are dead, or terribly hurt. Let&#39;s help them and<br/>
&gt; their families -- I think of all the children who<br/>
&gt; lost their parents today.<br/>
