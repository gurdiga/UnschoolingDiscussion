How did you explain the distinction to her?  My children are also fascinated with taboo words, and while they&#39;re free to say what they want in our own home around our own family, I try to help them understand how important it is to edit their language according to who&#39;s around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373507205">Crap is considered just as foul, if not more so, in South Africa.  And I think the hat thing came in from being bareheaded, and therefore somehow unprotected or something, as a sign of respect.   Sort of along the lines of handshaking evolving from being a shakedown for concealed weapons.  Some of this stuff has documented historical basis; other times it&#39;s just conjecture.  Debi<br/>

<br/>
My first thought was maybe it had something to do with Thomas <br/>
Crapper, being the supposed inventor of the toliet.  <br/>
<br/>
I found this with google:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rotorooter.com/fun_history_1904.html">http://www.rotorooter.com/fun_history_1904.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Interesting anyway.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thomas Crapper<br/>
<br/>
Did Thomas Crapper really invent the toilet? The debate over who <br/>
Thomas Crapper was  or even if there was a Thomas Crapper at all<br/>
 <br/>
continues. Below are some of the facts flushed out by Dr. Andy <br/>
Gibbons, historian of the International Thomas Crapper Society, and <br/>
Ken Grabowski, a researcher and author who is writing a book on <br/>
Crapper&#39;s life. <br/>
<br/>
Myth: Thomas Crapper as a person never existed. <br/>
<br/>
Fact: Though we do not know his actual date of birth, we can say a <br/>
man, Thomas Crapper, was probably born in September, 1836, since he <br/>
was baptized the 28th of that month. He died on January 27, 1910. <br/>
<br/>
Myth: Thomas Crapper invented the toilet. <br/>
<br/>
Fact: Although from 1861 to 1904 Crapper did have a successful career <br/>
in the plumbing industry, holding nine patents for plumbing-related <br/>
products in England, he did not invent the toilet. Albert Giblin <br/>
holds the 1819 British Patent for the Silent Valveless Water Waste <br/>
Preventer, a system that allowed a toilet to flush effectively. <br/>
Giblin worked for Crapper as an employee and the most likely scenario <br/>
is that Crapper bought the patent rights from Giblin and marketed the <br/>
device himself. <br/>
<br/>
Myth: The word crap is derived from Thomas Crapper&#39;s name. <br/>
<br/>
Fact: World War 1 doughboys passing through England saw the words T. <br/>
Crapper Chelsea printed on the water tanks and coined the slang <br/>
crapper meaning toilet</div>
