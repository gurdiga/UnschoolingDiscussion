<div id="ygrps-yiv-996084687">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
my name is Nicoletta and my husband, Fran, and I have four children <br/>
together: three girls currently in public school, ages 13, 11 and 10, <br/>
and a son aged 3. <br/>
<br/>
In the last year or so I have been getting in touch with more and <br/>
more people interested in de-/un-/home- and alternative schooling and <br/>
what I am learning resonates very strongly with me. <br/>
<br/>
Our girls are somewhat interested in the subject, their main concern <br/>
seems to be losing touch with all their friends. Whether or not the <br/>
girls decide to choose a different way of schooling for themselves, I <br/>
would very much like to prepare for our son to have a more natural, <br/>
organic upbringing with regard to learning. <br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to getting to know more people in this &quot;field&quot; <br/>
and sharing my own experiences as we embark on this new adventure.<br/>
<br/>
