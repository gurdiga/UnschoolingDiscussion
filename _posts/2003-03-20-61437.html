since he was about 9. There&#39;s always so much to talk about in those itty <br/>
bitty comics. Fox Trot is pretty cool too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Oh yeah and one of our favorite games.  Word association.  Someone<br/>

&#39;sun&#39; and we continue around the car.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We do this too. Only we added another twist. The object of our game is to <br/>
somehow, after all those odd associations, get back to the original word. <br/>
Casey LOVES that game.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>FoxTrot and Calvin and Hobbes are favorites of my boys too.  They <br/>
recently discovered you can have FoxTrot (and many others) emailed to <br/>
you daily at www.ucomics.com for free.  FoxTrot is now usually our <br/>
part of our breakfast conversation.   The kids get a kick out of the <br/>
school/grades/studying strips.  <br/>
