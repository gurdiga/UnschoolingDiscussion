&lt;&lt; We stayed with the Lovejoys for a couple of nights and felt completely at <br/>
ease, welcomed and all filled up with joy when we left. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Though I did miss the conference, luckily Marty and I didn&#39;t miss getting to <br/>
stay at Kelly&#39;s house.<br/>

It&#39;s a shame that some people spend their time trying to help other families <br/>
be more at peace and live in more freedom, and then once in a while someone <br/>
feels compelled to spend some of THEIR time undermining that.  It&#39;s not worth <br/>
doing, really.<br/>
