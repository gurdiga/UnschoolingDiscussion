** Just so you are not too amazed...I was exhausted too and today we <br/>
completely <br/>
<br/>
zoned out...sat around reading Johnny Tremain and playing games and I for one <br/>
<br/>
 barely made it off the couch until afternoon!<br/>
<br/>
But I do agree that it&#39;s a good exercise every so often (especially when <br/>
<br/>
discouraged) to really take a look at all the &quot;learning&quot; we are doing!<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t wait to read other &quot;typical days.&quot; **<br/>

Your post should have come with a disclaimer in Bold to the effect that while <br/>
this is a &quot;typical&quot; day for your family it&#39;s not what you&#39;d be doing every <br/>
day and &quot;typically&quot; leads to exhaustion and a need for a restorative day. I <br/>
envision some poor newbie mom out there who signed off the list convinced she <br/>
just doesn&#39;t have the stamina to &quot;do unschooling.&quot;  :)<br/>

How about looking at the learning on exhausted, didn&#39;t get off the couch all <br/>
day days? I think when we honestly look at the days where it seems that <br/>
*nothing* is happening and we&#39;ve been guilty of wasting our own and our kid&#39;s <br/>
time, we&#39;ll find that real and important learning was still going on, without <br/>
our directing it and often without our participation. I think it&#39;s valuable <br/>
to look at what is going on as a flow of days, some active, some <br/>
contemplative, some bookish, some sleepy...<br/>
<br/>
Which isn&#39;t to say I didn&#39;t like reading about your day. I did. :) I was just <br/>
chuckling from the first about it being posted under the subject &quot;typical <br/>
unschooling day&quot;. :) <br/>

&gt;I had gotten through that day!<br/>
&gt;So, I guess that was not my typical day...although as my kids grow and pursue <br/>
&gt;different interests, my days definitely are getting busier!<br/>
&gt;Loved your comments-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No!  Boasting!  And about your children too no less!  How bizarre!  LOL  I am sure that we can all use that kind of a feel-good-about-our-acomplishments boost all the time.  Especially when we have non-mainstream lifestyles and take a lot of criticism and negativity because of it.  <br/>
I can&#39;t believe all that you do with 7 kids....I can&#39;t even fathom having 7 kids, I can barely keep up with 2!  Or maybe it just Feels that way some days when the diapers and tanturms are on overload.  I&#39;m sure I would bend with the wind if it blew that way.  Anyway, what I am trying to say in my non-coherent state it:  Hats off to you Carol.  Good Job and keep up the fantastic work and good job to your kids too.  You&#39;re Awesome.<br/>
