<div id="ygrps-yiv-202294994">Hugs to you, Kathleen!  How have you been?  It was so nice seeing your name in my Always Learning folder.  How are the kids?  How&#39;s your husband?  How are you?  Do you have your nursing degree yet?  Or are you working toward and NA?  I don&#39;t remember, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
I miss you!  I never check Montana Unschoolers anymore, but I miss the people.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of love to you, sorry this is so brief.<br/>
Love love love,<br/>
Nichole<br/>

  &gt; That might make you feel better.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; -=-They play Halo 2 online as often as they are able.-=-<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; My boys played it a LOT when it was new, and now my daughter is <br/>
  pretty <br/>
  &gt; involved in it, mostly for the social aspect.  She&#39;s made friends <br/>
  in several <br/>
  &gt; countries.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; -=-They complain that I&#39;ve not taught them to spell and yet they <br/>
  do very <br/>
  &gt; little if any <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; reading.-=-<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I didn&#39;t teach mine to spell, they didn&#39;t do a lot of reading, and <br/>
  from <br/>
  &gt; instant messages and e-mails and reading the cards for collectible <br/>
  card games and <br/>
  &gt; the instructions for games they&#39;ve learned to spell and write.   <br/>
  Halo II isnt&#39; <br/>
  &gt; the best for that, as it&#39;s done vocally.  There are other X-Box <br/>
  games that do <br/>
  &gt; involve a lot of reading. My boys are asleep so I can&#39;t ask the <br/>
  names, but the <br/>
  &gt; Star Wars games, I know, are largely text-based, and Morrowwind is <br/>
  a <br/>
  &gt; BEAUTIFUL game Marty played for a long time when it was new.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; -=- My house is full of books-=-<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Mine too.<br/>
  &gt; Read here to feel better about that.<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; -=-About 6 years ago we moved and took the kids out of school and <br/>
  have been <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; somewhat unschooling. . .-=-<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I think &quot;somewhat unschooling&quot; would be really frustrating.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m sorry about your stillbirth and your son&#39;s death.  The stress <br/>
  and grief <br/>
  &gt; couldn&#39;t have been good for the other kids, either.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; We can help you get to all-the-way unschooling, at least for your <br/>
  younger <br/>
  &gt; kids, maybe, if you want.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; You  might have already found this stuff, but I&#39;m a collector and <br/>
  I keep <br/>
  &gt; adding to this site:<br/>
