<div id="ygrps-yiv-263426012">Reptiles generally don&#39;t need to eat all that much, since they&#39;re cold <br/>
blooded.  We used to feed my snake once every 3 weeks and he did fine.  So, <br/>
he may not be very hungry.  Often a pet store with some exotics will have <br/>
some good ideas.  Can you figure out what kind he is from a field guide or <br/>
something?  <br/>

 Try going to the local pet shop and buying crickets....the lizards we have <br/>
had love them. Good luck.<br/>
