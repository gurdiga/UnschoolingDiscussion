&lt;&lt; You must have missed the part where I said that I was a mathematician <br/>
<br/>
in a past life. I happen to know how important math is in the grand <br/>
<br/>
scheme of the universe, thank you very much, and I&#39;m well aware of <br/>
<br/>
the country&#39;s reasonings behind making sure kids do their higher-<br/>
<br/>
level math. ;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Guys, guys, guys, PLEASE don&#39;t bog the discussions down in assumptions that <br/>
people are carrying on dialogs.  These discussions are intended to be general, <br/>
about the ideas, not about the individuals nor about the individual posts.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce is talking about cold war realities and WHY the school push algebra, <br/>
which had this big after-effect of homeschooling parents in 2003 having a vague <br/>
terror inside about what if their kids don&#39;t know algebra.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s so helpful to the letting go process to understand why schools do<br/>
things the way they do. Why they use textbooks. Why they progress linearly<br/>
through subjects. Why they have subjects. Why they emphasize reading.<br/>
<br/>
And none of it is because it&#39;s best for kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Um, Sandra, didn&#39;t you notice that I put a winky at the end of my <br/>
rant to her, and that Joyce and I in subsequent posts related to <br/>
eachother that we knew we were both JOKING??? I knew what she was <br/>
saying, and I think that she knew what I was saying as well, we <br/>
didn&#39;t ask for an interpretor...<br/>
<br/>
(Or maybe you did later see that, I dunno, I&#39;m SO far behind on <br/>
reading messages and we&#39;re leaving on vacation tomorrow and...ARGH!)<br/>

supposed to be for everyone involved, not just between two people.  EVERYONE <br/>
might not have known what you were saying, and it didn&#39;t sound at all like <br/>
joking to me.   <br/>
<br/>
The better you use English, the more people you can communicate with.<br/>

about something in one of your columns or a question about a <br/>
conference you&#39;re going to be at or whatever, that doesn&#39;t belong on <br/>
this list either, they can just email you privately for that right??? <br/>
Maybe I could care less about such things, so does that give me the <br/>
right to say that it doesn&#39;t belong on the list?<br/>

moments where only one or two people may briefly share a thought or a <br/>
joke or a piece of person-specific info with eachother. So what??<br/>

<br/>
If their question and my response could be of interest to other unschoolers, <br/>
this is a GREAT place for them.  If what I write to them is personal to them <br/>
and I don&#39;t want any interpretations or comments, I&#39;ll write to them privately.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe I could care less about such things, so does that give me the <br/>

<br/>
Why are you so determined to defend a lame position?<br/>
