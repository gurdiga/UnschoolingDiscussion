work on.  That is more work than most people ever put into their family.  It <br/>
takes a lot to recognize you are wrong and admit it and work on it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209656719">What a beautiful post.  It takes such a tremendous amount of courage to <br/>
admit our faults and seek a better way.  I well know that it is often easier <br/>
to take the low road, the road well traveled.  Those programmed thoughts and <br/>
reactions ARE so hard to get rid of.  The best thing you could have done for <br/>
yourself and your children is admit your weaknesses and seek new ways.  The <br/>
hard part is changing overnight.  I&#39;ve been there.  I AM there.  Blessings <br/>
to you and your family!<br/>
