<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He said he thought maybe so.  That when kids have eaten &quot;too much&quot; sugar (by<br/>
&gt; the parents&#39; reckoning) that the parents LOOK for any &quot;bad behavior&quot; to prove<br/>
&gt; that it was too much.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think that in a season when parents have changed rules and it seems like a<br/>
&gt; holiday or something very new and different, that that alone might be enough<br/>
&gt; to excite them.   Any freedom a usually-limited kid gets is going to be<br/>
&gt; stimulating and exciting.  Maybe that is what causes the heightened mood.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is certainly my experience.  We go through regular changes around here<br/>
with Dad home, Dad home plus holidays, and Dad gone, and I see different<br/>
behaviours that come with eat &quot;season&quot;.  Some are good things, some are more<br/>
problematic. <br/>
<br/>
In particular to Rebecca&#39;s issue, I see a couple of things: it&#39;s been 4<br/>
months that have included Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years.<br/>
Not the calmest 4 months of the year!  Furthermore, changing the rules and<br/>
living calmly inside those new changes is one thing, but when outsiders like<br/>
grandparents and all make a big fuss that &quot;WOW, you can have CANDY&quot;, it&#39;s<br/>
suddenly a much bigger thing.  You might ask them to tame it down a bit, and<br/>
make sure they&#39;re not treating candy like it&#39;s anything more than another<br/>
food.  <br/>
<br/>
I bought two huge toblerone bars (400 grams each) at the after-holidays sale<br/>
a couple weeks ago.  One was unwrapped so we could admire its size, and both<br/>
Tim and I ate a piece.  That&#39;s all that&#39;s happened, and I&#39;ve always had a<br/>
huge sweet tooth.  But now that I&#39;ve stopped torturing myself about it and<br/>
eating candy when I want it, I don&#39;t want it often.  I just gave a way a<br/>
bunch of cookies that were going stale.  The neighbor kids think I&#39;m<br/>
wonderful now.  ;)<br/>
