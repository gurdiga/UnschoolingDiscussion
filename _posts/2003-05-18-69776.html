just so he knows that some people do believe it.<br/>

difficult age even with the easiest-going of kids. So, first, take a lot of<br/>
deep breaths. <br/>

It IS really hard to parent a perfectionist child. You watch them make<br/>
things so much harder on themselves than they need to be. So far what I&#39;ve<br/>
learned is to listen sympathetically, to mirror back their feelings, to<br/>
offer some suggestions (but NOT take it personally when they&#39;re shot down)<br/>
and to trust that they&#39;re doing what they need to. I try to talk about<br/>
situations with Quinn after the intense feelings about them are over.<br/>

&gt; activities put on their products and things like that.  I&#39;m having<br/>
&gt; difficulty explaining that it&#39;s all arbitrary, but DS is taking it<br/>
&gt; literally and seems to be really focusing on these labels.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let him experience for himself the silliness of it all. Just get whatever<br/>
materials he wants at whatever levels and get other things yourself for him<br/>
that you think he might enjoy; he&#39;ll get soon enough that they make no<br/>
sense. <br/>
