<div id="ygrps-yiv-730804819">Hi! I wanted to share a piece from an article in the June issue of <br/>
Reader&#39;s Digest. The article is all about survival techniques you <br/>
need if you were to get lost in the woods.  I couldn&#39;t help but see <br/>
this from an unschooling frame of mind, if you know what I mean :-)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;One great riddle of survival is why some people live while others, <br/>
often facing less difficult conditions, die.  Surprisingly, Hill <br/>
says &quot;one of the highest survival rates is for children six and <br/>
under.&quot;<br/>
The reason may lie in some basic childhood traits: Small children do <br/>
not create complex mental maps; they don&#39;t run to get somewhere <br/>
beyond their field of vision.  They also follow their instincts.  If <br/>
it gets cold, they&#39;ll crawl into a hollow tree to get warm.  If <br/>
they&#39;re thirsty, they drink.  Making themselves comfortable helps <br/>
keep them alive.<br/>
Children ages 7 to 12, on the other hand, behave much like adults: <br/>
They panic & run.  If the trail peters out, they keep going, ignoring <br/>
thirst, hunger & cold, until they fall over.  they suppress the very <br/>
instincts that might help them to survive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that the &quot;school age&quot; children are the ones to <br/>
deny their instincts,hmmm...wonder why?<br/>
