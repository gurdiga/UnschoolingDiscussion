<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316918363">Here in NC we have to test every year, and just have them &quot;on file&quot;.  I don&#39;t<br/>
even want to do that!  I know my son is learning so much, but since we live on a<br/>
farm most of it is not book learning.  And besides who cares?  As long as he<br/>
knows what he needs to know in order to fulfill his dreams that&#39;s fine with me,<br/>
:)<br/>
I&#39;m planning on buying the tests, and then just doing them together.  I think he<br/>
will understand that we have to have them in our file just so we can continue to<br/>
stay home.  He is a very philosophical child at 6!<br/>

&gt; I just finished reading all the intros and now here is mine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My name is Claudia I live in Kansas with my husband and 4yr old daughter,<br/>
&gt; We decided to homeschool Victoria when she was still very young.  I love<br/>
&gt; to do research and so after we decided I set about reading as much as I<br/>
&gt; could about homeschooling<br/>
&gt; and that is how we ended up becoming unschoolers.  I am now reading John<br/>
&gt; Holts books and they<br/>
&gt; just reinforce everything I knew in my heart and logical mind.  I still have<br/>
&gt; the problem with testing or not<br/>
&gt; testing, I really like feedback and I still have the public school instilled<br/>
&gt; need for knowing if she is learning<br/>
&gt; I fight my urge to test her even informally.  And everyonce and awhile she<br/>
&gt; will surprise me by knowing something I was sure she didn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; I am so glad there is this list and site I don&#39;t know any unschooler in my<br/>
&gt; area everyone seems or school at home.  and I just love getting email!!!!<br/>
