<div id="ygrps-yiv-656657897">Maybe just to say &quot;usually we eat dinner together&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;usually the kids take a shower every day or two&quot;<br/>
makes it still true but not sound like an unbending requirement.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby showers every day unless he&#39;s not going to work or karate.  Sometimes <br/>
(once every two or three weeks) he&#39;ll skip a day.  I never made him do that.  <br/>
I&#39;m glad he does! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly went a week this winter just because she never had before.  She had no <br/>
classes that week (she takes fiddle classes, acting and modelling, usually) <br/>
and just didn&#39;t shower.  She was interested in the state of her hair.  She <br/>
was fascinated.    Now she&#39;s back to every other day or more.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is about every other day, depending on activity or appointments.<br/>
<br/>
So I say &quot;usually&quot; but I don&#39;t say the routine is, because it wasn&#39;t planned <br/>
or imposed.<br/>
It&#39;s a subtle difference, but subtle differences are real.<br/>
