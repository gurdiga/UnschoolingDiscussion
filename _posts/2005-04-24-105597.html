<div id="ygrps-yiv-976829325">Marty just said, &quot;Hey, did you know google has a calculator?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah, if you put in a math question, it will give you a calculator.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Like if you put in numbers and symbols?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said yeah, but then he said he had written &quot;how many feet are in a mile&quot; <br/>
and it gave him the answer and a link to a calculator and some other stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Had he memorized how many feet were in a mile, he&#39;d&#39;ve never found that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
