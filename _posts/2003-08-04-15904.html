<br/>
True.  And the story wasn&#39;t about me riskig my kids.  That was Quite  off the <br/>
wall, wasn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Police had been to that house twice before (that I know of) for domestic <br/>
violence.  It was a rental house; we owned.  their other three  neighbors were <br/>
widows who had been in those houses for a really long time, and their peace was <br/>
being disturbed by a macho dork.  If anyone stood to lose a child over child <br/>
welfare issues, it was this family with the cop car so often out front.<br/>
<br/>
I could have just called the police, but they seemed clearly ot to be <br/>
tooconcerned about police visits.<br/>
<br/>
After the day I went there, I  never heard them have another fight, but I did <br/>
see a police car there once a few months later.  I hope she called before the <br/>
yelling even got going.  I was really angry that morning, and came back and <br/>
called Keith and asked him to come home and talk to the guy which he did, in a <br/>
calm guy-way, as they leaned on Keith&#39;s big pickup (from which the next year <br/>
the neighbor borrowed the spare so they could move &lt;g&gt;).  I hope her little boy <br/>
grew up okay.  He&#39;s 15 or 16  now.<br/>

right now, I also understand the frustration of not wanting to wait around <br/>
for the cops, but really, it&#39;s usually a wise policy!  (Once in awhile a <br/>
neighbor will ask me to call the cops on someone so she&#39;s not the ONLY one calling, <br/>
and I try to oblige.)  <br/>
