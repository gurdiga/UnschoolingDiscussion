<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749224272"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have to agree that the poster should not have taken the kids off their<br/>
&gt;meds. Their beliefs about the need for them is irrelevant, as is the danger<br/>
&gt;of taking tehm off cold turkey.<br/>
&gt;I firmly believe that I have many rights as a parent, which can be summed up<br/>
&gt;briefly as the right to do what I think is best for my children. In my<br/>
&gt;opinion, what is best for them is out of hospital births, breastfeeding,<br/>
&gt;encouraging questions, unschooling, etc. If ANY one, relative or not, were<br/>
&gt;to do something contrary to the choices we made, behind my back and without<br/>
&gt;asking, they would never be trusted again to be with my children<br/>
&gt;unsupervised.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are to be commended for such an attitude.  However, that wasn&#39;t an<br/>
issue in this case.  While my sister wanted us to drug her children, we<br/>
made it clear that we would not take them if that was a condition; that she<br/>
could suggest it if she wished but that our intention was that it would be<br/>
a drug-free week.  She didn&#39;t like it, but if she wished for them not to go<br/>
under those conditions, she was free to keep them home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yes, I agree with many here who say Ritalin is overprescribed and that ADD<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t apply in an unschooling life. Again, to me those things were<br/>
&gt;irrelevant. WHat really bothered me was someone deliberately violated a<br/>
&gt;parent&#39;s wishes and decisions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As explained, untrue.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;PS&gt; My disagreement wasn&#39;t personal, as I don&#39;t know the original poster and<br/>
&gt;can&#39;t remember her name.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;His&quot;.  And my name is Marc, and I don&#39;t take them personally.  Nor am I<br/>
intending these replies personally, which is why I usually strip out the<br/>
name of the person to whom I am responding.  I am discussing the points,<br/>
not the poster.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From another post...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I am not a health food nut, but if my kids stay with friends who are, they <br/>
&gt;eat what that other family is eating.   I don&#39;t take my kids to church, but <br/>
&gt;when other people have, I haven&#39;t made a big deal, because the kids can say <br/>
&gt;no if they really don&#39;t want to go.   Even if someone took Holly and marched <br/>
&gt;her through a full week of Vacation Bible School and Baptist-life to try to <br/>
&gt;convince her that she had to be born again, I could be calm about that, <br/>
&gt;because Holly knows enough to be analytical and is not easily led.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is one of the best attitudes you can have with children -- you do the<br/>
best you can with them, allow them to make their own choices, and bear<br/>
responsibility for those choices -- since that&#39;s what&#39;s going to happen<br/>
ANYWAY.  Besides, the best way for them to see what they like (or not) of<br/>
their own lifestyle is to allow them to sample the lifestyles of others.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons we pick up my nephews on occassion is to allow them to<br/>
live in an environment free of drugging, verbal and physical abuse, and the<br/>
other problems of their existence that they are forced to live with EVERY<br/>
DAY, and maybe show them that life doesn&#39;t have to be that bad all the<br/>
time.  They may choose to change their situations or attitudes later in<br/>
life because of that taste of life from &quot;the other side&quot;, or not.  But we<br/>
felt it was important to give them that taste.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We allow TV watching at our house, and video games.  I would NOT even begin <br/>
&gt;to agree to keep someone else&#39;s child for a week (nephews, neighbors, <br/>
&gt;friends) on the parents&#39; terms if they were to say &quot;Don&#39;t let him watch TV&quot; <br/>
&gt;or &quot;Make him go to bed at 9:00&quot; or &quot;If he says a bad word he has to be <br/>
&gt;spanked.&quot;   They can keep him themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just as an aside, we&#39;re avid fans of no television.  By the same token, one<br/>
of our family friends had their boy spend a weekend with us -- and they<br/>
knew in advance that there was no TV available.  They have the courtesy to<br/>
not demand that we go out and buy a TV for their kid to watch.  A year<br/>
later, their child STILL talks of all the things we did with him that<br/>
weekend -- which I doubt one could say about any video game or TV show the<br/>
youngster watched a year ago.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And if a family drugs their child even when he&#39;s home because a doctor said <br/>
&gt;it was a good idea, if his being drugged daily is crucial to their peace of <br/>
&gt;mind, they should keep him with them ever moment, because not all people are <br/>
&gt;willing to give children stupifying drugs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, now, that certainly describes me.  As far as I am concerned, drugging<br/>
children in most cases I consider to be abusive, just as making that child<br/>
swallow a cupful of hard liquor would be (interestingly, the result is<br/>
about the same -- lethargy, lack of initiative, etc).  There are precious<br/>
few children who TRULY need ANY sort of psychoactive &quot;medication&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Some time, I&#39;m going to post the transcript of a conversation we had once<br/>
with the younger nephew, when we asked him if he knew WHY he was on drugs.<br/>
It was an excruciatingly sad conversation, which I am certain that could<br/>
have been repeated with a couple of million other young, innocent boys.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;From yet another message:<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt; Don&#39;t you realize that when children have been on medication, that they <br/>
&gt; cannot<br/>
&gt; go COLD TURKEY??? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You can with Ritalin.<br/>
&gt;In fact, many, many parents are advised to only give it to them during the <br/>
&gt;school week and leave them off it on the weekends. Seems like a big HUGE, <br/>
&gt;in-your-face way of saying they only need to be drugged to keep them zombies <br/>
&gt;while in school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jeez, now THAT sums it up very well!  Thank you thank you thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-391268537"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Needless to say, I did not like what she was willingly doing to her<br/>
&gt;&gt; innocent little boys.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; My wife and I took them on a week&#39;s vacation, and we swore that they would<br/>
&gt;&gt; be going cold-turkey off of those chemicals.  For a week, they didn&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;&gt; Pill One.  We marched their little butts all over creation and back, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; didn&#39;t slow down a bit to wait for them, so they HAD to keep up<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Don&#39;t you realize that when children have been on medication, that they <br/>
&gt;cannot<br/>
&gt;go COLD TURKEY??? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, please remember some Netiquette.  The strident tone, as<br/>
indicated with the multiple punctuation and caps (to indicate &quot;shouting&quot; as<br/>
opposed to simple emphasis) is unecessary.  Their usage undermines your<br/>
point, by indicating it&#39;s an emotionalized reply rather than a logical one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You are very fortunate that these two boys didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;experience<br/>
&gt;withdrawl, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Were you a physician, I could not patronize you if you had that little<br/>
information.  My wife IS a physician, and while I am not any longer in any<br/>
health-care field, I have some experience with the effects of substance<br/>
abuse, and I know what I am speaking of.<br/>
<br/>
Ritalin is related to several other abused substances and has similar<br/>
characteristics.  &quot;Withdrawal&quot; is not among the dangers of the drug. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and may I remind you that you took a very BIG chance in doing <br/>
&gt;this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope.  That is incorrect.  Leaving these boys ON Ritalin is more dangerous<br/>
than taking them off.  You may wish to read the list of side effects of the<br/>
drug, if you doubt.  Those side effects are the main reason kids who are<br/>
given Ritalin or its substitutes are often later given additional dangerous<br/>
chemicals; a veritable cocktail of substances -- each of which is supposed<br/>
to counteract the side effects of the previously administered drug.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Please anyone that reads this letter please be aware that cold turkey is <br/>
&gt;wrong<br/>
&gt;even if it involves you as an adult. These medications alter the chemicals in<br/>
&gt;the body, and are there for a purpose and by no means are gone and out of<br/>
&gt;the system within a week. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anyone who reads my original letter should also be aware that taking their<br/>
child off of Ritalin and any other psychoactive drug cocktails they have<br/>
their kids on is a GOOD choice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think you better investigate medications and<br/>
&gt;withdrawl before you take a chance like this again, especially with some<br/>
&gt;one elses children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You may wish to do the same; I have already done so.  <br/>
<br/>
I must admit, I&#39;m just a little astounded by the lack of accurate<br/>
information people have received about these dangerous drugs.  You mistrust<br/>
the school system enough to get your kids away from it, but when it comes<br/>
to the ill-advised mass medicating the school system has made &quot;standard<br/>
operating procedure&quot;, some of you seem to have fallen for the bureaucrats&#39;<br/>
&quot;wisdom&quot;.  Unfortunate, at best.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll say it again: Just Say No to drugs.  Your child does NOT need<br/>
psychoactive substances.  They are DANGEROUS and unnecessary.  Get them<br/>
away from them for all the same reasons you got them away from the schools.<br/>

I was a child that lived with verbal and physical abuse that was due <br/>
to my father&#39;s use of alcohol and my mother&#39;s inability to stop <br/>
him.  I prayed every night for them to divorce or to just leave me <br/>
alone.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if my grandparents knew about the abuse, but they made <br/>
all the difference in my life.  Their house was a calm and loving <br/>
place where I could relax.  Those brief visits gave me hope and kept <br/>
me from suicide or insanity. I commend you efforts.  I am sure that <br/>

realised that what I considered to be a normal environment was indeed far<br/>
from it. It took me a very long time to to gain a balance of what &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
was like. Abuse in childhood has so many far more reaching consequenses. One<br/>
example would be that my boundaries would be so weak that I would take crap<br/>
over and over again thinking it was normal and then explode out of control<br/>
when I couldn&#39;t take it any longer. It has been a huge learning curve to<br/>
acknowledge my own true feelings, having trust in them and to respond<br/>
appropriately - meaning when the situation first happens instead of weeks or<br/>
months later after continual episodes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I can totally relate to this.  It is always reassuring to hear that<br/>
I&#39;m not the only one.  It has been very hard for me to become more &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
(not that most people would consider me normal on any given day.....!), but<br/>
you know what I mean.  Things that seem so normal to me, I know are not, and<br/>
I have to stop and think rather than react.  My husband grew up with<br/>
wonderful parenting, and it seems to be easier for him to be a good parent.<br/>
He has examples to look to.  Unschooling helps with this so much.  I think<br/>
it&#39;s because it&#39;s a whole different path than the one I took, so I don&#39;t<br/>
have skewed ideas about how it looked for me.  Does that make any sense?<br/>
