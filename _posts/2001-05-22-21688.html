<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353757496">Hello!  My name is Sherry and I am an unschooling &lt;ahem&gt;  or is it <br/>
homeschooling mother of three in New Jersey.  We brought our oldest <br/>
child home to &#39;school&#39;  after he completed second grade in public <br/>
school.  That was June 1998 and I still struggle <br/>
with &#39;UN&#39;schooling...  I truly believe, in my heart and soul, that <br/>
children learn best when they are interested and passionate about <br/>
something and yet I occasionally backslide and panic, give him a very <br/>
small and simple handwriting assignment to be sure he is actually <br/>
learning.  It&#39;s pathetic!  LOL!  I think I still need to DEschool.<br/>

I&#39;m happy to have found this email list and look forward to <br/>
networking with you.   : )</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-311800586">Welcome Sherry!  You sound like me.  I am guilty<br/>
of the same thing!!  I try not to, but every now<br/>
and then I just gotta see something on paper. <br/>
Like you said: I need to be de-schooled too!<br/>
Anyway, welcome to the list, look forward to<br/>
sharing with you! :-)<br/>
