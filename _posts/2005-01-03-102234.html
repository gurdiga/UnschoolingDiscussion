<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054622394">What I see people being concerned with is a<br/>
hypothetical newbie-or-potential unschooler coming to<br/>
the list (or another list, or an unschooling group<br/>
support meeting) with the urgent question, &quot;But how on<br/>
earth do they learn geography (science, history,<br/>
etc.)?&quot; -- which we all know happens all the time. And<br/>
then not reading very closely, or listening very hard,<br/>
and staying around for about five minutes, and somehow<br/>
just remembering vaguely that someone said something<br/>
about putting up a map or getting a microscope. And<br/>
then deciding that that&#39;s what unschooling is -- you<br/>
&quot;teach&quot; geography by putting up a map, which magically<br/>
results in your child being able to identify the major<br/>
rivers of the world and the imports and exports of<br/>
Brazil. And then putting up a map, leaving it there<br/>
and saying nothing about it, not using it herself, and<br/>
a month later realizing indignantly that not only do<br/>
the kids appear not to have noticed it, they still<br/>
can&#39;t find their own state on the map and don&#39;t know<br/>
what hemisphere Asia is in. Which means unschooling<br/>
has failed and they need a curriculum, or at least a<br/>
lot more &quot;structure.&quot; And they go all over ridiculing<br/>
unschooling and telling everyone that unschoolers<br/>
don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about and their kids<br/>
are all ignoramuses.<br/>
<br/>
Do I think this is a ridiculous fear and that this <br/>
could never happen? No, of course not. I think it<br/>
happens all the time. Most people don&#39;t get<br/>
unschooling<br/>
even if they try, or think they&#39;ve tried. Most people<br/>
don&#39;t think very hard, or read very carefully. In my<br/>
opinion. They fall back on convention and popular<br/>
opinion because it&#39;s the easiest thing to do and it<br/>
makes their brain hurt to think anything too out of<br/>
the ordinary.<br/>
<br/>
I know. I&#39;ve done it.<br/>
<br/>
So I do understand the concerns, because I think we<br/>
encounter people like this all the time -- the people<br/>
who say, &quot;Well, my son never asked me to teach him<br/>
analytic geometry, no matter how many pattern blocks I<br/>
left on the coffee table, so I decided to stop<br/>
unschooling&quot; or &quot;We could never be unschoolers because<br/>
the kids never want to learn anything -- they just<br/>
have fun all day&quot; (auugghhhh!). The thing is, I don&#39;t<br/>
think you can blame strewing, or the people who<br/>
advocate strewing, for the misunderstanding of all<br/>
those people. Certainly on this list, I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
how anyone who reads with their brain engaged for more<br/>
than a few days could actually come away with the<br/>
impression that unschooling was just about changing<br/>
your &quot;teaching style&quot; (i.e., throwing away the<br/>
mandatory geography workbooks and putting up maps)<br/>
rather than your whole attitude toward education<br/>
(i.e., geography is just part of life and the world,<br/>
and in a rich, supportive environment kids will<br/>
naturally and easily learn all they need or want to<br/>
know about it). And if they do come away with that<br/>
impression (I&#39;m absolutely positive there are people<br/>
who do) they would have anyway, whether anyone talked<br/>
about strewing or not. <br/>
<br/>
Strewing is about *creating* that rich, supportive<br/>
environment that makes learning fun and effortless,<br/>
not about being a new and improved technique for<br/>
inserting unwanted information into the brains of the<br/>
unwilling.<br/>
<br/>
That there are people who may misinterpret the term<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it any less valuable to do it, just as<br/>
the fact that there are people who read the word<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; as meaning &quot;neglect&quot; doesn&#39;t mean we<br/>
should abandon the term, or the lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
having said all that . . . <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  I truly believe that the people who will succeed at <br/>
understanding unschooling are the people who for whatever reason <br/>
really *want* to understand it.  I have a friend, a former <br/>
homeschooler, who &quot;tried&quot; unschooling briefly.  The only problem was <br/>
that she fully expected her kids to just naturally keep up to grade <br/>
level of their own volition.  I also remember her bringing the kids <br/>
to the library so they could pick their own topics to *study* and <br/>
being almost insulted that they didn&#39;t want to study *anything*.  <br/>
When I tried to talk to her more about the philosophy behind it her <br/>
eyes would practically glaze over.  The fact was she didn&#39;t really <br/>
*want* to get it, she just wanted to take an easier road to the same <br/>
destination (grade level).  When she realized that no such road <br/>
existed and she had to change her goals as well for unschooling to <br/>
work, she went back to school at home, and then shortly after that <br/>
put her kids back in school.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that the people who will succeed at understanding <br/>
unschooling are the people who for whatever reason really *want* to <br/>
understand it.  And those people will continue reading and thinking <br/>
well past the point where they could possibly have the idea <br/>
that &quot;learning as a by-product of a busy joyful life&quot; means that <br/>
parents need not do anything but watch soap operas.<br/>

Just pointing out that some of us have now been told that something we <br/>

I said that I am right now in the middle of reading &quot;1984&quot; and the <br/>

How is it that negative words like &quot;manipulative,&quot; &quot;disrespectful, &quot; <br/>

feedback while a plain, simple &quot;Wow. Amazing how that works both ways.&quot; <br/>
that was honestly pointing out without negative words or punctuation <br/>
that the exact same thing that was being accused was also being <br/>
perpetrated by the accuser in that exact same post: &quot;Maybe including the <br/>
full quote will help, rather than just a snippet taken out of context:&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously. This is the second time you&#39;ve expressed your ire over my <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think strewing (as in creating a rich environment) has been <br/>
said even one time by anyone to be an evil practice.  On the <br/>
contrary, I see agreement that it&#39;s an important part of unschooling.<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean by hesitant... hesistant to unschool?  <br/>
Hesitant to act on their own fears and insecurities without <br/>
examining them more closely?  <br/>
Those handwriting workbooks I told about in another post... I was a <br/>
twinge disappointed when they lost interest. It was about me, not <br/>
about them.  Now and then I want to pull them out and <br/>
suggest/encourage their use, thereby making them More Important than <br/>
whatever else they&#39;re spending time on.   I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad <br/>
thing that I&#39;m hesitant to do that. <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes my old fears about too much tv re-surface (like on a day <br/>
that it&#39;s on more than usual) and I have an urge to just turn it <br/>
off.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad thing that I&#39;m hesitant to do that. <br/>
Sometimes hesitating gives us the space to reflect and make a better <br/>
decision. <br/>

&gt; &gt; This is just weird. I haven&#39;t seen any accusations or<br/>
&gt; &gt; name-calling or rudeness or anything except honest,<br/>
&gt; &gt; abstract discussions of a very interesting issue. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; happen to think the qualms about strewing are<br/>
&gt; &gt; misguided too, but I think they&#39;re well-intentioned<br/>
&gt; &gt; and not personal at all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;All this seems so contrived to me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot; I&#39;d feel I was being disrespectful and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if my <br/>
&gt; kids chose to have no interest in such an underhanded affair.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;To me, it&#39;s contrived, manipulating and disrespectful- all <br/>
&gt; antithetical to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;And that seems manipulative to me.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;How is this not trying to manipulate a child?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think I&#39;d fault anyone, but I wouldn&#39;t consider it <br/>
&gt; unschooling, either.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;.. it isn&#39;t very unschool-ish either because it underhanded and <br/>
&gt; manipulative.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think people were saying that strewing *as it is practiced by<br/>
the people participating in this discussion* is manipulative,<br/>
underhanded, disrespectful, etc. I.e., it wasn&#39;t a personal attack. It<br/>
was a warning, or maybe just a question, about how it could be<br/>
unfortunate *if* someone who was new to unschooling or didn&#39;t<br/>
understand it very well saw strewing as a way to achieve specific<br/>
academic goals and got all anxious and pressured their kids if they<br/>
didn&#39;t see that specific academic learning taking place.<br/>
<br/>
I was saying that I think they&#39;re right that that could and does<br/>
happen, but it isn&#39;t the fault of anyone on this list and we shouldn&#39;t<br/>
worry about it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Yes.  I truly believe that the people who will succeed at <br/>
<br/>
understanding unschooling are the people who for whatever reason <br/>
<br/>
really *want* to understand it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, because they had a reason to need to do it?<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The people who learn how unschooling works will be those who had a reason to <br/>
want to learn it, and found information on their own, and applied it on their <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
And it might be worth reminding *them* sometimes that they learned about <br/>
unschooling the same way their kids can learn about something they need to know <br/>
someday.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-The fact was she didn&#39;t really <br/>
<br/>
*want* to get it, she just wanted to take an easier road to the same <br/>
<br/>
destination (grade level).  When she realized that no such road <br/>
<br/>
existed and she had to change her goals as well for unschooling to <br/>
<br/>
work, she went back to school at home, and then shortly after that <br/>
<br/>
put her kids back in school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Those stories are sad.<br/>
Bummer you couldn&#39;t have at least gotten her to try strewing for a while.   <br/>
She might&#39;ve found them picking things up naturally.  But probably not without <br/>
months of deschooling, since their days at home were not time off school.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder (changing the subject, I think) whether families that severely <br/>
school at home would require MORE than a month per year prescription to recover?  <br/>
Those poor kids probably didn&#39;t even have summers off.    If a school year <br/>
(U.S. typical) is 180 days with 185 days of holiday and weekends, do school at <br/>
home kids really get 185 days out of school?  Where do they go?<br/>
<br/>
Poor kids.<br/>

***I think I&#39;m also having a problem with strewing.  It seems to me<br/>
people are talking about strewing items to catch the interest of a<br/>
child so that they might learn something new.  If I bring home<br/>
anything that would interest a family member, whether it&#39;s something<br/>
they&#39;re interested in now or not, I tell them.  If I bring home items<br/>
I know they&#39;re not interested in but hope that they will be, that&#39;s<br/>
my issue.  I&#39;d feel I was being disrespectful and I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>

I guess you must missed it.<br/>

Strewing as leaving something without comment was thrashed needlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Explora, that science museum would not work as it does if each child were <br/>
interviewed at the beginning and then assigned to those things in which he had <br/>
demonstrated an interest.  And if at each table there were detailed instructions <br/>
and a thorough explanation of what should happen, and why, and what <br/>
particular scientific principle was being demonstrated, it wouldn&#39;t be the wonderland <br/>

<br/>
Hesitant to act on their own fears and insecurities without <br/>

<br/>
Hesitant to put a map on the wall because they read one time that it&#39;s <br/>

=========<br/>
Hesitation isn&#39;t drastic.<br/>
Hesitation is a slowing down of a natural process that could be zipping along <br/>
if people were telling what&#39;s good about strewing and learning instead of <br/>
what the alleged dangers and evils are.<br/>
