<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We get stopped everywhere we go so people can comment on her hair.<br/>
&gt; Does any one else get that?  And since dh, ds and myself are dark haired<br/>
&gt; they all ask here it came from.  Now we just say it&#39;s the luck of the<br/>
&gt; Irish!  (For those who just don&#39;t get the whole gene idea.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s astonishing how many people don&#39;t get the gene idea.   We both have<br/>
brown hair, too.  My husband used to quote them a Clairol number for awhile!<br/>
And of course then people have to tell me all about their grandkids<br/>
(neighbors, friends, nieces, whatever) who have red hair, TOO!  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Tim was about 4, he went through a phase of answering that question,<br/>
&quot;God&quot;, with a really &quot;well, duh&quot; sound to his voice.  He still hates the<br/>
question, but tends to just ignore it these days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866941602">My ds --who has dark hair like dh and me -- seems mored annoyed at the<br/>
questions than the red head!  One day he finally said &quot;Why do they keep<br/>
asking about her RED hair -- it isn&#39;t even red it&#39;s ORANGE!!&quot;  <br/>
But it will make for a good genetic discussion when they are a bit<br/>
older.  :)  Then they can explain it to the people in the supermarkets!!<br/>
