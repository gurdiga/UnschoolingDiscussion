<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731455509">Hi to all,<br/>
<br/>
How much time do most of you spend actually doing specific activites <br/>
with your kids.  I have this fear that if I just let them do what <br/>
they want, I will be missing out on all those teachable moments.  I <br/>
am still having trouble translating all this into life.  I always <br/>
feel like I should be reading to them, taking them places, playing <br/>
games?  I am not sure how much *me* time or their *own* time they <br/>
need.  My kids are pretty independent and play well together, so <br/>
sometimes I feel like it is too easy to not be an active  *part* of <br/>
their day.  Should I be making an effort to get more involved or let <br/>
them be??<br/>
<br/>
Olga :)<br/>
Thanks</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757417773">I don&#39;t really have an answer for the amount of time, per say.  My kids do <br/>
the same thing and there are days when I feel like the only time I see them <br/>
is when they are hungry, dirty or sleepy. &lt;g&gt;  Actually, there are a lot of <br/>
those days.   Here&#39;s what works for us...<br/>
<br/>
I try to pay attention to what they are interested in.  My oldest loves <br/>
skater-type stuff, so I&#39;ll pick up the latest Transworld Skateboarding <br/>
magazine when I&#39;m out.  Without any further effort on my part, she learns so <br/>
much!  She reads them cover to cover, tears the pictures out and makes <br/>
collages, asks for books and specialty magazines she&#39;s seen advertised <br/>
therein, surfs websites mentioned, etc.  After seeing all the ramps and <br/>
various pipes they show, she begged us to build her a ramp and a half-pipe.  <br/>
My husband told her he really needed her help figuring out how she wanted it <br/>
built, so she broke out her old math book to figure out demensions, etc.  <br/>
She got a few shirts in the mail yesterday that she saw online and because <br/>
they were clearance shirts, they only had larges.  So she asked me to make <br/>
them smaller.  I told her it would be really cool if she would help me.  <br/>
(I&#39;ve been practically begging her to sew with me for years!)  She was all <br/>
for it when I mentioned she could splice two together to make a block shirt. <br/>
  (Half front of one, half front of another...same with the back.)  She just <br/>
bought a shirt like that at a local skate shop and loves it so THAT idea was <br/>
just too cool for words!  We sewed together for about three hours yesterday. <br/>
  All because of a magazine!<br/>
<br/>
Nicholette loves singing, so I bought her a karaoke (sp??) machine and tons <br/>
of blank tapes for her to play with.  Her favorite show is American Idol, at <br/>
the moment anyway, so she wanted me to help her get online so she could look <br/>
at the website.  We read the bios and she thought it was so cool that so <br/>
many of them loved singing at her age and even younger!  I had to go in and <br/>
feed Chloe (our computer is in the garage for the time being) and she came <br/>
in screaming about 20 minutes later.  She read an entire sentence to me!  My <br/>
sweet girl sat there and sounded out every single letter because she wanted <br/>
to keep reading!  So far, she&#39;s only read Bob Books.  Today, she wants to <br/>
get back online and try PBSKids because she says it will be easier.  She was <br/>
watching Between the Lions yesterday and heard they have reading games!  <br/>
Yippee!!!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
The time with her online only amounted to about 45 minutes, if that.  The <br/>
rest of the day, she just played with her sisters and brothers.  But MAN!  <br/>
In 20 minutes she went from reading Mat sat on Sam to reading a sentence off <br/>
American Idol!  Pretty impressive!<br/>
<br/>
When I ws in your place, it helped me to keep a very general notebook handy. <br/>
  I went through intense guilt because I felt like I was neglecting my kids. <br/>
  It really helped me to spend two whole days, documenting what we did all <br/>
day.  Not necessarily breaking it down into &#39;subjects&#39;, just something to <br/>
let me know we actually did a LOT by doing &#39;nothing&#39;.  Does that make sense? <br/>
  It might help you to see on paper that you actually spend a lot more time <br/>
with your kids than you realize.  Not to mention that they ARE learning all <br/>
the time!<br/>
<br/>
Let go of your fears.  You are doing just fine!<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100767298">Jennifer,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for the run down.  I did start a little notebook, <br/>
and always forget things after a few days.  I finally understood why <br/>
everyone complains about documentation..LOL!!  But I think I will try <br/>
it again.  Hearing what you do helps because my day is not so <br/>
different, just less kids running around!!  So maybe, we are on the <br/>
right track.  I am even letting Keiran watch Harry Potter again, and <br/>
than I realized he likes watching to act out the scenes.  He keeps <br/>
coming up to us saying, &quot;You want to see me act?&quot; and lays the lines <br/>
on you accent and all.  So maybe he is getting more than one would <br/>
think from the show.  I don&#39;t really mind him watching, it is just <br/>
that inner voice saying he should be doing something better with his <br/>
time..you know..like learning to read..LOL!!  Oh well, it is just me, <br/>
I know!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937868748">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I am so new to the game of home unschooling as to be in the first <br/>
week of thinking of it.<br/>
<br/>
... But our two, 8 and 10, are sold on the idea of saying adios to <br/>
the school system in June.<br/>
<br/>
My first question is, how hard is unschooling with a Seventh grade <br/>
boy (very bright) who has been inculcated with trad. schooling since <br/>
beginning.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a sample &quot;curriculum &quot; on the web that can be tweaked and <br/>
delivered to my VA school superintendent citing our intentions. What <br/>
have you submitted to officials asking for &#39;proof&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for being you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307465523">Hi Olga<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I&#39;m not doing a lot with my kids. Robby surprised me by <br/>
making that gloppy recipe all by himself. Laid the book out on the <br/>
table, got all the equipment and ingredients organized. He had to <br/>
have read through the whole recipe before starting, because there are <br/>
two different solutions that must be mixed, before mixing them <br/>
together. Then carefully followed the instructions, and did his thing <br/>
without any help from me. <br/>
<br/>
I am SO GLAD I wrote this out. Looking back, I see the level of <br/>
organization and foresight it took for Robby to tackle that glop his <br/>
own self. I&#39;d like to SEE a curriculum that includes &quot;self-<br/>
organization&quot; and &quot;careful reading of instructions.&quot; The only thing I <br/>
did was &quot;Ewww&quot; and &quot;oooh!&quot; at the stuff. It&#39;s very cool, and very <br/>
simple. <br/>
<br/>
Katie has been listening to Chronicles of Narnia on tape and hanging <br/>
out in her room by herself. We made spritz cookies a few days ago, <br/>
with a cookie dough press/gun, but haven&#39;t done much since then.<br/>
<br/>
And Abbie has been spending a lot of time on chat rooms and LOTR <br/>
discussion boards. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re majorly deschooling here, though. I am glad I wrote that about <br/>
Robby&#39;s goop project, though. makes me feel good. I imagine, once we <br/>
get out of the &quot;yippeee! as much TV and computer as I want!!!&quot; stage, <br/>
all of them are going to find things that interest them, and that we <br/>
can do together. And they&#39;re going to be interested in the things I <br/>
eventually figure out that *I* want to do :&#92;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658753725">Hi.  I&#39;m not doing a whole lot with them right now either.  I figured we/I<br/>
needed de-schooling for awhile also.  We went to the library the other day<br/>
and Haley (10 end of the month) picked out some books on drawing animals,<br/>
people, etc.  She&#39;s really been enjoying that.  She like to illustrate<br/>
stories she makes up too.  She&#39;s read Harry Potter twice and anxiously<br/>
awaiting the next book along with the million others (and me). lol  She&#39;s<br/>
working on &quot;A Series of Unfortunate Events&quot; now too. <br/>
<br/>
Kayla (8) asked me to help her set the alarm last night so she could get up<br/>
at 7 and watch Power Rangers.  I didn&#39;t think she would but I asked her this<br/>
afternoon if she did and she said yes, she got up, watched it and went back<br/>
to bed..lol.  She likes to count and counts everything, everywhere we go. <br/>
She also plays computer games from time to time but mostly is into TV right<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
Katy(5) has been copying words wherever she can find them.   Going through<br/>
tons of paper these days &lt;bg&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
Denver (2) requires me the most.  He likes to dance and run. &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have been having a real blast the last month or so watching things blossom<br/>
  It&#39;s so much more fun to sit back and watch than it was to force it.  I<br/>
notice so many more things than I ever did before with all the kids.  It&#39;s<br/>
funny sometimes watching I can almost see their little wheels spinning. <br/>
Great fun.  I&#39;ve got all of you to thank for this too..for helping me to sit<br/>
down and get out of their way. :)  <br/>

Joy,<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: How much interaction time with children?<br/>
 <br/>
Hi Olga<br/>
 <br/>
Right now, I&#39;m not doing a lot with my kids. Robby surprised me by <br/>
making that gloppy recipe all by himself. Laid the book out on the <br/>
table, got all the equipment and ingredients organized. He had to <br/>
have read through the whole recipe before starting, because there are <br/>
two different solutions that must be mixed, before mixing them <br/>
together. Then carefully followed the instructions, and did his thing <br/>
without any help from me. <br/>
 <br/>
I am SO GLAD I wrote this out. Looking back, I see the level of <br/>
organization and foresight it took for Robby to tackle that glop his <br/>
own self. I&#39;d like to SEE a curriculum that includes &quot;self-<br/>
organization&quot; and &quot;careful reading of instructions.&quot; The only thing I <br/>
did was &quot;Ewww&quot; and &quot;oooh!&quot; at the stuff. It&#39;s very cool, and very <br/>
simple. <br/>
 <br/>
Katie has been listening to Chronicles of Narnia on tape and hanging <br/>
out in her room by herself. We made spritz cookies a few days ago, <br/>
with a cookie dough press/gun, but haven&#39;t done much since then.<br/>
 <br/>
And Abbie has been spending a lot of time on chat rooms and LOTR <br/>
discussion boards. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re majorly deschooling here, though. I am glad I wrote that about <br/>
Robby&#39;s goop project, though. makes me feel good. I imagine, once we <br/>
get out of the &quot;yippeee! as much TV and computer as I want!!!&quot; stage, <br/>
all of them are going to find things that interest them, and that we <br/>
can do together. And they&#39;re going to be interested in the things I <br/>
eventually figure out that *I* want to do :&#92;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477835312">Our son Dustin does his own thing. <br/>
I do play Xbox with him, I sometimes read pages out of a book he is reading <br/>
cuz he wants me to. He likes to cook so he usually fixes his own Breakfast <br/>
and Lunch.<br/>
I told him a week or so ago when it was going through this list, that he no <br/>
longer has a cut off time for bed. It was really causing a rift between DH <br/>
and him. He was thrilled! He sets his timer in sixty minute increments so it <br/>
isn&#39;t on all night. Funny thing is he is going to sleep at the same time as <br/>
before and up by 8:00.<br/>
<br/>
I do take him shopping when I go, he is always with me whenever I leave. He <br/>
has always wanted to go to the store even when its female stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight was great we left at 7 and went to Joo Ann Fabrics cuz I had a <br/>
coupon, then to Barnes N Noble. We where there for two hours it was heaven.  <br/>
He picked up a couple books and I bought an older John Holt book because they <br/>
still do not have the new one. I told the guy at the store I said &quot;ahh, you <br/>
may want to order a couple copies, there are over 2.8 million Hs in the US.  <br/>
I would imagine it would be a good idea to stock it He just looked at me and <br/>
said ,&quot;ok I&#39;ll order in a few&quot; I felt like I had two heads, I still dont get <br/>
what his issue was with me saying that. Dahh, just order the stupid book you <br/>
might make some money if it is instock......<br/>
So then Dustin and I sat and had a capachino, it was so great that we could <br/>
just sit there and talk about our books.<br/>
We swung into the kids section and a lady that worked there was listening to <br/>
us and wanted to suggest a book. She said to Dustin &quot;what grade are you in?&quot; <br/>
Ahhh, Ahhh Ahh, he says. Im like Dustin 5th, I said to the lady &quot;we Unschool <br/>
and dont really keep track of the Grade.&quot; That was the dumbest response I <br/>
have ever had. Geezzz DAH!<br/>
So that was our night minus a quick stop to Walmart.<br/>
I think the time I spend with him goes in spurts and also depends on the <br/>
weather.<br/>
Guess I could have just answered the question rather then write &quot;a day in our <br/>
life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272419428">&quot;Teachable moments&quot; is a piece of school vocabulary/mentality that you<br/>
can probably afford to let go of. Children have &quot;learning moments&quot; every<br/>
waking moment, and this list has been full of people telling us ruefully<br/>
of how their moments of &quot;teaching&quot; regardless how gently, have run<br/>
aground against their children&#39;s marvelous determination to be<br/>
individual and process their own learning.<br/>
<br/>
By all means read, take them places and play games, without the ulterior<br/>
motive of finding teachable moments. Would a day be wasted if you didn&#39;t<br/>
find any? I bet the kids would have learnt stuff anyway, including how<br/>
cool their Mom is! John Holt has a lot to say on keeping interactions<br/>
with children real, and avoiding what he called &quot;the devil teacher&quot; in<br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
If you are available to do stuff with them, and not putting your need to<br/>
teach onto them, however subtly, they will then feel free to say, &quot;I&#39;d<br/>
like to do such-and-such for a while, in my room. See you later&quot;. Jayn<br/>

I know you are right.  I know he is learning alot but translating it <br/>
is the hardest.  I am finally understanding why everyone complains <br/>
about documenting.  Even loose curriculum is easy to sort into <br/>

Exactly! The learning is so much deeper. It&#39;s meaningful and it&#39;s <br/>
personal to your child. It&#39;s not something easily put into a stilted <br/>
curriculum with narrowly defined subjects.<br/>

make sure that you are familiar with the law. There are 4 options, 1 is to use a <br/>
approved curriculum (so if you are unschooling that is out!) and one is if you are <br/>
a teacher. The remaining 2 options depend on if you have a college degree or not. If<br/>
you (or your husband) do have a degree, it is extremely simple and your description<br/>
of your &quot;course of study&quot; can be a sentence or two.  If you do not have a degree,<br/>
there are a few more requirements (you need to say that you will include the <br/>
SOLs (but there is no follow up to show that you did)). For the most part, the <br/>
less info you give them the better.<br/>

<br/>
I am in Lake Jackson, a magical piece of land on its banks, just <br/>
south of Manassas.<br/>
<br/>
I did join the VA Eclectic list. I am glad to know the difference, <br/>
thanks to a recent post by Alan & Brenda Leonard, between eclectic <br/>
and unsing -- and that there are some unschoolers on the VA list...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your good info. Especially, the part that says I could <br/>
list &quot;my husband&#39;s BA degree&quot;-- I have but 2-year degree, myself and <br/>
wondered if I could list his. THEN, I could use option #3, I can <br/>
forget about SOL&#39;s and simply be faced with providing proof of <br/>
advancement at year&#39;s end, correct?<br/>
<br/>
I am suddenly very psyched to be a mother since I made my decision <br/>
for unschooling this weekend!<br/>

But the COOL thing is now he&#39;s doing it because he WANTS to!!  It must feel <br/>
bigger, bolder and better.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Funny thing is he is going to sleep at the same time as <br/>
&gt; before and up by 8:00. &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, Yes! It does! It&#39;s great to see him in the am. He comes into my room and <br/>
uses the computer or gets the baby if he wakes at the same time.  He has his <br/>
moments as all children do but he is a pleasure to have at home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153648498"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Thanks for all your good info. Especially, the part that says I could <br/>
&gt; list &quot;my husband&#39;s BA degree&quot;-- I have but 2-year degree, myself and <br/>
&gt; wondered if I could list his. THEN, I could use option #3, I can <br/>
&gt; forget about SOL&#39;s and simply be faced with providing proof of <br/>
&gt; advancement at year&#39;s end, correct?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My understanding is that it does not matter which parent has the degree. You just<br/>
need to provide a copy of it. You could ask on Va Eclectic to be sure. I am pretty<br/>
sure that there are others who have done that.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to list!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941834685">&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not doing a whole lot with them right now either. <br/>
I figured we/I needed de-schooling for awhile also. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-----&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m guessing maybe (maybe not) the person who wrote that and some<br/>
who read it <br/>
think of &quot;doing with them&quot; as having something to do with <br/>
teaching/learning/educational activities.&gt;&gt;&gt;----<br/>
<br/>
ahhh yes.. I do believe that is where my mind was when I wrote that.  Right.<br/>
<br/>
 We are all together 24/7 and just doing what we do.  Still trying to<br/>
dissolve the &quot;schooly&quot; thinking. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Have you guys seen &#39;Dogtown and Z-boys&#39;? it&#39;s this really amazing documentary about the birth of skateboarding as we know it today. We watched it yesterday, it was really good. jaiden is getting interested in skateboarding and surfing, we watch a lot of skateboarding and surfing movies and almost all of our friend do one if not both and are all waiting for him to get just a little older so they can start taking him out. <br/>
