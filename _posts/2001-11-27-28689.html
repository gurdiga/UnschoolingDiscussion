<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776961303">Our change of parenting styles happened many years ago but I remember how difficult it was to go it alone. If it weren&#39;t for a best friend who was also at the same point in life, I doubt I would&#39;ve had the courage to venture out like this. <br/>
We promised each other that we were no longer going to hound the kids to learn something and do &quot;school&quot; stuff. We would give it ONE year. (The way we saw it back then, if the kids did nothing the entire year, we&#39;d only be behind one year and that didn&#39;t seem so horrible. OTOH, if the kids took back their own education, yahoo!!!!)Instead, we had to re-learn how to instill that self-motivation in our kids... a very difficult thing to do imo once you&#39;ve screwed it up. But, by reading Gatto and Holt and for me especially Grace Lewellyns&#39; books, we had the conviction to stick to our plan. We let the kids do as they pleased day in and day out (except the expected help around the house). Academically speaking, it was open to whatever they dreamed up. My dd watched tv for six solid months. I thought I&#39;d croak. There were days I&#39;d call my friend to console me when she&#39;d be experiencing the same thing over at her house. It wasn&#39;t until six months later that our kids *finally* decided that there was more to life than television. Each one in each family took a different path. My dd asked for her old Miquan Math books to do on her own. Her dd started writing stories.  Her son learned to read by asking for comic books. More and more, the tv was left off. And things took off from there. <br/>
I can only describe it as a leap into the unknown but the security in knowing that we could always turn back in a year and not be any worse off than we already were.<br/>

ps.. we told the kids what we were doing (i.e. giving you back your educational choices) and they thought that was grand. What started out as &quot;we don&#39;t have to do anything&quot; turned into &quot;we sure would like to know about xxx&quot;) &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Now, speaking of &quot;extremism,&quot; my problem with labels and rules is that<br/>
somehow all these rules and labels about being &quot;real&quot; unschoolers somehow<br/>
seems the polar opposite of what unschooling is suppose to be all about!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798403177">You&#39;re welcome, Meghan. The problem is, though... it doesn&#39;t always work for *every* child (as in my child #2 and my friend&#39;s child #3). :(<br/>
Lynda pointed out in a previous post about unschooling being about the individual. That&#39;s 100% true and each one will take the same situation and respond differently. That&#39;s where our parenting skills really need to be tuned into our kids so we can *know* that what worked for this one won&#39;t necessarily work for the next one. <br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t hold a rigid definition because each kid will need to be unschooled in variations on the same theme... to give the child ownership of his education.  You, the parent, has to know when complete freedom and &quot;hands off&quot; works and when a child needs more guidance, whatever form that may take while still letting it be the child&#39;s choice to learn something. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How would you define &quot;won&#39;t work&quot; and why are you sure?<br/>
<br/>
If we see unschooling as the way we learned to communicate in our native<br/>
language then if a mother needs to modify how she views life and interacts<br/>
with a particular child in order to meet his needs, does that call natural<br/>
learning into question?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is how we&#39;ve learned from the beginning of our lives. It was<br/>
just John Holt&#39;s way of saying learning doesn&#39;t change at 6 years old. We<br/>
can continue to do it the way we&#39;ve always done it. It&#39;s us adults that need<br/>
to see things in new ways, thus a specific name for what the kids are doing<br/>
at school age. The kids don&#39;t change. It&#39;s we adults who need to see things<br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I think if we truly<br/>
&gt; want to support unschooling, we need to be a little less judgemental<br/>
&gt; about those who aren&#39;t sure and just encourage them to let go a little at<br/>
&gt; a time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think we each need to find what style of encouragement works best for<br/>
us. Some may get positive feedback from gentle persuasion. Others may get<br/>
positive feedback from being blunt. If some perceive that blunt style as<br/>
judgemental that doesn&#39;t make it any less effective for those who need<br/>
bluntness. Different people need different styles. So I don&#39;t think &quot;we&quot;<br/>
should be limited to one technique.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301889594">There are children out there with medical problems.  There are children<br/>
with learning disabilities.  All of them will learn to cope with life one<br/>
way or another.  There are some who left on there own will learn to cope<br/>
by becoming violent.  If we lived in a utopia, this would not happen. <br/>
But guess what?  We are a long way form Utopia.  It is our job as parents<br/>
to give our children what they need to become independent adults.  <br/>
Here&#39;s an example of an external factor, my SIL lives in a nasty<br/>
neighborhood, hangs out in bars and has had 2 kids by different men but<br/>
never been married.  Should I encourage her to pull her kids from school<br/>
and unschool them?  Knowing that the education they get will probably<br/>
include drugs and prostitution and not much opportunity for anything<br/>
else.  Unschooling would be a very bad thing for them.  <br/>
Temperament example: Left entirely to his own my son would not learn to<br/>
read because he believed he could not read.  With a little help from my<br/>
mom, that you and Sandra and that group would consider anathema to<br/>
unschooling, he has learned to read quite well.  Sure, we sort of bribed<br/>
him to get him started, but he is happy that we did and says so.  He was<br/>
frustrated and frequently upset before we gave him the push.  Should we<br/>
have allowed him to be frustrated longer in the hopes he would figure it<br/>
out alone?<br/>
On the other hand, pure unschooling is working very well for my older<br/>
two.  They do absolutely nothing they don&#39;t want to do academically and<br/>
very little they don&#39;t want to be doing regarding keeping house.  <br/>
The biggest problem in our school system today is the growing idea that<br/>
every child should do everything the same way at the same time.  The<br/>
biggest problem I see here is that there are those who seem to assume we<br/>
all face the same challenge and that the same things and the same system<br/>
will work with all of our children. <br/>

Lots of dialog has resulted from my dd&#39;s situation and I thank all who<br/>
offered ideas and food for thought. I&#39;ve got plenty to mull over now so if<br/>
ya&#39;ll wish to continue the discussion, fine... I&#39;ll keep reading. But I<br/>
worry that I&#39;ll totally saturate the list with *my* problems so I&#39;m going to<br/>
refrain from further posting about our situation as I feel I have adequately<br/>
described it in *great* detail. Again, I thank all who have helped and<br/>
offered advice and will now just sit back and think things over.<br/>

&gt; There are children out there with medical problems.  There are children<br/>
&gt; with learning disabilities.  All of them will learn to cope with life one<br/>
&gt; way or another.  There are some who left on there own will learn to cope<br/>
&gt; by becoming violent.  If we lived in a utopia, this would not happen.<br/>
&gt; But guess what?  We are a long way form Utopia.  It is our job as parents<br/>
&gt; to give our children what they need to become independent adults.<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s an example of an external factor, my SIL lives in a nasty<br/>
&gt; neighborhood, hangs out in bars and has had 2 kids by different men but<br/>
&gt; never been married.  Should I encourage her to pull her kids from school<br/>
&gt; and unschool them?  Knowing that the education they get will probably<br/>
&gt; include drugs and prostitution and not much opportunity for anything<br/>
&gt; else.  Unschooling would be a very bad thing for them.<br/>
&gt; Temperament example: Left entirely to his own my son would not learn to<br/>
&gt; read because he believed he could not read.  With a little help from my<br/>
&gt; mom, that you and Sandra and that group would consider anathema to<br/>
&gt; unschooling, he has learned to read quite well.  Sure, we sort of bribed<br/>
&gt; him to get him started, but he is happy that we did and says so.  He was<br/>
&gt; frustrated and frequently upset before we gave him the push.  Should we<br/>
&gt; have allowed him to be frustrated longer in the hopes he would figure it<br/>
&gt; out alone?<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, pure unschooling is working very well for my older<br/>
&gt; two.  They do absolutely nothing they don&#39;t want to do academically and<br/>
&gt; very little they don&#39;t want to be doing regarding keeping house.<br/>
&gt; The biggest problem in our school system today is the growing idea that<br/>
&gt; every child should do everything the same way at the same time.  The<br/>
&gt; biggest problem I see here is that there are those who seem to assume we<br/>
&gt; all face the same challenge and that the same things and the same system<br/>
&gt; will work with all of our children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, three posts below this one (on my time-delayed email) you write:<br/>
&quot;You, the parent, has to know when complete freedom and &quot;hands off&quot; works<br/>
and when a child needs more guidance, whatever form that may take while<br/>
still letting it be the child&#39;s choice to learn something. &quot;  How is<br/>
&quot;needs more guidance&quot; different from making a kid do something? If it&#39;s<br/>
not &quot;complete freedom&quot; as far as learning is concerned, it&#39;s not<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

Unschooling is how we&#39;ve learned from the beginning of our lives. It was<br/>
just John Holt&#39;s way of saying learning doesn&#39;t change at 6 years old. We<br/>
can continue to do it the way we&#39;ve always done it. It&#39;s us adults that need<br/>
to see things in new ways, thus a specific name for what the kids are doing<br/>
at school age. The kids don&#39;t change. It&#39;s we adults who need to see things<br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I agree so much. In fact, I explain this to people who inquire about <br/>
un&quot;school&quot;ing (I have moved to use the term &quot;natural learning&quot;). I mean, <br/>
geez, I didn&#39;t have to &quot;teach&quot; Alexandria to walk, talk, use the toilet, <br/>
etc. She did it, and I was there to support her. She *wanted* to do those <br/>
things; why do most believe that children won&#39;t want to learn to do other <br/>
things, too?<br/>
