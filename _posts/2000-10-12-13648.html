Hi Sonia and everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Canada too by the way (montreal), and i had to pop in and say how much <br/>
i agree about the lack of support from the mainstream.  All of my son&#39;s <br/>
friends are going to pre-school now, and i find it strange, lonely and quiet. <br/>
 The one HS event we go to is HS choir and my son runs rampant the whole <br/>
time! Oh well! I am sticking to it.  Like some of the rest of you, i have <br/>
practise doing my own thing----on the organics end of things, slowly eating <br/>
less meat, extended breastfeeding.  At a mom&#39;s group this morning the topic <br/>
was &quot;proud to be a mom&quot; and all the women were going on and on about how <br/>
important it is to be at home, how it is an honourable profession, and how we <br/>
need more govn&#39;t recognition, and how well our kids turn out when we&#39;re home <br/>
for the early years.  Then one mom said, &quot;the only problem i see with staying <br/>
home is how difficult it is for our kids to adjust to being away from us and <br/>
going to school&quot;!!! I squirmed and pontificated to myself (i don&#39;t want to be <br/>
a crusader in this group).  So many people take the home-based natural living <br/>
thing so far, and then no more.  They might breastfeed, but for a short time, <br/>
they might stay/work at home, but then send their kids to school.  What i <br/>
wished everyone out there understood, is that HS is just taking it one step <br/>
further again, and teaching our kids at home, as a family together.  I know <br/>
people don&#39;t see it this way, because it is still viewed as an &#39;exotic&#39; <br/>
lifestyle choice by so many.<br/>
