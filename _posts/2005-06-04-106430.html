===========================<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
This is a good math opportunity for any humans, unschoolers or  not.<br/>
 <br/>
If it takes a magnification of 75 for Mars to look as big as the moon,  <br/>
that&#39;s not nearly as big as the moon.<br/>
 <br/>
Opportunities that are once-in-a-lifetime (and I think it&#39;s cool; not  saying <br/>
it&#39;s not) aren&#39;t unschooling opportunities.  They&#39;re  once-in-a-lifetime <br/>
opportunities and those who are interested will be  interested regardless of their <br/>
school status.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635782571">Unfortunately, the original message is simply in error.  This *October*,<br/>
Mars will reach opposition with the Earth, and while it&#39;s a good apparition,<br/>
August 2003 was quite a bit closer.<br/>
<br/>
And, to give you an idea of what all of this means in terms of observing<br/>
Mars, I pushed my telescope with a 16&quot; (40 cm) wide mirror to several<br/>
hundred power (I don&#39;t have my logs in front of me, so I&#39;m not sure what the<br/>
exact power was), under PERFECT conditions, and I was able to discern a few<br/>
of the most prominent of Mars&#39; features.  <br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind, too, that observational astronomy is very much a learned skill<br/>
-- so where I could pick out features on Mars, a novice stepping to the<br/>
eyepiece for the first time might have seen little more than a smeary orange<br/>
disk.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t say this to discourage folks from observing Mars this fall -- but I<br/>
always hate to see people terribly disappointed when they are pumped up by<br/>
claims such as these, only to learn that, as is so often the case, there&#39;s<br/>
no easy shortcut to the most rewarding of experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
The availability of Hubble and other very high-quality images of a wide<br/>
variety of astronomical objects has made it all too common for a first-time<br/>
observer to expect to see what they&#39;ve found in books and magazines.  You&#39;ll<br/>
see many beautiful things through a telescope, and many will become only<br/>
more beautiful as your skills improve, but you&#39;ll rarely get views that<br/>
compare to the photographs.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps -- and please feel free to ask me any questions that may<br/>
come up about astronomical matters; I relish the experience of seeing people<br/>
come to understand just how incredibly grand our universe is, and how much<br/>
they can learn about it with their own eyes.<br/>

Fortunately, it happens every 15-17 years, so will happen again in our<br/>
lifetimes, so if you missed it then, you can catch the re-runs in 2018 :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758228680">Thanks for the extra insight!  We&#39;re pretty lucky to<br/>
have a university observatory nearby and they love to<br/>
have people come out and peek and learn.  We&#39;ll take<br/>
advantage and pick their brains when October rolls<br/>
around!<br/>
