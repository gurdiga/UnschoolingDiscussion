<div id="ygrps-yiv-863482363">Maybe Mighty Math Cosmic Geometry computer game before anything else - <br/>
it is lovely?<br/>
<br/>
If she liked doing the Key to Algebra series, then maybe she&#39;d like the <br/>
Keys to Geometry?<br/>
<br/>
Hey Paula - maybe you can get her to go through one of the really cool <br/>
math concept/activity books - she can do it from the first to the last <br/>
pages and satisfy her urge to do it that way - but would probably get a <br/>
lot more out of it than a regular geometry text - even Jacobs (which is <br/>
very cool). &quot;How Math Works&quot; is a good example. Or &quot;Joy of Mathematics&quot; <br/>
by Theoni Pappas.<br/>
