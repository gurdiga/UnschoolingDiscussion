One day when Kirby was 12 or so, several of us were at a park.  I was with another adult friend of mine who had been living in another state and didn&#39;t know my kids very well.  Kirby had borrowed the car keys to get something from the van, and brought them back to me, but I asked him to put them in my basket, about eight feet from where I was standing.  He kind of slumped and showed the great difficulty of complying with that request, and my friend said &quot;Would you like some cheese with that whine?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby stood back up while looking my friend (Cathyn, for those who know him) down face to foot, and back up to his face and said:  &quot;Would *you* be cutting it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH MY GOD, it was so wonderfully timed and presented that I took the keys and Cathyn bowed to him and complimented him.<br/>
<br/>
Later I asked Kirby where he had heard that, whether it was a quote from a movie or something, but no, he came up with it on the spot.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, Holly had a bunch of friends over (oh, probably her birthday, so November) and we were playing Wise and Otherwise, which is like playing dictionary--you make something plausible up to bluff.  Some of us played it at SUSS, and some at the ALL Unschooling Symposium.  But each player completes a proverb from some culture or other.  This was &quot;there is an old West African saying&quot; (I think it was):  The king is like...<br/>
<br/>
There were eight or ten players--a good number.  Holly wrote &quot;...famous and stuff.&quot;  (The king is like famous and stuff.)<br/>
A friend of hers wrote &quot;The king is like a monkey in a piñata.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t forget that image.<br/>
<br/>
So I wanted to say, for parents who wonder about their child learning to write, that they should think more about their opportunities to play with language in amusing, fun, but real-life ways, than about whether they can &quot;compose a sentence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to collect some examples of tiny little writings, incidental texts, jokes, role-playing jewels on a page called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/language/shortbursts">http://sandradodd.com/language/shortbursts</a><br/>

Noor does that too! And she says, &quot;Wait, rewind....&quot; when she wants you to repeat something, or when she wants to say something over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834128437">When Dylan was little we found a monster movie marathon on TV on New Year’s eve and monster movies became a New Year’s Eve tradition.  One year, when Dylan was maybe seven or eight our marathon was Gamera movies.   Sometime earlier we had read or talked about a story Stephen Hawking tells in his book, A Brief History of Time about a conversation between a scientist and a flat earther.  The flat earther says the world is supported on the back of a tortoise and when asked what supports the tortoise the flat earther says, “It’s turtles all the way down.” <br/>
<br/>
As we were nestling in to watch our Gamera marathon I asked Dylan if he’d like to switch over later to watch the ball drop in Times Square and he said, “No, it’s a turtles all the way countdown for us!”<br/>
