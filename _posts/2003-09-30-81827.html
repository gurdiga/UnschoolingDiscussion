<div id="ygrps-yiv-300071321">&lt;&lt;As a cosleeping, attachment parenting mom I thought I had it all figured <br/>
out until my first child turned 2. Suddenly, everything fell apart and I didn&#39;t <br/>
know where to turn. The AP advice just didn&#39;t work anymore - then I found this <br/>
book! Though I didn&#39;t agree on every point, the basic philosophy makes sense <br/>
- and works! It&#39;s a breath of fresh air not to be at the mercy of my 30 month <br/>
old any more. Rosemond gives moms permission to take charge, to teach and <br/>
discipline their children.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Same page, negative review of a book on Christian unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Take, for instance, a case appropriate for the Christian audience. A child <br/>
might love the great heroes of the Bible, earnestly researching their lives <br/>
and tales, while at the same time showing no desire to ever understand or pursue <br/>
doctrinal knowledge. Certainly no parent would want that to continue. The <br/>
hole in the unschooling model is that there are few ways of remedying this lack <br/>
without moving outside of unschooling. Therefore, as a philosophy unto itself, <br/>
it fails. Other examples that find the chinks in the armor abound.&gt;&gt;<br/>
