    Hi!  Our land is in South Texas not far from the historically rich<br/>
Goliad.  The little community where our land is located is Schroeder.<br/>
About the only thing there is a little renovated one room school house<br/>
that my grandmother, grandfather, and allot of my great aunts and uncles<br/>
attended.  About two miles away is the Lutheran Church where me and my<br/>
wife were married, and my Grandmother and Grandfather before us.  My<br/>
Great Grandfather hauled wood from now extinct Port Indianola, (appx. 60<br/>
miles) in a wagon back to Schroeder (which at that time was called<br/>
Germantown) to help build the church.  There is also one of the oldest<br/>
dance halls in Texas there which started out being a community hall.<br/>
The Land has been in my family for over 100 yrs.  I have been dreaming<br/>
about moving there and building a house where the old homesite of my<br/>
Great Grandfather was before it burned down around the turn of the<br/>
previous century.  Oh well,  I better shut up now before I can&#39;t. Love<br/>
my land.<br/>
