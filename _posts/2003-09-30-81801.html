example where it helps.<br/>
<br/>
My son has two lesbian moms, and we are Unitarian Universalists, and <br/>
unschoolers. Oh, and his dad is a Pagan. When we started homeschooling we were looking <br/>
for support groups...and homeschooling friends.  We wandered into a couple of <br/>
Christian homeschooling groups, not knowing better.  I realized that  these <br/>
weren&#39;t the groups for us quickly, luckily. But not before getting an earful of <br/>
the danger of not having a good curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t come out about the other stuff. The main thing I wanted to be <br/>
careful of was never having my little son having to hear how eveil and hell-bound <br/>
his family was. This was a safety issue.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, there are homeschoolers with very different philosophies, and while <br/>
there are some religiously fundamental Christian homeschoolers who are not rigid <br/>
academically, and are very tolerant people, these groups tend to NOT be that. <br/>
The Bob Jones folks ARE homophobic (and racist, actually), generally. Mostly, <br/>
they DO think unschooling is wrong, if not sinful. <br/>
<br/>
So, for me, the issue is descriptive rather than stereotypical. And while I <br/>
am happy to talk to anyone with any perspective as an individual, I don&#39;t want <br/>
to wander into large groups of people who think I&#39;m going to hell because my <br/>
14-year relationship is sinful.<br/>

<br/>
The term homophobic is a pejorative term and one they don&#39;t <br/>
believe applies to them. Fundamentalists aren&#39;t afraid of <br/>
homosexuality. They think it is sinful, immoral behavior. That <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they are &quot;homophobic&quot; but that they have a <br/>
religious reason for opposing it. And a large number feel that <br/>
they are offering compassion to elucidate that position and to <br/>
offer recovery programs to heal those in the lifestyle. They think <br/>
they are being loving.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that I agree with their position, btw. But I think it&#39;s <br/>
similar to the way Pro-lifers will call Pro-choicers--pro-abortion or <br/>
baby killers. That&#39;s not how the pro-choice side sees itself. <br/>
Likewise, the Pro-life community isn&#39;t &quot;anti-women&quot; but sees <br/>
itself as protecting the unborn.<br/>
<br/>
We have to take care in what labels we use or we <br/>
misunderstand the other side.<br/>
<br/>
There certainly are those in the Chrisitan community who are <br/>
afraid of homosexuality and who are intolerant and cruel to <br/>
homosexuals. But there are also those who simply hold the <br/>
belief that the lifestyle is wrong (just as many here would hold <br/>
that the &quot;school at home&quot; method of education is wrong...) based <br/>
on their belief system.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they DO think unschooling is wrong, if not sinful. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am in these circles and I haven&#39;t encountered that attitude (that <br/>
unschooling is sinful). In fact, the more fundamentalist, the more <br/>
unschooling these families become but for entirely different <br/>
reasons. It&#39;s odd actually. The biggest proponents of the <br/>
unschooling lifestyle that I encountered before this group were <br/>
hardcore fundamentalist Christians. The educational system is <br/>
suspect to them and they put high value on living a life of actual <br/>
learning rather than school so that each peson can become fully <br/>
the peson God intended rather than what the system intends.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are lots of conservative Christians who don&#39;t <br/>
unschool, don&#39;t agree with unschooling and don&#39;t understand <br/>
unschooling. But I have yet to find anyone who says it is &quot;sinful.&quot; <br/>
Has someone said that to you specifically?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; So, for me, the issue is descriptive rather than stereotypical. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But it&#39;s your description based on your encounters and <br/>
interpretation of those encounters that forms your &quot;descriptions&quot; <br/>
which are actually interpretations. Just like they will form their <br/>
descriptions of you and homosexuals based on their encounters <br/>
and interpretations. <br/>
<br/>
I think we owe it to people to try to understand the ideas behind <br/>
these viewpoints and why they believe what they hold to be true <br/>
makes sense. Most people see themselves as good, consistent <br/>
and loving (on all sides of each debate). Why do people think <br/>
that way about themselves when other groups see them as <br/>
hostile, undermining and cruel? This kind of thinking has to <br/>
occur for each side of the debate (whatever the issue is).<br/>
<br/>
And while I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; am happy to talk to anyone with any perspective as an <br/>
 </span></blockquote>individual, I don&#39;t want <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to wander into large groups of people who think I&#39;m going to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hell because my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; 14-year relationship is sinful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Certainly that&#39;s your choice. And it&#39;s a wise one. I think likewise <br/>
the fundamentalists would feel very uncomfortable in <br/>
unschooling groups of UU members too. :) I visited a UU church <br/>
not too long ago and it was clear to me right away that most of <br/>
my friends would have felt totally uncomfortable there, despite <br/>
the fact that everyone was friendly. I enjoyed it though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; white male, because the whole oppression thing is getting <br/>
 </span></blockquote>really old<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry about how old this gets. I can imagine it does. The time <br/>
of homosexual civil rights being taken as seriously as women&#39;s <br/>
rights or civil rights for blacks is still ahead of us, I&#39;m afraid. <br/>
Sexuality is so core to who we are that it seems we can&#39;t treat it <br/>
with the same dispassionate distance that it deserves.<br/>
<br/>
My main point in this post is to just alert you to the fact that those <br/>
who hold the &quot;intolerant&quot; positions don&#39;t believe they are being <br/>
unloving or fearful but that they see themselves as preserving <br/>
something sacred. Unfortunately, our humanity often interferes <br/>
and the results are cruelty. I&#39;ve suffered under some of the <br/>
fundamentalist tendency to exclude and judge this past year <br/>
(and lost 14 lbs in the process!) so I&#39;m not trying to diminish your <br/>
experience, just to enlighten it a bit. It helps me to do so.<br/>

Statements of faith are designed to keep people out. That is the <br/>
way I was excluded last year from an event (I&#39;m a Christian but <br/>
not a narrow enough definition for this one SoF).<br/>
<br/>
In looking at it backwards, they would ask, &quot;Are you really only <br/>
interested in homeschooling or in raising children who grow up <br/>
to embrace your values and outlook on life?&quot; That&#39;s what they <br/>
believe they are doingkeeping their children in contact with <br/>
like-minded families so that their values will be passed on.<br/>

<br/>
To term it &quot;lifestyle&quot; is a pejorative term.  Benign-style, yet still <br/>
dismissive.  I know you were quoting their rhetoric, though.  If someone&#39;s urges and <br/>
interests are &quot;wrong,&quot; he can at least avoid sin by being as asexual as <br/>
possible, and not participate in relationships.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The biggest proponents of the <br/>

<br/>
learning rather than school so that each peson can become fully <br/>
<br/>
the peson God intended rather than what the system intends.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some of that too, but I wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;unschooling lifestyle,&quot; <br/>
since they&#39;re willing for natural learning to occur only within a closed system.<br/>
<br/>
Their &quot;learning from the real world&quot; is a terrarium world, limited to <br/>
Christian influences, Christian literature, Christian results.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know there are lots of conservative Christians who don&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
unschool, don&#39;t agree with unschooling and don&#39;t understand <br/>
<br/>
unschooling. But I have yet to find anyone who says it is &quot;sinful.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Website quotes.  Allowing children to &quot;rule the roost&quot; (and other <br/>
unflattering portrayals) is failure to take the reins and rule our children as God <br/>
commanded.  Letting children make choices is sinful.  Not requiring obedience is <br/>
sinful.  Not teaching is sinful.  Not raising children as Christians is sinful.  <br/>
Being &quot;human they believe what they hold to be true <br/>
<br/>
makes sense.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand why they believe what they believe.  I have several times <br/>
defended proselytizing, and explained to people who say &quot;Why don&#39;t they just drop <br/>
it?&quot; that those with a NEED to witness would consider it cruel to turn and not <br/>
even bother to try to tell another person that they were in danger in imminent <br/>
and eternal damnation.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why do people think <br/>
<br/>
that way about themselves when other groups see them as <br/>
<br/>
hostile, undermining and cruel?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because that&#39;s how people are, and always have been, and always will be.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sexuality is so core to who we are that it seems we can&#39;t treat it <br/>
<br/>
with the same dispassionate distance that it deserves.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why would it not be central and core?   Just the way people address you and <br/>
refer to you has to do with gender.  The way people choose friends (or are <br/>
allowed to have friends visit) has to do with their sexual assignation.  And it IS <br/>
&quot;assignation.&quot;  If a baby has visible male genitals, it&#39;s &quot;a boy,&quot; and &quot;he&quot; <br/>
and wears blue.  But if it&#39;s later discovered that otherwise he has female <br/>
biochemistry, he&#39;s chosen a bad lifestyle?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a problem, and can&#39;t be just &quot;distanced&quot; so easily by those so strongly <br/>
affected.<br/>
