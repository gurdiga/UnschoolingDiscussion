<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109552196">My mom called me about a year or so ago to share an article that coached<br/>
parents who have to take the opposite sex older child to a public restroom<br/>
(ie the parent can&#39;t enter with child or in some cases can&#39;t bring child<br/>
into their restroom) to have the children count the entire time they are in<br/>
the restroom with the parent listening at the open door. If the child<br/>
*stops* counting, the parent can move quickly. The article said that<br/>
children who are told to scream or yell if there was a problem would never<br/>
get the chance to do so. So far, at 7, ds doesn&#39;t mind coming into the<br/>
lady&#39;s room with me, and enough parents are concerned that it&#39;s no big deal<br/>
to other women in the restroom either - yet... in fact, I have women come up<br/>
to me fairly regularly and say they bring their 6,7,8 yr old into the ladies<br/>
room also, and they enjoy seeing another mom do the same!<br/>

&gt; We live in an area I feel is very safe, very rural, yet we still have the<br/>
&gt; inevitable bathroom problems.  Some places I&#39;m fine with him going alone to<br/>
&gt; the men&#39;s room, others no way.  Some are okay if I&#39;m waiting outside but not<br/>
&gt; if I&#39;m in the other restroom and can&#39;t watch.  AND, without &quot;drawing him a<br/>
&gt; picture&quot; I&#39;ve told him mean/bad guys sometimes look for kids in the bathroom,<br/>
&gt; that he should never touch anyone or let anyone touch him and that he should<br/>
&gt; shout NO! if anyone scares him.  BUT, he still hates going to the ladies&#39; room<br/>
&gt; when I am not comfortable....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But I gotta be MOM and take care of him the best I can.<br/>

I sometimes find signs on the doors of public loos <br/>
saying that children of the opposite sex can&#39;t come in <br/>
if they&#39;re over a certain age.  I seem to think there&#39;s <br/>
a &#39;public decency&#39; law about it, now I come to think.  <br/>
I&#39;ll have to go ask the UK list...<br/>

I have never seen such a sign here in the US.  I have lived in Virginia, Kansas, California, Oregon, Washington, and New Mexico, and have visted quite a few other states.  We have laws about kids not even being able to EAT in restaurant/bars (pubs) in many states, but not regarding kids in the rest rooms.<br/>
