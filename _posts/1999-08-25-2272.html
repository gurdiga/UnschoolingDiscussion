<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927777828">Hi all,<br/>
I am relatively new to the list and to homeschooling.� First things, first.� I&#39;m Andi in Georgia, SAHM to one 5 1/2 girl, married for 14 years.� I like the term of unschooling because I believe a person can be taught without being &quot;in a school&quot;.� After all what is on the job training?<br/>
�<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; OK, for all of you musical geniuses out there, I hanve always wanted to<br/>
&gt; play the flute, piano and folk guitar.� It will probaby have to wait a bit,<br/>
&gt; as I have a LOT going on right now, but when I get ready where should I<br/>
&gt; start?� Should I get lessons, get books or just get instruments and start<br/>
&gt; playing?� What do you (already-been-there-done-that-folks) think?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know that it may not be a popular stance today, but why are people having children if they are trying to unload them?� Don&#39;t get me wrong I am very liberal and I believe in choices, but I see too many children suffer at parents selfish ways.� I think it is wonderful that parents today have choices in how to educate and raise their kids.� I understand that many parents can not and do not want the responsibility of educating their kids full time-I hope these parents realize they are still educating their kids when they are at home.� The excuse that the parent has to work is not a legitimate one-I know people who do have to support the family and still homeschool.� Sorry, just my 2 cents!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; Eventually, it came down to what I think is the real reason for my SIL -<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; �feels like she would be giving up her life and she doesn&#39;t want to do that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wonder what makes that a consideration for some? I always felt that my life<br/>
&gt; WAS a mother. I&#39;ve had a similar discussion with my sis-in-laws and it<br/>
&gt; shocked me that some people feel it&#39;s their right to be able to &quot;unload&quot;<br/>
&gt; their children on the schools. I truly hope that I will instill in my<br/>
&gt; children a sense of duty when it comes to family and move away from the<br/>
&gt; selfishness that seems so prevalent today (even if it is disguised as<br/>
&gt; financial need. You know,&quot; I need to send the kids to school so I can work&quot;).<br/>
&gt; Blessings. Lori in TX<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree and just to restate, I am speaking of parents who are &quot;unloading&quot; the kids on someone else.� Not the countless parents who are providing the best home and care environment for their kids regardless of stay at home status or not.� I do applaud those parents who work outside the home and still manage to give parenting their all--I do not know how they manage it, but they do every single day:)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As much as I love being a SAHM, I would not force it on anyone else and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like seeing it used as a wedge between mothers who are all probably just<br/>
&gt; trying to do their best -- as they perceive it and as they are able.� I&#39;m not<br/>
&gt; trying to attack you personally Lori, or anyone else who agrees with you, I<br/>
&gt; just think it is unnecessary to perpetuate this divisive issue between<br/>
&gt; mothers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nance<br/>
&gt; �<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Enough of my rambling and thoughts.� Have a great day and smile.<br/>
Andi</div>
