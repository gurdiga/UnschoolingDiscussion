<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054141745">They just told my husband that they are making him go to Germany even though <br/>
he is getting out of the army in 2 years...they told him he either has to go <br/>
alone for 2 years, or re-enlist and we can go with him.... This sucks so <br/>
bad. We wanna buy a house and get out of the army....not go to Germany. I <br/>
dont understand how they can make him go when he doesnt have enough time to <br/>
meet the required tour. Its a 3 year tour... he gets out in 2 years...<br/>
<br/>
I am so mad!!!<br/>
<br/>
I know Germany will be cool and pretty and an awesome homeschooling <br/>
oppertunity (sp) but damn it, this sucks big time... they want us to move in <br/>
7 days.....<br/>
theres no way!!!!!!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757741266">HUGS!!! Wendy, I SOOOOO understand!!! I grew up military (in fact, I spent time at the now closed 19th Army General Hospital in Frankfurt). Best thing I can suggest is to re-up and be with him, look at it as an adventure and enjoy it!! <br/>
 <br/>
Wow...7 days?! That&#39;s some SERIOUS short-timing!!! Had there been a possibility of this transfer or is it truly out of the blue? I&#39;m more familiar with the Navy and Coast Guard, so I&#39;m just wondering.<br/>
 <br/>
By the way..when my mother was offered the job in Bermuda (working civil-service for the Navy&#39;s fire department as a fire inspector)..they called on Friday, gave her 24 hours to decide and 48 hours to get there. She needed to start work on Monday. We got home from camp that day, she asked our opinions...we were all for it...and she called my dad and said &quot;Come get the kids, I&#39;ll call you when I have a house for us.&quot; Saturday afternoon we were living in Virginia Beach, Sunday the movers packed our stuff and put it in storage. <br/>

airports and ask about it, they do need special papers from the vets etc.  <br/>
They made it just fine. Maybe you have a friend where you are now that could help <br/>
out.<br/>
