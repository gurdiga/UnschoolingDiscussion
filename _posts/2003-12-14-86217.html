&lt;&lt; If you were quoting me, it&#39;d probably sound like, &quot;I don&#39;t believe <br/>
<br/>
the Bible is literally true but I don&#39;t want to admit it to myself <br/>
<br/>
yet. ;) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kelly send me a packet she got advertising a &quot;Creation Conference&quot; being held <br/>
in South Carolina.  In the cover letter it says &quot;The importance of the <br/>
account of Creation and its ramifications can hardly be over emphasized.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What that means is that they think if they can prove THAT is true, it proves <br/>
everything else in the Bible is true.   That is some lame and twisted logic, <br/>
but when people base their entire lives on the premise that by faith they <br/>
believe the Bible is true, there&#39;s hardly another foothold.  If the world was NOT <br/>
made in seven days, maybe Jesus isn&#39;t coming back, and they&#39;ve been living <br/>
lives of deprivation and guilt for no good reason.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I rented a DVD and watched it, called &quot;Devil&#39;s Playground,&quot; about <br/>
Amish teens taking their prescribed break to experiment with the &quot;english&quot; <br/>
world before they decide whether to be Amish themselves or not, since that <br/>
religion is based on NOT allowing for infant Baptism, but only having responsible <br/>
people who understand what they&#39;re commiting to join the church.    Because once <br/>
you commit it&#39;s stay for life or be shunned.   So at 16 kids go out and be <br/>
while a while (or they stay and be wild, partying and drinking in the barn at <br/>
night).   It was sad, and too rough to watch with little kids (drug situation and <br/>
bad language), but it was another instance of people basing their lives on <br/>
something besides the inherent value and goodness of people, and the extreme <br/>
effect it has on anyone who can&#39;t relax and fit in.  Yet one of the details was <br/>
that nearly 90% come back and join the church--the highest figure since the <br/>
religion was established in the late 1600s.<br/>
<br/>
They live on this earth to earn a place in Heaven.  That&#39;s it.<br/>

<br/>
But not all people who believe in a literal Bible live their lives being <br/>
deprived or full of guilt. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same as saying all unschoolers live wonderful carefree joyous days, <br/>
doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
Too general, again using strokes too wide and bold when referring to people <br/>
who believe in the Bible and live Christian lives.<br/>

The &quot;they&quot; to whom I was referring was the creationist so determined to prove <br/>
creationism for their critical purpose, and the Amish.<br/>
<br/>
Both groups are involved in deprivation and guilt.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t talking about people to whom what I was discussing didn&#39;t occur.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico a lot of people live in adobe houses.  If I write talking about <br/>
adobe houses in New Mexico, it won&#39;t be helpful for someone to write and say <br/>
not everyone in New Mexico lives in an adobe house.  <br/>

<br/>
Has anyone said all unschoolers live/do/are ANY one thing?<br/>
If someone makes a statement about their own family, why generalize that to <br/>
&quot;all&quot;?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Had I been refering to everyone living a Christian life, perhaps you would be <br/>
right, but I wasn&#39;t.  I quoted and I made specific reference.<br/>
