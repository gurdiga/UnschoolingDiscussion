<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093621952">Sandra, I realize I made a mistake so I have rewritten the subject line<br/>
from &quot;unschooler at school&quot; to &quot;Unschooler&#39;s child at school&quot;<br/>
I am the &quot;unschooler&quot;  not  my child.  Sorry to mislead.<br/>
<br/>
Is that why you thought there was a &quot;disconnect&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I agree Sandra, it is very interesting.  I waited this long to share<br/>
the story because I didn&#39;t know it was going to last long enough<br/>
to have a story to tell.<br/>
To answer your questions:<br/>
She is an only child, never attended school before 1st grade, age 7.<br/>
We did not do any curriculum or &quot;educational&quot; study.<br/>
Our days closely related the ones that you and others described on this<br/>
board.<br/>
TV, legos, drawing, cards, acting....<br/>
<br/>
Other info: She has an equal amount of homeschooling friends and<br/>
school friends and plays with friends from both at least once a week.<br/>
<br/>
When she started the semester she always wanted to be there even<br/>
getting there early and staying late for other activities they offered.<br/>
A day lasted 7:30 AM to 6 PM.  Burned herself out in about two months.<br/>
Now she is there from 8:15 AM to 2 PM. Lately she has taken off a few<br/>
hours or a day or two.<br/>
<br/>
I am not going to predict the outcome because as everyone has said to me<br/>
about her attending school  &quot;HUH??!! she would have been the last kid I<br/>
ever<br/>
thought would want to go to school!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does her decision sometimes worry me? Sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If she wants to quit, she knows she can. If she wanted to see how a<br/>
farm works, I would arrange for a farm stay, I don&#39;t see this as any<br/>
different.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting for the mom to identify as an unschooler and for the<br/>
child<br/>
to have gone to school day 1 of first grade.<br/>
<br/>
The analogy of visiting a farm is interesting, but she seems to have<br/>
gone to<br/>
live at the farm.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand the philosophical basis, but there really is a<br/>
disconnect if<br/>
a person&#39;s kid is in school!  Aleksi, do you have other school age<br/>
children<br/>
not in school?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;By the way, she was 7 yrs and 2 months  old when she started 1st grade<br/>
in September.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She had been homeschooled for a couple of years and wanted to try first<br/>
grade?<br/>
Really interesting!<br/>
