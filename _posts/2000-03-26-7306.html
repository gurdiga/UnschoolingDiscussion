<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186382138">&lt;&lt;My step-grandfather was Russian, and my mother gave my brothers and me Russian names. It&#39;s actually of Greek derivation, originally, meaning &quot;blessed&quot;. Thanks-I hope your daughter enjoys the name! There seem to be more Kiras around of late, although when I was growing up, I was the only one I had ever heard of!<br/>

Interesting background--I knew the novel was set in Russia, but I was led to believe from other sources that the derivation was Persian, meaning &quot;sun&quot;. I like &quot;blessed&quot; a lot more! Kira loves her name, but does NOT like the idea that Kiras are popping up all over the place! She&#39;s 20, and used to feel like the only one. Our other daughter&#39;s name is Bryn, and the same thing seems to be happening....<br/>
