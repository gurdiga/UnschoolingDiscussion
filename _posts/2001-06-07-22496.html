&lt;&lt; Free and clear means they owned the property free and clear, no mortgages.<br/>
 The government taxes property each year but that has nothing to do with the<br/>
 property being &quot;free and clear.&quot;  If the husband hadn&#39;t been ill they could<br/>
 have taken a loan out on the property but they couldn&#39;t get anyone to do<br/>
 that either.  The county wasn&#39;t interested in helping, the county was only<br/>
 interested in getting the property into the hands of a developer in order to<br/>
 increase the tax base.<br/>
 <br/>
 The county is currently being investigated and, and I believe one lawsuit<br/>
 has been filed.  I also understand from dil&#39;s brother (he lives not far from<br/>
 there) that nepotism is part of this--someone in government has relatives<br/>
 that are part of the folks that want to develop all this lake front<br/>
 property. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   <br/>
   You still have to pay your taxes or make arrangements. Maybe there is <br/>
something fishy going on in the county I don&#39;t know. Also small town talk <br/>
really does get a lot of incorrect info. maybe your dil&#39;s brother is right. <br/>
Even details from one person removed from the source changes and then it <br/>
rolls. So I am not sure we will ever really know what went on here. Also will <br/>
we hear the truth from either side? I doubt it since each side wants to look <br/>
good. It is all speculation at this point.<br/>
<br/>
   From another post asking about gun handling........Yes I was taught gun <br/>
safety and handling. But I have been in some homes where there are guns <br/>
everywhere. Propped up against doors and outside and in bedrooms. To me this <br/>
is dangerous.</div>

 </span></blockquote>***Another very big leap!  The question was asked &quot;have you ever been bit or<br/>
chased by a dog intent on harming you.&quot;  Before the creative editing, the<br/>
balance of the response that was left out was in response to that question.<br/>
This portion was in response to a question might conceivably follow the<br/>
post.  We know that bicycling can be a dangerous &quot;sport.&quot;  We know that far<br/>
too many people don&#39;t have the sense god gave road kill and let their<br/>
animals roam at will.  Therefore, we have taken what measures we can to help<br/>
ensure the safety of the kidlets.<br/>
<br/>
The above response &quot;Good for him, good for you. So what?&quot; is childish!<br/>
<br/>
Nor did anyone say or even vaguely imply that &quot;dangerous&quot; dogs should be<br/>
allowed to run loose.<br/>
<br/>
Nor did anyone say or imply that &quot;anyone who gets bit has only themselves to<br/>
blame.&quot;  Although, if one is trespassing, then they do have only themselves<br/>
to blame.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-998879322">I was just sharing the method we had come up with to make bicycing a little<br/>
safer.  We happen to live in an area where quite a few folks who lived in<br/>
the city have moved to &quot;to get away from it all&quot; and have brought their<br/>
problems with them.  I really don&#39;t understand the rational that keeping a<br/>
dog confined to the owners property is cruel or &quot;we moved to the country so<br/>
our animals could be free.&quot;  hey, I&#39;m all for freedom, just keep them &quot;free&quot;<br/>
on your own land.<br/>
