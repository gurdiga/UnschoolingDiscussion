 </span></blockquote>Hi Donna.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I like to tell moms about report writing is that the work <br/>
ought to be in this ratio: 90% research and 10% writing. The only <br/>
reason schools ask kids to write reports is to teach them library <br/>
and reasearch skills. Really. If they were interested in the kids <br/>
learning content, then they would assign the content (in junior <br/>
high, they sometimes do, but in elementary school they almost <br/>
never do). But usually the elementary school report is about a <br/>
favorite planet, state, historical figure or movie star. &lt;g&gt; The <br/>
content isn&#39;t the primary focus. It&#39;s an opportunity to learn how to <br/>
use a card catalog, find books, read and summarize info and put <br/>
it together in an attractive format.<br/>
<br/>
When kids or moms want to do school-style reports, I suggest <br/>
focusing on the fun aspects of research. Call places for <br/>
brochures or flyers or books. Use email and the Internet top <br/>
collect data. Keep notes on file cards and sort them by topic.<br/>
<br/>
Organize your report by identifying the four or five main areas to <br/>
research and report. Give the report a voice/focus. Will she write <br/>
from the biographical perspective or from the perspective of how <br/>
the historical peson fit into a historical time period? Will she <br/>
write about a state as a travel advisor or as someone interested <br/>
in buisness and commerce?<br/>
<br/>
In the end, the writing of the report ought to be the least <br/>
emphasized aspect of the experience. And here&#39;s one very good <br/>
reason why (one that is overlooked in schools). Report writing is <br/>
notoriously bad writing. Oh, it may be grammatically correct and <br/>
organized well, but it is usually as dull as a doormat to read. We <br/>
don&#39;t want to train our children to think that writing is meant to put <br/>
people to sleep. Writing is meant to enliven the reader! Reports <br/>
almost never do.<br/>
<br/>
In keeping with the goal of lots of research and minimal writing, I <br/>
suggest a couple ways to spruce up the writing side of report <br/>
writing. Start with an anecdote, if at all possible. If your child is <br/>
writing about the state of Michigan and has a grandparent there, <br/>
share a brief memory of visiting the state. If the child is writing <br/>
about Pluto, start the report with the most mysterious, surprising <br/>
facts he or she uncovered. If writing about a historical figure, start <br/>
with a little known story that leads the reader to discover (to her <br/>
surprise) that this report is about ________.<br/>
<br/>
Work on an opening hook to relieve the report of the dull tone it <br/>
will inevitably take. Use subheads so that you can organize the <br/>
material. And only ask your child to write about the aspects of the <br/>
topic that keenly interest her. (No need to include the <br/>
precipitation measurements if weather doesn&#39;t impress her.) But <br/>
be sure to include which famous musicians or movie stars live <br/>
in Michigan or what cartoon characters were named after that <br/>
planet and why!<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line: I think the school report is totally unnecessary for <br/>
kids who spend a load of time at the library placing books on <br/>
hold, who can locate whatever they need in an encyclopedia or <br/>
magazine and who read voraciously on any topic of interest. I&#39;d <br/>
rather put my &quot;teachihng writing&quot; efforts toward writing that zings! <br/>
Writing that speaks and lives and enhances the reader&#39;s <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s not the only reason.  They want kids to organize thoughts and <br/>
to write exposition.  They want kids to learn the difference between <br/>
paraphrase and plagiarism.  And they want &quot;work&quot; to show the parents.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Bottom line: I think the school report is totally unnecessary&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unless one is writing for others (or for a journal entry or diary) there is <br/>
NO reason in the whole world to write a report.  To &quot;practice&quot; writing when <br/>
real writing is immediately useful and ... real!<br/>

I&#39;ll agree about work to show their parents. But I have to say that <br/>
they do a lousy job of teaching paraphrasing. And plagiarism is <br/>
about all you&#39;ll find in most school reports.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of oral and written narration as explained by <br/>
Charlotte Mason is more on track with teaching children how to <br/>
summarize and express in their own words what they are <br/>
learning. Sending kids to non-fiction books and telling them to <br/>
take notes is almost a guarantee they&#39;ll plagiarise and who can <br/>
blame them? What&#39;s a teacher to do with thirty boring essays to <br/>
grade? :)<br/>
