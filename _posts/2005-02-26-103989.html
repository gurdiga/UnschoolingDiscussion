<div id="ygrps-yiv-339244787">Hi Friends,<br/>
<br/>
Even though I have been a member of this group for over a year I <br/>
don&#39;t post much, but I do read many of the threads that I find of <br/>
great interest.  <br/>
<br/>
The last time I posted it was about President Andrew Johnson (Also, <br/>
the VP of Lincoln) not learning to read or write until his WIFE <br/>
taught him at the age of 19.<br/>
<br/>
My encouragement to you all this time is Wilson Rawls, author <br/>
of &quot;Where the Red Fern Grows.&quot;  His mother did most of education <br/>
with the exception of a few years of Junior High and then he dropped <br/>
out in 8th grade.  To read more go to:<br/>

<br/>
This is another story of a wife encouraging and helping her husband <br/>
meet his desire to learn when the time came in his life that he was <br/>
ready and able to.  <br/>
<br/>
I came across his book recently and my children adore it.  I try to <br/>
make it an effort to read to our children during or after lunch time <br/>
and it has become a family favorite.<br/>
<br/>
When I read about his life, I was inspired because I have a 10 year <br/>
old son who struggles with reading and writing, but can narrate <br/>
great stories.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this also give some of you encouragement as well.<br/>
