&gt;&gt;  Just to add to this discussion.....my 13yo son&#39;s best friend is<br/>
&gt;&gt; only allowed one hour of what his parents deem &quot;screen time&quot;.  In<br/>
&gt;&gt; other words, one hour of either computer, nintendo, TV, or gameboy<br/>
&gt;&gt; per day.  My son has free access to all of these things.  My son&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; friend NEVER wants to be at home....always wants to come over<br/>
&gt;&gt; here....and he marvels at how much &quot;fun&quot; we all seem to have<br/>
&gt;&gt; together.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; we find that if you give free access, be it to tv, sugar, whatever it<br/>
&gt; no longer rules their life and they tend to make better decisions.<br/>
&gt; just a thought<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have no limits on tv or computer in our house, either as to content<br/>
or time.  My wife and I watch MUCH more tv than either of our kids, and<br/>
I use the computer a lot more.  We have simply, and over time, provided<br/>
them with much more interesting things to do in the house, and they&#39;ve<br/>
taken them on as their own.  Last night, I invited both kids in to watch<br/>
the Westminster Dog Show -- they both loved it, of course, but they&#39;d<br/>
never even have bothered to check the tv schedule, no less turn on the<br/>
tv if I hadn&#39;t told them.<br/>
<br/>
At some point, you have to give kids the freedom to exercise<br/>
responsibility. Without freedom, responsibility simply has no meaning,<br/>
for there is no responsibility without the choice to be irresponsible.<br/>
Learning which is which is a lot of what childhood is about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437391596">Hi David,<br/>
We are watching right now, and were watching last night.  The kids are<br/>
loving it.<br/>
I&#39;m sure they will ball be up until the end.  They are 7, 5 and 3.<br/>
What wonderful TV, too bad we can&#39;t get rid of commercials.<br/>
