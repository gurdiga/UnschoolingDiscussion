offer advice, &quot;defend&quot; me,  commisserate with me because they are in similar <br/>
situations, but I have never, NEVER asked anyone for &quot;back up&quot;  or to come to <br/>
my defense.    I&#39;ve been told more than once ( in real life).. that I have <br/>
&quot;balls of steel&quot;  For a lady, thats quite a statement .. But the truth is, I <br/>
say what I mean and I can stand up for myself.  If others agree.. fine and <br/>
well, and I appreciate thier support.. But I dont seek them out or rally them <br/>
to my defense.  Ive been accused of this before and its simply not true.  The <br/>
fact that ther are others of like mind does not mean that I summonsed them up <br/>
to gang up on you.  They come forward of thier own accord.   And, I would say <br/>
there are far far more of them that dont actually come forward out of <br/>
intimidation and fear of recourse.<br/>
