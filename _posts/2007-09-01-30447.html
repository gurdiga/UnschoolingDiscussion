<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118933234">UNSCHOOLERS WINTER WATERPARK GATHERING<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first UWWG (Unschoolers Winter Waterpark Gathering) will be at the<br/>
Kalahari Resort in Sandusky, Ohio;  January 21 - 24 ( Mon - Thurs). <br/>
They&#39;re giving us super discounted rates that will be good whether you<br/>
decide to come for 1 or all 4 nights!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Kalahari Waterpark Resort is the premier in waterpark resorts in the<br/>
country.  When their addition is completed in December, they&#39;ll be the<br/>
largest indoor waterpark in the USA ( 173,000sq. ft of indoor<br/>
waterpark).  The Kalahari is like a mini village with 881 rooms, a full<br/>
spa, several restaurants, gift shops, a candy shop, live African animals<br/>
on display, putt-putt, giant game room and more.  Their waterpark<br/>
includes everything from lazy river rides and a wave pool for surfing<br/>
and boogie boarding, to giant slides and thrilling water coasters.  They<br/>
also have an activities coordinator (kind of like Julie on the<br/>
&quot;Love-boat&quot;) who will work with us to organize activities from crafts to<br/>
movie nights).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
