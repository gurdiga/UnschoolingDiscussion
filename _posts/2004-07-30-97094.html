<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028168800"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If you have a history that could use a more particular slant, you can<br/>
&gt; probably find it by google (if you had an alcoholic parent, or some kind of<br/>
&gt; past <br/>
&gt; problems or recovery needs), but to replace the voices in your head, you just<br/>
&gt; need <br/>
&gt; more soothing, helpful voices.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just got a little book that seems very positive and helpful:<br/>
<br/>
Meditations for Mothers of Toddlers by Beth Wilson Saavedra.<br/>
<br/>
It has a famous person quote at the top, a paragraph or two about a<br/>
struggle, then an affirmation, for example:  To treat my child with dignity,<br/>
I must keep my own intact.<br/>
or:<br/>
I will trust in my own abilities as I mother two very different individuals.<br/>
