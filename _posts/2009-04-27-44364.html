<div id="ygrps-yiv-2117189822">So I just wanted to share my crazy, wonderful night with my almost 3 yo daughter. I have shared sleep concerns before and we are still in the midst of some crazy patterns. But I am doing my best to embrace them! So she fell asleep at 8 pm in her stroller for what we thought was the night... oh no, she woke up a little before 9, wide awake and ready to go!!! oops... ;-) So I knew I had a long night ahead of me.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest thing is making the shift mentally to what is actually happening, from what you thought you were going to have. My husband and I were looking forward to &quot;adult&quot; time, icecream, TV, and maybe a little earlier bedtime. <br/>
<br/>
Instead I got 4 hours of crazy playtime! Beads all over the floor, loads of imaginary friends (hyenas!), oobleck, painting, cleaning in the sink, ice cream cone at 11 pm, bath at 12:30 am, and finally asleep at 1:15 (which actually didn&#39;t seem that bad!)And once I got over my mental hurdles it was actually tons of fun :-) Most of my family and friends can&#39;t believe that of course!<br/>
<br/>
I have just been feeling so happy and grateful for my life today and it is spilling over to the computer.... And Marisol is happy with her &quot;mini-monkey platter&quot; and her TV shows. And that is good because it is hot and sticky here! <br/>
<br/>
I have more happy, grateful thoughts to Unshcooling, Sandra, and all the people on this list on my blog if anyone wants to read:<br/>

Life has not been without its challenges lately - family, being a pregnant mama to a vivacious almost 3 yo girl etc - but mostly my life view is just so good right now, in large part to things I am learning on this list. So thanks to all!</div>

The top photo will be a little smaller later, if it isn&#39;t already.  It  <br/>
will be the same size as the lower photo, and the margins won&#39;t be so  <br/>
wide.<br/>
<br/>
I put one of the photos and part of the story here, too:<br/>

I love these stories of kids choosing foods most people think kids  <br/>
won&#39;t eat unless they&#39;re forced or bribed to.   Choice is wonderful!!!<br/>
