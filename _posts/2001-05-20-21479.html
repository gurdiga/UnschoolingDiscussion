<div id="ygrps-yiv-133548859">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping someone can tell me if there&#39;s any way to prevent my comet cursor <br/>
from automatically installing itself on my computer whenever I visit a <br/>
website that is using it. I&#39;m getting tired of having to reboot every time I <br/>
remove it using the add/remove program utility - I&#39;d rather keep it off in <br/>
the first place! If anyone knows how to do this, please write me offlist. I <br/>
will be most appreciative!<br/>
<br/>
