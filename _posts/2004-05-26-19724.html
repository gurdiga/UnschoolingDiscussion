<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139365470">I see that exposure to experiences does not in itself provide the <br/>
child with tools to deal with an experience. However, I think there <br/>
is a difference between being &quot;upset&quot; or &quot;frightened&quot;  by something <br/>
and being &quot;damaged&quot; by it. <br/>
<br/>
Having someone put their finger in an orafice as a child doesn&#39;t make <br/>
it the childs&#39; fault certainly, nor does it &quot;damage&quot; them anymore <br/>
than getting a shot. The difference is in whether they have the <br/>
support available to be listened to in order to avoid it or <br/>
understand it in the future. The key, I think is whether the child <br/>
has the ability or resources (i.e. parents&#39; support or other <br/>
advocate) to prevent or avoid it in the future IF the child wishes. <br/>
<br/>
Having no one or no advocate to which one can go for support is what <br/>
makes it damaging. Worse yet is if one&#39;s &quot;advocate&quot; is the source. <br/>
Having the feeling of being &quot;upset&quot; or &quot;frightened&quot; and recognizing <br/>
this in oneself is powerful information upon which to act in the <br/>
future IF you have the choice to do so. Listening to a child&#39;s <br/>
reactions and allowing him to be in charge of himself, does empower <br/>
him. <br/>
<br/>
Similarly, I am responsible to model setting limits for myself. These <br/>
nuances are new for me. I am trying to be aware so that I am <br/>
not &quot;permissive&quot; and disreguarding my own boundaries while allowing <br/>
my child to be &quot;in charge&quot; of himself. This is a challenge since I am <br/>
reacting to having had limited oportunities to set boundaries for <br/>
myself in childhood. However, this is exactly why I do embrace &quot;my <br/>
child is his own boss&quot;.</div>
