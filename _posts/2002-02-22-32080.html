<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464360759">Hi everyone. I&#39;ve been lurking for a few hours. I&#39;m on a few lists <br/>
for unschooling but am stumped as to why I haven&#39;t joined this one <br/>
earlier. <br/>
<br/>
A short intro (I promise):<br/>
<br/>
My name is Christine (27), dh Christopher (30), and we are <br/>
unschooling two boys in NJ. Aiden 4.5 and Max Ronin 2. We&#39;ve been <br/>
unschooling since...ever since... Minus Aiden&#39;s short stint at a <br/>
montessori preschool--when at that time, I thought I was making the <br/>
best desicions. After listening to Aiden, I realized homeschooling <br/>
would be a better option for us but wasn&#39;t sold on the idea <br/>
of &quot;school at home&quot;. It really put me off and I had wished we could <br/>
just use what came naturally to us...learning through living. When <br/>
voila! I came across unschooling.com and all our dreams came true =) <br/>
Unschooling goes beyond an &quot;educational method&quot; for us, it&#39;s our <br/>
lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
So now it&#39;s time for my question:<br/>
<br/>
Dh is a very hands on kind of dad. During the weekends though, I <br/>
*wish* that he would take more initiative into coming up with cool <br/>
ideas of things we could possibly do as a family. Everyone in the <br/>
house is pretty much used to me coming up with ideas. Ideas like <br/>
going to the park, shopping, boardwalk, visiting friends/family, fun <br/>
projects, etc. We don&#39;t limit anything--we really let the kids just <br/>
naturally flow. Sometimes their natural flow leads them to watching <br/>
hours of tv which I don&#39;t mind. However, I don&#39;t see anything wrong <br/>
with saying &quot;Hey guys, wanna make a fort outside? Wanna make <br/>
something out of clay? Anyone want to come with me to the park?&quot; Most <br/>
times, the boys will 86 the tv and be more than willing to do <br/>
something else. Dh loves to lounge with them on weekends in front of <br/>
the tv, pc, or varying video game consoles. Again, I don&#39;t mind this <br/>
but at the same time...*should* I expect dh to initiate more? <br/>
*Should* I just leave him be and continue to be the sole &quot;initiator&quot; <br/>
of other fun things to do? Dh also isn&#39;t into &quot;floor play&quot; like he <br/>
doesn&#39;t play with them and their toys or role play. He does different <br/>
stuff with them mostly conversation, cuddling, reading, tecno <br/>
stuff, ... Am I &quot;expecting&quot; too much? Or being too persnippity? Is <br/>
what Dh does with the kids enough? See. I don&#39;t want to make dh be <br/>
someone he is not. I don&#39;t want to &quot;diss&quot; his parenting style. So <br/>
basically I am looking for advice, suggestions, your experience, <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504339298">---Hey Christine,<br/>
Ren here...haven&#39;t seen you for a while!! How are things at the <br/>
Oxygen boards? Tell Frances I said Hi.<br/>
I can relate to your struggle. But after 15 years of being with dh, <br/>
12 of which we&#39;ve been parents, I have realized that we each offer <br/>
different things to our children. Not better or worse, just different.<br/>
He loves playing board games...I have to be convinced, he loves doing <br/>
active stuff outdoors with them, I&#39;m better at coming up with fun <br/>
activities, projects or outings.<br/>
If he is involved and you are a happy family, I say just accept your <br/>
differences and enjoy them!<br/>
There is nothing wrong with one person being more of the &quot;initiator&quot; <br/>
for activities. You are just better at it probably.<br/>
Now if you&#39;re feeling resentful at being the one to always do this, <br/>
then it&#39;s worth discussing with him. But I have found acceptance to <br/>
be a great thing in our marriage.<br/>
I have learned to really value what he contributes, as different as <br/>
we are sometimes.<br/>
And I think it&#39;s great to offer activities,outings or ideas as much <br/>
as you want...as long as &quot;No thanks&quot; is a definite option for them <br/>
(which I can&#39;t imagine you wouldn&#39;t be open too!).<br/>
Keep with the flow...it&#39;s working right?<br/>
I sometimes get the &quot;comparisonitis&quot; problem when I see these Dads <br/>
that ALWAYS come on outings or to park days and wonder why my dh <br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy that kind of thing.<br/>
But the way we are works for us. I really don&#39;t mind him not coming <br/>
on all of our noisy outings....I just can&#39;t compare him to other <br/>
Dads. We are unique, and I love what he offers to our children.<br/>
Good to have you here.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d agree with Ren that that&#39;s just the type of guy he is. I suspect that it<br/>
isn&#39;t that he depends on you to find things to do so much as it isn&#39;t a top<br/>
priority with him. Perhaps he enjoys going along on activities (if he does)<br/>
but sitting around with the family is just as enjoyable to him. If tractor<br/>
pulls were a top priority in your life you&#39;d probably go looking for them.<br/>
But I bet they&#39;re not and you&#39;re not ;-) Same with him and activities. How<br/>
could he persuade you to be more proactive in looking for tractor pulls (or<br/>
game software or curling on TV or anything you have no interest in) for the<br/>
family to do every weekend together?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He does different<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And lots of fathers don&#39;t even do that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Am I &quot;expecting&quot; too much? Or being too persnippity? Is<br/>
&gt; what Dh does with the kids enough?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes and yes and yes. As with unschooling kids, you can strew they&#39;re paths<br/>
with things you think they&#39;d like to do and things you think are important<br/>
but you can&#39;t make them pick the stuff up. You can help make it easier and<br/>
more fun for him to interact the way you&#39;d like him to, but you can&#39;t make<br/>
him unless he wants to do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583351475">My advice is be thankful he is a good father and allow nature to take its<br/>
course.  To try and mold him into your image of the father/teacher is to<br/>
do just what public school does to the student.  I hope this doesn&#39;t<br/>
sound harsh.  I&#39;m writing in a hurry.<br/>
