<div id="ygrps-yiv-775167833">I need some advice on what to do with my kiddos.  My kids are 8,7,5 and 8<br/>
months.  My concern is really with the older ones.  We have been unschooling<br/>
for a long time.  Though periodically we have tried using a curriculum, but<br/>
always stop after like 2 weeks.<br/>
My problem is that though my 8 year old does seek out some information, they<br/>
really just play most of the time.  I feel like I am not doing what it takes<br/>
to help them gain their education.  Do any of you have any suggestions for<br/>
me as far as encouraging learning without forcing it on them?<br/>
On a daily basis when the kids are doing nothing but playing pokemon cards<br/>
or pretending in some way, is there a way for me to suggest things to them?<br/>
I kind of feel lost and without a plan.<br/>
I am not sure if you even understand where my concern is, but I really do<br/>
need some advice.<br/>
What do you guys do on a daily basis to &quot;encourage&quot; learning?  Or do you do<br/>
nothing and hope that eventually the kids will come around and want to learn<br/>
something?<br/>
We do read to the kids regularly (when they will sit for it...and when they<br/>
won&#39;t...then what?)  Other than that, I am sitting around hoping they ask me<br/>
questions or want to learn or do something.<br/>
If I was to die today and my kids were put in public school, it would really<br/>
give homeschoolers a bad name.  My 8 year old is very smart, but doesn&#39;t<br/>
know alot.  He can read and write (in chicken scratch) and he can do basic<br/>
math like adding and subtracting and a little multiplying and he also does<br/>
algebra (as much as he can without knowing how to divide).  How do I go<br/>
about teaching him how to write and do math and science and stuff?  He<br/>
writes letters to his penpal, but his letters are very messy and hard to<br/>
read and they don&#39;t make sense.  For example, he will write &quot;hi how are you<br/>
doing?  I have a lizard and a snake.  I am sending you a pokemon card.<br/>
Bye.&quot;  And that is the extent of his letter.  I don&#39;t want to critisize his<br/>
efforts, but I certainly don&#39;t want him to write letters to someone that<br/>
make no sense.<br/>
My 7 year old, does nothing.  Has ZERO desire to learn anything or ask<br/>
questions or anything.  He can read, but not really good, and has basic math<br/>
skills like adding and subtracting.  He is a real brain child when it comes<br/>
to math, but won&#39;t do anything with it unless we make him sit down or he is<br/>
correcting his brother that made a mistake in something.<br/>
My 5 year old, once and a while will pull out a math workbook and do 2 or 3<br/>
weeks worth of math at a time, when he feels like it.  Other than that,<br/>
unless I tell him to sit down so we can do this or that, he won&#39;t do<br/>
anything.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I will stop now cause this is really long, but I wanted to kind of<br/>
give you guys a little detail so maybe someone can help address my concerns.<br/>
If you have any questions, please ask.  I really look forward to your<br/>
responses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve only been unschooling since the last time you stopped using a <br/>
curriculum.   If you keep trying a curriculum, you haven&#39;t DEschooled yourself yet, <br/>
and that&#39;s a preliminary to unschooling successfully.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Forget the idea of &quot;gaining an education.&quot;<br/>
Replace it with the idea of learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Do any of you have any suggestions for<br/>

<br/>
Thousands of them, but first read about deschooling and move quickly in that <br/>
direction:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
There are links to several people&#39;s deschooling summaries and suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-On a daily basis when the kids are doing nothing but playing pokemon cards<br/>
or pretending in some way, is there a way for me to suggest things to <br/>
them?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You need to learn to see the learning involved in playing pokemon and <br/>
make-believe.<br/>
Your kids are learning fine.   You&#39;re waiting for some kind of ghost of <br/>
school to appear.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do you guys do on a daily basis to &quot;encourage&quot; learning?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Live rich and busy and happy lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Or do you do nothing ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
EEEEEEK!!!   <br/>
<br/>
-=-We have been unschooling for a long time. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Please never say that again if you think unschoolers do nothing.   Please.   <br/>
Really.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Or do you do<br/>
nothing and hope that eventually the kids will come around and want to learn<br/>
something?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you believe the kids will only learn when they come around and ask you <br/>
questions or announce that they want to learn or do something, unschooling is <br/>
miles away from your experience.   But it can be right there, inside your house, <br/>
inside your self, between you and your kids.   You don&#39;t have to leave your <br/>
home to get it.   You WILL have to leave some of your ideas, though.   You&#39;ll <br/>
feel better when you start to see the learning that&#39;s already happening, though, <br/>
and figure out how to facilitate more and more of it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- How do I go about teaching him how to write and do math and science and <br/>
stuff?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You came to an unschooling discussion list, so you&#39;re not likely to get <br/>
advice about how to teach. <br/>
If you really want to teach them to do those things, buy a curriculum and do <br/>
school at home.<br/>
It won&#39;t work very well, and you&#39;ll all be unhappy. But if you want to learn <br/>
to unschool, drop all thought of teaching and turn toward learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534211677">** What do you guys do on a daily basis to &quot;encourage&quot; learning?**<br/>
<br/>
This is a timely question for me, as I&#39;ve been considering doing more <br/>
&quot;encouraging&quot; but need to figure out upside and the downside (especially <br/>
if I do it poorly).<br/>
<br/>
Have you read Frank Smith&#39;s book, titled _The Book of Learning and <br/>
Forgetting_.  That&#39;s pretty effective and shifting the reader away from <br/>
the conventional view of how learning happens.<br/>
<br/>
** We do read to the kids regularly (when they will sit for it...and <br/>
when they won&#39;t...then what?)**<br/>
<br/>
Are all of them begging you to stop?  Because if even one or two are <br/>
staying in the room, even if they are jumping up and down and twirling, <br/>
they could still be listening and enjoying the story.  It&#39;s okay if they <br/>
don&#39;t sit still.<br/>
<br/>
** My 5 year old, once and a while will pull out a math workbook and do <br/>
2 or 3<br/>
weeks worth of math at a time, when he feels like it.  Other than that,<br/>
unless I tell him to sit down so we can do this or that, he won&#39;t do<br/>
anything.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not enthusiastic about workbooks.  I think life presents other good <br/>
opportunities to learn.  At my house, games and videos seem to get a <br/>
good reception, and that includes games and videos about math.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827389067">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What do you guys do on a daily basis to &quot;encourage&quot; learning?  Or do<br/>
you do nothing and hope that eventually the kids will come around and want<br/>
to learn something?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you were to look at our life, you might consider it &quot;doing nothing&quot; since<br/>
I don&#39;t do anything that looks schoolish or like &quot;encouraging learning&quot;. It<br/>
is basically completely unnecessary and possibly counter-productive.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn needs absolutely zero encouragement to pursue her interests. She needs<br/>
no encouragement to learn about any number of fun and/or useful - to her -<br/>
topics. She needs no encouragement to practice skills like drawing, making<br/>
letters, hand stands or climbing the monkey bars, activities that are<br/>
important to her. She is an absolute whirlwind of energy except when she is<br/>
a quiet deep thinking ponderer. <br/>
<br/>
What I *do* is drive her places, arrange play dates and outings, read to her<br/>
whenever she wants, buy toys and art supplies, set her up on the computer<br/>
when she wants to play, set her up to make potions or help her do baking,<br/>
set up her dvd&#39;s or record tv shows, find answers to her questions on line<br/>
if I don&#39;t know the information, help her when she is emotionally<br/>
overwhelmed, act as an intermediary with her friends if she asks me for<br/>
assistance, and play various kinds of fantasy and practical games when<br/>
invited.<br/>
<br/>
The concept of &quot;encouraging learning&quot; can be problematic. I sense that this<br/>
is an occasion when the type of learning that you would wish to encourage<br/>
might be rather schoolish, in that it would resemble the separate subjects<br/>
and competence levels that you would expect to see in whatever grade your<br/>
children would be placed by age. It is easy to see &quot;reading&quot; or &quot;writing<br/>
letters&quot; as worthy of encouragement. Unfortunately this mind set all too<br/>
easily slides into considering other less obviously &quot;educational&quot; or<br/>
&quot;vocational&quot; interests as less worthy of encouragement and possibly even<br/>
that they should be dis-couraged.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Jayn needs encouragement to go out to a planned event when home is<br/>
so inviting, but that doesn&#39;t sound like the type of thing you mean. It is<br/>
quite impossible to stop children from learning, however we can<br/>
inadvertently make what they are learning ideas like &quot;Mom thinks I&#39;m dumb&quot;<br/>
or &quot;Mom doesn&#39;t like what I am into so I have to keep it secret&quot; or &quot;Mom<br/>
loves me more when I do school for her&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
I would encourage you to practice more acceptance of where they are at and<br/>
what they enjoy doing instead of worrying about what they are not doing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;For example, he will write &quot;hi how are you<br/>
doing?  I have a lizard and a snake.  I am sending you a pokemon card.<br/>
Bye.&quot;  And that is the extent of his letter.  I don&#39;t want to critisize his<br/>
efforts, but I certainly don&#39;t want him to write letters to someone that<br/>
make no sense.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I certainly agree that this letter is the soul of brevity, which<br/>
sometimes can in itself signal that it was an assigned task rather than a<br/>
spontaneous desire to communicate something. However to say that it makes no<br/>
sense is inaccurate. It makes a lot of sense to me, and I am not even the<br/>
recipient. He politely opens with a inquiry, gives some info that is a<br/>
possible conversation opener for the reply, and includes a gift. I think it<br/>
is a rather nice letter.<br/>
<br/>
Letter writing is an art that I never mastered. It is astonishing how much<br/>
more I prefer e-mail. In the past I was phone caller, rather than a letter<br/>
writer. <br/>
<br/>
However I think the real reason that I never wrote many letters, and<br/>
certainly never really got beyond &quot;How are you I am well&quot;, was because I was<br/>
writing &quot;obligation&quot; letters to my grandparents and later mother. I had no<br/>
real desire to communicate anything to them - certainly not to share my<br/>
dreams or hopes or wishes or private notions or even the events in my life.<br/>
I was convinced they would find my life neither interesting nor amusing, and<br/>
would probably use my tales as opportunities to critique me and my choices.<br/>
Certainly as a youngster I was infected with that &quot;keep my life secret from<br/>
untrustworthy adults&quot; paradigm.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I believe I have something to say that some people might want to<br/>
hear, in a network with common interests, I am pretty much unstoppable. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&quot;The way to achieve inner peace is to finish all the things you&#39;ve<br/>
started.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Leaving out the joke part and just in passing, this is another concept that<br/>
is rather an anathema to Unschooling with joy. I believe that one of the<br/>
facets of inner peace is to feel free to quit any project that ceases to<br/>
fill my needs. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your kids are really young.  When you place more value on certain activities<br/>
it makes those activities less desirable because they know you are grading<br/>
the outcome, if only in your mind.  Just like when someone limits TV, it<br/>
becomes a commodity that is overly desired, when you place more value on<br/>
learning a certain thing, it becomes something to avoid.  I&#39;d suggest you<br/>
take a month and write down (privately- only for yourself and without them<br/>
knowing) all the things they do that they are learning something from.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; me as far as encouraging learning without forcing it on them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, it&#39;s hard if you can&#39;t see the learning that takes place all the<br/>
time, but to encourage a larger world view for them, offer to take them<br/>
places they might be interested in.  Do homeschool groups in your area get<br/>
together and organize trips to zoos, theaters, tours of places, museums,<br/>
etc?  My children still play a lot (now almost 9 and 10.5) but it has always<br/>
been the case that as they were exposed to something (ballet comes to mind<br/>
right now) that they incorporated whatever it was into their play.  After<br/>
going to the Nutcracker each year, they would play ballet for weeks.  They<br/>
would keep the program to play with (and read it over and over) and write<br/>
their own programs and put on their own ballets for us to watch.  <br/>

some magazines that have to do with Pokemon to help further their interests<br/>
in pokemon?  Are their any games with that theme that you could buy? Books?<br/>
If they are interested in Pokemon, then help them to find other pokemon<br/>
resources to delve into.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not about doing nothing.  It&#39;s about respecting where they are right<br/>
now and at the same time still offering other things for them to do that<br/>
will broaden their world view.<br/>
Be prepared to take NO for an answer, esp. if they think you have some<br/>
ulterior motive.<br/>

show them?  We would always excitedly find all the books by the same author<br/>
if we liked them and read them all unless we tired of them.  My kids did<br/>
reach an age when their days were so busy that they didn&#39;t want me to read<br/>
during the day, but if we got to bed at a decent hour, they would want me to<br/>
read for a long time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is all about letting them learn at their own pace the things<br/>
that interest them.  Be there to help them further their interests even if<br/>
you don&#39;t find the same things interesting.  At the same time (if it&#39;s<br/>
possible with four small children) follow your own interests.  They&#39;ll see<br/>
you learning about things that interest you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of kids write letters just like that.  They aren&#39;t sure what to say and<br/>
they just get to the point.  I always helped my kids write to their pen pals<br/>
by suggesting other things they could add to the letter about themselves or<br/>
their interests and other questions they could ask.  Sometimes they&#39;d take<br/>
my suggestions and sometimes they wouldn&#39;t.  My kids still write all their<br/>
letters to their penpals on Microsoft Word and print them and mail them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly what is your goal with him learning math?  Is it so he can use it in<br/>
real life?  It sounds like he can already do this when he needs to.  Why<br/>
would he need to do math on paper if he can notice real life mistakes and<br/>
solve real life problems?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have always played LOTS of board games.  I have always played them WITH<br/>
my kids, not just suggested to them that they go off and play them.  There<br/>
is lots of math (more like real life math) involved in games.  Lots of<br/>
critical thinking. They&#39;ve always been able to play games geared toward<br/>
older kids because I was there to help them.   I love the games by Thinkfun<br/>
like Rush Hour Traffic Jam.  You play them alone and they are logic games.<br/>
They are fun and encourage critical thinking.  Do you buy new games to try<br/>
on the computer too?<br/>
<br/>
Breath Kim and relax.  Help them make their days fun and you will see that<br/>
they are learning all the time.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure why you think it doesn&#39;t makes sense - sounds like the  <br/>
perfect letter from a little boy. Beats the heck out of: Dear  <br/>
Grandma, How are you? I am fine. In school I like recess best. Love,  <br/>
Your Grandson<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re comparing to things you see coming out of schooled kids,  <br/>
that&#39;s not fair because they&#39;re generally following a format or  <br/>
template provided by the teacher. And they&#39;re writing drafts, getting  <br/>
comments and suggestions by a teacher, and rewriting. And HATING  <br/>
every minute of it. And it is all mostly a big huge waste of time  <br/>
because the kids are learning that WRITING IS HARD and MISERABLE and  <br/>
nobody in their right mind would do it unless it was forced on them.  <br/>
THAT is the big lesson learned and, as Frank Smith says, when  <br/>
something is really learned, it is very very difficult to ever  <br/>
unlearn it.<br/>

If you&#39;re comparing to things you see coming out of schooled kids,<br/>
that&#39;s not fair because they&#39;re generally following a format or<br/>
template provided by the teacher. And they&#39;re writing drafts, getting<br/>
comments and suggestions by a teacher, and rewriting. And HATING<br/>
every minute of it. And it is all mostly a big huge waste of time<br/>
because the kids are learning that WRITING IS HARD and MISERABLE and<br/>
nobody in their right mind would do it unless it was forced on them.<br/>
THAT is the big lesson learned and, as Frank Smith says, when<br/>
something is really learned, it is very very difficult to ever<br/>
unlearn it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Cameron left school at 12. He swore to me he would never read or write <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
The first year, he spent a lot of time on the computer IMing mostly. (I <br/>
didn&#39;t remind him that *was* writing and reading! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
He avoided both as best he could. And did a pretty good job of that as <br/>
I remember! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He started reading a bit these last couple of years---mostly books on <br/>
dead rock & rollers! &lt;g&gt; He has a HUGE book on Phish, and we&#39;ve bought <br/>
him numerous books on Jimi Hendrix, The Dead, The Beatles, The Stones, <br/>
Cream, etc. He&#39;s devoured them all. He gets magazines on drumming <br/>
(Relix & Modern Drummer)----cover to cover! He took _Wherever You Go, <br/>
There You Are_ with him to read on the plane.<br/>
<br/>
For years, writing seemed to be limited to thank you notes and <br/>
occasional journaling, which he NEVER thought he&#39;d enjoy!. He bought a <br/>
new journal for his trip to Scotland this week. And he and his <br/>
girlfriend share a journal and write back and forth to each other in <br/>
it. I don&#39;t know how many journals he&#39;s gone through lately! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He just got back from Not Back to School Camp in West Virginia. He&#39;s <br/>
totally devoted to writing letters to his new friends---long, <br/>
art-filled letters with deep thoughts and life questions. It&#39;s so neat <br/>
to see him into letter writing! He eagerly awaits the postman (and is <br/>
disappointed when there&#39;s nothing for him!) and spend hours writing <br/>
letters and doing little bits of art in the margins and on the <br/>
envelopes.<br/>
<br/>
School damaged him---but not beyond repair! He HAS unlearned it. But I <br/>
believe that is only because I (and his dad and he!) so totally <br/>
understand how unschooling ----and LEARNING!---works. And we trust that <br/>
he&#39;ll learn everything he needs to know when he&#39;s ready.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I highly recommend that you read Alison McKee&#39;s book, Homeschooling<br/>
Our Children, Unschooling Ourselves. Here is the Amazon.com link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0965780627/qid=1126115738/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-2270557-6623942?v=glance&s=books">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0965780627/qid=1126115738/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/104-2270557-6623942?v=glance&s=books</a><br/>
<br/>
It chronicles the personal inner journey of the writer, a professional<br/>
educator, through the unschooling/homeschooling childhood and teenage<br/>
years of her two children. She shares the story of how she and her<br/>
husband worked through their fears about letting go of workbooks and<br/>
curriculums and learned to trust and respect their children&#39;s natural<br/>
intelligence, curiousity, and developing selves. <br/>
<br/>
She shares how events unfolded when she would try to clamp down and<br/>
bring in some formal educational experiences -- genrally these would<br/>
bring on strain to her relationships with her children and dampen<br/>
their enthusiasm about whatever the topic was. She shares<br/>
inspirational stories about their adventures in self-directed<br/>
learning. She shares how nervewracking, but ultimately rewarding, it<br/>
was every time she and her husband would TRULY let go and TRULY let<br/>
the children learn at their own paces.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, her son didn&#39;t learn the math that is considered<br/>
necessary until he was fifteen or so. Then he picked up some<br/>
workbooks, sat himself down, and went through the entire 12-year<br/>
curriculum in three months. Because he decided it was time for him to<br/>
learn, and he had some reasons to be able to pass certain tests. By<br/>
the time this came about, his mind was so sharp that it was all a very<br/>
smooth process. (So what would have been gained by him being tortured<br/>
with that stuff for 12 solid years, instead of just waiting for his<br/>
personal right time?)<br/>
<br/>
It also illustrates how VERY different children can be, and the<br/>
importance of trusting their rightness. For instance, although the son<br/>
 (older) learned to read of his own accord at 4, the daughter learned<br/>
at 8. This was a nervewracking time for McKee, but she managed to<br/>
restrain herself from interfering, and when eventually the daughter<br/>
learned, it happened very quickly, and because the daughter wanted to<br/>
do it. <br/>
<br/>
Both kids went on to be high achievers in college.<br/>
<br/>
This book, I think, addresses the fears you discuss in your post. The<br/>
writer shared all of them and lived to tell the tale! BTW, this is the<br/>
book that got me hooked on Holt and unschooling. The ideas are<br/>
beautifully described and just feel so right.<br/>

<br/>
It was a problem for me because I was a schooled kid.  I could figure  out <br/>
complex algebra problems in my head.  I reasoned myself through them in  my <br/>
mind, but couldn&#39;t for the life of me get them down on paper in the same  amount <br/>
of time, so I&#39;d just write the answers.<br/>
 <br/>
WRONG thing to do , you MUST show your work.  It&#39;s hard to show the  &quot;work&quot; <br/>
that went on in my head because it was nothing like the teacher set it up  on <br/>
the board.<br/>
 <br/>
Often I would &quot;talk&quot; her through how I came to my answers and so quickly,  <br/>
often I was accused of cheating somehow.<br/>
 <br/>
I learned to really hate math because of that.  I could find answers  inside <br/>
my head for the questions but I couldn&#39;t put those steps on paper and I  was <br/>
branded a cheat and liar for it.<br/>
 <br/>
If I had been unschooled I might have used that math skill for some good  <br/>
purpose in life, now I hate even thinking about working a math problem in my  <br/>
head (the only way I can work anything other than simple math)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375500392">Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with you. I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t explain the point of the<br/>
book right. The book &quot;Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling<br/>
Ourselves&quot; does not justify pressing lessons on kids. The whole book<br/>
is about just the opposite. It shows how disastrous it is to press<br/>
lessons on kids. <br/>
<br/>
I agree, and the writer of the book would agree, more than twice IS<br/>
just too much. If she could go back in time and take back whatever<br/>
efforts she ever made to foist schoolish lessons on her kids, I&#39;m sure<br/>
she would. <br/>
<br/>
But the stories she tells are her true stories. She was an elementary<br/>
school teacher who was thoroughly brainwashed, and it took years for<br/>
her to become unschooled (hence the title).<br/>
<br/>
There is one particularly sad story about how her son&#39;s enthusiasm for<br/>
a particular thing was quashed by her schoolteacherish attempts to<br/>
&quot;help&quot; him &quot;do it right.&quot; She didn&#39;t even do or say much, but even<br/>
what seemed like a little bit had a big effect. Reading about the<br/>
process of his passion dying was just excruciating. He never became<br/>
interested in that area again -- maybe he never will -- maybe her<br/>
well-meaning blunder changed his whole life. Her chagrin over it is<br/>
deep and real. I found the whole episode appalling, instructive, and a<br/>
dramatic illustration of the awesome negative potential of the<br/>
schoolish approach.<br/>
<br/>
If reading this book, or a similar one, can short-circuit an<br/>
education-oriented person&#39;s impulse to pull out the workbooks now and<br/>
then (whenever they lose faith in their child, in other words), then I<br/>
think it is an ideal recommendation. That is the effect it has had for<br/>
me. It shows how damaging the schoolish lessons can be, and the<br/>
importance and validity of getting out of the way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616694798">My husband recieved a bad grade on a report that he<br/>
did (middle school age, I believe) that was written up<br/>
entirely from his own head.  He wrote a report about<br/>
baseball, but mainly about his favorite team, the Los<br/>
Angeles Dodgers.  The teacher was disappointed that he<br/>
did not include a bibliography -- which he thought was<br/>
only a requirement if you actually had to use a<br/>
reference book, which he didn&#39;t.  When he thinks back<br/>
on it, he feels like she was saying that he had copied<br/>
everything from somewhere.  He loved baseball so much,<br/>
and the Dodgers even more, that he knew just about<br/>
everything about them, without the use of books for<br/>
the report.<br/>
<br/>
This memory is one of the ways that my husband really<br/>
started to understand unschooling.  A long while back<br/>
we had a discussion about unschooling -- where I was<br/>
trying to get him to see how wonderful it was -- and<br/>
this memory surfaced for him.  It was the first time<br/>
he realized how someone can learn something without<br/>
being required to.<br/>

&gt; real writer&quot; in that<br/>
&gt; teacher&#39;s class after that little episode.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Often I would &quot;talk&quot; her through how I came to my<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914557871">Hey, it&#39;s not just in school that it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Long ago Keith didn&#39;t live with me but had borrowed my car, a Honda Civic.<br/>
Someone in a silver Honda Civic robbed a convenience store in Albuquerque.<br/>
Cops stopped Keith, called him out with guns drawn, it wasn&#39;t the guy.<br/>
BUT... Keith was a cocky kid and irritating, so they wanted to ticket him for <br/>
something.<br/>
Said his tires were too bald.<br/>
<br/>
My dad lived one block from a tire store in Santa Fe and was listening to the <br/>
radio when they said the first person there with a roll of quarters could buy <br/>
a set of 13&quot; tires (or 12s or whatever that car took).   He trotted around <br/>
the corner and bought me a set of tires.<br/>
<br/>
We got the tires on and Keith took the receipt to court to get out of the <br/>
ticket.   <br/>
<br/>
The judge said &quot;You can&#39;t buy a set of tires for $10&quot; and fined him.<br/>
<br/>
If it hadn&#39;t been night court, maybe they could&#39;ve called the tire place to <br/>
verify.<br/>
