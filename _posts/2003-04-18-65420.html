<br/>
But this is an unschooling list. People come here for unschooling <br/>
information that&#39;s not readily found elsewhere. I would think that a <br/>
discussion of ritalin would have to focus on ritalin in relation to <br/>
or fitting in with an unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
My son is on Prozac. Sometimes I mention this as an option that <br/>
someone might want to explore. I share our experience. I always do it <br/>
from an unschooled frame of reference, though. And I&#39;m more than well <br/>
aware that Conor&#39;s previous school years had to have an affect on <br/>
him, his learning and some of his personal beliefs. I think we&#39;ve <br/>
undone most of it, but who knows.<br/>
