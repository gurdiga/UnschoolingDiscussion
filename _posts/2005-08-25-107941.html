<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100155389">I always say &#39;drive carefully&#39; or &#39;be safe&#39; as my now young adult children drive off, and then one day it occured to me that I was kind of making a statement by my consistent insistent behaviour (exhorting my young people to &#39;do&#39; something I felt to be valuable) that they weren&#39;t naturally capable of doing this without a reminder from me! I looked into my need to say these words and realised that I believed that I was warding off potential disaster - indulging in a bit of superstition. I had to smile. I still smile. And I still say &#39;drive carefully&#39; or &#39;be safe&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
I personally like the &#39;be safe&#39; statement better. My children react better to that one. I&#39;ve also talked to them about why I say it - talked about my fears, my insecurities, the superstition (touch wood) aspect of saying it aloud. They didn&#39;t like the thought that I wasn&#39;t 100% confident in their driving ability, and I hedged by saying that most accidents are caused by the &#39;other&#39; guy on the road. The more experienced they get with driving the more they understand that most accidents are really caused by inattentiveness and overconfidence (in ones&#39;s driving ability and in the car&#39;s ability to perform perfectly in all situations, or to simply hang together).<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I remember I let my kids now why I say or do the things I do. Most of the time most of us simply assume that we know why our family members or friends say and do things, and sometimes this is accurate but sometimes it&#39;s not. I find that being clear about motive diffuses a lot of relationship issues based on miscommunication. <br/>
 <br/>
wishing you peace and prosperity, <br/>

  Last night my nephew called.   Holly took the call.   He was calling to say <br/>
  he and his friend were going to drive home (100 miles) instead of coming to our <br/>
  house to sleep, after Ozzfest.   Holly was polite, asked a couple of <br/>
  questions, and then said &quot;Okay.   Bye.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  After she hung up I suggested that maybe next time someone said he was going <br/>
  to drive a hundred miles in the dark she might say &quot;Drive carefully&quot; or &quot;be <br/>
  safe.&quot;   I said &quot;What you said was really nice, though.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
  Just one little coaching moment.<br/>

<br/>
There is something about Jean Liedloff&#39;s book The Continuum Concept <br/>
that has always stayed with me- that our children, on some level, <br/>
respond to our obvious expectations more than they respond to our <br/>
explicit requests.  In other words &quot;Be Careful!&quot; gives a clear message <br/>
that we DON&#39;T expect our child to be careful- which is why we feel <br/>
driven to constantly remind or admonish.  According to Liedlfoff, the <br/>
implicit suggestion to our children that they are not naturally <br/>
careful has MORE of an impact than the request itself.  I&#39;m lately <br/>
thinking (with lots of anecdotal evidence) that she makes a good point.<br/>

<br/>
I always say &quot;have fun&quot; when I drop my son off anywhere, it is because I HATE hearing parents telling their kids to &quot;BE GOOD!&quot; when they drop them off.  That just drives me crazy, so I always say &quot;have fun&quot; or &quot;have a great time!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When my son rides off on his bike though, I say &quot;have fun and be safe!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a blessing.   It&#39;s &quot;I want you to come home safely because I love you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be safe&quot; is good, but it seems to absolve the driver of responsibility.   <br/>
Even though not all accidents are the fault of the driver, that whole <br/>
super-alert defensive-driving stuff saves lives.   Driving safely involves watching out <br/>
for crazy drunken reckless other drivers too.    <br/>
<br/>
-=- They didn&#39;t like the thought that I wasn&#39;t 100% confident in their <br/>

Kirby has never had brakes fail.   He&#39;s overconfident in the magic of a brake <br/>
pedal.     I was only 15 the first time a brake pedal didn&#39;t do me any good, <br/>
and my mom was in the car, and I had to throw a U-turn in two lanes (or blast <br/>
into an intersection with cars, through a red light, which I was interested in <br/>
avoiding).   VW bug.   Didn&#39;t flip over.    My mom was just still and quiet, <br/>
and acted like she knew I&#39;d save her and wasn&#39;t too scared.<br/>
<br/>
I remind Kirby once in a while that brakes can fail.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I find that being clear about motive diffuses a lot of relationship <br/>
issues based on miscommunication.-=-<br/>

Marty left yesterday afternoon to housesit for four days in Glorieta, a <br/>
little town maybe 80 miles away in the middle of basically nowhere, without even a <br/>
grocery store.   He can drive to Pecos to get groceries (Pecos, New Mexico).   <br/>
He was looking forward to it.   He&#39;s an introvert who&#39;ll have a good time <br/>
alone.   He took a book, a DVD, bunch of CDs, a digital camera with three cards, <br/>
there&#39;s a computer he can use there and a phone and two big dogs who know and <br/>
like him.   Yet I was treating him like he was going ice climbing alone <br/>
without a jacket.   I told him it was uncontrollable mom-urge and to give me a <br/>
break.   I made sure he took a flashlight in case the electricity went out.   He <br/>
laughed.   I said just because Albuquerque has backup systems doesn&#39;t mean rural <br/>
areas do.   He let me help him checklist his packing.    <br/>
<br/>
As to the other judgment/coaching topic, I suggested he strip the bed and   <br/>
wash the sheets Sunday morning, and maybe make the bed, but at least have the <br/>
sheets clean and available for the owner.   <br/>
<br/>
My worry is out of proportion, but at least I can see that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I say both, but not all the time.  Not all events are meant to be  &quot;fun&quot; <br/>
outings, but if they are, I say &quot;have fun and be careful&quot;.    Unfortunately we&#39;ve <br/>
had lots of instances of teen deaths in car accidents in the  last while.  <br/>
Kids that we knew and saw daily, and my children know how  terrible that can be.  <br/>
BUT it did open up discussions about how much they  mean to me and how <br/>
devastated I would be if something ever happened to  them.<br/>
 <br/>
So, they don&#39;t mind the &quot;be careful&quot; part, they understand it means so much  <br/>
more than those words.<br/>

My standard goodbye is &quot;Watch out for idiots.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We live in the outer reaches of a huge metropolitan area (chicago). There are <br/>
a lot of idiots out there to be watched for. Especially on the interstates, <br/>
which we&#39;ve counseled our kids to drive at the prevailing speed, regardless of <br/>
the posted speed limit. There are sections of those roads where you&#39;re <br/>
courting disaster to drive the speed limit. :(<br/>
