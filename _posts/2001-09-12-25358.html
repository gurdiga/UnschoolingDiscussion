<div id="ygrps-yiv-631178704">Johanna- This is exactly how it is for me. I live in a Mobile home park. It&#39;s <br/>
a nice one, all doublewides, over 700 lots, etc, but still a mobile home <br/>
park. I have less then 10 feet on each side of my house and we&#39;re only <br/>
allowed a 3 foot fence/brick wall around the house. These neighbors have <br/>
started doing lawn for all houses that can be seen from their home, except <br/>
for ours. Why? Because they want everything within the vacinity of their home <br/>
to look a certain way. No children are to be on the lawn, even if they are <br/>
getting out of the way of a car. No noise whatsoever after a certain amount <br/>
of time or before a certain amount of time. No children should be dirty or <br/>
barefoot (which mine are constnatly are in the dirt and never have shoes on). <br/>
They come over here every weekend to talk to Paul about how he can improve <br/>
our grass. They have this obsession with grass. Anytime they speak with me <br/>
it&#39;s stuff about how if I am going to homeschool my kids then they should be <br/>
inside being homeschooled. They also have said it&#39;s no fair for my children <br/>
to be outside playing with all the other children have to go to school. <br/>
Hmmmm. We recently were looking at purchasing a 5 acre property up in the <br/>
hills, but soon after we decided we wanted to do that my son started his <br/>
violence spree busting out his bedroom window. We decided that purchasing <br/>
that property wasn&#39;t what would be best for our family at this time, however, <br/>
we do want to get out of HERE.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-220273691">Hi<br/>
<br/>
My kidlets get dirty, so does DH. But they do wash off<br/>
all the dirt daily, sometimes more if they dirt has<br/>
yucky or dangerous stuff in it. The beds are all<br/>
clean. Actually the house is clean. But mostly because<br/>
I am an esthetics nut and I don&#39;t like the looks of<br/>
grubby.  This is unique to me, in my family.  Nobody<br/>
else cares, none of my siblings, none of my children,<br/>
DH, nobody cares about COLOR, FORM, or any of the<br/>
things that are essential for me.  They are all Form<br/>
follows Function folks. They function a lot, too. So I<br/>
try to work around it and proved forms to allow their<br/>
functions that are easy me. They don&#39;t really notice,<br/>
unless I make a large noise (true confession) when my<br/>
sewing project is turned into sailboat sails or my<br/>
detail paintbrush is used for super glue.   <br/>
<br/>
We have everything in the &quot;living room/ dining area&quot;.<br/>
Except things like large mud projects and too much<br/>
motor oil, gasoline, animal goo. Well, the bird has a<br/>
lot of dander. Most of the electric music stuff went<br/>
with the older sons.  I miss it the constant creation<br/>
of music. But not the bulky clutter and wires. However<br/>
a new collection is forming for DS4. Sigh.  He is<br/>
starting with the wires.  Actually I am the guilty<br/>
party...I collect the stuff for them.  Little guys<br/>
really can&#39;t acquire things of interest to them<br/>
without their grownups.  So there is vast array of<br/>
items of interest in a small space. Lots of hobby<br/>
motors, batteries, wires, dismantled everything.  Not<br/>
so bad as I am also an organization nut.  That  part<br/>
is easy for me (I lived for a while, in my youth,<br/>
comfortably out of a backpack.)<br/>
<br/>
Ds having so much bothers DH though. I think a lot of<br/>
Papas in our and our parent&#39;s generation (I will be 52<br/>
in a couple of days) are jealous of their children. Oh<br/>
well, the point of being a good parent is to TRY to be<br/>
a good parent.  He is doing better than his Daddy.  I<br/>
must say I have been able to learn from my Mother&#39;s<br/>
mistakes.  She made so many that there have been lots<br/>
of pitfalls that I&#39;ve been able to avoid.  Thanks<br/>
Mother for identifying these areas for me so I didn&#39;t<br/>
have to go that way. I got to make a whole batch of<br/>
different mistakes!! <br/>
<br/>
Life ALWAYS provides a teacher when we need one.  It<br/>
just is uncomfortable sometimes.  All that painful<br/>
internal work is what I call a CHORE. Blagh. I don&#39;t<br/>
always like it. <br/>
<br/>
As for Not Doing.  I Not Do sometimes because I am not<br/>
able TO DO sometimes.I have $#$&^%&^%#@ MS. I try not<br/>
to waste these un-experiences by modifying them into a<br/>
Zen exercise. This is uselfull, actually, in the<br/>
&quot;letting go&quot; arena.  Of course, my mind cooperates in<br/>
that I have CRS, too. And sometimes I just sorry out.<br/>
<br/>
It is my personal belief that most living things have<br/>
SPIRIT.  This an awareness that is in common with all<br/>
other living things. As everything is composed of<br/>
eneregy vibrating at different frequencies to maintain<br/>
its identity....All is One.  We each (trees, rocks,<br/>
people) maintain our frequency or viewpoint, but it<br/>
isn&#39;t really permanent. Other ideas, experiences,<br/>
food, etc. modify us and we change or grow. To grow<br/>
means to me that one&#39;s awareness expands with<br/>
compassion. &#39;course this is all a bunch or words and<br/>
we can get lost in semantics. Which is fun sometimes<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Well....if you actually wade through all of this I<br/>
hope you will remember Pam&#39;s SIL and make allowances. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am basically a hermit, now. I have gone 2 months<br/>
without taking DS anywhere expect the grocery store,<br/>
library, or post office. However we live in a Field<br/>
Trip!! That is a book with no end in itself. <br/>
<br/>
As FL requires a portfolio of &quot;work&quot; examples  showing<br/>
progress (to be evaluated annually)and a list of books<br/>
read, this has highlighted the infinite variety or<br/>
possibilities in our immediate venue. Documenting this<br/>
at first was fun, now it is a CHORE. There is SO much.<br/>
It is more fun to do it all subjectively. But,<br/>
documenting awareness (ha!) looks good. I use those<br/>
little colored notebook dividers. And Folders, and<br/>
more notebooks, ad nauseum.  The globe lives right in<br/>
the middle of everything.  DS3 gave it to me as a gift<br/>
when my old one got too outdated. <br/>
<br/>
Love and Prayers<br/>
