&lt;&lt; Frank Smith says that when some is engaged in real learning, that they <br/>
won&#39;t <br/>
even realize they are learning - that the experience is not at all like that <br/>
of college students cramming for exams where you certainly KNOW you are <br/>
&quot;learning.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They hope they&#39;re learning at least enough to last 24 hours.<br/>
<br/>
I remember forgetting a LOT of what I learned in college.  But what I do <br/>
remember from college was what took my breath away, and sometimes that was in <br/>
class and sometimes it wasn&#39;t.  I remember how to read Middle English aloud.  <br/>
I did it just Monday night, at a music practice when someone asked what <br/>
language Edi Beo was in and I sang a verse in Middle English (reading, not <br/>
from memory).  I remember as much useful information that I learned in <br/>
conversations with friends from different parts of the world, though, as I <br/>
remember from what was going to be on the test.<br/>
