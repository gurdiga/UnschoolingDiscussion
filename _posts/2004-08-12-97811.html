<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559965736">Hi, I know you veteran unschoolers will think I am possibly hopeless, <br/>
or at most terribly uninformed, but I need some advice. My children <br/>
went to public school until 6th, and 3rd grades until I got so fed up <br/>
I decided to homeschool. Our first year was wonderful. Lots of fun <br/>
and activities. Once I joined a support group and met many other <br/>
homeschoolers, I began to doubt my abilities and felt quite inferior! <br/>
No one else seemed to have my relaxed, unit study type opinion of <br/>
education. Surely, since they were much more experienced than me, <br/>
they knew the &quot;right&quot; way. So, I adopted a more rigid (still couldn&#39;t <br/>
bring myself to do grades, report cards, etc.) approach. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, long story short, our homeschooling went from fun, de-<br/>
schooling to boring, rote, get the correct yearly subjects done <br/>
criteria. Not to mention, we had a surprise little addition to our <br/>
family 17 months ago. Now, I am busy with a toddler, my oldest is a <br/>
senior this year, and my middle son will begin 9th grade. (I know, I <br/>
can&#39;t break free of the grade mentality yet either!) Basically, I <br/>
have always read and loved everything about unschooling, but get <br/>
nervous when it comes down to it. I end up buying curriculum and <br/>
following the school subjects model. I want to be an unschooler. Can <br/>
it realistically work with 14 and 18 yr. olds? Will I be ruining my <br/>
older sons chances of college? I feel the crunch of one year left <br/>
with him. I want him to know that learning is something you do your <br/>
whole life because of something that interests you. Not because the <br/>
state says you must have so many hours of this subject. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions? We have been in a few support <br/>
groups, but never met any unschoolers. Some are more relaxed, but <br/>
most are school-at-homers! I wish I had some living examples around <br/>
me to help me in my resolve (or get me off the fence)! All advice, <br/>
hints, help, etc. wanted!<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

You could do a lot of &quot;what if&quot; and review his life with him (or for him) <br/>
looking for the things he learned well and informally.    Can you afford <br/>
overnight trips to other cities?  (If the baby doesn&#39;t mind car rides or train rides, <br/>
depends where you are.)   Explore.   See bunches of videos.   Play tourist in <br/>
your own town.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;d have to consider what you really, deeply mean by &quot;it&quot; and <br/>
&quot;realistically&quot; and &quot;work.&quot;<br/>
Honest.<br/>
What are your goals?   If your goals remain &quot;they seem to know everything <br/>
they would have known if they had gone to high school,&quot; it won&#39;t work.  But there <br/>
are many other ways to see &quot;it&quot; and to revise what &quot;realistically&quot; means to <br/>
you.  Some of the work schooling does is quite negative work.<br/>
<br/>
But it can work for a 17 month old, for the next dozen-and-more years, and <br/>
work better the more confident you are.   <br/>
<br/>
And for the mid-kid?  It should be wonderful!<br/>

Quit hanging around school-at-homers (doh!) and attend the Live and Learn  <br/>
Unschooling Conference.<br/>
