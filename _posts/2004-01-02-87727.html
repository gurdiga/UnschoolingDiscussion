<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986460824">have invaded my home!<br/>
<br/>
I left my 12 yo son home while we ran to the store real quick today.  We<br/>
came home to find he had ...washed dishes!  Now, I had already washed the<br/>
dishes ... plates, etc.  He put those away and washed the pans (two iron<br/>
skillets! and some others) that were on the stove that I have been<br/>
neglecting AND even wiped the stove down.<br/>
<br/>
Can I keep the pod person??  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am impressed!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Teresa ... there is a waiting list already! ROFL  Let&#39;s see if this person<br/>
sticks around or disappears for a few months. He even helped with dinner AND<br/>
went to check on the clothes in the dryer without a reminder (he does much<br/>
of the laundry in the house!).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t rub any of your kids up against Kirby this week.<br/>
<br/>
Here was one of our worst hours for a long time.  (And now that I think about <br/>
it I&#39;m whining about nothing much at all.)  Here was the situation yesterday <br/>
mid-day:<br/>
<br/>
We rented Seabiscuit and it&#39;s due Sunday and I haven&#39;t watched it.<br/>
I wanted Kirby to move the XBox back into his room so I could sit and play <br/>
neopets pattern games without any words and watch a movie too.  He said he would.<br/>
Kirby and Marty wanted to take my van to a party in another town at 5:00 and <br/>
I said they could.<br/>
Holly wanted to go and buy a battery operated toy violin from the music store <br/>
and I said I would take her.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I left at 3:45 and had so much fun we forgot about the 5:00 need.  <br/>
We got back and 5:45, and as we were entering the house I said &quot;The boys are <br/>
gone already...&quot; and then realized *I HAD THE VAN.*<br/>
<br/>
So out come grumpy Kirby and Marty, OVERready to go, and I said &quot;I am SO <br/>
sorry,&quot; and they accepted it somewhat grudgingly, and said &quot;We have to pick up <br/>
Joey and Sam.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I was inconveniencing four people and holding up a party.   Very bad.<br/>
<br/>
So I went into Kirby&#39;s room and the x-box hadn&#39;t been moved.<br/>
<br/>
Hey wait, that&#39;s a story about how irresponsible *I* was, not Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t rub your kids up against me this week.<br/>
<br/>
I called the party hostess and apologized that that batch of guys would be <br/>
late, and asked her to have Kirby call me and talk me through moving that, but <br/>
Keith moved it for me and figured it all out, so when Kirby called, Keith just <br/>
lightly poked him about forgetting.  He said something like &quot;You lost the <br/>
moral high ground a bit by not moving that x-box.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Heck, if that&#39;s the worst thing that happens to us this month we&#39;re doing <br/>
pretty well!<br/>
