<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015420905">Does anyone on this list have the link to a website on &quot;not spanking&quot; that <br/>
had a link in it to something like a &quot;Christians who don&#39;t believe in spanking&quot; <br/>
website?  I know...a tall, vague order :o) but I&#39;m talking with some Christian <br/>
homeschool mom&#39;s who believel in attachment parenting, co-sleeping, no <br/>
vaccinating, etc...but some of them still spank.  Just wanted to give them something <br/>
to read.  Some of them are really on the fence.  Big thank you in advance.<br/>
