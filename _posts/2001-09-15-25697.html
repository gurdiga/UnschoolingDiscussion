This list is not unschooling.  Deciding whether to be an unschooler should <br/>
have to do with you and your kids and what you come to believe about how <br/>
people learn.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re just starting out, please read at www.unschooling.com -- the <br/>
library, archives, and message boards.<br/>
<br/>
This list was never intended to be the front room through which new <br/>
unschoolers come to know unschooling.  The forum is the &quot;real&quot; place.<br/>

well, I&#39;m not new to unschooling, nor am I in the &#39;deciding&#39; process ....<br/>
if this list is not unschooling, what is it?  people who unschool but<br/>

with their kids and their learning?  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118462184">Much of the time, that&#39;s exactly what this list offers. Not this week,<br/>

It&#39;s a good list, but doesn&#39;t tiptoe and dance around, so some people get<br/>
offended.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; well, I&#39;m not new to unschooling, nor am I in the &#39;deciding&#39; process ....<br/>
&gt; if this list is not unschooling, what is it?  people who unschool but<br/>
&gt; feel like arguing all day about things that have little to nothing to do<br/>
&gt; with their kids and their learning?  ;)<br/>
&gt; I was looking for unschooling discussions, ideas, thoughts, help,<br/>
&gt; encouragement.  I&#39;m in the wrong place?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling discussions, ideas, thoughts, help, encouragement are the<br/>
purpose of this list.<br/>
<br/>
Like all mailing lists (and if you&#39;ve been on any others, from goat breeding<br/>
to basket weaving you know whereof I type &lt;g&gt;), this list goes off topic,<br/>
descends to bickering or jokes or recipes, and then swings back around<br/>
again. Lather, rinse, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Mailing lists are not restful, for the most part. I am on one restful<br/>
mailing list, so much so that I save the digests to read when I&#39;m suffering<br/>
from insomnia. Puts me right out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Message boards (i.e, at www.unschooling.com) are often more so (not by any<br/>
means entirely).<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the best way to get any list back on track is to bring a new<br/>
discussion in to it, (complaining about the level of the current discourse<br/>
is tempting, but futile, and leads inevitably to a lot of posts like this<br/>
one, still not on topic). So, if you&#39;re looking for unschooling discussions,<br/>
ideas, thoughts, help, encouragement, give us your story or current problem<br/>
or advice.<br/>

<br/>
The definition of the list is at Yahoo and at unschooling.com. <br/>
<br/>
Many people come to the list directly, on a friend&#39;s recommendation, and <br/>
don&#39;t realize it&#39;s a small side-discussion to the large, real information at <br/>
www.unschooling.com which has all KINDS of on-topic information.<br/>
<br/>
This list is a discussion list for parents who are unschooling.  It is not, <br/>
in and of itself, &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was looking for unschooling discussions, ideas, thoughts, help,<br/>

<br/>
This is the second best place (on a good day).  The best place is <br/>
www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
Pam made a great point:   &lt;&lt;So, if you&#39;re looking for unschooling discussions,<br/>
ideas, thoughts, help, encouragement, give us your story or current problem<br/>
or advice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interactive situation, and lurkers might only get what they provide.  <br/>
Complaints add to the complaints.  <br/>
