<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643357275">We have a new baby. Her name is Bast, and she&#39;s 12 weeks old, black and <br/>
white, and very, very cute.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, she&#39;s Julian&#39;s 14th birthday present. We lost two of our very old <br/>
cats in the last year or so, and were down to one. So this new baby is very <br/>
fun. She&#39;s very playful and has a very loud purr. And Julian is in love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738644099">Something must be going around. Our new kitty is now 12 weeks. Cody. He&#39;s<br/>
all white with black spots on him. The kids call him a dalmation cat. My<br/>
former step daughter calls him moo cat!! He&#39;s just too cute and very silly<br/>
which gives the kids hours of watching entertainment!!!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We just came into a new kitty also. He is a gray furry tiger with blue eyes. <br/>
He was named tiger after our old one.  He loves the fridge and has been <br/>
trapped in there once for a minute or so. The people that had him where feeding him <br/>
milk so he knows where to get the grub. He is very sweet. <br/>
<br/>
He drives the youngest Brittany nuts, Tucker wants that kitty so bad. He has <br/>
gotten to him once but just jumped around and batted him but he is much <br/>
heavier than the kitten.  Though Nicholas 15mo pucks him up side down, by a foot you <br/>
name it. Tiger comes back for more though. Usually Nick carries the kitten to <br/>
me. He loves the kitten, we all do.<br/>

3 dogs, 3 cats , 3 kids, 1 bunny and a baby one the way. And I wonder where <br/>
there is so much fur on my couch<br/>
