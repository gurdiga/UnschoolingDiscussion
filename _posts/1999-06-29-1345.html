&lt;&lt; Welcome to unschooling. Glad you could start while your children are young <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the welcome Mary Ellen.  I agree I am so glad that I get to start <br/>
out at home rather than bringing them home after being in school.  I hear so <br/>
many stories from people who are in that position and think, boy am I glad I <br/>
don&#39;t have that particular situation to deal with.  I couldn&#39;t imagine in my <br/>
wildest dreams sending my dd off to kindergarten last fall (or this fall if I <br/>
held her back since she would have been a young five).  What would we do <br/>
without each other all day?  We were at the park the other day learning <br/>
jumprope with some friends when she jumped and slipped and hit her chin <br/>
really hard on the concrete and also cut her lip.  I of course consoled her <br/>
and after I said to my friends (other hsers) who  would have consoled her if <br/>
this had happened on a school playground?  That would just make me so sad.  <br/>

But it is amazing how we fall into the trap of not thinking just doing what<br/>

I am so glad that I learned how to question and thnk for myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025282825">Just to put my two cents in.<br/>
In Raising Boys, a Harvard researcher says that sending boys to kindergarten<br/>
or even first grade is very difficult, sometimes even traumatizing for them.<br/>
In his opinion boys at this age to need to be close to moms even more than<br/>
girls do. (Not to say that girls do not need to be with their moms).  He<br/>
claims that a lot of problems we have with teenage boys can be traced back<br/>
to the way society treated them in those early years. Breaking mother/son<br/>
bond in at this young age leaves a big mark for the rest of the boy&#39;s life.<br/>
I found it very interesting because I remember reading that in medieval<br/>
Europe boys were under almost exclusive mothers&#39; care for the first 7-8<br/>
years of their lives. When they approached that age the father was taking<br/>
over and a boy was trained in marshal arts.<br/>
I think people in medieval Europe knew something that was forgotten later.<br/>

<br/>
Another thing that did was that when puberty approached children were often <br/>
put out with other families, as pages or grooms, or as serving girls (of high <br/>
rank or low),  or apprenticed.   When families and businesses and households <br/>
switched pubescent kids around, the instinct to rebel against parent and get <br/>
out of the nest was relieved.  They WERE out of the nest. <br/>
<br/>
I think another big problem in this culture is that we punish teenagers for <br/>
their natural and normal urge to become independent and leave mom and dad&#39;s <br/>
home.  There is nothing magical about 18 or 21, and both are past the age <br/>
that many kids are fully grown and have come into their own independent <br/>
thinking.  To force them to stay home and behave as though they were ten is <br/>
begging for trouble.<br/>
<br/>
When children mature late and ARE willing to be placid at the age of 15 or 17 <br/>
we praise their upbringing and their self control, but it&#39;s sometimes just <br/>
natural later development, not superior parenting.  Parents know that if a <br/>
child walks at 11 months instead of 13, it&#39;s just within a range of normal, <br/>
but the range of normalcy seems to be ignored in the teen years.   If there <br/>
were no natural urge to leave why wouldn&#39;t all people stay home for life with <br/>
people who loved them and would feed them?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A long time ago people didnt always move so far. They might stay in the<br/>
same village if they got along. Or move far away if they didnt. but there<br/>
was support for individuals then. now we dont have the extended family all<br/>
the time and support is not as close.<br/>
<br/>
which doesnt mean that kids should or shouldnt leave home at a certain age.<br/>
I think it has to be up to an individual. do our teens know when they are<br/>
ready? Do we? DO we question these norms? of course. and sending kids to<br/>
visit for a summer or to train somewhere would be great if we could trust<br/>
the other people.<br/>

general, that on top of all the other good reasons for keeping my kids at<br/>
home I also have selfish motivations.  :-)  I waited too long to be a Mommy<br/>
to just give my children to someone else to raise.  I want to savor every<br/>
moment I have with them, and not miss anything while they are growing up.<br/>
