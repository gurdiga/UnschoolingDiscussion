 </span></blockquote>It matters to me, greatly, that my family is happy, and it matters to them <br/>
that I am. We all do little things for one another along with the big things. If <br/>
someone gets up for a drink when we&#39;re all watching tv, they ask if the <br/>
others want something. When Beth orders groceries, she buys tubes of cookie dough <br/>
we can have fresh baked cookies whenever we want. (I said we&#39;re thoughtful, not <br/>
that we aren&#39;t lazy.)  If I&#39;m working at my desk, Julian will come behind me <br/>
and give me a shoulder massage.<br/>
<br/>
Someone noticed once when Juls and I were in a store and I asked him if there <br/>
was anything he wanted or needed before we left. They said, &quot;Oh, are you in <br/>
for it!&quot;  Juls said, &quot;She always asks me.&quot;  The thing is, he knows that if I <br/>
can reasonably afford it (and if I can&#39;t, he can usually have it eventually, <br/>
just not now), he can have whatever he wants.<br/>
<br/>
He almost always says no. I have seen kids in museum gift shops clamoring for <br/>
things. Julian never does. He can have what he wants or needs, so he doesn&#39;t <br/>
need the validation of something just because. Far from being &quot;spoiled&quot; (and <br/>
don&#39;t you HATE that term!), Julian is not greedy. <br/>
<br/>
Yeah, it&#39;s really important that my family be happy as much as it can. Makes <br/>
me happy too.<br/>
