OUTAGE ADVISORIES<br/>
Yahoo! Groups will be performing critical database maintenance this  <br/>
week. During this maintenance work, 25% of groups will be offline.  <br/>
Messages sent to affected groups during this interval will be queued  <br/>
and delivered once the groups are back online.<br/>
<br/>
The work is currently scheduled for Tuesday night, December 27th,  <br/>
from 9:00 PM until 2:00 AM Wednesday morning Pacific time (Wednesday  <br/>
morning 5:00-10:00 AM GMT). However, there is a chance it may need to  <br/>
be delayed until later in the week. We will keep this page updated  <br/>
with the latest information.<br/>
