jealous, tell us how it was.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way, speaking of legs, how is the gimp crew<br/>
recovering from the leg breaking spree last fall?  Tom<br/>
is doing really great and doesn&#39;t even have twinges<br/>
anymore from most of the bones he broke in his<br/>
accident.  His wrist still gives him a tweak now and<br/>
then, but that is about it.  But then he has the<br/>
metabolism of a bird and the immune system of a<br/>
borg..he just..repairs.  He&#39;s been building things and<br/>
cutting firewood and dropping trees and hauling logs<br/>
and all manner of that kind of stuff here at our place<br/>
all summer.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hey Sandra, my dh Tom is a hige Weird Al fan.  He&#39;s<br/>

HEY.<br/>
I don&#39;t think I ever answered this.<br/>
<br/>
I can walk even late in the day most days, and I&#39;ve climbed up on things and <br/>
down (but it scares me) and I&#39;m extra careful on stairs.  But I&#39;m also 50 <br/>
years old now.<br/>
<br/>
Weird Al was great, as usual.<br/>
<br/>
My sister got a new house north of Chama (northern New Mexico).  We&#39;re going <br/>
up to see it on the 12th.  It will be a housewarming and first anniversary <br/>
party (of a marriage that wasn&#39;t quite cool at the time, as my sister left her <br/>
family--ran away with the kids&#39; karate teacher! eeep!).   So our whole family is <br/>
going to go and for a housewarming gift I&#39;m going to give her a portable CD <br/>
player (probably boom-box style so she can use it in the yard, because she <br/>
likes yardwork) and Poodle Hat, and probably the Billy Joel retrospective.<br/>
