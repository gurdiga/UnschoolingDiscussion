<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398890374">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m sorry someone badmouthed you by name in public.  That  sucks.  But  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t make your kids&#39;  lives less great,  does it?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>
No, not at all. <br/>
My kids, well the oldest..laugh it off. Better than I at times..<br/>
 <br/>
I think by speaking more and voicing opinions one sticks out more. I  am <br/>
working on not getting twisted about it.. <br/>
I spoke too personal yesterday. My intent was seeking  information/links but <br/>
I went for being clear and that was wrong. My  apologies for bringing local <br/>
issues here I know it&#39;s not on topic for the list.. <br/>
