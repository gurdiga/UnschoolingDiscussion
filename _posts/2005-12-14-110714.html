&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Albuquerque is the big city here.  It&#39;s several times larger than the next-biggest cities of Santa Fe, Las Cruces, Roswell, Farmington...  I grew up in Espanola and it was frustrating that some little thing  would make the news (all stations we got originated in <br/>
Albuquerque)  and a really cool big or horrible thing from around us  wouldn&#39;t.     They would report the weather in detail for Albuquerque; ours got two  numbers.   High school sports in Albuquerque got reported; ours only  occasionally.  Now that I live in Albuquerque, I understand it entirely.  There are  time constraints, and if one is doing TV, film is all.  Photos aren&#39;t  so great--that could be the newspaper.  And in those days (60&#39;s,  70&#39;s) there was no easy way to get even photos quickly from a little  town to the city, and it was no one&#39;s paid-for responsibility.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

I sometimes feel like a hypocrite when it comes to this, I complain about Alamogordo not making the news, but one of the reasons that I live in a small town because there aren&#39;t as many &quot;newsworthy&quot; events!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

That happens here too, all of our news comes from Albuquerque or Roswell.  Well Albuquerque is understandable, it is by far the largest city, but Las Cruces is the second largest city, and it is only an hour from me.  I would love a news channel from Las Cruces instead of Roswell, the fourth largest city.   One of the Albuquerque stations does have a &quot;mobile news room&quot; here in Alamogordo, but we still don&#39;t have much going on that makes the news!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
