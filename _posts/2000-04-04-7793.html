&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure where I stand about the whole maths<br/>
&gt; thing, why is it necessary to think about things in<br/>
&gt; subjects?  Arithmetic, which a lot of folk see as<br/>
&gt; maths, tends to be something which people either get<br/>
&gt; or don&#39;t, which is why we have calculators.  But<br/>
&gt; that doesn&#39;t mean that people who can&#39;t add can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think about the dimensions of things, measure<br/>
&gt; things, count notes to play music.  Not being able<br/>
&gt; to spell well doesn&#39;t mean that someone can&#39;t write<br/>
&gt; beautiful poetry, it means they need a spell-checker<br/>
&gt; or an editor.  Not being able to write neatly<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean that someone can&#39;t write fascinating<br/>
&gt; articles for magazines, it means they use a<br/>
&gt; word-processor.  Not being able to tell the time<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t mean that one can&#39;t understand why the Jews<br/>
&gt; were sent to concentration camps in our recent<br/>
&gt; history, or that dinosaurs are extinct, in our<br/>
&gt; long-distant past.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is another big part of unschooling, being able<br/>
&gt; to recognise the ways we learn best, being able to<br/>
&gt; recognise our talents and using those talents to get<br/>
&gt; where we want to be (even to figure out where we<br/>
&gt; want to be, which is probably much more difficult<br/>
&gt; :-) )  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ooooh, I&#39;m full of it tonight :-)<br/>
