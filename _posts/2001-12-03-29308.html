About the Fibro, dd has 13 of the tender points and had a headache for over a year. We went to every kind of doctor under the sun over the headaches. Did the physical therapy thing (her fibro started after a fall in gymnastics on the beam & she hit her spine), MRI&#39;s EEG&#39;s, etc. The last doc called it Chronic Pain Syndrome and suggested biofeedback. Well sir, I don&#39;t know what happened but during about a weeks time this fall, the headaches disappeared and now she gets one only about once a week.  She&#39;s very physically fit so the fatigue hasn&#39;t been a problem for her. Concentration has been an issue which is why we kept going to one doctor after another... trying to figure out what to do. <br/>
Fibro was described to me as an inflamation of the tissue that surrounds muscle (like that slick stuff on a raw piece of skinless chicken.... the slimy stuff). The purpose of that tissue is to restrict muscle movement when the body tells it that there&#39;s an injury. So, it becomes a viscious circle... the muscle gets injured, the tissue tries to hold it still for healing yet simple movements such as sitting up requires use of those muscles, so the inflamed tissue works harder, more pain, etc.... round and round.  The other problems with fibro.. the fog, the fatigue and so forth are results of the body being out of sync. Can you trace your beginning of fibro to an injury.. and accident or fall or something? It wouldn&#39;t necessarily have to be an injury in your back and only pain in your back. The pain can go *any*where in the body.  Dd&#39;s fibro was an onset of that fall but other people have said they don&#39;t recall a specific event which brought it on. I&#39;d think childbirth *could* be hard enough on the body to get it going which might explain why more women than men get it. <br/>

sometimes emotional trauma.  The other kind seems to start gradually.<br/>

stop.  Did the tender points also go away?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds more like a description of myofascial pain syndrome, which <br/>
frequently accompanies fibro.  Fibro actually doesn&#39;t involve any <br/>
inflamation.  In fact they changed the name some years back from <br/>
fibrositis, which means inflammation of the muscle fibers, to fibromyalgia, <br/>
which means muscle pain.  Myofascial pain syndrome involves trigger points <br/>
as opposed to tender points.  The trigger points generally trigger pain <br/>
elsewhere.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are lots of other reasons, like hormones.  (The majority of women get <br/>
it during their perimenopausal years.)  It seems I&#39;ve read about other <br/>
reasons, but I&#39;m tired and fogging.  My fibro came on quite gradually.  I <br/>
started to get really tired a year or two after Lars was born.  I was <br/>
finally diagnosed hypothyroid and put on medication for that (after trying <br/>
all kinds of natural methods to deal with it).  It helped, but I never did <br/>
get back to &quot;normal&quot; in terms of energy.  I even went with a doctor who <br/>
would treat hypothyroid by the symptoms rather than the blood tests, but I <br/>
still had fatigue, even though he took my dose way too high.  (He even <br/>
ignored an obvious symptom of too much thyroid.  After that, I went back to <br/>
my regular doc.)  It was only after the pain gradually began that I started <br/>
pushing for another diagnosis.  I was really scared I might have rhuematoid <br/>
arthritis like my mother in law.  (Now I realize that I&#39;ve got something <br/>
just as debilitating....sigh.)<br/>

quite good.  I don&#39;t *think* I have MPS, so I don&#39;t know if the trigger <br/>

bring it up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411829417">Tia asked why/how the headaches went away:<br/>
I have *no* idea. It was suggested by a friend that perhaps psychologically, dd needed (in dd&#39;s mind) permission to let go of the injury. I have a hard time buying that but at this point, I have no other ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Tia mentioned inflamation:<br/>
dd&#39;s SED rate was 11. Anything below 30 isn&#39;t considered inflamed so in her case, no inflamation.  The last Doc said the blood test revealed a high HLA-B27 protein which is indicative of potential spinal arthritis in her future. :(<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you aren&#39;t in too much constant pain, Tia. Something I read said that the level you reach doesn&#39;t usually increase... you just stay at about the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327581815">This is a little long but maybe it will explain about the headaches.<br/>
<br/>
I was working as Nursing Services Coordinator for a rehab center.  The gal<br/>
that ran the front desk&#39;s daughter was hurt at school and she had to leave.<br/>
I had run a switchboard back in the darkages, so I volunteered to fill in<br/>
until they could call in the swing shift person.  Old habits die hard, so I<br/>
used the chair to scoot back in forth in.  Ya know, 8 wheeled chair and you<br/>
push off and slide from one side of the space to the other.  Well, seems the<br/>
chair had been half-a** repaired and with one push off, two wheels fell off<br/>
and I went over backwards striking my head on the switchboard console and<br/>
the side of my neck on the sharp formica edge of the counter.<br/>
<br/>
Mild concussion and major headaches.  However, the headaches stayed way<br/>
beyond when the concussion was healed.  It seems if you bruise the spine and<br/>
surrounding muscles they somehow trigger headaches.  16 years later I still<br/>
get the same headaches if I sleep wrong and put too much stress on those<br/>
muscles.  The doc explained that you do permanent damage to the &quot;wiring&quot; of<br/>
your nerves and that by pulling or pushing in a certain way you can again<br/>
set off the headaches.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter bruised the spine and probably did some nerve damage.  While<br/>
it takes awhile for everything to heal, she may still get the headaches.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think I told you about son #3&#39;s football injury (spinal) and hockey<br/>
injury (concussion).  The doc&#39;s explained that both of those injuries<br/>
created a sort of whiplash and caused nerve damage.  He still gets headaches<br/>
from those injuries and they occured 6 and 11 years ago respectively.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988674965">Ouch! good explaination, Lynda. I didn&#39;t realize that a damaged nerve may not heal properly or heal at all, for that matter. I was having a hard time believing that dd was making all this up in her head; the headaches and all appeared very real to me and she&#39;d swear to that, too. <br/>
