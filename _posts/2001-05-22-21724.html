 </span></blockquote>Well, we do, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary. Alaska is home to me, <br/>
always has been, always will be. My entire family, including our <br/>
oldest son and his family, live there. Longtime readers of Home <br/>
Education Magazine know that we&#39;ve tried to move back up there at <br/>
least twice now, the last time two years ago, but complications <br/>
relating to running a publishing company from there, coupled with the <br/>
astronomical expense of feeding our small herd of horses up there, <br/>
and a decided lack of sailboat-friendly bodies of water, sent us back <br/>
to Washington state again. So we live here, but *LIVE* there, <br/>
travelling north as often as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Like later this week. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As far as the legalities, I don&#39;t know what they are, really. I know <br/>
there are residency requirements, but I think we travel between the <br/>
two states often enough to skirt them for the most part. We all still <br/>
carry Alaskan driver&#39;s licenses, and three or four of our vehicles <br/>
have Alaskan license plates, although several other cars and trucks <br/>
(ours and the kids&#39;) have Washington plates... Washington has a <br/>
pretty high number of Alaskan &quot;snowbirds&quot; though, so people really <br/>
don&#39;t pay that much attention here. I think there might be more <br/>
Alaskans per capita in Washington state than any other, just because <br/>
of the proximity, such as it is...<br/>
<br/>
I think it boils down to intent. Which state do you intend to be a <br/>
resident of. For me, that&#39;s not much of a question. I&#39;ll go home <br/>
permanently some day. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
