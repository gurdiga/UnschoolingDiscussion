<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508546800">It sounds like your son is exploring limits, along with quite a bit of <br/>
&quot;deschooling.&quot; He&#39;s been out of school only over the summer, I gather? <br/>
Many people suggest that you should expect to deschool about a month for <br/>
each year of school, including preschool and K.<br/>
<br/>
I see two issues here: what he wants to experience, and what you have to <br/>
put up with. My suggestion would be that you separate the two. Let him <br/>
know what you think and why you think it--vulgar lyrics, violence, etc., <br/>
but give him the freedom to make his own choices. I suspect once he <br/>
realizes the choices are *really* his, some of the atraction will wane. <br/>
At the same time, though, he doesn&#39;t have to listen to it at &quot;fill the <br/>
house&quot; volume or in the room you&#39;re in. You want to make sure, though, <br/>
that in distancing yourself from music you dislike and disapprove of, <br/>
you don&#39;t dislike or disapprove of him. Sharing some of it together may <br/>
lead to some important communication.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, he&#39;s 12.  I&#39;d ask him what the foul language means to him when he<br/>
sings it.  Also, what is he hoping that others will get out of his<br/>
music?  It sounds to me that he is being somewhat of a copycat artist. <br/>
Nothing wrong with this, to an extent, if he doesn&#39;t want to be an<br/>
original.  What makes him mad?  Those kids that made fun of him?  Why<br/>
not write a song about where he wishes they would go?  Why not get some<br/>
anger out with showing them just how great he can be?  <br/>
<br/>
You already have a close enough relationship with him that he is being<br/>
open about his anger (I always hid mine), so gently help him towards his<br/>
goal.  I don&#39;t think he really found a girlfriend in bed with another<br/>
guy, so have him write about things he really DID have happen to him. <br/>
Maybe a girl in school that he liked sat with another boy at lunch or<br/>
something?  Help him know that the very best artists (painters, writers,<br/>
singers, etc.) write about what they know, not what other people know.<br/>
<br/>
And, buy him a guitar, keyboard, drum, or whatever instruments he is<br/>
interested in today.  You also might help him (if he wants the help) to<br/>
become healthier in his body.  Maybe a few long walks talking to you<br/>
might help him formulate his musical ideas and help him trim his body<br/>
(FOR HIMSELF, not for others).<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  It is so much easier to give advice outside of a<br/>
relationship than in it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202720651">Hi Jess,<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably get a lot of ideas about this, but this is my take on the <br/>
situation.  I know how lines of communication can shut down between teens <br/>
and their folks, and I think it is one of the biggest problems that <br/>
exist.  Kids need the counsel of their more experienced parents, but the <br/>
parties are so angry at each other that they cannot talk.  Kids go through <br/>
things, and their folks aren&#39;t there for them.   It seems to me that <br/>
through your son&#39;s songwriting, he is taking you into his confidence; this <br/>
is a gift.<br/>
<br/>
Like it or not, your son has strong feelings, and he is expressing them for <br/>
you in a way that he can.  The first thing I would say is that you may want <br/>
to be sure to keep the lines of communication open.  His songs and the <br/>
things he is expressing are great inroads to further discussion about these <br/>
issues.  In other words, rather than remarking on the strong language, you <br/>
could open a discussion by saying, &quot;Those are strong feelings,&quot; or <br/>
something like that.  In other words, if his song is about life sucking, <br/>
then that&#39;s something you can talk with him about.  Perhaps life doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to suck.  Or perhaps you can help him deal with his life in ways that <br/>
will make him feel good.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t go back and unexpose him to the material he has already been <br/>
exposed to; there&#39;s no point focusing on that.   But you can help him with <br/>
his feelings.  Or, you can just listen to them without judgment.  I know <br/>
that may be really difficult for you and may offend your sensibilities, but <br/>
it may be the difference of him no longer letting you in when he needs you <br/>
and him taking you into his confidence and you being able to head off <br/>
really scary things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this is coming across they way I mean it to.  I just want <br/>
to say that if you can accept his feelings (the good, the bad, and the <br/>
ugly), you have a chance to be of help to him when the going gets tough.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My now 17 yo has always trended towards the distasteful or disgusting in <br/>
choices of music, comedy, movies.  There was a time (at about 12!) when <br/>
he would say or do the most embarrassing things to get a laugh or a <br/>
reaction.  He&#39;s a brilliant and creative person, but I was just <br/>
horrified at some of the ideas he would come up with. Sometimes he was <br/>
parrotting other people, too.<br/>
<br/>
We had long talks about other people&#39;s perceptions; about how no one <br/>
should be able to control what he thinks or how he expresses himself; <br/>
about free speech; about appropriateness of time and place; about the <br/>
meaning of disgusting or distasteful; about self-control and <br/>
impulsiveness.  <br/>
<br/>
We came to an agreement.  I helped him determine what would be <br/>
considered out-of-bounds in &quot;polite company&quot;.  I gave him a test to <br/>
apply--&quot;Would I feel comfortable saying this to Gram?&quot;  (my mother)  If <br/>
the answer was no, then he was to save it for when we were alone, or <br/>
write it down, or tell his buddies.  I was allowed to say ahead of time <br/>
if I thought the place we were going was an appropriate place for D&D, <br/>
as we called it.  And I was allowed to simply say &quot;D&D&quot; if I thought he <br/>
was about to go or had gone over the line.  He agreed to stop at the <br/>
point he heard me say that.  It helped him self-regulate.  <br/>
<br/>
Shortly after that, he was diagnosed with Tourette Syndrome.  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if his tendency to be D&D had anything to do with his TS, but I <br/>
know he certainly felt *compelled* to say some of the things he did. <br/>
 I&#39;ll never know, and he did learn to self-regulate.<br/>
<br/>
He writes songs, too.  They&#39;re not all merry sunshine.  The thing is, <br/>
there&#39;s a market out there for that kind of stuff.  (Not saying that&#39;s a <br/>
good thing.)  I&#39;m saying that other people feel the same way as my son, <br/>
and I believe it&#39;s best if they find a way to express it in a healthy <br/>
way that doesn&#39;t harm anyone.  <br/>

The more you resist the more he will want it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want it gone, listen to it yourself and tell him it&#39;s wonderful and <br/>
ask him to put it back on because you really like it.  Put it on in his room <br/>
when he&#39;s going to sleep.  Send him eminem websites.  Send him articles about <br/>
what was shocking when you were young.  Make it seem mainstream and <br/>
educational and he&#39;ll probably not want anything to do with it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is  difficult to ban <br/>
such things because  I cannot stop his being exposed to them. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True.  So if you do things which ARE useful and uplifting and good, he will <br/>
be exposed to THOSE things, the things you and others are doing around him.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My 12  year old is very strong willed and seems to enjoy being shocking at <br/>
times. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How long has he been homeschooled?<br/>
How long have you been looking into unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Those would be some serious factors to consider.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ah.<br/>
<br/>
Well if he is harmed by negative reactions to his physical self, what he <br/>
needs is an abundance of positive reactions to him, his interests, his life.  <br/>
And he needs a break from pressure and criticism.  And if you the mom are <br/>
going to criticize and rag on him, he might decide he&#39;d just as soon go back <br/>
to school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I  can understand the acting out of anger but gee I would hate to be <br/>

<br/>
Remove negativity and add positive regard.<br/>
He&#39;s like a battery, storing up negativity.  An outlet (listening to harsh <br/>
lyrics) will get it out better than your prevention of outlets.  <br/>
<br/>
The real negativity is criticism of his appearance and preferences, not his <br/>
&quot;exposure&quot; to how others have expressed their frustrations.<br/>

Our culture hurts boys a lot and doesn&#39;t let them cry.  Maybe you could<br/>
consider the hostile/foul language to be his replacement for crying and<br/>
let him let it out some more?  I don&#39;t think it will be permanent.<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  Maybe renting some macho revenge movies (like with Stallone) would<br/>
be cathartic, or some movies about high school cruelty.  (Powder and<br/>
Never Been Kissed come to mind, but other people on the list probably<br/>
have better ideas.)<br/>
<br/>
Almost any movie about anything is going to have major scenes that allow<br/>
some vicarious emotional relief.  Just renting movies that appeal to<br/>
your son can be a bit therapeutic.  Art can be healing.  Even not very<br/>
good art.</div>

He crys he laughs and he seethes and curses and rants and he does it in <br/>
writing too.  I am glad he can let it out. I tend to let things out too, in <br/>
short blasts.  I can&#39;t help it.  Life has been really tough for us this year, <br/>
 but we are getting through it as best we can.  I do not believe I am  overly <br/>
 worried nor denying him that opportunity.. I thought feedback from others <br/>
might help me know how better to deal with what was happening...as I was <br/>
disturbed about certain aspects of it.  I apologize if this was all off <br/>
topic, I just had a feeling that I would get some great ideas from this list. <br/>
 It does seem more like a parenting issue.<br/>

<br/>
But some parenting issues are pre-requisite to unschooling working.  <br/>
<br/>
Being fresh from a conference, I&#39;m thinking in terms of what was happening <br/>
there, and if you don&#39;t have peace in your home and if you and your child <br/>
don&#39;t trust one another, unschooling isn&#39;t going to blossom and grow up and <br/>
around you both.<br/>
