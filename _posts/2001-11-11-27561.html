<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404302780">Hello All!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Carla & I am a chronic lurker (Well, not anymore). I have <br/>
3 kids (near 7, 4 & 1 1/2). I am moving to Northern Idaho next year & <br/>
am trying to find other Idaho homeschoolers to correspond with.  I <br/>
have been searching for groups, but not had much success.  Do any of <br/>
you live in Idaho -OR- can give me some leads to groups in the <br/>
state?  I prefer an inclusive/eclective group.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, any information or opinions on living there would be much <br/>
appreciated.  I am from California & have read accounts of newcomers <br/>
not being welcomed.  Any truth to this? I am encouraged after reading <br/>
about what a homeschool friendly state it is (at least the laws <br/>
appear to be).  <br/>
<br/>
Please, any info welcomed.  Feel free to e-mail me privately.</div>

is from Idaho.  Did you understand any of that?  I&#39;ll ask if she has any<br/>

If you don&#39;t find any nice unschoolers in Idaho you can join our MT list.<br/>
 Not to many of us but we keep each other sane.  Is religion an issue for<br/>
you?  We have some Christians, some Wiccans, some ? .   Altogether a very<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188889828">You might want to go to the web site for Holt Associates at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gws.com">http://www.gws.com</a> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gws.com/">http://www.gws.com/</a>&gt;  and order the 2002 Directory,<br/>
which is included in the last issue of GWS. The Directory lists families and<br/>
organizations by location, and readers leaned pretty heavily towards<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Id tell you how many listings are there for Idaho, but Ive misplaced the<br/>
issue.<br/>
<br/>
The Directory is something I think people will miss, now that GWS is no more<br/>
(see the thread titled Growing Without Schoolings Demise, on<br/>
unschooling.coms Message Boards, for more on this).<br/>
