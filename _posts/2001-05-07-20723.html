 &quot; Please give me one example of a child that was<br/>

 Sometimes what is more damaged by spanking a child is<br/>
 the trust between parent and child not so much the<br/>
 child themselves although that is obviously up for<br/>
 debate here too.<br/>
 Imagine yourself as a child loving and trusting, even<br/>
 adoring this &quot;big person&quot; in your life who so far has<br/>
 nurtured you and kept you safe in every way. Now<br/>
 imagine that same person inflicting physical pain on<br/>
 you for not knowing any better,for making a mistake,<br/>
 for testing the world around you.<br/>
 It seems very sad to me...<br/>
 Yes you still love and adore that big person but do<br/>
 you ever really trust that they won&#39;t hurt you? I<br/>
 somehow doubt that.<br/>
 We can say we don&#39;t remember the sadness and<br/>
 humiliation of the spankings we recieved as children<br/>
 all we want but the relationship between ourselves and<br/>
 our parents changed from that first strike on. Trust<br/>
 me it did.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Actually,  in quite a few states if a teacher or principal hits a student <br/>
it is<br/>
 not termed assault at all.   Even if injuries result and even if parents have<br/>
 requested that their child not be physically disciplined.<br/>

   NO ONE touches my child inappropriately. You&#39;d better believe I would take <br/>
this to the top and not another child would be struck by a teacher or <br/>
principle again.<br/>
