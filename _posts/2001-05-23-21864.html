<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458211706">I must have deleted the post that Cindy is responding<br/>
to, I deleted a bunch without reading them......I must<br/>
have deleted the post that Sandra was responding to,<br/>
too,thank goodness!  But I think we all agree with<br/>
Cindy.  Please don&#39;t feel bad, Sandra.  Your smile in<br/>
your picture on your web-site is positively<br/>
breathtaking.  That grin says so much about who you<br/>
are!<br/>

&gt; from your posts and<br/>
&gt; even when I don&#39;t agree with them, I find them<br/>
&gt; thought-provoking.  I<br/>
