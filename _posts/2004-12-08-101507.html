&quot;If you are giving lots of approval to the schoolish<br/>
appearing games, you may be devaluing their other choices. One result<br/>
could<br/>
be to make the children feel wrong or vaguely guilty about their &quot;trivial&quot;<br/>
interests; another could be to create secrets between parent and child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am new to this group.  I started homeschooling a little over a year<br/>
ago and started out unschooling.  I occassionaly &quot;lose faith&quot; as they<br/>
say, so much so that I bought a Calvert curriculum this year.  But I<br/>
am happy to say that my kids let me know pretty fast that they prefer<br/>
unschooling.  (Thank goodness for E-bay!)  Anyway, the words above<br/>
really hit home with me as I have totally created this situation with<br/>
my son.  My son feels totally guilty about the games and cartoons he<br/>
loves.  He goes to his father&#39;s house on weekends and they really<br/>
enjoy these activities together.  Sometimes my son will not tell me<br/>
about a game he has played or movie he has seen that he thinks I might<br/>
not like.  Then he will have a total break-down of guilt.  Any ideas<br/>
on how to mend my evil ways?  He&#39;s 7 years old.  He&#39;s a great kid and<br/>
he has a great father.  I really never meant to create this<br/>
atmosphere.  Will time help the situation if I just stop acting that<br/>
way or should I make ammends somehow?</div>

If you never said anything about it, how would he know<br/>
that you were no longer judging him? And an apology<br/>
would certainly be appopriate and would go a long way<br/>
toward mending this part of your relationship!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, and you could also explain why you have had a prejudice against tv <br/>
and video games in the past (your childhood, societal pressure...) and <br/>
tell him that you&#39;re working on changing this because now you believe <br/>
these things do have value.<br/>

Buy him Donkey Konga for Christmas? With two sets of drums? One for each of you? &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Play long. It&#39;s fun! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
