 It crosses my mind that there are many religious faiths in which submission <br/>
to<br/>
 authority is a basic tenet of faith.  I have wondered whether unschooling is<br/>
 compatible with a faith which requires belief and reliance on a greater <br/>
authority.<br/>
 It may be a difficult task to encourage freedom of thought and choice on the <br/>
one<br/>
 hand and &quot;unquestioning&quot; obedience on the other.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting that this has just recently came up, because yesterday I had come<br/>
to the conclusion that it is very possible to be a Christian unschooler and in<br/>
fact, unschool faith and religious education.  I have done no formal learning<br/>
with my dd (6) and she has a strong faith and a prayer life outside the one<br/>
that we share together.  I believe that I have modeled my faith to my children<br/>
and like anything in our life that is important or interesting we have had<br/>
discussions about it.  I have been delighted with this personal observation!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same here.  I view my relationship with God to be the perfect example of the <br/>
unschooling ideals.  It&#39;s all about inspiration, freedom to explore, internal <br/>
motivation and ethics which are part of everything I do.  As a Christian I&#39;m <br/>
not bound by the status quo but to an eventual higher calling.  Isn&#39;t that <br/>
what we are trying to help our kids to find by unschooling them?<br/>

I just don&#39;t think of my religion that way (Chrstianity).  My religion is<br/>
about God&#39;s love and how he saved us from our sins.  No conflict with<br/>
unschooling!!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; But do you think religious people can be unschoolers?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some I don&#39;t think can.  <br/>
<br/>
When a family&#39;s priorities include in the top five saving their children&#39;s <br/>
souls from hell, and obedience and discipline, I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll be able to <br/>
make natural learning work.<br/>
<br/>
Some can.  If they&#39;re interested in the uplifting messages of their religion <br/>
and in compassion and love, yes.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my opinion, and people can say &quot;I&#39;m unschooling&quot; just because <br/>
they don&#39;t care whether a kid does math first or reading, and they don&#39;t care if <br/>
the kid does the reading outside, or the math in the den instead of at the <br/>
kitchen table.  That&#39;s some people&#39;s unschooling.  It&#39;s not self-sustaining, and <br/>
it doesn&#39;t work the deep personal changes that (what I consider) &quot;real&quot; <br/>
unschooling does.  I don&#39;t think flexibly scheduled structure is far enough removed <br/>
from structure.<br/>
<br/>
Some people think structure is what separates them from the animals and makes <br/>
them more like God.  If that&#39;s important to them, then it is, and they should <br/>
structure the heck out of everything within reach.<br/>
<br/>
But they shouldn&#39;t do it on this list.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Were you directing this question just to Sandra (since<br/>
hers was the message you were responding to), or to<br/>
everyone?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the question should be can religion be<br/>
unschooled, and how?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t used to be able to truly unschool because of<br/>
my religious legalism, although I thought I was. <br/>
While my children didn&#39;t have to do &quot;school&quot; for 6<br/>
hours a day like their friends, they did have a very<br/>
structured day with chore charts and bedtimes and<br/>
bookwork and such.  I would build unit studies based<br/>
on their interests, and come up with activities and<br/>
books to read and field trips.  And I could not<br/>
believe that math could be truly unschooled, so they<br/>
did have math workbooks they had to do.  But if anyone<br/>
asked, I was an unschooler, especially compared to my<br/>
school-at-home friends.<br/>
<br/>
 Now unschooling means something much deeper to me,<br/>
and has allowed my religion to go to a deeper place as<br/>
well.  Now it is all fused into the whole of my life. <br/>
My children are a part of it, and so they absorb it as<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t make them read their bibles or pray or go to<br/>
Sunday School, or even go to church if they don&#39;t want<br/>
to.  But they see me doing these things, and hopefully<br/>
with sincerity and not out of a sense of duty, so ask<br/>
questions and we talk about it.  The older two have<br/>
both gone in spurts where they will read their bibles<br/>
or offer to pray for someone who is ill or sad.<br/>
<br/>
The older two usually want to go to church for the<br/>
social atmosphere where they can hang with their<br/>
friends, and the 5yo does have to go when we all go,<br/>
but he takes his toys or books and if he chooses I<br/>
stay out in the hallway with him where he can play<br/>
instead of go to class.<br/>
<br/>
It took a lot of time to get to this place though. <br/>
Probably can go a lot farther, and will, by the end of<br/>
my lifetime.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336901927">I don&#39;t see why someone who believes in God and Jesus cannot unschool.  I <br/>
personally have a very close prayerful relationship with God and so does my son, <br/>
but it was his choice not mine.  My parents never forced me to be religious <br/>
either, it was my choice.  Religion and spirituality will not work unless it is <br/>
a personal choice.  How could someone think that they could force a belief <br/>
system on someone?  Religion is the most personal thing there is, or at least <br/>
that is the way I have always seen it.  <br/>
<br/>
I have also always tried to expose him to all sides of political issues as <br/>
well.  When we are in the car we listen to Rush Limbaugh some of the time and <br/>
our local Pacifica station some of the time.  I don&#39;t think you can get more <br/>
extreme than both of those perspectives.  lol  The outcome right now is funny as <br/>
well, I prefer Pacifica and he prefers Rush.  I think my son is way more <br/>
conservative than I am.  In fact he has been known to refer to me as a Hippie.  lol<br/>
<br/>
I am new to unschooling, but now that I have written this I see that maybe I <br/>
am more of an unschooler than I thought a week ago.  If I can allow my child <br/>
the choice about his relationship with God, then surly I can let him decide <br/>
when he wants to do Algebra.  (Just a rambling thought. lol)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps some of you who don&#39;t think you can be religious and <br/>
homeschool.<br/>
