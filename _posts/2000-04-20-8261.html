&lt;&lt; As my son is 11, I haven&#39;t had experience with how people treat teens.  I<br/>
 do know that many use different standards for kids than for adults. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bear in mind it&#39;s only my observation, but in many years of observing, I <br/>
haven&#39;t seen too many exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
At your son&#39;s age, I&#39;d like to suggest that, if you&#39;re not already, perhaps <br/>
you could consider finding a volunteer activity you enjoy and find important, <br/>
that your son can &#39;tag along&#39; on and help out with, and maybe be inspired by <br/>
at some point.  Few things can get a kid more engaged in the world than <br/>
finding out his/her efforts really do count, really do make a difference, and <br/>
really are appreciated, even when the work being done is not something you <br/>
would have expected him to be interested in.  An organization with good <br/>
volunteer management practices (volunteers are equal to paid staff in value, <br/>
are regularly appreciated both publicly and privately, are expected to act <br/>
professionally, and are given performance reviews, etc) is an especially good <br/>
place to start, if that&#39;s available to you.<br/>
<br/>
Then he would be ready and confident and have references for when he wants to <br/>
strike out into activities he chooses for himself.  I have found that with <br/>
most people, if the child acts sure of him/herself, that people will respond <br/>
in a positive manner.  Assuming, of course, that sureness is not simply <br/>
arrogance, but brings with it respect for others :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a good idea.  He did some volunteer work for a local organization<br/>
as part of earning a Webelo Scouts badge.  He worked really hard and was<br/>
very much appreciated.  I suggested he volunteer on a regular basis, but he<br/>
was&#39;t interested.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly enough, lately I&#39;ve been thinking we might both volunteer<br/>
together.  Though, that day he enjoyed doing it on his own, with me reading<br/>
in the waiting room.<br/>
