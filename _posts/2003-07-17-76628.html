I too am working thru &quot;Dad&quot; stuff including (ain&#39;t it funny how these things<br/>
fit together) yesterday remembering a vicious beating my Dad laid on me and<br/>
my brother.  Mom confronted him about it and I defended him.  I was 5, maybe<br/>

Kim, have you had anything similar?  Anyone else dealt with this kind of<br/>

poisoning or something, but I think I just needed to &quot;let loose&quot; and<br/>
couldn&#39;t yet do it with my feelings.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear that those kind of things happened to you. In my <br/>
situation it was my mom who would defend my dad for beating me, my brother, and my <br/>
sister. For many years my sister and I told my mom he was doing things to us <br/>
that daddy&#39;s shouldn&#39;t do and she would defend him and punish us. Our mom was <br/>
very strict, controlling and always angry. Later they divorced when he went to <br/>
jail and till this day claims she new nothing and I just don&#39;t believe her. I <br/>
cannot remember anything about my childhood except for what dad did to me and <br/>
what mom does to me till this day. Doctors have told me that I have suppressed <br/>
it because obviously it hurt so much.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now I feel all flu-y and my whole body is heavy with the thot of it. Kim, <br/>
have you had anything similar?&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, every time I thought about it my whole body would just feel miserable. <br/>
At times I would be sick to my stomach. Up to about 3 years ago, I would have <br/>
panic attacks just thinking about it. I ran away from home when I was a teen <br/>
and became an alcoholic. It wasn&#39;t till I met my husband who tenderly took me <br/>
under his wing that I straighten up and started to deal with all these emotions. <br/>
I have not had a drink since and I haven&#39;t lived home with mom since I was a <br/>
teen. Still till this day I can feel achy at times but I&#39;m really dealing more <br/>
with anger that I have never experienced since I came to this list! Something <br/>
about this list makes me angry, not at anyone in particular although at times <br/>
I take that anger out here. I don&#39;t know what it is and I can&#39;t put it in <br/>
words. I&#39;m determined to break that habit though and one of these days I&#39;ll have <br/>
courage enough to tell mom where to go.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This was me also and still is. I suffer from ulcers due to stress.<br/>
<br/>
Also stress had caused me to miscarry 2 times, once this past Christmas. The <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about you, but I can say for me that sometimes I get so angry<br/>
and have jealousy feelings toward these children that are the children of<br/>
people on this list because they are respected so deeply.  They are such<br/>
treasured children that are getting the best possible childhood imaginable.<br/>
I wish that I would have had a childhood like them with parents like these.<br/>
It can never happen now because I am now an adult, with children of my own.<br/>
The best I can do and have now is to give my own children what I wish that I<br/>
would have had and to treat myself with respect and motherly love, without<br/>
being overbearing.  I can&#39;t live my childhood over (and I wouldn&#39;t want<br/>
to!), but I can hope that I am creating a better life for all of my<br/>
decendants and the people that I come in contact with today.  My anger is<br/>
pain of past hurts and past needs that were never met.  It stems from<br/>
resentment of all that I have put up with and have &quot;allowed&quot; even after I<br/>
knew things were wrong.  I felt powerless.  Now, I am gaining power.  I wish<br/>
the same for you.  I think we can all find some on this list if we let<br/>
ourselves.<br/>

<br/>
Does she have e-mail?<br/>
I&#39;ll tell her.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, though, you don&#39;t have to tell her where to go (unless she&#39;s STILL <br/>
on you telling you what to do and how to be, and even then you can just face <br/>
the other way and turn up the music).<br/>
<br/>
If you just detach emotionally and kinda build a fire-break between you and <br/>
her, and let it erode away into a chasm that fills in with pretty ferns and <br/>
flowers and put your mental windows in the direction where you don&#39;t see her all <br/>
the time (another form of mentally turning your back), the view will just be <br/>
more beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve spent enough anguish and attention on you mom, just tally it up and <br/>
say &quot;Enough for a lifetime&quot; and as you decide each other moment&#39;s attention <br/>
and priority, don&#39;t let it be your mom.  Let that just be an unfortunate past <br/>
problem which informs your present as to how not to be.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.  It&#39;s possible to breathe in &quot;now&quot; and breathe out sorrow, and thereby <br/>
fill yourself up with more fresh-oxygen &quot;now.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you wrote that, because it is SO hard (almost impossible) to try to <br/>
help people believe that it truly DOES matter not just what they do (with <br/>
parenting and unschooling, I&#39;m thinking specifically) but WHY they do it.  That <br/>
acting like a concerned parent isn&#39;t the same as BEING a concerned parent.  That <br/>
acting like a child can learn on his own isn&#39;t the same as believing it and <br/>
acting from that deepseated, part-of-your-fabric belief.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe that&#39;s why some people get into the frustrated-to-furious range, on <br/>
both sides.<br/>
<br/>
Some people say &quot;Don&#39;t criticize that mom--she&#39;s doing the best she can and <br/>
she came here for support.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then others will say &quot;But she&#39;s not &#39;doing&#39; so much as she&#39;s acting,&quot; and <br/>
others say action can precede belief.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, though, to act a way you don&#39;t really believe.  It&#39;s like holding <br/>
your breath and then running out of breath and saying &quot;I did that as long as I <br/>
could.&quot;<br/>
&quot;What?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Breathed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But breathing is in and out both, and it&#39;s unconscious and subconscious and <br/>
happens even when you&#39;re asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling as long as you can won&#39;t last very long if it&#39;s like one inhale <br/>
and quickly trusting-your-kids-and-giving-them-freedom until the exhale is <br/>
necessary and that&#39;s IT, the next intake of energy might involve shaming and <br/>
workbooks and school-threats.  <br/>
<br/>
Kinda like breathing, when unschooling becomes unconscious and subconscious <br/>
and happens even when you&#39;re asleep, there are moments you do it with conscious <br/>
awareness and presence (like consciously taking deep breaths) and sometimes <br/>
when it&#39;s just in the background of other things, but it involves a <br/>
life-supporting in and out steadiness.<br/>
<br/>
I have rambled into vagueness and so will stop.  If I lost anyone, don&#39;t feel <br/>
one bit bad.  It might not make sense outside my own head.<br/>

<br/>
In the 1980&#39;s there was a LOT of group-counselling and self-help-group <br/>
busienss about &quot;healing the inner child&quot; and it might be worth doing a google search <br/>
for some of that. It can be really, really soothing to &quot;reparent,&quot; and <br/>
generally involves communicating with your inner child, meaning (as I understood it <br/>
when I was going to adult children of alcoholics meetings in 1985/86 and a few <br/>
years thereafter) soothe your memories. <br/>
<br/>
I would picture myself and my emotions at ten years old and say to myself <br/>
&quot;You were NOT crazy to wish things had been better!  It was okay to feel that <br/>
way, and it wasn&#39;t you who were wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Even though it was twenty years or more later, when I would give my younger <br/>
self those soothing little mental massages, it honestly did feel better.<br/>
<br/>
So vaguely thinking about your childhood as a whole can be just disturbing <br/>
and overwhelming, but if you think of one moment when you were afraid and <br/>
frustrated and &quot;talk to that child&quot; (in your head, or out loud rocking and holding <br/>
yourself or your teddy bear if you still have it) it can be healing.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t need it.  Some do.  I did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325945164">Didn&#39;t loose me..  After years of unschooling, it just is.  It goes for weeks as normal, like after you learn to drive and you take a trip and realize that an hour has flown by, but somehow you clutched and steered and washed the window, but didn&#39;t even notice.  &quot;In the Zone!&quot; we used to call it.<br/>
<br/>
My parenting is slipping more into the Zone and this list is helping a lot.  I read stuff and realize I can&#39;t yell at the kids w/o damage - the damage I went thru.  I want it to stop in this generation.  That&#39;s like when I quit smoking after I got married.  No more smokers.  I stops here.  And no more hitting/yelling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183894895">&lt;&lt; Does she have e-mail? I&#39;ll tell her.  &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh, your just the person I&#39;d need! &lt;g&gt; But she doesn&#39;t have e-mail or <br/>
Internet. She hates them. She thinks they are a big waste of time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Seriously, though, you don&#39;t have to tell her where to go (unless she&#39;s <br/>
STILL <br/>
on you telling you what to do and how to be, and even then you can just face <br/>
the other way and turn up the music).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, she is still carrying on but for the most part I&#39;m doing a good job <br/>
ignoring it. At times it gets to me and I let the anger consume me. She is <br/>
finally talking to all of us again but only because she&#39;s on a control trip, trying <br/>
to convince us we are going about life all wrong.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Let that just be an unfortunate past problem which informs your present as <br/>
to how not to be.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wonderfully said Sandra. I&#39;ve saved this so I can always remind myself that! <br/>
Thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe.  It&#39;s possible to breathe in &quot;now&quot; and breathe out sorrow, and <br/>
thereby <br/>
fill yourself up with more fresh-oxygen &quot;now.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572417275">&lt;&lt;That acting like a concerned parent isn&#39;t the same as BEING a concerned <br/>
parent.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That was always us Sandra. We were not the type of parents that hit, yelled, <br/>
etc. We were very strict, we would punish for the stupidest things. I can see <br/>
that I was being controlling just like my mom. I might have showed a lot of <br/>
love and concern for Christopher but I was not BEING the loving, concerned <br/>
parent I said I was.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So maybe that&#39;s why some people get into the frustrated-to-furious range, <br/>
on <br/>
both sides.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know for me it was, especially when I first came here. It was hard to <br/>
see that I was not &quot;getting it&quot; because I thought I had it! For me, that made <br/>
me angry. I think because I wanted to &quot;get it&quot; so badly. I adore my son and <br/>
when he had his accident, I realized how short life is and how much I have not <br/>
given him and how much I had taken away. I&#39;ve always been a caring person but I <br/>
guess the way I was raised and continue to be treated has rubbed off on me <br/>
some.<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt;I have rambled into vagueness and so will stop.  If I lost anyone, don&#39;t <br/>
feel <br/>
one bit bad.  It might not make sense outside my own head.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I agree Aimee, and sometimes even longer. I ran away from home when I was <br/>
almost 15. When I was home my mom held 2 jobs while dad stayed home and had his <br/>
way with us. <br/>
So, my mom sortta &quot;had&quot; me for 15 years and I&#39;m now 35. 20 years is a long <br/>

It makes so much sense.  Thank you for this.   And for the following:<br/>
<br/>
**If you just detach emotionally and kinda build a fire-break between you<br/>
and<br/>
her, and let it erode away into a chasm that fills in with pretty ferns and<br/>
flowers and put your mental windows in the direction where you don&#39;t see her<br/>
all<br/>
the time (another form of mentally turning your back), the view will just be<br/>
more beautiful.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also at this point with my mother.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am going to put trust onto her to learn something.   Just like I am<br/>
trusting my children with their learning.  Granted she might not get it<br/>
since she has so much other &#39;stuff&#39; ingrained in her.   But  how many times<br/>
can I explain unschooling/attachment parenting to her?    There&#39;s a point<br/>
where she has to grasp it herself.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she will,  maybe she won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m doing the right thing :)<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; So maybe that&#39;s why some people get into the frustrated-to-furious range,<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; both sides.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people say &quot;Don&#39;t criticize that mom--she&#39;s doing the best she can<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; she came here for support.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then others will say &quot;But she&#39;s not &#39;doing&#39; so much as she&#39;s acting,&quot; and<br/>
&gt; others say action can precede belief.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard, though, to act a way you don&#39;t really believe.  It&#39;s like<br/>
holding<br/>
&gt; your breath and then running out of breath and saying &quot;I did that as long<br/>
as I<br/>
&gt; could.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;What?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Breathed.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But breathing is in and out both, and it&#39;s unconscious and subconscious<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; happens even when you&#39;re asleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling as long as you can won&#39;t last very long if it&#39;s like one<br/>
inhale<br/>
&gt; and quickly trusting-your-kids-and-giving-them-freedom until the exhale is<br/>
&gt; necessary and that&#39;s IT, the next intake of energy might involve shaming<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; workbooks and school-threats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kinda like breathing, when unschooling becomes unconscious and<br/>
subconscious<br/>
&gt; and happens even when you&#39;re asleep, there are moments you do it with<br/>
conscious<br/>
&gt; awareness and presence (like consciously taking deep breaths) and<br/>
sometimes<br/>
&gt; when it&#39;s just in the background of other things, but it involves a<br/>
&gt; life-supporting in and out steadiness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have rambled into vagueness and so will stop.  If I lost anyone, don&#39;t<br/>
feel<br/>

    Just because someone is family, doesn&#39;t mean they have an automatic right <br/>
to be part of your life.  If someone is in your life and they have a negative <br/>
effect on you, or are keeping you from healing from pain and hurts, they <br/>
don&#39;t have to be in your life anymore, even if they are blood.  You have a choice <br/>
to live a better life, without all the negativity, and attempts to control and <br/>
demean you.  If you&#39;re constantly healing from recent hurts, you might not <br/>
get back to deal with the formative ones, the ones that can change your life.  <br/>
<br/>
    Personally, I haven&#39;t talked to my father since I was 15 years old.  I <br/>
don&#39;t miss him much.  There isn&#39;t much to miss.  The good stuff, I remember, and <br/>
the bad stuff is behind me, now.<br/>
     I know it&#39;s hard, but once you step away, it feels so good your forget <br/>
to feel guilty about it!! lol And I still keep in touch with that side of the <br/>
family, just not him.  I still love my grandparents, and aunts and uncles, and <br/>
they understand, so I know I am lucky, with that.  <br/>
<br/>
    One of the things I love about being home with my son, and him being home <br/>
with me, (and not constantly dealing with the negativity in school) is that <br/>
we are able to consciously choose who we spend time with.  I would say to you, <br/>
choose wisely.  It really does matter.  <br/>

you emotionally unless YOU give it to them.  Why can&#39;t you simply ignore <br/>
their stupid remarks?  They are still part of your child&#39;s heritage, and they will <br/>
not be around for ever.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a lot of the same issues, and I do have the advantage of living far <br/>
away from all relatives and in-laws, but we would never dream of preventing <br/>
their occasional contact with the children.  In fact I have to remind my dh, who <br/>
groans every time his parents come, &quot;they don&#39;t come to see US!  They come <br/>
10,000 miles to see the children.  They won&#39;t be around forever.  You can stand <br/>
it.&quot;  (And then he calls his co-workers and quietly arranges to trade shifts so <br/>
he&#39;s at work when they are here.  Good thing hospitals are staffed 24/7, LOL!)<br/>

Don&#39;t be surprised if your kids retaliate by keeping your grandkids away from <br/>

But, I found that I eventually subjected my kids to the same hurtful remarks. For years, I had my mother over, was pleasent in the face of abusive remarks to me and my dh cos I thought - welll, she is older and lonely and she is my mum and I am sending a good message to the boys about family and care. No! I was sending a message about becoming a victim - cos, a few Christmases ago, we paid for my mother to visit from inter state and she and my aunt took the abusive remarks to a new height - attacking and making fun of my older three teenage son. They were now considered fair game, while the younger ones were still little and cute, in my mother&#39;s eyes. <br/>
<br/>
When the abuse reached my kids, I stopped the visits. I think it would have been best if I has stopped them earlier...Leonie<br/>
