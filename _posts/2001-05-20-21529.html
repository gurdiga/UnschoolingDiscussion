<div id="ygrps-yiv-147077823">Hi everyone! My name is Laura Yolo, my dh John and I<br/>
are homeschooling our 9yo ds Noah in central<br/>
Washington state. We also have a 16mo ds Aidan at home<br/>
during the day. Our older three children are from my<br/>
first marriage, they are dd&#39;s Jenny 15 and Ryan 11.5,<br/>
who live with us and attend public school because of<br/>
our custody agreement. And ds Shaw almost 14, who<br/>
lives with my ex-husband in Florida and attends public<br/>
school. This has been our first year back to<br/>
homeschooling after ds spent 2 very bad years in<br/>
public school. <br/>
<br/>
We have been using Sonlight curriculum on and off this<br/>
year. It&#39;s a great curriculum, we actually both love<br/>
the books, but I don&#39;t really follow their schedule.<br/>
The more reading I do about unschooling, the more I<br/>
realize how much of this philosophy I agree with. I am<br/>
a terrible chicken though and I&#39;m afraid not to buy a<br/>
curriculum, even if I don&#39;t use half of it. So I&#39;m<br/>
here to learn and ask a bunch of questions so I can<br/>
build my confidence and maybe save us $500 worth of<br/>
curriculum this year. I look forward to getting to<br/>
know everyone:-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks for the welcome, Johanna! I think I&#39;ve already<br/>
cut my curriculum list in half, lol! I really think I<br/>
just needed the extra courage to follow my heart. My<br/>
dh is wonderfully supportive and really allows me to<br/>
take the lead when it comes to the educational<br/>
atmosphere of the home. I must admit that I&#39;m still a<br/>
little worried over whether or not ds will learn basic<br/>
math skills w/out a curriculum(can you tell that math<br/>
is not my thing;-) But I think that we will all be a<br/>
lot happier just living life and learning about our<br/>
interests together.<br/>
