<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576522118"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Hello all.  My name is Wendy and I am the mother of an amazing and<br/>
&gt;incredible 11 year old boy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Wendy and welcome. I just love the way you started this email. :o) I wish <br/>
that all parents would first see their kids as wonderful and amazing. <br/>
Everything else is just details.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;ve gotten somewhat better over the past few years, but recently <br/>
&gt;&gt;(literally days ago) my son approached me with the idea of unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He DOES sound amazing. Sounds like he&#39;s done his research and has the <br/>
confidence to forge a different path.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and eventually latched on to my own interests and am now an avid reader, <br/>
&gt;&gt;writer, learner, liver, etc.  Why can&#39;t I trust my son to do the same?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve been conditioned by the &quot;experts&quot; not to trust your son. It&#39;s a <br/>
pretty all encompassing societal message. There&#39;s no shame. You&#39;re open to <br/>
this new idea. That&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m afraid he&#39;ll never be motivated to pick up a book or look up something <br/>
&gt;&gt;that he&#39;s interested in.  I worry that college will be out of his reach.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not just take some time off altogether to deschool and get used to this <br/>
new way of living. Get yourself used to observing the learning that is going <br/>
on. It won&#39;t look like school-research papers, book reports, etc-but it will <br/>
be learning for the sake of getting information he needs. Parent him NOW as <br/>
an 11 year old incredible, amazing boy. College is well within his reach, <br/>
but you don&#39;t need to stress over it NOW. That&#39;s for the schools.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
~Mary<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The miracle is not to walk on water. The miracle is to walk on the green <br/>
earth, dwelling deeply in the present moment and feeling truly alive.&quot;<br/>
