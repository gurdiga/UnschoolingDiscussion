<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903836917">joshua writes &lt;&lt;he only solution I have thought of so far is to re-educate <br/>
myself and then<br/>
<br/>
share what I am learning in the form of &quot;stories&quot;... and hopefully spawn an<br/>
<br/>
interest so that later on they will continue to add pieces to the puzzle as<br/>
<br/>
they present themselves in life.  I like the idea of making it into an<br/>
<br/>
engrossing tale I can share with them.  It just seems to me this is one area<br/>
<br/>
where natural learning might require a lot of &quot;homework&quot; on my part!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
what a great concept!  i like this approach!  and storytelling can be so <br/>
compelling.  it wouldnt hurt me much to go this route since there is so much <br/>
i&#39;d like to learn that i missed or that wasnt presented...  i remember a <br/>
substitute teacher in highschool that was such a mess she would regularly be <br/>
in tears instead of teaching class... what a joke-- sad, too!<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i have been thinking that just to continue to collect resources that <br/>
are of interest to us in this area as in others, and read and share as it <br/>
happens.  you hear of the &quot;chronological approach&quot; etc, but it is all too <br/>
contrived and i am not yet convinced of the value of presenting it in a <br/>
particular order just for the benefit of learning it better.  it seems to me <br/>
we would do just as well to read what we like and then try to place it in <br/>
context (with a timeline or similar discussion..)  <br/>
<br/>
i end up feeling, like with other areas, that there is just so much to <br/>
cover/learn about content wise...  but collecting good resources so that our <br/>
environment has the tools that we need when something comes up has always <br/>
worked so far, so at this point that is where i am headed.<br/>
