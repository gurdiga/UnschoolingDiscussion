<div id="ygrps-yiv-706392935">I appreciate all the viewpoints.<br/>
<br/>
I, too, think that math past the second or third grade is something <br/>
that I will work on with my children with a text.  Perhaps not every <br/>
day like I have been...I&#39;m beginning to see I&#39;m maybe making my son<br/>
do <br/>
 useless work that he already knows in some cases.  However, I *do* <br/>
want him prepared to see certain techniques/problems that may come up <br/>
in a test should the state so decide we must take one.  So on that <br/>
standpoint, I think we will continue to use a math text to some <br/>
extent.  I can&#39;t handle him not knowing this stuff!  But I won&#39;t be<br/>
as <br/>
obsessive as I have been.<br/>
<br/>
As far as my 5 yo ds is concerned, I&#39;m just planning on letting him <br/>
fly and learn as we go....there is so much out there in real life to <br/>
learn math from!  It&#39;s just that it seems that past the 2nd or 3rd <br/>
grade it really changes......<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks to everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680026793">I&#39;m reminded here of some quote from somewhere (sorry to be so <br/>
vague, but I realy can&#39;t remember the details) about how all the <br/>
maths ever taught in schools from Kto12 can be taught in about 8 <br/>
weeks to people who are committed to learning and interested in <br/>
the subject matter.  If the only reason to &#39;teach&#39; maths, ie use a <br/>
text or curriculum is to make sure they can cope with the level of <br/>
maths needed for college etc, I think I would cross that bridge <br/>
when it arrived.  If someone needs to learn something to be able <br/>
to do something important, then, surely (as long as the love of <br/>
learning hasn&#39;t been snuffed...) they will, and far quicker and <br/>
more completely than at a time when they&#39;re disinterested.<br/>
<br/>
Well done for owning the problem!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s a Gatto quote and IF my memory serves me right I think<br/>
it&#39;s actually 8 days. He said something similar in a speech at our HSing<br/>
conference three yrs ago he was our keynote speaker.<br/>
A friends daughter decided she wanted to try highschool [ for either the<br/>
gr 9 or 10 year]. She&#39;d never done much math at home (they are committed<br/>
unschoolers). <br/>
When she failed her first math test she and her mother sat down and got<br/>
her caught up to either gr 9 or 10 in a matter of days.<br/>
She never had a math problem since and I believe she was asked to be on<br/>
a math team or ended up doing the advanced stream of math through<br/>
highschool.<br/>
