<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I am learning from a book and tape series, and then 
I send a Pure Voice message to my instructor about once a week.&nbsp; He 
critiques it and sends another PV back to me.&nbsp; This doesn&#39;t start with 
complete phonics, I learned the sounds of the letters and some of the 
combinations.&nbsp; Others I learn as I come to them.&nbsp; It starts out with 
conversations and grammar is learned along with that.&nbsp; The lessons are very 
agricultural, so I can use many of the words I am learning.&nbsp; I try&nbsp;to 
make sentences in Gaelic whenever I can, which confounds my kids since none of 
them are learning it!&nbsp; I am surprised at how much they are picking up 
though just from hearing me practice.&nbsp; I try to practice every day, but 
some days I am just too busy.&nbsp; I make it 5-6 days a week.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I love the language though, and if I can only talk 
to myself, that won&#39;t be anything new!</font></div>
