double checking my harvest with a very experienced mushroom hunter friend of<br/>
mine!  He died a few years ago (from old age, not mushrooms! &lt;G&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280965684">The kids and I went to go see a talk today by the &quot;Reptile Man&quot;. He <br/>
brought lots of different reptiles with him and was really <br/>
fascinating. But the thing he said that refers to the title of this <br/>
post is that he wanted to figure out how to de-venomize snakes. So he <br/>
went to the library and read all that he could read about it. Then he <br/>
went out and found a bunch of road-kill rattlesnakes to disect and <br/>
practice on. Eventually, he figured out a technique to de-venomize <br/>
snakes, and now he travels around and does the technique on various <br/>
snakes around the country. <br/>
<br/>
I just thought that was a pretty amazing thing to have taught <br/>
oneself, and an interesting way to have gone about it... <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Things I learned outside of school as a kid:<br/>
<br/>
How to read<br/>
sewing <br/>
knitting<br/>
crocheting<br/>
painting (my room, repeatedly)<br/>
baking (had my own mini-pie business at age 8)<br/>
some auto mechanics<br/>
tending animals; sheep, cows, chickens<br/>
<br/>
As an adult:<br/>
<br/>
more auto mechanics (rebuilt my engine)<br/>
painting houses professionally<br/>
drawing topographical maps<br/>
welding<br/>
blacksmithing<br/>
architectural drafting<br/>
gardening<br/>
<br/>
everything it takes to build a house including;<br/>
forming a foundation<br/>
pouring concrete<br/>
framing<br/>
plumbing <br/>
wiring, electrical and communications<br/>
heating ductwork (sheetmetal)<br/>
gas pipe<br/>
drywall<br/>
shingles<br/>
roofing<br/>
tile, brick, and rock work<br/>
<br/>
working on learning:<br/>
<br/>
cabinetmaking<br/>
stained glass<br/>
architectural rendering<br/>
coppersmithing<br/>
archery<br/>
guitar<br/>
CAD<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid it seemed to me that my dad knew how to do <br/>
everything. He was kind of a jack-of-all-trades. Maybe that&#39;s where <br/>
I got the idea that I could do anything I wanted. I always seemed to <br/>
have that feeling, even when I was very young. I was forever coming <br/>
up with projects I wanted to do, and my parents would find a way to <br/>
get me what I needed.<br/>

seems it would affect a snake&#39;s ability to eat (catch prey, defend itsself, <br/>
etc.).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, he&#39;s called in when a dangerous reptile is in someone&#39;s home -  <br/>
like the police go in on a drug bust and find an alligator behind the <br/>
couch - that was one of his stories. Another one was where a boy <br/>
bought a cute little 15&quot; long snake and it was his favorite pet and <br/>
he slept with it, but eventually as it got bigger and bigger the <br/>
parents got worried. The Reptile man ended up with it and when he <br/>
pulled it out of its box it was about a 12-foot long constrictor. <br/>
Yeah, not what I&#39;d want my kid cuddling up with at night! It sounded <br/>
like all of the animals that he&#39;d received had been rescues of some <br/>
sort or animals that he&#39;d been called in to catch because of danger <br/>
to others.<br/>

<br/>
