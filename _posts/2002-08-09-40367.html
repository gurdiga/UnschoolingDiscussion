Suzanna bears me out....Imagine all the lies she has been told at her<br/>
child&#39;s school. Why do certain women on this list not want to talk about it?<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine a better reason to UNschool than to avoid dealing with an<br/>
institution that doesn&#39;t tell people the truth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been listening carefully for twenty years to what school employees tell<br/>
children and their parents, and I can safely say that I&#39;ve seldom heard a<br/>
word of truth from any of them. Yours is a typical example. They use fear to<br/>
keep parents and children in their programs and away from the truth.<br/>
<br/>
The public school system is a culture of dishonesty and deception.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m starting to hear from  moderator Joyce that this list is not intended<br/>
for the discussion of how disingenuous school employees can be, so it is<br/>
risky for me even to confirm for you that you have been purposely<br/>
misinformed by your child&#39;s school, but that is the case.<br/>
<br/>
At least a million homeschoolers can attest that people don&#39;t need a diploma<br/>
in order to go to college. I have two sons in that group.<br/>
<br/>
What goes on in schools in many places is that they have arrangements with<br/>
other agencies, with quotas to fill. They use the children in order to fill<br/>
those quotas whether the children are placed appropriately or not.<br/>
<br/>
Government does not work the way the markets work. In government, every<br/>
employee is working for a boss -- not for the interest of the customer,<br/>
because the government employee gets paid ONLY if s/he satisfies a boss.<br/>
But in the free market, people work to satisfy customers, because nobody<br/>
gets paid until the customer is happy and pays the company. School people<br/>
are ALWAYS trying to satisfy a boss. If what they do happens to satisfy the<br/>
customers -- children and their parents -- it&#39;s merely a coincidence<br/>
<br/>
My advice is to expect to be lied to in schools. It&#39;s not really the<br/>
employee&#39;s fault, it is the nature of the institution.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060446513">If you will read my post agaain, you will see that it wasn&#39;t my kid, <br/>
it was my neighbor&#39;s kid. My son has decided to quit homeschooling <br/>
and go to the same high school as the neighbor&#39;s kid. Many kids go <br/>
through public schools just fine. I have known many kids who <br/>
flourished in public school. Hopefully, my son will. My youngest son <br/>
has decided to stay at home, though. (YES!)He had considered <br/>
returning to p.s. but when it came time to register, decided to go <br/>
ahead and stay home. He semi-regrets that now, though, because since <br/>
we are new to this area he doesn&#39;t have very many friends yet. I told <br/>
him that once the homeschool groups start up their activities he will <br/>
be able to meet lots of new kids. We have been told that <br/>
homeschooling is really big here. The base we live on even has its <br/>
own group that has activities and P.E. The groups didn&#39;t do anything <br/>
during the summer, but should get started pretty soon.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with alot of what you are saying about p.s.&#39;s in general( we <br/>
have had our share of p.s. horror stories that I won&#39;t go into now), <br/>
but the moderator is correct: the porpose of this list is not to bash <br/>
public school, but to share ideas about unschooling.<br/>

Because the list is not focused on pointing out the inadequacies of the<br/>
school. It is about unschooling.<br/>
I happen to agree with you about many of your views BUT! I didn&#39;t come here<br/>
to discuss it. There are tons of lists on Yahoogroups alone that are focused<br/>
on this topic (political groups) If I wanted to discuss it I would go there.<br/>
<br/>
Could you give me some ideas about how to deepen my understanding of<br/>
unschooling EMily?<br/>

&gt; I am truly puzzled why you...never mind, however.....<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I respect you belief in christianity even though I do not agree or believe in <br/>
it.....but that&#39;s a personal choice... I know about christianity and grew up <br/>
that way and baptist too..... That is no longer my choice since I have grown <br/>
beyond that. I have also learned that you don&#39;t need all of the other things <br/>
to seek and speak to the creator. Going back to my native ancestry  beliefs <br/>
and studying yoruba, and native spirituality has helped me see alot of <br/>
things. Even having my latest child (baby #7 a planned unassisted birth) has <br/>
made me aware of alot of things. How so well we are connected to <br/>
everything........I know that she knew me before she even came to me... I <br/>
still wonder why she chose us to be her parents... Obviously she needs to <br/>
show us something or she needs to redo something, but she has taught us so <br/>
much.. She has changed us. We view things with so much depth now.<br/>
There&#39;s a song by India Arie called I see God in you....<br/>
That is so true....Yes, I may see her, but there are ALOT of times that I see <br/>
God in her.Those looks are not just her looks. Especially when I am down and <br/>
do something stupid without thinking. I can look at her and see inner peace <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
 WHen she was born, I looked at her and asked who&#39;s old soul are you. I had <br/>
recently sent a friend a picture of her since she just turned 1 and she <br/>
called me and said...She is an old soul...look at those eyes...the wisdom <br/>
that they hold.  I said , I know..we have been saying that since she was <br/>
born. We do indeed call her our spirit child. The depth of love that she has <br/>
engrossed in us is truly unbelieveable. She is a free spirit and is teaching <br/>
us more on how to be free spirits as well.<br/>
I also believe that people have to find their own paths and I respect that. I <br/>
just don&#39;t want their beliefs forced on me are be beaten over the head with <br/>
it. I feel whatever gets you to that place where you want or need to <br/>
be.....go for it! If you need to belong to an organized religion to be in or <br/>
help you to that place where you want to be.....go for it......<br/>
<br/>
The same with unschooling......whatever gets you there......whatever works <br/>
for you.....unschooling is indeed different for everyone....so is religion, <br/>
spirituality, or whatever floats your boat.....<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way I took it.<br/>
<br/>
And I know I read somewhere that there&#39;s a 3rd account that&#39;s different from<br/>
those 2 that&#39;s deeper into the Old Testament. I think I read it in Kenneth<br/>
Davis&#39;s Don&#39;t Know Much About the Bible. I was sure I owned that but I must<br/>
have borrowed it from the library.<br/>
<br/>
It was driving me crazy before I forgot about it. And now you go and bring<br/>
it back up again. ;-)<br/>
