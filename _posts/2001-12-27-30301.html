is so damn sure about all her ideas and beliefs she squashes others. Yet she <br/>
constantly feels she doesn&#39;t deserve what she has. Really it isn&#39;t much <br/>
either. She still works her ass off to keep her horses and barely makes ends <br/>
meet. She is a fantastic artist but makes her living hanging wallpaper and it <br/>
is physically taking its toll. She isn&#39;t confident in her artistic abilities <br/>
to make money. I know she could.<br/>
<br/>
   It seems so complicated, she is so adamant about issues and such that <br/>
she&#39;ll argue to the death. Yet your right she isn&#39;t confident in her own <br/>
ability. She is confident to say No to someone and I am not. So do you see <br/>
where the confusion is?<br/>
<br/>
   I am thinking a lot about this lately.<br/>

go to private school but I would have had to sell my pony. I chose my pony. <br/>
Then in HS I tried to quit but my Mom said no. I also tried in my Sr. year <br/>
but I would have had to be 18 to take my GED and that was the condition then. <br/>
I turned 18 the summer after grad..  Hmmmm wonder if she wonders if I would <br/>
have been better off outta there? I did end up going to college when I was 21 <br/>
and had a great GPA and transferred to a large *big college. But I quit w/ 14 <br/>
credits to go. I was burned out and I suddenly realized I wasn&#39;t as sure of <br/>
my end result as I wanted to be for spending that much money. She still gets <br/>
on me about going to that college and what a waste it was of money. I say it <br/>
wasn&#39;t b/c I learned a whole new way. College was great compared to High <br/>
School. Why no one ever told me that blows my mind. They are so ingrained in <br/>
the system that if your not following right along why think this child might <br/>
actually do better in a college setting. I told them over and over it was <br/>
like being in jail. The counselors gave up and I barely got out of <br/>
there.Stupid!<br/>
<br/>
    My mother had an art scholarship but got pregnant so she never went to <br/>
college. She never once encouraged college for me. Not that I think it is the <br/>
way to go but I was so pleasantly surprised at how different it was. <br/>

it.  (I had read Summerhill when I was 14, and that pretty well ruined <br/>
school for me.....the little that wasn&#39;t already ruined.)  After a couple <br/>
of years I went to college.  I also noticed a *huge* difference.  Students <br/>
were treated like adults, capable of making their own decisions about what <br/>
to wear and whether to skip a class.  Also, the students were mostly there <br/>
because they wanted to be, unlike high school.<br/>
