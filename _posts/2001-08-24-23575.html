<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798299537">To all unschoolers who have let their children learn to read when <br/>
they were ready; How did you approach the writing issue? My oldest, <br/>
Ben, took off with his reading at age 11 1/2 without benefit of any <br/>
reading lessons, or formal &quot;lessons&quot; of any kind. Now he is 13 and <br/>
his Dad and I are concerned about his aversion to writing of any <br/>
kind. He will print his name, that&#39;s it! My husband thinks it&#39;s time <br/>
to require regular writing, math, etc....I don&#39;t want to do anything <br/>
which will increase his aversion to writing.<br/>
<br/>
I have read lots in HEM and GWS about the late reader, always <br/>
including the encouragement &quot;They will read, when they are ready!&quot;. <br/>
But I have not seen similar stuff on this issue of writing. Yes, once <br/>
they are reading, supposedly, they will start writing, but I would <br/>
like to hear from unschoolers who have been through this! When we <br/>
faced the reading hurdle we had lots of evidence to back up our faith <br/>
that Ben would read if we provided the right environment and plenty <br/>
of space. Does the same hold true in this case?<br/>
<br/>
I would greatly appreciate hearing from any unschoolers, either <br/>
parents or those who personally went through this aversion to writing <br/>
themselves. I am hoping for encouragement to keep on this radical <br/>
unschooling path.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696036754">I have asked them to do things like make a list for me of things we need to remember to do or to write the grocery list for me. When they are looking something up online I will tell them how to spell it but I get them to write it down. It&#39;s not much writing but it is the closest I&#39;ve gone to making them write.<br/>

<br/>
Does he type? Meaning, does he go online and use e-mail, chatrooms, etc?  <br/>
That&#39;s how my kids learned to write.  Not with a pencil.<br/>
<br/>
I taught Jr. High English, kids 12-15.  They don&#39;t want to write even if <br/>
they&#39;ve had formal school up to that point.  Very few will write for fun, and <br/>
usually then it&#39;s notes to friends.<br/>
<br/>
I think your husband probably has unrealistic memories or wishful thinking <br/>
about what kids can/should write.<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day Richard Prystowsky and I gave a talk on writing.  You can <br/>
get a tape of it for $5 and postage from the company that made the tapes.  <br/>
The address and all is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expage.com/HSCFollowUp,">http://expage.com/HSCFollowUp,</a> and there&#39;s a tiny <br/>
bit more about it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://expage.com/sandrawriting">http://expage.com/sandrawriting</a><br/>
<br/>
Richard teaches college writing.  He did two other workshops on writing at <br/>
the same conference.  For $15 you might buy your son&#39;s freedom back!!  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;,But I have not seen similar stuff on this issue of writing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Richard wants me to write a book with him. He seems very serious.  The talk <br/>
went super well, and I think we said things a lot of those parents hadn&#39;t <br/>
heard.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll be waiting for the answers as well.  Caroline is almost 7 and <br/>
today we were reading and she picked up a workbook.  The page she <br/>
picked asked her to write some words.  She started, then made some <br/>
sort of squiggle for an &quot;s&quot;, then got mad that she couldn&#39;t make <br/>
an &quot;s&quot; (her writing is really, really bad but I don&#39;t comment on <br/>
it).  I asked her if she would like to practice some things that <br/>
would help her, which she did for a few minutes, then lost interest <br/>
and went off to find her brother to play.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my family is kind of iffy on homeschooling (and <br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t even compute with them) and I&#39;m getting flak <br/>
because her writing is atrocious.  (She sends them thank you notes, <br/>
etc).  I&#39;m not pushing her, either.  She is very intellingent and can <br/>
speak well, has a great vocabulary and use of language, so I&#39;m not <br/>
too concerned at this age yet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My kids have (Holly still does) drawn pictures for thank you notes, or we <br/>
send a photo of the kid with the thing, and a note from mom.  The boys have <br/>
typed and printed and then just signed thank-yous.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-527944660">I sat in on one of Richard&#39;s workshops and writing and the biggest thing I walked away with was that when the kids find something that speaks to them THAT is when they will write.  At this age most kids don&#39;t have experiences to write about and even feelings seem abstract to them.  So if you wait until there is something that really grabs him and it requires writing I think you&#39;ll be surprised at what he can do.  With my son, who doesn&#39;t like to write except for names of parts on diagrams of robots he creates on paper he has begun getting more interested in entering contests so he has improved his writing through sending away to enter these contests......just a thought.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know about a 13 yo, but here&#39;s what I did when my boys were <br/>
younger.<br/>
<br/>
I found them each an old briefcase and filled it with papers of all <br/>
kinds.  Different colors, shapes, sizes, everything EXCEPT the <br/>
standard lined binder paper.  I also included a selection of <br/>
envelopes, small notebooks, post cards, and sticky notes.  I added <br/>
fun pens, pencils, and markers.  A few sticker, too.  NO coloring <br/>
pages or crayons. <br/>
<br/>
We called these their &#39;writing cases&#39; and we never went anywhere <br/>
without them -- store, car rides, dr appt, Grandma&#39;s, etc.  I <br/>
encouraged notes, secret message writing to me and each other -- <br/>
anything that involved writing. Spelling and/or grammar didn&#39;t count <br/>
unless they asked. (I&#39;m a former English teacher and had to bite my <br/>
tongue many times to not stick my two cents worth in.)  :)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, copy stores were great with free note pads made from left <br/>
over paper.  We started these when the boys were six and two.  The <br/>
younger son (11 yo) still maintains one on his own.  Both boths enjoy <br/>
writing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931740530">If you are talking &quot;penmanship&quot;, sorry I can&#39;t help.  None of mine <br/>
enjoy handwriting.  <br/>
<br/>
In the long haul will they really need to write to have a full life?  <br/>
For my kids yes because it is a passion.  For others not necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest (14) was a &quot;late&quot; reader.  It has only been recently he <br/>
has taken to reading books, mostly non-fiction.  He and his sister <br/>
(16) enjoy writing on-line at www.fanfiction.net - they take <br/>
characters i.e.: Star Wars, Dragon Ballz and make up stories and post <br/>
them to others.  There was a young lady at the conference that <br/>
mention a poetry site that sounded cool, but I don&#39;t remember what it <br/>
was called.  My oldest daughter (20) facilitates a writing group for <br/>
younger HSers and writes mostly non-fiction but reads mostly <br/>
fiction.  My oldest son (22) reads mostly non fiction but writes <br/>
songs and poetry.   <br/>
<br/>
I have writers but I don&#39;t have mathematicians or scientists.  I&#39;m ok <br/>
with that, I have had panic times over the last 12 years but it all <br/>
seems to be turning out ok.  <br/>
<br/>
IMO Our job is to give them time and space to find their passion and <br/>
purpose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A lot of kids I know have started writing about two years after they were<br/>
reading fluently (i.e., reading short chapter books or the equivalent<br/>
independently). This was true for my daughter as well. I also know kids<br/>
who started writing before they read fluently at all, so obviously there<br/>
are many patterns, but the two-year gap seems common. I&#39;ve never pushed<br/>
writing (or anything) and my daughter just spontaneously started writing<br/>
poems, interviewing people for a book she planned to write, making &quot;To<br/>
Do&quot; lists (which I never do)... it was another Really Cool Thing to watch<br/>
unfolding.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632759519">&lt;&lt;his aversion to writing&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do not have an older child so I am hesitant to respond but something just<br/>
happened in our family that might be relevant.  My 8yo ds has an aversion to<br/>
reading.  No matter what the word might be, he will say he can&#39;t read it,<br/>
except maybe &quot;no&quot; or &quot;stop&quot;.  My 4yo is asking to learn to read so I labeled<br/>
everything in the house (suggested by a thread on this board, thanks!!).  I<br/>
asked 4yo Marsie is she wanted to play a treasure hunt and she did.  So I<br/>
made a duplicate set of cards and we would tape those up behind the first<br/>
set of labels in a manner so that when you found the match to the card in<br/>
your hand, you look behind it and the card taped there would tell you where<br/>
to go next.  Marsie played a couple of times but then wanted to go do<br/>
something else.  The 8yo Zach became enthralled with the game (he loves<br/>
prizes, even if the prize is one of his cars that he already owns but we<br/>
have hidden).  He knew almost all the words already, things like &quot;cabinet&quot;,<br/>
&quot;computer&quot;, &quot;bulletin board&quot;.  He didn&#39;t need to run around and match the<br/>
letters on the card to the ones on the labels.  He simply read them and took<br/>
off at a dead run.<br/>
<br/>
The point of this way too long post is that Zach could read, he often chose<br/>
not to read but he COULD read if push came to shove.  He learned how even if<br/>
I didn&#39;t see it, even if I didn&#39;t know it was happening.  My guess would be<br/>
writing would be similar.<br/>
