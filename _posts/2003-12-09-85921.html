<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899882929">In my dd&#39;s theatre troupe, there&#39;s a single male (non-parent) who <br/>
works well with all ages just as individual humans. He&#39;s their science nerd/ <br/>
technical wizard/set problem solver - never onstage. He sees the world through <br/>
curious and matter-of-fact eyes. <br/>
<br/>
       He posts to the theatre list about interesting things he gets involved <br/>
in. <br/>
       <br/>
       Today this showed up:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;so what is it that makes the difference between a 12 month old&#39;s gift and an <br/>
<br/>
18 month old&#39;s gift...seems to be ears and tails...like no projections longer <br/>
<br/>
then about an inch for the one year old while the 18 month old gets longer <br/>
ears and tails.  looked like a pretty boring life for the one year old...a <br/>
plush <br/>
sphere is the only toy available....here kid, have a Mars....collect all <br/>
8...no, you can&#39;t have Saturn &#39;til you are older. <br/>
But the beauty of it all is that the 12 month olds are only interested in how <br/>
<br/>
it tastes. Having a handle (or ear or tail) to carry it by comes later.&quot;</div>
