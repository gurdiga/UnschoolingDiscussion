<div id="ygrps-yiv-181746174">I will never cease to be amazed by the sheer quality of information presented on this list!<br/>
I checked out that website and it was a real learning experience. What will they think of next?<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I could use one though, it reminds me too much of a catheter - yuck!<br/>
Although, it might come in handy when travelling on the road and having to stop at those disgusting gas stations....But I&#39;m already quite capable at standing up when there is a need.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but that&#39;s different.  If you go through the website, you&#39;ll read <br/>
all about women who use mens rooms at sporting events, etc...and they&#39;re <br/>
not using any device, either.<br/>
<br/>
I actually got interested in this when a friend of mine said her <br/>
grandmother used to do it.  My friend believes that the cultural taboo <br/>
against women and their sexuality extends to a taboo about touching <br/>
themselves and that&#39;s why women have been conditioned not to do it. <br/>
 Because to do it without getting your clothing wet would require a lot <br/>
of touching!  <br/>
<br/>
I gave up on it as a matter of course, but will probably take advantage <br/>
of the idea the next time I&#39;m camping.<br/>

My friend who is now but was not then quadraplegic went camping with a woman <br/>
in the early 1970&#39;s who had (and demonstrated) the ability to &quot;thunder piss&quot; <br/>
as she called it, which meant she didn&#39;t have to squat in the snow with her <br/>
pants around her ankles, likewise in the snow.   Mary Ann my friend said she <br/>
was definitely going to try it.  But not long after she broke her neck <br/>
inner-tubing (on the snow) and hasn&#39;t even peed sitting down since, which is <br/>
a drag, because I never had the urge.  But anyway, it did involve pulling and <br/>
aiming certain parts which neither Mary Ann nor I had ever, ever considered <br/>
repositioning in any such way.  And there was a posture which I have seen <br/>
upon truck drivers who had stopped to stretch their legs and admire the <br/>
sunset.<br/>
<br/>
Eeeyew.  Yet...<br/>
No, eeyew.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On a historical costuming list I&#39;m on, someone mentioned seeing a lot<br/>
of undergarments from the 1800s - they all had big yellow stains in<br/>
the crotch area.  She figured that the women hadn&#39;t removed them in<br/>
order to pee - don&#39;t know if they stood or not.<br/>
