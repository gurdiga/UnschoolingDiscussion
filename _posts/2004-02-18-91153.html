They also did not make it an issue of homeschool methodology &quot;They don&#39;t do ANYTHING with their kids&quot; and make it to sound like neglect.  But they there was one line (I forget whose it was) about not being sure that homeschooling was best for these kids.<br/>

Given what the mother was doing to the kids though, I&#39;m not sure I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
I think they were stepping pretty close to the line, but overall, I think they kept the issue to the mother&#39;s paranoia, and not the fact that she homeschools.  It is true that some people homeschool to control their kids.  It is the vast minority, but it happens.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-42752518">I saw the show last night.  I listened carefully to what everyone was<br/>
saying.  One person made the remark that homeschooling is good when it is<br/>
worked properly.  I saw it from a little different slant.  For the most<br/>
part, the detectives were ignorant about homeschooling but listened to<br/>
others about the process of homeschooling.  I didn&#39;t get the impression they<br/>
were out to slam homeschoolers.  They also had advocates of homeschooling<br/>
defending the process which I thought was good.  I also thought there was a<br/>
really good lesson about being aware of what is around you.  Take the mother<br/>
for instance that realized when her daughter and the paranoids mother&#39;s son<br/>
were getting too close she pulled away along with the fact the mother didn&#39;t<br/>
know her daughter had received the e-mails from that boy.  What if the<br/>
mother was more in tune with her daughter would she have known about the<br/>
e-mail and been able to prevent the little boys death?  Something to think<br/>
about it.  I thought it was a balanced show.  The truth is I am sure there<br/>
are parents who probably do homeschool for some paranoid reasons.  But isn&#39;t<br/>
that true about life.  There are some scary people in this world!  My phrase<br/>
I use often is ...&quot;People, people,....they are everywhere!&quot;  It takes all<br/>
kinds to make the world go round.  I too however think often about proving<br/>
to the law that what I am doing is best for my girls by unschooling.  I am<br/>
very new to homeschooling as well as unschooling.  I just bathe it in prayer<br/>
and do the very best I can do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57961300">It can also be scary to deal with a paranoid parent when one is not <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There was a case in Hawaii in 1964 similar to the more recent case in <br/>
Texas, but in that case after the (paranoid schizophrenic) mom had <br/>
drowned the preschoolers, she went to the school, picked up the older <br/>
child, and drowned him too.<br/>
<br/>
Mental illness is often scary, but it is so regardless of educational <br/>
options.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645922390">I watched that, too, and was rather annoyed by the statement made by the<br/>
social worker (I believe) that &quot;school is a safety net&quot;.  Basically<br/>
saying, that people who Homeschool could be abusing their kids and no<br/>
one would know, whereas, if they were going to school, someone would see<br/>
the bruises.  There are many kids that die from abuse and go to public<br/>
school.  They slip through the cracks, no one wants to get involved.<br/>
Sometimes there is no abuse but a teacher may feel there is and a family<br/>
ends up being watched by the system for no reason.  Homeschooling has<br/>
nothing to do with it.   <br/>
 <br/>
The tone of the show bothered me because they made it sound like there<br/>
was this underground group of people that were daring to keep their<br/>
children out of the public schools and it was just coming to light now.<br/>
The show slanted toward needing more regulation on homeschoolers.  That<br/>
one mom did mention her reasons for homeschooling, but I did notice that<br/>
her daughter went to study her French and the mom said &quot;I&#39;ll drill you<br/>
on them later&quot;.  In other words, we do all the things they would do in<br/>
the public school so we are not abusing our children.  <br/>
 <br/>
Bottom line, there were no physical scars on the children.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
the school system would have reported anything or not.  They just would<br/>
have been teased for being paranoid and different (because of the<br/>
mindset the mother had pushed on them from small children).  Then the<br/>
school system would have cried and boohooed that they can&#39;t catch<br/>
everything.  I couldn&#39;t believe when the psychiatrist told the kid that<br/>
&quot;School shootings are relatively rare&quot;.  They shouldn&#39;t exist!  <br/>

&lt;&lt; According to writers, schools act as<br/>
<br/>
a safety net for all types of abuse, or mental/emotional problems in<br/>
<br/>
children that parents would be unable to detect.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s true in a lot of cases, though.  Any teacher who has ever seen a <br/>
kid who asked for help at school will understandably be wary of the danger of <br/>
homeschooled kids having no outside witnesses.   I&#39;m entirely serious.<br/>
<br/>
Because I had been one of those teachers and because I know that parents who <br/>
are abusing children will not see it clearly at all, we made a deal with two <br/>
adult friends, when our boys were little.  We told the boys if they ever were <br/>
really angry at us or afraid of us, or if they thought we weren&#39;t being good <br/>
parents, they should go to Paul or Jeff and tell them the whole story.  We told <br/>
Paul and Jeff, who were in their 20s at the time, and are still in our lives <br/>
now, that if the boys came to them to complain they should take the boys&#39; side <br/>
and listen to them and act if necessary, whether by talking to us or in <br/>
worst-case scenarios getting the kids out and away from us.<br/>
<br/>
It made me feel better.  It was a back-up plan that satisfied, for me, the <br/>
problem of the knowledge that some people DO abuse their kids and hide them.  <br/>
<br/>
I figured, too, it would be a comfort for other teacher-friends who expressed <br/>
that concern.   Nobody&#39;s ever asked.   <br/>
<br/>
Overall, though, it&#39;s not fair to scoff at those concerns.<br/>
Probably a lot of the church-based homeschoolers think their churches would <br/>
be the backup system, but in a couple of recent horror-shows, the families went <br/>
to church.  It didn&#39;t save them.  But we don&#39;t know how many families who do <br/>
go to church stay in line just to avoid the eyeball of the older women.<br/>
<br/>
Some families have no school backup, no church, don&#39;t take their kids to <br/>
doctors...<br/>

I don&#39;t know what you meant by this.  <br/>
<br/>
There are homeschoolers who use physical punishment related to &quot;schoolwork.&quot;<br/>
There are homeschoolers who have killed their children.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&quot;School shootings are relatively rare&quot;.  They shouldn&#39;t exist!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
Homeschool killings are relatively rare.  Should I just not mention them?<br/>
<br/>
If a father were ever to sexually molest his daughter (and I know it happens; <br/>
probably not as rarely as school shootings), wouldn&#39;t it be better for him if <br/>
she didn&#39;t have to go to school?  He runs a risk by her having other adults <br/>
who care about her, who might see changes in her mood or behavior.<br/>
