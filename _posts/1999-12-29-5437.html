<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607095826">Not so. The aforementioned book &quot;toilet training in less than a day&quot;<br/>
specifically teaches toilet independance.  Getting their own pants up and<br/>
down, emptying their own potty. If U help them to learn to pull their pants<br/>
down and up instead of just doing it yourself that can be done before an<br/>
attempt at pottying.<br/>
    You can tell when they are ready to train as they go longer between<br/>
urinating and are usually  dry in the morning. Of course,  this depends on<br/>
what they eat.  Lots of Juice (sugar) that some think is healthy? cows milk,<br/>
which makes them pee more.  My just turned a yr old is already dry some<br/>
mornings.  Yes she breastfeeds in the night. my 3 yr old dd has had dry<br/>
pants since 2 yr.   with 1 accident and 1 bed wetting.   How about a stool<br/>
at the sink so they can easily wash themselves.   I only took extra<br/>
underwear and pants with me for 2 weeks. Never did use them.  That method<br/>
teaches true independance.  No I don&#39;t ask them if they need to go potty or<br/>
remind them except to tell them we are going somewhere (so we all go potty<br/>
first)<br/>
   IMO, people make pottying harder than it needs to be.<br/>
 ok  done.<br/>

The thing I have seen with moms who train before 2 is that they then must<br/>
spend the next year asking the children every half hour if they need to go,<br/>
and leading them to the potty about six times a day, and of course they<br/>
spend quite a lot of time in the bathroom taking pants on and off, wiping<br/>
and helping wash hands. They have to have extra underwear and pants packed<br/>
wherever they go and deal with about one accident a day for quite a while.<br/>
Granted mine didn&#39;t learn til he was 3.5, but once he did it was all his own<br/>
affair: He went when he needed to without being reminded or led, took his<br/>
pants on and off himself, and knew to wash up afterward, and had maybe half<br/>
a dozen accidents total. And then, what about when the child is visiting<br/>
someone without you, or you are out somewhere where it&#39;s not convenient to<br/>
sit on the potty so often? I think someone did observe recently that mothers<br/>
of the past stayed home with their children a lot more of the time.<br/>
<br/>
My mom, who had us both out of diapers before we were 2, admitted that for<br/>
that first year, it was not the toddler but her who was trained. I guess<br/>
it&#39;s just a matter of how you want to go about it.<br/>
<br/>
As I said I don&#39;t think it hurts either way, but it does seem more tedious<br/>
for all concerned if you train before they are really ready to be<br/>
independent potty-goers.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Well, I&#39;m going to play devil&#39;s advocate here.  Can someone tell me exactly<br/>
&gt;what is wrong with early toilet training if it is done right?  By right, I<br/>
&gt;would guess the way that we did it back in the dark ages.  It wasn&#39;t a big<br/>
&gt;deal, you were in the bathroom for whatever reason and you plotted the<br/>
&gt;kidlet on the toilet and asked if they thought they might want to [insert<br/>
&gt;name of choice] in the big potty.  You folded towels and put them away, put<br/>
&gt;on your make-up, cleaned the sink, whatever.  If they did, cheering, if<br/>
&gt;they didn&#39;t, no big deal and a o.k., maybe next time.  No trauma, no force,<br/>
&gt;no big deal.  Of course, the boys were the easiest as they liked to watch<br/>
&gt;it splash, kind of a monkey see, monkey do thing with daddy or uncle or big<br/>
&gt;brother.  Again, no big deal.  As long as you caught them before the<br/>
&gt;terrible 2&#39;s it wasn&#39;t any big deal.  They love making the toilet flush and<br/>
&gt;watching the water swirl and gurgle, too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sure, some folks got carried away and it became a competition but you are<br/>
&gt;going to see that in any area of child rearing.  And, all in all, it is<br/>
&gt;healthier for the kids to be out of the diapers.<br/>
