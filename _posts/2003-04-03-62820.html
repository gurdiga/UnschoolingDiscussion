 </span></blockquote>If anyone has a chance to see &quot;The Doors - 21st Century&quot; concert touring<br/>
right now (and you are a Doors fan), definitely go and see it!<br/>
<br/>
We went last week and Ian Asbury of The Cult fills in for Jim Morrison. He<br/>
did an awesome job - very much sounds and looks like Jim (from footage I&#39;ve<br/>
seen, of course ;-). The keyboardist and guitarist are from the original<br/>
Doors.<br/>
Great concert - good show.<br/>

I have to admit to drooling after Val Kilmer  in a big way while watching the <br/>
movie that no one else liked. How does this tie into unschooling, there must <br/>
be a way. I am just happy to be chatting with people.I must get out more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you thinking of Real Genius?  If so, he wasn&#39;t he one living in the<br/>
secret chamber, but it was his dorm room the guy came through.  One of my<br/>
all time favorite movies.  It&#39;s the one with the girl, Jordan, who talks<br/>
really fast and never sleeps.  And LOTS of popcorn at the end.<br/>
<br/>
My seven year old just saw it.  I&#39;m quite proud to say he enjoyed it.  -evil<br/>

as Jim Morrison he was pretty alright.<br/>
