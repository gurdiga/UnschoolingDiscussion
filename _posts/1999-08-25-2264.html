<div id="ygrps-yiv-139029260">I found the following article in the US News and World Report to be<br/>
interesting.<br/>
On Society: JOHN LEO<br/>
on the new pursuit of trivia in academia.<br/>
&quot;The junk courses creep in because much of the professoriate now believes<br/>
that nothing can truly be known, so nothing truly matters. From this it<br/>
follows that juggling, horror movies, and serious courses all have equal<br/>
claims on students&#39; attention.&quot;<br/>
(my spell checker says that professoriate is an incorrect spelling - just an<br/>
aside)<br/>

When I started unschooling I pretty readily accepted that there was no<br/>
specific set of data that we should all have to know.  (I believe this was<br/>
recently discussed on this loop).  It is one of the reasons I believe<br/>
testing is a complete waste of time.  It is only more recently that I have<br/>
begun to question the value of a University education from the point of view<br/>
of becoming educated rather than as a requirement to enter the job market.<br/>
In this article the author states that colleges are &quot;unwilling to say what a<br/>
sound education might consist of.&quot;  I don&#39;t know how true that statement is<br/>
but it raises some interesting questions - at least in my mind.<br/>
