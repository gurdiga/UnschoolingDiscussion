&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t have a spouse, but I figure that if I had one and he wanted to<br/>
 buy something and I thought it was a bad idea for whatever reason, I<br/>
 wiouldn&#39;t just say no and expect him to give it up. I&#39;d try to figure out<br/>
 a way to yes, just like I&#39;d do with Rain... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I think that when children hear No, instead of a parent problem solving <br/>
how to get what they want, it stifles creativity.<br/>
I betcha Dar could tell us stories of how creative Rain is (I&#39;ve heard them <br/>
actually) and how much thought goes into purchases and items and so on.<br/>
Creativity abounds when parents display their own creative, open mindedness.<br/>
NO only leads to dead ends and teaches children not to think too much.<br/>
