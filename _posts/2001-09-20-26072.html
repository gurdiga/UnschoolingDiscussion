things I&#39;d suggest *generally* as unschooling ways to approach writing for<br/>
*any* teen. (Note the change of pronouns and nouns from the more specific<br/>
you to more general &quot;a child&quot; and &quot;she&quot; rather than &quot;your daughter&quot; and so<br/>

<br/>
It was probably confusing to return to &quot;you&quot; by putting the quotes at the<br/>
bottom. They were originally at the top where they belonged, but as the<br/>
writing evolved they interrupted the flow of ideas. They were more for<br/>
references sake by the end of the evolution of the writing, preferenced by<br/>
&quot;BTW&quot; since they were an aside.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my original post so no one has to go digging. Not that, at this<br/>
point, anyone else not involved really cares ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This very much misrepresents the exchange. Or the entire disucssion was a<br/>
misunderstanding about what people were saying was not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled the quotes from your original message that were being objected to.<br/>
They were about *academics*. You didn&#39;t explain (despite the fact that I<br/>
posted them twice and asked twice) how it could be child-led, uncoerced,<br/>
natural learning if you&#39;re determining that a specific amount must be done<br/>
in order for the learning to take place. I *understand* that you have this<br/>
on your chores chart. I *understand* you put it there for convenience sake.<br/>
<br/>
But for those trying to understand how kids can learn what *they* need to<br/>
know (as opposed to what others say they need to know) by pursuing what<br/>
interests them, it is confusing if someone says it&#39;s unschooling to insist<br/>
that something needs to be learned in a particular way.<br/>
<br/>
To me, an unschooling approach would be to give a child information she&#39;s<br/>
lacking in order to make an informed choice. For instance, let her know that<br/>
colleges *may* expect more writing than she&#39;s used to. (It really depends on<br/>
the college and the course of study she pursues.) She may or may not feel<br/>
that&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
If she does, there are many ways to approach it. She could take a community<br/>
college course. She could find a program and go through it on her own. She<br/>
could post to message boards. She could find pen pals. She could write in a<br/>
journal. She could write articles for the local paper. She could write to<br/>
some students at the colleges she&#39;s thinking of and *ask* how much writing<br/>
is involved. (Colleges generally have some students who volunteer to host<br/>
others.) Or other options. She could ask mom to remind her.<br/>
<br/>
If *she* insists writing 500 words each week is the best approach and *she*<br/>
insists she needs someone to *make* her do it each week and punish her if<br/>
she doesn&#39;t, then that&#39;s an area to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
It might be motherly (or following your heart or &quot;common sense&quot; or whatever<br/>
you&#39;d care to label it nor not label it) to insist it is a problem and she<br/>
needs to do something about it. And if someone wants to do that, then they<br/>
should do that. But it&#39;s unfair to others trying to understand unschooling<br/>
to call it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It would be unschooling to know that she&#39;s the best judge of who she is and<br/>
what *she* needs and to know that she needs to make the decisions that feel<br/>
right for her. If she later finds out the decision had consequences she<br/>
hadn&#39;t anticipated, then she&#39;s learned something else and can then reassess<br/>
the problem and seek a new solution.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to learn to write is by writing for real, personally meaningful<br/>
reasons. If the kids aren&#39;t writing without someone reminding them, then it<br/>
isn&#39;t real or personally meaningful to them. It may be a &quot;chore&quot; they choose<br/>
over cleaning the toilet, but it isn&#39;t child led learning anymore than<br/>
choosing an apple over dog food is child-led eating.<br/>
<br/>
The best way to write a lot is by having real deadlines for real reasons.<br/>
She&#39;ll be getting those (sort of) in college. (Only sort of because the<br/>
consequences are all made up. Unlike in the business world, neither the<br/>
world nor the college will be a better or worse place if a paper is or isn&#39;t<br/>
turned in. Colleges have to make up consequences -- grades -- so that there<br/>
are consequences to doing or not doing homework.) There will be a real<br/>
reason for doing the writing to a certain standard and she will have full<br/>
freedom to do it or not do it, knowing the consequences are not negotiable.<br/>
<br/>
To me, anyway, writing as a chore is even further removed from real actions<br/>
being tied to real consequences since the chore consequences don&#39;t depend<br/>
specifically on the writing. The purpose of writing should be to communicate<br/>
something to someone else for a real reason. (As I&#39;m doing here.) Not to<br/>
fulfill a word limit. The consequences of writing well or not writing well<br/>
are not gaining or losing car privileges (or whatever) but communicating or<br/>
not communicating. Writing in order to get 500 words onto the page won&#39;t<br/>
have the same result as writing because *the writer wants* to change<br/>
someone&#39;s mind about something, or tell them something they didn&#39;t know<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, here&#39;s the quotes:<br/>
<br/>
the word &quot;MY&quot; in &quot;as long as it meets my basic standards of HOW MUCH.&quot; (in<br/>
reference to writing each week.)<br/>
<br/>
the words &quot;have to&quot; in &quot;they have to write (physically)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And there was another quote a few days later that said your daughter<br/>
(paraphrasing since I&#39;ve emptied my deleted items folder) &quot;had to get used<br/>
to writing this much in college each week.&quot;<br/>
