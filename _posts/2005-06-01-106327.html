<div id="ygrps-yiv-1507348212">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Tessa was looking for the light pink spot made by leaving an otterpop on her pool floaty in the sun yesrterday. The frozen pop made the moisture inside the floaty condense where the pop was. Right now she is seeing if she can make the same thing happen inside the house. She needed to use a blue otter pop as that was the color that made the &quot;light pink&quot; yesterday. I thought she just wanted to have an otterpop for breakfast. Turns out the spot shows pink only in bright light. Now I have been given the otterpop to eat. It served it&#39;s purpose.<br/>
