&lt;&lt; I constantly have to go through some <br/>
process in my own head to get to a point where I know they are learning and <br/>
developing as they should. Boy this is hard after years of conditioning.<br/>

amazement...  one thing that helps is having a baby or toddler around who <br/>
no-one ever questions they are learning scads of things daily!!  it affirms <br/>
my knowing that the olders are doing the same, and then i can see it again...<br/>

passionate about,   but that he has found he needs to learn for <br/>
another subject that he is passionate about.  For instance,  he loves <br/>
physics and that sends him back to the math books.   He isn&#39;t <br/>
passionate about grammar,  but he knows that if he&#39;s going to take <br/>
the ACT or SAT,  he might have to do some review.  Still,  at 13,  he <br/>
reaches these conclusions on his own without requirements from me.<br/>
I think grammar and math drills can be accomplished in very little <br/>
time later when children see a need for them.  I would hate to <br/>
introduce them early and burn my kids out on them like ps does - or <br/>
have them forget what we learned and do it all again.  This, in and <br/>
of itself is what sent me to unschooling.  We started off as relaxed <br/>
unschoolers,  but I realized that my children didn&#39;t remember what <br/>
they were learning anymore than they did in ps.  Now,  as <br/>
unschoolers,  what is learned is remembered because it it used.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1751226483">I totally agree with the basic premise in your note.  Young children and<br/>
trees don&#39;t know they can learn less or do less.  A toddler goes for it all<br/>
the time.  The pathways build and build.  Every experience is a learning or<br/>
reinforcing experience.  And a tree, given the conditions of soil, water,<br/>
sunlight will grow as tall as it can.  It just doesn&#39;t know how to do<br/>
differently.  But a human is not a tree and a little boy or girl is not a<br/>
toddler anymore.  At some point we begin to think (consciously or<br/>
unconsciously) that we can do less,.that trying is hard and we can get by<br/>
without it.  At some point, though, what is required of us is to learn<br/>
things which we may not get from random activity or even passionate<br/>
interests.  That is another place where we moms and dads can step in.  If we<br/>
prepare ourselves and have some imagination, we can help our children learn<br/>
the thins they need to know mostly from daily life and the pursuit of their<br/>
interests.  It is up to us to show them the learning that would otherwise<br/>
pass them by so they can use it now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it is more that at some point we, as parents, teachers whatever, start<br/>
to judge what is being learnt. Whereas when the child was a toddler we admired<br/>
everything they did and learnt, now we start to judge, to expect particular<br/>
learning, to say you don&#39;t need this, you do need that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one person can possibly ever learn more than a speck of even the current<br/>
knowledge available. So we we judge for our children. Even the most laid back<br/>
totally non-invasive unschooler judges to a degree, just by then things s/he<br/>
makes available for her/his child to be exposed to.<br/>
<br/>
But when you say &lt;At some point we begin to think (consciously or<br/>
unconsciously) that we can do less,.that trying is hard and we can get by<br/>
without it.  &gt; I disagree. I think this only applies to learning that is imposed<br/>
by someone else&#39;s agenda. When I really want to learn something, I get out there<br/>
and do it no matter how hard it is.<br/>
