<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833193932">In the very first paragraph, I found myself disagreeing with the authors<br/>
very basic premise for writing this article.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Education, more than any other factor, is responsible for America&#39;s<br/>
success.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people may see that as the case, but that doesn&#39;t match reality. <br/>
America&#39;s success has more to do with the freedom that allowed anyone to<br/>
succeed if they worked hard and were lucky.  The introduction of<br/>
formalized education has had more of a flatlining effect.  Initially,<br/>
helping a mass populace to be able to read was a good thing, and that<br/>
probably did help.<br/>
<br/>
So, everything else after that part of the article was an example of how<br/>
education doesn&#39;t really create success.  And the author is right about<br/>
losing graduates by not engaging them in the multi-dimensional aspect of<br/>
the high tech world and continuing with the boring one dimensional spoon<br/>
feeding of information to a populace that should be out DOing.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m really struck by the notion that our culture is really<br/>
missing out by locking away teens from the world and keeping them stuck<br/>
and in waiting mode.  What an incredible waste of energy!  Especially as<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten older and my energy is less and I get sore and tired from<br/>
trying to keep up.  I can think back to my teenhood and young adulthood<br/>
and remember how much energy I had and how powerful I felt, and how<br/>
powerless I felt as a teen when I couldn&#39;t use that power!<br/>
<br/>
Chamille went to a local grocery store last night when I was out with<br/>
Margaux.  She wanted a frozen pizza, so walked to the store to get one. <br/>
She said that she really dislikes this particular store because every<br/>
time she goes there, the cashiers are bad mouthing their teens.  So,<br/>
perhaps their teens aren&#39;t behaving or what have you, and it&#39;s no wonder<br/>
why!  Teen bashing is sooo pervasive in our culture!  People are really<br/>
missing out!  I love my teen and teens in general, so creative and full<br/>
of life and energy, it&#39;s beautiful!</div>

<br/>
But it keeps them from taking the jobs away from parents of  <br/>
children.  I think that&#39;s part of the deal, left over from the  <br/>
Depression and the return from WWII and that.  If there are only so  <br/>
many jobs, they should go to men first, then single mothers, and then  <br/>
*maybe* to teenagers.  I think that was part of the thinking right  <br/>
after WWII, in the U.S., anyway.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No kidding.  And they try to tell teens that school is their job, and  <br/>
there&#39;s nothing more important than &quot;a good education,&quot; which ends up  <br/>
generally amounting to a piece of paper saying you endured emotional  <br/>
abuse and crazy arbitrary hoop-jumping for 12 or 13 years, and then  <br/>
maybe &quot;if you&#39;re lucky&quot; another one after another four (or six or  <br/>
eight...) years too!!!  Whoopty-do!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did learn a lot in college, and I&#39;m glad I went, and Marty&#39;s  <br/>
starting to talk about maybe going to college, but the difference is  <br/>
I really WANTED to be there.  I was surrounded by people who had no  <br/>
more choice than they&#39;d had the first day of first grade.  My  <br/>
roommate&#39;s mother came with her from four states away and put her  <br/>
clothes in her closet and filled out her schedule for her.  Not with  <br/>
her.  For her.  Maybe I&#39;m jealous and wish my parents had done some  <br/>
cool stuff for me (my dad paid my room and board, and I took loans  <br/>
for tuition and books).  But anyway...  If Marty goes it will be even  <br/>
MORE different.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s boyfriend was in grad school and dropped out, and his parents  <br/>
are treating him like a criminal, like a huge shameful failure.    <br/>
School has grown into a huge façade of real world, where some people  <br/>
can&#39;t even SEE &quot;real world&quot; because school blots out the landscape.<br/>
