 </span></blockquote>Hi, Ren and everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
I beg your pardon for this *long* soapbox rant.  I just can&#39;t let this go <br/>
by without a response.  It absolutely does not pertain to unschooling, and <br/>
for this I humbly apologize.  But I feel passionate enough about this to <br/>
respond.  The animals have no voice, and they are suffering greatly for <br/>
profit (greed) and human gratification.  Please delete this if you&#39;re not <br/>
interested in this topic.  Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
While it is certainly true that harsh realities can be experienced by <br/>
animals living in their natural environment (and this is true for humans, <br/>
as well), animals FORCED by humans to perform in circuses are deprived of <br/>
their precious freedom, their natural behaviors (like walking great <br/>
distances and nurturing their young), their natural social settings and <br/>
families, and are forced to travel in cramped cages and boxcars up to 48 <br/>
weeks per year.  One may argue that the animals can live longer in <br/>
captivity than they do in their natural setting, but what kind of life?  A <br/>
life of being shackled?  A life of physical and psychological stress, fear <br/>
and confusion?  Many elephants that are forced to perform silly, unnatural <br/>
and dangerous tricks suffer from painful arthritis and other chronic <br/>
injuries; yet, circuses are reluctant at best to retire them.  All this for <br/>
greed and human gratification.<br/>
<br/>
One may also argue that seeing the animals is an educational <br/>
experience.  But, &quot;Animals used in circuses, and other displays, do not <br/>
serve as accurate educational tools for children. These displays do not <br/>
educate the public on the natural habitat, life-style, or behavior, but <br/>
rather provide an erroneous perception of the animals. The circus may <br/>
portray the animals as approachable and playful, however these wild animals <br/>
are often dangerous, unpredictable and uncontrollable. Thus, children may <br/>
draw near or attempt to pet the animals under the often mistaken belief <br/>
that it is safe.&quot;  (Quoted from  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm">http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Make no mistake about it, circus trainers must use cruel beatings and fear <br/>
in order to get wild animals to perform unnatural, dangerous acts like <br/>
jumping through hoop of fire.  These kinds of training techniques have been <br/>
documented on undercover video tapes which I have seen.  I have seen and <br/>
heard one famous circus&#39;s head elephant trainer admonish that the hidden <br/>
beatings must be severe because the elephants cannot be hit &quot;in front of a <br/>
thousand people.&quot;  They use sharp bullhooks called an ankus, a wooden stick <br/>
with a sharp pointed hook at the end.  Trainers are instructed to &quot;sink&quot; <br/>
the hook, making elephants scream in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Even the minimum standards of the already weak and hard-to-enforce federal <br/>
Animal Welfare Act are not met, resulting in slaps on the wrist and <br/>
payments of fines to &quot;settle&quot; charges.  But the real cost is the <br/>
imprisonment, suffering, and injury of innocent animals whose only crime is <br/>
that they are animals.<br/>
<br/>
As I said earlier, while nature can certainly deal out harsh situations, <br/>
these are usually events, except in the case of severe prolonged <br/>
drought.  Animal performers in circus acts are subjected to systematic, <br/>
chronic conditions that include pain, cramped living quarters, and <br/>
sometimes in poorer, smaller circuses, inadequate access to food and <br/>
water.  The animals cannot walk away from these situations, either.  And, <br/>
these incredibly social animals do not have the loving support of their <br/>
family groups, as they do in the wild.  Young animals are snatched from <br/>
their mothers prematurely.<br/>
<br/>
Many localities have outright banned animal acts.  Rebellious wild animals <br/>
have caused injury and death to audience members and people in the <br/>
community.  &quot;Since 1990 these incidents have resulted in 43 human deaths, <br/>
more than 140 human injuries, and the killing of 69 big cats. These wild <br/>
animals are responding to the harsh conditions and stressful environment of <br/>
the circus. Elephants in circuses are rebelling in attempts to escape their <br/>
sad existences.  In 1994, officer Blayne Doyle, who had to shoot 47 rounds <br/>
into...an elephant who charged out of the Great American Circus arena, <br/>
lamented: &#39;I think these elephants are trying to tell us that zoos and <br/>
circuses are not what God created them for. But we have not been <br/>
listening.&#39;&quot;  (Quoted from  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm">http://www.animallaw.com/circus.cfm</a> )<br/>
<br/>
While the animals cannot talk to us, there is plenty of research to support <br/>
their intelligence and sentience.  Animals care about their own lives and <br/>
the lives of their young, as we do, and they can suffer.  Humans have a <br/>
knowledge of when they are inflicting suffering.  Suffering is <br/>
suffering.  What the animals are forced to endure is nothing short of slavery.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an additional link to an article about the unnatural plight of <br/>
performing circus animals.  What you&#39;ll read is disturbing, so please <br/>
proceed with caution.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.satyamag.com/sept00/stagno.html">http://www.satyamag.com/sept00/stagno.html</a><br/>
<br/>
 From what I have learned about circuses, if I were an animal, I&#39;d take my <br/>
chances with the harshness of Mother Nature any day!  At least, I would <br/>
like the option!<br/>
<br/>
End of long soapbox rant!  Once again, my sincere apologies to everyone on <br/>
the list for straying off topic.<br/>
<br/>

Best,<br/>

<br/>
Just for clarification, one person did wonder if people who were concerned <br/>
about animal rights kept pets in their homes, and I have heard that there <br/>
are some folks who feel that keeping pets is unethical, but I am definitely <br/>
not one of those folks!  :-)<br/>

Elissa responds: I can see that! I think that with that question, some may<br/>
have assumed that there was an argument there against pets but I didn&#39;t see<br/>
that. It seemed as though some were responding as if there was.<br/>
&lt;&lt;Arguing against confinement and forced caged feeding is impractical<br/>
in the city.<br/>
Should I be considered up on cruelty charges then?  Asking facetously.<br/>
Ha, Ha.<br/>
Seriously, I wish we continued to live in the country but we don&#39;t.<br/>
So for their safety and our legal stability, they have to consider<br/>
our home their cage.  They are our responsibility.  We chose to bring<br/>
them home.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;They aren&#39;t always worse off with humans&gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;You just said what my husband said today when I<br/>

us out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
I have seen in the past that things can get confusing on email lists and<br/>
people may wind up debating two completely different ideas without realizing<br/>
it. It seemed to be happening again with some arguing<br/>
&quot;Circuses are horrible places and abusive to wild animals&quot; with the opposing<br/>
response being &quot;But House pets are better off as house pets&quot;<br/>
To me those could be in the same sentance.<br/>
BTW, After the last small circus came to town, my husband and I left there<br/>
feeling really sad and decided that we were not doing animal circuses<br/>
anymore. I hate to see depressed looking animals, and ALL looked terribly<br/>
sad.<br/>
I also keep pets, eat meat, support humane testing for life saving measures<br/>
(meaning not for makeup). I try to be informed and balance all animals needs<br/>
as best I can, human animals included.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Elissa and everyone!<br/>
<br/>
This message won&#39;t be so long this time ;-)  Again, my humble apologies to <br/>
the list for continuing this off-topic discussion here.  I do not think <br/>
this subject is enlightening about unschooling, but I am compelled as an <br/>
activist to address these things when they come up.  Please do delete this <br/>
message if you are not interested in this topic.  So as not to continue <br/>
taking up the list&#39;s attention and time, I would like to invite anyone <br/>
interested in further debating or discussing this topic to contact me off <br/>
list.  Thanks very much for indulging me so far!  Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
After the reading and research I have done, I am opposed to animal <br/>
experimentation on both scientific and ethical grounds. Scientifically, <br/>
vivisection is a flawed methodology, as non-human animals are biologically <br/>
and physiologically different from humans. Research on non-human animals <br/>
all too often produces results that do not correlate to humans.  For <br/>
example, &quot; [T]he drugs Oraflex, Selacryn, Zomax, Suprol, and Meritol <br/>
produced such adverse side effects in humans (including death) that they <br/>
were removed from the market, though animal experiments had predicted all <br/>
of them to be safe.  In fact, the General Accounting Office (the <br/>
investigative arm of Congress) did a post-market study of drugs marketed <br/>
between 1976 - 1985 and found that 52% were found to be more dangerous than <br/>
pre-market animal studies had indicated, with adverse side effects <br/>
including permanent disability and death. Recently, the hepatitis drug <br/>
Fialuradine and the diet drug combination Phen-Phen cause serious injuries <br/>
and deaths in humans because animal tests failed to show the potential for <br/>
danger. And for the past thirty years since the announcement of the war on <br/>
cancer, our reliance on animal models has led to no advance in the life <br/>
expectancy of cancer patients in all but 2% of cases. In the last decade, <br/>
the National Cancer Institute abandoned their animal-based drug screening <br/>
program and replaced it with non-animal alternatives because the animal <br/>
methods had been such a failure.&quot; (quoted from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm">http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Ethically, I oppose vivisection based on the theory that animals have the <br/>
right to live free of human-imposed suffering. &quot;People who base their <br/>
argument against animal experiments on moral grounds are generally referred <br/>
to as animal rights activists. Many people are confused by the term and <br/>
think that these people want equal rights for animals and humans. This is <br/>
not the case. Obviously, animals have different attributes and capabilities <br/>
than humans, but every sentient (having the ability to suffer) creature has <br/>
inherent value and the right to a life free of being subjected to <br/>
suffering. So, while animal rights activists feel that animals should not <br/>
be subjected to painful experiments they do not feel that they should have <br/>
the right to vote or be able to drive a car.&quot;  (also quoted from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm">http://www.aavs.org/Docs/basic2.htm</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that&#39;s all!  Again, my apologies to all for this diversion.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
<br/>

I think the same arguments about the animals not having the choice of living <br/>

Are pets not enslaved animals?<br/>
