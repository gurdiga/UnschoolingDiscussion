<h4>Nicky Hardenbergh  by way of Home Educat</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161677879">Please share this on any lists that you&#39;re on... or with homeschoolers that<br/>
might be willing to shop Amazon through NHEN.<br/>
<br/>
Support the National Home Education Network when you shop this holiday season!<br/>
Holiday shopping is already in full swing! NHEN, in partnership with<br/>
Amazon.com, would like to make it all just a little easier for you.<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re looking for that great new cd for your father-in law. Or, how<br/>
about the Harry Potter LEGOs for a favorite niece or nephew? Or an electric<br/>
teakettle for your tea-loving sister? Or, maybe even a great new<br/>
homeschooling book for you to curl up with after the rush of the holidays?<br/>
Did you know that Amazon.com sells all these things, and more? Housewares,<br/>
toys, electronics, music, toiletries, and, of course, books and more books!<br/>
Many orders over $25 qualify for free shipping. Sitting at your computer,<br/>
you can purchase, then have sent, gifts for your immediate family, or for<br/>
family members across the country. You can even include a personalized gift<br/>
card and have your gift specially wrapped. What could be simpler or more<br/>
cost effective?<br/>
When you shop at Amazon.com, via NHEN&#39;s home page, you can get a great deal<br/>
and help support NHEN at the same time. Just go to NHEN&#39;s website<br/>
(www.nhen.org), click on the Amazon link on our home page, and &quot;shop till<br/>
you drop.&quot;<br/>
Or, go directly by accessing our Amazon shopping page at:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nhen.org/cgi-bin/amazonxml/amazon_products.pl">http://www.nhen.org/cgi-bin/amazonxml/amazon_products.pl</a><br/>
With each purchase NHEN will receive a percentage of the sale. This adds up<br/>
to a significant contribution that will support the important work NHEN<br/>
does for homeschoolers around the world!<br/>
But wait! Now that you understand what a great idea this is for NHEN<br/>
members, think of the even greater impact you could make if you forwarded<br/>
this e-mail to all your Amazon-loving friends and family so they could<br/>
support NHEN too. Just forward, or copy and paste, this message, and send<br/>
it on its way.<br/>
Remember, though, it only counts for NHEN if you shop through our Amazon<br/>
connection!<br/>
Happy shopping!<br/>
