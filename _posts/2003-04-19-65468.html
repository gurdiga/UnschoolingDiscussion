Well...<br/>
The world itself?<br/>
<br/>
If he has ANY magazine, he will read it and connect it in his mind to other <br/>
things he knows, or an article will make him remember something he has in his <br/>
closet, but he might have to call a friend to ask something.  <br/>
<br/>
I think trying to narrow it to a show or magazine or product is, again, <br/>
trying to focus an all-directions flow.<br/>
<br/>
With learning styles and thinking styles in mind, what I&#39;ve always tried to <br/>
do is rather than try to analyze any one child, I just provide and keep <br/>
swirling through lots of means of input and experience for them--sound, <br/>
sight, smell, texture, taste.<br/>
<br/>
Their knowledge gathering is all internal anyway.  What they need is access <br/>
to stuff and ideas and input.<br/>

I wonder what a child with these traits would be like as a teen if <br/>
they were always allowed to learn and do at their own pace. If they <br/>
were never exposed to the concept of there being one right way to pay <br/>
attention or gather information. Maybe their brains would grow and <br/>
adapt to itself so that they wouldn&#39;t feel frustrated with their <br/>
inability to pay attention. They would have just learned a completely <br/>
different (from the norm) way of getting and retaining the info they <br/>
needed.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve seen some of this in my own kids. Just throwing an idea <br/>
out there for discussion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an interesting idea!  <br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that just as there are various &quot;learning styles&quot;, there are also various &quot;thinking styles&quot; that lay on a continuum from &quot;left-brained&quot;/convergent/part-to-whole thinking to &quot;right-brained&quot;/divergent/whole-to-part thinking. And although children/adults are able to move along the spectrum depending on the &quot;task&quot;, there are some for which one style of thinking is clearly dominant, just as although children can use various learning styles depending on the environment, they are likely to have one or two dominant, or preferable, learning styles.<br/>
<br/>
Most schools and school-at-home curriculums certainly prize left-brained/sequential thinking and try hard to &quot;train&quot; all kids to think in that style; in fact, they are penalized if they don&#39;t. Think &quot;show your work&quot;, &quot;don&#39;t ask that now, I&#39;ll get to it later&quot; etc. Even when they try to adapt to different learning styles, say visual or kinesthetic, they still present the material in a sequential fashion which a whole-to-part thinker often finds very frustrating. They want the big picture, then time to contemplate the different parts and the patterns that arise.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I prize most about unschooling is that the divergent thinker is not penalized, not made to feel unsuccessful or frustrated just because they don&#39;t think the way the &quot;teacher&quot; wants them to.  He/she can take the time to understand how they best learn and think, and then have the time to naturally gravitate to jobs/careers that support and prize these styles, not spend their time being frustrated as they try to fit into the convergent thinking world of school and &quot;typical jobs&quot;.  There are lots of jobs out there where skills such as being able to &quot;think outside the box&quot;, &quot;see the big picture&quot;, &quot;jump quickly between tasks&quot;, &quot;process lots of different input quickly&quot; etc. are prized, and being able to spend the day at your desk replying to email and filling out paperwork (at whatever corporate level) are not necessary requirements.<br/>
<br/>
So having said that, does anyone have any great ideas for supporting a divergent thinker? I find that even homeschooling field trips and workshops are very convergent/sequential in nature and as such we do not enjoy them, especially my son Joseph (11). We&#39;ll hit the places on our own so the kids can go at their own pace and style. And stuff we have at home he uses in his own style, forget the step-by-step instructions, just see the end product and get there. Maybe there are some shows, magazines, or products/activities out there that are a natural fit for a divergent thinker?<br/>
