They have a homework section in our library and one day Virginia went to a computer, printed out some worksheets from a website and did her homework - weird.<br/>

Today we were at the library and my daughter (11) got a book on Medievil<br/>
Castles and asked for a piece of paper.  She started copying word for<br/>
word out of the book.  When I couldn&#39;t contain myself any longer, I<br/>
asked (with an effort to be casual), why are you doing that?  With a<br/>
laugh, she said, I don&#39;t know and kept doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really curious why a person would want to do that.  Any ideas?  It&#39;s<br/>
out of character and as far as I know she isn&#39;t even particularly<br/>
interested in castles.<br/>

Handwriting practice.  Just for fun, to see how fast she can do it?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very medieval thing to do, transcribing books by hand.  They had no <br/>
choice.  Maybe she saw a picture of a scribe doing just that and wanted to <br/>
check it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859077151">I copied THE MADMAN  by Kahil Gibran a about that age.<br/>
Used a nice pencil and college ruled notebook paper. <br/>
It felt good.  I like the way the words flowed through<br/>
me onto the paper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341139262">Hey, I saw a very pretty picture book about a medieval girl, who&#39;s<br/>
father was a scribe with failing eyesight, who illuminates a book.  I<br/>
think it was called (something like) Marguerite Makes a Book.  Has<br/>
anyone else seen this, who remembers the title more accurately?<br/>
<br/>
The text was a little bland, but the pictures were lovely.<br/>

I think it had her running around the town to the various crafts people<br/>
getting all the things she&#39;d need to finish the book her father started<br/>
including the quills and the substances to make the various inks and so<br/>
forth.<br/>
