<div id="ygrps-yiv-196157318">Someone on my local list found this. Pam Larrichia has a great article in <br/>
the archived volume 1. Other than her piece, much of it seems to be school <br/>
reform - but check out the submissions information; IMHO they need to hear <br/>
from more real unschoolers to balance the schooly perspectives.<br/>
