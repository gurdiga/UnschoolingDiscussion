&gt; Sunflowers are neat.  When mature, you can eat the seeds or leave  them on the flower for the birds.  They are useful plants too, as  every part is harvested for use.  <br/>

I&#39;ve had sunflowers in the past and had a real problem with squirrels  attacking them. Any advice on how to keep them away so we can enjoy  the sunflowers? <br/>
