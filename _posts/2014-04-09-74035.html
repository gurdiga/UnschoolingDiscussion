<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109091970">Hi, my question relates to a recent post.<br/>
My son (7) has recently discovered Stampy Longnose Minecraft videos which he is enjoying immensely and watches for long stretches nearly every day. He plays a little Minecraft too but only enjoys to play with either myself or preferably a friend.<br/>
I can see that he is getting a lot out of watching these videos and it delights me to hear him giggling away, I would just love some feedback as to what he might be learning, I cannot seem to articulate in my own mind what that might be. Maybe I don&#39;t need to know but would love to hear some ideas anyway.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

How about it makes him happy and giggly ? Would that be enough?</span></blockquote></span></blockquote></div><br><div>Since entertainment and education are seen as opposite ends of a spectrum in this society, it&#39;s doubtful for most people!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>But this is another area where living an unschooling life shifts the view point. It&#39;s not that unschoolers ignore the difference between entertainment and education. It&#39;s that we come to see that it&#39;s a false division.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For educators, entertainment is a sugar coating that can be put on the important stuff to make it easier to get it in.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For unschoolers, that division doesn&#39;t make sense. For unschoolers the division is interested in and not (yet) interested in.</div><div><br></div><div>Engagement, joy, interest, fascination are all indications a child is making connections between ideas. Unschoolers come to realize that the connections are &nbsp;not just the important part of learning but the only real learning. But that realization isn&#39;t easy to come by. Kids don&#39;t give us much feedback! It comes from reading about how and why learning happens, trusting that it really is there, then learning to see the learning in its wild state when kids give us those rare glimpses. (Though the glimpses get more frequent the better we get at seeing what real learning looks like.)</div><div><br></div><div>Education looks like 1+1=2 and the child showing through various ways that they can parrot that back in the right contexts. *Sometimes* that parroting back means they understand. But it can very often mean they&#39;ve memorized someone else&#39;s understanding well enough to pass the tests.</div><div><br></div><div>Learning, on the other hand is aha moments which occasionally are big but are usually lots and lots of teeny tiny aha moments. It&#39;s making connections and growing an understanding that when you have one thing and another thing comes along that you have more. And how that relates to *any* increases. And *any* decreases. It&#39;s &quot;Oh, ducks are like geese,&quot; and &quot;5 pointed stars are like stars in the sky but also not.&quot; And on and on.</div><div><br></div><div>Kids are gathering data, making connections between ideas, seeing patterns. They&#39;re creating theories to explain their growing understanding. They test those theories on more real world stuff. The theories either work better or work worse than their previous theory. Either way they understand the world a bit better.</div><div><br></div><div>Since the process is so random, it isn&#39;t testable. And most of it is invisible.</div><div><br></div><div>So what unschoolers do is know it&#39;s there. And they feed their kids&#39; &nbsp;interests. And they create a rich life where kids can be exposed to new ideas that will offer a bit more and perhaps new interests.</div><div><br></div><div>Sometimes you will understand what your kids *could* be learning from something. Always they&#39;ll be learning much more, making connections with ideas that seems to have no relation to what they&#39;re doing, learning thousands of little bits about peripheral things like music, social interactions, history, math, who they are, who you are and so much much more.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A lot of learning about unschooling is unlearning a lot of stuff that you&#39;re sure is true about learning ;-)</div><div><br></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304442291">All of those above plus a few more - better understanding of dates, months and the calendar in general (relating to when Stampy, Squid, AmyLee, etc&#39;s birthdays are). &nbsp;We are in Australia so my 9yo DD has been exploring England, Scotland and Ireland where they are all from. &nbsp;She has watched them over and over for the past few months and we have all laughed out loud at the joy and fun Stampy brings. &nbsp;Ordering online as she bought some figurines of their skins - money, postage, time to be delivered internationally, discussion on building a business with complimentary products to create other streams of income. The food chain with hunting/gathering food. &nbsp;Physics with the building of a rollercoaster. &nbsp;New vocabulary and different ways to pronounce words from different parts of the English speaking world (she pronounces inventory &#39;infantry&#39; as that is how Stampy says it - discussion about the way the army is organised). These are just some of the discussions we&#39;ve had recently. &nbsp;We usually go for an hour walk a day to get our mail and discuss Stampy the entire way and she never runs out of conversation. &nbsp;It has increased her vocabulary immensely. &nbsp;A big part of her learning is my connection with what she&#39;s interested in. She can ask what new words/concepts mean straight away and slot them into the knowledge she has already. &nbsp;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399459276">My daughter, also 9, loves watching minecraft youtube videos too! As well as the things mentioned above (which I second wholeheartedly) she has amassed a huge body of knowledge about how to play the game - the recipes for crafting items, which tool is right for which job, how to tame animals, how to interact with villagers, change skins, build incredible structures, the list goes on and on! At first she watched a lot more than she played, now it&#39;s roughly 50-50. I think one of the ways humans naturally learn is by watching another person, and then having a go ourselves. So because she already knew a lot about the game, she became proficient at playing it very quickly. There weren&#39;t many frustrating moments when she didn&#39;t know what to do. All of us have learned a huge amount from these videos. Our latest discovery is the Studio Ghibli mod - I highly recommend it!<br><br>Claire<br>Melbourne, Australia</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1117389009">My kids (aged 9, 7 and 4) watch Stampy Longnose videos regularly, he is definitely their favourite, and a good friend of theirs (age 7) watches him for at least 3 hours a day. He is funny and friendly and I find it enjoyable just listening to him chatter, even if I&#39;m not watching the video with them. They have all learnt SO much about how to play Minecraft, as well as a lot of new vocabulary. He talks constantly about his process and he tries new things, some of which work and some don&#39;t, then he tries again a different way, chatting all the time about what might have gone wrong or what he could do differently, so they are learning about taking risks, trying new things, dealing with frustration and disappointment in a positive way, perseverance and so on. When I asked LiAM why he loves watching Stampy he said &#39;I just want to learn how to be as good at Minecraft as he is&#39; - while Caitlin likes seeing that he&#39;s not perfect at all parts of it (apparently he&#39;s not so good at parkour) so that makes her feel better when she isn&#39;t good at all aspects of the game. LiAM has also discovered new games by looking for Stampy&#39;s videos, so is now exploring those games and learning a whole range of new skills from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817278971">My seven year old loves BajanCanadian, Stampy and others. He gets to see what different and unique and difficult Mods would be like to play, and when we install them he &quot;gets&quot; it and feels freer to create in the mod. Just a thing he likes and gets from YouTubers.<div><br></div><div>Holly</div></div>
