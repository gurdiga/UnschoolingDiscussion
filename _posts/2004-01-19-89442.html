 </span></blockquote>No - it is far more than not being school-biased. It means, for <br/>
example, not judging the value of what we spend our time doing based on <br/>
whether the kids are learning or not. It means losing any consciousness <br/>
that everything they do is &quot;learning&quot; - and, instead, just &quot;being.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If asked, I can easily describe the learning in what my kids are doing. <br/>
But, the point is that I don&#39;t think about it anymore UNLESS I&#39;m asked <br/>
to do so. I write about it when writing for homeschoolers and I talk <br/>
about it when talking to people who are still worried about whether <br/>
unschooled kids will really &quot;learn what they need to learn.&quot; But I no <br/>
longer even bother to consider whether what my kids are doing is <br/>
something they are &quot;learning&quot; from -- I passed that point some time <br/>
over the years - not realizing it when it happened - and now everybody <br/>
just lives and we don&#39;t think of it as &quot;learning&quot; we really ONLY think <br/>
of it as living our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Still, seeing all of the learning that IS happening as kids live their <br/>
unschooling lives, is not a BAD thing. Its a GREAT thing. Maybe this <br/>
further stop is just age-related, my kids are ALL teenagers now - and <br/>
have proven to me over and over and over that they learn all the time. <br/>
I don&#39;t have any question about it even in the deepest darkest corners <br/>
of my heart or mind and so I&#39;m not concerned and so I don&#39;t think about <br/>
it anymore. But, also, I don&#39;t find it surprising or even particularly <br/>
amazing, as I did when I was first discovering what it was like to live <br/>
as an unschooling family - now it just is the way things ARE. So - <br/>
maybe in a way this is just old fogeys like me being a little jaded <br/>
&lt;BEG&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Except I still think that we&#39;re living a lifestyle that is the leading <br/>
edge - on the frontier - of what is to come in the future. And that&#39;s <br/>
pretty cool to think about.<br/>
<br/>
And I still get really jazzed when people newly discover unschooling <br/>
and it clicks for them and changes their family life for the better. I <br/>
love the warm fuzzy feeling I get thinking that I&#39;ve had the chance to <br/>
help them get there!!! I&#39;m definitely not jaded about that!!!<br/>

think about having my kids home now and they don&#39;t either. For at least a year, <br/>
maybe longer I was very aware of the fact every time we went out. Now I never <br/>
think of it and am dumbfounded for a minute when we get the occasional &quot;No <br/>
school today?&quot;. I still cannot figure out why complete strangers ask that <br/>
question. It feels good when I do think about it and realize that it is no longer an <br/>
issue.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I mostly haven&#39;t ever wondered about it. Mine are 9 and 6 now, <br/>
but they just don&#39;t give me time to doubt, they&#39;re always too busy <br/>
showing me what they&#39;ve learned through what they&#39;re doing. So <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed, but (almost ) never worried.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, an outsider will say something that makes me pay <br/>
attention to &quot;what are they learning?&quot;, which usually lasts less <br/>
than a day, sometimes less than an hour!, because the fact <br/>
they&#39;re learning, and the ease with which they&#39;re learning, is <br/>
glowingly, glaringly, flourescently obvious to me.<br/>
<br/>
One of the coolest parts the past few years has been watching <br/>
Wally, home now with our business, have a front row seat for all <br/>
this too. Sometimes, he calls me on the cell phone when I&#39;m out <br/>
on a buying run, just to report the latest. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

learning unaware, or learning non-discriminating more like<br/>
<br/>
It seems to newer unschoolers like this talk of the difference between <br/>
learning and teaching, or learning and just living is just nonsense, but it&#39;s really <br/>
central to making the very small leap to unschooling.   It&#39;s not a far leap, <br/>
it&#39;s like a hop up and turning around 180 degrees in the same spot.   You&#39;re <br/>

       Maybe like when you are expecting a baby, or considering buying a <br/>
certain kind of car, that internal change in awareness suddenly makes it seem that <br/>
babies or baby stuff, or different colors of that particular car, are <br/>
everywhere. This happens to me a lot with all kinds of things.<br/>
