<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575156730">Ds is 13 1/2.  We &quot;unschooled&quot; and didn&#39;t know it until he started ps <br/>
school.  We homeschooled kindergarten because he was already reading, <br/>
writing, multiplying, etc. and the teachers flat out told us he would <br/>
be bored stiff.   We did send him to ps for 2 years and realized that <br/>
was definitely not the best thing for our family.  Since then, we&#39;ve <br/>
used Abeka and BJU.  Last year we tried unschooling for a few months <br/>
but he felt he needed more structure and even got teary that he felt <br/>
he didn&#39;t know how to study anymore.   This year we went back to <br/>
books but I still feel like he&#39;s restricted and there&#39;s so much, esp. <br/>
history that he wants to study, that maybe we should unschool again.  <br/>
He is concerned with not learning everything he feels he should <br/>
learn, like different grammar terms, science facts, math, etc. and <br/>
yet he wants days, like today, where he reads literature, draws, does <br/>
math, internet and playstation.  Do I mix it up, letting him have <br/>
days like today and then on days he feels the need for structure, use <br/>
the books?  I mean, is that basically the unschooling, letting him <br/>
decide that day what to do?<br/>

doing nothing at all, spending the whole day at the<br/>
library, or playing nintendo all day.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
If he wants the structure, the books, and the ability<br/>
to pursue his interests, there is no reason why he<br/>
shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
But let him set the pace, decide when to pull the<br/>
books off the shelf, choose what books he wants to<br/>
use, and what he will study.  My 14yo wanted to learn<br/>
algebra, and asked me for something to use, so she<br/>
picked out the Keys To workbooks, and I think she has<br/>
done a couple.<br/>
<br/>
You might point out to him that sometimes pursuing an<br/>
interest leads to learning in many different ways, and<br/>
textbooks are usually the *least* helpful.  You might<br/>
ask him instead of what subjects he wants, what ideas<br/>
or things interest him.<br/>
<br/>
I found that reference books and real books (those<br/>
written about one subject or one aspect of a subject),<br/>
instead of textbooks, seem to be better suited to<br/>
unschooling (and real life).  We have encyclopedias,<br/>
Eyewitness books, Wildlife guides, DK books...my 14yo<br/>
just pulled the English Handbook down to look<br/>
something up.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night my 5yo was comparing the skeletons in the<br/>
Eyewitness Skeleton book to the pictures of the<br/>
animals in the Mammals book, cuz he wanted &quot;to see<br/>
what they looked like with their skin on, and their<br/>
skin off&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But these are books that we all use, not just the<br/>
kids.<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>
