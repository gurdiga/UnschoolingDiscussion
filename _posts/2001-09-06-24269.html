<div id="ygrps-yiv-9347861">&quot;Bronwen&quot; I think you are absolutely wonderful !! Thank you for sharing that with us! We go thru the same stuff at our house to, Chores....yelling at them to get them done!(gasp!) It seems endless! I have felt the same things you talked about.....always learning it nevers stops!! Sometimes our kids are great teachers!!<br/>
 We just cleaned out our garage yesterday...what a job!! But we all feel better about working together to get it done! I think thats the clue!! To get everyone working together! My kids will tell you I am the worst when it comes to taking the time to stop and work with them on their chore......but OMG it really does help!!!<br/>
