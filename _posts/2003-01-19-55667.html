<div id="ygrps-yiv-769852612">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at work.  I&#39;m trying to reply but I&#39;m having a lot of trouble with <br/>
the web mail.  I&#39;m not sure why that is.<br/>
<br/>
just wanted to let you know I&#39;m reading with great interest but I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if or when I can reply.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417246063">Ok, I&#39;m trying it this way.  The &quot;compose&#39; will work, but not &#39;reply&#39;.<br/>

Wende, you wrote:<br/>

I&#39;m not sure where &quot;nearby&quot; is.&lt;grin&gt; I am about 25 minutes SW of<br/>
Allentown. What part of fashion design is your daughter most interested<br/>
in? The artsy? Sewing? Marketing? Modeling?<br/>
<br/>
We are about 25 minutes east of harrisburg.  She is interested in <br/>
mostly the artsy, sewing stuff, but is also interested in modeling.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what is involved in being a model though.  We have a <br/>
friend who went to modeling school, but it was 1 1/2 hours away.  I <br/>
can&#39;t do that.  I wouldn&#39;t mind hearing other ideas though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know much about the modeling aspect of it. When I did shows I<br/>
would basically recruit people I knew, or shoppers in the store. I never<br/>
went through agents. <br/>
As far as the artsy stuff, I have a copy of a fashion body form that I<br/>
can send or fax to you. Your daughter can practice drawing on that. If<br/>
you can&#39;t find a copy of *WWD*, maybe a copy of Vogue will give her<br/>
inspiration. Another thing I thought of was a book I read years ago. I<br/>
can&#39;t remember if it was a biography, or autobiography, but it told the<br/>
life story of Gloria Vanderbilt. Might be something to look into.<br/>
As far as the sewing stuff, do you have a machine? I can send you some<br/>
extra fabric, and ideas and stuff. If you don&#39;t, I am probably about an<br/>
hour and half away. If you feel like taking a road trip, we can plan a<br/>
sewing day. Let me know.<br/>
