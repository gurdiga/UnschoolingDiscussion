<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567182357">congrats on your newest little bundle (our youngest dss were adopted, too)<br/>
... welcome to the list and I&#39;m anxious to see how the others respond to<br/>
your question ... I&#39;m a newbie to unschooling and still trying to figure all<br/>
of this out, too ...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-331326116">Welcome Angela,<br/>
My suggestion to you is to just live your life as you normally would, but<br/>
turn as many things as possible into a learning experience. Today, for<br/>
instance, we went bowling. What most people would think of as play we turned<br/>
into a lesson. Math with scorekeeping, science with physics of the ball<br/>
going down the alley, etc. Even a trip to the grocery store can be<br/>
educational. Just live life and have fun.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  My question to all of you is this....how do you <br/>
 ensure your children are covering all the bases and aren&#39;t missing<br/>
 out <br/>
  on whole subject areas? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I worry, I ask them to do me a favor and read a bit every few days from <br/>
the &quot;What your....grader ought to know&quot; series (It&#39;s more for my own comfort, <br/>
however.  I don&#39;t really consider it the major part of their homeschooling).  <br/>
They spend most of their time, however, reading and doing what they&#39;re <br/>
interested in (and helping me run after the toddler).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you direct their learning at all with suggestions for the day, or do you <br/>
just have lots of resources around and let them decide?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They generally have things they&#39;re already involved in, and I make <br/>
suggestions occasionally for things that I think they might be interested in. <br/>
 For example, ds (12 yo) has been doing &quot;Simtunes&quot; on the computer for an <br/>
hour or two every day.  He&#39;s learning a lot about music and harmony that way <br/>
(and coming up with some pretty neat tunes).  He also spends a lot of time <br/>
reading fantasy, making creatures out of clay, and working on a 3000 piece <br/>
3-D puzzle of Manhatten.  Dd (8 yo) has been reading a lot about history <br/>
recently (it started with the American Girls books and branched out from <br/>
there).  She also plays with the dollhouses (both hers and my old one that I <br/>
saved) a lot.  <br/>
<br/>
We go to the library at least once a week, and I&#39;ll suggest interesting books <br/>
that I find.  I&#39;ll also suggest articles about science or history that I read <br/>
in various magazines (Newsweek, National Geographic, etc.) that they might be <br/>
interested in.  All of these are just suggestions, however - I rarely require <br/>
anything.  <br/>
