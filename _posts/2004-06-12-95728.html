<div id="ygrps-yiv-959586380">I loved Sandras advice about telling fighting kids that it is a parents<br/>
commitment to keep kids safe and at peace at home, even from verbal abuse<br/>
from a sibling.  My 7yr old and 3 ½ year old sometimes get in territorial<br/>
fights or seek my attention when it is directed elsewhere (phone, speaking<br/>
with another adult).  Weve recently split them up so that now  they have<br/>
their own bedrooms (our den and office space were sacrificed) because the 3<br/>
yr. old only sleeps 5 hours a night and keeps the older one awake,<br/>
constantly wanting the other to play with him.  So the torment goes both<br/>
ways. The fights have diminished slightly, but still, I also feel that my<br/>
approach needs to be retooled.<br/>
<br/>
My older son is very emphatic towards animals : less so with his little<br/>
brother (unless he is physically hurt, falls down, etc then he rushes in<br/>
with band-aids and ice), situational empathy  I dont think he gets that<br/>
yet.  <br/>

If you want a tender, gentle suggestion, sit with him and ask if he<br/>
remembers any times when someone said something mean to him when he was<br/>
little or called him a name he still remembers.  If he comes up with one,<br/>
discuss being sad that it happened, and you wish you could undo it, but<br/>
those things can&#39;t be undone at all.   &quot;No backsies&quot; on names once uttered.<br/>

Maybe you can stir his empathy that way.<br/>
