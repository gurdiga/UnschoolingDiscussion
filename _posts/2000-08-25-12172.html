and then asked for a temporary Cupid tatoo on her arm.  That night, we took <br/>
our kids to a drop-in day care center that we use occassionally when our <br/>
babysitting options are limited.  The kids really have fun there.   When we <br/>
got to the center, the teacher looked at her and said, &quot;Your parents let you <br/>
do that to yourself?&quot;  My husband said, &quot;Sure, why not?&quot;  The teacher, who is <br/>
really a sweet -- if conventional -- woman, looked at us like we were crazy.  <br/>
I was very proud of my husband.<br/>
<br/>
My husband really has come a long way in the last couple of years.  When we <br/>
went to our first unschooling conference, my husband got to see that <br/>
unschooled teenagers aren&#39;t particularly weird or frightening or anything <br/>
like that.  I think he expected that they&#39;d all be dressed in goth with pasty <br/>
white faces and black lipstick.  But, no, they were a pretty mundane bunch.  <br/>
In fact, near the end of the conference, he was saying that they were all TOO <br/>
well adjusted and that just wasn&#39;t normal.  They&#39;re supposed to be rebelling <br/>
against their parents at this age, he insisted.  But during the very last <br/>
workshop, experienced unschooling parents explained that yes, their kids did <br/>
rebel, just like all kids, but with two big differences.  <br/>
<br/>
First, they had more time to do it.  Parents of school kids only see their <br/>
kids for a short time each day and get a concentrated dose of rebellion.  <br/>
Besides, school kids are so caught up in popular culture, that their moods <br/>
and their actions change rapidly, and parents just see this worldwind of <br/>
change and emotion in their kids.  Homeschooled kids are less influenced by <br/>
peers and popular culture. <br/>
<br/>
Second, homeschool families and unschoolers in particular are a lot more <br/>
tolerant of individualism and experimentation and a lot more respectful of <br/>
their children as people.  Allowing kids to experiment takes a lot of the <br/>
sting out of rebellion.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, my husband has come to believe that &quot;traditional&quot; rebellion is in fact <br/>
rebellion against artificial control that many parents, especially school <br/>
parents, inflict on their children in order to gain a sense of balance.<br/>
