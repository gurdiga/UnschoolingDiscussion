&quot;The list is sort of like an encyclopedia of unschooling. Anyone is  <br/>
welcome to contribute who can add something, either a question or a  <br/>
response or observation, that will help others unschool. The intent --  <br/>
the promise made to the list members -- is the encyclopedia won&#39;t  <br/>
waste their time with chit chat and soothing support but will focus on  <br/>
what will help them grow relationships with their kids.&quot;<br/>

It was in an e-mail of someone unhappy that a post had been returned.<br/>

The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
