<br/>
I thought maybe unschoolers would have some good ideas<br/>
for party games.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I HATE those &quot;win the game get a prize&quot; games!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any great ideas that don&#39;t cost much?  <br/>

which).  Anyway, we put up plastic covered banquet tables and I <br/>
supplied the paint.  They brought their own shirts but you could <br/>
probably get pretty cheap white tees.  I had acrylic paint, brushes, <br/>
stencils, stamps, fabric glue, sequins and glass stones.  They had a <br/>
ball with it.<br/>
<br/>
Warning - they must wear old clothes for this party!!!<br/>

at bdays in our family. You put a big sheet on the<br/>
floor then turn on the music. you could pretend the<br/>
sheet is a huge lilly pad. When the music turns on the<br/>
kids hop around the the lilly pad. When the music<br/>
turns off everyone jumps on the sheet/lilly pad. On<br/>
the next round the lilly pad/sheet gets smaller ;) <br/>
Turn the music on more hopping turn the music off<br/>
everyone hops on the lilly pad before you turn the<br/>
music on again the lilly pad/sheet hrinks some more ;)<br/>
Soon the lilly pad shrinks so much the kids need to<br/>
really cooperate to all stay on the lilly pad. <br/>
<br/>
When my dd had a tea party the sheet was the saucer<br/>
and the kids were mad spinning tea cups. So you can<br/>
tailor it to any kind of theme party.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A fun party favor is to get some crepe paper and wrap<br/>
little toys and/or candy in it to make a big ball of<br/>
stuff to unwrap. Hand those out when the kids leave or<br/>
while ds is opening his bday gifts and the other kids<br/>
are getting antsy. They could also be something you<br/>
try and treasure hunt for.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431429427">My daughter loves this game that she saw on Zoom.  It is a relay race with <br/>
clothes in a suitcase.  Divide the children into two teams.  Give each team a <br/>
suitcase with like items in each.  Use adult clothing that goes on easily <br/>
over the childrens clothes and shoes.  Dad&#39;s shorts, t-shirts, hats, gloves, <br/>
and scarves work well.  The first person on each team has to put all items on <br/>
over their own, then run to their teammate about ten feet away, then remove <br/>
all items.  The teammate has to then put the items on and so on until each <br/>
member has dressed and undressed, and the last player repacks the suitcase.  <br/>
The first team done wins.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721518750">And to go into the picture frame, you can put a huge piece of <br/>
newsprint on the wall with &quot;Happy Birthday _______&quot; on it and have the <br/>
kids help decorate it.  Then, with a polaroid or digital camera, take <br/>
their pictures, print them out, and give them the pictures for their <br/>
picture frames.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448994591">More birthday party ideas:<br/>
-  Get cupcakes instead of a cake and fill Wilton cake decorating bags <br/>
with different colors of icing and let them decorate their own <br/>
cupcakes.  That way you don&#39;t have to buy or make a cake and the kids <br/>
love it! <br/>
-You could also have a bunch of toppings and let them make their own <br/>
sundaes.  (Warning!  Dd did this at her party and I couldn&#39;t believe <br/>
how much whipped cream we went through!  Have a LOT of it on hand! <br/>
lol)  <br/>
-Pinatas are always a big hit.  You could make your own with your <br/>
child ahead of time.  A plus with this is that you don&#39;t have to hand <br/>
out goodie bags at the end.  Everyone just takes their pinata goodies <br/>
home.  <br/>
-This game does involve a prize, but it&#39;s fun.  Each child writes his <br/>
name two times and puts it in a basket.  You have 3 presents <br/>
pre-wrapped.  The kids don&#39;t know what&#39;s in them.  You pick names from <br/>
a hat.  When you call a name, the kids can pick any present they want. <br/>
They can take a present from anyone.  I often put a cheap or gag <br/>
present in the big, beautifully decorated package and put something <br/>
more valuable in the small, plainer package.  The last three people <br/>
with their names called end up with the presents.  This might be <br/>
upsetting for younger kids (they might not understand someone taking <br/>
&quot;their&quot; present) but if you&#39;re going to have 7 years old and up, it <br/>
should be fine.  <br/>
-If you get snow, tell everyone to bring their snowsuits and sleds!  <br/>
Serve hot chocolate when they come in! We have summer birthdays, so <br/>
our parties are often pool parties. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Funny story about this summer when Quinton was 2 and we had a Pinata. Since <br/>
he was the birthday boy, and it just kind of started going this way, Quinton <br/>
got a turn in between everyone else&#39;s turn. It was mostly two year olds and <br/>
they were not making much headway on the Pinata. . . Quinton making the most <br/>
I think. He quickly got into the &quot;Quinton&#39;s turn&quot; mode and would say it at <br/>
every turn. Now, he thinks it goes like this for everything. Every other turn <br/>
for anything is &quot;Quinton&#39;s turn&quot;. . . we haven&#39;t figured out a way to let him <br/>
know that isn&#39;t always true. <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but I don&#39;t know much in the way of birthday games. . . we pretty much <br/>
have free play for most of it, and since he is a summer birthday, lots of <br/>
water balloons and bubbles which probaly wouldn&#39;t work now, unless you are in <br/>
the tropics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448666149">Try doing a web search for the New Games Foundation. Back in the seventies,<br/>
they published books and organized gatherings related to New Games, which<br/>
were meant to be competitive at times, but not in a winners/losers way.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if you play a game in which there are two goals and two teams,<br/>
players are free to abandon the team that is winning and go help the losing<br/>
side, to keep the game going as long as possible. You may be familiar with<br/>
Earthball, in which an enormous ball (ten feet across?) was moved back and<br/>
forth across a field until everybody dropped from exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
If you search and find something, please post it. When we were kids, my<br/>
brother and I used a book they printed, and I always wondered what happened<br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
Nature games are often non-competitive. One good book is called Sharing<br/>
Nature With Children.<br/>

<br/>
I think I&#39;ll save the shirt idea for next year - I<br/>
don&#39;t have time to plan that one!  I might go with the<br/>
picture frames.  Or the cupcakes...now I have lots to<br/>
think about!  And only one day to do it!  <br/>
<br/>
I figured being Christmas and all, and living in a<br/>
small town, we wouldn&#39;t get many kids!  I was thinking<br/>
2 at the most!  <br/>
<br/>
But anyways, when it comes down to it the kids will<br/>
probably think up their own stuff despite my desperate<br/>
planning!<br/>
