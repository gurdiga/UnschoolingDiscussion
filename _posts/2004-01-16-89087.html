But I have strong objections to the Pearls and the<br/>
Ezzos and their methods of child training, so it is no<br/>
surprise they let their toddler fall into the pond to<br/>
teach it danger.<br/>
<br/>
You know, there is another school of thought, that we<br/>
don&#39;t have to expose our kids to bad things in order<br/>
for them to understand that bad things are, well, bad.<br/>
<br/>
The federal agents that are trained to recognize<br/>
counterfeit money don&#39;t spend hours and hours studying<br/>
counterfeits.  They spend hours, months, years<br/>
studying the real thing.  And then when they see a<br/>
counterfeit they know right away, because of what it<br/>
isn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100332885">I&#39;m not very familiar with the Pearl&#39;s methods, although from what I understand they do advocate spanking...I&#39;ve heard much more, and read some excerpts from the materials of, the Ezzos and I do disagree with their philosophy. <br/>
 <br/>
Most of what I&#39;ve read recently from that listing of articles has been somewhat unschoolish in approach and understanding, although I recognize where the articles have been picked to possibly give the best impression overall when there may very well be other things more specifically that I wouldn&#39;t agree with...<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t agree that letting a toddler fall into a pond is the best way to handle having one around; rather, helping the child to learn to swim from an early age. <br/>
 <br/>
Overall though I had wanted to toss out that one quote for discussion rather than the Pearl&#39;s ideas...<br/>
 <br/>
I do agree that it takes more awareness to parent as we are than in a more traditional and adversarial approach. That is the key to unschooling isn&#39;t it? Being aware of our children, who they are, what they like, what they want, rather than imposing rules and &quot;musts&quot; and &quot;coulds&quot; and &quot;shoulds&quot; on them? Giving them the liberty to be themselves, and secure in that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right.  Well, it would not be helpful to anyone&#39;s<br/>
unschooling to discuss their philosophies here, of<br/>
course.  And anyone who wants to know about them can<br/>
certainly google enough information.<br/>
<br/>
I know enough about the Pearls to know where the idea<br/>
of training a toddler to be afraid of the pond by<br/>
allowing him to fall in it comes from.  They do<br/>
advocate training infants and toddlers with a switch<br/>
to not touch things or not go where they shouldn&#39;t, so<br/>
it would fall in that same vein.<br/>
<br/>
I did like the descriptions of their children&#39;s<br/>
childhood experiences as missionaries though, and how<br/>
they were able to draw on those experiences later in<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
It does show that our children&#39;s experiences do<br/>
adequately prepare them for their choices as adults,<br/>
now, doesn&#39;t it!?<br/>
