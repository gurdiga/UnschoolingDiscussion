<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124593012">Hi everyone.  I have been listening and contributing as I felt led to for<br/>
a while.  I still don&#39;t know why on email people feel such a need to<br/>
defend themselves.  It fuels the fire and fills up inboxes wastefully.  I<br/>
think we should just state our disagreement with the other&#39;s<br/>
disagreement, and leave it at that.  Someone has to take the first step<br/>
of not reacting off the other&#39;s reaction.  If people had not disagreed<br/>
with other&#39;s definitions of unschooling, I would not have learned as much<br/>
as I have about unschooling.  Our disagreements give us an opportunity to<br/>
communicate, learn and challenge ourselves to grow.  People can argue<br/>
without taking things personally.  My husband and I are very different. <br/>
When we disagree, we state our differing feelings and opinions, then come<br/>
up with a solution.  If there isn&#39;t any mutually agreeable solution<br/>
because our opinions are so opposed, we agree to disagree.  No one has to<br/>
win.  No one has to lose.  But we both get to express our viewpoint and<br/>
that is what keeps us sane and together.  I think the world should have<br/>
more peace-no need to get mad just because someone is disagreeing with<br/>
us.  Bonni</div>
