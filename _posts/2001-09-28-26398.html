<div id="ygrps-yiv-6378387">I am posting this as a way to explain a PORTION of how I believe. I am not <br/>
interested in converting anyone to this way of thinking. . . I am not saying <br/>
that what you may believe is wrong or bad or &quot;more evolved&quot;. I am putting <br/>
forth ideas for consideration if so desired. Some people have expressed <br/>
interest and in that vein, here you go. . . <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had hoped that, as the quality of life continued to rise in our contry and <br/>
around the world, our people and especially our young people, in whom should <br/>
reside, it if resides anywhere, would be our promise of tomorrow. But we are <br/>
seeing anger displayed in our youth as we have never seen it displayed <br/>
before, and we are frightened and deeply troubled. The brutal murder of <br/>
Matthew Shephard, left to die on the cow fence in Wyoming, and the startling <br/>
events at Columbine High School shock awake once again, just when we may <br/>
have been lulled into thinking, with our improving economic conditions and <br/>
our seemingly greater social justice, that we are at least on the right <br/>
track. <br/>
<br/>
Yet, all that is happening here is not a mystery. THere is a reason that our <br/>
species seems addicted to these behaviors. The reason is found in one single <br/>
word: &quot;better&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This one word, applied to themselves by members of the human family, has <br/>
caused all of the ills of human society. It is our idea that we are somehow <br/>
&quot;better&quot; than another that is making us act worse. As individuals. As <br/>
neighborhoods. As states. As nations.<br/>
<br/>
Many people, most people, perhaps . . . seem to think that they are &quot;better&quot; <br/>
than those around them. THey believe that their neighborhood is &quot;better&quot; than <br/>
the surrounding neighborhood, that their state is &quot;better&quot; than the <br/>
neighboring state, and that their nation is better than the next nation.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is part of our cultural history of Competition, which arises out<br/>
of our cultural history of Separation. A &quot;cultural story&quot; is a story we tell <br/>
oursleves about how life is. It is based on fiction and has nothing to do <br/>
with reality, yet it persists, becuase it is told over and over again, and <br/>
acted out, by the members of our species who have an interest in perpetuating <br/>
it. Others follow the model.<br/>
<br/>
Our biggest cultural story, the one we have held onto the longest and that <br/>
has spread the farthest, is The Story Of Separation. In this story, we <br/>
imagine oursleves to be separate from God, and therefore seprate from each <br/>
other. As with most cultural myths, this story has nothing to do with <br/>
reality. Yet it persists, and has informed our indidvidual and collective <br/>
ideas and actions for millinea.<br/>
<br/>
In truth, God and we are One. There is no separation, no disunity. And in <br/>
truth, our fellow humans and we are One. We are as different parts of the One <br/>
Body, called Humanity. Yet we do not know this, or if we do know it, we <br/>
cannot accept it. Our culture will not allow us to.<br/>
<br/>
Out of our cultural story of separation, comes the idea of &quot;competition:, for <br/>
if we are separate from each other, then we are each on our own, and must <br/>
compete with each other for the limited resources which we need to survive. <br/>
This is how the &quot;story&quot; goes. It is not the truth, but it is a long-told <br/>
story, and we believe it. And so, it might as well be the truth, since what <br/>
you believe is true enough for you.<br/>
<br/>
Out of our cultural Story of Competition comes the idea of &quot;better&quot;, for if <br/>
we are competing with each other, we must have a reason for ruthlessly <br/>
pursuing victory, for doing whatever it takes to come out on top. This <br/>
reason, we tell ourselves, is that we are Better than our opponents. We <br/>
deserve to win. They deserve to lose. This judgement about our relative <br/>
goodness, or &quot;betterness&quot;, allows us to justify our actions. Any actions, <br/>
really, that we feel we have to take in order to &quot;win&quot;. And there&#39;s the rub. <br/>
For it is what we DO when we imagine ourselves to be &quot;better&quot; that sets the <br/>
stage for the human tragedy. In the name of &quot;betterness&quot; we humans not only <br/>
knock down and punch in the face of other hockey players, we not only use <br/>
&quot;unnecessary roughness&quot; on our football fields, some of us &quot;ethnically <br/>
cleanse&quot; our nations. Some of us claim prerogatives which are not ours.<br/>
<br/>
. . . . That is right, we actually end the life of others of our own species <br/>
because we believe we have a &quot;better&quot; way of approaching God, a &quot;better&quot; <br/>
method of governing, a &quot;better&#39; reason for claiming the land, a &quot;better&quot; <br/>
economic justicifation for our predatory action.<br/>
<br/>
That is exactly what is happening today is Ksovo. It is what has happened <br/>
before in our human history, and it is what will happen again, unless and <br/>
until those who write our Cultural Story do so in a new way.<br/>
<br/>
And so who are the writers of our story? They are, in the main, our <br/>
religions. It is our religions that, from the beginning and to this very day, <br/>
have told us about oursleves. They&#39;ve told us who we are, and what to believe <br/>
about ourselves and others. And it is religions that have fostered and <br/>
furthered the Myth of Betterness.<br/>
<br/>
Because religions teach their followers that they are &quot;better than the <br/>
followers of other religions- so much better, in fact, that they, and only <br/>
they, will spend the Afterlife in the presence of God- and religions claim <br/>
and believe that this Declaration of Betterness has come directly from God, <br/>
cultures and traditons are ignited which give themselves permission to hurt <br/>
and to kill in the name of this &quot;truth&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
THe irony is that religions claim that this &quot;truth&quot; is what will save us, and <br/>
in fact, it is exactly what is killing us instead. Indeed, the idea that one <br/>
of us, or one group of us, is somehow &quot;better&quot; than another, and therefore <br/>
has a right and a need for more resources, more land, more oil, more <br/>
whatEVER, that has caused death and destruction on this planet hte likes of <br/>
which the love of God could never in purity or truth justify.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I issue an invitation to all the world&#39;s religions. Say to your <br/>
leaders and say to your followers this one sentence: &quot;Our religion is no <br/>
better than any other, and WE are no better than any other. Our way is not a <br/>
better way, our way is merely another way.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244868650">&lt;&lt; As with most cultural myths, this story has nothing to do with reality.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This has a lot to do with language and concept.  The parts about religion, <br/>
and truth, and belief all go back to the very basics of language and kids <br/>
asking &quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids think their parents are godlike when they&#39;re little, so the earliest <br/>
answer to &quot;why is this this way?&quot; are answered and believed with big <br/>
certainty.  And because people speak different languages and have different <br/>
traditions of &quot;why,&quot; the answers are different from a very basic, toddler <br/>
level.<br/>
<br/>
If there were only two tribes of cavemen and they spoke different languages, <br/>
all the problems mentioned would still be there.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think we can ignore  human nature or the realities of cultures.   The <br/>
reminder (reminder for some, news for others) that different religions grew <br/>
up differently from the same kinds of roots is valid only for the <br/>
philosophical and fairly non-religious.<br/>
<br/>
The three religions with which most of us are most familiar--Christianity, <br/>
Judaism and Islam--all have something at the base of them which doesn&#39;t allow <br/>
for the idea that others are equally as valid or applicable to them.  For <br/>
them to say &quot;we&#39;re all the same&quot; is the same as saying &quot;I&#39;ve been wrong and <br/>
all my ancestors, and not only what my parents siad was wrong, but what I&#39;ve <br/>
believed God said was wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most people don&#39;t want that denial of their ancestry and beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Culture is a reality.  The existence of mythology is a reality.  Linguistic <br/>
differences are big, limiting realities.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe under all big questions needs to be an &quot;IF&quot;--what is best if one wants <br/>
to be a good Baptist?  Don&#39;t go to the bar, get drunk, dance and take a woman <br/>
home and sleep with her.   Within the set of &quot;b and some things don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If on a larger, cultural scale someone could persuade all religious leaders <br/>
and followers to agree to the idea that they were all equally valid and right <br/>
about the afterlife and one another (it cancels itself out right there, but <br/>
&quot;if&quot;) then that still woudln&#39;t change what it takes to be a good Baptist, or <br/>
unchooler, or balloonist, or sculptor or plumber.<br/>
<br/>
This is a big philosophical issue, but it makes more sense with the quote.  <br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra</div>

<br/>
Also, let me just add, that is not something that I am able to put into <br/>
practice all the time as yet. . . as I have been programmed to believe lots <br/>
of things, it is at times difficult to totally change old habits, just like <br/>
it is with unschooling. . . hard to totally get rid of that teacher or school <br/>
mentality. . . my goal is to just keep at it day in and day out.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t thinkt his is the same &quot;better&quot; we&#39;ve been discussing.  It&#39;s not<br/>
the one I&#39;ve been discussing, anyway. I see a big difference between a<br/>
person and a person&#39;s actions. You and I might both bake cakes, and you<br/>
might bake a better cake, but that doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re a better person.<br/>
Baking skills can be improved and changed, they&#39;re not an unchangeable<br/>
part of you. Over the years, people have shown me better ways to knit and<br/>
bowl and write and make coffee and bake pizza... and better ways to be<br/>
with my kid, as well. I would be really sad and hurt if my friends saw me<br/>
doing something they thought was harmful to my kid - and that&#39;s really<br/>
what this is about, because as an unschooler, I do believe that forcing<br/>
&quot;schoolwork&quot; is harmful - and didn&#39;t say anything to me, didn&#39;t point out<br/>
what I was doing and why I might want to change it. How would I learn and<br/>
grow that way? It would sure be a slow process, for me to have to find<br/>
all of the answers on my own.<br/>
<br/>
And of course, like everyone, I always have the right to say, &quot;I hear you<br/>
saying that you think it would be better if Cacie had a schedule for<br/>
sleeping and waking, and I&#39;ll keep it in mind if we start to have issues<br/>
around fatigue, but right now this works for us.&quot; Although if I said it<br/>
on a list called &quot;The Joys of Scheduling every minute of Your Child&#39;s<br/>
Day&quot;, then I might wonder what I was doing there...<br/>
