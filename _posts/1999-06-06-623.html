<div id="ygrps-yiv-1472510498">Is there anyone who DID have a positive experience in public school?  My <br/>
kindergarten report card says something like, &quot;Very intelligent and <br/>
enthusiastic.  A pleasure to have in class.&quot;  My first grade report card <br/>
says, &quot;Needs to learn to deal with frustration without tears.&quot;  As time <br/>
went on, it got worse.  My fourth grade teacher wrote something like, <br/>
&quot;underachiever.  Needs to put in more effort.&quot;  I was begging to be <br/>
homeschooled from the second I heard of it (in 6th grade), but my mother <br/>
and father both (mostly my father - he has all these degrees, and thinks <br/>
learning can only take place in front of a textbook when taught by a <br/>
&quot;qualified&quot; specialist, ie teacher) are more anti-homeschooling than any <br/>
other &quot;anti&quot; group I&#39;ve ever known.  That&#39;s why it completely surprised <br/>
me when my mother said she MIGHT homeschool my sisters, maybe, if the <br/>
schools in the area they&#39;re moving to are REALLY bad.  And then, only IF <br/>
she can find a suitable, complete yet inexpensive curriculum, and a <br/>
large homeschool group with children my sisters&#39; exact same ages.  In <br/>
any case, when I left home for college, I was so afraid of everybody, <br/>
because I&#39;d been bullied from first grade to twelfth.  I also thought I <br/>
wasn&#39;t smart enough and that I&#39;d get kicked out.  All throughout my <br/>
school years, we would go over the wrong answers on our tests as a class <br/>
(not a single person in my classes would make it through that without <br/>
some teasing), and work through those problems in class.  I would <br/>
usually get 100% on the tests (I almost flunked out of school though, <br/>
just because I wouldn&#39;t do my homework), so I&#39;d pull out a book or <br/>
something, and every time, I got detention for not paying attention.  (I <br/>
would also get detention for not doing my homework.)  <br/>
<br/>
DH claims he had a wonderful time in public schools (well, he grew up in <br/>
an extremely dysfunctional family, so I guess it was just nice for him <br/>
to get away), and he&#39;s REALLY smart and a hard worker - always does what <br/>
he&#39;s told, and somehow knows how to lead, too, so I guess that helped <br/>
him.  But when I press him, it wasn&#39;t school he enjoyed - it was the <br/>
after-school activities.  Still, he doesn&#39;t want to deprive our <br/>
children, so...  But I have a couple more years to convince him.  It&#39;s <br/>
happening little by little.  I squeeze every bit of education out of an <br/>
activity, and translate it for him - ds has almost learned his fractions <br/>
just by helping me measure when I cook (though I never measured before I <br/>
started unschooling him), he knows that orange juice is better for you <br/>
than orange soda and why (health and nutrition), he also knows the names <br/>
of every train and bulldozer/powershovel/crane/type machine in Japan <br/>
(including major serial numbers and what they mean), and the mechanics <br/>
and electronics of how they operate.  Though if I showed him a textbook <br/>
workbook with all the math he knows (yes, my two year old knows some <br/>
basic algebra), he wouldn&#39;t know what to do with it.  He knows that two <br/>
fourths of a cup are the same as one half.  He knows that if he has six <br/>
cookies, then Daddy gets two, he gets two, and Mama gets two - without <br/>
even having to count it out.  Before I started unschooling him - before <br/>
I even thought about homeschooling (sorry to say, I grew up with my <br/>
parents attitudes about homeschooling) - I taught him all his numbers <br/>
and letters - uppercase and lowercase and what they sound like, so he <br/>
knows that.  The next step was to teach him to read, but fortunately I <br/>
learned about unschooling first, so I won&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; him to read until <br/>
he&#39;s ready, and he&#39;s not.  My mother is really impressed with him so <br/>
far.  I couldn&#39;t recognise my letters or numbers until I was four, and <br/>
she really had to work with me.  When I told her that he also knew his <br/>
fractions (though he can&#39;t recognise them on paper) and some basic <br/>
algebra, she told me I was pushing him too hard and he would be burnt <br/>
out before he was even old enough to go to pre-school, but I only help <br/>
him where he asks for it, and then translate what he knows into <br/>
eduspeak.  DH says I shouldn&#39;t lie like that - that if he can&#39;t do it on <br/>
paper and from textbook examples, then he really can&#39;t do it at all.  So <br/>
I&#39;m working on other ways of convincing DH.  Like, &quot;Here - you want to <br/>
improve your English, right?  Read this...&quot;  hehe<br/>
<br/>
Love, MElanie in Japan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-285127844">&lt;&lt;Is there anyone who DID have a positive experience in public school? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did.<br/>
It was better than home.  There were books at school, and adults who had been <br/>
places and done things.  There were other kids I couldn&#39;t have met in my <br/>
neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
But in retrospect, because I was successful in school, and somewhat <br/>
competitive, I was having some of my positive experiences at the expense of <br/>
others.  I did well, which caused others not to be able to be top or best.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of my friends could have been having better times at home.  (They had <br/>
books and educated parents and art supplies and music at their houses which I <br/>
didn&#39;t have in such abundance.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;DH claims he had a wonderful time in public schools (well, he grew up in <br/>

after-school activities. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with him.  School had marching band, and clubs, and my bus came 40 <br/>
minutes after school was out so I got to hang out with the kids, and the <br/>
teachers, and in the library, and the public library was only three blocks <br/>
away and I had time to go there.  In school they had choirs (so did they at <br/>
church, but wimpy expectations at church), and an ART ROOM!!!<br/>
