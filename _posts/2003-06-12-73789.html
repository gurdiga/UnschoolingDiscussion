&lt;People tell me all the time that I need to &quot;let Tim go&quot; more, or <br/>
he&#39;ll<br/>
always be attached to my apron strings&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This reminded me of something I wanted to post/ask about but got so <br/>
behind I forgot &lt;g&gt;.  My gf has twin girls (2 1/2yo) and a 5yo.  They <br/>
were at her dd graduation and the twins, of course at that attached <br/>
to mom phase, wanted no one else.  When she went up to take pictures, <br/>
one of the twins screamed her head off with dad.  Everyone proceded <br/>
to tell her how rough it must be on her dh, and this was why her <br/>
marriage had problems, etc, etc,.  One friend called her and bluntly <br/>
told her she had no control over her kids, that they were running the <br/>
household.  I was horrified, she was in tears over this.  I told her <br/>
some postive, supportive things, poor woman!  Anyway, she is really <br/>
struggling with the twins.  All her girls are fiesty.  My first was a <br/>
breeze, my second harder so I can see that personality difference.  <br/>
She got 3 kids, none of which are a breeze (really, if you are going <br/>
to have twins, isn&#39;t one of them supposed to be mild tempered?..LOL) <br/>
and she is really having a hard time.  Anyone with twins have some <br/>
suggestions.  She tries to distract and such and does keep them <br/>
busy.   They bite and hit eachother and of course, being that there <br/>
are two of them they put those little brains to work to figure out <br/>
things one would not.  Any advice, books, websites for her.  She is a <br/>
great mom who tries to be relaxed,) I think with a little confidence <br/>
and advice she would have few problems because she has the right <br/>
attitude. She always starts things with &quot;my little monsters&quot;, or <br/>
such.  At first, I didn&#39;t really think about it, but I think people <br/>
are making her feel like she needs to validate what she thinks they <br/>
think about her.  Does that make sense?? I have been reading FOREVER, <br/>
LOL.I am soooo behind!  Thanks for feedback :)<br/>

First off that whole good twin /bad twin thing is totally a wives tale. <br/>
Personailty differences, yes, but mild mannered vs. quick tempered, has never <br/>
existed in our house. Kass & Kree are 11 and very much the same, but different. LOL <br/>
Kass is very girlly, very nuturing, very confrontational and very much the <br/>
overseer of her twin. Kree OTOH is very much a tomboy, very quick to forgive and <br/>
very much the jokester, sometimes to the point of going too far. Although my <br/>
DH for some reason has completely forgotten the rough times, I can assure you <br/>
and your friend that it was between 2 1/2 and 3 1/2. I can&#39;t say why, other <br/>
than in my experience they are learning to function without each other, yet <br/>
still have an indescribable bond, that to this day amazes me. They very much had a <br/>
language of their own and were always protective of one another. They were <br/>
only 2 when they had their first physical confrontation with another child. A <br/>
neighbor had a daycare and I would often take the twins there to play with the <br/>
children she watched and to have some adult interaction myself. Well, one day <br/>
this 4 yr old knocked Kass down and before I could even get up, Kree had run <br/>
across the yard, pushed the 4 yr old down and said quite clearly in 2 yr old <br/>
dialogue, &quot;No push my Sissy!&quot; The neighbor and I  were so astounded that we never <br/>
even had to get up, besides which we were laughing so hard, the 4 yr old got <br/>
up and went to play something else. He never again messed with either one when <br/>
we were over. <br/>
<br/>
As far as qualifying herself to anyone, I wouldn&#39;t bother. People often think <br/>
because twins are so &quot;neat&quot; they forget they are still individuals trying to <br/>
make the world see them as such and yet the bond they share is beyond words. I <br/>
mean really, I can&#39;t even conceive the notion of having to share since the <br/>
point of conception. Then you come out and everyone immediately tries to <br/>
personify you when you have barely been in the world. <br/>
<br/>
I remember feeling overwhelmed during that 2 - 3 year old stage. In fact, <br/>
Kass and Kree were so difficult at that age, we laugh because there is an entire <br/>
year of no photos of them. Everytime I got them dressed to get their picture <br/>
done, it ended in tears,  primarily mine!!! LOL I remember doing anything and <br/>
everything to not have to go in public. I mean there are two little people who <br/>
now walk, don&#39;t really want to be in a stroller and there&#39;s only one of me. <br/>
And of course whichever stroller I took would just be the battle for that day. <br/>
Facing each other they&#39;d talk in that mysterious language they had and end up <br/>
fighting, side by side they&#39;d pinch or bite, and front to back, the one in back <br/>
would pull the hair of the one in front. It was an all around lose-lose <br/>
situation and I wondered if I&#39;d make it to them hitting 4 without completely losing <br/>
my marbles. Then for some miraculous reason they hit 4 and all was well. <br/>
Again, I couldn&#39;t tell you why, but they just changed. They went back to being <br/>
inseparable, which they still are today to a large extent. <br/>
<br/>
They each have their own room, we have a total of 6 beds (4 queen, 1 full & <br/>
1king) in our house. They have never once slept alone. Generally they end up in <br/>
our room, but never apart from each other. They also still sleep completely <br/>
cuddled together. The only time in their life they slept apart was the first <br/>
week they came home from the hospital because I had no idea that if they slept <br/>
together they would sleep through the night. Hello, light bulb moment...put <br/>
them back together and tada...12 hours of restfull bliss. That&#39;s right 12 hours. <br/>
7:30 pm to 7:30 am the first 2 years of their lives. They never woke up during <br/>
the nite as long as they had each other. Made sense though. So when they have <br/>
acted horrible or hateful to each other all we have to do is mention that <br/>
perhaps they should sleep apart and all the ill-will goes right out the window. <br/>
&quot;Heck no, mom, my sister totally bugs but that doesn&#39;t mean we don&#39;t still need <br/>
each other.&quot; LOL Could I ask for a better response? It will be kind of sad <br/>
the day they decide they do in fact want their own sleep space. <br/>
<br/>
Please tell your friend to keep up the good work and believe it or not one <br/>
day you wake up and wonder what you were so worried about. Not to mention <br/>
getting a little peeved at the audacity people have when it comes to how they think <br/>
you should parent. I always countered sarcasm with do you have twins? If not, <br/>
are you a twin? And finally, when you give birth to more than one person at a <br/>
time, talk to me then, otherwise, mind your own business. <br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who knows exactly why her daughters have no problem with <br/>
confrontation.LOL<br/>
