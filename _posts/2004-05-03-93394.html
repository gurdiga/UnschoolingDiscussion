<div id="ygrps-yiv-151512377">This group has had 35 members join since Wednesday the 28th (eliminating <br/>
those who just peeked and left, and not counting several who who had to re-up <br/>
because a small batch was accidentally deleted).<br/>
<br/>
The group has 1522 members.  It would be fine with me if it didn&#39;t continue <br/>
to grow, but it does.<br/>
<br/>
Someone sent an announcement of another group to this list but it was bounced <br/>
by a moderator for being insulting.   Rather than wait for that person to <br/>
announce the list again minus the insult, I&#39;ll just pass on the invitation.   <br/>
<br/>
The list is called <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:UnschoolingDiscussions@yahoogroups.com">UnschoolingDiscussions@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Coincidence?  No, purposeful deception and malice.  <br/>
Or maybe just lack of creativity.  But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just that.<br/>
<br/>
That list has 25 members, after four months of existence.<br/>
They&#39;ve had 184 posts in four months.  We&#39;ve had 103 posts since the <br/>
beginning of May, a little over two days ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Bigger isn&#39;t necessarily better.  That one might be a lovely list.<br/>
<br/>
The description at yahoogroups is this:<br/>
<br/>
Description     Category: Home Schooling <br/>
Courteous open forum for intellectual discussion of unschooled home <br/>
education: definition, principles and practices. <br/>
<br/>
~~&gt;Pajama&#39;d emperors won&#39;t be parading here, and we&#39;ll be hoping to gently <br/>
sort items into what &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not&quot; a component of unschooling (home school ~ <br/>
home education). Subject lines are important for developing archives. And, <br/>
please: No spam or school/ curriculum promotions - thanks very much! <br/>
<br/>
If, due to your faith or questioning of unschool authorities and/or resident <br/>
homeschool experts, you have been bleeped off &quot;that other list&quot; (whichever <br/>
list that may have been), welcome! <br/>
<br/>
Please note: messages need the &quot;s&quot; in the eddress at the end of <br/>
&quot;unschoolingdiscussions&quot;, or else they would be sent to (and bounced back from) the <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion list, which is not us! <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===============end of quote====================<br/>
<br/>
I assume they hope to accidently get some members who intended to subscribe <br/>
to this list.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago two other side lists were started, but they werne&#39;t <br/>
nicer than this one at all; much worse.  Their memberships were largely people <br/>
who went to see what they were doing, and they died out because they didn&#39;t <br/>
really have much to say but to badmouth this list.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this currently new list doesn&#39;t have the same problems, but I wish <br/>
they had chosen a name that wasn&#39;t purposely designed to cause confusion.   <br/>
There&#39;s a name for that in internet address terms, but I don&#39;t remember what it is. <br/>
 And I think there&#39;s a name for it in business law, too.  Fraud?<br/>
<br/>
The owners of this list have known about the other list for a couple of <br/>
months, but nothing was said or done.  It&#39;s irritating, but not hurting us.  Rather <br/>
than let one of their members come here and recruit, I&#39;ll just do it for them.<br/>
<br/>
Now they&#39;ll have more posts on their list because they can discuss this one.<br/>
<br/>
Sad, to have so much time to spend on troublemaking, and sad to have the <br/>
desire to do it.  I wish they would spend that energy with their children instead <br/>
of causing trouble for other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
And for anyone who is interested in a different unschooling list that exists <br/>
more legitimately, here are some others:<br/>

<br/>
Where do the pajama&#39;d emperors parade? <br/>
 <br/>
I would so like to know what a pajama&#39;d emperor is and why they are to be<br/>
avoided.  Maybe I&#39;d just like to see an emperor in his pj&#39;s.    OH!  <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s a reference to the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes?  His new clothes are<br/>
pajamas?  Poor bastard.   He&#39;ll never be taken seriously in his jammies. <br/>
 But what does that have to do with unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I bounced on the trampoline this morning in my pajamas.   I&#39;m not an<br/>
emperor but I am in charge of all the litter pans here.   I have gotten<br/>
pretty good at recognizing a load of shit when I see it. <br/>

he&#39;d like to parade around in them but the proximity of neighbours and <br/>
windows make that tricky.<br/>
<br/>
On the unschooling topic, last night my son and husband made a replica of <br/>
the Canadian Parliament buildings with a Straws and Connectors set we got <br/>
at a yard sale on the weekend. They looked up the design in the Junior <br/>
Canadian Encyclopedia and cut some of the straws to make curves and shorter <br/>
areas. Then William put some Lego people around for MPs (not military <br/>
police, Members of Parliament, our nationally elected politicians). He even <br/>
made name tags for some of them. Cool.<br/>

doesn&#39;t quite sound right: the surprise visitor was not IN my <br/>
pajamas, I was in my pajamas, the visitor arrived at the house <br/>
where my pajamas and I reside).<br/>

&lt;G&gt; - but I wonder how they know I like to wear pajamas and why they <br/>
think THAT is worthy of comment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Argh. Other people always seem to find the coolest stuff at yards sales! I&#39;m still looking for Zoombinis but DH got a much, much bigger tax return than we were expecting (a whole &#39;nother zero!) so I think I&#39;ll bite the bullet and buy it online. If you ever see a game called Poleconomy at a yard sale Donna, grab it. It&#39;s a Canadian one on politics and the economy and we had a blast with it as kids. If your son is really interested in politics, it&#39;s a good one. Of course, if you see two copies pick them both up and call me! :)<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like the opening scene in a science fiction movie... <br/>
&quot;Dad, there&#39;s someone in mom&#39;s pajamas and it&#39;s not mom!...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OH!  Little Red Riding Hood - doesn&#39;t the wolf eat grammy and disguise<br/>
himself in her jammies?  (kinky!)<br/>
<br/>
Or another kind of movie with flesh devouring wolves.  But I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
know about those.   <br/>
