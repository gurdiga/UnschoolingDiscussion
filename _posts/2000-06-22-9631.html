<div id="ygrps-yiv-129110397">Maybe some of you dog lovers on this list can help me out here.  I have never had a dog in my life, I have only had cats.  My husband is a dog persona dn his parents usually had half a dozen at any given time.  He would love to have a dog now, as would our boys.  Here is the problem.  Our older son, yes the one with all the allergies, is VERY allergic to dogs.  Is there a type of dog whose sliva/dander is less likely to give him a reaction?<br/>
<br/>
We have two cats, and he does fine with them.  They live in the house a lot but I do not allow them to sleep on the boys beds or go in their room, to prevent Thomas (allergy boy) from any possible problems with his asthma.  He does not have any issues with them that we have noticed, aside from occassional slight rashing if he hugs them to his face too much.  <br/>
<br/>
We would prefer a smaller breed of dog, and preferably one that does not bark a lot.  We have a small city lot and not a lot of space for a larger dog to run, but we have beautiful parks and lots of green spaces in our neighborhood.  Thomas (3 years) would go absolutely APE to have a dog of his own, and he has been begging me to get a &quot;spot dog&quot; for him.  With our cold winters, the dog would have to be in the house, at least part of the time, but I am getting rid of as much of the carpet as I can (I have asthma and severe dust allergies, Thomas has asthma and allergies, DH has allergies.)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

recommend them,they are too nervous.They are great dogs and very<br/>
affectionate and loyal.I happen to be partial to muts.Have had many dogs<br/>
in my life but the muts were the best in my opinion.I also find the<br/>
bigger dogs to be more tolerant to children.I am sure there are small<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a 2-year-old lab/chow mix named Lucy. My dh and I have always preferred large dogs, but we almost adopted a little cockapoo. I don&#39;t know if their dander would cause allergic reactions in your son, but from what I&#39;ve heard they shed very little and are excellent around children. Sorry I can&#39;t offer you anything more concrete, but we&#39;ve never had pet allergy problems.<br>

My stepmom is highly allergic to dogs, cats, you name it and she has a Wire <br/>
Haired Fox Terrier.   We have had three over time and she manages very well <br/>
with them.  They do not shed much and apparently dont have a lot of <br/>
troublesome dander.   They are slightly hyperactive dogs but if you find a <br/>
good breeder that shouldn&#39;t be a problem.  Wires (thats what my parents call <br/>
them) don&#39;t get very big either.  They are medium/small dogs and SOO cute.  <br/>
They also don&#39;t need a lot of space to release their energy as my moms dog <br/>
does just fine inside.  They live in Alaska so the dog can do well in cold <br/>
weather too.  Oh!  You could even call a Wire a &quot;spot dog&quot;  as they have <br/>
slightly spotty markings.   I hope this info helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804013673">Poodles have hair not fur and as I understand it, hair type dogs don&#39;t have<br/>
dog type dander, they have people type.  Any dog can be trained to be<br/>
quiet.  We had poodles (toys and minatures) and while other folks&#39; were<br/>
noisey, ours were (a kennel of 26) because they were trained from the get<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
The ones we had as pets were great and loved the kidlets.  They are<br/>
exceedingly easy to train and love to learn tricks.  Lover would drop dead<br/>
(sit up, tilt her head back and then flop over), Pepe would sing on cue,<br/>
Domino would do &quot;looks (are you serious, are you sad, are you happy).&quot; <br/>
You, however would need to carefully check the breeder as some folks have<br/>
only bred for color and size and forgotten that disposition can be included<br/>
in the package.<br/>
<br/>
Wire Haired breeds also don&#39;t shed and are real smart little cookies.<br/>
<br/>
Either type needs to be routinely groomed/clipped/stripped but there are<br/>
books on how to do this yourself and it isn&#39;t that hard.<br/>
<br/>
There are other breeds that are hair types.  If you do a web search for the<br/>
American Kennel Club they have a list of every breed that is recognized and<br/>
their characteristics and pictures.<br/>

&gt; Maybe some of you dog lovers on this list can help me out here.  I have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>never had a dog in my life, I have only had cats.  My husband is a dog<br/>
persona dn his parents usually had half a dozen at any given time.  He<br/>
would love to have a dog now, as would our boys.  Here is the problem.  Our<br/>
older son, yes the one with all the allergies, is VERY allergic to dogs. <br/>
Is there a type of dog whose sliva/dander is less likely to give him a<br/>
reaction?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; We have two cats, and he does fine with them.  They live in the house a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>lot but I do not allow them to sleep on the boys beds or go in their room,<br/>
to prevent Thomas (allergy boy) from any possible problems with his asthma.<br/>
 He does not have any issues with them that we have noticed, aside from<br/>
occassional slight rashing if he hugs them to his face too much.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; We would prefer a smaller breed of dog, and preferably one that does not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bark a lot.  We have a small city lot and not a lot of space for a larger<br/>
dog to run, but we have beautiful parks and lots of green spaces in our<br/>
neighborhood.  Thomas (3 years) would go absolutely APE to have a dog of<br/>
his own, and he has been begging me to get a &quot;spot dog&quot; for him.  With our<br/>
cold winters, the dog would have to be in the house, at least part of the<br/>
time, but I am getting rid of as much of the carpet as I can (I have asthma<br/>
and severe dust allergies, Thomas has asthma and allergies, DH has<br/>
allergies.)<br/>

I have heard poodles are good dogs for people with allergies.  They come<br/>
in sizes from toy to giant so you should be able to find a size that<br/>
suits you.  Don&#39;t get yucked out thinking they are prissy dogs; they were<br/>
originally bred as sporting dogs, hence some of the original haircuts for<br/>
&quot;swimabilty&quot;.  I have never owned one but those I know who have swear<br/>
they are wonderful dogs. Please find a reputable breeder in your area,<br/>
they can give you lots of information. Steer clear of the pet stores. <br/>
Good luck.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We just bought a puppy 2 months ago, an American Rat Terrier.<br/>
Short coat, small (10 lbs full grown) quiet, energetic, easy to train,<br/>
exceptionally bright and they get on well with other animals.<br/>
She is the old lady Dalmatian&#39;s bestest friend now. Mind you our Dally<br/>
had been bred twice and is really laid back as far as Dalmatians go.<br/>
<br/>
They also go by Rat Terrier or Teddy Roosevelt dogs. Roosevelt was a big<br/>
fan of the breed and was a breeder of the larger variety called a Decker<br/>
(16 lbs)<br/>
They have a great family tree with the old English White Terrier, Fox<br/>
Terrier, Italian Greyhound and Beagle in the mix.<br/>
<br/>
They kind of look like a smooth Fox Terrier/ Chihuahua cross.<br/>
They are a stay by your side dog and develop attachments to families<br/>
rather than individuals.<br/>
<br/>
You can find info/pictures of them on the internet by searching under<br/>
Rat Terrier.<br/>
