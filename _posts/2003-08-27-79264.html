&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Subject: #77 - It could save your life!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lauren was 19 yr. old and in college. This story takes place over the<br/>
&gt;Christmas/New Year&#39;s holiday break. It was the Saturday before New<br/>
&gt;Year&#39;s and it was about 1PM in the afternoon, and Lauren was driving<br/>
&gt;to visit a friend. An UNMARKED police car pulled up behind her and put<br/>
&gt;his lights on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Lauren&#39;s parents have 4 children (high school and college age) and<br/>
&gt;have always told them never to pull over for an unmarked car on the side<br/>
&gt;of the road, but rather wait until they get a gas station, etc., so<br/>
&gt;Lauren had actually listened to her parents advice, and promptly called #77<br/>
&gt;on her cell phone to tell the police dispatcher that she would not pull<br/>
&gt;over right away. She proceeded to tell the dispatcher that there was<br/>
&gt;an unmarked police car with a flashing red light on his rooftop behind<br/>
&gt;her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The dispatcher checked to see if there where police cars where she<br/>
&gt;was and there wasn&#39;t and he told her to keep driving, remain calm and<br/>
&gt;that he had back up already on the way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ten minutes later 4 cop cars surrounded her and the unmarked car<br/>
&gt;behind her. One policeman went to her side and the others surrounded the car<br/>
&gt;behind. They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the<br/>
&gt;ground.... the man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other<br/>
&gt;crimes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I never knew about the #77 Cell Phone Feature, but especially for a<br/>
&gt;woman alone in a car, you should not pull over for an unmarked car.<br/>
&gt;Apparently police have to respect your right to keep going to a<br/>
&gt;&quot;safe&quot; place. You obviously need to make some signals that you acknowledge<br/>
&gt;them (i.e. put on your hazard lights) or call #77 like Lauren did. Too bad<br/>
&gt;the cell phone companies don&#39;t give you this little bit of wonderful<br/>
&gt;information. So now it&#39;s your turn to let your friends know about<br/>
&gt;#77.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Send this to every woman you know, it may save their life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

In some U.S. states, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shopoakpark.com/info-cellnumbers.html&quot;">http://www.shopoakpark.com/info-cellnumbers.html&quot;</a>&gt;#77&lt;/A&gt; on a cell phone will immediately connect you to that <br/>
state&#39;s highway patrol, that code is not universal. Some states use #77, but <br/>
others use *55, *47, or *HP, and some don&#39;t have any special code at all. <br/>
Rather than frantically try to figure out which one will work in the area you&#39;re <br/>
in, get around the problem by going straight to 911. <br/>
