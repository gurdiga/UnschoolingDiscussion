<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572064729">We did a short ceremony, just Julian, Beth, and me, when Julian reached <br/>
puberty. We shared some of our wishes for him, ate cake, made him a dreamcatcher <br/>
together, and lit some candles. It wasn&#39;t too much, which would have embarassed <br/>
him. <br/>
<br/>
I had assumed I&#39;d do something with a daughter, but hadn&#39;t thought about <br/>
having a son. Then I realized it was silly, and we asked him what he thought. The <br/>
interesting thing is, that although he is close to his father and sees him <br/>
every day, Julian did not want him to be involved--just his lesbian moms.<br/>
