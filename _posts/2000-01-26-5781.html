<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044142195">Yes, Richland is one of the Tri-Cities, along with Pasco and Kennewick. <br/>
We also have three rivers!  The Yakima and Snake both dump into the<br/>
mighty Columbia here.<br/>
Does your sister home school?<br/>
I just heard about a new Mark Chagall (sp) exhibit at the Seattle<br/>
Children&#39;s Museum.  Have you checked it out?  Some friends of ours were<br/>
married this summer and used Chagall art in their invitations and<br/>
programs.  It was a somewhat non-traditional wedding.  One of the women<br/>
singing in the chorus was wearing a toddler in a sling!  I was impressed<br/>
by that.<br/>
