<br/>
Esther came up with the answer to a problem --life problem, not a written question---we were walking and talking and my dh said something and Esther answered, and said &quot;Yeah,  I learned that from half magic becuase everything  was doubled.* Truth is she is good at fractions anyway, but wow!  Learn without even knowing it!!!  What could be better?<br/>
<br/>
And did anyone ever think that this was also a great intro to the past?  Outdated...phweeeet...<br/>

  &gt; Rachel, Laurie read all of Edward Eager&#39;s books when she was young, <br/>
  &gt; and at age 22, she just read them again. It&#39;s one of the authors she <br/>
  &gt; always recommends to parents when they come into the bookstore <br/>
  &gt; looking for books their kids might enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
  And that got my kids interested in E. Nesbitt books (because Edward Eager <br/>
  mentions them in his books) and then PBS showed the WONDERFUL movie of &quot;The <br/>
  Railway Children&quot; -- it was lovely.<br/>
<br/>
  My oldest daughter was in school until 4th grade. Yet ANOTHER reason I <br/>
  started giving up on school was that her teacher couldn&#39;t get permission to <br/>
  have &quot;Half Magic&quot; be used in their supposedly &quot;Literature-Based Mathematics&quot; <br/>
  program. Half-Magic was not on the approved literature list for the State of <br/>
  California -- so she applied to have it added and it was turned down. The <br/>
  only explanation was that it was &quot;too old and outdated.&quot; She and I were both <br/>
  disgusted -- what kind of reason is THAT? Are they going to use that reason <br/>
  for eliminating all the great literature of the past? Yeah, right.<br/>
