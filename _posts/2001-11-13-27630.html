<div id="ygrps-yiv-228917412">I just thought I&#39;d share what  we do here. I&#39;m a single mom with a 3yo son <br/>
and I don&#39;t have to work. So I may have quite a bit more flexibility for <br/>
experimentation than some others on here, but here&#39;s what I&#39;ve been trying.<br/>
<br/>
Lately he&#39;s been watching a lot of tv again and I got weird about it again, <br/>
but rather than make hasty changes or try to revoke the complete freedom I <br/>
allowed &lt;g&gt; him, I read on the unschooling.com boards and looked at our <br/>
situation a bit more creatively.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve moved the child size play table from the dining room near all the craft <br/>
stuff into the living room in front of the tv. We were doing everything in <br/>
there anyway, it just made it more comfortable and acceptable in some way. <br/>
Luckily one of the chairs is missing the arms so my wonderfully womanly butt <br/>
fits there.:-) I don&#39;t limit tv at all: content, time, duration, etc. I have <br/>
been watching with him more than I used to. (Sometimes this is a real problem <br/>
for me. I don&#39;t enjoy watching things more than once or twice at most. And he <br/>
likes seeing things repeatedly. I always try to sit attentive through the <br/>
first viewing, but sometimes on the second, third and so on I have something <br/>
to do that comes second if he needs me.) He asks me a lot of questions now <br/>
about nearly everything on tv. The material things he&#39;s never seen before, <br/>
the personal interactions/dynamics/emotions between characters, the slang <br/>
terms/figures of speech, the new words, the different locations, different <br/>
occupations, etc. There have been times when he&#39;s asked me to turn things he <br/>
wanted to watch off because they upset him (scare, sadden, etc). <br/>
<br/>
I cringe when I see him light up at the toys and stuff that are advertised, <br/>
but I try to be honest and open with anything he brings up (or will let me <br/>
bring up!) I have learned a lot about advertising from living and research. <br/>
If and when I can I will share all that I know with him; but even at 3, I can <br/>
tell that he can see beyond some of it. I&#39;m leaning towards helping him be <br/>
more informed and equipped rather than shielded and protected. And of course, <br/>
always being there for shielding and protecting when it&#39;s needed/asked for.<br/>
<br/>
I bring the food in there, I bring crafts in there, sometimes he joins in and <br/>
sometimes he doesn&#39;t. When I&#39;m really buggin out about it, I make sure that <br/>
I&#39;m giving him plenty of opportunities to do cool stuff in and out of the <br/>
house. And if he still wants to watch tv, then he&#39;s deciding from a variety <br/>
of options and I know it&#39;s what he wants/needs.<br/>
<br/>
As someone suggested on one of the message boards, I try to make sure there <br/>
is plenty of time and props to recreate play from the stuff he watches. Like <br/>
toys from ads that I say, &quot;we could try to make that if you&#39;d like&quot; sometimes <br/>
yes, sometimes no. And on the intro to one of the movies we rented he saw an <br/>
ad for &#39;Cats&#39; and now we&#39;re going to try to make a cat costume. And a lot of <br/>
the stuff just naturally works into the free play around the house with toys <br/>
and props and stuff. He can recreate what he sees, adjust it, change it, <br/>
intensify it......play around with a new concept in his own creative way. <br/>
<br/>
Tv is stimulating lots of interests and conversation and learning. And <br/>
sometimes I still think, &quot;Geez, he&#39;s like a zombie! I&#39;m an awful mom, what <br/>
would people say?&quot; But I&#39;m trying to separate my need to fit in from my <br/>
desire to parent the best way I can. And also reading all the technical, <br/>
intelligent articles on here about how great tv watching is really helps me.<br/>
<br/>
So....ramble ramble ramble....that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing now. Writing this has <br/>
been great for me, lol, I think we&#39;re doing better than I thought we were!<br/>
