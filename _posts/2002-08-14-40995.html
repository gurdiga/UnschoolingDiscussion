 </span></blockquote>Right, Tuck. I meant only that he had learned to do well what he chose to<br/>
do. The scores mean little to him, but indicated to me that he was following<br/>
through on his choice. Any level of grades that he would be happy with would<br/>
have done it for us, too.<br/>
<br/>
I threw in the 2% for people who can&#39;t imagine that a person who never went<br/>
to school or looked at school books could be a successful college student if<br/>
he wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
I went to private school for 13 years, and at college, I was never on the<br/>
dean&#39;s list and disliked most of the classes I was in. Therefore, it<br/>
astonished me that he was so good at it and enjoyed it, after virtually no<br/>
preparation.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we think he is all those good things too that you mentioned.<br/>
