 </span></blockquote>Hey Nancy, you have me cracking up, I am ultra nosey, so I don&#39;t mind you <br/>
asking at all!<br/>
<br/>
When I got pregnant with Kass and Kree I began lactating about 4 weeks into <br/>
my pregnancy. I had never known anyone else that had that happen. We were <br/>
waking up in large puddles all night. It was awful. The further I got, the worse it <br/>
got. I had to wear breastpads but my second month, not trimester, month. All <br/>
day I would leak. Then the pain began. It was excruciating and never got <br/>
better. By the time the twins were due, I hadn&#39;t slept in months for more than <br/>
10-15 minute intervals. I cried in pain when I took a shower, from the beginning <br/>
to the end and for months after their birth.<br/>
<br/>
I knew the entire time I would not be breastfeeding as just the thought <br/>
horrified me, because the pain was so excrutiating during my pregnancy, I couldn&#39;t <br/>
fathom letting them latch on. Then when they got here, I cried at not even <br/>
feeling the need to try, if that makes sense. When the nurse came in to ask if I <br/>
would like to give it a shot, I asked her if she was high! <br/>
<br/>
Although I won&#39;t go into all the things they experimented with trying to get <br/>
my milk to stop, I will say even the doctors didn&#39;t know what else to try to <br/>
make me stop or &quot;dry up&quot;. So for the first few months of their lives I could <br/>
hardly be touched anywhere near my chest. But I guess since the pain was so bad, <br/>
I didn&#39;t feel like I had lost out in any way, because here I had 2 perfect <br/>
babies, gone full term and they were so healthy they tried to send the babies <br/>
home without me! Here they were, six and a half pounds each. I had gained 64 <br/>
pounds total and the day after they were born I&#39;d lost 58. I was very sick, and <br/>
was not discharged. I left when they discharged the twins and told me I had to <br/>
stay. I just couldn&#39;t believe that after all I had gone through to get them to <br/>
Earth, they wanted to ship them home with Phil and keep me. So I left and <br/>
Phil and my mom took care of me and the twins. They had to call my OB every 2 <br/>
hours since I left while being under doctors orders to stay. No one was too happy <br/>
with me, but my babies and I knew I wasn&#39;t leaving them for a minute!<br/>
<br/>
My pregnancy was full of trauma and the leaking was just a part of it. <br/>
Everything worked out and it was definately predestined that I got two in one shot, <br/>
cuz I&#39;d never do it again. I kept waiting to get that &quot;glow&quot; everyone talks <br/>
about, huh, never happened here! I guess maybe that was more than you asked for, <br/>
but I tend to ramble, if you haven&#39;t guessed ;-). I&#39;ll stop before I go too <br/>
far, hehehehehe.<br/>

I am so sorry you had such a bad experience! I started lactating early too, <br/>
not four weeks into my pregnancy, it was around the third month for me. I <br/>
wonder if it is a twin thing, since Moly was a twin, but we didn&#39;t know it until <br/>
after she was born. I had given up on the nursing pads by the time she was born, <br/>
I used teen sized maxi pads! They stuck better to my bra and absorbed more <br/>
too. I didn&#39;t experience that much pain either! I can&#39;t imagine and feel for <br/>
you. I nursed for so long, I still have some milk! Jack stopped nursing on a <br/>
regular basis around three and kept with the comfort nursing until sometime in his <br/>
fifth year. It was so gradual, I don&#39;t even remember when the last time I <br/>
nursed was. He would go weeks and not nurse then nurse for a time, then go months <br/>
then nurse and then one day I realized it had been more than months! I still <br/>
really miss it. Sometimes I will hear a baby cry and I experience a small let <br/>
down. This thread has me thinking about it so much that I had a let down <br/>
earlier and didn&#39;t notice until Darin asked if I had spilled something! He can be <br/>
such a clown sometimes, he knew what it was! *jerk* &lt;g&gt; I told him it was just <br/>
my body&#39;s way of telling him I was ready for another. &lt;g&gt; *my turn*<br/>
<br/>

He felt that his whole life was some kind of dream and he sometimes wondered <br/>
whose it was and whether they were enjoying it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LMAO!!! Me too!, I was going through breastpads so fast. I found some thin <br/>
maxi&#39;s, that fit my bra perfectly. They weren&#39;t teen one though, I don&#39;t think <br/>
those were out then. I mean specifically designated &quot;Teen&quot; pads. Funny how odd <br/>
things age us. We  had the most awesome bottle sanitizer back then and seeing <br/>
as we made about 30 bottles a day, it came in so handy. But I haven&#39;t seen it <br/>
around in baby aisles these days. It was a gift, so maybe it was a specialty <br/>
item, but I remember it being awesome and helpful. We didn&#39;t use it all the <br/>
time, just those occasions that we needed a quick bottle and didn&#39;t have time to <br/>
do the whole sanitization process. People used to laugh when they came to our <br/>
house and went to the fridge for something to drink. Kind of like a frat <br/>
house, but instead of beer, it was shelves and shelves of baby bottles. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>OOOps, I meant to comment on how lucky you were not to have the pain. Instead <br/>
it looked like I was taking back my earlier pain statement. I wish that part <br/>
were true though, unfortunately I was only LOL about the pads.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, maybe that&#39;s why I should be in bed right now.<br/>
