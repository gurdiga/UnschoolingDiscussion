I hated that!  I think *blue* law came from the same place as *blue <br/>
light* district or something.  Things that were/are forbidden are called <br/>
*blue*.  Someone please correct me if I&#39;m wrong here.  :-)<br/>

Elissa, who doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to state an opinion in an inflammatory<br/>
manner and then state that one doesn&#39;t want a debate over the topic<br/>
(different thread)</div>

my Mom calling it a blue light district when I was a kid.  But,<br/>
it could very well be she was getting all confused with KMart&#39;s<br/>
blue light special too!! LOL!!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I remember the &quot;Blue Law&quot; that used to be in some parts of NJ.  I remember in Somerville, NJ, on Sundays you couldn&#39;t but clothes.  I was very young then, so other items might have been restricted, but  I don&#39;t remember.  I do remember that you could go into the stores.  For example, Woolworth&#39;s would be open, but the clothing section would be &#39;roped off&#39;.  Funny how certain words, or phrases, conjure up childhood memories.  (As do certain &#39;smells&#39;)  Just my 2 cents.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What town in NJ were you from?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I lived in Emerson.  It&#39;s about 5 to 10 min north of Paramus.<br/>
It seems that nowadays, the Blue Law is only in Bergen County.  <br/>
So, on Sundays, if people want to go shopping for anything <br/>
except food or gas, they need to go outside of the county. <br/>
Hubby and I spent many Sundays at the mall in Nanuet, NY <br/>
and in Clifton, NJ for that very reason.  There&#39;s an awesome<br/>
children&#39;s clothing store in Clifton called the Childrenswear <br/>
Centre that sells brand name clothes at up to 80% off of <br/>
department store prices. I got lots of my girls clothing there!  <br/>
However, I&#39;m looking at the website now and it seems the <br/>
Clifton store may have moved.  Here&#39;s the link if anyone is <br/>
interested,,,, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.netkidswear.com/chilcennet.html">http://www.netkidswear.com/chilcennet.html</a><br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t buy anything that isn&#39;t food or gas.  They do let you buy<br/>
things like toilet paper, paper towels, diapers and tampons though,<br/>
thank goodness!!  But, nothing *unnecessary* like greeting cards,<br/>
wrapping paper, books, crayons, batteries, etc,,,  If a store has <br/>
food AND those goods,,,,the goods affected by the Blue Law are<br/>
roped off.  However, if a store has NO food at all,,,the entire store<br/>
is closed (like ToysRUs, Hallmark,,,ALL shopping malls, etc,,,) <br/>
Movie theaters remain open however.<br/>
<br/>
While I was there, there was this one article in the newspaper <br/>
about how ToysRUs wanted their internet sales and marketing <br/>
team who handled internet orders to be able to work on Sundays<br/>
(because people BUY things over the internet on Sundays from<br/>
all over the world and these people needed to be able to keep<br/>
track of inventory and such).  Bergen County said NO way even <br/>
though they were in an office that wasn&#39;t even in the ToysRUs <br/>
toy store!!  <br/>
<br/>
So, it seems all businesses not selling food or gas had to be <br/>
closed on Sundays too.<br/>
<br/>
It was VERY inconvenient for most of my husband&#39;s family to<br/>
do any shopping at all since they all ran drycleaners that were<br/>
open 7 to 7, Monday through Saturday.  Thus, leaving only<br/>
Sunday for shopping,,,,,and of course, they couldn&#39;t go shopping<br/>
on Sundays either because that was the day for GOLF!!  (my <br/>
in-laws are all Korean and all Koreans *I&#39;ve* EVER met are <br/>
addicted to Golf)  :-)<br/>
