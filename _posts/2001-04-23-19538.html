&lt;&lt;  Sometimes though I would like to be married to a carpenter who builds <br/>
 lovely furniture or a chiropractor or massage therapist.<br/>

he will soon take over the company he is a partner in. And my mother didn&#39;t <br/>
think he would be able to support me. <br/>
<br/>
    Also my father is a chiropractor and I am  certified in Meridian massage. <br/>
I do not practice though I am an off the scale introvert. ;o)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sorry Mac users. I really don&#39;t know what he means by<br/>
 that. I assume there&#39;s a mac/pc war going on at work.<br/>

    That was funny, and the part about bottle testing.<br/>

     I wish one of us knew more about computers but neither of us is that <br/>
interested in knowing more than we do. Unschooling.<br/>
