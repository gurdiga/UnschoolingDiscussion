<div id="ygrps-yiv-253729639"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">My 7 year old has been going through the same thing. A homeschooling friend 
<br>of his decided to go to school after the holiday break, so I knew where the 
<br>idea came from. We went to look at the public school nearby. He left saying 
<br>that he thought he would like to go. Fortunately, we have a homeschooling 
<br>theater group in our area, and my son was very interested in being in the 
<br>next play. Auditions were the day after we looked at the school, so my son 
<br>said he wanted to audition first and then he would decide. He got a part in 
<br>the play, and decided that he wanted to be in the play more. (good timing!) 
<br>It was extremely hard for me to take him to look at the school. However, 
<br>knowing my son, if I hadn&#39;t allowed him to decide, I would have never heard 
<br>the end of it. If he had decided to attend the school, I would have let him 
<br>go. I know alot of homeschooled children who go to school one year, stay home 
<br>the next. I think it is important to listen to our kids. If I hadn&#39;t given 
<br>control of this decision to my son, we would probably still be talking about 
<br>it.
