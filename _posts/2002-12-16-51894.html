&lt;&lt; Then I stopped and thought a few seconds more and realized that it&#39;s not<br/>
so much the *institution* of school but the *practice* of testing and<br/>
quantifying that REALLY discourages thinking. &gt;&gt;<br/>

and wanted to know something and the &quot;answer&quot; to my legitimate, real question <br/>
was &quot;That&#39;s not going to be on the test.&quot;<br/>

Way ironic!  In college the professors hated it when the only question<br/>
they could get from the class is &quot;Is this going to be on the test?&quot;<br/>
