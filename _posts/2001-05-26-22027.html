<br/>
Kiwis don&#39;t fly because their wings aren&#39;t strong enough<br/>
Ostriches can&#39;t fly either<br/>
Ostriches come from Africa<br/>
Kingfishers catch fish, but they eat lizards too<br/>
Baby birds stay in their eggs until they grow big enough<br/>
Eggs look all different, some have pretty spots on them<br/>
Baby gulls are pretty, white and fluffy<br/>
Terns make their nests in the sand<br/>
Water birds have webbed feet<br/>
Swallows go to a warmer continent in the winter<br/>
<br/>
And on and on. Maybe just maybe we could pull this off too.<br/>
