<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593635673">Welcome to Nancy and Rachel!  This really is a neat list and pretty <br/>
active lately!  Hope you enjoy it!<br/>
<br/>
Rachel, it sounded like for most of your post that you are an <br/>
unschooler at heart and that your children are too.  In our <br/>
home, &quot;curriculum&quot; consists of what the kids want.  We do have <br/>
workbooks, but those are ones the kids have asked for and are done <br/>
when they want to do them.  I do have panic attacks every so often <br/>
about where they are, but when that comes up, it is clear to me and <br/>
the kids that they are exactly where they &quot;should&quot; be.  That means <br/>
they are all over the spectrum in their academic, artistic, social, <br/>
etc. skills, and, as individuals, we believe that is where we all are <br/>
and need to be.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion of more deschooling seems like sound advice.  <br/>
Sometimes it is very difficult to let go of what we were taught or <br/>
what we see means so much to other people.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to have you both!<br/>
<br/>

<div><font face="Tempus Sans ITC" size="4">I hope you enjoy your new home as much 
as I do mine. As for the Pyrenees dogs, they are wonderful animals. Very 
peaceful and calm. They do go through a barking stage that can be very annoying 
if you don&#39;t have space for them. They are wonderful with children. It is 
refreshing to find someone with similar pursuits. I get funny looks when I tell 
some peole about our lifestyle choices. Is cheese making difficult? It&#39;s funny 
you mention it, because&nbsp;I have been thinking about learning. does your 
oldest daughter have plans for college in her future? I have a 16 year old and 
she has a lot of confusion to what she wants to do.&nbsp;</font></div>

 Anyway, I think we&#39;ll have a lot of fun together as we deschool over the <br/>
summer and turn next fall into a new summer time!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Year round summer vacation, that&#39;s a good way to get the hang of unschooling!!<br/>
Welcome.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
