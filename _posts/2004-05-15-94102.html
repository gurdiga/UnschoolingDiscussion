	That depends.  Are they Kripsy Kremes?<br/>

Seriously, I think if it&#39;s a good resource, then you take what you can use<br/>
and pass it on.  If it&#39;s lousy, or boring or harmfull then I wouldn&#39;t touch<br/>
it or even want to pass it on &quot;free&quot; to someone else.<br/>

Feeling hungry and just a bit silly,<br/>
