I may have opportunity to work in Germany - you noted that homeschooling is illegal in Germany - are you legal because you are an American citizen - or because you are military.  I was just curious, because this will be a deciding factor for me. If I am an ordinary working person - but an American, am I allowed to homeschool/unschool while living there?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info :)<br/>

<br/>
  &gt; So my solution is NEVER LET THEM PLAY WITH THE NEIGHBORS.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; &lt;LOL!&gt;  <br/>
  &gt; Not really, but sometimes I think the get more harm than good from playing<br/>
  &gt; with some kids.<br/>
<br/>
  Please go on, Sandra.<br/>
  How DO people cope with this?  Avoiding the neighbors isn&#39;t an option for<br/>
  us.  We live in Army housing, 18 apartments to a building, 26 buildings in<br/>
  the complex.  There are 23 children in my building, 21 of whom are 6 and<br/>
  under.  It&#39;s a zoo.  (BTW, my son is almost 6)<br/>
<br/>
  I can&#39;t schedule my son to only play with unschoolers; I haven&#39;t met any in<br/>
  Germany yet.  I can&#39;t even just play with homeschoolers; there are only<br/>
  about 10-15 families in the 1-hour radius that our homeschool support group<br/>
  covers.  I believe all are school-at-home (I keep my mouth shut!).  And, the<br/>
  only folks we see most days are military; my German is weak, and<br/>
  homeschooling is illegal in Germany, anyhow.<br/>
<br/>
  My son only likes to play with a few of the kids in the building, but they<br/>
  create real problems sometimes.  I know they&#39;re constantly after my son<br/>
  about why he doesn&#39;t go to school, why he reads so much, why he&#39;s so wierd<br/>
  (he&#39;s very quiet, and doesn&#39;t often do what &quot;everybody&quot; is doing), etc.  We<br/>
  reap problems from this often in the form of nightmares.  I keep him at home<br/>
  a fair bit, and schedule activities out when possible (the Army doesn&#39;t<br/>
  offer us much, and it&#39;s usually with the same kids.).  But I also worry the<br/>
  child has to have friends!<br/>
<br/>
  Ideas, anybody?  I have to go home in a month or so, and deal with it again!<br/>
  &lt;sigh&gt;   <br/>
