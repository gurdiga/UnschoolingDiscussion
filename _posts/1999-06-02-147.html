Hmmmmm Kim, you have inspired fear in me.  Shades of Big Brother?  Maybe<br/>
this will say it better:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OK kids Hold it right there!!&quot;  The deafening voice issued from the<br/>
crackling loud speaker on top of the patrol car.  &quot;Just line up against the<br/>
curb, and nobody gets hurt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The children did as they were told, fearfully.  Little Susie fingered the<br/>
bright laminated yellow badge that hung around her neck, with a Scarlet<br/>
Letter H stamped on the middle and her picture and identification number<br/>
below.  Mommy had given it to her after she lost her identification card<br/>
and could not leave the house for two weeks until the county issued her a<br/>
new one.  <br/>
<br/>
Timothy reached into his wallet to retrieve his yellow ID card with the<br/>
same red H on the front, next to his picture and number.  Billy, however<br/>
was sweating bullets, and frantically searching his pockets for his card.<br/>
&#39;I know I had it in this jacket yesterday&#39; he thought, as panic began to<br/>
rise like bile in his throat.<br/>
<br/>
The Truency Police Officers pulled up to the curb next to them and the<br/>
children could hear one muttering to the other &quot;Another pack of those<br/>
ignorant little Homeys again...&quot; before he turned towards the open window<br/>
and addressed the children.  &quot;All right, lets see some ID!  What&#39;s the<br/>
matter with you?  Got bugs down your pants?&quot; he said to Billy.<br/>
<br/>
Billy was patting himself down, checking and rechecking pockets, fearfully<br/>
glancing at the TPOs as emotion clenched tightly in his throat and tears<br/>
began welling in his eyes.  &#39;Please, please, please.....I HAS to be in this<br/>
jacket!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone had heard the stories about the Assesment Center where they take<br/>
kids who are caught outside during school hours without ID.  Cheryl Smith<br/>
had told Billy that she knew a kid who had been picked up by the TPOs, and<br/>
she had gone into gory detail about the battery of tests the children must<br/>
submit to, and the tests that parents must take, and fines they must pay,<br/>
before their children will be released to them.  <br/>
<br/>
By this time the TPO in the passenger seat of the patrol car had gotten out<br/>
and was making his way around the front of the car toward the children.<br/>
&quot;OK, Kids, you know the drill.&quot; he said.<br/>
Timothy took Susie&#39;s hand as he walked toward the front end of the car,<br/>
glancing worriedly at Billy, who followed still searching his clothes with<br/>
a growing look of desperation on his face.    <br/>
<br/>
The TPO met them at the front of the car and said &quot;Spread em.&quot;  Timothy let<br/>
go of Susie&#39;s hand and they both leaned forward and placed their hands,<br/>
wide apart and palms down, on the front of the car and spread their feet<br/>
about shoulder width apart.  Susie had to put her hands on the front<br/>
bumper, as that was as far as she could reach and the TPO had to stoop to<br/>
one knee to check her for weapons or illegal substances.  These two are<br/>
clean.&quot; he said to his parter, now standing next to him.  &quot;No weapons, gum,<br/>
caffienated substances or other illegals.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
When it came Billy&#39;s turn, he was shaking and crying in fear as the TPO<br/>
patted him down.  &quot;What&#39;s this?&quot; he said when he felt something in Billy&#39;s<br/>
back pocket.  He pulled out Billy&#39;s yellow ID card as Billy ventured a<br/>
nervous glance at him.  &quot;It was in my pocket!?&quot; Billy shouted, forgetting<br/>
himself.  The TPO scowled and Billy fell silent, as waves of relief washed<br/>
over him and he closed his eyes to say an incoherent silent prayer of thanks.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, finish your business outside, and stay off the streets until after 3<br/>
PM.&quot; the TPO driving the patrol car called to them gruffly as they drove<br/>
off a few minutes later.  Timothy looked at Susie, who&#39;s face was blank and<br/>
unreadable as she watched them drive out of sight.  The he ventured a look<br/>
in Billy&#39;s direction as he collapsed against the curb, his legs folding<br/>
under him.  He laughed nervously as he repeated &quot;In my pocket the whole<br/>
time.  In my pocket...&quot;  His hands were shaking with adrenline release.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m getting you a wallet for your birthday, Billy.&quot; Timothy said as he<br/>
reached out to help him rise.  &quot;Come on, let&#39;s go home.&quot;<br/>

I am from Pittsburgh and never heard this story.  While I do see truancy <br/>
officers driving around in their cars, I have never heard of any homeschooler <br/>
having a problem.  People don&#39;t tend to let their kids roam the streets of <br/>
the city all by themselves.  I would imagine that most homeschoolers are on <br/>
their own streets and/or being driven to some activity.  There is no such <br/>
thing as proof that you are a homeschooler unless of course you carry your <br/>
parents signed affidavit that they had to send in to the school district.  <br/>
Some kids fall under the private tutor act if they have parents or some other <br/>
close relative who is a certified teacher in the state and they would not <br/>
have such an affidavit.  I question whether this story is actually true.  I <br/>
thought it was made up to illustrate a point.  I also have never heard of the <br/>
fine for a curfew.  I don&#39;t think we have one.  I&#39;ll have to check that out.  <br/>
I have a friend who is an editor for one of the newspapers and she is a <br/>
homeschooler.  I&#39;ll call and ask her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey everybody,<br/>
Here is the &#39;dish.&#39;  When I got Kim&#39;s email talking about daytime curfews<br/>
it reminded me of Nazi politics, as well as the novel 1984.  So I composed<br/>
a short story on the spot to sum up the fears that the curfew laws had<br/>
summoned in me.  When Kim wrote to say that the story was &quot;true&quot; I believe<br/>
she meant in the sense that there were existing curfew laws that she had<br/>
discovered, not that this particular scenario was the personal history of<br/>
real children.  I picked the names out of thin air, my kids are named<br/>
Alexander and Thomas, and are far too young to even go in the yard by<br/>
themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
I also wasn&#39;t thinking of kids on a big city street.  More along the lines<br/>
of a town the size of ours, with kids maybe walking to the park or corner<br/>
store a few blocks from their house (we have both) on quiet residential<br/>
streets.  However, when I WAS a ps kid growing up in the city, I would walk<br/>
to the corner store; two blocks to the beach; take the public bus to and<br/>
from school with my brother starting when we were 6 and 7; and in general<br/>
run around with my friends.  Maybe people who let the ps system raise their<br/>
kids let them do more on their own, because they get into the mentality<br/>
that their children don&#39;t need them.  I don&#39;t know, just my personal<br/>
experience.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420237677">When Kim wrote to say that the story was &quot;true&quot; I believe<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she meant in the sense that there were existing curfew laws that she had<br/>
&gt; discovered.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, that&#39;s exactly what I meant and I&#39;m sorry if I confused anyone.  You<br/>
wrote a beautiful story that may be a harbringer of things to come but it<br/>
was the news story I was referring to as real.  I really did not know that I<br/>
was confusing anyone and I&#39;m sorry if I did.<br/>
