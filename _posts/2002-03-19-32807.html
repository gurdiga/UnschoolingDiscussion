<div id="ygrps-yiv-534979525">(For example, if an older child decided to take music lessons, which we<br/>
pay for.  What if<br/>
this child does not want to go consistently? Do we let them skip lessons<br/>
or do we<br/>
&quot;require&quot; that they meet this obligation of theirs?)<br/>
Josefa,<br/>
that question has arisen in my household.  My husband thinks because the<br/>
buck stops here, with him, that my son has no say in how he wrestles. <br/>
But I say, talk with the child and come to a solution.  Find out why he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to go and go from there.  I talked with my son and found out<br/>
it was the matches that were boring him, not the mat club.  The matches<br/>
were against an opponent who was either far superior or far inferior, so<br/>
he felt they taught him nothing.  So, we (he and I) came to an agreement<br/>
that he would go to mat club, but pick and choose which matches to attend<br/>
and let us know a week ahead of time.  But my husband said, because of my<br/>
son&#39;s irresponsible behavior by calling it off at the last minute that<br/>
just proves he is just a kid and that it is Dad&#39;s job to decide for him. <br/>
I was miffed at this and the next day my husband got an earful of what I<br/>
thought of his listening skills.  So far, my son still goes and the<br/>
subject hasn&#39;t been brought up again, since my son decided to go along to<br/>
get along:(<br/>
