<div id="ygrps-yiv-721092582">Hahah, these sure take me back. I still get Miss Priss from tons of people, <br/>
Priss Pants was a standard as a child, and Priscilla Gorilla was a favorite <br/>
of lots of my peers. There are times I don&#39;t thank my parents for this name <br/>
:) (Actually I&#39;m pretty fond of it now, notwithstanding the <br/>
nicknames...especially since my marriage. Priscilla Adams has a lovely <br/>
Mayflowerish ring to it)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;I see that, but it is not the case with us. Nicknames are not labels <br/>
unless used as such. Just because you call someone &quot;sweetie&quot; doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that they are always sweet, does it? It&#39;s just a nice, friendly, nickname. <br/>
Ugh, and I said I wouldn&#39;t say anything else on this subject!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there is anything wrong with nicknames except for the fact of <br/>
what they are. We call the kids things like munchkin, punkin and meepy. <br/>
Things that have no real meaning except sounding cute or coming to mind. Not <br/>
hurtful in my eyes or anyone else&#39;s. Would anyone here resent being called a <br/>
punkin? Okay wait, maybe if you are very large and wearing an orange <br/>
outfit.....but then I wouldn&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
The point is, what can label and become true. I remember when my godfather <br/>
was dying and in a home. The guy across the hall would yell constantly, <br/>
couldn&#39;t make out what he was saying, just yelling. Someone made the remark <br/>
to my godfather that it was annoying but he must be use to it. My godfather <br/>
said, &quot;If you hang long enough, you get use to that too!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always remember that for a lot of things in daily life. Think the child <br/>
will lie all the time and they will. Think they are losers and they will be. <br/>
They are labels that can ring true.<br/>
<br/>
Calling a kid a sweetie pie can&#39;t actually make them a sweetie pie, or a <br/>
punkin, or a nut. It&#39;s an expression that generally pops up with no intent <br/>
to hurt and I don&#39;t think it does. But things that can come true, even <br/>
without the intent to hurt, still will. Like chubby, lazy, shy or <br/>
hyperactive.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like this post is as clear as mud as to what I wanted to say. I <br/>
started out with it all nice in my head. I&#39;m not sure if it came out that <br/>
way!!!<br/>

<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>
<time> 9 Oct 2002, at 12:15pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880801408">I&#39;m hopelessly behind on e-mail, courtesy of the Army&#39;s ever<br/>
changing moving plans being blown out to sea with the last<br/>
hurricane and a sudden up-tick in either language arts or cuddle<br/>
time, AKA &quot;Mom, can we read all of a different book by Dahl every<br/>
day for a while&quot; ... but the nickname debate just caught my eye<br/>
and is an easy one to get down.  Our son is permanently and<br/>
hopelessly Urchin - and IRL we have caught some grief over that.<br/>
<br/>
BBBBBUUUUTTTT - there is a story!!!<br/>
<br/>
15 or so years ago we were at a reenactment, camping with about 6<br/>
or 7 other compatible families.  The kids were in the 5-12 age<br/>
range, big enough to be allowed to stay up at the campfire when<br/>
the adults were ready to lie down.  And we did and they did.  Our<br/>
family had done the Riddle of the Sphinx in the car on the way<br/>
down; the kids decided to create an &quot;Ages of Kids&quot; replica.  I<br/>
heard bits and pieces as I drifted off and got the full taxonomy<br/>
the next day, the features, milestones, and purposes of each age.<br/>
The Urch was almost 9, a &quot;chilford&quot; according to their labels.<br/>
The next and very desirable stage of childhood was to become an<br/>
Urchin, starting at about age 10.  At about 10, these young<br/>
philosophers decided a reasonably well raised child could survive<br/>
on his own, as in become a street urchin successfully, if they so<br/>
desired.  He very much wanted to reach that exalted status of<br/>
self sufficiency, without regard to how realistic the assessment<br/>
was.  He stuck with that desire for the next 14 months, with all<br/>
kinds of effort into learning the ways of taking care of<br/>
yourself.<br/>
<br/>
When he turned 10, I made him a certificate congratulating him on<br/>
becoming an Urchin.  He was pleased as punch, and insisted that<br/>
we call him Urchin.  The fact that his given name is an old<br/>
family one that is not susceptible to good shortening as a<br/>
nickname may have colored the request.  Nonetheless his nickname<br/>
of Urchin or The Urch stands as a comfortable example of our own<br/>
family reality, however at odds it may be with what a dictionary<br/>
would indicate the meaning would be.<br/>
<br/>
....none of which expresses any view on whether a particular<br/>
nickname or label in another particular context may or may not<br/>
reflect unstated negative opinions or unintentionally damaging<br/>
images.  For us, one that most would find inappropriate is in<br/>
fact a joyous inside joke.<br/>
<br/>
...OK lots of tougher or more thoughtful ones to write, but the 6<br/>
wants to search for movies based on Dahl books, beyond Willie<br/>
Wonka.  I&#39;m gonna go fiddle with the pumpernickel dough and see<br/>
how far she gets before she needs help.  My observation is that<br/>
she gets a lot further if I&#39;m not too close, more willing to make<br/>
mistakes and go down blind alleys.  I swear that I don&#39;t correct<br/>
her errors unless she asks me to, I really don&#39;t; I really don&#39;t;<br/>
I really don&#39;t - do I?<br/>

that words that sound bad or ugly or mean to others are not the best <br/>
nick names to give our children. Duh.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it should be in the manual? You know the manual that should come <br/>
with children when they are born but doesn&#39;t so they are stuck with us <br/>
and our poor pitiful attempts to treat them right based on our own <br/>
less than wonderful experiences in life?<br/>
<br/>
Why not nickname a little one Respected? That would be a new one <br/>
wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I certainly hope my son&#39;s nickname won&#39;t &quot;come true&quot;; he&#39;s been my bunny-boy<br/>
since he was a baby!  &lt;g&gt;   I think that this is a touchy issue for peole.<br/>
Sandra noted that she calls her daughter by her name, Holly.  Not everyone<br/>
goes for nicknames.  That&#39;s fair.<br/>
<br/>
Mary B. wrote the above.  I have issues with punkin, which didn&#39;t sound<br/>
hurtful to her.  To me, it means little punk, and I never liked being called<br/>
a punk as a child.  I didn&#39;t even like being called a kid (those are baby<br/>
goats!).  But those are MY issues, not Mary&#39;s.  She&#39;s welcome to call her<br/>
kids punkin if she likes!<br/>
<br/>
What seriously bothers one person doesn&#39;t faze someone else.  It&#39;s possible<br/>
that Myranda might later want to rethink her nicknames, based on some<br/>
people&#39;s comments.  But as she said, she&#39;s happy to stop if her son ever<br/>
lets her know he&#39;d like her to.  To me, that&#39;s the issue.  Sandra&#39;s mom<br/>
calling her sister a cow obvioulsy wasn&#39;t appreciated.  If her sister<br/>
laughed and said, &quot;Moo, moo&quot; back to their Mom, it would be a whole<br/>
different story.  But if she asked her to stop and she didn&#39;t, that shows a<br/>
basic lack of respect.  I think a big piece of unschooling is that we treat<br/>
our children (and everyone else, too) with respect.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I&#39;m outa here tomorrow for a couple days!  Wish I was joining<br/>
all the conference goers, but I&#39;m heading to Leipzig.  It&#39;s a lot closer,<br/>
for me at least!  Have fun in S.C.!<br/>

<br/>
Just to clarify, which doesn&#39;t take away what Brenda is saying her feeling <br/>
about punk is. My dad always called me pumpkin but said it like punkin even <br/>
though he meant the other. He would write it that way too. It never bothered <br/>
me, what&#39;s so bad about being a pumpkin? And even though sometimes he did <br/>
say punk, I knew I wasn&#39;t a punk but a punkin! It just stuck with me and my <br/>
kids. Now if I was always called a punk with no understanding of the other, <br/>
that would have bothered me too.<br/>

He&#39;s got the brightest red-orange hair you&#39;d ever want to see, which is of<br/>

With Halloween coming, Tim&#39;s red hair reminded me of one year when Tim was<br/>
very small.  I have brown hair.  My dh has very little hair (due to the army<br/>
haircut and also just plain due to the army!).  People constantly ask where<br/>
Tim got his red hair.  Genetics, I guess.  Nobody we know has that color<br/>
hair, in or out of the family.  Anyway, for Halloween that year I sprayed my<br/>
hair the most obnoxious shade of orange I could find.  Many people didn&#39;t<br/>
get it, but my friends laughed and laughed and laughed.<br/>

This is great!!  I always wanted a red headed child, but didn&#39;t get one.  Lots of red hair in our family,  but I&#39;m just a brunette.  Maybe I&#39;ll color my hair red with a washable color just to see what it looks like?  <br/>
Gee what a thought,  not like anyone on this list has ever colored their hair &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597692926">Hi Rachel Ann,<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll give it a try,  I have just stopped coloring it to cover gray, so I could go with something different than my natural gray streaks.  Although I&#39;m feeling rather comfortable right now with my graying hair.     This has been a growing (emotional) thing to let my hair go, I started graying right after college.<br/>
Rachel, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever told you how I enjoy your posts,  right from the beginning when you were talking about your cooking.  I have always loved hearing about Jewish customs and traditions, so interesting, I&#39;m a bit jealous.<br/>
