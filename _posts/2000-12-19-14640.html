<div id="ygrps-yiv-1158029016">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am coming in on this thread rather late, I know. And I would like <br/>
to offer something which may be very unpopular here (as it was on a <br/>
couple of other lists): actually it&#39;s two sources I want to mention - <br/>
one is Aletha Solter and her books &quot;The Aware Baby&quot; and &quot;Tears and <br/>
Tantrums&quot;, the other is Martha Welch and her book &quot;Holding Time&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I am not interested in starting a major debate about the &quot;dangers of <br/>
holing therapy&quot; and on and on and on..... been there already.<br/>
<br/>
I just think that you might want to check these books out, Amy, and <br/>
decide for yourself if this might work for you.<br/>
<br/>
Aletha Solter says that even young babies experience stress, toddlers <br/>
even more so. I don&#39;t think we can argue that point. She goes on to <br/>
say, however, and this is where some people cringe, that <br/>
babies/toddlers/children need to be allowed to cry and rage to <br/>
release these stresses from their bodies. She says that babies who <br/>
have not released stress may use nursing as a &quot;control pattern&quot; to <br/>
suppress their upset feelings and that it can lead to further control <br/>
pattern later in life, in other words: addictive behaviours like <br/>
smoking, drinking, over eating, watching too much TV, being on the <br/>
computer too much :-) etc....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway this is just a suggestion for those open to something <br/>
different. It is NOT an invitation to start a heated discussion about <br/>
the subject.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry, to be sounding like this, but it has happened before and <br/>
I&#39;ver heard it all before (the negative stuff about holding, I mean).<br/>
<br/>
Martha Welch&#39;s approach is more intense than that of Aletha Solter, <br/>
but still fascinating to read.<br/>
<br/>
Their web sites are:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758356267">Interesting ideas.  Certainly children should be allowed to express<br/>
whatever their emotions are and we can help them find ways to do this<br/>
that don&#39;t harm themselves or others.  It also makes sense to let them<br/>
know we love them (by holding, etc), especially when they are so upset.<br/>
<br/>
I clearly remember when dd#1 was a newborn that at first I would put her<br/>
to the breast in response to just about anything from her.  But if she<br/>
didn&#39;t want to nurse, she wouldn&#39;t.  As she grew, I learned to interact<br/>
with her in more varied ways.  I think that people who never quite got<br/>
their needs met are always searching, which can also lead to addictive<br/>
behaviors.<br/>
