&lt;As it is now, I feel like such a loner and sometimes question myself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably why a lot of us are here on this list.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; Being a SAHM, choosing to only have one car, choosing to live a frugal family centered lifestyle and homeschooling are definitely not mainstream and life would be easier without outside influences. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
yep.. couldn&#39;t agree with you more.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; I just want to cut down on unnecessary influences so my children will have it a little easier.    &gt;<br/>

We would all like to make it easier for our kids (I think!) but *is* that action (of limited tv) making it easier or is it prolonging the inevitable? I&#39;m not convinced that protecting the kids from certain shows really helps. In fact, I worry that it sometimes makes it more of an attraction. <br/>
not arguing with you... just pondering the questions..<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since we are pondering some questions here .... How powerful is the power of suggestion?  If I went on a diet, and decided not to eat desserts until I lost the weight I needed to lose, which way would be easier, if the temptation was limited or if everyone ate dessert in front of me every night.  Now I know you are going to say that eventually I will be tempted and need to learn to deal with it and you will be right but by then hopefully there will be other positive reinforcements to help.<br/>
