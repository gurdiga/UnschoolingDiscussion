and it  makes sense that the color transparencies can help people who <br/>
are dyslexic  when they read if that&#39;s true. I&#39;ve heard that when you <br/>
read off of what  you percieve as colored paper, it goes to a <br/>
different part of your brain,  and that&#39;s why it works for some <br/>
people. Reading upside down can sometimes  help too.<br/>

So...<br/>
Can&#39;t unschoolers just use REAL colored paper then, and real colored  pens?<br/>
 <br/>
I take notes in more than one color, often. I almost always have three or  <br/>
four felt-tip pens of different colors in my pocket or if I have a backpack I  <br/>
might have eight or ten.<br/>
 <br/>
Tricks for helping dyslexic kids keep up in school are not, I don&#39;t think,  <br/>
necessary for unschoolers.   But maybe I&#39;m missing the point and maybe  I even <br/>
missed a post.  I should go and look at the groups page.<br/>
 <br/>
The different part of brain reminded me of something, though.  When I  <br/>
measure for cooking and I have to count, I count down backwards.  Otherwise  I lose <br/>
count.  Even counting to three or four, I can lose count.   Backwards, I never <br/>
do.  So like with flour, if I grab up a half cup measure  and need three cups <br/>
of flour, I count down from six.<br/>
 <br/>
I transferred that to dealing cards.  Rather than count up from one  and <br/>
invariably have to count to see where I am, I count down and never ever lose  <br/>
track.<br/>
