<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581038683">Today we spent time playing with lentils in a box. Not unlike <br/>
sand, the kids (11, 9 and 7) were mesmerized. We scooped, <br/>
poured them from one container to another and counted them. <br/>
We figured out how many lentils are in a one pound bag: 6, 600.<br/>
<br/>
That got us wondering how many lentils it would take to make a <br/>
straight line from Los Angeles CA to New York City NY. We <br/>
began measuring one inch, then multiplied it by twelve inches for <br/>
a foot. Then we figured out how many feet in a mile and THEN, <br/>
we figured out how many miles (using mapquest) between LA <br/>
and NYC (we used our rounding skills and rounded that number <br/>
to 2800).<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that it would take 887, 040, 000 to make a straight <br/>
line from LA to NYC? When we guessed before we began, we <br/>
had these guesses: 87 billion, 50 billion, and 11 billion. We were <br/>
nowhere close. I would *never* have guessed that you could put <br/>
lentils end to end next to each other and get from LA to NYC <br/>
without going past 1 billion.<br/>
<br/>
That made me suddenly acutely aware of just how big a billion <br/>
dollars is (imagine housing one billion dollar bills, for instance, if  <br/>
less than a billion tiny lentils end to end will cross the USA). I <br/>
began to understand the nature of the huge deficit CA is facing <br/>
and the nation is spending on the war etc.<br/>
<br/>
I never really got &quot;one billion&quot; until today. And we had fun. And <br/>
suddenly I enjoyed a moment of math! Oh, did I mention my kids <br/>
enjoyed it too?<br/>

Did you allow for elevation?  You&#39;ll need more lentils to get over the <br/>
mountains.<br/>

2784 to 2800 miles. :) And LA to NYC isn&#39;t a straight line, AND, <br/>
LA isn&#39;t the furthest point west on the continental US nor is NYC <br/>
the furthest point east. But it was the best we could do. <br/>
Searching the Internet for the width of the continental US at its <br/>
widest point was beyond our search engine skills. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299648291">You peaked my interest with this and I discovered that West Quoddy Head <br/>
Station in Lubec, Maine is the Easternmost point in the continental US <br/>
and Cape Mendocino in CA is the westernmost point.  (Nearest town is <br/>
Capetown, CA)<br/>
<br/>
According to Yahoo Maps, it&#39;s 3671.7 miles driving.  Still looking for <br/>
that elusive &quot;as the crow flies&quot; info...<br/>

got the lentils out last night so we can re-calculate based on the <br/>
furthest points east and west. :) Will let you know what we find. :D<br/>
