<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018339241">I don&#39;t really have any perspective on Rachel Anne&#39;s concerns, but I was a<br/>
little bothered by Teresa G&#39;s comments.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What I mean is: let&#39;s say I&#39;m visiting my mom.  If she fixed my bowl of<br/>
&gt; cereal, picked up my dirty clothes, whatever, I&#39;d feel as though she was<br/>
&gt; treating me like a child.  I would feel that she thought I was an imbecile who<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t care for herself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?  When I go to visit my parents my Dad often fixes breakfast and<br/>
serves it to me at the table.  It&#39;s one way he makes me feel welcome.  It&#39;s<br/>
never made me think they thought me incapable of taking care of myself,<br/>
because I see it as an act of love.<br/>
<br/>
My Mom usually comes up to get dirty laundry, if I stay a few days, and if<br/>
I&#39;ve done my usual and it&#39;s just in a heap somewhere, she&#39;ll pick it up and<br/>
wash it.  I invariably tell her she doesn&#39;t have to do that for me, and she<br/>
always tells me that she doesn&#39;t get to &quot;baby&quot; me much anymore.  Considering<br/>
how poorly we get along most of the time, I appreciate a generous action<br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it were a situation where I lived there and she continued to do<br/>
&gt; &quot;everything&quot; for me, I&#39;d also start wondering why she seemed to have no<br/>
&gt; respect for herself.  I DO think that part of living in a family means that<br/>
&gt; everyone is responsible to everyone else-- creating a mess and then expecting<br/>
&gt; someone else to clean it up for you is disrespectful.  If this occurred in my<br/>
&gt; household and I&#39;d made a mess and my mom cleaned it up, I&#39;d feel as though she<br/>
&gt; was allowing herself to be treated more like a servant than a mom.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since discussing parents can be loaded with old issues, think of this from<br/>
your children&#39;s point of view.  Do they really make a mess and *expect* you<br/>
to clean it up?  Or are you bothered by the mess sooner than they are, so<br/>
you are the one who cleans it up?  If you left the mess for the mess-maker<br/>
to deal with, would it happen?  If the mess is in a public area, would a<br/>
simple, calm comment that it&#39;s in the way get it picked up when someone had<br/>
a moment?  <br/>
<br/>
And also, do you really feel like you&#39;re being treated like a servant when<br/>
you clean up for your children?  Sometimes that&#39;s the only gift we can give<br/>
our kids. <br/>
<br/>
We had a 14-year old boy live with us one summer while his mother was<br/>
dealing with her problems.  He didn&#39;t need me to help him get dressed, or<br/>
give him a bath, read to him, or whatever because he did all those things by<br/>
himself (unlike my son, who still needed those things)!   But I often made<br/>
him a sandwich before he went out, did his laundry, and picked up the<br/>
magazines strewn around his bed that he&#39;d flipped through the night before.<br/>
Those were ways I could show him I cared.  It was a gift.  I know he said<br/>
several times that his Mom never did stuff for him.  I told him I enjoyed<br/>
doing it, and I had.<br/>
<br/>
That was 2 years ago.  I talked to him on the phone last night.  He called<br/>
me in Germany because he had a problem and thought I could help.  I don&#39;t<br/>
recall any great advice I shelled out that summer, but the little stuff<br/>
built our relationship.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe that&#39;s just me-- but I think that there&#39;s a certain level of give & take<br/>
&gt; here.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be concerned if there was no give and take, but I really wonder if part<br/>
of the issue is our attitudes as Mom.<br/>
