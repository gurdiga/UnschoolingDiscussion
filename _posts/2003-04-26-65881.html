<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I daresay I was *not* patient and *did* push my oldest dd.  I expected<br/>
&gt; her to read early and to love reading.  As a child,  I was an early<br/>
&gt; reader.  This and society has this message that &quot;Reading is the key to<br/>
&gt; education and education is the key to success. Knowledge is power.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Me too, Kirby.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Two and a half reading lessons.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not because I thought he couldn&#39;t learn but I thought he would be happier <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; I would be more relieved and the grandparents would praise him...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He cried.  He thumped his head down on the book and cried.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I promised him a Ninja Turtle toy he really wanted if he would finish <br/>
&gt; another <br/>
&gt; session (AND my sessions were being too long!!! Why didn&#39;t I just go with <br/>
&gt; five minute sessions!?  I was stupid.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He said he didn&#39;t want that toy anymore.  I saw the depth of his pain and <br/>
&gt; despair and realized I could make him hate reading AND me, and hugged him <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; rocked him and apologized and said never again.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So the younger ones were spared.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a confession to make. <br/>
<br/>
Julian and I picked up on the unschooling thing the moment he left school <br/>
after the third grade to begin homeschooling. (His other mom and his dad took <br/>
longer to really get it.)  When he left school he was already a passionate <br/>
reader, and never had any problems.  As a matter of fact, it was instrumental <br/>
in our decision to pull him out.<br/>
<br/>
One night Beth had been reading to him at bedtime. They finished, then she <br/>
said he could finish the chapter in the book he had been reading on his own <br/>
before turning out the light. Two hours later he came out saying, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
lonely.&quot; He&#39;d been reading the entire time.<br/>
<br/>
As we tucked him in again and turned out the light he said, &quot;The biggest <br/>
problem with school is there&#39;s never enough time to read.&quot;  BINGO!  The <br/>
decision was made.<br/>
<br/>
So...the confession. Intellectually, I know that he would have been a reader <br/>
whether or not he went to school.... But it made buying into Unschooling <br/>
IMMEASURABLY easier knowing he could.<br/>
<br/>
I think it all comes down to what we think is important. Julian hated <br/>
cursive, and gave up on it early. I didn&#39;t care about that at all except.... <br/>
His Other parents (who shall remain nameless in this example) have signatures <br/>
that lead to banks calling for signature checks, etc. His father, in fact, no <br/>
longer bothers to write letters, just a hastily written line. I told Julian I <br/>
knew it was my stuff, but that I wanted him to have a legible signature. So I <br/>
made it worth his while (bribery), and he practiced writing his name in <br/>
cursive until he had it down. He thought it was funny (and was probably <br/>
relieved that that was all I cared about re: cursive), and told me he&#39;d do it <br/>
without the bribery. I figured he deserved it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, he still doesn&#39;t know his times tables, and early on we <br/>
told him he didn&#39;t need to unless he wanted to. From D&D, he can do <br/>
percentages and other bizarre things in his head. I never stressed about <br/>
that...but I am not a Math kinda gal.<br/>
<br/>
So...I really admire the folks who just trust their kids will learn to read <br/>
even if it takes them a while, and I&#39;ve read enough of your stories to <br/>
understand that you are right... And I&#39;m really glad he already knew. <br/>
Probably saved him from lots of those &quot;My GOD WHAT AM I DOING TO MY KID&#39;S <br/>
LIFE??!!! moments.<br/>
