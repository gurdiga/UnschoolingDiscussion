&gt; ultimate ego-trip.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dear Helen, <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right, of course.  I respect you enormously.<br/>
<br/>
I arrived with expectations (from the list name alone) that I had found<br/>
fellow-travellers, and almost immediately formed the impression that the<br/>
list was not performing the function I saw for it, so I started to make my<br/>
&quot;inflammatory&quot; views known, still seeking like minds. At first, it seemed,<br/>
that people were in denial (can this list really be for &quot;newbies to<br/>
homeschooling&quot;?). As objections grew, I got annoyed -- Whassamatter, can&#39;t<br/>
you see what we need to do....?  -- I believed in the people who seemed to<br/>
appreciate hearing my views, and got more and more annoyed at the<br/>
complainers.<br/>
<br/>
I am not young any more. I am not patient, and I am not optimistic these<br/>
days regarding the future of homeschooling freedom, so I have been seeing<br/>
some urgency in the struggle for it. We&#39;ve been challengedthis year here in<br/>
(ironically) the Constitution State (CT), and I arrived at this list still<br/>
embittered by what our legislature almost did to us, without ever giving<br/>
notice. Added to that, I&#39;ve just been sent a copy of the NEA Game Plan<br/>
against vouchers. I&#39;m sure they have a similar one against homeschooling (is<br/>
that paranoid or a reasonable assumption?) We are, once again, looking a lot<br/>
like an underdog in a world controlled so tightly by politics.<br/>
<br/>
I will, from now on, put my &quot;militaristic&quot; self on hold, and offer my<br/>
limited unschool experience to those who ask. No excuses.  I promise.<br/>
<br/>
I am not selling anything. I&#39;m not even a candidate for anything this year.<br/>
I&#39;m merely anxious, more than ever, about our country losing, or jettisoning<br/>
its freedoms in favor of &quot;security&quot; -- I&#39;m sure you know what Jefferson told<br/>
us about that trade-off.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t &quot;waited until now&quot; to make my views known. If you&#39;ve checked the<br/>
AED list, you know I&#39;ve been around, and as you know, Luz and I are writers<br/>
of articles that get circulated some. I&#39;ve had actual occupations over the<br/>
years and parenting preoccupations that have held me at bay, so to speak.<br/>
Also, I wasn&#39;t sure that our educational experiment  (inspired wholly by<br/>
reading and meeting John Holt)  would be completely successful until<br/>
recently when our unschooling &quot;poster boy&quot; graduated from college in the top<br/>
2% of his class, with supreme confidence in his own future.<br/>
<br/>
So now I can say, without my usual modesty, that unschooling works wonders.<br/>
The satisfaction is invigorating, and I&#39;m afraid I spoiled a lot of that<br/>
vigor by mixing it with my equal faith in libertarian ideals. If I was<br/>
trying to sell something, it was liberty.<br/>
<br/>
So, this clears the air for me -- I don&#39;t need the negatives any more than<br/>
you do -- I just had to push it to find out what the list was about, down<br/>
deep.  As the kids say now, I&#39;m cool with it. The baptism is over and I&#39;ll<br/>
take a seat, happily. I love talking about how our son raised himself as we<br/>
lovingly watched and trusted him. It was thrilling, and I&#39;ll write a book<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
But for now -- and you are the right person to ask -- can you tell me, where<br/>
is that vanguard I&#39;m looking for, and do you think I can help them, given my<br/>
intense interest in improving the political climate in favor of<br/>
homeschooling? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for everything. (We still subscribe four years after emptying the<br/>
nest)  Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>

read between the lines and put the puzzle pieces together hasn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am not young any more. I am not patient, and I am not optimistic these<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear you, Ned. I&#39;m a grandmother five times over, my patience has <br/>
been shot to pieces by my parents&#39; medical hassles in the last year <br/>
(dealing with doctors will drive you right over the edge of reason), <br/>
and the future of homeschooling as you and I knew it way back when <br/>
seems to be going down the drain in state after state. I&#39;ve written <br/>
extensively on this in other forums, and in HEM, so I won&#39;t beleaguer <br/>
the point here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;so I have been seeing<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course we&#39;re the underdogs. I wish I had some cheerful upbeat <br/>
comeback about us irrepressible unschoolers, but the fact is I&#39;m not <br/>
convinced that we&#39;ll be able to hold onto the freedoms we have.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am not selling anything. I&#39;m not even a candidate for anything this year.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m merely anxious, more than ever, about our country losing, or jettisoning<br/>

&gt;us about that trade-off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. Those who would give up freedom in order to get security don&#39;t <br/>
deserve either one. Or something to that effect.<br/>
<br/>
I could write a book on how the current administration&#39;s actions are <br/>
scaring the bejeebers out of me, but that&#39;s for another time, another <br/>
list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dropped off the AED list some time ago. But I&#39;ve seen your <br/>
writings, and Luz&#39;s, and very thoughtful ones they&#39;ve been. Would you <br/>
believe the two of you are on my list of potential interviewees for <br/>
HEM? No, really. (But the next two issues are already covered...)<br/>
<br/>

&gt;2% of his class, with supreme confidence in his own future.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always enjoy reading your proud writings about your son (Cassidy, <br/>
right?). All five of our always-unschooled kids have gone into the <br/>
workworld and amazed us with their skills and expertise (I mean, one <br/>
son became an industrial electrician, and another went into <br/>
construction specializing in steel metal buildings, and both quickly <br/>
moved into management positions - where in all their unschooling did <br/>
they learn *those* kinds of skills?). I&#39;ve written about our kids at <br/>
great length on this list and others, so again, I&#39;ll just advise <br/>
anyone interested to check the archives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So now I can say, without my usual modesty, that unschooling works wonders.<br/>

&gt;vigor by mixing it with my equal faith in libertarian ideals. If I was<br/>
&gt;trying to sell something, it was liberty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We can all use more of that. I&#39;ve always been interested in <br/>
Libertarian ideas, but when push comes to shove it seems like just <br/>
another political party to me. I feel politics are like religion - <br/>
best kept between oneself and damn few others. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, this clears the air for me -- I don&#39;t need the negatives any more than<br/>

heck... Welcome aboard!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I love talking about how our son raised himself as we<br/>
&gt;lovingly watched and trusted him. It was thrilling, and I&#39;ll write a book<br/>

&gt;homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suggest the NHEN-Legislative list, and yeah, I know you&#39;re on there <br/>
already. I&#39;ve quit participating in that list for reasons that should <br/>
be clear if you read much of the archives, but it&#39;s still one of the <br/>
best for working toward change. Otherwise our HEM-Networking list can <br/>
be a pretty rollicking list when it gets off dead center. It&#39;s there <br/>
now mostly because I&#39;ve been travelling all this year (I&#39;m currently <br/>
on my fifth trip to Alaska since January). If life ever settles down <br/>
again I&#39;d really like to seriously address some of the kinds of <br/>
issues you&#39;ve brought up here. But PUH-LEEZE let me get off this <br/>
doggone 800# access before you engage on another of *our* lists! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Thanks for everything. (We still subscribe four years after emptying the<br/>
&gt;nest)  Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad to know you still find enough of interest in HEM. We try <br/>
hard to keep it lively. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I also see the growth of the practice, and it&#39;s encouraging.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I assume you mean the growth of homeschooling? It&#39;s reaching <br/>
astonishing proportions, and seems to be accelerating, even. I&#39;m <br/>
still not sure if that&#39;s a good thing, for as John Holt (dear wise <br/>
old fellow) pointed out many years ago, once homeschooling reaches a <br/>
certain critical mass it won&#39;t slip under the educrats&#39; radar nearly <br/>
as smoothly...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was your first mistake, Ned.  The last thing most people on an <br/>
established list want to see is someone coming on to tell them that their <br/>
list is not performing the function the newbie sees for it.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>
that lists can&#39;t change and evolve, but they rarely do in response to a <br/>
newbie&#39;s complaints.<br/>
<br/>
As for seeking like minds . . . if you were doing more listening than <br/>
talking at first, you would have discovered that most of the people on this <br/>
list share at least *some* of your views.  Obviously, if you were looking <br/>
just for libertarian unschoolers willing to become activists for freedom of <br/>
education, you&#39;d only find a few.  But if you were looking for unschoolers <br/>
who were interested in *exploring* ideas about freedom and activism, you <br/>
probably would have found a lot more.  I&#39;m sure you and I could find lots <br/>
to agree on, for instance.  But when you start with the libertarian stuff, <br/>
*assuming* that everyone will agree with you because you&#39;re sure it&#39;s the <br/>
right path, then you lose me and probably a lot of others.  My libertarian <br/>
brother-in-law has managed to put me totally off that philosophy with his <br/>
constant, angry hatred of government in all forms.  He has completely <br/>
destroyed my daughter&#39;s relationship with my sister, all because she spent <br/>
a few years as a single parent on welfare.  (Like my granddaughter deserved <br/>
to spend years in daycare just because her mother chose the wrong man to be <br/>

think that you&#39;ll be much more effective having lost the bitter anger <br/>

I can&#39;t buy the argument that they&#39;re all evil.  They may be *wrong*  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
but most of them aren&#39;t evil.  In fact, they&#39;re probably all the more <br/>
dangerous just because they believe so strongly that they&#39;re doing what&#39;s <br/>
best for kids or the country, or whatever.  And I think they really and <br/>
truly do believe that.  I don&#39;t believe that most teachers are just out to <br/>
protect their jobs, though their union makes it sound as if they are.  I <br/>
know teachers who homeschool their kids, who believe in vouchers, <br/>
etc.  They do the best they can within the constraints of the system, but <br/>
they also don&#39;t subject their own kids to it having seen it from the inside.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am not selling anything. I&#39;m not even a candidate for anything this year.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m merely anxious, more than ever, about our country losing, or jettisoning<br/>
&gt;its freedoms in favor of &quot;security&quot; -- I&#39;m sure you know what Jefferson told<br/>
&gt;us about that trade-off.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup.  I definitely share your concern about that.  It was almost my first <br/>
thought after hearing about the twin towers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also, I wasn&#39;t sure that our educational experiment  (inspired wholly by<br/>
&gt;reading and meeting John Holt)  would be completely successful until<br/>
&gt;recently when our unschooling &quot;poster boy&quot; graduated from college in the top<br/>
&gt;2% of his class, with supreme confidence in his own future.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do hope that you aren&#39;t holding up his path into the world as the only <br/>
measure of success in unschooling.  I have a son who will probably never go <br/>
to university (though I could end up eating my words - you can save them <br/>
for me if you want.)  My son is definitely not an unschooling poster boy by <br/>
that standard.  But I do believe he&#39;s going to be successful in whatever he <br/>
ends up doing with his life.  That and being relatively happy are my goals <br/>
for him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So now I can say, without my usual modesty, that unschooling works wonders.<br/>
&gt;The satisfaction is invigorating, and I&#39;m afraid I spoiled a lot of that<br/>
&gt;vigor by mixing it with my equal faith in libertarian ideals. If I was<br/>
&gt;trying to sell something, it was liberty.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey!  I&#39;ll buy that.  It&#39;s just that you and I have somewhat differing <br/>
definitions of liberty.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So, this clears the air for me -- I don&#39;t need the negatives any more than<br/>
&gt;you do -- I just had to push it to find out what the list was about, down<br/>
&gt;deep.  As the kids say now, I&#39;m cool with it. The baptism is over and I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;take a seat, happily. I love talking about how our son raised himself as we<br/>
&gt;lovingly watched and trusted him. It was thrilling, and I&#39;ll write a book<br/>
&gt;about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll read it.<br/>
