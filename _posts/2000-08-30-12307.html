that you are a good mom, having a difficult time.<br/>
<br/>
None of his behavior sounds at all out of the ordinary for a child of 4.  How <br/>
to deal with it?  I don&#39;t have any good answers.  When my oldest was this <br/>
age, he did similar things.  He still remembers taking a canning jar out on <br/>
the front porch, holding over the corner of the cement and dropping it with <br/>
some force simply to see if it would shatter!  He saw it on TV and wanted to <br/>
know if it would really break.  Of course, at that time he wasn&#39;t able to <br/>
tell me WHY he&#39;d done such a thing and we laugh about it now.  He also <br/>
remembers being grounded from TV for that act.  His favorite show at the time <br/>
was Dukes of Hazard and the season finale was that week.  So, DS sat outside <br/>
and watched it in the reflection of the window!!  This is even more <br/>
remarkable since I don&#39;t like the show, so he had get it on at the right time <br/>
without drawing my attention to the fact.<br/>
<br/>
This is the same son that pushed us to an unschooling lifestyle...he simply <br/>
will NOT be put in a box.  He pulled out numerous music tapes (pre-VCR days), <br/>
colored on the walls over and over again even though we had paper available <br/>
and he got in trouble every time!  (also pre-washable markers)<br/>
<br/>
Hate to admit it, but we never found a good solution in channeling his <br/>
behavior.  I did have to learn to disengage and not take it personally or the <br/>
kid would NOT have made it to adulthood.  The standard line became something <br/>
like &quot;How old do you want to be when you die?  You&#39;re not even gonna make it <br/>
to your next birthday at this rate!&quot;  (said very tongue in cheek so he <br/>
recognized he wasn&#39;t in real danger and I could find some humor)<br/>
<br/>
He is still strong willed as an adult and, lucky him, so is his wife and <br/>
toddler!  LOL  What goes around comes around.  heheheh  And I never even had <br/>
to curse him with the wish that he&#39;d someday have a child just like himself.  <br/>
&lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully someone will have some answers that will help.  All I can tell you <br/>
is there are many more out there just like him!  <br/>

health problems coming to light in his early adult years which could explain <br/>
his behavior as a child.  It&#39;s an illness that has flares and remission which <br/>
can be brought on by allergies, chemicals, stress, etc.  Not saying your son <br/>
has some rare or grave disease, but it is a good point and something to look <br/>
into.<br/>

It sounds like he is trying to figure out how things are working....hang in <br/>

It is hard not to worry over the future, but when my little one (3) stands <br/>
right in front of me and spits on the floor (yes, it takes tons of control <br/>
not to react-when I am ready to throw her out the window) I try to look for <br/>
all the good things that she does like help her brother gently off the chair, <br/>
find my water bottle, hands me things nicely....then I really praise her for <br/>

&lt;&lt; Has anyone else encountered anything like this? anyone survived anything<br/>
 like this? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!! At precisely this same age also!  I thought I was going to go crazy. He <br/>
did<br/>
things he was told not to do constantly.  I believed that his <br/>
will/desire/curiosity/need<br/>
was just too strong to explore/try regardless if it pleased his parents or <br/>
not.  Such a<br/>
tough time, I often felt that he just didn&#39;t want to be a part of our family, <br/>
he just<br/>
would not fit in or cooperate at all.  He is still pretty strong willed (as <br/>
are all my<br/>
children LOL).  but I tell myself that all of his traits that drive me nuts <br/>
are exactly<br/>
like his father!!! &lt;---who sometimes drives me nuts too!!  but are things <br/>
that I <br/>
admire in a man, daring, perseverance, inquisitiveness, assertive, goes to the<br/>
beat of his own drummer---you get the picture ; )  Just a sampling would be <br/>
cutting<br/>
things, like a handmade wall covering, my pajama top to name a couple.  <br/>
Finally<br/>
a good friend suggested we get him a cutting box filled with things to cut <br/>
up--<br/>
different textures old towels/sponges/paper/cardboard etc.  That seemed to <br/>
work,<br/>
but also he was outgrowing this behavior by the time we implemented box.  One<br/>
thing that has helped me so much are a series of books by the Giselle <br/>
Institute,<br/>
Your one year old, your two year old and so on.  what they talk about is how <br/>
children go in and out of equilibrium every six months or so.  For my other <br/>
two<br/>
children I didn&#39;t notice it very strongly, but for my middle boy it was sooooo<br/>
obvious that other family members noticed the change (that would be when<br/>
he &quot;bounced&quot; back &quot;into&quot; equilibrium--his behavior/personality becomes much<br/>
more positive)  This so far has been most noticeable turning three and <br/>
turning <br/>
four.  So for the first half of the year everything appeared normal, then <br/>
late into<br/>
the second half of the year I would go, oh wow look at this, he is way out of<br/>
of control.  He is now 5 1/2, haven&#39;t noticed any changes yet....but its <br/>
still to<br/>
early to tell LOL.  Oh and the other part of the books are that they talk <br/>
about<br/>
age appropriate behavior.  I know that when I know behaviors are normal I<br/>
can deal with them so much better.  Oh and about the pajama top, when he<br/>
bounced back into equilibrium months later, he came to me and most sincerely<br/>
said, mom I am sorry I cut your top.  It was so sweet.  I would have thought<br/>
he had forgotten it.  Anyhow, hope this helps some.<br/>

sandwiches, pizza, broccoli (Believe it or not!  My kid won&#39;t touch ketchup, <br/>
but broccoli is a hit.), pancakes, scrambled eggs, bird&#39;s nests (cut a hole <br/>
in bread, butter both sides, set into frying pan and break an egg into the <br/>
middle, toast and turn to toast other side...my kids love this!), german <br/>
pancakes, (still a favorite), any ol&#39; pasta with parmesan cheese and <br/>
butter...that&#39;s a good sample, I suppose.  <br/>
<br/>
I was quite amazed at what he came up with, actually.  Like I said, he did <br/>
get lots of help in the kitchen!  <br/>
<br/>
Also notice the lack of vegetable or tomato products.  This kid would not eat <br/>
pizza with a traditional sauce on it until he was 8 or 9.  His pizza was a <br/>
sprinkle of cinnamon or pizza spices, depending on the mood, top with <br/>
pepperoni and cheese.  I wasn&#39;t going near his pizza, but he was happy.  <br/>
OTOH, we are a real riot at the pizza place because we order a pizza without <br/>
any sauce and another with no cheese!<br/>
<br/>
This turned into a real good experience for the boys.  The older son, 10 <br/>
years older, was often drafted to help little brother cook.  They enjoyed <br/>
themselves and still have special memories about preparing food. <br/>
<br/>
For a while there, Sundays became SON-days...as in the sons cook that day (we <br/>
are a boy-children only family).  I think I&#39;ll have to go back to that <br/>
practice.  It was nice to have a day I didn&#39;t have to figure out the menu.  <br/>
Besides, if I don&#39;t like what&#39;s on the menu I can always make a PB&J.  LOL<br/>

I enjoy that part of it, but the stove has always had me mystified.  Slowly, <br/>
after 10 years with my husband, I&#39;m learning.  But he&#39;s still a much better <br/>
and more patient cook than me.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom was the cook in the family.  She was one of those stay-at-home moms <br/>
reared in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s who considered it her mission in life to TAKE <br/>
CARE OF HER FAMILY.  This is another way of saying that she did everything.  <br/>
When I got my first apartment, I didn&#39;t know how to wash clothes.  I did not <br/>
know how to cook.  The only thing I did know how to do was sew.  I had <br/>
learned that early because I was attracted to it and all forms of needlework. <br/>
 But, we had few chores in our house.  Mom just took care of all.  Now, I&#39;m <br/>
paying the price, but I learned a lot from that.  We&#39;re actively involving <br/>
our children in the running and maintenance of the household so that it will <br/>
all feel like a natural part of life for them.  I hope.  <br/>

woman had painted, in big red letters &#39;Don&#39;t let the b******s grind <br/>
you down!!!&#39; on her magnolia living room walls.  I took the <br/>
daughter of the house to get the can of paint, got it down, but it <br/>
fell, and got EVERYWHERE!!!  Well, we tried to clean it up, but <br/>
failed (I need to explain that my babysitting big sis was asleep at <br/>
this time) and went to the bathroom to clean ourselves.  And <br/>
accidentally made handprints (bright red paint, remember?) all the <br/>
way up the wall.  We were still upstairs when Mum came in, and <br/>
the front door opened onto the stairway, so she saw all these <br/>
handprints and thought someone had been slaughtered!  There <br/>
was paint everywhere.  It&#39;s one of those famous family tales now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-9409087">I decided to bake bread & pies for tomorrow.  (DH has a really great key<br/>
lime pie.)  I was letting the kids (7 & 4) help but they were into it more<br/>
than I needed.  First we made the graham cracker crust (DH wanted to buy the<br/>
premade).  They had a blast.  DH was surprised to see them having so much<br/>
fun.  DH was busy getting the chicken in marinate & the kids were under foot<br/>
trying to help him too.  They had to read & follow directions for me.  I was<br/>
planning on one key lime & one pumpkin.  DD & I cooked some down from last<br/>
year&#39;s pumpkin & I froze it in cup sizes.  DH decided pumpkin was not in<br/>
season so we&#39;re having 2 key lime pies.  Then I got out the bread dough.<br/>
The kids were surprised at how it grew.  They wanted to eat the dough more<br/>
than knead.  The first loaf is out of the oven & smells great.<br/>

DH decided he&#39;s figured out why husbands go to work & stay out of the<br/>
