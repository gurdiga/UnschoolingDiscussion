<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739572361">Hi - We&#39;ve been unschooling for more than a year now and some things <br/>
are going good and I&#39;m trying to trust my son and for most things it <br/>
is easy, but I&#39;m having a difficult time with how to talk with the <br/>
following issue with him - or perhaps I shouldn&#39;t talk with him <br/>
about it at all but I feel like we&#39;ve been not communicating as well <br/>
as we could be lately anyhow because I&#39;m stressed over other things. <br/>
Anyhow he wanted to write his grandma a thank you note for sending <br/>
him money for his birthday, he just turned 7 so I helped him find <br/>
the markers and a clean page in his notebook and asked him what he <br/>
wanted to write and he told me so I wrote it out for him to copy as <br/>
he asked. He did the gra fine (all caps but that&#39;s fine with me) <br/>
then you could tell he was getting frustrated on the n and then made <br/>
a big mess on the d and gave up. I asked him if I could help with <br/>
anything and he said no he needed a break and was going to go watch <br/>
tv. That was about a week ago and I&#39;m just not sure what I should be <br/>
doing, do I ask him about it? offer to buy him writing workbooks to <br/>
help ease his anxiety over writing? Just leave it alone? And he has <br/>
a big chocolate fixation lately and he&#39;s putting on weight because <br/>
of it, I leave cheese and carrots and more healthy stuff for him at <br/>
easy reach but he still goes for his stash of chocolate poptarts & <br/>
pudding cups. I try and only buy him one sweet at the store a trip <br/>
but dad let him sneak him an extra today! I don&#39;t buy any sweets for <br/>
myself, I&#39;ld rather make good cookies at home but he hasn&#39;t been <br/>
interested in that lately either. Freedom & trust are hard. I&#39;m <br/>
going to try and read some more of playful parenting tonight perhaps <br/>
that will give me some ideas.</div>

thank-you letter&quot;, say &quot;Do you want to draw a picture<br/>
of you playing with your new toy to send to grandma?&quot; <br/>
or &quot;Let me take a picture of you with your new toy for<br/>
grandma&quot; or just buy a card and maybe he can draw a<br/>
picture inside or sign his name?  All of those sound<br/>
like a lot less stress for a little guy who&#39;s not<br/>
ready to write....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317461840">Let him dictate a note, type it, print it, and let him decorate it.<br/>
Enclose a photo of him and the gift.<br/>
 <br/>
At our house there&#39;s never been any &quot;7 yo handwriting&quot; except for  copying.  <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s another idea.  Print a SHORT note out and see if he wants to  copy it. <br/>
 That&#39;s how most little kids at school anyway,  copying.<br/>

With Cameron, I would write the note in light pencil and let him copy <br/>
over it with a fine-point felt pen/marker. Then he&#39;d erase the pencil <br/>
marks with an artist&#39;s eraser.<br/>
<br/>
Spelling was correct, the letters didn&#39;t get progressively huge or <br/>
tiny, and his frustration level was incredibly low. Winner all the  way <br/>
around. He could practically do it in his sleep! &lt;G&gt; The added plus is <br/>
that he learned how a thank you note sounds. It wasn&#39;t long before he&#39;d <br/>
dictate the notes to me. Now he writes them himself.<br/>

Cameron stayed with us for a week last month.  He&#39;s 17 now and wrote  THE <br/>
most glorious, mushy, long thank you note I&#39;ve ever gotten from someone who  <br/>
wasn&#39;t female, a professional writer, grown or all three.  So listen to  Kelly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 8 1/2 yo Jack, is just now able to copy full words and sentences.<br/>
Before that, I wrote one letter at a time for him.  I do that now for <br/>
my 5 yo Jamie.  If I write a whole word for her to copy (more than 3 <br/>
letters) she get confused and messes up usually.<br/>
Another thing we do is, I just say the letters one at a time.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t know what it looks like, I write it down on another sheet or <br/>
I&#39;ll air write it.<br/>
They just wrote letters to my mom yesterday.  I was suprised, because <br/>
Jack had never asked to write a letter to anyone before.  <br/>
He only wrote 2 sentences, but the fact he wanted to do it, out of the <br/>
blue, was really sweet to me.<br/>
Jamie had to write one too when she found out about Jacks.  Hers said,<br/>
<br/>
Dear Gramom and Pops<br/>
Is it warm there?<br/>
What did you have for breakfast?<br/>
Pancakes or waffles?<br/>
We got a new refrigerator.<br/>
We got our computer fixed.<br/>
Write me back.<br/>
Love Jamie<br/>
<br/>
It looks really adorable with big letters and small ones going <br/>
haphazardly across the page.<br/>
She also got really good writing her W&#39;s, and liked writing a word <br/>
with x in it.<br/>
My parents will love it.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Jacks 4-H leader asked if I wanted a handwriting program for <br/>
him. I politely declined, and it didn&#39;t bother me in the least that <br/>
she mentioned it.  I know he&#39;ll be fine.  Good handwriting or not.<br/>
