 </span></blockquote>Gotta disagree with you here. If there&#39;s going to be public school, I think<br/>
teachers should make $100,000 - BUT, there&#39;s no tenure, class sizes should<br/>
be no more than 10 and every student should rate the teacher at the end of<br/>
the year. Less than 8 of 10 high ratings - you&#39;re out!<br/>
<br/>
High salaries might foster competition for jobs and make principals and<br/>
school boards carefully select who they want to pay those big bucks to.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you think someone who sees your kid more hours a day than you do<br/>
should be highly valued? (Not the actual YOU, the rhetorical You.)<br/>
