You know how at Unschooling-101, we&#39;ve discussed that there are different <br/>
levels of unschooling?   And that there have been different lists set up for the <br/>
different levels? Total beginners (-101), those that &quot;get it&quot; a little better <br/>
and maybe even &quot;got it&quot; (UnschoolingDiscussion), and those that truly <br/>
understand it to the core of their being? <br/>
<br/>
This here&#39;s the graduate level----think of AlwaysLearning as a Master&#39;s <br/>
e-list! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Believing that a child can&#39;t make decisions on what&#39;s internally <br/>
difficult---like censoring movies, limiting food, and, of course, forcing learning----will <br/>
be even harder for those on THIS list!<br/>
<br/>
Many here are NOT on -101, so they haven&#39;t seen you struggling with the <br/>
challenging going on there. Please don&#39;t be surprised at the responses you get here!<br/>
<br/>
Just my subtle warning!<br/>

This is just my opinion, and I do not expect people to change their minds to <br/>
my way of thinking. But since you asked;)<br/>
<br/>
I do censor what my children read, to an extent. Here is why. I do this for <br/>
the same reasons that I censor what they watch. I do not allow them to watch <br/>
movies where people are having sex, or running around naked. <br/>
My daughters are 11 and 14.<br/>
I watched Matrix Reloaded, which they wanted to see. There was one scene <br/>
Where Keanu and the woman were having sex. They can&#39;t watch it. I just think <br/>
that <br/>
(my opinion only) those types of things are inappropriate for my daughters. I <br/>
love horror movies. They are my favorite, but I will not allow them to watch <br/>
most of them because of the sex. The same thing goes for books.<br/>
My favorite books are by Stephen King and Anne Rice. There are sex &quot;scenes&quot; <br/>
in books as well.  Romance novels (like from Harlequin) have parts that are <br/>
pretty much porn. They do not need that kind of information at their ages, in <br/>
my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I do not just say &quot;NO!&quot; I read the entire book, or watch the entire movie, <br/>
first. Then I make an informed decision.<br/>
<br/>
At their ages, I no longer worry about the violence in movies. They have been <br/>
raised away from such stuff as much as possible, so that is not a factor for <br/>
my daughters. They know it isn&#39;t real, they know it isn&#39;t okay, they can <br/>
watch <br/>
it. So far, there have only been two movies, without sex, that I have not let <br/>
them watch, and both had explicit pictures of murdered children that I found <br/>
very disturbing. One was a Jack Nicholson movie, and the other was a <br/>
documentary (2 part), Paradise lost, about a true case.<br/>
<br/>
My sister, though, puts no such limits on my nephew (9 years) about even <br/>
violence, and he has watched Matrix Reloaded. So every parent is different I <br/>
guess.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
Shannon<br/>
