<div id="ygrps-yiv-2011509750">Hello Unschoolers, just a quick note to let you know I haven&#39;t <br/>
forgotten this good list, just swamped with all the last-minute <br/>
details of getting this issue out the door in the middle of all the <br/>
buzz and excitement the media is generating over our domain name <br/>
problem. We made the front page of Wired News (a major coup) today, <br/>
which means the media will be ringing the phones off the wall again <br/>
tomorrow...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 140 messages behind tonight, but I&#39;ll try to catch up sometime tomorrow...<br/>
<br/>
