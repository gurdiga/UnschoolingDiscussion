<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315495441">Hi,<br/>
I am new here but not to unschooling.<br/>
We have done it since birth even when the kids were in PS we unschooled at<br/>
home.<br/>
My kids do well on standardized testing with one of then 6 grades higher<br/>
than his PS placement would be this year.<br/>
Andrew our oldest (15 in March) is learning disabled and unschooled himself<br/>
how to read with the Goosebumps books.<br/>
Lin III (12 next week) Is the one testing above grade level. Is working on<br/>
his Highschool Credits.<br/>
Felicia (just turned 10 in August) is having trouble with multiplication and<br/>
division.<br/>
<br/>
We use a geosafari which I make my own cards to fit subjects they are<br/>
working on in there unschooling. I also make File folder games for them.  If<br/>
they play the games great If the don&#39;t oh well ant any rate I have<br/>
somethiong to show nosy people who claim my kids do nothing all day. :-))<br/>
<br/>
I have gotten really good at record keeping! My children had homebased head<br/>
start which trains parents to look at all the activities that there kids are<br/>
doing and pick out the educational content. I would reccomend it to anyone<br/>
who has toddlers 3-5 that plans on unschooling. They have a really nice form<br/>
that you fill out. or at least they did wghen my kids were there. I have<br/>
blank forms for elementary school in Maine that I made at my web site.<br/>
http://www.angelfire.com/me3/dorioakes/Homeschooling.html<br/>
My highschool form might be there too by the end of the week. If you want me<br/>
to upload a scanned immage of how it looks for Felicia Let me know. I can do<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
We also use computer curriculum of Jumpstart, Cornerstone Home, and<br/>
Cluefinders. The kids only play them when they want to and what ever grade<br/>
they want to.<br/>
<br/>
We use workbooks too only they are used to earn money or other rewards.<br/>
After all who goes to work (except homeschooling Mom&#39;s) without being<br/>
financially rewarded?????<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll talk Later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663106679">I checked out your website and noticed a link to unschooling.com.<br/>
Have you read there, or its message board?<br/>
Your typical week seems fairly structured, and I was wondering, what <br/>
do you mean by &quot;time fillers&quot; in your description of workbooks?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to apologize for thinking you were joking, Dorinda. I&#39;ve been <br/>
away from unschooling message boards and lists for several months <br/>
now. I was completely clueless about the changes on this board. These <br/>
days when people say that they are unschoolers, it could mean <br/>
different things, i guess. Our unschooling looks really different <br/>
from your unschooling. I admit to being somewhat confused. Did I fall <br/>
down a rabbit hole or something?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have done it since birth even when the kids were in PS we unschooled at<br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect what you did was enrich their learning with fun activities.<br/>
Nothing wrong with that! Sounds like fun! This is not to say you need to<br/>
change anything about what you&#39;re doing. Only to gently suggest that if<br/>
you&#39;re looking for ideas to make things kids need to know fun, you&#39;ll find<br/>
the offerings on this list slim in that area. If, on the otherhand, you&#39;re<br/>
trying to feel more comfortable that living is learning, trying to let go of<br/>
levels and the idea that some things are necessary to learn, then there&#39;s<br/>
lots of helpful advice here.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t have anything to do with learning what everyone is<br/>
certain everyone needs to know. Unschooling is letting go of the idea that<br/>
kids need to multiply or learn geography or history or grammar or how to<br/>
write. Those things *will* be part of their lives and kids *will* reach a<br/>
level of competence that is useful to them. Books will be set in real<br/>
locations, games will be played that need arithmetic to be better at,<br/>
message boards will have messages that kids will want to respond to. (Or not<br/>
if their interests lie elsewhere.) The concept of unschooling is that, just<br/>
as they took what path they found most useful for their own needs in<br/>
learning to speak (talking about dinosaurs or poop or Teletubbies), kids<br/>
will acquire what they need as adults by exploring the paths of their<br/>
interests. Whatever level of geography (or whatever) they acquire naturally<br/>
through living -- and continue acquiring through  out their lives -- is the<br/>
level that they will need as adults. *If* they need a higher level for some<br/>
purpose that suddenly strikes them, they will either set about acquiring it<br/>
because they know they can learn whatever they set out to learn, or they<br/>
will have already acquired it because it&#39;s part of the things they are<br/>
naturally drawn to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My kids do well on standardized testing with one of then 6 grades higher<br/>
&gt; than his PS placement would be this year.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In unschooling there are no grades or placements. Unschooled kids are where<br/>
they are according to their own needs, not some standard.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Felicia (just turned 10 in August) is having trouble with multiplication and<br/>
&gt; division.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because she has a need in her right now life for multiplication and division<br/>
(a job? love of a particular game or type of puzzle?) and she isn&#39;t up to<br/>
doing what she feels she needs? Or because she&#39;s not performing at some<br/>
grade-level standard?<br/>
<br/>
Again, this is not saying what you&#39;re doing is wrong, only that if you want<br/>
ideas on doing more of the same, other lists (like one that deals with<br/>
eclectic homeschooling) will have *way* more ideas for you than this one.<br/>
