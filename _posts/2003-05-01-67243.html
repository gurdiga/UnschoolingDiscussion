( and I address to Mary, personally, because it this is in regards to her <br/>
post)<br/>
<br/>
When you said&quot; I have no interests that are soley my own&quot;  Did you mean, that <br/>
you have no interests that you do not share with someone else in your family? <br/>
  In other words, there are lots of things you like to do, but at least one <br/>
other person in your family enjoys doing them too?   From what I tried to <br/>
understand from your explanation of your comments, that was how I understood <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that is how it is in my family ( with me).   I tried to think and <br/>
think.. ( and, if we don&#39;t count &quot;alone stuff&quot; like reading, computer time, <br/>
etc) everything I like to do, at least one other person in my family enjoys <br/>
it too.  Even with reading and puter stuff, we will discuss things, share <br/>
things we find interesting, recommend stuff that we thing each other will <br/>
like. I like to sew and do crafts.  My children learned right alongside of me <br/>
as I &quot;done my thing&quot;.  Now, Anna likes to sew too and we do projectst <br/>
together.  Same thing with cooking... Now my children will help me cook or   <br/>
do thier own &quot;projects&quot;   Pretty much everything I enjoy doing, my kids <br/>
joined in with me and began to enjoy them too.  Of course, not every one of <br/>
them likes everything I do.. LOL., but there is usually at least one of them <br/>
that does.   <br/>
<br/>
 When my children were younger, I did go out with the &quot;girls&quot; occasionally.  <br/>
I still do, but now that Anna is older, she enjoys girls night out too, so <br/>
she goes along if she wants to.  If I want to go shopping, or to a movie, or <br/>
out to eat, at least one of my children want to go along, and it&#39;s always <br/>
lots of fun.  When they were younger, I needed more &quot;breaks&quot; from them.   <br/>
Just going out shopping alone for an hour.  Maybe lunch with a friend.. Now, <br/>
I don&#39;t need that because they are so much more independent.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, when I think about it, there are very few interests that my <br/>
family does not share.  Sure, we all have our &quot;special&quot; things.. things that <br/>
we like A LOT more than anyone else in the family, but still , on some level, <br/>
 we all share them.<br/>
<br/>
 For instance, Landon is a sports cracker, or a whip enthusiast.  ( its a <br/>
long story). but, basically, he collects whips and he &quot;performs&quot; with them.  <br/>
( no, no, not in the BDSM way.. lol)  Its a &quot;Western Performing Art&quot; .. also <br/>
considered a Circus Art.   ANYWAY, he is wayyy into his whips.   No one else <br/>
in our family does the whip thing, we can&#39;t crack em like he does.. lol, but <br/>
we do all really enjoy watching him do his routines.  We are enthusiastic <br/>
about his new whips and we will help him target practice or &quot;wrap&quot; us.<br/>
<br/>
 My husband collects and restores vintage bicycles.    Sometimes it kind of <br/>
bugs me   the amount of time he spends with those bikes. lol.. But, Ethan and <br/>
JP really love those bikes too.  Ethan is learning how to restore the bikes <br/>
and lots of mechanical stuff.   We always keep an eye out for bikes for DH to <br/>
add to his collection.  <br/>
<br/>
JP and Ethan like video games.  The rest of us really could care less about <br/>
sitting down and playing games. But, we will watch them play, listen to thier <br/>
&quot;stories&quot; about thier games, and help with technical stuff.    I look up <br/>
cheat codes for them and take them to the &quot;game store&quot;.    JP plays baseball. <br/>
  We go watch him practice, and we go to the games and cheer him on.   We <br/>
play with him at home and help him &quot;practice&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 Anna loves babies and baby sitting.  Little babies are the about the least <br/>
exciting thing to Ethan and JP..  But, they are so proud of thier sister and <br/>
her &quot;jobs&quot;.  Ethan will help Anna babysit for her nieces and nephews just to <br/>
help her out.<br/>
<br/>
So, yeah, everybody has thier own interests ( except me. LOL..) But we all <br/>
share   them in some way. And there are LOTS AND LOTS more things that we all <br/>
enjoy doing together: camping, riding bikes, going to the beach, going to the <br/>
movies, boating, hiking, amusement parks... Gosh, I know there is more.. but <br/>
thats all I can think of right now.  <br/>
<br/>
SO, back to the original question.. lol.. about &quot;sole interests&quot;.  That was <br/>
how I interpretted Marys post.   I may be off base about what she meant.. <br/>
But, when I say, &quot; I don&#39;t have any interests that are solely my own&quot;   <br/>
^^^^^^ all that up there is what I mean.  :-)<br/>

 When you said&quot; I have no interests that are soley my own&quot;  Did you mean,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s exactly it. Plenty of interests and plenty of people here that at<br/>
least one shares them with me. Even my love of medical knowlege is shared<br/>
with my son Joseph. There hasn&#39;t been anything so far that someone here<br/>
does&#39;t like to do or investigate right along with me. I&#39;m sure there will<br/>
come a time when that might happen, but so far no. And yes before children,<br/>
it did happen!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748136811">I really enjoyed reading about your families&#39; interests, Teresa, the bicycles <br/>
and whip-performances and baby interest.  Holly *loves* babies too.<br/>
<br/>
You should post about those things more often.  It was really interesting.<br/>
