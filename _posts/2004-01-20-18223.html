<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359124300">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
I am new on the whole journey of parenting (my dd is only 3 3/4) so of<br/>
course I am new on the unschooling journey as well.  I am interested in<br/>
hearing people&#39;s opinions about how much and what kind of time they spend<br/>
with their kids.  My daughter and I play all day every day.  Obviously we go<br/>
and do stuff, she goes to gymnastics, we see friends etc.  For the most<br/>
part, we are always together.  Right now we like it that way.  She still<br/>
isn&#39;t comfortable going to other people&#39;s houses without my husband or I<br/>
(except to go to my parents&#39; house, she would stay there forever I think)<br/>
but we have people in when we can.  We are lucky that so many of our friends<br/>
are homeschoolers so finding kids during the day time is not a problem.  We<br/>
are definitely the &quot;fun house&quot; and &quot;fun parents&quot; in the neighborhood, kids<br/>
often cry when their parents say it is time to leave.<br/>
<br/>
I have some friends so adamantly subscribe to the &quot;benevolent neglect&quot; form<br/>
of parenting.  They lead their lives, their kids lead their lives (even very<br/>
young ones) and their paths intersect often but are not always together.  On<br/>
the one hand I am often jealous of how independent their kids are.  On the<br/>
other hand there aren&#39;t really any hobbies or jobs that I would rather be<br/>
pursuing.  I keep the house running smoothly and am training for a marathon<br/>
but I don&#39;t have a paying job etc.<br/>
<br/>
Of course these things depend on individuals and their families, I am just<br/>
curious to hear people&#39;s opinions on how much &quot;kid&quot; contact they think is<br/>
necessary/appropriate/desired and how much family time people spend.  Should<br/>
I learn to knit? (hee hee)  My dd will always be an only child, I think that<br/>
is why I think about this so much.  I am also an only but I went to school.<br/>
<br/>
I love this list and can&#39;t wait to hear what you all have to say!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652752180">I can&#39;t wait to hear responses to this thread.  I fall on the opposite end<br/>
of the poster but only recently, as my children have gotten older.  (Now 4<br/>
and 6)  They wake up and literally play ALL day together until midnight<br/>
each night.   For the most part, they don&#39;t want me around for it.  When<br/>
they do, they ask.  It is not that I am off pursuing my own life, my life<br/>
used to revolve around having two young kids close together.  Now they just<br/>
have their own things to do.  During a typical (really no such thing) day,<br/>
we might play a game a cards, read a book, watch a show, help with a<br/>
computer game or go outside together but even with these things the balance<br/>
of their day is spent just playing with each other or friends.  We are the<br/>
&#39;fun house&#39; too the one no one wants to leave.  I think it has to do with<br/>
their not being adults hanging over them directing the play and it is just<br/>
a fun space:)  I find when I do interject myself, uninvited, into their<br/>
play it changes it and not for the better.   So I really just let them lead<br/>
the way and ask for what they need.  I don&#39;t consider this &#39;benevolent<br/>
neglect&#39; but I wonder if an outsider looking in would .  I think there<br/>
might be a perception of they should be &#39;learning&#39; something or be directed<br/>
more.  While it has been a strange transition for me (the hands on 24/7<br/>
life of toddlers and babies), it has also be amazing watching them learn so<br/>
much and grow and change without intervention.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I can&#39;t wait to hear what others think.  On some lists,  I see the<br/>
huge lists of exciting &#39;activities&#39; they do with their children on a daily<br/>
basis and I wonder if I&#39;m missing the boat but we have a peaceful, happy<br/>
life.  I am interested in feed back though.<br/>

&gt; I have some friends so adamantly subscribe to the &quot;benevolent neglect&quot; form<br/>
&gt; of parenting.  They lead their lives, their kids lead their lives (even very<br/>
&gt; young ones) and their paths intersect often but are not always together.  On<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my oldest was an only child for 3 years, I spent most of her waking<br/>
hours with her, too, by her choice (she likes a lot of human contact).<br/>
<br/>
When my younger daughter was born, after Mikey grew up enough to be<br/>
interesting, the two girls became best friends and they neither need nor<br/>
want me involved in their games all the time. So some of the day I spend<br/>
doing things with them, and some I spend doing other things (my own hobbies,<br/>
my home business). Because my husband also works at home, they have him to<br/>
spend time with, too.<br/>
<br/>
People have differing needs and wants in how much time they spend with<br/>
others and how much time they spend alone. Brit rarely enjoys time alone,<br/>
Mikey seems to need it daily.<br/>
<br/>
I take my cue from them, they&#39;re pretty good about letting me know, verbally<br/>
and not, when I&#39;m needed or wanted.<br/>

<br/>
Having come to unschooling from La Leche League and attachment parenting, I <br/>
can&#39;t imagine you could spend too much time with her unless she go to the point <br/>
that she was clearly indicating that she wanted some privacy or distance.<br/>
<br/>
It is interesting, this social pioneering, because most people who stay with <br/>
their kids all day every day figure it will &quot;have to&quot; end when kindergarten or <br/>
first grade kicks in (whichever is compulsory in that area).   In the absence <br/>
of that, there&#39;s just continuation of the same fun stuff, at an ever more <br/>
sophisticated level.<br/>
<br/>
Now that my kids are 12, 14 and 17, sometimes I go hours without being right <br/>
with any of them.  Sometimes I got a whole day with one, most likely Holly.  <br/>
<br/>
I drove Marty to ice skating a while ago, a 40 minute drive each way.  Holly <br/>
went just for the ride.   Tonight when Kirby gets back from karate, he and I <br/>
will watch 24.  That&#39;s our last remaining definite weekly appointment.  Now <br/>
that he drives, I miss the talks we had when I took him to work or to karate.   <br/>
When I was Kirby&#39;s age, though, I was off at college.  So I&#39;m glad for the time <br/>
we do spend together.  (And that hour&#39;s not the only time, but it&#39;s the only <br/>
reserved Kirby-and-mom time with nobody else.)<br/>
<br/>
If it goes gradually from all to occasional over the course of 18 or 20 <br/>
years, that seems to me to be about the right way. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263183998">Along this topic, the last local news story -- on right before the nat&#39;l news I was waiting for -- was about how important it is to eat dinner with your kids every night.  A study showed that kids who have family dinner at least 4 times a week have better social schools, are healthier and apparently happier.  The story went on to say, that if you find you&#39;re too busy to actually cook dinner, it&#39;s okay to pick up something to bring home, but you still really should eat at the table together.   These stories have always rubbed me the wrong way, but I never really thought about why.  We&#39;re not devoted family dinner people -- Gary works late many days, and the boys get hungry before he gets home.  Besides, at the end of the day apart, it&#39;s really nice to have dinner without the kids some days.  With us, it&#39;s more likely to be Friday late dinner, and weekend breakfast.  Gary and I both grew up with family dinner every night -- he as an only child, I as the family cook and housekeeper. <br/>
 Our memories of family dinner aren&#39;t exactly brimming with joy. <br/>
 <br/>
Tonight, I figured out why we&#39;re not dinner devotees.  We don&#39;t have to be!  We spend all kinds of time with the kids.  They sleep with us at least part of the night, we hang out all weekend (no busy soccer weekends here) I&#39;m home with them every day, because they&#39;re not in school, they can stay up late enough to greet Gary when he gets home late.  Who needs a strict dinner routine when you have all day, every day?  Those silly stories are meant for the schoolers who get almost no time with their kids.  Who, as a result of social indoctrination, don&#39;t know how to connect with their kids without instructions from the TV news.  Of course, that&#39;s also the same crowd the commercials about &#39;connect 4 kids.com&#39; pitch to -- yanno, the ones where Mom and Dad grill the kid about SAT questions during dinner, and do stupid puppet shows about Lewis & Clark.  The advertisers -- and other powers that be -- have managed to convince most parents that they aren&#39;t smart enough to care for a pet snail,<br/>
 much less a complicated child!  <br/>
 <br/>
okay, rant over.... sometimes it just hits me so clearly that I can&#39;t believe others don&#39;t see it!<br/>

others, come from a relationship with my children based on meeting their needs, <br/>
attachment parenting.  So both of my boys have been different.  I am there when <br/>
they need me.  That sometimes is high when they are sick or tired.  And of <br/>
course the older they get the less they need me to be directly interacting with <br/>
them.  We do play lots of games together, read, do crafts, go for walks in the <br/>
woods, go hiking, swimming etc.  And I am always with them in that we are <br/>
within shouting distance and they can always come to me with questions and they <br/>
know I will stop quilting, gardening or whatever to come help or answer a <br/>
question or read a book, etc.<br/>
<br/>
For us it all depends on the child, the situation and the day.<br/>

computer has opened up gaming options he didn&#39;t have before. He&#39;s having a<br/>
blast. He calls me up to show me stuff all the time.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I did spend a long time keeping up with Kirby&#39;s progress and discoveries on <br/>
Final Fantasy 10-2 or whatever it is.  And Marty will recite whole long blocks <br/>
of what he&#39;s seen on a talk show or comedy routine.   So they still have that <br/>
urge to show me what they think is cool, at 15 and 17 and that&#39;s pretty sweet.<br/>

&lt;&lt;A study showed that kids who have family dinner at least 4 times a week <br/>
have better social schools, are healthier and apparently happier.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t think that would apply to unschooled children who spend so much more <br/>
time with their parents though!<br/>
