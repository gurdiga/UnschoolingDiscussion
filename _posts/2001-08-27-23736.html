&gt; I was much the same way at my first eclectic support group meeting.  The<br/>
&gt; kids played together, not really paying attention to age or sex and the<br/>
&gt; thing that hit me was that they were talking about literature and math<br/>
&gt; problems and Greek mythology instead of Pokemon and playing with stick guns<br/>
&gt; like the &#39;other&#39; kids at the park.  It was that point that I became<br/>
&gt; comfortable with my choice and decided it was true-homeschooled kids really<br/>
&gt; ARE different!<br/>

Pam, off to enroll Brit in school since she  talks about Pokemon and plays<br/>
with stick guns, and has yet to mention Greek mythology except as relates to<br/>
the Disney version of &quot;Hercules&quot; when she belts out the song, &quot;Bless my<br/>
soul! Herc is on a roll! Person of the week in every Greek Opinion Poll...&quot;</div>

  My 5 year old does the same and has no clue about mythology.  I was simply pointing out how different I found a group of kids that were homeschooled.  I found they fact that they could converse beyond Pokemon and play beyond guns to be an inspiration.  There&#39;s hope.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669942814">I have to agree Pam.  My kids seem like every other kid to me.  Sometimes<br/>
they play great together with all different ages.  Sometimes they only want<br/>
to be talking pre-teen stuff and the toddlers are definitely not invited.<br/>
They watch &quot;A Team&quot;, not National Geographic Channel, read &quot;Harry Potter&quot;,<br/>
not &quot;War and Peace.&quot;  They love each other a lot and occasionally get so<br/>
angry with each other that small scale wars break out.<br/>
<br/>
My kids unschool because I want them to be themselves, not because I want<br/>
them to behave.<br/>
