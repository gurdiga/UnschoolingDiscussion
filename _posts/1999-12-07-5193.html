Subject: Florida unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone unschooling in Florida? I would also love to hear a little about<br/>
how you all achieve an unschooling lifestyle. I love the idea of letting<br/>
the kids create their own learning agenda. <br/>

Florida is the perfect place to unschool, although we&#39;re probably switched around from the sorts of rythms that others in cooler parts of the country establish. Fall and Winter are the seasons we spend almost no time in the house during, and Summer is when we find ourselves cocooning and digging into our books more deeply. :)<br/>
<br/>
In South Florida, where I live, it&#39;s a particularly perfect unschooling environment, because the museums and malls and parks have always got something going to attract touristsy attention...as though tourists are the only one&#39;s seeking culture and history. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In our case, we&#39;re right on the edge of the Everglades National Park, and we&#39;re about 30 minutes from anything and everything else we might want to do or see. <br/>
Also, the libraries often put on shows of their own. It&#39;s easy to break up the monotony (often self-inflicted) when we need to. :)<br/>
<br/>
I have lived in Florida for most of my life, and I didn&#39;t fall in love with the place until we began unschooling. I felt too rushed around to notice the subtle season changes, or the incredible range of plant life. Our family needed a shift in perspective to be able to actively appreciate what had been around us all the time. Unschooling has certainly done that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855749805">.....and then there&#39;s me, over here in SW Florida (Cape Coral, for those <br/>
familiar with the area), who&#39;s a die-hard unschooler - we just call it <br/>
&quot;life&quot;!  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should start our own FL unschooler&#39;s group?  I&#39;m in - just tell me <br/>
when and where and we&#39;ll be there :)<br/>

Nice to know there are some Florida unschoolers here! I enjoyed hearing<br/>
how you unschool.<br/>
