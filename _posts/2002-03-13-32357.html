<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080825586">Has anyone seen the movie &quot;a beautiful mind&quot; ?  It is completely awesome.  I<br/>
especially loved the way the portrayed schizophrenia.  DH ran out<br/>
immediately and bought me the book....completely different than the movie,<br/>
though I found the full blown truth to be even more poigniant, hopeful,  and<br/>
heartwarming than the movie.<br/>
    BTW,  it was amazing and enlightening to know that in the 1940&#39;s at<br/>
Princeton,  the math department used what appears to be a definitive<br/>
unschooling approach.  This was the most revered at for the times...the<br/>
likes of Einstein and other great thinkers had much influence.  The new<br/>
arrivals in the graduate math dept were told that class attendance was<br/>
certainly optional and completely unnecessary.  The only real requirement<br/>
was to be present at afternoon tea,  where they played and invented games,<br/>
and discussed whatever....but the major &#39;problems&#39; in mathematics were a<br/>
natural main force.  This led many participants to amazing publications and<br/>
breakthroughs in their areas of study.<br/>

I also loved the movie A Beautiful Mind and am now enjoying the book even <br/>
more.  <br/>
<br/>
I especially thought of unschooling when they described the scene where John <br/>
Nash was found by a colleague at Princeton in the &quot;tea room.  (I think that&#39;s <br/>
where it was) and how he was just lying on a table looking up at the ceiling <br/>
and humming.<br/>
<br/>
So many times we don&#39;t value the  period of &quot;not doing anything&quot;  John Nash <br/>
and others described in the book seemed to realize that the inactive, <br/>
thoughtful part of the process was indeed the most important.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I read about those &quot;golden times&quot; in education, where the &quot;thinker&quot; <br/>
was still valued about the product with envy.  But then I realize, especially <br/>
through reading about the emotional and mental struggles of many of these <br/>
brilliant people, that those times were also trying and probably not as <br/>
&quot;golden&quot; as I&#39;d like to imagine.<br/>

Thanks for your thoughts on the book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308953625">Hey Caro,<br/>
You picked out a scene/description from the book that I especially loved<br/>
also!  Did you see the Nash interview on 60 minutes....it was horrible!!!<br/>
IMHO  They didn&#39;t let him just talk.  And what&#39;s-his-name interviewer seemed<br/>
quite condescending to John and his son.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  I kept waiting for more.  There was nothing meaty in it at all and <br/>
it seemed to me that John Nash was the one who was trying to lighten it up a <br/>
bit and get a word in edgewise.  Like when he mentioned that his wife really <br/>
probably was as beautiful as the actress who played her.  I thought it was a <br/>
great example of media going into an interview with an agenda and not really <br/>
caring about the people involved.  It was sad, to  me, because with an <br/>
empathetic interviewer, it could have been so great.  But, then again, I <br/>
don&#39;t know if the Nashes put restrictions on what could be talked about.  <br/>
Sometimes that happens, too.  It just seemed so inconsequential to me.  I had <br/>
a million questions to ask John Nash and his wife (and their son, too!) But <br/>
they didn&#39;t hire me to do the interview!  Aw shucks!  Take care...I&#39;m still <br/>
not finished with the book.  I only read in the bathtub until I start to fall <br/>
asleep!<br/>
