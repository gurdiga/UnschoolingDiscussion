<div id="ygrps-yiv-846660498">Oops, the subject line on my last post should have been What to Say?, not <br/>
What to Day?  <br/>
Although that is an interesting play on words considering unschooling, <br/>
because what WILL we do today?  The weather is great, maybe play in the sprinklers <br/>
and water the garden!  <br/>
Too bad for the kids still in public school here (NYS) until the end of the <br/>
month- it&#39;s going to be 90 today and they&#39;ll be in non-air conditioned <br/>
classrooms hoping for escape!<br/>
