<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094831730">I know this is crazy, but I created the unschoolingrecipes email list<br/>
with yahoo a few days ago.<br/>
Then I had problems with my server, and now suddenly I was no longer a<br/>
member of my groups.<br/>
I can&#39;t find unschooling recipes anywhere!<br/>
Does anyone still have the email that I sent out about it?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Ann</div>
