The caseworker is making her attend job search programs.<br/>
Does she now have to give up homeschooling in order to feed her<br/>

<br/>
See if she can get a new caseworker.<br/>
The one I had never gave us any crap about homeschooling and was very <br/>
supportive.<br/>
I suppose it depends what state she&#39;s in though.<br/>
<br/>
I only had to use them for a short time, but I have found that the way you <br/>
get treated and what they expect, varies a LOT with each caseworker.<br/>
Having children under schoolage in the home should make her exempt from the <br/>
work program I would think. Does she have younger ones to use for leverage?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258285252">Hi,<br/>
The welfare dept/food stamps usually requires something like a job search.<br/>
here, in East Prov., RI - every friday, I went to job search training - really it was 2 - 9 women meeting and talking about how hard it is i.e very poor public transportation, no jobs, no cumputer training - etc.<br/>
We needed to fill out a form<br/>
we would list 5 places we went to during the week.<br/>
Usuaslly, I would hit a mall w/ Brianna<br/>
grab 5 applications, fill them out,<br/>
leave them.<br/>
On the state form; there is a place for &quot;outcome&quot;<br/>
I would write in<br/>
Left app. w/ clerk<br/>
or<br/>
will drop off app. next week.<br/>
<br/>
That was it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to realize that the sysytem sucks, but the people usually mean well.<br/>
<br/>
Janis<br/>
