<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034848380">Just about had my tired behind in bed when I had a lightbulb moment. Not ever or now being a christian, I was wondering how I got pulled into this thread. Meaning it was getting to me enough where I responded. It&#39;s not the whole christian thing that did it, or even the idea of prejudice. It&#39;s the whole &quot;if I were&quot; statement. That&#39;s what bothered me. I don&#39;t like when someone does it. Putting oneself in someone else&#39;s place to not understand but to state what they would do (and that usually means it would be better than what is being done already) is not fair.<br/>
<br/>
I can wonder out loud what I would do if I won the lotto, but to think what I would if I were another race or religion or even in a different circumstance is not fair as I see it. I just don&#39;t think anyone can really know what they would do as someone else. <br/>
<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t do it to my kids and don&#39;t like when someone does it to me. I guess maybe because my mom is still really good at that. &quot;Well you know if I were you I would blah blah blah&quot; Does&#39;t have a good taste. And it would feel the same if someone said &quot;if I were a 45 year old mother of 4 living in Florida I would......&quot; Same thing. If it&#39;s for fun, that&#39;s one thing, but to really speculate on what one would do is another.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will all look okay in the morning. It&#39;s a bit late, err.....early here now.<br/>

I don&#39;t see it that way. Whether you were, grew up that way or are<br/>
surrounded by it all the time, you aren&#39;t now. And if you were, you are a<br/>
different person now. To assume for a whole group of people, when we all<br/>
know that ALL of them aren&#39;t the same is what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And I know Christian homeschoolers.  Some visit in our home.  They won&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not imagining that either.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I know christian homeschoolers that do allow unrestricted tv. Haven&#39;t a<br/>
few just spoken up on this list? You know SOME christian homeschoolers like<br/>
that. That&#39;s my point.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So you&#39;re not now and have never been a Christian?<br/>
I have.<br/>
You&#39;re offended?<br/>

I didn&#39;t say I was offended. I said the assumptions bothered me. Doesn&#39;t<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It IS a big deal to us that know we are Christians and KNOW we would never <br/>
buy special rods to beat our children or not allow them to watch certain TV <br/>
Shows or things that like when you say it with such knowing.  As If I were a <br/>
fundamentalist Christian, I would___________.  Like there is no other choice <br/>
and we know there are choices because we live differently every day.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why it was a big deal to us being a Christian IS who we are, we are <br/>
mothers and wives and unschoolers and we love our children and families and <br/>
are NOT the people who dictate every second of their child existence.<br/>
<br/>
So if someone said  &quot;if I were one of those unschoolers, my kids would just <br/>
lay at home and be ignorant because I don&#39;t expose them to anything but the <br/>
home and their family&quot;  There are some people out there that claim to be <br/>
unschooler but yet their kids experience nothing of life and are basically <br/>
uneducated.  I have seen these children.  Two families come to mind, if I <br/>
thought longer about my experiences in the past I might come up with more.<br/>
<br/>
You would most probably be offended, because you are NOT that type of <br/>
unschooler who is completely NOT present with her kids and they sit at home <br/>
and stare at the walls.  And if someone repeatedly talked about this <br/>
particular group of parents by only the term they knew them as &quot;unschoolers&quot; <br/>
you would repeatedly feel like reminding them that not all unschoolers are <br/>
like that.  Some love their children and care that they grow up to be <br/>
productive people and give examples of how your unschooling is as opposed to <br/>
the unschooling that they were talking about.<br/>
<br/>
Unlikely to happen here but it would be the same.  I&#39;m sure if at a <br/>
conference or the grocery store if someone was talking about an unschooling <br/>
group that neglected their children you would just think, oh yes I know about <br/>
those kinds of unschoolers and I&#39;m not that kind and nod and smile as they <br/>
continued telling you how horrible these particular unschooler were?  Using <br/>
the term unschooler interchangeably with what you know to be YOUR unschooling <br/>
methods?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it feels as a Christian to just be lumped in the Christian <br/>
homeschooling group with no distinction and to hear the horror stories.<br/>

<br/>
VERY bad analogy, especially as it almost exactly parallels the example I <br/>
already gave of having (for years) had to separate myself from the <br/>
homeschooling methods of so many Christian homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That&#39;s how it feels as a Christian to just be lumped in the Christian <br/>
homeschooling group with no distinction and to hear the horror stories.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a horror story.<br/>
<br/>
I will quote the beginning of your post:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; My original statement was no big deal and for it to spin off into <br/>
hundreds <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of <br/>

<br/>
The posts about rods of different sizes with names and whipping babies.  The <br/>
posts about women being submissive to men and being abused in the name of <br/>
Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
THOSE horror stories, not watching Dharma and Greg.  You started out stating <br/>
that if you were fundamentalist Christian you wouldn&#39;t allow your child to <br/>
watch a certain show.  Someone else, said hey I&#39;m Christian, I allow it.  <br/>
Then you became to tell about the &quot;Christian homeschoolers&quot; and the things <br/>
you know they do and how the treat their children.  You grouped those who <br/>
don&#39;t watch certain shows with those who do all those horrible things that <br/>
have been talked about in the last couple days.<br/>
<br/>
Others spoke out defending their right to be called a Christian <br/>
homeschooler/unschooler and not be grouped with people who behave that <br/>
radically.<br/>

Oh.<br/>
Well, if you hadn&#39;t made so much noise about not understanding I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have had to show you the bodies.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  You grouped those who <br/>
don&#39;t watch certain shows with those who do all those horrible things that <br/>
have been talked about in the last couple days. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  I said those who are homeschooling because they are fundamentalist <br/>
Christians would have no problem deciding what shows their kids would watch.  <br/>
It would be nothing but Little House on the Prairie or Bonanza.  And I said <br/>
why.<br/>
<br/>
If I were one of them, my choice would be easy.  Holly would not be allowed <br/>
to watch sitcoms where unmarried people have sex (Friends), or where married <br/>
people talk about it (Dharma and Greg).<br/>
<br/>
When you don&#39;t understand something, it&#39;s really okay, sometimes, to just <br/>
listen and think, or to go to google.com and look some things up.<br/>

Are they writing in magazines, speaking at conferences, publishing books, <br/>
holding seminars, and otherwise holding forth their beliefs and practices as <br/>
being TRUE unschooling? If so, they&#39;re as dangerous to me as the actions of <br/>
the Christian Homeschoolers (as opposed to christians who homeschool) and it <br/>
would be important to me as an unschooler to know that these people are out <br/>
there and what they&#39;re doing.<br/>

Maybe so, but do 1100 people have to read it?<br/>

There is journaling.  There is talking to oneself.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;You don&#39;t have to ask a question about EVERYTHING.<br/>
Sometimes read.<br/>
You don&#39;t have to ask your question over and over and over and over.<br/>
Sometimes just think.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes it&#39;s just best to not comment on some posts at all. Especially<br/>
if it&#39;s something someone does that works for them that doesn&#39;t go against<br/>
unschooling and harms no one.<br/>
In unschooling I like to think that sometimes the best word is no word at<br/>
all.<br/>

I would like to imagine that there are other people out there just thrilled<br/>
that someone had the nerve to ask the question they have been wanting to. I<br/>
would give it the benefit of the doubt to think she&#39;s helping someone on<br/>
this list besides herself. And even if it&#39;s just helping one person, isn&#39;t<br/>
that more than none at all? If some posters really bother others, there&#39;s<br/>
the one and only delete key.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read over and over that this is a DISCUSSION group, not a support group, <br/>
not a manual for unschooling group.  A discussion group.<br/>
<br/>
Discussion involves two way communication.  Otherwise you simply sit read and <br/>
get taught someone else&#39;s methods, just like in school, many times not <br/>
knowing the how&#39;s and whys behind the lesson your read about and are trying <br/>
to learn or implement.<br/>
<br/>
Just as I&#39;ve seen here if you don&#39;t want to read it, hit the delete key.  I <br/>
don&#39;t care if some choose to hit delete every time they see my screen name in <br/>
an email. Won&#39;t bother me any.<br/>
<br/>
There are 1100 people here.  I know others are afraid or too intimidated to <br/>
ask something or to then follow it up with a WHY.  I&#39;ve gotten private emails <br/>
too. Doesn&#39;t bother me.  I am in charge or responding or not.<br/>
<br/>
You are in charge of your delete key.  You don&#39;t want to read what I type, <br/>
use it. <br/>
<br/>
I am LEARNING, learning LOTS about unschooling and things that I can do <br/>
better.  I am learning there are groups of people who threaten unschooling.  <br/>
People need to be aware if what they are doing can be taken away.  It&#39;s <br/>
important.  I&#39;m glad I asked.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m learning.  You don&#39;t learn without any feedback.  It might be just my <br/>
learning style but if my child approached me about a subject I would tell <br/>
them go read and read some more, then listen but don&#39;t speak, then after you <br/>
are sure you know everything THEN I&#39;ll listen to what you have to say.  That <br/>
isn&#39;t discussion.  It might be a form of learning but not one I recognize.  <br/>
If my child came to me excited about learning something they KNEW was going <br/>
to make them a better person and change their lives I would want to hear <br/>
about it and if asked, tell they what I thought about this life changing <br/>
thing they had found.  I&#39;d enjoy the experience WITH them, a two way <br/>
interchange.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s just ME.  Reading reading reading and listening might be the way <br/>
to go. but if the reader and listener cannot comment on what she is hearing <br/>
or reading to those who are the experts I&#39;m sure there are going to be <br/>
misinformed and take a lot longer than if she had asked questions.<br/>
<br/>
Use the delete key, I don&#39;t care, I really don&#39;t.  1100 people, some <br/>
questions are bound to be something someone else might want to <br/>
answer/hear/discuss.  If no one is interested, there you go...no discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-521890627">It is nice when people ask questions, but not so nice for the list when <br/>
they start out defending and arguing. Maybe we could skip right to the <br/>
questioning next time?<br/>

  Well, no, but then there is a delete key.  I don&#39;t know but maybe some of the 1100 who don&#39;t necessarily post as often want to read it.  How do we know they don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
  How do we know *they* aren&#39;t learning anything from the discussion?<br/>
