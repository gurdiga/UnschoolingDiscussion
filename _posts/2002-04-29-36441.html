&lt;&lt; One day Marty was furious with Kirby about something, and he got his <br/>
archery <br/>
 equipment, and the first shot was a bull&#39;s eye, and the rest of the quiver <br/>
 hit the target too.  That had to be a satisfying use of adrenaline. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Trevor does this type of thing when angry too. It&#39;s either Archery, BB Gun or <br/>
a stick in the woods.<br/>
He used to take a stick and absolutely TRASH the weeds growing out in our <br/>
woods.<br/>
Now that he has weaponry, he uses that to vent.<br/>
It really helps him to let out his frustration that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you mean the movie wisdom never to attack in anger is WRONG? But it&#39;s<br/>
always true in movies! Whenever they forget that bit they get pummeled.<br/>
<br/>
Or is it only true when they&#39;re *told* that piece of wisdom?<br/>
<br/>
Ah, inductive reasoning has lead me astray. ::: sigh :::<br/>
