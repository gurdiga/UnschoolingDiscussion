<div id="ygrps-yiv-114914291">I have heard of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;d&d, but didn&#39;t know there were other things like that, would it be to old <br/>
&gt;for a 10 and 8 1/2 yr old?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it would be beyond their reach.  You would probably need to<br/>
be their Game/Dungeon Master, until they got more adept, and also to help<br/>
them with rules and the math, etc.  Just don&#39;t make the same mistake that<br/>
my dad did when he started running games for my brother and I at that age.<br/>
It takes time and effort to &quot;roll up&quot; a character (using dice to determine<br/>
statistics.)  Among other things, you must also pick a race (for their<br/>
qualities and abilities,) pick a class (fighter, thief, mage, etc,) make up<br/>
a name, and often a background story to go with the character for more fun<br/>
role playing.  You invest personal feelings into this made up role, as it<br/>
is someone that you might want to be in another reality.  Then my dad would<br/>
throw us against some red dragon or something equally difficult right away<br/>
and we would get killed!!  There goes all the work we put into THAT<br/>
character, have to start over now!  It was very discouraging, and<br/>
completely turned me off to the game for years.  He had some idea about<br/>
teaching us the realities of the game and that we could not take on<br/>
something like that so early on.  But then, being as young as we were, and<br/>
so new to the game, we had no idea we could not take it on.  He should not<br/>
have included such difficult challenges as options at all until we were<br/>
more adept at judging our characters&#39; strengths and weaknesses and what we<br/>
could handle in a fight.<br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to ammend my previous message about game types: MERP (middle<br/>
Earth Role Playing) is the game that is based on the world of the Tolkien<br/>
novels.  GUURP is another fantasy system.</div>

Yes! I love to play but hate to make characters, so when my husband does this <br/>
it is discouraging to me, even now! But the whole gaming thing is great fun <br/>
for the whole family! The old stigma of D&D is hopefully gone forever! May we <br/>
produce a new generation of incredibly creative gamers! :-)<br/>

Thanks and thanks again!  I am going to go looking for this, maybe a <br/>

I know that he has written software to roll up characters, making it much<br/>
easier, but I don&#39;t know if he has any of that listed on his site.  You<br/>
could e-mail and ask him.<br/>
