&gt;Your post was most comforting to my heart.  And yes, <br/>
&gt;&gt;do you all ever get the <br/>
&gt;&gt;impression that so many people think those unschoolers are doing a bad job?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve met the great disapproval of both family members (my SIL is a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>faithful Calvert user and has gone so far to say that unschoolers (without<br/>
using the term unschooler) give homeschooling a bad name) and other hsers<br/>
from other support groups.  Such a shame, it seems to drive division<br/>
between hsers that should not be.  The disapproval is very strong in our<br/>
area between the school at home and the unschooling or even relaxed hsing<br/>
crowd.  Of course, I&#39;ve never known people here in Ohio to be shy about<br/>
what they think is right and wrong - myself included when I&#39;m being honest<br/>
about it. :o)<br/>
