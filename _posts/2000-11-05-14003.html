    I also subscribe to FUN News.  After not receiving an issue in ages, I<br/>
e mailed them to find out what is going on.  They are unfortunately going<br/>
to have to discontinue the subscriptions.  I am not sure it will be for a<br/>
short time or indefinitely.  They have a family member that is seriously<br/>
ill, and all of their time is going to be spent with their family (which I<br/>
agree is as it should be, don&#39;t you?)  :-)  I will miss their magazine, but<br/>
I truly understand and sympathize with them.  <br/>

I too sympathize with their situation, and I did LOVE the newsletter. <br/>
But I sent them money in good faith that I would be getting something in<br/>
return.  Guess I will write to them myself.  Thanks for the info, Tammy!<br/>

     I am not sure what their plans are about that.  I had paid for a 2 yr<br/>
subscription prior to the cancellation.  When I e-mailed them, they said<br/>
that I could get a refund or coupons to get something from their catalog<br/>
for the same price.  So far, however, I haven&#39;t received either one.  I am<br/>
trying to give them the benefit of the doubt right now, though.  I am sure<br/>
that if I were in their shoes, I would forget alot of things right now. <br/>
Going through something like a family member with a serious illness can be<br/>
very traumatic and wearying for the whole family.  I am so scatter-brained<br/>
as it is, I would probably not remember to send refunds right away. (I<br/>
would probably forget to even pay my bills, or make it to certain<br/>
appointments too, but that is just the way I am!)  :-)  I sure hope that<br/>
they plan on sending refunds though, because I would hate to see people<br/>
getting upset or angry about the situation.  Good luck!<br/>

Yes, that must be really tough for them.  I hope things improve soon!  I<br/>
always found the newsletter very motivating and reassuring.<br/>
