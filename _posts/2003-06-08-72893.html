<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071124465">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am new to this list.  My name is Cathy and I have two boys at home and two <br/>
grown up children.  I was wondering if any of you are from NY state.  This <br/>
state is a bit difficult to be an unschooler in, not only in it&#39;s ridiculous <br/>
reporting requirements but with other homeschoolers that school their kids at <br/>
home.  For example there was an article in the paper recently about homeschooling <br/>
profiling a family that&#39;s children work from dawn to dusk on their studies.  <br/>
Might as well send them to school I think if you are going to homeschool like <br/>
that.  My philosophy is that life is education and you can learn whatever you <br/>
really want to learn.  Consequently one of my sons is learning all this stuff <br/>
on the computer, photoshop, Bryce, etc. etc,  making his own movies and <br/>
animations, designing etc, because he wants to.  He also got into clay modeling and <br/>
has built his own tire swing  and the other one is fascinated with snails that <br/>
he found in the backyard that are laying eggs.  You guys know the drill, chi<br/>
ldren love to learn.  But I live in this state where it seems that homeschoolers <br/>
are obsessed with doing school at home.  So I am always the oddball, always <br/>
being creative in my quarterly reports, and consequently have children that <br/>
think  and respond from their own inner persons and not the exterior motivations <br/>
that most want their children to operate from.  I am also a Christian which <br/>
makes me an oddball Christian too, but I think Jesus was the original <br/>
unschooling model and that most Christians operate from rules and not grace.  Anyway, <br/>
are any of you from this state?<br/>
