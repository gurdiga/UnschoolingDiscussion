<div id="ygrps-yiv-110191171">&lt;There must be a name for this syndrome.  I worked at a Perkins restaraunt<br/>
and at a steakhouse.....I do not ever have a desire to eat that again! &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, so I need to work at a restaurant (OK, maybe a kiosk) that only serves<br/>
Thin Mints, Ding Dongs, and cinnamon PopTarts. It would be a race to see<br/>
what shut down first: my appetite or my arteries!<br/>
