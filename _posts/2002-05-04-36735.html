&lt;&lt; If you want to be able to communicate your ideas, you really need<br/>
to know how to write and spell... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When she has ideas she actually wants to communicate, she&#39;ll start getting <br/>
some real practice. <br/>
<br/>
Is she online much?  That&#39;s where my teenaged boys are learning to write--in <br/>
instant messages, role playing games and reading and answering questions <br/>
about video games.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How many of you have unschooled through high school?  I&#39;d like to know how<br/>
you got across the higher maths and sciences...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in the process.  <br/>
<br/>
The ideas and concepts are peppered through their regular lives.  We&#39;re not <br/>
doing &quot;courses,&quot; but as things come up in discussions or in movies or TV or <br/>
whatever, bits and pieces are fitting together.  They have large but <br/>
scattered amounts of scientific vocabulary.  When and if they do &quot;study&quot; one <br/>
field in earnest, it will be a matter of fitting the concepts they already <br/>
have into the formal framework, and learning some more (not ALL of it, not in <br/>
any area I can think of).<br/>
<br/>
Today Holly asked me to come and watch something on PBS with her.  It was a <br/>
part of a series on the brain, dealing with language, and how language is <br/>
relearned after a certain kind of surgery (removing the left hemisphere).  <br/>
<br/>
There was an eight year old being shown as an example of dyslexia.  Their <br/>
proof that he had a serious reading problem was that he was failing to sound <br/>
out long words.  He was eight.  Some of the words were:<br/>
therapeutic<br/>
masculine<br/>
scientific<br/>
inventive<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m sure about the first two; Holly said she saw the other two, and so I <br/>
don&#39;t swear to them, but they&#39;re likely and of the same sort--I just didn&#39;t <br/>
write fast enough.)<br/>
<br/>
Those are not words most eight year olds use.  Words they know, they can <br/>
recognize or figure out.  Not being able to pronounce a word you&#39;ve never <br/>
seen or heard happens to all KINDS of people, at any age.  <br/>
Yosemite<br/>
Persephone<br/>
Hermione (the most common recent...)<br/>
<br/>
By any normal clues or rules, those will NOT be pronounced &quot;correctly&quot; by <br/>
anyone who hasn&#39;t heard them pronounced.  Same with many surnames--the <br/>
pronunciation is passed on verbally, and can&#39;t be deduced by the written word.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, that was something Holly wanted to share with me.  We sat for <br/>
nearly an hour, discussing parts of it during and after, sharing examples she <br/>
knew from some toddlers she has spent a lot of time with, me telling her <br/>
stories of her language acquisition, and her brothers&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
And the show said &quot;Reading never just happens.&quot;  I looked at Holly and she <br/>
kinda smirked.  She knew something scientists don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
Those folks will never see reading just happen, because they won&#39;t leave it <br/>
alone long enough for it to &quot;just&quot; (over the course of a few years) happen.  <br/>
Human speech doesn&#39;t &quot;just happen&quot; either--it takes a few years, but over the <br/>
course of a few years, with supportive feedback and ample opportunity and <br/>
example, it happens.<br/>
