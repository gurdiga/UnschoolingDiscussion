My favourite is plain persimmon. You just let the persimmon go completely soft<br/>
and mushy and disgusting. Then I put them in a bowl, roll up my sleeves and use<br/>
my hands to squish, squash, mash, and pick out the pips and skin. Like playing<br/>
with mud! Then simply spread the mush on the trays.<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s persimmon season here - but only just, so we haven&#39;t yet reached the state<br/>
of engorgement that allows us to leave any to turn to mush yet &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Thanks for sharing the recipe--I didn&#39;t want to support Stretch Island fruit leather forever.  Can you offer some information about your dehydrator?  I&#39;m in the market for one!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very curious about your gingerbread waffles and honey cider sauce as well!<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>

There are also lots of super naturally sweet organic products that might<br/>
appeal until he gets past the refined white sugar withdrawal such as<br/>
dehydrated pears, raisins, fruit leather (recipe follows as I think I<br/>
promised it to someone before my computer crashed).<br/>
<br/>
Gingerbread waffles with honey cider sauce is a really good one for kidlets<br/>
that have a sweet tooth.<br/>
<br/>
We keep &quot;ready to munch&quot; bowls in the fridge-- one with veggies (baby<br/>
carrots, celery sticks, broccoli flowerettes, bell pepper slices, mushrooms,<br/>
etc.) and one with fruit (apple slices, orange slices, kiwi quarters, etc.).<br/>
In a bag we have string cheese and slices of cheese (organic, of course<br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  And then I make up a bunch of these little tiny glass bowls with<br/>
homemade dill dip, ranch dressing, peanut butter and peanut butter and honey<br/>
in them.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve found that when they have helped fix do the shopping and then<br/>
helped fix them they are more inclined to eat them.  We make homemade<br/>
granola and healthy muffins and stuf and they devore them because, in part,<br/>
they are part of the process.  They&#39;ve been either sitting on the counter or<br/>
standing on stools to help since they were old enough to sit unaided.  So,<br/>
they &quot;own&quot; the foods and thus eat things other kids might not.<br/>

Fruit leather recipes:<br/>
<br/>
Pureed fruit can be dried on special, heavy plastic sheets in a dehydrator<br/>
or in your oven. To prepare apples or pears for leather making, wash fruit<br/>
thoroughly, peel and core removing all seeds, puree in a blender or food<br/>
processor until smooth. Mixture should be of pouring consistency. It is<br/>
important to add honey to help keep the leather pliable when dried. If the<br/>
puree is too thick, add liquid to thin. If too tart, add more honey or sugar<br/>
(stevia works, also). Heat apple or pear mixture to 190� F to prevent<br/>
oxidization, cool before pouring onto dehydrator trays. Coat trays with a<br/>
layer of fruit puree about 1/8 inch thick. Dry at 135� F until leathery (use<br/>
lowest oven setting and leave door propped open). Be careful there are no<br/>
moisture pockets. Roll up fruit leather while warm, wrap in plastic and<br/>
store.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also made strawberry, watermelon, peach, plum, fig and date fruit<br/>
leather.<br/>

The recipe is from the Gingerbread Mansion in Ferndale.  I think there are<br/>
shots showing it in Jim Carey&#39;s new movie which was filmed there.  The<br/>
Majestic???<br/>
<br/>
The kidlets make these themselves.  They aren&#39;t as hard as they may look at<br/>
first.  They also like to add raisins to the batter sometimes.<br/>
