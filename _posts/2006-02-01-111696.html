<div id="ygrps-yiv-737063244">&quot;Also, in MY opinion it is an individual decision that families need<br/>
to make based on the maturity level of each child involved.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I agree. Trevor watched his younger siblings at 11 on occasion and did<br/>
great. We talked a lot about safety, he was really into babysitting<br/>
and earing money, we did it for short periods of time only. It worked<br/>
out fine in our family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say it depends entirely on the children and the situation. A five<br/>
year old would be a piece of cake for many 11y.o&#39;s...again, it depends.<br/>
