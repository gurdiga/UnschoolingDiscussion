<div id="ygrps-yiv-246211854">We check out all kinds from the library.  Doonesbury, Far Side, For <br/>
Better or Worse.  Our favorite for the entire family is Calvin and <br/>
Hobbes.  I love the snowmen and little bits of Shakespeare.  <br/>
<br/>
Another great series that combines comic books and a chapter book is <br/>
Captain Underpants.  I found the comics helped my now 10 year learn to <br/>
read.  They are filled with words spelled incorrectly yet the way they <br/>
sound like they should be spelled.  Steven made several of his own <br/>
comics inspired by this series.  If your child enjoys the books, check <br/>
out the website.  It includes a comic book autobiography.  The author <br/>
was told many times by his principal and several teachers that he <br/>
would be a failure in life.  He has written several other series for <br/>
preschoolers that are very funny.  My youngest enjoys his Ricky <br/>
Ricotta series.<br/>
