Thank you for the offer.  I will let Lisa know.  I set up an e-mail<br/>
account for her many months ago, so that she could write to her friends<br/>
who have e-mail.  So far, she isn&#39;t interested in writing/typing.  Would<br/>
rather talk on the phone, but I don&#39;t have a budget for long distance<br/>
calls.  Only checks her e-mail when I remind her.  So it obviously isn&#39;t<br/>
important to her right now!<br/>
<br/>
We did have a &quot;school&quot; experience yesterday.  Babysat for a neighbor and<br/>
drove &quot;E&quot; to school for afternoon kindergarten.  This happens to be<br/>
lunch/recess (40 minutes to do both).  Lisa was able to find some of her<br/>
neighborhood friends and enjoyed being with them for a little while. <br/>
Except that on the field, the boys were chasing the girls and she said<br/>
she didn&#39;t like that.  &quot;E&quot; refused to play on the playground.  He said<br/>
kindergartners are not allowed on the playground when the bigger kids are<br/>
on it.  I had told his mom that we were going to go in early and that I<br/>
would supervise him and my 5 year old, and it was fine with her.  But E<br/>
insisted that he could not be on the playground, even if I was there with<br/>
him.  So he spent 20 minutes standing in line outside his classroom. <br/>
They have a cement courtyard for the kindergarten, with nothing in it.  I<br/>
had brought 2 jump ropes and a ball.  But E didn&#39;t even want to play that<br/>
with us in the courtyard.  He just stood there, waiting.  Another boy in<br/>
line told my dd that she didn&#39;t jump rope very good.  So I offered him a<br/>
turn on the other jump rope, so he could show us how.  He refused.  Our<br/>
little field trip gave us lots to talk about!<br/>
<br/>
Later that same day, we met at a homeschooler&#39;s house for a game of<br/>
kickball.  There were 20 or so kids, from age 12 to 2.  The game was fun,<br/>
and the older kids included and watched out for all the little ones who<br/>
wanted to be part of the game.<br/>

You probably weren&#39;t supposed to be there either.  Having worked at a school, <br/>
I do know all visitors are supposed to report to the principal&#39;s office <br/>
first, and an unenrolled child is probably not supposed to be ANYWHERE in <br/>
interaction with other children.<br/>
<br/>
Charming, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237772929">I suspect that may be the case, but as there are no signs stating<br/>
anything about visitors, I decided to go ahead with my plan, rather than<br/>
ask permission from the school!  There are some 400 kids at this school,<br/>
so the playground supervisors could never recognize who is a<br/>
parent/guardian or not.  Since I was with children, I&#39;m sure they assumed<br/>
that those kids went to that school and I was just dropping them off.  My<br/>
name is on a list as an approved person to pick up &quot;E&quot;, though I doubt<br/>
that allows me to be on school grounds whenever I want!  And yes, it is<br/>
sad to live in a society where we need to be so paranoid about kids being<br/>
safe at school.<br/>
