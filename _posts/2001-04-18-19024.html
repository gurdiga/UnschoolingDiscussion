<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498432672">I would love to ask opinions here about something.........<br/>
<br/>
My kids are 8 and 6 and I let them watch movies some of my friends would<br/>
stroke out over if they knew.  The other night they watched Gladiator and I<br/>
thought that the historical info. they soaked in was well worth the few<br/>
violent scenes.  Now I have more of a problem with shoot em ups and  that<br/>
type of violence but when it comes to war movies and such I overlook a lot.<br/>
Also language doesn&#39;t bother me either, my mother drives me nuts about this<br/>
one, because my kids know what bad words are.....they don&#39;t repeat them just<br/>
because they heard them in a movie.......and I think they would miss out on<br/>
a lot of good movies just because of that.  So yes, my 8 & 6 yo&#39;s have<br/>
watched Aliens, The Patriot, The Matrix, etc...  I just would like to know<br/>
how other people.........especially unschoolers......handle this.  My kids<br/>
don&#39;t have nightmares, they don&#39;t dwell on the violence, they ask questions<br/>
sometimes and we discuss it but then they move on.  So what is the<br/>
problem???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354224724">This is a hard one for me. I know that most parents would probably not agree<br/>
with me on this but tough.. My girls (ages 6 & 3) watch just about everything my<br/>
dh and I watch. In fact, the oldest can hardly wait for &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; to<br/>
come out next month. Both my dh and I answer all their questions, if they have<br/>
any about any movie they watch. We explain to them how movies are made, costumes<br/>
are applied and how cartoons are not real. Neither of the two have nightmares<br/>
that attribute back to any movies so far. Both of their favorites, to date, have<br/>
been any of the Dinosaur related movies (including Jurrassic Park both 1 & 2,<br/>
Godzilla, Godzilla 2000, any of the Land Before Time series, & most recently,<br/>
Disney&#39;s Dinosaur). I try to have all my movies explained in some fashion that<br/>
it becomes a learning process.  My oldest is currently focusing on weather this<br/>
week. We talk about tornadoes and the most popular states for having them, their<br/>
descruction levels, etc. The movie, Twister, is also watched then and discussed.<br/>
We have found several errors already on the movie. Hope this helps.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334123704">As far as the language in the movies:  I gave up trying to shield our guys from it a few years ago when they were still only watching Disney movies.  Besides, my 9 yo learned the infamous &quot;F&quot; word from the neighbor kid and promptly taught it to his 5 yo brother.  I don&#39;t even worry about the language in their movies anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Violence:  Same.  They watched several &#39;children&#39; movies that have children verbally and physically abusing each other and, at least, the implied abuse from adults.  And what about all the dark, dreary violence in the cartoon movies?  <br/>
<br/>
My boys don&#39;t watch horror or the heavy blood and guts, then we don&#39;t watch them either.  Otherwise... The evening news is more sickning.  <br/>
<br/>
The down side:  Words get repeated and sometimes at inappropriate times.  We do what any other parent would do, I guess, I tell them it doesn&#39;t sound nice coming from anyone, no matter their age.  I say the same thing when I slip.  But, like I said, they didn&#39;t learn everything from the movies either.  Also, I wonder if some of their physical aggression towards each other may have been promoted by the shows, but I remember my brothers having knock-down punching battles back when tv was, supposedly, less violent.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like tv (although I love those animal, nature, and geography shows) because it seems so passive and does not challenge thinking, but I don&#39;t think the guys are going to falter in their steps forward because of tv/movies.  I think they are intelligent enough to figure it out and I&#39;m willing to clarify things when needed (ie. the 5 yo needed some explanations with why there were dinosaurs in Jurassic Park if all the dinos were extinct).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357787761">My kids are 8 and 10, and they&#39;re still scared of The<br/>
Wizard of Oz. They just relented and watched ET a<br/>
month ago. So we don&#39;t have the problem of wondering<br/>
if movies they want to see are too violent or sexy or<br/>
whatever. But we don&#39;t have TV, so maybe they&#39;re<br/>
limited exposure to those sorts of images keeps them<br/>
horrified by what we would be horrified by in real<br/>
life. I&#39;m really sensitive myself. I don&#39;t like to<br/>
watch strangers have sex in real life, and I don&#39;t<br/>
like it on the screen. And any violence that would<br/>
scare me in real life bothers me on the screen. That&#39;s<br/>
just us, I suppose. We&#39;re sensitive in lots of ways.<br/>
So sorry, I know I haven&#39;t answered your question, but<br/>
maybe I&#39;ve let you see your friends&#39; point of view. I<br/>
mean, if their kids are sensitive, they might think<br/>
yours are, too, you know?  Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014862324">I have wrestled with this one myself.  I am more lenient on cuss words <br/>
because I don&#39;t find them to be a big deal in movies.  I always think it&#39;s <br/>
amusing that some people who freak out over cuss words have no problem with <br/>
violence in movies.  This sure doesn&#39;t correspond to real life.  Like yours, <br/>
my kids know the words and don&#39;t use them, other than a rare &quot;damn it&quot; from <br/>
my 4 yr old, which he may have picked up from us rather than a movie!<br/>
     I have tended to feel the way you do about violent movies if I felt that <br/>
they had a lot of value...for example, I let Justin, my oldest (almost 17), <br/>
see Cry Freedom when he was about 7 (a very mature 7) and it didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
have any ill effects.  However, in recent years, I have thought that maybe <br/>
our kids are exposed to too much violence in movies, even the ones with a <br/>
good message, and especially the ones where violence ends up to be the only <br/>
solution to the problem in the movie.  I don&#39;t let my younger two see too <br/>
much violence.  <br/>
     In the movies where the violence isn&#39;t being glamorized but is shown to <br/>
be bad, I still want the child to be old enough to understand all that.  And <br/>
even then, I wonder whether we are all rather desensitized to violence from <br/>
seeing so much of it in our movies/tv shows.<br/>
     I have been on both sides of your situation...the one who thinks some <br/>
people would judge me harshly for letting my kids see certain movies and the <br/>
one saying my kids can&#39;t see a certain movie and having the other parents <br/>
think I&#39;m weird for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827266551">I think many people control what their kids watch because they think the<br/>
children can&#39;t handle the info. I am not hard on swears per se, unless I am<br/>
hearing them being repeated. Violence varies by subject matter. If it is<br/>
violence for violences sake, they don&#39;t watch it, but if it really is<br/>
important to the story, we make allowances. I think a blanket statement<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow for common sense of deep thought. We try to teach our children<br/>
to question and think things out.<br/>

<div><font face="HoratioDMed" color="#000080">Kandi..........good point about the 
evening news.&nbsp; I let my children watch Gladiator before I would the 
news!&nbsp; I also think that kids learn a lot of these things through life in 
general, not necessarily movies.&nbsp; I know certain groups maintain that media 
is evil and is the reason our children are so violent but I beg to 
differ.........I think it has more to do with parents who have no&nbsp;interest 
in their kids, seems most of these kids lash out after divorce or after feeling 
like their parents don&#39;t care enough about them to pay attention to what they 
are doing......to me that has a MUCH bigger impact then some show on TV, its 
just that telling parents they are doing a crappy job isn&#39;t as big a news story 
as a kid watches the &quot;Matrix&quot; then goes out and shoots someone.&nbsp; We can&#39;t 
be pissing off our local viewers by telling them they are bad parents, now can 
we????????&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Of course that is another can of worms I&#39;ve 
opened...........I&#39;ll be interested to see the responses to this 
one.</font></div>

<br/>
Same here.<br/>
<br/>
My worst confession is probably this:  My kids all knew Rocky Horror Picture <br/>
Show at a young age, before any of the &quot;interpersonal relationship&quot; were of <br/>
ANY interest to them (they were too little to like kissing or to notice <br/>
romance).  They just liked the music.  It was like a stupid cartoon to them, <br/>
but with good rock&#39;n&#39;roll.<br/>
<br/>
Last month we rented Tank Girl.  Not a light piece of art.  And we were going <br/>
to save it until we didn&#39;t have company, because Holly had a younger girl <br/>
over.  Holly had never seen it, but several times in her life other people <br/>
have said &quot;You&#39;re like Tank Girl!&quot; (as a compliment) and so she had asked if <br/>
we could get it so she could see.  I warned her it was kinda gross, and she <br/>
might not WANT to &quot;be Tank Girl.&quot;   Well...  one of the boys slipped it in <br/>
the VCR.  I was coming calmly toward the situation to subtly get it out or <br/>
turned down since there was a seven year old girl in the room (Holly&#39;s nine).<br/>
<br/>
The dad of the seven year old was there.  She lives with her mom most of the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Miss Seven said &quot;OH! Tank Girl!  I have that movie at home!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh...<br/>
<br/>
My boys (not Holly) have seen all the Mad Max movies.  I am still constrained <br/>
by the advice of my husband and friends against seeing the first one.  I&#39;ve <br/>
seen the next two of them, but still people say &quot;You don&#39;t want to see Road <br/>
Warrior,&quot; and because they know me and love me I say &quot;Okay then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly says the most violent movie she&#39;s ever seen is probably Fight Club.<br/>

would<br/>

<br/>
I think it depends on the child and how they react.  I had to be careful<br/>
with my daughter due to nightmares and my son struggles with aggression<br/>
so viewing violence is NOT a good idea.  He may be able to handle it fine<br/>
when he&#39;s older though.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, at age 6, saw Gremlins and STILL doesn&#39;t like to think about<br/>
it.  LOL  I thought it would just be funny for her, boy was I wrong.  Now<br/>
we discuss the plot and images before hand and I let her decide.  Her two<br/>
biggies are glowing eyes and sinister laughs.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up on all those westerns (Bonanza, Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel,<br/>
Wagon Train, The Big Valley) with all of the fist fights and shooting.  I<br/>
never hit, got in fights and never even THOUGHT of using a gun even<br/>
though they were all around me (uncle and grandfather were gunsmiths). <br/>
On the other hand, ghost and monster movies threw me into a tail spin.<br/>

Excellent point.  Some folks seem to think that if it has &quot;Disney&quot; on the<br/>
cover it&#39;s okay.  I don&#39;t put most Disney stuff on for my little guy.  A<br/>
LOT of animated stuff has violence, dark messages and people calling one<br/>
another rude names.  I don&#39;t like any of it.<br/>
<br/>
When he is old enough to check out his own movies at the library I figure<br/>
he will be old enough to gauge and control his own responses to the<br/>
content.  For now I get what he and I BOTH like.<br/>

scare me in real life bothers me on the screen. That&#39;s<br/>
just us, I suppose. We&#39;re sensitive in lots of ways.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re right about it being how you are.  I was never bothered by<br/>
the fist fights I saw on TV as a child but the one time I saw two adults<br/>
fight in real life I was stupefied.  We were at a miner&#39;s picnic where<br/>
the beer flowed freely, two men went to blows and my mom had to actually<br/>
pick me up to carry me back to our table.  I was frozen in place, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t believe people would actually do that.  I MUST have separated<br/>
what I saw on the TV from real life, when it came to violence at least. <br/>
The line was much more blurred when it came to ghosts and monsters.<br/>
<br/>
As for the sex, I&#39;m not particularly bothered by them but I often fast<br/>
forward through them because I begin to feel like a voyeur.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023333223">We don&#39;t rent movies that have violence in them simply to sell movies or sex<br/>
simply to sell movies or &quot;f&quot; this, &quot;f&quot; that and &quot;f&quot; the other thing simply<br/>
to sell movies.<br/>
<br/>
If the plot would fall apart without the violence (I mean, really how would<br/>
you do a movie on that period in Roman history without the violence in<br/>
Gladiator, have them all sit around sipping tea and discussing what they are<br/>
going to do next?) then I don&#39;t have a problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve gotten a couple accidentally and the kidlets, hubby and I have all<br/>
agreed about them.  We get into them 15 to 20 minutes and someone will get<br/>
up and leave or suggest that we forget and see what is on television.  We<br/>
all find it boring if it is just thrown.  I forget what we were watching a<br/>
couple of weeks ago but youngest kidlet (8 yo) give a big sigh and said<br/>
&quot;This one needs to go in the remind and return pile.&quot;  She then got up and<br/>
went into the other room to watch the Discovery channel.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] violence in movies.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would love to ask opinions here about something.........<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My kids are 8 and 6 and I let them watch movies some of my friends would<br/>
&gt; stroke out over if they knew.  The other night they watched Gladiator and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; thought that the historical info. they soaked in was well worth the few<br/>
&gt; violent scenes.  Now I have more of a problem with shoot em ups and  that<br/>
&gt; type of violence but when it comes to war movies and such I overlook a<br/>
lot.<br/>
&gt; Also language doesn&#39;t bother me either, my mother drives me nuts about<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; one, because my kids know what bad words are.....they don&#39;t repeat them<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; because they heard them in a movie.......and I think they would miss out<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; a lot of good movies just because of that.  So yes, my 8 & 6 yo&#39;s have<br/>
&gt; watched Aliens, The Patriot, The Matrix, etc...  I just would like to know<br/>
&gt; how other people.........especially unschoolers......handle this.  My kids<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have nightmares, they don&#39;t dwell on the violence, they ask<br/>
questions<br/>
&gt; sometimes and we discuss it but then they move on.  So what is the<br/>
&gt; problem???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908609828">I too have always let my kids watch the same movies as we do. 4 kids <br/>
are now adults.  None are fighters -mobsters - or have maimed or <br/>
killed any body!<br/>
My 12yr old dd prefers to watch Grease or dirty dancing to Pulp <br/>
fiction.  Infact she has watched Grease so many times she knows the <br/>
dialoge better than the actors.<br/>
I am the one who hides behind the cushion during a thriller, asking <br/>
dd &quot;whats happening now?&quot;!<br/>
The Sixth Sence i think is the movie that most affected her - she <br/>
slept in our room for several nights.......The most violent film dd <br/>
has ever watched is *Once were Warriors*  a New Zealnd film. My dd <br/>
watches this over and over again.  This movie represents the way my <br/>
dh was brought up..................<br/>

<br>WOW!! You son sounds like a very responsible and insightful young man! Good 
<br>job! :-)
<br>
<br> &nbsp;His reaction sounds like how my sons view things. Recently they witnessed 
<br>the father of a friend (12) chase him around the yard screaming that he was 
<br>going to kill him, while waving a belt (btw....I had a case worker from 
<br>social services here on Monday, because there was an incident of sexual 
<br>misconduct from a boy on our street and she ended up here as part of her 
<br>investigation, since the younger 2 boys played with this boy and she was here 
<br>a month ago and came back to give the 4 boys some materials on sexual abuse 
<br>and to talk about it with them and while she was here I told her about the 
<br>incident, made a formal complaint. I have a &quot;relationship&quot; with social 
<br>services because of the above incident as well as because a neighbor called 
<br>on me because the boys don&#39;t go to school and I cooperated with the case 
<br>worker while she was here, the case was marked unfounded) and my boys could 
<br>not believe that any parent would treat their child like that for being 10 
<br>min. late. It upset them greatly.
<br>
<br>Also..we watch movies as a family which many wouldn&#39;t consider &quot;family 
<br>movies&quot; and my dh and both swear, quite a bit. The boys probably swear around 
<br>their friends but never have around us.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439783087">I feel sick when I see kids hit, too. This woman in<br/>
the grocery store one day, she yanked her kid by the<br/>
braid so hard I think that kid&#39;ll have permanent neck<br/>
problems if she keeps it up.<br/>
<br/>
But, all this talk of violence in movies leads to ask<br/>
what you all think of guns in the house? We don&#39;t have<br/>
guns, but my ex-husband, my kids&#39; dad, is a cop. They<br/>
do NOT play with toy guns because they need to KNOW<br/>
guns are not toys, since he has to have a gun for his<br/>
job. And they aren&#39;t allowed to play at houses with<br/>
guns. Except their own dad&#39;s house. But being a cop,<br/>
he&#39;s seen plenty of kids killed in accidental<br/>
shootings, so he keeps that gun away from where anyone<br/>
can get at it.<br/>
<br/>
I used to ask, when arranging playdates, do you have a<br/>
gun in your house? But now that they&#39;re older and<br/>
arrange their own social lives, more or less, I&#39;ve<br/>
slacked off. And the other day, my daughter came home<br/>
and said that she and Kaylee had been playing Easter<br/>
Egg Hunt at Kaylee&#39;s house. It was the day before<br/>
Easter, and they hid rocks and pretended they were<br/>
eggs. So, Aubrey went to open a cedar chest to look<br/>
for eggs in there, and it was locked. Kaylee said,<br/>
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s where my dad keeps his guns.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my problem. What if it hadn&#39;t been locked?<br/>
Is it always locked? Does Kaylee know where the key<br/>
is? Does Kaylee&#39;s older (and scary) brother know where<br/>
the key is? Are the guns loaded? Are the bullets kept<br/>
locked with the guns? If not, are the bullets lying<br/>
around where kids can get them? If the bullets are<br/>
locked separately, do the kids know where THAT key is?<br/>
<br/>
So I said no more playing at Kaylee&#39;s house. It&#39;s a<br/>
rare thing, anyway. Kaylee&#39;s parents are rarely home,<br/>
and she probably spends more of her waking, out of<br/>
school, hours here than she does there.<br/>
<br/>
I just read a book called Evening News that got me<br/>
thinking about this. In it, a boy accidentally shoots<br/>
his sister when his friend takes out his dad&#39;s gun.<br/>
From a LOCKED drawer. The boy knew where the key was<br/>
hidden. Anyway, the book is about how the family falls<br/>
apart. It&#39;s a good book, but sad. <br/>

  where<br>the key is? Are the guns loaded? Are the bullets kept<br>locked with 
  the guns? If not, are the bullets lying<br>around where kids can get them? If 
  the bullets are<br>locked separately, do the kids know where THAT key 
  is?<br><br>So I said no more playing at Kaylee&#39;s house. It&#39;s a<br>rare thing, 
  anyway. Kaylee&#39;s parents are rarely home,<br>and she probably spends more of 
  her waking, out of<br>school, hours here than she does there.<br><br>I just 
  read a book called Evening News that got me<br>thinking about this. In it, a 
  boy accidentally shoots<br>his sister when his friend takes out his dad&#39;s 
  gun.<br>&gt;From a LOCKED drawer. The boy knew where the key was<br>hidden. 
  Anyway, the book is about how the family falls<br>apart. It&#39;s a good book, but 
  sad. <br><br>Juli<br><br><br>=====<br>You cannot teach a man anything; you can

&gt;   Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] violence in<br/>
&gt; movies.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I feel sick when I see kids hit, too. This woman<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt;   the grocery store one day, she yanked her kid by<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt;   braid so hard I think that kid&#39;ll have permanent<br/>
&gt; neck<br/>
&gt;   problems if she keeps it up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   But, all this talk of violence in movies leads to<br/>
&gt; ask<br/>
&gt;   what you all think of guns in the house? We don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt;   guns, but my ex-husband, my kids&#39; dad, is a cop.<br/>
&gt; They<br/>
&gt;   do NOT play with toy guns because they need to<br/>
&gt; KNOW<br/>
&gt;   guns are not toys, since he has to have a gun for<br/>
&gt; his<br/>
&gt;   job. And they aren&#39;t allowed to play at houses<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt;   guns. Except their own dad&#39;s house. But being a<br/>
&gt; cop,<br/>
&gt;   he&#39;s seen plenty of kids killed in accidental<br/>
&gt;   shootings, so he keeps that gun away from where<br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt;   can get at it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I used to ask, when arranging playdates, do you<br/>
&gt; have a<br/>
&gt;   gun in your house? But now that they&#39;re older and<br/>
&gt;   arrange their own social lives, more or less, I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;   slacked off. And the other day, my daughter came<br/>
&gt; home<br/>
&gt;   and said that she and Kaylee had been playing<br/>
&gt; Easter<br/>
&gt;   Egg Hunt at Kaylee&#39;s house. It was the day before<br/>
&gt;   Easter, and they hid rocks and pretended they were<br/>
&gt;   eggs. So, Aubrey went to open a cedar chest to<br/>
&gt; look<br/>
&gt;   for eggs in there, and it was locked. Kaylee said,<br/>
&gt;   &quot;Oh, that&#39;s where my dad keeps his guns.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So here&#39;s my problem. What if it hadn&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; locked?<br/>
&gt;   Is it always locked? Does Kaylee know where the<br/>
&gt; key<br/>
&gt;   is? Does Kaylee&#39;s older (and scary) brother know<br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt;   the key is? Are the guns loaded? Are the bullets<br/>
&gt; kept<br/>
&gt;   locked with the guns? If not, are the bullets<br/>
&gt; lying<br/>
&gt;   around where kids can get them? If the bullets are<br/>
&gt;   locked separately, do the kids know where THAT key<br/>
&gt; is?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   So I said no more playing at Kaylee&#39;s house. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   rare thing, anyway. Kaylee&#39;s parents are rarely<br/>
&gt; home,<br/>
&gt;   and she probably spends more of her waking, out of<br/>
&gt;   school, hours here than she does there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   I just read a book called Evening News that got me<br/>
&gt;   thinking about this. In it, a boy accidentally<br/>
&gt; shoots<br/>
&gt;   his sister when his friend takes out his dad&#39;s<br/>
&gt; gun.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;From a LOCKED drawer. The boy knew where the key<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt;   hidden. Anyway, the book is about how the family<br/>
&gt; falls<br/>
&gt;   apart. It&#39;s a good book, but sad. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-751012545">As far as the language in the movies: I gave up trying <br/>
to shield our guys from it a few years ago when they <br/>
were still only watching Disney movies. Besides, my 9 <br/>
yo learned the infamous &quot;F&quot; word from the neighbor kid <br/>
and promptly taught it to his 5 yo brother. I don&#39;t <br/>
even worry about the language in their movies anymore.<br/>
<br/>
My kids heard me swear a few weeks ago, along with the <br/>
rest of the folk on the bus, when dd2 fell off the <br/>
seat, and got a bump on the floor... I&#39;ve never had a <br/>
problem with language, and know that because they hear <br/>
it used with vehemence, &#39;in context&#39; they&#39;re less <br/>
likely to say it for the sake of saying it...  <br/>
<br/>
Violence: Same. They watched several &#39;children&#39; <br/>
movies that have children verbally and physically <br/>
abusing each other and, at least, the implied abuse <br/>
from adults. And what about all the dark, dreary <br/>
violence in the cartoon movies? <br/>
<br/>
My boys don&#39;t watch horror or the heavy blood and guts, <br/>
then we don&#39;t watch them either. Otherwise... The <br/>
evening news is more sickning. <br/>
<br/>
I have told my kids that something might be too <br/>
gruesome for them to watch, that&#39;s because I know one <br/>
of mine gets nightmares and really doesn&#39;t like those <br/>
bits, though she watched all the Star Wars films <br/>
recently...  but it&#39;s also because i don&#39;t want to <br/>
answer a ton of questions while I&#39;m watching something <br/>
that I&#39;m trying to keep up with the plot with...  it&#39;s <br/>
a bit dishonest, really...<br/>
<br/>
The down side: Words get repeated and sometimes at <br/>
inappropriate times. We do what any other parent would <br/>
do, I guess, I tell them it doesn&#39;t sound nice coming <br/>
from anyone, no matter their age. I say the same thing <br/>
when I slip. But, like I said, they didn&#39;t learn <br/>
everything from the movies either. Also, I wonder if <br/>
some of their physical aggression towards each other <br/>
may have been promoted by the shows, but I remember my <br/>
brothers having knock-down punching battles back when <br/>
tv was, supposedly, less violent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told mine that some people don&#39;t like hearing such <br/>
things, from anyone, but particularly from children, so <br/>
they don&#39;t say them in front of those people...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like tv (although I love those animal, nature, <br/>
and geography shows) because it seems so passive and <br/>
does not challenge thinking, but I don&#39;t think the guys <br/>
are going to falter in their steps forward because of <br/>
tv/movies. I think they are intelligent enough to <br/>
figure it out and I&#39;m willing to clarify things when <br/>
needed (ie. the 5 yo needed some explanations with why <br/>
there were dinosaurs in Jurassic Park if all the dinos <br/>
were extinct). <br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a big Mad Max fan and I have Road Warrior on tape.....I think its<br/>
&gt; a great movie personally but not at all like the other Mad Max<br/>
&gt; movies....in fact I don&#39;t think they are related.  Now this said, I&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; watch anything with Harrison Ford in it :) Rachel<br/>

  Patriot, The Matrix, etc... <br>I just would like to know how other 
  people.........especially <br>unschoolers......handle this.&nbsp; My kids 
  don&#39;t have nightmares, they don&#39;t <br>dwell on the violence, they ask 
  questions sometimes and we discuss it but <br>then they move on.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &gt;&gt;<br><br>Same here.<br><br>My worst confession is probably this:&nbsp; 
  My kids all knew Rocky Horror Picture <br>Show at a young age, before any of 
  the &quot;interpersonal relationship&quot; were of <br>ANY interest to them (they were 
  too little to like kissing or to notice <br>romance).&nbsp; They just liked 
  the music.&nbsp; It was like a stupid cartoon to them, <br>but with good 
  rock&#39;n&#39;roll.<br><br>Last month we rented Tank Girl.&nbsp; Not a light piece of 
  art.&nbsp; And we were going <br>to save it until we didn&#39;t have company, 
  because Holly had a younger girl <br>over.&nbsp; Holly had never seen it, but 
  several times in her life other people <br>have said &quot;You&#39;re like Tank Girl!&quot; 
  (as a compliment) and so she had asked if <br>we could get it so she could 
  see.&nbsp; I warned her it was kinda gross, and she <br>might not WANT to &quot;be 
  Tank Girl.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...&nbsp; one of the boys slipped it in <br>the 
  VCR.&nbsp; I was coming calmly toward the situation to subtly get it out or 
  <br>turned down since there was a seven year old girl in the room (Holly&#39;s 
  nine).<br><br>The dad of the seven year old was there.&nbsp; She lives with 
  her mom most of the <br>time.<br><br>Miss Seven said &quot;OH! Tank Girl!&nbsp; I 
  have that movie at home!&quot;<br><br>Oh...<br><br>My boys (not Holly) have seen 
  all the Mad Max movies.&nbsp; I am still constrained <br>by the advice of my 
  husband and friends against seeing the first one.&nbsp; I&#39;ve <br>seen the next 
  two of them, but still people say &quot;You don&#39;t want to see Road <br>Warrior,&quot; 
  and because they know me and love me I say &quot;Okay then.&quot;<br><br>Holly says the 
  most violent movie she&#39;s ever seen is probably Fight 
  Club.<br><br>Sandra<br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message
