<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937393338">&quot;I found vague references without history to three kinds of finger crossing:  <br/>
 to purposely tell a lie (like the wedding vows in The Truman Show), for good <br/>
luck (when the wheel&#39;s spinning on a game show) and for time out in a game of <br/>
tag or something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband is involved in an e-mail history/folklore discussion about <br/>
crossing fingers, and its relationship to the sign of the cross (medieval useages) <br/>
and to kings, and to signing with x&#39;s (crosses, was the real intention, and <br/>
people didn&#39;t even always SIGN those, they would just touch (with a thumb, I <br/>
think?) the cross a scribe had made and swear (in the name of the father, son, holy <br/>
spirit,amen) that it was their words or that they agreed to the terms of the <br/>
letter or document.<br/>
<br/>
SO anyway...  <br/>
He wants the Bible verse that excuses people from being honest with <br/>
gentiles?infidels?  and I don&#39;t remember a phrase to find it with.  I was thinking <br/>
&quot;keep faith with&quot; would do it, but it didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even remember if it&#39;s Old Testament (I think it is), and it was <br/>
something about people keeping their word with God&#39;s people (by whatever <br/>
designation), but with the rest, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone know or can remember anything to help us find it, Help!   <br/>
His crowd knows a lot of Norse folklore and military history, but not much <br/>
Bible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172350502">How about Leviticus where it was ok to charge infidels interest but not those of the faith. Or maybe it was in proverbs. I&#39;m trying to remember what they called it.  Stepheny<br/>
