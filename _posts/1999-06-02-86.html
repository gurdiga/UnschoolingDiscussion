<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071854180">Thank you so far for the replies to my post.  I see that feelings inadequecy <br/>
and questioning one&#39;s self seem to always be there..?<br/>
<br/>
The issue of deschooling caught my eye.  here is where I tripped up!  I did <br/>
much of nothing quite often, but in between units or themes of study.  We <br/>
started a foreign language, we have been do Key To math.  I didn&#39;t deschool <br/>
as you say.  I went right to the books!  Would any of you say at this point <br/>
that I would have to take more time off and let the boys roam and explore and <br/>
find there own way?  The best time was had and the most interest has been in <br/>
things that we have done spontaneously without guide and planning.  It seems <br/>
natural to keep this up as it works best (I think they call this unschooling, <br/>
hahahaha).<br/>
<br/>
You know what is truthfully tripping me up about all of this... the very <br/>
small time spent on any one thing?  I showed them how to identify trees, they <br/>
did it for 3 days, then on to something else.  this is OK?  because it is <br/>
this way with everything  ... well almost everything.<br/>
<br/>
More silly questions from a mom in a state of inner-chaos!  Whose children <br/>
are sleeping with no care in the world except caring not to be woken up :-)<br/>
Tanya near Canton Ohio, I am in Lorain County, about an hour away from <br/>
you!!!!!!!  Nice to meet you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810247393">Great to meet you Kim, I think a feild trip with all of us in the area may<br/>
be warrented or maybe a picnic?  sometime that would be great! a chance to<br/>
know we are not alone in this venture and that it will all work out<br/>
eventually! I am just happy to be away from the stress of that school!!!<br/>
(even tho I live right in front of it!!!) but this makes for easy access to<br/>
the playground!!<br/>
my oldest also doesn&#39;t want to be woke up, but she only sleeps till about 9-<br/>
9:30 and I had heard that teens don&#39;t function early in the morning anyway ,<br/>
something about their bodies clocks! when she is most attentive and<br/>
interested in things is late at night 9-12 so I encourage her to read or<br/>
watch stuff on discovery or pbs this works well for her!<br/>

<br/>
I think your second sentence is the answer to your question. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, I do think that you need to deschool... .just need to put the whole idea <br/>
of what becoming educated is on the shelf and reconnet with spontaneity and <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
But then I&#39;m pretty opinionated about this stuff. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

And I think its great.  On days we do have morning activities planned, I let <br/>
them know the night before and they usually are pretty good at adjusting and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382663400">Wow, Tanya, you could be writing about my 10-year old daughter!  She&#39;s a real <br/>
night owl and does her best work after 9p.m., by which time I&#39;m nodding off!  <br/>
We&#39;re very lenient here so she has access to pretty much whatever she needs <br/>
to accomplish whatever project she chooses, even though it&#39;s not what most <br/>
folks consider &quot;school hours&quot;.  She&#39;s up way later than I am every night but <br/>
doesn&#39;t get up until 9:30a.m. or so.  I have my time by myself early in the <br/>
morning.  Everyone&#39;s happy.<br/>

	I had to laugh about the time alone with husband bit.......mine works <br/>
nights so we NEVER have time alone!  But, I guess, after 20 years, 10+ of <br/>
them by ourselves, we&#39;ve had our alone time.  I&#39;m sure it must be difficult <br/>
juggling the schedules of many internal time clocks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to worry -- natural learning often looks like this.  A bit here, a bit <br/>
there, pick it up again in 6 months or a year or 2 years or 20.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that one of the things that schools does wrong is to &quot;overdo&quot; and <br/>
&quot;push&quot; many things -- and children get really bored -- the end result is that <br/>
the children think that the *topic*, whatever it was, is boring, and never <br/>
want anything to do with it again -- or at least not for a looooooong time.  <br/>
So try not to make that mistake.  Children will take in as much as they are <br/>
interested in at the moment about things that are interesting to them.  And <br/>
then the information will stew about in their brain and connect up with other <br/>
things that they are doing and are interested in.  Life and learning is all <br/>
connected.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to see the learning process of a child from the outside -- and <br/>
even for the person who is learning the process is often a mystery.  But I <br/>
must say that 3 days of doing something sounds like plenty from my point of <br/>
view.  An hour or two might be enough.  15 minutes might be enough.  If they <br/>
are doing what interests them, they cannot be stopped from learning.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, sometimes natural learning looks like an obsession on <br/>
something that most people wouldn&#39;t even call &quot;educational.&quot;  I know children <br/>
who seem to eat, sleep, and breath certain &quot;subjects&quot; for weeks upon weeks at <br/>
at time.  And they are loving every minute of it!  This also is natural <br/>
learning and nothing to worry about.  I really and truly think the best guide <br/>
is if the children are happy, content, enjoying themselves, doing things that <br/>
are interesting to them.  If that is true, no need to worry -- they will be <br/>
learning just fine!<br/>

     I really can&#39;t help you, since I did the same thing.  Our unschooling <br/>
usually takes place between a few weeks of unit studies.  Then we get burned <br/>
out and go back to unschooling.  Then uncertainy and guilt set in and we go <br/>
back to unit studies.  I am like a yo yo!  However, I do have my parents <br/>
breathing down my neck.  Being former public school teachers, they make me <br/>
very nervous, and it is not all in my mind.  They are constantly checking up <br/>
on me and asking me and the kids questions.  They have even yelled and <br/>
screamed at me and threatened to &quot;do something about it&quot; and they don&#39;t even <br/>
know we unschool, they just weren&#39;t happy about us not doing enough hours or <br/>
enough books!<br/>
We moved half an hour away and out in the boonies (although that was because <br/>
we wanted some land in the country).  Since we have only been here two weeks, <br/>
and summer vacation has started, I will have to wait until next year to see <br/>
if they still just &quot;show up at my door to check up on me&quot;.<br/>

Was even watching cooking shows on T.V. Always wanted to cook something. (Got <br/>
kind of aggravating when she would come up to me at 10:00p.m. wanting to <br/>
&quot;bake cookies&quot;--Mom is NOT a night-owl). Then she just &quot;dropped&quot; the subject <br/>
of cooking. <br/>
Now, a few weeks later, she seems to want to &quot;pick it up again&quot;. She&#39;s <br/>
learning not just about cooking, but reading and math. Maybe someday soon, <br/>
she will take over ALL the cooking and Mom will get a break! Now if I could <br/>
just get her to get obsessed about doing the dishes...<br/>

     We have tried.  We just moved three weeks ago, so that we were 30 <br/>
minutes away from them, compared to 5 minutes.  Because of my husbands job <br/>
and other commitments, we must stay in this area.  We will see how it goes <br/>
