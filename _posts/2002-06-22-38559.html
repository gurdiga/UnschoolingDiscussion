I called this &quot;some more primary-source unschooling stuff.&quot;  They&#39;re about <br/>
parenting and mindfulness and divergent thinking.<br/>
<br/>
BOOKS TO HELP UNSCHOOLING PARENTS <br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s booklist for 8/18/01 talk on Questioning <br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are some of the books that helped me become the parent I am, with the <br/>
names of chapters listed for inspiration. You can find many books on <br/>
homeschooling nowadays and they&#39;re great, but you might want to read some of <br/>
the philosophy behind some other people&#39;s writings.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t put any John Holt on here, only because I assume all those <br/>
interested in unschooling will have read as much John Holt as they could <br/>
find. So John Holt (Teach your Own, Never too Late, anything else) and:<br/>
<br/>

 The Zen Commandments: Ten Suggestions for a Life of Inner Freedom <br/>
<br/>
A review of the first one, which appears in the second:<br/>
<br/>
This smart, sassy, and idiosyncratic spiritual resource is divided into <br/>
sections on cosmic jokes, sacred nursery rhymes, exploding proverbs, and <br/>
accidental hymns….Sluyter proves to be a subtle and imaginative guide through <br/>
the contemporary world of pop culture, dazzling us with epiphanies….He <br/>
provides fresh takes on faith, devotion, grace, being present, beauty, <br/>
practice, selflessness, forgiveness, simplicity. Like the best spiritual <br/>
teachers, Sluyter lets light in from many angles—in this case, the wisdom of <br/>
Buddhism, Christianity, Taoism and more. Why the Chicken Crossed the Road is <br/>
a surefire demonstration of why play is an essential ingredient in spiritual <br/>
growth.&quot; --Values and Visions</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616603286">I realize this thread is a bit old but wanted to add a<br/>
couple of valuable unschooling resource books.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Without Boundaries:  Consent-based, non-coercive parenting<br/>
and autonomous learning&quot;  by Jan Fortune-Wood<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Doing it their way:  Home Based Education and Autonomous<br/>
Learning&quot;  also by Jan Fortune-Wood<br/>
<br/>
I understand she&#39;s written a third book called &quot;Bound to Be<br/>
Free&quot; but I don&#39;t know anything about that one except what<br/>
is written at the website.  The beginning of the synopsis<br/>
states:  &quot;&#39;Bound to be Free&#39; explores the myth that<br/>
compulsory education is free education, arguing that in fact<br/>
institutionalised education is detrimental to our freedom<br/>
and autonomy, whether as children, parents or members of<br/>
society.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They can be found on the Amazon.uk.co (United Kingdom)<br/>
site.  I think there might be a US distributor but it isn&#39;t<br/>
Amazon and I don&#39;t know who it is.  Here is the URL at the<br/>
Amazon.UK site.<br/>
