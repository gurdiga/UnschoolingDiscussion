<div id="ygrps-yiv-860405882"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One little girls asked all kinds of questions about what we were <br/>
 </span></blockquote>going to do with his stuff and his room. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s best friend, Jacob, died when they were five. Cameron was *very* <br/>
interested in what was going to happen to Jacob. His family was originally from <br/>
Ohio, so I told him that they were flying Jacob up there to bury him. Cameron <br/>
wanted to know *where* Jacob would sit. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
We discussed coffins and the baggage area and dog crates and airplanes. <br/>
<br/>
We discussed burial and &quot;getting fired&quot; (cremated &lt;g&gt;) and burial-at-sea. <br/>
<br/>
Still, when thunder rolls in the summer, he&#39;ll say that Jacob&#39;s bowling <br/>
again! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
