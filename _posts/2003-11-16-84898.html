 </span></blockquote>In an effort to offer support and commiseration and as a response to <br/>
Syndi&#39;s signature quote, I made the comment that I was struggling with both <br/>
unschooling and TCS because the results are so deferred. A parent has to <br/>
let go of the obvious markers and be willing to wait years for results to <br/>
emerge--kind of like the threads on reading or chores.  A child may not <br/>
read at 6, 9, 12, whenever, but we can hope that by not forcing them to <br/>
hate reading that they may discover a love of literature when they&#39;re 30. <br/>
Then again, they may not. Same thing with a &quot;work ethic&quot;: may not happen at <br/>
10, 15 or even 20, but we can hope that when our children grow into <br/>
themselves and have families or responsibilities of their own that the <br/>
modeling we have done will serve them well.<br/>
<br/>
I was not referring to this as a TCS board, but was merely making a <br/>
connection between two different, but overlapping philosophies as I spoke <br/>
about my own situation. You certainly don&#39;t have to do one to do the other, <br/>
but they are very compatible. They have in common an inherent respect for a <br/>
child&#39;s autonomy and the trust that a child will discover her/ his own path <br/>
when given the freedom to do so. They both require a parent to let go of <br/>
traditional models of parenting that are inherently authoritarian and to <br/>
leave behind traditional markers of growth and well-being as defined by <br/>
schools, churches, doctors, whatever form of authority it may be. Not an <br/>
easy thing to do on its own, never mind once you add the expectations of <br/>
extended family members, well-meaning neighbors or congregationalists, <br/>
overly-intrusive school reviewers for those of us who have to deal with <br/>
them, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in reading more about TCS, you may find the <br/>
following website useful: www.takingchildrenseriously.com  Like <br/>
unschooling, it can take a bit of getting used to, a bit of mulling over <br/>
before it begins to make sense. Yet another similarity: people are often <br/>
skeptical and unconvinced (if not downright threatened) by both unschooling <br/>
and TCS when they first hear about it, reacting with disbelief that either <br/>
could ever &quot;really&quot; work.<br/>

It&#39;s not a big deal.  I just didn&#39;t want a new reader to think this was an <br/>
&quot;unschooling and TCS&quot; list, so I clarified.<br/>
