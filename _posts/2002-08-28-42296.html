<div id="ygrps-yiv-451816463">Don&#39;t you think that all of us newbies just need to keep thinking that its(unschooling) is just living life?!  I think that is the hardest part for all of us converted ps people to get our minds around.  Its not seperate.  I think many of you have said it many times and that&#39;s what seems to help me.  Hope that helps Tanya a little.   Kelli<br/>
