into the Mommy-Daddy-Christian realm are often left out a bit. Sometimes in <br/>
not very nice ways. I think that&#39;s what she means by &quot;alternative lifestyle.&quot;<br/>

I actully have more problems with the term &quot;lifestyle.&quot; We unschool, I have a <br/>
job, I have a house that could use some straightening, etc, etc. I happen to <br/>
have a woman partner who supports us financially. Where&#39;s the lifestyle? I <br/>
have a life.<br/>
