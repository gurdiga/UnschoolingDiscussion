<div id="ygrps-yiv-1888862104"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Is it a good idea to keep a journal of what &gt;you and your children do<br/>
&gt;every day - or<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi everyone!  I wanted to comment and share an idea: video journaling.<br/>
<br/>
I keep a journal for ME and I like to brag about what my children are<br/>
learning or doing, when I recognize learning, or WHEN they are learning or<br/>
doing something.    I guess it&#39;s a defensive journal... LOL  I also write<br/>
about my &quot;paradigm shift&quot; from traditional schooling to unschooling, because<br/>
I am still in the SHIFT, you know?  I&#39;m teetering in and out of both mind<br/>
sets?  (I have a degree in elementary ed. so I am tipping the swing-set)<br/>
<br/>
We did something yesterday that I have to share.  We were transferring<br/>
family video footage onto VHS tapes when I realized that we could<br/>
make ------ VIDEO JOURNALS!<br/>
<br/>
I taped my daughter reading a book to the baby.  While she read another<br/>
book, the baby pretended to read.  Then my daughter started showing off her<br/>
artwork.  We now have all this cool stuff on video.  My son came in and<br/>
started to &quot;show off&quot; too.  He went from talking about books he had read to<br/>
doing handstands and tricks on his scooter.  Then I filmed all the kids<br/>
riding their scooters or big wheels in our driveway.  They actually shared<br/>
during the footage, which I made a note of.  hee hee<br/>
<br/>
I think every few weeks we will do this and have an ongoing VIDEO JOURNAL of<br/>
what we are learning and making. I have one tape with about 15 minutes of<br/>
footage so far and I hope to add every few months or when something exciting<br/>
is going on...<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so much fun to watch the kids showing off to the camera.<br/>
