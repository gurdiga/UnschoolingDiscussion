&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 3015<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So my kids have interests...let&#39;s take my 9 year old son for example. He<br/>
&gt; likes rocks. He has collected them since he was little. Since this is<br/>
&gt; something he is interested in, what exactly do I do now? I am waiting for<br/>
&gt; our library to get a book about experiments with rocks (it is checked out<br/>
&gt; at the time). He doesn&#39;t seem interested in reading books about rocks<br/>
&gt; really because most of these are too encyclopedia-like to catch his<br/>
&gt; interest. When it warms up, I plan on taking him rock hunting. Is this<br/>
&gt; along the lines of what I am supposed to be &quot;doing&quot; as an unschooling parent?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Buy some books on rocks and put them on the shelves so that if he wants<br/>
them, they&#39;re there. He might mention something about a rock and you could<br/>
look it up in the book, or on the internet, and tell him what it is.<br/>
<br/>
Buy some cool flat bins, or make a nice planter area outside, where he can<br/>
display his rocks. Offer him paint in case he&#39;d like to paint some, for<br/>
himself or as gifts or to decorate the yard.<br/>
<br/>
See if there are geology videos for rent and watch them so you learn more<br/>
about rocks yourself (if he wants to watch them with you, great! If not, at<br/>
least you&#39;re a little more &quot;up&quot; on his interest).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do all this in one afternoon. &lt;g&gt; And if he isn&#39;t clamoring for rock<br/>
experiments, drop the idea like a hot rock. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to make rocks into school, or learning, or his life&#39;s mission. If<br/>
he likes rocks, pay attention while he talks about them, admire how he<br/>
displays them, tell him what you like about them and let him tell you.<br/>
Suggest any or all of the above ideas and be ready to be told, &quot;nah, not<br/>
interested&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Be respectful of the fact that it&#39;s his thing, not yours, and while you are<br/>
willing and able to help, you are also willing and able to NOT help, or take<br/>
it over and make it yours.<br/>
