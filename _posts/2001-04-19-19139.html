<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050375092">Juli - are we neighbors?  That guy sounds like the fellow across the street.  Last week my husband (who admits he&#39;s not very tactful) went over to talk to the guy about his grandson, who lives with them, and our 9 yo.  First the grandson, 11 yo, PLAYS with a BB gun around his cousins (5, 3, & 1) and our two guys.  The play consist of target practice with no supervision and with the other kids in front of the gun.  When I saw this I called my kids away and the mother to the 3 little ones remarked that she can&#39;t say anything to the 11 yo because he doesn&#39;t lister to her.  Huh?  Forget him, why doesn&#39;t she remove her kids from the situation???  Second, it seems that anytime all these kids are together, including ours, the little ones are always hurt.  Well our 9 yo is no saint and very much a follower of whatever any older boy does and will quickly attach himself to older boys and take up their interests and mannerism (ie.  within a few days of hanging <br/>
out with this kid, he liked the other kids music and wanted to wear baggy pants with his boxers showing; he hates wearing boxers except to bed!)  ????  Maybe someone can give some feedback on this character trait of my son.<br/>
<br/>
Well, back to last week.  My husband goes over to discuss the gun and rough play, and the guy goes wacko on him.  Finally he tells my husband to keep his &quot;heatherns&quot; on our side of the street.  Needless to say, we&#39;re OK with this.  Besides this is the same kid that introduce the &#39;f&#39; word to our sons&#39; vocabularies.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-677524322">Nope, that&#39;s not my guy. His son is more like 16 and<br/>
so zoned out on whatever drugs he does that he<br/>
couldn&#39;t probably pick up a BB gun. I&#39;ve never seen<br/>
kids playing with BB guns before. Wow. I would freak<br/>
out and call the cops if I saw that. How awful that<br/>
you have to live by that guy. Juli<br/>
