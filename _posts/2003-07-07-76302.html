<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Chemistry or supposed &quot;advanced&quot; science for 5yos? I have DK books about<br/>
&gt; Chemistry and a few anatomy books for kids. He&#39;s very interested in those<br/>
&gt; topics and I&#39;d like to burrow deeper but I&#39;m not sure how. We have no science<br/>
&gt; museum or anything like that nearby (we did visit one while on vacation<br/>
&gt; recently - he was in heaven) does anyone have ideas or book recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dover books has several cheap books on kitchen science experiments, life in<br/>
a bucket of dirt, etc.  They&#39;re good ideas for you, though not in a hugely<br/>
kid-friendly format.  The library here had those, plus a couple of<br/>
bright-colored books along the same lines that appealed to my son more.  One<br/>
of them had us make ooblik, which was huge fun.  We kept it until it<br/>
spoiled, which took a LONG time.  I&#39;ll put the recipe below if you&#39;re<br/>
interested.<br/>

<br/>
Ooblik: a substance with properties of both a liquid and a solid.<br/>
<br/>
Dump one box of cornstarch into a shallow pan (cake pan or such).  Add<br/>
water, a little bit at a time, stirring, until it sticks together in a very<br/>
hard to stir mess.  Ditch the spoon, and keep mixing in a little bit more<br/>
water until it is just runny enough to drip from your fingers, yet is firm<br/>
when pressed on in the pan.<br/>
<br/>
Try to hold it!  Slap it in the pan.  It&#39;s fun!<br/>
Tim and I mixed foodcoloring into the water first, so our ooblik was an<br/>
funky shade of greenish purple.</div>
