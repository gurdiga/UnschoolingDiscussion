<div id="ygrps-yiv-842551508">Darwin (10) runs into my kitchen whilst i&#39;m making biscochitos for  <br/>
Christmas presents.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;O&#39;s and E&#39;s&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Awesome, thanks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yay! Darwin just went back and wrote to friends in Switzerland and  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560114476">My MIL moved here from Switzerland when she was 12, she&#39;s 70 now and still has to sound out her U&#39;s and O&#39;s when spelling (writing).  She gave me the example that she would like to spell wonderful, wunderfol!  <br/>
