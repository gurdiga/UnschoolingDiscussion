<div id="ygrps-yiv-921398987">When Dylan was very small we didn&#39;t care if he said please and thank you.<br/>
  I don&#39;t think it bothered anyone who knew him, he wasn&#39;t bossy about<br/>
asking for things.   Sometimes acquaintances though, would do that thing<br/>
I hate, &quot;what&#39;s the magic word?&quot;, but of course, he didn&#39;t know what they<br/>
were wanting from him.   I must have grumbled more than once about it to<br/>
my brother, who simply and quietly told Dylan people just wanted to hear<br/>
&quot;thank you&quot; but a more creative answer would be funny.   So for a while,<br/>
when Dylan was two and three, when someone would ask &quot;what&#39;s the magic<br/>
word?&quot;   he would reply &quot;Abracadabra!&quot;&lt;g&gt;<br/>
Maybe it wasn&#39;t very respectful but at the time it was satisfying.   (for<br/>
me, anyway)<br/>
<br/>
He is a please and thank you and excuse me kid now.<br/>
<br/>
I think you can do the things your kids want AND remind them people will<br/>
feel happier about doing nice things for them if they ask in a nice way. <br/>
(but you have to say it nicely&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Dylan used to have a friend who got swatted a lot.   It was disturbing to<br/>
a kid who wasn&#39;t used to seeing people hit.   Bradey would hit, or try to<br/>
hit when he was mad, too, so I would tell him we weren&#39;t a hitting<br/>
family, we were a lovey family and he couldn&#39;t hit when he was with us.  <br/>
It worked, maybe because he realized no one would be swatting him at our<br/>
house. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could remind your kids you are a polite family when they demand<br/>
something.  &quot;We&#39;re not the bossy family, we&#39;re the polite family&quot; said<br/>
with some humor and sweetness?  <br/>
