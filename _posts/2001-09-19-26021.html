&gt; So I&#39;d hesitate to say that this whole lifestyle comes easier to you than <br/>
&gt; anyone else. I had a homebirth, extended breastfeeding, family bed, relaxed <br/>
&gt; sleep schedule, etc. I have been called more relaxed than a lot of my own <br/>
&gt; family and friends, but I still have more to learn and grow. Unschooling is <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, me too.  But I don&#39;t/didn&#39;t do half the things on this &quot;lifestyle&quot; <br/>
list.  And that&#39;s OK.  It&#39;s not an all-or-nothing, lockstep sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it IS possible to totally separate unschooling from life.  That <br/>
would be contradictory.  But sometimes the life part is more or less <br/>
traditional, as opposed to &quot;alternative,&quot; and we still manage to unschool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t trying to imply all these things had to go together. Bridget had <br/>
stated that letting go was easier for her than others on this list. I was <br/>
only comparing that I too, had followed &#39;off the norm&#39; stuff because it felt <br/>
right and came somewhat naturally. But that it didn&#39;t mean that I was in any <br/>
way advanced over other parents, just a parent who learns and struggles with <br/>
choices. All of my choices, whether they felt right or not, have come up <br/>
against previously held beliefs and notions that I had to challenge, some <br/>
held on stronger than others. <br/>
