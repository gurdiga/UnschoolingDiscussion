<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 Breastfeeding 101: A Definition of Terms:<br/>
<br/>
 1. Boob-Lift = The unconscious lifting of ones breasts to check which<br/>
is<br/>
 fuller. May be done at any time  regardless of where you are or whom<br/>
 you&#39;re talking to, grocery sackers and priests not withstanding.<br/>
<br/>
 2. Nursing Flip = The action of adjusting you and your baby to make<br/>
 ready for nursing. This means moving your tee-shirt off your butt,<br/>
doing<br/>
 the &quot;boob-lift&quot;, putting the baby in the crook of your arm and<br/>
 unlatching your bra, all in about 15 seconds with no attention taken<br/>
 away from your previous task.<br/>
<br/>
 3. Wet-Nurse Syndrome = The unconscious urge to nurse any fussy baby<br/>
you<br/>
 happen to be holding: You may be engaged in casual conversation while<br/>
 holding your neighbor&#39;s baby, she fusses and you do the &quot;nursing flip&quot;,<br/>
 your neighbor looks at you shocked &quot;oh my, she must be hungry&quot; you<br/>
 mumble as you pass her infant back.   *A side-effect of this is the<br/>
 &quot;breastmilk fixes everything&quot; philosophy. You may find yourself using<br/>
 breastmilk for your family&#39;s various wounds: &quot;got a sore, earache or<br/>
 zit? Put some breastmilk on it, that&#39;ll fix it&quot; (least that&#39;s what they<br/>
 say, can&#39;t hurt)<br/>
<br/>
 4. Tittie Wrangling = The acrobatics your toddler does while nursing,<br/>
 including but not limited to flips, headstands, & taffy-pulls, all<br/>
while<br/>
 surrounded by relatives who believe that baby should have been weaned<br/>
 months ago. The benefit of this exercise is that you can now nurse your<br/>
 kid while each of you lie on you backs, side-by-side.<br/>
<br/>
 5. Twiddling = What happens if everyone fails to mention that your baby<br/>
 caressing your other breast while nursing is NOT sweet. Never, never<br/>
let<br/>
 your baby know that you can possibly have two breasts at the same time.<br/>
 Always keep the unused breast covered lest you want your little<br/>
nursling<br/>
 to use it as her favorite toy. This becomes a habit quick, heed our<br/>
 warning.<br/>
<br/>
 6. The Steal = The act of removing your nipple from your<br/>
 already-sleeping baby&#39;s mouth so that you may roll over or sneak out of<br/>
 bed for some midnight internet use. Typically takes 2 or 3 tries to<br/>
 succeeded.<br/>
<br/>
 7. Just a Sip = When your now-walking baby comes to you, lifts your<br/>
 shirt and grabs a drink to refuel him/her for 10 more minutes of play.<br/>
 This helping themselves is a show of independence for them and a show<br/>
of<br/>
 breast for everyone else in the room.<br/>
<br/>
 8. Car Surfing = what you are doing when you strategically hover your<br/>
 breast over the baby&#39;s car seat while daddy drives down the interstate<br/>
 ignoring your butt in the rearview mirror.<br/>
<br/>
 9. *Ecstasy Eyes* = Picture this, baby is screaming at your feet while<br/>
you<br/>
 are talking on the phone, cooking dinner and getting a band-aid for<br/>
your<br/>
 toddler. You finally sit and pick up the baby to nurse and she goes<br/>
from<br/>
 screaming to rolling her eyes to the back of her head in ecstasy in<br/>
only<br/>
 a few seconds.  (Don&#39;t you just love it?)<br/>
<br/>
 10. Kneading = the act of damn near maiming your breast tissue while<br/>
 your adorable (and sharp nailed) little one nurses. This can result in<br/>
 your breast looking like you&#39;ve just nursed a baby kitten.</div>
