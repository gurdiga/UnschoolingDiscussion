&lt;&lt; But seriously, about Santa Claus.  I DID <br/>
believe in him with all my heart, and that made him very real to me.    <br/>
Somehow, my mother played the &quot;Santa&quot; card just right.. lol, and I was never <br/>
left with feelings of being decieved.  I know lots of folks think its not <br/>
right to &quot;lie&quot; to kids about Santa, but to me, it was not a lie, he was <br/>
really REAL as long as I believed in him.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll just throw this out for whatever it&#39;s worth........... The whole lying <br/>
about Santa thing didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t sit right with me either. (How can your kids <br/>
really trust you after lying to them for so long about something?) On the <br/>
other hand, I didn&#39;t want to take away something so fun to a child. (And <br/>
there&#39;s lots of people who trust their parents who lied to them about Santa. <br/>
Maybe if all else is in order, lying about Santa will be *understood*.) <br/>
Soooooo, with all that in mind, this is what I came up with. (It&#39;s a fine <br/>
line, I know, but it sounds good to me, so I&#39;m crossing my fingers it&#39;ll be <br/>
ok. It *feels* like it will be.) Whenever &quot;Santa&quot; comes up in conversation <br/>
(usually around xmas time), I Make Sure to use the word &quot;MAGIC&quot; (as in that&#39;s <br/>
what he is, AND in explaning what/how he does things). (This last xmas, I <br/>
heard from my oldest -8- &quot;I KNOW mommy, he&#39;s Magic&quot; as in I said it one too <br/>
many times I guess &lt;g&gt;.) Sooooo, whenever we talk about &quot;magic&quot;, EXCEPT when <br/>
talking about Santa (like David Copperfield, or things in movies, or the <br/>
magic tricks their Uncle does, or Whatever), I THEN Make Sure to say &quot;magic <br/>
is pretend&quot;. So; whenever &quot;magic&quot; comes up, I say &quot;pretend&quot;, and whenever <br/>
&quot;Santa&quot; comes up, I say &quot;magic&quot;. That way, whenever it comes out that Santa <br/>
doesn&#39;t really exist, it shouldn&#39;t sound so much like a &quot;lie&quot;, because <br/>
they&#39;ve been told all along that &quot;magic is pretend&quot;. I&#39;m even thinking that <br/>
they might even just put two&two together on their own, as in &quot;magic is <br/>
pretend, we know Santa is magic, therefore Santa is pretend&quot; kind-of-thing. <br/>
AND, if/when ever point blank asked, no matter what age, I WILL NOT lie about <br/>
him actually being real. THAT, IMO, is a mistake. I hope all that makes <br/>
sense.  Lara...........</div>

<br/>
We did Santa without lying.  I never said &quot;Santa will come.&quot;  My husband and <br/>
I discussed it when Kirby was little and decided if we could do it without <br/>
lying, we&#39;d go ahead.   <br/>
<br/>
If a kid ever asked straight out something like &quot;Have you ever seen Santa?&quot; <br/>
I&#39;d say &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How does Santa get in?&quot;  I said &quot;My mom used to say he just came in the door <br/>
if you didn&#39;t have a chimney.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once Holly said &quot;Is there really a Santa?&quot;  I said &quot;Well... I always put out <br/>
a stocking when I was little and in the morning there was stuff in it.  <br/>
That&#39;s what *I* know.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes I&#39;d say &quot;What do you hope the answer is?&quot; or something vague <br/>
like that and they would go away thinking.<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting that they didn&#39;t press me harder, but they never did.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, you are right in that sense. I use the word pretend, maybe a little <br/>
different then some. To me illusion IS pretend (though pretend is not always <br/>
illusion), in that pretend means something that&#39;s not real (whether it&#39;s <br/>
something that is actually happening, but appears to be something different <br/>
-like magic tricks or actors acting on TV- OR something that&#39;s not happening <br/>
at all -like Santa coming-). It all falls TO ME under &quot;pretend&quot;, just simply <br/>
because it&#39;s not &quot;real&quot;. Semantics I suppose.    Lara.........</div>

 </span></blockquote>Thats the kind of stuff my Mom always replied.   I never felt betrayed at <br/>
all. BUT I know some folks that did.  A couple of guys come to mind,  both my <br/>
husband and my brother in law ( not his brother, my sisters husband)  were <br/>
VERY disillusioned with thier parents when they found out about Santa.  They <br/>
felt like they had been tricked just to make them &quot;be good&quot;   My husband <br/>
thought, well, if they made Santa Clause up, I guess they also made Jesus up <br/>
to keep me in line. ( yeah, unfortunatetly, a much used tactic to keep kids <br/>
&quot;in line&quot;)<br/>
 See, my parents never threatened that Santa wouldnt come.. or that Santa was <br/>
watching, or that I would get coal, or anything like that.  Santa always came <br/>
and brought great gifts, period.   Sometimes older folks would ask if I had <br/>
been good, if Santa was coming to see me, I thought.. pffft, how ridiculous, <br/>
there is nothing I could do to make Santa not come.   Maybe the all loving, <br/>
all generous notion of Santa and his gifts made  my belief in God and Jesus <br/>
and grace much easier.   I realize more and more how blessed I was (am) for <br/>
having such a great family<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My parents didn&#39;t want to lie to me about Santa clause and I grew up <br/>
knowning the truth about Santa.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done the same thing with my kids.  They always have known that <br/>
Santa is just pretend, as is the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.  I <br/>
just don&#39;t want to lie to them.  I want them to know that when they <br/>
ask me something they will get the full truth.  <br/>
<br/>
We do, however, pretend about Santa.  We visit him at the mall.  My <br/>
dad dresses up like him.  We watch all the Christmas movies and <br/>
sometimes we even leave milk and cookies out.  But it&#39;s all one big <br/>
fun pretend game, and everyone knows it.  My youngest son is <br/>
fascinated by Santa for some reason and play acted Santa a lot at <br/>
Christmas time.  He was Santa, I was the reindeer.  He would hold <br/>
onto my shirt, make me stop behind the couch, climb down the chimney <br/>
(climb over the couch), put a present under the tree, and then come <br/>
and grab onto my shirt again.  He gave me a wedgie whenever I was to <br/>
start or stop. :)  We went to a flea market yesterday and he got a <br/>
Santa Barney movie and we watched it twice today.  I was thinking of <br/>
getting him the little people santa clause set.  He knows it&#39;s <br/>
pretend, just like he knows Barney and Big Bird are pretend, but he <br/>
loves it.  <br/>

I did the same thing with Tara. Her dad would joke around every now and then<br/>
about Santa leaving reindeer poop in her stocking but it was always a joke.<br/>
The thing I had hard time with was Tara was very aware of the disadvantaged<br/>
childrena nd families and how people were collecting for them. She couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand how Santa would forget them or not bring them more things that<br/>
they really needed. She was a tough cookie and way too smart for me!!!<br/>
