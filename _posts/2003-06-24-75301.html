<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476826259">Hi!  Our 3 yr. old dd has had a &quot;curse&quot; of eczema since the fall.  It<br/>
started because she loved taking baths, so she took a couple a day.  At<br/>
the time I thought - why not - I&#39;ll just have a REALLY clean kid.  LOL<br/>
Then the eczema came. <br/>
Since then we have tried all kinds of creams - herbal and otherwise,<br/>
homeopathics, oat baths,,,,etc... most of which helped to a point but<br/>
never got rid of it all together.  We have come to the conclusion that<br/>
it is triggered by something she&#39;s eating.  So far we have noticed<br/>
dairy, strawberries and possibly wheat make her rash worse and ITCHY.<br/>
Has anyone ever had their chid allergy tested?  I don&#39;t know anything<br/>
about the process so any info would be appreciated.,,, how safe and<br/>
accurate is it?  OR has anyone experienced something similar and tested<br/>
by simply eliminating certain foods? (which  we currently doing)  OR if<br/>
anyone has any success with ANYTHING regarding eczema please let me<br/>
know.  Thanks --feel free to contact me offlist if you feel that&#39;s<br/>
easier.  <br/>

p.s. They do put chlorine and fluoride in our town water- gross I know--<br/>
could this be a connection?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731955251">My son had terrible exzema when he was little.  He would sometimes <br/>
have blood on the sheets in the morning because he would scratch it <br/>
open at night.  It ended up being multiple food allergies--dairy, <br/>
wheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies than that <br/>
but we stopped testing after those because eliminating those from his <br/>
diet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also eliminated <br/>
night terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and crying in <br/>
the middle of the night without ever completely waking up, difficult <br/>
to calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a baby (I nursed <br/>
him, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I consumed that <br/>
got passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I would have <br/>
known that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>
<br/>
When we had the food testing done we had emla cream put on his arm, <br/>
which numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so much.  They <br/>
only tested for one food at a time which my allergist believed was a <br/>
more accurate way of doing it.  His little arm would swell so much in <br/>
reaction to each of the foods that they couldn&#39;t test for very many <br/>
foods at a time.<br/>
<br/>
As he got older (4-5 years old), he started having near-anaphylactic <br/>
reactions when he ate certain foods.  Once I felt bad that he <br/>
couldn&#39;t have goodies at a family gathering and let him have birthday <br/>
cake and shrimp fried in butter on the same day.  His throat and lips <br/>
swelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his face.  I <br/>
think benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was very close <br/>
to calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, once when <br/>
he ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he was <br/>
allergic to canteloupe.  These episodes started getting more and more <br/>
frequent, which was getting scary because if he ate the wrong food <br/>
and I didn&#39;t know it, it could be life-threatening!  I worked hard to <br/>
make sure his diet was wheat-free and dairy-free without him feeling <br/>
hurt emotionally over it.  That meant I baked special cake before we <br/>
went to birthday parties, had special cookies on hand to take with us <br/>
when we went places, I spent tons of money on wheat-free, dairy-free <br/>
products that look like what everyone else was eating, etc.  <br/>
Sometimes well-meaning people would give him something without my <br/>
knowledge either because they didn&#39;t believe in food allergies or out <br/>
of ignorance.  (Oh, do graham crackers have wheat in them?  I thought <br/>
they just had graham in them!  duh!)  <br/>
<br/>
Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him of his food <br/>
allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being able to <br/>
breathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being able to eat <br/>
anything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to turn six <br/>
now, and he&#39;s still eating everything.  No exzema, no night terrors, <br/>
no hives, no breathing episodes.  I highly recommend seeing a <br/>
classical homeopath to be treated constitutionally for food allergies-<br/>
-we had tremendous results!  <br/>

One of the treatments we use for eczema is Shea Butter.<br/>
I love it!<br/>
Many babies born on the noethern reservations have eczeme....we sell (at a substantial discount) shea butter to them. My niece was on shots for her eczeme; now she&#39;s very much better.<br/>

Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him of his food<br/>
allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being able to<br/>
breathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being able to eat<br/>
anything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to turn six<br/>
now, and he&#39;s still eating everything.  No exzema, no night terrors,<br/>
no hives, no breathing episodes.  I highly recommend seeing a<br/>
classical homeopath to be treated constitutionally for food allergies-<br/>

  &gt; Hi,<br/>
  &gt; One of the treatments we use for eczema is Shea Butter.<br/>
  &gt; I love it!<br/>
  &gt; Many babies born on the noethern reservations have eczeme....we <br/>
  sell (at a substantial discount) shea butter to them. My niece was on <br/>
  shots for her eczeme; now she&#39;s very much better.<br/>

  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   My son had terrible exzema when he was little.  He would <br/>
  sometimes <br/>
  &gt;   have blood on the sheets in the morning because he would scratch <br/>
  it <br/>
  &gt;   open at night.  It ended up being multiple food allergies--dairy, <br/>
  &gt;   wheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies than <br/>
  that <br/>
  &gt;   but we stopped testing after those because eliminating those from <br/>
  his <br/>
  &gt;   diet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also <br/>
  eliminated <br/>
  &gt;   night terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and crying <br/>
  in <br/>
  &gt;   the middle of the night without ever completely waking up, <br/>
  difficult <br/>
  &gt;   to calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a baby (I <br/>
  nursed <br/>
  &gt;   him, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I consumed <br/>
  that <br/>
  &gt;   got passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I would <br/>
  have <br/>
  &gt;   known that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   When we had the food testing done we had emla cream put on his <br/>
  arm, <br/>
  &gt;   which numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so much.  <br/>
  They <br/>
  &gt;   only tested for one food at a time which my allergist believed <br/>
  was a <br/>
  &gt;   more accurate way of doing it.  His little arm would swell so <br/>
  much in <br/>
  &gt;   reaction to each of the foods that they couldn&#39;t test for very <br/>
  many <br/>
  &gt;   foods at a time.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   As he got older (4-5 years old), he started having near-<br/>
  anaphylactic <br/>
  &gt;   reactions when he ate certain foods.  Once I felt bad that he <br/>
  &gt;   couldn&#39;t have goodies at a family gathering and let him have <br/>
  birthday <br/>
  &gt;   cake and shrimp fried in butter on the same day.  His throat and <br/>
  lips <br/>
  &gt;   swelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his face.  <br/>
  I <br/>
  &gt;   think benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was very <br/>
  close <br/>
  &gt;   to calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, once <br/>
  when <br/>
  &gt;   he ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he was <br/>
  &gt;   allergic to canteloupe.  These episodes started getting more and <br/>
  more <br/>
  &gt;   frequent, which was getting scary because if he ate the wrong <br/>
  food <br/>
  &gt;   and I didn&#39;t know it, it could be life-threatening!  I worked <br/>
  hard to <br/>
  &gt;   make sure his diet was wheat-free and dairy-free without him <br/>
  feeling <br/>
  &gt;   hurt emotionally over it.  That meant I baked special cake before <br/>
  we <br/>
  &gt;   went to birthday parties, had special cookies on hand to take <br/>
  with us <br/>
  &gt;   when we went places, I spent tons of money on wheat-free, dairy-<br/>
  free <br/>
  &gt;   products that look like what everyone else was eating, etc.  <br/>
  &gt;   Sometimes well-meaning people would give him something without my <br/>
  &gt;   knowledge either because they didn&#39;t believe in food allergies or <br/>
  out <br/>
  &gt;   of ignorance.  (Oh, do graham crackers have wheat in them?  I <br/>
  thought <br/>
  &gt;   they just had graham in them!  duh!)  <br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him of his <br/>
  food <br/>
  &gt;   allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being able to <br/>

  &gt;   &gt; Hi!  Our 3 yr. old dd has had a &quot;curse&quot; of eczema since the <br/>
  fall.  <br/>
  &gt;   It<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; started because she loved taking baths, so she took a couple a <br/>
  &gt;   day.  At<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; the time I thought - why not - I&#39;ll just have a REALLY clean <br/>
  kid.  <br/>
  &gt;   LOL<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Then the eczema came. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Since then we have tried all kinds of creams - herbal and <br/>
  otherwise,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; homeopathics, oat baths,,,,etc... most of which helped to a <br/>
  point <br/>
  &gt;   but<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; never got rid of it all together.  We have come to the <br/>
  conclusion <br/>
  &gt;   that<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; it is triggered by something she&#39;s eating.  So far we have <br/>
  noticed<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; dairy, strawberries and possibly wheat make her rash worse and <br/>
  &gt;   ITCHY.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Has anyone ever had their chid allergy tested?  I don&#39;t know <br/>
  &gt;   anything<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; about the process so any info would be appreciated.,,, how safe <br/>
  and<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; accurate is it?  OR has anyone experienced something similar <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt;   tested<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; by simply eliminating certain foods? (which  we currently <br/>
  doing)  <br/>
  &gt;   OR if<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; anyone has any success with ANYTHING regarding eczema please <br/>
  let me<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; know.  Thanks --feel free to contact me offlist if you feel <br/>
  that&#39;s<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; easier.  <br/>

  I <br/>

  &gt;   &gt; could this be a connection?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087674062">She asked me all kinds of questions about him.  I took him to her <br/>
because of his food allergies but a homeopath can&#39;t decide on a <br/>
proper remedy based on one symptom alone.  She asked about his <br/>
sleeping patterns, food likes and dislikes, his personality, <br/>
sensitivies that he has, past sicknesses that he had, etc.  Then she <br/>
gave him a remedy based on the totality of his symptoms.  Homeopaths <br/>
have a big book called a materia medica that they often refer to in <br/>
determining a remedy.   It took several months before she felt he was <br/>
strong enough to try dairy and when he did, he had no reaction and <br/>
hasn&#39;t had a reaction since.  <br/>

  &gt;   &gt; Hi,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; One of the treatments we use for eczema is Shea Butter.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; I love it!<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; Many babies born on the noethern reservations have eczeme....we <br/>
  &gt;   sell (at a substantial discount) shea butter to them. My niece <br/>
  was on <br/>
  &gt;   shots for her eczeme; now she&#39;s very much better.<br/>

  eczema<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   My son had terrible exzema when he was little.  He would <br/>
  &gt;   sometimes <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   have blood on the sheets in the morning because he would <br/>
  scratch <br/>
  &gt;   it <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   open at night.  It ended up being multiple food allergies--<br/>
  dairy, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   wheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies <br/>
  than <br/>
  &gt;   that <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   but we stopped testing after those because eliminating those <br/>
  from <br/>
  &gt;   his <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   diet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also <br/>
  &gt;   eliminated <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   night terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and <br/>
  crying <br/>
  &gt;   in <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   the middle of the night without ever completely waking up, <br/>
  &gt;   difficult <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   to calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a baby <br/>
  (I <br/>
  &gt;   nursed <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   him, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I <br/>
  consumed <br/>
  &gt;   that <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   got passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I would <br/>
  &gt;   have <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   known that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   When we had the food testing done we had emla cream put on <br/>
  his <br/>
  &gt;   arm, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   which numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so <br/>
  much.  <br/>
  &gt;   They <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   only tested for one food at a time which my allergist <br/>
  believed <br/>
  &gt;   was a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   more accurate way of doing it.  His little arm would swell so <br/>
  &gt;   much in <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   reaction to each of the foods that they couldn&#39;t test for <br/>
  very <br/>
  &gt;   many <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   foods at a time.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   As he got older (4-5 years old), he started having near-<br/>
  &gt;   anaphylactic <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   reactions when he ate certain foods.  Once I felt bad that he <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   couldn&#39;t have goodies at a family gathering and let him have <br/>
  &gt;   birthday <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   cake and shrimp fried in butter on the same day.  His throat <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt;   lips <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   swelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his <br/>
  face.  <br/>
  &gt;   I <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   think benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was very <br/>
  &gt;   close <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   to calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, <br/>
  once <br/>
  &gt;   when <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   he ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he was <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   allergic to canteloupe.  These episodes started getting more <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt;   more <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   frequent, which was getting scary because if he ate the wrong <br/>
  &gt;   food <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   and I didn&#39;t know it, it could be life-threatening!  I worked <br/>
  &gt;   hard to <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   make sure his diet was wheat-free and dairy-free without him <br/>
  &gt;   feeling <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   hurt emotionally over it.  That meant I baked special cake <br/>
  before <br/>
  &gt;   we <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   went to birthday parties, had special cookies on hand to take <br/>
  &gt;   with us <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   when we went places, I spent tons of money on wheat-free, <br/>
  dairy-<br/>
  &gt;   free <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   products that look like what everyone else was eating, etc.  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   Sometimes well-meaning people would give him something <br/>
  without my <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   knowledge either because they didn&#39;t believe in food <br/>
  allergies or <br/>
  &gt;   out <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   of ignorance.  (Oh, do graham crackers have wheat in them?  I <br/>
  &gt;   thought <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   they just had graham in them!  duh!)  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him of <br/>
  his <br/>
  &gt;   food <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being <br/>
  able to <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   breathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being able to <br/>
  eat <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   anything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to turn <br/>
  six <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   now, and he&#39;s still eating everything.  No exzema, no night <br/>
  &gt;   terrors, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   no hives, no breathing episodes.  I highly recommend seeing a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   classical homeopath to be treated constitutionally for food <br/>
  &gt;   allergies-<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   -we had tremendous results!  <br/>

certain bath soaps we can use, so I would start there.  He has a corn allergy, <br/>
so we avoid anything with corn in it.  Lost of soaps do.  Disposable diapers <br/>
also have some chemicals that bug him, his diaper rash cleared up when we <br/>
switched to cloth.  <br/>
<br/>
The lotions you are using could also be causing a problem, so read those <br/>
labels too and see if there is one that helps more than others.  We ended up with <br/>
a lot of bubble baths that became my shower gel this way, but it was worth it. <br/>
 Same with sunscreens and bug sprays.<br/>
<br/>
Allergy testing is painful.  We&#39;ve done it twice.  The first time to confirm <br/>
a suspicion of a peanut allergy and the second to see if he was allergic to <br/>
tree nuts (common when you have the peanut allergy).  I hated to put him through <br/>
it, but these are life threatening allergies and we felt we had to know in <br/>
order to protect him.  Still, it wasn&#39;t an easy decision.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps a little.<br/>

    it is triggered by something she&#39;s eating.  So far we have noticed<br/>
  dairy, strawberries and possibly wheat make her rash worse and ITCHY.<br/>
  Has anyone ever had their chid allergy tested?  I don&#39;t know anything<br/>
  about the process so any info would be appreciated.,,, how safe and<br/>
  accurate is it?  OR has anyone experienced something similar and tested by simply eliminating certain foods? (which  we currently doing)  OR if anyone has any success with ANYTHING regarding eczema please let me know.  <br/>

  Do you mean ear drums?  I&#39;m not sure what &quot;drums&quot; are. <br/>

<br/>
  &gt; We use Shea Butter to treat our drums. We used to use Drum Doctor <br/>
  or Neetsfoot Oil - but I&#39;ve found that shea butter works just as well.<br/>

  &gt;   &gt;   I have a tub of shea butter with added vitamin e and I&#39;ve <br/>
  found <br/>
  &gt;   it <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   works great for healing sunburned skin!  Great stuff! <br/>

  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hi,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; One of the treatments we use for eczema is Shea Butter.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; I love it!<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Many babies born on the noethern reservations have <br/>
  eczeme....we <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   sell (at a substantial discount) shea butter to them. My <br/>
  niece <br/>
  &gt;   was on <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   shots for her eczeme; now she&#39;s very much better.<br/>

  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   My son had terrible exzema when he was little.  He would <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   sometimes <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   have blood on the sheets in the morning because he would <br/>
  &gt;   scratch <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   it <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   open at night.  It ended up being multiple food allergies-<br/>
  -<br/>
  &gt;   dairy, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   wheat, and peanuts.  He probably had more  food allergies <br/>
  &gt;   than <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   that <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   but we stopped testing after those because eliminating <br/>
  those <br/>
  &gt;   from <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   his <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   diet eliminated the exzema.  Eliminating those foods also <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   eliminated <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   night terrors he would occasionally get.  (Screaming and <br/>
  &gt;   crying <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   in <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   the middle of the night without ever completely waking <br/>
  up, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   difficult <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   to calm down).  Also related was the colic he had as a <br/>
  baby <br/>
  &gt;   (I <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   nursed <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   him, and drank milk, and he reacted to the dairy that I <br/>
  &gt;   consumed <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   that <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   got passed on to him through my breast milk).  I wish I <br/>
  would <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   have <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   known that while I was nursing him. :(  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   When we had the food testing done we had emla cream put <br/>
  on <br/>
  &gt;   his <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   arm, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   which numbed the arm and kept the testing from hurting so <br/>
  &gt;   much.  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   They <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   only tested for one food at a time which my allergist <br/>
  &gt;   believed <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   was a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   more accurate way of doing it.  His little arm would <br/>
  swell so <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   much in <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   reaction to each of the foods that they couldn&#39;t test for <br/>
  &gt;   very <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   many <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   foods at a time.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   As he got older (4-5 years old), he started having near-<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   anaphylactic <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   reactions when he ate certain foods.  Once I felt bad <br/>
  that he <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   couldn&#39;t have goodies at a family gathering and let him <br/>
  have <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   birthday <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   cake and shrimp fried in butter on the same day.  His <br/>
  throat <br/>
  &gt;   and <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   lips <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   swelled, he had difficulty breathing, he had hives on his <br/>
  &gt;   face.  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   I <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   think benadryl worked, but I had a epi-pen handy and was <br/>
  very <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   close <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   to calling 911. :(  A similar thing happened other times, <br/>
  &gt;   once <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   when <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   he ate a piece of canteloupe, and we hadn&#39;t even known he <br/>
  was <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   allergic to canteloupe.  These episodes started getting <br/>
  more <br/>
  &gt;   and <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   more <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   frequent, which was getting scary because if he ate the <br/>
  wrong <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   food <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   and I didn&#39;t know it, it could be life-threatening!  I <br/>
  worked <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   hard to <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   make sure his diet was wheat-free and dairy-free without <br/>
  him <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   feeling <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   hurt emotionally over it.  That meant I baked special <br/>
  cake <br/>
  &gt;   before <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   we <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   went to birthday parties, had special cookies on hand to <br/>
  take <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   with us <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   when we went places, I spent tons of money on wheat-free, <br/>
  &gt;   dairy-<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   free <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   products that look like what everyone else was eating, <br/>
  etc.  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Sometimes well-meaning people would give him something <br/>
  &gt;   without my <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   knowledge either because they didn&#39;t believe in food <br/>
  &gt;   allergies or <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   out <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   of ignorance.  (Oh, do graham crackers have wheat in <br/>
  them?  I <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   thought <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   they just had graham in them!  duh!)  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt; <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him <br/>
  of <br/>
  &gt;   his <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   food <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being <br/>
  &gt;   able to <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   breathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being <br/>
  able to <br/>
  &gt;   eat <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   anything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to <br/>
  turn <br/>
  &gt;   six <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   now, and he&#39;s still eating everything.  No exzema, no <br/>
  night <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   terrors, <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   no hives, no breathing episodes.  I highly recommend <br/>
  seeing a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   classical homeopath to be treated constitutionally for <br/>
  food <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   allergies-<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   -we had tremendous results!  <br/>

  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Hi!  Our 3 yr. old dd has had a &quot;curse&quot; of eczema since <br/>
  the <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   fall.  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   It<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; started because she loved taking baths, so she took a <br/>
  &gt;   couple a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   day.  At<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; the time I thought - why not - I&#39;ll just have a REALLY <br/>
  &gt;   clean <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   kid.  <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   LOL<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Then the eczema came. <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Since then we have tried all kinds of creams - herbal <br/>
  and <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   otherwise,<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; homeopathics, oat baths,,,,etc... most of which helped <br/>
  to a <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   point <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   but<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; never got rid of it all together.  We have come to the <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   conclusion <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   that<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; it is triggered by something she&#39;s eating.  So far we <br/>
  have <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   noticed<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; dairy, strawberries and possibly wheat make her rash <br/>
  worse <br/>

  how <br/>

  &gt;   &gt;   and <br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   tested<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; by simply eliminating certain foods? (which  we <br/>

type testing.  A simple blood test can be done, takes longer to get the <br/>
results but much less traumatic to the child.  I&#39;d ask about that, sometimes <br/>
insurance companies prefer one method to another but a good doctor will write the <br/>
order in such a way that the insurance company can&#39;t argue with it.<br/>

She asked me all kinds of questions about him.  I took him to her<br/>
because of his food allergies but a homeopath can&#39;t decide on a<br/>
proper remedy based on one symptom alone.  She asked about his<br/>
sleeping patterns, food likes and dislikes, his personality,<br/>
sensitivies that he has, past sicknesses that he had, etc.  Then she<br/>
gave him a remedy based on the totality of his symptoms.  Homeopaths<br/>
have a big book called a materia medica that they often refer to in<br/>
determining a remedy.   It took several months before she felt he was<br/>
strong enough to try dairy and when he did, he had no reaction and<br/>
hasn&#39;t had a reaction since.<br/>

&gt; Then we took him to a homeopath who eventually cured him of his food<br/>
&gt; allergies.  It really was amazing--he went from not being able to<br/>
&gt; breathe from accidental consumption of dairy to being able to eat<br/>
&gt; anything at all.  It was totally amazing!  He&#39;s ready to turn six<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-951617285">Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
The pricking test or the blood test? Either way, it is not going to be <br/>
fun --especially with such a young child.<br/>
<br/>
This topic is dear to me because my oldest, Evan, has 17 allergy <br/>
markers out or 24 that are normally tested. And yes, he does have <br/>
eczema.<br/>
<br/>
Eczema is cause by immunological problems; mostly allergic reactions. <br/>
There is no one allergic trigger to this one --it can be either <br/>
environmental or food related. Still, because there is such synergy <br/>
between food and inhaled allergens (ie, apples vis-a-vis oak pollen) <br/>
that if you eliminate a food and &#39;mark&#39; it, you are actually marking <br/>
several other potential allergens as well.<br/>
<br/>
Evan had chronic asthma, irritable bowel syndrome and eczema when we <br/>
had him tested for allergies. I knew by then that he was allergic to 5 <br/>
different foods (cow dairy, eggs, grass, cats, wheat, soy milk). I <br/>
chose to by-pass the prick test because he was about the same age (if <br/>
not younger) than your daughter and I knew he would not do well with <br/>
many prickings of needles. Also, there can be more false negatives with <br/>
the prick test as opposed to the blood test. Nevertheless it was still <br/>
traumatic --his little arm looked minute next to the needle they used <br/>
for the blood sample. They actually took 2 vials out and used an adult <br/>
sized needle. In our case, though, it made sense --it saved Evan a lot <br/>
of pain and suffering given all the markers that came up on the test.<br/>
<br/>
As immediate treatment of her eczema, that&#39;s for a whole different <br/>
discussion but whatever you do DO NOT USE SOAP OR ANY CLEANSING <br/>
DETERGENTS. If she is very icky after a hard day of play, use either <br/>
baby lotion or a lotion high in lanolin (natural) like Jergens. Skip <br/>
the shampoo and only use conditioner to wash her hair. And make sure <br/>
she takes a sea salt bath at least 2x a week.  Keep her nails short and <br/>
load her skin up on CALENDULA ---ointment is better than the gel <br/>
because it won&#39;t sting her if she has open sores.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on some posting for my blog, so l&#39;ll let you know when I <br/>
post some stuff about this topic on my website.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>
Liza<br/>

<br/>
I did not want to bring back immediately the topic of homeopathy <br/>
because, well, of some past events, but SHARON, I suggest you search <br/>
the archives using homeopathy as a key word. Sheila and I and other <br/>
unschoolers here have posted copiously about the wonders of homeopathy.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, today the kidlets had their tri-monthly checkup <br/>
with Dr Schiller (I live in NYC, for all those looking for a family <br/>
doctor AND homeopath, he&#39;s the real mccoy). Anyhow, Evan is on a year <br/>
long treatment with weekly high doses of Nat Mur. His IBS is <br/>
non-existent, his asthma is under control and the eczema is localized <br/>
to a stubborn patch on his right arm (he used to have it all over his <br/>
body). I cannot sing enough the praises of not just homeopathy but the <br/>
wonder doctor we have. He&#39;s just the bomb. It is soooooo important to <br/>
get somebody who does not only know what they are doing but is <br/>
compassionate as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, don&#39;t give up on homeopathy yet --it does work.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371826688">Alternative research is scientific research too--they&#39;re  just not <br/>
the most popularly held medical theories in America at the moment.  <br/>
Just like alternative education research is just as (more?) <br/>
scientifically based as the more widely accepted theories.  <br/>
<br/>
In my first hand experience, when we stopped eating the things he <br/>
reacted to with the prick test, the problems stopped.  That&#39;s <br/>

I have heard anecdotes about that but have not read any research, no. I <br/>
personally did not want to see him pricked and swollen, so we chose the <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>NONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONONO!<br/>
<br/>
I am sooo sorry --stay away from lanolin. GLYCERIN. You want glycerin <br/>
in the lotion but no, not glycerin soap. Just lotion with glycerin.<br/>
<br/>
All soaps and detergents are made with surfactants; which are defined <br/>
(by the Schumberger Oilfield Glossary) as:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A chemical that acts as a surface active agent. This term encompasses <br/>
&gt; a multitude of materials that function as emulsifiers, dispersants, <br/>
&gt; oil-wetters, water-wetters, foamers and defoamers. The type of <br/>
&gt; surfactant behavior, whether acting as an emulsifier or dispersant or <br/>
&gt; otherwise, depends on the structural groups on the molecule (or <br/>
&gt; mixture of molecules). Hydrophile-lipophile balance (HLB) number helps <br/>
&gt; define the function that a molecular group will perform.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cleansinfg detergents have a high lipophile number; meaning that they <br/>
will attract more oil --in order to give you that squeaky clean <br/>
feeling-- than a hydrophilic surfactant (ie: moisturizer). That&#39;s <br/>
anything with Sodium Lauryl or Laureth Sulfate is not good for <br/>
sensitive, dry or eczema skin. Glycerin is a natural HYDROPHILIC <br/>
surfactant and so, the higher it is in the list of ingredients in a <br/>
lotion, the better it is for your skin. Another route is the oils route <br/>
--basically do what the ancients (was it the Greeks?) did before soap <br/>
was invented --use oil for daily cleansing and either salt or ground <br/>
rice or nutshells for mild exfoliation (and &#39;deeper&#39; cleaning).<br/>
<br/>
I worked at Colgate-Palmolive for 4 years writing a reference manual <br/>
with loads of stuff like this for the Consumer Affairs department. Let <br/>
me just say that I stopped using soap after working at that company. <br/>
They are the makers of Softsoap, Ajax, Colgate Toothpaste, Baby Magic, <br/>
Speed Stick, Dynamo and Palmolive Dishwashing liquid. All of these <br/>
products are made with virtually the same detergents. It&#39;s <br/>
mind-boggling.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I did not want to bring back immediately the topic of homeopathy<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then perhaps I was unclear in the last discussion. And I apologize.<br/>
<br/>
Except for one incident, people here use good judgement about when something<br/>
can be dealt with by the parent and when experts (of whatever kind) should<br/>
be consulted.<br/>
<br/>
But last fall, I suggested *privately* to one person, that people with<br/>
specialized knowledge not be too quick to suggest experts be consulted for<br/>
&quot;ordinary kid behavior&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what everyone else does without anyone pointing it out. It&#39;s common<br/>
sense. She chose to blow it out of proportion and make it public. And it<br/>
turned into a perception that there&#39;re rules about discussing homeopathy.<br/>
<br/>
Most people would not call eczema &quot;ordinary kid behavior&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
To help people understand, the topic last fall (though it began on the<br/>
HEM-Unschooling list it spilled over here) was a boy touching privates when<br/>
not in private circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
*If* the discussion had gone on and it became clear there was more involved<br/>
in the situation than a child just feeling comfortable and forgetting there<br/>
were others around, then it&#39;s natural to offer more suggestions, perhaps<br/>
even experts. People (usually) are pretty good about judging when to suggest<br/>
expert consultation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important that parents feel they can trust themselves and through<br/>
research make better decisions. If a parent feels that something is ordinary<br/>
then they don&#39;t need suggestions right off the bat that experts should be<br/>
consulted because even the most common ordinary things could mean something<br/>
much worse and parents just can&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Is that any clearer?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418925432">I just want to add more strong support for homeopathy and a good naturopath or homeopathic Dr.   Homeopathy continues to help me with Chronic Fatigue, it has enabled my two boys to never go to an allopathic Dr. (except for well check-ups once a yr.) and they have never had strepp, ear infections, any major illnesses. They have had colds or flu once or twice a year and have been healed with the help of homeopathy.  I do think diet is a huge part of their healthy bodies and I would strongly suggest only eating organic, hormone free milk.  It doesn&#39;t taste different.  If anything it is better tasting.  Also, organic berries and grapes are really essential if you can&#39;t do it all organically. <br/>
 <br/>
My DH had terrible eczema as a child and his mother turned to homeopathy and organic food as a result of the regular Dr.s prescriptions not working in any lasting way.  If you use the cortisone or other medical creams then the toxins can&#39;t come out of the body and will eventually have to produce the eczema or other disease again.  A rash is the body&#39;s way of eliminating toxins.  It is a better thing than having it stay in the body and create other more serious repurcussions.<br/>

I did not want to bring back immediately the topic of homeopathy <br/>
because, well, of some past events, but SHARON, I suggest you search <br/>
the archives using homeopathy as a key word. Sheila and I and other <br/>
unschoolers here have posted copiously about the wonders of homeopathy.<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of fact, today the kidlets had their tri-monthly checkup <br/>
with Dr Schiller (I live in NYC, for all those looking for a family <br/>
doctor AND homeopath, he&#39;s the real mccoy). Anyhow, Evan is on a year <br/>
long treatment with weekly high doses of Nat Mur. His IBS is <br/>
non-existent, his asthma is under control and the eczema is localized <br/>
to a stubborn patch on his right arm (he used to have it all over his <br/>
body). I cannot sing enough the praises of not just homeopathy but the <br/>
wonder doctor we have. He&#39;s just the bomb. It is soooooo important to <br/>
get somebody who does not only know what they are doing but is <br/>
compassionate as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, don&#39;t give up on homeopathy yet --it does work.<br/>
