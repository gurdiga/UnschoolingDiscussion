<br/>
OK. There is a conference in Columbia, South Carolina August 22-24, 2003. <br/>
website:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Then Kathryn&#39;s taking over for 2004 in MA. I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll be plastering the <br/>
website as soon as the 2003 conference is over. I just don&#39;t think she&#39;s quite <br/>
that far along yet.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d love to see you here in Columbia!<br/>
