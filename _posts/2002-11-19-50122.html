<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075042681">No, sorry, you all are not invited ;o) but I was hoping that you might give me <br/>
some input on how to handle this situation. <br/>
<br/>
We are planning Jason&#39;s sixth birthday party in a couple of weeks. When making up<br/>
the guest list, I asked if he wanted to invite Samantha (they have known each<br/>
other literally since they were born. Her mom is a friend of mine from college).<br/>
They play wonderfully together, although they have not gotten together as often<br/>
lately because they moved a little further away, plus she is in school full time <br/>
now. Jason said that he did not want her there. I was surprised and asked why.<br/>
He said because she was a girl. I was a little surprised and said &quot;so you<br/>
don&#39;t want any girls at the party?&quot;. He said, well, no it is not that, she just<br/>
isn&#39;t my friend any more. I asked why and he said just because. I then asked what<br/>
about Winnie (one of his friends from our AP playgroup we have known since the kids<br/>
were around 1 yo). He said that he did not want her to come either. That he did not <br/>
want any of his &quot;old&quot; friends.<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that he does not want girls at the party because he had no problem including<br/>
2 other boys that he sees only occasionally who are kids of 2 of my college friends. He<br/>
was invited to their birthday parties, so maybe that makes a difference. Samantha&#39;s<br/>
party is in Jan and I know that Jason will be invited (Samantha tends to have a lot<br/>
of boy friends and talks about Jason quite a bit).<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on handling this? Do I let him decide who he wants to have at his birthday <br/>
party and talk with the other moms about it? Or do I make him do the &quot;right&quot; thing and invite<br/>
the girls.  I don&#39;t think that it would be the end of the world for them to be there, since<br/>
he really does get along fine with them. I have talked with him about how it might make <br/>
Samantha and Winnie feel to be left out. At this point I have asked him to think about it.<br/>
<br/>
I can see arguments for both ways of handling this. What do you all think? I had hoped that<br/>
we would have it easier this year since he is not in preschool and would not have the debates<br/>
about which kids from his class to invite LOL! Ah well....<br/>

I have to agree too,  we&#39;ve had similar issues in our kids circles of friends.  But the friends of mine that understand are really turning out to be my best friends and the ones that think we are &#39;snubbying them&#39; are turning out to be anything but &#39;friends&#39;.  It works out for the best.<br/>
 <br/>
I let my kids invite who &#39;they&#39; want,  usually it surprises me who they pick, it ends up being all ages too.    I am starting to have to limit the numbers tho&#39;  my 5 yr old&#39;s party ended up being huge because she wanted families over, like 10 families, OH BOY,  was that alot of work,   so I can&#39;t do that again. <br/>
 <br/>
Although if it were a bunch of my unschooling buddies from online I&#39;d probably do it again!<br/>
 <br/>
Hey,  there&#39;s that northern conference idea coming into my brain again,  that&#39;s another thread.<br/>

Do more &quot;birthday stuff&quot; with the other family--take them out to eat or <br/>
something, and talk about how big the kids are?<br/>
<br/>
Today, any moment, another family is coming to get Holly and Marty to take <br/>
them ice skating.  They were all three invited to Holly&#39;s party, but only the <br/>
sister of them as able to attend because the others had sports.  There were <br/>
leftover skating tickets, so today&#39;s outing is an extension of Holly&#39;s <br/>
skating party.  Part 2!   Marty&#39;s going because he&#39;s our pro-est skater of <br/>
all (played hockey when he was younger, took all the basic classes up to ice <br/>
dance before he quit), and he&#39;s the &quot;life guard&quot; and coach of the new skaters.<br/>

<br/>
When my kids were younger I was more likely to pressure them to invite kids I <br/>
was worried about.  The older they&#39;ve gotten, the less they&#39;re concerned with <br/>
exactly who&#39;s invited to any one event or activity, because there will be <br/>
others.  <br/>
<br/>
And luckily their other friends seem the same way.  Some years Holly&#39;s <br/>
invited to one kid&#39;s party or another, but not every year to any of them.<br/>
<br/>
So just letting a few years pass peacefully will help, I think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that for me the moral issue is being kind and not hurting a friend&#39;s feelings.<br/>
If he did not get along with Samantha, I most definitely would not even think about<br/>
suggesting that he invite her. But they do get along and they do have fun when they<br/>
get together. There are two boys that he sees even less then Samantha and does not<br/>
really know (their parents and I are college friends and they see each other at <br/>
birthday parties and occasional get togethers) that he had no problem inviting (here<br/>
again the only reason that I suggested that he invite them was because he had been invited<br/>
to their parties a couple of months ago). And what part should rudeness play in making<br/>
the decision of who to invite? Should you invite someone who you do not really know but<br/>
invited you to their party? If he does not invite Samantha, should he go to Samantha&#39;s<br/>
party?<br/>
<br/>
Samantha and he are friends. He enjoys playing with her when they get together. She most<br/>
likely will invite him to her party (in Jan). That is why I have the indecision. I am leaning <br/>
towards getting the two of them together, but even that seems a little weird...I like<br/>
you but not enough to invite you to my birthday party? <br/>
<br/>
I probably will talk this over with Samantha&#39;s mom (we are close enough friends) but I <br/>
want to have things a little more firm in my head before I do. Geesh. I thought that<br/>
I was done with these should we invite/shouldn&#39;t we invite situations since we were not<br/>
in school!<br/>
<br/>
I think that I will plan on mentioning to my friends (the moms of the two boys who<br/>
are invited) to not feel like they need to invite Jason to their party the next year.<br/>
Really the only reason that Jason is invited is because we parents are friends. That<br/>
at least will simplify that aspect. We&#39;ll have to see how things go with Samantha this <br/>
year and if they stay friends I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping me work some of this out in my head, even though I am still not completely<br/>
sure which way to go...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730911784">My son, who&#39;s best friend is his sister, wants a boy party.  My dd, who has<br/>
several boys that are friends, has had girl parties these past two years.  She<br/>
gets along great with these boys, they have lots of fun and have been friends<br/>
for years (longer than her gf&#39;s).  I think its might just be a gender <br/>

thing.  My son really enjoys his boy scouts, its just him and the other boys.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want the rest of us there (including mom, his dad usually takes<br/>
him).  My son did say the last two times he had a sleepover with his best<br/>
buddy that it wasn&#39;t as fun when his sister wasn&#39;t there (she is the leader/<br/>
story creator etc.)  I think its natural to want to spend time with those of <br/>
the<br/>
same sex. As much as I adore my husband, I love my coffee night with the <br/>
girls!<br/>
Just some of my thoughts on the subject.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s possible she&#39;ll want to have an all-girls&#39; party one of these years and <br/>
it won&#39;t be personal.<br/>
<br/>
If you make him invite people he doesn&#39;t want to, it&#39;s not his party anymore, <br/>
it&#39;s yours.<br/>
<br/>
Doing more than one thing for a birthday isn&#39;t crazy.  Adults do it lots.  <br/>
Why shouldn&#39;t kids?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We&#39;ll have to see how things go with Samantha this <br/>
year and if they stay friends I guess.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kid have friends they&#39;ve had since they were babies.  Some years there&#39;s <br/>
no contact at all, other years lots.  The best friends are those you can pick <br/>
up with where you left off whether after a month or three years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296065037">I&#39;ve been pretty busy lately, among other things planning a<br/>
Christmas cookie decorating party with out 6 y.o. for her<br/>
friends, but I have noticed the party discussion and thought it<br/>
was interesting.  A party is a party - a gift of pleasure you<br/>
give your friends - an organic whole designed to delight and<br/>
divert a group.  Maybe if you only have one party a year, you are<br/>
trying to make it into more than it is.  We try to have at least<br/>
3 or 4; they are fun and the multiplicity removes some of the<br/>
birthday party/parties are shakedowns message.<br/>
<br/>
Our 6 has a good friend who cannot have sugar - she will not be<br/>
invited to the cookie decorating party, because the whole thing<br/>
will be a sticky mess of frostings and sprinkles and gum drops.<br/>
She did come to the &quot;state fair&quot; party we had in August; though<br/>
there were lots of sugar containing things, there was also<br/>
popcorn and corn dogs and a big bowl of apples all of which the<br/>
friend loves and can have.   We had a doll&#39;s tea party - bring<br/>
your doll, your long fake pearls, and your Mom for a tea party -<br/>
no boys at that one.  Last year we had a Pumpkin party the<br/>
weekend before Halloween (lemme tell you, give a kid his own $3<br/>
pumpkin to paint, with some feathers and stuff - you are in<br/>
higher standing than Santa Claus).  Boys and girls galore!  When<br/>
Barbie Nutcracker came out, we had an all girl sleep over, with<br/>
glamour make-up and manicures.   Gender equality is well and<br/>
good, but you don&#39;t feel obligated to give his female friends<br/>
pistols or his male friends tutus.<br/>
<br/>
Your son will make some mistakes - no doubt you have a few<br/>
lovingly created Mother&#39;s day cards or similar mementos that with<br/>
an adult hand over hand doing it &quot;with&quot; him would have been more<br/>
professional - but they would not have expressed himself.  Let<br/>
him learn the joy of generosity in entertaining without phantoms<br/>
of guilt or fear that there is a deep question - he&#39;ll become<br/>
afraid of making the wrong &quot;moral&quot; decision.<br/>

Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] FW: Birthday party invites...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
| &gt;&gt;I would never make mine invite someone to a birthday party<br/>
either. I think<br/>
| &gt;&gt;&quot;doing the right thing&quot; is more about moral issues. Its sad<br/>
if kids feelings<br/>
| &gt;&gt;get hurt but from the situation that might not be the case.<br/>
And if it is the<br/>
| &gt;&gt;case what a great opportunity for her mom to tell her that<br/>
&#39;its not about<br/>
| &gt;&gt;her&#39; but about how your Son is feeling.<br/>
|<br/>
| I think that for me the moral issue is being kind and not<br/>
hurting a friend&#39;s feelings.<br/>
| If he did not get along with Samantha, I most definitely would<br/>
not even think about<br/>
| suggesting that he invite her. But they do get along and they<br/>
do have fun when they<br/>
| get together. There are two boys that he sees even less then<br/>
Samantha and does not<br/>
| really know (their parents and I are college friends and they<br/>
see each other at<br/>
| birthday parties and occasional get togethers) that he had no<br/>
problem inviting (here<br/>
| again the only reason that I suggested that he invite them was<br/>
because he had been invited<br/>
| to their parties a couple of months ago). And what part should<br/>
rudeness play in making<br/>
| the decision of who to invite? Should you invite someone who<br/>
you do not really know but<br/>
| invited you to their party? If he does not invite Samantha,<br/>
should he go to Samantha&#39;s<br/>
| party?<br/>
|<br/>
| Samantha and he are friends. He enjoys playing with her when<br/>
they get together. She most<br/>
| likely will invite him to her party (in Jan). That is why I<br/>
have the indecision. I am leaning<br/>
| towards getting the two of them together, but even that seems a<br/>
little weird...I like<br/>
| you but not enough to invite you to my birthday party?<br/>
|<br/>
| I probably will talk this over with Samantha&#39;s mom (we are<br/>
close enough friends) but I<br/>
| want to have things a little more firm in my head before I do.<br/>
Geesh. I thought that<br/>
| I was done with these should we invite/shouldn&#39;t we invite<br/>
situations since we were not<br/>
| in school!<br/>
|<br/>
| I think that I will plan on mentioning to my friends (the moms<br/>
of the two boys who<br/>
| are invited) to not feel like they need to invite Jason to<br/>
their party the next year.<br/>
| Really the only reason that Jason is invited is because we<br/>
parents are friends. That<br/>
| at least will simplify that aspect. We&#39;ll have to see how<br/>
things go with Samantha this<br/>
| year and if they stay friends I guess.<br/>
|<br/>
| Thanks for helping me work some of this out in my head, even<br/>
though I am still not completely<br/>
| sure which way to go...<br/>

do one party a year. I really like the idea of having more parties<br/>
for different reasons. Doh! I have often complained about having the<br/>
perfect backyard for summer parties when I have 2 boys with winter<br/>
birthdays...thanks for hitting me over the head, I appreciate it!<br/>
