<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452516215">I&#39;m confused... How is it a valid topic to talk about neutured cats, which <br/>
holds absolutely no interest to me whatsoever, but not valid to talk about <br/>
being violent to children?  Seems I have my priorities right when it comes to <br/>
the order of importance of my children versus animals... Sounds like from the <br/>
posts others have theirs too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303340053">Hello. :-)  I introduced the subject initially, and in the subject line I<br/>
put: &quot;cats!!-was corporal punishment.&quot; (Emphasis on the *was*.)  Sorry you<br/>
missed this.<br/>
