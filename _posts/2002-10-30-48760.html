<br/>
&gt; And there was research in the past few years (maybe even last year) about the<br/>
&gt; effect of sperm on women.  Seriously.  Pretty soon they&#39;ll probably be<br/>
&gt; selling it in Jergen&#39;s lotion or something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do tell! (If you remember, or I can go Google :)<br/>
<br/>
I know its effect on ME and I&#39;m wildly curious to see if I fit a scientific<br/>

I don&#39;t know if I saved the article.</div>

then again, a good evening of fun certainly makes for a good sleep. So maybe <br/>
