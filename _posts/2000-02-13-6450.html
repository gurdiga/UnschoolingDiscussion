Home-Schooled Kids Defy<br/>
            Stereotypes, Ace SAT Test<br/>
            By DANIEL GOLDEN<br/>
            Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            ATLANTA -- Jason Scoggins will never graduate from high<br/>
school,<br/>
have a class rank or be recommended by his guidance counselor. But<br/>
Oglethorpe<br/>
University wants him anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            Jason, who is 17 years old, was home-schooled by his mother.<br/>
After he scored 1,570 out of a possible 1,600 on his SAT<br/>
college-admissions<br/>
test -- with a perfect 800 in math -- Oglethorpe invited him to compete<br/>
with<br/>
other top applicants for five scholarships valued at about $100,000<br/>
apiece.<br/>
Of the 94 prospects in the Jan. 22 contest, eight were home-schoolers, <br/>
each with SATs above 1,300.<br/>
<br/>
            The high scores are no fluke. As the movement grows larger<br/>
and<br/>
more diverse, evidence is mounting that home-schooling, once confined to<br/>
the<br/>
political and religious fringe, has achieved results not only on par<br/>
with<br/>
public education, but in some ways surpassing it. Though home-schooling<br/>
may<br/>
never be feasible for most families, the data offer little comfort to<br/>
those<br/>
who advocate a standardized curriculum as the best hope for improving<br/>
American education. After all, each home-based<br/>
pupil follows a unique lesson plan.<br/>
<br/>
            Jason&#39;s twin brother, Jeremy, also home-schooled, scored<br/>
1,480<br/>
on his SAT. &quot;I was afraid we were the rogues of the education<br/>
community,&quot; <br/>
says Jeremy, who plans to attend the University of Georgia or the<br/>
Georgia<br/>
Institute of Technology. &quot;It isn&#39;t that way anymore. People know that if<br/>
we&#39;ve been home-schooled, we&#39;ll do a little better than everyone else.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            Though it is hard to track a movement that remains partly<br/>
underground, advocates say that 1.5 million children nationwide are<br/>
being<br/>
taught at home; independent researchers put the figure closer to one<br/>
million.<br/>
<br/>
The federal Education Department estimated the total in 1996 at 700,000<br/>
to<br/>
750,000; it expects to issue a revised count soon. In any case,<br/>
home-schoolers far outnumber the 400,000 students attending charter<br/>
schools,<br/>
a more mainstream alternative. Total public- and private-school<br/>
enrollment in the U.S. is about 50 million.<br/>
<br/>
            The growth in home-schooling reflects not only religious or<br/>
educational concerns, but also alarm over school violence. Soon after<br/>
last<br/>
spring&#39;s Columbine High School murders, one home-schooling magazine ran<br/>
the<br/>
headline: &quot;Tragedy in Colorado: Isn&#39;t It Time Your Kids Were Safe at<br/>
Home?&quot;<br/>
This past September, the start of the first new school year since the<br/>
slayings, the number of registered home-schoolers in Colorado surged<br/>
10.1%.<br/>
<br/>
            The SAT and the ACT, the nation&#39;s other major<br/>
college-entrance<br/>
test, have begun asking exam takers whether they were home-schooled. The<br/>
3,257 ACT takers and 2,219 SAT takers who last year identified<br/>
themselves as<br/>
home-schoolers are fewer than might be expected if a million or more<br/>
students are being educated at home. But researchers say such students <br/>
often are reluctant to declare themselves for privacy reasons or for<br/>
fear of<br/>
discrimination. Moreover, many taught at home in lower grades later<br/>
attend<br/>
high school.<br/>
<br/>
            Nonetheless, self-identified home-schoolers have bettered<br/>
the<br/>
national averages on the ACT for the past three years running, scoring<br/>
an<br/>
average 22.7 last year, compared with 21 for their more traditional<br/>
peers,<br/>
on a scale of one to 36. Home-schoolers scored 23.4 in English, well<br/>
above the<br/>
20.5 national average; and 24.4 in reading, compared with a mean of<br/>
21.4.<br/>
The gap was closer in science (21.9 vs. 21.0), and home-schoolers scored<br/>
below<br/>
the national average in math, 20.4 to 20.7.<br/>
<br/>
            On the SAT, which began its tracking last year,<br/>
home-schoolers<br/>
scored an average 1,083 (verbal 548, math 535), 67 points above the<br/>
national <br/>
average of 1,016. Similarly, on the 10 SAT2 achievement tests most<br/>
frequently <br/>
taken by home-schoolers, they surpassed the national average on nine,<br/>
including <br/>
writing, physics and French.<br/>
<br/>
            Income and Achievement<br/>
<br/>
            With average family incomes of $40,000 to $50,000, lower<br/>
than<br/>
the $50,000-to-$60,000 median rung, the home-schoolers defied the<br/>
demographic<br/>
correlation between high incomes and high SAT scores. They also<br/>
contradict<br/>
the stereotype that they are strictly rural white fundamentalists.<br/>
Nearly 4%<br/>
are black. Another 4% are Hispanic. And their parents have more<br/>
education<br/>
than the national norm.<br/>
<br/>
                  Join the Discussion: What will the trend towards<br/>
home-schooling mean for the U.S. education system? Can home-schooling<br/>
techniques be used in public education?<br/>
<br/>
            Maralee Mayberry, chairwoman of the sociology department at<br/>
the<br/>
University of Nevada at Las Vegas and author of a book on<br/>
home-schooling,<br/>
warns that the data only document the existence of a top tier of<br/>
home-school<br/>
whiz kids; there also may be an unstudied bottom layer of failures.<br/>
Still,<br/>
she says, research has shown that the key elements in effective<br/>
education<br/>
are small class size, individualized instruction, and a disciplined,<br/>
nurturing<br/>
environment -- all characteristics of home-schooling.<br/>
<br/>
            Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of<br/>
Teachers, says the test data don&#39;t cast doubt on the value of teachers. <br/>
&quot;Why draw any grand conclusions?&quot; she asks, since so few home-schoolers<br/>
take <br/>
the SAT and ACT. &quot;I just say I&#39;m happy for them. These are parents who<br/>
are very <br/>
highly motivated, teaching their kids at home and doing a very good<br/>
job,&quot; she says.<br/>
She adds, however, that public schools need to do more to challenge<br/>
gifted<br/>
students if they are to avoid losing some of them to home-schooling.<br/>
<br/>
            Once in college, home-schoolers appear to be living up to<br/>
their<br/>
test scores. Those enrolled at Boston University in the past four years<br/>
have<br/>
a 3.3 grade-point average, out of a perfect four. Similarly, Georgia&#39;s<br/>
Kennesaw State University found that its home-schooled students had<br/>
higher-than-average GPAs as college freshmen.<br/>
<br/>
            At Kennesaw State, both the president and the vice president<br/>
of<br/>
the student government were educated at home. The president, John M.<br/>
Fuchko<br/>
III, whose mother began teaching him after he was labeled hyperactive in<br/>
kindergarten, says home-schoolers will change college as much as college<br/>
changes them. He predicts that they will pressure colleges to<br/>
individualize<br/>
instruction and stop insisting on surve courses as prerequisites for<br/>
more<br/>
advanced studies.<br/>
<br/>
            &quot;In home-schooling, you don&#39;t have to sit for half a year<br/>
studying something you already know,&quot; says the 22-year-old senior. &quot;If<br/>
you&#39;re prepared to go to the next level, you take it to the next level.<br/>
Home-schooling breeds enterprising people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            That enterprise has impressed many secular colleges, and<br/>
most<br/>
have modified their admissions policies to accommodate home-schoolers. A<br/>
recent survey by the National Center for Home Education, a<br/>
Virginia-based<br/>
advocacy group, found that 68% of colleges now accept parent-prepared<br/>
transcripts or portfolios in place of an accredited diploma. That<br/>
includes<br/>
Stanford University, which last fall accepted 27% of home-schooled<br/>
applicants<br/>
-- nearly double its overall acceptance rate.<br/>
<br/>
            Valuable Skills<br/>
<br/>
            &quot;Home-schoolers bring certain skills -- motivation,<br/>
curiosity,<br/>
the capacity to be responsible for their education -- that high schools<br/>
don&#39;t induce very well,&quot; says Jon Reider, Stanford&#39;s senior associate<br/>
director <br/>
of admissions.<br/>
<br/>
            Despite such inroads, religious colleges still draw a<br/>
disproportionate number of home-schoolers. For example, at Oral Roberts<br/>
University in Tulsa, Okla., 309 students -- more than 10% of the student<br/>
body were home-schooled for at least a year. Oral Roberts offers a<br/>
$2,000<br/>
scholarship for home-schoolers, while Nyack College, a Christian school<br/>
in<br/>
Nyack, N.Y., provides as much as $12,000. And this fall, Christian<br/>
home-schoolers are planning to open their own college in Purcellville,<br/>
Va.<br/>
<br/>
            Skepticism about home-schoolers&#39; credentials lingers,<br/>
however.<br/>
The American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions<br/>
Officers<br/>
warned members last December that the rise in home-schooling creates<br/>
&quot;significant potential for conflict&quot; with applicants because colleges<br/>
may<br/>
need &quot;supplementary materials&quot; to gauge academic preparedness.<br/>
<br/>
            In 1997, North Carolina and New Mexico restricted public<br/>
colleges from asking home-schooled applicants to submit more test scores <br/>
than regular applicants. But that same year, Georgia&#39;s board of regents <br/>
tightened state-college admissions rules for home-schoolers, requiring<br/>
them <br/>
to pass eight SAT2 subject tests, which are entirely optional for other<br/>
students;<br/>
they also face hurdles in getting financial aid. Georgia&#39;s Hope<br/>
scholarship<br/>
program pays all tuition at state colleges for Georgia high-school<br/>
graduates<br/>
with B averages who don&#39;t get federal financial aid. But home-schoolers<br/>
qualify only retroactively, if they earn a B average as college<br/>
freshmen.<br/>
<br/>
            Exploiting a Niche<br/>
<br/>
            The disparity has angered home-schoolers -- and helped<br/>
created a<br/>
niche for Oglethorpe, which hopes to boost full-time enrollment to 1,000<br/>
from 800 and its endowment to $100 million from $32 million. &quot;When we<br/>
started<br/>
going after home-schoolers, I thought it would be a gold mine,&quot; says<br/>
Admissions Director Barbara Henry. &quot;The trouble is, other colleges<br/>
started<br/>
accepting them, too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            Mrs. Henry, who says she used to dismiss home-schoolers as<br/>
&quot;crackpots&quot; before she got to know them, has positioned Oglethorpe as<br/>
their<br/>
home away from home. The school hosts home-school curriculum fairs on<br/>
its<br/>
faux-Oxford campus, lets home-schoolers use its athletic facilities, and<br/>
encourages precocious 14- and 15-year-olds to enroll part time. To stay<br/>
ahead in the recruitment race, it also has started including<br/>
home-schoolers <br/>
in its annual scholarship competition. Last year, for the first time, a<br/>
home-schooler won one of the full scholarships.<br/>
<br/>
            Maggie Bryson, the winner, had become so bored in fifth<br/>
grade<br/>
that she refused to go back to school. Her mother, a nurse, shortened<br/>
her<br/>
own work hours and began home-schooling her daughter. When Maggie was<br/>
13, her<br/>
mother sent her for physical education to Oglethorpe, where track coach<br/>
Bob<br/>
Unger had started a weekly track-and-field class for home-schoolers. Two<br/>
years later, Maggie began taking academic courses there. With a 1,430<br/>
SAT<br/>
score, including 800 on the verbal, she applied<br/>
to eight colleges and was accepted at seven, including Oglethorpe.<br/>
<br/>
            Vocal and Direct<br/>
<br/>
            Now a freshman, Ms. Bryson has an A-minus average and is<br/>
teaching herself Arabic and ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics in her spare <br/>
time. But she still is adapting to classroom etiquette. &quot;We<br/>
home-schoolers <br/>
tend to be very vocal and talk to the professor directly,&quot; she says.<br/>
&quot;It might bother other students a little bit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            Jason Scoggins is no intellectual wallflower, either. He was<br/>
so<br/>
infuriated at being ineligible for a &quot;star student&quot; honor given by a<br/>
teachers&#39; union -- the award is based partly on class rank -- he<br/>
consulted a<br/>
lawyer. He has written to Georgia state universities, criticizing extra<br/>
testing requirements for home-schoolers. Both he and Jeremy, who have <br/>
entered into a friendly test-taking rivalry, aced the SAT2 subject tests<br/>
and <br/>
have taken so many advanced-placement tests, which are scored on a<br/>
one-to-five <br/>
scale and confer college credits, that they could enter college as<br/>
sophomores.<br/>
<br/>
            &quot;I&#39;ve taken eight advanced-placement exams and gotten fives<br/>
on<br/>
all of them,&quot; says Jason. &quot;He&#39;s taken seven and gotten fives on four of<br/>
them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            &quot;He can&#39;t stand for me to score better than he does,&quot; Jeremy<br/>
shrugs. &quot;So far, I haven&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            Financial aid is likely to determine where the twins go to<br/>
college, and whether they can afford to live on campus. Their father,<br/>
Mickey<br/>
Scoggins, who didn&#39;t attend college, supports his wife and five children<br/>
--<br/>
the twins; Joshua, 15; Jonathan, 9; and baby Joanna -- with his job as a<br/>
furniture-store manager. But the Scogginses, who own a modest house on a<br/>
three-acre wooded lot in Monroe, 35 miles east of Atlanta, say they<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
have enough money for college tuitions.<br/>
<br/>
            The twins have been taught at home since fourth grade by<br/>
their<br/>
mother, Ellen Scoggins, who is also teaching Joshua and Jonathan. A<br/>
devout<br/>
Christian and former public-school teacher, with a master&#39;s degree in<br/>
education, she believes that academics come first; neither twin may have<br/>
a<br/>
girlfriend before college.<br/>
<br/>
            Virtual-Reality Frogs<br/>
<br/>
            At first, Mrs. Scoggins used a curriculum from Bob Jones<br/>
University in Greenville, S.C., which sells texts and educational<br/>
services<br/>
for home-schoolers. Later, she experimented with other materials. The<br/>
family<br/>
spends $3,000 a year on textbooks, computer programs and exam fees and<br/>
makes<br/>
extensive use of the local library. The twins use the Internet as well, <br/>
dissecting virtual-reality frogs for biology.<br/>
Their mother grades their schoolwork. Jason&#39;s grade-point average is<br/>
3.97,<br/>
marred only by a B in Latin. Jeremy is a close second, at 3.91.<br/>
<br/>
            In his spare time, Jason participates in 4-H and Gavel Club,<br/>
a<br/>
public-speaking organization, or watches his favorite TV show, &quot;Who<br/>
Wants to<br/>
Be a Millionaire?&quot; To his regret, he is a year too young to be a<br/>
contestant.<br/>
But he can pursue another lucrative prize -- the Oglethorpe scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
            In the lobby of the Oglethorpe performing-arts center, many<br/>
of<br/>
the contestants are fidgeting, aware that their comments in two<br/>
seminars,<br/>
and a writing assignment, will determine their financial aid. (Losers<br/>
are<br/>
guaranteed $10,500 a year, or $42,000.) But Jason seems serene. &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
almost<br/>
like a nice philosophical debate with some friends,&quot; he says.<br/>
<br/>
            Once they split into groups for the first seminar, he is<br/>
ready.<br/>
His head cocked to one side, Jason listens as other students begin<br/>
discussing<br/>
a subject he has considered before: the travails of American education<br/>
--<br/>
and, specifically, the work of E.D. Hirsch Jr., a leading proponent of<br/>
the<br/>
idea that schools are failing because there is no national canon.<br/>
<br/>
            Jason has another view: Public schools will never excel<br/>
because<br/>
they lack &quot;intellectual capital&quot; and have to compensate for too many<br/>
social<br/>
problems. &quot;They have drug-education programs that take away from the<br/>
three<br/>
R&#39;s,&quot; he says. &quot;I haven&#39;t been in real schools very often. But when I&#39;ve<br/>
seen them, they&#39;re wild. The parents don&#39;t care enough. I know it&#39;s said<br/>
that<br/>
schools should be agents of socialization. But that&#39;s not their role.<br/>
Their<br/>
role is to impart knowledge.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            The other students gape, astonished by the attack, and<br/>
somewhat<br/>
defensive. &quot;My friends are all ghetto kids,&quot; says Joseph &quot;Jo Jo&quot;<br/>
Brisendine<br/>
from Rockdale County High School in Conyers, Ga. &quot;They&#39;re smarter than<br/>
you<br/>
give them credit for.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            The next day, an ice storm shuts down Oglethorpe&#39;s phones.<br/>
But<br/>
Dennis Matthews, dean of enrollment management, reaches the Scogginses<br/>
on a<br/>
cell phone with the news. Jason has tied for the top score and won a<br/>
full<br/>
scholarship. Less demonstrative than the TV millionaires, Jason quietly<br/>
says, &quot;Thank you.&quot; Then he gives his mother, who is coaxing the baby <br/>
to take a nap,the thumbs-up sign.<br/>
