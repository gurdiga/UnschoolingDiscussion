<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343331272">This is what I&#39;m experiencing too.  I felt so awful the first couple weeks of <br/>
March.  I&#39;ve  always had fatigue and pain and have just gotten use to them.  I <br/>
went in 2 yrs ago and the doctor I saw was almost hostile towards me so I never <br/>
went back.  But then I started having worse symptoms and decided it was time to <br/>
go in again.  The first time I saw the doctor I was in severe pain and also <br/>
almost felt drunk and I thought wow he really cares.  But the next time I saw <br/>
him I was feeling much better and clear headed and realized that he was doing <br/>
all the talking and hardly listening, so how could he be really caring about <br/>
me?  Does this make sense?  I&#39;m starting to feel crappy again and having <br/>
problems writing cohertenly.  This is all pretty scary and I feel really lost <br/>
without a diagnosis.  It&#39;d be so much easier to find support if I knew what was <br/>
wrong with me.  It&#39;s hard too with my husband probably originally thinking it <br/>
was all in my head (though he didn&#39;t say so), to now worrying if I&#39;m going to <br/>
be able to take care of the kids.  I&#39;d like to thank everyone here who took the <br/>
time to answer my original post and I&#39;m sorry to bring this issue here to the <br/>
unschooling board, but so far this has been my best support system.  So thanks <br/>
again.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; I&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt;  accounts of the same balderdash being spewed from neurologists to their<br/>
&gt;  patients, from many many MS sufferers on the support newsgroups &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; Buzz,<br/>
&gt; I have to add my 2 cents worth here.  I back up every word you&#39;ve said about <br/>
&gt; this.  It is exactly the same for lupus.  It&#39;s known as the great imitator <br/>
&gt; because it can look like so many other things.  From the time symptoms appear <br/>
&gt; until lupus is diagnosed is an average of 7 years.  Patients are often made <br/>
&gt; to feel that it&#39;s all in their heads.  My lupus involves my central nervous <br/>
&gt; system and so it almost perfectly mimics MS.  I went through the wringer with <br/>
&gt; doctors looking my MRIs over and telling me that there was nothing wrong with <br/>
&gt; me.  They said that my loss of vision (actually optic neuritis, of course) <br/>
&gt; and my numbness and weakness were just manifestations of hysteria.  I began <br/>
&gt; to feel terrible about myself and to question my own sanity.  Turns out I was <br/>
&gt; right and they were wrong. (blowing big raspberries here...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyone who is searching for a diagnosis needs to know that they should RUN, <br/>
&gt; not walk from these patronizing, consdescending creeps.  <br/>

   Please read my post on Chronic Fatigue.  You may have a different dx, but <br/>
it could also be treated well thru homeopathy if you are interested.  Sorry I <br/>
didn&#39;t include your name in the post, I did not realize you were also ill.  <br/>
Sorry!   jackie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730836537">Hi Tammy,<br/>
                Sorry I&#39;m responding to this post so long after the fact,<br/>
but  I had to put my 2 cents in. I was diagnosed with fibromyalga (sp?) last<br/>
summer, after years of suffering with some of the symptoms from time to<br/>
time. Fortunatly, for me, I found a great rhumatologist, who actually<br/>
believes every word I say. How&#39;s that for a rare doctor? Anyhow , you said<br/>
that doctors won&#39;t see you unless you take all previous records with you. My<br/>
question is why do they have to know who you&#39;ve seen in the past and who you<br/>
haven&#39;t? Couldn&#39;t you, for example, go to a new rhumatologist and start from<br/>
scratch. You could tell him all of your symptoms and let him decide if he<br/>
feels he can either make a diagnosis on his own or send you to a<br/>
neurologist. I know this isn&#39;t the most honest approach and is fround upon<br/>
in the medical circles, but my feeling is, if it gets you the help you need<br/>
in the end it will all be worth it. As you know, diagnosing any autoimmune<br/>
disorder can be a painstaking proccess, but I&#39;ve known so many people,<br/>
myself included that in the end were so glad they stuck with it. Sometimes<br/>
just knowing what you have can change your outlook. Anyhow, good luck and<br/>
please keep me posted.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;  will tell you this though ... the majority of auto immune disorder<br/>
&gt;  patients I&#39;ve had personal contact with have had to fight like hell to<br/>
&gt;  be treated decently and honestly.<br/>
&gt;  An informed patient has to tread carefully so as not to bruise doctors&#39;<br/>
&gt;  egos and get the treatment they deserve!!!!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Buzz,<br/>
&gt;     I agree, that is why I have given up for the time being!  The last<br/>
time I<br/>
&gt; went to see a &quot;specialist&quot; that my family doctor referred me to, he gave<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; all of 10 minutes of his time.  He said to me&quot;Well, if I just looked at<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; history, I would say it was MS.<br/>
&gt; However, the neurologist (the one that was a jerk!) said that you don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; Therefore, I don&#39;t see any reason to have an MRI, because you don&#39;t have<br/>
MS.<br/>
&gt; It worries me that you have _______ with this, as this is usually<br/>
indicative<br/>
&gt; of MS.  But once again, I just don&#39;t think it is because the neurologist<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; that you don&#39;t have it.  I think you should start looking in another<br/>
&gt; direction.  I can&#39;t help you.&quot;  That was the last straw for me.<br/>
Basically,<br/>
&gt; he took one persons word (who believe me was such a jerk, that I would<br/>
never<br/>
&gt; want to mess with her again) and refused to even examine me.  It didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; matter that family went with me and tried to tell him how I am really<br/>
sick,<br/>
&gt; he just didn&#39;t want to take the time.  If only I could see someone without<br/>
&gt; taking the records from that one doctor, however, they won&#39;t ever see me<br/>
&gt; unless I forward everything!  That one doctor is really hurting my case.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; need to start off fresh, but it just won&#39;t happen.  I am so tired of<br/>
beating<br/>
&gt; my head against a brick wall!  Well, sorry to go off like that, but this<br/>
&gt; subject is very touching to me.  Right now I am furious at doctors!<br/>
