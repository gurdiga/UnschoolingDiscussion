<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426335001">Foxglove Studio is Sherry, sorry about the confusion. And, no, I am not Ned, <br/>
have not ever met him, don&#39;t care if I do. My posts were not really about <br/>
Ned, they were about the idea that someone shouldn&#39;t be banned on a list that <br/>
is called Unschooling if he or she is trying to speak about things that he or <br/>
she believe are important to unschooling. I have been on the list quite a <br/>
while now. I read a lot, but don&#39;t post often, because God forbid I should <br/>
have opinions that differ from a few powerful individuals, and get myself <br/>
booted too. The only thing I will say about Ned though, is that his removal <br/>
from the list was a real shame, because he&#39;s probably one of the only <br/>
original unschoolers who has actually raised a child by unschooling. He&#39;s the <br/>
real McCoy, he&#39;s been there and done that. Most of the posters on the list <br/>
are in the midst of unschooling, and might have benefited from his <br/>
experience. Too bad, we&#39;ll never know...<br/>

banned from posting, aren&#39;t you?  May I ask why?  Because they weren&#39;t the<br/>
reason.  And why all of a sudden, after months, you&#39;re chewing on this thing<br/>
again?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s stopping *you* from benefitting from his experience?  He&#39;s around.<br/>
It&#39;s been posted many times where to find him.  Anyone else here who wants<br/>
his experience is welcome to go get it.  And since your first post said that<br/>
you weren&#39;t even unschooling yet, how is it that you know so much about what<br/>
an unschooling list should be?<br/>
