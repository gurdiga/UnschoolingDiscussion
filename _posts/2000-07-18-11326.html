<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560537020">Hi Cathy,<br/>
I&#39;m a bit behind, as usual, on the list....I can&#39;t offer any personal<br/>
stories about my children since they are still young, but I think that the<br/>
more you ask Katrina to participate in the decision making process about<br/>
school, the better she will feel about herself.  I think kids labelled LD or<br/>
gifted in ps loose even more control over their lives and their learning.<br/>
Not only do they have to satisfy teacher & parent, now they have an ISP to<br/>
fulfill.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being 14, it&#39;s hard enough without all that other &quot;stuff&quot;.  Give<br/>
her back a lot more control of her learning and I think, I hope, things will<br/>
get easier.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I can&#39;t believe no one has suggested yet, please read & ask her to<br/>
read (or read to her) The Teenage Liberation Handbook by Grace Llewellyn.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Cindy</div>
