money.. almost anything can happen *smile*<br/>
<br/>
Beside cremated burials at sea, I don&#39;t think there is a provision for a <br/>
rock, a hemp rope and a body. Nothing else that would impede the <br/>
decomposing process.<br/>
<br/>
My brother, now a sea Captain, has checked into this quite a few years <br/>
ago before his mid-life career change. It was discouraging.<br/>
<br/>
If the laws have changed, i would be interested, and would stand <br/>
corrected. This would be my way to go, since I don&#39;t think they allow you <br/>
to get put into the ground without a box :-)<br/>

<br/>
6-11 BURIAL AT SEA <br/>
<br/>
All active duty and retired members of the uniformed services are <br/>
entitled to burial at sea. Burial must be<br/>
requested in writing. Primary next-of-kin desiring disposition of the <br/>
body at sea should contact the nearest<br/>
Office of Medical Affairs (See listing below) , which will ascertain ship <br/>
availability and inform next-of-kin<br/>
where to deliver the remains. Any expense for transportation of the <br/>
remains must be borne by the estate of the<br/>
deceased. Even though an individual is buried at sea, a memorial marker <br/>
can still be placed in a National<br/>
cemetery engraved with the standard grave stone information. ( Excerpts <br/>
RAO Moody AFB GA July 1991.) <br/>
<br/>
6-11a BURIAL AT SEA PROCEDURES <br/>
<br/>
Retired Navy members and their dependents are entitled to burial at sea. <br/>
Anyone desiring burial at sea should<br/>
indicate that preference in writing. At the time of demise, the <br/>
executor/executrix of the estate should contact: <br/>
<br/>
Office of Medical/Dental Affairs (MEDDEN AFFAIRS) <br/>
Mortuary Affairs, Bldg 38H <br/>
Great Lakes, Illinois 60088-5200 <br/>
Toll Free: 1-800-876-1131, Ext. 629 <br/>
<br/>
An information packet can be sent or FAXed to you. The packet contains <br/>
the Burial At Sea<br/>
request/authorization form. If the preference for burial at sea was not <br/>
put in writing by the retired member, the<br/>
person responsible for disposition of the remains may authorize burial at <br/>
sea. <br/>
<br/>
The following documents must be submitted to the proper &quot;port of <br/>
embarkation&quot;, which will be listed in the<br/>
information package available MEDDEN AFFAIRS, with the request form: <br/>
<br/>
* Certificate of cremation or a transit permit issued by the appropriate <br/>
civil authorities at the place of death;<br/>
or <br/>
*Photocopy of civil death certificate; and <br/>
* Signed request/authorization for committal from the primary next of kin <br/>
or executor of the estate <br/>
*Photocopy of retirement orders <br/>
<br/>
The authorization should include the decedents full name, grade, Social <br/>
Security number, and file/serial<br/>
number (if available); branch of service; date of retirement or dates of <br/>
service and date of death; type of<br/>
religious service desired; and whether scatting of cremated remains from <br/>
a naval vessel/aircraft, or committal<br/>
of casket remains is desired from a naval vessel; and the body of water <br/>
in which the cremains/remains should<br/>
be committed. <br/>
<br/>
It should be noted that the Navy does not offer free cremation services <br/>
for its retirees and veterans. The only<br/>
exception is if a retiree is hospitalized in a military hospital at the <br/>
time of death. In this case, the survivors are<br/>
entitled to all mortuary services at government expense, including the <br/>
assistance of the military services in<br/>
making funeral arrangements. <br/>
<br/>
Also, advance arrangements cannot be made because compliance with the <br/>
request would depend upon<br/>
weather conditions and the availability of a ship at that time. Services <br/>
on board ship while in port may be<br/>
permitted on a &quot;not to interfere&quot; basis; however, civilian personnel <br/>
cannot be authorized to attend services at<br/>
sea. Any expenses incurred for delivery of remains/cremains to the point <br/>
of embarkation on board a naval<br/>
ship must be borne by the estate of the deceased. Remains to be committed <br/>
should be in a state of<br/>
preservation that will allow them to be stored for 60 days. For more <br/>
information please call or write<br/>
MEDDEN AFFAIRS. <br/>
<br/>
An alternate to burial at sea from a naval vessel/aircraft is burial at <br/>
sea from a United States Coast Guard<br/>
(USCG) vessel. The USCG has more stations along the coasts of the US than <br/>
does the Navy. In areas where<br/>
the nearest naval activity is hundreds of miles away, the cost to the <br/>
family of transporting the remains and<br/>
family members to the services could be prohibitive. In addition, the <br/>
USCGs mission provides much more<br/>
flexibility and availability of vessels to accommodate burial at sea, and <br/>
when mission obligations and<br/>
weather conditions permit, civilian personnel are permitted to attend the <br/>
services at sea. As with the Navy,<br/>
advance arrangements cannot be made. Interested persons should contact <br/>
the nearest USCG station, which is<br/>
usually listed under the Department of Transportation in the local <br/>
telephone directory. (Shift Colors, Fall 95)<br/>

<br/>

I have a friend who was buried in only a blanket, and a friend who&#39;s a <br/>
funeral director who says you can be buried without a coffin (in this state, <br/>
anyway).  You just have to know the terminology and press for knowing the <br/>
laws.<br/>
<br/>
My question about the burial at sea was WHOSE law is it?  U.S.?  The <br/>
jurisdiction over the ocean only extends a few miles from any country&#39;s <br/>
shores.<br/>

from small airplanes over the ocean.  Only certified personnel may do<br/>
it - I heard about the law when one of those certified personnel took<br/>
money and cremated remains to do it, but just stashed the urns in a<br/>
storage locker.<br/>
<br/>
Also the number of miles in the jurisdiction depends on whose border<br/>
it is.  I believe most countries allow others to claim 2 miles while<br/>
they claim 200 for themselves.  That&#39;s why there can be &quot;incidents&quot;<br/>
with fishing boats - one side sees it as international waters and<br/>
the other as their countries.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693649441">The US claims 3 miles.  The minimum other countries claim is 12 miles except<br/>
when they are fishing or playing nuclear/war games.  Japan &quot;claimed&quot; the US<br/>
could only claim 1 mile and that was the reason they ran aground up here<br/>
(you&#39;ve been to Trinidad, haven&#39;t you, Cindy?) during WWII.<br/>
<br/>
International waters is one big mess and there are hundreds of lawsuits<br/>
filed each year in international courts.<br/>
