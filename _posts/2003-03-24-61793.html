<div id="ygrps-yiv-934627652">Last Sunday I took Brian and Katherine to Sunday school (Brian&#39;s <br/>
request--he said he wanted to know what they taught in the 4-year-old <br/>
class). Luckily for me, it was a 3/4 class, so I got them both in <br/>
without a fight and stayed with them.<br/>
<br/>
Step one was everyone sit down on your mat with your legs folded. Do not <br/>
speak until recognized (this is before the CLASS started). I was not <br/>
surprised to hear that the TEACHER was also a preschool TEACHER the rest <br/>
of the week, too.<br/>
<br/>
The story is told and played out with little wooden characters. Then the <br/>
kids have a few minutes to choose a free-choice activity (Brian&#39;s? draw <br/>
a train! big surprise there!) Then they re-form in their circle on mats, <br/>
with legs folded (very important) to have snack/fake communion. Then as <br/>
parents arrive to pick up kids each may get up when their name is called <br/>
and get a sticker, their art, and go. There is no minute allowed for <br/>
conversation at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107840342">We&#39;ve had the same problem with our ds Liam, 14.  He was liberated (yeah!) <br/>
from school only a year and a half ago, and we&#39;ve been unschooling (as best I <br/>
could) from the very beginning.  As active Lutherans, Sunday School and <br/>
Confirmation classes became a real problem -- especially when I decided that <br/>
it would be hypocritical of me to affirm his independence from the oppression <br/>
of the classroom only to make him endure the same thing in the name of God.  <br/>
What kind of a message does THAT send, exactly?  We solved the problem by <br/>
talking to the pastor and arranging for conversations between the two of them <br/>
for Confirmation.  He just doesn&#39;t go to Sunday School.  The conversations <br/>
are initiated by Liam when he has a question or a theological idea -- and he <br/>
has many.  It&#39;s been hit and miss, I guess you could say, and I know the <br/>
pastor isn&#39;t terribly happy (we won&#39;t even discuss my mother), but Liam is <br/>
and that&#39;s what&#39;s important to me.  I don&#39;t want to force-feed him religion <br/>
any more than I want to shove education down his throat.  We also watch <br/>
movies and documentaries and talk a lot.  He&#39;s pretty skeptical right now, <br/>
but I think that&#39;s a healthy thing.  At least he&#39;s thinking.  When he comes <br/>
to a place of decision making, it will be on his own terms.  Meanwhile, the <br/>
family still goes to church on a regular basis, and he sees us living what we <br/>
believe.  I figure it&#39;s the best we can do.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662380840">When my kids were  preschoolers, I taught the Sunday school (every other<br/>
week)  at a small laid back church where there were only a half dozen<br/>
kids on a busy day.  I read them a story,  and did a craft with them,<br/>
and played games with them.  It was fun and laid back.  The kids and I<br/>
liked going and the kids that were there, wanted to be there and enjoyed<br/>
it too.  I stopped teaching it when too many kids joined that didn&#39;t<br/>
want to be there. (mixed age class goes up to about age 12)  They never<br/>
paid attention, they wound everyone up, they were mouthy and rude.  It<br/>
was just another place there parents dumped them to get rid of them for<br/>
awhile.  It made me so mad that they ruined a nice little set up we had.<br/>
I refused to be a disciplinarian while I was there.  I made it through<br/>
the rest of that year, but didn&#39;t go back.  <br/>
 <br/>
Recently, the kids wanted to go try it out again.  (They wanted to go do<br/>
a craft with the other kids.)  So, off we went. (my kids like me to stay<br/>
in class with them.)   It seems the class is now being taught (at least<br/>
the week we were there, they rotate weeks) by a ps teacher.  It was so<br/>
awful!  There were worksheets and a condescending tone. The one thing<br/>
she was good at though, was keeping the kids who obviously didn&#39;t want<br/>
to be there, in line.  She even threatened one little boy with a time<br/>
out.  The whole experience was awful.<br/>
 <br/>
At the end of the the class, she said she heard I was homeschooling and<br/>
wanted to know if I taught based on the Maine Learning Results.  (not<br/>
sure how she worded it)  I misunderstood her to be asking if I would be<br/>
making my kids take the MEA (Maine assessment test.)  I told her no, we<br/>
don&#39;t test and we don&#39;t teach to the test.  We follow the children&#39;s<br/>
lead.  I could see the gears going.  Se explained how the learning<br/>
results show where Mainer children are weak in certain areas and how if<br/>
we focus on those points, we can do better on the Maine Assessment Test.<br/>
Like, how would that apply  to us?<br/>
 <br/>
Well, that was a little glimpse into public school and it was enough for<br/>
me. I am staying far far away from both Sunday school and public school.<br/>
Kids don&#39;t learn their morals from Sunday school anyway, they learn them<br/>
from watching their parents.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I can relate to this.   I have one of my 3 children that likes to go to Sunday School.  My 5 yr old.   I think its kind-of a novelty thing.  My 8 and 10,  don&#39;t want to go.  And I am having issues with church right now, so I am not going.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I try not to influence her decision.  I know she has fun, so if she wants to go that&#39;s fine.  She also gets to see alot of her friends there,  so its very social.  Talks all the time and does crafts.  <br/>
<br/>
She also dresses up,  puts on a dress and fancy shoes.   Which is one of my issues with church; I won&#39;t go into that, too long of story.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It was funny tho&#39; because for a couple of weeks she said, &quot;Mom, I don&#39;t have to go to Sunday School,  we do crafts and stuff here!&quot;   So not sure how much biblical learning is going on.        Which is fine with me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793885871">As a family, we didn&#39;t go to church after my parents divorced.  I lived with<br/>
my mom; I believe that my father continued to attend.  We did go with him a<br/>
few times before he moved far, far away.<br/>
<br/>
I started attending a neighborhood church when I was around 9 or 10.  I<br/>
loved memorizing bible verses and singing the songs.  I went to a church<br/>
sponsored summer camp a couple of times.  One of my neighborhood friends was<br/>
doing this too.<br/>
<br/>
I attended for a few years, then stopped.<br/>
<br/>
The difference was that I went on my own.  I could walk to the church.  So<br/>
it didn&#39;t involve my mom, except for the preaching I brought home with me.<br/>

to start a book club for boys to try to help her son with his reading.  They <br/>
decided it would be for boys only and the books would be &quot;Magic Tree House&quot; <br/>
books.  My boys were reading those and wanted to try the group.  It turned <br/>
out to be basically a unit study on whatever topic the book was about.  The <br/>
Mom turned out to be the &quot;teacher&quot;, and directed all the group activities.  <br/>
One art thing, a spelling thing, a science thing etc.  For an hour.  My boys <br/>
hated it.  They didn&#39;t get even one chance to talk about the book, like a <br/>
real book club, what they liked and didn&#39;t.  There was no conversations <br/>
between the boys.  They never went back. She spoiled it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30424072">I&#39;m a Christian unschooler.  I love Jesus with all of my heart, but <br/>
I can&#39;t stomach institutional church and we don&#39;t do Sunday School. <br/>
I did by Group&#39;s 5 year old Sunday school curriculum and we found a <br/>
lot of fun things to do with that.  We don&#39;t &quot;have sunday school&quot; at <br/>
home, but we treat it like a fun craft/activity pack that we go to <br/>
sometimes when we want something fun to do.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter does enjoy Bible School at my mil&#39;s church, though.  My <br/>
son enjoyed it two years ago (he was 4 then, and I stayed with him <br/>
in the pre-k class.  But last year when I tried to take him again (I <br/>
had registered both him and his 3 year old brother for the pre-k <br/>
class again), they said that this year they have a &quot;no parents&quot; <br/>
rule.  He wouldn&#39;t stay, and one of the staff people were trying to <br/>
talk him into it, telling him about all the fun things they were <br/>
going to do.  I thought it was very cruel to tell him all of the fun <br/>
things that he was missing out on because he was uncomfortable <br/>
leaving his mommy. :(  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1800567849">When I teach Children&#39;s Church I&#39;ve made my class very &quot;unschoolish&quot;. Though<br/>
they use a curriculum during sunday school there is not one for the second<br/>
class during Church. So when it&#39;s your turn to teach you&#39;re supposed to make<br/>
up your own lesson. This past week we did a quick handprint craft and then<br/>
made up stories about plastic dinosaurs in the playdoh (LOL) plus I brought<br/>
them dunkin donuts. I asked the kids what they want to do next Sunday since<br/>
I&#39;m on again and they want to make flashlights and have pizza! OK we can do<br/>
that after a quick trip to radio shack and an early call to the pizza place<br/>
:-). I want them to have fun, they are there for a long time 3-4 hours<br/>
Sunday mornings. I know my kids get hungry and bored so I figured they all<br/>
must.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781994576">I used to teach junior church, Sunday School classes, mid-week kids <br/>
clubs, youth group, you name it.  I always was causing friction <br/>
because they thought that when I taught the kids were too loud and <br/>
made too much of a mess.  I think they thought the main purpose of a <br/>
teacher was to keep the kids quiet during the service.  <br/>
<br/>
They really didn&#39;t like when I turned Bible memory verses into jump <br/>
rope rhymes and gave them all jump ropes.  <br/>
