&lt;&lt; would someone<br/>
 please explain the expression *runs with Scissors* to me? Every time I see<br/>
 it all I can envision is something out of Edward Scissorhands. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s<br/>
 got some deep philosophical meaning I&#39;m just missing. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Ann,<br/>
I put it in my sig line because it&#39;s sort of a philosophy for me.  You know <br/>
all those maxims we all used to hear in childhood?  Don&#39;t swim for an hour <br/>
after eating, don&#39;t make that face or it&#39;ll freeze like that, don&#39;t run with <br/>
scissors...  It&#39;s my way of saying that I have always been an independent <br/>
thinker and always will be.  I do it my way and if that means taking a little <br/>
risk, well, okay.  It really isn&#39;t meant to be terribly serious at all - just <br/>
a humorous way of keeping my perspective.<br/>
