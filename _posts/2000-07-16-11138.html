<div id="ygrps-yiv-344847300">The point is actually for the body to go into ketosis,<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t this dangerous though? I guess I get the point of the diet, but as I<br/>
understand it ketosis is not a good state for the body to be in. Perhaps I&#39;m<br/>
just misinformed. I supose to some extent I must be. Because I also had the<br/>
understanding that according to Dr. Atkins one could eat as much bacon and<br/>
eggs for b-fast as they wanted and as long as you didn&#39;t have a slice of<br/>
toast you were fine. All Oprah nonsence I suppose. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt; The Atkins diet, which I have the cookbook for here, designed for<br/>
&gt; folk with weight problems and blood-sugar imbalances (with a<br/>
&gt; specific section on yeast-infection) limits carbs to 20g per day for<br/>
&gt; 2 weeks, gradually increasing until a more &#39;normal&#39; level, one at<br/>
&gt; which the person following the program is comfortable, is found.<br/>
&gt; therefore<br/>
&gt; using the resources the body has built up over the years.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; imperative to drink LOTS of water during this period (as always,<br/>
&gt; but particularly so) since toxins trapped in fat cells will suddenly<br/>
&gt; find themselves free to travel around the body, and also to flush<br/>
&gt; the waste products from digesting protein away.  One also needs<br/>
&gt; to be aware that withdrawal syptoms from carbohydrates will<br/>
&gt; probably arise, along with the effects of said toxins.  I haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; followed the diet fully, but have felt considerably better since<br/>
&gt; stopping eating regular breakfast cereal and eating omelette or<br/>
&gt; bacon or ham.  I think this is becoming a circular argument, since<br/>
&gt; I believe I&#39;ve said this before.  Yes it could be the reduction of<br/>
&gt; milk in my diet from cutting out cereal, but I think it&#39;s the protein-<br/>
&gt; balance that&#39;s more critical to me.<br/>

&gt; &gt; A book I read and followed for a while is Protein<br/>
&gt; &gt; Power by Dr.Michael Eddes(sp). It explains how carbs<br/>
&gt; &gt; affect the body and also has some good recipes in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; back. There is also The Low Carbohidrate Cook Book.<br/>
&gt; &gt; These are both helpful when you don&#39;t know how to cut<br/>
&gt; &gt; your carbs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; If you are having problems with wild mood swings<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and blood sugar levels, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is more likely to be because of something you are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; eating, not because you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; aren&#39;t eating meat or getting enough protein. Maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you are getting too many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple carbohydrates or waiting too long between<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; meals. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Billy,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This could be a possibility. I was eating tons of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pasta and fresh vegies,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; little eggs and dairy and almost no meat. So what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do you eat? Please share<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what you have eaten in, say the last 2-3 days, just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to give us hopefulls some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ideas. I think part of my problem is not know what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to eat or how to prepare<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it so it is tasty. If you could pass along some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple no lose receipes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that would help too......Thanks.<br/>
