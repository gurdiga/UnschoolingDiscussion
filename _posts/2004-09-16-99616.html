<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310314142">Thanks for everyones thoughts on this... especially to you Karen. We&#39;ve <br/>
been homeschooling for 11  years.. never had a problem yet. I used to <br/>
keep excellent records.. but not so good lately. Nothing has changed in <br/>
our lives that I know of.. we stay close to home a lot.. my younger two <br/>
are not into all the outside activities that my older dd used to do.  I <br/>
was so caught off guard, guess I better get busy and get some stuff down <br/>
on paper.<br/>
