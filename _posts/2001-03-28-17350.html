  Bob Jones or Abeka? Hard to say, unless he shows himself. We had something 
  similar happen on another list. Someone who didn&#39;t really fit in but wanted to 
  be included for some reason. We ended up having a heated debate and he and 
  someone else left. We were only sorry to see the other person leave, but 
  couldn&#39;t persuade her to stay. I would leave him alone unless he causes 
  trouble. Then tell him honestly that he isn&#39;t welcome. Maybe you could mention 
  the Statement of Lack of Faith everyone has to sign to be included?

Bonnie,<br/>
Is he mostly lurking and the discomfort is just that he is listening<br/>
in............or does he post a lot and contradict the support folks give each<br/>
other?<br/>
Or constantly chime in with how he wants to &quot;understand&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Being &quot;inclusive&quot;  does not mean you need or should change your dynamics upon<br/>
the demand of those who formerly excluded you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627612622">I would have to echo the same question others have asked, what about his <br/>
being on the list makes you uncomfortable?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he will learn something.  If he&#39;s determined to see your beliefs and <br/>
methods as wrong then I doubt you will have much impact on him but ya never <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to be confrontational in situations like this so I would probably ask <br/>
him why he was there.  I would probably just explain that due to being put <br/>
out of the other group you&#39;re wondering why he would join your list.  I would <br/>
be right up front and tell him that I was concerned that his motives might <br/>
not be friendly towards the group as a whole.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266202213">maybe he&#39;s just considering a change of heart himself.<br/>
Maybe he just wants to know what it&#39;s all about over<br/>
there in your happy group and gain some tips to make<br/>
his group a bit more user friendly. Put on a really<br/>
good &quot;show&quot; for him and set a lovely example and see<br/>
what happens. That&#39;s my two cents...right now anyway.<br/>
But it&#39;s the middle of the night and insomnia eats<br/>
away at my gray matter, so maybe I&#39;m wrong. :)<br/>
