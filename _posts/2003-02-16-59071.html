<div id="ygrps-yiv-706204916">I wish I could give credit to one who posted and set off a spark plug in my <br/>
brain today.  She said something about our kids having their special ways <br/>
that can be a thorn in our bonnet at times.  She said something about how <br/>
nothing is accomplished by nursing our inconveniences and offenses.  We <br/>
should focus our energy on what our child needs, put aside our emotions and <br/>
guessing &quot;why&quot; they are that way and work at helping them.<br/>
<br/>
She said it more simply but it&#39;s my best effort at paraphrase.  I know I blow <br/>
it when I &quot;think&quot; about it all too much.  I get frustrated because I don&#39;t <br/>
have the answers, no magic bullet.  The poster really helped me get my focus <br/>
back, concentrate on helping them get through the moment, help them fulfill <br/>
their needs.  Stop looking for a blanket solution.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost count of these moments I&#39;ve had here, reading the wisdom shared <br/>
here.  I&#39;m grateful and thought you should know.<br/>
