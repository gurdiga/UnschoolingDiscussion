<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029923455">This is a topic I can really relate to, so I have to come out of lurkdom<br/>
again :)<br/>
 My boy is 8 and he&#39;s a really sensitive and creative kid, but the flip<br/>
side of that is he often gets frustrated easily, throwing temper tantrums<br/>
for the oddest ( to me at least) reasons. The other day we were watching<br/>
a dvd , that we own by the way and can watch anytime, and he was geting<br/>
restless, not paying attention, so I stopped it, and he FREAKED out , and<br/>
started screaming like he was being stabbed or something, and yelling at<br/>
me to turn it on , &quot; quick, hurry,&quot; like it was a t.v. program he was<br/>
going to miss. ( In reality it was LOTR which he&#39;s seen at least 20 times<br/>
now!) We went through probably 30 minutes of screaming and crying and<br/>
teling me he hated me and pounding on the wall, before he finally calmed<br/>
down, and then - HE DIDN&quot;T WANT To watch the movie!<br/>
This happens alot, although not always as bad, when things don&#39;t go just<br/>
his way. It&#39;s a problem we deal with all the time. One thing that often<br/>
works for us, is that I will mirror his action s back to him, if he bangs<br/>
the wall , I bang the wall, and usually in a over the top exaggerated<br/>
way, or I make a really obnoxious sound or face, and we wind up laughing,<br/>
which breaks the tension.<br/>
<br/>
Reminding him/ helping him to breathe often helps as well. <br/>
<br/>
If he yells ,I hate you!, I&#39;ll say, yeah, I know, like it&#39;s no big, or<br/>
else,(in a real sweet tone:) yes, of course , I hate you too! To this he<br/>
usually responds &quot; No you don&#39;t! &quot; so I&#39;ll say No YOU don&#39;t and often<br/>
leads to a discussion about emotions, and how anger can feel like hatred,<br/>
or how you can love someone very much, but yet not like them at the<br/>
moment, etc. etc. - we&#39;ve had some pretty good conversations here.<br/>
<br/>
Often, I just sit back and let him get it out of his system, then he&#39;s<br/>
fine.<br/>
Then there&#39;s the days when my patience is short and I snap back at him<br/>
and it turns into a day long power struggle! Not proud of THOSE days, but<br/>
they happen , much more than I&#39;d like to admit :)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really offer any advce about out in public though, as I lucked<br/>
out there. He&#39;s usualy a perfect angel in front of other people!<br/>
