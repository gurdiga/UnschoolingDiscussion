 </span></blockquote>Last week when one of my best friends -- a structured homeschooler -- started <br/>
lessons with her kids, I called my husband for a pep talk.  I asked him, &quot;But <br/>
what if they never learn their times tables?&quot;  He gently reminded me that I <br/>
can&#39;t recite my times tables, either.  I was a good student, liked school, <br/>
got through college (with a science degree), graduate school and law school, <br/>
and I still can&#39;t tell you what anything above the 5 x 10 is without really <br/>
thinking about it.  He says it&#39;s kind of like those people who can&#39;t tell <br/>
their left from their right.  But you know what?  Besides thinking at various <br/>
times that I must have a screw loose since I just can&#39;t remember what 9 X 7 <br/>
or 6 X 8 is, my handy pocket calculator does me just fine.  And when the <br/>
calculator isn&#39;t handy, I can usually come up with the right answer if I take <br/>
a minute and think about it.  <br/>
