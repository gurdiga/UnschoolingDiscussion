 </span></blockquote>Well, what on earth caused  this perfect, whole, wonderful newborn you had to <br/>
become &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;unmotivated&quot;?  I doubt you saw him as a lazy and <br/>
unmotivated toddler?<br/>
Could it be that punishment and school have actually CAUSED these character <br/>
traits, rather than him being a flawed individual. He HAS interests, honor <br/>
them.<br/>
He is just fine the way he is, he simply needs time to heal. A year off? What <br/>
do you have to lose at this point? Obviously the current methods have created <br/>
a lazy, unmotivated individual ( I truly, really hope you drop these very <br/>
thoughts from your head though) and the best thing you could do to reverse that <br/>
damage is to take a year off and focus on being his friend, not punishing him <br/>
and getting really excited about the interests he DOES have.<br/>
