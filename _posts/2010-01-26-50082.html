<div id="ygrps-yiv-2128966256">I have known people to join Waldorf with their children because it is where they felt they most fit in. Two of the couples I know that have children at the Waldorf school are gay couples (one male Jewish couple and another female couple) Together, they have a total of 4 children enrolled at the school from kindergarten to grade 4. I think that depending on where you live, your acceptance into the Waldorf community based on your views or lifestyle at home could vary. Some schools will not even take you in if you have a TV, others don&#39;s care so much. <br/>
<br/>
BTW--I had a trial day yesterday of letting my son do what he wanted all day. He watched a bit of TV, looked at pictures on the computer then left it alone and did puzzles and rand around all day. We had friends over in the morning. He went to bed at his usual time by CHOICE&gt; It was a good day :) Thanks for letting me see this way as a choice too.<br/>

If children are going to be in school, a Waldorf school might be the  <br/>
VERY best option in a town, or for that family by MILES and miles.    <br/>
Absolutely sterling.<br/>
<br/>
If children are not going to be in school, though, then Waldorf&#39;s  <br/>
philosophies do not need to touch them at all, not even a little.<br/>
<br/>
When people come here and ask us to consider Waldorf&#39;s philosophies,  <br/>
the big question is WHY?  WHY should we worry about what Waldorf  <br/>
teachers make parents worry about?   Television WILL harm the peace of  <br/>
a Waldorf school.   No question.  Keeping kids quiet and in padded  <br/>
environments and believing in fairies takes effort.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about natural learning in the real world.  The real  <br/>
world has television, movies, computers.  The real world has had  <br/>
recorded music for a hundred years.  The real world has only had  <br/>
Steiner schools for a much shorter and much smaller-percentage-of- <br/>
influence time and space.<br/>
<br/>
Steiner&#39;s beliefs are not a factor in my unschooling at all,  <br/>
whatsoever.  They&#39;re interesting because they&#39;re kinda freakish, and  <br/>
because it&#39;s not uncommon for a potential unschooler to show up all  <br/>
glossed over with Steiner fairy-dust, wanting us to say &quot;oooh,  <br/>
pretty!  We want to be more like you!&quot;<br/>
