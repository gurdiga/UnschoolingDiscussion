Just because *you* see no learning or teaching value from a show like the Simpsons does not necessarily mean that the kids aren&#39;t getting some educational value from it. Perhaps they like the style of cartooning and will elaborate on it themselves later. Perhaps the particular episode of a show deals with an issue that sparks an interest which the child remembers and will persue later on. This could be true of Spongebob Squarepants or other seemingly worthless cartoons, or any other TV show considered educational or not. You just never know what the kids are actually getting out of it.<br/>

<br/>
My daughter is 5 and doesn&#39;t really care for the Simpsons, but my husband and <br/>
I love it having watched it longer than she was around.  Anyway, one day my <br/>
daughter and I had a conversation about television, and what was real and <br/>
what was made up stories.  She initially thought all animation was pretend, <br/>
and all live action was real.  We have since had over a dozen discussions of <br/>
television shows explaining that people are actors, acting out stories that <br/>
could be real or pretend.  The thing about the Simpsons (and also Scooby Doo) <br/>
is that it is an animated series with guest stars that occasionally come on <br/>
as themselves.  This sparked a continuing discussion of how an actor such as <br/>
Alec Baldwin is on the Simpsons as Alec Baldwin, and he is real, but he is <br/>
still telling a pretend story, however Bart Simpson is not real, and although <br/>
a real person does his voice, this person is not named Bart Simpson, and is <br/>
actually a woman.  So The Simpsons might not be teaching physics, but it is <br/>
teaching concepts to my young daughter.<br/>

When I was talking about SpongeBob, I was not needing to &#39;label&#39; it as educational to allow my daughter to watch it, more so I was looking for some redeeming quality that would make me more willing to &#39;suffer&#39; it being on in the living room..Does this make sense? (IE I dont like the show as it is, but maybe if in the back of my mind I can say to myself It&#39;s teaching her XX! Or it has great XX going for it..*I* would be more willing to suffer it..)<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure if that helps clarify my point/reasoning for wanting the redeeming qualities of the show or not but either way my daughter will still get to watch it if she wants to, because obviously *she* finds something redeeming in the show..<br/>

where&#39;s the problem? I enjoy TV and I enjoy computer games. So do my<br/>
kids. They have a wide variety of interests as if what they do adds to<br/>
their enjoyment of life then fair play to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096138024">Surely, Shyrley! (are they pronounced the same?) I think the core of unschooling is having fun whenever possible. If that means watching cartoons or TV, playing the computer, reading books, doing science experiments or learning algebra, so be it. True, learning algebra may not be considered fun for everybody but if there is a purpose behind it for the child (or adult), it is worth pursuing to reach a desired goal. But that choice of learning or not should be determined by whoever wants to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I agree, whether a show or *whatever* is considered educational or not is irrelevant in terms of unschooling.<br/>

  Surely the whether a show is &#39;educational&#39; or not (from an adult<br/>
  perspective) is irrelevant. Does the child enjoy the show. If yes, then<br/>
  where&#39;s the problem? I enjoy TV and I enjoy computer games. So do my<br/>
  kids. They have a wide variety of interests as if what they do adds to<br/>
  their enjoyment of life then fair play to them.<br/>
