<h4>Nancy from MI</h4>
<p><small><time>16 Mar 2001, at  6:36am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906105469">I have a question for others that have pulled their children out of <br/>
public school when they were older, say 11 or so. I have an <br/>
11-year-old daughter and when she was younger, before entering public <br/>
school, she used to be described by others as very well-spoken for<br/>
her <br/>
age. Now, I am always getting on her case for using the wrong tense, <br/>
saying &quot;ummm&quot; or &quot;like&quot; and not using easy-to-understand, complete <br/>
sentences when she speaks. Does this have something to do with her<br/>
age <br/>
or does this have soemthing to do with being around people, other ps <br/>
kids, that talk like that all day? It&#39;s very frustrating for me <br/>
because I think it&#39;s just a bad habit she&#39;s gotten into from<br/>
attending <br/>
ps. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad I&#39;ve taken her out of ps and I&#39;m beginning to see some <br/>
improvement in her speaking habits. I took both my girls out this<br/>
past <br/>
January.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, she has become much more willing to talk to people in <br/>
public, such as clerks, librarians, and others. When she has a <br/>
question while we&#39;re out, I don&#39;t even have to say &quot;go ask that lady <br/>
behind the counter ...&quot; ---- before I know it, she has gone over<br/>
there <br/>
on her own and is having a conversation. She has a tendancy to be<br/>
shy, <br/>
so I am thrilled she is pushing past this on her own.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed there is another Nancy on the board, so I&#39;ve changed my <br/>
user information to say &quot;Nancy from MI.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432222449">its something she picked up from ps. It will change. If you have her<br/>
around other adults that use the correct language at all times, like<br/>
older people and librarians, etc...she will begin to change more and<br/>
more. You say that you notice the change has started slowly. Keep doing<br/>
what you have. It will take time. Maybe have your daughter read aloud to<br/>
her siblings or other friends? Have her read aloud to someone in a<br/>
nursing home that can&#39;t read anymore. That would be a nice thing to<br/>
do...just offer it up to her and see what she says. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is a lot more outgoing now too and loves to help others. We<br/>
will be doing a bit of volunteer work in the next few weeks ourselves. I<br/>
believe that when we help others, we are also helping ourselves become a<br/>
part of a community.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have noticed my children that have been 
exclusively homeschooled have better speech patterns than the ones that spent 
years in the ps. My 14 year old was amazed just today by the 3 year old when he 
said &quot;Mom, he and I can go to the library.&quot; He was just learning in grammar 
class the proper structure. Being in your age group only tends to produce 
children that don&#39;t trust people of other ages. Homeschool is a wonderful remedy 
to this kind of elitism.</font></div>
