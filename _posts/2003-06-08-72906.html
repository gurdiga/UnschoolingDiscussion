<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why? Why not say it nice? Why not move the 2 yr. olds? I am thinking you <br/>
&gt; see <br/>
&gt; this child as someone who is lacking in parenting and you know who the <br/>
&gt; parents <br/>
&gt; are and are trying to fix the child or prove a point behind the parents <br/>
&gt; back. <br/>
&gt; That would make you the royal enforcer. You are convinced your way works or <br/>
&gt; will produce a better child. My children see me as an equal not a <br/>
&gt; disciplinary <br/>
&gt; force ruling over them. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but this isn&#39;t Heidi&#39;s child. If he can&#39;t act safely around a two year <br/>
old, I would be very forceful too. The safety of everyone at my house is <br/>
important.<br/>
If the child is hell bent on seeing adults as the enemy and ignoring <br/>
everything suggested to him, it&#39;s going to take a lot of time for him to &quot;get&quot; that <br/>
their household is run differently.<br/>
And maybe some forceful, carefully chosen words.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid was waving a stick in any childs face I would recommend they move <br/>
somewhere else and if that was ignored over and over, the stick wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
used on MY property. My two year old LIVES here. He deserves peace and safety <br/>
over the desire of the stick-waving, adult-ignoring child to wave the stick at <br/>
people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband deals in stick waving as a hobby. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If an adult were waving a stick around we didn&#39;t want him to wave, I&#39;d tell <br/>
him to stop.  If he didn&#39;t stop, my husband would take it away from him.  <br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be any different with a kid, only one of my teenagers would have <br/>
talked it out of his hand before an adult had to get involved.<br/>
<br/>
There is a fair amount of controlled stick waving, between SCA and orc ball <br/>
and Kirby&#39;s kobudo classes (bo/staff).  They know what&#39;s safe and what&#39;s not <br/>
out of the corners of their eyes, and are also way tactful about advising people <br/>
just to step back three feet or whatever will make safety without making <br/>
trouble.  <br/>

And then Marty&#39;s new interest is wrestling take-downs, so he might relish the <br/>
chance to disarm a visitor!!<br/>

reason other than &quot;You&#39;re disrupting the class&quot; but who never gets <br/>
