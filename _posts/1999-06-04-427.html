 </span></blockquote>Hi ya Priss,<br/>
I just had to say something to you for a couple of reasons.  First of all,<br/>
are you anywhere near Columbia, South Carolina?  The little girl we are<br/>
adopting is located somewhere near there (her Case Worker is in Columbia.)<br/>
The other thing is, my husband is an Engineer too!  What type of engineer<br/>
is your dh?  Mine is Mechanical, and he is behind the unschooling 120%  He<br/>
can see the benefits from the more relaxed, unforced methods.  He learns<br/>
better himself that way, with his own motivation.  The first thing he said<br/>
when I told him about unschooling, the day I discovered it here, was about<br/>
the best class he ever took in college and how relaxed the teachers style<br/>
was.  &quot;I remember more from that class than any other class I took.&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d love to have visitors here, and we may be out in your area in the next<br/>
few months to pick up our daughter, if all goes well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743045530">Hey Nanci, Columbia is only a couple hours from us too.  If you feel like<br/>
traveling, come see us.<br/>
Though if you are picking up your daughter that will probably be enough.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392422565">**** First of all,are you anywhere near Columbia, South Carolina?  The little <br/>

<br/>
Hiya back at you, Nanci! Greenville is about an hour and a half from <br/>
Columbia, not too terrible a distance. Good luck with the adoption!<br/>
<br/>
*****The other thing is, my husband is an Engineer too!  What type of engineer<br/>
is your dh?  Mine is Mechanical, and he is behind the unschooling 120%  He<br/>
can see the benefits from the more relaxed, unforced methods.  He learns<br/>
better himself that way, with his own motivation*******<br/>
<br/>
 My husband is also a mechanical engineer and he can&#39;t stand regimentation in <br/>
his own life. He doesn&#39;t like his boss breathing down his neck, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
like someone else telling him how to do his work, etc., etc. Sounds like a <br/>
natural for unschooling, huh? He&#39;s not really too bad. He agrees <br/>
wholeheartedly that history texts are for the birds, that reading instruction <br/>
is unnecessary for our son (fortunately he&#39;s already reading so that wasn&#39;t a <br/>
hurdle we had to cross), and so on. It&#39;s just math. He wants to see a regular <br/>
progression of skills being taught. We just haven&#39;t been able to make the <br/>
leap to giving our son entire responsibility for what he wants to learn. I <br/>
joined this list so I could see how it works for other people. Maybe dh and I <br/>
will get bold enough to do this :)<br/>
<br/>
*******We&#39;d love to have visitors here, and we may be out in your area in the <br/>
next<br/>
few months to pick up our daughter, if all goes well.********<br/>
<br/>
I surely hope all goes well and we&#39;d be glad to have you come this way! <br/>
