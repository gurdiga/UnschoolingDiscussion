<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   You make ferrets sound so great!! are they really easy to litter <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;ll almost always poop in a corner, so you stick newspapers in all<br/>
the corners, see which one(s) get used, and put a litter box there. That<br/>
was really all... they even make corner-shaped little boxes for ferrets<br/>
now. My ferret was an abused and abandoned ferret (a recurrent theme for<br/>
my pets), and she was very small for a ferret, she weighed just under a<br/>
pound. I used plastic tupperware containers as litterboxes, they were<br/>
about 8&quot; x 8&quot;. My parents had cages for their ferrets, very large ones<br/>
and they ran around a lot, but they never did end up reliably litterbox<br/>
trained - I think their house was too big and they needed to have a<br/>
couple boxes at least. They had, at one time, 4 ferrets, 3 dogs, 2 pygmy<br/>
hedgehogs (mean little buggers, although other people have told me<br/>
they&#39;ve had nice ones) and a chinchilla. The very, very sad day was when<br/>
someone left the chinchilla and the ferrets running around together :-(<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I had someone tell me that ferrets needed to be watched all of the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>time<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (no free roaming) because they will try to get out any hole they <br/>
&gt; could find. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They can go through very small holes, about the size of a quarter is what<br/>
I&#39;ve heard. I wouldn&#39;t want holes that size leading out of my house,<br/>
though... and Maia never tried to sneak out or anything. They&#39;re curious,<br/>
but they&#39;re a domesticated animal - Maia never wanted to leave, she came<br/>
when I called her (I gave her nutrimalt as a reward when training her).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Do they become gentle and wanting affection like a cat or dog? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maia definitely did, and so did my parents&#39; four, although to varying<br/>
degrees. Part of that may be because there were 4 of them - the rat we<br/>
had as an only rat is definitely the most affectionate, because she&#39;s had<br/>
the most attention. Buddy was the albino ferret who loved Spike the blue<br/>
heeler, he was quite snuggly. They sleep a lot but when they&#39;re up, they<br/>
tend to be more playful than cuddly. Maia would play for a while, then<br/>
crawl around and then curl up next to me and fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
She died when Rain was a year and a half old, and she was around 8 years<br/>
old then. All of our ferrets have been fine with kids except one of my<br/>
parent&#39;s females, who was the least affectionate and occasionally nipped.<br/>
They aren&#39;t great pets for little kids, although Rain loved Maia - I<br/>
personally think guinea pigs are the perfect &quot;small&quot; pets for toddlers,<br/>
because they&#39;re big enough that they can&#39;t be easily squeezed and they&#39;re<br/>
placid enough to not run away. But it&#39;s hard for a real little kid to<br/>
play with a wriggly ferret. My sister was around 6 when my parents&#39; got<br/>
their first one, though, and she was the one who convinced them to<br/>
acquire 3 more over the next couple of years...<br/>
