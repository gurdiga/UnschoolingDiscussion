<div id="ygrps-yiv-93653284">We are throwing around a label here right, left and inbetween.  Dyslexia has<br/>
become a catch phrase for many things and unfortunately &quot;real&quot; experts<br/>

the diagnosing for ADD/ADHD, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Real&quot; dyslexia is a serious problem best left to real experts to diagnosis.<br/>

it doesn&#39;t go away with age, and while most learn to compensate, most also<br/>

<br/>
My brother and sister were BOTH dyslexic and were tested, labeled, and <br/>
&quot;treated&quot; so I have a bit of experience as well as the experiences I had when <br/>
I taught. But oh right, my experiences don&#39;t count for a hill of beans with <br/>
you. Sheesh. . .nevermind. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is your theory. there are others. Many of the kids I taught in the<br/>
schools, who had been repeatedly diagnosed with &quot;real&quot; dyslexia, were<br/>
just (IMEO) not reading to read and write yet. The high schoolers I<br/>
taught, who may have been ready, had already learning that reading is<br/>
really really hard and they were no good at it anyway, so they didn&#39;t<br/>
read well either.<br/>
<br/>
My brother was diagnosed with dyslexia in 2nd grade, got special ed help<br/>
all trhough school, stumbled through, and that in his early twenties,<br/>
after he&#39;d begun working and feeling competent there, something clicked,<br/>
and he started reading fluently, for pleasure, writing well, and just<br/>
excelling all over the place.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with him, and there<br/>
never was.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049256846">There are two or three dylexia groups.  I&#39;m sure they are on the net.  I&#39;d<br/>
start with them.  It has become big $$ to diagnosis kids with all kinds of<br/>
things.  With so many of them, the diagnosis isn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; and they end up<br/>
labeled.  It is really sad to see them go through life thinking they can&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406069518">Our friend the doctor of Psychology would agree.  If it hadn&#39;t been for<br/>
the patience of his wife and the help of his sons, he never would have<br/>
been diagnosed properly.  Sure, he was compensating but he was also<br/>
frustrated with himself because he did not understand the reasons for his<br/>
problems.  <br/>
<br/>
And yes, I think a lot of terms are being applied incorrectly.  Dyslexia<br/>
gets a fair workout.  ADD/ADHD does too.  Allergy/Sensitivity is another<br/>
one.  And don&#39;t get me started on the difference between depression and<br/>
having the blues!  But that does not mean that the problems don&#39;t exist. <br/>
At this point I feel sorry for the people whose children really need<br/>
ritalin because there is so much abuse of it that they are automatically<br/>
assumed to be like those others who just want to keep their kids quiet.  <br/>
