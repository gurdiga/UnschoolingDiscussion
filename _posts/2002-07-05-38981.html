<div id="ygrps-yiv-976211456">I have been chewing on this and have a few of comments:<br/>
<br/>
1) I can see your objection to &quot;teach vs. learning&quot;. This, though is <br/>
a classic example of what I consider deschooling. My kids could give <br/>
a fiddler&#39;s fart* about teaching or learning --they are actually <br/>
playing and having a great time with what they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, am the one who qualified this as *teaching <br/>
themselves*. I wonder, though why the problem with that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
2) One could look at cognitive psychology and say that words shape <br/>
the world; therefore, the words we choose will have an impact on how <br/>
we live. I agree with that on some levels and not on others.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you may suggest learning vs. teaching, but those are your words <br/>
and not mine. I don&#39;t own them but that&#39;s OK. It does not mean that I <br/>
am doing less of a job at unschooling than other people. It just <br/>
means I have not found my own vocabulary (or at least, am in the <br/>
process of doing so).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
3) I have pointed this out before so I&#39;ll do it again: When we get <br/>
into details like *learn* vs. *teach*, what we all are doing is <br/>
insisting on an UNSCHOOLING CANON. And I have to tell you, not only <br/>
do I think it is an oxymoron, but I find that very discomforting.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is a lifestyle that is meant to counter the <br/>
&quot;pre-packaged life&quot; that social mores dictate we follow, each and <br/>
every one of us will find the words, the styles and the rituals that <br/>
will define our new lifestyle.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I understand you meant to point out the philosophical difference <br/>
between  *teach* and *learn*. Nevertheless, I particularly like the <br/>
authority reversal of my kids being their own teachers as opposed to <br/>
somebody else.  That might change though, as we do this for as long <br/>
as y&#39;all have been doing this. But then again, it is a POV that comes <br/>
natural (or should we say &#39;automatic&#39;) to me ---it is, after all, <br/>
ingrained in my native tongue, Spanish.<br/>
<br/>
In Caribbean Spanish, you do not raise children --children raise <br/>
themselves. We do not say, &quot;Cri√© a mis hijos en Nueva York&quot; (I <br/>
*raised* my sons in New York). We say, &quot;Mis hijos se criaron en Nueva <br/>
York&quot; (My sons *raised themselves* in New York). If we can &#39;raise <br/>
ourselves&#39; in Spanish, why can&#39;t we &#39;teach ourselves&#39; in English?<br/>
<br/>
It is all just a matter of perspective.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125316509">This is the second time someone has posted a response to something on one of <br/>
these HEM lists to both of them.  They really are separate lists, and if the <br/>
conversations abruptly switch because something was brought over from another <br/>
list without explanation that&#39;s going to be confusing.   I&#39;d prefer to keep <br/>
them as separate conversations, but both times it was a response to something <br/>
from me that was cross-posted with comments.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; If unschooling is a lifestyle that is meant to counter the <br/>
<br/>
&quot;pre-packaged life&quot; that social mores dictate we follow, each and <br/>
<br/>
every one of us will find the words, the styles and the rituals that <br/>
<br/>
will define our new lifestyle. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some won&#39;t find them until after their kids are grown, if then, unless they <br/>
are aware that there are differences and advantages.   Many find them through <br/>
discussion with others, and examination of their own ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not the only person who has benefited from changing &quot;teach&quot; to learn&quot; and <br/>
(for what it&#39;s worth) I myself learned that from a college professor who was <br/>
involved in the school reform movement of the early 1970&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We say, &quot;Mis hijos se criaron en Nueva <br/>
<br/>
York&quot; (My sons *raised themselves* in New York). If we can &#39;raise <br/>
<br/>
ourselves&#39; in Spanish, why can&#39;t we &#39;teach ourselves&#39; in English?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To raise&quot; children isn&#39;t such a great concept for forward-looking parents to <br/>
keep either.  I rarely hear it used at all anymore.  But I think your <br/>
parallel in English is &quot;my sons grew up in New York.&quot;  Growing up isn&#39;t just <br/>
getting taller.  <br/>
<br/>
English has two vocabularies (and then some), for having the native <br/>
Anglo-Saxon words (from Germanic) and then the whole overlay of Normal French <br/>
(from Latin) and THEN they kept half the Latin that came arou we might have <br/>
five words for something that another language has one or two for.<br/>
<br/>
But with teach and learn, there are issues of responsibility and duty and <br/>
constraint and success or failur.  If a child is teaching himself something, <br/>
he could fail.  If he&#39;s learning something, every incremental step is success.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is a transitive verb, so you have to teach someone else, or teach <br/>
yourself, but there has to be an object which is taught.  Learning is <br/>
intransitive.  It just happens inside.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090999774">Thanks for the very positive observance, and I&#39;m going to follow the advice to let my student, my child follow her own way, just to provide positive reassurance in education, I do believe that everything we do daily is learning.

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While there may be no Unschooling Canon, I do believe there is a general <br/>
*spirit* of unschooling. I read on another unschooling list and I seem to be <br/>
the instigator there. I don&#39;t mean to be. People post things like *What math <br/>
curriculum do you all use?* and I reply that we don&#39;t use math curriculum or <br/>
what ever. That sets off a storm of debate on whether or not using a <br/>
curriculum can still be unschooling. I try to explain what the spirit of <br/>
unschooling is, I must be a dismal failure though. I get replies that *We <br/>
unschool during the summer, the kids are allowed to play and have all the fun <br/>
they want exploring their own interests.* or *I let the kids study on the <br/>
porch swing or lying down on the couch.* or *We unschool subjects that don&#39;t <br/>
matter, like art and music but I make sure the kids cover the basics like <br/>
math and English. Then we do more fun things like unit studies for history, <br/>
and the kids are allowed to pick out their own reading material.* How is this <br/>
unschooling? Why deceive yourselves? Some have suggested that I am hung up on <br/>
a label or that unschooling can mean anything you want it too, it is not a <br/>
members only club. I say, no I am not hung up on a label, (but maybe I am) <br/>
and I certainly hope it isn&#39;t a club. But, to me, unschooling doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
just anything, and you can&#39;t make it mean just anything. Unschooling just is. <br/>
I too used to wonder why I was so unsuccessful. For all the attachment <br/>
parenting, family bed, prolonged nursing, freedom from institutionalized <br/>
education, I practiced, I didn&#39;t seem to be able to grasp that bigger <br/>
picture. I still had hang-ups. I wanted to use punishment effectively, I <br/>
wanted everyone to do their chores with smiles on their faces, I expected <br/>
many things to be the way I wanted them to be. Coming here has given me a <br/>
peek at the bigger picture. You can&#39;t just unschool when it comes to <br/>
*schoolish* things. You can&#39;t turn unschooling off at the end of the <br/>
afternoon and expect things to be hunky-dory. You can&#39;t respect your <br/>
children&#39;s choices in learning but not respect their choices in life. How can <br/>
we say *Johnny, mommy has decided that unschooling is what is best for you? <br/>
Now you can explore the world at your leisure, but don&#39;t forget to fold that <br/>
load of laundry exactly how I told you!* or *I trust you will learn all about <br/>
art on your own, but I am making sure you don&#39;t miss out on math!*<br/>
I certainly don&#39;t want to turn unschooling into something that says there is <br/>
only one way to unschool. I don&#39;t want visions of unschoolers at conventions <br/>
with pamphlets and smiling faces saying &quot;can I take some time to show you how <br/>
to unschool the right way?&quot; But, I firmly believe there is a spirit to <br/>
unschooling. There is a bigger picture. And thanks to people like Joyce, Tia, <br/>
Sandra, Sue, and all the others here, I see more of that picture everyday. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some won&#39;t find them until after their kids are grown, if then, unless they<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I completely get what you say and I do not disagree with anything. I <br/>
mean, really. What I am trying to articulate here is that issues of <br/>
semantics have more to do with a person&#39;s background and experience <br/>
in &quot;un-&quot; or &quot;homeschooling&quot; and less with their ability to perform as <br/>
caring and committed parents.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that these words, *teach* and *learn*, express a <br/>
relationship of power. I am not saying it is a good or a bad thing. <br/>
All I am pointing out is that, yes, they express a position of power <br/>
in which TEACH, by being a transitive verb, expresses power upon an<br/>
object; whereas LEARN, by being intransitive, expresses the power of a subject.<br/>
<br/>
These things are fascinating because, again, a lot of this is not <br/>
about what we learn or do not learn but about who has the power over <br/>
learning (or teaching). Which brings me to the comment about canons: <br/>
I am the first one to admit to having a heck of a hard time with <br/>
taking someone else&#39;s teaching.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the times I do not write observations, I teach --and it is <br/>
hard not to because, I am after all a scholar (a creative one but a <br/>
scholar, nonetheless). So I actually react at comments that I read as <br/>
*teachings* (even though I do it myself). In other words, I am not <br/>
reacting to the observation ---I am reacting to, what I took as *the <br/>
teaching*.<br/>
<br/>
All of this is part of my deschooling process and, quite frankly, I <br/>
am just letting it be. What I am trying to do with these postings is <br/>
something aching to performing a biopsy on myself --opening up the <br/>
entrails, stepping back, and just looking at what it is in there. You <br/>
may comment and I may react to it. That&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
The conversation is part of my search.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535174982">Teaching to me is a role we all play. Learning is a growth process. My son<br/>
loves to teach me how to scooter. He shows me how to put on a helmet, to raise<br/>
my handle bars, to start and stop. He shows me just how to go off a curb, to<br/>
twirl and pop wheelies. I know these things already. I have learned them. He<br/>
gets great joy showing me all the fine details he himself has learned. He is<br/>
practicing being an expert and someone who can explain an activity to another<br/>
person. We all learn, we all get taught things from others and we all teach<br/>

Anyway, he said something in P/CP that was shocking to me then, but I&#39;ve <br/>
thought about it for years and years and I believe he&#39;s right.  Maybe <br/>
someone else can remember his whole argument, but this is the part I <br/>
remember the most.  He said that (paraphrasing from long ago) teaching <br/>
was an immoral act, because it was an attempt to control the thoughts of <br/>
others.  His arguments for this were very compelling.  <br/>
<br/>
And he is a teacher by profession, too, which makes his thoughts even <br/>
more interesting to me.<br/>

&gt;I could have done a better job with just a few tweaks of my thinking.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A little bit of tweaking can go a looong way.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a baseball example.  (We&#39;re freaks about baseball around here.) <br/>
 Will plays coach-pitch.  Each batter gets 7 pitches or 3 strikes, <br/>
thrown by his own coach.  There are naturally some kids who get to 6 <br/>
pitches and two strikes every time they get up, and it&#39;s clinch time. <br/>
 If they don&#39;t hit the next pitch, the coach gets tense, the parents get <br/>
tense and all the hopes are riding on this one pitch.  <br/>
<br/>
Invariably, in 15 games this year, and in probably every game in the <br/>
last 2 seasons we were there, the coach says, &quot;Okay, Jason, you *have* <br/>
to swing at this pitch.&quot;  *swing at*.   I believe he should be saying, <br/>
&quot;Okay, Jason, you *have* to *HIT* this pitch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Simple tweak of thought and therefore expectation.  The &quot;swing at&quot; <br/>
implies to the kid that he&#39;s a strikeout.  The &quot;hit&quot; implies to the kid <br/>
that the coach still has hope.  Or maybe the coach should just harness <br/>
the power of positive thinking.  <br/>
<br/>
I would like to report that the coach changed his language and Jason <br/>
started hitting the ball.  Jason did start hitting the ball on occasion, <br/>
but it was in spite of the coach&#39;s discouraging language.  There are so <br/>
many examples in baseball that I hear male coaches use without thinking. <br/>
 I want my own team!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote> I&#39;m not sure about this one. Rain played Team Pitch Y-Ball this spring,<br/>
where you get 5 pitches from a teammate (and with the &quot;everyone plays<br/>
every position&quot; philosophy, that often means 5 balls) and then three from<br/>
a coach. If you didn&#39;t hit a fair ball by then, you were out. Some of the<br/>
kids would stand there and watch the third coach-thrown pitch go by<br/>
without swinging, and we did tell thay should swing at that pitch,<br/>
whether they liked it or not. But... I think the pressure of &quot;You have to<br/>
hit this pitch&quot; would have been pretty hard, for Rain at least, if she<br/>
had swung and missed. It&#39;s hard if someone says you have to do something<br/>
and then you try and fail. Swinging is something you can&#39;t really fail<br/>
at. It would be nice if the kid hit the pitch, but at least with the<br/>
philosophy of Rain&#39;s league, giving a good swing would be a good thing<br/>
too. Just standing there watching the pitch go by was not so good...<br/>
<br/>
It was a good starter league, very non-competitive. I much preferred it<br/>
this way, but next year she wants to do fast pitch.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that words can make a difference. I&#39;ve always thought that the<br/>
language around reading was particularly annoying, the whole idea that<br/>
one either can read or can&#39;t read. I see it as such a broad spectrum, and<br/>
most people fall somewhere between the two extremes. The two year old who<br/>
chirps, &quot;McDonald&#39;s!&quot; when he drives by the sign is reading. I look at<br/>
certain advanced textbooks on computer programming and can&#39;t understand<br/>
any of it, I have pretty much no comprehension there... it&#39;s all a matter<br/>
of degree.<br/>

learning to read.  Pointing out that symbols are representations of <br/>
words or ideas and if he recognized the symbols, he was reading, and <br/>
that there were lots more symbols to become familiar with, and that he <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are *so* fortunate that dh coaches Lars&#39; team, has since Lars was <br/>
&gt;7.  *And* that he&#39;s an awesome coach.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, my dh was the assistant coach on Will&#39;s team.  I was constantly <br/>
pointing out ways to make it more positive, because the coach sometimes <br/>
couldn&#39;t stay positive, although his negative wasn&#39;t too bad comparitively.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a kid in Little League for all of the last 15 years.  I&#39;ve had <br/>
a lot of time in the stands and lots of experiences with volunteer <br/>
coaches and time to think about how to teach kids to play baseball and <br/>
do it in a way that connects with the kid.  Some kids are way into it, <br/>
and you can talk to them rationally about the game. They&#39;ve seen lots of <br/>
professional games, play it constantly with the kids in the <br/>
neighborhood, etc.  My son is one of those. There are a few of those on <br/>
every team.  You usually only have to work on their fundamentals, and <br/>
teach them a little finesse.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also a few on every team who have rarely, if ever, played.  No <br/>
one talks to them about baseball, or they talk over the kid&#39;s head about <br/>
it.  The parents react negatively if they miss a grounder, etc.  They&#39;re <br/>
the ones in the outfield playing in the dirt or throwing their glove up <br/>
in the air.  <br/>
<br/>
So, dh and I had this long conversation about giving the kids metaphors <br/>
for their imaginations to use while they&#39;re playing the game.  When my <br/>
20 yo was playing catcher at 10 and 11, we had a conversation about him <br/>
being a giant magnet behind the plate, and that no ball could resist <br/>
him.  My son still remembers that, 10 years later.  He said it helped. <br/>
 I think kids who don&#39;t live for baseball (insert other thing here) need <br/>
a way to relate the acts of baseball, either to their life or their <br/>
imagination.  Metaphors will work for some kids, and I encouraged dh to <br/>
come up with a ready supply for the most common baseball situation.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t think dh was putting any stock in the metaphor idea.  But we <br/>
were talking about a really spectacular slide into home by Brandon, who <br/>
was playing for the first time this year.  He ran like the wind and <br/>
avoided the tag, and it was not expected to happen that way.  Dh <br/>
explained that while he was coaching third base and Brandon was stopped <br/>
there, he looked down in mock surprise and said, &quot;Look, what&#39;s that on <br/>
your feet?!  Wings!  You&#39;re feet are growing wings!&quot;  Dh said Brandon <br/>
looked up and smiled.  And then when the ball was hit, he made it home. <br/>
 For the rest of the season, every time Brandon got to third  they <br/>
talked about his winged feet.  And even if it didn&#39;t result in improved <br/>
performance, the kid is having a great time, and seeing his face light <br/>
up like that is worth it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254270851">It is not only apt, it is correct. When we look at cave paintings or <br/>
hieroglyphs, we are not studying the work of illiterates; were are <br/>
looking at a pre-literate world.<br/>
<br/>
The ability to read and understand signs is fundamental not just to <br/>
reading but to critical thinking. To get to that level though, we <br/>
have to learn how decipher not just words but the world as an <br/>
agglomeration of signs. I can&#39;t even begin to describe the many <br/>
applications these skills have.<br/>
<br/>
It was not only sad to me but also frustrating to see kids come into <br/>
an honor&#39;s level class in college because they learned to follow to <br/>
rules but never learned to think critically. Many people get creamed, <br/>
not only in college but in jobs as well because they have an <br/>
underdeveloped capacity for thinking critically. Believe it or not, <br/>
the computer revolution is not led by followers but by critical <br/>
thinkers.<br/>
<br/>
On a similar tangent, in this month&#39;s &#39;Good Housekeeping&#39; there is an <br/>
article about Intuition. I highly recommend it. As it is explained, <br/>
it has to do with a process of the brain in which it takes signs and <br/>
symbols and makes sense of these as information; filing it away in <br/>
the subconscious until the time comes for it to be used.<br/>
<br/>
So yes! Keep reading those signs. It is reading after all.<br/>
