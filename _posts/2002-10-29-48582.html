<div id="ygrps-yiv-906323643">hello all,<br/>
<br/>
This maybe totally off topic, but I am curious, have any of you ever had <br/>
experience homeschooling foster kids?<br/>
<br/>
I just recently found out that CPS took my sister&#39;s kids away from her and my <br/>
husband and I are really considering taking them.  My concern is that we may <br/>
be opening ourselves up to trouble.  I am already unschooling four of my own <br/>
and I am not sure I want my family under a microscope.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like it may be a semi-permanent situation, my sister just delivered <br/>
the third a couple of weeks ago and they found cocaine in the baby&#39;s system.  <br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how mad I am at my sister.  But I love the kids and know <br/>
that we could provide the family atmosphere that they&#39;ve been missing.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, before I tell CPS anything about my family I would appreciate any <br/>
advice.  I live in AZ so homeschooling is pretty easy, we turn in an <br/>
affadavit of intent and then they basically leave us alone.  I would also <br/>
love to homeschool her kids but don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s allowed in the foster <br/>
care program. <br/>

receptive to homeschooling.  But it had to go to court for approval.  I had <br/>
to write a detailed letter stating how I planned to meet his educational <br/>
needs.  It was obvious in my letter that we didn&#39;t do school at home, so I <br/>
was frankly surprised that it was approved.  Once we did have that approval, <br/>
no one ever checked up on us.  When I took my foster care classes prior to <br/>
being licensed, the social workers weren&#39;t very optimistic about my chances <br/>
to homeschool.  I think it&#39;s probably evaluated on a case by case basis.<br/>

<br/>
But do they have to stay wards of the state if family comes in and takes them?<br/>
Foster children are usually not allowed to be homeschooled because they ARE <br/>
wards of the state and the state says they should be in school.<br/>
But I think the fact that they&#39;re family would make a difference.<br/>
Three children added to your family is a huge change, and you have to be <br/>
honest with yourself about this. It WILL disrupt and interfere with your own <br/>
children&#39;s lives.<br/>
No way around it, they will get less.<br/>
So if you&#39;re willing to give them less and it still looks like the best <br/>
option, then I would pursue it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044967724">I don&#39;t know anything about homeschooling foster kids, but I&#39;m going <br/>
to guess that you would have an easier time if you tell them that <br/>
you&#39;re homeschooling than if you use the word unschooling.  If they <br/>
ask, tell them you use a self-designed curriculum from a variety of <br/>
sources.  <br/>
