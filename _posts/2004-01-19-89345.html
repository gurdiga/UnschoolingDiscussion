<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095194646">Such a unschooling time we had today. Went to the Pond and went fishing! Me <br/>
and Austyn searched for snails and found ALOT! We put them in a jar and <br/>
brought them home! They are now finding their new home in our fish tank! <br/>
Later we are going to look up snails online and learn about them!!<br/>
<br/>
Caitlin loved being outdoors too, and my husband got to fish (But he caught <br/>
ZERO!!!)<br/>

When the first baby laughed for the first time, the laugh broke into a <br/>
thousand pieces and they all went skipping about, and that was the beginning <br/>
of fairies. - Barrie<br/>
