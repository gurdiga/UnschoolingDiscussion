&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe the question should just be &quot;How would you treat someone you really <br/>
&gt; loved&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know it sounds irritating to people whose kids are older and who are new <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; this whole principle/respect business, who have lived by rules and <br/>
&gt; schedules, <br/>
&gt; but my kids don&#39;t misbehave.  They&#39;re honest and helpful and considerate.  <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not because they&#39;re afraid they&#39;ll get in trouble because they don&#39;t.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s because they choose to be honest and helpful and considerate, because <br/>
&gt; they see the direct value of it and the immediate usefulness and goodness <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>YES!!!  I kept reading the words &quot;willful&quot; and &quot;misbehaving&quot; and geeting <br/>
really uncomfortable feelings. I&#39;d never describe my partner that way. Why my <br/>
kid?<br/>
<br/>
Julian is not perfect....like the rest of us, sometimes he can be a jerk. But <br/>
overall, even when he was a very little kid, I didn&#39;t have to worry that he&#39;d <br/>
&quot;misbehave.&quot; He&#39;s never been spanked (well, once when he was a toddler I got <br/>
frustrated with something and did. But he didn&#39;t feel it through the diaper <br/>
and didn&#39;t notice, and I immediately burst into tears. Julian says if he <br/>
didn&#39;t notice, it doesn&#39;t count as being spanked, and after all this time I <br/>
should probably forgive myself and move on), never been grounded, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
get punished. We TALK about things.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, Beth says having to process stuff can be worse than punishment. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL  Isn&#39;t THAT the truth!  My kids have never been spanked, are never <br/>
grounded, either.  But, boy, do they dread the *talks.*  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I know they&#39;ll appreciate it one, day, though.  They&#39;re learning critically <br/>
important communication and interpersonal skills through this method.  Mutual <br/>
respect is so important.<br/>
