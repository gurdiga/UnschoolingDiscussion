<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972389999"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I&#39;m thinking 9 is a good age for swimming lessons :-) Rain already knew <br/>
&gt;&gt;how to dog paddle around, and float, and have tea parties on the bottom of <br/>
&gt;&gt;the pool, and stuff like that, just from being in the water all the <br/>
&gt;&gt;time... but she wanted to learn to swim actual strokes&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree that lessons are great for teaching strokes and such. I&#39;m not <br/>
against lessons per se. Just the idea that 3 year olds need to be in lessons <br/>
in order to get comfortable in the water. Or that kids in general can&#39;t <br/>
learn some decent strokes on their own without lessons.<br/>
I know, I know, I&#39;m preaching to the choir here.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She enjoys it a lot, and he&#39;s talked about how much faster she learns than <br/>
&gt;&gt;the 5 yr olds he teaches - probably mostly because she&#39;s not 5.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was thinking about this as I was dropping Casey off this morning for a <br/>
crafts class at the local elementary school. Why does society have such a <br/>
need to push teaching down so young? The idea of PamS&#39;s Kindergarten <br/>
readiness story. Don&#39;t they see that learning is so natural when we wait <br/>
till the child is ready rather than having yet another class to teach <br/>
readiness skills?<br/>
<br/>
I know, I know, I&#39;m preaching to the choir again. ;-)<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
