<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290194181">Hi Susan,  Book- it is a reading incentive program for children.  Basically, <br/>
children read or are read to if they cannot yet read, a certain number of <br/>
books per month (I think).  If they achieve their goal, they earn free <br/>
pizzas.  The child gets to decide how many books will be read, but a minimum <br/>
per age group might be recommended;  I don&#39;t know for sure.                     <br/>

Just to be a picky, pain-in-the-**, I&#39;ll tell you how it works around here.<br/>
<br/>
The child reads X number of books.  Is given a coupon good for one pan pizza <br/>
at Pizza Hut.  This cannot be a delivery or a to go order.  This is eat in <br/>
only.  Now, not a big deal unless the rest of the children in your family <br/>
want to eat and you are on any kind of a budget.  This &quot;free&quot; pizza, that was <br/>
supposed to be a reward for the child, ends up costing the Mom $20+ for a <br/>
lousy dinner out so it happens rarely or never.  The coupons pile up and the <br/>
whole thing is a bust.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s what I have seen, anyway.<br/>

I ONLY do take out! I refuse to add the extra pounds or have my children<br/>
listen to gum smacking little smarta**es in Pizza Hut. I would explain that<br/>
my child is participating in the program, but not going to stay in the<br/>
store. I have never had a problem, and we even call in the order, Dh goes<br/>
and gets it, and we suprise the kids with dinner (or lunch)<br/>
