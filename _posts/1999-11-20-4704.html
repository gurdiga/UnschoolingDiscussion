<div id="ygrps-yiv-364035195">I never buy playdough anymore, the stuff we make is so much better. it&#39;s not<br/>
crumbly and you can make some wild colors.<br/>
<br/>
1 cup flour<br/>
1/4 salt<br/>
2 tbls cream of tartar<br/>
1 tbls oil<br/>
1 cup water<br/>
coloring<br/>
<br/>
mix it all in a pot and stir over medium heat until forming a ball.  Then<br/>
cool. Be you can over cook it , usually by having the eye too hot.  Keeps 2<br/>
months or so in the refridge.<br/>
<br/>
The Wilton cake coloring makes for create colors.</div>

Here is the recipe I usually use. To this add food coloring and any <br/>
kind of flavor extract - pineapple, chocolate, mint, vanilla, lemon, <br/>
etc.  Or add spices. You can make different textures - try oatmeal in <br/>
it &lt;G&gt;. Make it orange and put pumpkin pie spices in it for <br/>
Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
Keep it in baggies.<br/>
<br/>
Play with more utensils than cookie cutters. Try legos &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
    •     2 c Flour<br/>
    •     2 c Water<br/>
    •     1 c Salt<br/>
    •     2 tb Cream of tartar<br/>
    •     1 tb Oil<br/>
<br/>
Combine in a saucepan and heat until it forms a sort of stiff ball in <br/>
the pan. Then turn out onto newspapers and knead for a while as it <br/>
cools. Keep in baggies.<br/>
*****************************<br/>
Packets of unsweetened Kool-aid work really well for coloring and scenting <br/>
it. You can get it really cheap sometimes. A bit less earthy-crunchy-organic, <br/>
but still cool. ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-493977162">There&#39;s a whole bunch of playdough and other craft recipes on the HUG <br/>
web site including chocolate playdouhg, my favorite:<br/>
<br/>
10 oz. chocolate chips <br/>
1/3 c. light corn syrup <br/>
Melt chocolate and mix in corn syrup. Let cool. This is great for <br/>
cake decorations! <br/>
