 </span></blockquote>Try the Kansas Bank Note Company in Freedonia, KS. They just make the checks. <br/>
You can put anything you want on them (and in any order &lt;G&gt;). You can even <br/>
have a photo/picture put on them. I have a beagle on mine. Ben has a German <br/>
shepherd. They&#39;ll take any bank&#39;s info---and they&#39;re inexpensive and fast.<br/>
