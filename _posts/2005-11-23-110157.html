it.   If that was on purpose, please keep the discussion on the list.   <br/>

=================================================<br/>
<br/>
 Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know the runaway boy is rebelling.  You suspect he is from the <br/>
letter his father wrote, but there is nothing at all concrete that proves this is <br/>
true.  Yes, you and I think he has reason to rebel, from the indicators in the <br/>
father&#39;s letter, but that is all, a suspicion.  Your emails suggest that you <br/>
have tried and convicted this family based on an internet posted letter.  <br/>
<br/>
Your example in your final paragraph below lays out just one possible <br/>
scenario of what might happen that might cause one of your children to run away.  I <br/>
don&#39;t believe in putting energy into imagining worst case scenarios by any <br/>
means, but thank you for at least opening your mind to the (remote and highly <br/>
unlikely) possibility.<br/>
<br/>
I have read thousands of auto/biographies and learned enough to say that <br/>
there is no recipe for getting to that place known as a great life.  However, if I <br/>
could name just one common thread I have discovered in my reading and <br/>
observing people for the last 40 years that contributes to that notion of &quot;a good <br/>
life&quot; I would say it is the ability to achieve a self-taught, self-directed life, <br/>
what ever it turns out to be, no matter how many times it changes form, <br/>
regardless of how much income is involved.  This is what gives me the courage and <br/>
satisfaction every day to be an unschooler and support my children in their own <br/>
efforts to achieve whatever they have a notion to do.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the part of Ren&#39;s email I agreed was true and would always be true: <br/>
 &quot;Running away is an ESCAPE. It&#39;s getting out of a situation you don&#39;t feel <br/>
 you have control over.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am enjoying this discussion.  <br/>

Certainly true, and will always be true... but things can change, sometimes<br/>
in ways we cannot predict, given outside circumstances, mental illnesses,<br/>
new influences, etc.  Who is to say?  I am confident I can adapt to<br/>
anything, and offer a safe haven for my kids under all circumstances, but I<br/>
have seen enough and read enough biography and autobiography over the years<br/>
to know that shit happens.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read much biography and autobiography of unschoolers or people whose <br/>
childhoods weren&#39;t controlled and limited?   Shit happens, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
turn a safe, peaceful home into a controlling, disrespectful-of-children home all <br/>
of a sudden.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know which part of Ren&#39;s post you thought was certainly true and <br/>
always would be true, because the rest of your writing seems to suggest there are <br/>
no solid principles to depend on.<br/>
<br/>
New influences won&#39;t keep my children from using good judgment after their <br/>
whole lifetimes of making decisions based on the best of what they know at the <br/>
time.   If they go nuts and join cults, they still won&#39;t have to run away. <br/>
  They can say &quot;I&#39;m going to join this cult.   See ya.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of controls, how could a child rebell?   In the absence of <br/>
being kept in the house, given freedom to go on road trips when they want to, and <br/>
to stay overnight with friends when they want to, what would running away <br/>
accomplish?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if Keith or I left or died and the other married someone creepy and <br/>
controlling, that might be worth running away from.   That would mean that the <br/>
contract had changed, though, the nest was broken, and the child wasn&#39;t really <br/>
leaving his home, but leaving the home of the new stepparent.<br/>
