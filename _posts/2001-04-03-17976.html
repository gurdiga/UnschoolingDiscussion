&gt; Tracy, LOL. If houses in America are anything like<br/>
&gt; those in New <br/>
&gt; Zealand, they are mostly built of timber and there is<br/>
&gt; usually a gap <br/>
&gt; between the floor and the earth. This could be<br/>
&gt; anything from a few <br/>
&gt; inches to a few feet. Most houses in NZ you can *get<br/>
&gt; underneath* <br/>
&gt; even if it is on your belly.<br/>

&gt; my dh used to be a *truckie* - some times when he was<br/>
&gt; travelling <br/>
&gt; during the night, he would come across a house being<br/>
&gt; *moved*. <br/>
&gt; The house - (would be on the back of a truck being<br/>
&gt; moved from one <br/>
&gt; location to another. They were only allowed to do this<br/>
&gt; during the <br/>
&gt; night, as the load was extra wide and sometimes takes<br/>
&gt; up the width of <br/>
&gt; the road.<br/>

What do you mean by Victorians?  Almost all houses in <br/>
the UK are stone/brick-built, expecially those built a <br/>
century or two ago.  I&#39;m supposing that&#39;s not the case <br/>
