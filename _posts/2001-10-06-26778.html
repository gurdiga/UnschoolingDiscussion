King&#39;s X from being X-spelled!  <br/>
&quot;King&#39;s X &quot; is an old sign-of-the-cross type thing.  It always saved me from <br/>
being tagged, even though there was no king and I was neither English nor <br/>
Catholic.  Some magic lives through the centuries.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950120045">In ps spelled with X  on it equals miss-spelled. But a<br/>
missed spell could be either a faulty spell or one<br/>
that manifests in the wrong place or perhaps s spell<br/>
to  casting of which one arrived too late, or perhaps<br/>
the venue was miss-placed, miss-represented,<br/>
miss-read, or even miss-spelled. We might take a spell<br/>
and spout a speil of spells, spellings and special<br/>
spoofs. And of course X marks the spot.<br/>
