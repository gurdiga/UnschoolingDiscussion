<div id="ygrps-yiv-941757538">Just wanted to share ... I got a call a few days ago from a woman <br/>
who heard I teach piano lessons. She said she had two children, ages <br/>
four and six.<br/>
<br/>
Four is sort of young for piano lessons, so I wasn&#39;t sure if she <br/>
intended lessons for both, or just the older one for now. I <br/>
said, &quot;Oh, and do both of them want lessons?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said bluntly, &quot;I don&#39;t know if they want to or not, but I want <br/>
them to!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We spoke some about my policies, schedule, etc, then I said that I <br/>
would like to meet with her and her children for about thirty <br/>
minutes, give a short sample lesson, and see if her children feel <br/>
comfortable with me, etc.<br/>
<br/>
She said something like, &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t make any difference how <br/>
they feel, I&#39;ve already decided they&#39;re going to do this. I&#39;m not <br/>
one of *those* parents who says, &#39;Oh, if you don&#39;t like it, you can <br/>
quit.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I probably can&#39;t fit them in my schedule, it turns out.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that is *so weird* to me!! Maybe I&#39;ve been reading so much <br/>
unschooling stuff lately that I&#39;ve forgotten what other parents are <br/>
like ... but I have a four year old who takes gymnastics, and I <br/>
can&#39;t even fathom it being something I decided she would do &quot;whether <br/>
she likes it or not&quot; ... and then bragging about it!<br/>

<br/>
After this part -=-She said something like, &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t make any <br/>
difference how<br/>
they feel, -=-<br/>
I would have said &quot;It matters to me, and it will matter to them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could have told her you charge double for kids who are there <br/>
against their will.   THAT might make her think about it. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love this idea!  How many of us are &quot;experts&#39; or &quot;teachers&quot; in one area <br/>
or another?  Wouldn&#39;t it start to make a lot of people think if we said <br/>
things like that?<br/>
