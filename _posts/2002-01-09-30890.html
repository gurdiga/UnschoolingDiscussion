<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037585699">I don&#39;t remember who wrote what, and I don&#39;t usually post here but I <br/>
couldn&#39;t pass up on a couple of the posts...<br/>
<br/>
The story about the 15 year old with massive problems because his <br/>
parents &quot;asked nothing of him&quot;<br/>
Is that what unschooling is being equated with?<br/>
Unschooling in the ideal situation, is (to me) a give and take, <br/>
mutual respect, not doing everything for someone.<br/>
Because many people here advocate not forcing their will upon <br/>
children, does not mean they aren&#39;t also giving their children many <br/>
opportunities to do for themselves. A big part of what unschooling is <br/>
about. Freedom.<br/>
It doensn&#39;t sounds to me like this teen felt needed nor capable. If <br/>
there was another adult living with you, would you &quot;ask nothing of <br/>
them&quot;? Of course not. The mutual give and take means treating kids <br/>
with the same respect you would give another adult. It would be rude <br/>
to try and do for another adult, the things they could do themselves. <br/>
If you understand child development and enable kids, this type of <br/>
respect will give them profound confidence in their abilities. Not <br/>
what that teen had at all.<br/>
I get frustrated when I see Unschooling being equated with doing <br/>
everything for a child...the opposite couldn&#39;t be more true.<br/>
But when the child asks for help, we willingly give it, just as if <br/>
another adult asked for our help.<br/>
Give and take, mutual respect...do you see what I&#39;m saying?<br/>
That story about the depressed 15 y.o. is like comparing apples to <br/>
oranges (or onions more like it).<br/>
And was he homeschooled? Did he have choices about the direction his <br/>
life would take? Maybe that fed the depression as well?!!<br/>
Parents that do everything for their child, whether the child wants <br/>
it that way or not, are sending the message that the child isn&#39;t <br/>
capable.<br/>
They are also disrespecting that childs wishes and needs.<br/>
Child-led learning does neither of those things.<br/>
It respects the child&#39;s need to attempt activities on their own, it <br/>
says we must assist as needed, that we give them freedom to explore <br/>
the world on their own terms and bring them into our world as human <br/>
beings worthy of being part of the adult world...not lesser citizens.<br/>
To tell that story as though it&#39;s the result of what allowing <br/>
children to make their own choices is false.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve noticed in the TV discussion that certain individuals use <br/>
the terms &quot;educational&quot;...<br/>
I think it pays to lose those narrow definitions of the world if we <br/>
are to embrace unschooling in it&#39;s most joyful form.<br/>
To value all activities as worthy is so helpful!!  It certainly has <br/>
helped me to try and lose those ideas of what is <br/>
educational/noneducational, worthy/not worthy etc....when looking at <br/>
the things my kids choose.<br/>
Life is learning. All activities can teach us something. And learning <br/>
all the time is what unschooling is all about.<br/>
Humans learn....you can&#39;t stop it unless you try to force it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944029304">I&#39;m glad you responded to the post.  I was the one who wrote it and the reason I added it, was to give examples of children who watch TV all the time.  I am just learning about unschooling and that is why I am following this list so all of your input helps expand my narrow view.  I have never ever met a homeschooled child(except my own - just started in September) or family let alone an unschooled child.  Sarah and others have brought up the fact that respect for children as equals is very important.  I strongly agree!  Sarah also said that possibly the fact that the two children I mentioned are ps kids has a lot to do with why they veg in front of the TV a lot.  I have no way of knowing.  I am a keen observer of parenting styles, I look at what works, what doesn&#39;t and try to figure out why.  I think you hit the nail on the head when you said my nephew doesn&#39;t feel needed or capable and your reasons make a lot of sense.  Your description of an unschooling family is certainly one I aspire to have.  Posts like yours go a long way in helping me attain my goal.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can see how you would get that idea.  I think that somethings that <br/>
have been said here leave that impression when the reality is quite <br/>
different.  For example, there was talk a while back about what to do <br/>
if you need to go out but your child does not want to.  The <br/>
impression I first got was that these people let their kid&#39;s needs <br/>
override their own entirely.   I truly believe that that is not the <br/>
case, but given only the statements in those posts, that was how it <br/>
sounded.<br/>
I do think there are many people who do too much for their children <br/>
and don&#39;t allow them to learn to deal with life.  I suspect they <br/>
exist in many circles, from unschoolers to public schoolers.  The <br/>
problem is not confined to any one group.<br/>
