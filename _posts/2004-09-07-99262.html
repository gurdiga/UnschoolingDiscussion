My son  withdrew from high school today. He told his friends he had decided <br/>
to &quot;take  the <br/>
road less traveled.&quot; His school friends are jealous; his teachers,  genuinely <br/>
sad to lose him <br/>
(he particpates in class, of all  things!).<br/>
<br/>
And he is so happy today. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had a great (nearly)  two years with our younger kids and see <br/>
unschooling going <br/>
swimmingly for  them. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m excited to see what happens with my oldest... I can feel the  scales fall <br/>
from our eyes.<br/>
<br/>
And who knows what my sophomore daughter  will do come the end of the <br/>
semester? <br/>

Well, Julie, you really might want to purchase a copy of Cameron&#39;s first  <br/>
film----It&#39;s entitled &quot;The Road Not Taken&quot;----about leaving school and why. Very  <br/>
sweet.<br/>
