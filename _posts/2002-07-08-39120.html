<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408422192">so so true about the correcting.. my eldest, 14, has an extraordinary vocabulary and is a wonderful writer.. but cannot spell correctly to save his life.. .. his teachers have worried so much about this.. (and of course his bad handwriting..) we used it to our advantage.. got him tagged &quot;disgraphic&quot; as well as &quot;ADD&quot; thus invoking the magical 504 forms/designation.. so we can demand all kinds of things/alternate methods of assessment etc... it got him thru jr hi.. (luckily my other one will never have to experience jr hi at all...)<br/>
<br/>
got sidetracked... <br/>
this criticism kept him from writing at all.. for a while.. and my younger son, 8, has been held back so much my the simple criticism of &quot;messy work&quot; .. it disgusts me to see &quot;teachers&quot; (and i use the term loosely.. especially in light of the teach/learning discussion) just stopping these kids in their tracks .. PREVENTING learning with these petty complaints..<br/>
<br/>
(oh, and have any of you ever had a public school teacher go on and on about how your child is just &quot;not doing a good job with his cutting and pasting&quot;? .. hahahaha.. i just can&#39;t get over that one.. <br/>
OOOOOooooooo i&#39;m SO worried about cutting and pasting skills... i&#39;m sorry, it just sounds like  a joke to me.. altho they want to say it is THE indicator of hand eye coordination.. and this at five and six years old..... hahahhh... )<br/>

  &gt; No, you don&#39;t correct spelling for your child, any more than we would<br/>
  &gt; correct yours. Writing is what&#39;s important. If you correct her spelling,<br/>
  you<br/>
  &gt; risk spoiling it for her, and turning yourself into a &quot;teacher&quot;...heaven<br/>
  &gt; forbid. She&#39;ll learn spelling in other ways.<br/>
