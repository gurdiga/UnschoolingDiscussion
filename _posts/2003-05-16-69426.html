heard about unschooling through the kid&#39;s other caregiver&quot;.  You don&#39;t<br/>
want to exclude the reluctant Moms from the families with<br/>
Pro-Unschooling Dads.  Not to mention the other caregivers that a child<br/>
might have.<br/>

Yeah, they might!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who&#39;s reluctant at a conference will benefit from any and all of it.<br/>

Dad&#39;s have that dad thing which won&#39;t go away whether they&#39;re reluctant or <br/>
not.<br/>

I agree with Sandra!  I bought and old tape of Dad&#39;s from the Sacramento<br/>
conference and one of my friend&#39;s husbands was speaking on it.  His<br/>
voice was clearly recognizable to me, even though I didn&#39;t know he had<br/>
been at this long-ago conference.  (He did say anything too incriminating.)<br/>
<br/>
Instead of listening to a tape, each woman can &quot;debrief&quot; her husband<br/>
after the discussion.  Think how much fun that could be if you took it<br/>
literally!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
