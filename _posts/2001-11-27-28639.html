I have mostly skimmed this subject as I&#39;m tryiong to catch up.....content<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to match the subject line.<br/>
I agree with you on this,  though I find it really difficult not to say it<br/>
at times.....OTOH,  much more effective IMO to allow the consequences to<br/>
speak for themselves.  Just last evening,  my dd had two friends over.  I<br/>
told them they neede to leave by XXXX time so that we could get dinner have<br/>
the evenings plans work out. (The plans were for dd to attend a program at<br/>
our local library).  XXX time came,  I said to dd and friends,  it&#39;s xxx<br/>
time.....you agreed to go home and dd you will bea ble to do a,b,c and have<br/>
time to get to your program.  Then I had to go finish dinner.  I gave them<br/>
one more verbal cue.  Well,  20 minutes later,  thay were finally leaving.<br/>
Dinner was 15 minutes later and dd wasn&#39;t ready to leave on time.  I was<br/>
able to remain detatched.  After she was through being upset,  we were able<br/>
to discuss how to make it work next time.<br/>

I don&#39;t believe they need to &quot;hear that actions have consequences....  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
  They can learn this just by experiencing the consequences.  Just by the<br/>
fact that we lose control they are seeing and experiencing that we are<br/>
not perfect and only human.  They are learning from this too.  They<br/>
don&#39;t need to be told.<br/>
