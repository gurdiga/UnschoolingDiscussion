<div id="ygrps-yiv-1674129091">I&#39;m not a newbie to hs but to unschooling. My history is 6 yrs of <br/>
electic schooling.  Perhaps my perspective is wrong but:  doesn&#39;t <br/>
everyone who is new to unschooling go thru a pre-unschooling?  <br/>
Whether it be the deschooling process if your child has participated <br/>
in any type of formal schooling or school at home.<br/>
Whether it be the waiting game for your children to find an interest.<br/>
<br/>
As a newbie who has become aware over the past 6 years of the <br/>
benefits of unschooling I consider myself a pre-unschooler.  What a <br/>
title.  Try to explain that to your unrelenting relatives.<br/>
<br/>
This pre-unschooling time so far is full of doubts.  How come my 10 <br/>
year old can&#39;t find any thing to interest him?  He&#39;s still waiting <br/>
for me to tell him what to study.  How come my 6 year old refuses to <br/>
have any thing to letters and sounds?  She was burned out last year <br/>
on the reading program we had chosen.  But does that mean she will 21 <br/>
before she wants to try again?  Ha!<br/>
<br/>
Anyways I think that pre-unschooling can encompass more than just <br/>
toddlers &quot;graduating to Kindergarten and beyond&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just my thoughts<br/>

anymore.  Tell him all he has to do is play.  <br/>

through what you call the pre-unschooling stage for sure. I&#39;m also amazed at <br/>
the numbers of parents who just seem to accept unschooling in all its glory <br/>
right from the start.<br/>

It will help if you stop thinking of it as studying and start thinking of it <br/>
as exploring, investigating, checking out, glancing at, etc. His interests <br/>
may never look like the studying a topic that you&#39;re used to from the <br/>
schoolwork days. But he will deschool awhile and then start to get intrested <br/>
in lots of things that don&#39;t look like studying at all. Those are the <br/>
unschooling interests that can lead all sorts of places.<br/>
<br/>
Real life interests aren&#39;t divided into neat little subject areas. That&#39;s <br/>
for the schools. Our kids get to connect little bits of history with bits of <br/>
math with something they saw on TV with skateboarding with a book they&#39;re <br/>
reading....It all counts and it&#39;s all connected.<br/>

when she&#39;s ready. In the meantime, keep reading her lots of great books and <br/>
magazines and filling her world with words.<br/>

Thanks for the encouragement.  This goes against everything I was <br/>
ever taught. I think it is a matter of me deschooling more than my <br/>
son.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement.  When you mentioned being amazed at how <br/>
some parents take to unschooling from the beginning, I thought of one <br/>
idea.  I believe it has a lot to do with how you are raised and the <br/>
emphasis that is put on schools.  In my family, college was never not <br/>
an option and I know that most of my family believe I am wasting my <br/>
expensive education by staying home.  In fact there isn&#39;t a month <br/>
that doesn&#39;t go by that someone doesn&#39;t encourage me to get a job.<br/>
<br/>
And then there is the matter of what schools must you attend.  <br/>
Perhaps the easily adapted parents that unschool came from families <br/>
where investigation was encouraged.  Instead of &quot;don&#39;t go against the <br/>
grain&quot; or &quot; what would so and so think&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I think that I need to deschool somewhat too.  <br/>
<br/>
One question, I have noticed that by my children&#39;s investigating- <br/>
when they see something interesting they are all for checking it out <br/>
but quickly get bored or don&#39;t want to go in depth.  How do you keep <br/>
up b/c I find myself getting these great ideas only to find myself <br/>
left in the dust and they have moved on.<br/>

<br/>
My husband used to have his feelings hurt if a kid asked a question and then <br/>
didn&#39;t want a twenty-minute session.  I helped him see what small units <br/>
information-requests can be, and to trust that they&#39;ll be back when they want <br/>
the next bit.  But if he insists on doing a lecture for every little math or <br/>
science question, they&#39;ll just learn not to ask!<br/>
<br/>
In school, lessons are 45 minutes long or so but in real life learning can <br/>
take as little as one second.  Thirty-second &quot;lessons&quot; and two-minute <br/>
show&#39;n&#39;tells will, over the years, add up to more learning than many hours of <br/>
droning introduction, lesson and summary sessions could ever.<br/>
<br/>
A good example is when a kid asks where babies come from.  Going to dig out <br/>
your old &#39;101 sexual positions&#39; book is WAY way way too much information!!!!  <br/>
He wants &quot;they grow inside their moms.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Five seconds.<br/>
<br/>
If he wants more, he&#39;ll ask.  It might be then, it might be in a year or two.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lol! You know what I did this spring? The kids and I had an <br/>
appointment in a new area.  On the way home we spotted this little <br/>
park so we stopped to explore.  We had a blast, and the kids were <br/>
enthralled with the little stream that was flowing through it.  We <br/>
followed the stream until we came to a bigger branch in the river.  <br/>
They asked all kinds of questions about where rivers start and end.  <br/>
They wanted to know which river this was, and I didn&#39;t know so I went <br/>
home and got out our map.  I showed them where the river started and <br/>
how it ended in the ocean.  Then I showed them other rivers that we <br/>
had been to.  This was all they really wanted, but I got out of hand! <br/>
lol <br/>
<br/>
I went to the internet and found a website about the town where the <br/>
lake of this river started.  I found that you can get a boat ride of <br/>
the lake, and even go fishing on the boat.  I found a cute little <br/>
hotel with a play area and a beach. <br/>
<br/>
Then I went to the website for the town where the river empties into <br/>
the Chesapeake bay.  I even went to the website for the city where <br/>
the bay empties into the ocean.  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Then I got even more out of hand.  lol  I called the Chesapeake bay <br/>
alliance and asked them to send me a wall map of the entire river.  I <br/>
hung it up and took the kids on a few day trips where there were <br/>
other branches of this river and we put stickers on the places we <br/>
visited.  <br/>
<br/>
Then my sweet daughter ever so lovingly broke it to me that they <br/>
really weren&#39;t into all this.  I realized that I was trying to turn <br/>
one day&#39;s fun and interesting questions into this big thing so that I <br/>
could say, &quot;Look at the neat things unschooling can lead to&quot; lol I <br/>
really am sitting here laughing at myself now.  Thank goodness I <br/>
hadn&#39;t booked any motels yet! <br/>

lived there with him and the kids uptil 4 years ago.  We moved away <br/>

Song by . . . by . . . by . . . well I&#39;ll think of her name <br/>
eventually.  The kids in Homecoming are abandoned by their mentally ill <br/>
mother and make their way to their grandmother&#39;s on Chesapeake <br/>
Bay.  There&#39;s quite a bit of information about the area woven into the <br/>
story.  The main character is a young teen, so it&#39;s probably aimed at <br/>
pre-teens to early teens.<br/>
