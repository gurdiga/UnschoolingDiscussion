<div id="ygrps-yiv-36187723">&quot;I don&#39;t think we need to kill to feed our families.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re a vegan now? REally? I thought you said you weren&#39;t. So <br/>
you are killing to feed your family.<br/>
<br/>
I have an aquaintance whose family hunts. They think the meat in <br/>
stores is unhealthy, full of hormones and all (I agree), and they <br/>
save a LOT of money by hunting. They spend time as a family, doing <br/>
what they love...it&#39;s one way they save money so that the mother can <br/>
be home with the children and homeschool. They are one of the <br/>
healthiest families I know, both physically and emotionally.<br/>
<br/>
My Grandparents were farmers, mostly beef. They had healthy, free <br/>
range animals and lived a hard working and enjoyable life together. <br/>
Grandpa is almost 90 and doing well for his age...still helping in <br/>
the garden, puttering with his Model &quot;T&quot; and caring for their large <br/>
property. He owned guns his whole life and manages to raise a son <br/>
(my Dad) that can&#39;t stand hunting, preferring to shoot animals with <br/>
a camera instead. How&#39;d that happen?<br/>
I couldn&#39;t hunt myself. The only thing animal based that I eat is <br/>
honey and an occasional egg. But I think your arguements are hollow, <br/>
fearful and completely insane.<br/>
