<div id="ygrps-yiv-37009589">&lt;&lt; I was thinking about what I wrote before I went to sleep last night, <br/>
and it<br/>
occured to me that I should have said medical adivce, not homeopathic<br/>
advice. I was too tierd to get up and fix it. You are definitely right<br/>
that not everyone knows what it is, and hence couldn&#39;t ask directly about<br/>
it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess that because of the mind frame of the Western culture, <br/>
homeopathy is considered only a medical science. Even Hahnemann, the <br/>
father of modern homeopathy, used the term &quot;Medical Art,&quot; perhaps trying <br/>
to convey that it was more than just another medical practice. In the <br/>
West we don&#39;t have a concept like say, &quot;Ayurveda,&quot; which means &quot;Science <br/>
of Life,&quot; and encompasses more than the &quot;medical&quot; aspect of life. It is <br/>
a more holistic and true way of expressing what Ayurveda focuses on. <br/>
Unfortunately, we don&#39;t have a better term to convey what homeopathy is <br/>
in a more holistic manner. Not that it does not treat (and cure) people <br/>
with severe diseases, but its focus is not only the &quot;removal of <br/>
disease,&quot; but the fulfilment of the individual.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m assuming you LIKE being here and have things to say. Joyce has <br/>
made it clear that you are welcome, and merely asked you to think about <br/>
your style. I haven&#39;t<br/>
insinuated that you shouldn&#39;t post, and it wouldn&#39;t be my place to do so<br/>
anyway.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My last posts were for clarity&#39;s sake only. I go to the yahoo site every <br/>
now and then, and check the posts or threads that catch my attention. I <br/>
don&#39;t have time to follow all of them. I had more time around Chritmas, <br/>
but now I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I like it better if I feel I can participate, of course...  ;-)<br/>
