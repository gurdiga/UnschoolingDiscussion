&lt;&lt; Marji, who&#39;s grateful that her mother has never visited her!  Can you <br/>
believe that? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can I believe that you&#39;re grateful, or can I believe she&#39;s never visited??<br/>
<br/>
I hope my kids never say &quot;I&#39;m grateful my mother has never visited me,&quot; but I <br/>
am NOT really on visiting terms with my own mother who lives in the same city.<br/>
<br/>
I went through a year of seeing her once or twice a month, a full year ago.  <br/>
When she was evicted I declined to help.  She hurled some insults at first, <br/>
but I said my half-brother got her evicted, he can help find her an <br/>
apartment.  She got help from others, and she got into an apartment.  I <br/>
haven&#39;t been there but have mailed a couple of things to her.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind things being different (years back) but I don&#39;t mind much <br/>
that they are as they are.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like for my kids to like me enough to have me visit, but then I think of <br/>
other mammals and whether their grown offspring come back to visit.  Either <br/>
they stay in the same group (chimpanzees?) or they never look back (lions?).  <br/>
 Maybe what I get is the childhood and IF I get future relationships that&#39;s <br/>
just icing on the cake.<br/>

But look at the reality in the rear-view mirror.<br/>
<br/>
Even some of the most extreme Christian homeschoolers I&#39;ve read want nothing <br/>
to do with their parents.  Why?  They&#39;re not Christian, or not Christian <br/>
enough.    <br/>
<br/>
My own three Baptist cousins would have NOTHING to do with their father (a <br/>
former Baptist preacher) because he was no long Baptist.  <br/>
<br/>
If one of my boys marries someone who&#39;s sure formula feeding and daycare are <br/>
great ideas, I&#39;ll have the choice of pretending I think it&#39;s fine (what are <br/>
the odds?) risking making them all really angry, or just staying away.<br/>

Well I guess I just have the confidence right now to know that my kids will <br/>
&quot;know&quot; how I feel long before they get to that point. Meaning I won&#39;t have <br/>
to tell them. It would be wonderful if they adopted the same lifestyle they <br/>
were brought up in, but realistically, it may not happen. I&#39;m okay with <br/>
that, I think, but again, they will raise their own children without <br/>
interference from me. As hard as it will be. &lt;BG&gt; But I will still want to <br/>
be a part of all that. I&#39;m actually looking forward to it.<br/>

<br/>
I think all parents feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
The strictest probably believe it the most.  And so if the kids stay, it&#39;s <br/>
because they&#39;re Godly and if they leave, Satan did it.  But nowhere is it the <br/>
parents&#39; fault if the kids &quot;leave the fold&quot; (meaning the church way more than <br/>
the house).<br/>
<br/>
I do like to think that raising kids in freedom, based on principles of being <br/>
excellent to one another (or whatever &lt;g&gt;) will make it harder for them to <br/>
rebel.  How can you rebel against THAT?<br/>

Yes, one who will be 17 shortly. One that has gone through hell and back and <br/>
so have we. But we fixed it and all is well. Can&#39;t say she ever really <br/>
wanted me to not be around or held a grudge against any mistakes I made. We <br/>
do make mistakes but my husband and I are great parents. Can&#39;t help but have <br/>
great kids!! Great kids that I see being around, maybe not always <br/>
physically, but still here.<br/>

I totally know and understand what you are saying,  I think its hard for a parent to see a child turn out a way that they think isn&#39;t &#39;right&#39; or the way they wanted.  They can&#39;t let go of what they want and let the child do what is in the childs heart?  Maybe?  This is what I see in my parents case.  Why can&#39;t they just see that their children are just fine the way they are?   (This could be an everlasting thread!)<br/>
Do you do your work from your home?  I&#39;m trying to figure out something like this for me and my husband.  <br/>
I was wondering if I could e-mail you? I didn&#39;t want to bore everyone with my questions, it&#39;s not exactly about unschooling, but I&#39;m hoping it might be a way that both of us can unschool our children successfully!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;When she was evicted I declined to help.  She hurled some insults at first,<br/>
&gt;but I said my half-brother got her evicted, he can help find her an<br/>
&gt;apartment.  She got help from others, and she got into an apartment.  I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t been there but have mailed a couple of things to her. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh.  The important part of that story is is that she called me all in a panic <br/>
once and said &quot;I have to move out of here TODAY.  Help me.&quot;  (She was living <br/>
with two alcoholic friends in a trailer, and they had had a fight, and she <br/>
was afraid.)<br/>
<br/>
I had an apartment for her within 24 hours, and found people to help her move.<br/>
<br/>
Because of it not being between the first and 5th, I paid her rent (they <br/>
would have charged her for part of a month if I hadn&#39;t paid the way I did), <br/>
and each month after paid her rent on time, and then she gave me a post-dated <br/>
check which we deposited a few days later.<br/>
<br/>
THAT is the apartment she got thrown out of.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t keen to help her find another one.<br/>
<br/>
And my brother isn&#39;t the one who ultimately helped her.  The two friends she <br/>
had moved out on a year before did.<br/>
<br/>
So no doubt in their discussions of all this, over beer and cigarettes, I&#39;m <br/>
the bad guy.  Unreasonable.  Cold.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006939693">Nancy and others,<br/>
 <br/>
My husband and I are trying to figure out a way of making a living and him being able to be around more.  Right now he makes a good living but he is gone each day, like most of the other working people.  Well,  I feel like there&#39;s no reason why we both can&#39;t be home and do something from home.<br/>
I have been trying to get a book called Unjobbing, but they ran out of it at Amazon and I need to get on Fun books and look it up.  I think it would really help us on this.<br/>
I&#39;m willing to move out of our new house into something less expensive hence cutting our expenses,  but you do have to put food on the table some way.  He is much less comfortable in taking this kind-of risk, but I&#39;m going to do the research and then we&#39;ll decide.  He&#39;s hoping we can for sure be doing something different in about 2 years.  I&#39;m hoping we can do something about this now!    I feel bad he has to be stressed out with his job and I&#39;m at home with the kids and loving it.   Just wishing he could be part of this.  <br/>
I&#39;m also researching some different options that the kids could be part of.  But I&#39;m in the beginning of that too.  I would love to have a little farm, grow our own food and stuff, could have a little petting zoo for extra income, thought I could sell home grown treats, crafts and things in a gift shop.  This would  all be great for the kids too!  Anyway,  this is my little dream.  I&#39;m quite convinced that I could make a go of it,  my husband on the other hand is much more &#39;realistic&#39; than me.   He probably sees alot of the things that would be harder to do, travel, and such. <br/>
 <br/>
Back to my brainstorming!<br/>

I think the real important thing in finding happiness with work is to find <br/>
something that you really enjoy and are good at. It could start with <br/>
soemthing as simple as being around people and then you expand on that. <br/>
Kelli, I can hear the excitement in your post when you talk about the farm, <br/>
petting zoo and gift shop. Sounds as if that&#39;s something that you would <br/>
enjoy and also be good at. Is there something in all that which appeals to <br/>
your husband? What is he good at and likes to do? Is it the  business end of <br/>
running such a business or building stuff or farming or just the whole <br/>
planning and advertising part of it?<br/>
<br/>
Again, I thinks it&#39;s important to find something you will really like.<br/>
There are great jobs with big pay and miserable people. It&#39;s a matter of <br/>
priorities too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607202446">This sounds familiar!!  The cornerstone of my dream --which dh and the<br/>
kids are really open to --is to own and operate an herb farm!   And of<br/>
course grow so many herbs that I need dh to work with me and the kids.<br/>
We currently live in MA but are looking into Maine or possibly NH or VT<br/>
also.  I am thinking we could sell potted herbs, dried herbs and<br/>
eventually bulk!  Does anyone know of some old farm houses in good shape<br/>
in these areas?   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know how much of a help this would be to you, but have you read any <br/>
of Amy Dacyczyn&#39;s Tightwad Gazettes? She promotes thrift as a lifestyle, she <br/>
worked from home for years publishing her newsletter and then complied the <br/>
best of her newsletters into three books called The Tightwad Gazette (also <br/>
T.G.II and III) She and her family live on a small farm in Maine, they raise <br/>
most of their food there. I think she still gives talks, but I don&#39;t know. I <br/>
don&#39;t know how much this would help but, if you are looking for ways for you <br/>
husband to be at home more and live on less, then she has some really great id<br/>
eas. <br/>
<br/>
I wish you lots of luck, I am struggling with my own ideas and wants for our <br/>
family and they seem to be conflicting with my husbands ideas. I wish he <br/>
would be more willing to take some risks too.<br/>
