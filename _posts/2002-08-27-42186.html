 </span></blockquote>I think you missed the point, Ned. It isn&#39;t that you aren&#39;t stakeholders and <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be here and be helpful, it is that perhaps you&#39;re not as interested <br/>
in the day-to-day how to live an unschooling life as others and perhaps that <br/>
is why you can&#39;t seem to understand or respect the difference between a hsing <br/>
politics list and this one.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve posted enough, on this subject, though and will cease and desist <br/>
and just stick, myself, to unschooling discussion, from now on.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Accuracy builds credibility over time -- the above is patently inaccurate. <br/>
Talking about how schools have damaged children is often a topic on this list <br/>
and people always respond with great ideas of how to avoid creating that kind <br/>
of damage at home and how to help children heal from the damage, etc.<br/>
<br/>
That is a regular topic of conversation here and nobody has said that it <br/>
should not be and many have repeatedly said that it is appropriate. <br/>
<br/>
One list cannot be all things to all people. This list is clearly intended to <br/>
be support for parents who are either unschooling or interested in <br/>
unschooling their children. Anybody who sticks mostly to posting with that <br/>
purpose in mind will arouse no complaints from other listmembers, even if <br/>
they do swerve away from that primary purpose occasionally.<br/>
