 </span></blockquote>I ride a road/tourer so its heavier than a race bike but much lighter than a moountain bike. It&#39;s fitted with front n rear panniers and fenders and lights. Has the drop road handlebars too. Wider tyres.<br/>
They are 700x32.<br/>
<br/>
By Lycra set I mean them people who think what you wear is the most important part of cycling and are poseurs. Those are the ones who would never help you fix a flat and they sneer at me with my bike<br/>
festooned with bungee cords and stuff. I even bungee my walking stick onto my bike so I can hobble round the supermarket at the other end of the journey ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I learned that bikes don&#39;t fit in suitcases today :-(<br/>
<br/>
Really really must pack for this trip....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-981402126">I hear you. Brianna & I know we need the conversion van. With my back, I cannot sleep in a step van - on a low matteress. I wanted a van we could sleep in - comfortably.<br/>
<br/>
We load it - go to powwow - set up (very tiring) and we need a comfortable place to sleep.<br/>
Last year, as we ran out of our tent because a tree was breaking and about to crash onto it - I decided that we would be sleeping in something that was mobile.<br/>
and security is an issue.<br/>

However, we need to get the money to fix the bikes; we are pagans; I need the exercise.<br/>
