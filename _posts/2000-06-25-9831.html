What did feminism get us?  Nothing can be completely attributed to feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the particular times for each thing.  However, I think I can name a few things that I think feminism had a definate impact and motivating affect upon.  For one thing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot; professions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters) and friends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue the career of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL benefit for having that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in important fields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>
<br/>
For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in domestic violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.  <br/>
<br/>
For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to women in religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices more available because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine religions.  While religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big boost due to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism movement and the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to access these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is not so much totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the duality, the balance.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves through dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion and it&#39;s skewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)  <br/>
<br/>
And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only are women&#39;s mental and emotional states less jokes and more recognized for their uniqueness and treated as such, but health issues that were largely ignored or mistreated (Pregnancy-Birth issues, Breast Cancer, PMS, Menopause, etc) are now getting the attention and respect that they deserve.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can come up with at this late hour, off the top of my head, with sick kids to worry about.  Yes, every social reformatting gives us pros and cons.  But we also LEARN.  We learn what was bad about the old ways, and what we liked, what was BETTER.  Then we have the information, the ability and the FREEDOM to choose how to combine the old and the new into a satisfying whole.  Each new change brings learning, and may it never stop!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-301498091">Here are just a few of the things feminism got us...<br/>
<br/>
First feminist movement:<br/>
the right to vote<br/>
the right to own property<br/>
the right to have custody and control of our children<br/>
laws against beating women<br/>
<br/>
Second wave:<br/>
marital rape laws-)until the mid 80s it was legal in many states for a man<br/>
to rape his wife)<br/>
protection from being fired for being pregnant<br/>
closing the wage gap<br/>
awareness of and better reactions on the part of law enforcement to battering<br/>
health reserach is now beign perfornmed on women instead of exclusively<br/>
men(did you know that until very recently all breast caner research was<br/>
done on men so we have no idea if its actually valid for women!!??)<br/>
<br/>
I could list volumes more, but I have to go on an unschooling adventure<br/>
with my kids...<br/>
<br/>
I hope this attack of feminism stops soon.  I think there are problmes in<br/>
this country and even with some people who call themselves feminist but I<br/>
strongly belive they stem from the corpoate culture that has invadewd this<br/>
country.  Its all about profits dontcha know.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;O.K., this is an serious, honest question and not an attempt to start<br/>
&gt; &gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;war.  I would really like to hear exactly what it is folks think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;feminism &gt;has gotten for us.  Rowe vs. Wade was not the result of<br/>
&gt; &gt;feminism,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;we don&#39;t &gt;have equal pay for equal work, so exactly what have we gained?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Lynda, who will now jump into her flame proof suit %-}<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmmm...Interesting question Lynda.  Now I have to think right?  OY!<br/>
&gt; &gt;After<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the week I have had I don&#39;t know if I am functional enough to use<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;brainpower, and now both my kids are sick and I am taking turns running<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;between rooms to administer medicine, adjust the steamers, kiss sweaty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;little brows and soothe fussy, achey bodies.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;What did feminism get us?  Nothing can be completely attributed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;times for each thing.  However, I think I can name a few things that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;think feminism had a definate impact and motivating affect upon.  For one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;thing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;professions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters) and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;friends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;career of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL benefit<br/>
&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;having that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;fields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in<br/>
&gt; &gt;domestic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to women<br/>
&gt; &gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;available because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine religions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;While religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big boost<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;due to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism movement<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;and the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;access these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is not<br/>
&gt; &gt;so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;much totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;duality, the balance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves through<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion and<br/>
&gt; &gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;skewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;women&#39;s mental and emotional states less jokes and more recognized for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;their uniqueness and treated as such, but health issues that were largely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;ignored or mistreated (Pregnancy-Birth issues, Breast Cancer, PMS,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Menopause, etc) are now getting the attention and respect that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;deserve.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s all I can come up with at this late hour, off the top of my head,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;with sick kids to worry about.  Yes, every social reformatting gives us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;pros and cons.  But we also LEARN.  We learn what was bad about the old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;ways, and what we liked, what was BETTER.  Then we have the information,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;the ability and the FREEDOM to choose how to combine the old and the new<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;into a satisfying whole.  Each new change brings learning, and may it<br/>
&gt; &gt;never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;stop!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I hope this attack of feminism stops soon.  I think there are problmes in<br/>
 this country and even with some people who call themselves feminist but I<br/>
 strongly belive they stem from the corpoate culture that has invadewd this<br/>
 country.  Its all about profits dontcha know. &gt;&gt;<br/>

loud, we don&#39;t hire women, period.<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time with my 77 year old aunt a few weeks ago.  I love for her<br/>
to tell me the stories of her life.  She was an unmarried 20 something with<br/>
a mind of her own.  She decided she wanted to buy 4 lots over near her<br/>
parents house, so she could build her   own house and build one to sell.  My<br/>
grandfather was a carpenter and he had agreed to  help build the houses. She<br/>
went to the bank with the down payment saved. She asked for a loan for the<br/>
rest of the property.  She even took my grandfather with her.  She called<br/>
him by name, they knew one another, but the answer still was, &quot;we don&#39;t lend<br/>
money to unmarried women.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, my aunt got up,  made a deal with the folks who owned the land and two<br/>
years later came back for a loan to build another house.  This time she was<br/>
engaged and that sufficed.  She was engaged to a man who could neither read<br/>
nor write well.  Her retirement is the investment from the proceeds of the<br/>
sale of those homes.<br/>
<br/>
I turn 40 this year and my life has not been too hampered by the male only<br/>
club that used to run every occupation, more or less, but to say that the<br/>
feminist movement has done nothing for me, is very short sighted.  When you<br/>
look back you must look back at least 100-150 years, then look for patterns<br/>
of change.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I hope this attack of feminism stops soon.  I think there are problmes in<br/>
 this country and even with some people who call themselves feminist but I<br/>
 strongly belive they stem from the corpoate culture that has invadewd this<br/>
 country.  Its all about profits dontcha know.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

     I totally agree.  I hardly post anymore because of busy things going on <br/>
in our lives but this issue got my attention.  I think people need to <br/>
separate feminism, the issue of women having the same rights as men, from <br/>
other issues.  Our culture has become more materialistic and work oriented <br/>
and that has had disastrous effects.  It is sad that kids are virtually <br/>
raising themselves in many homes, including the affluent ones.  But I think <br/>
we need to blame our own increased desire for MORE along with (and <br/>
especially) the corporate world.  <br/>
     I read a book a couple of years ago called &quot;History of Women in <br/>
America,&quot; that really brought home to me the importance of what feminists in <br/>
this country accomplished.  Would any of us really want to go back to a time <br/>
when women couldn&#39;t vote, domestic abuse and marital rape weren&#39;t crimes, <br/>
women couldn&#39;t go to college, women could only get low paying jobs and men <br/>
had the &quot;real&quot; jobs?  What about women who choose to not have children or <br/>
can&#39;t?  What about women who have kids in their 20s and have very different <br/>
lives in their 40s? Isn&#39;t it a good thing that they can live more as they <br/>
choose, including being able to work for pay at something that challenges <br/>
them and pays them well?<br/>

a loan without your husband having to OK it?  Maybe you were allowed or even <br/>
encouraged to become educated?  Etc.  Maybe you are the beneficiary of the <br/>
attitude of acceptance of women&#39;s abilities and recognition of women&#39;s rights <br/>
that are among the goals of the feminist movement?    <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;O.K., this is an serious, honest question and not an attempt to<br/>
&gt; &gt;start<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;war.  I would really like to hear exactly what it is folks think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism &gt;has gotten for us.  Rowe vs. Wade was not the result of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;we don&#39;t &gt;have equal pay for equal work, so exactly what have we<br/>
&gt; &gt;gained?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Lynda, who will now jump into her flame proof suit %-}<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmmm...Interesting question Lynda.  Now I have to think right?  OY!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;After<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the week I have had I don&#39;t know if I am functional enough to use<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;brainpower, and now both my kids are sick and I am taking turns<br/>
&gt; &gt;running<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;between rooms to administer medicine, adjust the steamers, kiss<br/>
&gt; &gt;sweaty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;little brows and soothe fussy, achey bodies.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;What did feminism get us?  Nothing can be completely attributed to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;particular<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;times for each thing.  However, I think I can name a few things that<br/>
&gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;think feminism had a definate impact and motivating affect upon.  For<br/>
&gt; &gt;one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;thing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;professions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters)<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;friends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;career of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL<br/>
&gt; &gt;benefit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;having that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in<br/>
&gt; &gt;important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;fields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;domestic<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to<br/>
&gt; &gt;women<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices<br/>
&gt; &gt;more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;available because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine<br/>
&gt; &gt;religions.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;While religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big<br/>
&gt; &gt;boost<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;due to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism<br/>
&gt; &gt;movement<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;and the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;access these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is<br/>
&gt; &gt;not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;much totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;duality, the balance.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves<br/>
&gt; &gt;through<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;skewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only<br/>
&gt; &gt;are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;women&#39;s mental and emotional states less jokes and more recognized<br/>
&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;their uniqueness and treated as such, but health issues that were<br/>
&gt; &gt;largely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ignored or mistreated (Pregnancy-Birth issues, Breast Cancer, PMS,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Menopause, etc) are now getting the attention and respect that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;deserve.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That&#39;s all I can come up with at this late hour, off the top of my<br/>
&gt; &gt;head,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;with sick kids to worry about.  Yes, every social reformatting gives<br/>
&gt; &gt;us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;pros and cons.  But we also LEARN.  We learn what was bad about the<br/>
&gt; &gt;old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;ways, and what we liked, what was BETTER.  Then we have the<br/>
&gt; &gt;information,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;the ability and the FREEDOM to choose how to combine the old and the<br/>
&gt; &gt;new<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;into a satisfying whole.  Each new change brings learning, and may it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;never<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;stop!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19665476">Actually it was my father that encouraged me to do anything I wanted career <br/>
and lifewise and be whatever I want to be.  He told me that no one could stop <br/>
me as long a I believed in what I was doing.  The aunt story is a great <br/>
example... So they wouldn&#39;t give her the money, she found a way round it... <br/>
What a resourceful woman.  She still got what she wanted and there&#39;s a great <br/>
story to pass on to other women about persisting in following your dreams.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it&#39;s different in other countries.  Not having grown up in the <br/>
bubble of America and having lived in several other countries in Europe and <br/>
Asia it&#39;s interesting to see how other lifestyles work.  I&#39;ve now been in <br/>
American for 15 years (yes I turn 41 this year) and this country is actually <br/>
quite backwards in a lot of ways.<br/>

 I turn 40 this year and my life has not been too hampered by the male only<br/>
 club that used to run every occupation, more or less, but to say that the<br/>
 feminist movement has done nothing for me, is very short sighted.  When you<br/>
 look back you must look back at least 100-150 years, then look for patterns<br/>
 of change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804713330">As the adult survivor of abuse,sexual,physical and emotional at the nads<br/>
of my bio dad,also my dads dad molested me,I was raped by a male psych<br/>
at age 21.I have to thank Feminism for giving me my voice back.I had<br/>
lost it as a young girl(age 12)I also learned that for once my needs<br/>
mattered.Over the years I have learned that my needs are important.I<br/>
have had to unlearn all the crappy wrong messages I learned growing up.<br/>
My father was a misoganist,hated women,still does.It took me 30 year to<br/>
realize being a woman was not a bad thing.Over the past 3 years I am<br/>
enjoying for the first time in my life truly being a woman.<br/>
I have never let me being female stop me from doing what I want.I also<br/>
love  being treated special by my husband.I also will speak out if some<br/>
other male is acting like an idiot to me.<br/>
I have raised 4 males which really has made me grow and changed my view<br/>
on men in general.For years due to my background I hated men.When I met<br/>
my present husband 15 years ago,I couldn&#39;t deal with the fact he was so<br/>
nice,good and kind to me.He has taught me not all men are jerks,and I<br/>
have strived to raise my sons as loving,sensitive ,males.They all do<br/>
laundry,cook,clean,and help whenever I need it.<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be a man,I love being a women,I love the way my husband<br/>
with his maleness completes my very essence.....Now there have been<br/>
times when i have had to set hubby straight!The great thing is,he<br/>
listens,he may get pissed off at first and close me out,but than he<br/>
thinks about it.<br/>
sOrry for the ramble,just had to get some thoughts out ....Deb :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912883014">O.K., I guess I was asking more about the feminist movement as projected by<br/>
frothing at the mouth radicals.  These are the folks who have campaigned<br/>
long and hard to make being a SAHM something to be ashamed of.  These are<br/>
the folks that seem to think the &quot;uniform&quot; is grung.  These are the folks<br/>
that think being a gentleman and being polite are a threat.<br/>
<br/>
I come from a long line of fiercely independent, uppity females.  My<br/>
grandmother owned a motorcycle when she was young (b. 1888), the first<br/>
woman to do so in NY and possibly the U.S.  My step-dad&#39;s mother (b.1906)<br/>
was divorced and wearing pants in the 30&#39;s.  My mother owned a motorcycle<br/>
and was free diving in the late 40&#39;s and early 50&#39;s.  My other grandmother<br/>
(b. 1892) hoped a train with some girlfriends and came out to San Francisco<br/>
to find a husband and radical that she was, married an Indian.  BUT, none<br/>
of them felt that to prove their independence they had to forsake their<br/>
femininity or give up personally raising their children.  They made some<br/>
radical choices but never made their choices at the expense of others.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;O.K., this is an serious, honest question and not an attempt to start<br/>
 </span></blockquote>any &gt;war.  I would really like to hear exactly what it is folks think <br/>
feminism &gt;has gotten for us.  Rowe vs. Wade was not the result of feminism,<br/>
we don&#39;t &gt;have equal pay for equal work, so exactly what have we gained?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Lynda, who will now jump into her flame proof suit %-}<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmmmm...Interesting question Lynda.  Now I have to think right?  OY! <br/>
 </span></blockquote>After the week I have had I don&#39;t know if I am functional enough to use<br/>
brainpower, and now both my kids are sick and I am taking turns running<br/>
between rooms to administer medicine, adjust the steamers, kiss sweaty<br/>
little brows and soothe fussy, achey bodies.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; What did feminism get us?  Nothing can be completely attributed to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feminism, I think, but more a kaliedescope of factors of the particular<br/>
times for each thing.  However, I think I can name a few things that I<br/>
think feminism had a definate impact and motivating affect upon.  For one<br/>
thing it got more women in the door of traditionally &quot;masculine&quot;<br/>
professions.  I have family members (like my aforementioned sisters) and<br/>
friends who have benefitted greatly from this by being able to persue the<br/>
career of their choice and talents.  Not to mention how we ALL benefit for<br/>
having that extra resource of creativity and intelligence in important<br/>
fields like science, art, engineering, etc.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; For another thing, it made us more aware and able to help women in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>domestic violence situations, who were before shamed into silence.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; For a third, and this is a biggee for me, it gave more freedom to women<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in religious matters, in particular made Goddess worship and practices more<br/>
available because it celebrated women, unlike most masculine religions. <br/>
While religions with a central Goddess figure may have gotten a big boost<br/>
due to the fact that they fit into the PR effort of the feminism movement<br/>
and the idea to glorify what women were, I benefitted from freedom to<br/>
access these traditions, learn and worship how I saw fit.  Which is not so<br/>
much totally Goddess centered as it is God and Goddess centered, the<br/>
duality, the balance.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Hmmm...what else.....It gave us more freedom to express ourselves through<br/>
 </span></blockquote>dress rather than being so strictly tied to the madates of fashion and it&#39;s<br/>
skewed morality as in ages past.  (Women, in pants!!  GASP!)  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And how about more awareness about womens issues in health?  Not only are<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131467590">Well, you aren&#39;t the only one &lt;g&gt;  I spent a lot of time with my<br/>
grandfather (b. 1866) whose mother was born in 1837.  He taught me to use a<br/>
saw, pound a nail and aim at and get whatever my heart desired.  He wanted<br/>
me to be like his mother!  Grampa Charlie (b. 1902) taught me to fly fish. <br/>
Grampa Harry (b. 1905) told me that being a girl was better than being a<br/>
boy.  Grampa Harry (b. 1894) taught me that should be proud of my heritage<br/>
and not take any &quot;you know what&quot; from anyone. My dad (b. 1926) taught me<br/>
how to work on motorcycles and cars and told me I could do anything my<br/>
heart desired.  First hubby thought nothing of me training the horses or<br/>
taking off with the kidlets and putting 35,000 miles a year on my truck<br/>
hitting the show circuit.  I&#39;ve managed stores, run a ranch and worked at<br/>
any job I pleased.  I was usually paid more than the men that had held the<br/>
jobs prior to my getting hired--why?  because I did a better job! <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the Feminist Movement of the 60&#39;s had any effect on those who<br/>
formed my views of what I could be or do.  Nor did it help me get any of<br/>
the jobs I held. <br/>
<br/>
So, Dawn, guess we were both born into the right families &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Lynda,<br/>
<br/>
There is a bit of a discussion in the &quot;letters to the editor&quot; page of <br/>
our local paper, seems a reporter used the term &quot;Indian&quot; when <br/>
referring to a &quot;Native American&quot; and some white woman who has <br/>
three adopted children that are &quot;Native Americans&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>
In your email you used the term &quot;Indian&quot; referring to your <br/>
Grandfather, who I believe is a Native American?   Do any Indians <br/>
you know take offence at that term being used?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I especially like these two sentences.  I think that is the difference<br/>
between feminism as an equality measure, and feminism as a radical hate<br/>
movement.  Some of the more rabid feminists have gone beyond equality to<br/>
superiority.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562722257">I&#39;ve started the book and we (hubby, kidlets and I) at first decided to<br/>
call it &quot;The Names Have Been Changed To Protect The Guilty.&quot; &lt;g&gt;  After<br/>
sitting down to do some more writing, I decided (with due input from my<br/>
homegrown critics &lt;g&gt;) that it had better be two books, the above named<br/>
book for all the &quot;Billy Beer&quot; type skeletons in the family closet and the<br/>
mil from h*ll and then one about the grandparents and the two great<br/>
grandmothers who survived a massacre.  We couldn&#39;t decide which book to put<br/>
1st hubby&#39;s grandmother in--she came out in a covered wagon and called<br/>
herself a Missouri mule AND was married 5 times and when she died she still<br/>
had one of the two bullets in her that her 3rd husband put in her before he<br/>
jumped on a train and disappeared.  Or maybe I should write for the soaps<br/>
cause I&#39;m not thinking most folks are going to believe some of the antics<br/>
the ancestors got up to except maybe on one of those &quot;Strangers Than<br/>
Fiction&quot; shows!<br/>
