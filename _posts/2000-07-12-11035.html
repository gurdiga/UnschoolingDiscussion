&gt; Home educators win in Berkeley<br/>
&gt; Alameda DA drops truancy case against Bay Area families<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               By Julie Foster<br/>
&gt;               Â© 2000 WorldNetDaily.com<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               The Alameda County District Attorney&#39;s<br/>
&gt;               office has decided not to pursue criminal<br/>
&gt;               truancy charges against four<br/>
&gt;               home-schooling families, thanks in part to<br/>
&gt;               a series of reports by WorldNetDaily, says<br/>
&gt;               the families&#39; lawyer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               The families, who have become known in<br/>
&gt;               home-school circles as the &quot;Berkeley<br/>
&gt;               Four,&quot; were preparing for a possible trial<br/>
&gt;               instigated by the Berkeley Unified School<br/>
&gt;               District&#39;s student attendance review<br/>
&gt;               board.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               The review board interrogated the families<br/>
&gt;               in a May hearing after a confidential<br/>
&gt;               complaint was filed against the home<br/>
&gt;               schoolers. During the hearing, the board<br/>
&gt;               asked the home-educating parents to<br/>
&gt;               submit evidence of their children&#39;s school<br/>
&gt;               attendance. The board later modified the<br/>
&gt;               request to require information on the<br/>
&gt;               families&#39; curricula as well, refusing to<br/>
&gt;               extend a May 31 deadline.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               Believing the review board&#39;s actions to be<br/>
&gt;               a violation of their rights, the families<br/>
&gt;               declined to submit the material. One week<br/>
&gt;               after the deadline, the board informed the<br/>
&gt;               families that their case had been sent to<br/>
&gt;               the district attorney&#39;s office for criminal<br/>
&gt;               investigation.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               The investigation is now completed, and<br/>
&gt;               no charges will be filed against the<br/>
&gt;               families.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               Three of the &quot;Berkeley Four&quot; are<br/>
&gt;               represented by attorney Will Rogers, who<br/>
&gt;               credits WorldNetDaily&#39;s reports as a<br/>
&gt;               contributing factor to the families&#39; success.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               &quot;The DA was very reasonable,&quot; Rogers<br/>
&gt;               said. &quot;He could&#39;ve taken a very hard-line<br/>
&gt;               approach, but he was very reasonable,<br/>
&gt;               straightforward and candid. He was not<br/>
&gt;               going to be told what to do by the school<br/>
&gt;               board. He wasn&#39;t just going to follow their<br/>
&gt;               line. He looked at it independently.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               Rogers said he discussed the case with<br/>
&gt;               Assistant District Attorney John Adams on<br/>
&gt;               Monday. If the DA were to press charges,<br/>
&gt;               Rogers said he would have filed a demur,<br/>
&gt;               objecting to the statute under which his<br/>
&gt;               clients were being scrutinized.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               &quot;We discussed what a trial would look like<br/>
&gt;               and the legal maneuvers that I would<br/>
&gt;               make,&quot; Rogers told WND. &quot;If they were to<br/>
&gt;               file charges, I would file a demur, which<br/>
&gt;               says that the statute that the defendants<br/>
&gt;               are being charged under does not give<br/>
&gt;               sufficient notice to a person regarding<br/>
&gt;               what they&#39;ve done to commit some kind of<br/>
&gt;               offense. The statute here is vague, and he<br/>
&gt;               (Adams) agreed.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               Even if the demur, or objection, were to<br/>
&gt;               fail, Rogers said the district attorney&#39;s<br/>
&gt;               office was facing the legal standard of<br/>
&gt;               &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; when<br/>
&gt;               proving truancy -- a standard that would<br/>
&gt;               be very difficult to meet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               Adams told WND the case was very<br/>
&gt;               simple.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               &quot;There is documentation that I now have<br/>
&gt;               that says these kids are in school,&quot; he<br/>
&gt;               remarked. &quot;That pretty much settles it.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               Two of the families are enrolled in an<br/>
&gt;               independent study program through a<br/>
&gt;               private school. Rogers was prepared to<br/>
&gt;               get testimony from the principal of that<br/>
&gt;               school, showing the children had no<br/>
&gt;               attendance problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               &quot;The only alternative was to put all of<br/>
&gt;               home-schooling on trial, and Mr. Adams<br/>
&gt;               was not willing to do that,&quot; Rogers<br/>
&gt;               continued. &quot;He analogized it to abortion<br/>
&gt;               where both sides have very strong<br/>
&gt;               opinions. The inference is that this is a<br/>
&gt;               political, rather than a legal matter and<br/>
&gt;               needs to be resolved through political<br/>
&gt;               channels, rather than through the criminal<br/>
&gt;               courts.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               Rogers said the case is a victory for his<br/>
&gt;               clients and other home-schooling families.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               &quot;This is a victory, not only for the four<br/>
&gt;               Berkeley families, but for home schoolers<br/>
&gt;               throughout Alameda County and<br/>
&gt;               throughout California,&quot; he said.<br/>
&gt;               &quot;[Home-schooling families] can go to sleep<br/>
&gt;               a little bit easier at night without the<br/>
&gt;               worry that they will be facing imminent<br/>
&gt;               prosecution for something they believe in<br/>
&gt;               their hearts is the best for their children.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               The attorney has not heard from the<br/>
&gt;               review board since it referred the families&#39;<br/>
&gt;               cases to law enforcement in early June. He<br/>
&gt;               added that he doesn&#39;t expect to hear back<br/>
&gt;               from the board, because the DA&#39;s actions<br/>
&gt;               &quot;took the wind out of their sails.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               According to California Education Code<br/>
&gt;               Section 48291, &quot;the official making the<br/>
&gt;               determination not to prosecute shall<br/>
&gt;               provide the school attendance review<br/>
&gt;               board with a written explanation for the<br/>
&gt;               decision not to prosecute.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;               &quot;We are eagerly awaiting [Adams&#39;s] report<br/>
&gt;               to Berkeley Unified School District officials<br/>
&gt;               and hope that it will be useful in helping<br/>
&gt;               other home schoolers,&quot; said Cathy<br/>
&gt;               Cuthbert of the California Homeschool<br/>
&gt;               Network. &quot;There are several families<br/>
&gt;               around California currently in the same<br/>
&gt;               predicament that these Berkeley families<br/>
&gt;               were. I hope this news gives them the<br/>
&gt;               courage to continue to stand up for their<br/>
&gt;               educational liberties.&quot;<br/>
