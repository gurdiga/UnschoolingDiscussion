<div id="ygrps-yiv-1491986613">It depends on what the law in New Mexico says.  In Ohio, legally, your<br/>
kids would be considered truant.  You run the risk of being arrested and<br/>
losing your kids if you choose not to notify.  Now if some brave soul<br/>
wants to take the risk and challenge that law (and take on CPS too), I&#39;d<br/>
be behind them 100% BUT it ain&#39;t gonna be me.  My son has way too many<br/>
problems for me to allow him to be put in foster care or in public school<br/>
for any amount of time no matter how short and that&#39;s where he would be<br/>
while the case wound it&#39;s way through the legal system.  Now, if it were<br/>
just my daughters in question, I&#39;d probably discuss it with them and if<br/>
they agreed and understood the risks, I&#39;d probably do it.  I&#39;d love to<br/>
put my oldest back in high school just to watch the fallout but she<br/>
doesn&#39;t wanna go.  <br/>

&gt; I&#39;m literally not part of the system in New Mexico.  Not even of the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; register-with-the-state system.  So my kids are just ditching <br/>
&gt; school?  <br/>
&gt; Kirby&#39;s been truant since 3rd grade? (The last year I registered <br/>
&gt; anyone was <br/>
&gt; Kirby in 3rd, Marty kindergarten; after that I forgot about it.)<br/>

Here we run the risk of a $25 fine.<br/>

I seriously doubt anyone would be arrested anywhere--they&#39;d just be ordered <br/>
by the court to fill out the registration form.  If you issued your kids <br/>
rifles and told the judge to get screwed, THEN you&#39;d be arrested, but that&#39;s <br/>
past the issue of whether or not to register.<br/>
