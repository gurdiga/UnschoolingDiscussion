We live in a society that is rapidly becoming a nation of sociopaths. The <br/>
root cause of this is not the loss of family values. Neither is it the <br/>
consequence of parents who are in themselves sociopaths or emotionally <br/>
disturbed individuals. The cause, instead, is the conventional, but <br/>
abnormal, ways in which we rear our children. From the moment of birth, <br/>
children are deprived of that which humans evolved to have Â– the prolonged <br/>
nurturing natural to our species.</div>

<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am pulling for your success in quitting &quot;the&quot; 
habit!&nbsp; I&#39;ve never smoked but my hubby did.......he had quit one time for 
18 months then went back to it after being out-to-sea for a couple months (we 
are recently retired Navy) and then quit again before coming home and hasn&#39;t 
smoked for 18 months!&nbsp; He was one of those chain smokers too and a very 
nervous guy to boot so if he can quit......... you can!&nbsp; Let&#39;s us know how 
you are doing - we are all here for you!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92491260">No quitting stories, just a reminder to do it for your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I found out my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer.  &quot;Just a spot,&quot;<br/>
says Mom, but still, I&#39;m worried.  The man has been smoking unfiltered Pall<br/>
Malls for 40 years!  He has chronic emphasyma. And yet he continues to<br/>
smoke.<br/>
<br/>
He promises to quit this time.  Two weeks before the operation.  We&#39;ll see<br/>
how long it lasts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 3500 miles away and can&#39;t help out.<br/>
<br/>
So, remember, one day your kids could be hearing &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;cancer&quot; in the<br/>
same breath.  (No pun intended.)  Quit for them, too.  Plus, they&#39;re much<br/>
less likely to smoke if you don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009163692">Tamie, look at your kids when something makes you want to reach for that<br/>
coffin nail again.  You see, I buried my mother last year because she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t listen to the doctors soon enough.  She went to different doctors<br/>
and if she didn&#39;t like the answer she went looking for another one.  The<br/>
part that angers me the most, other than the loss my children experienced<br/>
when their &quot;Granny&quot; wasn&#39;t there anymore, was that when she finally decided<br/>
to quit she never picked another one up.<br/>
<br/>
Now, what she said when she quit was that she felt that most of the problem<br/>
with cigerettes is that she felt brainwashed by the cigerette companies and<br/>
everyone else that it would be toooooo hard to quit, everyone fails, blah,<br/>
blah, blah.  She thought that was more propaganda from the cigerette<br/>
companies because if you think it is hard or that you can&#39;t, then you will<br/>
fail and they will have that income back again.<br/>
<br/>
She also said that part of the problem is simply the learned habit of hand<br/>
to mouth with the cigerette.  She told my cousin to find something to do<br/>
with her hands instead of the reflex of cigerette to mouth.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, I can send you the list of garbage that is cigerettes that we<br/>
put into a poster form at the hospital where I use to work.  I know I<br/>
printed them out and some of the staff took them home and each time they<br/>
got an urge they reread the list and said it helped.<br/>

I will be sending our prayers your way!  My mom smoked from 25 years old and <br/>
quit when she was about 68 years old (she quit because my son and I had to <br/>
come live with them when my husband abandoned us, and my son kept getting <br/>
sick from the smoke).  I know that if she can do it, anyone can.  She will be <br/>
the first to admit that she has a hard time overcoming habits.  <br/>
<br/>

You can email me privately if you like.  I quit smoking over 6 years ago <br/>
(yeah!!!) and can&#39;t believe that I had ever smoked.  Actually, it&#39;s kind of <br/>
funny because I was so tired today and I saw a cigarette butt on the ground <br/>
and thought &quot;Gee, how crappy would I feel if I was still smoking?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was the hardest thing I have ever done, but I promised my husband that <br/>
when I got pregnant, I would quit.  I always keep my promises, so.... (I <br/>
guess I should now promise him that I will lose 30 lbs LOL)  I still <br/>
sometimes dream about smoking and wake up thinking that I started again, <br/>
that&#39;s how much of a hold it gets on you.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you and I&#39;ll be right there with you.  It&#39;s worth it.<br/>

sad.&nbsp; He had pictures on his cubicle at work of his kids and

very much.&nbsp; And I am sure you have a lot of people who love you very much
