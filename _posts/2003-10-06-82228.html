<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093039681">This is true and really important imo (hi Liza, good to run into you <br/>
here!)  -  <br/>
<br/>
      Not only are children real people, but their WORLD is real, right now, <br/>
today, not at some far-distant and unspecified point in the future when they <br/>
have been properly conditioned and publicly licensed to venture out into it.<br/>
<br/>
       So maybe we should speak of the schooling/unschooling contrast in <br/>
different terms, to make this more plain. It&#39;s more like the contrast between <br/>
artificial/real learning experiences, or perhaps manipulated/authentic learning?  <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; In our society we tell kids that they are not whole yet. Our whole<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; culture of parenting is based on tomorrow. We tell our kids that they<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really persons but the potential of a person. That once they<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;get educated&quot;, &quot;turn 21&quot;, &quot;finish college&quot;, &quot;get the great<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; jobs/car/spouse/house/kids&quot;, then they are real people.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; What about now?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Aren&#39;t they complete now? Aren&#39;t they real people now?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Roya went to school until 4th grade - she&#39;s now almost 19.<br/>
They did &quot;authentic assessment&quot;  - no tests or grades - just teacher <br/>
observing what the kid shows she knows as she does projects like makes <br/>
board games, creates skits, does computer demonstrations, writes about <br/>
something, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I was very far from knowing anything about unschooling in those days, <br/>
but I do remember, once, saying to her teacher - &quot;Kind of weird to <br/>
&#39;authentically&#39; assess what is not authentically learned.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This was because my daughter had been assigned to learn about the <br/>
kangaroo rat. All California 4th graders learn about California. So the <br/>
class had been divided into groups - the desert, ocean, mountains, and <br/>
valleys groups. She was in the desert group. Then, within the group <br/>
they each got assigned an animal to learn about. She got the kangaroo <br/>
rat. At the time, she was horse-crazy. She also was crazy about <br/>
dolphins and whales and other creatures of the sea. She was NOT <br/>
interested in kangaroo rats.<br/>
<br/>
So - poor kid - was spending her school and homework time reading and <br/>
doing projects based on the kangaroo rat and, in her spare time, was <br/>
happily - and in her own way - learning everything possible about <br/>
horses and dolphins.<br/>
<br/>
The so-called &quot;authentic assessment&quot; only involved observing how much <br/>
she&#39;d learned about kangaroo rats and the Mojave Desert.<br/>
<br/>
Authentically assessing manipulated/forced learning?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-37217594">Yup. Fourth Grade is the grade for learning about your home state. <br/>
When Abbie was fourth grade age, even with a &quot;compile your own <br/>
curriculum&quot; group we were involved with, we got a workbook about a <br/>
study on Idaho.<br/>
<br/>
Never did anything about it, though. At that age, Abbie was learning <br/>
everything she could about sharks, hobbits, elves, and wizards. <br/>
<br/>
Why is fourth grade THE grade for that, anyway? sheesh. I mean, who <br/>
decided that 10 is the age for state history and 14 the age for <br/>
civics and  and   and<br/>
<br/>
argh<br/>
