-------<br/>
Mastery is not something that strikes in an instant, like a thunderbolt, <br/>
but a gathering power that moves steadily through time, like weather. <br/>
~ John W. Gardner~<br/>
-------<br/>
&quot;If we represent knowledge as a tree, we know that things that are<br/>
divided are yet connected.  We know that to observe the divisions and<br/>
ignore the connections is to destroy the tree.&quot;<br/>
~Wendell Berry~<br/>
-------<br/>
Man&#39;s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original<br/>
dimensions.<br/>
~ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.~ <br/>
-------<br/>
Seeing is different than being told.<br/>
~  Proverb from Kenya~<br/>
--------<br/>
Education is a private matter between the person and the world of<br/>
knowledge and experience, and has little to do with school or college.  <br/>
~Lillian Smith~ <br/>
-------<br/>
Education is a social process ... Education is growth.... Education is,<br/>
not a preparation for life; education is life itself.  <br/>
~John Dewey ~<br/>
-------<br/>
It is among the commonplaces of education that we often first cut off the<br/>
living root and then try to replace its natural functions by artificial<br/>
means. Thus we suppress the child&#39;s curiosity and then when he lacks a<br/>
natural interest in learning he is offered special coaching for his<br/>
scholastic difficulties. <br/>
~Alice Duer Miller~<br/>

&quot;One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly<br/>
making exciting discoveries.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939584354">Joylyn,<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean school type subjects?  I have a bunch of those because I <br/>
was the director of a inner-city learning center.  Here are the ones <br/>
on writing but I have more on math and science if you&#39;d like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Start writing, no matter about what.  The water does not flow until <br/>
the faucet is turned on.  You can sit and look at a page for a long <br/>
time and nothing will happen.  Start writing and it will.&quot;<br/>
Louis L&#39;Amour 1908-1988<br/>
<br/>
&quot;After all, birds do naturally what poets dream of: they sing, they <br/>
mediate between land and sky, between the earthbound body and the <br/>
airborne soul.&quot;<br/>
Jonathan Rosen<br/>
<br/>
When I face the desolate impossibility of writing 500 pages, a sick <br/>
sense of failure falls on me, and I know I can never do it. Then <br/>
gradually, I write one page and then another. One day&#39;s works is all <br/>
I can permit myself to contemplate. <br/>
--John Steinbeck<br/>
<br/>
Omit needless words. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should <br/>
contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, <br/>
for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines <br/>
and a machine no unnecessary parts. <br/>
--William Strunk, Jr. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the readernot the <br/>
fact that it is raining, but the feeling of being rained upon.&quot;<br/>
E.L. Doctorow<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dreaming and hoping won&#39;t produce a piece of work; only writing, <br/>
rewriting and rewriting (if necessary)--a devoted translation of <br/>
thoughts and dreams into words on paper--will result in a story.&quot;<br/>
Roberta Gellis<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is no perfect time to write. There&#39;s only now.&quot;<br/>
Barbara Kingsolver<br/>
<br/>
&quot;That which we persist in doing becomes easier--not that the nature <br/>
of the task has changed, but our ability to do has increased.&quot;<br/>
Emerson<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A ratio of failures is built into the process of writing. The <br/>
wastebasket has evolved for a reason.&quot;<br/>
Margaret Atwood<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.&quot;<br/>
Robert Francis Kennedy<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to <br/>
deal with, but whether it&#39;s the same problem you had last year.&quot;<br/>
John Foster Dulles<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated <br/>
simple, awesomely simple, that&#39;s creativity.&quot;<br/>
Charles Mingus<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Writing is rewriting. A writer must learn to deepen characters, trim <br/>
writing, intensify scenes. To fall in love with a first draft to the <br/>
point where one cannot change it is to greatly enhance the prospects <br/>
of never publishing.&quot;<br/>
Richard North Patterson<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Books aren&#39;t written--they&#39;re rewritten. Including your own. It is <br/>
one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh <br/>
rewrite hasn&#39;t quite done it.&quot;<br/>
Michael Crichton<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is no great writing, only great rewriting.&quot;<br/>
Justice Brandeis<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is a difference between a book of two hundred pages from the <br/>
very beginning, and a book of two hundred pages which is the result <br/>
of an original eight hundred pages. The six hundred are there. Only <br/>
you don&#39;t see them.&quot;<br/>
Elie Wiesel<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The beautiful part of writing is that you don&#39;t have to get it right <br/>
the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. You can always do it <br/>
better, find the exact word, the apt phrase, the leaping simile.&quot;<br/>
Robert Cormier<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to <br/>
please everyone.&quot;<br/>
Bill Cosby<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To avoid criticism do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.&quot;<br/>
Elbert Hubbard<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is <br/>
for other people.&quot;<br/>
Thomas Mann<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What no wife of a writer can ever understand is that a writer is <br/>
working when he&#39;s staring out the window.&quot;<br/>
Rudolph Erich Rascoe<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be anything you want to be, but don&#39;t be dull.&quot; ~Frank Robinson <br/>
<br/>
&quot;You can take for granted that people know more or less what a <br/>
street, a shop, a beach, a sky, an oak tree look like. Tell them what <br/>
makes this one different.&quot; ~Neil Gaiman<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Quantity produces quality. If you only write a few things, you&#39;re <br/>
doomed.&quot; ~Ray Bradbury <br/>
<br/>
&quot;A book worth reading only in childhood is not worth reading even <br/>
then.&quot; ~C.S. Lewis</div>

I already have this one: &quot; A creative mess is better than tidy idleness !<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s more that I like:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The simplest of joys and the greatest of fulfillment is learning to rest and <br/>
drink deeply and joyfully of the lives in our own home and the love that is <br/>
shared there. -unknown<br/>
<br/>
Wherever you go, go with all your heart.        ~Confucius                    <br/>
       <br/>
<br/>
                                               <br/>
 Live in each season as it passes; breathe the air, drink the drink, taste <br/>
the fruit, and resign yourself to the influences of each.  <br/>
         ~Henry David Thoreau                                                 <br/>
                                                                              <br/>
                                                                              <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 Rest is not idleness, and to lie sometimes on the grass on a summer day <br/>
listening to the murmur of water, or watching the clouds float across the sky, is <br/>
hardly a waste of time. - Sir John Lubboc<br/>
<br/>
&quot;May no gift be too small to give, nor too simple to receive, which is <br/>
wrapped in thoughtfulness, and tied with love.&quot;  <br/>
                                 - L. O. Baird<br/>
<br/>
Be like the bird that, passing on her flight awhile on boughs too slight, <br/>
feels them give way beneath her, and yet sings, knowing that she hath wings.      <br/>
   ~Victor Hugo<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Adopt the pace of nature: her secret is patience.  ~Ralph Waldo Emerson<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tenderness and kindness are not signs of weakness and despair, <br/>
but manifestations of strength and resolutions.               - Kahlil Gibran<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If one dream should fall and break into a thousand pieces, never be afraid to <br/>
pick one of those pieces up and begin again.  ~Flavia Weedn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have spread my dreams beneath your feet;<br/>
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams...              <br/>
                             William Butler Yeats<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Dost thou love life? Then do not squander time, for that&#39;s the stuff life <br/>
is made of.&quot;                                  <br/>
<br/>
                                              -Benjamin Franklin <br/>
<br/>
&quot; Those who bring sunshine into the lives of others cannot keep it from <br/>
themselves.&quot;                        <br/>
-Barrie<br/>
<br/>
The important thing is not so much that every child should be taught, as that <br/>
every child should be given the wish to learn.  <br/>
                                        ~John Lubbock<br/>

                  - Samuel Johnson<br/>
<br/>
Gratitude unlocks the fullness of life.   It turns what we have<br/>
into enough, and more.  It turns denial into acceptance, chaos<br/>
to order, confusion to clarity.  It can turn a meal into a feast, <br/>
a house into a home, a stranger into a friend.  Gratitude makes <br/>
sense of our past, brings peace for today, <br/>
and creates a vision for tomorrow.<br/>
-   Melody Beattie <br/>
<br/>
Other things may change us, but we start and end with family.&quot;<br/>
                        ~Anthony Brandt<br/>
<br/>
( well, not unschoolers or homeschoolers &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;)<br/>
We are students of words: we are shut up in schools, and colleges, and <br/>
recitation-rooms, for ten or fifteen years, and come out at last with a bag of wind, <br/>
a memory of words, and do not know a thing.  <br/>
~Ralph Waldo Emerson <br/>
<br/>
Your example is much more powerful than anything you can ever say.<br/>
~ Elisabeth Elliot<br/>
<br/>
There is something infinitely healing in the repeated refrains of nature-<br/>
the assurance that dawn comes after night, and spring after winter.   ~Rachel <br/>
Carson<br/>
<br/>
I am a teacher.  A teacher is someone who leads.  There is no magic here. <br/>
I do not walk on water. I do not part the sea.  <br/>
I just love the children.<br/>

&quot;Birds fly, fish swim, man thinks and learns. <br/>
Therefore, we do not need to motivate children into<br/>
learning by wheedling, bribing or bullying.  We do not<br/>
need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure<br/>
they are learning.<br/>
<br/>
What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as<br/>
much of the world as we can into their lives.  Give<br/>
children as much help and guidance as they ask for;<br/>
listen respectfully when they feel like talking; and<br/>
then get out of the way.  We can trust them to do the<br/>
rest.&quot;<br/>

When I was the age Marty is now, nearly 15, I remember checking out from the <br/>
school libary two books in one day:  The Complete Works of Edgar Allen Poe, <br/>
and On Beyond Zebra, by Dr. Seuss.<br/>
<br/>
Several of my friends pointed and commented, and I said &quot;Well I&#39;m going to be <br/>
a teacher when I grow up, so I need to read children&#39;s books.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It passed as an excuse, and it was true, too!  But really, I just liked that <br/>
book and hadn&#39;t seen it for a while and wanted to read it again.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had been braver.  But I was brave enough to check it out and carry <br/>
it around, and most kids wouldn&#39;t have been, or maybe wouldn&#39;t have checked it <br/>
out because they didn&#39;t have to, nobody was making them.<br/>

&gt;   ***I am looking for a few good quotes.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   From the depths of my drafts folder...<br/>

&gt;   Deb L<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   -------<br/>
&gt;   Mastery is not something that strikes in an instant, like a <br/>
&gt; thunderbolt,<br/>
&gt;   but a gathering power that moves steadily through time, like weather.<br/>
&gt;   ~ John W. Gardner~<br/>
&gt;   -------<br/>
&gt;   &quot;If we represent knowledge as a tree, we know that things that are<br/>
&gt;   divided are yet connected.  We know that to observe the divisions and<br/>
&gt;   ignore the connections is to destroy the tree.&quot;<br/>
&gt;   ~Wendell Berry~<br/>
&gt;   -------<br/>
&gt;   Man&#39;s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original<br/>
&gt;   dimensions.<br/>
&gt;   ~ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.~<br/>
&gt;   -------<br/>
&gt;   Seeing is different than being told.<br/>
&gt;   ~  Proverb from Kenya~<br/>
&gt;   --------<br/>
&gt;   Education is a private matter between the person and the world of<br/>
&gt;   knowledge and experience, and has little to do with school or college. <br/>
&gt;   ~Lillian Smith~<br/>
&gt;   -------<br/>
&gt;   Education is a social process ... Education is growth.... Education is,<br/>
&gt;   not a preparation for life; education is life itself. <br/>
&gt;   ~John Dewey ~<br/>
&gt;   -------<br/>
&gt;   It is among the commonplaces of education that we often first cut <br/>
&gt; off the<br/>
&gt;   living root and then try to replace its natural functions by artificial<br/>
&gt;   means. Thus we suppress the child&#39;s curiosity and then when he lacks a<br/>
&gt;   natural interest in learning he is offered special coaching for his<br/>
&gt;   scholastic difficulties.<br/>
&gt;   ~Alice Duer Miller~<br/>
&gt;   -------<br/>
&gt;   &quot;One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly<br/>
&gt;   making exciting discoveries.&quot;<br/>
&gt;   ~ A.A. Milne~<br/>

&gt; I can permit myself to contemplate.<br/>
&gt; --John Steinbeck<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Omit needless words. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should<br/>
&gt; contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences,<br/>
&gt; for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines<br/>
&gt; and a machine no unnecessary parts.<br/>
&gt; --William Strunk, Jr.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Good writing is supposed to evoke sensation in the reader--not the<br/>
&gt; fact that it is raining, but the feeling of being rained upon.&quot;<br/>
&gt; E.L. Doctorow<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Dreaming and hoping won&#39;t produce a piece of work; only writing,<br/>
&gt; rewriting and rewriting (if necessary)--a devoted translation of<br/>
&gt; thoughts and dreams into words on paper--will result in a story.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Roberta Gellis<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;There is no perfect time to write. There&#39;s only now.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Barbara Kingsolver<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;That which we persist in doing becomes easier--not that the nature<br/>
&gt; of the task has changed, but our ability to do has increased.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Emerson<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;A ratio of failures is built into the process of writing. The<br/>
&gt; wastebasket has evolved for a reason.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Margaret Atwood<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Robert Francis Kennedy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to<br/>
&gt; deal with, but whether it&#39;s the same problem you had last year.&quot;<br/>
&gt; John Foster Dulles<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Making the simple complicated is commonplace; making the complicated<br/>
&gt; simple, awesomely simple, that&#39;s creativity.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Charles Mingus<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Writing is rewriting. A writer must learn to deepen characters, trim<br/>
&gt; writing, intensify scenes. To fall in love with a first draft to the<br/>
&gt; point where one cannot change it is to greatly enhance the prospects<br/>
&gt; of never publishing.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Richard North Patterson<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Books aren&#39;t written--they&#39;re rewritten. Including your own. It is<br/>
&gt; one of the hardest things to accept, especially after the seventh<br/>
&gt; rewrite hasn&#39;t quite done it.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Michael Crichton<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;There is no great writing, only great rewriting.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Justice Brandeis<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;There is a difference between a book of two hundred pages from the<br/>
&gt; very beginning, and a book of two hundred pages which is the result<br/>
&gt; of an original eight hundred pages. The six hundred are there. Only<br/>
&gt; you don&#39;t see them.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Elie Wiesel<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The beautiful part of writing is that you don&#39;t have to get it right<br/>
&gt; the first time, unlike, say, a brain surgeon. You can always do it<br/>
&gt; better, find the exact word, the apt phrase, the leaping simile.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Robert Cormier<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to<br/>
&gt; please everyone.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Bill Cosby<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;To avoid criticism do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Elbert Hubbard<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;A writer is someone for whom writing is more difficult than it is<br/>
&gt; for other people.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Thomas Mann<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;What no wife of a writer can ever understand is that a writer is<br/>
&gt; working when he&#39;s staring out the window.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Rudolph Erich Rascoe<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Be anything you want to be, but don&#39;t be dull.&quot; ~Frank Robinson<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;You can take for granted that people know more or less what a<br/>
&gt; street, a shop, a beach, a sky, an oak tree look like. Tell them what<br/>
&gt; makes this one different.&quot; ~Neil Gaiman<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Quantity produces quality. If you only write a few things, you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; doomed.&quot; ~Ray Bradbury<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;A book worth reading only in childhood is not worth reading even<br/>
&gt; then.&quot; ~C.S. Lewis<br/>

&gt; Mastery is not something that strikes in an instant, like a thunderbolt,<br/>
&gt; but a gathering power that moves steadily through time, like weather.<br/>
&gt; ~ John W. Gardner~<br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; &quot;If we represent knowledge as a tree, we know that things that are<br/>
&gt; divided are yet connected.  We know that to observe the divisions and<br/>
&gt; ignore the connections is to destroy the tree.&quot;<br/>
&gt; ~Wendell Berry~<br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; Man&#39;s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original<br/>
&gt; dimensions.<br/>
&gt; ~ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.~<br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; Seeing is different than being told.<br/>
&gt; ~  Proverb from Kenya~<br/>
&gt; --------<br/>
&gt; Education is a private matter between the person and the world of<br/>
&gt; knowledge and experience, and has little to do with school or college. <br/>
&gt; ~Lillian Smith~<br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; Education is a social process ... Education is growth.... Education is,<br/>
&gt; not a preparation for life; education is life itself. <br/>
&gt; ~John Dewey ~<br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; It is among the commonplaces of education that we often first cut off the<br/>
&gt; living root and then try to replace its natural functions by artificial<br/>
&gt; means. Thus we suppress the child&#39;s curiosity and then when he lacks a<br/>
&gt; natural interest in learning he is offered special coaching for his<br/>
&gt; scholastic difficulties.<br/>
&gt; ~Alice Duer Miller~<br/>
&gt; -------<br/>
&gt; &quot;One of the advantages of being disorderly is that one is constantly<br/>
&gt; making exciting discoveries.&quot;<br/>
