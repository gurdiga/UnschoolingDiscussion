&gt; group of parents and children.  On the other hand, the Internet and books<br/>
&gt; with lists of resources for homeschools seldom, if ever, mention using the<br/>
&gt; public library.  So, for my project, I thought I would see 1) what <br/>
&gt; resources<br/>
&gt; the public libraries provide; 2) who uses those resources and how often; <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; 3) what resources the parent/teacher and children need/want.  I suppose I<br/>
&gt; could ask the libraries, but I thought the real answers would/should come<br/>
&gt; from the homeschoolers themselves.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a regular. All the librarians know me and my boys by name (I doubt they&#39;d <br/>
recognize Ben, though). Whatever I need, they order. David Albert&#39;s book just <br/>
came in. It&#39;s usually a two week wait for orders. We have a remarkable <br/>
homeschooling section---and an ASTOUNDING UNschooling section! (Yep, all MY <br/>
doing! &lt;G&gt;) We&#39;ve ordered Mary Griffith&#39;s books, all of Grace Llewellyn&#39;s, <br/>
John Holt&#39;s (even an out-of-print one!), John Taylor Gatto&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
I doubt many libraries have the resources we have, but they COULD! Someone <br/>
just needs to ask.<br/>
