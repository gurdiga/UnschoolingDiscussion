<div id="ygrps-yiv-379983902"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: &quot;Lynda&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lurine@...">lurine@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; Once we started looking at things from the diet end of the spectrum and<br/>
&gt; about teaching the kidlets to be aware of what was happening with their<br/>
&gt; bodies, how they could be in control, what a weight was lifted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lynda, our experience has been very similar. We found that dairy and wheat<br/>
were big culprits here (our son has SID - that&#39;s sensory integration<br/>
dysfunction, for those not used to the acronym), and then when we removed<br/>
wheat and dairy from his diet it exposed a host of other food allergies we<br/>
had no idea were there. A couple of useless rounds with a pediatric<br/>
allergist later and we stumbled on to NAET (Nambudriped&#39;s Allergy<br/>
Elimination Technique). Since starting that, we&#39;ve begun eliminating our<br/>
son&#39;s food allergies completely and the most of the behavioral and sensory<br/>
issues just went away and we don&#39;t have to deal with the restrictive diets<br/>
anymore, very nice!<br/>

Could you tell us more about this?  I&#39;ve never heard of it.  I have a son who <br/>
probably has multiple allergies although we have to discern what they are. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332182094">Kimmee - It&#39;s based upon kinesiology - muscle testing - You know if you hold out your arm straight and then someone pushes it you can still hold it up.  But if you hold something which causes problems for you, the &quot;blockage&quot; will weaken you, and you will not be able to push to hold up your arm.  This is the kind of electrical imbalance that essential oils, Bach&#39;s flower essences and DNR&#39;s body soaks work on too, I believe.  For more info on NAET, look at these sites:  <br/>
