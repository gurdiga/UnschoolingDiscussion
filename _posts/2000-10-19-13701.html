&lt;&lt; I did happen to catch that new show that talked about extended nursing and <br/>
 the boob thing.  I watched the whole thing is complete disbelief and just <br/>
 wanted to scream at the mother, your baby is CRYING go pick him up and nurse <br/>
 him!!.  I think the kid was barely a year old.  What was really sad is the <br/>
 message it sent to a lot of woman who probably want to nurse longer but feel <br/>
 that it isn&#39;t &quot;right&quot; according to society and so decide to stop.  Yes, you <br/>
 are right - letter writing time!<br/>

show.  What is it about?  Do you know the name? Date and time?  So I can pass <br/>
it on to La Leche League and others.  I need some information about it before <br/>
I can do anything......ooooooh I know I will go to NBCI.com and look.  I <br/>
think someone mentioned it was on Mondays.  OOOOH, but I don&#39;t know if it was <br/>
