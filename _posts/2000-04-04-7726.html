Hi! I&#39;m new to unschooling but thought I would throw in my experience with my <br/>
son regarding math. My son Jordan (9 1/2) was not interested in <br/>
multiplication at all. He had been walking around with a calculator for days <br/>
then Saturday he walks in the house and says &quot;Mom, ask me these flash cards.&quot; <br/>
Guess what, they were division flash cards. And he got over 50% of them <br/>
right!! He was so thrilled. Can you believe it, he learned multiplication by <br/>
learning division? I had never heard of it. I guess it was easier to learn <br/>
both together. I don&#39;t know, but he now knows most of his multiplication and <br/>
division facts. They truly do learn in &quot;their own way.&quot; Good luck with <br/>
unschooling!<br/>
