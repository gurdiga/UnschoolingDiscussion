<div id="ygrps-yiv-575286197">This discussion is bringing up something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately. My mom was a &#39;praiser&#39;. She didn&#39;t say &#39;I&#39;m proud&#39;, but it was close. She still does this sometimes and she&#39;s 82 and I&#39;m 44. It drives me crazy and I think it is manipulative. Well, not now maybe but when I was a child it was the other side of critical control. I agree with Pam that it didn&#39;t help me know myself better. <br/>
With my kids, I am trying to avoid that and have used &#39;good job&#39; instead. But now, from listening to you guys, I realize that could be going down the same path so am trying to find other ways. One thing I&#39;ve used is &#39;I&#39;ll bet you&#39;re proud of yourself&#39;. Hmmm...now I&#39;ll have to rethink that one too. <br/>
On sort of the same tack,  I need to find new ways to respond to my kid&#39;s ideas. Yesterday in the car my 14dd said &#39;Meg and Sam and I might start a band&#39;. And I asked her some questions about it and said,&#39; well, how often would you guys need to meet&#39; (we live in the boonies and distance has been an issue). And she rolls her eyes and says &#39;mom, they don&#39;t even know how to play the guitar yet&#39;. <br/>
So I turned to her and said &#39;I do that all the time, don&#39;t I?&#39;<br/>
She said &#39;Well, yeah, a lot&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Guess I was way ahead of her and it became more my thing than hers.........sigh......I&#39;ve got to stop getting so excited when my kids take an interest in something. <br/>
Maybe that is close to getting praised for doing something &#39;approved of&#39;, like my mom did. <br/>
Does it betray a lack of confidence on my part that they will find passions? I think so. <br/>
Sorry to ramble and reflect this way. Anyone have similar experiences?<br/>

You know - what you said about yourself makes me think about my own dad <br/>
- that his praise of me did reflect a lack of confidence in me, like <br/>
what I&#39;d done wasn&#39;t enough - he had to add to it by saying it made him <br/>
proud of me. My mom&#39;s NOT feeling the need to praise a lot reflected <br/>
confidence. (Maybe not their reasons - but the underlying message it <br/>
gave me, at least.)<br/>
<br/>
How interesting!<br/>
