   It&#39;s not that bad!  I have two tattoos; a butterfly on one arm above the <br/>
wrist and Mickey Mouse on the other.  It doesn&#39;t hurt like a shot.  It&#39;s more <br/>
of a stinging and burning, but I thought it was mild.  Of course, if you opt <br/>
for doing it on a more tender part of your body, it might hurt more.  The <br/>
worst part for me was the healing process.  I have ***never*** experienced <br/>
such itching!  All you want to do it sit down and have a good scratch, but <br/>
you can&#39;t.  But I say go for it!<br/>
