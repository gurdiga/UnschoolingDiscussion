<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075955025">So the screens have been released and the sugar has been released. My husband and I have shared our knowledge about food with our children to prepare them/ to guide them, we are now trusting in them to take care of their beautiful body&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
Sugar was our biggest control so I went and bought enough candy for Halloween and put it in a bowl in the house and let the kids know it was there. They devoured the entire bowl in a day (4 children ages 11-4).  When we went to the store they asked for more, so I bought it.  I suggested to them that they might want to pace themselves.  They devoured it all again.  This has been going on for about two weeks. <br/>
<br/>
It is so hard to watch. My heart breaks as I realise I&#39;ve done this to them by limiting it. So my question is, has anyone else had this  experience before and if so how long did the gorging go on?  I believe that it will be like a pendulum and ultimately they will settle into a healthy pace but I&#39;m not sure how to support them as a mother, hence my second question. <br/>
<br/>
Where does the mothering line lay within unschooling?   They want bags and bags of candy. I bring it in (joyful).   We talk about being kind to ourselves and others in regards to the candy (not taking all of it so others miss out, giving your body a safe amount, teeth, not hoarding, etc).  I then trust them to handle it the way they think is best.  By the end of the day they have eaten all the candy I&#39;ve bought. They&#39;ve eaten it without consideration, some have hoarded it and one ate so much that he ended up sleeping in the middle of the day for three hours.  On one hand I believe they are learning through these experiences (family members upset and disappointed that the candy is gone) but as a mother it is hard to watch. I&#39;ve thought about each having their own bag but two of them end up taking from the others regardless. <br/>
<br/>
Where do I come in as a mother?  I don&#39;t want to be controlling about  how much comes in or how often.  I don&#39;t want to punish for stealing. I want it to be available to them but I can&#39;t keep up with their intake.  And what if the four year old is eating only candy for breakfast and lunch and no dinner? Shouldn&#39;t I be stepping in (neglect)?<br/>
<br/>
On a more hypothetical note, if they were drowning themselves in alcohol or drugs I would not want to be supplying it to them. <br/>
<br/>
I truly believe though that it&#39;s their life and body and their path and I can try and prepare them but they have to work it out for themselves or they will never be able to trust themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
Please help me find a light that will guide me in this newly released territory. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your time and effort.  I truly believe this group changes lives. <br/>

I wish this is what you had read first:<br/>

<br/>
Most of your post doesn’t sound like you really trust them, or us, or life, or learning.  <br/>
<br/>
This really doesn’t sound good:<br/>
&quot;the screens have been released and the sugar has been released”<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like “The hounds have been released and the demons have been released.”<br/>
<br/>
I hope others will come and give straighter answers to your questions. I want to back up to your assertion.  “Releasing controls,” done all of a sudden, will always result in frenzy.  I want to say some things about just the subject of your post and the first few phrases, and I’ll leave it alone for others to take a different angle with.<br/>
<br/>

It sounds a bit like you want to turn “control” over to your children.  &quot;we are now trusting in them to take care of their beautiful body’s.”<br/>
But you don’t trust them yet.  And you have ideas about what sugar will do, and what beautiful is, and you’ve told them what you believe/“know” about food.  It’s a test they can fail.<br/>
<br/>
If you can, read some things here that you didn’t read before, just randomly, perhaps. :-)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>
What’s done is done, but these ideas might help you come to a balance point.  <br/>
<br/>
Don’t leave your children to take care of themselves.  Create a solid relationship and a basecamp / nest.  BE there, be in the moment with them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
As to “releasing the screens…”  Yikes. <br/>
Please stop thinking of fifty things as all “screens.”<br/>

<br/>
You released sugar?  Had you jailed or enslaved it before?<br/>
I wish you could go back to gradually allowing more options, in a hundred sweet, generous instances.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t talk about sugar, or think about sugar.  Think about food, lots of interesting food, as food.  <br/>
<br/>
Your children don’t trust that you won’t go back to control.  Because of what you’ve written, I don’t either.  If you do, it will set you up for a bigger backlash the second time you “release” things.  It’s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
You’re still setting sugar aside from, apart from, above, other foods.  So partly, you should look more into the links and stories on my site about sugar.  Or look on Joyce’s if you’re tired of mine.  You could search several at once here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/search">http://sandradodd.com/search</a><br/>

It comes from approaching unschooling as a set of behaviors and interactions, as a kind of program to follow. &quot;Unschoolers do x,y, and z, therefore that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do because we want to unschool.&quot; I understood the philosophy of unschooling, could talk the talk, <i>well</i> before I understood how to walk the talk. And it prompted me to jump ahead of myself a few times which caused me nothing but doubts and anxiety.</font></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;They want bags and bags of candy. I bring it in (joyful).&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">Joyful...but with some inner tension? Your kids aren&#39;t relaxed about sugar not only because you&#39;ve never let them be, but because <i>you</i> are not genuinely relaxed about sugar, as is apparent from the way you have talked about it. :-) You have released the tension on it outwardly, but you haven&#39;t released the tension inwardly. And they know it, and so they don&#39;t trust your sudden about-face. Why should they? They can perceive you are judging the results and not happy with what you see. From their perspective, this whole bonanza could end just as abruptly as it started because mom isn&#39;t <i>truly</i> happy about it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve thought about each having their own bag but two of them end up taking from the others regardless.&gt;&gt;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div><font size="3">I would stop with the communal bowl as it seems to be adding to the strife and let them each choose their own bag, and then figure out a way to safeguard the candy of those who get theirs taken. If needed, I would be a kind of depository for those kids, so that they can relax about having their&nbsp;</font>candy<font size="3">&nbsp;available when they want it.&nbsp;</font><br><div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1092212127ecxygrp-mlmsg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-1092212127ecxygrp-msg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-1092212127ecxygrp-text">
<br>&lt;&lt;Where do I come in as a mother?  I don&#39;t want to be controlling about  how much comes in or how often.&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>Don&#39;t &quot;come in as a mother.&quot; It seems clear from your email that you associate the role of mother with that &quot;mother knows best&quot; schtick that is the hallmark of traditional parenting. If you&#39;re want to unschool then you need to reframe your role. Instead, be their more knowledgeable and experienced <i>partner</i> in life so that you can stop looking for The Line. And when you have immersed yourself in the mindset of partnership, where they aren&#39;t &quot;the kids&quot; and you &quot;the mom&quot;, and when you&#39;ve become comfortable with that role...maybe a few years from now...go back to thinking of yourself as &quot;mother.&quot; I think your psyche will have made the shift by then so that mother and partner feel synonymous. :-)&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><br></font><br><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68);background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">&lt;&lt;And what if the four year old is eating only candy for breakfast and lunch and no dinner?

Nope, that&#39;s not the mindset that will help.&nbsp;Instead, why not offer them food throughout the day? If they are busy watching tv or gaming or playing or reading...whatever they&#39;re doing, make them monkey platters with a variety of delicious finger foods. Include some candy on the tray, too, (maybe from your own private stash) so that you aren&#39;t turning these platters into the &quot;healthy&quot; food. I recently made a monkey platter for my 21 yo son while he&nbsp;was studying for his college exams and he loved it. They are perfect for nurturing a person of any age.&nbsp;</font></font></span><br><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#444444"><br></font></font></span><br><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">&lt;&lt;On a more hypothetical note, if they were drowning themselves in alcohol or drugs I would not want to be supplying it to them.&gt;&gt;</font><br><br><br>I understand the seeming logic of these kinds of analogies but they don&#39;t serve to bring much clarity unless you can see that a person &quot;drowning themselves in alcohol or drugs&quot; is an addict who is desperate to fill a void in themselves that has formed through emotional disconnection and/or emotional neglect and/or emotional abandonment. I think it&#39;s safe to assume your kids are not in that state, that their sugar consumption is a reaction to your previous control, and that if the rest of their childhoods progress with you learning how to see, relax and live in connection with each of them as the individual as he or she is, that desperate void will never become their state.&nbsp;<br><br><br>The key to learning how unschooling works is to pay close enough attention so that you can see what is not working, what is not bringing peace, and then try something else. When you&#39;re first starting out after having parented traditionally, take baby steps. Thoughtful baby steps. Large blind leaps of faith into unschooling invariably end in a feeling of chaos, so don&#39;t be afraid to go slow. T<span style="font-size:12pt;">he changes you make should be small enough to create more peace, not less.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;:-)</span><br><br><br><br>

<div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;Where does the mothering line lay within unschooling?&gt;&gt;</span><div><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div><font size="3">I understand where this question is coming from&nbsp;</font>because<font size="3">&nbsp;I used to wonder it myself. It comes from approaching unschooling as a set of behaviors and interactions, as a kind of program to follow. &quot;Unschoolers do x,y, and z, therefore that&#39;s what we&#39;ll do because we want to unschool.&quot; I understood the philosophy of unschooling, could talk the talk, <i>well</i> before I understood how to walk the talk. And it prompted me to jump ahead of myself a few times which caused me nothing but doubts and anxiety.</font></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt;They want bags and bags of candy. I bring it in (joyful).&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">Joyful...but with some inner tension? Your kids aren&#39;t relaxed about sugar not only because you&#39;ve never let them be, but because <i>you</i> are not genuinely relaxed about sugar, as is apparent from the way you have talked about it. :-) You have released the tension on it outwardly, but you haven&#39;t released the tension inwardly. And they know it, and so they don&#39;t trust your sudden about-face. Why should they? They can perceive you are judging the results and not happy with what you see. From their perspective, this whole bonanza could end just as abruptly as it started because mom isn&#39;t <i>truly</i> happy about it.</span></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;">&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve thought about each having their own bag but two of them end up taking from the others regardless.&gt;&gt;</span></div><div><span style="font-size:12pt;"><br></span></div><div><font size="3">I would stop with the communal bowl as it seems to be adding to the strife and let them each choose their own bag, and then figure out a way to safeguard the candy of those who get theirs taken. If needed, I would be a kind of depository for those kids, so that they can relax about having their&nbsp;</font>candy<font size="3">&nbsp;available when they want it.&nbsp;</font><br><div><div id="ygrps-yiv-225524910ecxygrp-mlmsg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-225524910ecxygrp-msg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-225524910ecxygrp-text">
<br>&lt;&lt;Where do I come in as a mother?  I don&#39;t want to be controlling about  how much comes in or how often.&gt;&gt;<br><br><br>Don&#39;t &quot;come in as a mother.&quot; It seems clear from your email that you associate the role of mother with that &quot;mother knows best&quot; schtick that is the hallmark of traditional parenting. If you&#39;re want to unschool then you need to reframe your role. Instead, be their more knowledgeable and experienced <i>partner</i> in life so that you can stop looking for The Line. And when you have immersed yourself in the mindset of partnership, where they aren&#39;t &quot;the kids&quot; and you &quot;the mom&quot;, and when you&#39;ve become comfortable with that role...maybe a few years from now...go back to thinking of yourself as &quot;mother.&quot; I think your psyche will have made the shift by then so that mother and partner feel synonymous. :-)&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><br></font><br><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68);background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">&lt;&lt;And what if the four year old is eating only candy for breakfast and lunch and no dinner? Shouldn&#39;t I be stepping in (neglect)?&gt;&gt;</font></span><br><span style="color:rgb(68, 68, 68);background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><br></font></span><br><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#444444">&quot;Step in&quot;? Nope, that&#39;s not the mindset that will help.&nbsp;Instead, why not offer them food throughout the day? If they are busy watching tv or gaming or playing or reading...whatever they&#39;re doing, make them monkey platters with a variety of delicious finger foods. Include some candy on the tray, too, (maybe from your own private stash) so that you aren&#39;t turning these platters into the &quot;healthy&quot; food. I recently made a monkey platter for my 21 yo son while he&nbsp;was studying for his college exams and he loved it. They are perfect for nurturing a person of any age.&nbsp;</font></font></span><br><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3"><font color="#444444"><br></font></font></span><br><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="3">&lt;&lt;On a more hypothetical note, if they were drowning themselves in alcohol or drugs I would not want to be supplying it to them.&gt;&gt;</font><br><br><br>I understand the seeming logic of these kinds of analogies but they don&#39;t serve to bring much clarity unless you can see that a person &quot;drowning themselves in alcohol or drugs&quot; is an addict who is desperate to fill a void in themselves that has formed through emotional disconnection and/or emotional neglect and/or emotional abandonment. I think it&#39;s safe to assume your kids are not in that state, that their sugar consumption is a reaction to your previous control, and that if the rest of their childhoods progress with you learning how to see, relax and live in connection with each of them as the individual as he or she is, that desperate void will never become their state.&nbsp;<br><br><br>The key to learning how unschooling works is to pay close enough attention so that you can see what is not working, what is not bringing peace, and then try something else. When you&#39;re first starting out after having parented traditionally, take baby steps. Thoughtful baby steps. Large blind leaps of faith into unschooling invariably end in a feeling of chaos, so don&#39;t be afraid to go slow. T<span style="font-size:12pt;">he changes you make should be small enough to create more peace, not less.</span><span style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;:-)</span><br><br><br><br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149676905"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra">You may consider trying to look at this issue of food from a different angle. Unschooling is about creating peaceful and joyful environment in which natural learning can thrive. Just because you buy your children some bags of candy and pretend to be joyful about it, they must feel your anxiety because I can sense it and we&#39;re over email. My gut reaction to your email was that you may be &quot;releasing controls&quot;, however, your &quot;knowledge of foods&quot; is getting in the way of seeing your children. </div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra">They&#39;re gorging because it&#39;s new. My kids have been there too. I have 5 and I used to go to Costco and the sweet treats/candy/novelty food items would be gone in a matter of hours. Now, a bit more than 2 years later, I go to Costco (or any store) and they eat naturally and without the frenzied energy of kids who have had nearly every bite controlled. They are comfortable now. They know the food is here and if it runs out, I will buy them more. Seeing them eat happily brings me great joy. Right now I&#39;m looking at a counter top full of fruits, veggies, cookies, brownies, frosted cupcakes, and Hawaiian bread. Some things have been here for quite some time, like the chocolate chip cookies, which used to be gone in no time, but this round has been here for at least a week.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra">How can your kids feel comfortable to eat shamelessly and comfortably if you are giving them a pep talk of sorts before you set the bowl of candy out? Would you talk about their &quot;beautiful bodies&quot; if you were setting out a bowl of bananas? Taking time to work on *your own* food issues will really help you and your children develop a healthy relationship with food.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra">I approach food much like my grandmother did because I was happiest as a child at my grandparent&#39;s house. Part of the reason is because she would always take me grocery shopping first thing, let me pick whatever I wanted, and make me everything with love and attentiveness. As I got older, she would always stock up on my favorites before I even got there. I could eat wherever and whenever I wanted with no judgement from her and so her house became my home. She also let me sleep however long I wanted and watch as much TV or play video games as I desired. She let me *be*, but didn&#39;t let me go. Looking back, I have the absolute best memories of my grandmother and our relationship stayed stronger than anything until she passed when I was 27. </div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra">The point of that ^^^ is to convey that the attitude in which you serve (food, your kids, anything) can alter the experience for the person being served. You don&#39;t need to talk about bodies before eating what you see as &quot;junk food&quot; because in reality, it is food. By allowing your children to become self-aware, they will know what&#39;s best to put in their body. Offer lots of choices of all kinds of foods. Buy fun new things. Bake together. They are learning how, why, how much, how does this make me feel, every time they eat. Let them learn. Stop trying to teach them. They may react differently to food than you do.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra">Before unschooling, I was dead set on my kids being the &quot;healthiest&quot; in the neighborhood. Blueberries for dessert, anyone? I had food issues. Unschooling has allowed me to open my mind to the infinite possibilities in all aspects of life, including food. I have taken time to recall my happiest moments as a child. I can tell you those memories do not include my parents limiting my sugar intake. Look at the history of food and sweets sometime, or of &quot;expert advice&quot;, or of what makes something beautiful. Open your mind, create an environment where your kids can learn peacefully and joyfully, regardless of what it is they&#39;re learning about. </div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra"><br></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1149676905gmail_extra"><div><div><div dir="ltr"><span style="border-collapse:collapse;"><font><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;">Warmly,</span><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"> </div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style=""><span style="font-size:12pt;"><span style=""><span style="font-size:12pt;"><strong>Megan</strong></span></span></span></span></span></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></div></font><div style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"></div><p style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin:0px;font-size:13px;"><font face="georgia, serif"><br></font></p><p style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;margin:0px;font-size:13px;"><font face="georgia, serif"><span></span><span></span><br></font></p></span></div></div></div>

  <div>


    <div>
      
      
      <p><br>
<br>
So the screens have been released and the sugar has been released. My husband and I have shared our knowledge about food with our children to prepare them/ to guide them, we are now trusting in them to take care of their beautiful body&#39;s. <br>
<br>
Sugar was our biggest control so I went and bought enough candy for Halloween and put it in a bowl in the house and let the kids know it was there. They devoured the entire bowl in a day (4 children ages 11-4).  When we went to the store they asked for more, so I bought it.  I suggested to them that they might want to pace themselves.  They devoured it all again.  This has been going on for about two weeks. <br>
<br>
It is so hard to watch. My heart breaks as I realise I&#39;ve done this to them by limiting it. So my question is, has anyone else had this  experience before and if so how long did the gorging go on?  I believe that it will be like a pendulum and ultimately they will settle into a healthy pace but I&#39;m not sure how to support them as a mother, hence my second question. <br>
<br>
Where does the mothering line lay within unschooling?   They want bags and bags of candy. I bring it in (joyful).   We talk about being kind to ourselves and others in regards to the candy (not taking all of it so others miss out, giving your body a safe amount, teeth, not hoarding, etc).  I then trust them to handle it the way they think is best.  By the end of the day they have eaten all the candy I&#39;ve bought. They&#39;ve eaten it without consideration, some have hoarded it and one ate so much that he ended up sleeping in the middle of the day for three hours.  On one hand I believe they are learning through these experiences (family members upset and disappointed that the candy is gone) but as a mother it is hard to watch. I&#39;ve thought about each having their own bag but two of them end up taking from the others regardless. <br>
<br>
Where do I come in as a mother?  I don&#39;t want to be controlling about  how much comes in or how often.  I don&#39;t want to punish for stealing. I want it to be available to them but I can&#39;t keep up with their intake.  And what if the four year old is eating only candy for breakfast and lunch and no dinner? Shouldn&#39;t I be stepping in (neglect)?<br>
<br>
On a more hypothetical note, if they were drowning themselves in alcohol or drugs I would not want to be supplying it to them. <br>
<br>
I truly believe though that it&#39;s their life and body and their path and I can try and prepare them but they have to work it out for themselves or they will never be able to trust themselves.  <br>
<br>
Please help me find a light that will guide me in this newly released territory. <br>
<br>
Thank you for all your time and effort.  I truly believe this group changes lives. <br>
Katie</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-899898633"><p dir="ltr">Can you take the kids to the produce section and buy all the exotic things you don&#39;t normally?  Purple carrots? Star fruit or lychee?</p>
<p dir="ltr">You and the kids aren&#39;t having fun with sugar. What about baking a cake? Use a mix if you aren&#39;t a baker. You can use a home made icing: butter, icing, vanilla extract and decorate it.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I&#39;m assuming you didn&#39;t just control sugar through candy, so instead of a crazy competitive bowl...why not a candle lit breakfast feast? Put out juice in fancy glasses. Hey some colourful napkins.  Try fresh or frozen waffles with choices of syrup, chocolate, whipped cream, strawberries, mini marshmallows, or cinnamon butter. Lots of possibility. Maybe make crepes?</p>
<p dir="ltr">Remember to join in the fun...even if your waffle is a handful of berries and cream. Be a partner in fun rather than setting up a competition with a giant bowl. The candy bowl doesn&#39;t sound like fun but like stress for all of you.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Candy shouldn&#39;t be treated as more or less desirable than other foods. It shouldn&#39;t create bad feelings and competition. Create good times instead. What about chocolate fondue? Fruits, mini marshmallows...</p>
<p dir="ltr">There are lots of ways to loosen up on sugar that can make it sociable rather than competitive.  Keep open access to candy but why not share popcorn and twizlers and m and m&#39;s while watching a movie together? Being together and sharing can be fun.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Hang out with the kids. You aren&#39;t an observer. You&#39;re a partner.</p>

After it feels better, I might ask if she has any ideas why it hurt.
