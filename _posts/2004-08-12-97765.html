Don&#39;t you just read things/ideas sometimes and they just totally RESONATE <br/>
with you?<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but I think people will attach other-worldly values to things that have <br/>
to do with human minds and biochemistry.   Dreams aren&#39;t messages from God or <br/>
devils.  Being in love isn&#39;t a conscious decision people make, it&#39;s a <br/>
biochemical change that has to do with mating and nesting and reproduction, and it <br/>
DOES fade (but can be replaced with another kind of devotion and love).  Recent <br/>
studies have found the part ofthe brain where &quot;religious experiences&quot; are. The <br/>
feeling of connectedness to everyone has a spot in the brain where certain <br/>
changes can take place in connection with religious experiences.  It&#39;s like an <br/>
orgasm of sorts.  And people have explained them in similar ways for centuries <br/>
(or longer).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen water mirages in the desert.  It&#39;s not real water but it sure looks <br/>
like it.<br/>
I&#39;ve had deja vu.  It doesn&#39;t mean the thing actually happened before.  It&#39;s <br/>
like a brain-mirage.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is the only one in our family who&#39;s ever really had an interest in the <br/>
Civil War.  Keith never much cared. I never did. Kirby and Holly didn&#39;t spark <br/>
to it.   I&#39;m interested in Marty&#39;s interest and we&#39;ve found details and trivia <br/>
for each other.    It doesn&#39;t prove that Marty&#39;s is a reincarnated Civil War <br/>
participant/victim/witness.   It&#39;s just an interest.  It might peter out soon, <br/>
or he might be a scholar or a moviemaker or novelist or he might just have <br/>
that interest all his life.  The model of the universe in his head will have <br/>
more civil war detail than some folks&#39;, and less than others.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s a way  he makes connections, and what has inspired his curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no benefit to making it bigger than it is.<br/>
