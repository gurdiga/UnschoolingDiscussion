<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time> 3 May 2004, at  3:50pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006195714">If anyone has read the unschooling.com boards, I posted that my 12 year old daughter has been &quot;hanging out&quot; with some people she believes are her friends, while I am worried because these friends are into high risk behavior and think &quot;parents are lame&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter wanted to emulate these kids, and has started smoking as well.<br/>
<br/>
I started by limiting the time she spends with them, but then thought that really wasn&#39;t going to work.  So I let her have her freedom, only asking that she carry a cell phone so if she needed to she could call me, and also so if I panic, I can call her.<br/>
<br/>
My goal was to preserve her freedom, while also protecting her from hurting herself (something she has done before, in the name of fitting in).<br/>
<br/>
Today, one of her &quot;Friends&quot; ditched her.  She told the girl that she is downright rude (Go dd!).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad I had let go of her, because now I am not the enemy and she could share and cry on my shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, I am looking for things for her to get involved in that she enjoys, and that she can make new friends with.  I am getting information on the SCA, and I&#39;ll probably check into some of the local theaters and stuff, to see if she can get involved.<br/>
<br/>
The unfortunate thing is that its either &quot;school at homers&quot; or public schoolers here.  And neither are ever available to just &quot;hang out&quot;.....which leaves us with people who avoid parents like the plague, even when I&#39;ve tried to make it appealing for them to be here.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any other suggestions for her to meet new people?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

For my 13 yo, 4H horseback riding has been fantastic. All the other <br/>
kids either go to school or are school-at-home homeschoolers, but when <br/>
they hang out together at the stables, none of that seems to matter at <br/>
all. It seems these girls have other things to think about and keep <br/>
busy with than bullying or cliques or that kind of thing. They can talk <br/>
for HOURS about which horse has the best trot and other such exciting <br/>
subjects! &lt;G&gt; It is a very supportive environment - 4H is based on <br/>
experiential learning - not &quot;teaching.&quot; It depends on the project <br/>
leaders, of course, but the organization is extremely welcoming to kids <br/>
with nonacademic leanings, in my experience. This translates into <br/>
simply being more welcoming to all kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358585373">She is 12.  I&#39;ll ask her about the 4H thing.  I know she was interested in horses before.  there is a local stable (well, about 1/2 hour away) that does work/study programs.<br/>
<br/>
There was something else I didn&#39;t mention though.  Very often she says &quot;Nah, thats boring&quot; to any suggestion I come up with.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a 12 year old girl thing?  She seems restless and disatisfied with *everything* in her life.<br/>

My suggestion is not to limit your target friends to people her age.  Why <br/>
can&#39;t she hang around with older people?  Adults?  That might be good for a while <br/>
until she finds some more people her age.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if she finds kids in the SCA or theatre groups it won&#39;t matter whether <br/>
they go to school or not, because they will have that common interest.<br/>

<br/>
This is so true.  We live in the Christian school at homer capital of the<br/>
world (or at least it seems like it).  So having the only Pagan unschooling<br/>
mom on the block didn&#39;t help our social situation.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is thirteen and is strikingly attractive (I can say that and not be<br/>
bragging since we aren&#39;t genetically related &lt;grin&gt;).  She had always been<br/>
quite popular because she is also smart, funny, and tremendously generous<br/>
with her time and things.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as she hit puberty, the girls started being mean to her, avoiding<br/>
her, not talking to her.  The boys are practically shooed away from her by<br/>
their moms.<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness, Adriane has continued with doing the things she loves.<br/>
Gymnastics and 4-H have allowed her to find friends from all over who are of<br/>
varying ages.<br/>

develops naturally.<br/>

Adriane took a gymnastics class.  She loved it.  It has developed into<br/>
traveling to competitions with her team,  10 hours of classes each week,<br/>
teaching up there 4 hours per week. and HANGING OUT in between those things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296466322">Hey Kristen....<br/>
<br/>
Yes....it&#39;s got to be a 12 yr old thing (maybe not just girl thing <br/>
though...I seem to recall my son being that way then too)  And of course, I <br/>
thing my daughter has been kind of like this since the age of 9, and others <br/>
tell me that puberty for girls lasts until they move out, right!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I too have a social butterfly living with us and who can&#39;t seem to <br/>
get happy about much.  All I can do is try everything.<br/>
<br/>
The loneliness has always been hardest for someone who wants playmates 24 <br/>
hrs a day (literally).  I try to keep her days as busy as I can with no <br/>
guarantee that she will have regular playmates or that she will agree to <br/>
any of the activities.  Occasionally we do meet up with some girl that we <br/>
have seen at other activities and over time they have become friends, and <br/>
then they meet outside these activities.  We&#39;re in Girl Scouts, which was <br/>
fine until this year as the separation between her school friends has <br/>
widened into a canyon, so now we go Juliet Lowe(independent).  We are in <br/>
the process of starting a homeschool group of Girl Scouts.  We also <br/>
participate in a homeschool cooperative one day a week for science and <br/>
drama classes which provides almost a school atmosphere where she meets <br/>
lots of girls and boys all ages and has made at least one real friend.  She <br/>
picks the classes and has tried and dropped any number of them.  She goes <br/>
for fun.<br/>
<br/>
We volunteer at an animal shelter once a week during the morning, doing the <br/>
cat room with two other adults.  My daughter likes animals.  But since she <br/>
has started up with horseback riding lessons, and has indicated she would <br/>
like to see about working/volunteering at the stable, we&#39;ll probably finish <br/>
off our year at the shelter and drop that.  There are always girls hanging <br/>
around the stable so she will probably meet some friends there. <br/>
(www.volunteermatch.com)<br/>
<br/>
I just joined a local rock club that has a junior member section and they <br/>
have their own field trips.  There are square dance clubs that often have <br/>
teen members.  Does your YMCA have a homeschool day?  Some of the local <br/>
Park and Rec departments in our state have homeschool classes/art classes <br/>
etc.  What about your homeschool support groups in the area?  any <br/>
activities they are doing?  I have often joined any number of these just to <br/>
get their directories and them combed them to looked for any local <br/>
people.  I would then email or call them to see if they want to get <br/>
together with me and my daughter....make &quot;playdates.&quot;  Most often they too <br/>
have the same problem.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, there&#39;s the internet.  My daughter is major into neopets right <br/>
now.  They have a whole website, with their own &quot;neomail&quot; and other kids <br/>
on-line and she and her girl friend often communicate at night this <br/>
way.  You set up a store and paint it, and get mdse for it and price the <br/>
mdse and earn points to shop in other people&#39;s stores through playing all <br/>
these games, and tons of other stuff that I have no idea about, but she <br/>
spends hours on it in the middle of the night.  She sets up her own website <br/>
or something on there and goes to town.  She often talks about the new <br/>
friends she has made on-line...and yes, we do talk about all the caveats, <br/>
and it seems safe and approved.  It is not a chat room.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately though, we talk about how homeschooling isn&#39;t like &quot;school&quot; and <br/>
how good that is. We discuss what a friend is.  She has had some bad <br/>
experiences with the girls in the neighborhood that she has grown up with, <br/>
and initially gone to school with.  She doesn&#39;t like these girls anymore, <br/>
but is torn between wanting to play with anyone she can and yet knowing how <br/>
they treat her.  It&#39;s definitely a growing process.  She knows that she <br/>
will never have a whole group of girls like her to &quot;hang out with.&quot;  She <br/>
too would love to have them here right in the neighborhood. But wishing <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s going to happen.  So you deal with it and do the best you <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
You might also read the book Odd Girl Out by Rachel Simmons.  It gave me <br/>
excellent insight into the whole girlfriend paradigm and helped me <br/>
understand why girls/we do some things that they/we do/did when it comes to <br/>
having or being friends.  However, Simmons really needs to do a whole new <br/>
book on homeschool girls, as the above book appears to be entirely on <br/>
public-schooled girls.  Interesting reading though.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the length of the email...hope you can use some of the <br/>
ideas...but rest assured, you are not alone!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; The loneliness has always been hardest for someone who wants playmates 24 <br/>
hrs a day (literally).  I try to keep her days as busy as I can with no <br/>
guarantee that she will have regular playmates or that she will agree to <br/>
any of the activities.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you find friends who can do overnighters a lot?  We had a lot of that <br/>
when the kids were younger.  Wait!  Still. &lt;g&gt;  We have an extra teenaged boy <br/>
right now.  There were three or four last weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s a homeschooling kid whose parents have moved out of town and is <br/>
missing being in town.  We had a one of those when kids were younger.  If he <br/>
stayed over to do something at a museum or gaming store the next day, it was <br/>
fine for him and great for my boys.  They got along better when there were <br/>
three than two.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has girls over sometimes and it really makes the day different, and her <br/>
toys different, and the rats different.<br/>
<br/>
But within the last fifteen minutes she was asking why one particular friend <br/>
wasn&#39;t fun and goofy anymore, but so serious.  Puberty.  We discussed Peter <br/>
Pan.  I commiserated wtih her.  It&#39;s sad.  Kids change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-710368446">My almost-12 girl saw &quot;Mean Girls&quot;.  She loved it, thought it was hilarious and pretty true to life (saw it with friend, almost 16yo pub sch girl).  She said it &quot;had a good message&quot;. She was a little bothered by the stereotypes of homeschoolers it portrayed, though.<br/>

Those are true to life too, and the point was that it was the homeschooled <br/>
teen acknolwedging that some people think of homeschoolers as all being one of <br/>
those two ways, but they&#39;re not.  And that&#39;s true.  But some are. <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was a really good movie.  I saw it with Kirby, after he and the <br/>
other kids had gone to see it with three other homeschoolers.<br/>
