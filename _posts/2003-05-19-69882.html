<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I feel like I should be reading everything to make an informed<br/>
&gt; decision before putting my 2 bits out there, but just don&#39;t always find the<br/>
&gt; time to get through them all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Welcome, Nicholina.  Many people occasionally do mass deleting or go on no<br/>
mail for a time.  Read what you can, and then post what you feel will help.<br/>
There is no requirement to read everything!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to say, though, that lately I&#39;ve been feeling like I am not patient and<br/>
&gt; creative enough with problem solving with Davan.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every day?  Or just sometimes?  I&#39;m not a perfect parent.  There are days I<br/>
should be more patient and I&#39;m not.  I know how to apologize, though, and<br/>
try to remember to do so.  And I have learned more patience and creativity<br/>
with effort in that direction.  It&#39;s something I have really worked on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do any of you ever<br/>
&gt; feel like you don&#39;t have enough patience for this job?  Sometimes I wonder<br/>
&gt; about myself....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, sometimes I wonder about myself, too.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re dealing with a five year old.  She&#39;s just a little girl now, and<br/>
it will get easier as she gets older.  Mine is six, heading towards seven<br/>
this summer, and he&#39;s grown so much in the last year, it&#39;s just amazing.<br/>
Some of this is age.<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;m not the person I want to be, and sometimes I&#39;m discouraged by<br/>
that.  But I also know that there is nowhere else my child could be where he<br/>
would receive as much respect as he gets at home.  Certainly he wouldn&#39;t get<br/>
it at school!  And we&#39;re both pretty happy, really.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, here I am, and I imagine that now I&#39;ve broken the ice with my first post,<br/>
&gt; there will be more to follow.  :)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good!<br/>

Just like with our kids, you might not like your choices in some <br/>
moments, you might not like some of your actions or patterns of <br/>
behavior in certain situations, but remember that you are Who You <br/>
Are. We are all a work in progress and finding our way along the <br/>
path. <br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First, remember that &quot;young humans are designed to withstand incredible <br/>
amounts of ineptness in their elders.&quot; (I read this somewhere - I THINK <br/>
it was in &quot;Math Power: How to Help Your Kid Like Math Even if You <br/>
Don&#39;t&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
If you are worried about not being patient enough, creative enough, or <br/>
any other kind of &quot;enough,&quot; it just shows that you&#39;re a conscientious <br/>
parent and you&#39;ll be just fine!!<br/>
