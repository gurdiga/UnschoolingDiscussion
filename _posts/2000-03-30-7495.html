How thrilling! It&#39;s so exciting to hear the stories of learning. I had been <br/>
bothered by my 6 yr. old (7 next mth.)not reading. I read John Holt&#39;s book <br/>
&quot;Learning All The Time&quot; and it enlightened me on the subject. I just totally <br/>
dropped the subject of reading and last night as I was reading a book to him, <br/>
he said &quot;Hay, I can read this, it&#39;s an easy reader.&quot; And he proceeded to read <br/>
a few words! It was exciting! Congratulations on your childrens new <br/>
accomplishment.<br/>

    Isn&#39;t it funny how kids are always suprising us?  Just when you needed it <br/>
too.  I have also been worried about my 11yod lately.  She didn&#39;t seem to be <br/>
interested in anything that I saw as learning.  Then we decided to do a <br/>
nature journal like Charlotte Mason recommends.  Well, she is a different <br/>
kid!  The first day, she decided to write a beautiful poem for the front page <br/>
of her journal. [ This from a kid who swears she hates to write]!  And even <br/>
though we always go for a daily walk - the dog insists-, now she&#39;s eager to <br/>
go to see what she will find to write about in her journal!  She also <br/>
informed me the other day that she really doesn&#39;t need to know all that math <br/>
& history that I have been trying to teach her!  She&#39;s going to be a writer <br/>
and an environmentalist!  I&#39;m just happy she found something she really wants <br/>
to do.  I guess there is hope for all kids if we Trust!    jackie</div>

What a great unschooling moment! I was worried about my then-almost 7 yo son <br/>
not &quot;getting&quot; phonics and I tortured the poor child with 5 pages of it a day <br/>
last winter! He would wait until I left the room and then peek at the <br/>
previous pages to see which vowel to fill in! When he told me this, I totally <br/>
laid off the phonics and let him do what he wanted, which was to play against <br/>
himself in Monopoly all day long. After a week or two of this he was reading <br/>
everything he could get his hands on and multiplying with gusto!LOL!<br/>
