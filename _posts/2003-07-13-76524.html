&gt; Hi Sue!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (I suck at greetings.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I tried to discuss how introductions work last month I was pounced upon <br/>
repeatedly! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I learned about introductions and greetings in girl scout handbooks and at <br/>
school.  I praticed at church and in club meetings and I wtched to see which <br/>
adults did it really well.<br/>
<br/>
Pete Domenici.  Senator from New Mexico.  I&#39;ve been to two social events of <br/>
his close family.  A LLL leader friend of mine married his son and I did the <br/>
wedding music, and then Keith and I played  Hogwarts teachers for a surprise <br/>
Harry Potter party for his teenaged grandson.<br/>
<br/>
Both times, he impressed the heck out of me with his social  skills.  And <br/>
think how easy we were after international diplomacy situations! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today there was an open house at Honeywell, where Keith works.  It was the <br/>
first one since Holly was little, and we had fun.  One of the vice presidents <br/>
was in the dunking tank when we were leaving.  If adults missed their three <br/>
balls, they were done.  If kids missed, the woman running the game sent them to <br/>
push the switch, so pretty much he was getting dunked every minute or two for <br/>
half an hour.   He was probably not 40, maybe early 30&#39;s.  Keith said he&#39;s <br/>
management because he has the skills to do that job--he remembers everyone&#39;s name <br/>
he&#39;s ever met, and is more business minded than engineering minded.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we think kids need math and science but we don&#39;t think of how much <br/>
nurturing their existing talents with other people could help them out in the <br/>
world!<br/>
