&gt; but what about these adults who can&#39;t read? how did that happen, if<br/>
&gt; reading is inevitable, lessons or no lessons?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reading isn&#39;t inevitable, lessons or no lessons. It is entirely possible<br/>
(and done in schools and school-at-home families every day) to suck the joy<br/>
out of learning to read (or anything else), sometimes to the point where the<br/>
child simply refuses on every level to have anything to do with something<br/>
that is being made to be a torture.<br/>
<br/>
It is also very likely that if an unschooled child lived somewhat isolated<br/>
in a non-reading family that also banned video games and television (because<br/>
there is so much reading involved in both those media outlets these days)<br/>
they would not learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
Reading isn&#39;t Athena, springing full-sized from the head of Zeus in a ta-da!<br/>
overblown Greek romance. It&#39;s simply as natural as learning to ride a bike<br/>
in a bike-riding family, or learn to train a dog in a dog-training family,<br/>
or learn to cook in a family that eats their meals at home.<br/>
