&gt; now? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are some of the things I would do:<br/>
1) Visit a cave<br/>
2) Dig a big hole about 2&#39; deep  and examine the layers of earth.<br/>
3) Visit a jeweler and look at and identify different gems and stones.<br/>
4) Buy or borrow a tumbling machine and try all different kinds of rocks<br/>
in it. Make jewelry for presents.<br/>
5) Visit a quarry and watch them in operation.<br/>
6) Make a crystal garden.<br/>
7) Collect larger interesting rocks and make a rock garden. Research what<br/>
plants and animals would prefer this type of environment, and add them to<br/>
the garden.<br/>
8) Visit a coal mine.<br/>
9) Put a handful of dirt in a paint strainer. Pour water through it till<br/>
only sediment remains. Try to identify the sediment.<br/>
10) Highly recommend &quot;365 Super Science Experiments with everyday<br/>
materials&quot; for all kinds of rock type experiments.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
Find a magnet, and see if any of the dirt in your yard is iron!  Because of <br/>
drainage from the mountain above us, we have more iron in our yard than is <br/>
natural or average, so Marty has collected a couple of pounds of it.  He has <br/>
a piece of magnet that came out of a speaker that a friend gave him.  He puts <br/>
it in a ziploc bag, ties a string to the bag, drags it around and then turns <br/>
the bag inside out and removes the magnet to collect the iron dust.<br/>
<br/>
This won&#39;t work everywhere, but you might find other stuff I could never find <br/>
in my yard, too!<br/>
