<div id="ygrps-yiv-613598635">This morning I was on the phone at 6:35 talking to my husband who was at <br/>
work. I heard the bedroom door open quietly.<br/>
<br/>
Usually at 6:30 everyone&#39;s asleep, so it was unusual. It was Marty (16), and <br/>
he said he needed to talk to me about his plans for the day. I asked if he <br/>
wanted Keith to hear it too, and he said sure, so I stayed on the phone. He said <br/>
&quot;I want to go with Ryan. He wants to pick me up in half an hour.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I waited. I smiled. I said &quot;Okay, but... where?&quot; I kinda thought by the time <br/>
and manner of the asking it was an out-of-town trip. No. &quot;To stand in line to <br/>
buy an XBox 360.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So we discussed money and logistics and such, and it was a go.<br/>
<br/>
I got up and came to help Marty checklist his day and not forget anything <br/>
They&#39;ll be inside a WalMart, so honestly, just about anything he had forgotten <br/>
would be there, and I wasn&#39;t too worried. It wasn&#39;t like standing in a line at a <br/>
campground 20 miles from running water.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about the other people&#39;s day, and Kirby&#39;s working, but Marty had <br/>
Kirby&#39;s money already--they&#39;re going together on a system with money they&#39;ve <br/>
both been saving. (Kirby is 19.) Then Marty said &quot;He&#39;s going to stand in line <br/>
too, but with [some other friends]. We had a big fight about it last night, but <br/>
don&#39;t get on him about it because it was my fault.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if they had hit each other. No. Were there mortal insults? No.<br/>
I asked if he wanted to tell me about it, and he said no, that Holly (14) <br/>
could tell me.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, I wouldn&#39;t have trusted any other kid in our family (my <br/>
sister and two same-age cousins) to tell my side of anything, or to give a <br/>
neutral account of anything.<br/>
<br/>
Holly will probably really enjoy telling me, because she&#39;s very interested in <br/>
interpersonal stuff of all sorts.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was awake and getting ready for work, I said &quot;Marty says you got <br/>
in in a fight last night, but that it was stupid, and that it was his fault.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby said, &quot;It WAS stupid, and it WAS his fault.&quot; He didn&#39;t sound angry or <br/>
frustrated, just matter-of-fact.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Are you both going to be okay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll be okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s still asleep, so I don&#39;t know what it was about or how bad it was, <br/>
but it wasn&#39;t TOO bad, because they didn&#39;t break their plan to share an XBox, <br/>
and there wasn&#39;t soul-wounding name calling or physical violence.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s a bad day at our house. NOT TOO BAD!!<br/>

<br/>
=============================================<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I posted at unschooling.info while the boys were still out in <br/>
lines to get XBox 360.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly and I talked about it some more.   I told her that if there <br/>
was no hitting or name calling, it wasn&#39;t really much of a fight.   She agreed <br/>
it was just an emotional discussion.   I asked her if either of them said <br/>
anything mean, and she thought about it, and came up with the meanest thing having <br/>
been Marty to Kirby, saying something like &quot;I don&#39;t know your friends and I <br/>
don&#39;t trust their plans.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We laughed.   He didn&#39;t even say &quot;I don&#39;t know your stupid friends and I <br/>
don&#39;t trust their stupid plans.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
She said he told Kirby that he knew Ryan better, and would rather stand in <br/>
line with him.<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out, they didn&#39;t let kids substitute for others in line anyway, <br/>
so the whole original plan WAS an unworkable plan.   <br/>
<br/>
Everyone of those two groups who wanted the system got one, but the world is <br/>
woefully undersupplied for that system and they scalpers are out selling them <br/>
for twice their price.   Kirby says the next shipment is supposed to be <br/>
December 23, but that will keep LOTS of kids from getting one for Christmas.   <br/>
Parents won&#39;t be able to stand in line to get them.   Amazon isn&#39;t even taking <br/>
orders for them.    <br/>
<br/>
Store security escorted people out to their cars so they wouldn&#39;t be robbed <br/>
in the parking lot.<br/>
<br/>
What made it possible for Marty to stand in line at WalMart for sixteen or <br/>
eighteen hours was that he didn&#39;t have to go to school.   What made it possible <br/>
for them to stay at WalMart until after midnight, ditto.   But there are <br/>
others who don&#39;t go to school whose parents probably just said no, you can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
They were in a safe place with people they liked doing a cool and legal <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
Gail (and Brenna and Logan) visited them in line, and took Marty some food.   <br/>
THANK YOU for that, Gail!!<br/>

 <br/>
We ordered---and PREPAID---for Duncan&#39;s in October when Ben got a bonus. The store called Monday and said that we *needed* to pick it up between 9:00 and 9:00. Cam and I got there around 11:30 or so---store was really quiet. One of the employees is a friend of Cameron&#39;s. They made plans to meet later that evening at our house for something musical. When Brandon got here, he told us that the store only received 23 360s! They&#39;d ordered over 100! And that, unopened, they were going for as high as $2500 on e-bay!<br/>
 <br/>
Ben said we ought to have a talk with Duncan and see whether it would be worth it to *him* to sell it on-line! &lt;G&gt; I doubt he&#39;d be all that interested! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Now I need to buy a $60 game to go with it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353320103">Has it ever occurred to people that the scarcity is intentional? That  <br/>
Micro$oft is undersupplying stores on purpose as part of their  <br/>
marketing hype? Remember, there is no law that obligates Micro$oft to  <br/>
satisfy demand.<br/>
<br/>
Theoretically they loose money on the boxes. So creating a demand  <br/>
because people cannot find them is a way of expanding their market.<br/>
<br/>
How does this relate to unschooling? glad you asked!<br/>
<br/>
* the hype aroound &#39;good&#39; mainstream education as the product of a  <br/>
few &#39;good&#39; schools or a few &#39;good&#39; teachers<br/>
* food/eating habits; especially when it happens around candy<br/>
* TV and gaming privileges at home<br/>
<br/>
Creating scarcity to exploit profit ... oldest trick in the book.  <br/>
Because, don&#39;t we extract a profit out of controlling food, play and  <br/>
learning?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83498424">My son (16) spent the night in a Target parking lot to get one, and <br/>
it already had a glitch- which they know about (microsoft), they are <br/>
sending a prepaid box, he has to send it to them for repair or <br/>
replacement, they are sending it back within 10 days with a free <br/>
game for the inconvenience. ($60 for game value). Also, they <br/>
answered at 1:30am Thursday morning when he was having problems. So <br/>
I also doubt any consiracy and they have provided great service (so <br/>
far), and are also fixing at their total expense. By the way- the <br/>
glitch is that it freezes during gameplay- it was actually mentioned <br/>
in our local newspaper as I guess there are many with this &quot;glitch&quot;. <br/>
He still says it was worth it. ;)<br/>
