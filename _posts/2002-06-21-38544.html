<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639511647">My daughter always fought with constipation.  Once she was able to take down a small pill, I started giving her one grape seed pill each day.  For some, it&#39;s better to give it to them everyother day.  They are full of Vitamin A and C and totally natural.  Works like a charm.  (It just softens it).<br/>
