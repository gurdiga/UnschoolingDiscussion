This makes me think of a Christmas present my mum gave me when I was 7. It<br/>
was a seesaw that would spin as well as seesaw. It was the coolest present I<br/>
ever received. If you crab-walked really quickly you could then both lift<br/>
your legs and lean back and spin around and around for ages. My cousins and<br/>
I had hours and hours of joy with that seesaw. I was wishing this year (last<br/>
year I mean) I could have bought one for my kids but they would definitely<br/>
be considered a dangerous toy these days. The last seesaw in town was<br/>
removed several months ago.<br/>

been busier than usual. The computer has been very neglected but better the<br/>
computer than the kids!)<br/>

This makes me think of a Christmas present my mum  gave me when I was 7. It<br/>
was a seesaw that would spin as well as seesaw. It  was the coolest present I<br/>
ever received. If you crab-walked really quickly  you could then both lift<br/>
your legs and lean back and spin around and around  for ages. My cousins and<br/>
I had hours and hours of joy with that seesaw. I  was wishing this year (last<br/>
year I mean) I could have bought one for my  kids but they would definitely<br/>
be considered a dangerous toy these days.  The last seesaw in town was<br/>
removed several months  ago.<br/>
<br/>

----------------<br/>
 <br/>
When I was little, my dad made us a merry go round and a see saw.  We  left <br/>
for the summer, and &quot;bad kids&quot; had broken the see saw by putting concrete  <br/>
blocks on one end (probably trying to ride or throw them, but the board was  <br/>
broken).<br/>
 <br/>
They were nice things.  The merry go round was steel with  ball bearings, and <br/>
instead of a flat surface, my dad left the angle iron so we  could sit inside <br/>
and go.  Dangerous, but they all are.  We just  learned to be careful.  The <br/>
seesaw was a 2x12  mounted on a steel pipe  frame with a... I don&#39;t know what <br/>
it&#39;s called.  Another ball bearing  situation, though, with a flat surface.  <br/>
Maybe some kind of big-steel-door  hinge.  (My dad was working in steel <br/>
construction in those days.)<br/>
 <br/>
When we moved to New Mexico that year, he made us another seesaw, even  <br/>
better, same mechanics, but each end of the board had a indentations to make it  <br/>
more comfortable to sit on, and a t-handle  mounted for holding onto.   We <br/>
played with it for years and years. It was a great place to just sit and  talk.<br/>
 <br/>
Nobody ever got hurt.<br/>

This brings back good memories.  When I was little..maybe 10ish. my friend<br/>
and I decided to try to set the world record for teeter tottering.  We spent<br/>
8 or 10 hours teeter tottering and one of my siblings took over for us if we<br/>
had to use the bathroom for a minute. (but we never stopped teetering!)  My<br/>
mom brought us out our lunch and snacks.  Our teeter totter was a really big<br/>
plank on a log, which was set on a saw horse.  We used it for years and the<br/>
plank was nice and long so you went really high.  Great memories!  I made<br/>
one for my kids once and they never got very interested in it.  That was a<br/>
few years ago.  Maybe in the spring I&#39;ll make a new one.with a nice long<br/>
plank. <br/>

Or until your brother jumps off while you&#39;re in the air, and on impact you  <br/>
fly over the bar and break your nose.  Isn&#39;t it nice not to be alone,  Julie?  <br/>
