So what *do* some of you say to your teens when they&#39;re heading off to do<br/>

&quot;I love you!&quot;<br/>

Last night I added: &quot;And no smoking in the car!&quot; &lt;G&gt;  (new driver&#39;s license)<br/>
<br/>
When he was little, I&#39;d say, &quot;Be kind. Be careful. And behave.&quot; We dropped <br/>
the &quot;behave&quot; sometime in first grade, so it remained: &quot;Be kind and be careful. I <br/>
love you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I shortened it to, &quot;You know&quot;----just so&#39;s not to embarrass <br/>
him. More recently he said that that mushy stuff doesn&#39;t embarrass him----and <br/>
that he kind of likes it, so now I get away with &quot;I love you!&quot; &lt;g&gt; And I get a <br/>
hug and a kiss, too! <br/>

Lanora is just 13 days away from being 13, an &quot;official&quot; teen.  I say &quot;I<br/>
love you, have fun&quot; when we part.  She&#39;s so careful, even to the point of<br/>
worry at times, &quot;be careful&quot; would be almost cruel. LOL<br/>

Ours is &quot;mom stuff.&quot;<br/>

I say &quot;Mom stuff,&quot; and they say &quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br/>
