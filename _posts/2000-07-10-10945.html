<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391722543">Hi Sonia,<br/>
Where are you at in Saskatoon?  My father-in-law is from Saskatoon, in fact <br/>
he is going back there this month for a family reunion of sorts.  Wish that <br/>
we could go to, but it is cost prohibitive for my family.  He always talks <br/>
about Saskatoon berries and his brother sends him jelly that he makes with <br/>
them.<br/>

&gt;My daughters will enjoy this immensely!    OOOOPS!   My apologies to all<br/>
&gt;the delightful mamas of Saskatoon!   Amy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey Amy, YOU can&#39;t be &quot;the nasty Mom from Saskatoon&quot;...what would that<br/>
&gt; &gt;make me?  (I&#39;m REALLY in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan!)  Actually, here in<br/>
&gt; &gt;Saskatoon, there is no such thing as &quot;a nasty Mom&quot;!!!  That&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; &gt;rumour...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;heh, heh, heh,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-567060978">I just had to poke my head in here (even though Im DAYS behind on my <br/>
reading)  One day when Lili (age 4)  was about 1 1/2 - 2  she decided that <br/>
tantrums were a good way of getting what she wanted.   For a while I just <br/>
didn&#39;t know what to do.  I tried everything I saw in books ect.  Then one <br/>
day I said &quot;No&quot; to something...I don&#39;t remember what...and she started her <br/>
tantrum.   She was only wearing a diaper and she THREW her body down onto <br/>
the ground with her little face all twisted up and screeching while banging <br/>
her head, hands and feet on the floor.   I couldn&#39;t help but laugh at her.  <br/>
She looked so funny thats all I could do.   Well, she looked up at me like <br/>
&quot;Thats not the right response&quot;  and tried it again which just made me laugh <br/>
harder.   She got herself right up off the floor and just stared at me.   <br/>
She couldn&#39;t figure out what was wrong with Mommie.  It was great.  After <br/>
that every time she would start her tantrums I just blew it off and laughed. <br/>
   She only had one or two more tantrums before she quit all together.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I know this sounds strange, but when my 3yo objects to something, what <br/>
&gt;often<br/>
&gt;works is to sympathize (&quot;I know it&#39;s really rotten that we have to leave<br/>
&gt;now, I wish we could stay...&quot; &quot;I would love to get some French fries! I <br/>
&gt;wish<br/>
&gt;I had some now!&quot;). It seems to make him feel better than if I try to change<br/>
&gt;his mind about being unhappy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When he objects to something in a very loud and whiny way, I tell him right<br/>
&gt;away that he can cry as hard as he wants and it&#39;s not going to change my<br/>
&gt;mind. (Screaming for candy in the store is one example.) I actually urge<br/>
&gt;him, very sincerely, to scream and howl as loudly as he can. (Louder!<br/>
&gt;Louder!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That really seems to take the wind out of his sails for tantrums. It works<br/>
&gt;for my little guy ... maybe it will help someone else too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As far as not behaving civilly at home...I think we&#39;re pretty tolerant, but<br/>
&gt;if he completely disrupts dinner, or Tony and I can&#39;t read a book because<br/>
&gt;Nicky is yelling that he wants to read something else, I take him by the<br/>
&gt;hand and lead him to his room. I tell him he can rejoin us when he can be<br/>
&gt;quiet or stop spitting or stop throwing food or whatever (aren&#39;t toddlers<br/>
&gt;delightful? Well, yes, they can be....). That seems to leave the decision <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;return in his control.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
