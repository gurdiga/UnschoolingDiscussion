&lt;&lt; Dear Unschoolers:  Has anyone seen an Eskimo movie acted and written by<br/>
 Eskimos?  I can&#39;t seem to find any web site on it.  I heard it was<br/>
 called &quot;Fast Runner.&quot;  Has anyone know or seen it?  Thank you.  Lisa of<br/>
 MT &gt;&gt;<br/>

If you need an Alaska contact for any of your questions, try Heidi (my sis) <br/>
at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:snavley@...">snavley@...</a>. I&#39;m sure she could answer some of your questions or <br/>
look for stuff like this when she&#39;s out and about.<br/>
We had an &quot;Ana Maimie&quot; (Grandma Maimie) that was a little Eskimo lady in our <br/>
church who was raised in the traditional ways.<br/>
I have the mukluks she gave me as a child still. In her adult life she hunted <br/>
from an airplane with her dh, he flew the plane and she was the shooter. Very <br/>
interesting life.<br/>
She died a few years ago, but I have her life story somewhere (which includes <br/>
her Christian conversion to the church that I left some time ago) if I can <br/>
find it I&#39;d be happy to copy any interesting parts. <br/>
