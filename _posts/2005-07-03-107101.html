<h4>Billy or Nancy</h4>
<time> 2 Jul 2005, at  5:50pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46274732">For those of you who don&#39;t know, the Greer gang in Maryland has been<br/>
studying martial arts at Jing Ying Institute for about 2 years. Glen, Lane<br/>
and I regularly attend Kung Fu classes, while Nancy, Lane and I attend Tai<br/>
Chi classes (about 1 year now). We fell in love with the place and went from<br/>
struggling to squeeze in classes twice a week to going there almost every<br/>
day. I was pleasantly surprised that they took to it so well since they had<br/>
never been involved in organized sports or strenuous physical activity<br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Last August, the owner of the studio told us that she had some family health<br/>
problems and couldn&#39;t keep running the school. She said that it would close<br/>
on Sept 1st if she didn&#39;t find someone to take it over. We couldn&#39;t imagine<br/>
trying to find another place to train, so we gave up replacing our van<br/>
(after all, it&#39;s only 15 years old and has less than 230,000 miles on it)<br/>
and instead bought the school. We sometimes jokingly tell people that we<br/>
liked the classes so much we bought the school for our kids! It&#39;s kind of<br/>
strange owning a martial arts school and actually still being a student who<br/>
isn&#39;t even a black belt yet, but fortunately we had good instructors already<br/>
in place.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, last weekend, Lane and I competed in the USA National Open Martial<br/>
Arts Tournament. Glen had been planning on competing too, but was sick all<br/>
week and didn&#39;t attend any classes. Although he was feeling better on<br/>
Saturday, he wasn&#39;t feeling ready to compete and decided to be a spectator<br/>
and part of our cheering section instead. He apparently did a very good job.<br/>
<br/>
In the women&#39;s division, Lane (13) competed in tai chi forms and won gold<br/>
with her 18 step Essence form, competed in tai chi weapons and won gold with<br/>
her straight sword form, and competed in sparring and won gold.<br/>
<br/>
In the men&#39;s division, I (46) competed in tai chi forms and won gold with my<br/>
18 step Essence form, competed in empty hand forms and won gold with my<br/>
Shaolin Fist form, and competed in sparring and won gold.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, Lane and I performed together in the two-man fighting set<br/>
competition (like regular forms, but with 2 people in kind of a<br/>
choreographed fight sequence) and won gold.<br/>
<br/>
We left after our events were over (it was a long day and we were stopping<br/>
by the grandparents before heading home) and didn&#39;t wait to see the finals<br/>
or find out who the grand champions were for the tournament (usually a black<br/>
belt grand champion is the highest award, then an under belt (non-black<br/>
belt) grand champion is also selected). Anyway, I later got a call from the<br/>
tournament organizer informing me that I was the under belt grand champion<br/>
of the tournament! He&#39;s even going to come out to deliver the trophy.<br/>
<br/>
We have another big tournament coming up in DC on July 3, then will be<br/>
marching in the Severna Park (Maryland) Independence day parade on the 4th<br/>
and performing demonstration at the Park Plaza shopping center after the<br/>
parade. Wish us luck!<br/>
<br/>

Congratulations, and thanks for sharing that big news with us.<br/>
<br/>
A martial arts school instead of a van, huh?   Wow.<br/>

One thing about adding the Kung Fu school to our workload is that <br/>
we&#39;ve had to cut back on traveling for FUN Books. We aren&#39;t going to <br/>
any conferences outside our immediate area.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting how the Live and Learn conference has been <br/>
connected with the martial arts studio. At the first conference in <br/>
SC, my daughter and I got up early to do a Tai Chi workshop with Luz <br/>
Shosie at the side of the pool. That was our first experience trying <br/>
it and now we are both taking regular classes and performing in <br/>
tournaments.<br/>
<br/>
Last year the LAL conference in MA was just before we took over the <br/>
studio. As I mentioned previously, it was in early August when we <br/>
were told the studio would be closing Sept 1st if someone didn&#39;t <br/>
take it over. We basically had 2 weeks to decide to take over the <br/>
studio, form an LLC, and complete all the other arrangements because <br/>
the last week in August was the conference. If we had known about <br/>
the situation with the studio before we promised to be at the <br/>
conference, we probably wouldn&#39;t have come. <br/>
<br/>
We actually spent our first days of at the conference. That year, we <br/>
were the one performing Tai Chi early in the morning at the side of <br/>
the pool. Nancy, I, Glen and Lane had just started studying <br/>
together. Lane and I also did a kung fu demo at the talent show.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169721115">We&#39;d probably be a bit of a commute. We&#39;re close to Annapolis.<br/>
<br/>
Three of our black belt students were homeschooled all their lives <br/>
and I can think of at least 5 other advanced belt students who are <br/>
homeschooled. They all started before we did, so the atmoshpere of <br/>
our school just seems to appeal to homeschoolers. When our head <br/>
instructor realized that many of his best students were <br/>
homeschooled, and he saw how much he liked the kids in the PE <br/>
program, he started asking me for more info about homeschooling. <br/>
When his kids turned school age, he ended up starting them with <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-274363190">The karate studio my daughter goes to here in Southern California is <br/>
owned and operated by a homeschooling mom. Most of the black belts were <br/>
homeschooled - all but one of the instructors were homeschooled. She <br/>
runs &quot;homeschooler&quot; classes during the day for moms, dads, and kids of <br/>
all ages.<br/>
<br/>
The studio has an extra room and the homeschooled kids hang out there <br/>
during the day a lot - playing games, chatting. We also use the karate <br/>
studio for other get-togethers - my Destination Imagination team meets <br/>
there every week and there are a couple of Comedy Sportz teams meeting <br/>
there. The teens in our homeschool group used the karate studio for a <br/>
holiday party last Christmas.  I&#39;ve often thought that right next door <br/>
would be the ideal place to start up a learning resource center of some <br/>
sort. I just don&#39;t have a sense of how such a thing would make money - <br/>
maybe by being a homeschool supplies store, too?<br/>
