<div id="ygrps-yiv-765743472">Someone, I think Kelli, said she LOVED the ideas behind WTM, and <br/>
wants to go for it, herself, but that it isn&#39;t for her kids. May I <br/>
say, one of my favorite authors, Douglas Wilson, who runs a classical <br/>
college, and a day school with classic emphasis for younger students, <br/>
who is a strong believer in Classical Education...it was from his <br/>
writings that I got this: &quot;Classical isn&#39;t for everyone.&quot; (my <br/>
paraphrase)<br/>
<br/>
wow. Profound. LOL Just as, back in &quot;the day&quot; when education MEANT <br/>
training in Latin and Greek, as well as Logic and Rhetoric...back <br/>
in &quot;the day&quot; not everyone had that education. Some did. Those who <br/>
were suited for such an education, excelled in it. <br/>
<br/>
I read about these mothers whose children balk at their lessons, <br/>
whose &quot;doing school&quot; means abandoning life (which I&#39;ve been through <br/>
recently with K12), and I want to say &quot;What makes you think your <br/>
child is SUITED to such a course?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Mind you, I&#39;m going to introduce Latin and Greek to my kids...because <br/>
I bought a book about the roots of English, and I&#39;m going to read it <br/>
for myself (being a wordophile, and very interested in etymology) and <br/>
leave it available for my kids, and maybe even sit with them on the <br/>
couch and explore it together. If a spark ignites, well isn&#39;t that <br/>
COOL? We can be etymologists together! L <br/>
<br/>
But first, Robby wanted to study the planets, so we visited the <br/>
library and have been reading about them. He&#39;s already filled his <br/>
head with facts about the solar system, and was quizzing a kid at <br/>
church today. Katie wanted to make smiley face cupcakes, so we did.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know, that writing frosting/gel you can find in the baking <br/>
section of the grocery store, when you lay plastic wrap on it, it <br/>
lifts right off the frosting? L We had a lot of yellow cupcakes, some <br/>
WITH black smileys, and some WITHOUT. But it was fun and Katie did it <br/>
all herself. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward with great anticipation to TOMORROW.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi</div>

<br/>
The names of the planets would tie right in.  And then check out the names of <br/>
the weeks and the months, and compare other modern languages you might know <br/>
or be able to find out and see what THEIRs mean!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361920684">I gotta tell you something cool that happened last night! Katie, in <br/>
K12 History, had been studying Ancient Rome, and with it came <br/>
a &quot;busywork page&quot; about the names of the Greek Pantheon and the Roman <br/>
Pantheon. When Robby was leafing through some of the planet books, <br/>
all of a sudden he jumped up and got out Katie&#39;s three ring binder, <br/>
and turned to the busywork sheets about the pantheons...and started <br/>
comparing the planets&#39; names to the Greek Gods&#39; names. &quot;If we were <br/>
Greek, the second planet would be Aphrodite.&quot; LOL [a-fro-DIGHT]<br/>
<br/>
As for our dictionary, yeah...Webster&#39;s 1828, the first American <br/>
Dictionary of the English Language. And every word in it has detailed <br/>
background. I LOVE that dictionary. ABbie used to hate it, when <br/>
researching a topic by defining key words, was part of what she HAD <br/>
to do. Nowadays, she uses it when she wants to get a strong <br/>
definition for some subject. And that&#39;s a great idea, actually. Haul <br/>
out the resources we already have around the place, and look up some <br/>
planet names...after the kids get in from bike riding. But we also <br/>
have a birthday cake to bake.<br/>

I hope you don&#39;t make them look anything up, because I would feel terrible <br/>
about that.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I haven&#39;t shared for a while here, so maybe it&#39;s just time <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://SandraDodd.com/aradicalthought">http://SandraDodd.com/aradicalthought</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What you can do with your dictionary and encyclopedia...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A RADICAL THOUGHT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Never tell a child &quot;Go look it up.&quot; Parents, teachers, friends and <br/>
countrymen, how would you like it? <br/>
<br/>
When a child wants to know why flowers have a scent, they want someone to say <br/>
&quot;To attract bees&quot; not &quot;GO LOOK IT UP.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go look it up&quot; tends to mean &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I know but I&#39;m not going to <br/>
tell you.&quot; What&#39;s the advantage of that?<br/>
<br/>
Either a child will opt NOT to look it up (and the trust in the parent will <br/>
erode a little) or he will, under duress, perform this task which might be <br/>
difficult for him, or might take so long that he doesn&#39;t care anymore (and <br/>
the trust in the parent will erode a little).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT saying to discourage kids from looking things up. I never said not to <br/>
show kids how to look things up. I mean don&#39;t treat it like something parents <br/>
won&#39;t do, parents don&#39;t have to do, but that kids do, or that kids have to <br/>
do, because they are powerless kids.<br/>
<br/>
Encyclopedias should be alluring, not forbidding. Dictionaries should be a <br/>
playland, not a dark, scary place you dart into for one thing and slam shut <br/>
behind you. If you believe they ARE fun, you should look things up in front <br/>
of your children, often, and with enthusiasm. That will teach them how to use <br/>
reference materials, and will make them want to do so, because they will see <br/>
it as something useful and enjoyable that adults do. If you believe <br/>
dictionaries and encyclopedias ARE dark, scary and forbidding, why on EARTH <br/>
would you send your children there?<br/>
