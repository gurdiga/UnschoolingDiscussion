<div id="ygrps-yiv-26486146">Folks want to talk about interesting things we&#39;ve done lately.. That sounds <br/>
great to me ..<br/>
<br/>
Well, aside from obsessing over Sandras posts and not spending any time with <br/>
my children as Sandra so politely pointed out.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;Making a hobby of obsessing about what I post will take time away from <br/>
things you could be doing with your kids.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Which is just another prime example of insulting, accusing and judging.   <br/>
Folks  really prove themselves without me having to obsess over pointing it <br/>
out. <br/>
<br/>
OK..contrary to what some folks want to imply, my family had a wonderful day <br/>
together yesterday.   Dh and Ethan got up around 6am to go meet BIL to go to <br/>
this house on the lake that my SIL boss GAVE them.. YEAH.. she works for a <br/>
couple of doctors ( husband and wife) and they bought a house on the lake <br/>
that they decided they didnt want.. They were going to just have it <br/>
demolished and rebuild on the lot, but  they &quot;gave&quot; the house to my  b and <br/>
sil... They couldnt move it.. it was partially underground.. but they have <br/>
been taking every possible item/material out of it that they can.. They <br/>
offered us to come get anything we wanted too.   We figured this was an older <br/>
ranch style home with little salvagable.. But, OH NO. it was  HUGE, <br/>
immacualte, stucco home with top of the line fixtures and construction.   It <br/>
is just blowing our mind that folks are going to TEAR DOWN a perfectly good, <br/>
actually wonderful home.  This home would probably sell for over 200K!! <br/>
Anyway, we&#39;ve been so fortunate to get out light fixtures, garage doors, <br/>
molding, sinks, vanities, mirrors. ceiling fans..ect.  What I REALLY want is <br/>
the outdoor jacuzzi spa!!. But, its in the ground and we dont ahve the <br/>
equipment to dig it up and move it.   These folks also had a huge garden tub <br/>
whirlpool in thier house.  Its so big, we dont have anywhere in our house to <br/>
put it.   OK.. so.. ( I know, a bit of background there.. lol) Dh and Ethan <br/>
went back to the house yesterday to get some more goodies.  Ethan ws SOO <br/>
excited to be going with Daddy to be helping out.    Anna was spending the <br/>
night with my folks.  Me, JP and Landon all slept late.   Well, I got up <br/>
before the boys and did my post obsessing while they were still asleep.   <br/>
When JP got up, he wanted to play XBOX.   That posed a problem, which I would <br/>
appreciate some feedback/suggestions on.   Ethan got mad at his game the day <br/>
before, he often loses his temper in frustration.. He threw the controller <br/>
down and broke it.   So, whats the natural consequnce to that?  I told Ethan <br/>
he would ahve to buy another controller .. That seems appropiate to me.  But <br/>
in the mean time, what about the rest of the family??? Now JP ( or anyone <br/>
else for that matter) cant play XBOX either.   I really dont have the $30 to <br/>
buy another controller.. If I DO scrape up the $$, then what? dont let Ethan <br/>
play with it til he buys another one?  Or should I make everyone suffer til <br/>
Ethan comes up with the $$ to buy a new one.???  Of course JP was upset that <br/>
the controller was broken and he threw a fit of his own.  Screaming and <br/>
kicking and generally being enraged because the controller was broken.  I <br/>
finally got him calmed down and told him we would go buy groceries and go get <br/>
some lunch.   Landon got up and he wanted to go with us.. He was washing his <br/>
clothes, so we waited on him to finish his laundry.   JP and I played Army <br/>
men and Nintendo while Landons clothes dried.  Landon washed the dishes and <br/>
cleaned the kitchen.  I folded some laundry that Landon brought up out of the <br/>
dryer.  I picked up some toys off the landing at the top of our stairs.  JP <br/>
rode his bike.  I called Anna and checked in with her to see what she was <br/>
going to do.  My Mom was going up to my Grandparents ( I could interject <br/>
another long background story here.. but I wont. :-) )  She said she could <br/>
drop Anna off on her way, or Anna could stay with Grandpa.  I told her we <br/>
were getting ready to leave, but either way was fine with me, whatever Anna <br/>
wanted to do.   Just as we were leaving, Dh and Ethan got home from their <br/>
adventure.  Ethan was so excited to show me all the stuff they got ( GREAT <br/>
stuff too)   Then, Landon, JP and I left to run our errands.   We decided to <br/>
eat at Pizza Hut... Landon kicked in $5 because he has more $$ than I do.. <br/>
LOL.  My budget was more like Taco Bell, but they really wanted Pizza Hut, so <br/>
Landon offered to help pay..  The pizza was great, after dinner we went over <br/>
to Big Lots to let JP spend a couple of dollars.  JP wanted a Harry Potter <br/>
play set that was $12.. I couldnt swing it.. He threw another tantrum in the <br/>
store.  I told him he could chose something else, or we would have to leave. <br/>
After much persuasion, he chose a micro machine set that was $3.. That was <br/>
within my budget, so we were both happy and we made the purchase.   Then onto <br/>
the grocery store.  We got our groceries and headed on home.. I stopped at <br/>
the video store and we got a DVD to watch that night.   We got home @ 4.. And <br/>
JP had a wonderful surprise!! ( another background fill in)<br/>
 I had bought him a viewmaster projector for Christmas and he only had 6 <br/>
reels to look at.  I had joined a Viewmaster group on yahoo and posted a note <br/>
that i was looking for a good source for VM reels for my 7yo.  A wondeful <br/>
fella emailed me and offered to send JP some duplicate reels that he had on <br/>
hand.  I  accepted graciously and offered to pay him for them.. He said.  no <br/>
no. they are just collecting dust, Ill be glad to give them to him.. I asked <br/>
him to address the package to Jon Phillip because I knew he would love to get <br/>
some mail  So.. when we got home the package was there.  I hadnt told JP <br/>
about the reels.  I expected there to be a dozen or so reels.. The fella has <br/>
sent close to 100!.. ALL kinds.. cartoons, history, places and people, <br/>
EVERYTHING.. I was so ecstatic.. And was JP. He was thrilled..  I was so <br/>
touched by the kindness and generosity of this &quot;stranger&quot;  JP is going to <br/>
write him a thank  you note and mail it.  I am constantly inspired by the <br/>
genuine goodness of folks.  That was really the highlight of our day.  We <br/>
didnt get a chance to look at the reels, as JP only has the projector and we <br/>
didnt get it out last night.  I am getting him a regular viewer VM ASAP.  <br/>
Another VM enthusiast has the older black models for sale for $2.00 each.. <br/>
Thats next on my list for Paypal.. :-)  After the view master excitement,   I <br/>
called Anna and told her that we were thinking about going to the matinee at <br/>
4:30 to see TT.  I knew she really wanted to see it.  She said that Grandma <br/>
had already left and that she was going to spend the night with my sister ( <br/>
who lives next door to my folks) and babysit my nieces.  I offered to come <br/>
get her, but she said it was OK.. we would go see the movie again later.   <br/>
So, we loaded up and headed to the theater.  This was Landons 3rd time seeing <br/>
the movie!  First time for the rest of us.  We throughly enjoyed it.   When <br/>
it was over.. JP said.. &quot;that wasnt what I was expecting, it didnt seem like <br/>
3 hours to me&quot;  I think he expected to get sleepy and bored.. lol.. but he <br/>
didnt, he watched the whole movie intently . Well, with the aid of some candy <br/>
and drink...lol.  After the movie, we came home and made ourselves some <br/>
supper.  Landon made a frozen pizza for himself and JP  Ethan, Dh and I ate a <br/>
rotisseire cooked pork loin that I bought on sale at the grocery store.... Dh <br/>
had to go to the hardware store to get some more propane for our heater.  I <br/>
got back online to do some more obsessing.   When Dh got back, I made some <br/>
ginger bread cookies ( refrigerated dough, not homemade.. lol)  We had <br/>
coffee, milk and cookies and put the DVD in.. It was Snatch, and Landon had <br/>
heard it was really good.  The little boys were playing Mario Kart <br/>
contendedtly , til we put the movie in, ( of course)  We werent sure if the <br/>
content was appropiate for them, so we kept delaying and delaying starting <br/>
the movie til they occupied with playing again.. FINALLY, they wandered out <br/>
and started playing again.. And I watched Snatch while Dh worked on a bike ( <br/>
he collects and restores vintage bikes) and Landon chatted online with his <br/>
buds ( our PC is in our bedroom, as is our DVD player).. The movie was GREAT. <br/>
I LOVE LOVE Beniccio Del Toro.. :-)    The movie was actually fine for the <br/>
boys to watch.  A lot of the F word, a lot of shooting and killing,  a few <br/>
glimpses topless women.. but all in all, nothing theyve not seen before.   I <br/>
mostly dont want them to see explicit sexual content or anything too <br/>
&quot;scary&quot;.. Sometime yesterday, they watched a bit of &quot;Freddy Krueger&quot; on TV <br/>
and neither of them could go to sleep. ( or take a shower, or go downstairs <br/>
by themselves)  JP slept with us last nigh because of Freddy.. After Landon <br/>
finally got offline around midnight.. I got on and did some more obsessing..  <br/>
G ( my husbands name is Gralyn, and I call him G on all my other groups.. so, <br/>
Dh is harder for me to use.. So, I&#39;ll just use G) Anyway, G finished working <br/>
on his bike, then we went to bed.  Its 11:00 now, I got up around 10 (started <br/>
obsessing)  G is gone to church( he plays the organ)   JP  is watching TV in <br/>
bed,Landon is still in bed and Ethan is playing Nintendo.. G is going back to <br/>
&quot;the house&quot; today after lunch and I think we are all going today.. We have to <br/>
borrow my Dads truck to get some more stuff.  We will pick Anna up when we <br/>
get the truck.. JP is really excited about going the &quot;the house&quot; today.    I <br/>
need to get downstairs and get some lunch ready.   OH.. JP just threw <br/>
something down the stairs.. !!<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re going to insult me, at least get it right.<br/>
You could read more carefully, or you could just stop reading my posts.  <br/>
Either would be better than glossing over, making up whatever you want, and <br/>

<br/>

in the mean time, what about the rest of the family???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When that has happened here (twice) I bought another controller and earned <br/>
$30 worth of reminding them to find something else to do if they got angry.<br/>
<br/>
Making people wait for a kid to earn $30 just adds to the anger in the house, <br/>
and adds to frustration.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s productive, and my kids are <br/>
REALLY good with their stuff overall.  They still have every piece of Lego <br/>
they ever owned, and we have operational gaming systems back to original <br/>
Nintendo, with more than one controller operational for all systems, and some <br/>
have four.  Some were bought by kids, some by us, some were gifts...  but <br/>
they DO take care of things and so one or two little rages when they were <br/>
little are a tiny percentage of the gaming experience.<br/>
<br/>
$30 is only about a third of the cost of a trip to a child psychologist, less <br/>
than a visit to an emergency room.  Most people don&#39;t consider remotes even <br/>
nearly as important, but if you consider it peace, safety and mental health, <br/>
maybe it&#39;s a cheap $30.<br/>

<br/>
I have no idea how much time you spend with your kids.  Probably LOTS.  But <br/>
any moment you spend harrassing me and this list could be better spent with <br/>
your children.  That is my point.  <br/>
<br/>
Choosing to do something useful with your time, like discussing unschooling, <br/>
seems good and productive.<br/>
<br/>
Choosing to spend your energy bugging ME does not seem good or productive.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re new to unschooling.  Read about it and ask good questions about it and <br/>
stop picking on me.<br/>

I read your post with interest, bc I struggle with the issue of when to buy things for my kids with my money and when to have them use their own money.<br/>
<br/>
However, you (as in you and your kids) did decide to spend money that day on purchasing a pizza and some toys.  That money could have been used towards a new controller.  Just a thought.<br/>

new controller.  Although the broken controller was not from frustration from <br/>
the game but by accident.    <br/>
<br/>
In your situation I would buy the new controller and if I didn&#39;t have the <br/>
money we would sit down and decide how important it is.  Do we want to wait <br/>
until mom and dad have the extra money for the controller or, because it is a <br/>
game the family uses, do we all want to pitch in what we can to get a new one <br/>
sooner?  <br/>
<br/>
I would probably talk with my son about why he lost his temper and maybe <br/>
brainstorm about other ways to handle the situation without breaking <br/>
anything.  etc. etc.    <br/>
<br/>
I know I have broken things before by accident and because of frustration and <br/>
I have gone out and replaced the item with family money.  I say family money <br/>
because I do not hold a paying job.  My husband brings money into the <br/>
household.  My husband has also broken things.  I would not think about <br/>
&quot;punishing&quot; him or myself and so I do not punish my children either.  <br/>
Although you were probably not thinking that way.  <br/>
<br/>
I would just remind him, when things look heated, about what happened.  <br/>
<br/>
Not sure my thoughts came out clear written down.  LOL.<br/>

Be his partner in life rather than his trainer, so to speak. Help him figure<br/>
out what he can do next time. Help him learn to recognize the signs that his<br/>
temper is building. He probably isn&#39;t aware of it. And it will probably take<br/>
time.<br/>

But then I remember the way that *I* feel when I do something like what your <br/>
son did. (And I still do sometimes, get frustrated and yell at the poor sap <br/>
sitting nearest who breathed too loudly.) I feel embarrassed and a little <br/>
ashamed, sometimes I sulk for a while, and eventually learn that I made a <br/>
mistake and vow to not do it again. I may really internalize enough to purge <br/>
the behavior, or I may &quot;act out&quot; again.<br/>
Either way, I learn. And nobody has to &quot;teach me the consequenses of my <br/>
behavior&quot;. I learn from everyone around me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just  a slightly different take.<br/>
<br/>
When I break something, it does cost me to replace it. <br/>
Sometimes I get bailed out (the credit card or store is actually <br/>
able to reimburse my failure--as in purchase insurance) and <br/>
sometimes I have to pay for it myself.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can let your son know that this time, his &quot;parental <br/>
insurance&quot; is able to bail him out. But also share with him that if <br/>
it happens again, you may not be able to and it might fall to him <br/>
to fix the problem, ie find a way to pay for it.<br/>
<br/>
In this way you give him a vision of what it means to become <br/>
more and more personally accountable. I know as a kid, I never <br/>
had to pay for any damaged goods. Any time anything was <br/>
broken in our family, my dad immediately replaced the item so <br/>
no one would be &quot;out&quot;--discomfort was avoided at all costs. I <br/>
nearly totaled my brand new car three months after learning to <br/>
drive and then went on to get in accidents four more times before <br/>
I was independent as an adult (paying for my life). I became a <br/>
better driver when I saw my insurance go up from those <br/>
accidents, let me tell you. I also regret that my impulse now is <br/>
still to hope to be bailed out. And I also now realize the cost of my <br/>
carelessness.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it can be very healthy for kids to feel the impact of their <br/>
wekanesses in both their consciences and their wallets... just <br/>
like we do.<br/>

The natural consequences are already playing out I am sure.  Not being<br/>

his siblings being unhappy with him, and the conversations you have<br/>
had with him about anger etc.  I might ask that he contribute whatever<br/>

money could be saved to purchase the new one (ie. not going renting<br/>

We did talk about getting so angry, how to avoid breaking things, etc.... but no lecture.  I told him what a bummer it was and that he would have to spend his money to replace it.  He said &quot;Sure, I know.  I won&#39;t do that again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We shall see, but my bet is that he will be more careful in the future.  Dad did make a special trip to Walmart just to get the new controller (he was upset too that they couldn&#39;t play against each other any more) so he only did without for a few hours.  Ds luckily had some Christmas money left over and was able to replace it and get another memory card for about $15.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-382703983">&lt;&lt;   I  think there does need to be some kind of consequence for Ethan&#39;s <br/>
actions.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There have already been consequences.  His brother threw a fit, he was <br/>
embarrassed (maybe ashamed, likely remorseful), they  haven&#39;t been able to <br/>
play...<br/>
Natural consequences aren&#39;t decided by parents.  They happen on their own.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I feel like if I go right out and buy a new controller and let him use it.. <br/>
then he wont have any reason to try to curb his temper the next time he feels <br/>
like throwing the controller down. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t buy one, he will never have an opportunity to show that he can <br/>
curb his temper better now.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra on this one and i&#39;ve been doing some thinking about this.<br/>
<br/>
I think what others are trying to say is that you don&#39;t necessarily need a &quot;consequence&quot; for him to learn better ways of handling his anger.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is for him to handle anger better, then give him som practical suggestions and let him practice them in a role play situation.<br/>
<br/>
Making him pay for the controller just gives him something else to be angry about. I do understand the logic of it because initially I thought the same thing when I read your post...there should be a consequence.  But Sandra is right...the natural consequences have already taken place to the extent that the affect him and not the rest of the family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d spend some time giving him some ideas to handle things better, then go out together and get a new one and let him know that you think he is better prepared this time.<br/>

<h4>Jon and Rue Kream</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-258190456">Teresa says: But, I still am <br/>
at a loss for what ( if any) consequence is natural for breaking the <br/>
controller out of anger.<br/>
<br/>
Rue:  The thing about natural consequences is that you don&#39;t need to<br/>
figure out what they are, or make sure they happen - they are the<br/>
consequences that happen naturally :0).  So what were they this time?<br/>
Maybe right after he did it he felt embarrassed or mad at himself.<br/>
Maybe his brother or sister got annoyed with him.  Maybe you got annoyed<br/>
with him.  Maybe you&#39;ll never know, and I think that&#39;s ok.  <br/>
 <br/>
Personally I&#39;d tell the kids that as soon as we could afford it I&#39;d<br/>
replace it, and then I would.  Everyone loses their temper sometimes.<br/>
