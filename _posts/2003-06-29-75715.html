<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025857969">Do we unschool sex education?<br/>
<br/>
Well, here&#39;s the deal.I think unschooling is supporting one another in <br/>
learning through passion and relationship. So we talk to one another all the time. I <br/>
initiate conversations about all kinds of things, as does Julian. Sex and <br/>
development are some of those things. Do I always wait for a spark of interest <br/>
before initiating a conversation? Nope. Do I force stuff on Julian he has no <br/>
interest in? Also nope, but I have to tell you that something that interests or <br/>
matters to the conversation initiator is unlikely to totally disinterest the <br/>
initiatee. (Yes, I am pretty sure that&#39;s not a word.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve talked to many adults who remember being unprepared for the changes <br/>
their bodies make in puberty. Most girls are at least warned about menstruation, <br/>
but apparently lots of boys aren&#39;t about wet dreams, and are scared that <br/>
they&#39;ve started wetting the bed, that they have cancer, etc. I wanted Julian never <br/>
to have to be afraid of that, and long before it was an issue we talked about <br/>
it. When it finally happened, he knew immediately what it was, and told us.<br/>
<br/>
I also made sure there were good books about puberty, relationships, etc. <br/>
around. I handed them to Julian (not all at once) and said, &quot;You might be <br/>
interested.&quot; He&#39;d usually dash off and read them, rarely, but sometimes, asking <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
I am a great proponent of Car Sex Education. We have lots of conversations <br/>
about sex in the car driving places. Think about it. Uninterrupted time, and the <br/>
driver and kid are prevented from much eye-contact, which makes having a <br/>
casual conversation about a possibly embarassing subject much easier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never planned or carried out a structured sex education plan. Just like <br/>
we talk about spirituality, what form of matter smoke is, civil rights, <br/>
whether Klingon or Esperanto is a more useful or noble second language to learn (I <br/>
know, weird kid), we talk. Sexuality is about relationship, and so is learning <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
So...yeah. We unschool sexuality. That said, if we can figure out a way to <br/>
pull it off, our church denomination offers a fabulous sexuality program called <br/>
Our Whole Lives, and I would love to have Julian do it. Not that he can&#39;t <br/>
learn otherwise, and not that I would make him if he were disinterested, but <br/>
because it&#39;s such an amazing opportunity.<br/>
