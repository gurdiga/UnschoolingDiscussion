&lt;SNIP&gt; My daughter does not want to give up on this girl but she is truly<br/>
hurt.<br/>
Any suggestions?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
	That is a tough situation for Naomi! It is always hard when a close<br/>
friend seems to so easily write you off completely just because you do<br/>
something that is different than what they expect from you. Being<br/>
inclined to do things my own way, this has happened to me a few times. It<br/>
is always painful, but easier to handle each time.<br/>
	I would tell my dd that sometimes, people can&#39;t handle it when we do<br/>
something that serves our true selves, rather than going along with the<br/>
crowd. They probably feel it is some kind of threat, and it is really<br/>
about *them* and their inability to be open to individual<br/>
expressions--not about us. <br/>
	Naomi is obviously not going to &quot;win&quot; back this girl&#39;s friendship. The<br/>
girl&#39;s poem makes that pretty clear, as do her nasty comments. So, IMHO,<br/>
the best thing you can do for your dd is help her express her hurt and<br/>
loss in an appropriate manner. Perhaps she needs to punch pillows,<br/>
scream, write a poem in response (and not send it), do an angry dance, or<br/>
make a memorial to the good things about the now-dead friendship. When I<br/>
suffer a loss, it really helps me to write about it, just to myself, and<br/>
then to create something--usually artwork. Often, I am amazed at what<br/>
comes out.<br/>
	It is also very important that Naomi know that all of her feelings about<br/>
this, and toward the girl, are completely normal. She could be angry one<br/>
moment, and fearful the next. There might be grief, guilt or regret,<br/>
questioning herself and her worth, and many other emotions.<br/>
	I think it&#39;s instinctual for us to want to protect our children from<br/>
such hurtful events, but we can&#39;t possibly do that--especially throughout<br/>
their lives. The best we can do is help them understand human nature, and<br/>
help them learn what they need to do when faced with these situations.<br/>
That will help them safely negotiate  a lifetime of ups and downs. <br/>
	Best of luck!<br/>
<br/>
