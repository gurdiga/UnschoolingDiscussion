Any other Yugio lovers that are going to the SC conference?  I think Jared <br/>
especially loves them because of the really cool artwork.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what Kathryn has to say about it:<br/>
<br/>
Yu-Gi-Oh!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a cartoon show. Yugi is the name of the main character. The people who<br/>
made Pokemon made it. [Joyce adds: Yu-Gi-Oh! is a pun on the character&#39;s<br/>
name in Japan though I&#39;ve forgotten what the phrase means.]<br/>
<br/>
It has much cooler bad guys and more exciting plots.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of using monsters in balls, they play a Pokemon card game like game<br/>
with cards that have creatures on them that come to life.<br/>
<br/>
The characters duel with them in a game called &quot;Duel Monsters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You start off with 2000 life points and every time one of your duel monsters<br/>
loses all it&#39;s HP (hit points) you lose the amount of HP it had from your<br/>
life points. The first duelist down to 0 life points loses.<br/>
<br/>
Pegasus, the bad guy, stole Yugi&#39;s grandfather&#39;s soul in order to force Yugi<br/>
to give him the piece of the Millenium Puzzle that Yugi has. The completed<br/>
Millenium Puzzle will give the one who has it control over time. Pegasus<br/>
already has one piece: the Eye of Illusion. There are 7 pieces to the<br/>
puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s on Kids WB. It used to be on at 11 or 11:30 she thinks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926680499">How do you pay for this stuff?<br/>
<br/>
Those cards are freaking $5-6-8 here in NYC and, unfortunately, my 5 <br/>
year-old son (who likes to hang out with the big guys) wants them <br/>
desperately.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a Yugio underground market from where I can smuggle them to <br/>
the Big Apple?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330188255">Yeah,<br/>
<br/>
What I got from the cards it&#39;s that they are like Digimon, via <br/>
CardCaptors all harking back to Pokemon but really nodding to the <br/>
hard core Animé enthusiasts that are still school age.<br/>
<br/>
There is Animé out there that would shock many a US parent --the <br/>
Japanese go where a lot of US Comics writers dare not thread. And <br/>
there is way more that would kick DC Comics&#39; ass anytime. One of the <br/>
most successful animé writers is actually a woman. Rumiko Takahashi <br/>
is the creator of RANMA 1 1/2 and she is like a cross between Monty <br/>
Python, Stan Lee, Gary Trudeau, Cathy Guisewaite and Absolutely <br/>
Fabulous, all through the eyes of a Japanese woman. If you want a <br/>
hysterical take on gender politics, sexual identity and postmodern <br/>
Asian culture; YOU HAVE TO READ RANMA! There is also a TV series that <br/>
can be checked out on VHS and DVD.<br/>
<br/>
If you do a search under Anime or Animerica on Google ---you&#39;ll get <br/>
to some of the most hard-core pornographic cartoon sites that are out <br/>
there. There is a magazine called Animerica but, somehow, they have <br/>
not sued for their domain name (I&#39;ve never checked who owns that <br/>
domain).<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837788956">My daughter says that a pack of 50 (3 of them being foil) Yugio cards run<br/>
about $10 here.  This is the only type of pack she has purchased.  Is<br/>
this more or less than you are paying there?<br/>
