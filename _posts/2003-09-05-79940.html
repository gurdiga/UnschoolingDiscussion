We went through a really tough period where he couldn&#39;t play well with others <br/>
and basically had no friends.  All the other kids on the block made fun of <br/>
him and shunned him.  <br/>
We have worked really hard with him on recognizing his behaviors, evaluating <br/>
what he wants to gain from them and if that is the appropriate behavior <br/>
choice.  It hasn&#39;t been easy and it has been very intentional, not unschooling at <br/>
all, but he was in such misery that it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
The OT was prescribed for his sensory issues but we found it most helpful in <br/>
the skills it taught him to recognize what inputs his body needed and how to <br/>
seek them appropriately.  An example, when he was younger he had a real problem <br/>
with giving everyone ferocious hugs and running up and slamming his body into <br/>
people as a way to say hi.  Now a small 6 yo giving a ferocious hug to an <br/>
adult was not much of a problem but to his peers it appeared to be very <br/>
aggressive behavior and a lot of them were scared of him.  What the OT did was teach <br/>
him to label that need, it is for deep pressure and it is a way the nervous <br/>
system is seeking to organize itself.  It is a real physical need that he felt but <br/>
she taught him other ways to meet that need.  One of the best ways was <br/>
bouncing full body flat on a trampoline.  We learned ways to help him with it also, <br/>
I would physically lie on top of him with most of my weight.  Believe it or <br/>
not it was just what he needed.  Now he knows to do isometric exercises and jump <br/>
on his pogo stick and various other ways to get that need met, ways that are <br/>
more socially acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
As he learned how to regulate his own stress, he learned to be more <br/>
empathetic to others.  His mind used to be too full of its own noise and needs.  As he <br/>
grew more empathetic he was able to learn social skills that had eluded him <br/>
and he began to develop friends.  He is now sought after by the other boys in <br/>
the neighborhood, but he still has trouble playing with more than one person for <br/>
any length of time.  Luckily he has learned to know that and recognize and <br/>
claim that so he just tells his friends that he wants to do his own stuff before <br/>
a crisis occurs.<br/>
<br/>
Other things we did to help him learn mastery of his body was to do tap dance <br/>
for several years, Tae Kwon Do, gymnastics and now ballroom dancing.  He <br/>
really enjoys the ball room dancing most of all.  I think it appeals to his <br/>
budding interest in the opposite gender.  He told me, half in horror and half in <br/>
wonder, &quot;They want you to touch the girls in dancing.&quot;  He is such a sweet <br/>
innocent some times.<br/>
<br/>
He is very philosophical about his tics.  He basically feels that if people <br/>
don&#39;t like him because of his tics, they probably weren&#39;t people he wanted to <br/>
be friends with anyway.  In public we have developed a code of sorts so that I <br/>
can alert him if he is ticing a lot and he can choose how to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
The Depakote(seizure meds) have stopped some of the larger tics, but he has a <br/>
lot of smaller ones.  We don&#39;t even notice most of them anymore.<br/>
<br/>
One piece of information that was very helpful to me in learning about TS was <br/>
that it is a spectrum disorder and on that same spectrum is ADHD and <br/>
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, as well as Sensory Integration Dysfunction.  So it can <br/>
be hard to pin symptoms down exactly.  Sometimes we think Douglass is OCD, he <br/>
has very compulsive relationships with food textures, but that could also be <br/>
Sensory stuff, etc.  Labels don&#39;t always help except to lead you to new <br/>
information.  <br/>
<br/>
We have found that giving Douglass the skills to master his own physical <br/>
needs helped so much and he has become so calm and accepting of himself that none <br/>
of us think if him as having any disorders at all.  He is just Douglass and we <br/>
love him that way.  Luckily without school pressures we can live this way.<br/>
<br/>

to say.  It&#39;s very helpful.  This is all so new and we&#39;re just trying <br/>
find our way around.<br/>
<br/>
The OCD, ADHD, inappropriate touching and other things associated <br/>
with TS are what make it hard.  People can understand tics and be <br/>
sympathetic but the other stuff is hard to take.  <br/>
<br/>
Abba does the hugging but also gets in peoples faces a lot- she <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to have an idea of personal space.  That puts a lot of <br/>
people off.  Her OCD manifsts itself in cool baths without soap <br/>
(thank goodness) and lipgloss.  No one understands why I let my 9 yo <br/>
go around with her lips painted.  They&#39;re sure it&#39;s part of my <br/>
radical lifestyle. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763147485">Do you think any of the TS stuff could be related to food allergies?  The<br/>
reason I ask is because my son, Connor has severe food allergies.  Before we<br/>
found this out, he had tics all the time, he was angry, nobody could touch<br/>
him without him coming unglued.  Now that he doesn&#39;t eat the allergic foods,<br/>
all this has gone away.  Oh, once in a while, he gets his mouth tic back<br/>
because I&#39;ve not done a good job with his rotation diet.  But other than<br/>
that, he feels so much better.  I don&#39;t know if what I described is TS or<br/>
not.<br/>
