<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100788921">Dan Vilter is doing a presentation at the HSC conference in Sacramento this <br/>
coming weekend trying to help other families loosen up about television, and <br/>
see the merits of watching TV with kids, and some things to be learned from TV.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not on this list, but I want to help him collect some good recent <br/>
examples--recent like last week if possible.   It&#39;s rough, being still summer and <br/>
re-runs, but if anyone has a good TV experience from the past few days, would <br/>
you please consider posting it here?<br/>
<br/>
Not only could it help Dan help lots of other families, maybe some of the <br/>
readers here are still undecided about TV.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660000844">This is probably not the sort of example he&#39;ll want to use, but my<br/>
11-year-old son has learned an incredible number of cultural references from<br/>
The Simpsons and Family Guy. The writers of those shows throw in history and<br/>
current events and classic movies and books and so much more. Because he<br/>
loves these shows, he wants to understand everything, so what he doesn&#39;t get<br/>
he asks us to explain. It keeps happening in conversations with other people<br/>
and in reading things in the newspaper that I&#39;ll try to explain context to<br/>
him only to discover that he knows exactly what&#39;s being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Now Family Guy, especially, is also crude and sometimes downright<br/>
&quot;inappropriate for children,&quot; so I&#39;m not recommending that everyone go out<br/>
and buy the DVD. It is also hysterical, and I&#39;ve made peace with Alex&#39;s love<br/>
for it (my husband and I love it too -- can you tell?).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>not sure if this is what you are after, but the other night ds 7.9 and i were <br/>
watching Martha Stewart(sp?) and she did a show on seafood. It included a <br/>
spot on a company that buys fish from a large market. we talked about auctions <br/>
and bidding, she talked to a woman lobster fisher; ds wanted to look for the <br/>
book she wrote. Martha cooked some live lobsters, ds was indignant that they <br/>
would suffer so, Martha said they did not feel it, we both talked about how it was <br/>
still cruel.He spent some time thinking of ways to humanely kill the <br/>
lobsters. We thought of cool crafts he would like to do  inspired by thid show. all <br/>
spent cuddling together. We live far from the ocean but ended feeling like we <br/>
had been there. <br/>
<br/>
lots of dialogue since then.<br/>
Sorry about the poor quality of typing, one hand still. Glad Martha was there <br/>
to help me out&lt;G&gt;<br/>
