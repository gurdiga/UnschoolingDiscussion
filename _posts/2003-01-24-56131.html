<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085138212">I just wanted to alert everyone that I seem to have a virus. My virus scan has quarantined this but I keep getting messages that I supposedly sent people with the &quot;could not send message&quot; or user does not accept attachments.<br/>
<br/>
In any case - to be safe please don&#39;t open mail from my address - I assume these messages must have an attachment to them - just don&#39;t  want to infect anyone!<br/>
