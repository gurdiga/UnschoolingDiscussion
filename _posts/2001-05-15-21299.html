&lt;&lt; From these two disparate experiences, we have both come to the conclusion<br/>
 that our schooling did not serve us well, did not teach us the lessons we<br/>
 truly needed to know, and was a monumental waste of time and energy, not to<br/>
 mention emotionally and mentally crippling. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
   This is why I am so afraid for my dd to go to school even for a short <br/>
period of time. How do you convince a 5 year old of this w/ out <br/>
&quot;brainwashing&quot; her or laying down the &quot;there will be NO school&quot; law. I always <br/>
said I would let her go if she wanted to but who woulda thought a kid would <br/>
want to go to school?<br/>
<br/>
   Big problem here? Everyone goes to school starting at about 2! The hs <br/>
group is mostly older kids and or very religious and my dd has heard some <br/>
things I do not wisjh her to hear. Nor do the other parents want their <br/>
children hearing what my dd may have to say at times. I could tell the <br/>
stories but it would get really lengthy them. Lets just say I was shocked by <br/>
a child&#39;s words and a parents.<br/>
