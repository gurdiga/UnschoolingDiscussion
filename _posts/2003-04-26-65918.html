<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We&#39;re planning to bring the kids with us - they are 11, 9, and 6.  I&#39;d like<br/>
&gt; them to meet other unschooling kids and have some fun!  The storytelling<br/>
&gt; picnic sounds great as do the descriptions of the funshops from last year.<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re planning on turning it into a little family vacation - since we have a<br/>
&gt; 14 hour drive to get there.<br/>

But I bet I&#39;m coming the most distance!  Unless one of our down-under<br/>
unschoolers shows up!<br/>
