Editorial Reviews<br/>
Book Description<br/>
No phrase in American letters has had a more profound influence<br/>
on church-state law, policy, and discourse than Thomas<br/>
Jefferson&#39;s &quot;wall of separation between church and state,&quot; and<br/>
few metaphors have provoked more passionate debate. Introduced in<br/>
an 1802 letter to the Danbury, Connecticut Baptist Association,<br/>
Jefferson&#39;s &quot;wall&quot; is accepted by many Americans as a concise<br/>
description of the U.S. Constitution&#39;s church-state arrangement<br/>
and conceived as a virtual rule of constitutional law.<br/>
Despite the enormous influence of the &quot;wall&quot; metaphor, almost no<br/>
scholarship has investigated the text of the Danbury letter, the<br/>
context in which it was written, or Jefferson&#39;s understanding of<br/>
his famous phrase. Thomas Jefferson and the Wall of Separation<br/>
Between Church and State offers an in-depth examination of the<br/>
origins, controversial uses, and competing interpretations of<br/>
this powerful metaphor in law and public policy.<br/>

| &gt;<br/>
| &gt; You&#39;re probably right in general that they need to be<br/>
privately funded in<br/>
| &gt; order to work, but it&#39;s these absolute statements that keep<br/>
putting me<br/>

| Ned answers:<br/>
|<br/>
| It was Thomas Jefferson who wrote that forcing people to pay<br/>
for things that<br/>
| violate their beliefs [like state-funded churches} is tyranny.<br/>
(sorry, I<br/>
| can&#39;t locate the exact quote)<br/>
|<br/>
| It&#39;s a reasonable objection -- and many people have it -- that<br/>
forcing<br/>
| people to pay for (or accept) things that go against their<br/>
beliefs or best<br/>
| judgment is bad government. Public schools do that to almost<br/>
everyone. If<br/>
| there&#39;s public funding for a private school whose program goes<br/>
against the<br/>
| wishes of many people, then the funding is a form of tyranny --<br/>
strictly<br/>
| speaking -- because many people are forced to pay for it who<br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it<br/>
| voluntarily.  Public schools do that to almost everyone.<br/>
|<br/>
| Thirty years ago, I was involved with a group that wanted the<br/>
local public<br/>
| school system to fund our new, innovative private school. (This<br/>
was in<br/>
| Aspen, Colorado and I was even on the city council) Our<br/>
proposal was not<br/>
| accepted and the families (most of whom were wealthy) had to<br/>
pay for their<br/>
| own children&#39;s schooling all by themselves, or with private<br/>
help. That was<br/>
| (is) how it should be.<br/>
|<br/>
| Since I&#39;ve come to what I jokingly call my senses, politically,<br/>
and am a<br/>
| libertarian, I have been ashamed of being in a group asking the<br/>
government<br/>
| (taxpayers) to fund a private activity. Not the least of what&#39;s<br/>
wrong with<br/>
| it is the fact that the government will always want to control<br/>
it, and if<br/>
| it&#39;s a school, that means *make it like its other schools --<br/>
rotten.*<br/>
