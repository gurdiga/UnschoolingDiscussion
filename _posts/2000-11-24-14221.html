me to pounce on you!  We are planning more children, but have one for now, a<br/>
three year old boy.  We may not have more children for a while, and i<br/>
wondered if you could share a little about HS/US with larger age ranges.<br/>
Thank you so much, and welcome to the list!&lt;<br/>

Hi cath,<br/>
Well I guess I never really gave the age spread much thought.. it&#39;s just how<br/>
our family turned out and wasn&#39;t planned at all. My oldest is very busy now<br/>
with gym, piano and a part time job so is not at home that much. The two<br/>
younger ones get along very well, lots of creative time together, shared art<br/>
projects, play, etc.  It seems the oldest one usually starts a project and<br/>
then the younger joins in to the best of her ability. We read together<br/>
allot. I read out-loud for an hour or two everyday to both of the girls.<br/>
Not sure what you are wanting to know exactly.. feel free to ask again.. I<br/>
don&#39;t feel &#39;pounced on&#39; at all..LOL..<br/>

I have 3 kids with my husband 7, 4 & 2 and he has 2 kids 18 & 16.  His kids<br/>
lived with their mother & visited us every other weekend plus 2 evenings a<br/>
week.  A year ago his dd moved in with us and now a month ago his son moved<br/>
in.  So we have acquired the age range 2 to 18.  There are times with the<br/>
wide range gets in the way but over all we&#39;ve had few problems.  You take<br/>
what God gives you & grow from there.</div>
