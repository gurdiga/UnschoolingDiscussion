<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343155148">Ok, so we are very new to unschooling.&nbsp; I heard an awesome man (I believe he is the young man who coined Uncollege) on National Radio 3 years ago and thought &quot;That sounds amazing but not for us&quot;.&nbsp; After 3 more years of school (I have 10, 8, and 5 year old boys) we decided to home school at the end of the last term.&nbsp; We are in New Zealand so that was Dec 18 and school goes back after summer break this week.&nbsp; I originally thought to use New Zealand&#39;s Correspondence School (aka Te Kura) which has a very good reputation, but while we were waiting to enroll I checked out all the books on home schooling from our lovely local library and lo and behold Pam Laricchia&#39;s Free to Learn and Free to Live were in the pile and they sounded so right, refreshing and possible for us.&nbsp; <br><br>We spent the school holidays just enjoying our children without the stress of expectations and school.&nbsp; My children are very thankful to unschooling philosophy as it has loosened restrictions we had about screentime and opened my mind to observing joy and learning that is happening during it as opposed to seeing it as a waste of time.&nbsp; It is a big step for us, actually, as one of the main reasons for considering home education in the first place was because their school was requiring us to buy chromebooks for the older 2 boys and we didn&#39;t want to increase their exposure to screen (lol).&nbsp; So I have done a bit of a 180 here:).&nbsp; The Chromebook issue did allow us to see the way decisions are made from the top down at schools (as one of the primary reasons for implementing it was to make the teachers&#39; job easier?!?). I love the irony that I have the Chromebook situation to thank for helping change my perception of my kids on screen:)&nbsp; Still a work in progress I must admit as I have spent a lot of time thinking it was just a waste of time (not being naturally interested in video games myself).&nbsp; Now I see that devaluing something that brings them so much pleasure could actually be quite damaging and they actually learn a lot and get along great when they are on screen! <br><br>Here&#39;s the big BUT, I still have a hard time when we get to the say, 4 hour mark (we used to be 1/2 hour on weekdays 1 hour weekends with some wiggle room depending) I really get antsy and feel like a bad parent that I am not providing them with a rich and engaging environment.&nbsp; We live on 370 ha of gorgeous bush in NZ and while they get out and have a run around when I say, &quot;ok time for a break&quot; the length of time they are willing to spend outside is less and less.&nbsp; I am finding it really hard to let go and let my active children (back when we did the time limits on screen, while they complained some, they would usually find something to do outside that they sure as heck looked like they were enjoying).&nbsp; Now that the limits have come off (mostly) it seems to be their default activity.&nbsp; Is this rich, engaging and varied enough?&nbsp; <br><br>Here is where my original subject question comes in.&nbsp; My 8 yr old son is really interested in vikings so we did some online research, read some books etc and he was keen to role play.&nbsp; He is very physical so I suggested we spar with staffs (like viking children do).&nbsp; Then later in the day he was upset when he said no one had played with him all day. (We (the parents) had said to take a break from screen after 5+ hours on a gorgeous sunny day.)&nbsp; I pointed out our viking sparring from earlier in the day.&nbsp; While he seemed to enjoy it at the time, he said playing with me was boring:(!&nbsp; I am embarassed for being so sensitive but it made me concerned about my ability to engage and extend learning for my kids in an unschooling setting.&nbsp; I was one of those kids that liked school and enjoyed jumping through the hoops but I&#39;m starting to wonder if this has left me unable to play without pretending??<br><br>I think these may be unschooling growing pains?!?&nbsp; But I would appreciate feed back:) <br>Cheers,<br>Aroha<br><br><br><p><span><br class="ygrps-yiv-1343155148yui-cursor"></span></p></div>

<br/>
Language, language!<br/>
“On screen” means that they’re in a movie, or a TV show, or YouTube video perhaps, that the rest of us are watching.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/screentime.html">http://sandradodd.com/screentime.html</a><br/>
This is as important as anything you will ever learn about unschooling.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/screentime">http://sandradodd.com/screentime</a> has more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now that the limits have come off (mostly) it seems to be their default activity.  Is this rich, engaging and varied enough?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Recovery takes time.<br/>
They’re recovering from your limitations and pressure and criticism.<br/>
<br/>
Let them recover.  <br/>
<br/>
Read more about people who have grown up with choices and options about computers, TV, lots of things, and see if you find any of them who don’t have other interests, activities, hobbies, eventually jobs, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417476823">-=-(We (the parents) had said to take a break from screen after 5+ hours on a gorgeous sunny day.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps they felt you were taking them away from a gorgeous game/video/story to go out and look at the sky, which they’ve seen before.<br/>
Because you used to “make them” go outside that is NOT a desireable thing now.  You ruined it.  Don’t blame them.  Don’t glorify the weather.<br/>
Because you used to forbid the computers or whatever (I can’t see what it is, but stop saying “screens”), you made those things valuable.  Don’t blame the kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I pointed out our viking sparring from earlier in the day.  While he seemed to enjoy it at the time, he said playing with me was boring:(!  I am embarassed for being so sensitive but it made me concerned about my ability to engage and extend learning for my kids in an unschooling setting. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It will take practice, or maybe finding him more people to play with.  It doesn’t need to be someone his age or gender.  And made some boffer staves—don’t use wood.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Foam and duct tape on… depends what.  Dowel, or small PVC pipe, or… depends.  Look at those above, and maybe google “boffer staff” for more ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You can make things that are safe and fun.  They can be fun to make. Don’t expect your children to make the first few.  It’s too hard.  Maybe hire a teen or young adult to come over and make some he can see made (or YOU watch, if the child isn’t interested in watching).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-I was one of those kids that liked school and enjoyed jumping through the hoops but I&#39;m starting to wonder if this has left me unable to play without pretending??-=-<br/>
<br/>
Pretending to play?  Pretending to have fun?  Unable to pretend?<br/>
If you can’t play a certain thing (I’m not good with Barbies), find someone who to do that, and find what you CAN play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1530939444"><div dir="ltr">I had been debating posting a different but similar question on the Radical Unschoolers Facebook group, but since this came up here, I will post it here, because I think what I have seen so far will help Jen/(Aroha?). For clarity&#39;s sake, I have to start with some background. My wife and I moved in together in June of 2013. Along with her came her (now our) 12-year-old DD. I have some, but not all, information about what restrictions there were before they moved up here. Once we moved in together, there were not any restrictions of TV or Video Games, I don&#39;t think there were many if any before then. She was enrolled in the public schools here, and when she wasn&#39;t at school, she was grouchy, despondent, and spent all of her time with the TV or video games. But we both realized that she needed that to decompress from the time at school. The next year right after 8th grade started, we (collectively, she was included in the decision) pulled her out of school and started deschooling.<div><br></div><div>Then she spent even more time watching TV and playing Video Games. It took me a little while to realize that even without Us giving her limitations, she had still had limitations when she was in school. No more school, no more limitations. Binge on! But we understood she needed that too, and slowly, we watched our interactions change. Now (at 15) when she comes out of her room she talks to us; she carries on a conversation; she asks us how our day is going. Sometimes she stays a while, sometimes she doesn&#39;t.</div><div><br></div><div>Which finally leads to what I was going to ask / relate. Our DD has reached a point where she is tired of the TV and video games all the time. She is rewatching stuff for the sixth time because she is bored (her words not mine). I have read all of the pages on Sandra&#39;s site about boredom and strewing, and I am still at a loss for how to help. We live on a very tight budget right now. My wife and I both work from home, but I am available to her as long as I am not on the phone or out meeting with a client (I am self employed, so lots of leeway). She is sharing stuff with us more (mostly stuff she finds funny), and we have supported the few things we know she is interested in. She seems happy with what we have done, but I don&#39;t think it is varied enough for her. I know some of that is just being a teenager. I was starting to think I am boring to her, but she is staying with a family friend this week, and told that family friend that my wife and I are cool (Our teenage daughter, who has only known me for about 4 years, thinks I am cool. So awesome). So, am I overthinking this, should I just share more, or is there some realization that just hasn&#39;t hit me yet?</div><div><br></div><div>I think I worded everything the way I meant it this time, but if not, Sandra and others will find it and beat me over the head with it (not a complaint. I wouldn&#39;t post here if they were not so passionate about the clarity of the discussion. I learn more when I say something wrong, others learn more when I say something right. :-) ).</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1530939444gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1530939444gmail_quote">On Thu, Feb 4, 2016 at 6:37 AM, Bernadette Lynn <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:bernadette.lynn@...">bernadette.lynn@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1530939444gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

If she has options she hasn’t opted into yet, you’re not limiting her ability to look further. <br/>

Maybe watch with her, follow trails.<br/>
<br/>
Might new art supplies help?  (If she’s artsy…)<br/>

I hope others will have suggestions, but mostly I think don’t worry.  Keep things flowing, conversationally, informationally, smile a lot, provide varied foods, maybe play music she hasn’t heard that she might like…<br/>

We are on a limited income for now, so some/many/most of the things we have come up with aren&#39;t possible at the moment (example: she and I both would like to go to one of those places where you float over this giant fan, like you are in freefall when skydiving, but we don&#39;t have the money for that). On the other hand, if she is coming to me and telling me she is bored, I first have to help her figure out what form of stimulation she is needing (conversational, visual, etc.) and I am not quite sure how to do that without playing 20 questions, so we seem to be defaulting to me saying, &quot;do you want to X?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;How about Y?&quot; &quot;No&quot; And eventually she wanders back to her room and finds something to do on her own.</div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-921277966gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div><div><div><p>-=-Might new art supplies help?  (If she’s artsy…)-=-<br></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>She asked for painting supplies for Christmas. We got her an easel, nice paints, some small canvases, brushes, etc. and she was delighted. She painted her mom a nice design on one of the canvases, and as far as I know she hasn&#39;t used them since that. Which I understand. I got a cool little programmable circuit board a year ago. I played with it for one day and it has been sitting on my desk since then. Not because I don&#39;t like it, I just haven&#39;t been in the mood or mindspace to do anything with it. I think part of it is just a lack of variety. She is learning french on duolingo (I am going to learn too, so she has someone to talk to until she is comfortable finding other people to talk with). She has a new camera, but she doesn&#39;t want to go out in the cold. Talking with her, it feels to me like she feels stuck (in a rut?) and just can&#39;t figure out what she wants to do.</div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-921277966gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div><div><div><p>

It feels like this enormous, beautiful, but complex, system (then again, everything looks that way to me), because it is life, and that is how I see life. I don&#39;t always know what I want to do at any given time. Helping someone else figure out what they want to do is daunting. I wonder if there is an expectation problem, or the perception of an expectation problem (on either side). I don&#39;t think we are expecting her to do anything in particular, but I don&#39;t really know what she is expecting for/of herself, or what she believes we are expecting of her.

&nbsp;I stopped what I was doing and turned my whole body in his direction so that he knew he had my full attention, and waited. &nbsp;He told me he was a bit tired of the game he&#39;d been playing, and he didn&#39;t know what he wanted to do next. &nbsp;I was kind of relieved, actually, because I had no idea what his problem was going to be. &nbsp;He&#39;s thirteen.</span><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">We moved just over six months ago. &nbsp;We moved across the country (US), leaving our friends and everything familiar to Ethan. &nbsp;Playing games and Skyping with friends was a good transition for him, but I can tell he&#39;s ready to explore our new home and all the things it has to offer. &nbsp;Yet, he doesn&#39;t quite know where to begin. &nbsp;Even before we moved, I could tell he was beginning a transition of some kind.</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">Anyway, after he told me what was going on with him, I nodded and said, &quot;Okay.&quot; &nbsp;Then I got up and followed him. &nbsp;He walked over to the sofa, where he put on the television. &nbsp;We sat side by side for a while, watching. &nbsp;It was a show we&#39;d seen before, but that was okay. &nbsp;He put his head on my shoulder. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">As we watched, I looked around the room for something interesting that he hadn&#39;t explored in a while. &nbsp;I found something, went over and pulled it down. &nbsp;On the floor in front of the television, I began building. &nbsp;His face lit up and he joined me. &nbsp;We played like that for about an hour--watching and building and chatting about whatever came up. &nbsp;I could tell, when he walked away to to his own thing, he felt rejuvenated. &nbsp;He was looking for connection while he processed some restless feelings of uncertainty. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">My son likes building and tinkering, so those are the kinds of things I look for when he seems restless. &nbsp;I don&#39;t ask him if he wants to do something. &nbsp;I just start doing something that I think he might enjoy (and that I enjoy). &nbsp;Most often he comes over and watches or joins in. &nbsp;I know he likes to be goofy, so sometimes I get goofy. &nbsp;I know he likes conversational games, so sometimes I start one. &nbsp;I know he likes to make food, so sometimes I&#39;ll offer to make something that he can join me in. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">I&#39;ve noticed with my son, those uncomfortable feelings of restlessness and uncertainty about what to do are eased by some company. &nbsp;Just me being fully present with him seems to help a lot. &nbsp;Sometimes a half an hour of doing something together is enough to spark an idea for something else he&#39;d like to do. &nbsp;Sometimes he wants to spend longer periods of time together. &nbsp;I don&#39;t ask a lot of questions about what he&#39;d like to do. &nbsp;I just spend time with him, sometimes doing things, sometimes just sitting with him. &nbsp;I aim to be a good friend to him in these moments, because I think that&#39;s what I would want most for myself. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">Like Alex said, spend some time really getting to know your daughter. &nbsp;Find out what she enjoys about the shows she watches and the games she plays. &nbsp;Watch and play with her. &nbsp;Talk with her about her interests, and then add some things you think she might enjoy. &nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;">Try not to worry. &nbsp;I know that&#39;s hard. &nbsp;I&#39;m a worrier, myself. &nbsp;But when we worry about another person, it becomes a burden for them on top of what they are already experiencing. &nbsp;Just be with her, as fully as you can. &nbsp;If she&#39;s telling you she&#39;s bored, she&#39;s inviting you into her experience. &nbsp;Join her. &nbsp;Learn about her. &nbsp;Share yourself with her too. &nbsp;You&#39;ll likely learn a lot about her (and yourself) in the process, and I&#39;m confident it will be enriching and rewarding for you both.&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><br></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;">Karen James</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885944922">Jason sent a follow-up on the side, and gave me permission to quote this:<br/>
____________<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for pointing out the &quot;have to&quot; and sending me back to read some more. I realize now that I had led myself into a sort of trap. I was worrying about &quot;fixing&quot; my daughters boredom; I had this idea that I &quot;had to&quot; do something because somehow I had translated what I read on your site and Pam&#39;s (and so many others&#39;) into &quot;you have to do things or it is just cheerful neglect.&quot; I was so afraid of failing her that I didn&#39;t realize that I was trying to go too fast and had missed something crucial. I wasn&#39;t being there. I was choosing to focus on her boredom (in my head, &quot;solve the problem&quot;) rather than accepting an invitation to join her in her life. I had completely missed the point.<br/>
<br/>
And you were right, I was thinking that getting more of my thoughts out on paper/screen would help me (to at least get what was in my head in order). However, going back and rereading what I wrote, it was very negative. I didn&#39;t realize how negative until just now.<br/>

First, you should play with him more AND get him out to places where other kids are, even if it’s just a McDonald’s play place.<br/>

Every incident erodes the relationship between the parent and the child.  I can’t sugar coat that.  You told the story and skipped on by the pivotal damage point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941956523"><p dir="ltr">I was talking to a friend last night who said that some kids never put the tablet (or device of choice) down, and that this type of computer use is proven to reduce creativity and the exposure to radiation causes neurological damage. </p>
<p dir="ltr">When I told her that I have a network of teen and adult unschoolers and their parents whose experiences (along with my own) contradict that assertion, and that I prefer joyful connection with my children and their chosen activities to fighting them out of fear of radiation (not in that succinct or aggressive a way-it was a chat:), she said that my situation is unique. I argued that the only thing unique about it is the unschooling, and the common denominator in the gloom-and-doom scenarios is school. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I mentioned the economics of prohibition and the idea that the kids who are on their tablets whenever they aren&#39;t in school might be responding to the massive amounts of control and top-down management in the rest of their lives.</p>
<p dir="ltr">All of this is a foreward to the following thought:</p>
<p dir="ltr">Computer technology raises the creativity bar. If it&#39;s *not* bad, that means:</p>
<p dir="ltr">- parents and other caregivers have to be *cooler* and that&#39;s more work (and sometimes impossible, because for a kid that wants to play Star Wars Battlefront on the XBox, there isn&#39;t a lot a parent can offer in the moment that will rival the experience of riding a speeder on Endor)</p>
<p dir="ltr">And/Or</p>
<p dir="ltr">-parents and caregivers have to stretch farther and work harder to learn new ways of finding connections around these amazing toys (I hear many people say they &quot;can&#39;t stand&quot; video games, or gaming youtubes or whatever, and they aren&#39;t ever going like them, and I think that&#39;s a factor-it&#39;s a new trick and they feel like old dogs and whatever happened to puppet shows?)</p>
<p dir="ltr">And/or</p>
<p dir="ltr">-learning and &quot;productive&quot; use of time might not look like what parents and caregivers were trained to believe it looked like, which means they have to throw out their old assumptions and start from scratch and that can be scary and hard.</p>
<p dir="ltr">And/or</p>
<p dir="ltr">-the &quot;problems&quot; caregivers perceive around computer technology might be either imagined or a direct result of their own actions and neuroses or both.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Or, computer technology *is* bad, after all, at least in any application out of the adult&#39;s initial comfort zone, which is much easier on the caregiver&#39;s psyche. The problem then becomes the child and their intransigent refusal to grow up and recognize what&#39;s good for them. The adult can step in to the comfortable role of manager and insist on more &quot;creative&quot; play, even if that means forcing boredom on a child until they &quot;find something to do&quot; (as I was told in my youth).</p>
<p dir="ltr">When I&#39;ve been concerned that I was too boring to unschool, meaning failing to offer sufficient stimulation, what that meant was that *I* was bored, and had to find a way to play with my kids on their terms, or pursue my own interests if they didn&#39;t wish for my participation at that moment.</p>
