<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774260766"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-If YOU <br/>
&gt; know that she LOVED Candyland, then you might pick up Chutes and <br/>
&gt; Ladders because it is also likely to be fun for her - you don&#39;t need <br/>
&gt; to wait for her to ask for it. She might never happen to see it and <br/>
&gt; might very likely never realize that it is a game she&#39;d like a lot. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if someone&#39;s interested in Chutes and Ladders, go online and look up <br/>
Snakes and Ladders (and there are some online versions of it too), which is the <br/>
traditional game from india on which Chutes and Ladders was based.   It was a <br/>
religious education tool for Hindu kids, and there are all kinds of gameboards.  <br/>
 I collect them, and photos of them, and there were a couple on towels <br/>
recently.<br/>
<br/>
Let one thing lead to another for you.   Explore.   Not the mom pressing the <br/>
kid to explore, but the mom exploring and connecting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Or maybe she loves CLUE - she&#39;d likely enjoy MASTERMIND - both <br/>
involve the same kind of logical thinking. So - how is she going to <br/>
know that?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Neopets has two games that work like Mastermind, where one can not only <br/>
explore that logic but also consider the computer programming that set those up.   <br/>
The games aren&#39;t completely random combinations--they begin with the first <br/>
colors (one click) and progress to patterns with the later colors.   That becomes <br/>
part of the strategy of solving those particular puzzles.   <br/>
Oh!   Codebreakers is in the game graveyard (still playable, but not at the <br/>
games link):<br/>

<br/>
and the newer one is Time Tunnel<br/>
 <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.neopets.com/games/timetunnel.phtml">http://www.neopets.com/games/timetunnel.phtml</a><br/>
under games, puzzle games.<br/>
<br/>
Public school teachers aren&#39;t always as prepared as we wish they&#39;d be for <br/>
teaching their subject matter, right?    Shouldn&#39;t unschoolers try to be MORE <br/>
prepared?   A mom who&#39;s going to help a child learn from the whole wide world <br/>
should herself become ever increasingly comfortable with what all is IN the whole <br/>
wide world, and how she can help bring her child to the world and the world <br/>
to   her child.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling should can can be bigger and better than school.<br/>
If it&#39;s smaller and quieter than school, the mom should do more to make life <br/>
sparkly.<br/>
