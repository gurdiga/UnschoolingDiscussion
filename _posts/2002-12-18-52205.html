&gt; Subject: Re: libraries<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kelly and Elizabeth,<br/>
&gt; You guys are lucky,   our library is connected with other  libraries in our region, northern Minnesota,  but these<br/>
&gt; are very conservative IMO,  and a bit behind sometimes,   except for those &#39;best&#39; sellers.   They have all the<br/>
&gt; new fiction but nonfiction would be another thing.   For example,  I couldn&#39;t get The Continuum Concept, so I<br/>
&gt; ordered that one.     If I could be connected up with Minnespolis/St. Paul I&#39;m sure I wouldn&#39;t have a problem.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if I dare go through amazon again with that book,    maybe I&#39;d have a better chance going through<br/>
&gt; the used side?      The thing with that is that usually I end up spending just as much with shipping,   I&#39;ll price<br/>
&gt; both,  there and FUN books.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Kelli<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kelli, try www.half.com too. Used books can be very good quality, maybe just a<br/>
little mark on the pages where they&#39;ve been &quot;remaindered&quot;. Ebay is good if you<br/>
want to get more than one book at a time and someone has them listed together<br/>
to save shipping. Media shipping is reasonable. Priority is not. Maybe we<br/>
ought to start up our own unschool resource center exchange... <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has any questions on using the used books systems to get the best<br/>
quality at the cheapest prices I would be happy to answer them to the best of<br/>
my ability. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040634561">I just tried half.com,  they didn&#39;t have it and then bestbookbuys and they had four listings, 3 of the 4 didn&#39;t have the book available any more and the one that did was Amazon and that&#39;s where I ordered it and they said it wasn&#39;t available anymore.         So  I&#39;m off to Fun books.<br/>
 <br/>
I think it must be popular?   Sold out everywhere.<br/>
