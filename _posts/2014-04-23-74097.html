<div dir="ltr">
<div style="FONT-SIZE:14pt;FONT-FAMILY:'Calibri';COLOR:#008080;">
<div><font size="4">How long has your son had unlimited access to the Ipad? Is
this a new thing or has it always been there? Does he rise at 7 am and spend 11
hours on it literally every single day or does it just seem like that to you?
What’s he doing on his ipad? </font><font size="4">Some days when I feel like one
of my children has done nothing else except choose to watch television or sat at
the computer all day, when I look at it I realise that its not all day at all.
Its only a few hours and the rest of the time they’ve been playing and doing
other things. </font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">Restricting your son’s ipad use might turn it into (or back
into) a ‘forbidden fruit’ that will then seem that much more attractive and
strengthen his desire to use it?</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">When our eldest daughter received an ipod for Christmas she
too would rise and be on it for what felt like hours through January and
February doing games and watching Barbie movies. I felt like we never saw her
anymore and she would never do anything else. I found this really tough and felt
like I was losing her.&nbsp; Well four months later she’s choosing to do lots of
other things again and I don’t often see her on her ipod now. Its become another
choice. (I will add that it was 40 degrees outside then and its not now, which 
could have had an influencing factor why she spent so much time inside on her
ipod in the air conditioning)</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font style="">I note that I am talking about our daughter here and
your daughter makes choices that don’t concern you as your son’s do. Maybe boys
and girls are wired differently when it comes to things like ipads? Perhaps boys
find these things harder to leave alone?</font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">With having breakfast and getting dressed, why is it important
to you that your son has breakfast and gets dressed by a certain time if you’re
not going anywhere and have food available for when he’s hungry? </font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">I have found our mornings have become a lot slower and
‘driftier’ without pushing for them to eat breakfast or get dressed. They will
do these things when they’re ready or if we are going somewhere. If something
interesting is happening on the computer or television it might be 9 or 10
before they do these things. </font></div>
<div><font size="4"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="4">I am pretty new to unschooling and I have been really working
on exactly these things that you have written about in recent months. Its been a
really confronting time of letting go and facilitating free choices around food
and tv and computers after quite strong limits for a number of years. I can say
now that I am seeing a whole lot more balance happening in our lives and that
they do choose many different things within a 24 hour period when there’s choice
available. </font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-444866584ygrp-text">
<p>
<p><span>Hi,&nbsp; we have been unschooling our 12 yr old daughter and 7 yr old
son for four years and I have noticed that they have very different
temperaments.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our daughter has always been able to make healthy
choices for herself (well, mostly) but our son can not.&nbsp; Our son has always
hated brushing his teeth but loves to eat surgery treats daily, because we were
trying to respect his own choices we didn&#39;t push him to brush his teeth only
explained why it was important to do so.&nbsp; Four years on, he has terrible
tooth decay and is due to go to hospital to be put asleep to have four teeth
removed, he has also suffered many painful abscess.&nbsp; How can we stand by
and watch our son in this pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt like I had let him down by
neglecting my duty of care of him as his parent, all because I wanted to respect 
his choices and not &quot;make&quot; him brush his teeth.</span></p>
<p><span><br></span></p>
<p><span>Another example is our son&#39;s iPad use.&nbsp; He is totally addicted, he
rises at 7.00am and goes straight on the IPad and then it is a struggle to get
him to have breakfast and get dressed or go out and do anything else all
day.&nbsp; If we do not intervene he stays on the iPad for 11 hours without a
break and looks really ill.&nbsp; Our son has never been to school and has never
had any limits placed on him.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So we are now feeling we have no choice but to set limits.&nbsp; Today is a
good example, we explained to our son that we are concerned about his computer
use and that we are going to limit the time he is on the iPad to 6 hrs a day
(not bad as many of his friends are only allow an hour a day!).&nbsp; At first
he want crazy, kicking, screaming, throwing things around.&nbsp; I just contined
to calmly explain why we needed to do this.&nbsp; After, 30 mins without his
iPad he started to engaged and play with his sister, went out on the trampoline
and I can hear him now happily creating and playing with his Lego in his room.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the brushing of his teeth, after trying everything, we have resort to
a consequence of stating that we will not take part in giving him more pain by
buying him candy unless he brushes his teeth&nbsp; twice a day. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh yes, and the other day our daughter did say to me &quot; Mum, please help me
stop eating candy, I can&#39;t do it myself and my skin is getting really
bad).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So maybe us parents do need to take &quot;Charge&quot; sometimes and set limits because
are not always able to make healthy choices. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to hear other people&#39;s experiences </p>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Comparisons aren&#39;t helpful. Your children are different people. Of course they&#39;ll make different choices. If your daughter is much like you she&#39;s more likely to make the same choices you do which you will feel as &quot;right&quot;. Your son is not only a different person but a different sex. His choices won&#39;t just be a little different. They can be extremely different.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sensing a disconnect between you and your kids. It sounds like you created an environment of choice and then backed off except for throwing a few &quot;right ideas&quot; at them, hoping they&#39;d choose those.<br/>
<br/>
For kids, brushing teeth isn&#39;t the simple barely-conscious act it is for adults. For kids there&#39;s texture, taste, it takes *ages*, it&#39;s lonely, it&#39;s shoving a foreign object in the mouth and probably several other objections.<br/>
<br/>
For brushing teeth -- for anything -- that you want to make an easier choice for kids, work on the roadblocks. There&#39;s some ideas here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling%20in%20action/brushingteeth.html">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling%20in%20action/brushingteeth.html</a><br/>
<br/>
*Be* with him. Don&#39;t send him off alone to brush his teeth. Brush together. Focus more on spending a joyful few minutes just you two together and let brushing be a side issue.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I felt like I had let him down by neglecting my duty of care of him as his<br/>
&gt; parent, all because I wanted to respect his choices and not &quot;make&quot; him<br/>
&gt; brush his teeth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s unfortunate but common that when people reject old ideas, they then leave a vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with not doing anything other than not making them is that the healthier, the nicer, the better choices are quite often harder. To make those easier to choose, kids need parents to create a more level playing field.<br/>
<br/>
It can help to assume they&#39;re doing the best they can. And if they need to do better, there&#39;s something in the way. Get to know them. What&#39;s bothering them. Work on what&#39;s in the way rather than working on them. Make the better choices easier.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Another example is our son&#39;s iPad use  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This too feels like disconnection. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re calling it &quot;iPad use&quot; that means you&#39;re only seeing the backside of the tablet.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s going on on the other side? What kind of things is he doing on the iPad? What does he enjoy about those things? What are his favorites?<br/>
<br/>
Do you join him? Do you get to know him better by getting to know better what he loves? Do you play with him? Do  you let him show you what he&#39;s discovering and excited about? Do you ask questions to understand his interest (and him) better?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He is totally addicted,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s not addicted. He&#39;s passionately engaged. Please do read here:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he rises at 7.00am and goes straight on the IPad and then it is a struggle to get him to have breakfast and get dressed or go out and do anything else all day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does he need to leave what he&#39;s doing to have breakfast? iPads are portable.<br/>
<br/>
Are you sweetly helping him get dressed if it&#39;s a problem for him? He&#39;s only 7! These tasks that adults see as simple aren&#39;t so simple when you&#39;re a kid! Or let him sleep in his clothes? Or put his clothes in the car so he can do the boring dressing thing once he&#39;s somewhere that&#39;s interesting enough to dress for?<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things is he being pulled from the house to do? Why can&#39;t he take the iPad?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s an introvert in a home of extroverts, it can feel to him like he&#39;s *always* leaving. (And feel to the extroverts like you&#39;re *always* at home.) Some families have found it helpful to have days scheduled for going out and days scheduled for staying in. And then making &quot;home&quot; as portable as you can. If that&#39;s the problem, ask here or search the archives for ideas.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some ideas on transitions here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling%20in%20action/transitions.html">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/unschooling%20in%20action/transitions.html</a><br/>

&gt; me stop eating candy, I can&#39;t do it myself and my skin is getting really bad).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The biggest cause of acne and zits is being a teenager. Little kids eat candy. Adults eat candy. So candy -- if it even is a factor (and perhaps only for certain types of acne) -- isn&#39;t the only factor. <br/>
<br/>
Oily skin is a factor. I&#39;m 57 and still get an occasional zit because I have really oily skin. (As does my father who&#39;s in his 80s!)<br/>
<br/>
Stress is a big factor in skin problems. Being a teen is stressful because of all the hormonal and growth and brain changes. And not begin allowed to eat things you enjoy is stressful too.<br/>
<br/>
Be sweet to her. Let her have candy. Find some medication for her.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian had a website she recommended. Maybe she&#39;ll pop in her with it (if it&#39;s still a good one!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So maybe us parents do need to take &quot;Charge&quot; sometimes and set<br/>
&gt; limits because are not always able to make healthy choices. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids shouldn&#39;t be expected to make &quot;healthy choices&quot;. If the &quot;healthy choices&quot; are harder, more irritating, have too many roadblocks, there are other factors that are skewing their decisions. Be more with them. Create a nurturing nest where better choices *feel* better and aren&#39;t just annoying and self-depriving.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919445345"><div dir="ltr">My daughter lacked enamel on some of her adult teeth when they first emerged due to high fever as a small child. She brushed her teeth regularly but still had to be put to sleep to have some removed due to decay. Unfortunately, she has continued to have weak enamel issues (she is 18).  I&#39;m not trying to sell anything but when she feels roughness or etching in her teeth we buy the complete Xylitol system from Epic Dental (online). It includes gum, mints, mild tasting toothpaste and mouthwash. After a month or so her teeth feel better. We have used this off and on for years now and she hasn&#39;t had a cavity since we started. Incidentally, she loves sweets too.<div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089032903">brushing teeth is for our family snuggle time. i often brush their  <br/>
teeth while face to face snuggling and telling them how good they  <br/>
smell and so on. no idea how this developed, but i do like that for  <br/>
years and brushing teeth was always and is up to now (oldest is five)  <br/>
a nice moment of the day (we often only brush in the evening). if they  <br/>
dont want to come to the bathroom anymore  brush their teeth in bed.<br/>
<br/>
we dont use any sugar anymore, use for everything only xylitol - in  <br/>
our house it is called teeth sugar.<br/>

<p>I do have a deep connection with both my children and love finding out about
what they love, joining them in their passions and supporting them in any way I
can.&nbsp;&nbsp; My son has had the IPad for over a year, we brought him his own
after he was sharing his dad&#39;s for a while and felt it would be nice for him to
have his own instead of sharing.&nbsp; And, honestly he is on the iPad all
day.&nbsp; Before we brought it for him he used to jump out of bed and eat three
loads of breakfast.&nbsp; Now he doesn&#39;t want to leave his room.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
But, he is not an introvert as when we do manage to get out of the house, 
swimming, seeing friends he loves it and doesn&#39;t want to leave.&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our dentist told me, candy is like acid on children&#39;s baby teeth and we all
love candy and eat it every day.&nbsp; This made me feel super guilty, but we
still eat the candy!&nbsp; </div>
<div>My husband or I are with our son when he brushes his teeth and we had all
that has been suggested, fun tooth brushes, funny songs playing on the IPad,
brushing together.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, maybe there are blocks I can&#39;t see. </div>

<div>Thanks for all the links, I will check them out.&nbsp; And I not sure if I
can find the Xytol products here in the UK but will take a look for them.</div>

The more clear the window is into your life, the more people can help. If you can&#39;t turn an analytical objective eye on your own thinking and choices, people here can&#39;t help much. If you can&#39;t see from your kids&#39; points of view to better understand the sensible (to them) reasons they&#39;re making the choices they do in order to help them past the stumbling blocks, our help won&#39;t be much help to you.</div><div><br></div><div>One clue is you said you feel &quot;super guilty&quot; about the candy. Guilt often indicates someone who sees the outcome of their choices as a reflection on them personally. They&#39;re good and right as a person when things turn out. They&#39;re bad and wrong when things don&#39;t.</div><div><br></div><div>That way of thinking makes it much harder to work towards making better choices. That way of thinking turns life into a constant effort to guess the &quot;right&quot; answer. Seemingly the only way to make better choices is to just know the rules and the right answers.</div><div><br></div><div>If that way of thinking sounds familiar, it will help to see *all* outcomes as feedback. &nbsp;That feedback will help you understand what parts of your solution are working and why, what parts aren&#39;t working and why. From that you can tweak your approach.</div><div><br></div><div>But it you can&#39;t dissociate your self-worth from how your choices turn out, it&#39;s going to be really really hard to make progressively better choices.</div><div><br></div><div><blockquote type="cite">And, honestly he is on the iPad all day.&nbsp;</blockquote><br></div><div>You&#39;re still calling what he&#39;s doing &quot;on the iPad,&quot; even though you have a &quot;deep connection.&quot; What&#39;s he *doing* on the iPad? How much time during the day do you spend with him on the iPad?</div><div><br></div><div>Don&#39;t feel *guilty* if it&#39;s zero. Don&#39;t *assume* the implication is you should be spending hours. You *say* you join them in their passions, but you wording says you have no idea what he&#39;s doing or why he enjoys doing it. It&#39;s just 11 hours of &quot;iPad&quot;. That&#39;s not a connected view of him or what he loves.</div><div><br></div><div><blockquote type="cite">Before we brought it for him he used to jump out of bed and eat three loads of breakfast.</blockquote><br></div><div>I don&#39;t know what &quot;three loads of breakfast&quot; is. But kids do grow and change. Growth rate -- and food needs -- are fast and high at the beginning, then they slow down, then kids gather energy pre-puberty growing a bit round then shoot up for another growth. (Generally.) So it could be he doesn&#39;t need as much fuel as he used to.</div><div><br></div><div>An option suggested was bringing breakfast to him. Then spend some time with him, asking about what&#39;s going on in his world. Make it a point to touch base with him *several* times a day. Bring the laundry to where he is to fold it. Ask him to bring his iPad with you and fill you in on what&#39;s been going on.</div><div><br></div><div>Maybe you&#39;re defining &quot;deep connection&quot; differently than I do. Maybe you mean something vague like &quot;loving bond&quot; or something. Here, when discussing radical unschooling, it needs to mean knowing who your child is, understanding his current interests, being attuned to his needs. It&#39;s like being a best friend and mentor rolled into one.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><blockquote type="cite">we had all that has been suggested</blockquote></div><div><br></div><div>There&#39;s about 40 suggestions on the page I linked. All?</div><div><br></div><div>By &quot;had&quot; do you mean you handed him a toothbrush or handed him a new toothpaste? Or did you engage with him to work *together* to find things he liked?</div><div><br></div><div>The first is seeing *him* as the problem and throwing solutions at him looking for something that fixes him. The second is seeing this toothbrushing business as *your* deal and then working with him to make it as easy for him to do as you can.</div><div><br></div><div>Joyce</div></html></div>

I find being with other people fun, but draining. A classic extrovert would get energy from being with others. And of course many/most people have a little bit of both - and even I find social time is energising in some ways even as it is also exhausting! A good read on introvert/extrovert is the book &quot;Quiet: The Power of Introverts&quot; by Susan Cain - though it&#39;s no substitute for just watching *your* kid and how they operate and what they need and thrive on :)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Juliet&nbsp;</div><br></span></blockquote></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123295089">My son had an operation last year where he was put to sleep and had 8 teeth removed. I was lucky to find a dentist who accepted the damage as where his teeth were at and did not shame me or him or make candy or anything else the enemy. She did show him ways to brush his teeth and talked about why it is important, but at no point did either of us feel that we had created the problem.<div><br></div><div>LiAM does eat a lot of sugary foods, and brushes his teeth sometimes (much more regularly since the operation). My youngest daughter eats just as much sugar, and brushes her teeth far less often, and has had no damage to her teeth at all. My oldest daughter has a similar brushing record to LiAM and also has no damage. So the damage is not related to sugar or to tooth brushing - it&#39;s more to do with genetics and/or LiAM&#39;s own personal make up. I had gastro quite badly several times when I was pregnant with him, so it&#39;s possible that those times coincided with when his enamel was forming and it didn&#39;t form properly. Or it may be that all the asthma medication has weakened it. I don&#39;t really care what the cause is - I&#39;d prefer to encourage brushing and make it a happy experience, but not get too hung up on it, and look after each of my kid&#39;s teeth as needed (take them for regular check ups and deal with problems when/if they arise, rather than worrying about what might go wrong)</div><div><br></div><div>Annie</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574041041">Most nights my children brush their teeth in the bedroom.<br/>
I put toothpaste on both brushes and grab two cups - one with water and one for spitting in.<br/>
I put it all on a small table beside the bed and they are both happy to brush while watching a movie or whatever they are busy with.<br/>
My little one at 4 still wants me to brush his teeth most times but taking it to them, rather than trying to get them into the bathroom<br/>
has been a simple solution.</div>
