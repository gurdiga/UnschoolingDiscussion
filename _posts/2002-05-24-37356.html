<div id="ygrps-yiv-512634650">I have had to take a test for every job I have applied for except for the one <br/>
that I am employed with now.<br/>
<br/>
When I worked for a bakery in Arkansas, I had to take a speed test and a <br/>
communications test with the temp agency. I had to prove that I could <br/>
communicate effectively and that I speed.<br/>
<br/>
Before being employed at a wiring company in Arkansas, that built dashboards <br/>
and radios for yachts in Cali...I had to be tested again in the same manner <br/>
as above.<br/>
<br/>
When applying at the shoe store and at Mervyns of Cali, I took a test that <br/>
asked me questions like, if you have 3 pairs of shoes and 1 shoe is missing, <br/>
do you leave the customer and find the other shoe or do you stay with the <br/>
customer and holler for someone to find the other shoe? Questions that asked <br/>
whether or not you have stolen before or if you would steal if you had to do <br/>
it for your family? Weird questions. And then there was the math portion of <br/>
it and the english portion of it *reading* So, even though these were <br/>
basically tests in regards to how you would work with the public and your <br/>
merit these may not be related to as tests for some people. These are still <br/>
tests. These were not taken with pencil and paper either. THey were <br/>
administered on the computer. So, if your child has no computer experience <br/>
they should get some. The way technology is going we should all be computer <br/>
literate...dont you all think?<br/>

Boy, I sure love this group.<br/>

to get my California teaching credential (but none for the Arizona one). <br/>
<br/>
The first one was ridiculously easy,  I actually bought a book to study<br/>
for the second one but it turned out to be pretty easy, too, except for<br/>
the essay question about a target heart rate for a 14 yr old boy and the<br/>
&quot;generally accepted formula&quot; for finding it. Although now that I&#39;ve been<br/>
working out I could probably get pretty close on that one... but back<br/>
then I was clueless. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the book was pretty explicit about what one needed to know.<br/>

<br/>
Assuming of course they&#39;re able somehow to acquire the idea that such a<br/>
thing exists. (Which doesn&#39;t mean the only way is for us to show them.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done a few of spreadsheets for my daughter. One has her allowance and<br/>
expenses on it. And since she was desperately trying to save for a GameCube<br/>
I said I&#39;d give her weekly interest on her savings so she can see that being<br/>
calculated.<br/>
<br/>
Another was a Hiragana/Katakana/Roman alphabet translator that I cobbled<br/>
together to help her translate Japanese Pokemon cards.<br/>
<br/>
And a similar one to translate the elvish in the first Artemis Fowl book<br/>
into English.<br/>
<br/>
We kept records of the weight gain in the kittens we were fostering and I<br/>
showed her how it could draw a chart of it for her. I wish we&#39;d been more<br/>
diligent at it but the scale wasn&#39;t cooperative and the kittens didn&#39;t seem<br/>
interested in furthering our research ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We have a checklist and pricelist of Pokemon cards.<br/>
<br/>
A catalog of American Pokemon names along side Romaji versions of their<br/>
Japanese names and meanings/origins of the Japanese versions (as far as we<br/>
could tell.)<br/>
<br/>
A list of digimon sortable by various categories.<br/>
<br/>
I found one she did on her own of the creatures she&#39;s made up with checks<br/>
and x&#39;s of various colors next to the names for some mysterious known only<br/>
to her purpose.<br/>
<br/>
(She&#39;s 10 by the way.)<br/>
<br/>
Some of these are more traditionally databases, but it shows the flexibility<br/>
of spreadsheets.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also seen me type in calculations to figure things out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Add some information into Access<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s that? A database?<br/>
<br/>
We have a database of Pokemon names in English, Romaji, Hiragana and<br/>
Katakana.<br/>
<br/>
A rather cool catalog of pictures of all the second group of the Pokemon<br/>
that we captured from the internet and organized and then translated their<br/>
names into Romaji.<br/>
<br/>
Another database of Digimon names in English, Romaji, Hiragana and Katakana.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you think this is leaning towards forced learning if the<br/>
&gt; child has no interest in those things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They probably won&#39;t be interested just for the sake of acquiring knowledge<br/>
that someone suggests might be useful.<br/>
<br/>
But they might be interested if they&#39;re shown how to use them for various<br/>
purposes that are personally meaningful like the ideas that naturally arose<br/>
above. None were planned to teach her how to use spreadsheets or databases.<br/>
We were just using those tools for real purposes. And using them for real<br/>
purposes and learning how as a side effect is much more learning-filled than<br/>
learning how they operate for &quot;just in case&quot; reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most companies <br/>
&gt; nowadays want someone who has this knowledge base of simple computer<br/>

know Java which kids seem to acquire without us even knowing they exist!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They might also catch on that they&#39;re being manipulated so I wouldn&#39;t use it<br/>
as a standard tactic ;-)<br/>
<br/>
But doing the same because it&#39;s funny without the ulterior motive works<br/>
great. :-) It&#39;s how we share our lives and our values.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677040056">Hey Dee,<br/>
<br/>
I realized that in all the discussion about whether or not tests <br/>
happen, no one has actually answered the original question which was <br/>
&quot;how do you prepare your kids?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that it is more important to prepare them emotionally for <br/>
tests than in an intellectual way.  They need to know that even if <br/>
they blow a test entirely, it is just that, one test.  It is not an <br/>
indicator of their entire being.  That one little idea can make or <br/>
break a person&#39;s test taking ability due to the &quot;nerve&quot; factor.  <br/>
<br/>
Once they understand that, you can go on to different testing methods <br/>
if you really want to.  Personally, I&#39;ve encouraged mine to do lots of <br/>
puzzles.  I like Dell Variety Puzzles best.  This helps then develope <br/>
skills that have helped me lots in test taking.<br/>

Yes.<br/>

But &quot;just playing games&quot; on computers for these kids is worlds above all the <br/>
computer learning available thirty years ago, so I cannot BEGIN to worry <br/>
about my kids not being able to pick up the details and subtletlies of ANY <br/>
computer program if they ever need it for work.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby (15) works where they have a computer program instead of a cash <br/>
register.  He learned it by watching, mostly, and being shown the basics and <br/>
then asking questions.  All on the job.<br/>

It&#39;s a good idea to express yourself honestly and spontaneously, but if <br/>
you&#39;re dishonest and manipulative, expect the kids to learn that first and <br/>
THEN maybe the content of the book or computer program.<br/>

situation like taking a test, because they&#39;ve faced enough new situations <br/>
that they can handle it.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughters, who had never taken a test before, both go to college now <br/>
- at 17 and 14 - and both had to take their first school-type tests there. <br/>
They were nervous, of course, but they sailed through with flying colors and <br/>
quickly because pros at knowing what to expect on a test and how to study for <br/>
one, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Same thing with writing essays and research papers - they learned to do it <br/>
when they needed to do it.No problem.<br/>

want to learn.<br/>
<br/>
What unschoolers discover is that kids really truly are compulsive learners - <br/>
when obstacles are removed, they can&#39;t help it - they have an internal drive <br/>
to learn - an urge to learn so strong and pervasive that they cannot resist <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;un&quot; in &quot;unschooling&quot; - is, to me, really about removing all those <br/>
obstacles that are so typical in schools and also extremely common among <br/>
homeschoolers. The focus of unschooling is creating the space and freedom for <br/>
kids to do what comes naturally to them - to learn - as opposed to finding <br/>
ways to make the kids learn or even to make them want to learn. It is a <br/>
different mindset.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is great. I thin that it is important to prepare them emotionally as <br/>
well. As everyone can see, I just about agree with everyone...I am easy to <br/>
get along with ;0)<br/>
<br/>
I remember growing up and thinking that I must be the biggest dummy in all of <br/>
the world. My father would ridicule me if I got a bad grade and so I would <br/>
never try to just come right out and tell him if I passed or failed. It was <br/>
always information that was given to him through progress reports or through <br/>
my teacher when I was just doing absolutely terrible and she felt as though <br/>
she should tell everyone about my shortcomings. <br/>
<br/>
Explaining to my oldest children that they are still being all that they can <br/>
be even if they fail on a test makes them feel a little more comfortable <br/>
about it all. As I have stated before, working at a school has offered many <br/>
opportunities to see things differently. I saw teachers literally keep the <br/>
children in at lunch time and during break time if they did not do well on a <br/>
test. Or some lamo quiz that they just thought of just because they wanted to <br/>
see if the children were paying attention in class. This is not right! Just <br/>
because someone fails doesn&#39;t mean that there is something wrong with them, <br/>
it merely means that the teacher needs to find a way to interest the child.<br/>
<br/>
It makes me mad when parents send their children to school and have no clue <br/>
as to what the child is doing and then all of a sudden when the child begins <br/>
to fail a test or some other form of record for achievement they want to blow <br/>
their tops.<br/>
<br/>
I am so grateful for this group. I have learned so much in the past week. I <br/>
have learned from everyone here. We all have our differences but it is as <br/>
though there is a wealth of knowledge located here on this board and I am <br/>
grateful for it. It is helping me make my decision easier.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again!!<br/>
<br/>
Grateful Dee<br/>
