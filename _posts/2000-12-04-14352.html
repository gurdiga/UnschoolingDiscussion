<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008982622">Hi All<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are still in the discovering stages unschooling. Our <br/>
children are still young  so we&#39;ll have ample time to sort the <br/>
issues out before we get there, but here&#39;s one that we&#39;ve been <br/>
talking about this weekend. Mathematics.<br/>
<br/>
In my mind I do have a picture of children discovering Mathematics <br/>
for themselves if they are interested, but I&#39;m having difficulty <br/>
putting this over to DH.<br/>
<br/>
He feels that they will have to follow at a least a formal curriculum <br/>
in some subjects  like Mathematics  how else will they be able to <br/>
enter unversity if they would choose a career as a scientist or <br/>
astronomer or whatever??<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas to help??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We are unschoolers who love math.  <br/>
<br/>
But the kiddos are young.  So we have a mixture of texts and fun math books <br/>
and workbooks and CDs (Math in the Real World, Mathblaster series, etc., <br/>
etc.) and lots and lots of fun -- build a bridge in the sandbox or help Mom <br/>
with the shopping (this is fun if you are getting something like candy!) or <br/>
read the cartoons in the Algebra book (my son thinks this is a big yuck) <br/>
which leads to actual math discussions or do a puzzle book or play a logic <br/>
game (Zoombinis is nice) on the computer.   It all counts and it&#39;s all math <br/>
even if it&#39;s not in the &quot;right&quot; order. We use a mixture of everything and, <br/>
while some unschoolers don&#39;t include textbooks, we do and you can do whatever <br/>
suits your fancy!  And follow up with whatever you need when you find an area <br/>
you want/need to know more about.<br/>
<br/>
Side note:  I usually look at websites when I see someone recommend a <br/>
curriculum or program -- I use the math sections as a gauge of whether or not <br/>
it will fit my kids.  I usually find that the packaged currics contain a lot <br/>
of repetition and spread subjects over many years -- things we have covered <br/>
and revisited and will talk/read about again in context -- breaking things up <br/>
into tiny little steps when this is not what my kids need.   For example, <br/>
fractions -- do we really need to learn 1/2 and 1/4 one year and 1/10 and <br/>
1/100 the next and then decimals two years later and repeat it all every <br/>
single year for 6+ years?  Not around here.  Do you encounter those concepts <br/>
and much more in just doing -- around here -- yes.  You bake or you watch a <br/>
science show or you do an experiment or you share a candy bar (do you see a <br/>
theme?).  Just a tiny example, but if you are aware of what you might cover I <br/>
think you will be reassured that these things do really come up in real life <br/>
and you don&#39;t have to repeat them to death or do 100 problems on a page to <br/>
get the info thru.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!  Don&#39;t feel guilty if a text is a comfort -- but don&#39;t let it <br/>
dictate how you learn things.  That&#39;s what we do anyway!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090988367">Hi Dalene,<br/>
<br/>
I also have a young child - 17 months - and am still in the discovering<br/>
stage of unschooling. I&#39;ve often wondered about math, too, since I&#39;ve never<br/>
had much of an interest in the subject but want to make it as fun as<br/>
possible for her when she expresses an interest in learning more.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to check out the most recent issue of Home Education<br/>
Magazine&#39;s (www.home-ed-magazine.com) online newsletter since there were a<br/>
few links for math education sites - not just worksheets either.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think your husband should be too worried about when they enter<br/>
university. They&#39;ll probably have retained more than most kids do. In fact,<br/>
I have a hard time remembering anything I learned about math beyond basic<br/>
algebra and I made it through college :).<br/>

they have an addition and subtraction game and a multiplication game (they are shaped like flashlights).&nbsp; Also we use computer games like Jumpstart which are really fun and&nbsp; full of good learning.&nbsp; These are just a few ideas.&nbsp; With an older child they can learn to budget their allowance or even help with the family budget.</font></div>

to be a scientist, mathmetist (as he calls it), or philospher.  He knows<br/>
he needs a solid foundation in math and logic to do any of these things.  <br/>
He asked this year for a systematic way to improve math.  So, he&#39;s<br/>
methodically working through Saxon 54 and 67 to get a solid grasp of the<br/>
fundamentals.  He is still looking for challenging math, though.  We also<br/>
engage in lots of logical thinking activities and stuff, too.  He is<br/>
hoping to be ready for algebra in a year so that he can better understand<br/>
the math that goes along with some of the science he reads about.  OTOH,<br/>
his younger brother is not interested one iota in anything academic at age<br/>
5.  I&#39;m sure, though, that as his interests evolve, he&#39;ll become<br/>
interested.  He has asked for some reading assistance, but the interest<br/>
really isn&#39;t there enough to hold his attention.  Funny, though, how<br/>
quickly he learned to write his name when he realized he could get a<br/>
library card....took all of 5 minutes.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve done both.  I felt that I needed a curriculum to follow for math so I <br/>
can be sure I teach what is needed for success in college.  Our son is 12 and <br/>
we are only beginning formal math training.  I&#39;m amazed at how much he <br/>
already knows.  That gives me quite a lot of confidence in the natural <br/>
learning process.  It has been a little scary to hold off and not push math <br/>
in a formal way and 12 is not a magic age, that&#39;s just where we are.<br/>
<br/>
In his earlier years he has played with different bricks, geoboards, computer <br/>
games, helped me with shopping/cooking/sewing and other activities that <br/>
required math skills, he helps us plan trips and figure out the shortest <br/>
route and how long it will take to get there, he handles his own money <br/>
including figuring out percentages for spending or donations.  Because of <br/>
these activities, he had a pretty good handle on math ability.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pleased that we are using a more formal training as well, however and <br/>
here&#39;s why.  We are finding that he often has the skill (say multiplication) <br/>
but he doesn&#39;t know what the text book is asking for when he is instructed to <br/>
multiply 6 by 5.  Becoming familiar with the language that will be used by <br/>
college instructors is important.  I&#39;ve found it interesting to note that the <br/>
language varies so much from text to text or from instructor to instructor, <br/>
so even with this preparation there will still be some adapting to future <br/>
teachers.  Still, I think it will help.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t hurt that my dh and I both like math and science, I suppose.  This <br/>
is a subject that our family has fun doing together.  Perhaps my answer might <br/>
be different if it were a chore to any of us.<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that math skills can be polished at a later date and there <br/>
is no real need to insist on formal early training.  The push for learning <br/>
more and more at an earlier age is not a valid method, IMO.  <br/>
<br/>
Something else to think about (and someone else may have already pointed this <br/>
out...) anything that is not covered by you can be learned rapidly when the <br/>
need arises.  It happens all the time.  My point being if you are concerned <br/>
that you&#39;ll miss something important, relax.  You and your children will <br/>
learn what you need when you need it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps (if not, feel free to ignore it!  &lt;BG&gt;),<br/>

I&#39;m very new at this, having just pulled my 10 year old daughter out of
public school a little over a month ago now.&nbsp; I&#39;m telling myself,
she&#39;s depressurizing and I&#39;m going to allow her time to do that without
pressure to do something &quot;constructive&quot;.
<p>We&#39;ve talked a lot about what she&#39;s interested in and what she&#39;s not
interested in and it&#39;s becoming clear to me that she doesn&#39;t really know.&nbsp;
So I have found myself trying to put interesting things within her reach
and let her pick them up or not.&nbsp; For example, she declared herself
not interested in history or colonial America.&nbsp; I rented Roots at
the local library and invited her to watch.&nbsp; Last night we finished
watching the last of the six videotapes.&nbsp; During movie time, it was
her idea to tell her friends on the telephone that she was busy watching
Roots and couldn&#39;t talk.&nbsp; We all enjoyedd it thoroughly.
<p>I feel like I&#39;m cheating but how can she know if she&#39;s interested in
history or not when her exposure to the subject is limited to what they
presented in public school?&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems to me like my job is to
offer lots of interesting activities and see which ones she wants to delve
into.&nbsp; I&#39;d prefer it, I think, if she had some grand passion for something
and I&#39;d help her pursue it.

passion&quot; (if she ever needs one) if she&#39;s never exposed to a rich mixture of <br/>
what&#39;s out there in the world.  Lots of choices, a library card and a mom <br/>

comes to maths if they do not have a formal curriculim.  Formal learning of<br/>
subjects often prohibits true understanding of a subject.  Understanding<br/>
goes so much deeper when you figure it out yourself.  I suppose I am talking<br/>
more about discovery for younger children and early teens raher thatn for<br/>
somebody who has decided to follow a math calling and seek formal<br/>
instruction/exploration.  But in our house, the basics have just happened.<br/>
Pocket money, manipulatives just played with, counting by 2s or 5s for the<br/>
fun of it. (I remember one of the kids doing a workbook type thing which was<br/>
adding/subtracting the teens.  For every problem she subtracted 10 and<br/>
added/subtracted the remainder and then added the 10 back on again.  Talk<br/>
about understanding of the decimal number system...now, what would have<br/>
happened if I had tried to &quot;teach&quot; that?) We also talk alot about conceptual<br/>
mathmatics and build things like Mobius strips and Klein cubes. Check out<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tarquin-books.demon.co.uk/">http://www.tarquin-books.demon.co.uk/</a> What a shame that you don&#39;t get<br/>
to the fun stuff until too late if you follow a linear curriculum. I am only<br/>
just realizing how cool maths is because I am learning it all over again<br/>
with my kids.<br/>

&lt;&lt;   Understanding<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This is holding very true with my kids. <br/>
<br/>
And when you have learned something by actually needing and doing it, once <br/>
you come to the formal presentation all you&#39;re learning is vocabulary because <br/>
you already understand the concepts.<br/>
<br/>
Understanding algebra first and THEN seeing an equation is WAY more sensible <br/>
than someone showing you a jumble of numbers and trying to turn it into real <br/>
pictures in your head.<br/>
<br/>
Any parent who can&#39;t imagine how algebra could be intuitively understood <br/>
probably doesn&#39;t actually understand how algebra can be used in everyday <br/>
life, and so... even though they took Algebra I when they were 13 and Algebra <br/>
II when they were 15, or Algebra in college, maybe they only understand how <br/>
to run numbers through pre-provided &quot;problems&quot; and don&#39;t understand what it <br/>
is in the everyday world.<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s a math guy. I told him I only ever liked and understood the word <br/>
problems, but most of my friends hated the word problems. He said the word <br/>
problems are the ONLY problems in math books.  The &quot;number problems&quot; are the <br/>
solutions to unstated problems, without the computations done.<br/>
