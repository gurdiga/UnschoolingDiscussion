<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111277200">You can&#39;t force a child to learn anything. If you could, all students in school would get 100% on every test. <br/>
<br/>
Unless children are being locked in an empty room with white walls everyday, they *are* experiencing things and therefore their synapses are developing. <br/>
<br/>
Since unschooling isn&#39;t a hugely common thing, I&#39;ll guess you went to school or at the very least were homeschooled. Think about all of the things you learned in school that you no longer know because they simply weren&#39;t relevant in your life (pruning). <br/>
<br/>
What if you had spent all of that time you had been in school instead learning about what WAS relevant to your life? I would guess a lot less &quot;pruning&quot; would happen. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a guess, but I would think unschooling children&#39;s brains prune less and develop more. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the first really different topics to come through the  <br/>
list for a long time!  Cool.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=--I&#39;ve heard that children development many, many synapses in their  <br/>
brain but then a pruning occurs. If a synapse isn&#39;t used, it&#39;s pruned.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;a pruning.&quot;  That sounds awful, and it sounds deliberate,  <br/>
and sharp and cutting.<br/>
It would be more like the connection becoming atrophied, but even that  <br/>
is too dramatic and too big.  &quot;A synapse&quot; is more like old-time hand- <br/>
operated telephone switchboards.  Two things were connected at one  <br/>
time, but perhaps the call has been disconnected.<br/>
<br/>
UNlike old time telephone switchboards, an old connection can be  <br/>
restablished.  So it&#39;s more like they fade from brightness to plain to  <br/>
dull to dusty/pale, and other more interesting things take the  <br/>
foreground of thought and awareness.   If something comes along to  <br/>
remind (literally put it in your mind again), the old connection will  <br/>
light up again.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I understand it, and my analogy might be as crude as  <br/>
&quot;pruning,&quot; but I don&#39;t like pruning.  I hardly even cut branches off  <br/>
my trees anymore; seriously.   I sure don&#39;t want to think of people  <br/>
clipping things out of my brain or my kids&#39; brains.  That&#39;s called  <br/>
&quot;lobotomy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-So the more experiences the child has, the more synapses he&#39;ll  <br/>
retain. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Certainly.<br/>
What happens in school&#39;s intended teaching is rarely &quot;experiences.&quot;<br/>
The experiences retained from school are quite often not what the  <br/>
school planned and paid for.<br/>
<br/>
Before I go on, for anyone who&#39;s reading, here&#39;s an important question  <br/>
to think about:  &quot;the more synapses he&#39;ll retain&quot; WHEN?  When is the  <br/>
snapshot moment being considered when someone says &quot;will retain&quot;?  At  <br/>
18?  21?  30?  56?  82?<br/>
<br/>
There is no absolute measurement for synaptic retention.  And it  <br/>
sounds kind of unsanitary, put that way.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=- I was just wondering about the fact with unschooling we don&#39;t try  <br/>
to cram facts and information down our kids&#39; throats but let them lead  <br/>
the way-=-<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, wait.  Down their throats doesn&#39;t lead to their brain.   <br/>
Chemically, yes.  Informationally, not so much.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let them lead the way&quot; is not the opposite of &quot;try to cram facts and  <br/>
information&quot; (down or into them).<br/>
I know there are LOTS and lots of people who describe unschooling as  <br/>
&quot;child led learning,&quot; but they don&#39;t tend to stay on this list, or if  <br/>
they do they&#39;re likely to find a better model and definition for  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If we did force more of schoolish stuff would their synapses  <br/>
develop more and thus help their brain develop more?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Depends who &quot;we&quot; are and what the &quot;less of schoolish stuff&quot; image one  <br/>
might have would be.<br/>
<br/>
What does a tree need for its leaves and twigs to develop more?<br/>
What does a cat need for its brain to develop more?<br/>
<br/>
They need a lack of abuse.  They need water and food, sunshine.  The  <br/>
cats can use things or people to play with, and people or other cats  <br/>
to groom them, pet them, lie down next to them sometimes.  The tree  <br/>
might need to be less in the shade of other trees for optimal growth,  <br/>
or might need not to be where the wind is banging their branches  <br/>
against a cliff or building or fence or something.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of people as the natural, biological beings they are,  <br/>
rather than as school kids who either are or are not in school, things  <br/>
become much clearer.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-If we did force more of schoolish stuff would their synapses  <br/>
develop more and thus help their brain develop more?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You cannot force schoolish stuff.  Schools try and fail, and they&#39;re  <br/>
professionals.   &quot;Stuff&quot; (if by stuff you mean knowledge) cannot be  <br/>
stuffed into someone.  Learning happens by the learner thinking,  <br/>
comparing, considering, and drawing the connections in.<br/>
<br/>
If the &quot;or what?&quot; scenario is unschooling as discussed on this list,  <br/>
Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s site, my unschooling pages and the blogs of many of  <br/>
the longtime-unschooling members of this list, and if a family does  <br/>
things every single day to provide and stir and stimulate idea-hoppin&#39;  <br/>
thought, then brains will develop--not just the children&#39;s brains, but  <br/>
the parents&#39; too.<br/>

<br/>
Doh!  Amanda just said what I said, but much more succintly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What people &quot;prune&quot; is what they didn&#39;t want or use in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the original post and my way long response didn&#39;t mention &quot;short  <br/>
term memory,&quot; which is intended to be released after it&#39;s used once.   <br/>
The phone number of the plumber you&#39;re about to call.  The directions  <br/>
to a restaurant you didn&#39;t much like after you ate there.  The grocery  <br/>
list so short you don&#39;t intend to write it down.  How many eggs you  <br/>
have.   Those things are not synapses built to last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Many people put all the science, math and geography they ever learned  <br/>
into that flimsy paper storage bag, too.   I was in and around school  <br/>
for a long, long time, and the question I heard asked more than any  <br/>
other was &quot;Is this going to be on the test?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The &quot;experiences&quot; students have in school are limited - limited in <br/>
location, limited in type, limited in content.<br/>
<br/>
Learning (synapse formation) happens best under conditions of trust, <br/>
interest, and support --- and the least learning happens under <br/>
conditions of anxiety, confusion, coercion, and boredom.<br/>
<br/>
  Unschooling parents should be offering MORE of the world to their <br/>
children than schools. Unschooling parents should be offering more <br/>
experiences, more environments, more conversation, more exposure, and <br/>
far far more support for pursuing interests.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not not-schooling; it is replacing schooling with <br/>
something better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This question came up on a local list awhile ago. A parent and Waldorf <br/>
teacher claimed that multiplication, or skip-counting, must be learned <br/>
in a certain window, or it would be too late.<br/>
<br/>
I did a little research, and consulted my cousin, who had been doing <br/>
post-doc work at MIT in neural science, and he confirmed that what I <br/>
found was the general consensus in that community about what the <br/>
research was indicating at that point.<br/>
<br/>
This was the best summary I found at that date, (written in 2007):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/33/38811529.pdf">http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/42/33/38811529.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
A couple of quotes from this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Neuroscientists have well established that the brain has a highly <br/>
robust and well-developed<br/>
capacity to change in response to environmental demands, a process <br/>
called plasticity. This<br/>
involves creating and strengthening some neuronal connections and <br/>
weakening or<br/>
eliminating others. The degree of modification depends on the type of <br/>
learning that takes<br/>
place, with long-term learning leading to more profound modification. It <br/>
also depends on the<br/>
period of learning, with infants experiencing extraordinary growth of <br/>
new synapses. But a<br/>
profound message is that plasticity is a core feature of the brain <br/>
throughout life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are optimal or “sensitive periods” during which particular types <br/>
of learning are most<br/>
effective, despite this lifetime plasticity.<br/>
Brain research provides important neuroscientific evidence to support <br/>
the broad aim of lifelong<br/>
learning: Far from supporting ageist notions that education is the <br/>
province only of the young<br/>
– the powerful learning capacity of young people notwithstanding – <br/>
neuroscience confirms<br/>
that learning is a lifelong activity and that the more it continues the <br/>
more effective it is.&quot;<br/>

I had read somewhere that we have way more of those than we need in a<br/>
lifetime. What would the point be in cramming stuff in to increase space<br/>
when it is getting filled by useless things? Like buying a new hard disk to<br/>
be able to save files you are likely not going to need anyway?<br/>
<br/>
I had this page in my favourites, which has quite a bit of stuff around<br/>
this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/plast.html">http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/plast.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;Experience determines which connections will be strengthened and which will<br/>
be pruned; connections that have been activated most frequently are<br/>
preserved.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Put it like that, schoolish stuff is not likely to help in preserving<br/>
synapses :D<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve often wondered if the claims that learning declines as people age, or that the brain is not &quot;fully developed&quot; until the age of 24 is more about the fact that people want to/need to learn more when they&#39;re younger and as we age, many people become less interested in learning? It&#39;s not really a fully developed idea in my mind and I haven&#39;t researched it or anything... I just find it funny that people&#39;s brains are &quot;fully developed&quot; at 24... Is that because they graduate college at 22 and spend the next two years learning how to do their new &quot;after college&quot; jobs effectively and beyond that point stop &quot;wanting&quot; to learn new things as much? <br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;fully developed&quot; anyways? I&#39;m 32... I&#39;m not anywhere close to being &quot;fully developed&quot;.<br/>

going to miss some &quot;learning window&quot; for memorizing multiplication facts <br/>
and, therefore, end up homeless and friendless.<br/>

Those optimal or sensitive periods are those periods when a child <br/>
displays certain kinds of interests and inclinations - kids around 8 to <br/>
12 years old are likely to be more into information, often seem to be <br/>
collecting facts, for example, than teenagers, who are more likely to <br/>
want to talk about issues and develop analysis abilities.<br/>
<br/>
If we were writing curriculum, it would be important to think ahead <br/>
about the kind of learning that suits kids at different ages (not that <br/>
we could get it right for any individual kid). But we unschoolers live <br/>
with our kids, we know them, we are aware of their interests and <br/>
inclinations at a much more in-depth and intimate level. We support <br/>
their interests and inclinations every hour of every day. We don&#39;t need <br/>
to worry about those broad generalizations about learning windows or <br/>
sensitive periods or any of that because our kids are right there in <br/>
front of us, showing and telling and displaying what they need.<br/>

(bands, musical instruments, movies, actors, cars, trucks, places,  <br/>

information, but it&#39;s less concrete so not as easy to name.  They&#39;re  <br/>
learning about relationships and human nature and group dynamics and  <br/>
politics (the real definition of politics, not the &quot;civics&quot; trivia and  <br/>

cafeteria was and whether a particular teacher wanted to grant  <br/>

<br/>
Why would schoolish stuff be more important experiential learning than other learning to develop synapses?  <br/>
<br/>
Whether or not it&#39;s true that more experiences develop more synapses, wouldn&#39;t change the fact that kids who are allowed to experience the world in a peaceful happy learning environment will learn more and better than kids who are stuffed into a classroom with a bunch of other kids who may or may not like them and forced to do things they may or may not be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing things on others has never proven to create happy learning.  Forcing learning doesn&#39;t work either, if it did schools would churn out a 100% success rate of their fine products of children.<br/>
<br/>
The growing and trimming of synapses could be a bit like pruning a bush.  A kid in school might be getting all the wrong branches trimmed off.  A kid who is unschooling might grow and shape naturally, following the light and allowing their branches to die off naturally as they are no longer needed.  A common bush that gets trimmed and shaped around here is a type of cedar, that if left untouched grows into a beautiful tree.  A lot of people shape them into hedges. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428778672">I recently had Lyme disease in my brain, which left about twenty little<br/>
holes. Luckily I can still walk and talk, but I couldn’t drive a car anymore.<br/>

synapses and connecting cables would grow back. Not in the same way but in a<br/>
new way, with all the new experiences I would have. Not being anxious about it<br/>
would help because of the lower levels of adrenalin and other stress hormones.<br/>
The neurologist told me that the brain is an ever regenerating organ, and that<br/>
learning things works best when you are happy.<br/>
It made me be even more positive about unschooling (learning things in a<br/>
relaxed environment) and happy because of the power in my own body, that it can<br/>
regenerate itself. <br/>
I can drive again, it took me three months. Recently I started doing very complicated<br/>
work again (information analysis and programming software) I can&#39;t do it for<br/>
hours, but for two hours in a row works. It makes my brain work hard, but it<br/>
works and makes me happy (and it brings some hard needed cash in our<br/>
household).<br/>
Maybe this helps in this discussion.<br/>

we do with our spare brain cycles (like editing Wikipedia and yes, <br/>
making LOLcats). Watch now &gt;&gt;<br/>

If someone knew almost nothing in the world but trivia relating to  <br/>
popular music for the past 100 years, that would make a HELL of a good  <br/>
grid over which to lay other things.   And I don&#39;t think a thorough  <br/>
knowledge of pop music (in any culture or language) over this  <br/>
particular past hundred years, which saw the proliferation of recorded  <br/>
music available in homes, the advent of radio broadcasts, movies with  <br/>
music, television variety shows, transistor radios, cassette players  <br/>
in cars, CDs, iPods and cell phones that store a ton of music could  <br/>
help but create a timeline of the culture.  Wouldn&#39;t songs from Marx  <br/>
Brothers or Fred Astaire movies remind people of The Great  <br/>
Depression?  Can anyone hear big-band swing music and not also think  <br/>
of the hairdos and costumes?  Does &quot;Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy not remind  <br/>
anyone of WWII?  Knowing some of the context of Gene Autrey and Roy  <br/>
Rogers brings up LOTS of stories about where those songs were first  <br/>
heard.<br/>
<br/>
The lyrics of some of the songs make specific mention of historical  <br/>
events, and that could help dating things, too, if a person were  <br/>
trying to figure out what came first.<br/>
<br/>
Any hobby delved into deeply becomes another portal to the whole  <br/>
world--real and imagined; past, present and future.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I studied developmental psych a few years ago, but couldn&#39;t quite remember the details. This got me curious and I looked it up - reforging those synaptic pathways? :)<br/>
<br/>
Neuroscience researchers think our brains make nearly twice as many synaptic connections than we could ever use. They call this &quot;blooming,&quot; and &quot;pruning&quot; deals with the overproduction, at different times in different brain areas (this relates to the &quot;critical periods&quot; another poster mentioned).<br/>
<br/>
In the prefrontal cortext (higher-level thinking, self-regulation), peak overproduction occurs at about age 1, yet still doesn&#39;t reach it&#39;s adult level of synaptic density until middle to late adolescence. Then there&#39;s said to be a period of &quot;pruning&quot; which is &quot;critical&quot; for higher-order cognitive functioning such as reasoning. <br/>
<br/>
So the way I understand it, major &quot;pruning&quot; at certain &quot;critical&quot; stages is a normal developmental process, like puberty. Also, because of the brain&#39;s &quot;plasticity&quot; (as another poster mentioned), our brains are always &quot;blooming&quot; and &quot;pruning&quot; based on our interests, our attention, our focus.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; So the more experiences the child has, the more synapses he&#39;ll retain.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the more experiences a child has, the more synapses s/he will FORM (in the overproduction phase, or childhood/early adolescence). The ones that are the most interesting will be stronger, thus retained. The ones least developed will fade to make way for the more interesting.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People get all wound up about &quot;sensitive periods&quot; - and with kids in school, not allowed to follow their natural inclinations, there&#39;s some reason for that, but unschooling kids don&#39;t have that handicap. They get to explore their &quot;sensitive periods&quot; in ways that make sense to them. <br/>
<br/>
Schoolish thinking is that its the adults/teachers who have to discover these &quot;sensitive periods&quot; and exploit them in a series of teachable moments or whatever but in natural learning a child whose brain is developing a lot in one area is going to be naturally drawn to explore and learn in that area. That&#39;s why (or partly why) its so important to be open to kids pursuing passions - &quot;passion&quot; is what a &quot;sensitive period&quot; looks like in real life. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-446114386">Eureka.... this is why telling people who don&#39;t want to know in depth<br/>
about the &quot;train wreck&quot; they perceive unschooling to be exercises fear<br/>
rather than learning about the philosophy. Anybody who doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
know about unschooling but feels compelled to for any reason (job<br/>
requirement to find something sensational to grab more ratings, Juju<br/>
Chang of Good Morning America for instance; being a reluctant relative<br/>
of an unschooled child).<br/>
<br/>
Those people are unlikely to learn about unschooling just by hearing info.<br/>

age, I did some research online about the subject.  I sent the results <br/>
of what I found by email to my cousin, who at the time was doing <br/>
post-doc work in neural science at MIT. He confirmed that the <br/>
information I found was representative of what he knew to be the general <br/>
consensus in the neural science field at that time.<br/>

The conclusion I drew from the evidence I found at that time was that <br/>
learning was a lifelong process, and that while there may be sensitive <br/>
periods for certain types of learning at certain ages, neural pathways <br/>
do not close permanently.<br/>
