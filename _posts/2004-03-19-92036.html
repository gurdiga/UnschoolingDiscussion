<div id="ygrps-yiv-81107066">Hi again.<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what to do for my son who is almost 4 and currently attending <br/>
preschool in a short AM program.  Next year I would like to keep him home but <br/>
I&#39;m worried about him having friends to play with.  I am in a MOMS Club chapter <br/>
here and we attend many events with him and his 1 year old sister.  Most of <br/>
the older children are in preschool so the events are mostly for the under 3 <br/>
crowd.<br/>
The &quot;problem&quot; is that he is a very active, loud, spirited child who enjoys <br/>
playing around other children but often just gets too rough.  He really needs <br/>
another little boy who plays like he does to be buddies with.  Unfortunately, we <br/>
haven&#39;t found any friends like this yet.  He attends events with these other <br/>
children but does not have a friend and doesn&#39;t get invited to do things with <br/>
other families.  Although some people do come over to our house for a playdate <br/>
when invited, he is not a child who others seek out to play with, and many <br/>
parents aren&#39;t too keen on him playing with their kids because of his activity <br/>
level I&#39;m guessing.<br/>
We&#39;ve just decided to start a &quot;boys only&quot; playgroup in hopes of finding some <br/>
other boys for him to be friends with.  Currently, he plays &quot;appropriately&quot; <br/>
with a boy in his preschool class who will be going to kindergarten in the fall <br/>
(they live way out in the country and mom works, so play dates have not worked <br/>
out).  Although we live in a neighborhood with other children, we don&#39;t have <br/>
good friends down here yet.<br/>
I worry that if he is home with me all the time, he may only get the chance <br/>
to interact with other children once a week or so, plus the children his age <br/>
will all be heading off to school leaving him with only preschoolers in our MOMS <br/>
club.<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions for finding friends for my very active <br/>
little boy?<br/>
He is getting services from the school district right now for social skills, <br/>
speech , and OT (sensory issues) but I am planning on discontinuing them at <br/>
the end of this year as he has come a long way this year and can now play with <br/>
other kids for an hour or so without anyone getting hurt. (He used to crash his <br/>
body into other people all the time, in an attempt to engage in play).<br/>
Our local (45 minutes away) hs support group does some activites for <br/>
preschool age children but they have tended to all be structured activities like a <br/>
museum or art class, rather than less formal play or park dates which we&#39;d <br/>
prefer.  I&#39;m hoping to perhaps find homeschoolers who are closer to us who aren&#39;t <br/>
the school-at-home type.<br/>
Sorry this is so long.<br/>

&gt; under 3<br/>
&gt; crowd.<br/>
&gt; The &quot;problem&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you call it a problem it is a problem.  Personally, I prefer active, <br/>
loud spirited children who demand what they want, when compared to quiet <br/>
children.  Unless I have a headache. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is that he is a very active, loud, spirited child who enjoys<br/>
&gt; playing around other children but often just gets too rough.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you talked to him about the too rough?  I think when children get <br/>
too rough it&#39;s often because they aren&#39;t being closely supervised, where <br/>
someone steps in before they become rough enough to hurt another child.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He really needs<br/>
&gt; another little boy <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s pretty sexist.  I know lots of girls who are active, loud, and <br/>
spirited who love to play in active,loud ways.  The perfect friend for <br/>
your son might be a little girl!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; who plays like he does to be buddies with.  Unfortunately, we<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t found any friends like this yet<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe that&#39;s becuase you are limiting his friends to boys?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   He attends events with these other<br/>
&gt; children but does not have a friend and doesn&#39;t get invited to do <br/>
&gt; things with<br/>
&gt; other families.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you asked why?  Maybe it&#39;s because his play often turns rough.  It <br/>
seems some people think that really rough play is a &quot;boy being a boy&quot; <br/>
when in reality it is play out of control and that child needs some help <br/>
playing more gently. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although some people do come over to our house for a playdate<br/>

&gt; activity<br/>
&gt; level I&#39;m guessing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have two very active children.  I&#39;m think it may not be because of his <br/>
acivity level but because he needs some help being more gentle and easy <br/>
with other children. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that&#39;s pretty sexist, again.  Will you leave your 3 year old <br/>
daughter at home to avoid exposing her to these rough little boys? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Currently, he plays &quot;appropriately&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm, wonder what it is about the preschool class?  Are limits set on <br/>
&quot;roughness?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amanda, I am not going to respond to every bit of what you say.  It <br/>
seems to me that your child needs a few things.  First, little girls can <br/>
behave just as you say above.  Stop being so sexist.  Your child needs <br/>
to be in a play group with children of all ages and sexes.  Second, if <br/>
your child has a hard time understanding physical boundries and rules <br/>
for play, then he needs your one on one help continually to get that <br/>
message.  When he&#39;s playing with another child, you should be RIGHT <br/>
THERE, next to him.  You and your son should come up with a signal you <br/>
can give him when he is is starting to get rough--it can simply be a <br/>
touch on his arm or a secret code word.  With that word, or touch, he <br/>
can then back off, count to ten, or have some other self-controlling <br/>
activity to do until he gets it together.  It seems that your son might <br/>
need to find a lot of other really gentle children to play with so he <br/>
can model THOSE behaviors, instead of putting him in with other &quot;active&quot; <br/>
boys.  A lot of time I see parents of active children sitting with the <br/>
other parents across the park when the mom of the active child needs to <br/>
be WITH her child, all the time, in order to help that child learn the <br/>
skills he or she needs to behave in a social setting. <br/>
<br/>
I am not at all convinced that all children under the age of five or six <br/>
need constant interaction of children their own age. <br/>
<br/>
I also think that the best way for your child to find and make friends <br/>
is for you to be right there helping him through the process and <br/>
teaching him one on one constantly what behaviors he needs to be a friend. <br/>

But it was the same post, so no sense pointing it out twice.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he could use playing with older boys, bigger than he is.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that kids need same-gender, same-age playmates is recent.  School <br/>
divides by age but that&#39;s not any ancient tradition.   It&#39;s quite a <br/>
school-related idea.   Kids seem to learn more and get along better by playing in mixed <br/>
age groups.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; Does anyone have any suggestions for finding friends for my very active<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Martial arts classes.   He might meet kids there he can hang out with other <br/>
times, or he might just get to interact with them in class, but find classes <br/>
and take him.  Maybe even go with him, if it&#39;s a mixed class.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When he&#39;s playing with another child, you should be RIGHT <br/>

<br/>
I agree.  Maybe even playing with him.  There are things adults and kids can <br/>
do together, and if he&#39;s not safe with other kids, he shouldn&#39;t be with other <br/>
kids alone yet.  He&#39;ll gain skills to handle himself socially as he gets older.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506617680">I understand a little bit how you feel because I also<br/>
have a 4 year old unschooled boy. My situation is a<br/>
little different because he has a big sister, but she<br/>
often has friends over and he gets left out. <br/>
My suggestions are twofold:<br/>
First, I would start a local unschooling group,<br/>
perhaps even focused on preschool/kindergarden age. I<br/>
would make up flyers and post them anywhere parents<br/>
go: Library, Health food store, grocery store,<br/>
playgrouds, baby product stores, etc. where they will<br/>
let you put up flyers. There may be parents who have<br/>
decided to postpone sending their child to<br/>
kindergarden for one year who are also looking for<br/>
playmates. You may even want to start a yahoo group<br/>
just for local unschoolers. Advertize it to all<br/>
homeschoolers in the area, the word will eventually<br/>
get around! I did this and to my surprise have 22<br/>
members within on month. Of course I don&#39;t know how<br/>
big of a town you live in, but I think it&#39;s woth a<br/>
try. I bet there are people out there in the same<br/>
situation as you are in, and all you really need are 3<br/>
or 4 that you get along with and you can get to know<br/>
them and start trading babysitting eventually.<br/>
Also, on a sunny day, go to playgrounds, walk up to<br/>
Moms who are there with kids his age and strike up a<br/>
conversation. You will eventually meet some friends.<br/>
Regarding the second isssue, about him being too<br/>
rough, I don&#39;t think it is sexist to want him to play<br/>
with boys and to encourage that. I have a daughter who<br/>
is very rough and tumble, very active and loved<br/>
playing with boys up to a certain age, and then no<br/>
more! I think it is a developmental phase they go<br/>
through. As long as you don&#39;t deny him the opportunity<br/>
to play with a girl who wants to be rough and tumble,<br/>
I don&#39;t see any harm in trying to find more boys for<br/>
him. They do have a big reserve of testosterone after<br/>
all and they do sometimes act in ways that are very<br/>
&quot;boyish&quot;, I think if we honor that in our sons we can<br/>
really help their self esteem in the long run rather<br/>
that act like it is negative is some way.<br/>
That said, of course he shouldn&#39;t hurt anyone, and<br/>
from your description, I wonder if he might not suffer<br/>
from food allergies. Have you looked into that at all?<br/>
I hope some of this helps, <br/>
D-<br/>
