<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690881588"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt;Museums are good, but unschooling isn&#39;t all about museums.  It&#39;s more <br/>
&gt; about living day to day life.  Ordinary days lived to the fullest. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Absolutely, positively true.  <br/>
  My son loves trains.  We walk down to the tracks every day to check what&#39;s <br/>
there.  Usually a tanker or hopper left on the siding, waiting for Engine 30 <br/>
to come and take it away.  We take the long way whenever we drive anywhere <br/>
locally, looping over as many tracks as possible.  Where&#39;s Number 30 parked today? <br/>
 Across from the Deli?  Behind the warehouse?  Down by Lizzie&#39;s? <br/>
  On Thursdays during the summer we hop the bus to town to go to the Farmer&#39;s <br/>
Market.  We have a car but the bus ride is part of the adventure.  We have <br/>
lunch on the Square, or at Wendy&#39;s, visit the Thomas section at the department <br/>
store, cross the street to the library, and we&#39;re ready to head back home.<br/>
  Mornings we walk to the park.  Sometimes there&#39;s other kids there, but Jim <br/>
would just as soon roll down the hill or chase after squirrels.  There&#39;s a <br/>
little creek there that we sat in last summer, throwing stones and relaxing in <br/>
the shade.  It&#39;s down the bank from the park, and feels secluded. <br/>
  My sister lives across the street from her city pool, so sometimes we go <br/>
there.  We spend lots of time visiting my daughter.  Her son is just a year <br/>
younger than mine.<br/>
  With winter here, we spend more times indoors.  Videos, computer, <br/>
watercolor, playdough.  Books.  Trains.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;We live in a little town.  The nearest city is Harrisburg PA, about <br/>
an hour away&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  <br/>
  We went to Harrisburg for a weekend in the middle of December.  There was a <br/>
huge gun show there.  My husband buys and sells antique and collectible <br/>
firearms and accessories.  I sell scented candles.  We took Jim with us and set up <br/>
two tables for the weekend.  Kind of a working family vacation.<br/>
 <br/>
  Our little town doesn&#39;t &quot;offer&quot; much, either.  But we shop for groceries, <br/>
go to the barber, get gas (make sure to wash the windows each time), visit the <br/>
nursery (Jimmy loves pansies and gets a new pot of them for about a buck and a <br/>
half at every visit),  take the cardboard to be recycled, lots of walking and <br/>
talking to the neighbors (I used to be shy until I had Jim!).  Like Sheila <br/>
said, just live your life fully.  Allow your kids to do the same.  <br/>
  (We do museums, too.  We live near the Steamtown National Historic Site, <br/>
and it&#39;s a train museum.  And we visit Strasburg twice a year to ride Thomas and <br/>
visit the train museum there.)<br/>

PS  Strasburg is right there by Intercourse, and Blue Balls, and <br/>
Bird-in-Hand......<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do too!  Well, we only go ride Thomas once a year.  The kids LOVE <br/>
the Choo Choo barn.  Very cool to hear about unschoolers doing things <br/>
in PA.  I&#39;m not used to that!  <br/>
