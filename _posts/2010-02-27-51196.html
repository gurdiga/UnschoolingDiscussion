<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774577835">Sorry this is way off topic but the earthquake in Chile has me  <br/>
worrying and wondering about Bea Montavani.  Last I heard she was  <br/>
visiting her father in Chile. Does anyone know where he lives and/or  <br/>
has heard how they are?<br/>
<br/>
Also sending safe thoughts to everyone in the Pacific - and the  <br/>
Watkins on Oahu.<br/>

<br/>
I think he lives in the mountains on a ranch or farm or something.   <br/>
Not positive, but I had that picture in my head.  I could be wrong.   <br/>
But Holly thinks they are already in Chile.  Scheduled to return March  <br/>
15th or so.<br/>

rest was in french so I couldn&#39;t understand.  Glad to know she&#39;s safe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111736417">Thanks Chris! I just checked!<br/>
He says they don&#39;t have electricity  or water but they have a fireplace and food and drinks.<br/>
I have not heard from another family I know that lives there but I am hoping they are all OK too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435478745">Looks like it was a non-event. I checked with the Inglis family on the  <br/>
Big Island and they were safe. I have a hula friend visiting family on  <br/>
Oʻahu and sheʻs fine, too.<br/>
