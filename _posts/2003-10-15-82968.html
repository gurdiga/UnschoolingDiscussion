Hi Dawn.<br/>
<br/>
Couldn&#39;t you just tell them that you&#39;d miss him too much to send him off so<br/>
young or something like that?   He&#39;s only 3.  You don&#39;t need to be<br/>
contemplating any concrete answers for at least another couple of years.<br/>
Why do people want people to send their babies off so soon and then look at<br/>
you like you&#39;re the one who&#39;s crazy for wanting them home!<br/>
<br/>
I interviewed for a job the other day.  I was telling the interviewer that I<br/>
was looking for part-time because I only had a few years left with my kids<br/>
but that because they were older I didn&#39;t have the time restrictions that<br/>
you have with little ones.  She said, &quot;Yea, I know what you mean.  I&#39;m<br/>
finally getting my life back now that my kids are getting older.&quot;  Turns out<br/>
her kids are 3 and 5.   I dropped that subject fast--lol!<br/>
