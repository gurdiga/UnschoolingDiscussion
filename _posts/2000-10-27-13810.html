Subject: IDIOTS IN EVERYDAY LIFE:<br/>
<br/>
 IDIOTS IN SERVICE:<br/>
<br/>
This week, all our office phones went dead and I had to contact the<br/>
telephone repair people.  They promised to be out between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00<br/>
p.m.  When I asked if they could give me a smaller time window the pleasant<br/>
gentleman asked, &quot;Would you like us to call you before we come?&quot;  I replied<br/>
that I didn&#39;t see how he would be able to do that, since our phones weren&#39;t<br/>
working. He also requested that we report future outages by email (Does YOUR<br/>
email work without a telephone line?).<br/>
<br/>
IDIOTS AT WORK:<br/>
<br/>
I was signing the receipt for my credit card purchase when the clerk noticed<br/>
I had never signed my name on the back of the credit card. She informed me<br/>
that she could not complete the transaction unless the card was signed.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked why, she explained that it was necessary to compare the<br/>
signature I had just signed on the receipt.  So I signed the credit card in<br/>
front of her.  She carefully compared the signature to the one I had just<br/>
signed on the receipt.  As luck would have it, they matched.<br/>
<br/>
IDIOTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD:<br/>
<br/>
I live in a semi-rural area.  We recently had a new neighbor call the local<br/>
township administrative office to request the removal of the Deer Crossing<br/>
sign on our road.  The reason:  too many deer were being hit by cars and she<br/>
didn&#39;t want them to cross there anymore.<br/>
<br/>
IDIOTS IN FOOD SERVICE:<br/>
<br/>
My daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco.  She asked the<br/>
person behind the counter for &quot;minimal lettuce.&quot; He said he was sorry, but<br/>
they only had iceberg.<br/>
<br/>
IDIOT SIGHTING #1:<br/>
<br/>
I was at the airport, checking in at the gate when an airport employee<br/>
asked, &quot;Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge?&quot;  To<br/>
which I replied, &quot;If it was without my knowledge, how would I know?&quot;  She<br/>
smiled knowingly and  nodded, &quot;That&#39;s why we ask.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IDIOT SIGHTING #2:<br/>
<br/>
The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it&#39;s safe to cross the street.  I<br/>
was crossing with an intellectectually-challenged coworker of mine when she<br/>
asked if I knew what the buzzer was for.  I explained that it signals blind<br/>
people when the light is red. Appalled, she responded,  &quot;What on earth are<br/>
blind people doing driving?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
IDIOT SIGHTING #3:<br/>
<br/>
At a good-bye luncheon for an old and dear co-worker who is leaving the<br/>
company due to &quot;downsizing,&quot; our manager commented cheerfully, &quot;This is fun.<br/>
We should do this more often.&quot; Not a word was spoken.  We all just looked at<br/>
each other with that deer-in-the-headlights stare.<br/>
<br/>
IDIOT SIGHTING #4:<br/>
<br/>
I work with an individual who plugged her power strip back into itself and<br/>
for the life of her couldn&#39;t understand why her system would not turn on.<br/>
<br/>
IDIOT SIGHTING #5:<br/>
<br/>
When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to pick up our<br/>
car, we were told the keys had been locked in it. We went to the service<br/>
department and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the driver&#39;s<br/>
side door.  As I watched from the passenger side, I instinctively tried the<br/>
door handle and discovered that it was unlocked.  &quot;Hey,&quot; I announced to the<br/>
technician, &quot;It&#39;s open!&quot;  To which he replied, &quot;I know - I already got that<br/>
side.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
NOW DON&#39;T YOU FEEL BETTER? </span></blockquote></div>
