<div id="ygrps-yiv-2079610421">I&#39;m new to the group.  I have been unschooling my boys 7 and 5.  I <br/>
have a friend who has unschooled for many years, who recommended this <br/>
list to me because I kept calling her with concerns about my boys <br/>
watching TV, playing play station and computer games sooooo much (in <br/>
my opinion.)  I feel really worried about it!!  We are about to move <br/>
and we have decided not to have cable or play station move with us.  <br/>
I would really like to understand what exactly it means in <br/>
unschooling to say; as long as the are provided other opportunities <br/>
and you are available to them.  When they are playing computer much <br/>
of the day and then making up games together, I&#39;m busy reading the <br/>
list, doing laundry, nursing the baby,ect...  Unless they ask me for <br/>
help with a dispute or how to make the guy jump on the computer game <br/>
I&#39;m not around.  Is this okay?  Sometimes I see how unschooling <br/>
works; for instance they were playing a Hercules game yesterday, on <br/>
the game they ask questions about what happened in real Greek myths.  <br/>
The game doesn&#39;t answer these questions.  They kept asking me to <br/>
help,  I didn&#39;t know the answers so I asked them if they would like <br/>
to go to the library and get a book about the Greek myths, they <br/>
responded excitedly YES!!  At these times I think whew this is <br/>
leading somewhere educational.  I also see the point that one person <br/>
on the list was talking about pertaining to the child getting to the <br/>
next level.  It would be frustrating to me if someone came in and <br/>
told me to stop doing something when I was right in the middle of it <br/>
and I was really invested in finishing it.  I would really like input <br/>
from you veteran unschoolers about these issues.  TV especially <br/>
concerns me it is so addictive.  I also see a change in their <br/>
behavior after watching TV.  We have talked about it, one of the boys <br/>
sees the change and how he feels after TV viewing the other doesn&#39;t <br/>
see it.  I have another friend who is unschooling little guys, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have TV and lives in the country, when we visit her our boys <br/>
play outside all day happily and creatively.  Her kids seem more <br/>
creative then mine.  What have you found works for your families? <br/>

The games themselves are educational even if they don&#39;t answer all the <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We are about to move <br/>
and we have decided not to have cable or play station move with us.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re sure, another homeschooling family here really wants to buy a used <br/>
playstation.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to www.unschooling.com you can read lots of already-deposited <br/>
discussion about the benefits of computer games and video and movies.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have cable, but we have a TV in every kid&#39;s room (two with VCRs) and <br/>
we don&#39;t limit their use.  And they&#39;re off more than not, by kids&#39; own doing.<br/>
