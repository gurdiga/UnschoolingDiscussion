<div id="ygrps-yiv-152884378">Hello unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
I am Catharine and I have one child, age 3.  We have been wanting to <br/>
HS since he was about 18 months.  We plan more children, if it works <br/>
out.  My husband is very excited about HS and US especially.  It <br/>
seems to suit our style of parenting and flow nicely from it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question.  Do any of you have any research references on <br/>
careers unschooled or HS kids tend to choose when they choose a <br/>
profession or vocation? I have heard that it tends to be the more <br/>
entrepreneurial type careers, and I wondered if the rest of you had <br/>
heard or experienced this as well.  I would *love* a website on HS <br/>
ressearch, if any of you know one.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31011399">Hey Buzz...Did those homeschooled/unschooled kids have to write entrance<br/>
exams to get into their colleges and universities?  Also, does anyone<br/>
know if it is true that universities will take anyone as a &quot;mature<br/>
student&quot; once they are 21+ years old?  Again, are entrance exams<br/>
necessary in those cases?<br/>
<br/>
I need to know.  Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Emily Carr is by portfolio because the artists work is their proof of<br/>
talent for entry.<br/>
The girl who went to UBC I believe only sat through an interview, I&#39;m<br/>
not really sure.<br/>
The boy who is in Okanagan University College for pharmacy tech got in<br/>
using his parents own transcripts of their homeschooling  endeavours. I<br/>
believe he only had to do the standard entry for college test.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best ways I&#39;ve heard of is to find out when SATs or ACTs are<br/>
being held in your area and sit them. Those scores as I understand it,<br/>
over ride any highschool diploma for most universities and colleges.<br/>
