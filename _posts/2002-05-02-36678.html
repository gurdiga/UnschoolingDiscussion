If This is a Staff Meeting, It Must be Social Studies, by Caryn Sobel<br/>
<br/>
Last month, we paid off the debt. I now see a &quot;normal schedule&quot; in my <br/>
near future, and I have finally allowed myself to examine how working <br/>
has affected our home education. Before this, I wouldn&#39;t dwell on the <br/>
subject - we&#39;ve all had that feeling, &quot;If I stand still to examine <br/>
this, it will all fall apart!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;H is for Homeschooling,&quot; by Scott Stevens<br/>
<br/>
P is for Parents who chose to give their children a chance to learn <br/>
differently: Parents who go against the conventional wisdom of family <br/>
and friends, parents who make professional sacrifices to spend the <br/>
short years of childhood with their children, parents who take <br/>
responsibility for educating their children without the financial <br/>
support of government institutions.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is About Families, by Helen Hegener<br/>
<br/>
I watch our kids and grandkids playing together on this Easter <br/>
morning and smile to myself. It&#39;s nice to see them gathered here, <br/>
smiling and laughing, simply enjoying each other&#39;s company. I think <br/>
about how spending time together as families builds foundations for <br/>
the future. The little exchanges which might seem to be mere playing <br/>
around or goofing off are, in actuality, links being forged, threads <br/>
being woven.<br/>
<br/>
Problems with Putting Public E-Schools in Homes, by Larry and Susan Kaseman<br/>
<br/>
We need to establish and maintain the distinction between homeschools <br/>
and cyber charter schools, in the media and in the general public&#39;s <br/>
understanding. This will be easier to do if there is a short and <br/>
distinct name for cyber charter schools. We propose that they be <br/>
called public e-schools, with e- standing for electronic as in <br/>
e-mail, e-commerce, etc.<br/>
