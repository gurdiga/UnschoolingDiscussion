Another annoying thing about that is that the sex on TV is always between<br/>
unmarried people.  Now, I am not a prude, but my point is that the ONLY<br/>
sex on TV is illicit sex.  How about a show showing a married couple<br/>
making out?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698168748">That really saddens me, cos I&#39;ve always loved the show, but don&#39;t <br/>
get to see it now cos it&#39;s on a digital channel which we can&#39;t get <br/>
yet :-(  Though sometimes they&#39;ve got up my nose, like with Carol <br/>
working when she had the twins, she didn&#39;t want to and no-one <br/>
said &#39;well you don&#39;t have to.&#39;  At least they showed her pumping <br/>
milk once or twice...<br/>
<br/>
Ah, well, maybe I&#39;m better off without if this is what they&#39;re doing...<br/>

The point I was trying to make is that tv shows plenty of sexual<br/>
involvement between unmarried people, but not much between married<br/>
couples.  And it&#39;s not just kissing - there is plenty of hopping in and<br/>
out of bed.  It certainly sends young people a mixed message.  &quot;Illicit&quot;<br/>
means &quot;not allowed by law or custom&quot;.  Isn&#39;t this what our society TELLS <br/>
young people?: &quot;Only people married to each other should be sexually<br/>
active&quot;.  Obviously, the reality is much different though.  Maybe I<br/>
should have just said, &quot;the sex on TV seems to be mostly between<br/>
unmarried people&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I think of it, people without children might have more time and<br/>
energy for sex anyway.  So maybe TV is more realistic than I&#39;d thought it<br/>
was!  Or maybe those married couples should spend less time watching TV<br/>
and more time...<br/>
<br/>
OK, I&#39;ll quit now.<br/>

**Touché, Mary Ellen. Very nicely handled. With my and my husband&#39;s extended<br/>
family, there are many built-in real life lessons for my children to learn<br/>
from (I hope). I have been accused of having a life like a soap opera. How<br/>
many other people have 7 parents?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why we watch cartoons instead. At least we know it&#39;s *supposed* to be<br/>
unbelievable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860524352">I think your point is a good one Mary Ellen.  They made the mother a monster <br/>
because she made an informed decision about immunizing her children, and in <br/>
the end her son dies.  (That still bothers me, didn&#39;t kids get measles all <br/>
of the time years ago, and only a few of them died because of poor <br/>
conditions to begin with?)<br/>
<br/>
But they show bed hopping on a regular basis as something that is normal.<br/>
<br/>
To be fair though, ER has touched on all the hot topics involving sex.  <br/>
Jeannie got AIDS, and Dr. Benton had a scare with that.  Ying (can&#39;t <br/>
remember her name) got pregnant, gave baby up for adoption.<br/>
