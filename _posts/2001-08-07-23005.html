<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839666725">for anyone interested in Ohio, my neighbor is selling her house it has 6 bedrooms if you count the 2 they made in the basement (well done) 2 baths, kitchen , dinningroom, livingroom, deck , pool, jaccusi, 2 1/2 car garage <br/>
for $115,000-- they also have 2 dogs they need to find homes for.<br/>
an unfortunate series of events has caused them to need to sell and they want to get out soon so if you or anyone you know would like more info let me know and I will see what I can do <br/>
oh yeah the house is in Brewster Ohio that is south of Massillon on st. rt. 93 if you look on a map it would be near where 30 & I-77 come together just south west of that.<br/>
<br/>
right in Amish country in a small town <br/>
