<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411230623">Got an e-mail. GOOD!!  Here, I&#39;ll share it:<br/>
<br/>
Hey there!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to drop a quick note to let you know what is going on.<br/>
<br/>
The modem in my old computer is dead! It&#39;s  a proprietary part so very <br/>
expensive to replace. I found a newer old computer, and paid only $20 at the <br/>
surplus place for the schools.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if I can come up with $200 to have him get that one up and running <br/>
then I should be back online next week sometime. I&#39;m really missing everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Had my oral surgery on Thursday, still puffy and bruised but feeling a lot <br/>
better today.<br/>
<br/>
Celebrated my Birthday yesterday and all is well.<br/>
<br/>
Take care, I&#39;ll be back soon. :)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
Ren</div>
