**** What really irks me is that because I let my kids do this, other <br/>
parents look at me like I&#39;m &quot;white trash&quot;.<br/>
Its insulting to me because giving my kids these freedoms was a <br/>
struggle, with a lot of thinking and researching, and wrestling and <br/>
talking and negotiating. <br/>
<br/>
On the surface, it might appear that my kids have freedom like the <br/>
other kids (whose parents don&#39;t care). But underneath it, my kids <br/>
have a mom who is right in the thick of it WITH them...not passed out <br/>
on the sofa drunk as a skunk! *****<br/>
<br/>
I think this is difficult to explain to others about unschooling but <br/>
even more difficult to explain about mindful parenting. It sounds <br/>
like we don&#39;t DO anything. But what we do requires much more<br/>
thought and contemplation and research and stretching and effort and <br/>
time and trust than simply ensuring rules are being followed.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids have freedom.  <br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t victims of neglect.  <br/>
<br/>
Big difference. . . . <br/>

**** The pudding&#39;s just not done yet  ****<br/>

Many parents in our society have a pudding that cooks for 18 years <br/>
and then POOF (sigh of relief) - it&#39;s done.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784664307">Yeah, when I used the pudding analogy, I was trying to think about how to relate it to the difference between us and others.<br/>
<br/>
I think we used the cooked kind of pudding.<br/>
<br/>
You have to go back and nurse it along every now and agatin...checking on it so it doesn&#39;t burn.<br/>
<br/>
I think the others use the instant 5 minute mix &lt;beg&gt;.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lots of moms will cite parents that were &quot;permissive&quot; in their childhoods, then they talk <br/>
about how they regret being &quot;allowed&quot; to do whatever they wanted and so they won&#39;t make <br/>
that mistake with their children.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up under those conditions - free to do whatever I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I responded to my kids by trying to create structure and rules that would ensure their <br/>
safety and my involvement.<br/>
<br/>
What flipped over for me after years of homeschooling is that I realized *I* was really <br/>
different than my parents. I&#39;m totally involved in my kids&#39; lives every second. &quot;Allowing&quot; <br/>
them the freedom to decide for themselves isn&#39;t neglect, in my home, as it was in my <br/>
parents&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
There are very few examples (I only know of them through this list and one other place) of <br/>
people practicing the kind of attentive, mindful parenting that we try to support here. So <br/>
what the debate boils down to usually is control versus neglect.<br/>
<br/>
But instead, I like to think of this style of parenting as:<br/>
<br/>
involved<br/>
engaged<br/>
time spent together<br/>
support<br/>
dialog<br/>
<br/>
Really being there fully - not dependent on predetermined rules for assurance of good <br/>
parenting and not ignoring warning signs for fear of upsetting the child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169152021">Good points!<br/>
Too often people say &quot;I&#39;m really involved in my child&#39;s life&quot; means &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
controlling it as much as I can, from the other room, by telling her when to do <br/>
her homework, how much TV she can watch, and to go to bed.&quot;<br/>
