children will enjoy it too.<br/>

Have you ever noticed how stupid the bad guys are in movies and video games?<br/>
Like, they have to stop and chat with James Bond and let him see everything<br/>
they&#39;re doing before they kill him?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the movie Dogma (one of my current favorites) the bad guy actually says<br/>
something like &quot;I&#39;m not telling you my plan - I&#39;ve seen too many Bond movies.&quot;<br/>
(This is after he&#39;s captured all the people trying to stop his plan.)<br/>
I find a number of the lines in there to be great ones!<br/>
