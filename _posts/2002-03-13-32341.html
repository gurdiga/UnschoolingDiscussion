<div id="ygrps-yiv-385108992">Are you sure you don&#39;t live with my family????  I have this problem with my<br/>
boys....constantly.  They love the dogs, but for whatever reason will not<br/>
feed them unless prompted and then told to by their father or myself.  I<br/>
don&#39;t understand it, but that is the way it is..  They will not feed the<br/>
dogs unless we make them.. So yes, I would also have dead animals if i did<br/>
not have set rules that the dogs must be fed... before the boys eat lunch..<br/>
It is the only thing we have found that will work.<br/>

&lt;While I am a big animal lover no one else here is, &lt;some people are just<br/>
not<br/>
&lt;animal lovers. They do not hate animals, just &lt;are ,,very indifferent. So<br/>
yes,<br/>
&lt;the animals literally would starve if I did not &lt;remind or do it myself.<br/>
&lt;Yes, caring is enough for me but no, it is not for &lt;the rest of the family.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452502858">Perhaps it&#39;s a &quot;male&quot; thing because none of my brothers liked feeding the<br/>
animals either (we lived on a huge farm = lots of animals to feed). I, on<br/>
the other hand, loved feeding the animals and although it would take me<br/>
hours because I had to spend time with each and every one dad always knew<br/>
they&#39;d be fed. I used to think the guys were just heartless but now I&#39;m<br/>
seriously starting to wonder if it&#39;s just a male thing, maybe they don&#39;t<br/>
become attached to animals like we do?<br/>
Maybe I should hope for a girl next time? LOL   Nah!! LOL<br/>
