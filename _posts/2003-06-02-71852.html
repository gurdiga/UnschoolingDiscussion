&gt; My<br/>
&gt; sister had the idea when she went for a visit of singing some of the songs<br/>
&gt; we all used to sing as a family, and it seemed to go over well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know this isn&#39;t useful for your question, but when my Mom was dying, we did <br/>
that.<br/>
Sang some hymns from the church we were raised in  and even had some violin <br/>
playing. Two of the boys that had attended her storytimes as young children <br/>
came up to her room and played lovely music...they also played at her funeral, <br/>
very sweet.<br/>
My cousin also played violin for her. It was such a nice thing to have in <br/>
that dreary hospital room, and brought us all together in a wonderful way.<br/>
I think it&#39;s a great idea.<br/>
