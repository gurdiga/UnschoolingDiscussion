<div id="ygrps-yiv-133172929">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Something really interesting happened yesterday.  I thought I would <br/>
share it with you.  I have 7-year-old fraternal twin boys named Leroy <br/>
and Paul.  In every way, they are very different from eachother.  This <br/>
post is about Leroy.  We call him &quot;Action Baby&quot; because he is a very <br/>
physical, athletic, and kinetic sort of little boy.  He is also very <br/>
verbal and asks a multitude of questions about everything all the time.  <br/>
He&#39;s incredibly curious.  Leroy requires a LOT of attention in many <br/>
different ways.  He is also a Juvenile Diabetic which involves between 4 <br/>
and 10 blood tests and 3 insulin injections on a daily basis, a pretty <br/>
rigid eating schedule, counting carbohydrates, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Last week we installed a new pretty blue iMac right next to the <br/>
kitchen.  It is officially &quot;my&quot; computer.  I love it.  I am also fairly <br/>
new to this list.  I had heard about it for a couple of years but only <br/>
joined about 2 weeks ago.  Well, you can imagine what happened.  The <br/>
last few days, especially yesterday, I became totally engrossed with my <br/>
new toy and this list, of course.  I was online for hours.  I wanted to <br/>
reply to everything.  This is not like me, but, I couldn&#39;t help myself.  <br/>
I was pretty unavailable to everyone.  I don&#39;t mean to say that I <br/>
totally ignored Leroy and told him to go away and not answer all his <br/>
questions, etc.  I was just very occupied with this computer and he did <br/>
not have my full attention.  I normally interact with my boys, <br/>
especially Leroy, almost all day long because that is what he asks for <br/>
and, therefore, requires.<br/>
<br/>
Well, last night, Leroy let me know, loud and clear, he did not like <br/>
this at all.  For a couple of hours, he was pretty upset.  He cried most <br/>
of the time and he was angry.  I think this is a very good example of <br/>
how certain children can get very upset when they know they are being <br/>
ignored, or maybe even not the center of their mother&#39;s/father&#39;s <br/>
attention, for very long periods of time (hours).  He has never been so <br/>
upset for such a long time before.<br/>
<br/>
Boy, did I learn a lesson.  I thoroughly enjoy this list, but there&#39;s no <br/>
way I&#39;ll be able to read all these messages or reply and all of those I <br/>
wish to.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what?!  I gotta go.  Leroy needs me.<br/>

storm--hubby watches tv, kidlets are outside or with friends or reading a<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Something really interesting happened yesterday.  I thought I would<br/>
&gt; &gt;   share it with you.  I have 7-year-old fraternal twin boys named Leroy<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and Paul.  In every way, they are very different from eachother.  This<br/>

&gt; &gt; time.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   He&#39;s incredibly curious.  Leroy requires a LOT of attention in many<br/>
&gt; &gt;   different ways.  He is also a Juvenile Diabetic which involves<br/>
&gt; &gt; between 4<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and 10 blood tests and 3 insulin injections on a daily basis, a pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt;   rigid eating schedule, counting carbohydrates, etc.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Last week we installed a new pretty blue iMac right next to the<br/>

&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt;   reply to everything.  This is not like me, but, I couldn&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I was pretty unavailable to everyone.  I don&#39;t mean to say that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;   totally ignored Leroy and told him to go away and not answer all his<br/>
&gt; &gt;   questions, etc.  I was just very occupied with this computer and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; did<br/>
&gt; &gt;   not have my full attention.  I normally interact with my boys,<br/>
&gt; &gt;   especially Leroy, almost all day long because that is what he asks for<br/>
&gt; &gt;   and, therefore, requires.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Well, last night, Leroy let me know, loud and clear, he did not like<br/>
&gt; &gt;   this at all.  For a couple of hours, he was pretty upset.  He cried<br/>
&gt; &gt; most<br/>
&gt; &gt;   of the time and he was angry.  I think this is a very good example of<br/>
&gt; &gt;   how certain children can get very upset when they know they are being<br/>

&gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt;   upset for such a long time before.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   Boy, did I learn a lesson.  I thoroughly enjoy this list, but there&#39;s<br/>
