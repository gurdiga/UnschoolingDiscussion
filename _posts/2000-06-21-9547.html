<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591211936">Hi, I&#39;m a newbie, and I&#39;ve been lurking for about 1 week, but I felt I had<br/>
to come on line to talk to the woman who wants to find work and homeschool.<br/>
I run a small school/daycare at my home, and it would support me and my<br/>
two kids, if I had a smaller mortgage, dh is helping to take care of that.<br/>
<br/>
  You would have to look into the regulations where you are, Here in<br/>
Toronto, I am allowed to take in up to 5 children legally INCLUDING MY OWN<br/>
KIDS.  I am able to get about $200/week per child, so living frugally, that<br/>
would be managable.  Toronto has a fairly high cost of living, but I can<br/>
also charge more.  You woud have to phone around other care givers in your<br/>
neighbourhood.  It does have a real impact on how much outside activity you<br/>
can do, as I don&#39;t have a car, and wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable driving other<br/>
people&#39;s kids, but there are always evenings and weekends.  I also have<br/>
heard of people who offer to homeschool other people&#39;s kids for a fee,<br/>
which may be viable for you.  It also means you would get older kids.<br/>
Before and after school care is also an option, and not so time consuming.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I may as well introduce myself now.  My name is christine, and I have two<br/>
little girls, 4 and 1.  I am by profession a Montessori teacher, hence my<br/>
current occupation.  We are unschooling my children, and it I have found it<br/>
amazing to look at Maria Montessori&#39;s writings from that unschooling angle.<br/>
As I am sure many of you out there have already firgured out, thee isn&#39;t<br/>
alot of difference.<br/>
Gotta go make dinner.  Good luck with finding work that will help you out.</div>

Hi Christine-<br>
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s so interesting that you were a Montesorri teacher. I&#39;ve never read any books on that style, but I do plan to. Sounds as if one just led naturally to the other for you. Glad you&#39;ve found a work situation that complements your unschooling.<br>
