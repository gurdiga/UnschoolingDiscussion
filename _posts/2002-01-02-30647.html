saying that coming home at an *acceptable* hour doesn&#39;t indicate a more <br/>
virtuous person than coming home at the wee hours of the morning <br/>
indicates promiscuity.<br/>

Trusting your child&#39;s choices will allow them to feel secure enough to <br/>
make decent ones when they are free to choose.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603707785">+ Wouldn&#39;t it be better to help them make good choices and<br/>
+ lay the burden of responsibility on them?<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s beneficial to point out, I think, that responsibility IS a burden.<br/>
If you think someone else is going to stay in control of a situation and<br/>
tell you right from wrong all the time, then you don&#39;t have to think for<br/>
yourself or figure out your own value system.<br/>
<br/>
I tell my kids sometimes when they&#39;re trying to make a difficult decision<br/>
that if it is too much responsibility for them, then I will make the<br/>
decision FOR them.  Not as a punishment, but as a relief from the burden.<br/>
For example, once when my son was being teased about being homeschooled on<br/>
his baseball team, we discussed his options (quitting, ignoring it,<br/>
discussing it w/ the coach, etc.) and then I expressed my confidence in his<br/>
ability to make a good decision about it.  When he was still struggling with<br/>
it later, I told him that if he wanted me to make a decision for him, I<br/>
would.  But he decided he could do it for himself and he did.  And he<br/>
handled it better than I would have been able to.<br/>
<br/>
But it is these accumulated successes that give the confidence to handle the<br/>
more difficult situations.<br/>
