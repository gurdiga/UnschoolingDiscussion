<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054779241">Someone asked:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Could you actually skip 3 grades and not have anyone from the state knocking<br/>
&gt;&gt; on your door asking why you have never tested your child??   I am not very<br/>
&gt;&gt; good at intentionally &#39;breaking the rules&#39; so I guess this is why I would be<br/>
&gt;&gt; hesitant to do it.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned comments:<br/>
<br/>
First, you will not be &quot;breaking the rules&quot; -- ask to see the rules, and you<br/>
will probably know that. Make them put everything in writing; rules, laws,<br/>
everything. If they don&#39;t, you&#39;re not obligated, and if you&#39;re not obligated<br/>
by law, don&#39;t do it. I believe that it&#39;s our duty to refuse and reject bad<br/>
rules and bad laws.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is watching, they will be suspicious if you hold a kid back one<br/>
year and then skip a grade the next, but SO WHAT... it is your right to do<br/>
so and it is not their right to doubt your methods or motives.<br/>
<br/>
It is, in fact, a game of control -- they want to control everybody. Ask<br/>
about what happens to parents who refuse to have their kid take the<br/>
test...exactly.  Ask what happens to kids who do extremely poorly on it --<br/>
say, on purpose...<br/>
<br/>
There are NO advantages to homeschoolers from taking these tests. All the<br/>
advantages (so called) are for the schools.<br/>
<br/>
 ALL INFORMATION THE GOVERNMENT GATHERS ABOUT<br/>
HOMESCHOOLERS WILL BE USED AGAINST HOMESCHOOLING.<br/>
<br/>
You need information from the schools:<br/>
  Ask, What is their purpose for the testing? What is their expectation for<br/>
children who take it? Do all the children in the school system take them?<br/>
Who scores the tests? How long do they take to return the test and the<br/>
results to you? (they probably don&#39;t)  Do they return the test to you with<br/>
the correct answers marked and any mistakes noted? (most likely not)  If<br/>
not, then what good is it to you as your child&#39;s teacher, and what good was<br/>
the test to the child if s/he never finds out the right answers and which<br/>
questions were missed? (none, it wasted time and worry for nothing)<br/>
<br/>
If the testing benefits only the school, and they can&#39;t give you a benefit<br/>
for your child, then it has no value and should not be used.<br/>
<br/>
The state does not demand that its students &quot;pass&quot; any tests, therefore it<br/>
has no business even asking your child to take a test (let alone pass it),<br/>
especially since he is not on the same learning track.<br/>
<br/>
May you, please, see the scores that are achieved by all students? Why not?<br/>
- If not, how will you know where your child fits in the matrix of all<br/>
children? What score is considered passing?  What are the consequences of<br/>
not getting a passing score if the kid is IN school? What are the<br/>
consequences for those who homeschool? (exactly, please)<br/>
<br/>
Who will see the scores? How will they be used? Will the school let you (the<br/>
parent) administer the test, and keep the score only for your own<br/>
information? Why not? Whose business is it, and why? What will they do with<br/>
it, and why?  What other information is on the test, such as parents&#39; names,<br/>
family income, residence, occupation, own guns? What religion/ What race?<br/>
Are there psychological profiling questions on the test? (yes) What are<br/>
those used for? <br/>
<br/>
The tests are to rate the schools, not the children. The scores (generated<br/>
by machines or a distant marking service of suspicious integrity) are used<br/>
to tell the state dept. of ed. which schools are performing better/worse<br/>
than others in order to justify giving them all more of our tax money. Yeah,<br/>
they get it for doing poorly (they &quot;need&quot; more money; and they get it for<br/>
going &quot;well&quot; because they &quot;deserve&quot; more money. Either way, they get more<br/>
money....such a deal.....crime pays !<br/>
<br/>
The tests are used to create the illusion that the public schools are<br/>
educating children, when they are not. The schools&#39; single purpose is to<br/>
control people and money. Testing of this sort is a scam that&#39;s run by<br/>
testing services hand in hand with those who make a living &quot;doing school&quot; to<br/>
people -- teachers, administrators and their unions.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the answers that you will get to the above questions are sure to be<br/>
untrue, and reveal that the system is fraudulent in every detail.<br/>
