&lt;&lt; I recently discovered I have  hypoglycemia,<br/>

have to eat regularly.  Can you explain to me why cooking without sugar helps <br/>
you?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Hi Nanci,  As you might already know, hypoglycemia  is  when a person has <br/>
low blood sugar.  When the blood sugar  is low, it can cause  many symptoms <br/>
such as headaches, irritability, temper outbursts, fatigue, trouble sleeping, <br/>
constant hunger, digestive problems, inability to concentrate, bruising <br/>
easily, abdominal bloating, mood swings, excessive worrying,  anxiety, <br/>
nightmares, phobias, visual trouble, allergies, itchy skin, and  a need to <br/>
sigh and yawn.   There are othersigns, too...  but this is off the top of my <br/>
head.  Not everyone will have all of the symptoms, and most everyone has some <br/>
of these some of the time.  A person with LBS will have some or almost all of <br/>
the signs the majority of the time., not just once in a while.  Consuming <br/>
things with sugar in them aggrevates the condition and will likely  worsen <br/>
the symptoms over time.  Sugar causes the pancreas to pour more insulin in <br/>
the blood stream.  This is out of balance for a person with LBS, and it <br/>
causes a chemical reaction in the brain and body, which manifests itself in <br/>
these symptoms.  Omitting sugars, honey, molasses, white bread, and all white <br/>
flour products gets the blood sugar level regulated, in conjunction with a <br/>
diet of complex carbohydrates, and protein.  I have  found that over the last <br/>
5 weeks I am feeling so much better.  I did have some &quot;withdrawals&quot; at first <br/>
from the lack of sugar, but it is getting better and better; mostly I am so <br/>
glad to be feeling so much better and sleeping so much better!  Well, sorry <br/>
to have  written you an essay, but if you have any other questions that  I <br/>
might be able to help you with, don&#39;t hesitate to write!  :)                    <br/>

&lt;&lt; How were you diagnosed with this?  I have suspected that I have this for a <br/>
number of years, but due to a &quot;doctor phobia&quot; have not sought treatment &gt;&gt;<br/>
                                                                                <br/>
        Hi -- To be diagnosed with LBS, some doctors will want to do a <br/>
Glucose tolerance test, but many will not, as reading the results accurately <br/>
is not always easy.  My doctor reviewed my symptoms first.  I also always <br/>
thought I had signs of LBS, but had no idea that I had so many signs.  Then I <br/>
began changing my diet to see if it helped alleviate symptoms.  I&#39;ve got my <br/>
copy of The Low Blood Sugar Handbook in front of me now, so I will list the <br/>
symptoms  for you:  tiredness, headaches, drowsiness, concentration problems, <br/>
irritability, sleeping difficulties, dizziness, anxiety, forgetfulness, <br/>
visual disturbances, depression, fainting, cold hands and feet, nervousness, <br/>
exhaustion, shortness of breath, temper outbursts, sensitivity to light and <br/>
noise, allergies, muscle pains, phobias, crying spells, antisocial <br/>
/asocial/unsocial behavior, suicidal thoughts, staggering, craving for <br/>
sweets, unnecessary/excessive worrying, mood swings, nightmares, digestive <br/>
problems, aching eye sockets, lack of sex drive, impotence, indecisiveness, <br/>
heart palpitations, internal trembling. mental confusion, undue sweating, bad <br/>
breath, negative thoughts and attitudes, obesity, restlessness, sneezing, <br/>
waking tired and exhausted, arms/legs/body hurts when first rising in the <br/>
a.m., feel best after 7 p.m.,gasping for breath/sighing/yawning, pms,&quot;motor <br/>
mouth&quot;- constant talking,hand tremors, accident prone..................Now <br/>
this is quite a list.  It says in the book,&quot;It is not so important how many <br/>
symptoms you have but rather how often they occur, how severe they are, and <br/>
how long they last.  Our findings are that those who have hypoglycemia <br/>
usually have approx. 20-40 symptoms ocurring on a reg. basis until they are <br/>
on a proper program and their blood sugar is regulated.  However, if you have <br/>
only a few symptoms and they are persistent you may have LBS.&quot;   I thought I <br/>
was having post partum  anxiety, and I also began having more and more <br/>
trouble digesting starchy foods;  I was constantly worried and fearful, and I <br/>
had several other signs ,too, and have had some of them for many years.   I, <br/>
too, have  &quot;white coat &quot; phobia, and am so grateful to have a doctor that <br/>
puts me at ease.  Well, I have written another essay--sorry!  You might want <br/>
to check this book out at your library,  it&#39;s by Ed and Patricia Krimmel.       <br/>
                                                                                <br/>

 Thanks.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the way it was for me, too.  I know that this runs in my family, so I <br/>
am already trying to eliminate or at least greatly reduce refined sugars from <br/>
my kids&#39; diets, too.  With the western diet as it is, the authors of the Low <br/>
Blood Sugar Handbook assert that the numbers of people who potentially have <br/>
LBS is staggering.  The other book I have is from the library, called the <br/>
Hypoglycemia/Diabetic Cope Book, by Freda Whalen, CN, RMT.    Here is the <br/>
list from her book:  can&#39;t concentrate or make decisions, can&#39;t get started <br/>
in the a.m., can&#39;t work well under pressure, consumes excessive <br/>
alcohol,craves candy-soda-coffee in between meals,cry easily/feels like <br/>
crying inside,depressed, drinks more than 3 c of coffee/soda a day, eats <br/>
candy/cake or drinks soda daily, eats bread-pasta-potatoes-rice-beans, eats <br/>
when nervous, eats w/o being hungry, fearful, feel insecure/low self <br/>
image,fits of anger,headaches, highly emotional.hungry between meals or at <br/>
night, insomnia/waking with inability to go back to sleep,lack of energy, <br/>
magnify insignificant details, moody, poor memory, reduced initiative, sleepy <br/>
during the day, drowsy after meals,tired most of time, worry frequently, <br/>
allergies:asthma, hay fever skin rash, sinus trouble,bad dreams, bleeding <br/>
gums, blurred vision, bored, bruise easily, cold hands/feet yr round, <br/>
convulsions, dizziness/lightheadedness, fatigue relieved by eating, feel <br/>
faint if meal delayed, get shaky when hungry, hallucinations, having the need <br/>
to sigh, heart palpitations, irritable before meals, muscle twitching/cramps, <br/>
phobias, reduced sex drive, skin aches or itches, stomach cramps-&quot;nervous <br/>
stomach&quot;, suicidal thoughts-feelings of hopelessness, sweating excessively, <br/>
trembling of hands, ulcers-gastritis-chronic indigestion-abdominal bloating, <br/>
uncoordinated-dropping or bumping into things,unsocial/antisocial behavior.   <br/>
 Again, it is not that a person with LBS would  have every thing listed;and <br/>
also, most people have some of these from time to time.  It is just when <br/>
there are symptoms that persist over time and maybe also increase over time, <br/>
that it may indicate that the blood sugar is out of balance.  A blood sugar <br/>
condition like this affects the nervous sys. first, and that is why there are <br/>
so many symptoms of that nature.  Eating a diet free from refined sugars <br/>
helps to stabilize the sugar, thus alleviating the symptoms.    Hope this <br/>
helps! :)       ~Karen in Ind</div>

<br/>
Well I have about 45 symptoms from this list, most of them on a daily basis.  I also have about 40 symptoms from the list that Karen originally sent from the LBS Handbook.  I guess some Medical work and dietary changes are in order.  Although I must be truly addicted, because the thought of giving up sugars is really frightening to me.  Perhaps I could just drastically reduce them, and not give them up entirely.  At any rate, I&#39;m sure that this will be a process and not a &quot;cold turkey&quot; thing.  Wish me luck.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
