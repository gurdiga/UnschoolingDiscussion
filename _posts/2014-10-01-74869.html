<div id="ygrps-yiv-924072508">~ My son, Finn, age 10, loves to write in his diary.&nbsp; He uses a notebook.&nbsp;
 Yesterday, my husband picked up a notebook and flipped through it to 
see whether it was used or new so that he might use it. ~<br><br>The first thing I thought about is how a diary is supposed to be private. If he uses just any old notebook and any old notebook is free for anyone to use, then it&#39;s not private. Perhaps help him label or identify his personal writings, so that mistake is not made again.<br><br>This makes me think about something that happened to me when I was a young teen. I was just starting to become sexually active. I hadn&#39;t actually had sex yet, but was thinking about it, giggling about it with my girlfriends. I had a friend who lived on the other side of the country and we wrote each other every week. We liked to play tricks on each other, sometimes to see how we could shock each other. So I wrote a letter saying I was pregnant. I had left a draft of it in my room. My mother decided it was okay for her to read my private writing when she cleaned up my room (like the police find things &quot;in plain sight&quot;). Then all hell broke loose. She got my older sister involved and they alternately cried and interrogated me. I had to swear it wasn&#39;t true (and it wasn&#39;t). It left me unable to talk about anything to do with sexuality with either of them. I wondered what would have happened if I actually had been pregnant. Holy cow.<br><br>I wonder why your husband thinks your son&#39;s friends parents would even have the opportunity to see his personal diary? I don&#39;t imagine your son is planning to show them. Young boys might talk about sex, imagine what sex is like, but mostly they don&#39;t do it around their parents!<br><br>It&#39;s possible he came across porn online. It could be a good opportunity to address it, but if he resists talking, you could write him a note. My daughter was much more amenable to reading what I had to say, because she could do it in her own time without feeling she was being confronted (then feeling embarrassed).<br><br>This page might be helpful in sorting out your feelings and what to do: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/sex">http://sandradodd.com/sex</a><br><br>Robin B.<br><p> &nbsp;</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354783417">I had a similar experience to what Robin described. I was about 12, my mother found my locked, hidden diary and read about what the kids were doing at school, me just beginning to find boys remotely attractive, and how I felt about all of it. It was innocent enough, but she was derisive, condescending and accusatory.<div>I learned alot about our family, our home that day and where best to place my trust and vulnerabilities in the future. I also promised myself to never be that way with my own kids.</div><div>I have three daughters, and the oldest is frequently composing poems and drawings. We also have many, many sketchpads and notebooks out at any time. Just a few days ago, the wind blew a page out, the two youngest picked it up and opened it to see if it was trash,etc. They got the title of a poem about one of our cats and began to giggle and read on. My eldest, the author, was busy in another room. I intervened and reminded them that they value their own privacy, and they would want me to remind others in a similar situation. They closed it and asked her for permission, she said no and they reluctantly tucked it away again, only saying that maybe she should keep private things better hidden...and that was the end of it.&nbsp;</div><div>I really believe that your son knowing you are on his team, you are safe and reliably trustworthy is much more important than getting to the bottom of the images you found. Yes, I would be shocked and concerned as well. I would probably make a mental note to notice what is going on around us more, to look for sources (you mentioned dogs and goats) and make to myself as safe, open and loving as possible for him to ask those awkward things should he ever want to.&nbsp;</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230802527"><div dir="ltr"><div><br></div>I did mention that it was controversial and thought provoking. ;) <div>I am not recommending it as a &quot;how to&quot;, but an interesting look at this subject. If you read the book, you will see that it is more complex than that. The reason I thought it was &quot;somewhat inline with unschooling ideas&quot; is because it leans toward respecting children and their ability to understand more than most people give them credit for. For instance, the idea was brought up that we, as parents, could be more open with the fact that we have sex. That it is a normal part of a loving marriage and that it should not necessarily be so hidden and treated as taboo. Not having it in front of them , but simply not tippy-toeing around the idea when discussing it. If you are easily offended by controversial ideas then you might want to avoid this book. I just found it fascinating, whether I agreed with everything in it or not. I thought it was worth the read. But then I like things that challenge me to think about my values and why I do what I do. Sometimes because it sparks a change, sometimes because it clarifies the meaning or reason behind my decisions. At any rate, I hope you enjoy the ride. :) <div><br></div><div>Jorie</div></div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-230802527gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-230802527gmail_quote">On Wed, Oct 8, 2014 at 4:42 PM, BRIAN POLIKOWSKY <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:polykowholsteins@...">polykowholsteins@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-230802527gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

One of the reviews says, &quot;At no time did the Doctor advocate, hint to, suggest, or other wise condone adults having sex with children.

The reviews on a book&#39;s main page only show a piece of each if they&#39;re long. If you click on &quot;5 stars&quot; or &quot;4 star&quot; next to the bar graph that will open up a page with the full reviews. That makes it easier to search for &quot;pedophilia&quot; to see what&#39;s said about it. (Note: there are 4 pages of 5 star reviews.) None of the 5 star reviewers that I read sound like pedophiles.<br/>
