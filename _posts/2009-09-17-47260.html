<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551913197">Hi group,<br/>
<br/>
I am experiencing some internal conflict. I&#39;m a feminist who&#39;s very passionate about women&#39;s rights and I do a fair amount of reading on the subject (both Australian and international.) I have also come out of an abusive relationship so am sensitive and personally connected to issues like domestic violence. I want my children to develop a healthy feminist critique and to be aware and to care about the abuse of women&#39;s rights (and to care about it), but I also want to be a fun parent, and I want our home life to be fun and positive.<br/>
<br/>
 I am wondering how to balance this. My children are still young, but as they get older, what are appropriate ways to approach these subjects? Right now I am doing the obvious things like encouraging them to persue what they enjoy, not what society deems appropriate for their sex, being aware of my language, ensuring they have access to a wide range of books, toys and clothes that don&#39;t perpetuate stereotypes. <br/>
<br/>
But I sway between feeling anger and a criticism (of concepts and attitudes) as healthy and important, then wondering if they&#39;re counter-intuitive to creating a warm, happy nest which I want for them. I would like some tips, if anyone has any, on helping them develop a social conscience and the passion to change things, without me coming across as a negative, cynical person. I guess it&#39;s also about being genuine, speaking honestly, but doing it in age appropriate ways and ways that won&#39;t stifle their optimism and joy. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>
Kerrie from Australia.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-452684690">I am a committed vegetarian, but I buy and cook organic meat for my kids because I don&#39;t want my personal ideology to override their enjoyment of and need for good quality protein.  In the same way, I don&#39;t think you should try to make your kids passionate about the same issues you hold dear.  If you live a principled life, your kids will respect your integrity, but they won&#39;t necessarily take up the same cause.  After all, it was a specific set of circumstances (including what must have been a horrible experience of domestic violence) that led you to hold the values you hold.  Your kids&#39; experiences will be different, and so with your example they may come to be passionate about an issue equally as important as women&#39;s rights.<br/>
<br/>
The key here is that although you can guide children as they develop their own moral framework, ultimately they will only become passionate about something they have chosen themselves.</div>

writes about her definitely feminist beliefs in the context of being an <br/>
unschooling mom.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt; I am doing the obvious things like encouraging them to persue what they <br/>
enjoy, not what society deems appropriate for their sex, being aware of my <br/>
language, ensuring they have access to a wide range of books, toys and <br/>
clothes that don&#39;t perpetuate stereotypes.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Having a daughter gave me a much greater appreciation for the &quot;nature&quot; side <br/>
of that supposedly old question of nature vs nurture. She is such a girly <br/>
girl in her attitudes and desires and tastes.<br/>
<br/>
I have no fear of any outside (ie outside our family) force of the media or <br/>
our culture that might be perpetuating stereotypes impacting Jayn in any <br/>
significant way. Not only do I believe that I am stronger than these, and <br/>
that my dd is stronger than these, I also believe that our family is <br/>
stronger. There is no product, image, toy, item, story, tv show, movie, or <br/>
philosophy that is stronger than us and our own principles and how Jayn is <br/>
treated in our home.<br/>
<br/>
Chances are that any time I feel called to expound a critique of some <br/>
product, idea, see-the-list-above, I am met with eye rolling and either &quot;I <br/>
know&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t care.&quot; Jayn doesn&#39;t see the negativity of a world filled <br/>
with stereotypes or dangers to be avoided.<br/>
<br/>
I have found it better to focus on what is positive and good and interesting <br/>
about stuff, than on trying to avoid some idea.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I sway between feeling anger and a criticism (of concepts and <br/>
attitudes) as healthy and important, then wondering if they&#39;re <br/>
counter-intuitive to creating a warm, happy nest which I want for them. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would say that anger is always counter-*productive* to a warm, happy nest. <br/>
Peace, warmth, happiness, calm begin in the home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t make it about changing them. Make it about you. Follow your  <br/>
passions as you can without depriving them. Talk about what&#39;s  <br/>
important to you when it comes up.<br/>
<br/>
Invite them along if you&#39;re doing something you think they might  <br/>
enjoy helping with.<br/>
<br/>
My husband does sports programs for seniors and for visually impaired  <br/>
kids. He invited Kathryn along when he thought it might be fun for  <br/>
her and when she could give him some real help. But there was no  <br/>
agenda to get her to believe anything or be anything other than who  <br/>
she was. The goal was to do something together that she might find  <br/>
fun and ways for her to feel her time was well spent.<br/>
