<div id="ygrps-yiv-123321738">My Support Group puts out a Newsletter that is free to members and<br/>
available to the public for subscription. We are a non-profit group so all<br/>
proceeds from subscriptions go back to the group and to help keep the<br/>
newsletter going. All positions are filled on a volunteer basis. We are an<br/>
inclusive group that does not make any religion or political philosophy a<br/>
part of the group&#39;s identity. Our newsletter reflects this foundation. I<br/>
only mention all of this so you know the way the newsletter is handled. :)<br/>
<br/>
One of the items we have in our Newsletter is a list of recommended<br/>
reading. This can be either regular reading materials, how to homeschool<br/>
type books, or recommended curriculum. Basically what is listed is: The<br/>
name of the book, the author, a 2 to 3 sentence description, and the name<br/>
of the person who recommended the book (email address or website link to<br/>
the person who recommended is listed if requested).<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear from any of you about books that you would like to<br/>
see recommended to other homeschoolers or to those considering or<br/>
interested in homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Also, if any of you have any articles you would like to submit for our<br/>
newsletter (or know of someone who does), I would love to review them for<br/>
possible inclusion. You would of course receive full credit for the<br/>
article and if you have a website, business, or organization, this can be<br/>
a great way to help promote it.<br/>
<br/>
Our goal with this newsletter is to make it an excellent resource for<br/>
homeschoolers as well as trying to help the general public learn about<br/>
homeschooling. So many who do not know about homeschooling often put it<br/>
down due to a fear of the unknown. Our newsletter currently goes out to<br/>
many businesses that are not officially homeschool related (isn&#39;t<br/>
everything homeschool related though?), such as some Chiropractic Clinics,<br/>
Veteranary Clinics, School Supply Stores, etc. Clinics are putting our<br/>
newsletter out for their patients to read while in the waiting rooms. We<br/>
feel this is a great way to reach many people who might not otherwise know<br/>
anything about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any questions or items you would like to submit, you can<br/>

Thank you in advance! :)<br/>
