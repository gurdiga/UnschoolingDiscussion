<div id="ygrps-yiv-843562792">Hello Rebecca <br/>
My boys love to go to the vet. He is great at<br/>
explaining to them what is wrong either the cats or<br/>
dog. Anytime they have asked to see he allows them<br/>
they know what the inside of there ears look like and<br/>
everything if you have a good vet thats another route.<br/>
Thanks Libby<br/>
