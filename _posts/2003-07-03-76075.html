My husband and I had quite a few sitters when our kids were little. Grandmas<br/>
and aunties at first. Then some lovely teens and preteens that we knew<br/>
pretty well. Babysitter, for me, does not equal stranger. We have a lot of<br/>
friends that have no kids and while they love mine, there are times when we<br/>
do stuff without them. Also, we&#39;re theater people and we NEED to go see<br/>

just one another.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think folks who do things differently are wrong. I just didn&#39;t see<br/>
anyone talking about how they have had sitters and it started to sound a<br/>
little like if you do leave your kids, something&#39;s wrong with you.<br/>

We do things as a family or the boys stay home with Jackson or I while the <br/>
other goes out.  But I was not saying anything about people who do use a sitter. <br/>
 I guess I was commenting on the fact that Because I choose not to use a <br/>
sitter people often comment that we &quot;need to get out as a couple without the <br/>
kids.&quot;  &quot;It isn&#39;t healthy to never use a sitter.&quot;  Those kinds of comments.  Just <br/>
curious, does anyone ever say anything about you going out without the <br/>
children, as a couple that is?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the key is how the kids feel about it.  If yours were happy, great.<br/>
I was lucky enough to have various close family willing to help out when<br/>
mine were little, so I didn&#39;t use non-family sitters.  I didn&#39;t use them<br/>
much anyway except when I was a single parent.  I had to some then, but it<br/>
was for the kid who was the most comfortable being away from me, so that was<br/>
all right.  I&#39;m sure you wouldn&#39;t have left your kids if they made it clear<br/>
that they needed *you*.<br/>

<br/>
Depends what they do differently!  (Crack house in my neighborhood, that was <br/>
wrong.)<br/>
<br/>
We were in a WONDERFUL babysitting co-op when Kirby and Marty were little.  <br/>
All the members were either LLLeaders or dedicated long-time members.  Kids <br/>
were staying with other whole families of people they knew and we knew.  Their <br/>
kids had stayed at our houses, too.<br/>
<br/>
It was common in that group for the mom to take the nursing baby with her but <br/>
leave the older kids, but when leaving a baby was necessary that happened <br/>
too.  And if the moms were particularly close or trusting, sometimes a kid who <br/>
was scared or hurt got nursed by another mom.<br/>
<br/>
Just last month, Marty was in a conversation with two grown women who knew <br/>
each other but didn&#39;t know that they both knew Marty.  One said &quot;I nursed him <br/>
when he was a baby!&quot;  I said, mock-hurt, &quot;I helped!&quot;  Marty didn&#39;t even seem <br/>
embarrassed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was born, a 12 year old neighbor came over to see the baby.  She <br/>
came to be a mother&#39;s helper for me for three years, and she was the oldest of <br/>
three girls, homeschooled, three houses up the road.  Sometimes her sisters <br/>
were at our house. Sometimes one or more of our kids were up there.  As Amy got <br/>
older, I would sometimes leave for a while (grocery store) and leave the boys <br/>
with her, especially if her mom was home and could help in an emergency.<br/>
<br/>
That family broke up and scattered, and the kids still ask about Amy <br/>
sometimes.  We&#39;ve lost contact.<br/>
<br/>
But even though we&#39;ve left our kids, it&#39;s not been our prefered mode, and <br/>
with some families it does seem that leaving kids with people they don&#39;t know or <br/>
like is common.  My parents certainly did it.  We were left for the weekend <br/>
with a family that only spoke Spanish once.  They made us pick cucumbers.  My <br/>
sister was crying.  A woman stayed at the house with us for a weekend.  She made <br/>
us mop the kitchen floor on our hands and knees, with rags.   That was <br/>
exciting.<br/>
<br/>
Once  left Kirby and Marty at a mom&#39;s day out program at the Methodist church <br/>
near us, so I could go Christmas shopping, I think it was.  Two hours or <br/>
three.    Marty pointed and said &quot;I HATE THAT PLACE&quot; every time we passed it for <br/>
two or three YEARS.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey Paula--Sorry I came across that way--I didn&#39;t mean to! I felt SO bad <br/>
leaving my little guys with a stranger so I could work. (I mean I DID <br/>
check out the person first, and she WAS licensed, certified, etc.) I <br/>
would LOVE to have people either or both kids would love to stay with, <br/>
and I&#39;m working on making connections (we moved shortly after the one <br/>
time they did stay with someone that was a friend).<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any local family, and when I did, years ago, they didn&#39;t <br/>
offer to help much--although they do watch my neice all the time now. I <br/>
would also love to find some older friends who would love to watch my <br/>
kids at times--as was suggested to me on this list(&#39;s predecessor) a few <br/>
months ago.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, choosing to do stuff that doesn&#39;t interest your kids is fine, as <br/>
is choosing to do stuff with them. It&#39;s being pressured to leave them <br/>
just to not have to be around them that&#39;s being viewed as a problem, IMHO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533245048">Sandra that reminds me of my son when he was 3. I had taken a bad job so we <br/>
could get out of Housing (I was a single Mom for 3 years) after I met my now <br/>
husband. I was working for a maid service cleaning toilets (I hate cleaning). My <br/>
husband was a mechanic at a bus company across the street so I thought it <br/>
would help if we choose that one so he could see him. Wrong.. Every day I would <br/>
leave and he would totally freak out. I left there crying every day for three <br/>
weeks. When hubby would drive in the lot across the street and Dustin was out <br/>
side he would cry. As soon as we signed papers on our home I quit my job and <br/>
took a job delivering papers so Dustin could come with me. <br/>
<br/>
That was 8 years ago, he still says &quot;I hate that place&quot; or &quot;remember when you <br/>
made me go there&quot; :(<br/>
He told me that they would call him a baby, make fun of him and take an item <br/>
he brought with him away.<br/>
<br/>
Since then I only leave my kids with my MIL when I have to.<br/>
We even take our kids to our anniversary meals. We figure they are part of <br/>
the celebration at least until they got older and choose not to go.<br/>

I would love to get out to a movie once in a while, the kind that 5 year<br/>
olds would be better off not seeing, like &quot;The Matrix Reloaded&quot;.  However,<br/>
Jonathan, does NOT like being away from me.  Lanora was the same way and I<br/>
know he will outgrow it but I don&#39;t intend to leave him crying so I can see<br/>
a movie.<br/>
<br/>
I watch my friend&#39;s boy all the time so they can have a date.  Kai is VERY<br/>
cool with being here without mom or dad though.  I understand getting out<br/>
and doing things that aren&#39;t best with kids.  I REALLY miss live theatre!<br/>

My husband and I have left our daughter with in-laws and close friends<br/>
(all of whom have kids) a few times.  Actually, most of the time, we<br/>
simply take our daughter with us when we want to go out but, there<br/>
have been a couple of times when we wanted to go out alone.  <br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t understand is leaving your kids with people you don&#39;t<br/>
even know.  Especially if they are little.  We actually never left our<br/>
daughter with anyone until she was older (by that I mean no longer an<br/>
infant).  But, I don&#39;t care how old my child is, I would NEVER leave<br/>
her with someone I didn&#39;t know (and I mean know well).  This is<br/>
someone you are trusting with you child (or children) for goodness sake!<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a difference between leaving your kid(s) with a<br/>
friend or family member for a couple of hours and dropping the kid(s)<br/>
off with total strangers.<br/>

plenty of times &quot;Oh no mom, not her again!&quot; when told about having a sitter<br/>
that night. Even if it is someone the child knows, if it&#39;s someone they<br/>
dislike for any reason, why make them spend hours alone with them? I&#39;ve hard<br/>

This reminds me of the time when I took Connor who was then 4 to private<br/>
swim lessons because I thought they would be better than anything I could<br/>
teach him or a group setting.  (I&#39;m NOT a swimmer and want him to be)<br/>
Anyway, this man MADE him get in the water and go under water and and and.<br/>
I felt HORRIBLE the whole time and needless to say, we never went back for<br/>
another lesson.  Still to this day, he says &quot;remember when you made me go to<br/>
those swim lessons and I cried the whole time?&quot;  Even a few months after the<br/>
lesson, he would cry when we passed by the street.  I felt about as big as<br/>
an ant.  What was I thinking?  Anyway, I never took him to lessons again<br/>
until he asked me to.  And by then, he was ready to learn and felt<br/>
comfortable being away from me (him in the pool with the instructor and me<br/>
on the side watching).  He has become a little fish all by himself.  Boy,<br/>
childled learning is great!  I make a point of paying attention to his body<br/>
language and what he says even more so now.<br/>
