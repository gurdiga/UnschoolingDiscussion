Bronnikov Update Developing Genius Abilities by Kostya Kovalenko<br/>
In October, we reported on the work being done in the former-Soviet <br/>
Union in the development of superpsychic powers for those who really <br/>
need them (see The Bronnikov Method: Teaching Blind Children to See). <br/>
As we might suspect, Bronnikov&#39;s work extends far beyond this single <br/>
application. It also involves &#39;&#39;the preservation of genius qualities <br/>
in the child,&#39;&#39; and the development of those qualities in older <br/>
children and adults.<br/>
The heart of Bronnikov&#39;s teaching is what he calls the &#39;&#39;inner <br/>
biocomputer.&#39;&#39; In Bronnikov&#39;s view, we do not teach ourselves <br/>
information. Rather, we program our inner biocomputer to absorb the <br/>
information, then we simply access it as needed.<br/>
And the biocomputer, in Bronnikov&#39;s view, is able to access all of <br/>
the information in the universe. This accords with what Western <br/>
spiritual sources have long believed about the Akashic Records as a <br/>
storehouse of all knowledge and all history in the universe, <br/>
available to each one of us - if only we knew how to access it. What <br/>
is so unbelievable about Bronnikov&#39;s approach is that he has <br/>
apparently developed practical, repeatable methods for teaching <br/>
anyone at all how to achieve this feat of accessing knowledge <br/>
directly. He is proving that anyone who chooses to take the time to <br/>
learn how can tap into the Akashic Records at will.<br/>
Spirit of Ma&#39;at reporter Kostya Kovalenko, who lives in Kiev near <br/>
Bronnikov&#39;s native Feodosia, has stayed close to this story. Here, he <br/>
tells us more about the work that is being done by this amazing man.<br/>
New Education<br/>
Viacheslav Bronnikov has created an international project <br/>
called &#39;&#39;Informational and Social Ecology for the 21st Century.&#39;&#39; He <br/>
and his colleagues are working in several directions, and one of them <br/>
is &#39;&#39;new education.&#39;&#39; Several base programs have been developed in <br/>
this area.<br/>
&#39;&#39;Minus One Year,&#39;&#39; for example, deals with pre-birth informational <br/>
development! Using this system, parents begin working with their <br/>
child even before it is born, and learn to follow their child&#39;s in <br/>
utero development.<br/>
Another direction of Bronnikov&#39;s work is in pre-school education. The <br/>
child, in Bronnikov&#39;s understanding, is so close to the Divine at <br/>
this age, so complete, that developing genius is simply a question of <br/>
preserving the qualities that are already present - instead of <br/>
deforming our children by our ways of bringing them up.<br/>
A third direction that Bronnikov&#39;s work has taken involves a proposed <br/>
new type of school for developing the qualities of genius in older <br/>
children and adults. Such schools make it possible for children and <br/>
adults to go beyond the standards set by society. Teachers, instead <br/>
of communicating their own ideas to students, would be &#39;&#39;looking into <br/>
the mysteries of the Divine plan, and fulfilling it.&#39;&#39;<br/>
The Inner Biocomputer<br/>
Teachers and students in a Bronnikov school are allies. Together, <br/>
they train the inner biocomputer, and that, in its turn, does the <br/>
actual learning, providing knowledge upon request. The role of a <br/>
teacher in this case is a combination of analyst, mediator, and <br/>
something like the conductor of an orchestra.<br/>
Bronnikov&#39;s new school format fosters a relationship between teacher <br/>
and student based on this &#39;&#39;biocomputer&#39;&#39; model of the brain. It&#39;s <br/>
also based on advances in what he calls &#39;&#39;virtual psychology,&#39;&#39; <br/>
wherein the Self is seen in a spiritual light - that we all are <br/>
beings with access to all knowledge, everywhere, and that we are here <br/>
on Earth for a purpose. One of the results of attending a Bronnikov <br/>
school is reportedly that students, through working with the levels <br/>
of mind that this work taps into, are able to realize their life&#39;s <br/>
mission at a very early age.<br/>
Bronnikov has achieved unique results in working with his students. <br/>
In Moscow alone, his methods have been taught to more than 2,500 <br/>
children, with about 500 people going through the first three stages <br/>
of the course. Some children are even being taught the new methods in <br/>
Sunday school. Students of a school that opened its doors last <br/>
September already are far exceeding the test scores of those in other <br/>
schools, while having a more active social life - and seeing the <br/>
world around them in a new light.<br/>
At the new Special Center for Social Ecology Of Human Informational <br/>
Evolution at Moscow State University for Service, students in the <br/>
sociology and social services department are now being offered a <br/>
Bronnikov course entitled &#39;&#39;Human Life Info-Ecological Safety.&#39;&#39; The <br/>
practical experience they receive in the Bronnikov Method is <br/>
something they can then use with their other university courses.<br/>
Here is a description from the International Academy for Human <br/>
Development, describing what children gain through learning the <br/>
Bronnikov Method:<br/>
Through special exercises, you will strengthen your normal memory and <br/>
you will develop new types of memory:<br/>
* biocomputer memory - you&#39;ll learn how to mentally &#39;&#39;record&#39;&#39; big <br/>
amounts of data and later &#39;&#39;access&#39;&#39; those records: numbers, <br/>
formulas, rules, texts, etc.; you&#39;ll learn how to manipulate them and <br/>
how to use it in the school<br/>
* photographic memory - you&#39;ll learn to take a mental picture of how <br/>
objects are laid out and of their number; the same for poems and <br/>
stories.<br/>
Through V. M. Bronnikov method you will discover new virtual kinds of <br/>
sight, that will let you have fun while learning in school. You will <br/>
be able:<br/>
* In Geography class - to travel through the continents and the <br/>
oceans, &#39;&#39;submerging&#39;&#39; to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, feel the <br/>
temperature, salinity, flow of the waters, &#39;&#39;see&#39;&#39; the plants and the <br/>
fishes of this underwater kingdom -- all this while remaining in the <br/>
classroom; <br/>
* In History class - mentally access historical events. For example <br/>
you can &#39;&#39;watch&#39;&#39; the Kulikovo Field battle or how Suvorov brought <br/>
his troops through the Alps [these are examples from Russian history <br/>
familiar to any school child]<br/>
* In Biology class - explore the cell structure of plants, watch the <br/>
flow of nutritiments into the living organisms;<br/>
* In Physics class - &#39;&#39;create&#39;&#39; virtual laboratories, where you can <br/>
carry out any experiments. <br/>
Amazingly, your feelings when you learn these different subjects will <br/>
be just what you would feel if all of these things were really <br/>
happening. All your senses will be engaged, and will evolve further <br/>
through these experiences.<br/>
Learning those newest technologies for the development of your <br/>
abilities will empower you to achieve your potential and more. You&#39;ll <br/>
be able to learn school courses in a much shorter time, or even take <br/>
exams without attending classes. It will let you carry out scientific <br/>
research in the field of your interest.<br/>
Your new abilities also will allow you to learn several foreign <br/>
languages simultaneously, achieve better performance in sports, and <br/>
develop talents in music, painting, and other art forms. <br/>
Scientific Validation<br/>
L. Y. Lozhnikova, academic council chairperson for the International <br/>
Academy for Human Development, in an article describing her <br/>
experiences with teaching the Bronnikov method, [1], writes, &#39;&#39;Our <br/>
children know as much about anatomy and physiology as a fourth- or <br/>
fifth-year medical student. And of course, as to knowledge of man&#39;s <br/>
etheric body, they go beyond what professional doctors know.&#39;&#39;<br/>
Lozhnikova tells this story:<br/>
Nadya Piskareva&#39;s little sister was born with heart disease - a <br/>
congenital defect in a partition between the heart chambers. There <br/>
was need for a surgical operation. At that time, Nadya had just <br/>
finished the 3rd stage of the Bronnikov method. So Viacheslav <br/>
Bronnikov explained to Nadya how she could work with her little <br/>
sister.<br/>
Nadya did only a few sessions - and to the wonder of the doctors the <br/>
hole in the partition shrank to several times less than it had been <br/>
before. They still went for the surgical operation, but there was <br/>
much less to do, and the child responded well. <br/>
In an article titled &#39;&#39;Step-by-Step Methods of Vision-Formation <br/>
Successful Through Bronnikov Method,&#39;&#39;[2] the internationally-<br/>
recognized medical scientist Natalia Petrovna Behtereva comments on <br/>
the case of Larisa Pavlova, who had lost her eyesight after a <br/>
childhood accident. Behtereva says:<br/>
There were three stages in the sight development process. ... The <br/>
process itself was very consecutive and logical. It had all been well <br/>
defined. The process stages include teaching a person to control his <br/>
or her own free energy (first stage), then development of internal <br/>
(second stage) and external (third stage) sight. The process of sight <br/>
development for Larisa is not finished yet, it&#39;s still going on, but <br/>
the Bronnikov Method results we now have allow us to say that it&#39;s <br/>
very real for a person who has lost eyesight to develop the ability <br/>
to &#39;&#39;see.&#39;&#39;<br/>
I was present at almost all of Larisa&#39;s exercise sessions. My <br/>
employees S. G. Danko and L. A. Melucheva, and others, performed <br/>
biofeedback monitoring of the processes in her brain, and a computer <br/>
analysis of those processes.<br/>
Larisa&#39;s brain monitoring showed the following results:<br/>
* during the process of learning, her brain began reacting to light <br/>
signals;<br/>
* with time, her brain characteristics slowly began to approach the <br/>
values normal for a sighted person;<br/>
* Repetitive reactions appeared in the brain areas when inner vision <br/>
was being used;<br/>
* There was substantial initial brain activation with the elements of <br/>
hyperactivation;<br/>
* The brain&#39;s defense mechanisms appeared highly effective<br/>
Future Plans<br/>
According to L. D. Bronnikova, it&#39;s obvious to everybody that the old <br/>
learning system doesn&#39;t work any longer. &#39;&#39;All around the world <br/>
people, are looking for new human development and learning <br/>
technologies. We created a technology that allows us to create an <br/>
entire computer system inside ourselves. It&#39;s simply awesome. We open <br/>
up new brain resources - and a man becomes free.&#39;&#39;<br/>
&#39;&#39;When studying a biological cell,&#39;&#39; Bronnikova explains, &#39;&#39;our kids <br/>
don&#39;t search for the materials in their textbooks - they &#39;get&#39; <br/>
directly into the cell and watch what&#39;s going on there.<br/>
&#39;&#39;When kids master alternate sight and develop photographic and <br/>
biocomputer memory, they forget about being tired. They get rid of <br/>
illnesses. Their natural talents flourish and creativity comes to the <br/>
fore.&#39;&#39;<br/>
Interestingly enough, Bronnikova adds, &#39;&#39;It often happens that the <br/>
more neglected a child was, the brighter the results.&quot;&#39;<br/>
At the present time, only the first three stages of the Bronnikov <br/>
Method are taught in Moscow and in schools other than Bronnikov&#39;s <br/>
own. Stage four and five, Bronnikov maintains, require his own input, <br/>
which will take place at his new school in Feodosia (Ukraine). But <br/>
the schools in Moscow already give education in business, economics, <br/>
sciences, and the arts.<br/>
