<div id="ygrps-yiv-650179812">Relax, it is deschooling.  She WILL get bored with Barbies and start<br/>
looking for other things to do.  Of course, you can kind of encourage it<br/>
with Barbie books and Barbie coloring books and things like that sitting<br/>
around.  But, truely she will deschool and then start looking for things to<br/>
stimulate the ol&#39; grey matter.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see --<br/>
<br/>
there&#39;s sewing, and designing a doll house, and budgeting for that next <br/>
Barbie thing you just have to have, and Barbie CDs, and Barbie books, and <br/>
good old-fashioned imaginative play, putting on an actual play with Barbies, <br/>
and reading about the history of Barbie or the different opinions of Barbie <br/>
thru the years, or finding out about people who collect Barbie and other <br/>
dolls, etc., etc., etc.<br/>
<br/>
Math, anatomy, design, history, reading, theater, all by way of Barbie.<br/>
<br/>
In time.  <br/>
<br/>
2 months is barely time to get a new thing (whatver you&#39;re into) by mail -- <br/>
today it was a chess game here and the other day we got the tomato seeds from <br/>
NASA.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s any comfort, it sure doesn&#39;t move in a smooth, fast, straight line <br/>
around here.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945665000">My mother gave my daughter a Barbie CD ROM  that my 8 year old programs to<br/>
really talk and say whatever she tells it to. At first I thought it would<br/>
drive me nuts but it is really amazing lots of reading and typing skills as<br/>
well as some believe it or not creativity  and I know there is a lot of<br/>
software out there even though Barbies seem so superficial and not what I<br/>
ever enjoyed playing with as a girl. Doll play is for some kids very<br/>
therapeutic and helps them to work through a lot of fantasy and role playing<br/>
necessary for developing the imagination. Even though I was a &quot;Tom Boy&quot; and<br/>
hated dolls I probably would have enjoyed a CD ROM and talking Barbie as an<br/>
8 year old as it would satisfy my intellect.</div>

&gt; The quote is my cousin&#39;s opinion.  He is rather, hmmm, how to say this in<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; slightly pc manner, ah, different &lt;g&gt; and probably one of the funniest<br/>
&gt; people I know, particularly when he really isn&#39;t trying to be.  He is gay<br/>
&gt; but doesn&#39;t believe that to be &quot;out of the closet&quot; one has to go to the<br/>
&gt; extreme and become a hollywood stereotype and, as he puts it, &quot;swish.&quot;  He<br/>
&gt; likes to keep his sex life private and said he wishes everyone else would<br/>
&gt; also.  And that includes one of his favorite gripes,  heterosexuals kids<br/>
&gt; who &quot;just about do the dirty&quot; in the middle of the mall as he phrases it<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;  Hey, I&#39;m in full agreement with that one!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I never see heterosexual day parades or people<br/>
&gt; &gt;  standing up in a room proclaiming they are heterosexual.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What about weddings?  Holding hands in public?  Couples dancing at<br/>
&gt; weddings<br/>
&gt; &gt; and company parties and New Year&#39;s Eve?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;That&#39;s not correct.  They said they wouldn&#39;t allow openly homosexual<br/>
&gt; men in<br/>
&gt; &gt; a leadership position if the parents objected.  They did not, contrary<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; biased news articles, go on a witch hunt to remove leaders and<br/>
members.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Good.  Not the best of all possible worlds, but better than I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; hearing<br/>
&gt; &gt; for which I&#39;m really relieved.  Thanks for the clarification.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sorry to post so much all at once.  I&#39;ll try to hush now.<br/>
