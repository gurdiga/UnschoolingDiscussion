<div id="ygrps-yiv-614941428">I want my children to grow up at their own pace, free from continual peer <br/>
pressure. I want my children to capture the spark for knowledge they have as <br/>
toddlers and burn long. I see so many kids by 2-3 grade losing the fire of <br/>
desire to learn. I want my kids to know themselves and their family. I want <br/>
them to hold a fond memory of childhood. I want their childhood to be long. <br/>
So many kids grow up so fast, by 9-10 they are into looking for boyfriends <br/>
and girlfriends. I want my children to know they teach themselves now and <br/>
forever.<br/>
<br/>
What I can come up with right now,<br/>
<br/>
