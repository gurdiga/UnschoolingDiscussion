the 5ht year of nursing (after they turn 4), they tend to slow way down.  <br/>
Of course, every nursling is different.  If you make it through the hard<br/>
parts the reward is having a child who will remember nursing, speak fondly<br/>
of it, and spread that love of nursing to others.  I&#39;m so happy my 8 yo<br/>
remembres nursing.  It is nice to discuss.  And I know that he will make a<br/>
wonderful advocate for breastfeeding when he is grown.  I really enjoyed<br/>
our last year of nursing, even though I was pregnant and very<br/>
uncomfortable.  Had I weaned him at 4 when I really was sick of it, i<br/>
never would have known the joy of nursing him until he really was ready to<br/>
quite w/o sadness.<br/>

Hi Tiffany,<br/>
<br/>
Yes it&#39;s an unschooling list. Unschoolers tend to do a lot of unschoolish<br/>
things, like extended breastfeeding. That&#39;s some, not all. My 4.5 year old<br/>
does indeed drink out of a bottle, or a cup. I prefer a bottle since there&#39;s<br/>
less spillage. I don&#39;t find it ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
And yes we go off-topic a lot. Except we don&#39;t think of it as off-topic<br/>
because it&#39;s Life and we find it interesting. If there&#39;s something in<br/>
particular you want to talk about, bring it up.<br/>

a few manufacturers, however, I don&#39;t think they were invented for 11 yo&#39;s to<br/>
replace a baby bottle.  In addition to nursing, I give the baby (11 mos) a sippy<br/>
cup.  My older 2 (3.5 & 5) do have water bottles once in a while (mostly to save<br/>
my furniture LOL).  They  normally drink from a regular glass.  To each his<br/>
own.  I did not mean for anyone to get offended.  I just wanted to know how much<br/>
info I was going to get here that did pertain to unschooling.  I am quite busy &<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; list???  I have not seen a post yet that had to do with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know. Unschooling to me means learning from life, that there is no<br/>
clear delineating between &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;, that learning can<br/>
happen anywhere and everywhere. Every post on this list is about life and<br/>
learning, and although some of the topics will not appeal to each of us,<br/>
I&#39;ve found that overall there is much to be learned from the wisdom on this<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cents:  Why would you nurse any longer than you would bottle feed?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because nursing is what a baby/child biologically expects, needs, and wants.<br/>
Bottle-feeding is a culturally-accepted substitute and thus people feel<br/>
pressured to stop bottle-feeding at an age where their child is no longer<br/>
considered &quot;a baby&quot;. Because I feel it is important for my kids to learn<br/>
things or change at the point in their lives when they are ready to do so.<br/>
This applies as much to child-led weaning as it does to child-led learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think you<br/>
&gt; folks would agree that a 4 or 5 year old with a bottle would be a bit<br/>
&gt; ridiculous!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why?? Only because society does not accept that the needs of these children<br/>
are valid? Every society, every culture has different norms and values. I<br/>
certainly do *not* accept that our culture&#39;s norm of forcing independence on<br/>
children before they are ready (forcing them to wean early, sleep through<br/>
the night without comfort, etc.) are valid. In the same vein, I do not<br/>
accept that our culture&#39;s norm of forcing children to all learn the same<br/>
thing at the same time is valid. Allowing my children to take their own<br/>
steps toward independence from me is part and parcel of unschooling, whether<br/>
that independence be weaning from the breast or going off to their first<br/>
job.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; posts on an unschooling list!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list seems to embrace many topics that are related to life, learning,<br/>
and change. Whether or not those are &quot;off topic&quot; probably depends heavily on<br/>
the eye of the beholder. To me, unschooling is as much about &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
my own brain as it is about helping my kids to discover their passions and<br/>
learn. So all of these things seem fairly on-topic.<br/>

&gt;  &gt;       I am new here.  Please don&#39;t take offense, but isn&#39;t this an<br/>
&gt;unschooling<br/>
&gt;  &gt; list???  I have not seen a post yet that had to do with unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know. Unschooling to me means learning from life, that there is no<br/>
&gt;clear delineating between &quot;schooling&quot; and &quot;learning&quot;, that learning can<br/>
&gt;happen anywhere and everywhere. Every post on this list is about life and<br/>
&gt;learning, and although some of the topics will not appeal to each of us,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve found that overall there is much to be learned from the wisdom on this<br/>
&gt;list.<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s been many, many years since breastfeeding was a concern to me, <br/>
but I&#39;ve been enjoying this discussion anyway. It&#39;s always helpful to <br/>
keep the subject lines relevant, so those who aren&#39;t interested in a <br/>
thread can block or delete, but to unceremoniously delete these <br/>
wonderfully sharing posts unread would be unthinkable for me - this <br/>
is the very heart of homeschooling!<br/>

Don&#39;t feel bad about any earlier posts. I tend to get rather &quot;emotional&quot;<br/>
about subjects dear to my heart,too. And I think part of it is that many of<br/>
us struggle with so much criticism for our way of parenting or schooling or<br/>
whatever it may be, that when we seek out safe havens like this list and are<br/>
questioned for our unconventional methods, it really hits home. Of course<br/>
this doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t have open discussion of any topic. Just my<br/>
take on it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Amy, you said that so well!  Isn&#39;t that the point of unschooling too?  To<br/>
&gt; meet our child&#39;s needs rather than try to fit the child into someone<br/>
&gt; else&#39;s mold?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I apologize if my earlier post seemed rude - this is a topic near to my<br/>
&gt; heart. </span></blockquote></div>
