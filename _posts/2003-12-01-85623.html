<div id="ygrps-yiv-912273472">Thought y&#39;all would enjoy this excerpt about the little kids&#39; <br/>
sensation The Wiggles:<br/>
(from a Washington Post interview)<br/>
<br/>
The group was formed by three friends who met in an early childhood education <br/>
program at a university in Sydney. They wanted to be teachers, and for a <br/>
while two of them were. But they also played music -- a pair were in a band called <br/>
the Cockroaches -- and what they learned in college about the  3-year-old <br/>
brain they began to apply to their songwriting.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not just that they know less, they think quite differently,&quot; says <br/>
Murray Cook, who chatted for a couple minutes in  MCI Center&#39;s press room before <br/>
the show on Monday. &quot;You really have to focus on them more, because they&#39;re <br/>
really egocentric. The world revolves around them, so a lot of the stuff we do is <br/>
to empower them. A lot of it is interactive, songs that have things for them <br/>
to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cook, who is well over  6 feet 4 inches takes the Wiggles seriously without <br/>
seeming humorless or deadly earnest. He and his band mates -- yes, they play <br/>
instruments -- can do corny without irony, and they all appear genuinely amused <br/>
by the antics of their audience, which is why their act never seems at all <br/>
creepy. Cook, for one, enjoys being a celebrity to people who think he lives in <br/>
the television, or don&#39;t understand what perspiration is.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I go out into the audience, usually the kids just say things like &#39;Why <br/>
are you wet?&#39; Once a kid said to me, &#39;You&#39;re melting!&#39; &quot;<br/>
