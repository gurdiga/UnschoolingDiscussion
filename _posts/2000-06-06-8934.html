<br/>
I am new to homeschooling as well.  I am still struggling with what<br/>
curriculum I should use.  I thought it was interesting that we both live in<br/>
Arkansas.  If we have any questions concerning Arkansas &quot;laws&quot; or<br/>

&gt; Okay, let me rephrase the question more intelligently: Tell me some of the<br/>
&gt; wonderful ways you are observing your children&#39;s natural love of learning<br/>
&gt; and self-directed activities and facilitating their learning by answering<br/>
&gt; questions, providing resources, etc. Your responses have been so<br/>
&gt; encouraging and reassuring to me as I only know public school moms and<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; are interested in totally different aspects of their children&#39;s lives.<br/>
&gt; I have been home with my children and unschooling all their lives (almost<br/>
6<br/>
&gt; years). My oldest e-mails with her grandma (using &quot;kid spelling&quot;). I read<br/>
&gt; to them a ton of children&#39;s books and are halfway through the Little House<br/>
&gt; series. They play outside a lot and have taken to frog and worm hunting a<br/>
&gt; lot lately and observing frogs swim in our bathtub: ) My five-year-old has<br/>
&gt; her own little business selling eggs and my four-year-old sells fruit and<br/>
&gt; jam that she helps me make. My three-year-old son is a dinosaur fanatic<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; asks a lot of questions about them. Yesterday, he announced &quot;Mama, when I<br/>
&gt; grow up, I&#39;m going to be a pro bull rider.&quot; Yikes! The girls and I are<br/>
&gt; experimenting with sewing, cross stitch, latch hook, and crochet. We live<br/>
&gt; on 11 acres in Arkansas with a catfish pond, a hay meadow, and lots of<br/>
&gt; fruit trees. My kids have learned things about animals, farming, and<br/>
&gt; gardening that I didn&#39;t know at age 20.<br/>
&gt; We have a setting hen and I could swear she&#39;s been setting for 3 weeks.<br/>
&gt; Isn&#39;t that the incubation period? Now I&#39;m off on a tangent : ) Sue, your<br/>
&gt; lives on your farm sounds awesome!  ---Becky<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421631336">Arkansas has seen some changes in their laws.  The updated laws can be found<br/>
at www.nhen.org.. and here at unschooling.com, if I ever get back online.<br/>
AOL will not connect tonight!<br/>
