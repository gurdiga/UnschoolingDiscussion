<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987053016">Working on it - a lot of it is decluttering, bad furniture, and just <br/>
bad planning.  Crispin doesn&#39;t go for the usual stuff like outlets etc. <br/>
and we don&#39;t use toxic cleaners or anything.  Crispin likes pull <br/>
everything down.  The covers, the curtains, shower curtains, empty the <br/>
diaper pail, or better yet fill it with the mail or my teaching stuff.  <br/>
I want to move my office from the living room to the basement, and move <br/>
our bedrooms downstairs and make the bungalow bedroom area all play all <br/>
kids all the time.  I just need to make my husband disappear for a day <br/>
or two so he can&#39;t grumble through the process and a pair of non cat <br/>
allergic hands to help with the big stuff.  And someone to run the <br/>
cables etc for the computers for his and my offices.  The only thing is <br/>
that when we move Crispin out of our bed, there wouldn&#39;t be room for <br/>
his bed in our room, he&#39;d have to be in Harriet&#39;s room.  They do sleep <br/>
together in her bed occasionally, but now that&#39;s all in one room.  <br/>
We&#39;ll see...I think it&#39;s worth the work.<br/>

&gt; If you don&#39;t have a childproof house, you&#39;ve made your life way more<br/>
&gt; difficult than it needs to be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;but my husband wants to move so badly he won&#39;t agree to totally<br/>
&gt; rearrange the house with me ;)&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do it without him.  At least get a couple of rooms safe.<br/>
