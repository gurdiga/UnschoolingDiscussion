<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366729326"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">When my son and I were discussing his desire to go to school, I told him 
<br>everything about school. He knew that he wouldn&#39;t get to play with the kids, 
<br>he knew that he would have to sit still all day, and do worksheets BUT he 
<br>still wanted to go. He was just curious. He wanted to find out for himself. 
<br>We took a tour during lunch hour, and he thought it was soooo cool that the 
<br>kids lined up, picked up their own trays, etc. It was all so new to him. He 
<br>also wanted to ride the bus. When kids have never been to school, the whole 
<br>experience can seem very exciting. Fortunately, our homeschooling theater 
<br>group is exciting too.
