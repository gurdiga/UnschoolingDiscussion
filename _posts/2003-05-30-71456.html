&gt; For me that would be the problem. It&#39;s that he&#39;s using his words to<br/>
&gt; hurt someone else by name calling. My kid could be saying &quot;poopy<br/>
&gt; head&quot; and I&#39;d still stop and talk to him about it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think he&#39;s trying to hurt anyone to be honest. I think what he means is &#39;Leave me alone, I&#39;m angry&#39;.<br/>
Its impossible to talk to him during a rage and afterwards he is loving and says he&#39;ll try to not swear in future. I assume as he gets older he&#39;ll get more in control.<br/>

&gt; I make a BIG distiction about what society considers &quot;bad&quot; words and<br/>
&gt; what I do. My definition of &quot;bad&quot; is words that are intended to hurt,<br/>
&gt; be they colorful, shocking or the plain old boring variety.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well yeah. My daughter went througha spate of &#39;I hate you&#39; when she was 5-9. Now she is old enough to say &#39;I feel hurt by what you&#39;ve done/said&#39; when a friend upsets her. It was difficult for a few<br/>
years though, truiong to explain that what she said wasn&#39;t what she meant. You certianly find out who are your true friends when your children exhibit &#39;*bad* behaviour. I even had people advocating<br/>
smacking in order to &#39;train&#39; them out of it!<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s not words, it&#39;s the intent. Remember the above words (&#39;f*****<br/>
&gt; b*****&#39;) could be used in a fairly innocent sentence about one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; female dog copulating with the neighbor&#39;s studly mutt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Not in Stepford they couldn&#39;t. The neighbours would swoon if anything that crude went on :-)<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what I figured. But what he&#39;s saying is still more pointed and <br/>
hurtful than &quot;leave me alone, I&#39;m angry.&quot; For me, that would be the <br/>
focus of any discussion I had about it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Its impossible to talk to him during a rage and afterwards he is <br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could help him understand that it&#39;s the hurt in the words <br/>
that&#39;s the worst part, even though the uptight neighbors want to tell <br/>
you it&#39;s the words themselves. I would try to separate the two issues-<br/>
swearing and hurtful words. Swearing can have its time and place, <br/>
hurtful words are just never appropriate for me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I assume as he gets older he&#39;ll get more in control.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Well I hope you smacked the people who were telling you that. Talk <br/>
about bad behavior! Hitting a little kid. Sheesh!<br/>

Not in most parts of Utah either. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
