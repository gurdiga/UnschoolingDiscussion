<div id="ygrps-yiv-270535933">Hi there,<br/>
My name is Govinda. I live in Visalia, Ca. and am looking for<br/>
others, in the Visalia area, with teenagers who are making the<br/>
transition to trying to find a job or go to collage. My boy is 18 and<br/>
is feeling anxious about his future. I would like to find some<br/>
friends in the area for both of us.<br/>
My boy&#39;s name is Keshava. He is very good musically with guitar<br/>
playing especially. He also has a keyboard, cello, and just recently<br/>
got a sitar. He loves to work on computer graphic and game making.<br/>
I have many interests, music, learning NVC, photography, cooking,<br/>
spiritual life. Our family is vegetarian.<br/>
<br/>
Nice to be here,<br/>
Govinda</div>

This is really too local for this list, and I hope you&#39;ve already  <br/>
hooked up with some people through hsc.org.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to transitioning, though, there are some things here to read:<br/>

California&#39;s fortunate to have the state college system!<br/>
