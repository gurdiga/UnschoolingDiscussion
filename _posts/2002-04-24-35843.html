 One is that, yes you have every right to continue posting in the same <br/>
 manner that you have.  BUT, I personally know several people who left <br/>
 this list specifically because of that type of posting, so for <br/>
 everyone you help, you may be loosing one too.  Just a thought to <br/>
 think about.<br/>
 <br/>
 My second thought is that you seem to be saying that any homeschooler <br/>
 or parent for that matter who doesn&#39;t take to unschooling must not <br/>
 respect their children properly.  So is that really what you think? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First of all Bridget, I don&#39;t think this post singling me out is in line with <br/>
Joyces recommendation to post thoughts that assist in unschooling.<br/>
So I&#39;ll keep my answers brief.<br/>
First of all...we could really discuss how many people have been driven off <br/>
by various posters...I think that&#39;s totally undproductive for the list and I <br/>
think we ALL know (very personally) people driven off by the attacks on those <br/>
same vocal, experienced unschoolers and their advice. ( sound familiar?)<br/>
<br/>
As to your second paragraph...you don&#39;t have to read very many of my posts to <br/>
realize that I don&#39;t feel that way, so I&#39;m fairly sure this was posted only <br/>
to inflame me and not an actual observation you had.<br/>
I&#39;ll let it go at that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518827964">Ren, I&#39;m sorry you feel I was attacking you. It is not how I meant it <br/>
although I understand why you took it the way you did.  In my first <br/>
thought I was not refering to &quot;you&quot; as a singular specific.  I was <br/>
attempting to refer to a posting style.  It just didn&#39;t come off that <br/>
way and I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
My second thaght was a question.  And I&#39;ve read lots of your posts and <br/>
they have come across as you saying that if you truly respect your <br/>
kids you MUST be unschooling.  That&#39;s why I ASKED if that was what you <br/>
really meant.<br/>
<br/>
So, sorry again for the confusion about the two thoughts and &quot;you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
