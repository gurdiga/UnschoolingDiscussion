<div id="ygrps-yiv-973055134">Oh, that&#39;s not true at all. I know from experience. I grew up in a very<br/>
quiet home (with tv limits and everything). Yelling wasn&#39;t not allowed. But<br/>
let me tell you, plenty of &quot;violence&quot; was done...passive aggressive<br/>
violence, word &#39;violence&#39;..noise is not an indicator. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Our home now is wonderfully noisy and chaotic much of the time, but not<br/>
violent at all, in words or deeds.  But you&#39;re right, what we see or hear<br/>
can become part of us and I hope my children and seeing AND hearing lots of<br/>
love, joy, acceptance, fun, and all that is involved in growing and<br/>
learning.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe what we see or hear becomes apart of us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what experience with unschooled children do you have to support  <br/>
your belief that watching violence turns children violent?<br/>
<br/>
How will you prevent your child from seeing violence? By choosing  <br/>
*for him* not to have TV? By choosing what shows he&#39;s allowed to  <br/>
watch? How peaceful would you feel if your husband decided what you  <br/>
could and couldn&#39;t watch, what you could and couldn&#39;t read? How  <br/>
peaceful would you feel if you thought you were perfectly capable of  <br/>
handling something and he said no? Would you just say okay and be  <br/>
peaceful about it? Is there a nonviolent way to make you stop wanting  <br/>
something and make you want what someone else wants for you?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy when they&#39;re onlies and very young. We *are* in control of  <br/>
their environment and it seems easy to assume we&#39;ll always be able to  <br/>
filter the world so they only experience what is kind and good. But  <br/>
to do that we have to cut them off from the world. We can&#39;t let them  <br/>
play with kids who turn sticks into guns, or let them see carnivorous  <br/>
dinosaurs eating peaceful plant eaters, or let them know that there  <br/>
is cruelty in the world.<br/>
<br/>
And if we let them experience the world, when they want something we  <br/>
don&#39;t want them to have, then what? How do we control them when they  <br/>
don&#39;t want to be controlled?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t control naturally inherently connected with violence?<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have found *from experience* that children avoid what  <br/>
makes them uncomfortable and watch what they enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;re there to help them get what they want and avoid what they  <br/>
don&#39;t want. We&#39;re don&#39;t set them up so the only choices they have are  <br/>
to go off alone or be in the room with us while we watch a violent  <br/>
movie that they aren&#39;t interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Children may choose to watch shows that are more violent than we  <br/>
might be comfortable for them to watch. Is the answer then to be  <br/>
assert the fact that we&#39;re more powerful and they are less powerful  <br/>
and make them do what we believe is best?<br/>
<br/>
What happens when they are out of your control, when they&#39;re at a  <br/>
friend&#39;s house?<br/>
<br/>
While some kids equate rules with safety, that if they just avoid the  <br/>
don&#39;ts and follow the do&#39;s that they&#39;ll be safe, most kids when  <br/>
they&#39;re beyond the reach of control go ahead and do what they&#39;re  <br/>
forbidden to do. And they often do it to excess because they know  <br/>
this may be their one and only opportunity. They may, at the least,  <br/>
watch an ultraviolent movie that disturbs them greatly just because  <br/>
they don&#39;t want to miss the opportunity when it&#39;s there in front of  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
But if they *always* have the opportunity, when they know they can  <br/>
shut something off and turn it on tomorrow or the next day or 10  <br/>
years from now, they don&#39;t push themselves beyond their comfort zone.<br/>
<br/>
When the world is divided between what you can and can&#39;t have, when  <br/>
no one&#39;s watching it&#39;s enticing to reach for what you can&#39;t have even  <br/>
if you don&#39;t particularly want it. When the world is divided between  <br/>
what you like and what you don&#39;t like, there&#39;s no reason to reach for  <br/>
what you don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
As a peaceful person, I enjoy reading mysteries where people die  <br/>
often gruesome deaths, enjoy the occasional video game where I kill  <br/>
things with various weapons and stomp on buildings. I played Man from  <br/>
U.N.C.L.E. as a child. But I&#39;ve never done any of those things in  <br/>
real life and have zero desire to.<br/>
<br/>
If you live your values and provide a loving home for your son, why  <br/>
would he choose to be a violent person?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761952771">almost forgot - quiet is often repressed anger as well, which can have<br/>
problems of its own.<br/>
<br/>
from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.canville.net/malone/controlanger.html">http://www.canville.net/malone/controlanger.html</a><br/>
<br/>
According to a well-known psychiatrist, Dr. John Terlesky, &quot;Having<br/>
angry thoughts are a normal part of life. There is nothing abnormal<br/>
about them. However, when anger is repressed for long periods of time,<br/>
it comes out twice as strong as when it was repressed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is well documented in the mental health field that repressed anger<br/>
is a leading cause for depression. If an individual is not permitted<br/>
to express himself, or does not permit himself to express his negative<br/>
feelings, the feelings are turned on himself. Many suicides and<br/>
homicides are a result of anger that was repressed over time.<br/>

<br/>
I have a kid who&#39;s very quiet.  He doesn&#39;t like loud noise at all.  He<br/>
listens to music with the volume low.  He listens to TV with the volume<br/>
low.  <br/>
<br/>
And yet...<br/>
<br/>
He started watching monster movies when he was about three years old.  <br/>
He loved the old Godzilla movies and all the bad sci-fi B movies from the<br/>
forties, fifties and sixties.  He loves movies in general and has lately<br/>
been watching all the movies based (however loosely)  on H.P. Lovecraft&#39;s<br/>
stories.   He loves movie violence.  We&#39;ve seen Kill Bill (1 and 2) too<br/>
many times to count and he loves the glorious blood fountain of lopped<br/>
heads and limbs.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s had unlimited access to television, video games, music and the<br/>
Internet.  <br/>
<br/>
And yet...<br/>
<br/>
***Watch your habits, for they become character.***<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also a vegan, never even swats a mosquito, catches flies to take<br/>
them outside, knows the local wildlife rehabbers and has rescued many<br/>
wild birds, has never hit another person or critter,  and is the most<br/>
gentle, non violent person I&#39;ve ever known.   He gave five hundred<br/>
dollars of his savings to help pay the expenses for our sick cat.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t even know.   He&#39;d walked to the bank and made a withdrawal that<br/>
morning when he went to return some videos.  Later at the animal hospital<br/>
while I was talking with the Vet he made a deposit on the bill.   I<br/>
didn&#39;t know until several days later when I went in to pay.   <br/>
<br/>
I always thought it would be more violent of me to prevent him from doing<br/>
and seeing and hearing what he was interested in than for him to see fake<br/>
violence on TV.   I thought that real violence of a big person<br/>
controlling and limiting a small person had more potential to do harm<br/>
than all the pretend violence on TV or video games.  <br/>
<br/>
I never made him watch violent TV and I never stopped him from watching<br/>
what he wanted.  If I thought something might be scary or disturbing I&#39;d<br/>
say so but he was free to decide to watch.  I watched with him, helped<br/>
him skip parts if he wanted to, more often helped him rewind to parts he<br/>
wanted to see again or make sense of.   We had many talks about movies,<br/>
acting, special effects, story telling, etc. and we still do.   He wants<br/>

think clearly about how they are different.<br/>
<br/>
A child may choose to eat cotton candy but who will it harm? A child  <br/>
may choose to eat a lot of cotton candy and feel yucky (or not!) but  <br/>
who will it harm?<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have found when there are no controls on food, children  <br/>
eat because they&#39;re hungry not because there&#39;s sugar available.  <br/>
Often, when food has been controlled -- when distinctions have been  <br/>
made between good food that you can eaten any time and bad food that  <br/>
can only be eaten in limited quantities -- then children will binge  <br/>
because the controls are lifted. They often will eat large amounts of  <br/>
formerly forbidden foods because they finally can, not because they  <br/>
want to. It does eventually level off when they&#39;re confident that the  <br/>
controls won&#39;t return.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How can the real violence of controlling someone be uplifting to the  <br/>
soul or the relationship?<br/>
<br/>
That statement implies that you plan on your child only experiencing  <br/>
things that are up lifting. It&#39;s going to be a very limited  <br/>
experience with the world! There&#39;s plenty in the world that&#39;s just  <br/>
plain fun or relaxing or enjoyable or challenging or ... that  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be classified as uplifting to the soul.<br/>
<br/>
The better question to ask is is something doing harm? Unschoolers  <br/>
find that control is harmful to the relationship. (That doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
we cut ourselves out of the picture. We&#39;re there walking by their  <br/>
side.) But that free exploration is not harmful because while a child  <br/>
may explore, if they are loved and treated with respect, they don&#39;t  <br/>
want to hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Pretend violence, knowing that what you&#39;re doing won&#39;t hurt anyone,  <br/>
exploring a different world -- a violent world for instance -- that  <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t want to live in, can be fun. My daughter and I might  <br/>
like to play Godzilla on the GameCube but I sure wouldn&#39;t want to be  <br/>
him and get blasted into buildings by energy bolts ;-) I enjoy  <br/>
watching Kill Bill but I want to live far far away from that world.  <br/>
Enjoying a fantasy world that contains violence has nothing to do  <br/>
with a desire to be violent.<br/>
<br/>
Viewing all art helps us discern (on our own terms) good from bad.  <br/>
Viewing only good art teaches us what others think is good. It&#39;s and  <br/>
exercise in memorization. Experiencing pretend violence can in fact  <br/>
reinforce a desire to live in a peaceful world!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-98904169">This is true for me as well.  I grew up in a quiet home, where quiet<br/>
was <br/>
commanded.  There was plenty of violence mostly from adults, even from <br/>

child must either interface violently and hatefully within oneself or <br/>
after a certain age it faces outwardly, and the risk is a sudden <br/>
unmasking of violence. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741282440">Joyce said &gt;&gt;...It&#39;s easy when they&#39;re onlies and very young. We *are* in<br/>
control of <br/>
<br/>
their environment and it seems easy to assume we&#39;ll always be able to <br/>
<br/>
filter the world so they only experience what is kind and good. But <br/>
<br/>
to do that we have to cut them off from the world. We can&#39;t let them <br/>
<br/>
play with kids who turn sticks into guns, or let them see carnivorous <br/>
<br/>
dinosaurs eating peaceful plant eaters, or let them know that there <br/>
<br/>
is cruelty in the world....&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This conversation reminds me of The Giver by Lois Lowry.  The society seems<br/>
so sweet and polite and orderly until you learn the truth about how they<br/>
achieve it.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when my first child was little and our house really was very<br/>
peaceful and quiet a lot of the time.  But the thought of trying to keep him<br/>
at that stage instead of joyfully following him into his various other<br/>
stages with all the noisy messy wonderfulness would be really sad.  It&#39;s<br/>
great,though, to live in that place with him while he&#39;s there.  The house<br/>
was a much &quot;livelier&quot; environment by the time #3 came along.  But her sweet<br/>
peaceful stage purred along just beneath the din.  Her noisy stage was even<br/>
louder than the others&#39; because the point of it is to be heard.  She had to<br/>
be heard over all of our busy lives -and she was : )   FWIW, it&#39;s the<br/>
oldest, who had that quiet toddler hood , who is biggest into video games<br/>
and such now.  The little one (now 5) doesn&#39;t watch near as much TV though<br/>
she&#39;s welcome to it.   <br/>

For the pre-video games analysis of similar ideas, Karl Jung and Bruno <br/>
Bettelheim, both of whom were involved in early psychiatry and were interested in <br/>
the situations and characters in fairy tales and religious stories, and how <br/>
people learn from them and how they process ideas about evil.   Some of their <br/>
stuff seems dated, but the idea that it can be   useful at some point for children <br/>
to think about violence and danger isn&#39;t new.<br/>

When The Simpsons first came out there was great hue and cry that children <br/>
would identify with Bart and all become bratty.   Why no hue and cry that dads <br/>
would identify with Homer and become dangerously misguided fathers?    Partly, <br/>
many adults think children are stupid.    Partly, they just hadn&#39;t considered <br/>
the value of a bad example, a silly/crazy HORRIBLY bad example.<br/>

Children are smarter than the world gives them credit for. They can<br/>
understand the difference between television and reality, they can<br/>
play games and see things that they would never want to actually act out.<br/>

I think it comes down to trust. If you don&#39;t think children can choose<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The most amazing breakthrough moment for me, as I came to understand  <br/>
and embrace unschooling, occurred during a talk that Sandra Dodd gave  <br/>
at a homeschool conference. She was encouraging people to &quot;be brave&quot;  <br/>
in their thinking - to consider all options, to really open our minds  <br/>
and consider possibilities that we might normally automatically  <br/>
reject. She said it was safe to think &quot;dangerous thoughts&quot; and that  <br/>
if we were afraid, to duct-tape ourselves to a chair and get someone  <br/>
to be a spotter for us and just sit there and think all the dangerous  <br/>
thoughts we could. She said that when we were done, we&#39;d still be  <br/>
there, still in that chair, nobody else would even KNOW what we&#39;d  <br/>
thought, and, if we wanted, we could go on as if we&#39;d never thought  <br/>
those thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
I took it as a challenge - the idea that I was self-censoring my own  <br/>
thinking hadn&#39;t even ever occurred to me (censored, itself &lt;g&gt;). So  <br/>
right there, in the conference, I tried to rummage around in my brain  <br/>
and see if I could find something to think about that was  <br/>
&quot;dangerous.&quot; I remember one of the things I thought was: &quot;Maybe I  <br/>
should never have had kids because I might be an awful parent and  <br/>
ruin their lives.&quot; Another thing I thought was, &quot;I really wasted many  <br/>
years in school while I focused on being the &quot;good&quot; student and  <br/>
worrying about pleasing teachers.&quot; I didn&#39;t write all these things  <br/>
down - I just edged toward ideas in my head and was aware when I had  <br/>
the urge to look the other way and I made myself pay attention. It  <br/>
was amazing - incredibly liberating. I WAS afraid to let go and do it  <br/>
too much - afraid that I&#39;d embarrass myself by speaking out loud or  <br/>
something. But I was forever changed right then and there. My  <br/>
awareness of my OWN capacity for self-delusion, for rationalization,  <br/>
for projection, for avoidance of uncomfortable ideas, was raised and  <br/>
there was no going back.<br/>
<br/>
I do NOT believe that our thoughts somehow automatically become our  <br/>
words - not that directly, anyway. And there are so many times when  <br/>
people&#39;s words do NOT become actions - hypocrisy, lies, broken  <br/>
promises, good intentions with no follow-through - those all happen  <br/>
all the time.<br/>
<br/>
It all sounds nice - it has a ring of logical steps, one following  <br/>
from another - but it isn&#39;t really logical.<br/>

gave   me a copy, and I tried a couple of times later (once very recently, and I <br/>
wanted to like it).<br/>
<br/>
I confessed to Pam that it agitated me so much that I wanted to slap the <br/>
performers and then go and find the composer and slap him.    Luckily, though, I <br/>
could just turn it off (I had rented it on DVD, though I had a copy on tape, so <br/>
I could listen while I worked online).   Much more peaceful to turn it off, <br/>
and I didn&#39;t REALLY want to slap anyone, but it gave me that agitated, <br/>
irritated adrenaline rush that makes people want to squeal in an unfocussed expression <br/>
of &quot;STOP IT!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very little music has ever affected me that way. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Hmmm,, I saw  an  &quot;Into the Woods&quot;  down in Minneapolis at The Children&#39;s Theatre,  but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the same thing.  If was fun,  I remember really big trees.   But not a whole lot more,, some good humor I think,  I remember the kids at the time didn&#39;t get all the jokes but they liked the storybook characters that were in it.  Giants I think, and something about shoes?  Man,, my memory.  &lt; . &lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the same.<br/>

DARK and scary and sexual and very heavy. It is Steven Sondheim and  <br/>
filled with word play.<br/>
<br/>
Even the first half - the mixture of different fairy tales - is  <br/>
extremely original and clever and intricate.<br/>

Roxana is playing Rapunzel in it, right now, in a community college  <br/>
production.<br/>

The song, &quot;Children will Listen,&quot; sung by the witch (played by  <br/>
Bernadette Peters in the video/dvd version), is just incredible.  <br/>
Makes me cry every time.<br/>
