<div id="ygrps-yiv-877476014">&lt;&lt;You suddenly realize that your little one is very<br/>
big and mature, and <br/>
very, <br/>
very grown up?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh boy, can I relate.<br/>
Trevor is going to be 14 in just over a month. We have these really interesting conversations now, about spirituality and family and ideas....very cool. He called me at work Thursday night and said &quot;Mom, I&#39;m doing laundry and I need to know if the big blanket and that rug can go in the same load.&quot;<br/>
Well drop my drawers! He&#39;s choosing to do laundry with no adults present? :) Cool again.<br/>
He&#39;s been sitting and helping Jared with his reading, and swooping down to help Jalen when he fusses. He&#39;s really a neat guy, in spite of the warped sense of humor. In that deparment he&#39;s quite sick in the head. hehe<br/>

Oh boy Ren, this is my son too.  I think there is just something very cool <br/>
about his wierdness,...like there&#39;s this deep, very unique crazy talent that <br/>
people like Jack Black or Jim Carrey or Chris Kattan (sp) have.  My son can also <br/>
do spot-on impressions of people and their voices.  More than once I&#39;ve <br/>
yelled, &quot;Who&#39;s messing with so-and-so&quot; thinking Michael, or Kelsey were yelling <br/>
cause he was tickling them or wrestling them.  It turned out it was CJ imitating <br/>
them.  He can also do many foreign accents...LOL...and can do entire scenes <br/>
from movies word for word.  He&#39;s often dancing through the store or walking funny <br/>
when I&#39;m with him.  He can almost never just give a straight answer for <br/>
something.  He&#39;s 15, BTW.<br/>
<br/>
Thank God he&#39;s never been in school.....I KNOW he would have been labled ADHD <br/>
or Hyper, or something!<br/>
