<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837271022">Hey Kim, &quot;runs with scissors&quot;!  When I read that phrase after your name <br/>
Tuesday, I just cracked up!!  Do you by any chance get the Wireless catalog?  <br/>
They have some hysterical t-shirts and sweatshirts, and  in fact, have a <br/>
shirt that says &quot;Runs with  scissors&quot; !!  They also have a great father/son <br/>
shirt set .  The son&#39;s says &quot;Chip off the old block&quot; and the dad&#39;s says &quot;The <br/>
OLD BLOCK&quot;.  If anyone is interested, there is a web site listed on the <br/>
catalog: www.wirelesstoo.com.   Thanks for the laugh!                           <br/>
                        Karen-- still giggling in IND</div>
