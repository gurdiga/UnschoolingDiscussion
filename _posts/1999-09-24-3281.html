<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551829460"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The temptation to turn play into<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;educational moments&quot; while an understandable impulse, is, I think,<br/>
problematic.<br/>
Maybe it works well with your kids but mine find it meddlesome and invasive.<br/>
Maybe I just don&#39;t have the touch or maybe they just can tell that Papa is<br/>
just<br/>
being pedantic which they sense is really my not so hidden agenda of what I<br/>
think<br/>
they need to know.  If it is truly my observation of something that I find<br/>
genuinely fascinating they are much more tolerant of it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so much a matter of having *the touch,* as it is being<br/>
able to appreciate and wonder at what&#39;s within your grasp<br/>
already...stretching it to encompass what&#39;s *out there.* To Ponder, and<br/>
wonder aloud WITH kids. Not drag them along against their will, but test the<br/>
waters. : )<br/>
<br/>
If mom or dad notices that something the kids have made LOOKS sort of like a<br/>
DNA molecule...Can&#39;t they mention it? It just might be interesting to the<br/>
child. Particularly if there isn&#39;t someone around telling them that they<br/>
aren&#39;t *supposed* to be genuinely interested in such a thing. : )<br/>
<br/>
I suppose that the way I see Learning from Legos and other such things, is<br/>
that in most of the mundane or **seemingly** little things that we do, or<br/>
that our children find pleasure in doing, there are big principles involved<br/>
that they might actually enjoy. knowing about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And while we&#39;re on the subject of LEGO and the mundane things of life...  I<br/>
have just returned from the grocery store with my LEGO MANIAC son who, in<br/>
the interest of saving time, I asked to go get a couple of loaves of bread<br/>
while I got the eggs and milk.  Zac returned with two loaves of **THE** most<br/>
expensive bread in the store, whereupon we returned jointly to the bread<br/>
aisle, and through comparison of brands and price tags, found the least<br/>
expensive, leaving us an extra buck or two to add to the &quot;Future LEGO<br/>
Purchase&quot; pot.  &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
