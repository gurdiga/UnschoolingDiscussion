<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339093396"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;How old is Isabel?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ross also used to have a fit when he lost. Would get very upset. Would <br/>
quit or throw parts of the game around if he felt he was going to lose.<br/>
I <br/>
usually let him win without his knowing what I was doing. I think he was<br/>
<br/>
about 10 years old when he began to be able to accept the idea that <br/>
sometimes he would lose. It wasn&#39;t until age 13-14 that he was mostly <br/>
comfortable with losing, though, he still much prefers to win.<br/>
<br/>
Kids do mature and learn.<br/>

Isabel is 5.  Really just starting to learn about losing, board games<br/>
and all that.  I really appreciate the advice given on this board<br/>
because of the perspective that children have feelings and ideas and<br/>
these are to be respected.  I was raised to control at all costs the<br/>
intense emotions that you can feel as a child, and still feel as an<br/>
adult . that if a child throws a tantrum at losing a game, they are<br/>
&quot;little brats&quot; and should be spanked and sent to their rooms - &quot;I<br/>
bothered to take the time and play with you and this is how you repay<br/>
me?!&quot;.  I read with interest the spanking discussion.  It&#39;s been<br/>
difficult to throw away everything you&#39;ve been taught from day one but<br/>
in no way can I express (in under 2000 words anyway &lt;g&gt;)the eye-opening<br/>
change that this list has started in our lives.  I say &quot;started&quot; because<br/>
I&#39;m still learning and will be for a long time.  I could go on about my<br/>
youth . suffice it to say my dad&#39;s favorite and most used expression was<br/>
&quot;You make me sick.&quot;  I want to be sure that what I say to my children<br/>
conveys the love I feel for them and the respect I have for who they<br/>
are.  <br/>
 <br/>
She has not shown any interest in karate so far, although, she knows<br/>
what it is.  Right now she&#39;s into princesses and dresses.  I&#39;ve signed<br/>
her up for a total of 5 things and she has asked me not to sign her up<br/>
for anything else.  She wants to drop out of Daisies (the group below<br/>
Brownies).  I said that was fine but that I still had to go because I<br/>
had signed up to be her group leader and still had to honor that<br/>
obligation.  She stayed in for 8 months and I could tell she didn&#39;t like<br/>
it fairly early on.  Her biggest thing about group activities, and I<br/>
knew this, was that she HATES doing what the rest of the group is doing.<br/>
While everyone else is happy drawing a flower, Bel insists on drawing<br/>
butterflies.  This causes a lot of conflict in a group setting.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mind it, but when the instructor wants it done one way and she refuses,<br/>
it can be disruptive to the group and she gets irritated.  I love that<br/>
she is an individual and I know she will eventually find those interests<br/>
where she can be in a group and still do her &quot;thing&quot;.  I thought about<br/>
drama club because you can embellish your character, etc.  but she&#39;s<br/>
said no, she&#39;s not ready to stand up in front of people and do a play.<br/>
Any other suggestions would be great!  <br/>
 <br/>
I like the idea of everyone agreeing on who will win before the game<br/>
starts.  It really does take the &quot;competitiveness&quot; out of a game.  It<br/>
also gives her the chance of deciding to let someone else win. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231901538">There are several cooperative games out there where you win as a team <br/>
working as a group to rescue the princess or unlock a box.  Also there<br/>
are at least 2 out of print books on cooperative games; I know there is<br/>
one at the local library and cooperative games is part of the title.<br/>
Offers an alternative to competition for kids who have a hard time with<br/>
it (and I was one of those kids, and still battle with not being a sore<br/>
loser LOL)  <br/>

<br/>
Quit signing her up for stuff! Let her drop out of anything she wants to as<br/>
soon as she wants to. If she misses it, let her go back. She&#39;s only five.<br/>
Jayn (4) has ONE firmly scheduled activity - the modern dance/creative<br/>
movement class that she loves, also taken by all her friends from our<br/>
homeschool group. She is free to leave the class and come to me downstairs<br/>
whenever she wants, and will usually take a break towards the end of the<br/>
hour. We don&#39;t even get to Monday park day on a fully regular basis. Jayn<br/>
really does fill her time with playing and art and physical stuff. I am an<br/>
enormous believer, especially in artistic and creative endeavors, in<br/>
supplying materials (or other kids) and then backing off. Jayn always draws<br/>
precisely what she wants. <br/>
<br/>
Is it Bel or the instructor who is getting irritated? I think a word to the<br/>
instructor about Bel&#39;s freedom from required obedience might be in order. If<br/>
Bel is not being subjected to the other person&#39;s instructions, there may be<br/>
no disruption to the group.<br/>
<br/>
As cool as drama sounds for older folk, drama club may not allow her any<br/>
freedom if she is being asked to be a specific character, make specific<br/>
movements, stand somewhere specific for a specified length of time, and be<br/>
at all the rehearsals. Permission to embellish your character may come with<br/>
an improv group, but not always with a group that puts on a play. I suspect<br/>
that a group or class designed (probably by adults) for 5 year olds, would<br/>
have a lot of the &quot;now everyone be an animal/a tree/the wind&quot; type of games.<br/>
Jayn often pretends to be an animal - on her own schedule and instigation.<br/>
Would this really be something Bel would get into to at the moment?<br/>
<br/>
Unpleasant as it is to recall, most structured activities for folk this<br/>
young are designed to mimic or prepare kids for the culture and realities of<br/>
being in school, and often have the same kind of criteria for &quot;success&quot; as<br/>
classrooms - such as &quot;follows instructions&quot; and &quot;participates well in group<br/>
activities&quot;. I try very hard to make the vast majority of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
interactions with other homeschoolers, in activities that reflect a culture<br/>
of freedom and individual explorations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1978325158">In response to...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve signed her up for a total of 5 things and she has asked me not to<br/>
sign her up for anything else.  She wants to drop out of Daisies (the group<br/>
below Brownies).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh because when I initially read this I thought you were talking <br/>
about a girl who was probably in her teens...then I realized that she was <br/>
only five years old!  My son who is almost five sounds a lot like your <br/>
daughter.  He hates structure and anybody telling him how to do anything.  <br/>
And forget group activities.  Once when we were discussing what school was <br/>
like, I told him that he would have to ask the teacher to go to the <br/>
bathroom.  He looked at me incredulously and snorted, &quot;If I have to do that <br/>
then I will just turn up the music really loud, walk out the door and go <br/>
home.&quot;  I&#39;m still not sure exactly what the music is about, but I assume it <br/>
is symbolic of blocking out this authoritative figure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, often times I feel like I am not doing enough with my kids - <br/>
especially when I hear about all these &quot;great&quot; things other kids are doing <br/>
in preschools.  But then I think about how much cooler it is that my kids <br/>
get to relax all day and follow their own rhythms.<br/>
<br/>
I agree...I think you shouldn&#39;t do any classes with your daughter.  <br/>
Actually, I remember now when I was in some group - I think it was the <br/>
Brownies or Blue Birds or something like that.  There was this art activity <br/>
with eggs that all the girls were doing.  For some reason I was unable to <br/>
follow the instructor&#39;s directions and so the instructor told another adult <br/>
to go over and help me.  I remember feeling extremely humiliated as none of <br/>
the other girls were having difficulty.  I felt scared around the other <br/>
girls that I didn&#39;t know.  Looking back, I now realize that it never really <br/>
dawned on me back then that I didn&#39;t HAVE to be there...I just assumed I had <br/>
to be because my mom put me in it.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

at knowing where to draw the line on activities.  He likes to be less busy <br/>
than I do.<br/>
<br/>
Five is young to be involved in many outside activities.  Ross didn&#39;t start <br/>
karate until he was 8.<br/>

youth . suffice it to say my dad&#39;s favorite and most used expression was<br/>
&quot;You make me sick.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is so sad.<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry to say that.<br/>
I bet people said that to him and he was repeating it without ever really <br/>
hearing it or thinking about what it really meant.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said &quot;You little brat&quot; a lot.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; She wants to drop out of Daisies (the group below<br/>
Brownies).  I said that was fine but that I still had to go because I<br/>
had signed up to be her group leader and still had to honor that<br/>
obligation. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s not having fun, it&#39;s no longer her group and your obligation ends.<br/>
You&#39;re there because of her, and everyone there knows it, and I don&#39;t think <br/>
you have any obligation if she&#39;s not having fun.  Your obligation is really to <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She stayed in for 8 months and I could tell she didn&#39;t like<br/>
it fairly early on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How many months of that were you giving her a lesson in obligation?  Be her <br/>
partner!  If your team wants to do something different, bail out!  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that might make you feel better.  I pass them out at <br/>
conferences, but this is an online version.   Other unschoolers helped me phrase it <br/>
as a handout the first time I ever spoke at a conference, and I&#39;ve kept a <br/>
supply ever since:<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;This causes a lot of conflict in a group setting.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mind it,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Avoid groups for a while, I think, but I also think karate could be a life <br/>
changer for her.  It&#39;s much more individual than group.  (But if she doesn&#39;t <br/>
like it, don&#39;t press her for eight months.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I like the idea of everyone agreeing on who will win before the game<br/>
starts.  It really does take the &quot;competitiveness&quot; out of a game.  It<br/>
also gives her the chance of deciding to let someone else win. :-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
An idea:  You could throw dice or flip a coin at the beginning to see who&#39;s <br/>
going to win and then play the game with that slant.  If she sees at some point <br/>
that that&#39;s goofy, show her that the game is supposed to just play out <br/>
naturally and the winner chosen THAT way.<br/>
