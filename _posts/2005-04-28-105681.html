<div id="ygrps-yiv-1275232678">Today Holly and I (and Vincent King, another homeschooler friend) all spent  <br/>
the day at Sandia Prep, a private school here, where I played etymology games  <br/>
and told stories to my friend Mo Palmer&#39;s 7th grade history classes.  Holly  <br/>
just love to observe school kids. They had new desks and she got to sit in  <br/>
one.  Vincent&#39;s dad wants him to go to school next year, and this is his  school <br/>
of choice.  He&#39;s already done the formal all-day visitation, and I  thought <br/>
he might like to spend another day there.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly came home and played Halo II for a few hours and just had this IM  <br/>
exchange which really made her yell for me in the next room, and I went and got  <br/>
her dad too.  She&#39;s thrilled:  <br/>
 <br/>
BlazingOranges: hey<br/>
HiperSpaz232: u play halo well this is Moto Mac do u  rember?<br/>
BlazingOranges: oh yeah, i &#39;member<br/>
HiperSpaz232: well i was  looking at gamertag pics and u were one of scotts <br/>

BlazingOranges: really?<br/>
HiperSpaz232: yeah<br/>
HiperSpaz232:  what school do u go to<br/>
BlazingOranges: actually I&#39;m  homeschooled<br/>
HiperSpaz232: omg did u go to my school  today?<br/>
BlazingOranges: kind of<br/>
BlazingOranges: o mean  maybe?<br/>

HiperSpaz232: yeah i was  in there in activity when we were watching <br/>

BlazingOranges: oh my  god! that is so cool<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
While it&#39;s great that Holly&#39;s played with kids from New Zealand and England  <br/>
and all over north America, this is even more impressive, statistically  <br/>
speaking. &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s played with this girls several times  before.  <br/>
