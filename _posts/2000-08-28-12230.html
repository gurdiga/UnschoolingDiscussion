<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616292241">Hi Linda,<br/>
I am a new &#39;Unschooling&#39; Mom as well!  And I have had the same struggles<br/>
with the same issues too!  I am interested in others opinions as well, but I<br/>
want to throw my 2 cents in here!<br/>
<br/>
As for the internet and computer, we are all fighting for it, so we have<br/>
made the rule of 1 hour per person in concession!  I must say, they learn a<br/>
lot from the internet!  So I don&#39;t restrict that.  And I trust them enough<br/>
to go to sites responsibly.  We have discussed what sites are appropriate<br/>
and which ones aren&#39;t, and if they are in doubt, to ask me or their father<br/>
and/or to use their gut instinct (if it doesn&#39;t &#39;feel&#39; right, don&#39;t go<br/>
there).<br/>
<br/>
As for math.  I am going to explain to my girls how important it is and<br/>
hopefully, they will want to learn it!  I know my 14 yo will want to because<br/>
she is so afraid that she is not learning what she is supposed to anyway!<br/>
It is my 10 yo that I will have to convince!  But I want it to be up to them<br/>
to have the responsibility to take the initiative.  I don&#39;t know if my<br/>
approach will work, but we&#39;ll see!  my 10 yo had to learn some math for her<br/>
Harry Potter website, because she is making recipes from the book, and she<br/>
is trying different recipes out.  And in order to do that, she has to use a<br/>
lot of fractions, adding and subtracting fractions until she gets the recipe<br/>
right!  I am trying to look for other opportunities for her to learn math<br/>
without it looking like a lesson!<br/>
<br/>
I have had a personal tug-of-war about what bedtime to instill.  My DH<br/>
believes that our 14 yo can set her own bedtime and I reluctantly agreed. At<br/>
first,  she went to bed at midnight, 2 am at the latest, but she would be<br/>
very tired the next day and she has been getting to bed earlier on her own<br/>
now!  We have given a little bit of leeway for our 10 yo, but she still has<br/>
a bedtime of 10:00, although we let her stay up later if she is doing<br/>
something important to her.  I let them get up at whatever time they want,<br/>
but, they realize that if they get up too late, there is a lot that they<br/>
miss out on, sometimes a trip!  If I go somewhere and they are not up, they<br/>
do not get to go!  Of course when I tell them the night before I am going<br/>
somewhere, or we have a homeschooling group meeting, they do go to sleep<br/>
earlier.  I have also taught them about our Circadian rhythms and how it can<br/>
get irregular and make you feel lousy when it is messed up by going to bed<br/>
at different times.  And in the summer, when it gets hot early, if they are<br/>
not up when it is cool, they miss out on gardening which they love!  I<br/>
guess, this a lesson in responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Just relax and we will all get through this together!<br/>
<br/>
Kim<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369627802">HERE IS A TECHNICAL QUESTION:I&#39;m a &quot;newbie&quot; so after I read the posted <br/>
messages and want to respond to someone else&#39;s response to me, do I click on <br/>
&quot;REPLY&quot; as I did this time, or &quot;POST MESSAGE&quot; (at the beginning). I want it <br/>
to be posted as a response to them, but thought that if I click THEIR E-MAIL <br/>
ADDRESS, it would just go to them and not be posted...(Yes, I am a &quot;newbie&quot; <br/>
to this computer stuff too!)Please enlighten me, someone with a good heart.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I want to respond to the person at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:braunville@...">braunville@...</a>  who so <br/>
generously shared with me about my questions on SET BED TIMES, COMPUTER-USE <br/>
LIMITS and MATH (to force or not to force).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! Your sharing about child #1 was especially helpful to me. Neither <br/>
of my ds are at all interested in math and never have enjoyed it. I <br/>
definitely need to &quot;learn to relax&quot; as you put it and mellow out about <br/>
it.They know we have their next Saxon math books; I&#39;ll just not say anything <br/>
and see what ever happens, I guess. We do include basic math that comes up <br/>
in everyday life, of course, but that is very basic adding, sub,mult, and <br/>
div. and their math books took them beyond that acouple of yrs. ago...<br/>
<br/>
Also, a question: WHAT IS &quot;AOL&#39;S FILTER&quot; FOR THE INTERNET AND HOW DO I GET <br/>
THAT AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST? We just got our computer and have no <br/>
&quot;filter&quot;.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;You might make the suggestion to your group that they do a parents night <br/>
&gt;out<br/>
&gt;rather than a moms night out. Our group does this and it works out great.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow! What a neat idea! (Both the taping and the pulling from school because<br/>
&gt;of it) That is really neat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;:-) Diane<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When they went to school I always video taped<br/>
&gt; &gt;  them on this day, getting on the bus, and then telling me how the first<br/>
&gt;day<br/>
&gt; &gt;  went. That tape was a big motivator in the decision to pull them out of<br/>
&gt; &gt;  school when I looked back at the changes over the years-from a <br/>
&gt;wonderful<br/>
&gt; &gt;  family that you would love to know, to a bunch of rude brats <br/>
&gt;interrupting<br/>
&gt; &gt;  each other. Maybe I will tape again tomorrow to see what a difference<br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt; &gt;  is now.<br/>

&gt;Unschooling Dads! is now open for business. &lt;G&gt;  It&#39;s the 4th folder on the<br/>
&gt;list.  I hope all the long term unschooling dads here on this list will at<br/>
&gt;least say hi, as many newbies come to our boards  The men seem very<br/>
&gt;reluctant to post.  Hearing your collective voices would be an awesome <br/>
&gt;thing<br/>

&gt;Hi John....you&#39;re not missing anything by not reading &quot;Parents&quot; or<br/>
&gt;&quot;Parenting&quot;....Try Home Education Magazine if you haven&#39;t already. They<br/>
&gt;always seem to have a few articles written by or about dads.<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: Digest Number 745<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am new to this site. I have a 10 year old and 13 year old and am curious<br/>
&gt;about what you all think, unschooling-wise, about: 1)SET TIMES FOR BED vs.<br/>
&gt;ANYTIME IS OKAY...same with rising time. 2)Use of the computer/internet:<br/>
&gt;SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT? 3)Last year, we homeschooled with a curriculum <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;Oak Meadow. We did the Saxon Math lessons everyday...after lots of <br/>
&gt;coercing.<br/>
&gt;They both learned alot inspite of resistance. Now we are unschooling <br/>
&gt;(again)<br/>
&gt;and I am having trouble just LETTING GO of math...I doubt that they are <br/>
&gt;ever<br/>
&gt;going to choose to do it on their own...the stuff they were learning, we<br/>
&gt;will probably never come across naturally (multiplying fractions, algebra,<br/>
&gt;etc.)so, what happens if they want to take an SAT test later; I guess they<br/>
&gt;just have to &quot;knuckle down&quot; and learn lots of math all at once THEN? I <br/>
&gt;think<br/>
&gt;I need a pep talk...<br/>

&gt; &gt;my hubby and I haven&#39;t really discussed homeschooling/unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt;philosophy&#39;s as of yet ( our oldest is 3).  But after much discussion on<br/>
&gt; &gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt;the other decisions we have made it comes over to my way of thinking.....<br/>

&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; I got tired of<br/>
&gt; &gt;  switching them and started using my right hand for the mouse or I<br/>
&gt; &gt;  would use my lefthand and had to remember not to use my index finger<br/>
&gt; &gt;  to click with. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;OH MY!  I just realized that whenever my dd does play on the computer we<br/>
&gt; &gt;make<br/>
&gt; &gt;her use the mouse just as it is!!  I NEVER thought about changing the<br/>
&gt; &gt;buttons!!  Wow, I guess I&#39;ll have to change the mouse and see if there is <br/>
&gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;difference?!  DD does eat, write, and do MOST tasks with her left hand <br/>
&gt;but<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ve noticed she throw with her right hand (quite well) and I guess she<br/>
&gt; &gt;also<br/>
&gt; &gt;uses the mouse with her right -- I&#39;ll have to let you know what happens <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt; &gt;she uses the left with the mouse.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Again, thanks to all who are responding -- the more I read and listen to<br/>
&gt; &gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt;of you the more confident I am becoming about the hschooling endeavor.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt;am<br/>
&gt; &gt;looking into a support group in my area (DE).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Carron, on the behavior issues -- so far so good!  I guess I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt;doing<br/>
&gt; &gt;the Love and Logic thing *correctly* but I am guessing it is just going <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt;take some time.  I only started implementing the whole L&L ideas in <br/>
&gt;January<br/>
&gt; &gt;of this year.  Also, late that same month my ds was born so we were ALL<br/>
&gt; &gt;adjusting to life with a newborn.  I&#39;ll keep up the choices and<br/>
&gt; &gt;implementing<br/>
&gt; &gt;my own if she doesn&#39;t make a choice.  Now, I just have to work on REALLY<br/>
&gt; &gt;keeping my voice calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a screamer <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;think I REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)  Also, the Library thinks<br/>
&gt; &gt;they<br/>
&gt; &gt;may have the book which they got from the interlibrary loan service -- a<br/>
&gt; &gt;local college apparently has or will have several copies of the Toddler<br/>
&gt; &gt;book<br/>
&gt; &gt;you referred to -- I am really looking forward to reading it!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks for the support and advice!<br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; my hubby and I haven&#39;t really discussed homeschooling/unschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  philosophy&#39;s as of yet ( our oldest is 3).  But after much discussion<br/>
&gt; &gt;on<br/>
&gt; &gt;all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  the other decisions we have made it comes over to my way of<br/>
&gt; &gt;thinking.....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Julie<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;LOL.  Were you a debater in school?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My husband observed after the last unschooling conference that we went to<br/>
&gt; &gt;that homeschooling, the research into it, the websites, the books, the<br/>
&gt; &gt;conferences, the support groups, are overwhelmingly feminine in nature.<br/>
&gt; &gt;That&#39;s completely understandable since moms are the primary <br/>
&gt;homeschoolers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;He sees in talking with other hs dads, that there is often the attitude<br/>
&gt; &gt;that<br/>
&gt; &gt;homeschooling is the mom&#39;s job, and that the dad may have some concerns<br/>
&gt; &gt;about<br/>
&gt; &gt;it, but if she&#39;s willing to commit to it, he&#39;s willing to &quot;give it a <br/>
&gt;try&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;But, they often take a wait and see attitude.  Then, as time progresses,<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;the dad sees that the children and mom are happy, productive people, that<br/>
&gt; &gt;the<br/>
&gt; &gt;kids are learning and they won&#39;t be social misfits, he &quot;comes around&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;becomes an advocate.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;This happened with my husband, too.  But wouldn&#39;t it be so much more<br/>
&gt; &gt;productive if we could bring these guys around sooner?  We could save so<br/>
&gt; &gt;much<br/>
&gt; &gt;emotional energy if we didn&#39;t have to deal with our <br/>
&gt;job--homeschooling--and<br/>
&gt; &gt;with our partner&#39;s doubts, too.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Wow, Michelle, that turns everybody upside down!  It is so hard dealing<br/>
&gt; &gt;with<br/>
&gt; &gt;a new baby and your other child&#39;s behavioral issues at the same time!<br/>
&gt; &gt;Especially when I bet a lot of those behaviors are a direct result of<br/>
&gt; &gt;having<br/>
&gt; &gt;the new baby in the house.  I promise things will get better.  But it <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt; &gt;take time and consistency.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Now, I just have to work on REALLY<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  keeping my voice calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a <br/>
&gt;screamer<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  think I REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;That&#39;s my biggest problem, too.  I really have to pay attention to my<br/>
&gt; &gt;voice,<br/>
&gt; &gt;even now.  There are still times when my son tries my patience -- that <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt; &gt;never go away, I&#39;m sure -- but it has gotten easier.   Even if a calm <br/>
&gt;voice<br/>
&gt; &gt;is not second nature, I&#39;ve tried to make it a habit to stop and think<br/>
&gt; &gt;before<br/>
&gt; &gt;I say anything (the old count to 10 trick).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Also, the Library thinks they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  may have the book which they got from the interlibrary loan service <br/>
&gt;--<br/>
&gt; &gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  local college apparently has or will have several copies of the <br/>
&gt;Toddler<br/>
&gt; &gt;book<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  you referred to -- I am really looking forward to reading it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;  Thanks for the support and advice!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;You&#39;re welcome.  I really believe in Love and Logic, and I know that with<br/>
&gt; &gt;consistency, it works.  You guys are going through a really trying time,<br/>
&gt; &gt;right now.  But, as the bible says, this too shall pass.  If you have any<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Death Row Marv is unbelievably vulgar and gross.  It<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Carron, on the behavior issues -- so far so good!  I guess I have<br/>
&gt; &gt;been doing  the Love and Logic thing *correctly* but I am guessing it<br/>
&gt; &gt;is just going to  take some time.  I only started implementing the<br/>
&gt; &gt;whole L&L ideas in January  of this year.  Also, late that same month<br/>
&gt; &gt;my ds was born so we were ALL  adjusting to life with a newborn.<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;ll keep up the choices and implementing my own if she doesn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt; &gt;a choice.  Now, I just have to work on REALLY keeping my voice<br/>
&gt; &gt;calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a screamer and I think I<br/>
&gt; &gt;REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I can relate REALLY well to this. I naturally have a loud voice since<br/>
&gt; &gt;birth. I was a screamer as an infant. I was so loud that people would<br/>
&gt; &gt;move away from my parents when they sat down at church. I am also the<br/>
&gt; &gt;second of six children. It got pretty loud around the house with so<br/>
&gt; &gt;many kids. It has taken me most of my adult life to hear that I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;talking louder than everyone else. Now that I have kids, I realize<br/>
&gt; &gt;that when I am frustrated my volum rises, again. I have learned that<br/>
&gt; &gt;keeping the radio and t.v. down or off helps a lot. I have also<br/>
&gt; &gt;learned that when I am REALLY upset with the children to use a softer<br/>
&gt; &gt;calmer voice. You can almost tell how irritated I am by how calm and<br/>
&gt; &gt;controled my voice is. It is when things are calm around here that I<br/>
&gt; &gt;tend to lose control of my volum. I am still working on the control<br/>
&gt; &gt;in those frustrating times though. Think I always will. Corallyn<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;my dh became an adamant<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;unschooler.  Something clicked.  He came away telling me that kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;even think about academics until they&#39;re twelve, that the body of<br/>
&gt; &gt;knowledge<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;is changing so rapidly we can&#39;t possibly to hope to learn what we need <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;know in school or even homeschooling with a curriculum, that our kids<br/>
&gt; &gt;will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;learn what they need to when they need to -- period!.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Your husband has de-schooled. Isn&#39;t it great how it works! When I started<br/>
&gt; &gt;out I had all these wonderful plans for unit studies that I thought would<br/>
&gt; &gt;be<br/>
&gt; &gt;fun, and interesting, and could incorporate all the usual school subjects<br/>
&gt; &gt;into one topic. It didn&#39;t take me long to find out that what sounded fun<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;interesting to me might sound dumb and boring to the kids. Or, more <br/>
&gt;likely,<br/>
&gt; &gt;it would appeal to one kid, but not the others. So, after a few months of<br/>
&gt; &gt;trying to force people to participate in all my carefully planned fun, I<br/>
&gt; &gt;began my own de-schooling too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Now, though, after two years, it seems that the kids would like to do <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the things that I threw out. Now that they are truly free to learn <br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt; &gt;they want, they do want to learn. Now they will put the effort into it, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;seem to be able to appreciate each others contributions and interests. <br/>
&gt;So,<br/>
&gt; &gt;we may do a unit. This time, however, it won&#39;t be me planning it all out<br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt;telling them what they are to do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;School starts in our district tomorrow. We traditionally have breakfast <br/>
&gt;in<br/>
&gt; &gt;our garden and watch the bus pass by. We celebrate our freedom and do a<br/>
&gt; &gt;little thinking and talking about where we want to go with school this <br/>
&gt;year<br/>
&gt; &gt;and what we would like to do. When they went to school I always video <br/>
&gt;taped<br/>
&gt; &gt;them on this day, getting on the bus, and then telling me how the first <br/>
&gt;day<br/>
&gt; &gt;went. That tape was a big motivator in the decision to pull them out of<br/>
&gt; &gt;school when I looked back at the changes over the years-from a wonderful<br/>
&gt; &gt;family that you would love to know, to a bunch of rude brats interrupting<br/>
&gt; &gt;each other. Maybe I will tape again tomorrow to see what a difference <br/>
&gt;there<br/>
&gt; &gt;is now.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am new to this site. I have a 10 year old and 13 year old and am <br/>
&gt;curious<br/>
&gt; &gt;  about what you all think, unschooling-wise, about: 1)SET TIMES FOR BED <br/>
&gt;vs.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  ANYTIME IS OKAY...same with rising time. 2)Use of the <br/>
&gt;computer/internet:<br/>
&gt; &gt;  SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Depends on the needs of the family and the child(ren), IMO.  One of our <br/>
&gt;main<br/>
&gt;reasons to stay away from the ps thing is to have more control over our<br/>
&gt;personal lives and better time to spend together as a family.  In our <br/>
&gt;family,<br/>
&gt;we all live by Dad&#39;s schedule because he is the one with a schedule set by<br/>
&gt;outside influences (work).  DH has worked rotating shift work most of our<br/>
&gt;lives.  When he&#39;s on a night shift he would totally miss any family time if<br/>
&gt;we stick to a strict bedtime routine, especially when he works a swing <br/>
&gt;shift.<br/>
&gt;  Our ps routine for swing shift WAS:  Dad comes home from work after<br/>
&gt;midnight, sleeps until 9 or 10, by which time children have gone off to<br/>
&gt;school; dad would go to work just before children return from school and<br/>
&gt;children were in bed before dad returned from work.  YUCK!  (Just one of <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;many reasons we homeschool!)  Now, we all shift schedules according to <br/>
&gt;Dad&#39;s<br/>
&gt;work schedule.  (although it is a little hard for the family to do the<br/>
&gt;midnight to 7 a.m. routine, so we compromise as needed!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also think it depends on the needs of the child.  We have health problems<br/>
&gt;in our family which are exacerbated by disrupted sleep routines.  So, when<br/>
&gt;someone is in a health flare, it becomes important that there be some <br/>
&gt;routine<br/>
&gt;to encourage good sleep patterns.  Also, I can&#39;t sleep knowing there are<br/>
&gt;children up and about.  It&#39;s more a matter of wanting to be there/be <br/>
&gt;involved<br/>
&gt;with them than lack of trust.  Since I&#39;m most often the one with health<br/>
&gt;problems, my sleep needs take precedent over kid&#39;s schedule.  OTOH if <br/>
&gt;someone<br/>
&gt;else has a bigger/stronger need, we adjust.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The family time is most important to us.  We don&#39;t really care when the<br/>
&gt;family sleeps, but we have better quality of life and family time if we are<br/>
&gt;all on a similar schedule.  Our friends and extended family have learned to<br/>
&gt;not call at 8 a.m. and that they may catch us napping mid-afternoon, and <br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;learned to turn the phone off until I&#39;m up in the morning!  They&#39;ve also<br/>
&gt;learned that if they need to talk to someone at 2 a.m., the odds are really<br/>
&gt;good that I&#39;m up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It is my opinion that, as the parent, I have the responsibility to monitor<br/>
&gt;the health conditions of my children and insist on a bedtime that is best <br/>
&gt;for<br/>
&gt;the individual and the family, as needed.  I would definitely not be<br/>
&gt;comfortable having kids up until who knows when.  Having people up and <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;during sleep hours is not much of an issue because, regardless of which<br/>
&gt;schedule we are currently on, we have a bedtime routine which includes<br/>
&gt;reading, cuddling, family time and tucking in kidlet who is about to turn <br/>
&gt;12,<br/>
&gt;but not about to give up that routine(!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If someone has a hard time going to sleep at the designated hour, we<br/>
&gt;encourage reading or other quiet activity.  Especially when we are having <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;switch from one schedule to another.  (I would probably be a family bed<br/>
&gt;spokesperson if everyone else&#39;s snoring didn&#39;t keep me awake.  But that&#39;s<br/>
&gt;almost a different topic.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This has probably not been an answer that&#39;s helpful for you, except to <br/>
&gt;point<br/>
&gt;out that the needs of each family differ.  (What a long-winded way to say: <br/>
&gt;Do<br/>
&gt;what is best for you and your family.  &lt;bg&gt; )<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for limiting usage of computer/internet (or computer games).  Again, it<br/>
&gt;depends.  I&#39;m protective of where on the net my children go, so we use <br/>
&gt;AOL&#39;s<br/>
&gt;filter and also ask children to let us know when they are on the internet.<br/>
&gt;Plus, I hang out with them enough that it is not difficult for me to steer<br/>
&gt;them a different direction if I don&#39;t like where they are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have found we sometimes need to limit the time on the computer or using<br/>
&gt;video games due to general crabbiness.  IMO, too much time in front of any<br/>
&gt;electronic media has the same effect as too much time in front of TV or<br/>
&gt;stuffed behind a school desk...brain wave coma.  (Quickly recognizable by <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;loss of ability to hear mom&#39;s voice and the vacant stares when you actually<br/>
&gt;get them to look your way!  LOL)  We don&#39;t have fast rules about how much <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;too much, but watch our children&#39;s behavior and let that be our guide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As for math, we still use Saxon.  I love math and have no trouble getting <br/>
&gt;DS<br/>
&gt;to be enthusiastic about the subject.  We love the scientific aspects of it<br/>
&gt;and multiplying fractions is just the sort of topic our brain waves enjoy.<br/>
&gt;(sometimes comes in handy for solving video or puzzle game problems, too.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;When it&#39;s time for SAT&#39;s or college placement tests, they&#39;ll either learn <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;subject quickly in order to move on and meet their goal, or they&#39;ll take<br/>
&gt;remedial classes/find a tutor to get what they need when they need it.  So,<br/>
&gt;either method works.  We use a hybrid:  Use a textbook, but without <br/>
&gt;strictly<br/>
&gt;following the outline/schedule and look for opportunities to explore math<br/>
&gt;concepts in daily living.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If it helps any, I have 2 child-units.  One is an adult now.  We unschooled<br/>
&gt;pretty thoroughly from about age 15 on (read:  could NOT get the kid to do<br/>
&gt;any &#39;school&#39; work and eventually gave up with the theory that saving our<br/>
&gt;relationship with him was more important than cramming the &#39;necessary&#39; <br/>
&gt;school<br/>
&gt;work into his rebellious brain!)  The stinker went on to take his GED after <br/>
&gt;5<br/>
&gt;years of no formal school work, refused to study with a GED study guide or<br/>
&gt;look at any text books in order to prepare for the test, passed the GED <br/>
&gt;test<br/>
&gt;with flying colors the first try, has taken college courses, started his <br/>
&gt;own<br/>
&gt;family and has since gone on to become an electrician apprenticeship.  I<br/>
&gt;count that as success.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He learned what he needed when he was ready for it.  Waiting only helped <br/>
&gt;him<br/>
&gt;to be more ready for it.  I learned to relax the hard way!  We do things <br/>
&gt;much<br/>
&gt;differently for the younger son.  (That&#39;s the cool thing about 10 years<br/>
&gt;between kids, there is lots of time to analyze parenting decisions and <br/>
&gt;learn<br/>
&gt;for the second son.)  Luckily for us, the older one is so stubborn.  &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;As for math.  I am going to explain to my girls how important it is and<br/>
hopefully, they will want to learn it!  I know my 14 yo will want to because<br/>
she is so afraid that she is not learning what she is supposed to anyway!<br/>
It is my 10 yo that I will have to convince! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard stats that women who study math all the way through calculus, make <br/>
as much money as men, whereas women on average still make about 70 cents on <br/>
the dollar compared to men&#39;s salaries.<br/>

i think a lot of this depends on the parent at home and their style.  i, as <br/>
the parent managing the home, need to set some rules for my sanity and <br/>
happiness.  i dont pretend that i am not controlling the situation, i am <br/>
choosing to set limits in these areas bc when i havent things go from bad to <br/>
worse -- for me!  meaning, i get discouraged or down when things are too <br/>
chaotic.  and my kids get cranky.  everyone has to quiet down around here <br/>
pretty early, and rise not too late.  i have discovered that this is <br/>
something i prefer for our family, bc everybody needs to do their part to <br/>
keep things rolling.  (we need this one to empty the dw, another needs to <br/>
move their laundry, etc.)  everyone does have space of their own, tho, so as <br/>
they get older i have had  no problem with extending bedtime when their <br/>
daytime behavior doesnt suffer because of it...  it is more of an agreement wi<br/>
th the older ones what is reasonable for bedtime.  for computer time i ask <br/>
them for a balance.  i dont do well with oversaturation of any one thing, so <br/>
if they are reasonable about it, they are free to do it...   i am sure it is <br/>
partly due to our growing family (7 in our house now) that we need these <br/>
certain relied upon things...  there are many things outside of our control!  <br/>
(baby or toddler or preschooler needs...)<br/>

&lt;&lt; LETTING GO of math...I doubt that they are ever <br/>

etc.)so, what happens if they want to take an SAT test later &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
i think you started to hit it on the head at the end of your post, really we <br/>
each have to look at what we want for our childrens education experience.  if <br/>
it is important to us, or to our children, to take the SAT, then we should <br/>
incorporate preparation for that at some point.  i think it is a matter of <br/>
philosophy about why we are homeschooling, which is individual for each of <br/>
us.  if we want freedom for the children to NOT be coerced, then there are <br/>
ways to find out that they are learning mathmatical concepts in everyday <br/>
life.  or allowing them to see for themselves that they want to have this <br/>
knowledge as they go thru life, or in order to get some particular place (and <br/>
then they decide to put themselves thru the paces.)  otoh, if we want to <br/>
direct their learning more, and are not comfortable waiting, we may require <br/>
some math be done.  to me, it is in the way we see our families homeschooling <br/>
philosophy that would answer that question...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am the same way. As much as I love the time I spend with my <br/>
children, I also need those few hours alone in the evening. DH works <br/>
nights and I enjoy the time to myself, I wouldn&#39;t get it otherwise. <br/>
When I was working I also needed time to come home and just veg for a <br/>
few hours and unwind from the day. With 3 under the age of 6 and one <br/>
on the way it is important for me to get some adult interaction even <br/>
if it is watching something on t.v. that is more my age level. Blues <br/>
Clues 5X a day can drive a person insane. Also, the 3 and 5 yo love <br/>
to play games and it is difficult with the 17mo running about trying <br/>
to include himself in his own way. I have started putting him to bed <br/>
around 7-7:30. That way I can play some games with the 3 and 5yo just <br/>
before bedtime. We will either read or play Boggle, Jr., Memory, <br/>
Alphabet Bingo, Shutes and Ladders or they can watch a short video. <br/>
We have some that are animated bible stories and only 30 min. They <br/>
are great for a calm evening before bed time. Then around 8-8:30, <br/>
depending on when the baby went to sleep and how long he has actually <br/>
been asleep, they go to bed and I take turns snuggling with them <br/>
talking about their day, singing and just getting them settled in <br/>
their beds. Usually by about 9 they are calm enough to stay in bed <br/>
and fall asleep on their own and I can have a nice hot bubble bath <br/>
and read email or veg in front of the t.v. or read or whatever else I <br/>
decide to do. I do have a hard time when DH is off though. It tends <br/>
to mess up our schedule. His idea of putting the kids to bed is <br/>
sitting with them infront of the t.v. until they fall asleep. I don&#39;t <br/>
like this though because I have found that after a few weeks of this, <br/>
the kids either will stay up till all hours watching t.v. until I <br/>
finally come in and say it is time to get into bed (sometime this is <br/>
as late as midnight or 1 a.m.) or they just refuse to go to bed. <br/>
Either way it ends up interfering with the rest of the week&#39;s bedtime <br/>
schedule and DH doesn&#39;t seem to understand this. He just knows that <br/>
he wants to spend some time with the children. I guess part of the <br/>
problem is that he is the type that has to have the t.v. on to relax. <br/>
I on the other hand rarely have it on, except in the evening after <br/>
the kids are in bed. He is getting better about it though. I can come <br/>
in and say, &quot;Let&#39;s play a game. Do you want to join us, DH?&quot; and he <br/>
half the time he will turn off the t.v. and play the game with us at <br/>
bed time. It is a constant battle though. Do I give in and eventually <br/>
give up the few hours I have for myself or do I be a stick in the mud <br/>
about the bedtime routine 7 days a week. I have found that if I do <br/>
give up my few hours to myself it affects the way I interact and <br/>
respond to the children. Corallyn</div>
