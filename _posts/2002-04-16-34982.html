<div id="ygrps-yiv-237304717">&lt;&lt;&lt;As a *general* piece of advice creating a rich environment for unschooling<br/>
is a good one. *Usually* people ask how they can do that and then tell us<br/>
about their lives. And the advice can be tailored specifically to them (slow<br/>
down or get your head out of the curriculum catalog or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She never gave them the opportunity to think of things to do themselves.<br/>
&gt; She never allowed them to be bored and maybe think of something themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some have said it *sounded* like a few people here were doing that or were<br/>
advocating that, but I&#39;ve met both Sandra and Pam (and I&#39;ve met me too of<br/>
course!, but can&#39;t vouch for anyone else) and what I saw at Sandra&#39;s and<br/>
heard/saw with Pam was kids pursuing their own interests with plenty of<br/>
downtime, thinking loads of original thoughts, being offered opportunities<br/>
and taking them up or turning them down depending on whether it interested<br/>
them. The kids were all leading active lives even though my presence had<br/>
stolen the supposed cruise director away from them. And my family is like<br/>
that too, just with less action involved ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So where is the argument?<br/>

Been having a FABULOUS time with the one, the only, zenmomma, life is good Mary while she is staying with us at our house for a few days. I&#39;m having so much fun that this list has taken a back seat to *more important matters* currently going on.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s been plenty of kids pursuing their own interests, her kids sharing interests with my kids and vice versa, adults sharing opportunities with kids, kids coercing adults into playing games (kidding! ;-), and lots of general interaction between adults and kids. <br/>
<br/>
Not much more to comment on, but I just wanted to share my happiness! I&#39;ll be sad when Mary and her kids leave but I think Sandra will be happy! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Life is Excellent! :o)<br/>
