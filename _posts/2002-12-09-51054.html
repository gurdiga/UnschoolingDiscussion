<br/>
Could you check the URL you sent and send it again, please? I wanted to check the link you posted but it was &quot;NOT FOUND&quot; on the server. Could you please check if it&#39;s the right address?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hi I have been *lurking* for about 3 weeks reading posts. I started<br/>
&gt; out homeschooling 2 years ago but we now Unschool.  I live in<br/>
&gt; Missouri. I use a daily log that can be found at:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; its very simple to use for me. All MO seems to care about is that<br/>
&gt; one, the child/children are in attendence, two, they are being<br/>
&gt; *taught* the 5 required subjects, those 5 must be *taught* in 600<br/>
&gt; hours per year, 400 of those 600 must be in the home, and additional<br/>
&gt; 400 hours must be in non-core subjects per year, total 1000 hours.  I<br/>
&gt; have 2 children  12 and 10 I keep one daily log per child per week.<br/>
&gt; Children learn from the time they wake up in the mornings til they go<br/>
&gt; to bed at night. My daily log shows an *hour* in each core subject<br/>
&gt; per day. 1 to 2-1/2 hours per day non-core.  If my son, 12 reads the<br/>
&gt; directions to a new game cube game, thats reading. If he figures out<br/>
&gt; how much that game is going to cost to buy/rent, thats math. If he<br/>
&gt; helps me make cookies and we have to reduce the amounts used, thats<br/>
&gt; fractions. Making cookies is math. Reading the sales adds to me and<br/>
&gt; helping make a list is reading/writing. Watching the science channel<br/>
&gt; counts as science. He watched the history channel last night for 3<br/>
&gt; hours because he wanted to. His favorite subject, The Titanic was<br/>
&gt; being shown as they tried to lift a section of it. That counted as<br/>
&gt; science and social studies. He watched it until 11 p.m. school isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; out at our home at 3 p.m. its out when they go to bed. Every 2-3 days<br/>
&gt; I write down the hours in the log. I wrote a Plan of Education for<br/>
&gt; each child and have that in a folder I keep the daily log in.  I also<br/>
&gt; keep a copy of our states law requirements in it. The only thing that<br/>
&gt; we must show if ever questioned is the daily log, and the only person<br/>
&gt; that can request that is the Prosecuting attorney.  e-mail me at,<br/>

<br/>
I Write in Reading, math, science, social studies, language arts, and <br/>
I make 30 copies at a time of it. Thats 15 weeks for 2 children. Then <br/>
I write in the child name and the dates of that week on one and mark <br/>
the hours in each subject.  Total the hours for that week carry them <br/>
over to next weeks. Simple. ~&gt;Chloe</div>

 </span></blockquote>I meant to go on here.<br/>
I live in a portfolio state, one that loves to ask for &quot;extras&quot;. Fortunately, <br/>
we also have the option of an &quot;umbrella&quot; school. I found one that is very <br/>
unschooling friendly and requires NO paper work, just a checklist once a <br/>
year.<br/>
I tried going through the county school system portfolio reviews but found <br/>
that it was very stressful to try to &quot;speak their language&quot; and a huge <br/>
hinderance to unschooling succesfully. I think the ways that schools teacha <br/>
nd compartmentalize and label, to be so false and out of life&#39;s context. I <br/>
couldn&#39;t try to pretend to work within a system that is so wrong for us.<br/>
When we move to our new state witch has very similar laws, I don&#39;t intend on <br/>
registering my children with the state at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255884428">Silly isn&#39;t it!  LOL.    Our state seems more interested in <br/>
homeschoolers meeting the required 1000 hours total (600 core, 400 <br/>
non-core)in the 5 required subjects, then if children are actually <br/>
learning.  As for days of absents, as we were ahead in hours *on <br/>
paper* anyway, so we just took a week off for Thanksgiving and am <br/>
taking a grand 2 weeks off for Christmas, *on paper*, LOL.  We must <br/>
keep the records straight!!  :)   Another thing about absents.  Since <br/>
my children have been out of ps, they have been Very Healthy! They <br/>
are not catching every cold, virus that other children in ps are <br/>
spreading around. ~&gt;Chloe<br/>
