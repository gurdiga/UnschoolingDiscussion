Oh how I wish I could impress this on my husband.  I think I will go ahead<br/>
and do this while he is at work one day - he won&#39;t dare disturb my garden,<br/>
he knows better &lt;vbg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ammo!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774873177">I read a hilarious spoof on a discussion between God and a couple of<br/>
saints up in heaven about how we have worked so hard to rid our space of<br/>
native plants and then all the work we go to keeping grass alive - and<br/>
then keep mowing it down!<br/>

We have a really nice big front lawn that the kids love.  We found out how <br/>
much<br/>
they love it when we had to dig half of it up to redo our leach line!  They <br/>
keep telling us how much they miss their grass.  Several years ago we had a <br/>
big fire in our hills and burned up a lot of food for the critters.  The <br/>
critters moved down the hill to our lush front lawn and now every year, from <br/>
October to March the rabbits mostly, eat it down to the bare ground, with a <br/>
few sprigs of grass in between LOL.  Its nice not having to mow and I guess <br/>
they do fertilize....While I don&#39;t mind them eating my grass, what really <br/>
bums me out is that they will (along with the squirrels) eat any and all <br/>
flowers and even some hardy ground cover.  Guess that is why I am feeling <br/>
intimidated starting a garden, because I will have to do some serious work to <br/>
keep the critters from eating our food!<br/>
