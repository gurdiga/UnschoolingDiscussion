&gt; must be that person&#39;s intention to shock, is faulty reasoning and a reason<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; to justify judgment and &quot;attitude&quot; against the person- and in this case<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; distain for the human body and its natural functions. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re saying nobody intends to shock?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No - I am saying &quot;Assuming that because you are shocked (or alot of people<br/>
are shocked), it must be that person&#39;s intention to shock, is faulty<br/>
reasoning&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine myself nursing my child, relaxed about it because maybe I feel<br/>
comfortable around the people I know- that this is my &quot;place&quot; and town, and<br/>
having the wife of my x-boyfriend come up to me and say that I should move<br/>
over there in that dark corner away from everyone- a response of, &quot;shoot!<br/>
you nursed your kids too&quot;  hardly constitutes proof of antagonistic<br/>
intentions to shock old country folks not accustomed to nursing.<br/>
<br/>
If a person feels a defensive desire to &quot;shock people&quot; with breast feeding,<br/>
it is because they are aware of the intense contradiction between our<br/>
culture and what is normal for human beings - and haven&#39;t worked through to<br/>
a positive way of expressing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There are people here saying they know people who have purposefully been<br/>
&gt; antagonistic about such things<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not disdain or attitude when it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So if the person is &quot;purposefully&quot; being shocking, then we can think their<br/>
body is gross, and be justified in having an attitude against them?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;If a person responds defensively to a &quot;helpful comment&quot; (to find an<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;appropriate&quot; place to nurse, or &quot;this is Kinko&#39;s, a place of business,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; children should not be loud&quot;, or anything like that ) it is because they<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; felt attacked.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people like to feel martyrly or put upon.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; By your summary judgment, it&#39;s impossible to suggest anything to anyone<br/>
&gt; without attacking, or at least if they FEEL attacked, it&#39;s.... what?  Not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; fault that they feel attacked?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am saying that to give an adult a &quot;helpful comment&quot; about such things like<br/>
nursing in public, loud children, etc  - um...lets just say- I can not<br/>
imagine<br/>
what that comment would sound and look like to be truly &quot;helpful&quot;- we all<br/>
live in the same society, assuming that you have some information that they<br/>
don&#39;t about common attitudes and then giving it to them is condescending and<br/>
shows faulty boundaries.<br/>
<br/>
Having only jurisdiction over one&#39;s own self and feelings, the only possible<br/>
&quot;helpful statement&quot; I can think of is &quot;*I* feel uncomfortable with you<br/>
nursing in this spot and would feel more comfortable if you moved&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which of course, sounds like maybe *I* have distain for the human body,<br/>
which as my quoted posts suggests- it is because of our imprinting and<br/>
biases.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, if someone feels uncomfortable with any aspect of the human<br/>
body and its functions- they should not blame the person showing the boob-<br/>
even if they ran into the middle of the room and tore off their shirt<br/>
screaming &quot;LOOK at my Lactating BOobS!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They should take it as an opportunity to be relived of yet another stifling,<br/>
revolting, puritan attitude and rejoice in the gift!<br/>

So some mothers, the kind that &quot;like to disturb&quot;, use the breastfeeding<br/>
relationship and their child primarily to gain attention?  This is a pretty<br/>
harsh judgment (horrible imo, and why I am writing these posts).<br/>
<br/>
Breastfeeding is about the child- it involves breasts nipples mouths skin<br/>
hands bodies.  Do you think for one second that a child would prefer a fully<br/>
clothed covered up mother, only the nipple out- himself to be fully clothed,<br/>
diapered, nike shoes and all- to an entirely naked mother and baby?<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t a baby prefer to cuddle and pet the other breast, the mom&#39;s<br/>
stomach, her face, her skin?  The concession is already so much- the<br/>
experience is already sacrificed for both the mother and child in public<br/>
(and for many women, in private too).<br/>
<br/>
If we asked the babies, would they want discretion? Would they want their<br/>
teddy bear instead?  no one seems to complain when a kid wants his pacifier<br/>
and teddy.  Why are breasts uglier than silky blankets and strollers?<br/>
Breastfeeding shouldn&#39;t have the power to shock- any more than bottles do-<br/>
if a mother gets negative attention for nursing- she shouldn&#39;t.  How about<br/>
we leave breastfeeding alone, and if we want to figure out if someone is<br/>
trying to &quot;disturb others&quot;, pick something else.<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
&lt;&lt;So if the person is &quot;purposefully&quot; being shocking, then we can think their<br/>
body is gross, and be justified in having an attitude against them?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

short or long time after that.<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
I use the word &quot;justifiable&quot; as meaning a true reason- as in &quot;justice&quot;.  All<br/>
people have good and understandable reasons for doing and thinking<br/>
everything (my belief).  But not all reasons are &quot;justifible&quot;-<br/>
<br/>
By your argument, if the person who cut us off in traffic where of a certain<br/>
race- we<br/>
would be justified in being less tolerant of that race for a &quot;short or<br/>
long time&quot;. While it is understandable, it is not justifiable.  And we can<br/>
use our feelings in situations like this to grow as people.<br/>
<br/>
If we feel offended in any way by breastfeeding, we can use it to grow in<br/>
our understanding- till we are not offended.<br/>

<br/>
What if (as happened to me) the organizer of an event has asked you to speak<br/>

<br/>
ME:<br/>
If someone asked me to go tell a breastfeeding woman to move- the first<br/>
thing I would do is feel a pain in my heart that I was face to face with a<br/>
negative attitude about breastfeeding.  I would express this, and ask who<br/>
complained.  I would then go to talk to that person (maybe it was the person<br/>
who came to me) to try to smooth things out, maybe give some information<br/>
about breastfeeding while also listening to their understandably negative<br/>
feelings.  I would then make it a point to go and show support to the woman,<br/>
maybe sit by her, talk to her.  I would do this because I was asked to get<br/>
involved.  I would be greatful for the opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
This would be the same if I were the manager of Kinko&#39;s etc..and people felt<br/>
I had responsibility for fixing their problems, and complained to me about a<br/>
nursing mother.  Except if I was the manager of kinkos- I might be prompted<br/>
to put up a sign on the front that said, &quot;nursing mothers welcome&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
SANDRA:<br/>
There ARE realities and sometimes there are honest and real reasons to try<br/>
to persuade people to act differently in a particular time or place.<br/>
<br/>
ME:<br/>
Right.  For me, however, there is never a situation where I would want to go<br/>
against what I think is right to appease someone&#39;s sensibilities.  I would<br/>
never<br/>
tell a woman to stop or move while breastfeeding because someone asked me<br/>
to, even if I was &quot;boss&quot;- even if she was flashing alot of skin- and even if<br/>
she MEANT to.<br/>
<br/>
Of all babies six months old- only 6% are nursing in this country- that is<br/>
quite a minority.<br/>
<br/>
Let us support them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can avoid trying to figure out if a mom is trying to &quot;get<br/>
attention&quot; with nursing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we can enjoy the fact that when you see a mother and child nursing you<br/>
are whitness to a very special, important, and short time in a child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
that is all I want to say,<br/>
