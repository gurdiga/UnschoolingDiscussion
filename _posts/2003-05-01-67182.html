<div id="ygrps-yiv-892833790">If it weren&#39;t for a bicycle helmet, my son would not have a father right now. <br/>
A bit over a year ago he had a very bad accident. The helmet was very <br/>
damaged, and Perry came out of it with a very badly broken collar bone that <br/>
kept him off of work (he&#39;s a nurse) for a month. But there was no doubt with <br/>
the way he fell that he would have been dead or very disabled without the <br/>
helmet, according to the doctor.<br/>
