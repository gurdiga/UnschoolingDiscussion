<br/>
There&#39;s a new game advertised from GameHouse.  I have several of  <br/>
their games.  They&#39;re great with customer service and all that.<br/>
<br/>
The new game is not for a Mac and Holly&#39;s too old, but if she were  <br/>
younger, I would get this in a heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Magic Farm<br/>
Grow and sell magical plants in this colorful adventure that&#39;s full  <br/>
of fast fun. Help Iris earn enough money to search for her beloved  <br/>
parents by growing and selling a wide variety of enchanted flowers  <br/>
and charmed bouquets. A captivating journey through a wonderful land  <br/>
of fairies, foes, and helpful little dragons, Magic Farm is blooming  <br/>
with family fun.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds kinda like Harvest Moon, but less expensive.  Maybe less  <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone with younger kids seen it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269203559">There something called Alice Greenfingers that works on Mac and is ok after<br/>
a fashion but it doesn&#39;t do much.  I bet I&#39;d like Magic Farm from the<br/>
description.  Thanks for the link.<br/>
