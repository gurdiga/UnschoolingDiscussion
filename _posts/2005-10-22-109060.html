It doesn&#39;t take until their teenagers to start having problems in <br/>
school.  My dd was bored and started acting up in 2nd grade, but my dh <br/>
wasn&#39;t ready for HS until 4th grade.  One day she came home crying <br/>
about the girls being mean, school boring and she was so negative that <br/>
he finally saw what school was doing to his little girl.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your dh will get the message earlier than mine did.  He is on <br/>
board with us unschooling, doesn&#39;t understand the whole concept yet <br/>
but he she&#39;s that she is much happier.  The stress in our house has <br/>
almost diminished.<br/>
<br/>
When we decided to bring her home 2 years ago I stopped a 20 yr career <br/>
as an RN and haven&#39;t looked back.  I haven&#39;t found anything I want to <br/>
do at home as a business yet, but still open.<br/>
<br/>
Read as many books on unschooling as you can.  I just shared with my <br/>
dh, who isn&#39;t a reader, what I was reading and he never said no, so I <br/>
just keep on unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-934083858">Thanks Kay, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry about your daughter and the girls being mean - i&#39;m <br/>
seeing that now and i know some of it is the alignment stuff you read <br/>
is part of the age, but how sad is that? and what is it about <br/>
throwing them all together in that setting that brings it out more <br/>
than with kids they see at home?  i can tell by what my daughter <br/>
tells me that she participates in it and we have long talks about <br/>
kindness. <br/>
<br/>
One thing i&#39;m seeing with my daughters is that they&#39;re really liking <br/>
school - they almost always look forward to it and i&#39;m trying to <br/>
picture how it will be not sending them back, if we do that. they <br/>
adjusted really well to going after a long term of major separation <br/>
anxiety, so i have some concerns about how it would all play out.<br/>
I guess, i trust them and follow their lead - maybe i&#39;m concerned <br/>
they&#39;ll want to stay!  Any advice on letting children make choices <br/>
for themselves even if they conflict with your values - maybe they&#39;re <br/>
here to follow my husband&#39;s choices and learn what they will from <br/>
that experience?  Hard for me to accept that when i see a wonderful <br/>
future for them my way, but i don&#39;t want to be close-minded...  Carol<br/>

The same damage school does can be done at home if children don&#39;t have <br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
Even if going to school is their choice, things are better for them (and for <br/>
school).<br/>

This quote was on the link from Sandra:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have found that children who do not have freedom of choice, or have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>been controlled, become angry. Adults do not see this anger, but other<br/>
children often &gt;become targets because of it.   Vicky Bennison<br/>
 <br/>
I saw the anger the other night at a rock concert.  Our family and some<br/>
unschooling friends went to see a friend&#39;s rock band.  The band that<br/>
played before them was a nu-metal band (punk and metal combined) made up<br/>
of young high school kids.  They had a large following mostly young<br/>
teenage boys. Apparently, our friend&#39;s band was suppose to go on at 9:00<br/>
but one of the dad&#39;s from the nu-metal band called the show director and<br/>
insisted that they play at 9:00 because the boys needed to be home by<br/>
10:00 since it was a school night.  Thus, our friends band was pushed<br/>
back to 10:00. <br/>
 <br/>
When the nu-metal music started, the dance floor turned into a mosh pit<br/>
of young angry white boys.  Most of these boys are middle to upper<br/>
middle class California suburban high school students.  It was a little<br/>
scary to see the anger played out on the dance floor.  I actually took<br/>
my five year old daughter outside until they were done.   The mosh pit<br/>
consisted only of boys and no girls were allowed to participate.  I have<br/>
seen mosh pits before and I don&#39;t remember such anger and violent<br/>
behavior.  Either the pits have changed or maybe it is me that has<br/>
changed.  Anyway, I believe that it is a good thing that these boys have<br/>
a place to release their anger in a somewhat safe and probably very fun<br/>
and exciting environment but it is so unfortunate that they have so much<br/>
anger.  I have no doubt that this is a good example of children who do<br/>
not have freedom of choice and have been controlled most of their lives.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a 12 year old son who has had a lot of freedom since leaving<br/>
school 4 years ago and I truly do not see any of the anger that was<br/>
portrayed the other night in that mosh pit in my son.  He is such a<br/>
happy free young pre-teen with choices that he is not afraid to make.<br/>
In fact, he and his unschooled friends decided to step outside on the<br/>
patio during the nu-metal band and wait for the next band to come<br/>
on-stage.  Another moment to be thankful that I have found unschooling<br/>
and the freedom it has given our family.<br/>
