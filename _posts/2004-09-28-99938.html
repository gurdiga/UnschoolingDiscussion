&lt;&lt; Btw, Sandra, my son is nearly 18 and he has hair as long as Kirby&#39;s (we <br/>
were so surprised!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby cut his.  We don&#39;t have a newer family portrait.   Darn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;. . .and has finally found a place to play Magic every week. Last night, he <br/>
finally met some <br/>
<br/>
D&D friends through his new job at Starbucks. Your encouragement and example <br/>
were <br/>
<br/>
inspirational to me and eventually helpful to my son. Thanks for posting that <br/>
great piece <br/>
<br/>
about how Kirby&#39;s future looks to him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
I hope Kirby doesn&#39;t become a complete bum, or if he does I hope he&#39;s the <br/>
only one of all the unschoolers who does. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby goes to karate Mondays and Tuesdays these days.  Monday is an adult <br/>
class, long and arduous.   Tuesday he teaches a beginning class at 4:00, takes <br/>
the advanced kid-class at 5:00, and then is in an adult weapons class for two <br/>
hours (and it sometimes goes past 8:00).<br/>
<br/>
Last week he missed the Monday class to go out to dinner with friends.  While <br/>
he was gone, Keith told me he had said &quot;sick&quot; to BOTH nights the week before <br/>
(I had been in Chicago).   So Tuesday I asked him if he was going, and he said <br/>
yes, but he wasn&#39;t into it and wanted to take a break from it for a while.<br/>
<br/>
ME, the mom, invested in wanting to say &quot;my son has a black belt in karate&quot; <br/>
wanted to say something about that, but I kept quiet about it. (He has a brown <br/>
belt.)  I lightly reminded him of the cost, but acknolwedged it was his money <br/>
this time (tax return was put toward that).<br/>
<br/>
He said he was going to talk to his sensei and not stay for the later classes <br/>
after he taught.  I talked to Keith (his dad) about it and said I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to press him because then it would be about me, and if he went he would feel <br/>
he had lost a battle of wills with me.  Keith totally agreed.  I was wishing I <br/>
had said even less than I had.<br/>
<br/>
We had a singing practice here and I didn&#39;t think about him for hours.<br/>
<br/>
He came bounding up the stairs about 9:00, all energized, and said he had de<br/>
cided NOT to quit.   He had stayed until the extra-long weapons session had <br/>
ended.   I asked whether it was just that he had a good time.  He said, &quot;There <br/>
were about 12 of my students there, and I saw them, and I just...&quot;  and he acted <br/>
out going all soft and mushy.<br/>
<br/>
So he was unwilling to abandon his fan club, basically.   Those younger kids <br/>
really like him, and he remembers being young there and going in large part <br/>
just because of older kids who ran the drills.   All of those three he used to <br/>
love to impress and hang out with quit the dojo for high school considerations <br/>
(sports or academics) before they were 18 (one at 17, two at 15).  He was sad <br/>
every time.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday he made other plans instead of the adult class.  <br/>
Today he&#39;s definitely planning to go for the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
Without working out in a more spread-out fashion (for years he went Tuesdays <br/>
and Thursdays), that is a very long four hours.  But he knows that.<br/>
<br/>
If I had nagged and shamed him, he couldn&#39;t have joyfully decided to keep <br/>
going.  And he probably will NOT go forever.  But I want him to go because he <br/>
wants to and quit when he wants to, without being a factor if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday he ditched work.  He called in sick (which he only slightly was) and <br/>
then went to hang around with friends.  I squawked a little about it when he <br/>
told us what the deal was. Sunday is NOT his regular work day, though, and he <br/>
was in as backup on the regular Sunday guy so it wasn&#39;t a very big deal.  It was <br/>
small, but he got a call and they needed something, so I had to be honest <br/>
that he wasn&#39;t home, and I did track him down and he called them within five <br/>
minutes, and he wasn&#39;t in trouble.   But I was cranky/bitchy-mom when I had called <br/>
him, and later when he was home I apologized.  I told him that when I was his <br/>
age I was ditching classes to hang around with friends and I totally <br/>
understood how he felt.<br/>
<br/>
What I thought and didn&#39;t say was that when I was his age I was doing MUCH <br/>
worse and more dangerous things and was in places where my mom couldn&#39;t possibly <br/>
have tracked me down, and when I did have a job it was some pissant little <br/>
on-campus student job.<br/>
<br/>
None of that was said.  But I knew inside me that he has now ditched work <br/>
ONCE (one time, count it) in four years and two months of holding the same job, a <br/>
real job with keys and security system and cash register.  Not dipping oat <br/>
meal in the cafeteria or filing cardfor the bursar.  Not just ONCE saying<br/>
Z &quot;sick&quot; about teaching a karate class he&#39;s not paid for teaching.<br/>
<br/>
His life is more real than mine. He&#39;s more responsible than I was.  <br/>
<br/>
Still, the momly urge is for me to rattle on about responsibility and <br/>
what-ifs, and I feel good when I can control that urge.<br/>

I know I sometimes feel pressure (especially with the oldest) to tell people how &quot;well&quot; my <br/>
son is turning out as some kind of validation for our choices. What cracks me up is that <br/>
kids who drop out of high school or decide not to go to college after public school are just <br/>
considered &quot;not motivated.&quot; No one questions the kind of schooling that may have led to <br/>
those choices.<br/>

<br/>
Now there is a catch phrase to use as a measurement *before* we open our mouths!<br/>
<br/>
What have I had an investment in wanting to say about my kids?<br/>
<br/>
College always figured prominently as the key to &quot;proving&quot; that homeschooling/<br/>
unschooling worked.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to let that go with the first child for the time being.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is how I see it. Some people say that parental pressure often helps kids with flagging <br/>
interest to continue past their inertia to succeed.<br/>
<br/>
But what I realized is that when we exert pressure, we are doing a couple things I don&#39;t <br/>
want to do:<br/>
<br/>
1. I am telling my child that he doesn&#39;t have what it takes to commit on his own - he is <br/>
dependent on *outside* pressure and expectations, not on his own resolve and initiative.<br/>
<br/>
2. I am telling my child that his choices don&#39;t impact his life. I am saying that my ideas of <br/>
how he ought to live will override his laziness or boredom or loss of interest. This <br/>
reinforces the idea that his choices aren&#39;t real - aren&#39;t his responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
   But I was cranky/bitchy-mom when I had called <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; him, and later when he was home I apologized.  I told him that when I was his <br/>
&gt; age I was ditching classes to hang around with friends and I totally <br/>
&gt; understood how he felt.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had something similar happen with a small car accident. I was really annoyed that he <br/>
back-ended a car five minutes from home. It was expensive and inconvenient for me. But I <br/>
had to stop short. I had been in five car accidents by age 20 and never paid a penny for <br/>
the repairs. This is a kid who handled the situation beautifully before I got there and is <br/>
working to repay us.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; His life is more real than mine. He&#39;s more responsible than I was. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love how you put this. I agree on our end too. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband threw that out in regard to CPS the other day (speaking <br/>
of which, whatever happened with Julie in MO?)  He was speculating <br/>
on how they could use the fact that we have a homeschooled eighteen <br/>
year old here with no tangible &quot;five-year plan&quot; for the future.  <br/>
She&#39;s never been in the System, so it hasn&#39;t been an influence on <br/>
her as it was for our oldest son.  I reminded DH that we can&#39;t live <br/>
our life in fear of not meeting others&#39; arbitrary standards and he <br/>
agreed, but Nike also worries about what the neighbors will think of <br/>
us, and that just adds to the pressure she&#39;s already putting on <br/>
herself.  <br/>
<br/>
Nicole has so many interests, but doesn&#39;t want to commit to a paying <br/>
job (or several) and end up not sticking to it like her big <br/>
brother.  I told her that one of my most interesting jobs after <br/>
college was a stint as a temporary Kelly Girl.  I loved meeting new <br/>
people and doing different things each week, although I really <br/>
aspired to be on Broadway and had no idea how to go about it (I&#39;d <br/>
been informed in college that I didn&#39;t have what it takes.) <br/>
<br/>
My DD doesn&#39;t want to be stuck indoors all day, but none of the <br/>
volunteer opportunities around here appeal to her, either.  Nike did <br/>
get excited about art school in Canada, but now she&#39;s having second <br/>
thoughts about that.  It&#39;s very frustrating for her, especially now <br/>
that she&#39;s eighteen (and a half,) but I told her that when it gets <br/>
to that point -- there&#39;s usually some sort of big <br/>
breakthrough &#39;round the corner.  Just when you think the pregnancy <br/>
has gotten ridiculously laborious, the baby arrives (mommie <br/>
metaphors &#39;r&#39; us -- nine kids&#39;ll do that to ya&#39; :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry &#39;bout that, I should have clarified that she has seven younger <br/>
siblings here at home... and we already know from personal <br/>
experience just how fast & furious CPS can swoop down on an innocent <br/>
family.  These folks are known to twist everything around to suit <br/>
their purpo$e -- left a couple of links to MassOutrage and AFRA in <br/>
our previous posts, for those who missed it.  <br/>
<br/>
The saddest part about our close encounter with this agency is that <br/>
I could hardly wait for each & every one of them to be legally free <br/>
from the vulture called Big Brother.  Two down, seven to go... but <br/>
then the terrorists started a war and the powers that be started <br/>
talking about reinstating the draft. Catch 22!  If it weren&#39;t for my <br/>
faith in Christian Science, I would probably be an absolute basket <br/>
case, but it has provided a haven of hope amidst the seeming despair.<br/>
<br/>
I know we&#39;ll be alright -- it&#39;s the old doubts that creep up on us <br/>
unexpectedly, especially when we round another corner of family <br/>
life, that we have to constantly keep in check for everyone&#39;s peace <br/>
of mind.<br/>

influences, only be 17 of 18, homesick, hating his classes and wishing like crazy he <br/>
could be home, but he&#39;ll keep most of that to himself for the sake of bucking <br/>
up, and the parents will maintain their bragging rights.<br/>
<br/>
I went to college with lots of kids like that.   I was young 17 when I went <br/>
(July 24 birthday, and turned the summer before I was a sophomore).  There were <br/>
kids there who were 19, 20, homesick for families 2000 miles away.  So they <br/>
just played their music louder and drank and used drugs and acted smart (and <br/>
stupid).<br/>
