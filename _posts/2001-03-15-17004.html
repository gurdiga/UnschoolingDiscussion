<div id="ygrps-yiv-1879593494"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Tahoma">Hello to everyone on the list,
<br>
<br>I also have been a lurker, starting homeschooling along with my daycare
<br>business has kept me busy. &nbsp;
<br>My name is Linda S. and we live in ND.
<br>I am finding the information, and tips, wonderful information!
<br>I recently took time off a list I had been a member on for the past
<br>4 years, (not a list for homeschooling) to join this one, and its been
<br>refreshing.
<br>
<br>I am interested in touching base with any of you who&#39;s child/children did
<br>attend public school, and than to HS, or also children that had learning
<br>difficulties in Public School.
<br>
<br>Today I had a telephone conference with the school to finalize my son&#39;s
<br>transition from school to homeschool. I was asked in the begining of this
<br>meeting if I would consider sending my 11 year old son back to school,
<br>or send him 1/2 a day. 
<br> 
<br>This drove me nuts, as I took on homeschooling my son with full 
<br>responsibility,
<br>not on a whim........
<br>Bottom line here is that I am so tired of the school, and the damage that
<br>they are capable of. The anxiety it produces, makes me work even harder
<br>and strengthens me belief&#39;s that I have made the right choice.
<br>
<br>Linda S.
<br>Please inform me if there are any other Linda&#39;s on the list. So there won&#39;t
<br>be any confusion.

Welcome to the list<br/>
I am Marianne from New Zealand.  I removed my youngest from school <br/>
when sh was 11yrs old too.  That is almost a year ago now.  She had <br/>
always disliked school - at 11yrs old she became deppressed and <br/>
refused to go - I learned that she had been bullied, which was the <br/>
last straw for her.<br/>
<br/>
We soon went from home school to unschool - She is a totally <br/>
different person, so happy and confident.   We arent doing much in <br/>
the learning department, which still wories me a little, but we are <br/>
slowly geting there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616645135">Welcome Linda! I have a similar experience to<br/>
Marianne. I pulled my son out lasy year with 3 weeks<br/>
left to 1st grade. I couldn&#39;t take another day! We<br/>
started school at the table, moved quickly to unschool<br/>
and what a difference! This kid is finally learning to<br/>
relax. He is reading more, playing more video games,<br/>
and way happier than I&#39;ve seen him since he was a tot.<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful for unschooling.com, because I<br/>
stumbled on the site and it changed our lives. Well,<br/>
we actually did the changing:)<br/>
The principal used to call atleast once a week to<br/>
report silly little things. Sometimes, it would be to<br/>
tell me that Jay was angry that day. Poor kid used to<br/>
come off the bus with fear in his eyes, knowing the<br/>
principal had called me. I hated that, and it took a<br/>
while for me to get the balls to tell the principal to<br/>
get a life, but I&#39;m so glad I did. The teachers always<br/>
said Jay couldn&#39;t sit still. Well, neither can I. So,<br/>
we dont have to anymore!<br/>
We&#39;re free! Any our whole family has benefited so much<br/>
from this experience. We are all happier.<br/>
Good luck to you, if you ever need answers, you&#39;re<br/>
sure to find a few good ones here.<br/>

has chosen to&nbsp;be in public school. I just had to deal with the principal 
because my 14 year old son had an elastic in his posession.&nbsp;A teacher took 
it away and when he asked why he got in trouble and was assigned to write 100 
sentences. I has a meeting with the principal and he dug his heels in and 
insisted my son must do the sentences or be suspended from school! There is no 
rule that children ar enot allowed elastics and&nbsp;just because some other 
kids had&nbsp;caused trouble earlier in the week, my son was&nbsp;punished. 
Ridiculous. My son is seriously reconsidering his decision.</font></div>

I can remember when Jay was in kindergarten he was<br/>
kept in gor recess because he wore a bandana on his<br/>
head that day. Only girls were allowed to wear them<br/>
and the principal actually had the nerve to say that I<br/>
was encouraging gang-like behavior for letting him<br/>
wear it to school. Keep in mind Jay was 5 and we live<br/>
in a very small town.<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We took our children out in first, fifth and 
seventh.The oldest two are my husband&#39;s from a previous marriage but we have had 
custody since&nbsp;1993. The school system in the city we lived in were easy to 
work with. We had problems with DSS instead. Also be wary of nosy neighbors. In 
some states people can make anonymous calls and you have the burden of proving 
them wrong. We had a therapist call DSS over something that had happened in 
their mothers house before we got custody but we still had to go through an 
investigation that took three months. Both our older children are labeled 
&quot;learning disabled&quot; by the public system. The older child they just modified her 
program by reading everything to her and assigning half of whatever her class 
did. The result was when we started homeschooling  she had a first grade reading 
level! Extremely humiliating for a teenager. She has improved but is still a 
reluctant&nbsp;reader. I try to encourage her to read anything that interests 
her. I hope you continue to seek what is best for your child. Remember the 
public school interest is the &quot;public good&quot;, not your childs. </font></div>
