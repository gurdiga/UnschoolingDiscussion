<div id="ygrps-yiv-46825733">Right now we are enrolled in a cyber charter. It takes my kids about <br/>
an hour per day to do school. Some days we don&#39;t do school at all if <br/>
we are busy with other things, some days it takes a little longer.<br/>
<br/>
Was wondering if someone could adopt an unschooling lifestyle in <br/>
addition to continuing to do the carters requirements. It leaves 23 <br/>
hours in a day for more natural learning. <br/>
<br/>
Was also wondering how one would do high school transcripts for <br/>
college admission as an unschooler? <br/>
<br/>
Also, would like to know if any of you have grown kids that are in <br/>
successful careers (with or without college.) Do they regret <br/>
unschooling or are they happy with that choice? Are there any gaps <br/>
in their education? (I think there are many gaps in mine, a public <br/>
school education). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I ordered two John Holt books from my local library, and I should <br/>
get them in a few weeks (They were checked out) Been reading <br/>
Sandra&#39;s website, and thinking... <br/>
<br/>
I kind of think it sounds good, but am hesitant for these higher <br/>
grades. They seem to be fine even though we did no schoolwork for a <br/>
few years. Not sure what I would report to the state (in PA, <br/>
portfolios with work samples required), and not sure how I would <br/>
explain it to others. Also worried that when they grow up they will <br/>
hate me for it. <br/>
