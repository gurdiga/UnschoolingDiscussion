<div id="ygrps-yiv-244767406">Dylan and I got up at the stroke of early this morning to go bird<br/>
watching.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a wildlife management area (how did they manage themselves before<br/>
we took over?) south of us about twenty miles or so.  There are several<br/>
big interconnected ponds.<br/>
<br/>
We went to a place called &quot;the rookery&quot;.   It should be called &quot;the<br/>
herony&quot; because it&#39;s Great Blue Herons roost there in the cotton wood<br/>
trees, not ravens.    Anyway, if you get there early you can see the<br/>
Herons on the roost.  It&#39;s quite a site, twenty or so tall birds perched<br/>
in trees.<br/>
<br/>
There were two Bald Eagle nests, and we saw a chick in one.  One adult<br/>
Eagle made noises at us and we questioned the wisdom of walking under<br/>
that tree, but she stayed on her perch and we kept our hair.<br/>
<br/>
Canadian geese, my favorite birds, but apparently not the brightest, were<br/>
nesting about twenty yard from the Eagles nests.   Something hurts inside<br/>
when I think of soft little goslings as breakfast.  Eagles are more<br/>
practical I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
There were yellow headed black birds by the hundreds and they would<br/>
squawk at us, flutter a few feet in front of us in the cat tails and<br/>
squawk some more.   We tried to be stealthy but happy eleven year olds<br/>
can only sneak for short periods of time.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We saw so many birds, walked for miles, got chewed up by mosquitos sat in<br/>
the grass and drank our hot chocolate and talked.    <br/>
<br/>
Dylan has a great memory for birds.   He is able to identify several<br/>
types of ducks and grebes.  He knows Spotted sandpipers.   He knows all<br/>
the birds that come to our feeders and has for a few years, but I was<br/>
impressed today with how many of the water birds and shorebirds he knew. <br/>
 And he knows them just matter of factly, as if everyone knows.  It&#39;s<br/>
just another part of his ordinary life.  When I was his age any bird that<br/>
swam was a duck and everything else was a sparrow or a robin. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We saw an Osprey fishing, diving into the water and then shaking his<br/>
feathers dry as he flew over us with a fish.   <br/>
<br/>
It was a great morning.   This afternoon I&#39;ve been bombarded with<br/>
questions about World War two.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744575813">Deb, how COOL! I love bird watching, and am blessed to live in a <br/>
riparian area, within a few miles of water bird habitat.<br/>
<br/>
As for the management of wildlife, before &quot;we took over&quot;, &quot;we&quot; had no <br/>
laws governing hunting. There were no seasons, and people could take <br/>
down whatever animals, however many, no matter if they had a fawn in <br/>
the thicket, no matter if it were nesting season (nests were open <br/>
game, as well)...&quot;we took over&quot; and have had to apply external <br/>
controls, becuase &quot;we&quot; have proven ourselves incapable of harvesting <br/>
reasonably in the wild. <br/>
<br/>
There even had to be a moratorium on fishing for cod on the east <br/>
coast, a fish that produces literally billions of spawn every year, <br/>
because &quot;we&quot; were wiping them out with our floating fish factories. :(<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for wildlife management.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a great post, Deb.IT sounds like a great place to be. My son Tommy also <br/>
loves birds, and for a long time as a four year old(now he&#39;s 7) his favorite <br/>
book was our bird book. Last year we had a Merlin nest in our yard, and we <br/>
regularly see pileated, downy and hairy wood peckers on our property. Down at <br/>
 the river down the road from us, we see kingfishers in the summer, and the <br/>
Canada geese fly over us spring and fall. <br/>
Sounds like you had a great unschooling day, I thinkyou have inspired me to <br/>
dig out the bird book and go looking again.<br/>
