<div id="ygrps-yiv-541087424">&lt;&lt;There is no requirement of thinking for a child when they watch hours of<br/>
TV&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends on how you watch TV.  Example:  We watched Shackleton on TV.  Just<br/>
naturally answering the kids&#39; questions, we discussed ethics of marriage and<br/>
pet ownership, fund raising, geography, British aristocracy, Shakespeare,<br/>
etc..  We even got out the globe and followed along with the explorers.<br/>
Just last night, we watched &quot;The Old Maid&quot; with Bette Davis.  We discussed<br/>
social mores in the 1870&#39;s, dress fashions and how they change, ethics of<br/>
imposing your decisions on others, etc..<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I read a lot.....&quot;Sweet Savage Love&quot; didn&#39;t do much to<br/>
improve my brain power....however, I find that &quot;Spongebob Squarepants&quot; does,<br/>
with all the puns and such.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I see a big advantage in doing stuff simply because you like it, not<br/>
necessarily to improve yourself.  If you are happy, you are &quot;improved&quot;.  :)<br/>

Have you seen all the self-help books out there these days, for ADULTS, about <br/>
how to be happy? Happiness is apparently not all that easy and not all that <br/>
common. I WONDER if maybe that&#39;s because it wasn&#39;t encouraged in people when <br/>
they were children.<br/>

apparently we were not taking physical education seriously enough. <br/>
having fun while playing games -- whatever was wrong with us?<br/>
