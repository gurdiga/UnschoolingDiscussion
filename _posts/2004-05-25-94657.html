&lt;&lt; What do you do when he&#39;s nearly a teenager, still struggling with these<br/>
things, and embarrassed when he&#39;s with friends and you can&#39;t help him? &gt;&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m probably late for this thread or maybe it isn&#39;t important what I have to <br/>
say but when Alyssa was 11 she started to read.  She couldn&#39;t read before and <br/>
phonics just made big tears.  I couldn&#39;t stand them.  She reads now.  She <br/>
started really reading at 12.  I stopped all phonics and reading lessons at nine. <br/>
I wasn&#39;t sure if she could ever read well or not.  Now she speed reads.  She <br/>
does very well.  And she is spelling too.  Why?  Because she wants her friends <br/>
to know what she has to say when she im&#39;s them or emails them.  Because I <br/>
allow her to play on neopets as long as she wants, and she wants to know how to <br/>
spell because she wants people to go to her shop.  Caitlin can&#39;t really read <br/>
yet.  She is doing neopets too and wants to now.  She is 11 and I am pretty sure <br/>
she will read.  Caitlin has had a problem with alot of reversal of letters and <br/>
numbers.  Typing helps unless she puts the word out totally backwards.  But <br/>
she is starting to see it when she does it.  Frankie can only read words that <br/>
pertain to codes and games.  LOL words like all weapons, and lots of money or <br/>
life.  Not really but those words interest him.  He can read Harry the dirty <br/>
dog and other Harry books because he loves them.  We both love goose bump books. <br/>
 Books I used to ban my oldest son from.  He&#39;s 9 going on 10.  I fret <br/>
sometimes but I don&#39;t want to affect them with my fretting so I keep it to myself.  <br/>
They are fine.  I am the one that is not fine LOL.  I keep reading this list <br/>
and learning.  We live in Fl so now is the time for all parents to panic because <br/>
evaluations are due.  I hate those things.  I&#39;m wanting someone that is unsch<br/>
ooling friendly.  Does anyone know anyone that is truly unschooling friendly <br/>
that has a teachers certificate??  Stepheny<br/>

evaluation (over the phone or through email)?  I know unschooling <br/>
friendly evaluators in Pennsylvania. <br/>
