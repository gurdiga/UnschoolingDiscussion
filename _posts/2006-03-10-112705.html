<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014721222">Europe is still full of royalty - some countries I can think of that have <br/>
kings and kings include Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Denmark, <br/>
Greece, Norway. Other royal monarchs (princes and dukes) are in Monaco, <br/>
Liechtenstein and Portugal. Most of these people are all related to each <br/>
other, although lately the royal houses are getting fresh blood in. The new <br/>
wife of the crown prince of Denmark, who is Australian, is very popular in <br/>
Europe.<br/>
<br/>
The European royalty provide plenty of fodder for the gossip magazines in <br/>
Europe.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did a google search on European royalty and came to this interesting page <br/>
on inherited personality traits in royal families.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I suppose this sort of ties in with today&#39;s geography lesson &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Jackie asked me if there are still countries with kings and queens.<br/>
&gt;  I said<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know that England has a queen and a prince, and I thought there were<br/>
&gt; &gt; others, but was not sure about the details.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t know about a list. But just the other day we watched a<br/>
&gt;National Geographic DVD about royalty (may be search that term)of<br/>
&gt;three kingdoms (Britain, African country and an island someplace -- I<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t retained much from that geography lesson :) ).<br/>
