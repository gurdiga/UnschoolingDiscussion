<br/>
I need some help from you veterans (and maybe even some not-so-veterans!)<br/>
<br/>
My son, Bay, is just turned 12. He a kind, centered, precious boy. I am<br/>
feeling those old qualms about this schooling path come up for me, however<br/>
(partially brought on by an ex-husband who is not understanding unschooling). <br/>
<br/>
A bit of background . . . son Sky (19) and daughter Nell (16) went to our<br/>
local small Waldorf school through 6th grade . . . had really positive<br/>
experiences and when the options for jr/high school ran out - they came<br/>
home and did a curriculum for a bit, then went to Not Back to School Camp<br/>
and were inspired to throw the whole thing out and unschool, which has<br/>
really gone well for them both, with me in a supportive position. Bay went<br/>
to the same Waldorf school and really disliked it from the beginning -<br/>
resisted the form from the get-go. So, I cajolled him for a time and then<br/>
saw the idiocy in that and brought him home when the signs were clear, in<br/>
4th grade, that it was insane. He has never done a curriculum. He dislikes<br/>
sitting down to &#39;do&#39; math - but seems to have a good grasp of the way it<br/>
works. He reads really well, but doesn&#39;t enjoy reading much (in this family<br/>
- that is downright bizarre!) He has an electric guitar, but doesn&#39;t play<br/>
it much and doesn&#39;t seem to want to try another instrument. He doesn&#39;t like<br/>
to write. What he likes to do is move - surf, skateboard. His greatest<br/>
passion now is dirtbiking. He has saved from his landscape maintenance jobs<br/>
almost enough money to buy his own! He mows and weedwhacks our entire 4<br/>
acres. He is interested in motors and such. He likes the computer - plays<br/>
Motocross Madness and Age of Empires and such with his brother and his<br/>
friends. Likes his Gameboy. He is social to the max - and is the only<br/>
homeschooled boy his age on the entire northshore of Kauai. He likes<br/>
television, but the good opportunities for viewing are rare. He likes<br/>
storytapes and, even more, the stories his older brother weaves for him all<br/>
the time. When nothing is &#39;happening&#39; around here, he has a lament of &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
bored - what can I do?&quot; My suggestions are often met with disdane.<br/>
<br/>
I am feeling like he is not getting a strong educational experience - will<br/>
be &#39;weak&#39; in his language arts and math skills. (Go easy on me, folks -<br/>
these are my deep-seated fears from decades of conditioning and too many<br/>
recent conversations/attacks with ex-husband! - and, remember, his siblings<br/>
unschooling experiences came later, when their skills/learning patterns<br/>
were in place.) I worry that Bay is easily bored and would spend hours only<br/>
on the computer, if he were able (we have to share one computer for all 4<br/>
of us, so that is not possible). With the children&#39;s help, I run three home<br/>
businesses, so my time is maxed out often, although I am here.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas/thought/suggestions/support would be really appreciated. Let me<br/>
give you any more background, if it would help - I&#39;m really needing some<br/>
input from this great list.<br/>

<br/>
******* Hi Lee... here&#39;s a bit of my background so you&#39;ll see where <br/>
I&#39;m coming from. My daughter Laurie is 22 and was unschooled all of <br/>
her life. She now has a BS in Sociology and is continuing her <br/>
education. Her father (now my ex) pushed me to put her in school too. <br/>
When she was midway through college, he thanked me for not listening <br/>
to him. Ask him to read some books about unschooling? Mine wouldn&#39;t <br/>
read them.. he already knew everything. (sarcasm bigtime)<br/>
<br/>
  When nothing is &#39;happening&#39; around here, he has a lament of &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bored - what can I do?&quot; My suggestions are often met with disdane.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>******* I&#39;ve found that when someone says they are bored, they don&#39;t <br/>
want suggestions, they just want to know someone hears them. Someone <br/>
to empathize with what they&#39;re feeling.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am feeling like he is not getting a strong educational <br/>
 </span></blockquote>experience - will be &#39;weak&#39; in his language arts and math skills. <br/>
<br/>
*******If he&#39;s allowed to pursue his true interests, he will become <br/>
strong in language arts and math skills when he needs them. Right now <br/>
he&#39;s too busy to care. He&#39;s interested in motors, he&#39;ll learn math <br/>
without even realizing it. A strong educational experience is not a <br/>
good thing when it&#39;s forced upon someone. It becomes torture.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I worry that Bay is easily bored and would spend hours only<br/>
&gt; on the computer, if he were able <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>******* We bought Laurie a computer at age 11. She was an avid reader <br/>
before getting the computer but rarely read a book for the next eight <br/>
years. She was immersed in the computer, playing games all night and <br/>
learning how a computer works. At age 18 she built two computers and <br/>
fully understood them. She helped professors in college with computer <br/>
skills. She taught her Computer Basics Professor quite a few tricks. <br/>
Now the computer is a tool and she never just sits and surfs for fun. <br/>
A game will get her attention when she needs some chilling out time, <br/>
but that&#39;s it. She reads books constantly now.<br/>
<br/>
I think you already know this, but trust him to get what he needs <br/>
from life. Tell ex is he&#39;s really concerned that there are many books <br/>
to enlighten him.<br/>
<br/>

To me, it sounds like your newly unschooled son is doing fine. He&#39;s able to <br/>
save money doing &quot;jobs&quot;, he&#39;s got a passion (dirt bikes), good on <br/>
computers, etc. etc., and he&#39;s *only* 12. That&#39;s way more than I was doing <br/>
at that age, and I think I turned out okay :) Give it another year, <br/>
breathe, relax, and so on, and then re-evaluate. Has *he* said, &quot;This <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t working...fix it!&quot; ? If not, I would talk *in-depth* <br/>
w/him about your worries. Maybe he can also help alleviate some of them. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Lee,<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;d like to say that I&#39;ve visited your website and I am truly <br/>
envious of where you live. It looks beautiful!! A true paradise. Our <br/>
family has never visited Hawaii, not for lack of wanting! But we talk <br/>
about going &quot;some day&quot;. If and when we do, your Tropical B&B Cottages <br/>
sound lovely and we&#39;ll consider staying at your farms.<br/>
<br/>
Now about your son Bay. He sounds so much like my boys Ben (11) and <br/>
Jon (9). My boys have never been to school and I did school-at-home <br/>
with the for 5 years before unschooling for the past year. I was so <br/>
happy to find unschooling because our homeschooling efforts were <br/>
making us all miserable.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He dislikes sitting down to &#39;do&#39; math - but seems to have a good <br/>
&gt;grasp of the way it works. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This describes both of my sons. They do basically understand math. <br/>
They even sit down occasionally with a math curriculum and do a page <br/>
or two. But they won&#39;t open the book again for a month or more. <br/>
Sometimes they surprise me when they do a quick calculation in their <br/>
head without even thinking hard - because it&#39;s relevant to them. They <br/>
are whizzes when it comes to money and buying things they want. They <br/>
have it all figured out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He reads really well, but doesn&#39;t enjoy reading much (in this family<br/>
&gt; - that is downright bizarre!) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My older son Ben reads well, but also doesn&#39;t read much. He likes to <br/>
read Calvin and Hobbes and skateboard books from the library, and <br/>
lots of cheats that he looks up on the internet (by himself). Lately <br/>
he also checked out a bunch of books on How to do Card Tricks at the <br/>
library - and learned some good tricks on his own!<br/>
<br/>
My younger son Jon has slowly been learning to read this past year of <br/>
unschooling, on his own, just by reading while he&#39;s playing his <br/>
Gameboy or his computer games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He has an electric guitar, but doesn&#39;t play<br/>
&gt; it much and doesn&#39;t seem to want to try another instrument. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ben and Jon both started played instruments for a year and then they <br/>
just decided they didn&#39;t want to anymore. They were playing so well! <br/>
Ben played the trumpet and Jon played the clarinet. They even played <br/>
duets together. I was sad to see them quit playing but knew that <br/>
making them play when they didn&#39;t want to anymore would ruin any fun <br/>
they had experienced with their instruments the year before. They do <br/>
want to learn to play the sax with my husband, though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He doesn&#39;t like to write. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My boys don&#39;t like to write either, except they are already working <br/>
on their Christmas lists. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What he likes to do is move - surf, skateboard. His greatest<br/>
&gt; passion now is dirtbiking. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, Yes! My boys love roller blading, scootering and are trying to <br/>
get better at skateboarding (it&#39;s really hard!). They love riding <br/>
bikes and I&#39;m sure would love surfing if given a chance (we live in <br/>
Arizona). They love playing games, running, jumping, and generally <br/>
moving. We belong to a homeschool PE group that meets once a week and <br/>
participating in that is the highlight of their week (unlike my <br/>
torturous memories of PE in school. LOL)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He likes the computer - plays Motocross Madness and Age of Empires <br/>
&gt;and such with his brother and his friends. Likes his Gameboy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes again. They like Monster Truck Madness, Age of Empires, <br/>
Rollercoaster Tycoon, Skateboard Tycoon, and Microsoft Flight <br/>
Simulator just to name a few. Then there&#39;s Tony Hawkes 1, 2 & 3 on <br/>
Playstation and Gameboy, and also many different Pokemon games for <br/>
their Gameboy. They are also heavily into card collecting, even <br/>
getting back into Pokemon cards (thank goodness they listened to me <br/>
when I talked them out of selling their collection a year ago, LOL), <br/>
and Harry Potter cards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been trying to watch more movies with them - whatever <br/>
they&#39;ll watch with me. I just rented Merlin and maybe we&#39;ll see that <br/>
tonight. And we still need to watch Monsters, Inc. that we picked up <br/>
at Blockbuster yesterday.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s getting redundant, I know, but yes again. They love their <br/>
friends and take any opportunity to play with them. They play long <br/>
and hard. Last week after PE a few of us stayed at the park and the <br/>
kids all chose swords (sticks) and were having sword fights for at <br/>
least an hour or two. They get along so well with their friends. They <br/>
even play happily with the 6 year girl who is homeschooled and lives <br/>
across the street (they were doing that this morning).<br/>
<br/>
And yes, they love listening to storytapes, too, but only in the car. <br/>
They hate listening at home because it&#39;s too confining to have to <br/>
stay in the same room for any length of time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you believe that with all this activity going on I still <br/>
hear &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; often enough? Sometimes I&#39;ll suggest something they <br/>
could do or something I could do with them. Sometimes I just leave <br/>
them be and tell them I&#39;m sorry that they feel bored.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear ya, I still get those feelings, too, sometimes. And I realize <br/>
that it only happens when I fall for the comparison trap. When I <br/>
start comparing them to others, I feel like they should know how to <br/>
spell better by now, or be reading certain books, or know how to do <br/>
this math concept, or WHATEVER. And then I read something that <br/>
someone else has written either here or at unschooling.com and my <br/>
fears are calmed. And we can go on happily living our unschooling <br/>
lives.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My boys do have unlimited computer access because they each have <br/>
their own computer, and sometimes they do spend hours on the <br/>
computer, but some days it doesn&#39;t even get turned on! The same with <br/>
TV. They love their shows like Spongebob and a few other shows on <br/>
NICK, some on PBS, but they probably watch about 1-2 hours a day. Not <br/>
excessive, IMO. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
BORED NO MORE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
by SandraDodd, 1998<br/>
<br/>
Another homeschooling mom once wrote, “It&#39;s a valuable lesson to learn to <br/>
deal with boredom, just like all other emotions.” <br/>
<br/>
Until I read that, I hadn’t ever thought of boredom as an emotion. I liked <br/>
the idea. When a child comes to me seeking advice on how to deal with any <br/>
emotional state, I&#39;m flattered and glad for the opportunity. <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally in this culture boredom is seen as a state of sin. “I’m bored” <br/>
is met by unthinking parents with, “Then mop the kitchen,” or “You have a <br/>
thousand dollars’ worth of toys, you can’t be bored,” or “Boredom’s good <br/>
for you.” I believe the VERY common habit of belittling children who use the <br/>
word “bored” should be rethought (or “thought,” since it seems many parents <br/>
have never considered it carefully but just repeat what their parents said to <br/>
them). <br/>
<br/>
If a child came and said she was heartbroken would you tell her she was a <br/>
brat and should clean the garage? If a child came and said he was angry <br/>
enough to hit would you say, “Then sit down and read a book whether you want <br/>
to or not”? Wouldn’t you try to help them? It&#39;s nonsensical to me that some <br/>
parents shame their children for saying they are at a loss about what to do <br/>
next. <br/>
<br/>
The most to be accomplished from punishing or sending bored kids away is that <br/>
the kids will learn not to go to that parent for advice and ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the real message behind &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is &quot;I&#39;m little and feeling <br/>
agitated and vaguely unhappy and I don&#39;t know what I can do to get over this <br/>
uncomfortable feeling. What would you do if you were my age, in this house, <br/>
on a day like this?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think that deserves a helpful, respectful response. <br/>
<br/>
It is rare that my children say, “I’m bored,” but when they do I walk with <br/>
them where they are, or to some other part of the house, thinking quickly <br/>
about what I might have that they have never seen, or haven’t seen for a <br/>
while. I think of art supplies or games or toys or musical instruments they <br/>
haven’t thought of for a long time. I scan my mind and the house for things <br/>
which would provide some visual, auditory, olfactory, or mental stimulation, <br/>
preferably two or three of those. Tactile stimulation is good too--perhaps <br/>
the offer of a shower or bath with new/different toys, or different soap or <br/>
something. Sometimes “watering the yard” (playing with the hose) will do. <br/>
When a baby cries for no clear reason, parents will often joyfully see <br/>
whether the baby means “I’m uncomfortable.” They’ll try a change of cloth<br/>
es, physical contact, a change of temperature, more air, less air, hot <br/>
food, cold food, a stroll outside, a car ride, SOMETHING different. Older <br/>
kids have the same needs, and the expression of that need might come through <br/>
as whining, irritability, or a claim of boredom. <br/>
Maybe it’s not physical need, but intellectual need. Boredom is a desire for <br/>
input which unschooling parents should welcome. It’s a child saying “How can <br/>
I add excitement to my life?” This can be a big opportunity to introduce a <br/>
new subject, activity, or thought-collection. <br/>
Maybe it’s an emotional need, and the parent’s undivided attention for a <br/>
little while will solve the problem. A walk, some joking, a hug, inquiries <br/>
about progress on the child’s projects or plans or friends might serve many <br/>
purposes at once. If after a walk and a talk the child is not quite <br/>
refreshed, you still had that time together, which made “I’m bored” a useful <br/>
invitation to bonding. <br/>
Sometimes “bored” means tired, low on energy, needing a break from conscious <br/>
thought and responsibility. Arranging a nap, or putting on a soothing video <br/>
(even for older kids--a romance instead of an action flick, or light drama <br/>
instead of comedy), leaving a pillow on the couch and herding the rest of the <br/>
family in other directions might result in an unplanned but needed nap. <br/>
I’m grown. I still get bored occasionally. Thinking about why I’m bored and <br/>
forgiving myself for being bored have helped me assist my children in <br/>
learning some coping skills they can use in their own lives. I have also used <br/>
my occasional boredom as a trigger to seek out the kids. If there’s a lull in <br/>
my life now I should fill it with those children who will be gone too soon. <br/>
Welcome opportunities to learn about when and why your child asks for your <br/>
advice and stimulation. The threshhold of needing the parent will change over <br/>
time, and parents can really use knowing where it is and seeing the benefit <br/>
in it. One complaint of parents of school kids is that communications are <br/>
lacking or are misunderstood. Homeschoolers have the fulltime luxury of the <br/>
chance to do better. Unschoolers have the added advantage of “counting” <br/>
every interaction as a learning experience. Self awareness, interpersonal <br/>
skills, creativity and compassion all come into play when a child and a <br/>
parent can build an uplifting memory from “I’m bored.” <br/>
