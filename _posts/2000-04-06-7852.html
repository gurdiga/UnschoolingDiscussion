<div id="ygrps-yiv-745111977">Hi!  Well, I mostly have been lingering on this list as I have been making<br/>
some unschooling decisions for our family.   And mostly just don&#39;t have<br/>
much to say.  But I had to put in my 2 cents here since everyone else is. <br/>
I must say that I feel honored to be among both breastfeeding zealots,<br/>
fanatics, advocates and whatever else you might call yourself or others<br/>
call you.  And equally honored to be here with people like Kim who<br/>
recognize breastfeeding is best, but are one of the rare people who<br/>
physically were unable to breastfeed.  Personally, I have been<br/>
breastfeeding for over 4 1/2 years over 2 of which has been tandem nursing.<br/>
 My 4 1/2 year old daughter just weaned herself last month.  I am aware<br/>
that there are a few moms who can not nurse.  I have just never met one of<br/>
those moms who could truly not.  So Kim, what you had to share has<br/>
enlightened me and intrigued me.  I am currently in the process of becoming<br/>
a La Leche League leader.  My attitude towards breastfeeding has changed<br/>
and grown considerably over the last few years.  While I am more aware than<br/>
ever why breastfeeding is so important I have become less judgemental. <br/>
While I use to say to my daughter whenever we saw a bottle feeding baby,<br/>
&quot;poor baby has to drink from a bottle and can&#39;t have mommy&#39;s milk,&quot; I am<br/>
more aware of people having circumstances that I know nothing about. <br/>
People like Kim, or an adoptive mom who either did not know she could<br/>
induce lactation or was not successful at it, or others who were simply<br/>
misinformed or had no information.  Personally, I have decided to spend<br/>
less energy attacking women who bottlefeed their children and more energy<br/>
in informing moms and couples in the importance of breastmilk, the ease of<br/>
breastfeeding, and how to overcome obstacles in breastfeeding.  While Kim<br/>
did not share why she couldn&#39;t breastfeed, scientific evidence has<br/>
indicated that few women truly cannot although everywhere I turn, moms are<br/>
tellling me they couldn&#39;t for reasons that I know are myths.  Even doctors<br/>
have incorrectly told women they couldn&#39;t breastfeed.  That scares me.  I<br/>
have also known women who have been able to breastfeed when all the worst<br/>
was stacked against them.  My own stepmom had a complete blood transfusion<br/>
after the birth of my daughter.  She physically should not have been able<br/>
to produce milk after that (so the doctors said) but she was able to<br/>
reinduce lactation.  So, I guess I am rambling here, but personally I have<br/>
respect for any and every woman who has even attempted breastfeeding. <br/>
Every little bit is more than anything.  And like Kim, the fact that she<br/>
sadly has suffered over not being able to breastfeed, shows her true heart<br/>
to that fact that she had really wanted to.  I honor and respect those<br/>
women.  Well, kudos to all of us moms who just want the best we can give to<br/>
our children and families.  Whatever the &quot;best&quot; may be for us as<br/>
individuals.</div>
