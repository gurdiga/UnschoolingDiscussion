<div id="ygrps-yiv-842322343">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just got my first digest from this group today. Looks good. I&#39;ve been<br/>
homeschooling my kids from the start. Logan is 14 and Caspian is 8. We&#39;ve been<br/>
unschooling all along, but this year the Alberta government has tightened up the<br/>
regulations for homeschoolers, and we have to submit to 2 x a year assessments and<br/>
standardized testing in grades 3, 6 & 9. Bummer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my older son and I are both challenged with bipolar disorder (manic<br/>
depression), and this has been a very difficult year health-wise for me. My mother<br/>
has been helping out by providing &#39;Grandma School&#39; for the boys, which has been<br/>
basically helping them memorise their times-tables, and get the basics of<br/>
multiplying, dividing, basic geography, etc. They already read very well, but we<br/>
don&#39;t want trouble from the powers that be about them not being at grade level.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering how others have managed to have teens meet the &#39;required standards&#39;,<br/>
when their interests do not lie in those directions; ie: grade 8 or 9 math, etc.<br/>
Logan is very oppositional, and ends up depressed when he can&#39;t or won&#39;t do what<br/>
is asked of him, and then decides he is just not &#39;good enough&#39;, no matter how much<br/>
I try to assure him otherwise. Any suggestions or experiences to share? Thanks in<br/>
advance, and I look forward to hearing from all of you.<br/>

<br/>
Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
My experience is with my 11 year old son.  We periodicaly do required-type<br/>
math, usually when we have to prepare for a standardized test.  It helps us<br/>
to work on it only for a certain period of time--say 4 to 6 weeks--then law<br/>
off.  My son has yet to master all the multiplication tables, but does know<br/>
them up to 5.  Yet, he can figure out many math problems that come up in<br/>
daily life.  He uses math for carpentry and managing his money.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133194202">Hey, HI!!!<br/>
<br/>
Another Canadian!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Saskatoon.  We came from Alberta before moving here.  You&#39;re<br/>
scaring me with this assessment and standardized testing stuff...How<br/>
exactly DO unschoolers get around that?  We may soon be facing a move<br/>
again, and I&#39;d like to know how we&#39;d manage in a stricter environment.<br/>
<br/>
Here, the school board offers everything as an option to those who so<br/>
choose, ie, curriculum, standardized tests etc.  Otherwise, we meet with<br/>
a liason from the school board once a year, (usually in June) and hand<br/>
over:  a summative record of the year&#39;s experience, some sample works<br/>
(just about anything counts:  my son made a homemade fishing rod last<br/>
year and we usually take some drawings the kids have done.), and a<br/>
periodic log.  Not unlike some of the &quot;day in the life of&quot; essays I&#39;ve<br/>
been reading on this list lately.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what is expected in the U. S. of A., or elsewhere in<br/>
Canada but I guess comparatively speaking Saskatchewan is reasonably<br/>
progressive with its schooling...or &quot;un&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t mind knowing what the expectations are regarding<br/>
homeschooling in Massachusetts if anyone out there knows...A move to<br/>
Boston may be in our future...<br/>
