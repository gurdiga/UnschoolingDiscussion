Wow.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know what to say to this.<br/>
<br/>
(On the other hand, you could take it as a compliment &lt;wry grin&gt; -- you&#39;re<br/>
in good company with many others that people would like to silence<br/>
completely. A mark of your success!)<br/>

There are fringes of the homeschooling community who scare the potatoes out<br/>

<br/>
 It was not the obvious one that did it. It is just one small group. One<br/>
person wrote an email to Holly & she joined the unschooling forum yahoo list<br/>
to question it. This person posted a copy of her email on 2 yahoo lists that<br/>
I know of. The other person added to the problem claiming racism. That is<br/>
what bothered Holly the most. I told her I would send her message numbers of<br/>
some of the racism stuff from unschoolingdotcom that was implied & send it<br/>
to her if I could find them. I found them rather quickly. I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
it was racist at all. The specific ones named were about Arabs & Indians.<br/>
So, the people that are involved will know who the parties are. I let Holly<br/>
know that I would definitely be at the Houston conference mainly because of<br/>
Sandra.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, Sandra, this is awful!  I&#39;m really sorry you have to put up with<br/>
this crap.<br/>
<br/>
It might be good for us on-list, from time to time, to remember the<br/>
details of the harassment of Cheryl Seelhoff, and her eventual victory<br/>
in court.  There are  probably people on this list that weren&#39;t around<br/>
when it happened and missed the value of this important  lesson.  The<br/>
case sheds a fascinating light on an extrememly ugly side of human<br/>
nature.  And history tends to repeat itself.<br/>
<br/>
I personally don&#39;t know exactly where free speech ends and conspiracy<br/>
begins.  But anyone mounting a smear campaign had better find out.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>

What&#39;s being said seems nonsensical, so I&#39;m afraid the whole thing will <br/>
backfire on them, lose them some of the few friends they have now, and make <br/>
them look like liars.  One charge is that I&#39;m racist because I said Arabs are <br/>
Caucasian.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think about that too hard; it won&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
And that I don&#39;t like New Yorkers or dads or Republicans.  Racist because of <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
So far this morning I have better unschooling stories of what&#39;s happened here <br/>
today than some of them will have by nighttime, and it&#39;s only 11:00 a.m. AND <br/>
I&#39;ve talked to a pregnant friend in England for over half an hour and have <br/>
dealt with conference/boycott mail (all of it in my favor).   And it&#39;s going <br/>
to rain again today!  YES!!!  Droughts don&#39;t end just because of a few rains, <br/>
but rain is wonderful after a drought!<br/>
<br/>
My tomatoes are getting ripe and Holly brought one in that fell off in her <br/>
hand.  I think I&#39;ll go and eat it.  She doesn&#39;t like tomatoes yet.  She just <br/>
brings them to me.<br/>

<br/>
Sandra, you send a joyful message of the wonder and awe of being blessed<br/>
with children.  It is one that I need to hear over and over.  Even today, as<br/>
we enter our third year of radical unschooling, I continue to discover new<br/>
ways our society marginalizes children.  It is just soooo pervasive.  My<br/>
understanding  is truly like an onion, with each layer a new awareness of<br/>
how disenfranchised our children often are.  I don&#39;t know if I would have<br/>
ever reached the meager level of recognition I have if it weren&#39;t for you,<br/>
Sandra.  I thank you.....and I&#39;m pretty darn sure my kids would say the same<br/>
thing.<br/>

from plant to plant,  plucking a huge tomato, taking a giant bite out of <br/>
it, throwing it down, and heading for the next one.  Ever since then we&#39;ve <br/>
called him our tomatey boy.<br/>
