This is a site where you earn rice by correctly answering vocabulary <br/>
questions; the rice is distributed to hungry people all over the world. <br/>
  Each correct answer provides 10 grains of rice; I just donated 2000 <br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
The level of difficulty depends on your answers, so kids can play, <br/>
English learners can play, and those of us who are, well, wordy, can be <br/>
challenged, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905275967">another point about this site is that you can get so absorbed discussing<br/>
words with your 17yo son that your jam boils over, all over the gas stove<br/>
top, down into the grill, and then you can have fun spending the next one<br/>
and a half hours cleaning the ******** thing!!<br/>
<br/>
alternatively, you could do it at a time when you aren&#39;t in the middle of<br/>
making jam....<br/>

  Okay, that was totally addictive! I just spent 1/2 an hour doing that before I remembered I&#39;m supposed to be doing something else &lt;sheepishg&gt;. Whoops. It has now been favorited to come back to later :-)<br/>
  Thanks Nancy!<br/>
