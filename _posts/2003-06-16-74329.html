<h4>Have A Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995809257">Welllll.....<br/>
<br/>
It looks like we are hosting a Camp Out here.  We&#39;ve got the campfire going, and 2 tents set up in the yard where the boys will sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Now my 2 daughters are over across the street helping a couple of girls pack their things and they will be pitching two more tents, in the other yard. LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;ll have about 9 kids here altogether and there is at least one more who isn&#39;t planning to stay all night.<br/>
<br/>
Goodness, I hope they are quiet tonight with it being Sunday night and all.  People will be getting up early for work in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Should be interesting.  I hope they behave!<br/>
