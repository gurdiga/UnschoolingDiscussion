<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319507608">The question, in a nutshell, is:  when<br/>
a loved one is terminally ill, how and when<br/>
to share that news with the children?<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m guessing the answer is, &quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The longer version:  I&#39;ve recently gone through <br/>
an experience where I felt that the right thing was <br/>
to tell my children that their grandmother hasn&#39;t <br/>
got long to live.  But their grandmother has been<br/>
adamant that they not be told.  So I didn&#39;t <br/>
tell, until she faced a health crisis that led them to <br/>
ask me point blank, &quot;Is Grandma&#39;s cancer back?&quot;<br/>
My face revealed the truth even as my words<br/>
didn&#39;t.  My response was, &quot;I need to talk to your<br/>
grandma about that, and then, we can talk more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She did give permission to answer their direct<br/>
question honestly, which I did, but I could tell that <br/>
my children were disappointed in me that I had<br/>
not told them sooner.  I had lied to them, a lie<br/>
of omission, and that shook their trust in me.<br/>
I told them that I had kept the truth from them<br/>
specifically because their grandmother had<br/>
told me that she did not want them to know.<br/>
She didn&#39;t want them to worry.  She didn&#39;t want<br/>
them to &quot;fuss over her.&quot;  She just wants to enjoy<br/>
what time she has left without everybody getting<br/>
all weepy at the thought that &quot;this may be the<br/>
last visit.&quot;  She wanted to spare them the negativity.<br/>
I told the kids that keeping the secret hadn&#39;t felt good to me,<br/>
but I felt, at the same time, that respecting their grandma&#39;s <br/>
privacy was the better of two hard choices.<br/>
<br/>
One of my daughters said to me, &quot;Mom, I want you to<br/>
promise me that from now on, you will always tell me the truth,  <br/>
no matter how painful it is,okay?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OUCH!<br/>

<br/>
The relationship between a mother and young child is the primary  <br/>
business of that mother.   The relationship between an older mother  <br/>
and an adult child is primarily the business of the adult child.  At  <br/>
some point, say &quot;I&#39;m too old for you tell me what to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The most extreme case I&#39;ve ever seen of one adult telling another  <br/>
adult what to do was an ex husband telling the ex wife &quot;I don&#39;t want  <br/>
you to ever mention my name when I&#39;m not there.  Never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How stupid.<br/>
<br/>
She half thought he had the right to do that, that he had the right to  <br/>
&quot;privacy,&quot; but it&#39;s not so.<br/>
<br/>
Our children are counting on us to make rational, responsible  <br/>
decisions for their benefit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying to tell little kids more than they can handle, I&#39;m just  <br/>
saying that grandmothers don&#39;t get to decide what grandchildren know  <br/>
or don&#39;t know.  It&#39;s not a matter of &quot;permission.&quot;  If there&#39;s a  <br/>
persuasive reason, great!  If the middle person (adult child/parent of  <br/>
young children) is persuaded, that&#39;s fair.  But to dictate to an adult  <br/>
what she can or cannot say or do with her own children is out of bounds.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357859731">We had a similar situation with our daughter and step daughter a few years ago. We had a very hard decision to make, neither grandmother wanted the girls to know that they were dying. We were celebrating life at the same time as our son was born during this time. We waited too long to tell them and that hurt them as much as it did to lose their grandmothers. We lost them both within months of each other. We thought we were doing the right thing but a lie by omission is still a lie and it broke their trust in us. <br/>
<br/>
We have learned and have been up front with our daughter (step daughter chose to break connections and go back to her mom, for far too many reasons to list here) regarding both grandfathers. One she knows very well the other only vaguely but we still have been honest with her regarding their health. The 4 yr old we simply tell him that they are sick he has been fortunate in that he has not yet experienced a death of a human family member. I am not sure how much of our dog&#39;s death he actually understood or that of his goldfish. It is uncomfortable and a hard task to tell one&#39;s children that someone that they love and care for will not always be around but it is an unfortunate part of life. <br/>
<br/>
I do wish I had been competent enough at the time to at least look at both moms and use their own philosophy on them, they both had the same saying they shared with their children. &quot;Honest is the best policy.&quot; <br/>

understood her asking that. She would have wanted the same thing, I <br/>
think - not to have the grandkids know it was terminal until she was <br/>
pretty far incapacitated - because she&#39;d have wanted to have her usual <br/>
fantastic relationship with them as long as possible without it being <br/>
tainted by fear and sadness.<br/>
<br/>
She had no chance to ask that because she died when very healthy, with <br/>
no prior symptoms of any kind. So I&#39;m just guessing - not basing it on <br/>
experience - but I can easily imagine the scenario in which she would <br/>
have asked my sisters and I not to tell the kids for a while.<br/>

&gt; too,  maybe? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve got two people with similar situations, but I am the original <br/>
poster, and I can tell you that what made it (feel like?) a lie is<br/>
that the kids were told about the original illness, and then, when<br/>
the cancer had gone into remission, were told by their grandparents<br/>
that grandma was better.  Then, when the cancer recurred, mother-<br/>
in-law told us not to tell the kids.  And the kids would every so often<br/>
say things along the lines of, &quot;I&#39;m so glad Grandma&#39;s cancer didn&#39;t come <br/>
back.&quot;  My silence in the face of statements like that was a lie.  Or,<br/>
it really feels like one, anyway.  To me and to DD.<br/>
<br/>
As for the reasoning...  The prognosis was poor--only 5% of<br/>
patients survive five years--but mother-in-law is an optimist and <br/>
believes in the power of positive thinking and is into living in the now <br/>
and did not want the now to always be darkened by the cloud of the<br/>
future.  She wanted to believe she&#39;d live the full five years, and<br/>
five years is an eternity for a child, so why let a child worry for<br/>
practically an eternity, about something the child cannot change?<br/>
So, two reasons.  She did not want to live out her last years being<br/>
pitied and fretted over, and she did not want her grandchildren<br/>
to spend a good portion of their childhoods fretting about a<br/>
sad reality they could do nothing about.<br/>
<br/>
I thought those were good reasons, until MIL took a turn<br/>
for the worse and the prognosis worsened to the point that<br/>
I knew that our recent visit to her home might very well be<br/>
the last time the kids saw her.  (I was wrong; she&#39;s hanging<br/>
in there and will actually be coming to our home for a few days<br/>
next week), but at the time, my feeling was, &quot;This is precious<br/>
time, and they have a right to know it.&quot;  So the fact that<br/>
MIL had a crisis that forced a revelation was a relief to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, even if they wished they&#39;d been told sooner, they would have <br/>
&gt; understood why I didn&#39;t tell them <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They did understand, but understanding and agreement are not<br/>
the same thing, and DD did not agree with my decision to with-<br/>
hold that information from her. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they wouldn&#39;t generalize it to then suspect me of lying in the future.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps I am being self-defensive here, but I really don&#39;t think she<br/>
was suspicious.  I think she just wanted to be *very* clear to me that<br/>
she wants the truth from me, no matter what.  I messed up and<br/>
she was calling me on it, saying, in effect, &quot;Let&#39;s not have you make<br/>
this mistake again.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They&#39;d understand that was a unique situation.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, it&#39;s not a unique situation.  Death is a universal.  I do believe<br/>
children would fear it less if adults feared it less, and were less<br/>
secretive about it.  My kids weren&#39;t *overly* sad during the six<br/>
months from the initial diagnosis until the remission; they were<br/>
sad and they channeled that into enjoying every moment they <br/>
got to spend with their grandmother.  Looking at that truth:  <br/>
they could&#39;ve handled the knowledge that the cancer had come<br/>
back and that Grandma might be around for Bar Mitzvah, but<br/>
definitely would not be attending their weddings or welcoming<br/>
*their* children into the world.  <br/>
<br/>
This was a case of letting fear dictate choice.<br/>
<br/>
I *try* to practice mindfulness.  I guess it&#39;s true what<br/>
Yoda says...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, DH bought a bottle of very high quality<br/>
champagne for when his parents come to visit.<br/>
His mother has said that one thing she has always<br/>
wanted to do, but has never done, is to taste Dom<br/>
Perignon.  DH went out and bought something<br/>
better than that for her.  We will celebrate the time<br/>
we have, and the children will share in the knowledge<br/>
that the time is very precious.<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to let you know I completely and totally agree with you. The worst damage and stress I&#39;ve seen is when information is withheld from a child (I&#39;m not talking minor details, but information about disease/death etc...) when there are life impacting situations evolving in a family.<br/>
<br/>
Adults ASSUME the whole &quot;fear and sadness hanging over a child&quot; but in my experience children handle tough situations much better than adults! My dd Sierra used to sit with her Grandma and tell her stories and rub her back each night. My mother&#39;s illness was an opportunity for her to bond in an even deeper manner.<br/>
<br/>
My mother didn&#39;t hide things, she didn&#39;t exaggerate them either. Her cancer was a simple fact of life and that&#39;s how we faced it. <br/>

I welcomed it myself, and my grandmother was way better about sharing her<br/>
last days than my parents were.  Of course I was 16, and I think that was<br/>
the right age for me because I didn&#39;t handle death well at all when I was<br/>
younger (usually I was completely baffled and overwhelmed by it).  I think<br/>
the big reason is my grandmother really matters/ed to me... she herself.  I<br/>
wanted to be part of easing her passing (if I could) and I stepped up to the<br/>
task of staying with her in the last few months.  Wouldn&#39;t have wanted to<br/>
miss that chance for the world.  I got to know her so much more.  And I have<br/>
that still today.  Hey my parents could have denied me that and I&#39;m glad<br/>
they didn&#39;t.  It was a formative (pivotal) experience for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460809637">Some of you have heard this story before, but it may be new to others...<br/>
<br/>
By the time my daughter Jayn was five, she had experienced the deaths of <br/>
three family members. My father-in-law had died about three years prior, his <br/>
young wife unexpectedly 18 months later, and finally my mother, called Nan, <br/>
the following January after a cancer diagnosis. Of all of these, my mother <br/>
is the person with whom Jayn had the closest relationship.<br/>
<br/>
When Grandpa Jim died I was surprised by Jayn&#39;s absolute conviction that, <br/>
even though he had gone for ever, he &quot;still loved her&quot;. Over the years she <br/>
would sometimes inform us out of the blue that she was sad that Grandpa Jim <br/>
was dead, but glad that he still loved her. When Grandma Paula died, she <br/>
maintained the same belief. This was despite a total lack of evidence of <br/>
love from Paula&#39;s behavior in life.<br/>
<br/>
When Nan became ill, Jayn, slightly older, was able to articulate her <br/>
spiritual beliefs to me in greater detail. I told Jayn truthfully that Nan <br/>
was very sick, but that we were going to visit her at Christmas. Jayn asked <br/>
if Nan would die, and was temporarily confused about when, concerned that <br/>
&quot;soon&quot; meant immediately. She had a big cry, and told me repeatedly that she <br/>
would be very sad.<br/>
<br/>
In the time leading up to our last Christmas with Nan, Jayn expressed her <br/>
idea that a person&#39;s spirit would leave their body and go into &quot;our <br/>
hearts&quot; - the hearts of the people who loved them - so that we could still <br/>
love and remember them, and they would still love us.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn prepared a special joyful dance to be her Yuletide gift to Nan, who had <br/>
been a professional dancer and singer all her life. She practiced <br/>
diligently, and had planned to do it, in a costume, on Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
However when we arrived at the house after a cross country drive, a week <br/>
before Christmas, Jayn took one look at Nan reclining in bed, then went out <br/>
and immediately took off her skirt and shoes, so that she was wearing only <br/>
her pink tights and perfectly matching top. She then asked me to put on her <br/>
chosen music and announced that she would do her dance right now. After a <br/>
few minutes getting organized, Jayn danced, adapting her exuberance to the <br/>
limited space in the bedroom. The appreciative audience was Nan, Grandpa, <br/>
one of Nan&#39;s dearest friends, Daddy and me.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, in those first few moments, Jayn knew that my mother would not be <br/>
leaving her bed again - not for any meals or to be able to watch the dance <br/>
in the living room as planned. Somehow she knew that Nan was slipping away. <br/>
In the week that followed, the decline was so swift that she would not have <br/>
even registered Jayn&#39;s presence, had we waited until December 25th. Somehow <br/>
Jayn understood before any of the adults there, that this was the last <br/>
chance she would have to give this gift to my mother, and to the rest of us.<br/>
<br/>
Some time later my step father asked me to disperse my mother&#39;s ashes in the <br/>
Pacific Ocean, as per her request. He sent us the remarkably heavy container <br/>
and James, Jayn and I went on a road trip to the coast north of Santa <br/>
Barbara, near a little town called Cambria which is precisely the kind of <br/>
sweet, pretty little artist&#39;s colony that Mum had always yearned to live in. <br/>
We first visited a ceramic shop where Jayn chose a tiny handmade porcelain <br/>
vessel with cork to keep a portion of the ashes. (These now reside in our <br/>
house in the excellent company of a bit of James Coburn and a bit of Hannah <br/>
Jenner.) It was very important to Jayn to keep a bit.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the chosen secluded beach. While we were opening the container we <br/>
were joined by a large black crow, who watched us most intently. We threw <br/>
the ashes out over the water and into the waves as they rushed onto the <br/>
sand, filming for Grandpa&#39;s sake. The ashes were very black and crystalline. <br/>
The sea took the last of them, and then the crow gave a loud squawk and flew <br/>
off. This captured Jayn&#39;s imagination at the time and seemed very fitting <br/>
somehow (although I daresay in reality it was a crow used to the idea that <br/>
people often had food with them, but then we didn&#39;t). Still the emotional <br/>
moment was enhanced by the avian witness.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn has no problem holding in her mind the idea that Nan is both in her <br/>
heart and in our house and travelling the ocean visiting all the places she <br/>
loved - Australia, Hong Kong, here, even Galveston (not that she loved it <br/>
there), Tahiti, Fiji. Every now and then she says she misses her, and I tell <br/>
her that I know Nan would have been so proud of Jayn&#39;s different doings and <br/>
achievements and would have loved to be part of them.<br/>

If I had a terminal condition that wasn&#39;t going to impact me for as long <br/>

And, it would depend on the kid,  I suppose. Rosie would live and <br/>

time. I wouldn&#39;t want five years of her life to be spent that way. Roya <br/>
is resilient and optimistic and could carry on her own life. Roxana <br/>
would carry on, but would spend a whole lot of time feeling guilty that <br/>

<br/>
I would still want my children to know. To hide it from them is not trusting them with what is real and what we are actually living with. My children knew my mother had cancer because she was open and honest about it all along. I&#39;m really thankful that was always my family&#39;s way of dealing with difficult issues.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about how she didn&#39;t want to be seen as a &quot;dying person&quot; and how we are all terminal. We talked about a lot of things openly, in a non-fearful, life-embracing manner. She was a grand example of how to live and how to die. I believe that my children were (and are) perfectly capable of navigating the journey of cancer with us.<br/>
<br/>
I always think about how *I* would feel if someone kept a fact as big as a serious illness (terminal or not) from me. Someone I don&#39;t know well is one thing, but someone I trust and share a close relationship with? That would hurt. I think it hurts children too.<br/>
<br/>
Things hidden for the sake of &quot;protecting&quot; someone often leave them feeling hurt and/or bewildered when they find out how long they were kept in the dark. I wouldn&#39;t want to be a part of that type of behavior. My family and I have navigated difficult passages more than once, we&#39;ll keep doing it together....open and honest.<br/>

- that would not be a good idea, I agree. I&#39;d thought of it as my mom <br/>
wanting the protection from immediate change in how her grandkids <br/>
interacted with her. More like giving her the gift of some time.<br/>
<br/>
I had the experience of my brother-in-law dying from leukemia. He had a <br/>
very early diagnosis of a &quot;good&quot; kind of leukemia and had a perfect bone <br/>
marrow donor available, if needed. He had a very high chance of <br/>
survival, but he died, anyway. We didn&#39;t keep any secrets about any of <br/>
it, but that was his choice.<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of a direct request from the person who is dying, it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t occur to me to keep a secret. I&#39;m just saying that I can <br/>
imagine a situation where I would delay telling them for a while, given <br/>
a direct request from the person in question. I don&#39;t know - maybe I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t feel that way if this really came up - that&#39;s the problem with <br/>
dealing in hypotheticals. I&#39;m just not going to judge someone else as <br/>
wrong who did make that decision because I can imagine how it could be <br/>
my choice, given certain circumstances.<br/>

My own objection wasn&#39;t about knowing or not knowing.  It was about a  <br/>
mother wanting to tell her own children, but feeling unable to make  <br/>
the decision because HER mother had told her not to.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Beau has medical problems, and is getting married this  <br/>
summer after living with her significant other since before I even  <br/>
knew Keith.   They&#39;ve been together 35 years, and are getting married.<br/>
<br/>
This might be because Beau is dying.   It might not be.  Beau doesn&#39;t  <br/>
have to tell me she thinks she&#39;s dying if she doesn&#39;t want to.   The  <br/>
fact that I&#39;ve had this thought makes me want to be extra sweet to her  <br/>
just in case.   She could be dead of a car accident as I write this; I  <br/>
don&#39;t know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
It makes me a better person to be nicer to Beau.  It&#39;s an investment  <br/>
in my friendship and in my future peace of mind, and my memories of a  <br/>
longtime friendship.  She was my maid of honor, 25 years ago.  I am  <br/>
most definitely going to that wedding.<br/>
<br/>
How else might we act if people in our lives were dying?  Why not just  <br/>
do it?<br/>

It could be your preference or your request, if you were dying, that  <br/>
others not share that fact.<br/>
But can it really, fairly be your &quot;choice&quot;?<br/>
<br/>

I attended my dad&#39;s funeral not with my new boyfriend, but with my not- <br/>

We didn&#39;t lie, we didn&#39;t make stories of future plans.  We withheld  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106113680">When I was younger, I didn&#39;t know what was &quot;safe&quot; to talk about re: health issues.. some members of my family felt it necessary to &quot;protect&quot; others from worry & I&#39;m not sure what they thought they were accomplishing that way. When my mom had cancer in 1980 they were reluctant to tell my grandma about it, but eventually did tell her. She cried about it & said something along the lines of &quot;of course you have to tell me!&quot; There&#39;s nothing to be gained keeping important stuff secret from people we&#39;re close to.<br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up, my dad had mental health issues & my parents weren&#39;t open about it. All I knew was for some reason he didn&#39;t feel good & we had to go home. Sometimes we were on an afternoon visit to friends, sometimes we were on a vacation. I remember one time, when I was in my 20s my parents came home early from a trip to Russia. Later on, I figured out what was going on, he had anxiety issues & probably issues w/depression as well. It was frustrating & confusing to me to ask him &quot;what&#39;s the matter?&quot; only to get &quot;I don&#39;t feel good&quot; without knowing what he MEANT by that... I even tried asking him to be more descriptive & never got anything more than &quot;I just don&#39;t feel good&quot; or &quot;I need to be in my own bed&quot; (or at home or something along those lines)...<br/>
<br/>
With my guys, we&#39;ve always been pretty open about what&#39;s going on with health issues & they saw a bit of illness and even death among our pets, as well as things that just happen...<br/>
<br/>
Their dad has problems with depression & anxiety & they more or less understand what&#39;s going on because he never really hid it.  We&#39;ve had some rough times & I don&#39;t think it would have worked to hide what was going on from them. I think it might have been helpful if my parents had been open about what was going on with my dad... stuff like this is what kids can keep in their minds if they need it.<br/>
<br/>
So rather than wondering &quot;why daddy won&#39;t go places with us very often&quot; & being annoyed about it (that&#39;s how I felt growing up), they more or less accept it & at first were annoyed by it but they&#39;re more used to it now. We&#39;re still trying to find something that works for him, so I don&#39;t have any answers/happy endings at this writing.<br/>

<br/>
So - if my mother asked, I can imagine that I might choose to honor her <br/>

saying is that the original poster DID choose to honor that request and <br/>
now thinks it was a mistake. I&#39;m saying I don&#39;t think it is necessarily <br/>

sorry she did it. She says it broke the trust between her and her <br/>

rule. Circumstances matter. How the kid would react will matter. Roya <br/>
could handle it and be extra sweet and thoughtful and see them more than <br/>

always better than another (to delay telling them for a while).<br/>
