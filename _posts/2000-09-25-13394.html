<br/>
Prominent Researcher Apologizes for Pushing<br/>
Fluoride<br/>
<br/>
by Barry Forbes<br/>
&quot;Why&#39;d you do it, Doc? Why&#39;d you toss the fluoride<br/>
folks overboard?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had just tracked down Dr. Hardy Limeback, B.Sc.,<br/>
Ph.D in Biochemistry,<br/>
D.D.S., head of the Department of Preventive Dentistry<br/>
for the University<br/>
of Toronto, and president of the Canadian Association<br/>
for Dental Research.<br/>
(Whew.)<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Limeback is Canada&#39;s leading fluoride authority<br/>
and, until recently, the<br/>
country&#39;s primary promoter of the controversial<br/>
additive. In a surprising<br/>
newsmaker interview this past April, Dr. Limeback<br/>
announced a dramatic<br/>
change of heart.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Children under three should never use fluoridated<br/>
toothpaste,&quot; he<br/>
counseled. &quot;Or drink fluoridated water. And baby<br/>
formula must never be<br/>
made up using Toronto tap water. Never.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why, I wondered? What could have caused such a<br/>
powerful paradigm shift?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s been building up for a couple of years,&quot;<br/>
Limeback told me during a<br/>
recent telephone interview. &quot;But certainly the<br/>
crowning blow was the<br/>
realization that we have been dumping contaminated<br/>
fluoride into water<br/>
reservoirs for half a century. The vast majority of<br/>
all fluoride additives come<br/>
from Tampa Bay, Florida smokestack scrubbers. The<br/>
additives are a toxic<br/>
byproduct of the super-phosphate fertilizer industry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tragically,&quot; he continued, &quot;that means we&#39;re not just<br/>
dumping toxic fluoride<br/>
into our drinking water. We&#39;re also exposing innocent,<br/>
unsuspecting people<br/>
to deadly elements of lead, arsenic and radium, all of<br/>
them carcinogenic.<br/>
Because of the cumulative properties of toxins, the<br/>
detrimental effects on<br/>
human health are catastrophic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A recent study at the University of Toronto confirmed<br/>
Dr. Limeback&#39;s worst<br/>
fears. &quot;Residents of cities that fluoridate have<br/>
double the fluoride in their hip<br/>
bones vis-a-vis the balance of the population. Worse,<br/>
we discovered that<br/>
fluoride is actually altering the basic architecture<br/>
of human bones.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Skeletal fluorosis is a debilitating condition that<br/>
occurs when fluoride<br/>
accumulates in bones, making them extremely weak and<br/>
brittle. The earliest<br/>
symptoms?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mottled and brittle teeth,&quot; Dr. Limeback told me. &quot;In<br/>
Canada we are now<br/>
spending more money treating dental fluorosis than we<br/>
do treating cavities.<br/>
That includes my own practice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of the most obvious living experiments today, Dr.<br/>
Limeback believes, is<br/>
a proof-positive comparison between any two Canadian<br/>
cities. &quot;Here in<br/>
Toronto we&#39;ve been fluoridating for 36 years. Yet<br/>
Vancouver - which has<br/>
never fluoridated - has a cavity rate lower than<br/>
Toronto&#39;s.&quot; And, he pointed<br/>
out, cavity rates are low all across the<br/>
industrialized world including Europe,<br/>
which is 98% fluoride free. Low because of improved<br/>
standards of living,<br/>
less refined sugar, regular dental checkups, flossing<br/>
and frequent brushing.<br/>
Now less than 2 cavities per child Canada-wide,&quot; he<br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t get it, Doc. Last month, the Centers for<br/>
Disease Control (CDC) ran<br/>
a puff piece all across America saying the stuff was<br/>
better than sliced bread.<br/>
What&#39;s the story?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; he replied, &quot;the CDC is basing its<br/>
position on data that is 50<br/>
years old, and questionable at best. Absolutely no one<br/>
has done research on<br/>
fluorosilicates, which is the junk they&#39;re dumping<br/>
into the drinking water.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;On the other hand,&quot; he added, &quot;the evidence against<br/>
systemic fluoride<br/>
in-take continues to pour in.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But Doc, the dentists...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have absolutely no training in toxicity,&quot; he stated<br/>
firmly. &quot;Your<br/>
well-intentioned dentist is simply following 50 years<br/>
of misinformation from<br/>
public health and the dental association. Me, too.<br/>
Unfortunately, we were<br/>
wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last week, Dr. Hardy Limeback addressed his faculty<br/>
and students at the<br/>
University of Toronto, Department of Dentistry. In a<br/>
poignant, memorable<br/>
meeting, he apologized to those gathered before him.<br/>
&quot;Speaking as the head<br/>
of preventive dentistry, I told them that I had<br/>
unintentionally mislead my<br/>
colleagues and my students. For the past 15 years, I<br/>
had refused to study the<br/>
toxicology information that is readily available to<br/>
anyone. Poisoning our<br/>
children was the furthest thing from my mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The truth,&quot; he confessed to me, &quot;was a bitter pill to<br/>
swallow, but swallow it<br/>
I did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
South of the border, the paradigm shift has yet to<br/>
dawn. After half a century<br/>
of delusion, the CDC, American Dental Association and<br/>
Public Health<br/>
stubbornly and skillfully continue to manipulate<br/>
public opinion in favor of<br/>
fluoridation. Meantime, study after study is<br/>
delivering the death knell of the<br/>
deadly toxin. Sure, fluoridation will be around for a<br/>
long time yet, but<br/>
ultimately its supporters need to ready the life<br/>
rafts. The poisonous waters of<br/>
doubt and confusion are bound to get choppier.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are lawsuits inevitable?&quot; I asked the good doctor.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Remember tobacco,&quot; was his short, succinct reply.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome, Dr. Hardy Limeback, to the far side of the<br/>
fluoride equation. It&#39;s<br/>
lonely over here, but in our society loneliness and<br/>
truth frequently travel<br/>
hand in hand. Thank you for the undeniable courage of<br/>
your convictions.<br/>

Funny you should post this now. I just stopped using flouride because I<br/>
found out I&#39;m allergic to it.<br/>

I don&#39;t have references for this particular article but there is tons of stuff<br/>
on the internet.  Go to Askjeeves.com and put  in fluroide.  It will come up<br/>
with several links. Also you can go to saveteeth.org or .com can&#39;t remember/<br/>
this is my dentist, he is awesome and has written an incredible book that<br/>
everyone IMO should read.<br/>
