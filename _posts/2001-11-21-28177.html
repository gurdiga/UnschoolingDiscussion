<div id="ygrps-yiv-143805555">OK, i realize i am entering this topic late, but i have to interject. i have <br/>
written this over several times, and i considered not sending it but i feel <br/>
its importance.<br/>
i have a wonderful 3 year old son. he is PDD which stands for Pervasive <br/>
Developmental Delay. It is a disorder on the autism spectrum if that helps <br/>
you visualize.<br/>
my Niko is a wonderful, non-verbal, child. he can&#39;t tell you dairy hurts. he <br/>
craves milk and all dairy. he would eat it 24/7 if he was given the chance.  <br/>
when dairy is removed from his diet, you would never even believe he was <br/>
autistic, yet one tiny infraction and anyone can tell immediately! if he has <br/>
any, even that tiny bit that well meaning loved ones give on the sly,  he <br/>
will withdraw from society. he becomes a whiny, crying, bloated and gassy, <br/>
miserable child. He tantrums (do you blame him, it hurts). this poisoned <br/>
child!! (see below for reasoning on that one) who is looked at by others as a <br/>
typical *terrible* 3&#39;s child. if you did not know his dietary intervention <br/>
you could possibly believe the transformation was willful. he is far from <br/>
willful!! he is the most easygoing person i have ever met.<br/>
 is  he allergic according to the true definition?<br/>
 no.<br/>
 do i tell everyone he is allergic?<br/>
 yes.<br/>
 for the simple reason, that when i sit and explain that dairy causes a <br/>
chemical imbalance in him because of a lacking enzyme in his body, and it <br/>
will cause him to &quot;trip&quot; as if on LSD and he will be a monster for several <br/>
days after that one tiny cookie/chocolate/treat that person will invariably <br/>
say &quot;so you mean he is allergic&quot; after shaking their head at my verbiage. and <br/>
of course they think IM nuts. <br/>
<br/>
as far as what i expect others to do if taking care of him, it is not the <br/>
easiest thing to do to send him out with his own snacks. (you would not <br/>
believe how many things have hidden dry milk as an ingredient listed as <br/>
something else. casin, lecithin.. etc.) but i do not expect everyone to read <br/>
all labels and make as many phone calls to manufacturers as i do. so he goes <br/>
with snacks, and I ask who is in charge to make sure he is not drinking or <br/>
eating anything he is not given by me.  sorry for this long winded reply, but <br/>
the statement that you gave a child milk and he had no reaction shows me that <br/>
you were not really listening to this Mom.                     once admitted <br/>
to someone that Niko was not really allergic, tried to explain, but she heard <br/>
&quot;not allergic really&quot; and she gave him some ice cream.  he was fine for <br/>
several hours, and she may have thought that i was a liar. however, he did <br/>
not  sleep for a week and neither did I. <br/>

&gt; Final episode on this topic for me, Sandra is of course wanted to share <br/>
&gt; her thoughts as well. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to be respectful, but I am not always that bright. I do <br/>
&gt; want her to be herself, and I hope she can see that sometimes<br/>
&gt; what seems like an argument, can really be two people who agree on the <br/>
&gt; basics, but not always the terminology. We both want<br/>
&gt; thoughtful caring adults to raise independent healthy children. We <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t like hypocrites, control freaks, or labeling people (yes<br/>
&gt; joke). We want our kids to learn to make their own decisions, and for <br/>
&gt; them to decide what&#39;s best for themselves. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; here goes. I am again the K, and Sandra will be played by the letter S. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; How is &#39;no personal experience&quot; true?  Because I don&#39;t have a <br/>
&gt; child with <br/>
&gt; &gt; allergies?&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- I think that is the definition I was thinking of. Also that you have <br/>
&gt; not mentioned any personal (as in you personally) experience with food <br/>
&gt; reactions of your own. I am happy that you don&#39;t have to put up with <br/>
&gt; any of it and are free. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Your 2 cents worth of experiences with liars and control freaks then <br/>
&gt; falls ito the category of heresay, which seemed to merely echo <br/>
&gt; society&#39;s claim that it is all hogwash. You granted the some are real <br/>
&gt; and some are not. That is true of anything, yet it makes the people in <br/>
&gt; the middle even more suspicious that we just make it all up. Perhaps <br/>
&gt; research on the subject would give you more insight into the problem. I <br/>
&gt; enjoyed the book &quot;Is This Your Child&quot; by Doris Rapp. There are others, <br/>
&gt; but this is a good start.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-Saying something &quot;loudly and with feeling&quot; might be <br/>
&gt; &gt; asking for help, information or support, but I don&#39;t think ridicule <br/>
&gt; &gt; is a helpful path.-=- <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t ridicule them,&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not to their face then, just on a list of 600 strangers. Of course that <br/>
&gt; was gratuitous and rude of me. Sorry. Not sorry enough to<br/>
&gt; delete it though. My bad. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;k -=-Did you lie to her and say you would follow, or had followed, her <br/>
&gt; &gt; instructions? -=- <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; No.  (That could only be asked by someone who doesn&#39;t know me very <br/>
&gt; well!) <br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t say a word.&quot; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- That is called lying by omission. Of course I have never lied, <br/>
&gt; except just then. My bad, again. (pretending it&#39;s humor is no<br/>
&gt; excuse for my rudeness) <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-OK too many maybes for this instance, but I say the <br/>
&gt; &gt; decision was not yours to make.-=- <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; What decision?  To take the mom&#39;s word that she was a liar? <br/>
&gt; &gt; To keep  her son for free?&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- Your decision to ignore her wishes because you thought she was <br/>
&gt; wrong. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; k-=- I would be helpful for others to <br/>
&gt; &gt; keep an open mind that it could be real. -=- <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; It&#39;s all real. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Some allergies are more real than others.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then how is it all real if some of it is not? The confusion may be <br/>
&gt; real, the searching for answers. It&#39;s hard to remember that most<br/>
&gt; people are just trying their best with what they&#39;ve learned so far. <br/>
&gt; Helping is more useful than judgment. I know that people don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; always want help, but saying what works for us has given other people <br/>
&gt; freedom to consider new possibilities. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; k&quot;-=-Many parents have said that their allergic kids feel deprived and <br/>
&gt; &gt; binge, others say their kids understand and feel good about taking <br/>
&gt; &gt; care <br/>
&gt; &gt; of themselves. The bingeing may have more to do with addiction than <br/>
&gt; &gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; social deprivation. -=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; By this logic, any teen or adult who rejects the parental <br/>
&gt; restrictions when <br/>
&gt; &gt; freedom hits and goes ahead and eats wheat or sugar has proven the parent <br/>
&gt; &gt; right!  The child WAS an addict, proving that by not continuing the food <br/>
&gt; ban <br/>
&gt; &gt; for life?&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- What if the parent was right? What if the parent was wrong? If they <br/>
&gt; were right the child may bee in good physical health and really notice <br/>
&gt; that the binge made them ill. If they were wrong the child could learn <br/>
&gt; that it was not a problem after all. I guess you&#39;re upset that the <br/>
&gt; child lost all those years of making their own decisions. I agree with <br/>
&gt; that, yet I feel conflict about health and freedom. I don&#39;t think they <br/>
&gt; have to be mutually exclusive, yet I am sure the balance is possible.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are you disagreeing with the idea of addiction? I don&#39;t really know <br/>
&gt; what I think of addiction. I am still asking lots of<br/>
&gt; questions. There are so many other issues that come up when anyone <br/>
&gt; talks about binge foods- self control, will power, stress,<br/>
&gt; social pressure. They are related but how can people stop binges? <br/>
&gt; Someone here said that they kept some of the foods in the<br/>
&gt; house and that stopped the bingeing at friends&#39; houses. So far for us, <br/>
&gt; we just binge here instead if I do buy the foods. I am not<br/>
&gt; trying to fight with anyone. I am really asking 600 people if they have <br/>
&gt; any other thoughts on the subject besides that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; happen to sensible people. This is not a food disorders list, I know <br/>
&gt; that. It is a list of curious people though, who don&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; follow society&#39;s line, and do find their own answers. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-Why are the things that are the worst <br/>
&gt; &gt; for us considered treats?-=- <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s true.  There are traditional seasonal or <br/>
&gt; holiday <br/>
&gt; &gt; foods that are not the worst-for-us foods.  It&#39;s rarity that makes a <br/>
&gt; treat, <br/>
&gt; &gt; not bodily damage.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess I am using the word treat the way I hear it used most often. <br/>
&gt; &quot;Treat yourself to dessert (daily), have a treat at the store (candy), <br/>
&gt; buy a treat at the movies&quot;, all over the place every day, as if you&#39;re <br/>
&gt; not normal if you avoid that stuff. If treat only meant rarity that <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t be a problem. It&#39;s the on going bombardment of junk foods at <br/>
&gt; every house,<br/>
&gt; halloween/easter/christmas/valentine&#39;s candy that is passed out all <br/>
&gt; over the place, the high fat/sugar/salt diet that is most people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; idea if regular food. The idea that to avoid this kind of food is <br/>
&gt; unnatural and bad. I&#39;m trying to keep the kids healthy enough to<br/>
&gt; learn the difference. If you&#39;re constantly in a drugged state, you <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t notice it, but if you are fine until you have the cake and ice<br/>
&gt; cream, you&#39;ll learn the connection. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; Without options, a child cannot learn to &quot;develop their own <br/>
&gt; choices.&quot;  If the <br/>
&gt; &gt; foods are highly restricted, some children will choose to be sneaky or <br/>
&gt; eat <br/>
&gt; &gt; elsewhere.  They can&#39;t choose fruit over cake if there was no cake <br/>
&gt; available.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- I guess that I don&#39;t highly restrict foods. I don&#39;t buy things that <br/>
&gt; are junk because they&#39;re just not food. They are treats that can<br/>
&gt; be had once in awhile, but not every day, every week. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids turn down junk sometimes, or just have a little. Not because <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m hovering over them with a whip, but because they eat<br/>
&gt; whatever they want most of the time. I haven&#39;t made any food evil or <br/>
&gt; forbidden, just I try not to buy stuff that makes us sick. Is<br/>
&gt; that nuts? I really am still learning about all this food stuff. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you or your own children have never binged, how do you know what&#39;s <br/>
&gt; the right thing to do about it? I don&#39;t know myself. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; A child can&#39;t clean his room by his own choice (as Marty did a few <br/>
&gt; weeks <br/>
&gt; &gt; back--big reorganization) if room cleaning is mandated.  If it is <br/>
&gt; mandated on <br/>
&gt; &gt; a schedule, the child can ONLY &quot;choose&quot; by choosing not to cooperate. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My husband&#39;s family of origin set up that kind of &quot;choice&quot;--the &quot;my way <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; the highway&quot; scenario.   We have in full knowledge of our intent set out <br/>
&gt; &gt; never to do that to our kids.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;K-&quot; -=-I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the <br/>
&gt; &gt; child is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first, <br/>
&gt; &gt; then gradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the kid. <br/>
&gt; -=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; My mother in law still tells adults just what to do and how, and <br/>
&gt; chortles <br/>
&gt; &gt; derisively at anything except &quot;Okay!  right now! Thanks!.&quot;   A notable <br/>
&gt; &gt; quote--Kirby was five days or so old when she came to see him, and I <br/>
&gt; asked if <br/>
&gt; &gt; she wanted to change his diaper (I thought it was a generous, friendly <br/>
&gt; thing <br/>
&gt; &gt; to offer; she had been a nurse and the mother of three boys).  She came <br/>
&gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; and said bruskly with no eye contact &quot;You have to get him circumcised.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; (And don&#39;t bother to ask if I lied and said I would.)&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- I agree that some people (nosey relatives) are not moved by <br/>
&gt; arguments that you are doing the right thing by your best<br/>
&gt; available knowledge. Sometimes I just say that (whatever) is working <br/>
&gt; well for us and we&#39;re happy thanks. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;k-&quot; -=-I say the lucky parent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will <br/>
&gt; raise a more <br/>
&gt; &gt; responsible happier person.-=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; She was sure that her children truly needed to do what she said <br/>
&gt; without <br/>
&gt; &gt; hestitation or question until they were out of her house.  Guess how <br/>
&gt; quickly <br/>
&gt; &gt; they were all out of her house?  Navy, run-away, college in another <br/>
&gt; city.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- You snipped away the part where I said what I thought a few of a <br/>
&gt; child&#39;s true needs are. Self control, mutual respect,<br/>
&gt; accomplishment. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Actually the Navy sounds like another place for someone to be expected <br/>
&gt; to do what they&#39;re told without hesitation or question.<br/>
&gt; Ironic. A very challenging career is the military. Many people excel <br/>
&gt; and serve with honors, and learn very useful skills. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;k&quot; -=-Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free <br/>
&gt; &gt; to choose to avoid them, and to ask that any caregiver follow that <br/>
&gt; &gt; choice also. If you are not comfortable with that, then the honest thing <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; do is to decline to watch the kid.-=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; I&#39;ve had kids come to visit who, AFTER the parent has left says <br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;m not allow <br/>
&gt; &gt; ed to watch TV,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not allowed to play with weapons&quot; or whatever. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Fine!  They can, themselves, avoid such things.  But other than telling <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; kids it would be nice if they did something else, I have never said &quot;OKAY <br/>
&gt; &gt; THEN!  TV ban for everyone!&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- Why not? Is TV sacred? I don&#39;t think TV is evil. Maybe the parent <br/>
&gt; meant no violent power rangers stuff, or that they wanted<br/>
&gt; them to play instead of veg. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess that you don&#39;t want to deprive anybody, or to make your kids <br/>
&gt; dread his visit. It&#39;s hard to know when to respect another<br/>
&gt; parent&#39;s wishes or not. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; If parents want to leave their children at my house but they don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; like my <br/>
&gt; &gt; rules (and I&#39;m not talking about peanuts) they shouldn&#39;t leave them <br/>
&gt; there.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- Maybe they aren&#39;t aware of that your rules come before theirs, or <br/>
&gt; that there&#39;s any difference. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; If I took money to watch other people&#39;s kids then I&#39;d negotiate.  <br/>
&gt; But there&#39;s <br/>
&gt; &gt; not enough money in the world to get me to lie to kids and say &quot;You can&#39;t <br/>
&gt; &gt; have this because it&#39;s bad for you&quot; if I don&#39;t believe it.  There&#39;s not <br/>
&gt; &gt; enough money to get me to control other people&#39;s kids arbitrarily just <br/>
&gt; &gt; because the parents would like to do it but they want to go and do <br/>
&gt; something <br/>
&gt; &gt; else for a while.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- Then you would not negotiate. Money has nothing to do with it. They <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t owe you anything if you agreed to watch the kids<br/>
&gt; for free. It doesn&#39;t make you better than them. If you don&#39;t like their <br/>
&gt; restrictions on their kids, maybe you can help nurture the<br/>
&gt; kids in other ways. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;k-&quot; I think that as curious <br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschoolers all topics can be up for discussion as they relate to <br/>
&gt; &gt; life, science, health, and personal empowerment through healthy <br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion.-=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; I&#39;m thinking some people might be suffering a bad reaction to the <br/>
&gt; discussion. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Who decides if it&#39;s healthy?&quot;&quot; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- I would imagine that if anyone is suffering a bad reaction to this <br/>
&gt; discussion they are free to say so. That&#39;s the healthy part. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; It seemed to me that the tone of the suggestion was more that <br/>
&gt; those who allow <br/>
&gt; &gt; their children freedom (not just of food) are neglectful, but those who <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt; &gt; being controlling are being responsible.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- My original post was about parents of children with allergies, not <br/>
&gt; all parents. I think that all parents, with or without allergies,<br/>
&gt; allow as much freedom as they think is safe. I hope like you do that <br/>
&gt; they will base their judgments on their own children&#39;s&#39; needs<br/>
&gt; and abilities, not on the fears or failings of the adult. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; S-&quot;&gt; Maybe there should be an unschooling with allergies list.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we are free to make one. I also think it is not necessary to <br/>
&gt; push a topic off to a separate list right away. Many things are<br/>
&gt; discussed here, even the weather. I will not keep beating this though. <br/>
&gt; The question is out there, any replies would be interesting,<br/>
&gt; but I will not ask it again. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; k &quot;-=-You are free to say that you feel allergies are just an <br/>
&gt; &gt; excuse <br/>
&gt; &gt; for poor parenting and restricting freedom, and I am free to suggest <br/>
&gt; &gt; that they could be real for some, and for everyone to do their own <br/>
&gt; &gt; research.-=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S- &quot;&gt; YES but I didn&#39;t say that.  So you&#39;ve paraphrased me wrongly and <br/>
&gt; addressed <br/>
&gt; &gt; that.  It&#39;s called attacking a straw man.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- I&#39;ve addressed everything else point by point, in exhausting detail <br/>
&gt; to both of your posts. Sorry that I chucked all my feelings<br/>
&gt; together into the straw man. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; K- &quot;-=-I guess you could live in a remote hut completely free of any <br/>
&gt; social <br/>
&gt; &gt; ties, or restrictions on your freedom. <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-I would miss you if you lived in a hut.-=-&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S- &quot;&gt; How can you tell who lives in remote huts and who doesn&#39;t by e-<br/>
&gt; mail?&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- I can tell by the content that you are not alone in a hut with a <br/>
&gt; satellite connection. No one who writes to as many posts as you do has <br/>
&gt; any desire to be alone.<br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; S- &quot;&gt; I&#39;m not free of social ties, and I arrange for my kids to have a <br/>
&gt; lot of <br/>
&gt; &gt; freedom.  Free to come or go, they stay here and their friends do, <br/>
&gt; too.Free <br/>
&gt; &gt; to go to school or not, they don&#39;t.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- I am curious, would you send your kids to school if they begged? How <br/>
&gt; old are they. What have you told them about school<br/>
&gt; that could influence their decision. I have told my kids when they <br/>
&gt; asked how I felt about my time at school. That may have<br/>
&gt; influenced them some, for better or worse. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; S- &quot;Free to eat what they want, they eat an <br/>
&gt; &gt; amazingly balanced diet.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- Do they shop with you and help plan the meals? I think that is <br/>
&gt; important to have freedom of choice. Do you cook or do they?<br/>
&gt; Do you all sit down for one meal a day? We do sometimes. Do you take <br/>
&gt; turns planning the meals, or do you just graze. We graze<br/>
&gt; alot. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; S- &quot;Free to stay up or sleep, they sleep every single <br/>
&gt; &gt; night.&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- Again I think that could depend on the age. Mine are still too <br/>
&gt; little to be up without me. We all sleep together though, so<br/>
&gt; bedtime is a nice cozy thing. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-S-&quot;&gt; Nobody&#39;s going to scrape peanut butter, or an idea, off their <br/>
&gt; &gt; keyboard and die.  (Or if they do, the peanut butter will not have <br/>
&gt; arrived by <br/>
&gt; &gt; e-mail.) <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sandra&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-K- Now that&#39;s just thoughtless. In an earlier post someone said that <br/>
&gt; &gt; they admired that you &quot;wrote from the soul&quot;. I would like to see some <br/>
&gt; &gt; of that.-=- <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; S- &quot;&gt; It wasn&#39;t thoughtless in any way.  If you haven&#39;t &quot;seen some of <br/>
&gt; that,&quot; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t know my writing well enough to decide whether it&#39;s &quot;from the soul&quot; <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; not.   And you will never know my voice well enough to be the judge of <br/>
&gt; &gt; whether I was sincere or thoughtful. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Assume I&#39;m sincere and thoughtful, and if you&#39;re too bothered by the <br/>
&gt; writing, <br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t read it.  I don&#39;t want to stop writing because it&#39;s disturbing two <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; three of several hundred people. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Sandra&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; K- Agreed. We will both assume that we&#39;re sincere and thoughtful. I <br/>
&gt; thought that you could tell by my detailed posts that I thought<br/>
&gt; you were already. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course you will not stop writing, I&#39;m sure that has not been <br/>
&gt; requested. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I did expect that making a joke about people dying from peanut butter <br/>
&gt; on the keyboard would be thought of as unfeeling before<br/>
&gt; you sent it. That is what I meant about thoughtless. I am being too <br/>
&gt; literal for most, but it isn&#39;t a joke really. I suppose I have no<br/>
&gt; sense of humor for that kind of humor. It wasn&#39;t a joke about really <br/>
&gt; dying of course, but it was an &quot;I don&#39;t care about any whiny<br/>
&gt; problems because they exaggerate everything&quot; type of feeling. If that <br/>
&gt; was not your intent, then my apologies. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For all my verbosity it may be hard to imagine that I am quite new to <br/>
&gt; this list. I have only been on for a couple of weeks I think. I<br/>
&gt; admit that I haven&#39;t followed enough of your posts on other topics to <br/>
&gt; know your writing well at all. All I know is what I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; in your replies to my post. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Every list has its personalities, occasional posters, and lurkers. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am interested in responses from others as well, but I fear they are <br/>
&gt; not interested in this continuing saga, and I have put them<br/>
&gt; off. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And so ends the Kathy show. We now return you to your regularly <br/>
&gt; scheduled programs, with the occasional weather report. <br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] the &#39;not so allergic&#39; child....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; OK, i realize i am entering this topic late, but i have to interject. i<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; written this over several times, and i considered not sending it but i<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; its importance.<br/>
&gt; i have a wonderful 3 year old son. he is PDD which stands for Pervasive<br/>
&gt; Developmental Delay. It is a disorder on the autism spectrum if that helps<br/>
&gt; you visualize.<br/>
&gt; my Niko is a wonderful, non-verbal, child. he can&#39;t tell you dairy hurts.<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; craves milk and all dairy. he would eat it 24/7 if he was given the<br/>
chance.<br/>
&gt; when dairy is removed from his diet, you would never even believe he was<br/>
&gt; autistic, yet one tiny infraction and anyone can tell immediately! if he<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; any, even that tiny bit that well meaning loved ones give on the sly,  he<br/>
&gt; will withdraw from society. he becomes a whiny, crying, bloated and gassy,<br/>
&gt; miserable child. He tantrums (do you blame him, it hurts). this poisoned<br/>
&gt; child!! (see below for reasoning on that one) who is looked at by others<br/>
as a<br/>
&gt; typical *terrible* 3&#39;s child. if you did not know his dietary intervention<br/>
&gt; you could possibly believe the transformation was willful. he is far from<br/>
&gt; willful!! he is the most easygoing person i have ever met.<br/>
&gt;  is  he allergic according to the true definition?<br/>
&gt;  no.<br/>
&gt;  do i tell everyone he is allergic?<br/>
&gt;  yes.<br/>
&gt;  for the simple reason, that when i sit and explain that dairy causes a<br/>
&gt; chemical imbalance in him because of a lacking enzyme in his body, and it<br/>
&gt; will cause him to &quot;trip&quot; as if on LSD and he will be a monster for several<br/>
&gt; days after that one tiny cookie/chocolate/treat that person will invariabl<br/>
y<br/>
&gt; say &quot;so you mean he is allergic&quot; after shaking their head at my verbiage.<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; of course they think IM nuts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; as far as what i expect others to do if taking care of him, it is not the<br/>
&gt; easiest thing to do to send him out with his own snacks. (you would not<br/>
&gt; believe how many things have hidden dry milk as an ingredient listed as<br/>
&gt; something else. casin, lecithin.. etc.) but i do not expect everyone to<br/>
read<br/>
&gt; all labels and make as many phone calls to manufacturers as i do. so he<br/>
goes<br/>
&gt; with snacks, and I ask who is in charge to make sure he is not drinking or<br/>
&gt; eating anything he is not given by me.  sorry for this long winded reply,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; the statement that you gave a child milk and he had no reaction shows me<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; you were not really listening to this Mom.                     once<br/>
admitted<br/>
&gt; to someone that Niko was not really allergic, tried to explain, but she<br/>
heard<br/>
&gt; &quot;not allergic really&quot; and she gave him some ice cream.  he was fine for<br/>
&gt; several hours, and she may have thought that i was a liar. however, he did<br/>
&gt; not  sleep for a week and neither did I.<br/>
&gt; Joy<br/>
&gt; Mom to<br/>
&gt; Andrew  11/29/94 too smart for me to keep up with<br/>
&gt; Anastasia  8/8/96 the princess!!<br/>
&gt; Nicholas 6/21/98 my PDD child who loves to make me smile!!<br/>
&gt; Michael 6/21/00 such an imp you ever saw<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Final episode on this topic for me, Sandra is of course wanted to share<br/>
&gt; &gt; her thoughts as well.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would like to be respectful, but I am not always that bright. I do<br/>
&gt; &gt; want her to be herself, and I hope she can see that sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt; what seems like an argument, can really be two people who agree on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; basics, but not always the terminology. We both want<br/>
&gt; &gt; thoughtful caring adults to raise independent healthy children. We<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t like hypocrites, control freaks, or labeling people (yes<br/>
&gt; &gt; joke). We want our kids to learn to make their own decisions, and for<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to decide what&#39;s best for themselves.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; here goes. I am again the K, and Sandra will be played by the letter S.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; How is &#39;no personal experience&quot; true?  Because I don&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; child with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; allergies?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- I think that is the definition I was thinking of. Also that you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; not mentioned any personal (as in you personally) experience with food<br/>
&gt; &gt; reactions of your own. I am happy that you don&#39;t have to put up with<br/>
&gt; &gt; any of it and are free.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Your 2 cents worth of experiences with liars and control freaks then<br/>
&gt; &gt; falls ito the category of heresay, which seemed to merely echo<br/>
&gt; &gt; society&#39;s claim that it is all hogwash. You granted the some are real<br/>
&gt; &gt; and some are not. That is true of anything, yet it makes the people in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the middle even more suspicious that we just make it all up. Perhaps<br/>
&gt; &gt; research on the subject would give you more insight into the problem. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; enjoyed the book &quot;Is This Your Child&quot; by Doris Rapp. There are others,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but this is a good start.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-Saying something &quot;loudly and with feeling&quot; might be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; asking for help, information or support, but I don&#39;t think ridicule<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is a helpful path.-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t ridicule them,&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not to their face then, just on a list of 600 strangers. Of course that<br/>
&gt; &gt; was gratuitous and rude of me. Sorry. Not sorry enough to<br/>
&gt; &gt; delete it though. My bad.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;k -=-Did you lie to her and say you would follow, or had followed, her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions? -=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; No.  (That could only be asked by someone who doesn&#39;t know me very<br/>
&gt; &gt; well!)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t say a word.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- That is called lying by omission. Of course I have never lied,<br/>
&gt; &gt; except just then. My bad, again. (pretending it&#39;s humor is no<br/>
&gt; &gt; excuse for my rudeness)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-OK too many maybes for this instance, but I say the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decision was not yours to make.-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; What decision?  To take the mom&#39;s word that she was a liar?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To keep  her son for free?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- Your decision to ignore her wishes because you thought she was<br/>
&gt; &gt; wrong.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; k-=- I would be helpful for others to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; keep an open mind that it could be real. -=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; It&#39;s all real.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Some allergies are more real than others.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then how is it all real if some of it is not? The confusion may be<br/>
&gt; &gt; real, the searching for answers. It&#39;s hard to remember that most<br/>
&gt; &gt; people are just trying their best with what they&#39;ve learned so far.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Helping is more useful than judgment. I know that people don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; always want help, but saying what works for us has given other people<br/>
&gt; &gt; freedom to consider new possibilities.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; k&quot;-=-Many parents have said that their allergic kids feel deprived and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; binge, others say their kids understand and feel good about taking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; care<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of themselves. The bingeing may have more to do with addiction than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; social deprivation. -=-&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; By this logic, any teen or adult who rejects the parental<br/>
&gt; &gt; restrictions when<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; freedom hits and goes ahead and eats wheat or sugar has proven the<br/>
parent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; right!  The child WAS an addict, proving that by not continuing the<br/>
food<br/>
&gt; &gt; ban<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for life?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- What if the parent was right? What if the parent was wrong? If they<br/>
&gt; &gt; were right the child may bee in good physical health and really notice<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the binge made them ill. If they were wrong the child could learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; that it was not a problem after all. I guess you&#39;re upset that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; child lost all those years of making their own decisions. I agree with<br/>
&gt; &gt; that, yet I feel conflict about health and freedom. I don&#39;t think they<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to be mutually exclusive, yet I am sure the balance is possible.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Are you disagreeing with the idea of addiction? I don&#39;t really know<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I think of addiction. I am still asking lots of<br/>
&gt; &gt; questions. There are so many other issues that come up when anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; talks about binge foods- self control, will power, stress,<br/>
&gt; &gt; social pressure. They are related but how can people stop binges?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Someone here said that they kept some of the foods in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; house and that stopped the bingeing at friends&#39; houses. So far for us,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we just binge here instead if I do buy the foods. I am not<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to fight with anyone. I am really asking 600 people if they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; any other thoughts on the subject besides that it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; happen to sensible people. This is not a food disorders list, I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; that. It is a list of curious people though, who don&#39;t always<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow society&#39;s line, and do find their own answers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-Why are the things that are the worst<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for us considered treats?-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s true.  There are traditional seasonal or<br/>
&gt; &gt; holiday<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foods that are not the worst-for-us foods.  It&#39;s rarity that makes a<br/>
&gt; &gt; treat,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not bodily damage.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess I am using the word treat the way I hear it used most often.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Treat yourself to dessert (daily), have a treat at the store (candy),<br/>
&gt; &gt; buy a treat at the movies&quot;, all over the place every day, as if you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; not normal if you avoid that stuff. If treat only meant rarity that<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn&#39;t be a problem. It&#39;s the on going bombardment of junk foods at<br/>
&gt; &gt; every house,<br/>
&gt; &gt; halloween/easter/christmas/valentine&#39;s candy that is passed out all<br/>
&gt; &gt; over the place, the high fat/sugar/salt diet that is most people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; idea if regular food. The idea that to avoid this kind of food is<br/>
&gt; &gt; unnatural and bad. I&#39;m trying to keep the kids healthy enough to<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn the difference. If you&#39;re constantly in a drugged state, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; won&#39;t notice it, but if you are fine until you have the cake and ice<br/>
&gt; &gt; cream, you&#39;ll learn the connection.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; Without options, a child cannot learn to &quot;develop their own<br/>
&gt; &gt; choices.&quot;  If the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foods are highly restricted, some children will choose to be sneaky or<br/>
&gt; &gt; eat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; elsewhere.  They can&#39;t choose fruit over cake if there was no cake<br/>
&gt; &gt; available.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- I guess that I don&#39;t highly restrict foods. I don&#39;t buy things that<br/>
&gt; &gt; are junk because they&#39;re just not food. They are treats that can<br/>
&gt; &gt; be had once in awhile, but not every day, every week.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My kids turn down junk sometimes, or just have a little. Not because<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m hovering over them with a whip, but because they eat<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever they want most of the time. I haven&#39;t made any food evil or<br/>
&gt; &gt; forbidden, just I try not to buy stuff that makes us sick. Is<br/>
&gt; &gt; that nuts? I really am still learning about all this food stuff.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you or your own children have never binged, how do you know what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; the right thing to do about it? I don&#39;t know myself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; A child can&#39;t clean his room by his own choice (as Marty did a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; weeks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back--big reorganization) if room cleaning is mandated.  If it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; mandated on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a schedule, the child can ONLY &quot;choose&quot; by choosing not to cooperate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My husband&#39;s family of origin set up that kind of &quot;choice&quot;--the &quot;my<br/>
way<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the highway&quot; scenario.   We have in full knowledge of our intent set<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; never to do that to our kids.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;K-&quot; -=-I think that the best person to determine what freedoms the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; child is ready for is the observant responsive guardian at first,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; then gradually as the kid gets more real experience it shifts to the<br/>
kid.<br/>
&gt; &gt; -=-&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; My mother in law still tells adults just what to do and how, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; chortles<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; derisively at anything except &quot;Okay!  right now! Thanks!.&quot;   A notable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; quote--Kirby was five days or so old when she came to see him, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; asked if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; she wanted to change his diaper (I thought it was a generous, friendly<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to offer; she had been a nurse and the mother of three boys).  She<br/>
came<br/>
&gt; &gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and said bruskly with no eye contact &quot;You have to get him<br/>
circumcised.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (And don&#39;t bother to ask if I lied and said I would.)&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- I agree that some people (nosey relatives) are not moved by<br/>
&gt; &gt; arguments that you are doing the right thing by your best<br/>
&gt; &gt; available knowledge. Sometimes I just say that (whatever) is working<br/>
&gt; &gt; well for us and we&#39;re happy thanks.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;k-&quot; -=-I say the lucky parent who follows the child&#39;s true needs will<br/>
&gt; &gt; raise a more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsible happier person.-=-&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; She was sure that her children truly needed to do what she said<br/>
&gt; &gt; without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hestitation or question until they were out of her house.  Guess how<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they were all out of her house?  Navy, run-away, college in another<br/>
&gt; &gt; city.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- You snipped away the part where I said what I thought a few of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; child&#39;s true needs are. Self control, mutual respect,<br/>
&gt; &gt; accomplishment.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually the Navy sounds like another place for someone to be expected<br/>
&gt; &gt; to do what they&#39;re told without hesitation or question.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ironic. A very challenging career is the military. Many people excel<br/>
&gt; &gt; and serve with honors, and learn very useful skills.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;k&quot; -=-Anyone who experiences real problems with certain foods is free<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to choose to avoid them, and to ask that any caregiver follow that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; choice also. If you are not comfortable with that, then the honest<br/>
thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do is to decline to watch the kid.-=-&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; I&#39;ve had kids come to visit who, AFTER the parent has left says<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m not allow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ed to watch TV,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m not allowed to play with weapons&quot; or<br/>
whatever.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Fine!  They can, themselves, avoid such things.  But other than<br/>
telling<br/>
&gt; &gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kids it would be nice if they did something else, I have never said<br/>
&quot;OKAY<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; THEN!  TV ban for everyone!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- Why not? Is TV sacred? I don&#39;t think TV is evil. Maybe the parent<br/>
&gt; &gt; meant no violent power rangers stuff, or that they wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to play instead of veg.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess that you don&#39;t want to deprive anybody, or to make your kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; dread his visit. It&#39;s hard to know when to respect another<br/>
&gt; &gt; parent&#39;s wishes or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; If parents want to leave their children at my house but they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; like my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rules (and I&#39;m not talking about peanuts) they shouldn&#39;t leave them<br/>
&gt; &gt; there.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- Maybe they aren&#39;t aware of that your rules come before theirs, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; that there&#39;s any difference.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; If I took money to watch other people&#39;s kids then I&#39;d negotiate.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not enough money in the world to get me to lie to kids and say &quot;You<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have this because it&#39;s bad for you&quot; if I don&#39;t believe it.  There&#39;s<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough money to get me to control other people&#39;s kids arbitrarily just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because the parents would like to do it but they want to go and do<br/>
&gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; else for a while.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- Then you would not negotiate. Money has nothing to do with it. They<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t owe you anything if you agreed to watch the kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; for free. It doesn&#39;t make you better than them. If you don&#39;t like their<br/>
&gt; &gt; restrictions on their kids, maybe you can help nurture the<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids in other ways.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;k-&quot; I think that as curious<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; homeschoolers all topics can be up for discussion as they relate to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; life, science, health, and personal empowerment through healthy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion.-=-&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; I&#39;m thinking some people might be suffering a bad reaction to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Who decides if it&#39;s healthy?&quot;&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- I would imagine that if anyone is suffering a bad reaction to this<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussion they are free to say so. That&#39;s the healthy part.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; It seemed to me that the tone of the suggestion was more that<br/>
&gt; &gt; those who allow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their children freedom (not just of food) are neglectful, but those<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; being controlling are being responsible.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- My original post was about parents of children with allergies, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; all parents. I think that all parents, with or without allergies,<br/>
&gt; &gt; allow as much freedom as they think is safe. I hope like you do that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they will base their judgments on their own children&#39;s&#39; needs<br/>
&gt; &gt; and abilities, not on the fears or failings of the adult.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S-&quot;&gt; Maybe there should be an unschooling with allergies list.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think we are free to make one. I also think it is not necessary to<br/>
&gt; &gt; push a topic off to a separate list right away. Many things are<br/>
&gt; &gt; discussed here, even the weather. I will not keep beating this though.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The question is out there, any replies would be interesting,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I will not ask it again.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; k &quot;-=-You are free to say that you feel allergies are just an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; excuse<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for poor parenting and restricting freedom, and I am free to suggest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that they could be real for some, and for everyone to do their own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; research.-=-&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S- &quot;&gt; YES but I didn&#39;t say that.  So you&#39;ve paraphrased me wrongly and<br/>
&gt; &gt; addressed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that.  It&#39;s called attacking a straw man.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- I&#39;ve addressed everything else point by point, in exhausting detail<br/>
&gt; &gt; to both of your posts. Sorry that I chucked all my feelings<br/>
&gt; &gt; together into the straw man.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; K- &quot;-=-I guess you could live in a remote hut completely free of any<br/>
&gt; &gt; social<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ties, or restrictions on your freedom.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-I would miss you if you lived in a hut.-=-&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S- &quot;&gt; How can you tell who lives in remote huts and who doesn&#39;t by e-<br/>
&gt; &gt; mail?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- I can tell by the content that you are not alone in a hut with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; satellite connection. No one who writes to as many posts as you do has<br/>
&gt; &gt; any desire to be alone.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S- &quot;&gt; I&#39;m not free of social ties, and I arrange for my kids to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; freedom.  Free to come or go, they stay here and their friends do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; too.Free<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to go to school or not, they don&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- I am curious, would you send your kids to school if they begged? How<br/>
&gt; &gt; old are they. What have you told them about school<br/>
&gt; &gt; that could influence their decision. I have told my kids when they<br/>
&gt; &gt; asked how I felt about my time at school. That may have<br/>
&gt; &gt; influenced them some, for better or worse.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S- &quot;Free to eat what they want, they eat an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; amazingly balanced diet.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- Do they shop with you and help plan the meals? I think that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; important to have freedom of choice. Do you cook or do they?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Do you all sit down for one meal a day? We do sometimes. Do you take<br/>
&gt; &gt; turns planning the meals, or do you just graze. We graze<br/>
&gt; &gt; alot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S- &quot;Free to stay up or sleep, they sleep every single<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; night.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- Again I think that could depend on the age. Mine are still too<br/>
&gt; &gt; little to be up without me. We all sleep together though, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; bedtime is a nice cozy thing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-S-&quot;&gt; Nobody&#39;s going to scrape peanut butter, or an idea, off their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; keyboard and die.  (Or if they do, the peanut butter will not have<br/>
&gt; &gt; arrived by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; e-mail.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sandra&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-K- Now that&#39;s just thoughtless. In an earlier post someone said<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they admired that you &quot;wrote from the soul&quot;. I would like to see some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of that.-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; S- &quot;&gt; It wasn&#39;t thoughtless in any way.  If you haven&#39;t &quot;seen some of<br/>
&gt; &gt; that,&quot; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t know my writing well enough to decide whether it&#39;s &quot;from the<br/>
soul&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not.   And you will never know my voice well enough to be the judge of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whether I was sincere or thoughtful.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Assume I&#39;m sincere and thoughtful, and if you&#39;re too bothered by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; writing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don&#39;t read it.  I don&#39;t want to stop writing because it&#39;s disturbing<br/>
two<br/>
&gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; three of several hundred people.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sandra&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; K- Agreed. We will both assume that we&#39;re sincere and thoughtful. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought that you could tell by my detailed posts that I thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; you were already.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Of course you will not stop writing, I&#39;m sure that has not been<br/>
&gt; &gt; requested.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I did expect that making a joke about people dying from peanut butter<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the keyboard would be thought of as unfeeling before<br/>
&gt; &gt; you sent it. That is what I meant about thoughtless. I am being too<br/>
&gt; &gt; literal for most, but it isn&#39;t a joke really. I suppose I have no<br/>
&gt; &gt; sense of humor for that kind of humor. It wasn&#39;t a joke about really<br/>
&gt; &gt; dying of course, but it was an &quot;I don&#39;t care about any whiny<br/>
&gt; &gt; problems because they exaggerate everything&quot; type of feeling. If that<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not your intent, then my apologies.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; For all my verbosity it may be hard to imagine that I am quite new to<br/>
&gt; &gt; this list. I have only been on for a couple of weeks I think. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; admit that I haven&#39;t followed enough of your posts on other topics to<br/>
&gt; &gt; know your writing well at all. All I know is what I&#39;ve seen<br/>
&gt; &gt; in your replies to my post.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Every list has its personalities, occasional posters, and lurkers.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am interested in responses from others as well, but I fear they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; not interested in this continuing saga, and I have put them<br/>
&gt; &gt; off.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And so ends the Kathy show. We now return you to your regularly<br/>
&gt; &gt; scheduled programs, with the occasional weather report.<br/>
