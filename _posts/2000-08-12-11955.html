&gt; I have to say that rats are far superior pets to hamsters or gerbils.<br/>
&gt; They are intelligent, loving, and lots of fun.  They can learn some<br/>
&gt; tricks and enjoy human companionship.  they rarely bite.  Don&#39;t let the<br/>
&gt; tail bother you.  It is somewhat prehensile and a heating/cooling<br/>
&gt; conduit.  Rats suffer a bad rap and will never recover from the whole<br/>
&gt; bubonic thing.  Wild rats and domestic rats are 2 very different<br/>
&gt; critters.  They have been domesticated for 100 years.  I would compare<br/>
&gt; domestic rats to tiny little dogs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, did I mention I have a pet rat rescue/refuge for discarded pet rats<br/>
&gt; (g).  They are such wonderful creatures.  Definitely should not be snake<br/>
&gt; food.  Setting them, or any other domestic small animal, free is a<br/>
&gt; certain death sentence.  They are not wild animals and would be easy prey<br/>
&gt; for even their own wild relatives.<br/>

As the Mommy of two beige and white hooded girlie rats... Do some<br/>
reading up first ... they prefer to be in pairs or larger groups ....<br/>
boys sit still and don&#39;t run all over the computer desk while you&#39;re<br/>
reading e-mail .... but boys smell more and I like the inquisitive,<br/>
active nature of females.<br/>
<br/>
All the single rats we&#39;ve known have not been very happy compared to the<br/>
ones who live in same sex pairs / groups. <br/>
<br/>
They are much more entertaining than hamsters or gerbils (we&#39;ve had both<br/>
),<br/>
more like little dogs who eat fruit and veggies and rat feed.<br/>

Buzz ... who&#39;d have more than two rats if dh would let her.<br/>
