<div id="ygrps-yiv-72369246">For any of you near the Denver area, there is a Scholastic Warehouse <br/>
sale going on until May 21st.  The prices are unbelievable!  I was <br/>
there today with my 12 yo son and 14 yo daughter and got some <br/>
terrific bargains.  Aisles and aisles to choose from - a good <br/>
selection - some workbooks, adult fiction, children&#39;s classics, fun <br/>
stuff (experiments, etc - my son got a kit to build a small solar <br/>
powered car) - <br/>
<br/>
Location:  14309 East 35th Place, Aurora, CO<br/>
(this is north of Colfax just off of Sable)<br/>
Hours:  9:00 am - 7:00 pm Mon - Fri  9:00 am - 5:00 pm Sat<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a large $1.00 book area with a good selection - There&#39;s <br/>
a &quot;deep discounts&quot; area on books already marked down and then 50% off <br/>
of that - <br/>
<br/>
I picked up the hard copy of the latest Harry Potter book (#4, I <br/>
believe) for $10.00 !!<br/>
<br/>
We spent 2 1/2 hours in there... great bargains, great prices :)<br/>
