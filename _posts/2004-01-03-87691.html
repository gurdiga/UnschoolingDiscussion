<div id="ygrps-yiv-1843862639">We finally closed up the house and turned on the ac. Don&#39;t see turning it<br/>
off anytime soon. Figures. I made sure I was ready for the cold weather this<br/>
year. Every year I don&#39;t worry about cold weather clothes for the kids. And<br/>
every year when it gets cold for awhile, I&#39;m stuck in finding anything for<br/>
them to wear. Usually by that time, the stores start having spring fashions<br/>
out. So this year I prepared early. Each kid is set with long pants and<br/>
sweaters and even gloves this year. The kids complained last year at sports<br/>
camp that it was hard to run with their hands in their pockets. So far it&#39;s<br/>
all just been sitting in the closets.<br/>
