<div id="ygrps-yiv-674448027">This is definitely something I&#39;ve thought a lot about. There&#39;s far too much<br/>
attention given to children being clean and presentable at all times. As an<br/>
artist, this offends me in so many ways. In school, I remember my younger<br/>
brother and step-son telling me that their art teacher paid more attention<br/>
to &quot;cleaning up&quot; than to art. So they brought home nothing but crayon<br/>
drawings (presumably because it is easy cleanup) well into their middle<br/>
school years. And although they were both extremely creative, they had<br/>
failing grades for art because they were too messy during their process! I<br/>
asked the art teacher if she&#39;d like to visit my studio sometime - or perhaps<br/>
any artist&#39;s studio and see how clean they are? Thank goodness they were<br/>
able to make things at home without worrying about what fell on the floor.<br/>
Pity the poor kids there who didn&#39;t have artist moms at home. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760325636">I&#39;m 39 years old and still like to run through a<br/>
puddle on occasion.  Why wouldn&#39;t I allow my child the<br/>
same fun.  There is just something about finger<br/>
painting or play dough or cooking that kids love and I<br/>
think it is the mess.  I had a neighbor once whose<br/>
children were bathed after every meal.  The poor<br/>
little boy squatted to play in the dirt so he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
get messy.  And she brought me over swim trunks for my<br/>
15 mth old son because he was swimming in his little<br/>
wading pool naked.  I guess she thought we couldn&#39;t<br/>
afford a suit.  His diaper had gotten soaked and we<br/>
just took it off.  Why can&#39;t kids just enjoy being<br/>
messy once in awhile? I guarantee that for the most<br/>
part it is for our own convenience.  Christy Austin <br/>

I volunteered at a Camp Fire day camp last summer.  One of the other  <br/>
volunteers was also a Marine reservist.  She ordered some of her reservist  <br/>
subordinates to come and do stuff with the kids one day.  However, it  rained very hard <br/>
that day, a summer rain, where it stayed hot and steamy.   After it stopped, <br/>
these Marines stripped down to their t-shirts and took the  kids <br/>
puddle-jumping.  They cavorted all over that park in the puddles and  had the kids sliding <br/>
head first across the wet grass.  <br/>
 <br/>
My son *still* talks about that day and the pure fun those Marines had with  <br/>
those groups of 9 year olds.<br/>
