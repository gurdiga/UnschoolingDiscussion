<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have received a million emails since I joined,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m a little confused as to how this works.  Most of the emails<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t make any sense to me because they are replies to someone<br/>
&gt; else&#39;s question, that I most of the time do not see.  Can you give<br/>
&gt; me some pointers?  Also, I&#39;ve seen reference to a conference and<br/>
&gt; meetings.  How can I find out about these, and start getting<br/>
&gt; involved with other homeschoolers/unschoolers?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, Teresa S. in Texas,<br/>
<br/>
Think of this like a cocktail party where you&#39;ve just decided the group you<br/>
were standing with was boring and now you&#39;ve wandered over to a group that<br/>
looked particularly lively.  They&#39;re in mid-stream, and you&#39;ll probably have<br/>
to listen for awhile to get the jist of their conversation.  Just read, even<br/>
if it&#39;s only scanning through many of the emails.  After a week or so,<br/>
you&#39;ll easily have the discussion figured out, because most topics don&#39;t<br/>
survive even a week, and you&#39;ll be able to follow it all.<br/>
<br/>
The conference you&#39;ve seen info about is in South Carolina in October.<br/>
Kelly (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Kbcdlovejo@...">Kbcdlovejo@...</a>) runs it, and usually the website is in her<br/>
signature block.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you read around a bit at the Unschooling.com website?  There&#39;s info<br/>
there by state which might help you hook up with people.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, if you want answers to a specific question, ask away!  Hope<br/>
you&#39;re enjoying having your child back home.<br/>
