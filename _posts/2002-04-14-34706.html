<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195768324">Hello,<br/>
My name is Sharon and I am new to the list.  I have been reading the posts<br/>
with much interest.  I do have a question and I am asking this with a<br/>
sincere heart, no sarcasm or anything like that.  I am educating my 10 year<br/>
old grand-daughter (or tryng to) and while I am very interested in this<br/>
unschooling method I am wondering how you fit reading and writing etc.  into<br/>
the picture.  My grand-daughter has learning disabilities (dyslexia) and<br/>
public schools were a nightmare, I will spare you the details about that but<br/>
at age 10 her reading is nowhere near what they would call &quot;grade level&quot;.<br/>
Actually her and I don&#39;t do grades, except for exemption forms.  Raising my<br/>
own children I hated how they grouped kids into grades and assembly lined<br/>
them through school.<br/>
<br/>
I like the sounds of what you people are doing but I do want her reading and<br/>
writing so she can have the ability to learn on her own.  Without starting<br/>
any controversies or anything I was wondering if any of you who have done<br/>
the unschooling thing for a while (years?) would kind of give me a brief<br/>
run-down of how you work these things into their educations without a<br/>
structured type program.<br/>
<br/>
I would really love to find something that works for us.  Homeschooling has<br/>
worked far better than formal schooling but this is not something we are<br/>
entirely happy about.  Being told that it is time to sit and work in<br/>
workbooks is no better than the bell ringing at play time.<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping it is not to late to teach this old dog a few new tricks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Which reminds me, what is wrong with playing with dirt and rocks for<br/>
weeks<br/>
&gt; &gt; at a time?  Kids with imagination build whole cities, dig caves, build<br/>
&gt; &gt; castles with the rocks, become interested in the flora and fauna around<br/>
&gt; &gt; them, bring far too many bugs in the house to find out what they are<br/>
(o.k.,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so I don&#39;t like bugs in my house &lt;g&gt;), climb trees, build tree houses,<br/>
kick<br/>
&gt; &gt; a ball, run, jump, try doing gymnastics, ride bicycles, roller blade,<br/>
ride<br/>
&gt; &gt; scooters, play Evil Knivel (loose two front teeth %-{ ), teach the dog<br/>
&gt; &gt; circus tricks, make mud pies, climb fences, try to walk a tight rope,<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; &gt; Robin Hood and sword fight, play with dolls, play with cars, try rubbing<br/>
two<br/>
&gt; &gt; sticks together to start a camp fire, collect rocks that are<br/>
&gt; &gt; different/pretty, play Army, make a rope swing, collect flowers (I&#39;m<br/>
running<br/>
&gt; &gt; out of vases to put them in and the house smells soooo good, Spring is<br/>
&gt; &gt; here!), play house, skip rope and the list is endless.  Just plain old<br/>
&gt; &gt; unbridled imagination and doesn&#39;t take parent coerced stimulus.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s a lot more than just sticks and rocks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If they have rope and bikes and cars, roller blades, scooters, a dog,<br/>
trees,<br/>
&gt; dolls and flowers, that does give them a lot of options.  And I presume<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; parents provided those things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was never talking about &quot;parent coerced stimulus&quot; and I don&#39;t think<br/>
anyone<br/>
&gt; here really thought that &quot;providing opportunities and resources&quot;<br/>
translates<br/>
&gt; reasonabley to &quot;parent coerced stimulus.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a family had no trees, flowers, bikes, cars, roller blades, scooters,<br/>
&gt; dogs, dolls, and wouldn&#39;t let their kids play with rope or hammers, nails<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; boards, I think that family would not be providing the optimal unschooling<br/>
&gt; environment, and if a kid had a really boring back yard, a boring<br/>
&gt; inside-of-house, and the parent wasn&#39;t offering to take him elsewhere,<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; could do better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think leaving children to their own devices works better when the kids<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; lots of ideas, materials and support when they want it.<br/>

She can learn lots before she can read.  If you put reading ahead of learning <br/>
the other things, that could be really limiting.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an article by Carol Rice about her late-reading children.  I know <br/>
these kids.  One is a really great cook (vegan and vegetarian).  One has <br/>
bicycle trophies galore.  One is extremely knowledgeable about flight, <br/>
planes, aero-everything, and at 18 he was working full time at REI.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know what the youngest&#39;s bragging-point is--I could ask my boys, but one&#39;s at <br/>
a birthday party and one&#39;s at a gaming shop.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They fit in right where they fit into life... we read and write when it&#39;s<br/>
useful and/or fun. My daughter reads a lot, a mishmash of novels and<br/>
comics. She rarely writes... sometimes she make her own comics, once she<br/>
wrote a &quot;Dear Veronica&quot; letter (Veronica from the Archies comics now has<br/>
her own advice column), often she adds things to grocery lists, and very<br/>
occasionally she&#39;ll wrote a poem or start a story. She isn&#39;t writing or<br/>
spelling at &quot;grade level&quot;. She has, however, learned an awful lot of<br/>
other things.... and I know that someday she&#39;ll write well.<br/>
<br/>
Does your granddaughter want to work on reading and writing? Actually, if<br/>
she were my child, I would worry most about helping her just recover from<br/>
school right now, help her try to feel safe in learning and growing and<br/>
being, and help her to feel good in her own skin. <br/>
<br/>
And kudos for looking into unschooling, and for asking questions, and for<br/>
trying  to do the best you can for your granddaughter. Your post just<br/>
sounded so loving and caring. I wish my daughter had a grandma like<br/>
you....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She enjoys reading words, phrases, signs and easy things like that.<br/>
Actually her reading has improved in the last few weeks.  She detests<br/>
writing ANYTHING and it is very  very slow and difficult for her.  Her<br/>
writing looks more like a first graders. Her math is about third grade level<br/>
probably.  She is learning and progressing.  It is very slow yet steady.  I<br/>
do feel good about that.<br/>
<br/>
She was not in public school very long.  We tried it a couple of times but I<br/>
didn&#39;t like the way she was treated and she would dissolve into tears and/or<br/>
sobs as soon as she got home.<br/>
<br/>
Her father sometimes is on her back and &quot;threatens&quot; public school if he<br/>
thinks she and I are not doing as much school work as he thinks we should.<br/>
Normally this happens when he has gotten static from an outsider about the<br/>
fact that she doesn&#39;t go to school.  He is a single father so everybody<br/>
thinks he needs their advice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028721373">&quot;Then other<br/>
times I wonder why I am so concerned, not everybody in the world has to<br/>
be a<br/>
great reader.&quot;<br/>
Sharon, that is absolutely the truth.  My dad never learned to read more<br/>
than a road sign, and even that he had to ask his &quot;co-pilot&quot; to make<br/>
sure.  Yet, he followed his passion for horses and became a very popular<br/>
and successful rancher.  He had an accountant when he was single, then a<br/>
wife with money smarts, to pay his bills.  My husband is not a very good<br/>
reader or writer, although he can do both.  He still gets confused by a<br/>
lot of words.  But he does well as a journeyman in the construction<br/>
field, and as a coach.  His brother is illiterate, probably from being<br/>
beaten by his dad when he didn&#39;t do well in school.  But my husband<br/>
apprenticed him in the trade, and now he is completely self-sufficient<br/>
and self employed and even has been foreman on a lot of jobs.  The reason<br/>
my husband apprenticed him was because he was homeless after getting out<br/>
of jail.  He was an alcoholic.  Now he&#39;s been clean and sober for over<br/>
six years.  I&#39;ve worked for a lot of doctors who were terrible at writing<br/>
and spelling.  There are organizations that specialize in helping people<br/>
with dyslexia learn to read.  I&#39;m sure you could find one in your area. <br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t do that for many years, since there is plenty of time for<br/>
her to develop other interests right now.  Some people outgrow dyslexia. <br/>
Sometimes it is better to focus on strengths rather than on weaknesses. <br/>
No need to waste time wearing her out on reading.  I&#39;m thinking of a<br/>
workout.  They say to work out the smaller, easier muscles first ,<br/>
because the biggest muscles make you tired, so do them last.  My husband<br/>
and his siblings did not learn to read until late, and were always<br/>
humiliated for being behind everyone else.  What would have happened if<br/>
they had been left on their own to learn?  It couldn&#39;t have been any<br/>
worse than it was with all the humiliation and stress of being forced to<br/>
read in front of the class and coming home with bad grades.  My husband<br/>
learned to read when he was seventeen and wanted to read the Bible.  My<br/>
sister in law said that in junior high when they had to read in front of<br/>
the class, she would count how many paragraphs before they would get to<br/>
her turn to read out loud, and she would practice her paragraph over and<br/>
over so she memorized it before her turn.  She didn&#39;t learn anything, she<br/>
just put all her focus on not being humiliated.  Now, as an adult, she<br/>
writes the most beautiful poetry and can read books without a glitch.  My<br/>
dad lied and had friends cheat for him so he graduated.  Why not just let<br/>
him stay out of school and play with horses, which he did anyway by<br/>
skipping school.  Everyone has weaknesses and strengths, and we should<br/>
focus on strengths in others.  School means nothing.  Passion means<br/>
everything.  Grades mean nothing.  Acceptance means everything.  Okay I&#39;m<br/>
done.<br/>

I have first hand knowledge of this!!!!!!  I think the single most important<br/>
thing is for your grandaughter to be aware that she has dyslexia, and<br/>
understand what it is, since it will be with her for life.  The other thing<br/>
that is important is to remember that she will most likely read slower until<br/>
she gets used to sorting it out, if you push her she&#39;ll just not read.<br/>
Writting you usually have to double check to make sure it is all correct, I<br/>
don&#39;t on email tho, so you&#39;ll see many of my errors.  My spell checker isn&#39;t<br/>
working, and i&#39;m usually in a hurry when doing email anyway.<br/>

Thing about the dyslexia is that her father has it also.  When he was<br/>
growing up homeschooling or unschooling was only an option if you were<br/>
willing to spend time in jail.  School was just someplace where he spent<br/>
time with his friends.  He mentally dropped out before he was the age<br/>
Chaelene is now.  He felt that he was stupid because everybody was finished<br/>
with their papers when he was only on about the second problem.  It takes<br/>
him 10 to 15 minutes to read one type written page.<br/>
<br/>
Even though you can discuss it with them and talk about it, it is still<br/>
difficult for them to understand just what you are talking about when it is<br/>
all they know.  Chaelene actually sees the letters moving and changing<br/>
positions while she is looking at them.  Some days she does pretty well and<br/>
other days she will look at a two letter word like &quot;no&quot; and think it says<br/>
&quot;on&quot;.  It gets worse with the bigger words.  I hate to say it but sometimes<br/>
it is hard to be patient and I feel like I am going to scream.  Then other<br/>
times I wonder why I am so concerned, not everybody in the world has to be a<br/>

label into his early twenties. Then he left the &quot;system&quot; and, without a<br/>
few years, became a proficient writer and reader, even reading for fun. I<br/>
think a lot of it was that he now needed those skills for real life, and<br/>
then enabled him to get through some of the blocks he&#39;d put up, and learn<br/>
other ways. He says that he doesn&#39;t have a learning disability now, and I<br/>
agree. <br/>
<br/>
I believe A. S. Neill said they&#39;d never had a child who didn&#39;t become a<br/>
proficient reader at Summerhill. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a child is writing something formal then I agree, as long as the child<br/>
wants your help.  I think people often judge a writer based on grammar<br/>
and spelling. Even if a person&#39;s ideas have merit, if his writing is full<br/>
of errors they&#39;re often discounted.  I sent an email today with an extra<br/>
comma (I edited the sentence and didn&#39;t erase it) and it&#39;s been bothering<br/>
me ever since I saw it come through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-774199715">I&#39;d suggest that if reading is going to be so difficult as it seems with <br/>
Chaelene (GREAT NAME, by the way), that you focus on making sure she knows <br/>
how to learn in other ways. I&#39;d subscribe to books on tape!!! That would be <br/>
the most important thing - because she can learn so much from listening - you <br/>
don&#39;t want her reading disability to get in the way of her learning stuff <br/>

Often it&#39;s not steady but in bursts--not only homeschooling, but kids at <br/>

Normally this happens when he has gotten static from an outsider about the<br/>
fact that she doesn&#39;t go to school. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would tell him he needs to educate himself about <br/>
homeschooling to the point that he can respond to those people with <br/>
confidence.  Buy some back issues of Home Education Magazine, and maybe a <br/>
book or two (men tend to like Guterson&#39;s -Family Matters_), and he needs to <br/>
read them and maybe carry them around to show to people who criticize or <br/>
question.  <br/>
<br/>
Whether he reads them or not, it will get him off your back about it.  It&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6856629">Even though I use the phrase &quot;learning disability&quot;, I hate that phrase.  It<br/>
seems to say &quot;unable to learn&quot;.  I don&#39;t feel children with dyslexia are<br/>

called &quot;average&quot;.  I want to be able to teach &quot;differently&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Chaelene&#39;s father is 30 and also dyslexic.  He can read but does not do it<br/>
for pleasure and only does it out of necessity.  Once he learned to<br/>
understand it it was not so much of a problem for him either.  Even though<br/>
he dropped out of school at 16, he later went back and got his ged then<br/>
finished a five year plumber apprenticeship.  He now makes more money than<br/>
my children with college educations and nobody would ever know that school<br/>
had been a problem for him.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that has improved Chaelene&#39;s reading the most was when my daughter<br/>
was here with a super ninetendo game.  There was a game Chaelene loved to<br/>
play but you had to keep reading the instructions.  I would help but she<br/>
kept wanting to play when others were too busy to help so she had to start<br/>
figuring the words for herself.  I could not believe how rapidly her reading<br/>
began to improve.  Just can&#39;t afford a super ninetendo though!! LOL<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; My brother was disgnosed with dyslexia when he was 7, and carried the<br/>
&gt; label into his early twenties. Then he left the &quot;system&quot; and, without a<br/>
&gt; few years, became a proficient writer and reader, even reading for fun. I<br/>
&gt; think a lot of it was that he now needed those skills for real life, and<br/>
&gt; then enabled him to get through some of the blocks he&#39;d put up, and learn<br/>
&gt; other ways. He says that he doesn&#39;t have a learning disability now, and I<br/>
&gt; agree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I believe A. S. Neill said they&#39;d never had a child who didn&#39;t become a<br/>
&gt; proficient reader at Summerhill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Writting you usually have to double check to make sure it is all<br/>
&gt; correct, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t on email tho, so you&#39;ll see many of my errors.  My spell  checker<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; working, and i&#39;m usually in a hurry when doing email anyway.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a child is writing something formal then I agree, as long as the child<br/>
&gt; wants your help.  I think people often judge a writer based on grammar<br/>
&gt; and spelling. Even if a person&#39;s ideas have merit, if his writing is full<br/>
&gt; of errors they&#39;re often discounted.  I sent an email today with an extra<br/>
&gt; comma (I edited the sentence and didn&#39;t erase it) and it&#39;s been bothering<br/>
&gt; me ever since I saw it come through.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;d suggest that if reading is going to be so difficult as it seems with<br/>
&gt; Chaelene (GREAT NAME, by the way), that you focus on making sure she knows<br/>
&gt; how to learn in other ways. I&#39;d subscribe to books on tape!!! That would<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; the most important thing - because she can learn so much from listening -<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want her reading disability to get in the way of her learning stuff<br/>
&gt; that she&#39;d be interested in if she didn&#39;t have learning problems. If<br/>

Gee, Chaelene would probably be thrilled to just hang out with your dad.<br/>
She has horses too, it is her main love in life.  She began riding in the<br/>
Jr. Rodeo here this year.  Sometimes I wish there were a speaker out by the<br/>
stalls so I could hear what she says to them. LOL  Especially if she is<br/>
upset with the family,,,she is out &quot;chatting&quot; with the horses.<br/>
<br/>
BTW...I am an excellent reader now, but I also used to count the paragraphs<br/>
and spend the time practicing mine so I wouldn&#39;t make any mistakes.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t learn anything but fear of humiliation.  It was really a drag too<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &quot;Then other<br/>
&gt; times I wonder why I am so concerned, not everybody in the world has to<br/>
&gt; be a<br/>
&gt; great reader.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Sharon, that is absolutely the truth.  My dad never learned to read more<br/>
&gt; than a road sign, and even that he had to ask his &quot;co-pilot&quot; to make<br/>
&gt; sure.  Yet, he followed his passion for horses and became a very popular<br/>
&gt; and successful rancher.  He had an accountant when he was single, then a<br/>
&gt; wife with money smarts, to pay his bills.  My husband is not a very good<br/>
&gt; reader or writer, although he can do both.  He still gets confused by a<br/>
&gt; lot of words.  But he does well as a journeyman in the construction<br/>
&gt; field, and as a coach.  His brother is illiterate, probably from being<br/>
&gt; beaten by his dad when he didn&#39;t do well in school.  But my husband<br/>
&gt; apprenticed him in the trade, and now he is completely self-sufficient<br/>
&gt; and self employed and even has been foreman on a lot of jobs.  The reason<br/>
&gt; my husband apprenticed him was because he was homeless after getting out<br/>
&gt; of jail.  He was an alcoholic.  Now he&#39;s been clean and sober for over<br/>
&gt; six years.  I&#39;ve worked for a lot of doctors who were terrible at writing<br/>
&gt; and spelling.  There are organizations that specialize in helping people<br/>
&gt; with dyslexia learn to read.  I&#39;m sure you could find one in your area.<br/>
&gt; But I wouldn&#39;t do that for many years, since there is plenty of time for<br/>
&gt; her to develop other interests right now.  Some people outgrow dyslexia.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it is better to focus on strengths rather than on weaknesses.<br/>
&gt; No need to waste time wearing her out on reading.  I&#39;m thinking of a<br/>
&gt; workout.  They say to work out the smaller, easier muscles first ,<br/>
&gt; because the biggest muscles make you tired, so do them last.  My husband<br/>
&gt; and his siblings did not learn to read until late, and were always<br/>
&gt; humiliated for being behind everyone else.  What would have happened if<br/>
&gt; they had been left on their own to learn?  It couldn&#39;t have been any<br/>
&gt; worse than it was with all the humiliation and stress of being forced to<br/>
&gt; read in front of the class and coming home with bad grades.  My husband<br/>
&gt; learned to read when he was seventeen and wanted to read the Bible.  My<br/>
&gt; sister in law said that in junior high when they had to read in front of<br/>
&gt; the class, she would count how many paragraphs before they would get to<br/>
&gt; her turn to read out loud, and she would practice her paragraph over and<br/>
&gt; over so she memorized it before her turn.  She didn&#39;t learn anything, she<br/>
&gt; just put all her focus on not being humiliated.  Now, as an adult, she<br/>
&gt; writes the most beautiful poetry and can read books without a glitch.  My<br/>
&gt; dad lied and had friends cheat for him so he graduated.  Why not just let<br/>
&gt; him stay out of school and play with horses, which he did anyway by<br/>
&gt; skipping school.  Everyone has weaknesses and strengths, and we should<br/>
&gt; focus on strengths in others.  School means nothing.  Passion means<br/>
&gt; everything.  Grades mean nothing.  Acceptance means everything.  Okay I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; done.<br/>

That&#39;s sad.  I would have traded you half of my reading.  <br/>
<br/>
I would read the whole article or chapter quickly and then be reading my own <br/>
book under the desk.  If I were called upon, one of the kids near me would <br/>
casually put a finger on the right paragraph in her book, and I&#39;d read my <br/>
paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about kids counting passages.   When I taught and we had <br/>
read-aloud opportunities like that (often screenplays in Scope magazine), <br/>
kids could read one or three paragraphs, as they wanted (more if they were <br/>
tiny), and then pass it on.  Sometimes we passed it randomly around the room, <br/>
with them picking the next reader, and kids would indicate by waving or <br/>

First I think one has to figure out what kind of learner she is.   It isn&#39;t<br/>
a reading disability, it doesn&#39;t only affect your reading and writting.<br/>
It&#39;s a whole different way of thinking and processing information.  I hate<br/>
book on tape, my hubbys has them, I have to listen to the thing over and<br/>
over again to catch it all.<br/>

Hey Sharon,<br/>
I haven&#39;t read any other posts yet, so forgive me if someone already <br/>
mentioned this....<br/>
My ds just purchased a Nintendo 64 system from a local pawnshop. He <br/>
got two controllers, an adapter for our tv, two games, a memory card <br/>
and of course the system itself, all of it together was $50.00.<br/>
You can find used ones everywhere it seems. Try calling around to <br/>
some pawn shops, you might be able to afford one after all.<br/>

&gt;&quot;on&quot;.  It gets worse with the bigger words.  I hate to say it but sometimes<br/>
&gt;it is hard to be patient and I feel like I am going to scream.  Then other<br/>

isn&#39;t the most important thing in the world, though you want to do <br/>
everything you can to help them be as good at reading as they can be.  You <br/>
might want to look into getting her tested for Irlen&#39;s Syndrome.  Your <br/>
description of what happens with her sounds like it.  Eye doctors and <br/>
special ed teachers never know anything about it, so even if she&#39;s been <br/>
through testing, it won&#39;t likely have been picked up.  If they have it, <br/>
they get coloured plastic overlays in the colour that&#39;s right for them, and <br/>
it helps the letters stay still.  The testing for that was about $100 <br/>
Canadian, which would be about $75 US (I think)  There&#39;s more testing that <br/>
can be done for coloured lenses (which are only rarely the same colour as <br/>
the overlays because of refraction.)  My son has it, but not severe enough <br/>
that it was worth it to him to keep using the overlays.  But I&#39;ve heard of <br/>
other kids where it made all the difference.  (I&#39;ve heard of it helping <br/>
adults too.  Might help your son.)<br/>
Try www.irlenclinic.com for info and a tester near you.  There&#39;s also a <br/>
book by Helen Irlen.  I forget the title, but I got it at our library.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910198165">Wow, Sharon, who would know my email reply to you could have touched on<br/>
things you could relate to so much?  My dad had asthma, I get it too, and<br/>
so does my second son.  My sister Jessica takes after my dad.  From a<br/>
young age she was interested in the horses, and in pony club, a barrel<br/>
racing club.  She went to thirteen years of school, and what did she do<br/>
but go to work at  a dairy where she met the owner, now her husband. <br/>
They own a farm and have a baby.  Before that, she raised goats and<br/>
calves and sold them and that supported my step-mom&#39;s farm after my dad<br/>
died.  She still has horses.  She actually got a scholarship for college,<br/>
but had no interest, since she just wanted to be a homemaker and take<br/>
care of animals.  She has a real business sense with animals and knows<br/>
just how to fix &#39;em up when they&#39;re hurt or sick.  For a while before she<br/>
got married she had a small business taking her petting zoo to kid&#39;s<br/>
parties and local community events.  Now she takes care of her baby and<br/>
her ailing mother in law.  I have never seen anyone who didn&#39;t complain<br/>
about their mother in law.  She has such a good character.  I really<br/>
admire her.<br/>
&quot;The thing that has improved Chaelene&#39;s reading the most was when my<br/>
daughter<br/>
was here with a super ninetendo game.&quot;  <br/>
That sounds just like an unschooler.  Maybe you could ask your daughter<br/>
to give you that game after she is done with it.  People are always<br/>
replacing things like that.  Sometimes you can rent them from video game<br/>
places.  They are also sold second hand for a significantly lower amount<br/>
than new ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835206745">Thanks for the good ideas and for sharing about your family.  I really<br/>
enjoyed reading it.<br/>
<br/>
Your sister sounds like somebody who deserves to be admired.  Chaelene would<br/>
love to know somebody like that and could probably learn anything that would<br/>
be within her interest realm.  She wants to be a veterinarian!<br/>
<br/>
Actually she sounds like somebody I could really learn from also.<br/>

not history!!!)<br/>
