Dear Amy,
<br>I hate hamsters.&nbsp; My sister had one that bit me.
<br>Buy it and feed it to the cat.&nbsp; The cat will get a lot more enjoyment
out of it and that way he will be spared a lifetime of useless wheel turning
that will keep you awake during the night, in addition to the mindless
cage cleaning, if you don&#39;t want your child&#39;s room to stink to high heaven.&nbsp;
<br>Gerbils are less smelly, and run faster, more animated.&nbsp;&nbsp;
More of a challenge for the cat, too.
<br>We had a &quot;dwarf &quot; rabbit called Lapinou for TEN years,&nbsp; I hate
caged animals so we finally opted for the San Diego zoo no-bars format,
just a big box on a table with low side walls, he just sat there coolly
on the back porch watching the world go by.&nbsp; No agressive cats in
the neighbourhood to worry him.

<p>Bart
<br>(with just a Siamese style cat (Lapinou&#39;s former bud)and a half-blind
(cataract) non pedigree idiot poodle left, the latter who got all wound
up in the wires hanging down from the back of my computer, not just once
but a number of times, like &quot;What an idiot! Poodles are supposed to be
smart!&quot; and then stands there mute like an idiot, unable to move.&nbsp;
I guess he did learn cause the third time he tried to free himself chewing
through the cable that goes from the CPU to the monitor, which is a b _
_ _ _&nbsp; to fix)&nbsp; Doggone it, anyway!

our dog and cats. We&#39;re already planning on keeping them in her room, but
I&#39;m worried they might sneak in. Any suggestions or advice appreciated.</font></font><font FACE="Arial"><font SIZE="-1">ThanksAmy</font></font>

Some folks are repulsed by the rat&#39;s tail but it never bothered me.  Would <br/>
you need to handle them or would the kids be able to do that?  Kids are <br/>
seldom bothered by our adult kinds of bias.  I&#39;ve talked to many people who <br/>
let their rats roam the house like a cat or dog and are trained to use a <br/>
litter box.  Most of the time our rats were on a platform with the cage open, <br/>
until the cat moved in too.<br/>
