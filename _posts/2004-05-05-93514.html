 </span></blockquote>Some adults (the lucky ones, or the smart ones) play their whole lives long.<br/>
The play becomes more structured and focused with older children, and at<br/>
that point those aiding and abetting the player should be sure to do what<br/>
they&#39;ve done all along -- keep a keen eye out for resources that might be of<br/>
interest; keep a willing ear to listen to what fascinates the player; keep<br/>
an open mind that something that the outside educationally-brainwashed<br/>
masses might think of as &quot;useless&quot;, isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Grown-ups who love what they do for &quot;a living&quot; aren&#39;t different than<br/>
children who pretend to be tigers in the grass for the joy of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-990247631">&lt;&lt;What should I look for then?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think older unschooling kids continue to play but their play tends to be<br/>
more goal focused, more &quot;concentrated&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They develop interests and pursue those and while having fun doing pottery,<br/>
they &quot;connect the dots&quot; (to borrow from Sandra) without even realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
They see how the different glazes work, how changing the temperature makes<br/>
drastic changes in the result.<br/>
<br/>
 They see that the more they practice, the better they get.<br/>
<br/>
They see that others may be much better than they are but that lots of<br/>
things are still worth doing even if we aren&#39;t the best at it.<br/>
<br/>
They see that they might need more money to pay for this fun and perhaps<br/>
need a job.<br/>
<br/>
They might even realize that the person running the studio will trade them<br/>
&quot;wheel time&quot; for helping with a class of younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
They realize that life can be made up of playing forever and that it is ok.<br/>

Kirby just spent fifteen minutes describing a game to me.  His friend Leif <br/>
bought it for only $40 though it&#39;s hard to find and usually costs $60.  (Game <br/>
#1, procuring and saving money)   I asked if Leif knew we were leaving for the <br/>
weekend and might need his game, but Kirby said he wanted to leave it here <br/>
because it was probably the only place he&#39;d get to play it.    <br/>
<br/>
It takes a team of hobbits, against Sauron.  The players are working <br/>
cooperatively.  When Sauron moves (somehow, some card draw maybe) he gets closer.  <br/>
There are five boards.  Two are double sided.  Kirby was really animated in his <br/>
descriptions, and obviously looking forward to playing this game again, and <br/>
reminded me how fun it was and  that it&#39;s hard to find.  (Birthday gift hint, I <br/>
figure.)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 17.<br/>
<br/>
He still plays.<br/>
<br/>
He plays ork ball (a game Marty created and runs).<br/>
<br/>
He plays boffers sometimes (padded toy swords.)<br/>
<br/>
He has SCA armor and though he works on weekends and hardly goes to events <br/>
this year, he has an SCA persona, costumes, he&#39;s a squire and he has entered <br/>
tournaments.  That&#39;s a BIG playing situation.<br/>
<br/>
He plays video games.<br/>
<br/>
He has worked over three years at a gaming shop, where kids and adults spend <br/>
some considerable money on games from chess and dice to collectible card games <br/>
to miniatures games where they paint teensy figures in great detail.   That&#39;s <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
All that is learning, too, and it&#39;s voluntary, fun, engaging, a way to make <br/>
and maintain friendships...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband says &quot;Give them time to relax, and they&#39;ll start playing again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly (12) says &quot;Give them things they want to play with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kids who&#39;ve been in school have to recover from having learned to sit and <br/>
wait for people to tell them what to do,&quot; Keith said.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said, &quot;So you BRING them things to do!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This weekend we&#39;re going on a little family vacation.  We&#39;ll go to Carlsbad <br/>
Caverns, stay in a motel with a little water park, go to a zoo, go to White <br/>
Sands, and then to the grandparents&#39; house.   We usually play a game with them.  <br/>
Sometimes it used to be Yahtzee, but we&#39;ve played lots of different games, and <br/>
lately Five Crowns.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby will play around in the caverns, play at the water park, play at White <br/>
Sands.<br/>
Marty too.   He&#39;s 15.<br/>
Holly too.  She&#39;s 12 and a half.<br/>
<br/>
Me and Keith too, and we haven&#39;t been their ages for a long time.<br/>

<br/>
My husband is 42. He still plays - and not just his X-Box. <br/>
One of the games he plays is with his Ham radio buddies one night a week.<br/>
They take turns hosting a trivia contest. One person asks the questions (I<br/>
suspect they often use the cards from Trivial Pursuit) and the rest of the<br/>
listeners jump in all over each other to answer, or make humorous smart ass<br/>
comments. There is no winner or loser. I guess it is the only time when<br/>
jamming, ie keying over another person, is somewhat allowable.<br/>
<br/>
James wants to do a Ham Funshop at the conference. Also a Geocache hunt.<br/>
This is all ages playing together.<br/>
<br/>
Actors play &quot;The Game&quot; a lot. For those who don&#39;t know that would be<br/>
Charades.<br/>

<br/>
Keith&#39;s 47.  He was excited about a game someone came up with at an SCA event <br/>
last weekend, and he was in on it.   Armored guys with their rattan swords, <br/>
six at a time, around a tree, and each had to hold a rope.  First pass, you <br/>
couldn&#39;t engage the guy next to you in combat, you had to skip over to another <br/>
one.  So they had a handicap, and ropes in the way, and in a bit only one guy&#39;s <br/>
still up.  I didn&#39;t even ask Keith how well he did, and he didn&#39;t tell me, <br/>
because that wasn&#39;t the important part of the story.  It was a new game he had <br/>
never played or seen.<br/>
<br/>
One they do lots, which takes no preparation, is &quot;bear pit,&quot; and it&#39;s just <br/>
one guy taking challengers.  Those who want to fight him line up, and as long as <br/>
he wins, he&#39;s still <br/>
&quot;In the pit.&quot;  If he loses, the winner is &quot;in the bear pit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That they&#39;ve done for years, though, and the first time there was really a <br/>
little pit, and sometimes they&#39;ve found other parks or places where there was a <br/>
natural little low place and it inspires them to play bear pit, but if there&#39;s <br/>
not one they just claim a spot, somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Only really good fighters will start it, because it only works if it&#39;s a good <br/>
guy being challenged.  And it&#39;s a good way for newer SCA combatants to get to <br/>
fight experienced guys without the trouble of negotiating a lesson, or of <br/>
entering a formal tournament, and they can keep getting back in line if they want <br/>
to, or wander off if they want, without pressure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045844175">&lt;&lt;go to White Sands&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite family vacations was to White Sands.  We only had 2 kids<br/>
then, 5 and 3.  We did Carlsbad, did the Billy the Kid stuff, came back<br/>
through Big Bend area into Texas and hit the Judge Roy Bean stuff.  We had<br/>
such a blast.  The kids still talk about that as one of our favorite trips.<br/>
