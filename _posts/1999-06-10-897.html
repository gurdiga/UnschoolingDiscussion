<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912873729">How many people look at their children and think they&#39;re doing &quot;nothing&quot;? I <br/>
think we have been brainwashed by p.s. to think that if a child is not doing <br/>
something that looks &quot;schoolish&quot;, then they are not doing anything <br/>
worthwhile.(They are not learning). When an adult reads for pleasure, or <br/>
talks to the neighbors, or watches television, they are &quot;relaxing&quot; or &quot;taking <br/>
a break&quot;. Not so with the children. They are &quot;loafing&quot; or &quot;goofing off&quot;.<br/>
My middle daughter (Angie) went through this in March of this year. Angie <br/>
decided that she should go back to school. The conversation went something <br/>
like this:<br/>
Angie:&quot;Mom, I am not learning anything!&quot;<br/>
Me:&quot;Yes you are. You&#39;re learning all the time.&quot;<br/>
Angie:&quot;No I&#39;m not. You don&#39;t teach us anything.&quot;<br/>
Me:&quot;I am not the teacher. You can learn on your own.&quot;<br/>
Angie:&quot;This is sick. You&#39;re gonna get caught.&quot;<br/>
Me:&quot;Angie, I&#39;ve told you about unschooling.&quot;<br/>
Angie:&quot;Yeah, mom, but we don&#39;t DO anything!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
See what I mean? In her 8 short years of p.s., she had been brainwashed into <br/>
thinking that she was doing &quot;nothing&quot;. She still is not &quot;comfortable&quot; with <br/>
the idea of unschooling. She is doing better with the idea since the <br/>
&quot;assessment&quot;. Now she brags to her friends, &quot;We&#39;re still on summer vacation <br/>
from LAST year.&quot; LOL!<br/>
I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s easier for some people to accept unschooling fully and <br/>
let go of those &quot;schoolish&quot; ideas of learning. I know that Angie has always <br/>
been a &quot;worrier&quot;.<br/>
It came easy for me, as it did Angie&#39;s sisters. I just know that &quot;old habits <br/>
die hard&quot;.<br/>
I really do think that school is evil. I just wish I would have listened to <br/>
Angie when she came home one day in first grade and said, &quot;I hate school. <br/>
Could you homeschool me?&quot; It&#39;s my biggest regret in life--leaving her in <br/>
school for almost 8 years.<br/>

<br/>
Uh..... ME, sometimes.  I have one quiet child, who really is a thinker, more <br/>
than a doer.  He just turned 5 recently, and is going through a profound, <br/>
thoughtful stage.  Very interesting questions and observations bubble out of <br/>
him off and on throughout the day.  So I have some evidence that he is <br/>
thinking, thinking, thinking.  Yet I can look at him and just think he is <br/>
sitting or vegetating.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking is invisible.  I just need to change my assumptions and assume that <br/>
he is always thinking.<br/>

I am reminded of a poem...goes something like:<br/>
&quot;if you see me stacking blocks.....don&#39;t say, &quot;oh he&#39;s just playing&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m learning hand-eye coordination and physics.<br/>
if you see me humming a made-up song...don&#39;t say, &quot;oh, she&#39;s just playing&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m creating a symphony, with instruments and voices...<br/>
etc&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of it?  I&#39;ve got it filed away, somewhere; although it <br/>
should be framed in the kids&#39; room...<br/>

sounds like a great piece to have around and share with some of those in-laws.<br/>
