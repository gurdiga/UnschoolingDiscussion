&gt; least 20 people who have asked these questions, or to Jews who would not be<br/>
&gt; able to respond to these questions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am sending my thanks as well......<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know much about the jewish faith and had issues from what I had <br/>
heard, but I always say you gotta find out the truth for yourself instead of <br/>
believing what you are told.<br/>
That is once of the things that I try to get my children to see.....You into <br/>
the beliefs and don&#39;t take others word for it..... We have a book called <br/>
Handbook of Denominations of the united states...the library was having a <br/>
book sale and we picked it up. It is very informative.<br/>
