&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; While taking a routine vandalism report at an<br/>
&gt; &gt; elementary school, I  was  interrupted by a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little girl about six years old.  Looking up and <br/>
&gt; &gt; down  at  my uniform, she asked, &quot;Are you a cop?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes,&quot; I answered and continued writing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; report. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;My mother said if I ever needed help I should<br/>
&gt; &gt; ask the police. Is  that right?&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right,&quot; I told her. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;Well, then,&quot; she said as she extended her foot<br/>
&gt; &gt; toward me, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;would you please  tie my shoe?&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
