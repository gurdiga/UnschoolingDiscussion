<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019342051">Let me tell you a bit about my experience with Ritalin.<br/>
<br/>
My sister has two sons.  One (let&#39;s call him &quot;Ralph&quot;) is exceedingly<br/>
bright, active, and friendly.  The other (&quot;Tommy&quot;) is also active,<br/>
exceptionally curious and athletic, but a a bit of a discipline problem.<br/>
The most notable was that he would frequently awake in the night and raid<br/>
the refrigerator, and tear up stuff.<br/>
<br/>
She was told to put them on Ritalin, which she did, for years.  It turned<br/>
them into zombies.  The spark faded from their eyes when they were on that<br/>
drug, and they appeared listless.  Their voices even changed -- gone was<br/>
the confident, fully-charged lungs voice they used when sober.  That was<br/>
replaced with a light, airy, cracking and timid voice.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, I did not like what she was willingly doing to her<br/>
innocent little boys.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I took them on a week&#39;s vacation, and we swore that they would<br/>
be going cold-turkey off of those chemicals.  For a week, they didn&#39;t see<br/>
Pill One.  We marched their little butts all over creation and back, and<br/>
didn&#39;t slow down a bit to wait for them, so they HAD to keep up.  And they<br/>
did!  We hiked, made campfires, cooked out, looked for flat rocks to skip<br/>
on the stream, worried lizards and snakes and other animal life along the<br/>
streambank, and other physical activities.<br/>
<br/>
Within that week, &quot;Tommy&#39;s&quot; discipline problem was under control.  After<br/>
the second day, at each day&#39;s end, they were both begging to go to bed, and<br/>
both of them slept throughout the night without a peep.  &quot;Tommy&quot; also had<br/>
not been taught proper table manners, and at the beginning of the week, ate<br/>
like a wild animal.  We stopped that in short order, and by the end of the<br/>
week, he was proudly showing us his new skill at eating correctly and<br/>
politely.<br/>
<br/>
We knew the lessons they&#39;d learned would be unlearned when they got back<br/>
home and were put back on drugs and plunked down in front of the hypnosis<br/>
machine again, but we felt compelled to show them &quot;the other side&quot;.  Who<br/>
knows, but maybe some day they will remember the experiences and make<br/>
better choices for themselves and their children.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the biggest mistake schools make is to not match what they do<br/>
with each child to what that child needs to do.  In the case of young boys,<br/>
old schoolmasters knew what they were doing -- most of them, you just WEAR<br/>
OUT.  It is their &quot;disconnect&quot; with students that led me to vow my children<br/>
will never see the inside of a government school; and as most private<br/>
schools in many way mirror public ones, I concluded homeschooling was the<br/>
way to go.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, more specific to the below quoted post, I don&#39;t have any great love<br/>
for the forced looting of the Tobacco industry.  Those warning labels have<br/>
been on cigarettes for almost forty years now; anyone who didn&#39;t quit<br/>
smoking when they were already proven to be dangerous should have borne the<br/>
full cost of their medical treatment.  It&#39;s called &quot;responsibility&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
The use of Ritalin and other psychoactive substances is of a different<br/>
nature -- it is teachers, school administrators, doctors, lawyers, and drug<br/>
makers colluding to force innocent young boys (some girls too, but the vast<br/>
majority are young boys) to ingest a harmful chemical to make them docile<br/>
and compliant.  The boys have no choice in the matter, unlike smokers did.<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is, Just Say No to Drugs.<br/>
