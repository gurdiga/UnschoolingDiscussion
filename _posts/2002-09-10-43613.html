<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323590092"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;You definitely have my sympathy on this.  I only have one child, so he&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt;clearly not pulling this just to gain advantage over a sibling, but he&#39;s <br/>
&gt;&gt;all tears and no talk when he is upset.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ditto here. I have two kids who just shut down when they&#39;re upset. It&#39;s very <br/>
distressing because I feel very helpless when they do this. Conor tends to <br/>
close inward. Casey is just a ball of frustration that&#39;s too intense too <br/>
talk.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I must have modelled this behavior for them somewhere along the <br/>
line. :-/ I try hard to keep an eye on how I&#39;m reacting to anger, hurt and <br/>
frustration. But well, you know, I&#39;m human.<br/>
<br/>
On a positive note, Conor doeas seem to have almost grown out of this. :o) <br/>
And both of them do eventually share with me and let me comfort and help.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
