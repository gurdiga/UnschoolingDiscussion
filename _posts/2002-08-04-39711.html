Dictionary of Americanisms by John Russell Bartlett<br/>
DOVE- Dived. This word dived was very commonly used among seamen. In<br/>
England, when a swimmer makes his first leap headfirst into the water, he<br/>
is said to dive, and is spoken of having dived. But in Modern English, he<br/>
dove would have been used as the past tense of dive. Even Longfellow<br/>
makes use of this form:<br/>
&quot;Straight into the river Kwasind<br/>
Plunged as if her were an otter,<br/>
Dove as if he were a beaver,&quot; etc.<br/>
Canadian Journal, Sept. 1857 <br/>
Encyclopedic Dictionary of English Usage by Mager and Mager<br/>
Dived was preferred to dove. <br/>
A Dictionary of Modern American Usage by H.W. Horwill<br/>
Dove is the past tense of dive just like the past tense of drive is drove<br/>
(making the same sound as in drove). For example: &quot;I dove right through<br/>
the window, He dove into what proved to be a sandhole, and he dove right<br/>
toward the place where the two had disappeared from view&quot; (110). <br/>
A Dictionary of Contemporary American Usage by Bergen and Cornelia Evans<br/>
&quot;The past tense of dive is dived or dove. Dove is no longer heard in<br/>
Great Britain but it is still acceptable in the United States, where<br/>
dived strikes many people&#39;s ears as &#39;something from the Bible.&#39;&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429048220">I&#39;m from England (although I&#39;ve lived in Illinois for 14 years now). I learned in British schooling that the past tense of DIVE is DIVED. It was strange to hear the common usage of DOVE over here in the States. Maybe it is also an issue of locality. Of course there are lots of minor language adjustments needed when a Brit comes to America. One very embarrassing moment for me was when I was tutoring for a Literacy Council. My student made a mistake. My response was &quot;Just use your rubber&quot; I wish to this day that I had a picture of her face!<br/>
