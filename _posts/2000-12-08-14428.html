<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049725378">I really liked this story and as a truck driver<br/>
myself, it was VERY NICE to read a positive story<br/>
about truckers.  Believe me, alot of truckers are very<br/>
much like the ones in this story.<br/>
<br/>
Theres been alot of advertising lately that directly<br/>
or indirectly makes truckers look bad or like<br/>
&quot;killers&quot;.  Car ads show &quot;four wheelers&quot; nimbly<br/>
dodging big trucks and avoiding being slowed from<br/>
getting to their destination or being in an accident<br/>
accident, Phamacuetical companies with big trucks to<br/>
have you buy their medications for those big &quot;killer&quot;<br/>
headaches.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh<br/>
