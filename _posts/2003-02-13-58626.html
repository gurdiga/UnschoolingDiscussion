of &quot;exaggerating&quot;. And I understand hyperbole. Understand completely. <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m suggesting is that if Teresa will fly off the handle to THIS extreme <br/>
with the slightest provocation on an e-list, what&#39;s her response to a child <br/>
who&#39;s totally out of control right in front of her. <br/>
<br/>
THAT was what Sandra meant (I assume, Sandra! I apologize if I&#39;m wrong.) That <br/>
if Teresa has little self-control HERE, maybe she also has little at home. <br/>
She cannot expect change from her children if she she can&#39;t change.<br/>
<br/>
She can always just delete posts from Sandra. It&#39;s that easy.<br/>
<br/>
And what does being from ND have to do with anything?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, okay now.  First, I&#39;ve been reading along and it seems to me, <br/>
personally, that your posts are out of all proportion to anybody <br/>
elses.  When I read what I assume was your sarcastic post, well, it really <br/>
wasn&#39;t, was it.  Sarcasm as I understand it, is a form of wit intended to <br/>
make its victim the butt of ridicule.  Wit, as we all know, is a message <br/>
whose ingenuity or verbal skill has the power to evoke laughter.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s laughing and nobody&#39;s ridiculing your target.  Therefore, it <br/>
wasn&#39;t sarcastic, nor was it witty.  I hesitate to call it by its rightful <br/>
name:  Vitriol.  Bitter ill will.  Perhaps you don&#39;t realize how clearly <br/>
the bitterness comes through?  Perhaps it is the pain of your situation <br/>
speaking through?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Got a shocker for you.<br/>
My son has a mild &#39;special need&#39;.  I &#39;know&#39; it&#39;s genetic and he got it from <br/>
me (my brothers behave/d similarly.)  (and I&#39;m not suggesting anything... <br/>
I&#39;m stating it Flat Out.  It&#39;s a fact.)  Does this mean my parenting is not <br/>
involved?  That his behavior is all his problem or due to his psychological <br/>
condition?  No.<br/>
<br/>
My parenting has a very real effect on his behavior.  When I am at my <br/>
&#39;best&#39; parenting to fit his needs, he does fabulously.  When I take <br/>
shortcuts or am &#39;browned out&#39; he does worse.  So, clearly, my ability to <br/>
parent well directly affects his ability to deal with his life.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, your situation isn&#39;t mine and I&#39;ll never know what you go through <br/>
during a day.  That doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have something valid to share.<br/>
It also doesn&#39;t mean that you can come and talk trash in my, or anyone <br/>
elses direction.  That&#39;s just bad manners.<br/>

Hi Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
I hesitated to write before because my son&#39;s special needs are <br/>
different, and I haven&#39;t much experience with what you are doing.  <br/>
However, your comment above is one I have heard many times in support <br/>
groups among parents of children with ADD/ADHD, OCD, ODD, SID and Bi-<br/>
Polar disorders.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether this list is meant to be a support group (I <br/>
recall once reading that it was not, but I cannot be certain), but it <br/>
seems that you need to talk with parents who are facing similar <br/>
challenges in helping their children learn and grow.<br/>
<br/>
When your son (the older one) is calm, is he able to tell you what is <br/>
going on inside him when he loses control?  Is he able to articulate <br/>
any words or emotions that seem to trigger a violent outburst?<br/>
<br/>
Are your boys interested in jumping on trampolines, or working out <br/>
with a punching bag?  My neighbor has an 11-year old son with ADHD <br/>
and Asbergers who has frequent outbursts, and she lets him work out <br/>
the frustration that way.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when the emotional eruptions happen, are you able to use any <br/>
diversionary tactics?  For example, when my ds-10 was younger, <br/>
whenever he would lose his temper, I would burst into singing &quot;Stop <br/>
In the Name of Love&quot;...an old Temptations song.  It always made him <br/>
laugh, and it would break the escalating temper tantrum.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you find the information you need to help your sons and <br/>
youself.<br/>
<br/>

whatever you&#39;re getting from the list, I can put you on Moderated status and<br/>
do the filtering for you.<br/>
<br/>
It will be a PITA for you because your posts will be delayed until I can get<br/>
around to reading them, which often I can only do in the morning. It will be<br/>
a PITA for me to have to take that extra time.<br/>
<br/>
I will accept the next punch you throw as a request for moderation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
After I wrote this last night, I remembered that there is a group <br/>
specifically for parents with children affected by SID.  It&#39;s here on <br/>
Yahoogroups, so I&#39;m sure a search will bring it up.  It&#39;s a very <br/>
large group, though.  I&#39;m not a member, although I know several <br/>
people who have found information and support there.  Also, there is <br/>
another Yahoogroup for parents homeschooling children with special <br/>
needs.  I&#39;m a member of that group, and it has been enormously <br/>
helpful; the range of disabilities in children is well-represented <br/>
among the members, from the mild to the more severe.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I wish you well.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think  the hard thing is, for parents of &quot;special&quot; kids who <br/>
unschool, that the typical support groups are all about dealing with <br/>
the school system and pressures of school, IEPs and SEPs and bullies <br/>
and SpEd classrooms. And this list is all about unschooling, but <br/>
maybe people don&#39;t fully understand special-needs kids here. So <br/>
there&#39;s no real perfect place to get advice about it, but this list <br/>
is definitely better than most mainstream special needs lists.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think <br/>
that the recent thread on special needs kids has really helped me out <br/>
a lot. There are obviously moms here who deal with this double-issue <br/>
of unschooling and a child whose brain doesn&#39;t exactly work in the <br/>
same way as most. And making unschooling work can be more challenging <br/>
with a child who is so out-of-sync that sometimes there is no way <br/>
that makes sense. Helping them find their path is harder when the <br/>
path is more hidden. With my &quot;normal&quot; kid (god, I hate using that <br/>
word, but for clarity), all is so straightforward. I can easily see <br/>
that if I had two or more kids just like her, I would feel like I had <br/>
all the answers. It&#39;s my special kid who teaches me that I don&#39;t, and <br/>
challenges me to find the path of respect, even when it&#39;s much, much, <br/>
much more difficult. <br/>
My post about the haircutting incident is an example. *I* don&#39;t model <br/>
having a problem with haircut. No one else in our family models this. <br/>
It&#39;s my son&#39;s internal brain wiring that triggers fight-or-flight <br/>
responses that would be more appropriate if, say, we were threatening <br/>
to burn him with hot irons or something. That&#39;s the level of response <br/>
his body accelerates to quickly when faced with a seemingly &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
stimulus. <br/>
<br/>
To the poster with the boys who throw tantrums, I would suggest <br/>
reading &quot;The Out-Of-Sync child&quot;, which has been mentioned here a <br/>
couple of times. While that might not be any part of the issue, it <br/>
might. To a typical eye, it might look like my son is throwing a <br/>
tantrum in response to something like getting his hair cut. But in <br/>
reality, it&#39;s a bodily physical response to a perceived threat. It&#39;s <br/>
just that his brain perceives things as threats that most people <br/>
don&#39;t - being touched or hugged, hair brushing, teeth brushing, <br/>
unusual surfaces or clothing. So that might be part of the issue. <br/>
Maybe the frustrations of living in a body that always feels &quot;out of <br/>
sync&quot; boil over. My son used to get frustrated over things that most <br/>
people would consider easy - dressing, walking, sitting in a chair. <br/>
Helping him, through exercises we do at home, and through outside <br/>
occupational therapy, through therapeutic horseback riding and many <br/>
other things, his brain is largely re-wired so that these things no <br/>
longer cause daily frustrations. The book &quot;The Out-Of-Sync child&quot; was <br/>
a real eye-opening life-saver for us in understanding our son.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also say to other people that in responding to a post from <br/>
someone with a special-needs kid, take a step back first and see if <br/>
what you&#39;re saying is really going to be helpful to that mom. <br/>
Remember, a parent of a kid like this faces untold stress on a daily <br/>
basis, things that parents of &quot;normal&quot; kids cannot even guess at.<br/>
<br/>
What if when you woke up in the morning, your child had trouble with <br/>
waking up (light is too bright, causing a &quot;tantrummy&quot; physical <br/>
reaction), then with eating (all foods are too crunchy, too soggy, <br/>
too crumbly, too whatever), then with getting dressed (changing to a <br/>
new texture of clothes is too irritating), then with going to the <br/>
bathroom, then with... well the list goes on. By 11:00 am, you&#39;re <br/>
exhausted! Sure, some of these things are helped immensely with an <br/>
unschooling frame of mind. For instance, while clothing textures were <br/>
a problem, our son simply slept in the same clothes he wore all day. <br/>
He didn&#39;t wear pajamas for years. Not having preconceived notions and <br/>
power struggles can take you a long ways, but it can&#39;t take you ALL <br/>
the way, you still have to deal with SO MUCH. It&#39;s hard to explain. <br/>
Also, this parent of the special kid faces daily the disapproval of <br/>
other parents. Surely the tantrums and behavior are her fault, the <br/>
product of her bad mothering skills. Perhaps he&#39;s clingy because she <br/>
doesn&#39;t put him in daycare, or he&#39;s still nursing. They don&#39;t <br/>
understand the overwhelming sensory input that&#39;s causing him to bury <br/>
his head in your pantleg. Then, she&#39;s an unschooling parent so she <br/>
gets another double-whammy. Not only are the kid&#39;s &quot;different&quot; <br/>
behaviors the fault of her bad parenting, but of her choice to not <br/>
put him in school. Somehow school would &quot;socialize&quot; him better, right?<br/>
<br/>
So then, this list might be a good place for such a parent to maybe <br/>
get some helpful input from other folks who not only *unschool* but <br/>
unschool a special-needs kid. And let&#39;s give that over-taxed mom of <br/>
the special kid a break when maybe her fingers fly a little too fast <br/>
in defensive-mode on the keyboard when someone suggests that her kids <br/>
tantrums are her fault. You see, she&#39;s heard it so many times before.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058252264">Your day-in-the-life description was great.<br/>
<br/>
One thing maybe people also need to remember is that many of us DO have <br/>
kids like that, but we don&#39;t call them &quot;special needs&quot; kids. They&#39;re <br/>
just our kids. If kids don&#39;t go to school - they don&#39;t get labeled and <br/>
we just move on with our lives and do what it takes to raise our own <br/>
particular kids. There are definitely kids who are EASIER to raise than <br/>
other kids - no doubt about that!!!!!!!!! But - I&#39;d just caution about <br/>
assuming that those of us who don&#39;t claim to have &quot;special needs&quot; kids <br/>
don&#39;t know about raising our own difficult kids.<br/>
<br/>
One problem is that if somebody&#39;s parenting worked really well - then <br/>
their kids don&#39;t appear nearly as &quot;difficult&quot; by the time they are into <br/>
their teens - so they get dismissed as not knowing what they are <br/>
talking about and as if they don&#39;t know what it is &quot;really&quot; like to <br/>
live with these kids. Sandra and I are probably both in that situation <br/>
- I remember what Kirby was like as a littler kid and I know what my <br/>
now-15 yo, Roxana, was like. I am very much convinced that if we&#39;d been <br/>
different parents, we&#39;d have had them labeled and maybe medicated and <br/>
we&#39;d have been over on the special needs lists commiserating with other <br/>
parents about how hard our lives were. But we listened to unschooling <br/>
ideas and lived outside the &quot;special needs&quot; box and now there is no way <br/>
of knowing if the way they are now was due to our parenting choices or <br/>
just the kids maturing or anything else. All I know is that, over and <br/>
over, my ideas have been dismissed by &quot;special needs&quot; parents who look <br/>
at my older kids and say I don&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about since I <br/>
don&#39;t have a special needs kid. The advice of anybody - whose kids end <br/>
up happy and functioning and seeming to be relatively &quot;normal&quot; is <br/>
tossed out as not relevant.<br/>

<br/>
I was in a discussion about giftedness once and because I was unwilling to <br/>
report my test scores or IQ or whatever they wanted, but wanted to talk about <br/>
the problems with setting kids apart based on JUST early verbal ability, I <br/>
was told that obviously I knew nothing about giftedness, and so to butt out <br/>
of their important discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
I could have gotten in by showing them proofs or telling them stories about <br/>
my kids, or whatever, but I didn&#39;t WANT in.  If they were only going to <br/>
listen to someone they considered &quot;more gifted&quot; than they considered <br/>
themselves or their kids to be, they were lost causes anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Same with education. It&#39;s a problem when people only want unschooling advice <br/>
from people who are or were once certified teachers, or only want to believe <br/>
&quot;scientific studies&quot; (and if you&#39;ve read many of the reports on which people <br/>
get masters and doctoral degrees in education, you&#39;ll know always to use <br/>
quotation marks on &quot;scientific studies&quot; as regards education).  <br/>
Do I show them my papers so they&#39;ll  listen to me that people don&#39;t need <br/>
papers?  <br/>
Do I show &quot;proof of giftedness&quot; to get people to believe that it&#39;s a bad <br/>
thing to have such &quot;proofs&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But no one suggested that. Sandra suggested a genetic component to the <br/>
problem. That isn&#39;t unknown of or blaming the parent when dealing with <br/>
these kinds of symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
While you make a good case, in general, for being sensitive to a <br/>
parent&#39;s pain, is this really what is the best focus? Looking at it from <br/>
the parent&#39;s point of view, sure. But from the child&#39;s? I don&#39;t think a <br/>
label or a focus on what is &quot;wrong&quot; would have helped me to be a better <br/>
parent, or more kind, or more generous and understanding of the very <br/>
different way my youngest responds to the world. If I would have focused <br/>
on my needs, rather than hers, I know in my heart that her developing <br/>
trust in me and the world would have suffered and in the long run that <br/>
trust would have to be reestablished before she would have been able get <br/>
beyond the very behaviors that were causing the problems. Getting to the <br/>
heart of problems helps in solutions, while finding ways to avoid <br/>
looking at them doesn&#39;t, and prolongs the suffering of everyone involved.<br/>
<br/>
Many of us were socialized as children to please others and when we <br/>
&quot;face the disapproval of other parents&quot; we might have the strength or <br/>
the will to stand firm in supporting our children&#39;s &#39;differences&#39; or <br/>
maybe we won&#39;t. Especially when the behaviors seem to reflect badly on <br/>
our methods of parenting. Maybe we try to change our child rather than <br/>
honor or respect their needs in the face of disapproval.  Maybe it <br/>
backfires and the symptoms of &#39;dis&#39; ease get worse and we feel guilty <br/>
and angry and sad that we tried to be a pleaser rather than stand up for <br/>
our kid&#39;s rights and it *still* didn&#39;t work and we have an even *less* <br/>
pleasing child. I know I&#39;ve backed down at times in supporting my child <br/>
and hated myself afterward for wanting to please or accommodate others <br/>
in the face of disapproval rather than stand up for my child.<br/>
<br/>
I think we can get bogged down in diagnoses and labels of behaviors and <br/>
that can get in the way of the actions we need to take, today, to make <br/>
the changes our children need from us. Maybe some people have a harder <br/>
time than others of letting of the dreams they had or the fantasy they <br/>
imagined life would be with their children when it turns out <br/>
differently. Should we support them in keeping that fantasy alive or <br/>
should we help them gain insights that could change their current <br/>
unhappy reality?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the &quot;special needs&quot; vs. &quot;normal&quot; paradigm is false. It&#39;s all a<br/>
continuum, and the fit between the child and his environment seems to<br/>
make the most difference, IME. <br/>
<br/>
When Rain was 4 or so she insisted on wearing socks all the time. She<br/>
slept in socks, she wore socks with sandals, she went swimming with socks<br/>
on sometimes. She just couldn&#39;t bear the feeling of anything on her feet<br/>
except socks (and not ust any socks, but that&#39;s another story).<br/>
<br/>
When she was 5 and 6 she would get angry at me for things that had<br/>
happened years ago (things that hadn&#39;t been as issue when they<br/>
happened... she&#39;d just latch on to something) and rage for an hour or<br/>
more, kicking, spitting, hitting... and she was a big kid, 60 pounds or<br/>
so. I felt like I was walking on eggshells for a year or more, to keep<br/>
from setting her off, and it didn&#39;t help that I had such a hard time<br/>
figuring out what was *really* setting her off. <br/>
<br/>
I worked as a special ed teacher, with kids who had been labeled as<br/>
having emotional and behavioral disabilities. A lot of what I saw with<br/>
them was the same kind of stuff I saw with Rain during some stages - and<br/>
in both cases, when I was able to change the environment the kids had an<br/>
easier time, although it didn&#39;t happen right away and it wasn&#39;t perfect.<br/>
Still, it helps me to just think of all of the kids in my life as<br/>
individuals, and see what they need. It seems odd to me to do things any<br/>
other way.<br/>
<br/>
Rain is incredibly easy to live with now, which blows my mind ever time I<br/>
think of her at 6. OTOH, there are a couple of kids in the play she&#39;s<br/>
doing now who would probably be labeled in a school setting. One needs a<br/>
partner, because she has a harder time learning to steps and remembering<br/>
where to go when. The other needs more responsibilities, because if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have something to do, he finds himself something, and it&#39;s not<br/>
always a helpful thing. So he&#39;s the one the rest of the ensemble takes<br/>
their cues from; he leads them on and off stage. He also had trouble with<br/>
how his costume felt, so we were able to switch his for a different one<br/>
(they all look the same to me, but clearly they feel different).<br/>
<br/>
Some of the other kids in the show need different kinds of help. The<br/>
youngest kids are 5 and 6, and they need more help with their<br/>
costumes.The oldest are 13 and 14, and they need more privacy when<br/>
changing. There are 18 kids in the group, and I think they&#39;re all having<br/>
fun, and getting what they need.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to deny that some kids are easier to parent than others, or,<br/>
to be more specific, some kids are easier for some parents at some times.<br/>
Rain rarely wears pajamas and I&#39;ve never much cared; she also (until<br/>
maybe a year ago) wore the same beloved clothes for years, even though<br/>
they had holes and stains. For me, and for our life, that wasn&#39;t an<br/>
issue. OTOH, I get easily overwhelmed by sound, and kids who talk their<br/>
way through things as they figure them out really wear me out. I can deal<br/>
with it when it&#39;s a friend over for the afternoon, but if my kid was like<br/>
that it would be a problem for us. Having a baby who cried when she was<br/>
set down and cried if she wasn&#39;t held the &quot;right&quot; way (upright and facing<br/>
out) wore me out, but back then I didn&#39;t know there were actually babies<br/>
you could put down, and I was so glad she wasn&#39;t like my sister, who had<br/>
colic and cried for 4 hours a day no matter what we did. <br/>

special needs.  Even that list cannot provide much unschooling help, <br/>
though.  There are a few unschoolers on the list, but not many.  I <br/>
find that parents homeschooling children with special needs are more <br/>
likely to &quot;let go&quot; of the school model; most of them turn to <br/>
homeschooling because the school has failed, and many are willing to <br/>
try anything that is NOT school.<br/>

my son and for my other children.  I don&#39;t &quot;expect&quot; him to achieve <br/>
anything, or to meet any goals.  He will learn what he wants to <br/>
learn, and he will work toward his own goals.  I just want him to be <br/>
happy.  I will help him in any way I can, and that is usually finding <br/>
or adapting toys for him to play with, making books that he can see, <br/>
covering walls with different textures to feel, etc.  Once my <br/>
thinking adjusted for my youngest child, I began to see my other <br/>
children differently, also.<br/>
<br/>
The only advice I give to other mothers of children with special <br/>
needs, it is to stop trying to &quot;fix&quot; your child, and start loving <br/>
your child unconditionally - really, truly, unconditionally.  <br/>
Unfortunately, when I discuss homeschooling a child with special <br/>
needs with other parents, I hear comments &quot;if I can get her to stop <br/>
doing this,&quot; or &quot;tell me how to make him do this...&quot;.  Granted, it&#39;s <br/>
hard to love unconditionally in the moment when your child is biting <br/>
you REALLY HARD because he is frustrated and non-verbal, but dislodge <br/>
his teeth from your arm, step back, breathe, and remember that he IS <br/>
communicating with you; and love him enough to swallow your own <br/>
frustration and focus on his frustration, instead.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261177169">I know that, Debbie.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that I, personally, have a kid who could easily have put me <br/>
over there doing that, too. But there is no way for me to convince <br/>
anybody of that, now that she&#39;s a 15 yo who comes across as happy, <br/>
calm, well-behaved, interesting, and relatively &quot;normal.&quot; (She&#39;s still <br/>
certainly not your everyday 15 yo, though, but that&#39;s another story.)<br/>
<br/>
My point was that some people automatically dismiss advice or ideas <br/>
from people who have kids who don&#39;t appear to be &quot;special needs&quot; - but <br/>
that might just mean they are excluding advice from the very people who <br/>
have been most successful at parenting kids most like their own.<br/>
<br/>
Roxana was very explosive, very angry, very difficult. She is still <br/>
dramatic and extremely sensitive and has quite a temper - but she is <br/>
also a wonderful wonderful person who is fun to be around and <br/>
functions, at 15, extremely well - she&#39;s in theater groups and takes <br/>
college courses and so on. Maybe I had NOTHING to do with how she&#39;s <br/>
grown up - it is true that people who knew her well, all those years, <br/>
comment frequently how lucky she was to have had me as her mom - but <br/>
maybe they are totally wrong and she&#39;d have been just fine no matter <br/>
how she was parented. I&#39;m too vested to believe that, of course &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Again, my point was that I didn&#39;t exclude people whose kids were in <br/>
great shape from the pool of people I&#39;d gladly listen to - and I&#39;m glad <br/>
I didn&#39;t because, looking back, the unschooling life has been <br/>
absolutely the very very best gift I could have EVER given Roxana.<br/>

few of those too.. But, they don&#39;t advocate unschooling..  Most folks dealing <br/>
with special needs children try to follow a structure and to carefully <br/>
control the childs environment  When Mary and Anne came on this group and <br/>
offered advice, support and suggestions for unschooling special needs kids <br/>
(as they do it quite successfully), I thought perhaps I could pick thier <br/>
brains.   Honestly, I guess there needs to be a seperate group for <br/>
unschooling special needs children.   There is just too much emotion and <br/>
misunderstanding to discuss it here.<br/>

typical kids who gave me some great advice on a problem with Kevin&#39;s <br/>
dental care.  Kevin doesn&#39;t eat, but dental hygiene is still <br/>
important for him, especially because his chemotherapy affected his <br/>
tooth enamel.  I tried modeling tooth-brushing for him; I tried every <br/>
type of toothbrush head I could find, from extra soft to extra firm; <br/>
I tried using an grip-adaptor on his hand so he could hold the <br/>
toothbrush himself (and he nearly put my eye out with the <br/>
toothbrush!); but none of this worked.  I refused to restrain him <br/>
against his will to clean his teeth, but I was at a loss.  This mom <br/>
suggested I try a vibrating toothbrush.  The vibrations fascinated <br/>
Kevin so much he let me put the toothbrush into his mouth; and it was <br/>
a start.  As the days passed, he became more comfortable with the <br/>
toothbrush, and gradually I began to move the brush over his teeth.  <br/>
That was over a year ago, and today Kevin cheerfully lets me brush <br/>
his teeth every morning and night...using a vibrating toothbrush, of <br/>
course! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

However, I do think it is helpful, in this world of words typed on a <br/>

would have to type out some lengthy description/disclaimer each <br/>
time. I *do* think that there are kids out there who, for whatever <br/>
reason, offer challenges that are on the extreme ends of the <br/>
spectrum. And I also think it is helpful if people, whether they <br/>
believe in saying their kids are special needs or different or <br/>
whatever, can share their experiences in dealing with these extremes <br/>
specifically. Especially people who have older kids who can see <br/>
further around the bend than some of us who are still parenting <br/>
quite young children. I do have faith that what I am doing is the <br/>
right way to help my kids each keep and explore their own unique way <br/>
of being in this world, but it still helps to hear from the other <br/>
end of the age spectrum that yes, this is true.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While I totally agree that there is a continuum, I do think it&#39;s <br/>
more convenient (for the sake of discussions here, not for the sake <br/>
of the way I think of or talk to my kid at home) to have some sort <br/>
of way of referring to kids who are on the extreme end of the <br/>
spectrum (and I don&#39;t mean &quot;spectrum&quot; to refer to autism as it <br/>
currently does these days, but just the spectrum of human behavior).<br/>
Insisting on wearing shoes all day is somewhere on the continuum. <br/>
Not being able to walk across any surface without severe discomfort <br/>
is on the extreme end. Being sensitive to light is one thing. Not <br/>
being able to go out of a darkened house is on the extreme end. <br/>
Parenting the extreme can be exhausting and difficult, and I do <br/>
think it helps to be able to talk about it and listen to others who <br/>
have found ways to parent these extreme kids and still respect them. <br/>
Especially because most of the literature, support groups, etc. out <br/>
there is not child-respecting, concentrates more on the labels than <br/>
on the individual kids, and is usually mostly concerned with <br/>
navigating the school system.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, for me it really helped to hear about the &quot;label&quot; (which <br/>
in our case was SID) because it helped me to understand the ways in <br/>
which the intense reactions to stimulus in kids who are on the <br/>
extreme end of the sensory integration continuum come through in <br/>
their behavior. It helped me to understand the things I could change <br/>
in our environment that made a big difference. Otherwise, I might <br/>
not have know that a child who hated any kind of touch would <br/>
actually crave deep touch - voila, I tried it and it worked for my <br/>
kid. I do think that the sharing of ways in which people have <br/>
parented, and most especially shared an unschooling life with, their <br/>
extreme kids can be really helpful to others who are on the early <br/>
part of that journey.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that in a way, the &quot;label&quot; can help a child understand <br/>
themselves. I too have some extreme sensory issues, and I have a <br/>
very clear memory of believing as a child that I was an alien from <br/>
another planet who had come to earth and inhabited a human body, and <br/>
was adopted by my parents. I had no other way to explain why I felt <br/>
and saw and heard things so differently from other humans. I&#39;m glad <br/>
that I can explain to my child a little more plainly why, exactly, <br/>
his body feels so different from others, and the things we can work <br/>
on that will make it easier for him. At least maybe he&#39;ll never feel <br/>
like he&#39;s a martian.<br/>

often have to put my hands up in a &quot;T&quot; for &quot;Timeout&quot; gesture and <br/>
tell them I can no longer understand anything they&#39;re saying, <br/>
because my noise overload sensors have gone off. Does anyone <br/>
remember that song in the musical Godspell, where two guys are <br/>
singing two different songs at the same time?? That&#39;s what it&#39;s like <br/>
around here, talk central :-)<br/>

outburst on the list, then she was surely teaching those kids to <br/>
have tantrums at home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just saying that a parent who deals with the intensity of this <br/>
kind of child on a daily basis might be a little more inclined to be <br/>
defensive, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that is the way she <br/>
acts with her own children at home.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course, I do think we should be focusing on how to help this <br/>
parent find ways to do things that improve life for the kid. Like <br/>
many of the responses that discussed ways the environment could be <br/>
changed, the addition of a trampoline or punching bag, that sort of <br/>
thing. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now see, I feel very differently. I found that in finding a label <br/>
for my very different child, I found a whole body of literature that <br/>
discussed how things I could change in our environment would really <br/>
help him out. And many of those things were not things I would&#39;ve <br/>
thought of intuitively myself! I might not have set up sensory <br/>
tables and obstacle courses and tried &quot;the kid sandwich&quot; if I hadn&#39;t <br/>
found the label, and thus the resources to help my kid. And this was <br/>
a kid whose &quot;specialness&quot; was making his own life very difficult. <br/>
All I wanted to do was to find ways to make it better and easier for <br/>
him.<br/>

<br/>
I agree. I don&#39;t think I was suggesting we focus on the mother&#39;s <br/>
needs and not the child&#39;s. But I do think that some of the posters <br/>
went overboard in the way they approached the situation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should we support them in keeping that fantasy alive or <br/>
&gt; should we help them gain insights that could change their current <br/>
&gt; unhappy reality?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s a way of helping them gain insights that doesn&#39;t <br/>
necessitate being sarcastic about the way they parent based on one <br/>
post where they were upset. There are lots of people on this list <br/>
who post excellent advice without descending to that, and many of <br/>
those people responded to the original poster in this thread. Now, <br/>
sure, she did go overboard with the sarcasm in response to Sandra&#39;s <br/>
post. But everyone gets their hackles up every now and then, and <br/>
someone who is dealing daily with the situation she described <br/>
probably has very little patience to go around if she&#39;s <br/>
concentrating on giving that much of it to her kids. So I just was <br/>
saying let&#39;s be a little kind in our responses. Especially those of <br/>
us who don&#39;t have kids are anywhere near that challenging. It&#39;s hard <br/>
to know how extreme the daily life of someone is who is living that <br/>
reality. We don&#39;t need to coddle someone, but we also don&#39;t need to <br/>
add to their discomfort.<br/>

&gt; One thing maybe people also need to remember is that many of us DO have<br/>
&gt; kids like that, but we don&#39;t call them &quot;special needs&quot; kids. They&#39;re<br/>
&gt; just our kids. If kids don&#39;t go to school - they don&#39;t get labeled and<br/>
&gt; we just move on with our lives and do what it takes to raise our own<br/>
&gt; particular kids. There are definitely kids who are EASIER to raise than<br/>
&gt; other kids - no doubt about that!!!!!!!!! But - I&#39;d just caution about<br/>
&gt; assuming that those of us who don&#39;t claim to have &quot;special needs&quot; kids<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know about raising our own difficult kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You just said what I was thinking. One of my kids was labelled autistic at school. One of the others would be labelled ADHD.<br/>
Luckily they ain&#39;t at school any more so now they are just people, one of whom has a unique way of looking at the world.<br/>
