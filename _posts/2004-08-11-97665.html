When people go to school or take lessons they lose control of the agenda of=<br/>
 their <br/>
curiosity. Teachers take over the subject and timing of learning. The indiv=<br/>
idual&#39;s curiosity <br/>
no longer leads. In some places it counts for nothing. No matter who we are=<br/>
, how good or <br/>
bad a student we are, the natural instincts of our own curiosity suffered m=<br/>
any bruises.<br/>
<br/>
In a real sense, the pleasures and rewards of satisfying our curiosity were=<br/>
 taken away from <br/>
us. School is not about rewarding our own curiosity, it&#39;s about learning wh=<br/>
at others want <br/>
us to learn; it&#39;s about pleasing teachers. If we were successful in school =<br/>
the one thing we <br/>
had to learn was to make teachers happy enough to give us good grades. We m=<br/>
ay or may <br/>
not have learned things interesting to us, but that wasn&#39;t the point. Succe=<br/>
ssful students <br/>
must please enough teachers to get enough good grades to continue in the pr=<br/>
ocess.<br/>
<br/>
Then, having already lost the agenda and rewards of our own curiosity, we c=<br/>
ome to believe <br/>
that pleasing the teacher is the same as pleasing ourselves. We substitute =<br/>
learning how we <br/>
want with learning the way that will make the teacher happy. We think pleas=<br/>
ing the teacher <br/>
is the same as pleasing ourselves. It isn&#39;t. That&#39;s why so many straight &quot;A=<br/>
&quot; students are <br/>
unfulfilled by their accomplishment. They feel a void. They&#39;ve become so ad=<br/>
ept at pleasing <br/>
other people that they forget they have a self that needs being pleased.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You would not believe how difficult it is to get adult students to be pleas=<br/>
ed with their <br/>
work. It wasn&#39;t until I started listening to them talk to themselves that I=<br/>
 really began to <br/>
realize how much their past education had taken from them. When they make m=<br/>
istakes <br/>
they say things like: &quot;That was stupid,&quot; &quot;What are you thinking of?&quot; or &quot;Oh=<br/>
, my God.&quot; The <br/>
condescension in their voices is impressive. They are not talking to themse=<br/>
lves with their <br/>
own voices; they are talking to themselves with the voices of past teachers=<br/>
 and parents. <br/>
Ponder the enormity of this. They have become their own attackers. When did=<br/>
 they <br/>
abandon themselves and join the accusers? Who is left to defend them?<br/>
<br/>
{snip}<br/>
<br/>
People do not understand that being a teacher&#39;s best student can bring with=<br/>
 it a number of <br/>
disadvantages. Educational problems are always assumed to be the domain of =<br/>
lesser <br/>
students, but there is a whole raft of problems the really good students ex=<br/>
perience. <br/>
Teachers push them too fast and too far, beyond what they can really experi=<br/>
ence. <br/>
Teachers become possessive of the student and the student&#39;s accomplishment.=<br/>
 Teachers <br/>
over-identify with their best students, especially if the former don&#39;t have=<br/>
 a fulfilling life of <br/>
their own. Actually, this subject is a whole other talk.<br/>
