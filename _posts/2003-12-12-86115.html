THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS <br/>

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced <br/>
frivolity, but because it&#39;s the season when the food police come out with <br/>
their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the holidays <br/>
without gaining 10 pounds. You can&#39;t pick up a magazine without finding a <br/>
list of holiday eating do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. Eliminate second helpings, high-calorie <br/>
sauces and cookies made with butter, they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, <br/>
they say. Good grief. Is your favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot <br/>
stick? I don&#39;t think so. Isn&#39;t mine, either. A <br/>
carrot was something you left for Rudolph. I have my own list of tips for <br/>
holiday eating. I assure you, if you follow them, you&#39;ll be fat and happy. <br/>
So what if you don&#39;t make it to New Year&#39;s? Your pants won&#39;t fit anymore, <br/>
anyway. <br/>
<br/>
1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on a <br/>
holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In fact, if you see <br/>
carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where they&#39;re serving rum balls. <br/>
<br/>
2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine single-malt <br/>
scotch, it&#39;s rare. In fact, it&#39;s even rarer than single-malt scotch. You can&#39;t find <br/>
it any other time of year but now. So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 <br/>
calories in every sip? It&#39;s not as if you&#39;re going to turn into an <br/>
eggnog-aholic or something. It&#39;s a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It&#39;s later <br/>
than you think. It&#39;s Christmas! <br/>
<br/>
3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That&#39;s the whole point of gravy. <br/>
Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill it with gravy. Eat <br/>
the volcano. Repeat. <br/>
<br/>
4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they&#39;re made with skim milk or whole <br/>
milk. If it&#39;s skim, pass. Why bother? It&#39;s like buying a sports car with an <br/>
automatic transmission. <br/>
<br/>
5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control your <br/>
eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat other people&#39;s <br/>
food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? <br/>
<br/>
6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New Year&#39;s. You <br/>
can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. This is the time for <br/>
long naps, which you&#39;ll need after circling the buffet table while carrying a <br/>
10-pound plate of food and that vat of eggnog. <br/>
<br/>
7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like frosted <br/>
Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position yourself near them <br/>
and don&#39;t budge. Have as many as you can before becoming the center of <br/>
attention. They&#39;re like a beautiful pair of shoes.You can&#39;t leave them behind. You&#39;re <br/>
not going to see them again. <br/>
<br/>
8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. Or, if you <br/>
don&#39;t like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. Always have three. <br/>
When else do you get to have more than one dessert? Labor Day? <br/>
<br/>
9. Did someone mention fruit cake? Granted, it&#39;s loaded with the mandatory <br/>
celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, have some standards, <br/>
mate. <br/>
<br/>
10. And one final tip: If you don&#39;t feel terrible when you leave the party or <br/>
get up from the table, you haven&#39;t been paying attention. Reread tips. Start <br/>
over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just around the corner.  <br/>
