<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241538430">-=-=-Check into group health insurance through groups you might belong to - credit unions, for example. Again, make that your job to figure out a way to have health insurance. Maybe a part-time job with fewer hours that gives you an option to buy into a health insurance program. Do some research.-=-=-=-<br/>
