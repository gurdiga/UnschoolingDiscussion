<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791641344">Did anyone happen to catch ZOOM today on PBS???  It&#39;s on righ now, here, and <br/>
they are talking about homeschoolers.  The family shown did the whole report <br/>
card thing, etc. but it was interesting, to say the least.  During the round <br/>
table, the kids were discussing homeschooling and I swear one of those <br/>
girls, for sure, had to have been coached  as to what to say.  She talked <br/>
about friends and the whole socialization scare.  Although one boy did say <br/>
he wasn&#39;t a big fan of school and how cool it would be to be able to wake up <br/>
and go, &quot;Hey Mom, I saw this really cool thing on tv last night and I&#39;d like <br/>
to learn more about it!&quot;  There was a lot of discussion focused on the extra <br/>
attention children get.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m blabbing, but was interested if any of you happened to catch it.  My <br/>
kids came and got me to tell me about it, so I ran in and we watched it <br/>
together!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26151380">thanks!  <br/>
We have 25 minutes of the show left.  Holly&#39;s off at the park playing with <br/>
other homeschoolers, but I threw a tape on to record in her room.  She loves <br/>
ZOOM.</div>
