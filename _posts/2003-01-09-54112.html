<div id="ygrps-yiv-73909037">I went to the unschooling.com website and read a lot about unschooling.  I <br/>
think I&#39;m understanding more about it.<br/>
<br/>
My big concern with the unschooling way of life was my thought that children <br/>
would grow up very selfish, not care about anyone else&#39;s feelings, have lots <br/>
of cavaties, be very sick from only eating candy and cookies, and be hard to <br/>
deal with.  I know now how ignorant I was when thinking this.  I didn&#39;t think <br/>
that kids would grow up this way because than why would unschoolers do this, <br/>
but I thought how could they not?  A quote I read helped me understand this.  <br/>
The quote is &quot;When I require something of my children, it is usually becasue <br/>
there is an immediate and very real *need* for it-to keep them healthy and <br/>
safe, to keep the family functioning, to respect someone else&#39;s needs or <br/>
feelings, ect.&quot;  This quote may not be how all unschoolers think, but it <br/>
makes sense to me.  Right now my children love to brush their teeth, comb <br/>
their hair, help with chores.  I know this will not always be the case.  As <br/>
they grow older and understand more, I can let go of things and let them make <br/>
their own decisions.  Right now my kids are only 3 and 4 so they are too <br/>
young to really understand that if they never brush their teeth, they&#39;ll get <br/>
cavaties, gum disease, etc.  Even if I explain to them what that means, they <br/>
don&#39;t understand.  When they are able to understand the choices, then they <br/>
can begin to make decisions.  As my children get older and older, they can <br/>
begin to make more and more decisions, like staying up until midnight if they <br/>
want to do that.  Another thing I read and agree with is that parents should <br/>
respect their children&#39;s needs, feelings and desires.  Although it may seem <br/>
like coersion to some, parents should not expect children to make decisions <br/>
and suffer the consequences if the children are not experienced or don&#39;t <br/>
really understand the consequences.<br/>
<br/>
This is something I&#39;ll add about someone I know who was able to do whatever <br/>
she wanted at too young of an age.  The little girl was young and was not <br/>
required to brush her teeth, eat healthy foods if she didn&#39;t want to.  When I <br/>
mean young, I mean toddler and up.  Her teeth are rotting out of her head all <br/>
ready and she&#39;s only 14.  Even though she sees a dentist on a regular basis, <br/>
it&#39;s not enough to combat all the junk food and neglect.  At first I thought, <br/>
is this what unschoolers mean?  Let children do whatever they want all the <br/>
time, even if they really don&#39;t understand the consequences?  Most children <br/>
could care less about what might happen in the future.  Most children only <br/>
think of the present.  Maybe they think this way because they were never <br/>
taught how to make decisions, they were never given the responsibility to <br/>
make decisions when they were mature enough, and they were never explained <br/>
why but only given orders?  We often hear that teenagers are too young to <br/>
make important decisions because many are not mature enough to think about <br/>
the consequences, which is in the future.  Many young teens begin to smoke, <br/>
but they really don&#39;t think about what that means, ie. they stink, their <br/>
teeth may turn yellow, they can spend the money on something else that they&#39;d <br/>
want to do or have, and it&#39;s not good for their health.  I know none of the <br/>
kids in my family smoked or did drugs.  It&#39;s not because my parents were <br/>
strict or forbade us, it&#39;s because they taught us how to make decisions and <br/>
really think about things and their consequences before doing them.  I never <br/>
had a curfew, I was never grounded, I was never punished (even after wrecking <br/>
my parents car for playing around on the road).  They never needed to do <br/>
those things.  My friends were very surprised I didn&#39;t get into trouble for <br/>
wrecking the car.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m still not understanding unschooling, or I&#39;m a little wrong, please let <br/>
me know.  I think I&#39;m starting to get it.<br/>

<br/>
It might be.<br/>
If you treat them with joyful respect, why would they want to change the <br/>
things they enjoy doing?<br/>
<br/>
Unless there&#39;s spite or avoidance involved, they can keep having fun for a <br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t quite understand this part.<br/>
<br/>
Kids make decisions within the contexts of their own real everyday lives.  No <br/>
glaring big lifelong decisions are likely to jump out at them.  Just the <br/>
everyday stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s not because my parents were <br/>
strict or forbade us, it&#39;s because they taught us how to make decisions and <br/>
really think about things and their consequences before doing them.  I never <br/>
had a curfew, I was never grounded, I was never punished (even after wrecking <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re way ahead of where many of us started, then!<br/>
