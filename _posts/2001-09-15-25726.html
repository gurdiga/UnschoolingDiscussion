<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991402566"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Bridget, you are the only one on an unschooling list who has equated the<br/>
&gt;mother /child relationship with the master / slave relationship.   I<br/>
&gt;cannot begin to fathom this.  <br/>
&gt;And why did you add, in parenthesis,  &quot; in either direction&quot; ?  Girl, I<br/>
&gt;never liked psychology that much but this is RINGing some bells here.<br/>
&gt;Deb L<br/>
&gt;(help!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Only if your definition of equal includes the word NOT<br/>
<br/>
&quot; We address all of our problems as a family not as master and slave (in<br/>
either direction).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the parenthetical addition was to say that the control can go either<br/>
way.  Some mothers I know have put their children in control of the<br/>
mother&#39;s life and that is just as bad as an authoritarian parent, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
I said the parent-child relationship should not be a master/slave one and<br/>
you automatically turned it around to say something else.  <br/>
