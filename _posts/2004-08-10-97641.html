<br/>
It&#39;s much better to say: You were born to these parents. Now you have to choose how to <br/>
live with them given who they are.<br/>
<br/>
By making someone feel responsible over something she didn&#39;t experience, she feels <br/>
crazy.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see how telling me I chose the situation empowers me. In fact, for me, that <br/>
viewpoint served (at the time) to make me feel powerless - like I was bad at choosing <br/>
when I should have been more aware... Like I said, crazy.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Any other pointers to Karma and/or Reincarnation<br/>
theories and their origins? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking about karma.  That&#39;s established in Hinduism, a religion quite <br/>
older than Christianity.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking about reincarnation.  That belief is old and documented.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking about the more recent, seemingly American new-age idea that a soul <br/>
chooses its next life.    I don&#39;t think that idea could even exist without <br/>
the idea of catalogs or parts lists.  And why would a soul be able to see into <br/>
the future?  (not by any of the Hindu or Buddhist writings I&#39;ve ever read)<br/>
<br/>
I know that in the not-so-respected area of past-life regression and fortune <br/>
tellers who will speak to you of your past lives, they like to tell couples <br/>
that they knew each other in another life.  But that has no basis outside of a <br/>
slim faith in someone you just paid $20 to tell your fortune, or $60 to <br/>
hypnotize you and see if you remember being burned at the stake or being king of <br/>
England or anything else you might&#39;ve seen in a movie.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking whether there&#39;s any valid basis for a belief that a child has <br/>
chosen his own life, knowing what that life would be like.<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s really based on a Richard Bach book, I&#39;ll be surprised and <br/>
disappointed.  I really like Illusions.  Read it as a teen, and bought another copy a <br/>
few years back and read it a couple of times in succession.   But it&#39;s fiction.  <br/>
 If people are basing religious belief on that, I&#39;d put that in the same <br/>
category as those who make a religion out of Star Wars or other sci-fi worlds and <br/>
philosophies.   I don&#39;t mind when that affects their morality or behaviors, <br/>
but to pass it on to children as an objective truth doesn&#39;t seem right to me.   <br/>
<br/>
Then again, if a mom doesn&#39;t know where the idea came from and passes it on <br/>
as truth, that seems problematical to me too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was in est (Erhard Seminars Training) started by the notorious Werner Erhard. He <br/>
synthesized eastern mysticism with new age gobble-dy gook to create his own version of <br/>
what is real. I concur with your assessment that the view of &quot;choosing one&#39;s parents&quot; is an <br/>
outgrowth of the new age movement as over and against ancient eastern religion. <br/>
Scientology is another system that espouses this viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of &quot;hyper-responsiblity&quot; was taken further to say that we were each responsible <br/>
for &quot;creating&quot; WWII (even though not yet born)... [insert Twilight Zone music here]<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess it depends on what your definition of &quot;valid&quot; is. For me, any religious or spiritual ideas are just ideas of people. It&#39;s not like any of us here on earth has written proof or documentation of what happens after we die, or before we come into this world. Even the major religions are based on theory and philosophy and writings of people that lived very, very long ago. I don&#39;t consider this any more or less valid than people who write about these issues today.<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t you just read things/ideas sometimes and they just totally RESONATE with you? You just *know* that this idea feels right to you and you gravitate more and more to it? I guess this is how I came into my beliefs about spirituality. I keep reading more and more and it keeps feeling more and more *right* to me. Hard proof, scientific evidence....nah. But, I don&#39;t need it here. What is valid to me may or may not be valid to you. <br/>
 <br/>
Some authors that might give you more insight (only a couple I can think of off the top of my head):<br/>
 <br/>
*Neal Donald Walsch, his &quot;Conversation with God&quot; books (he has a great children&#39;s book called &quot;Little Soul and the Sun&quot; that is about exactly this idea of children choosing their life circumstances before they enter, good or bad. I&#39;m sure you can look at it at your local bookstore or Amazon)<br/>
*Dr Brenda Davies, &quot;Journey of the Soul&quot;<br/>
*Anything by Depak Chopra<br/>

Every read Jane Roberts?  I especially liked her<br/>
Oversoul Seven trilogy, which is fiction.  <br/>
<br/>
Her others could be seen as fiction too, tho, lol, as<br/>
she is channelling.  Even if you don&#39;t believe she is,<br/>
indeed, chanelling a spirit, she has some very<br/>
interesting theories, and it&#39;s couched in her search<br/>
to understand the info she is receiving, which is also<br/>
very thought provoking.  <br/>

Good point, I should not have used that term &quot;all&quot;. It isn&#39;t &quot;all&quot; about that, but to me it is about this in part. The Little Soul, in the book, chooses to learn the lesson of &quot;forgiveness&quot; in his next life, and arranges this with another soul before coming into this world. This, to me, is about people/children choosing life lessons to be learned before entering this realm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44471324">***This, to me, is about people/children choosing life lessons to be<br/>

<br/>
We already know what abused kids learn.  They learn to be abusers.    <br/>
<br/>
Abused kids grow up to hurt or kill their own partners and kids.   We<br/>
don&#39;t need spiritual theories to tell us that.  We can check the local<br/>
prisons. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more concerned with now.  I believe what a child can learn today from<br/>
someone who walks up to his mom and says &quot;stop hitting him&quot; is greater<br/>
and has much more potential to offer hope and positive change within that<br/>
child *in this lifetime* that I will not wait around and hope he&#39;s<br/>
learning how to do better in the next one.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an atheist.  All spiritual ideas sound silly to me.  If I lived<br/>
before and if I was mean to kids in another life I hope there was someone<br/>
there who told me to knock it off.  I can&#39;t guess what god or some other<br/>
higher being or power would do but if he/she/it didn&#39;t think telling some<br/>
asshole to quit hitting their kids was more valuable then thinking the<br/>
poor kid was getting what he wanted and needed, then I&#39;d think twice<br/>
about there being any goodness in that god/higher being/power.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we get one chance. I think it&#39;s worth a lot of self examination<br/>
and thinking and change and growth to get it right with the kids we have<br/>
right now, today.   If I&#39;m wrong I haven&#39;t lost anything by being good to<br/>
my kid in this lifetime, by standing up for the neighbor kid when his mom<br/>
is wailing on him in this lifetime, or by reminding people that if<br/>
*they&#39;re* wrong and if this lifetime is all there is, it would be better<br/>
to remember we don&#39;t have an infinite amount of time in which to get it<br/>
right. <br/>

I agree.  <br/>
If there&#39;s reincarnation, living a good life is plus points for that.<br/>
If there&#39;s only one life, living a good life is plus points for that.<br/>
If Christians are right and God has set up an obstacle course and a test to <br/>
see who fails and burns and who lives forever, and if living a good life is not <br/>
plus points for that, then God is a total sadistic doofus unworthy of any <br/>
worship whatsoever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037124024">***We already know what abused kids learn.  They learn to be abusers.***<br/>
<br/>
Not always.  I&#39;m not sure whether you meant to generalize, but my husband<br/>
and his brother are examples of abused children who are not abusers<br/>
themselves.  They both recall the frequent beatings and humiliation they<br/>
endured solidifying their resolve never to treat their own children that<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
***Abused kids grow up to hurt or kill their own partners and kids.***<br/>
<br/>
Some do.  In 17 years, my husband has never so much as raised his voice to<br/>
me, let alone considered hitting me or the children or harming us in any<br/>
manner.  He may be an exception to the rule, but I feel it&#39;s unfair to pin<br/>
the label of &#39;future abuser or murderer&#39; on a child who has no control over<br/>
what is happening to him.<br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m more concerned with now.  I believe what a child can learn today from<br/>

and has much more potential to offer hope and positive change within that<br/>
child *in this lifetime* that I will not wait around and hope he&#39;s<br/>
learning how to do better in the next one.***<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t agree more.  When my husband and I started dating, he went to<br/>
church with my family one Sunday.  He ended up running into his third grade<br/>
teacher and talking to her for quite a while.  She stood and cried with him<br/>
over the fact that she didn&#39;t do more to intervene in what she recognized as<br/>
abuse when he was her student.  She told him of going to the principal and<br/>
school counselors and being told to mind her own business.  Nearly fifteen<br/>
years later, she was still carrying the guilt of her inaction.  She asked<br/>
for his forgiveness.<br/>
<br/>
**If I&#39;m wrong I haven&#39;t lost anything by being good to<br/>

our children, we must do good in secret. To do good in secret means to <br/>
act without seeking attention and praise, to act without any hope of <br/>
reward. This is called Intoku.<br/>

&gt; ***This, to me, is about people/children choosing life lessons to be<br/>
&gt; learned before entering this realm.***<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We already know what abused kids learn.  They learn to be abusers.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Abused kids grow up to hurt or kill their own partners and kids.   We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need spiritual theories to tell us that.  We can check the local<br/>
&gt; prisons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m more concerned with now.  I believe what a child can learn today from<br/>
&gt; someone who walks up to his mom and says &quot;stop hitting him&quot; is greater<br/>
&gt; and has much more potential to offer hope and positive change within that<br/>
&gt; child *in this lifetime* that I will not wait around and hope he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; learning how to do better in the next one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m an atheist.  All spiritual ideas sound silly to me.  If I lived<br/>
&gt; before and if I was mean to kids in another life I hope there was someone<br/>
&gt; there who told me to knock it off.  I can&#39;t guess what god or some other<br/>
&gt; higher being or power would do but if he/she/it didn&#39;t think telling some<br/>
&gt; asshole to quit hitting their kids was more valuable then thinking the<br/>
&gt; poor kid was getting what he wanted and needed, then I&#39;d think twice<br/>
&gt; about there being any goodness in that god/higher being/power.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think we get one chance. I think it&#39;s worth a lot of self examination<br/>
&gt; and thinking and change and growth to get it right with the kids we have<br/>
&gt; right now, today.   If I&#39;m wrong I haven&#39;t lost anything by being good to<br/>
&gt; my kid in this lifetime, by standing up for the neighbor kid when his mom<br/>
&gt; is wailing on him in this lifetime, or by reminding people that if<br/>
&gt; *they&#39;re* wrong and if this lifetime is all there is, it would be better<br/>
&gt; to remember we don&#39;t have an infinite amount of time in which to get it<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>

<br/>
When my husband and I started dating, he went to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; church with my family one Sunday.  He ended up running into his third<br/>
 </span></blockquote>grade<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; teacher and talking to her for quite a while.  She stood and cried with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>him<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; over the fact that she didn&#39;t do more to intervene in what she recognized<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; abuse when he was her student.  She told him of going to the principal and<br/>
&gt; school counselors and being told to mind her own business.  Nearly fifteen<br/>
&gt; years later, she was still carrying the guilt of her inaction.  She asked<br/>
&gt; for his forgiveness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Twenty three years ago, while I was student-teaching for my special ed<br/>
credential in northern California, I stumbled across a tiny second grade<br/>
student who had giant welts across her back from being bull-whipped by her<br/>
father (she crawled up into my lap to be read to and I could feel them<br/>
through her shirt).  I still to this day am stunned by the school<br/>
administrators reacting like I was a big pain-in-the-a--  for reporting it,<br/>
which was required by the law.  They subtly implied that I shouldn&#39;t have<br/>
even been in that classroom even tho I had the teacher&#39;s permission and had<br/>
been checked thru the office!<br/>
