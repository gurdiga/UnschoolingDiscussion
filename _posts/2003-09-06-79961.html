<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313547001">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if there are any people on this list dealing with serious <br/>
mental illness in the family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to talk to folks with an Unschooling perspective, as I know the <br/>
responses I&#39;d get from mainstream about various issues and concerns.<br/>
<br/>
Please email me privately.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane</div>
