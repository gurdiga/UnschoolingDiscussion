<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131409652">O.K., I know I need 20 lashes with an old noodle but blame it on mommy brain<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  On one of these lists someone was just asking about hysterectomies.<br/>
%-{  Sorry, I don&#39;t remember which one.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I was sitting in the waiting room at the hospital the other day<br/>
and was reading the 6/26/01 issue of Woman&#39;s World.   The article was &quot;You<br/>
don&#39;t need a hysterectomy!  9 breakthrough alternatives.  Experts say 90% of<br/>
hysterectomies are unnecessary!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The article gives info on the alternatives and then goes on to tell about a<br/>
new method of doing them which is &quot;cervic-sparing&quot;  It is called the<br/>
&quot;laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy (LSH)&quot;  At any rate, it is suppose<br/>

incontinence, vaginal damage and sexual dysfunction.<br/>
