<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314289882">The terminology and distinctions about online resources come up  <br/>
occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
-=-does everyone on this board  understand unschooling 100%?? -=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-this is my 6th unschooling site-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And as a clarification, this is a list, not a site and not a board.   <br/>
Most people probably don&#39;t care, but I like language, and there is a  <br/>
difference in all those terms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These are sites:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.learninginfreedom.com/">http://www.learninginfreedom.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a board (short for &quot;message board,&quot; also known as a forum):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.info/forum">http://unschooling.info/forum</a><br/>
<br/>
Messages stay there indefinitely, and people come and post or not.   <br/>
It&#39;s a site, in that the messages stay in one place in that same  <br/>
arrangement, in folders and topics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then there are many blogs, some listed here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a>  (lower center column)<br/>
<br/>
and some linked on the left sidebar of<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a> (and each of those has links to eight  <br/>
or twenty others)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Information about unschooling as it unfolds in other families is  <br/>
available in more and more places every day.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are lists.  Lists are for discussing unschooling.   <br/>
Different lists have different slants, but I don&#39;t think any  <br/>
unschooling list would welcome advice being given without qualifying  <br/>
statements (like &quot;I&#39;m not unschooling yet&quot; or &quot;my children are very  <br/>
young and I&#39;m just thinking about unschooling but...&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Some other unschooling lists are here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people prefer one of those (lists, boards, sites, blog) over all  <br/>
others.  I use all four.<br/>
<br/>
I think those links above lead people to enough unschooling  <br/>
information to fulfill any  need they  might ever have.  It won&#39;t  <br/>
cost a cent.  To complain about something that vast and that free  <br/>
tells more about the individual complaining than about unschooling,  <br/>
or boards, or sites.<br/>
<br/>
