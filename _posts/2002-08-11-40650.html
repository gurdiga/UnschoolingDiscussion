&gt; We have it easy. Here in Kansas, when a child reaches the age of 7, you get<br/>
&gt; (online or directly from the Kansas Board of Education) a form of intent. You<br/>
&gt; fill out the name of your *home* school, your name, address, phone # (not<br/>
&gt; required) and the name of your *keeper of records* (usually you) address,<br/>
&gt; phone # (not required) That is it. You don&#39;t have to give your children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; ages or names.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The above sounds like &quot;enumeration&quot; (something like the census -- counting<br/>
heads) that states engage in. The schools gather the information for the<br/>
state. God only knows who else gets it, though. (&quot;when a child reaches the<br/>
age of 7,&quot;  they already know the age (7) because they contact you, and the<br/>
names probably, and your address and lots more. Social workers get lots of<br/>
information in hospital maternity wards every day) They are the gov&#39;t,<br/>
remember. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just heard a first rumor of a new national law that will allow the<br/>
schools to &quot;track&quot; and keep  much information on all children for the US<br/>
Dept of Labor. <br/>

Ned to Joyce: <br/>

It seems to come up often enough to warrant some facts instead of guessing.<br/>
It might help everyone to know how their state compares to the others in<br/>
their different regulations put on homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Sine this list has several hundred subscribers, could a simple way be<br/>
created that would show which state really are &quot;easy&quot; and which are<br/>
restrictive or highly regulated and demanding.<br/>
<br/>
Texas usually comes up as easy, now Kansas. PA claims it&#39;s the worst<br/>
(hardest) and NY also sounds bad.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think about having each of us who&#39;s willing, summarize the<br/>
requirements made in our various states. It would help with the guessing,<br/>
and might help people who want to work on those things and try to make life<br/>
easier for homeschooling -- with the ultimate goal of making homeschoolers<br/>
seem less like second class citizens.<br/>
