<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093134249">I am new to the list and new to unschooling. We have been deschooling <br/>
ourselves for about a month now. For the most part I feel it is going <br/>
well. We have good days and not so good days. The biggest struggle we <br/>
are having is with the eating habits of our two sons. They are young <br/>
just 7&5 and have always been rather picky eaters. I was hoping that <br/>
allowing them the freedom to make their own decisions over what they <br/>
eat, that they would decide to make some better food choices. Instead <br/>
they have become worse than ever wanting to eat candy,chips,cookies <br/>
and whatever other junk they can find. I know its only been a month <br/>
since they have been allowed this freedom but, after a trip to the <br/>
dentist with our first cavity I am a bit concerned. I would appreciate <br/>
any advise or encouragement anyone has to offer.<br/>
<br/>
I joined this list a little over a month ago and have been encouraged <br/>
through other posts. I would like to thank all of you for helping us <br/>
to make the decision to change from a burntout homeschooling family <br/>
into a loving unschooling family. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks you,<br/>

<br/>
#1, drop &quot;decide&quot; above.<br/>
People don&#39;t &quot;decide&quot; to make choices, they make choices.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re hoping they will make &quot;some better&quot; food choices.<br/>
<br/>
That means you&#39;re still judging foods better and worse, good and  <br/>
bad.  You&#39;ve done that for their whole lives, probably, and without  <br/>
intending to do so, you glorified some foods you would rather they  <br/>
consider mundane and no big deal now.  The spotlight was yours, and  <br/>
now you really have to turn that spotlight off.  Off.  Not down.  Not  <br/>
temporarily off.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Instead<br/>
they have become worse than ever wanting to eat candy,chips,cookies<br/>
and whatever other junk they can find. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Worse&quot; and &quot;junk&quot; will need to be weeded out of your thought  <br/>
processes on this, or it&#39;s really not going to work.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Worse than ever&quot; implies they&#39;ve always wanted to eat candy, chips  <br/>
and cookies.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re sure you know what foods are &quot;junk&quot; why don&#39;t you know what  <br/>
information is junk?  TV shows?  Video games?  If you know and you&#39;re  <br/>
SURE you know, then why not just control your children&#39;s access?   <br/>
Don&#39;t give them choices.<br/>
<br/>
If you doubt that you know,and if you believe (or are coming to  <br/>
believe) that they might still learn and be happy and healthy even  <br/>
though they  make different choices than yours, then unschooling  <br/>
might work.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only been a month.  It might take more than that for them to get  <br/>
as much candy as they feel they&#39;ve missed in five or seven years.   <br/>
You scarcified it and made it valuable.  Let them gorge.  They&#39;ll get  <br/>
over it.  If you don&#39;t let them have it now, they will continue to  <br/>
crave it, sneak it, and pack it in.  Make it plentiful, and that will  <br/>
make it less desireable.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know its only been a month<br/>

<br/>
Nobody got a cavity in one month.  I hope you haven&#39;t led them to  <br/>
believe that without the past month&#39;s freedoms there would&#39;ve been no  <br/>
cavity.<br/>

this year. One of the first things their daughter ever said to me was<br/>
that she didn&#39;t eat sweets &#39;cause they were bad for her.  I made some<br/>
noncommital noise.  Or maybe repeated what she said or something. <br/>
Anyhow, when she came to ours I found her in the kitchen on more than<br/>
one occasion very quietly putting her hand in our very public and full<br/>
candy bowl.  It&#39;s right next to the fruit.  It&#39;s often full of things<br/>
that I have to throw away because they&#39;ve melted as neither Simon nor<br/>
Linnaea want to eat them.  We had gum in the bowl.  Sugar-free gum<br/>
because the dentist suggested that Linnaea&#39;s weak teeth might do well<br/>
with frequent gum chewing and that her cavities had little to do with<br/>
what she ate.  This little girl had never had gum before and Linnaea<br/>
showed her how to chew it, but she kept eating it.  Slowly and with<br/>
careful little bites chewing it and swallowing it.  She made sure that<br/>
her mother and stepfather never saw.  Eventually she was found out. <br/>
The scene was so painful.  They leapt on her and screeched about how<br/>
gum is a petroleum product so she was swallowing a lump of petroleum.<br/>
 David and I intervened a little, but probably not enough.  I always<br/>
feel so awkward in those situations.  We tried to make light of the<br/>
situation and are now weighing whether we want to ever have them over<br/>
again.  <br/>
<br/>
The little girl was completely screwed from the beginning.  Because<br/>
she has limited access to sweets, pretty much completely, it is the<br/>
holy grail of foods.  Whenever she comes over she will gorge because<br/>
she will never not know scarcity.  She will never trust that the sweet<br/>
flavor will be something that she can experience with any kind of<br/>
regularity.  And her parents can point at that response and use it to<br/>
justify their reticence to let her have sweets.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627649461">I&#39;ve got a 7 1/2 yr old DS who has never been regulated in his <br/>
eating (that is, beyond the real world constraints of budget and <br/>
such). About a year or so ago, he &#39;discovered&#39; swiss cake rolls <br/>
(chocolate cake rolled up with cream and coated with chocolate <br/>
similar to a mini-jelly roll). Boy did he want them - first thing in <br/>
the morning, before bed, and in between. We&#39;d pick up a box at the <br/>
market each week and he kept eating them up and waiting until the <br/>
next box. One week, I noted they were on special 5 boxes for $5. So, <br/>
when we got to that spot in the market I told DS to get 5 boxes. <br/>
You&#39;d&#39;ve thought I handed him $1000! His eyes lit up, his face was <br/>
glowing, as he piled in the 5 boxes. When we got home, he ate some. <br/>
Next day he ate more. Third day not as many. By the time we got to <br/>
the 3rd box, they were mostly sitting there and I was taking one <br/>
packet (they are packaged in pairs within the larger box) to work <br/>
each day in my lunch and he hasn&#39;t looked at them since. He&#39;s done <br/>
the same with Jello puddings (the premade kind) and other things. <br/>
Through it all, we still have other foods available for him and he <br/>
eats them as well. And he is now developing his own sense of balance <br/>
about food - he&#39;ll -choose- to eat some cheese and crackers or <br/>
something in and around sweets at a party for instance. He knows he <br/>
just feels better that way and has more energy, less frustration. <br/>
We&#39;ve talked about the roles of protein, vitamins, carbs, sugary <br/>
foods, etc. Not in &#39;better or worse&#39; terms but just basic what they <br/>
do in your body stuff.<br/>
<br/>
One reason, aside from simply finally being free, that what is <br/>
generally classed as &#39;junk food&#39; might be a current target is that <br/>
it is easy access - single serving perhaps or already bite sized or <br/>
no cooking/prep needed, easy to eat while watching a movie or <br/>
playing a game. That&#39;s a big move toward independence plus it&#39;s <br/>
available immediately when they feel like eating. In amongst it all, <br/>
how about bringing them some cut up fruit and veggies (whatever they <br/>
usually like) with some fun dips - peanut butter, or yogurt dip, or <br/>
cream cheese and honey (this is nice with apple slices - add a <br/>
spritz of cinnamon), or ranch dip, or whatever; cubes of cheese or <br/>
strng cheese or cheese shapes (get slices of favorite cheese - <br/>
provolone, american, cheddar, etc and use mini-cookie cutters to <br/>
make shapes) with some crackers. Include chips or pretzels or <br/>
whatever alongside as well. Basically, make all things easy access. <br/>
Snacks about every 2 to 3 hrs are about what works with my DS - if <br/>
he goes too long, he heads for whatever he can grab quickly (which <br/>
may be an apple, may be a pudding cup). But then again I do the same <br/>
thing if I get really hungry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483228171">Thank you for your quick response. You are absolutely right! I wasn&#39;t even aware that I was still trying to control what choices my children make. All though I no longer make their decisions I am still judging the decisions they make. Thank you for opening my eyes.<br/>
 <br/>
As for the dentist, I would never let my child believe his sugar binges were the cause of his first cavity. He however told the dentist about how mommy has been letting him eat all the &quot;Junk food he wants&quot;. So he is aware of the harmful effects of  the sugar on his teeth.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-----------------<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean &quot;he is aware of...&quot;<br/>
It means he fears it or believes it.<br/>
<br/>
Much of what we &quot;know&quot; about dental carries is untrue and non- <br/>
scientific.<br/>
<br/>
Sugar by itself doesn&#39;t hurt teeth.  If one has the bacteria, which  <br/>
are passed as a contagion, they thrive better with sugar for THEM to  <br/>
eat, but there are ways to get sugar out of your mouth.  And candy is  <br/>
no more &quot;sugar&quot; from the point of view of a bacterium than bread or a  <br/>
cracker or a potato is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to pick on you, and I hope it doesn&#39;t seem so.   When  <br/>
we live in someone else&#39;s pre-designed chute it&#39;s easy to just keep  <br/>
moving forward and the walls keep you going the same direction as  <br/>
everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is going to involve being open to a changing world and  <br/>
not clinging inflexibly to any &quot;truths&quot; about times tables or age &  <br/>
reading level or &quot;education&quot; or schedules or... cavities.<br/>
<br/>
What people knew as truth a thousand years ago evolved and changed as  <br/>
they learned more.  Five hundred years ago... things changed.  Things  <br/>
are still changing.  It doesn&#39;t matter that I got straight A&#39;s in  <br/>
health and had a first-aid certificate in the 1960&#39;s.  Almost every  <br/>
bit of that has changed.  Current recommendations are almost entirely  <br/>
different now.<br/>
<br/>
What might help is to qualify your statements as often as you can  <br/>
with things like &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;as far as I know&quot; or &quot;some experts  <br/>
think...&quot; and that will make it easier to change directions if you  <br/>
find a need to.  It will help your child learn to do the same too.   <br/>
If a mom says &quot;This *IS* that&quot; how does the child learn what &quot;is&quot;  <br/>
means and what the relationship between the this and the that are?   <br/>
Help him learn to think clearly by modeling clarity and showing him  <br/>
your thought processes.<br/>

&gt; ourselves for about a month now. For the most part I<br/>
&gt; feel it is going <br/>
&gt; well. We have good days and not so good days. The<br/>
&gt; biggest struggle we <br/>
&gt; are having is with the eating habits of our two<br/>
&gt; sons. They are young <br/>
&gt; just 7&5 and have always been rather picky eaters. I<br/>
&gt; was hoping that <br/>
&gt; allowing them the freedom to make their own<br/>
&gt; decisions over what they <br/>
&gt; eat, that they would decide to make some better food<br/>
&gt; choices. Instead <br/>
&gt; they have become worse than ever wanting to eat<br/>
&gt; candy,chips,cookies <br/>
&gt; and whatever other junk they can find. I know its<br/>
&gt; only been a month <br/>
&gt; since they have been allowed this freedom but, after<br/>
&gt; a trip to the <br/>
&gt; dentist with our first cavity I am a bit concerned.<br/>
&gt; I would appreciate <br/>
&gt; any advise or encouragement anyone has to offer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I joined this list a little over a month ago and<br/>
&gt; have been encouraged <br/>
&gt; through other posts. I would like to thank all of<br/>
&gt; you for helping us <br/>
&gt; to make the decision to change from a burntout<br/>

&gt; into a loving unschooling family. <br/>

<br/>
You didn&#39;t mention  his age.<br/>
<br/>
Having to reject something isn&#39;t as pleasant a feeling as requesting  <br/>
and receiving.  Maybe he should only have on his plate things he  <br/>
wants there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-At<br/>
breakfast he gets two choices toast or cereal. I have<br/>
low blood sugar and so he doe too-=-<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t necessarily follow, that you have it and so he does too,  <br/>
does it?<br/>
<br/>
And both toast and cereal are carbohydrate, and therefor sugar.<br/>
<br/>
-=-...so he is at a point<br/>
where he will tell another adult offering sugar to him<br/>
that it is not a good idea.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So&quot; was used twice in a sentence.  It&#39;s not a &quot;therefor&quot; situation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Toast with peanut butter? Cereal with soy milk perhaps? As was <br/>
mentioned, bread and cereal are carbs which, by themselves, react as <br/>
sugars glycemically. You might have simply been shorthanding things <br/>
and presuming that us readers would &#39;know&#39; that you included protein <br/>
with the carbs to slow the absorbtion of the sugars and keep the <br/>
blood sugar more stable over time. I too tend toward low blood sugar <br/>
but neither DH nor DS exhibit the same situation. I can only surmise <br/>
that you&#39;ve already noted the same tendencies in your DS so you act <br/>
on that, rather than simply presuming that since you have low blood <br/>
sugar, so does he.<br/>
<br/>
As far as dinner plates, we do it opposite of what you note - we <br/>
don&#39;t fill DS&#39; plate and then have him remove items. We ask if he <br/>
wants A, if he wants B, and so on - he chooses what goes on his <br/>
plate in the first place of what is on the table. Or he can choose <br/>
something else (he&#39;s been known to choose oatmeal over hot dogs).<br/>

This sounds like Jared. He lived on almost nothing but oatmeal for a <br/>
period in his life...still loves the stuff.  I just kept chanting &quot;it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388786025">One of Karl&#39;s favorite breakfast items is a bologna and cheese sandwich.<br/>
And Ben&#39;s favorite lunch is a bowl of cereal (and he&#39;s not one for protein,<br/>
so I have the same self-talk!) and one of my favorite dinners is pancakes<br/>
with sausage.  Food is food, it doesn&#39;t really matter when it&#39;s eaten.<br/>
There are lots of easy breakfast combinations that aren&#39;t really any more<br/>

&gt;protein,<br/>
&gt; so I have the same self-talk!) and one of my favorite dinners is <br/>
&gt;pancakes<br/>
&gt; with sausage.  Food is food, it doesn&#39;t really matter when it&#39;s <br/>
&gt;eaten.<br/>
&gt; There are lots of easy breakfast combinations that aren&#39;t really <br/>
&gt;any &gt;more<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There have been times when DS ate cold leftover pasta for breakfast -<br/>
 even knowing he could nuke it quickly to have it warm, he chose <br/>
cold. We -always- stir in a bit of olive oil as soon as the pasta is <br/>
drained so it doesn&#39;t get clumpy when cooled but *never* add the <br/>
tomato sauce (DS prefers without sauce so that stays separate) so he <br/>
just munched away.<br/>
<br/>
Currently a favorite oatmeal topping is chips - not potato lol - DH <br/>
uses cinnamon chips, DS likes white chocolate swirl chips (both <br/>
found in the baking aisle next to the plain chocolate chips). And <br/>
both like a sprinkle of raisins as well. Much as I love chocolate <br/>
chips (I put them on my Cheerios), I don&#39;t like them on oatmeal. Go <br/>
figure. lol<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I *love* about our microwave is that it has an <br/>
oatmeal pre-set and an omelette pre-set so DS can make those things <br/>
all on his own (makes him happy too) without having to figure times <br/>
and power settings and all.<br/>

put a bit of butter and milk on my oatmeal (plus some sweetness - <br/>
honey, or sugar, or maple syrup, or brown sugar). I don&#39;t know, <br/>
though, if I&#39;d want something frozen cold blopped on top. I want my <br/>
oatmeal nice and hot mostly. DH likes to put a blob of peanut butter <br/>
on his ice cream though - he&#39;s a kid in the guise of a big bearded <br/>
bear :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637840376">Actually, that&#39;s a great idea!  My kids don&#39;t like anything really hot and<br/>
they don&#39;t want to wait for it to cool, so they usually add a bit of milk<br/>

didn&#39;t come out quite as creamy as I like (I like to cook my oatmeal <br/>
thick then thin it with milk but the heavy cream just kind of soaked <br/>
in). I might try it with a bit of cinnamon and vanilla ice cream - <br/>
oh and maybe some diced apple - it&#39;d be like pie a la mode!!!!mmmm<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614915167">One of the things that helped us was to take it slow, one step at a <br/>
time. My three were in foster care when we adopted them and food was <br/>
a big issue with them. Some of the things we did was:<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I did: *I posted this on unschoolinginfo and copied it <br/>
here*<br/>
<br/>
**I started by asking if they were ready for breakfast, lunch or <br/>
snack instead of just making it and giving it to them. To my <br/>
surprise, my daughters are having breakfast about an hour later than <br/>
I would have been giving it to them. <br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;ve also started asking them what they want for breakfast, lunch <br/>
or snack instead of just making one of the things I know they like <br/>
and just giving it to them.<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;ve also stopped limited cookies and cakes. When they want <br/>
cookies for a snack, I very casually hand them the bag and ask them <br/>
to put it away when they&#39;re finished....intead of taking out 3-4 <br/>
cookies and telling them that&#39;s all they can have if they ask for <br/>
more. I&#39;ve found that they eat less cookies now. <br/>
<br/>
I hope some of this helps and maybe gives you some ideas. <br/>
