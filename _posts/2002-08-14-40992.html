&gt;&gt; Does anyone here blame HSLDA with all their unecessary stridency and<br/>
&gt;&gt; willingness to divide homeschoolers for the loss of freedom we are<br/>
&gt;&gt; experiencing?  I wonder if all their activism is doing enough damage<br/>
&gt;&gt; that it&#39;s really beginning to affect more people now....???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do, in part.<br/>
&gt; Tia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tia, <br/>
 Let&#39;s see, do I blame HSLDA for the loss of freedom we are experiencing?<br/>
It&#39;s hard to say who or what is ultimately responsible, but there have been<br/>
advances in freedoms too, over the years, and I believe they outweigh the<br/>
losses.  Twenty-five years ago, the picture was grim compared to today, even<br/>
though it&#39;s still bad.<br/>
<br/>
Who doesn&#39;t have something against lawyers? HSLDA is run by lawyers as a<br/>
business. That&#39;s strike one and two. They have a conflict of interest.<br/>
<br/>
In CT, fifteen years ago, school boards had the say in whether a family<br/>
could homeschool or not. I was not involved then, but when our Hsing org<br/>
wanted to change that, the head of HSLDA came and made a case to the State<br/>
School Board in an effort that he claimed would help. His presentation was<br/>
not accepted even by CT homeschoolers, so it created much confusion at the<br/>
time. Ultimately, the parents themselves took charge of the negotiations and<br/>
were able to make the state eliminate its regulations, so that now, there is<br/>
really no regulation at all for homeschoolers here, and no law that uses the<br/>
word homeschooling.  That might be up for a redux next year again, since we<br/>
were attacked this year by superintendents trying to create restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
From where I sit, the HSLDA is helping by being a visible advocate and<br/>
lobbyist, but along the way, they can&#39;t help but antagonize plenty of folks<br/>
because ot their religious slant and political/legal tactics that seem to<br/>
favor them instead of parents, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
What seems to happen is that the HSLDA divides groups of parents from each<br/>
other on issues -- christians versus all the rest. I don&#39;t know if it can be<br/>
really blamed on the org or not. Christians for one reason or another, seem<br/>
to like state regulations. I can&#39;t figure that out. The HSLDA seems to be<br/>
behind that. (if there were none, then what would all those lawyers fight<br/>
against? <br/>
<br/>
On balance, I&#39;d say HSLDA is doing more good than harm, but in states where<br/>
the climate is favorable for homeschooling, I see no need to join, and that<br/>
means many states. Homeschooling is getting large enough to have lots of<br/>
lawyers among its practitioners. Who needs outsiders?<br/>

I know what you are saying in regard to the HSLDA environment and that whole group of homeschoolers that tend to be &quot;Christian&quot; and rigid.  Like the  Teaching Home family on the front cover of their magazine.<br/>
<br/>
BUT...  it is sad that the majority of Christians follow a minister, pastor, husband etc. and have perpetuated this idea that  creativity and winging it can&#39;t be right.... etc.  There are those of us - that don&#39;t see it that way - as well as some authors that stand on the fence - I am thinking of Charlotte Mason... I understand where the fundamentalists get their line of logic from &quot;train up a child...etc&quot; and their style my work for them....but God didn&#39;t use a cookie cutter - and we are all different.  I think it&#39;s more of a sin to be a follower...(following pastor..or whatever) without doing your own studying, thinking, working it out - on issues of  utmost importance - such as how to raise your child...<br/>
<br/>
Although generally unschooling is not looked upon favorably in Christian circles - because it does seem messy .... unstructured etc.  - it is often misunderstood that our kids are doing  &quot;nothing all day&quot; - someone suggested to me to keep a journal awhile back - and I am amazed at how much we are doing... I also have watched Christian friends who give their child an ultimatum like - you can&#39;t go out to the beach - if you don&#39;t finish that math page...and inevitablnly I am thinking as we are on the beach without her - that my kids are learning so much more by experiencing the joys of life - than hers sitting there, crying and fighting about the math page. Although I have my moments where I am nervous about letting go ... It is more of getting used to the idea that if it is mainstream - and widely accepted it usually isn&#39;t always right... the harder path tends to be the right one - all the way... think of the parable - the broad and easy way  - vs. the narrow and bumpy way... ;-) <br/>

<br/>
Those are some serious religious and political generalizations and opinions <br/>
about &quot;them,&quot; especially coming from one who recently spent a week trying to <br/>
silence someone who was giving, ah, er, serious political generalizations and <br/>
opinions about &quot;them.&quot; I don&#39;t doubt you&#39;ve met your share of shallow people, <br/>
who hasn&#39;t? But &quot;shallow&quot; is just it, for what you are addressing really <br/>
isn&#39;t the Christian fundamentalist thing, as much as it is the herd mentality <br/>
-- something that&#39;s found everywhere. Alas, even at this list!<br/>
<br/>
But you made the accusation toward fundy Christians, and it&#39;s clear you &quot;have <br/>
issues&quot; with them. So I&#39;ll go with that, because I think you are wrong. The <br/>
bottom line, from your perspective, is that the fear of hell is what <br/>
motivates them. Fear is indeed a dangerous and harmful motivator. But there <br/>
are fears other than hell that motivate all of us, not just the Christians. <br/>
What about the fear of being unhip; poor; without answers; forsaken; sick; <br/>
rejected; alone; losing your children; not being able to unschool; etc? Hell <br/>
is only one of a million fears. <br/>
<br/>
But you think that fear of hell, and slavish devotion to others is what <br/>
motivates fundamentalist C&#39;s: Consider this: The opposite of fear is love. <br/>
Maybe it&#39;s love that motivates them. And that what appears as fear, may in <br/>
fact be a love of things like devotion, order, absolute truth, hierarchies of <br/>
value in art, method, life, eternal justice, God. Moreover, what appears to <br/>
be slavish succumbing, may in fact be devotion. You may despise the object of <br/>
their devotion, but are you not devoted to someone, something? <br/>
<br/>
Also consider that the belief that there is order in the universe, and order <br/>
in our souls, and that this order is manifested everywhere, is as old as the <br/>
hills -- even older! (The great Eric Voegelin made it his life&#39;s work to <br/>
study this revelation of order. What he found regarding ancient Israel is <br/>
staggering -- a truly blessed people. I digress.) Christians assume this <br/>
order, and look to see that some of it gets manifest in the political realm. <br/>
That&#39;s not unusual, Sandra, it&#39;s the story of humans.<br/>
<br/>
The fear of hell is not peculiar to fundamentalist Christians, and I doubt it <br/>
is what motivates them to belong to HSLDA, or Promise Keepers, or any other <br/>
organization. <br/>
<br/>
Your remarks above betray that you fancy yourself a freethinker. Yet those <br/>
statements are textbook generalizations -- everyone makes them. What more can <br/>
you tell us that we haven&#39;t already thought ourselves?<br/>

<br/>
This is very astute. I want to add another thing. To many Christian <br/>
homeschoolers there is an apparent (not necessarily real) disorder in <br/>
unschooling, and as I said in my last post, many Christians believe in an <br/>
inherent order. And they believe that one crucial way this order is <br/>
manifested is in familial pedagogy: mothers and fathers, love your children <br/>
and teach them well. The Judaic wisdom books play a great part in this as do <br/>
the writings of, say, Augustine. Indeed, here is Augustine: &quot;The family is a <br/>
school of virtue in which God sets before us, day after day, a few people <br/>
whom we are to learn to love. This is the paideia of the heavenly Father, at <br/>
work upon both children and parents, building upon the love that comes <br/>
naturally to us in our families, but transforming it also into the image of <br/>
divine love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds good to me!<br/>

How do you reconcile this with Jesus&#39; commandment to &quot;Follow Me&quot;? He doesn&#39;t <br/>
say, &quot;Go study, work it out, see if I&#39;m the real deal, and then follow me if <br/>
I line up with your perspective.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
This is what bothers most people about Christianity, and they use the <br/>
fundamentalists as whipping boys. Jesus, unlike most other religious <br/>
teachers, never said for people to follow their bliss, find what works for <br/>
them, take from him what works and leave the rest. He flat out called Himself <br/>
God, and the only God at that, and said that &quot;if you&#39;re mine, you&#39;ll hear my <br/>
voice and follow me.&quot; That&#39;s a big deal, compared with other religions, even <br/>
if you don&#39;t believe it. Jesus is one tough character to have to confront, if <br/>
you&#39;re into confrontation!<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re right, Christians tend to be followers. Who doesn&#39;t?<br/>

anyone is interested in the topic, there are two books that talk <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837423057">I&#39;ll take a stab at that.  Christians are supposed to follow Jesus.  <br/>
But Jesus offers freedom to those who accept him as Lord and Savior.  <br/>
We don&#39;t have to follow all kinds of laws.  All that we are supposed <br/>
to do is summed up by loving the Lord with all our hearts soul mind <br/>
and strength and loving our neighbor as ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in the old testament, people needed to follow a sabath.  <br/>
There were all kinds of rules about the sabbath.  How far you could <br/>
walk, you couldn&#39;t work, even to light a fire, etc.  Now for some <br/>
weird reason, many Christians don&#39;t get it when Jesus says that He is <br/>
now our Sabbath rest.  We are to rest from our attempts at good works <br/>
in Him.  Instead, many Christians teach their kids that they need to <br/>
follow the 10 commandments (even though we&#39;re not under the law <br/>
anymore) and that one of those commandments means to remember the <br/>
Sabbath and keep it Holy by going to Sunday School and Church on <br/>
Sundays!!!???!!!  The church they go to has its origins in paganism, <br/>
right down to the three point sermon, building with the steeple on <br/>
top, and choir.  <br/>
<br/>
But we are to follow Him, by loving.  We show our love to Him by <br/>
meeting with others to praise Him.  We don&#39;t pray and sing praises <br/>
because we have to, but because we love Him and we want to.  We love <br/>
others by being a friend to them and helping those in need.  Again, <br/>
not out of a sense of obligation  but because God has shown us how <br/>
good love is.  <br/>
<br/>
And Jesus created us as individuals, with individual likes and <br/>
dislikes, different talents, and different plans for our lives.  I do <br/>
believe that God has a definite plan for our lives.  That&#39;s part of <br/>
what unschooling is for me--getting out of the way so that the Holy <br/>
Spirit can guide the child&#39;s life.  Each person was made to do <br/>
something special in the universe and only God knows which puzzle <br/>
pieces he needs to put his part of the puzzle together completely. <br/>
The Bible says to train up a child in the way HE should go, and the <br/>
way HE should go is probably going to be different than the way <br/>
someone else&#39;s child should go.  God could have made us clones, but <br/>
He didn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Yes, Jesus did say that He was THE way, THE truth, and THE life, and <br/>
that no one comes to the Father except through Him.  I do believe <br/>
that to be true.  Just like I believe that unschooling is THE way to <br/>
educate a child.  I do believe in absolute rights and wrongs.  But <br/>
it&#39;s also true that in Christ, there is so much more freedom, so much <br/>
more individuality, so much more love.  It&#39;s so hard to see the true <br/>
picture of Christianity, as Christ intended, without seeing the stuff <br/>
that the institutional church has added to the picture.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601121070"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In CT, fifteen years ago, school boards had the say in whether a family<br/>
&gt;could homeschool or not. I was not involved then, but when our Hsing org<br/>
&gt;wanted to change that, the head of HSLDA came and made a case to the State<br/>
&gt;School Board in an effort that he claimed would help. His presentation was<br/>
&gt;not accepted even by CT homeschoolers, so it created much confusion at the<br/>
&gt;time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the kind of thing I was talking about.  According to the head of <br/>
the Canadian HSLDA, if they have even *one* member in a particular <br/>
province, they feel obligated to get involved in any discussions about <br/>
changing the hs law.  They don&#39;t bother to try to get any sort of consensus <br/>
on what the local hs want.  They just go ahead and push for the kind of law <br/>
they want.  And they represent themselves as representing all or most hs, <br/>
which is certainly not true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;From where I sit, the HSLDA is helping by being a visible advocate and<br/>
&gt;lobbyist, but along the way, they can&#39;t help but antagonize plenty of folks<br/>
&gt;because ot their religious slant and political/legal tactics that seem to<br/>
&gt;favor them instead of parents, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sentence seems pretty contradictory to me.  They&#39;re helping by <br/>
lobbying but antagonizing many of the people they&#39;re supposed to be <br/>
lobbying for?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What seems to happen is that the HSLDA divides groups of parents from each<br/>
&gt;other on issues -- christians versus all the rest. I don&#39;t know if it can be<br/>
&gt;really blamed on the org or not. Christians for one reason or another, seem<br/>
&gt;to like state regulations. I can&#39;t figure that out. The HSLDA seems to be<br/>
&gt;behind that. (if there were none, then what would all those lawyers fight<br/>
&gt;against?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly!  The harder it seems to legally homeschool, the more members <br/>
they&#39;ll get, and the more money they can channel into their political cause.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;On balance, I&#39;d say HSLDA is doing more good than harm, but in states where<br/>
&gt;the climate is favorable for homeschooling, I see no need to join, and that<br/>
&gt;means many states. Homeschooling is getting large enough to have lots of<br/>
&gt;lawyers among its practitioners. Who needs outsiders?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  I think they might be doing some good for people just like them <br/>
and only in the unfavourable states.  The rest is harm.  I just hope they <br/>
stay the h*ll out of BC.<br/>

&lt;&lt; But you think that fear of hell, and slavish devotion to others is what <br/>
motivates fundamentalist C&#39;s: &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read many of the websites?<br/>
Have you heard their homeschooling reasons and seen their &quot;admonishments&quot; to <br/>
one another?<br/>
<br/>
I can give websites if you can&#39;t find them yourself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Moreover, what appears to <br/>
be slavish succumbing, may in fact be devotion. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many are devoted to a vengeful God who&#39;s stoking up hell.<br/>
<br/>
I was raised Southern Baptist.  All the violin music behind all the &quot;Jesus is <br/>
Peace&quot; messages you could muster wouldn&#39;t change one hair on the head of one <br/>
Southern Baptist homeschooler, nor would it undo what HSLDA plans.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You may despise the object of their devotion, but are you not devoted to <br/>
someone, something? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t despise the object of their devotion.  I point at the sky and say <br/>
blue and I point at their homeschooling reasons and say &quot;fear&quot; and I point at <br/>
their &quot;spoil the rod&quot; justifications and say &quot;sick.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m devoted to truth and reason, maybe.  Things I wasn&#39;t allowed to think <br/>
much about as a Baptist kid.  The people at my church were sure I would go to <br/>
hell (in their terms &quot;lose your faith&quot;) for going to the state university <br/>
instead of a Baptist college.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The fear of hell is not peculiar to fundamentalist Christians, and I doubt <br/>
it <br/>
is what motivates them to belong to HSLDA, or Promise Keepers, or any other <br/>
organization. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known too many people who couldn&#39;t tell the difference between being a <br/>
good person, pleasing God and avoiding hell.  They were all one and the same <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Your remarks above betray that you fancy yourself a freethinker. Yet those <br/>
statements are textbook generalizations -- everyone makes them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What textbook would those statements be in?<br/>
I think there are more people who see Christianity from the outside and think <br/>
it IS all sweetness and light than there are those who have seen the mean and <br/>
fearful inside and will state what they know.<br/>
<br/>
So belittling my knowledge (not idea, not parroting) does for a moment make <br/>
you look peacemaking and me small, but if you haven&#39;t read some of the <br/>
pervasive and dark conservative Christian exhortations, you might want to do <br/>
that before you co-sign for them as a movement or as a group.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was defending a occasional acquaintance the other day as being a good <br/>
guy.  When he heard some of the things the boy had recently done, he said, <br/>
&quot;Oh.  Okay.  I didn&#39;t know that.&quot;  I told him it costs him reputation points <br/>
to defend someone else and he might want to be more careful before he vouches <br/>
for someone.<br/>

<br/>
There are *many* views of Christianity and many of them conflict with each<br/>
other. Whatever Christians believe, the one thing they have in common is<br/>
that they believe they are right. Not necessarily right as in Ultimate Truth<br/>
right, but on the path that feels right to them.<br/>
<br/>
Our own ways of thinking seem so totally obvious that it can be baffling how<br/>
someone can believe something totally different so it seems they must be<br/>
less well informed or less intelligent. But that&#39;s probably not the best<br/>
assumption to make. In fact it&#39;s fascinating learning how people can view<br/>
the same information and come to vastly different conclusions about it.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone thinks Christianity encompasses a vast array of beliefs, it holds<br/>
nothing to Hinduism ;-) Hinduism embraces beliefs from the primitive to the<br/>
mind bogglingly complex.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps internally they&#39;re accusing each other of not getting it and not<br/>
being real Hindus. But at least from the outside it looks peacefully<br/>
accepting!<br/>

I am speaking of following people - many Christians I know, will run to their pastor, minister, priest when they have a question. They will not jump into their Bible - and try and figure it out.  - I don&#39;t mean to insult anyone who does this - as I know many feel these people are more knowledgeable in these areas etc. -  The Bible says &quot;It the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the honor of kings to search it out&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Jesus, unlike most other religious <br/>
teachers, never said for people to follow their bliss, find what works for <br/>
them, take from him what works and leave the rest<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this - I guess I didn&#39;t make myself clear - I don&#39;t mean to say I go for the &quot;whatever pleases me&quot; mentality. But I do find there to be alot of extracurricular human tradition - along with ideas of things like heaven and hell that stem from Greek Mythology, Philosophy and the blending of beliefs to create a &quot;religion&quot; - which on the face is based on the Bible - but the preconceived notions are so strong that one cannot get by them. An example is the Pope. - I apologize if I offend anyone here - but he is supposed to be God&#39;s repetitive on Earth - the Holy Father...and yet the Bible says &quot;Call no man thy Father, save the Father which is in Heaven&quot;. So masses follow him - take what he says as infallible - and are deeply rooted in tradition - <br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about Jesus was that he really knew what motivated people. How else could he excuse those who under the Jewish Law should have been stoned - and yet come down hard on the scribes and Pharisees? We are to model our character after Him, and it takes working it out. Thinking about what he says, and applying it. - Not just listening to the Sunday morning sermon and going about our routine. It is a personal endeavor. I agree wholeheartedly we should be following Jesus - but he never said - go to your pastor for all the answers.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for getting at the issue head on. I know exactly what you are <br/>
saying about the extracurricular, the blind leading the blind, and I agree <br/>
with you. Though I make no claim to not be myopic. <br/>
<br/>
The problem remains, however, that any follower of Christ is by default a <br/>
follower of someone else. All we have of the record of Christ is the result <br/>
of tradition -- the writings and revelations and opinions of others. To claim <br/>
to love Jesus but hate the established religion is OK, except for the fact <br/>
that the established religion became just that the moment the record got <br/>
written and began circulating as the Word of God in the 1st Century. <br/>
<br/>
So though you might put off going to your pastor, or any other Bible scholar, <br/>
for advice, the very Bible you personally search to find answers is the <br/>
result of tradition.  Does that mean it is any less true? Not at all. Martin <br/>
Luther relied upon his sole private reading and understanding of the <br/>
Scriptures -- sola scriptura, after all. But even he knew he must at least <br/>
pick and choose his tradition.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, unless you&#39;re some sort of Gnostic, the record of the Jesus <br/>
you love is the result of a tradition which is the result of people following <br/>
people. I don&#39;t doubt that you can privately identify Christ in those <br/>
writings, but it is the established Church that some seem to claim to be <br/>
above, which gave us those writings. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, as I&#39;m sure you agree, it is the sick (mentally, spiritually, and <br/>
physically) whom Jesus came for. I am not excusing freaky Southern Baptists, <br/>
or the equally freaky Evangelical Lutheran Church in the US, for the lives <br/>
they destroy, but the bottom line is that the Gospel is based upon Christ&#39;s <br/>
righteousness, not ours, not the Pope&#39;s, not the SB&#39;s, and not Bill <br/>
Gothard&#39;s, and thank God for that.<br/>

    At any rate,  I am far from fundamentalist, {side note:  I guess one<br/>
reason I&#39;m not fundamentalist is that would be too contradictory......how<br/>
would a fundamentalist reconcile the Genisis creation story with John&#39;s<br/>

alive if one is fundamentalist? --I guess that&#39;s 2 reasons.}  but have faith<br/>

I didn&#39;t belittle you. You threw out a blanket accusation, and one that is <br/>

you on it. <br/>
<br/>
Please send me the web links if you think I&#39;m mistaken. <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, that you&#39;re carrying a lot of baggage laid on you by screwed <br/>
up Southern Baptists is to be regretted. But the bottom line is that you let <br/>
it get the best of you when you said that the desire that fundamentalist <br/>
Christians have for state homeschooling regulations is based upon a fear of <br/>
hell. This is not true, and a slur of fundamentalist Christians who love God, <br/>
love their neighbors, and who only seek to see some order in the political <br/>
realm -- something that is their birthright not only as Americans, but as <br/>
human beings. It has nothing to do with needing some minimal rules set before <br/>
them so that they might avoid the wrath of God.<br/>

&lt;&lt; You threw out a blanket accusation, and one that is <br/>
all too common, and more importantly, one that is not true, and I&#39;ve called <br/>
you on it. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Please send me the web links if you think I&#39;m mistaken.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a tiny sample of what&#39;s easily found.   I did a search on hell and <br/>
homeschooling, but my computer froze up.  Some of these sites I knew about <br/>
already.  Some I&#39;ve found otherwise.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a quote.  It doesn&#39;t say hell, but the implication about eternity is <br/>
pretty clear.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;None of these &quot;essentials&quot; for this school year can be found apart from <br/>
Jesus Christ. He has already purchased all of this for you through His shed <br/>
blood on the cross. If you have been taking Him for granted or leaving Him <br/>
out of your &quot;back to school&quot; plans, won&#39;t you take time to seek His face <br/>
today? He promises to meet with you, if you will but seek Him with your whole <br/>
heart. Take time to discover His plans for your family and put them into <br/>
practice this year --the benefits reaped will be of eternal value!&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt;You learn that children are utterly incompetent, incapable of even the <br/>
slightest good thing, always, always doing the wrong thing and without hope <br/>
of ever doing or changing anything of themselves.&gt;&gt;    <br/>

The article that one&#39;s from asks how many times you must spank, and the <br/>
answer is 70 times 7.  Patiently, continuously, in obedience to God.  Spank.  <br/>
Or what??  They don&#39;t say, but we all know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  The paragraphs right after the one above are:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You learn to say:  I am really a forgetful sinner just like my son. God has <br/>
been so patient, tenderhearted and merciful to me and in thankfulness I can <br/>
be patient and tenderhearted too.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You learn to cling desperately to God on your knees in prayer and beseech <br/>
him to change your child.  You won&#39;t rely on your activities of spanking and <br/>
reproof to do the work but hope in His promises to reward your good efforts <br/>
of obedience to Him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The constant spankings are likened to being tenderhearted and merciful.<br/>
The important thing is your child is changed.<br/>
Because if he is NOT changed, he will not be rewarded for obedience to God.<br/>

<br/>
That rhetorical &quot;musing&quot; (I love that word) begs a scientific equivalent: Is <br/>
2+2 equal to 4, if the consequences of 2+3 are eternally NOT eternally 4? I <br/>
would say yes. <br/>
<br/>
Theologically and philosophically you could say that if God is true love, <br/>
than anything other than true love is not God. Taken a step further, if <br/>
Heaven is the residence of eternal love/God, and eternal blessing, then hell <br/>
(or call it what you will) must be its opposite.<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those answers takes into consideration the idea of justice, or the <br/>
Gospel.<br/>

gave us the Bible.  It was individuals who were inspired by the Holy <br/>
Spirit to write so that we could understand more about God.  The <br/>
institutional church simply compiled them together into one book.  <br/>
And of course other people weren&#39;t inspired to write other things too-<br/>
-inspirational books, poems, songs, etc. <br/>
<br/>
So when I follow the Scriptures, I am following God&#39;s Words alone.  I <br/>
recognize that God chose to use certain people to write His words in <br/>
order to reveal more about Himself to the human race, but if those <br/>
people hadn&#39;t willingly surrendered to His calling for their life, He <br/>
would have used someone else who was willing.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336931592">John 1 -- In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God <br/>
and the Word was God.  He was with God in the beginning.  Through Him <br/>
all things were made;  without him nothing was made that has been <br/>
made.  In Him was life and that life was the light of men.  And later <br/>
on in verse 14, it tells us who &quot;the Word&quot; is...The Word became flesh <br/>
and made His dwelling among us.  We have seen His glory, the glory of <br/>
the One and Only, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.  <br/>
And then John goes on to say that He was the one that he preached <br/>
about in the wilderness.  <br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s not contradictory.  It&#39;s not saying that the Word was the <br/>
beginning.  It&#39;s saying that the Word was there in the beginning.  <br/>
That Word (Jesus) was God and participated with the other parts of <br/>
the Trinity in the creation of the world.  The very Jesus who came to <br/>
earth and became flesh was the same God who created us.  The Creator <br/>
was crucified by His creation.  <br/>
