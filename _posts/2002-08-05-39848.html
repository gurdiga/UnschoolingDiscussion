<div id="ygrps-yiv-506706315">At the risk of being called Anti-unschool, as has sprung up lately.....<br/>
<br/>
The law covering education in Connecticut (where Luz and I have lived for<br/>
several years) says that parents (and/or guardians) are responsible for<br/>
their children&#39;s education. That law was written in 1650 and is still in<br/>
effect. The law acknowledges the natural, sacred, unalienable RIGHT and duty<br/>
that parents have in the raising of their children -- education being part<br/>
of that upbringing. As this group and others remind us, homeschooling (at<br/>
least learning) goes on in every home in the world -- so what are your kids<br/>
learning?<br/>
<br/>
In CT, homeschooling has been an accepted practice for over 350 years. In<br/>
fact, it was so universal in the early days that when towns organized Common<br/>
Schools, the schools often did not accept children unless they already knew<br/>
how to read, write  and calculate -- skills that were presumed to have been<br/>
taught at home.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to today&#39;s barrage of mostly drivel, the tools for teaching were<br/>
few -- reading primers, arithmetic  lessons and penmanship, probably only a<br/>
few choices of materials that were familiar to most families. The lessons<br/>
were simple. The children were bright, as today, and they learned the<br/>
lessons easily, quickly and well. For example: put four pennies (or apples)<br/>
on the floor arranged in a square. It&#39;s hard to mistake that 2+2=4 and 1+3.<br/>
Those lessons are instantly and indelibly printed in a child. No review is<br/>
needed, no test required. Ever. But the parent has (dare I say it) taught<br/>
the lesson. The child can usually take it from there. Timing is important.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly, when a child needs (wants ! ) to learn how to read, such as in<br/>
the recent example of the smaller sister asking her older sibling in bed how<br/>
to say certain words that she pointed to on the page, such as HOP, one<br/>
person was helping the other to learn. It is not unusual that parents are<br/>
surprised by the abilities of their kids -- without any teaching. The reason<br/>
we are surprised sometimes is that we believe that learning is difficult and<br/>
takes a lot of teaching. That is the garbage that schools want us to<br/>
believe, so that we will maintain support for all their employees and<br/>
outrageous budgets.<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler (a staunch, radical, fanatical one) I am vehemently against<br/>
schooling -- the kind that is done in schools, and is directed by schoolers<br/>
for the benefit of the school establishment -- not the children. But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean I am against learning or even teaching, so long as it is asked<br/>
for by the learner.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, in CT, parents are required by that ancient law to make sure that<br/>
their children are instructed in reading, writing, math, geography, and<br/>
government. For homeschoolers, nobody is looking over our shoulders, but<br/>
citizens need to be aware that their children&#39;s knowledge of those things is<br/>
their responsibility. No tests are required here, parents must determine an<br/>
acceptable level of information that their kids need to know. The law is<br/>
kind, saying that parents need to be ABLE TO show that their kids have<br/>
received instruction....it doesn&#39;t say that we MUST show it (to anyone).<br/>
<br/>
My point is that UNschooling is a personal idea. Today&#39;s practice comes<br/>
primarily from the work and books of John Holt, who told us years ago that<br/>
the trouble with education is the schooling, the boring, life-crushing<br/>
tedium, the sit-down-shut-up-listen-to-this madness that drives kids crazy,<br/>
especially when there&#39;s so little that those places teach and how quickly<br/>
most kids can learn it ALL so that they can go out and play and discover how<br/>
the world really works.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s my point...let&#39;s not thrash each other for not UNschooling. I am not<br/>
Anti-Unschooling, but I am also not Anti-teaching when a kid asks for that.<br/>
Purity in unschooling (as some understand it, as *no teaching no matter<br/>
what*) is as much the enemy of learning as school is.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, for Luz and me, means providing the tools to a child so that<br/>
curiosity can be inspired and satisfied, preferably  not by scripted<br/>
lessons, but more by the initiative and ingenuity of the learner. Becoming<br/>
our children&#39;s schoolteacher/taskmaster is sure to poison our relationship<br/>
with them, but when they ask for specifics, we must not be so hung up on<br/>
UNschooling that we fail in our responsibility as parents.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that some parents don&#39;t know HOW to teach what their child<br/>
wants to know? Sure, it happens a lot. That&#39;s when they need to become<br/>
learners right along with the child. For example, I believe that part of the<br/>
resistance during the phonics discussion/tussle was because some folks are<br/>
convinced that Phonics is something that needs to be *taught* (saints<br/>
preserve us!) and they just weren&#39;t about to do that. But there is also the<br/>
hint that many people have no idea what phonics is, and school fashion has<br/>
told many people that Phonics is boring, repetitive, rote, rulebound,<br/>
old-fashioned, yadayada. That bad rap makes people fear that it requires a<br/>
whole lot of schooling. It&#39;s just not true...it comes from school teachers<br/>
who prefer therapy to teaching specific skills that even they are unsure of.<br/>
<br/>
Liza sends this brief list from a book that, on its cover, claims to be a<br/>
how-to-read book, but inside claims that it&#39;s not a how-to-read book. It<br/>
turns out to be both. From the book, Liza summarizes:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; the 6 ways to read:<br/>
&gt;&gt;1. Getting help from pictures<br/>
&gt;&gt;2. Remembering<br/>
&gt;&gt;3.Sounding out letters<br/>
&gt;&gt;4.Expecting what comes next<br/>
&gt;&gt;5.Writing<br/>
&gt;&gt;6.Making sense<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All of those are straight out of the Whole Language grab-bag.<br/>
<br/>
Now you tell me which *way* tells HOW to read. If we want to know what a<br/>
word sounds like so we can *read* it, we do #3. Being able to read<br/>
accurately means being able to turn the printed marks into specific familiar<br/>
sounds. What it&#39;s not is guesswork, although many people believe that<br/>
guessing at words is just fine.<br/>
Liza&#39;s book is right: it&#39;s not a how-to-read book when it tells us to use<br/>
pictures for clues (a strategy from whole language), or when it tell us to<br/>
remember words by their confuguration (look-say-good luck), when it tells us<br/>
to Expect what comes next (be fortune tellers), use writing (can we write if<br/>
we can&#39;t read?), and finally, Making sense...Please, how can it make sense<br/>
if we can&#39;t read it. Reading is a prerequisite for understanding, not the<br/>
other way round.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky for us all, kids find ways to learn on their own despite all the<br/>
miseducation we invent and therapies we use to avoid giving specific<br/>
instruction, even when it&#39;s begged for.<br/>
<br/>
I have plenty of contempt for the teaching trade for turning simple learning<br/>
into a secretive and corrupt occupation that can now demand huge sums from<br/>
the public trough to do terrible things to children. Luz got her masters in<br/>
Education and certification from U of Az and agrees that what she learned<br/>
there was debilitating, fraudulent and a waste of time -- all of it. Bad<br/>
teaching methods have become the hallmark of the schooling establishment,<br/>
and it is affecting even the most independent intelligent people --<br/>
homeschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
My hope is that we can get back to the common sense of our early settlers<br/>
and use direct methods to teach simple skills when they are needed and<br/>
requested, and then get on with real life. Learning how to read and<br/>
calculate each can take only a few minutes, total, perhaps spread out over a<br/>
few weeks. John Holt said that all of arithmetic can be learned in a single<br/>
morning, by a kid who&#39;s interested.  I can&#39;t forget that kid who said, I<br/>
learned UP and DOWN, and then I could read.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Compared to today&#39;s barrage of mostly drivel &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ned, I don&#39;t understand why you like to insert strong negativity into writing <br/>
that is otherwise uplifting and inspiring.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Purity in unschooling (as some understand it, as *no teaching no matter<br/>
what*) is as much the enemy of learning as school is.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is rhetorically powerful, but fallacious.<br/>
For one thing, I know of no &quot;no teaching no matter what&quot; &quot;understandings,&quot; <br/>
but of the importance of unschoolers considering what &quot;teaching&quot; is and is <br/>
not, and what hampers joyful learning.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;it comes from school teachers<br/>
who prefer therapy to teaching specific skills &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The rhetoric is really grating on me, and I think it&#39;s adding a film of <br/>
school-frustration and a political overlay which aren&#39;t conducive to the <br/>
discussion of what the families on this list are doing with their kids this <br/>
week, what has worked well, and what they&#39;re considering in the future.  <br/>
<br/>
The amount of drivel perceived by the politically minded in the media doesn&#39;t <br/>
help unschooling.  Characterizing teaching as therapy doesn&#39;t help.  <br/>
Badmouthing schools doesn&#39;t help.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a space where learning can be considered and discussed without the <br/>
shadow of schools or politics, and families which haven&#39;t learned how to get <br/>
over the stresses and fears could use as much time there as possible.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Learning how to read and<br/>
calculate each can take only a few minutes, total, perhaps spread out over a<br/>
few weeks. John Holt said that all of arithmetic can be learned in a single<br/>
morning, by a kid who&#39;s interested. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe the statement included it being a fifteen year old.<br/>
<br/>
The suggestion that parents need to spend even a few minutes a day &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
will cause doubt in some people here, and will be interpreted in a schooly <br/>
fashion, because they are of a schooly mindset, and still afraid because they <br/>
haven&#39;t seen natural learning work yet.<br/>
<br/>
I believe, Ned, that you haven&#39;t seen a child learn naturally either.  And <br/>
you could benefit from the dozens of examples people are sharing here, or you <br/>
could continue to ignore them and undermine and belittle them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think repeating your beliefs about teachers and phonics is <br/>
productive, nor is it answering any questions any others here are asking, and <br/>
neither will it bring people closer to natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Your son learned phonics from you and reads now, and so you are convinced <br/>
that did it.  Great!  That&#39;s one point of information.  It&#39;s not half of the <br/>
discussion, or shouldn&#39;t be.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again - what we have here is a failure to communicate &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Just like I think that MOST PEOPLE will hear you say &quot;Kids need phonics&quot; and <br/>
think you mean &quot;Kids need to be taught to read using a formal comprehensive <br/>
phonics program&quot; - I also think MOST PEOPLE hear the word &quot;teach&quot; or <br/>
&quot;teacher&quot; and think of someone deciding what, when, where, and how kids are <br/>
supposed to learn something and then testing and grading how well they do at <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Now - I&#39;m going to be pretty darn sure that long-time unschoolers don&#39;t mean <br/>
either of those things. If I hear a long-time unschooler say, &quot;Yeah- I taught <br/>
my daughter how to do long division,&quot; it doesn&#39;t bring up those connotations <br/>
to me. In that case, knowing how unschooling workds, I&#39;m going to assume this <br/>
came about because the kid wanted to do something and the parent offered the <br/>
information and so on.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - here, on this list, with nearly a thousand people and MANY of those <br/>
people who are just trying to figure out what all this unschooling stuff is <br/>
all about - many of those people start out not even able to conceive of what <br/>
unschooling is - it seems to me that people are going to be very confused and <br/>
even misled if you say either that kids need phonics or that kids need to be <br/>
taught. Again - I GET the point - I just think that in THIS context it is <br/>
something that we have to stop and clear up every time it gets said because <br/>
it is so easily and so likely misconstrued.<br/>
<br/>
It is okay - words can have multiple levels of meanings. &quot;I am my child&#39;s <br/>
first and most important teacher.&quot;  &quot;I am my child&#39;s parent and I am NOT my <br/>
child&#39;s teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have said both of those and meant them and they didn&#39;t contradict each <br/>
other IN the contexts in which I said them. <br/>
<br/>
So - in a context where there are lots of new-to-unschooling people - <br/>
remembering that &quot;phonics&quot; and &quot;teach&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; have connotations to <br/>
them that we don&#39;t mean - it is more helpful to avoid those terms and just <br/>
talk more descriptively about what we mean.<br/>

their child help? I haven&#39;t seen that. The unschooling parents I have seen <br/>
seem to all be incredibly resourceful, supportive, involved, observant, <br/>
intuitive, responsive facilitators. It wouldn&#39;t occur to me to worry that a <br/>
kid might want to learn to read and that an unschooling parent would not <br/>
figure out how best to help them or get help for them. Is that really <br/>
something you worry about?<br/>

division algorithm (to kids who already understand simpler division, keep in <br/>
mind).<br/>
<br/>
I was able to help my daughter learn to do long division in 30 minutes. <br/>
Literally - she started from knowing that 6 divided by 3 is 2 and we moved <br/>
from that to her being able to divide any-big-number by any-other-big-number <br/>
in amost exactly 30 minutes including enough practice time for her to <br/>
solidify her new ability. She thought it was cool and a wonderfully clever <br/>
technique. The secret? WAITING until she had a good reason to want to do it <br/>
AND until she had a deep full understanding of division - before helping her <br/>
learn a particular procedure.<br/>

first &quot;sound&quot; was &quot;M&quot; for MacDonalds. By the time they are five or six, many <br/>
(but not all - don&#39;t WORRY if your 6 yo isn&#39;t there yet), have picked up LOTS <br/>
of letter-sounds. So - they can often actually begin reading just a bit -- <br/>
lots of times they can do the first sound in a word - even though they <br/>
haven&#39;t picked up on vowel sounds yet. So if they are looking at a book and <br/>
there is a picture of a dog and the letters D-O-G are on the page, they kid <br/>
might know that first letter sound is the &quot;d&quot; sound and &quot;guess&quot; that the word <br/>
is &quot;dog&quot;.  This is not really reading - this is guessing with a bit of extra <br/>
information - first-letter sound and a picture. The kid could probably still <br/>
not read that word, &quot;d-o-g&quot; without the context of the picture. But if it IS <br/>
fun and satisfying, then the kid will keep at it. A parent might notice that <br/>
the child has guessed that the word is dog and might make a point of playing <br/>
some rhyming games using that word. Or might say, &quot;HOW did you know that word <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;log?&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 -- and that leads them to more reading and more learning about more letter <br/>
sounds and eventually they read fluently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-791151987">I completely agree with Pam.<br/>
<br/>
Aidan is 2.4 and competing full force with his brother. My MIL sent <br/>
them both frisbees that are exactly the same. So I gave one to each <br/>
and wrote their name. Now, Aidan has been seeing his name on his <br/>
door, on his presents, on pictures and especially every time he gets <br/>
signed in for computer games. Guess what, he definitely can tell the <br/>
difference between his name and his brother&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
We did the &#39;switch the frisbee&#39; trick and he still picked the right <br/>
one. Our friends did the &#39;behind the back switch&#39; and he still <br/>
pointed to the one with his name. If he finds Evan&#39;s frisbee he drops <br/>
it and looks for his. Not only that, now he truly recognizes his name <br/>
ELSEWHERE.  As with his name, he now also recognizes the numbers that <br/>
come up on our elevator up to 12 because, guess what, we live on the <br/>
12th floor. Then there is the birthday card incident: We were invited <br/>
to a neighbor&#39;s b-day and I gave Evan the card to sign. Not to leave <br/>
Thing2 out, I passed the card to him. There are 5 letters in his name <br/>
and, guess what, he made 5 scribbles, one next to the other and small <br/>
enough to look like that&#39;s where letters should go. I had nothing <br/>
like this with Thing1. To him a paper is still a universe with almost <br/>
no gravity: His letters look like they are hardly touching a <br/>
baseline. This tells me a few things:<br/>
<br/>
(1) Aidan is soaking up every bit of information that he can get from <br/>
his brother<br/>
(2) He may be benefiting from having a hyper-visual environment with <br/>
art and computers everywhere<br/>
(3) He is acquiring the skills that he will need to learn how to read and write<br/>
<br/>
When I say my kids are my own private National Geograhic I am not <br/>
kidding. It is truly &quot;smashing&quot; how they just are learning so much <br/>
and taking it all in without my former paradigm of learning (which <br/>
was teach, teach, teach). And what is more important is that they are <br/>
having fun with it. Aidan gets excited when he &#39;gets&#39; a new word (he <br/>
is starting to speak as well).<br/>
<br/>
Evan is allergic to any teaching but now is into adding thanks to the <br/>
Pokémon board game. And it was not until he got his library card that <br/>
he got that when somebody writes, if you know how to you can read <br/>
that writing. He signs his name on the Library&#39;s roster of &#39;little&#39; <br/>
clients . The librarian reads it and says, &quot;Well thank you Evan&quot;. He <br/>
turns to me and asks, &quot;How come she knows my name?&quot; I said, well <br/>
because she read it off the book after you signed it. He totally <br/>
flipped. He was so floored by the whole idea --and here I was all <br/>
along thinking that he understood this what I thought was an obvious <br/>
concept.<br/>
<br/>
Every day they are acquiring reading and writing skills and as <br/>
embattled Martha would say, THAT is a good thing.<br/>

&gt;first &quot;sound&quot; was &quot;M&quot; for MacDonalds. By the time they are five or six, many<br/>
&gt;(but not all - don&#39;t WORRY if your 6 yo isn&#39;t there yet), have picked up LOTS<br/>
&gt;of letter-sounds. So - they can often actually begin reading just a bit --<br/>
&gt;lots of times they can do the first sound in a word - even though they<br/>
&gt;haven&#39;t picked up on vowel sounds yet. So if they are looking at a book and<br/>
&gt;there is a picture of a dog and the letters D-O-G are on the page, they kid<br/>
&gt;might know that first letter sound is the &quot;d&quot; sound and &quot;guess&quot; that the word<br/>
&gt;is &quot;dog&quot;.  This is not really reading - this is guessing with a bit of extra<br/>
&gt;information - first-letter sound and a picture. The kid could probably still<br/>
&gt;not read that word, &quot;d-o-g&quot; without the context of the picture. But if it IS<br/>
&gt;fun and satisfying, then the kid will keep at it. A parent might notice that<br/>
&gt;the child has guessed that the word is dog and might make a point of playing<br/>
&gt;some rhyming games using that word. Or might say, &quot;HOW did you know that word<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t &quot;log?&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;-- and that leads them to more reading and more learning about more letter<br/>
&gt;sounds and eventually they read fluently.<br/>

both Evan and you had an AHA! at the library. :o)<br/>
