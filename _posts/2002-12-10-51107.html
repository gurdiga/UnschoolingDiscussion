<div id="ygrps-yiv-454741083">We see so many AWFUL parenting examples in public places - this was a very <br/>
very nice encounter:<br/>
<br/>
  I was in a restaurant last week and admiring the grandparents, parents <br/>
and 3 little children at the table next to us -- enjoying watching and <br/>
listening to the sweet way they all were with each other.<br/>
<br/>
As we were leaving, I heard the dad say to the grandparents, &quot;Well, we&#39;re <br/>
thinking about homeschooling - just keeping on doing what we&#39;ve been doing <br/>
seems like a good idea to us.&quot; OF COURSE, I stopped to eavesdrop -  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
The mom said, &quot;Seems like they&#39;re all learning all the time already and we <br/>
don&#39;t see why we need to send them off to school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Grandpa said, &quot;Sounds like a GREAT idea to me.&quot;<br/>
Grandma said, &quot;Me too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say anything - just walked on - but I wanted to give them the <br/>
grandparents/parents of the year award right then and there.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s kinda the response I got from my dad, though.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish you *had* been able to speak to those folks!  Thanks for sharing it.<br/>

father actually said anything like that I&#39;d think the &#39;pod&#39; people had gotten <br/>
to him ;)<br/>
