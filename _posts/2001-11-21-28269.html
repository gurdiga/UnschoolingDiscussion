At 03:14 PM 11/21/01 +0000, you wrote:<br/>

time as to respond with something like, &quot;So, I guess school works really<br/>

Tia,<br/>
Consider that I originally wrote that paragraph to read:<br/>
&quot;I personally want to know if my words are coming across meaning<br/>
something I don&#39;t.  When it happened frequently I went back to see if<br/>
I could figure out why.  But I could only do that if I heard what<br/>
others thought I mean in a resectful way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I changed the wording because the same thing had just happened with a<br/>
different person here just before I wrote it and I&#39;d seen it before.<br/>
So I decided it was applicable to many others and I rewrote to be a<br/>
neutral &quot;one&quot;.  If you saw something else, maybe you might want to<br/>
contemplate whether you are reading what I write, or what you THINK I<br/>
write.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I should think that one would want to know if one&#39;s words are<br/>
coming<br/>
&gt; &gt;across as meaning something they don&#39;t.  If it happens frequently<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt;might want to go back and reread one&#39;s own words to see WHY they<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; &gt;unintended effects.  But one can&#39;t do that unless one hears how<br/>
&gt; &gt;others interpreted him/her.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *If* it was important to that person that her words be heard in<br/>
exactly the<br/>
&gt; way she intended them by every person on this list, she would have<br/>
listened<br/>
&gt; to you by now and changed her &quot;evil&quot; ways.  Since she hasn&#39;t, I<br/>
assume that<br/>
&gt; your perceptions are not a priority for her.  Every time this issue<br/>
seems<br/>
&gt; to have settled down, up it pops again. You&#39;re flogging a dead<br/>
horse, Bridget.<br/>
