<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060136096">How funny!  I no longer think of pink poodles when I hear FiFi ( Feefee) but <br/>
it actualy fits our Ethan quite well, too!  He&#39;s got the sassy attitude and <br/>
charm as well.  And these beautiful long eyelashes and sparkling brown eyes <br/>
to match!  For a little boy who couldn&#39;t be any more BOY, he&#39;s also a <br/>
prancer and just bounces on air when he walks.  Maybe a male French <br/>
Poodle??? LOL<br/>
<br/>
My best friend has three kids and calls them poopers, bobo and teetee.  They <br/>
started out as Carly-Poo, Adam-Bo-Badum and Leah-Weah.  Leah&#39;s eventually <br/>
became we-we, then progressed on to teetee.  Don&#39;t ask me why but those all <br/>
stuck and I figure I&#39;ll tell Ethan it could be worse! Haha!<br/>

&gt;My DD Fiona is often called &quot;Fifi&quot;.  When she was first born my DS (then<br/>
&gt;2) crowned her Princess Fiona / Fifi.  I thought I&#39;d totally hate having<br/>
&gt;a Fifi (because of the French poodle thing;) but she totally wears the<br/>
&gt;name.  She&#39;s got this great sassy attitude and tons charm to pull it<br/>
&gt;off.  She&#39;s definitely a Fifi.  ;)<br/>
