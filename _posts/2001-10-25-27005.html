<br/>
10yo dd came in today and asked for math and spelling curriculum.  YIKES!<br/>
She doesn&#39;t set the world on fire in either of these areas admittedly, but<br/>
turns out she was subjected to a &quot;pop quiz&quot; by some of the kids in her<br/>
gymnastics class and &quot;failed&quot; miserably.  Adriane was mortified.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t handle herself well in these situations and tends to just stand<br/>
there and be embarrassed.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about how different kids learn different things even in the same<br/>
school system.....how the kids were just spouting off stuff they memorized<br/>
and were not smarter than her....different ways that situation could be<br/>
handled in the future....things that she knows, like animal husbandry, that<br/>
those kids probably don&#39;t know....she didn&#39;t really buy it.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out some available resources to learn what she was asking for,<br/>
told her I would help her, but that memorizing is basically just doing stuff<br/>
over and over until it sticks.  Adriane is more of an &quot;idea man&quot; and has<br/>
very little follow through.  I pointed out that if she really wanted to<br/>
memorize her multiplication tables, she would need to just bite the bullet<br/>
and do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?  Comments?<br/>

The public may be obsessed with collecting money....so are some private<br/>
industries.  Like airlines getting a $15 billion dollar bailout.  The whole<br/>
travel industry is hoping the loot the taxpayers by accessing corporate<br/>
welfare....hopiing to cash in in this tragedy.  Some non-profits are hoping<br/>
to cash in,  too.....like ones who are thick in the administrative cost<br/>
department,  and those who collect in the guise of 9/11,  but use donations<br/>
as general funds to support programs of their own agenda.<br/>
<br/>
As for John Q. Public and your typical Joe Sixpack.....well,  I am guessing<br/>
that we all want to DO something to *help*.  Most of us are not able to go<br/>
to one of the crash sites and remove rubble,  identify bodies,  comfort<br/>
families in the depths of grief.  But we WANT to.....many can donate<br/>
blood....which helps immensely, in general,  but probably didn&#39;t effectthe<br/>
outcome for many victims of 9/11.  Most people want to show support....and<br/>
the media tells us giving $$$$ is the way to do it.  So,  is there some<br/>
Latin phrase of wisdom for &quot;donator beware&quot; ??  We do need to investigate<br/>
those agencies receiving our assistance...financial or otherwise...to see<br/>
how they utilize funds to assist those the donator hopes to assist.<br/>
<br/>
JMHO,<br/>

I think the public has become obsessed with collecting money and I think the<br/>
media is having hayday with it.  Politics as usual!<br/>

&lt;&lt; And, exactly who is the money going to?  All I hear is fire fighters and<br/>
 WTC.  What about the folks in the Pentagon and on the flight that went down<br/>
 before it could do any damage? &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
   I have been thinking a lot about these people. There is hardly any <br/>
coverage on the status of the Pentagon or the crash in Pitt.. I often wish I <br/>
would hear of a source for contribution for these families. The plane crash <br/>
over Pitt. is probably foremost in my mind when thinking of flying back home <br/>
for a visit. I cannot imagine the scene at the time. Horrifying. It tears me <br/>
apart to think of these people on those planes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Poor little!  My 10yo dd has had this happen too.  My heart breaks because we make so much progress with her self esteem and then it is so easily knocked down.  Not to mention the immediate feelings of guilt I get for not working more on her times tables.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we need to give them more preparation for these things.  What would you say to those kids if you were in her shoes?  Give them a confident reply.  <br/>
<br/>
All those conversations about different learning styles, what she knows over them...those are lost at times like that.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good learning experience for realizing the damage you can do to another person with your words.  <br/>
<br/>
I would go ahead and get her a math workbook.  You can get those spectrum ones that are by grade and tell her to work at her own pace.  She may love it, she may hate it.  It&#39;s cheaper than a curriculum and will give her what she is looking for.  I have one child that adores her workbooks and my 10 hates them...but that is what she pulls out when she runs into something like that. (I buy them for the 10 too, because inevitably she feels jilted if she doesn&#39;t get one) <br/>
<br/>
They also use those workbooks when they &quot;play school&quot; with their friends.  They enjoy checking each others work.  And the answers are right in back...mine use these to check their own work....not so mortifying to catch your own mistakes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283638194">I think the media is convincing us that we, as Americans, must do something to help, somehting to show our patriotism.  And I think the media, and peer pressure are convincing many people that NOT giving money to the rc or whoever is pretty much unAmerican.  <br/>
<br/>
So, you want to do something...but what?  We are so stuck on this immediate gratification thing.  What I feel I need to do is not going to happen overnight.  I need to practice wha tthis tragedy has taught me all the days of my life.  Not just during this immediate crisis.<br/>
<br/>
I need to practice tolerance, I need to teach it to my children.<br/>
<br/>
I need to practice giving, I need to teach my dhildren to give.<br/>
<br/>
I need to sacrifice,  I need to teach my children to sacrifice.<br/>
<br/>
I need to pray, I need to teach my children to pray.<br/>
<br/>
I need to be willing to do the small stuff in my own neighborhood to promote unitedness,  I need to be proud of being an American---every day.  I need to sing God Bless America, I need to pledge allegiance to the flag from now until my death I need to do these things. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so easy to act in times of crisis...the hard part comes when the crisis is over...What will you do then?<br/>
