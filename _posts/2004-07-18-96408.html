<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585809654"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So, I should keep accumulating thousands of dollars worth of toys every<br/>
&gt;year because some day they *might* learn from all of them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, Abby,<br/>
If the relatives really are just chucking random toys into the bin and <br/>
giving them to your kids<br/>
AND<br/>
the kids don&#39;t really play with them much,<br/>
then<br/>
The answer is a garage sale, held by the kids if possible.<br/>
The kids list prices for each toy (that THEY decide they don&#39;t want <br/>
anymore), you slap a priced sticker on it and gather it in a box, ready for <br/>
sale day.  Make up some signs and get ready to be rich!  The kids (of <br/>
course) get to keep the money that comes from their toys.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are always setting up mini garage sales to empty their rooms and <br/>
get a little cash... of course, they&#39;re teens now, but they&#39;ve been doing <br/>
it for years.<br/>
<br/>
Win, win!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384107731">I too struggle with this.  Reading this list almost made me feel I <br/>
couldn&#39;t consider us an unschooling family w/out living in a sea of <br/>
toys and debris.  Then I started playdates at the homes of local <br/>
unschooling families and realized how separate the two are. Related <br/>
in some ways, but separate.  <br/>
<br/>
This is how we do it:<br/>
<br/>
My kids share a bedroom.  The baby is in my room, but the older two <br/>
share a room just big enough for their furniture (one of the <br/>
furniture being a big bookshelf for storing toys).  They have a big <br/>
closet, jammed full.  Under their bunkbeds: full.  Top of their <br/>
dresser: full.  Bookshelf: full.  There&#39;s about 30 square feet of <br/>
playspace in the middle of the room.  This does include their hand-<br/>
me-downs, games, diapers, etc as well as their extra sheets; I store <br/>
those mostly in high spaces where they can&#39;t reach anyway.  Orion <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a dresser to save space; I stack a plastic 3-drawer <br/>
thing ($19 at WalMart) on top of Morgaine&#39;s dresser, but this needs <br/>
to be rearranged as he is wanting to choose his own clothes now and <br/>
can&#39;t reach it.  The rule in the bedroom: I need to be able to walk <br/>
to the closet without tripping (very important since baby is on my <br/>
back most of the time), and when the space they have -- say the <br/>
Barbie bin -- is full, we either need to get rid of some Barbie <br/>
stuff or get rid of something else to make room for a new bin. <br/>
<br/>
The living room is mostly devoted to smaller kid stuff for now -- I <br/>
have two cabinet-style end tables (yard sale, $5/pair) and a little <br/>
cubby in our entertainment center.  One drawer is for Dan and me, <br/>
the rest is for kids&#39; toys that are baby-friendly.  Also all their <br/>
hotwheels, board books, and rocking toy.  When this space gets full, <br/>
I purge. <br/>
<br/>
With Morgaine and Orion&#39;s room, it can be hard for them (mostly <br/>
Morgaine) and I&#39;ll make suggestions, but sh makes the final choice.  <br/>
Often she prefers to give toys/clothes to friends rather than say <br/>
the Salvation Army.  <br/>
<br/>
I apply this to the rest of my home too.  If the sewing box gets <br/>
full, I sew or purge.  Video shelf, the same.  Etc.  I don&#39;t have a <br/>
basement and our shed is packed full.  <br/>
<br/>
Our home is far from clutter free but it&#39;s not the awful wall-to-<br/>
wall disaster it once was. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228290437">With 2 who have been very attached to stuff I recommend a couple<br/>
of things.<br/>
<br/>
 One, handing down to someone who will also love the thing is<br/>
much easier than giving it up to a yard sale or charity - find a<br/>
kid three years younger who would love to have hand me downs<br/>
(and enlist one 3 years older to pass on the &quot;done with&quot; stuff =<br/>
that makes the process natural).<br/>
<br/>
Second, boxing away:  as in &quot;you may or may not yet be ready to<br/>
give this away - let&#39;s put it in a box for awhile and then check<br/>
back later.&quot;  After a few months, it is easier for a kid to<br/>
separate what they want to keep from the dross.  In my<br/>
experience, about half of what is judiciously boxed (with the<br/>
agreement of the kid and loving, involved judgment of the Mom)<br/>
really is ready for handing on, especially to someone who will<br/>
appreciate it.  A quarter is &quot;outgrown&quot; - by some standard or<br/>
another  - but  needs to be kept for happiness; it heads to the<br/>
attic or garage, well packed for getting out at high school<br/>
graduation parties or to hand on to grandchildren.  The last<br/>
quarter is like Christmas all over again when you get it  out.<br/>
<br/>
A caveat - age range and other externals don&#39;t tell you what is<br/>
excess.  The child;s interests and ability to get to desired<br/>
items tell you when to act.<br/>
<br/>
How often to clear the clutter - how aggressively - and how long<br/>
to agree to store it before reopening are very individual.  It<br/>
is hard to maintain both actual respect for your kids and their<br/>
awareness of that respect unless you really evaluate and get<br/>
their buy in for the process. The fact that I use the same<br/>
method for thinning (ignore the pun) my own clothes may help<br/>
make it obvious that this is a tool, not an manipulation as used<br/>
here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083616954">You are not in this boat alone.  I have come up with a reasonable way to keep it all though, therefore respecting her wishes and keeping my sanity.  I buy large rubbermaid containers and every so often I box up stuff that hasn&#39;t been used in a year or so and we store it in the basement with her name on it. She can take them when she leaves or get into them should she really want to.  She feels that her wishes to keep her stuff are respected and I feel better about the amount of clutter in her room.  Actually, there is still a TON of clutter, but at least we can keep a fire path to the door and windows.  <br/>

live in a 2bdrm apartment.  So his room is shared with his little sister (who <br/>
mainly sleeps with me and dad, but all of her things are in there) and also 2 <br/>
stepchildren, who come on the weekends.  They also have a toybox and many clothes <br/>
that are kept here.  It&#39;s a large room, but with bunkbeds, 2 dressers, 4 toys <br/>
boxes, a floor to ceiling book shelf, and a small tv stand and tv, and a full <br/>
sized desk, floor space is VERY limited!!!!  I hadn&#39;t meant to make my letter <br/>
sound as if I complain to him about his emotional attatchments.  I NEVER do <br/>
this.   In fact, I rarely say anything to him, other than to encourage him to <br/>
always go with his feelings on things.  He will sometimes say things like, <br/>
&quot;Mom, you know how I am about my things, I just can&#39;t get rid of them&quot;  I always <br/>
tell him it&#39;s fine, so long as they stayed picked up.  The thing that makes the <br/>
clutter hard for ME to deal with, is that he doesn&#39;t like to clean up.  Not <br/>
his own room anyways.  He&#39;ll help around the rest of the house, but never wants <br/>
to clean his own room.<br/>

never wants <br/>
to clean his own room.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
   That might be because all that stuff feels<br/>
overwhelming.  If that&#39;s really a problem for him, I<br/>
might try to help him understand that that feeling<br/>
might be connected to how many things, in sheer<br/>
number, there are.  That&#39;s what finally helped my son<br/>
let go of some things.  <br/>
<br/>
And also, share with him the idea, if there&#39;s just so<br/>
many things that you can&#39;t possibly take care of them,<br/>
or know where anything is when you need it, really,<br/>
why have it? <br/>
<br/>
Or if something important gets broken from being at<br/>
the bottom of stuff not so important, how is that<br/>
honoring these things that you really love, if he has<br/>
sentimental attachments.   That made a change in my<br/>
son, when that happened.  He was really pissed, lol.  <br/>
<br/>
 There is still lots of clutter, but it all has it&#39;s<br/>
place when it&#39;s time to straighten up, now. <br/>
<br/>
Nothing gets ruined anymore, and nothing gets lost for<br/>
long, and when it becomes all to overwhelming to put<br/>
away, he knows to ask for help.  <br/>
<br/>
This took a coupla years, I think.  We&#39;ve reached a<br/>
pretty happy compromise at this point.  <br/>

part, with what he&#39;s got and how it&#39;s kept.  I&#39;m not, but, thats me, and the rest <br/>
of the place is kept how &#39;mom&#39; wants it.  I try very hard to respect the kids <br/>
space.  Especially seeing as it&#39;s shared space.  I know that alone takes it&#39;s <br/>
toll on Joshua.  He&#39;s really wanting his own room now, so I try hard not to <br/>
nag him over stuff.  I was just wondering if there were others out there in <br/>
similar situations where I might get advice to subtly encourage him to liquidate <br/>
some! <br/>
I&#39;ll try some of the idea&#39;s I&#39;ve gotten from here and see how it all goes.<br/>
