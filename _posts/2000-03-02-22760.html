Re: Mandatory AIDS vaccinations<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Report Predicts Massive Resistance to Mandatory AIDS Vaccine<br/>
&gt; Wes Vernon<br/>
&gt; Thursday, June 21, 2001<br/>
&gt; WASHINGTON - A new report predicts massive resistance to a mandatory AIDS<br/>
&gt; vaccine is coming in the U.S. in the next few years.<br/>
&gt; Millions of parents would refuse to have their children vaccinated by any<br/>
&gt; variation of an HIV/AIDS shot, the Committee to Protect Medical Freedom<br/>
&gt; said at a news conference Wednesday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The paper, titled &quot;If AIDS doesn&#39;t kill you, the AIDS vaccine will,&quot;<br/>
&gt; declared an AIDS vaccine would have HIV in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Among those supporting the findings of the study was Dr. Howard Umovitz, a<br/>
&gt; prominent member of a group of scientists calling for an HIV/AIDS vaccine<br/>
&gt; moratorium.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jim Turner, a Washington attorney and expert on the swine flu vaccine<br/>
&gt; scandal of the 1970s, lent his support, as did Barbara Lee Fisher,<br/>
&gt; co-founder and president of the National Vaccine Information Center.<br/>
&gt; Redmond Handy, an opponent of the military&#39;s mandatory anthrax vaccination<br/>
&gt; program, also warned of what he sees as the dangers of rushing into a<br/>
&gt; mandatory AIDS vaccine program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The thrust of the report, written by Clifford Kincaid, is that there&#39;s big<br/>
&gt; money in rushing the an AIDS vaccine to market, some of it tied up in<br/>
&gt; conflict-of-interest questions involving the promoters and their<br/>
&gt; connections with companies that stand to benefit. More to the point, he<br/>
&gt; says, there are indications that the vaccine, possibly to be administered<br/>
&gt; to 11- to 12-year-old children, or perhaps earlier, contains a risk of<br/>
&gt; inflicting the very disease it is intended to prevent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Promoting the idea of a mandatory AIDS vaccine is United Nations<br/>
&gt; Secretary-General Kofi Anan, along with high-tech magnate Bill Gates.<br/>
&gt; Kincaid challenges them to take the vaccine themselves if they are so<br/>
&gt; certain it is safe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some of the discussions on radio talk shows around the country indicate<br/>
&gt; &quot;the U.S. could witness massive civil disobedience against a massive<br/>
&gt; mandatory HIV/AIDS vaccine. Parents want to know what is in the vaccine,<br/>
&gt; and they should be told that it is a form of HIV that the government says<br/>
&gt; can cause AIDS,&quot; the report alleges.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jon Cohen, author of &quot;Deep Denial,&quot; published by the New York Academy of<br/>
&gt; Sciences earlier this year, is quoted as saying that &quot;medical products<br/>
&gt; sometimes do the opposite of what they are supposed to do, causing illness<br/>
&gt; rather than alleviating it. Such risk, of course, is common to all drugs,<br/>
&gt; but at least many sick patients accept that they would have fared poorly<br/>
&gt; even without the ill-fated drug treatment. Vaccines, in contrast, are<br/>
&gt; administered to [healthy] people, often children.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which means the vaccine would be targeted at those without AIDS. Further,<br/>
&gt; AIDS is most likely to be avoided by choosing a healthful way of life. The<br/>
&gt; study asks: Does it make sense to subject innocent children or AIDS-free<br/>
&gt; military personnel to a risk that could be greater than the that of the<br/>
&gt; disease, depending on the habits chosen as they go forward in their lives?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Polio and smallpox, for example, could strike without warning. The public<br/>
&gt; has been warned about AIDS and how to avoid it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In anticipation of Wednesday&#39;s news conference, various health agencies<br/>
&gt; have told Gannett News Service there was no plan to make the AIDS vaccine<br/>
&gt; mandatory for any American.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But Kincaid, the director of the Committee to Protect American Freedoms,<br/>
&gt; says the proof is available at the Web site of the U.S. Military HIV<br/>
&gt; research program, where it is openly stated that AIDS vaccines under<br/>
&gt; development will be &quot;licensed and used to protect military personnel.&quot;<br/>
&gt; These shots are not voluntary in the military service, he says.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Kincaid added that Dr. Deborah Brix, who runs the program, could have made<br/>
&gt; the denial in the 30 days since he asked her in writing a series of<br/>
&gt; questions about the program. His question included: &quot;Who made the decision<br/>
&gt; to use and mandate this vaccine on U.S. military personnel?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Barbara Loe Fisher, co-founder of the National Vaccine Information Center,<br/>
&gt; reports that a member of the federal committee that recommends vaccine for<br/>
&gt; children had said that an AIDS vaccine would be tested and then forced on<br/>
&gt; all 12-year-old children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Neal Halsey, M.D., chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)<br/>
&gt; Committee on Infectious Diseases, reminded HIV vaccine researchers and<br/>
&gt; developers at a meeting in February 1997 of an advisory committee of the<br/>
&gt; federal Centers for Disease Control that CDC plans to target 11- to<br/>
&gt; 12-year-old children for &quot;universal application&quot; of an HIV vaccine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Kincaid study says &quot;babies are being used as guinea pigs now.&quot; The<br/>
&gt; National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, under the auspices<br/>
&gt; of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, is sponsoring an<br/>
&gt; HIV vaccine test on babies born to HIV-infected women.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A spokesman for this program, where mothers have no ability to provide<br/>
&gt; informed written consent, has admitted that &quot;a small percentage of our<br/>
&gt; trial applicants have become infected&quot; and now have access to &quot;the best<br/>
&gt; medical care available.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One cannot get any details as to who the &quot;guinea pigs&quot; are. Have they<br/>
&gt; chosen to remain anonymous? &quot;Or are their identities being concealed<br/>
&gt; because they are dead or dying?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dr. Umovitz, a member of a group of scientists calling for a moratorium on<br/>
&gt; all HIV vaccine research, says coverage of &quot;promising&quot; vaccines is<br/>
&gt; extremely misleading, and those being tested so far appear harmful and<br/>
&gt; dangerous. Some undergoing trials increase the likelihood of infection and<br/>
&gt; accelerate the disease. In a paper, he quotes Dr. Albert Sabin as saying<br/>
&gt; the available data &quot;provide no basis for testing any HIV vaccine in<br/>
&gt; humans.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; U.N. leader Anan and Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has engaged in extensive<br/>
&gt; research on AIDS, think an AIDS vaccine just may be a &quot;secret weapon.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But the Committee to Protect Medical Freedom concludes: &quot;What if the<br/>
&gt; theory driving the vaccine research is scientifically bankrupt? .. What if<br/>
&gt; their war on AIDS proves to be a no-win war in which millions more die?<br/>
&gt; Then the world will move on to the next crisis and the same people may<br/>
&gt; still be in charge.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>

<br/>
You are so well informed! We, or at least I, would<br/>
like to read your source(s) first hand. If this is too<br/>
intrusive, please post to me off list. I&#39;ve let many<br/>
subscriptions lapse, but it seems it is about time to<br/>
renew some.  What do you recommend? Does anyone else<br/>
have suggestions for ways to keep aware of what is<br/>
REALLY happening? besides just &quot;reading between the<br/>
lines&quot; and subjectively interpreting everything. <br/>
<br/>
11 and 12 year olds don&#39;t need to be vaccinated for<br/>
AIDS. Yup, civil disobedience might be the ticket. How<br/>
tiresome. Phooey! If it&#39;s not one thing, it some<br/>
other.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-540389165">I subscribe to a bunch of online news sources and belong to several lists<br/>
that do news searches.  Also I read lots of newspapers and magazines and my<br/>
cousin has a clipping service clip articles on subjects from native rights<br/>
issues to liberatarian issues and she is kind enough to share those with me.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link for the above referenced one:<br/>

<br/>
And along those same lines:  .  Because children are leary of needles they<br/>
are now working on &quot;needless&quot; vaccines which they predict will be available<br/>
within the next 3 to 10 years.  1) A liquid flu &quot;shot&quot; that is swabbed on<br/>
the skin.  2)  Genetically engineered tomatoes and apples that grow a common<br/>
virus vaccine inside them--object so your kids will &quot;drink&quot; their vaccines<br/>
in fruit or vegetable juice.  3) Special shampoos that immunize against<br/>
things like rabies and malaria.  They are absorbed through your scalp.<br/>
