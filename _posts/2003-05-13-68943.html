<div id="ygrps-yiv-132536678">My son had soccer last night. He was telling us about this mean parent that was there. I was at work so missed it. One of the boys on his team came to get his waterbottle from his mom. She would not give it to him because she said he was standing around, not running hard and not paying attention to the game. She told him he was going to be further punished at home and now he couldn&#39;t have a drink for the entire game. My son was horrified and could not believe the stupidity of the parent. He could not see how the mom thought that would make the boy play better or like it at all.I too was horrified that this can happen in front of others and be tolerated. Also my heart went out for the 11 year old boy. I gotta wonder what a parent who will do that in public is doing in private.YUCK!!!<br/>

I wonder what the coach&#39;s take on it was.  My husband would have said<br/>
something to the parent.  No allowing water?  That&#39;s abuse.  I think dh<br/>
would have benched the kid for his own safety.  You can&#39;t run around that<br/>
much and not replenish fluids.<br/>

I was thinking the same thing. We&#39;re in San Diego, not as hot as New Mexico, but still a desert. We went out one day and didn&#39;t take extra water with us, it was mild and cool. The winds changed a sanna anna rolled in and we all got over heated and dehydrated. Jaiden was sick for a few days from it. Now when we go out we always take extra water, a couple of bottles.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;The meanest parents I&#39;ve ever heard of would more likely get mad at kids for not drinking waterwhen commanded to.&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I do know a father that is kinda like this though, he is convinced that his daughter doesn&#39;t know when she&#39;s thirsty. They come over a couple of times a month so his girls can play with Jaiden and Avery. His middle dd(4) is always asking for a drink, he is constantly telllering her no she&#39;s not thirsty. I was in shock the first time he said this, I mean not giving your kid a drink!?! Jason looked at him, handed his dd a glass of water and said &quot;in this house everyone can drink when ever they want to, if you don&#39;t like it, there&#39;s the door, and I&#39;ve got bottles of water Katie(dd) can take with her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He still says it, and we still ignore it.<br/>
