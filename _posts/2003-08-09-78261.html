<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boy, that would make me glad, too! LOL. We&#39;re not morning people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyhow, I&#39;m finding myself looking at catalogs, Internet sites, garage sales,<br/>
&gt; wondering what to buy.  Because we have always been a school at home family,<br/>
&gt; we don&#39;t have many games other than the regular &quot;milton bradley type&quot; board<br/>
&gt; games.  I don&#39;t want to blow a bunch of money on stuff that will just sit.  I<br/>
&gt; also don&#39;t want to fall into buying a bunch of curriculum.  I REALLY want to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this right.  If you were just beginning to unschool, knowing what you know<br/>
&gt; now, and you had some money to spend of fun, cool stuff, what would you buy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here we have a weekly allowance for every man, woman and child to spend on<br/>
what they like; when we&#39;re &quot;in funds&quot; ;) we buy other stuff (we just<br/>
finished a big job that will allow us to buy a computer upgrade and a new<br/>
TV, for example). I would hand over the money to the kids and let them pick<br/>
now or save for later, their choice. Keep a portion of it yourself and buy<br/>
what interests YOU (whether that&#39;s gardening supplies or cooking stuff or<br/>
fancy mice or novels about regency England) and, if you&#39;re feeling<br/>
agreeable, share those interests with any interested child, and of course<br/>
take a keen interest in what they use their time and money on, too.<br/>
<br/>
The money doesn&#39;t have to be spent now. &quot;Back to school&quot; time is only for<br/>
schools, you don&#39;t have to figure out a year&#39;s worth of interests and fun by<br/>
Sept. 1.<br/>

&gt; Also, what would you do for a while?  Would you take a good while and see<br/>
&gt; what everyone wants to do?  Am I getting ready to be pulled like taffy into 6<br/>
&gt; different directions? :oO<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and possibly yes. ;) Think of fun things you&#39;d like to do and places<br/>
you&#39;d like to go and invite them. They&#39;ll come up with their own, too, and<br/>
soon you&#39;ll all be so busy juggling schedules you&#39;ll wonder what you were<br/>
worried about.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2 of my boys can barely read, and it means a LOT to them to be able to.  If<br/>
&gt; learning to read is what a child REALLY wants, would any of you get some sort<br/>
&gt; of aides or maybe computer games to help them with this?  Would you just read<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lot to them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d offer to help them in any way they wanted help. If you do start &quot;a<br/>
curriculum&quot; with them to read, make sure you make it clear that it&#39;s their<br/>
choice whether to start or continue, their choice when they want to end it,<br/>
and that if the curriculum doesn&#39;t happen to work out for them that it is<br/>
ITS fault, not theirs.<br/>
<br/>
One thing my 8 year old enjoy these days is reading books with me -- she<br/>
reads the words she knows and I read the rest.<br/>
