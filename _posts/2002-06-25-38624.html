<div id="ygrps-yiv-745964210">Reading these posts about children having responsibility around the <br/>
house has been interesting to read, as well as slightly amusing.  I <br/>
spent a lot of time &quot;wishing&quot; my family were more neat.  Then I had a <br/>
revelation, I&#39;m not neat!  Then I thought why should I expect them to <br/>
be.  My bedroom is a mess.  Do I &quot;wish&quot; it was clean and orderly?  <br/>
Yes!  Will I clean it?  When I can&#39;t stand it anymore I will.  So I <br/>
put no pressure on my children to clean their rooms.  The common <br/>
areas are different though.  But we work together to keep these <br/>
clean. This is everyones responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
This is the mantra I encourage over and over.  It comes from the <br/>
Simple Abundance Book, by Sarah Ban Breathnach.<br/>
<br/>
  If you take it out, put it back.<br/>
  If you open it, close it.<br/>
  If you throw it down, pick it up.<br/>
  If you take it off, hang it up (in our house no one hangs anything <br/>
up so I have adjusted this one to, put it in the drawer, in the <br/>
hamper or throw it down the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
Do these things happen daily at our house? No.  Do I expect them to?  <br/>
Let&#39;s say I start everyday hopeful.  I do encourage one thing to be <br/>
put away before getting something else out.  We all know that team <br/>
clean up is easier if this advice is followed, but it doesn&#39;t always <br/>
happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned to be more relaxed about these things since we started <br/>
homeschooling.  It&#39;s my wasted energy to stress about house cleaning, <br/>
no one else worries about it, and when it need to get done it gets <br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents:)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our cleanup philosophy is similar to yours, Tammy.  I<br/>
call it &quot;unchoring.&quot; ;-)  I despise housework, so here<br/>
is what we do:<br/>
<br/>
1. Every night before bedtime we clean up.  That just<br/>
means picking up the stuff we took out during the day,<br/>
making sure all the laundry is in the laundry basket,<br/>
dishes in the sink, etc.  My 6yo is good about helping<br/>
me with this, and the 4yo is coming along (it&#39;s her<br/>
bedtime, so she can be a bit grouchy).<br/>
<br/>
2. I do dishes three times a week (it&#39;s just the three<br/>
of us, and we&#39;re all little and don&#39;t eat much! <br/>
hehe).  When I do dishes I have them run around and<br/>
check for any we might have missed.  I have them<br/>
convinced that this is a fun game.  (My mom did the<br/>
same thing with me when I was little.)<br/>
<br/>
3. Laundry is another nightmare task so I do it once<br/>
or twice a week.  The kids help by putting their dirty<br/>
clothes in the laundry baskets after they take them<br/>
off.  I saw someone (maybe on this list) say that they<br/>
had their seven year old do their own laundry.  My 6.5<br/>
year old can&#39;t reach the washing machine controls so<br/>
that is pretty much out.  Besides, the washer and<br/>
dryer are in the basement and there are spiders down<br/>
there (yuck).<br/>
<br/>
4. Dusting and polishing?  What&#39;s that?<br/>
<br/>
5. My kids love to help with cooking and yard work, so<br/>
no problem there.  Basically wherever they want to<br/>
pitch in I let them, and they are gradually getting<br/>
the idea that less chores for mommy = more mommy time<br/>
for them.  This idea forms the basis of our lazy<br/>
unchoring philosphy.<br/>

way to get the kids involved.  <br/>
