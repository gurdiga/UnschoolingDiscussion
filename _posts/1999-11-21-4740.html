<div id="ygrps-yiv-534633232">youve all seen or kept a recipe at one time or another of homeade playdough, <br/>
but we made this one again yesterday and it is fabulous.  even though we made <br/>
it with whole wheat flour that was no longer fresh, it has a wonderful soft <br/>
texture and is especially fun to play with while still warm.  so i thought <br/>
i&#39;d share:<br/>
(we always at least double for several children)<br/>
    1 cup flour<br/>
    1 T salad oil<br/>
    1 cup water<br/>
    1/2 cup salt<br/>
    2 t cream of tartar<br/>
    food coloring<br/>
combine all ingred. in a saucepan.  use a wooden spoon to stir over medium <br/>
heat.  stir constatnly to prevent sticking.  the mixture will be soupy for <br/>
several minutes and then suddenly it will stick together and can be stirred <br/>
into a ball.  when it thickens, remove from heat and continue stirring.  turn <br/>
the hot ball out onto a floured surface, and begin kneading as it cools.  can <br/>
be colored w/ food colors, keeps in the fridge in a covered container.<br/>

<br/>
Cream of tartar is left over after grape juice has fermented into wine...<br/>
it&#39;s precipitated from the tartaric acid in the grapes.  I expect it<br/>
improves the texture of the playdough... I&#39;ve never tried to make it without<br/>
it.<br/>

it&#39;s much less expensive that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121220673">THANK YOU!!! for this playdough recipe.  I had used it over a year ago from<br/>
the Usborne Playdough book.  We lost the book and Usborne had to discontinue<br/>
selling it due to naming rights issues.<br/>
    Though it took a bit of muscle,  this recipe is terrific!<br/>

Combine in a saucepan and heat until it forms a sort of stiff ball in <br/>

We make this recipe a lot.  In our hot, humid summers, it will mold if we <br/>
don&#39;t store it in the refrigerator.<br/>

The kids play with it on the dining room table. It&#39;s plenty roomy enough and<br/>
the table is old and I can just wipe off the dough marks anyway when they<br/>
are done. There&#39;s tile on the floor (brand new thanks to Joe) and when they<br/>
are done, I let is set awhile, and just sweep it all up with the broom. It&#39;s<br/>
much easier to clean up when it hardens.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I forgot to mention that the wilton colors seem a bit pricy at <br/>
<br/>
frist.  I think about $10-12 for a pack of 8-10.  BUT, you use so <br/>
<br/>
little each time, it will last you for a really long time.  Much <br/>
<br/>
cheaper than food coloring in the long run which I used tons of to <br/>
<br/>
try and get a strong color.  This product make the loveliest colors <br/>
<br/>
I have found, comparable to store bought. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We make black playdough with that.  It&#39;s cake decorating stuff--very <br/>
concentrated, so you stick a toothpick in it and get a teensy bit, less than when you <br/>
clean wax out of your ear on an average day, and that colors a whole batch of <br/>
playdough.   <br/>
