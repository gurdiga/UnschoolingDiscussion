  &gt; I must have missed something!! What are you guys taking about , what kind of<br/>
  &gt; book writing?<br/>
  &gt; Thanks for letting me know<br/>
<br/>
  November is National Novel Writers Month. There&#39;s an organization called<br/>
  NaNoWriMo.org that challenges everyone who has ever thought about writing to<br/>
  write a 50,000 word novel in 30 days -- between Nov 1 and midnight Nov 30.<br/>
<br/>
  The basic idea is that we&#39;re each our biggest roadblocks to writing. We want<br/>
  our writing to be great so we think about it too much and put it off or edit<br/>
  too much trying to get something perfect. So the challenge is to just write<br/>
  without concern for quality. It&#39;s *quantity* that counts in November, not<br/>
  quality. :-)<br/>
<br/>
  And by not caring about quality people can produce some pretty good writing<br/>
  :-) I remember reading in a book on writing that several authors basically<br/>
  do write that way. Their goal is to produce 1000 words a day. And one was<br/>
  quoted as saying that some days he produces what feels like great stuff and<br/>
  some days he produces what feels like crap but then when he reads it later<br/>
  they&#39;re both equally good.<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter Kathryn (13) and I participated this year. (And completed it!<br/>
  Yeah! :-) Hers is done. Mine is still going. (50,000 is the minimum for a<br/>
  published novel.) (I probably couldn&#39;t have done it if Kathryn wasn&#39;t too<br/>
  since she was perfectly content to write for several hours a day which gave<br/>
  me time to also. And also that we didn&#39;t have visitors for Thanksgiving!)<br/>
<br/>
  And I&#39;d definitely not say writing for NaNoWriMo is &quot;writing for no reason&quot;!<br/>
  It was writing for fun! :-)<br/>
<br/>
  ===========Here&#39;s a bit of Kathryn&#39;s:<br/>
  [Hers takes place in this world she&#39;s developed over many years.]<br/>
<br/>
  Bane&#39;s Awakening<br/>
<br/>
  Story premise recap thing (just so you get the idea of what&#39;s going on):<br/>
<br/>
  Avn Hisky is a pearly pink cat that can walk upright like a human. She lives<br/>
  in an enormous gigantic company called Katzah Korp. with her friends, Spot,<br/>
  Tiger, Pachiki and her little sister Star. And along with about fifty<br/>
  thousand other cats. Katzah Korp. is owned by the never seen Mr. Katzah who<br/>
  holds classes where the cats in his company make products. Such as comic<br/>
  books and comic strips, origami ornaments for all kinds of occasions,<br/>
  pottery and other things he can sell at a high price. Mostly, the cats enjoy<br/>
  it in Katzah Korp. but try to get back at Mr. Katzah for various reasons.<br/>
  Such as, he is an overly powerful rich moron who thinks he&#39;s better than<br/>
  everyone else and likes money. But, Mr. Katzah does like one cat. His name<br/>
  is Richard Richmond. He has almost as much money as Mr. Katzah does.<br/>
<br/>
  Chapter one: The first chapter of many (well, this isn&#39;t actually a chapter<br/>
  so much as it is a devisor between the prologue and the actual story)<br/>
<br/>
  Avn woke up to a chilly Autumn morning. She pulled herself out of her bed<br/>
  and slid into her fuzzy, warm and brown football slippers. She then went<br/>
  over to her closet and pulled on a leopard patterned winter robe. Once she<br/>
  was ready, Avn headed down stairs to the enormous Breakfast Hall. (Which was<br/>
  also the Lunch and Dinner Hall, but anyway).<br/>
<br/>
  Avn stared up at the 54 different things that were on the breakfast menu.<br/>
  Cats would give ideas and then usually the food ideas would go on the menu.<br/>
  There was a new item on the menu called &quot;Bob and Larry&#39;s seafood chili&quot;. For<br/>
  some unknown reason, when new items were added, they were added to all of<br/>
  the menus. Maybe it was to see for which meal it was usually ordered, then<br/>
  the menu person (whomever that may be) would put it on that menu.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;What are you going to get?&quot; asked Avn&#39;s best friend Spot as he walked into<br/>
  the Breakfast Hall.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Not &#39;Bob and Larry&#39;s seafood chili&#39;,&quot; Avn replied.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Same with me. But that narrows the choice of breakfast down to fifty<br/>
  three,&quot; said Spot.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Exactly. How about Pineapple Fruit Bowl?&quot; asked Avn.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Huh? Never heard of that one. What is it?&quot; Spot asked in return.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;It&#39;s a pineapple cut in half lengthwise with some of the fruit scooped out<br/>
  to make sort of a bowl. The fruit that was scooped out is then diced and<br/>
  mixed together with grapes and other diced fruits like melons, apples and<br/>
  oranges and such and then put inside the pineapple half. It&#39;s really good&quot;<br/>
  replied Avn.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Sounds yummy! I&#39;ll try it!&quot; Said Spot.<br/>
<br/>
  They ordered two Pineapple Fruit Bowls and sat down with their breakfasts at<br/>
  one of the many many gray plastic tables in the Breakfast Hall.<br/>
<br/>
  Then, two of Avn and Spot&#39;s friends walked into the Breakfast Hall, ordered<br/>
  breakfast, came over and sat down with Avn and Spot.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Yo peeps! How ya doin&#39;?&quot; said the tiger striped one, whose name was Tiger.<br/>
  Tiger believed that martians were going to take over the planet and suck out<br/>
  everyone&#39;s souls and eat them on their toast.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;We&#39;re doing good! As long as we don&#39;t eat a bowl of Bob and Larry&#39;s seafood<br/>
  chili.&quot; Said Avn.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I hear that!&quot; said Tiger raising his glass of ruby red grapefruit juice.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Attention! Attention!&quot; Boomed a loud, commanding and all too familiar voice<br/>
  over the loud speaker. It was the voice of Mr. Katzah. &quot;I have a special<br/>
  delivery for anyone who can take care of and wants one! Meet me in the Main<br/>
  Hall as soon as you can. I&#39;ll be there or I&#39;ll have someone stationed there<br/>
  all day. That is all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I wonder what &#39;It&#39; could be?&quot; Avn mused.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Probably the world&#39;s largest Jolly Rancher. Or a living ball of fluffy pink<br/>
  and/or blue cotton candy! Ah, heaven...&quot; sighed Tiger.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Uh, yeah. But, knowing Mr. Katzah, it might just be. Who knows?&quot; said<br/>
  Pachiki sipping her Fruit Soup.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;What&#39;s in that stuff anyway? I&#39;ve thought about trying it. Is it good?&quot; Avn<br/>
  asked Pachiki, pointing at her Fruit Soup.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Fruit juices and the syrup stuff that&#39;s in the cans of fruit for the broth,<br/>
  and chopped up fruit and chopped up canned fruit. It&#39;s sweet, but very<br/>
  good,&quot; replied Pachiki.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Well, once I&#39;m done with my Ham and Cheese Scone, I&#39;m going to go see what<br/>
  &#39;It&#39; is! Anyone want to join me?&quot; asked Tiger.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Sure! I&#39;ll be done with my breakfast soon too,&quot; said Spot.<br/>
<br/>
  ========= And a bit of my fantasy titled &quot;Flight&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I will rip his eyeballs out and impale them on a spit and roast them until<br/>
  they burst. I will rip his nose off and season it with fire pepper and feed<br/>
  it to Tagira. I will rip his lips off andS&quot; dark haired Magla chanted into<br/>
  the warm wind rushing into her as the massive orange tiger beneath her<br/>
  bounded over ragged rocks and scrubby scrouse bushes.<br/>
<br/>
  Kaya rode near Magla on the back of a jewel blue dragon, its powerful wings<br/>
  thrusting rider and mount just a few hand breadths above the ground. This<br/>
  was going downward in more ways than one, Kaya thought and tuned out her<br/>
  clanmate. Not that Kaya didn&#39;t agree with the sentiment. She just didn&#39;t<br/>
  need to hear it graphically spelled out.<br/>
<br/>
  Tagira the tiger, carrying her small, spewing rider, leapt over the<br/>
  outcropping and dropped down to the dusty rocky path that led around the<br/>
  side of the mountain. Chengdo, Kaya&#39;s dragon, banked gracefully to follow<br/>
  Tagira, then abruptly plummeted down the side of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Cheeennngggdooooo!&quot; Kaya screamed pulling at the emerald green reins<br/>
  attached to the ruby red halter. But the dragon was oblivious to external<br/>
  commands for spilling out of a split in the side of the mountain was a tam<br/>
  bush, laden with fat purple berries. A sinuous twist to face upward and the<br/>
  dragon slammed into the rocky cliff, golden claws splayed feeling for tiny<br/>
  cracks and miniscule crevices. And her dragon began to feed on the one food<br/>
  dragons could never resist. Kaya clung to the neck of the dragon, settling<br/>
  her bottom on the backrest of the tooled leather dragon saddle, specially<br/>
  designed for this inevitable occurrence. She buried her face in the soft<br/>
  blue feathery scales of the dragon&#39;s neck and prepared to wait.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Kaaaayaaaa!&quot; Magla called from above.<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Down here!&quot; called Kaya. &quot;Chengdo spotted tam berries.&quot; She didn&#39;t need to<br/>
  say more. Magla&#39;s deep sigh drifted down to her. &quot;Go on without me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;No, I can&#39;t. This is an insult to both of us. We must confront the beast of<br/>
  a monk together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Which was true. Her fist thudded against the dragon&#39;s neck in frustration<br/>
  but the dragon paid no heed to her. She could feel the muscles beneath the<br/>
  scales working as the dragon stripped the berries from the bush and worked<br/>
  them rhythmically into a pulp with his tongue. Chengdo&#39;s breath rumbled<br/>
  deeply in his chest like the purring of a contented cat.<br/>
<br/>
  Kaya breathed deeply as she&#39;d been taught, letting go of the air and the<br/>
  tension and the desire to control what was uncontrollable. After 50 deep<br/>
  slow breaths she felt the dragon&#39;s grip relax. Chengdo pushed himself away<br/>
  from the craggy cliff. He thrust out his leathery wings catching huge scoops<br/>
  of the late spring air to twist acrobatically around until the two of them<br/>
  were hovering above Magla and Tagira.<br/>
<br/>
  A gentle nudge from Magla and Tagira twisted as gracefully as Chengdo as<br/>
  though the two were adversaries in some fall athletic competition. Tagira<br/>
  bounded up the mountain, catching purchase where no earthbound creature<br/>
  should be able to go. Chengdo followed easily, now a complementary partner<br/>
  in their powerful dance across the mountainous terrain.<br/>
<br/>
  The two pairs of riders and mounts reached the peak and paused to look down<br/>
  at the rock carved monastery and village of the herding people. The tiger<br/>
  stood proudly atop the stone perch as the dragon settled next to him.<br/>
<br/>
  After a few moments of deep admiration for the patch of emerald green<br/>
  nestled in a rocky bowl of the mountain range, Kaya called, &quot;Find Xan.&quot; The<br/>
  tiger&#39;s ears flicked back as it caught the familiar name. Then the tiger and<br/>
  dragon locked in a contest to be the first to spot the monk.<br/>
<br/>
  The tiger won by an eye blink and bounded down the mountain. The dragon<br/>
  launched outward twisting and stretching into a banking circle high over the<br/>
  curving patch of vegetation, its golden eyes locked onto the one the friends<br/>
  sought. With a gathering of wings, Chengdo dropped like hawk after a rabbit.<br/>
  This would be no contest for the dragon could drop through the air faster<br/>
  than the tiger could bound down the cliff.<br/>
