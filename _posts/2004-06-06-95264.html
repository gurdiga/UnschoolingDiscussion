<div id="ygrps-yiv-541991161">&quot;The reason to make the bed in New Mexico is to keep the sand out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
   Same here.<br/>
Only making them doesn&#39;t always work! Sometimes after a day at the beach, there&#39;s so much sand in their scalps that even a shower doesn&#39;t get it out. But it sure finds it&#39;s way out as they sleep.:)<br/>
Even the dirt here is more like gritty, ugly sand, and it seems to find it&#39;s way into every corner of my house, beds included.<br/>
