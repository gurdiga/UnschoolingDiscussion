 </span></blockquote>Who&#39;s &#39;we&#39;, and is the water worse than it was in the 1970s?  San Francisco<br/>
and Chicago have fine water.  LA doesn&#39;t, but LA&#39;s lucky to have any water.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; expensive filters or bottled water), water on our beaches that is too toxic<br/>
&gt; to swim in, food that is genetically modified and pesticided to hell and<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Worse than the 1960s and 1970s?  I&#39;m sure the pesticides aren&#39;t worse than<br/>
_Silent Spring_ days.  And there&#39;s all this organically grown food you can buy<br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
As for gene modification... rant time.  <br/>
<br/>
The question of whether GMOs are safe is, in a sense, meaningless.  It depends<br/>
on what the modification _is_.  Obviously if you put belladonna poison genes<br/>
into a potato the potato isn&#39;t going to be safe!  Of course, the companies<br/>
don&#39;t do anything that stupid.  Is it possible that some other modifications<br/>
might have odd side effects, or limit food value, since we don&#39;t know<br/>
everything about how nutrients are absorbed?  Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the belief some people have that genetically modified food<br/>
is inherently bad is simply crap science.  Our &quot;natural&quot; food, animal and<br/>
vegetable, is quite removed from its wild form, and cells don&#39;t care where<br/>
their genes come from.<br/>
<br/>
And when we&#39;re contemplating the possible riskiness of GM food, consider the<br/>
other risks in life.  Any obvious poisons, and hopefully allergens, aren&#39;t<br/>
going to be put into the food, so the most likely drawback is a bit of extra<br/>
carcinogenicity, on top of the carcinogens already in the food naturally, on<br/>
top of the pesticides, on top of the for-most-Americans much bigger risks of<br/>
eating too much saturated fat and sugar, and not enough fruit and vegetables,<br/>
and not getting enough exercise.<br/>
<br/>
Not that cancer is good.  But I&#39;m saying _if something goes wrong_ the most<br/>
likely risk is a slightly increased chance of cancer.  This is something you<br/>
worry about after changing your diet and stopping smoking and starting<br/>
exercising, because heart disease is a lot more likely to kill you than<br/>
cancer.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I admit that in the era of mad cow disease prions there are other things<br/>
to worry about, and sometimes I feel the companies are a bit too sanguine<br/>
about our food supply.  But I don&#39;t like seeing unscientific fear of genetic<br/>
engineering or cloning, either.<br/>
<br/>
End rant.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; back, and rolling power blackouts. Hmmm, we&#39;re not quite there yet, but give<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The rolling blackouts would be more relevant if they were related to a<br/>
systematic shortage of power and overconsumption of energy.  In fact<br/>
California is 47th in power usage, partly because of mild climate but also<br/>
because of aggressive conservation measures -- starting from the 1970s.  And<br/>
the lack of power is not from some global shortage but because we haven&#39;t<br/>
built any plants in a decade.  Because we&#39;re so democratic (as in popular<br/>
input into everything) and environmentalist (trying to get that clean air and<br/>
water back, after the 1970s) that no one&#39;s been able to build one.  And<br/>
deregulation wasn&#39;t designed very well, and there&#39;s evidence of power<br/>
suppliers trying to cut supply and raise prices.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s a big problem here, but seeing it as a sign of oncoming doom is<br/>
unsupportable.  This is a specifically political local fuckup.<br/>

  are a virus, or any of the <br>several other horror-tales which have been

  that any family is always negative. &nbsp;I don&#39;t believe any <br>one human 
  REALLY believes the world is a cesspool of pollution and sin and <br>malice. 
  &nbsp;But there were glimpses of such naysaying and doomspeaking here on 
  <br>this list, lately. <br><br>People shouldn&#39;t say things which aren&#39;t backed 
  up by facts, and there are <br>sources for far-edge, fright-facts. &nbsp;There 
  are such sources for <br>environmentalists, and for nutritionists, and for 
  educators, and home <br>educators, and the conservative right and the radical 
  left. &nbsp;There are <br>sources for fundamentalist Christians to stay so 
  riled up all day, every day, <br>about the devil in Pokemon and the evil in 
  television that they could NEVER <br>take a calm, deep breath and look at the 
  sky and be happy to have their <br>children with them. <br><br>I could tell 
  you all scare stories about teaching too, but I won&#39;t. <br>We could invite 
  someone in here (if there&#39;s not one already) who could tell <br>child 
  protective services horror stories, or police-work horror stories. &nbsp; 
  <br>Let&#39;s Don&#39;t!! <br><br>It&#39;s not sugarcoating the truth to turn your face 
  toward the light instead of <br>toward the dark. &nbsp;There IS light, and 
  there IS darkness. &nbsp;Now what? &nbsp;We <br>cannot destroy darkness. 
  <br><br>It&#39;s not sugarcoating the truth to introduce your children to other 
  families <br>you would like for them to be like and maybe to marry into or 
  learn from or <br>hang out with for life, instead of taking them to parole 
  hearings or a bar to <br>find them some new friends who aren&#39;t working in the 
  daytime anyway and have <br>some free time and REALLY know what the REAL truth 
  about life is, without <br>&quot;sugarcoating.&quot; <br><br>There are unquestionably 
  ugly and horrible things happening right at this <br>moment, right in my town. 
  &nbsp;When Holly wakes up and comes in here, she will <br>want me to smile at 
  her and make that moment sweet and good. &nbsp;If she drinks <br>faucet water 
  I won&#39;t scream and throw the glass down. &nbsp;If she plays in the <br>dirt I 
  won&#39;t talk to her about bacteria or feces. &nbsp;If she picks up a bird&#39;s 
  <br>nest from the ground, I won&#39;t slap it away and lecture her on bird lice. 
  &nbsp;If <br>she rubs noses with the dog or cats I won&#39;t discuss unsanitary 
  mucus horrors <br>with her. &nbsp;I will be pleasant and patient and that will 
  make her life today <br>better than if I set my mind on ugliness and horror 
  and treat her like a <br>character in Mad Max or Water World or Tank Girl or 
  whatever end-of-world <br>panic some people on this list seem to be 
  fantasizing about. <br><br>If I were to have said nothing about the natural 
  death of birds or wild cats <br>in Maryland, would this list have been more 
  peaceful or the people on it <br>happier? &nbsp;&quot;Balance&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; are what

  <div><br></div><tt>No offense, but this answer is very head in the 
  sandish.<br><br>&quot;San Francisco and Chicago have fine water.&quot;&nbsp; Define 
  &quot;fine.&quot;&nbsp; As someone who<br>has seen the water reports, I guess having 
  only slightly more heavy metals<br>in your water than the end result of some 3 
  level processing sewer farms<br>could be considered &quot;fine.&quot;&nbsp; I mean, all 
  things being relative.<br><br>&quot;I&#39;m sure the pesiticides aren&#39;t worse than 
  Silent Spring Days.&quot;&nbsp; They are<br>simply different pesiticides and every 
  bit as bad.&nbsp; There is more arsenic in<br>the water, more farm crop run 
  offs and all those pesticides that we<br>supposedly stopped using are still 
  there.&nbsp; DDT is a happy little camper that<br>is still at above acceptable 
  levels many years after it has been banned.<br>Rules like &quot;don&#39;t use within 
  100 feet of a water source&quot; are a joke.&nbsp; Since<br>when did runoff respect 
  the 100 foot rule?<br><br>Now for a real rant &lt;g&gt;&nbsp; &quot;Of course, the 
  companies don&#39;t do anything that<br>stupid.&nbsp; Is it possible that some 
  other modifications might have odd side<br>effects . . .&quot;&nbsp; Sorry, of 
  course the companies DO do things that stupid!<br>Can we spell 
  c-i-g-e-r-e-t-t-e-s?&nbsp; And I don&#39;t consider death to be an odd<br>side 
  effect.&nbsp; When you start splicing genes and you don&#39;t label the 
  product<br>as containing those various genes, you risk (and it isn&#39;t a 
  minor<br>possibility, it is a probability and has already happened) death as 
  your end<br>result.&nbsp; Not from cancer but from allergic reactions.&nbsp; 
  Some allergies such<br>as to the ingredients in aspirin and to nuts, 
  specifically peanuts is not<br>just some shrug it off allergy.&nbsp; Not 
  knowing what is in your food IS poison<br>to some people.&nbsp; And playing 
  gene splicing games that make plants more<br>receptive to pesiticides is 
  making a plant that will hold those pesticides<br>to rates far exceeding what 
  they now do.<br><br>This whole issue is based on $$$ and not on what is good 
  for anyone but some<br>fat cat&#39;s bank roll!&nbsp; And, that ain&#39;t crap 
  science, that is a fact!<br><br>Now, on to CA&#39;s energy crisis.&nbsp; Please 
  stick to the facts instead of what<br>the nice little news media and the right 
  wing Fox type channels are spewing.<br>Yes, most of CA&#39;s power crisis is 
  directly related to politics.&nbsp; Also, only<br>ONE power plants was stopped 
  in CA by the environmentalists.&nbsp; Personally, I<br>wish they had been able 
  to stop a few more.&nbsp; I&#39;ve never seen such stupidity<br>in all my life as 
  building nuclear power plants on active earthquake faults!<br><br>How about if 
  we put some of the blame where it belongs, right directly into<br>the lap of a 
  Republican govenor who had aspirations of running for president<br>and who got 
  taken by some folks that turned around and put their money in<br>the Dumbya 
  coffers for his run for president.&nbsp; Let&#39;s take the $100,000<br>clubers 
  and name some names.&nbsp; Let&#39;s look at fat cats such as Kenneth Lay,<br>CEO 
  of Enron Corp and Steve Ledbetter, CEO of Reliant Energy.&nbsp; These 
  two<br>bought up a large number of the power plants when they were put up for 
  sale<br>and have been systematically/deliberatly shutting down the plants to 
  drive<br>up the prices.&nbsp; Let&#39;s talk Hurowitz (Maxxam) who owned blocks of 
  power, who<br>decided to teach his Kaiser employees a lesson (don&#39;t you dare 
  go out on<br>strike at one of my plants) by laying them all off for 4 months 
  and then<br>selling his power block for a $32 MILLION profit.<br><br>Hey, 
  let&#39;s talk about good ol&#39; Cheney and the 40 to 50 natural gas wells<br>drilled 
  in and around this supposed home state that are capped and not 
  being<br>used.<br><br>And, there is plenty of power to be generated, the only 
  problem is there is<br>a big profit to be made on things such as wind farms, 
  so no one is rushing<br>out to build them.<br><br>And we could always talk 
  about folks such as Ultra-Power who did a cut off<br>your nose to spit your 
  face game when they shut down their power<br>plants--they shut down their 
  scrap burning plants because they wanted to<br>burn tires.&nbsp; Gee, I guess 
  that was very NIMBY of the local residents (NOT<br>environmentalists), I mean, 
  how short sited not to want your house, yard and<br>cars covered with black 
  soot and wanting to be able to breath without a<br>ventilator.<br><br>Now, as 
  to being local.&nbsp; Perhaps you could tell that to folks on the 
  east<br>coast that are paying $500 a month and more for heating this 
  winter.&nbsp; Or<br>perhaps you would care to tell the folks in SD, ND and the 
  Four Corners who<br>couldn&#39;t afford propane this winter and the folks who 
  froze to death.&nbsp; And<br>you can tell that to the folks in NY who are 
  being warned right now to<br>expect the same (rolling blackouts) this 
  summer.&nbsp; CA is just making the big<br>headlines.<br><br>Lynda<br>-----

  &lt;phoenix@...&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Who&#39;s &#39;we&#39;, and is 
  the water worse than it was in the 1970s?&nbsp; San<br>Francisco<br>&gt; and 
  Chicago have fine water.&nbsp; LA doesn&#39;t, but LA&#39;s lucky to have 
  any<br>water.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Worse than the 1960s and 1970s?&nbsp; I&#39;m sure 
  the pesticides aren&#39;t worse than<br>&gt; _Silent Spring_ days.&nbsp; And 
  there&#39;s all this organically grown food you can<br>buy<br>&gt; 
  now!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; As for gene modification... rant time.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; 
  The question of whether GMOs are safe is, in a sense, meaningless.&nbsp; 
  It<br>depends<br>&gt; on what the modification _is_.&nbsp; Obviously if you 
  put belladonna poison<br>genes<br>&gt; into a potato the potato isn&#39;t going to 
  be safe!&nbsp; Of course, the companies<br>&gt; don&#39;t do anything that 
  stupid.&nbsp; Is it possible that some other<br>modifications<br>&gt; might 
  have odd side effects, or limit food value, since we don&#39;t know<br>&gt; 
  everything about how nutrients are absorbed?&nbsp; Yes.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On the 
  other hand, the belief some people have that genetically 
  modified<br>food<br>&gt; is inherently bad is simply crap science.&nbsp; Our 
  &quot;natural&quot; food, animal and<br>&gt; vegetable, is quite removed from its wild 
  form, and cells don&#39;t care where<br>&gt; their genes come 
  from.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; And when we&#39;re contemplating the possible riskiness of 
  GM food, consider<br>the<br>&gt; other risks in life.&nbsp; Any obvious 
  poisons, and hopefully allergens, aren&#39;t<br>&gt; going to be put into the 
  food, so the most likely drawback is a bit of<br>extra<br>&gt; 
  carcinogenicity, on top of the carcinogens already in the food 
  naturally,<br>on<br>&gt; top of the pesticides, on top of the 
  for-most-Americans much bigger risks<br>of<br>&gt; eating too much saturated 
  fat and sugar, and not enough fruit and<br>vegetables,<br>&gt; and not getting 
  enough exercise.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Not that cancer is good.&nbsp; But I&#39;m saying 
  _if something goes wrong_ the<br>most<br>&gt; likely risk is a slightly 
  increased chance of cancer.&nbsp; This is something<br>you<br>&gt; worry about 
  after changing your diet and stopping smoking and starting<br>&gt; exercising, 
  because heart disease is a lot more likely to kill you than<br>&gt; 
  cancer.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Now, I admit that in the era of mad cow disease prions 
  there are other<br>things<br>&gt; to worry about, and sometimes I feel the 
  companies are a bit too sanguine<br>&gt; about our food supply.&nbsp; But I 
  don&#39;t like seeing unscientific fear of<br>genetic<br>&gt; engineering or 
  cloning, either.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; End rant.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; &gt; back, and 
  rolling power blackouts. Hmmm, we&#39;re not quite there yet, 
  but<br>give<br>&gt;<br>&gt; The rolling blackouts would be more relevant if 
  they were related to a<br>&gt; systematic shortage of power and 
  overconsumption of energy.&nbsp; In fact<br>&gt; California is 47th in power 
  usage, partly because of mild climate but also<br>&gt; because of aggressive 
  conservation measures -- starting from the 1970s.<br>And<br>&gt; the lack of 
  power is not from some global shortage but because we haven&#39;t<br>&gt; built 
  any plants in a decade.&nbsp; Because we&#39;re so democratic (as in 
  popular<br>&gt; input into everything) and environmentalist (trying to get 
  that clean air<br>and<br>&gt; water back, after the 1970s) that no one&#39;s been 
  able to build one.&nbsp; And<br>&gt; deregulation wasn&#39;t designed very well, 
  and there&#39;s evidence of power<br>&gt; suppliers trying to cut supply and raise 
  prices.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Yes, it&#39;s a big problem here, but seeing it as a sign 
  of oncoming doom is<br>&gt; unsupportable.&nbsp; This is a specifically 
  political local fuckup.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; -xx- Damien X-)<br><br><br></tt><br><br><tt>Message

<br>
<br>Although that&#39;s always possible, the likelihood&#39;s not high.
<br>
<br>The &quot;fact&quot; I&#39;m trying to impress on people here is that life cannot be lived 
<br>peacefully and happily if the world sucks, cats are destroying nature, all 
<br>water is poison (which is TOTALLY untrue), humans are a virus, or any of the 
<br>several other horror-tales which have been presented here in the past week. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I hope people aren&#39;t telling their sweet young children those things. &nbsp;If so, 
<br>the kids might be better off in school with SOME hope for balance.
<br>
<br>Now I don&#39;t believe that any family is always negative. &nbsp;I don&#39;t believe any 
<br>one human REALLY believes the world is a cesspool of pollution and sin and 
<br>malice. &nbsp;But there were glimpses of such naysaying and doomspeaking here on 
<br>this list, lately.
<br>
<br>People shouldn&#39;t say things which aren&#39;t backed up by facts, and there are 
<br>sources for far-edge, fright-facts. &nbsp;There are such sources for 
<br>environmentalists, and for nutritionists, and for educators, and home 
<br>educators, and the conservative right and the radical left. &nbsp;There are 
<br>sources for fundamentalist Christians to stay so riled up all day, every day, 
<br>about the devil in Pokemon and the evil in television that they could NEVER 
<br>take a calm, deep breath and look at the sky and be happy to have their 
<br>children with them.
<br>
<br>I could tell you all scare stories about teaching too, but I won&#39;t.
<br>We could invite someone in here (if there&#39;s not one already) who could tell 
<br>child protective services horror stories, or police-work horror stories. &nbsp;
<br>Let&#39;s Don&#39;t!!
<br>
<br>It&#39;s not sugarcoating the truth to turn your face toward the light instead of 
<br>toward the dark. &nbsp;There IS light, and there IS darkness. &nbsp;Now what? &nbsp;We 
<br>cannot destroy darkness.
<br>
<br>It&#39;s not sugarcoating the truth to introduce your children to other families 
<br>you would like for them to be like and maybe to marry into or learn from or 
<br>hang out with for life, instead of taking them to parole hearings or a bar to 
<br>find them some new friends who aren&#39;t working in the daytime anyway and have 
<br>some free time and REALLY know what the REAL truth about life is, without 
<br>&quot;sugarcoating.&quot;
<br>
<br>There are unquestionably ugly and horrible things happening right at this 
<br>moment, right in my town. &nbsp;When Holly wakes up and comes in here, she will 
<br>want me to smile at her and make that moment sweet and good. &nbsp;If she drinks 
<br>faucet water I won&#39;t scream and throw the glass down. &nbsp;If she plays in the 
<br>dirt I won&#39;t talk to her about bacteria or feces. &nbsp;If she picks up a bird&#39;s 
<br>nest from the ground, I won&#39;t slap it away and lecture her on bird lice. &nbsp;If 
<br>she rubs noses with the dog or cats I won&#39;t discuss unsanitary mucus horrors 
<br>with her. &nbsp;I will be pleasant and patient and that will make her life today 
<br>better than if I set my mind on ugliness and horror and treat her like a 
<br>character in Mad Max or Water World or Tank Girl or whatever end-of-world 
<br>panic some people on this list seem to be fantasizing about.
<br>
<br>If I were to have said nothing about the natural death of birds or wild cats 
<br>in Maryland, would this list have been more peaceful or the people on it 
<br>happier? &nbsp;&quot;Balance&quot; and &quot;truth&quot; are what I&#39;m saying, not &quot;don&#39;t care.&quot;

ludicrous to begin with, so it&#39;s a bit of a non-question to me.<br/>

if it just wasn&#39;t.  Rather, most of the stuff that was found to be harmful<br/>
after environmentalists screamed loudly about it has been banned after much<br/>
hard work. Of course, companies like Monsanto have come out with newer and<br/>
&quot;greater&quot; pesticides and herbicides that are now under investigation. It&#39;s<br/>
an endless circle. Hopefully though the growing awareness by people who want<br/>
food grown without adverse impact on the land will someday grow to such a<br/>
point as to put this problem to rest (taking off rosy glasses now :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is a California problem.  &lt;severe political incorrectness coming&gt;  I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>especially<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in this country where we have the highest standards anywhere in the<br/>

dangerously faulty that they were fearing another 3 Mile Island,<br/>
incidentally)....<br/>
Thanks but no thanks. As long as nuclear energy has the vast potential for<br/>
danger that it does, and as long as it is controlled by faulty humans and/or<br/>
computers, I&#39;ll vote for something safe and cheap like solar, wind, tide,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes.  Better yet, go to a foreign country like Italy.  Don&#39;t visit the<br/>

&gt; the US again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ummm, let&#39;s see. I&#39;ve been to Europe, Asia, Micronesia, Africa, & Central<br/>
America. And by being in different places in the world, I learned that<br/>
America isn&#39;t the be-all and end-all of existence as I was taught growing up<br/>
here. As a matter of fact, many other places do some things so *much* better<br/>
than America that it really opened my eyes. I&#39;ve seen great mass<br/>
transportation systems in Europe and Japan, I&#39;ve seen solar energy utilized<br/>
in Africa, I&#39;ve seen great appliances like on-demand hot water heaters that<br/>
are quite hard to even buy here in the &quot;great&quot; U.S. I&#39;ve also seen terrible<br/>
pollution and environmental devastation. I&#39;ve seen indigenous populations<br/>
that were just a few decades past being exposed to Western &quot;conveniences&quot;<br/>
and the disconnection that occurs when two culture collide. I&#39;ve seen many<br/>
things that made me appreciate America, and many things that opened my eyes<br/>
to our American faults and hubris. Living in other areas of the world is<br/>
going to be an important part of our unschooling journey with our children.<br/>
I want them to see first-hand the benefits and disadvantages of many<br/>
different ways of doing things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-502192500">No offense, but this answer is very head in the sandish.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;San Francisco and Chicago have fine water.&quot;  Define &quot;fine.&quot;  As someone who<br/>
has seen the water reports, I guess having only slightly more heavy metals<br/>
in your water than the end result of some 3 level processing sewer farms<br/>
could be considered &quot;fine.&quot;  I mean, all things being relative.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sure the pesiticides aren&#39;t worse than Silent Spring Days.&quot;  They are<br/>
simply different pesiticides and every bit as bad.  There is more arsenic in<br/>
the water, more farm crop run offs and all those pesticides that we<br/>
supposedly stopped using are still there.  DDT is a happy little camper that<br/>
is still at above acceptable levels many years after it has been banned.<br/>
Rules like &quot;don&#39;t use within 100 feet of a water source&quot; are a joke.  Since<br/>
when did runoff respect the 100 foot rule?<br/>
<br/>
Now for a real rant &lt;g&gt;  &quot;Of course, the companies don&#39;t do anything that<br/>
stupid.  Is it possible that some other modifications might have odd side<br/>
effects . . .&quot;  Sorry, of course the companies DO do things that stupid!<br/>
Can we spell c-i-g-e-r-e-t-t-e-s?  And I don&#39;t consider death to be an odd<br/>
side effect.  When you start splicing genes and you don&#39;t label the product<br/>
as containing those various genes, you risk (and it isn&#39;t a minor<br/>
possibility, it is a probability and has already happened) death as your end<br/>
result.  Not from cancer but from allergic reactions.  Some allergies such<br/>
as to the ingredients in aspirin and to nuts, specifically peanuts is not<br/>
just some shrug it off allergy.  Not knowing what is in your food IS poison<br/>
to some people.  And playing gene splicing games that make plants more<br/>
receptive to pesiticides is making a plant that will hold those pesticides<br/>
to rates far exceeding what they now do.<br/>
<br/>
This whole issue is based on $$$ and not on what is good for anyone but some<br/>
fat cat&#39;s bank roll!  And, that ain&#39;t crap science, that is a fact!<br/>
<br/>
Now, on to CA&#39;s energy crisis.  Please stick to the facts instead of what<br/>
the nice little news media and the right wing Fox type channels are spewing.<br/>
Yes, most of CA&#39;s power crisis is directly related to politics.  Also, only<br/>
ONE power plants was stopped in CA by the environmentalists.  Personally, I<br/>
wish they had been able to stop a few more.  I&#39;ve never seen such stupidity<br/>
in all my life as building nuclear power plants on active earthquake faults!<br/>
<br/>
How about if we put some of the blame where it belongs, right directly into<br/>
the lap of a Republican govenor who had aspirations of running for president<br/>
and who got taken by some folks that turned around and put their money in<br/>
the Dumbya coffers for his run for president.  Let&#39;s take the $100,000<br/>
clubers and name some names.  Let&#39;s look at fat cats such as Kenneth Lay,<br/>
CEO of Enron Corp and Steve Ledbetter, CEO of Reliant Energy.  These two<br/>
bought up a large number of the power plants when they were put up for sale<br/>
and have been systematically/deliberatly shutting down the plants to drive<br/>
up the prices.  Let&#39;s talk Hurowitz (Maxxam) who owned blocks of power, who<br/>
decided to teach his Kaiser employees a lesson (don&#39;t you dare go out on<br/>
strike at one of my plants) by laying them all off for 4 months and then<br/>
selling his power block for a $32 MILLION profit.<br/>
<br/>
Hey, let&#39;s talk about good ol&#39; Cheney and the 40 to 50 natural gas wells<br/>
drilled in and around this supposed home state that are capped and not being<br/>
used.<br/>
<br/>
And, there is plenty of power to be generated, the only problem is there is<br/>
a big profit to be made on things such as wind farms, so no one is rushing<br/>
out to build them.<br/>
<br/>
And we could always talk about folks such as Ultra-Power who did a cut off<br/>
your nose to spit your face game when they shut down their power<br/>
plants--they shut down their scrap burning plants because they wanted to<br/>
burn tires.  Gee, I guess that was very NIMBY of the local residents (NOT<br/>
environmentalists), I mean, how short sited not to want your house, yard and<br/>
cars covered with black soot and wanting to be able to breath without a<br/>
ventilator.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to being local.  Perhaps you could tell that to folks on the east<br/>
coast that are paying $500 a month and more for heating this winter.  Or<br/>
perhaps you would care to tell the folks in SD, ND and the Four Corners who<br/>
couldn&#39;t afford propane this winter and the folks who froze to death.  And<br/>
you can tell that to the folks in NY who are being warned right now to<br/>
expect the same (rolling blackouts) this summer.  CA is just making the big<br/>
headlines.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Who&#39;s &#39;we&#39;, and is the water worse than it was in the 1970s?  San<br/>
Francisco<br/>
&gt; and Chicago have fine water.  LA doesn&#39;t, but LA&#39;s lucky to have any<br/>
water.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Worse than the 1960s and 1970s?  I&#39;m sure the pesticides aren&#39;t worse than<br/>
&gt; _Silent Spring_ days.  And there&#39;s all this organically grown food you can<br/>
buy<br/>
&gt; now!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As for gene modification... rant time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The question of whether GMOs are safe is, in a sense, meaningless.  It<br/>
depends<br/>
&gt; on what the modification _is_.  Obviously if you put belladonna poison<br/>
genes<br/>
&gt; into a potato the potato isn&#39;t going to be safe!  Of course, the companies<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t do anything that stupid.  Is it possible that some other<br/>
modifications<br/>
&gt; might have odd side effects, or limit food value, since we don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; everything about how nutrients are absorbed?  Yes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the other hand, the belief some people have that genetically modified<br/>
food<br/>
&gt; is inherently bad is simply crap science.  Our &quot;natural&quot; food, animal and<br/>
&gt; vegetable, is quite removed from its wild form, and cells don&#39;t care where<br/>
&gt; their genes come from.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And when we&#39;re contemplating the possible riskiness of GM food, consider<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other risks in life.  Any obvious poisons, and hopefully allergens, aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; going to be put into the food, so the most likely drawback is a bit of<br/>
extra<br/>
&gt; carcinogenicity, on top of the carcinogens already in the food naturally,<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; top of the pesticides, on top of the for-most-Americans much bigger risks<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; eating too much saturated fat and sugar, and not enough fruit and<br/>
vegetables,<br/>
&gt; and not getting enough exercise.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not that cancer is good.  But I&#39;m saying _if something goes wrong_ the<br/>
most<br/>
&gt; likely risk is a slightly increased chance of cancer.  This is something<br/>
you<br/>
&gt; worry about after changing your diet and stopping smoking and starting<br/>
&gt; exercising, because heart disease is a lot more likely to kill you than<br/>
&gt; cancer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, I admit that in the era of mad cow disease prions there are other<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; to worry about, and sometimes I feel the companies are a bit too sanguine<br/>
&gt; about our food supply.  But I don&#39;t like seeing unscientific fear of<br/>
genetic<br/>
&gt; engineering or cloning, either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; End rant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; back, and rolling power blackouts. Hmmm, we&#39;re not quite there yet, but<br/>
give<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The rolling blackouts would be more relevant if they were related to a<br/>
&gt; systematic shortage of power and overconsumption of energy.  In fact<br/>
&gt; California is 47th in power usage, partly because of mild climate but also<br/>
&gt; because of aggressive conservation measures -- starting from the 1970s.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; the lack of power is not from some global shortage but because we haven&#39;t<br/>
&gt; built any plants in a decade.  Because we&#39;re so democratic (as in popular<br/>
&gt; input into everything) and environmentalist (trying to get that clean air<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; water back, after the 1970s) that no one&#39;s been able to build one.  And<br/>
&gt; deregulation wasn&#39;t designed very well, and there&#39;s evidence of power<br/>
&gt; suppliers trying to cut supply and raise prices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, it&#39;s a big problem here, but seeing it as a sign of oncoming doom is<br/>
&gt; unsupportable.  This is a specifically political local fuckup.<br/>

<br>
<br>I could spend the rest of my life reviewing the evils of the past, but I 
<br>prefer to look to the joy of the moment.

<br>LOL -- how silly is my life?? &nbsp;Just yesterday I was wondering with another 
<br>Mom why we hadn&#39;t heard that Pokemon are evil because they do &quot;evolve&quot; you 
<br>know. &nbsp;Just a day late in our rumor mill around here, I guess. :)

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704396536">First, let me be the first of many to stand up (here by my computer) and say <br/>
Sandra Dodd HAS made a huge difference in my family&#39;s life and thus our <br/>
world. <br/>
<br/>
This vegetarian, imprisoned cat, save the world conversation is way <br/>
interesting guys. I&#39;m learning so much hearing the different sides here.<br/>
<br/>
 Um, I guess what makes me uncomfortable is the judgmental tone I&#39;ve heard <br/>
throughout your conversation. (Directed at no one in particular, just several <br/>
posts.) How do you expect to attract those of us with our &quot;heads in the sand&quot; <br/>
to your consciousness-raising messages with the <br/>
look-at-how-I-live-my-life-if-only-everyone-could-do-the-same, <br/>
self-congratulatory tone that permeates your posts? And do you live your life <br/>
in this exemplary way in EVERY area? Aren&#39;t you spread kinda thin?<br/>
<br/>
I have a close friend who works for a peace awareness organization. She is <br/>
passionately involved in her family&#39;s work here and answers my questions <br/>
thoughtfully and honestly. She and her husband have spent time in prison for <br/>
living their beliefs. But she doesn&#39;t recruit people to live as they do. Or <br/>
to believe as they do. And she doesn&#39;t &quot;run down&quot; or criticize those who <br/>
haven&#39;t had their consciousness raised to the point where they are aware of <br/>
the issues that she and her family focus their energies on. Or those who have <br/>
chosen to focus their energies elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Her husband was jailed a few weeks ago at a protest they attended. We had a <br/>
conversation about our kids at that time, and she didn&#39;t say, &quot;Gee, where <br/>
were you? Maybe if you had attended this protest instead of taking the kids <br/>
to McDonald&#39;s, our voices would have been heard. Why can&#39;t you risk jail time <br/>
for what you believe in? If more people lived their convictions...yada yada <br/>
...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She is an inspiration to me in many ways, but her ability to let her life <br/>
speak for itself is her strongest witness to me. (You don&#39;t find her on her <br/>
butt in front of a computer chair typing this post, either. Hmmm.)<br/>

nuclear waste is building up and can&#39;t be disposed of?  Do you have any idea<br/>
of the number of leaking nuclear waste canisters there are in the ocean<br/>
right now?<br/>

attempt to improve what is here.  Sorry, there are quite a few things in<br/>
other countries that are much better than what we have here and that<br/>
includes the environment.  Not all countries nor all parts of all countries<br/>
are bad.  At least in Italy when they had the mud slides the government had<br/>
the brass you-know-whats to stand up and say, &quot;we made a mistake.&quot;  You sure<br/>

each of you and your family&#39;s successes and &quot;failures&quot; over the years in
your homeschooling adventure.&nbsp; I find this list to be very helpful
and inspiring because each of you are at different stages and places in

Thanks again to all who &quot;share their stories.&quot;&nbsp; You are an inspiration
to all.

hard to think of some of the stuff we and our kids have done as bad <br/>
things, although to other people they might seem that way. Everything <br/>
is a learning experience, and while I probably paint a pretty rosy <br/>
picture of our lives, it hasn&#39;t always been easy to keep the needed <br/>
perspective. We&#39;ve hit plenty of bumps in the road. And rocks. Big <br/>
ones. Washouts, even. But more often than not we&#39;ve simply adjusted <br/>
our sights and built our own roads where we wanted to go. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I have no problems sharing my family&#39;s successes and failures concerning <br/>
homeschooling.   <br/>
<br/>
What I didn&#39;t want to share here is teacher-stories, from when I taught <br/>
school.  Those can stay at school.  If we take our kids out of school but <br/>
bring all of school&#39;s &quot;stuff&quot; (including negativity) that&#39;s disadvantageous.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
People here have already taken their kids out of school.  Most of them have <br/>
already homeschooled by more school-like methods.  They&#39;re at the unschooling <br/>
stage, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good place to tell horror-anecdotes of <br/>
school and its effect on particular kids you don&#39;t even know.<br/>
