<div id="ygrps-yiv-767765509">Hi Amie, and welcome to the list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;ve tried the let&#39;s<br/>
&gt; each pick a show each day, tried to let them come up with solutions,<br/>
&gt; tried to explain why it isn&#39;t healthy, tried to always have something<br/>
&gt; exciting(this is hard to do), letting them watch as much as they want<br/>
&gt; to(thinking it wouldn&#39;t be so exciting). None of these worked.<br/>
&gt; I say the T.V. is fuzzy, which is true, but I still feel wrong about it.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t think of any other solutions. Anyone?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How long did you try letting them watch as much as they want to? And by<br/>
letting them watch as much as they want to, I mean without interrupting them<br/>
every 10 minutes with, &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you rather bake a cake with me? Go for a<br/>
walk? Do a puzzle? Go visit Grandma?&quot; :) Kids can tell when you&#39;re trying to<br/>
distract them from something, and like the rest of us contrary humans they<br/>
figure if we&#39;re that against it, it&#39;s gotta be good.<br/>
<br/>
You can run an experiment: let them watch as much as they want to for the<br/>
next year. Have on offer your normal life: day trips, general fun things,<br/>
but don&#39;t be rushing in there every time they sit down and try to get them<br/>
to do something else. Treat their television viewing with the same respect<br/>
you would show if they were reading a book or playing a game or singing a<br/>
song -- wait until they&#39;re done before you offer other things, or offer<br/>
other things only when they really DO come up naturally (&quot;I&#39;m starting<br/>
dinner, anybody want to help?&quot; or &quot;Okay, gang, let&#39;s find a good stopping<br/>
point after this program so we can excavate the living room.&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
heading out to the store when Dad gets home, anybody who wants to go with me<br/>
needs to have shoes on and hair brushed.&quot; Etc.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll wager real money that they will show you in that year (actually in a<br/>
lot less than a year, most likely in the first week or two) a variety of<br/>
viewing patterns, including watching TV nearly all day every day for days,<br/>
and not watching more than a few minutes a day for days (but leaving the<br/>
darn thing on, which I always turn off if no one is in the room &lt;g&gt;) and<br/>
watching one full program here or there, or watching if they&#39;re bored or<br/>
stressed, or any or all of the above and about 20 other patterns.<br/>
<br/>
TV is entertaining. This should come as no great shock to people -- it&#39;s why<br/>
it&#39;s so popular. The reason it&#39;s the major pastime of Americans isn&#39;t<br/>
because they mist heroine out the speakers at us, it&#39;s because it&#39;s fun to<br/>
watch. It&#39;s also information-intensive, educational, drivel, great, boring<br/>
and stupid, brilliant, inspiring, irritating, all of the above.<br/>
<br/>
Our family watches a LOT of TV, from &quot;the good stuff&quot; on the History and<br/>
Discovery Channels to such mindless drivel as my newest obsession, The<br/>
Amazing Race on CBS Wednesdays (though I learned several interesting things<br/>
about South Africa last week &lt;g&gt;). In spite of this (or, as this unschooler<br/>
would say, because of this), we can converse in complete sentences, enjoy<br/>
books and games and walks, and don&#39;t drool noticeably (well, maybe during<br/>
Sweeps &lt;eg&gt;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624820219">&lt;&lt; My son has had two opportunities to watch as much as he wants<br/>
for more than a year each time.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But with a sick mother, not with a full range of healthy unschooling options.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling moms need to provide a range of cool stuff to do, not just stay <br/>
in the house telling the kids to turn off the TV, hoping educational <br/>
opportunities are oozing up from the floor of his room without her helping <br/>
scout out any cool exposure to outside (and inside) stuff.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But there is a big difference between 3 and 9 and even more difference at <br/>
16.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  The older kids need even MORE freedom and respect.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;think a big part of being an unschooling parent has to be recognizing<br/>
when something is becoming a problem. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And part of joining a big unschooling list is the opportunity to get more <br/>
input on helping you recognize what the problem might be.  Villifying the TV <br/>
isn&#39;t right.  The TV isn&#39;t your problem.  The kids won&#39;t be watching TV if <br/>
they&#39;re not even in the house.  Get out and do something exhilarating.  Rent <br/>
videos you yourself would like to watch with them, if you can&#39;t get out.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Only you know your child well enough to recognize<br/>
the difference between a minor fixation and a truly problematic<br/>
addiction.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But others might see options other than just turning the TV into a control <br/>
issue between the parent and child, and there are LOTS of people on this list <br/>
who are successfully, happily and calmly unschooling.  If you don&#39;t want to <br/>
hear their ideas or you bat them away with insults every time they come, why <br/>
would you want to be on this list?<br/>
<br/>
And again, www.unschooling.com is the main site of which this list is a small <br/>
part.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99698427">Unfortunately some unschoolers become as locked into and are as rigid about<br/>
a<br/>
definition as the 3Rs folks are.  In doing so they forget that everyone is<br/>
an<br/>
individual.  Some folks are born &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;aware&quot; and others may have<br/>
addictive personalities and if they aren&#39;t born with the innate ability to<br/>
know themselves they become addicted to any number of things.  Most folks<br/>
jump to the obvious--alcohol and drugs--while forgetting that this type<br/>
personality can become addicted to any number of things and it has been<br/>
found that television is high on that list of things.<br/>
<br/>
A trully loving and caring parent, be they ps, hs or unschooling will forget<br/>
what the pigeon holes are all about and use some common sense to help guide<br/>
their *individual* child through the complicated maze we call life.<br/>

and his brother are very active addicts. They grew up with their mother who <br/>
was not an addict, but an extremely controlling codependent. I worry about my <br/>
son and his genes for addiction, but I know controlling isn&#39;t the way to <br/>
handle them.  In fact the first step in any recovery program is <br/>
surrender...i.e. giving up control, or the illusion of it.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you&#39;re &#39;helping him stop&#39;, you&#39;re stepping in and changing what he <br/>
is choosing to do. If he&#39;s willing, that&#39;s fine, but if not, I think it&#39;s <br/>
controlling. <br/>
<br/>
Those prone to addiction, I feel, need much more self awareness than external <br/>
control. I also have trouble stopping with tequila.<br/>

If you yourself aren&#39;t sure of the definition of &quot;controlling&quot; you might not <br/>
be the best person to help your child understand and see that you are not <br/>
controlling him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in discussions in which parents who spanked said spanking wasn&#39;t <br/>
hitting.<br/>
They told their children they weren&#39;t hitting them.  The children agreed with <br/>
them, because they didn&#39;t want to be not-hit, spanked any more.<br/>
<br/>
If you tell him to turn it off, that is control.<br/>
Call it a hawk, call it a handsaw, it is control.<br/>

<br/>
Because it doesn&#39;t work like unschooling does, and people who say &quot;I tried <br/>
unschooling but it didn&#39;t work&quot; discourage others from ACTUALLY unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to describe what we&#39;re doing to people and why it works so well <br/>
with others around saying &quot;It&#39;s okay to require math workbooks&quot; or &quot;Waiting <br/>
until a kid is eight to see if he&#39;ll learn to read on his own is fine, but <br/>
then I&#39;d teach him!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;Lamaze says...&quot; and then misquotes, or &quot;Maria Montessori <br/>
said...&quot; and then misquotes, it will give others the wrong ideas about Lamaze <br/>
and Montessori.  <br/>
<br/>
I liked Joyce&#39;s analogy lots:  <br/>
&lt;&lt; It might be playing around with unschooling but it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
unschooling, just as eating vegetarian except for occasional meat isn&#39;t<br/>
vegetarianism. That doesn&#39;t mean an almost vegetarian can&#39;t hang around<br/>
absorbing information from vegetarians. But offering vegetable recipes that<br/>
contain animal products will get jumped on.&gt;&gt;<br/>
