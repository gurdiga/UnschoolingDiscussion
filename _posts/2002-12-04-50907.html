<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564931165">Okay so I broke down from the homeopathic stuff and went to the good old <br/>
stand by medicines. I actually gave the children a choice of taking what I <br/>
had or taking their chances on the Dr. I hated doing that but I was sick of <br/>
sickness and they were too.<br/>
<br/>
Triaminic cough and cold mixed with a bit of pepsi did the trick. They were <br/>
able to get it down and keep it down and are all better after just one day <br/>
of taking the stuff. Sierra had her first quiet coughless night last night <br/>
which means I finally got some much needed sleep myself. I tried so hard <br/>
without going to the meds but it just didn&#39;t work for us.<br/>
<br/>
Thankful for health again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636715870">Hey Mary, you do what you gotta do to get some rest and to get better. . My <br/>
son recently injured his eye and he felt horrible and was very irritable.  I <br/>
gave him benedryl every 6 hours.  It was the only thing that calmed him down <br/>
so he wasnt so fretful over his eye.   Homeopathy can work wonders, Im sure.  <br/>
But sometimes the old tried and true OT meds are just easier and more <br/>
convenient.  <br/>
