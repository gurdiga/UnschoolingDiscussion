<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184924535">Just wanted to pass on the response I received from Kraft about <br/>
their advertising on the CBS Evening News.  Unfortunately they are <br/>
not supportive as the makers of Claratin were (so I, for one, will <br/>
use the power of my *purchasing dollars*!)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for contacting us directly to tell us of your reaction to <br/>
the CBS Evening News segment.  It gives us the chance to express to <br/>
you the thinking that guides our advertising decisions.   <br/>
<br/>
The issues involved are tough ones, full of controversy and <br/>
emotion.  We take your comments very seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Kraft is always concerned about the media environment in which our<br/>
advertising appears and we have rigorous policies governing the <br/>
placement of our ads.  We enforce ourpolicies to the best of <br/>
our ability.  From time to time, we are asked to use the power of our<br/>
advertising dollars to intervene in the editorial policies of the <br/>
media -- to influence newscoverage on this network or <br/>
drive a personality off the air at that station.  Each time, we <br/>
decline,explaining that viewers and listeners are the arbiters, not <br/>
advertisers.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this clarifies the situation.</div>
