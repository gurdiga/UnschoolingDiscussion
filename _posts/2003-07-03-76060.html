<div id="ygrps-yiv-951063624">This thread has been really interesting and here is my contribution from an<br/>
even older perspective . . .<br/>
<br/>
I STILL have people telling me that I need time away from my kids (19,16,<br/>
12) - even more now that I am a single mom. And, believe me, we are all<br/>
going in several directions often and do get worlds of time (often too<br/>
much) apart. So, when an invitation comes up for me that is on a night when<br/>
everyone is actually going to be home - no drama endeavors for Nell, no<br/>
movie plans for Sky, no sleepovers for Bay, etc - and  I say, no . . .<br/>
well, I often get the response that I am somehow being a martyr, or taking<br/>
on too much, or whatever. The simple fact that we all enjoy each other&#39;s<br/>
company and might truly relish an evening together in the hubbub that is<br/>
often our busy and involved lives seems to go over many people&#39;s heads.<br/>
But, when I reflect on just how I did not enjoy being with my parents when<br/>
I was a teen and how so many people do not relate to their teens . . . I<br/>
see that this is a sad comment on society, really. And, that I am truly<br/>
blessed that my teens like to be with me and with each other! I feel so<br/>
lucky! <br/>
<br/>
Life is too short, really, not to spend all the time we can with our<br/>
children. And, for the record, I did not leave them when they were younger<br/>
with anyone and did not attend any functions that did not include them. Oh,<br/>
that damn martyr again!<br/>
LOL!<br/>
<br/>
So, you with younger children - bravo! Perhaps you will inspire someone<br/>
else to think before going to yet another senseless adult party, when they<br/>
could have been home with their fast-growing children . . . and surely you,<br/>
too, will have teens who actually enjoy you and you them!<br/>
<br/>
Love, Lee<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-823581412">Hi, unlurking to reply and laugh with Lee about being the &quot;martyr.&quot; I get<br/>
the same response all  the time, too. It&#39;s been so wonderful to read in this<br/>
thread about how many other people DON&#39;T leave their kids! I feel less weird<br/>
now! :)<br/>
<br/>
Before we defected from corporate life and the city for the isolated,<br/>
happier life we now lead in the boonies, and actually had events to attend<br/>
(lol!), we&#39;d always bring our daughter with us. None of the invitations ever<br/>
SAID no kids, but it was obviously understood that none would be there. When<br/>
she was a baby, I sewed fancy slings to go over the evening gowns, and later<br/>
she just walked along with us. Of course at first people would stare like we<br/>
were crazy, but of course our daughter always became the life of the party,<br/>
and by the end of the evening people would always say what a pleasure it was<br/>
to watch her being her vivacious self.<br/>
<br/>
If an event DOES specifically say -no kids- we don&#39;t attend. We even missed<br/>
a big family wedding earlier this year due to this, and it caused a lot of<br/>
tension. But too bad - my kids are way more important!!<br/>
<br/>
