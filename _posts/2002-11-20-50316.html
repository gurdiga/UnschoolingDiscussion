&gt; yours.  But then how could you know that, not knowing all the things<br/>
&gt; I have listed above?  Where&#39;s the oath I missed that says I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; define the details of my own &quot;unschooling&quot; terms, that I have to<br/>
&gt; agree to a list of specific behavior that someone else decides is<br/>
&gt; right for my child?<br/>

Of course there are reasons that we all do the things we do.  That&#39;s<br/>
assumed, or we&#39;d get so much mail every day, nobody would read this list!  I<br/>
read your statement the same way that Sandra did; maybe this one needed more<br/>
fleshing out.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people here, me included, have learned a great deal from this list.<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s been annoying to learn some of those things.  But no one is<br/>
telling you that you MUST do your unschooling this way.  There are things<br/>
discussed here that I don&#39;t do.  Yet.  Maybe never.  Maybe next week.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I can compare this to becomming a vegetarian, which is on my mind<br/>
because I was just reading a veggie magazine.  Many people start their<br/>
journey by eating less meat and more vegetarian meals.  Eventually they<br/>
might go totally vegetarian, and later vegan.  Or not.  They might stop at<br/>
vegetarian, or they might benefit from just eating less meat and listening<br/>
in on the vegetarians politely.  I think many folks here are<br/>
vegan-unschoolers.  It&#39;s ok if you&#39;re still eating meat.  But you&#39;ll likely<br/>
hear suggestions that you take the plunge and stop eating it!<br/>
<br/>
But nobody&#39;s gonna show up to your house and thow out your &quot;meat&quot;, if that&#39;s<br/>
what you&#39;re worried about!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
