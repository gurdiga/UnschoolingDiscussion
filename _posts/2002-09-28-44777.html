how will the kids make friends?my two older children that went to school<br/>
made their friends from outside,not from school.some of their friends<br/>
went to their school,but that is not where they became friends.school is<br/>
not the environment to make friends.school is the place  you learn to<br/>
make enemies.         <br/>
<br/>
life isn&#39;t fair.they need to learn this.-they don&#39;t need to be direct<br/>
victims of unfairness to understand that life can be unfair.(in school<br/>
many times the perpetrators are the faculty.)and if that was the case<br/>
then we would need to give our kids street drugs to teach them that<br/>
drugs are not good for them,and have our teenage daughters get pregnant<br/>
so they&#39;ll &quot;learn&quot; how tough it is to be a teen parent.sounds stupid<br/>
doesn&#39;t it.besides the statement that life isn&#39;t fair is not true.it can<br/>
be unfair or feel like it&#39;s unfair,but,especiallly in the free<br/>
world,life is only unfair if we let it be.we have alot more choices and<br/>
control over our circumstances than we realize if we look &quot;outside the<br/>
box&quot;.                                           and as far as dealing<br/>
with life i believe that if an unschooled child learns anything it is<br/>
that they do have control over their life.and who can deal with<br/>
something better than the one that has control over it?<br/>
