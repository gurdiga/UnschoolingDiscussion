<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043282226">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
A friend of mine has a biological child that was successful in making their  <br/>
family a mess with all of his behavior.  My friend tried everything she  could <br/>
think of, and after a few years of struggle, when she saw the cost to her  <br/>
marriage and the peace of the rest of the family, she asked her oldest son to  <br/>
leave their home.  He was 18 at the time.<br/>
 <br/>
We gathered, as her friends to support her in this difficult  decision.  We <br/>
made her a necklace placing beads on it that were strung on  with words of <br/>
support and love.  We made an identical one for the  son.<br/>
 <br/>
The son moved out, stayed here and there with friends, went to live in WA  <br/>
state with his grandparents for a while, got a job, eventually got a truck, an  <br/>
apt, and a girlfriend.  Now it is about 8 years later.  He moved back  here - <br/>
transfering with his job (a grocery store).  He is living at  home.<br/>
 <br/>
He is now a delightful person to live with, stating that he missed so much  <br/>
in his early years that he wants to have family time now.  He spends lots  of <br/>
time with his younger brother.<br/>
 <br/>
I just wanted to point out that sometimes the difficult decisions need peer  <br/>
support, and that eventually the young person will understand your  motivation.<br/>
 <br/>
I know that each person/family is different.  But I do know that  having one <br/>
person in the family that won&#39;t be co-operative and helpful needs to  be <br/>
addressed.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never had experiences that you are stating, because once my kids turn  <br/>
18 they receive their lump sum money from their dad and me, and then they are  <br/>
responsible for what happens in their lives.  I have tried to help prepare  <br/>
them for this for their whole life.  But I do know that they all work into  the <br/>
idea that they want to be &quot;adult&quot; as far as the privileges, but aren&#39;t as  <br/>
willing to realize the responsibilities that go along with that.  I feel it  is <br/>
my duty as a parent to help them learn that ----- <br/>
 <br/>
It is tough, but family life needs to be as safe and peaceful as  possible.  <br/>
This young woman does not seem to be happy living as she is, and  she would <br/>
probably welcome some drastic changes too, although she may complain  about it.<br/>
 <br/>
My thoughts,<br/>

YIKES!<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron turns 18 next month. Although I feel he is certainly capable of handling himself if something were to happen to me and Ben, I could never throw him to the wolves like that. <br/>
 <br/>
I know some people are ready and capable of leaving home at 13 or 16 or whatever, but some need more time--as Karen said, to &quot;brown a bit more&quot;---and be ideally ready to move on. <br/>
 <br/>
An arbitrary date like his eighteenth birthday? No way!<br/>
 <br/>
I think each child is different and should be allowed to move out when ready.<br/>
Eighteen? As a matter of course? Huh uh!<br/>

I had a &quot;yikes!&quot; reaction to the cash-and-out at 18 story too.<br/>
<br/>
A year or so ago I observed my kids for a few hours (something was  <br/>
going on in which they were all taking responsibility and making  <br/>
things happen, but I don&#39;t recall now what it was) and thought that  <br/>
they all, right now, could be partners and parents and take care of  <br/>
themselves if something happened to me and Keith.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times after I was grown, in my early 20&#39;s, I asked my mom  <br/>
to help me do something and she said something to the idea that if  <br/>
she wasn&#39;t here I would have to do it myself, so I needed to do it  <br/>
myself.   Yeah, but she WAS there.<br/>
<br/>
If Keith wasn&#39;t here I would always just get a chair and climb up to  <br/>
get things from high shelves, but when Keith is here, or Kirby, or  <br/>
Marty, I ask them to do it.  If I weren&#39;t here, they would do the  <br/>
laundry, but I AM here.  If Keith died, I&#39;d get my own firewood, but  <br/>
Keith is alive and likes to get firewood for me.<br/>
<br/>
We have some friends who charge their children rent when they turn  <br/>
18.  That&#39;s a mite dishonest; their house payments are no larger than  <br/>
they were the month before.  It&#39;s a way to force the kids to get  <br/>
jobs.  On the other hand, at our house, the kids have had jobs before  <br/>
they&#39;re 18 (Kirby at 14, Marty at 15), and we let them keep that money.<br/>
<br/>
Someone near me has one more daughter at home.  She&#39;s 17.  We know  <br/>
them from La Leche League, and live a few blocks away.  There&#39;s an  <br/>
older daughter off in college.  The parents divorced, but stayed  <br/>
three blocks apart so the kids could go back and forth by half weeks  <br/>
and have both parents near and available.  Pretty civilized of them.   <br/>
The mom said last month, though, that when #2 turns 18, she won&#39;t be  <br/>
getting the child support anymore so the daughter will have to take  <br/>
care of herself.    Three bedroom house, one person living there,  <br/>
payments won&#39;t increase, all these years she hasn&#39;t had to support  <br/>
the daughter financially, and the first month she might need to or  <br/>
want to, she&#39;s declared in advance she won&#39;t!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not love.<br/>
<br/>
If five isn&#39;t the age school must start and six isn&#39;t the age  <br/>
children must read then how does 18 become the age children must leave?<br/>
<br/>
Accepting gradual and natural maturity in the weaning and potty-use  <br/>
phase, and in the reading and spelling phase, and in the making  <br/>
choices phases all along prepared me to think kids should leave home  <br/>
when leaving home seems the right thing to do, and couldn&#39;t have been  <br/>
marked on the calendar in advance.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s about MY kids, not my sister&#39;s kids.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids who are 21 and 24 could come home if they needed. They could <br/>
call for money if they needed. They could count on us to help as much <br/>
as we were able. We could do the same of them. Yesterday I had to <br/>
borrow money from my brother, otherwise I would have overdrafted my <br/>
checking.I am 41 and I still need help. That is what my family is for. <br/>
My 24 year old has come home several times. He has regrouped and gone <br/>
out when he was ready and off to a new adventure. He is currently in <br/>
school to be an RN. He is a hubby and a dad. I was incredably proud <br/>
that he and his wife and an awesome Christmas as a family. Those two <br/>
oldest boys and their wives are sharing a really nice house in CA. <br/>
They are learning about community living. My second son has not come <br/>
home since he left at 18, but he always knew he could if he wanted or <br/>
needed.<br/>
I had a friend who&#39;s daughter was struggling with an addiction. The <br/>
mom said she is 18 she can get her own help. I do not believe in <br/>
enabling, but assisting.. It is what I want from the people I love, to <br/>
know I can count on them when I am not at my best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451519962">Nanci, I wanted to underline the thought that it sounds like Nicole is<br/>
screaming for you to put your boundaries up. At the moment she is<br/>
floundering. She is thinking of herself only and when that happens, the<br/>
others around need to articulate their needs. Hearing a strong woman say the<br/>
way she needs it to be in her home, pleasantly and absolutely, will give<br/>
Nicole the information and structure she needs to make decisions. You can be<br/>
completely understanding of Nicole and who she is during this time without<br/>
losing your family&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
I also agree that giving her things without expectations from her (like<br/>
building her a space) seems to encourage her (selfish?) behavior. What would<br/>
happen if you happily said to her, &quot;We need money to make this space for you<br/>
and we don&#39;t have enough. It really doesn&#39;t work to have you living in the<br/>
family room. If this living situation is going to work, you&#39;ll need to help.<br/>
Otherwise, you&#39;ll need to figure out another living situation.&quot;  ? Would she<br/>
cooperate, have a spirit of community?<br/>

Sandra and Kelly were aghast at this quoted above.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think she said they should leave home.  She said they&#39;re  <br/>
responsible.  I&#39;d like to know if she kicks them out or makes them pay rent  for staying <br/>
or what, though.<br/>
