Motivation<br/>
<br/>
This took place in the 1920s, when very few Westerners had ever been to<br/>
Bali. Margaret Mead was talking to some Balinese, trying to learn about this<br/>
strange and very different culture. At some point she asked about their<br/>
art. The Balinese were puzzled by this question. They did not know what she<br/>
meant by art. So she talked for a while about art and artists in Western<br/>
cultures. The Balinese considered this for a while. Then one of them spoke.<br/>
&quot;Here in Bali we have no art,&quot; he said. &quot;We do everything as well as we can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very little children are like the Balinese. Just about everything they do,<br/>
they do as well as they can. Except when tired or hungry, or in the grip of<br/>
passion, pain, or fear, they are moved to act almost entirely by curiosity,<br/>
desire for mastery and competence, and pride in work well done. But the<br/>
schools, and many adults outside of school, hardly ever recognize or honor<br/>
such motives, can hardly even imagine that they exist. In their place they<br/>
put Greed and Fear.<br/>
<br/>
But what about people who have taken out school children who have been<br/>
numbed and crippled in spirit by years of &quot;reinforcement,&quot; petty rewards<br/>
and penalties, gold stars, M & M&#39;s, grades, Dean&#39;s Lists?  How can<br/>
unschoolers revive in their children those earlier, deeper, richer sources<br/>
of human action? It is not easy.  Perhaps the only thing to do is to be<br/>
patient and wait.  After all, if we do not constantly re-injure our bodies, in<br/>
time they usually heal themselves.  We must act on faith that the same is<br/>
true of the human spirit.  In short, if we give children enough time, as free<br/>
as possible from destructive outside pressures, the chances are good that<br/>
they will once again find within themselves* their reasons for doing<br/>
worthwhile things.  And so, in time, may we all.<br/>

Rules/No Rules<br/>
<br/>
What do you do instead of ________________ (fill in the blank)?<br/>
<br/>
The answers to these questions so often don&#39;t seem to be heard or are<br/>
sort of overlooked. I think that&#39;s because they don&#39;t entirely sound like<br/>
&quot;answers&quot; to people who are looking for another concrete rule to replace<br/>
the one they&#39;re giving up. What we really give them are very general<br/>
principles and examples of how those play out in our own specific and<br/>
idiosyncratic lives - but that&#39;s hard to &quot;get&quot; when you&#39;re looking for a rule.<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t have a rule that says &quot;bedtime is at 9 pm,&quot; then what bedtime <br/>
rule DO we have? Lost of times people think that the new rule is then ONLY, <br/>
&quot;bedtime is whenever it happens.&quot; They think that means the parents stop <br/>
thinking about the child&#39;s sleep needs. But, in all the families that I know <br/>
who have no rule about bedtimes, the parents are consciously and actively <br/>
helping their kids get a good sense of taking care of their sleep needs. The <br/>
rule doesn&#39;t just flip-flop from bedtime to &quot;no bedtime&quot;  -- there is a whole <br/>
huge different way of handling and learning about sleep needs that replaces <br/>
the entire concept of a &quot;bedtime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To change the subject but make the same point...<br/>
<br/>
 People at park day were having a conversation about video games and<br/>
some of us were talking about not setting limits on them. As usual,<br/>
someone assumed that that meant that our kids would be spending 24<br/>
hours a day, day after day, only on that with no other interests developing,<br/>
etc. So we were talking about that - about all the OTHER stuff that we do<br/>
and how they learn, etc. (You&#39;ve heard it all before, here, so I&#39;m not<br/>
repeating all that -- but it was a lot of discussion there at the park.)<br/>
<br/>
Then - there was this startling moment when one person said, &quot;But it is so <br/>
expensive to buy video games -- how can you let them have unlimited video <br/>
games without going broke? We could never afford that.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Silence.<br/>
<br/>
Wow. Talk about flip-flopping. She took us arguing against rules like &quot;You <br/>
may have exactly one hour per day of video game time,&quot; or &quot;You may <br/>
spend the afternoon playing absolutely anything you want as long as it <br/>
doesn&#39;t involve TV or videogames&quot; as saying that we&#39;d buy our kids an <br/>
unlimited stock of whatever videogames they wanted?<br/>
<br/>
Well - some of the kids happened to BE there right then and heard that bit <br/>
and THEY reacted immediately with, &quot;We usually have to buy our OWN<br/>
games.&quot; She was somewhat bewildered, I think. In fact, I think it was news<br/>
to her that we didn&#39;t control the videogame time of our kids with arbitrary<br/>
rules. <br/>
<br/>
The thing that amused me  was that she&#39;d heard &quot;unlimited videogames&quot; as <br/>
meaning that we would BUY them whatever they wanted whenever they<br/>
wanted them.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about a failure to communicate!!! When we say what we do NOT do (we <br/>
don&#39;t have bedtimes, for example) we sometimes can&#39;t even imagine what<br/>
people might be thinking we do do &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
The Squirrels and the Elephants<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Relating control issues to &#39;squirrels and elephants&quot; is helpful in deciding<br/>
what&#39;s worth making an issue about with a child -- what is safe autonomy<br/>
and what is dangerous -- and what behaviors are really necessary to <br/>
control. The parents have a big gun, but they only have a limited amount<br/>
of ammunition. They&#39;ve got to save that ammunition for the elephants, <br/>
and not shoot the squirrels. So if a child tries to run across the street<br/>
or put his or her finger into the light socket, that&#39;s something that <br/>
warrants shooting off the gun. Those are dangerous, elephant-size issues.<br/>
They involve serious, potentially life-threatening consequences, and they<br/>
warrant a loud, fast, clear, and very firm reaction -- a very large bang.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, if you start using your elephant ammunition on every<br/>
squirrel that runs around your house -- every mess the child makes, every<br/>
food the child eats -- you&#39;re going to run out of ammunition when you <br/>
really need it for life-and-death areas.<br/>
<br/>
Practice letting the squirrels go by letting food issues go. In the context <br/>
of the child&#39;s need for experimentation and independence, eating sugared<br/>
cereal or an extra cookie at age two, or five, or ten is simply not a <br/>
dangerous behavior -- certainly not the equivalent of stepping out into<br/>
traffic or drinking household poisons.&quot;<br/>

Send Your Kids to Mars<br/>
<br/>
4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - Ignition - Liftoff !<br/>
In 2003, twin Mars Rovers will be launched towards the Red Planet. Once on <br/>
the surface, the Rovers will be able to travel significant distances and use <br/>
several instruments to help scientists determine the climate and water <br/>
history in Mars&#39; present and past. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Everyone on Earth who has ever dreamed of being an explorer on an alien <br/>
planet will want to go along for the ride as we explore the surface of Mars&quot; <br/>
invites Dr. Ed Weiler, Associate Administrator for the Office of Space <br/>
Science. So please join us on this exciting journey of learning and<br/>
exploration by including your name on the Mars Name Disc! <br/>
<br/>
You can send your name to Mars by filling out the form online at: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://spacekids.hq.nasa.gov/2003/details.htm">http://spacekids.hq.nasa.gov/2003/details.htm</a> <br/>
Once you have done this you will receive a &quot;Success&quot; page where you will <br/>
be able to print a commemorative certificate and bookmark it for later <br/>
viewing. All the names collected will be recorded onto a small DVD disk <br/>
that will be attached to the lander that will travel to the surface of Mars. <br/>
The DVD disk and its mounting assembly are being provided as part of the <br/>
Red Rover Goes to Mars educational experiment on the Mars Exploration <br/>
Rover-2003 mission. Each rover will photograph and return to Earth a <br/>
picture of each DVD disk of names as they rest on the Martian surface. <br/>

National Toy Design Challenge <br/>
<br/>
The Sally Ride Science Club and Smith College have announced the launch <br/>
of TOYchallenge, a national toy design competition that through fun, play,<br/>
and imagination, will encourage girls&#39; and boys&#39; interest in engineering and <br/>
inspire them to pursue careers in this area. The winners of the contest, <br/>
which is sponsored by Hasbro, Inc. will be announced at a National <br/>
Showcase in June, 2003.<br/>
<br/>
TOYchallenge is based on the first-year engineering design course at Smith<br/>
College and will challenge teams of middle school-age kids from across the<br/>
country to design their own toys.<br/>
<br/>
TOYchallenge guidelines and application forms are available at <br/>

NHEN Unveils New Message Boards<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nhen.org/forum">http://nhen.org/forum</a><br/>
<br/>
The National Home Education Network (NHEN) is incredibly excited to<br/>
announce the creation of new online message boards. These boards, <br/>
devoted entirely to legislative topics, will allow participants to discuss a<br/>
wide variety of issues. Recent conversations include an in-depth look at <br/>
standardized testing in which one participant writes: I think it&#39;s ludicrous<br/>
beyond belief for state laws to require homeschooled students to score at<br/>
or above a certain percentile on a standardized group achievement test<br/>
that is norm-referenced In response, participants offer research and<br/>
analysis, answer questions, and engage in spirited conversation. This is just<br/>
one of many conversations taking place.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions range from lists of books on education, to educational <br/>
reform, to homeschooling regulation, and beyond. Six distinct forum <br/>
areas contain numerous folders for discussion of wide-ranging issues. <br/>
These boards are easy to search and are conveniently segmented to <br/>
allow on-topic, in-depth discussion.<br/>
<br/>
You may be wary about utilizing message boards. You may believe, based<br/>
on other experiences, that they will be unwieldy or difficult to use. Not <br/>
true at all! These boards are loaded with features that make navigation<br/>
a breeze. For instance, you can sign up to get new messages sent to <br/>
your e-mail address. You can edit or delete your posts. You can add a<br/>
hyperlink to your posts, track all activity since your last visit, and search<br/>
posts for specific topics. There is even a FAQ to help you learn about all<br/>
the features: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nhen.org/forum/faq.asp#format">http://nhen.org/forum/faq.asp#format</a><br/>
<br/>
What, you might be thinking, happened to the Legislative List that was so<br/>
active? Most of its activity has been transferred to the message boards,<br/>
but the Legislative List remains, albeit in a somewhat altered format. The<br/>
Legislative List has been transformed into an announcement type list<br/>
where brief announcements or requests for information can be posted. <br/>
During this time of transformation all posts will pass through our capable <br/>
moderator, Kay Brooks, as she helps members discover what is appropriate<br/>
for that list and what is more appropriate for the new message boards.<br/>

Learning Language<br/>
<br/>
You have to look at the world through the eyes of children to find out how<br/>
much children learn. If you look from the point of view of an experienced<br/>
adult you will pay too much attention to those things that children do not<br/>
yet know, rather than giving them credit for the intellectual feats they<br/>
have already achieved. Take the elementary matter of working out that <br/>
written language says things.<br/>
<br/>
How do children get the idea that written language is worth paying attention<br/>
to in the first place? How do they learn that there is a difference between<br/>
print and the pattern on the wallpaper? Before children can learn anything<br/>
specific about reading and writing, they have to work out that writing does<br/>
things that decoration does not. Most three-year-old children can show<br/>
where it tell you that the contents of the package is corn flakes. They<br/>
point to the &quot;words,&quot; not to the decoration. They may claim the words say,<br/>
&quot;Corn Flakes,&quot; when the word they are pointing to reads, &quot;Cereal,&quot; and what<br/>
they are showing is that they have learned the distinction between the<br/>
print and the decoration...<br/>
<br/>
...Parents can see the development of insight into written language by just<br/>
watching the changing way children use markers and paper. The first marks<br/>
are likely to be balls of spaghetti, tangled scribbles and stab marks, whether<br/>
they represent writing or pictures. But while the &quot;drawings&quot; tend to organize<br/>
themselves into strokes and loops in the middle of the page, &quot;writing&quot;<br/>
becomes unraveled into individual lines, horizontal or vertical depending on<br/>
the conventions of the community in which the child lives. Soon the lines get<br/>
breaks in them, as children discover the existence of words, and in due<br/>
course the individual words are broken up into &quot;letters,&quot; even though the<br/>
child may have to invent many of them. The young author may even ask you<br/>
to read the story that has been written in these lines and squiggles. Meaning <br/>
comes first -- the process of understanding written language starts with<br/>
understanding entire stories or statements and then goes on to understand-<br/>
ing sentences, words, and finally letters, the reverse of the way most<br/>
children are expected to learn to &quot;read&#39; in school.<br/>

Final Thought<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The most important question any thinking creature can ask itself<br/>
is, &quot;What is worth thinking about?&quot; When we deny it&#39;s right to decide<br/>
that for itself, when we try to control what it must attend to and<br/>
think about, we make it less observant, resourceful, and adaptive,<br/>
in a word, less intelligent, in a blunter word, more stupid.&quot;<br/>
