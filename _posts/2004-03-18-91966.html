<br/>
I always do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m wondering now if it was wise, as I wait for the fall out. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wise&quot; in making your daily life better?<br/>
Or &quot;wise&quot; in that you will probably cause a family to rethink their position <br/>
on spanking?<br/>
And maybe cause MANY families to do so.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not an unschooling list, don&#39;t send this very link, but if you go in <br/>
here you can find a link or two you COULD send them.<br/>
<br/>
Every time a spanking debate has started on an unschooling list it gets ugly, <br/>
and usually the target mom (the one who defended spanking) doesn&#39;t change her <br/>
mind, but others on the side do.  At least one each time has said so.  And <br/>
probably there are more who didn&#39;t say so.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe it will be uncomfortable for you to speak up, and maybe they&#39;ll even <br/>
throw you off the list.   How uncomfortable?  As uncomfortable as a spanking? <br/>
 As uncomfortable as the guilt of not having said something that might have <br/>
made a difference?<br/>

Wouldn&#39;t make much sense to have a list or group where you couldn&#39;t <br/>
or shouldn&#39;t voice your opinion.  <br/>

<br/>
Well.....I cetainly have never had a problem voicing my opinion, <br/>
even if it isn&#39;t the &quot;norm&quot; or if I know others will not agree with <br/>
me.  My family and friends know not to ask my opinion uless they <br/>
really want an honest answer.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve voiced an opposing opinion on some other groups that I belong <br/>
to and knew that the &quot;fall out&quot; would be interesting to hear, if <br/>
nothing else.  Usually, when I voice this opposing opinion, I know <br/>
that others are not going to agree with me (and that&#39;s ok, not <br/>
everyone will always agree with me) but, I want them to know that <br/>
there are other ways of looking at different situtations.  Since I <br/>
usually know this in advance, I don&#39;t take what they say <br/>
personally.  Also, since most people are &quot;grown ups&quot; there is <br/>
usually a grown up discussion and not &quot;yelling&quot; and name calling, <br/>
which makes it easier to see other points of view.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846967484">&lt;&lt;&lt; Curious how you all handle things like that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Back when I was a therapist working at a children&#39;s locked psychiatric<br/>
facility, a young family admitted their 5yo child who was mentally retarded.<br/>
She threw fits, bit people, didn&#39;t sleep much, etc.....but I kept wondering<br/>
why in the world this family admitted her.  She was 5 for gosh sakes.  I had<br/>
children of my own and couldn&#39;t imagine not being able to handle a 5yo.<br/>
<br/>
Then David came to live with us when we were foster parents.  David was 3<br/>
and actively psychotic.  He threw fits almost non-stop, kept forgetting<br/>
about the dog and screaming his head off every time he saw it, would attack<br/>
other children for no apparent reason, didn&#39;t sleep at all that I could<br/>
tell.  After 6 days, I asked for him to be moved because I couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
that kid.  A mother of 2 who had been trained for 6 years in child<br/>
psychology and had 10 years experience as a therapist couldn&#39;t handle a 3 yo<br/>
boy.<br/>
<br/>
That was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other parents...at<br/>
least the ones I didn&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t know the story.<br/>
<br/>
Do I think spanking is a good and effective parenting response?  No.  Do I<br/>
think time-out is?  No.  Do I think every child is capable of the empathy<br/>
required to make discussions of how our behavior effects others effective?<br/>
No.  Do I think there are parents that spank their kids at the drop of a<br/>
hat?  Yes.  Do I think there are parents that have tried talking, tried<br/>
removing from the situation, tried distracting and then finally spanked<br/>
because they didn&#39;t know what else to do?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
Have I spanked my kids?  Yes.  Is it something I would recommend to others?<br/>
No.<br/>

I was just trying to point out there is another way. If the only way to get a child to behave is by spanking, there is a much deeper problem as was the case in your situtation. Gosh I would hope that a child with a psychiatric illness wouldn&#39;t be hit as a solution.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1209566711">Thank you for saying that.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I strive to do better, there are times when I reach a point and don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in spanking, but my kids are familiar enough with it to know what it means.  So on a rare occasion it happens.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not proud of it, and I always try to go back and see what I could do differently to avoid it in the future. <br/>
<br/>
But it happens.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a son who was quite the challenge when he was little.  Although I know so much more now than I did then, I *do* understand how people get themselves into situations that involve less than ideal parenting.  So I try not to judge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818292095">&quot;So I try not to judge.&quot; I think there is a difference between judging and between trying to point out other solutions. Do you try not to judge anyone on anything? Or is it just because you have found yourself doing it that you try not to judge?<br/>

Do you judge school teachers that lose it? Do you judge parents out in public that scream and yell or lose it? Do you judge working moms, stay at home moms, attachement moms, non-attachment moms?  I think we all have beliefs and there is a big difference between judging and sharing our beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
If nobody ever shared that there is an alternative to spanking, many moms might never know it.<br/>

<br/>
  Thank you for saying that.<br/>
<br/>
  As much as I strive to do better, there are times when I reach a point and don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t believe in spanking, but my kids are familiar enough with it to know what it means.  So on a rare occasion it happens.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not proud of it, and I always try to go back and see what I could do differently to avoid it in the future. <br/>
<br/>
  But it happens.<br/>
<br/>
  I also have a son who was quite the challenge when he was little.  Although I know so much more now than I did then, I *do* understand how people get themselves into situations that involve less than ideal parenting.  So I try not to judge.<br/>

That is terribly sad. I&#39;m just not sure I understand the comparison of an obvious mentally ill child to that of a normal healthy child being spanked or hit for making mistakes or sometimes just for doing something the parent didn&#39;t happen to like at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
Should we just close our eyes to possible abuse, so as not to sit in judgement of others?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147036211">&lt;&lt;&lt;I think there is a difference between judging and between trying to point<br/>
out other solutions.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely agree.  I do try not to judge.  Just as I try to give the child<br/>
that is screaming and having a meltdown in the store the benefit of the<br/>
doubt (no nap, hungry, didn&#39;t want to be shopping, etc.), I try to give the<br/>
mom who is having a meltdown the benefit of the doubt too (overtired, didn&#39;t<br/>
have time for lunch, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that I don&#39;t try to help if it seems appropriate<br/>
(entertain the child in the check-out line, offer to hold the baby while the<br/>
mom helps the toddler, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
It means that I don&#39;t automatically assume that the person having the<br/>
meltdown is lacking in some way.  Every single person has had a meltdown at<br/>
one time or another, not been as kind as they wish they had,whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Spanking and yelling are not kind things to do but I don&#39;t understand why<br/>
they have been demonized so much more so than the emotional damage that is<br/>
inflicted by time-out, ignoring, etc..  None of that is good and effective<br/>
parenting.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &quot;So I try not to judge.&quot; I think there is a difference between judging and<br/>
between trying to point out other solutions. Do you try not to judge anyone<br/>
on anything? Or is it just because you have found yourself doing it that you<br/>
try not to judge?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you judge school teachers that lose it? Do you judge parents out in<br/>
public that scream and yell or lose it? Do you judge working moms, stay at<br/>
home moms, attachement moms, non-attachment moms?  I think we all have<br/>
beliefs and there is a big difference between judging and sharing our<br/>
beliefs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If nobody ever shared that there is an alternative to spanking, many moms<br/>
might never know it.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Thank you for saying that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   As much as I strive to do better, there are times when I reach a point<br/>
and don&#39;t know what else to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I don&#39;t believe in spanking, but my kids are familiar enough with it to<br/>
know what it means.  So on a rare occasion it happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I&#39;m not proud of it, and I always try to go back and see what I could do<br/>
differently to avoid it in the future.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   But it happens.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I also have a son who was quite the challenge when he was little.<br/>
Although I know so much more now than I did then, I *do* understand how<br/>
people get themselves into situations that involve less than ideal<br/>
parenting.  So I try not to judge.<br/>

&gt;     &lt;&lt;&lt; Curious how you all handle things like that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Back when I was a therapist working at a children&#39;s locked psychiatric<br/>
&gt;     facility, a young family admitted their 5yo child who was mentally<br/>
retarded.<br/>
&gt;     She threw fits, bit people, didn&#39;t sleep much, etc.....but I kept<br/>
wondering<br/>
&gt;     why in the world this family admitted her.  She was 5 for gosh sakes.<br/>
I had<br/>
&gt;     children of my own and couldn&#39;t imagine not being able to handle a<br/>
5yo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Then David came to live with us when we were foster parents.  David<br/>
was 3<br/>
&gt;     and actively psychotic.  He threw fits almost non-stop, kept<br/>
forgetting<br/>
&gt;     about the dog and screaming his head off every time he saw it, would<br/>
attack<br/>
&gt;     other children for no apparent reason, didn&#39;t sleep at all that I<br/>
could<br/>
&gt;     tell.  After 6 days, I asked for him to be moved because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
handle<br/>
&gt;     that kid.  A mother of 2 who had been trained for 6 years in child<br/>
&gt;     psychology and had 10 years experience as a therapist couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
a 3 yo<br/>
&gt;     boy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     That was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other<br/>
parents...at<br/>
&gt;     least the ones I didn&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t know the story.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Do I think spanking is a good and effective parenting response?  No.<br/>
Do I<br/>
&gt;     think time-out is?  No.  Do I think every child is capable of the<br/>
empathy<br/>
&gt;     required to make discussions of how our behavior effects others<br/>
effective?<br/>
&gt;     No.  Do I think there are parents that spank their kids at the drop of<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;     hat?  Yes.  Do I think there are parents that have tried talking,<br/>
tried<br/>
&gt;     removing from the situation, tried distracting and then finally<br/>
spanked<br/>
&gt;     because they didn&#39;t know what else to do?  Yes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Have I spanked my kids?  Yes.  Is it something I would recommend to<br/>
others?<br/>
&gt;     No.<br/>

&gt;     &gt; If you are on another email  list or group and something like<br/>
spanking<br/>
&gt;     comes up, do you try to voice your concerns or opinions on it? I just<br/>
did<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944264613">The point is that the medical professionals didn&#39;t know what to do with<br/>
David so he was &quot;treated&quot; in a manner that would seem horribly abusive to<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
This is often what is happening in a situation where a child is treated<br/>
roughly by a parent.  Again, I am not advocating spanking, yelling,<br/>
time-out, etc.  I just don&#39;t think it is always abusive.<br/>
<br/>
As a therapist, it has been my experience that most abusers are quite nice<br/>
to their children in public....the shit hits the fan when they get home.<br/>

&gt; &quot;No, he was tied up in a straight jacket instead &lt;sigh&gt;.  He eventually<br/>
grew old enough to drug and then eventually gained some bit of empathy....he<br/>
still could not function in a family setting.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is terribly sad. I&#39;m just not sure I understand the comparison of an<br/>
obvious mentally ill child to that of a normal healthy child being spanked<br/>
or hit for making mistakes or sometimes just for doing something the parent<br/>
didn&#39;t happen to like at that moment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Should we just close our eyes to possible abuse, so as not to sit in<br/>
judgement of others?<br/>

Do<br/>

&gt;   effective?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   No.  Do I think there are parents that spank their kids at the drop<br/>
of a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   hat?  Yes.  Do I think there are parents that have tried talking,<br/>
tried<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   removing from the situation, tried distracting and then finally<br/>
spanked<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   because they didn&#39;t know what else to do?  Yes.<br/>

<br/>
Oh I know this to be true. I understand melt down (by the mother) spankings more then I do the well thought out, &quot;now this for your own good type&quot; that tend to be much more frequent and considered acceptable. <br/>
<br/>
I think if a mom loses it and apoligizes for her actions, it&#39;s not great but it&#39;s more acceptable. It&#39;s the train of thought that it(spanking) is an acceptable form of punishment that I personally don&#39;t agree with. Which is what the women on this other list were referring to. Using spanking to get kids in line.<br/>

<br/>
  The point is that the medical professionals didn&#39;t know what to do with<br/>
  David so he was &quot;treated&quot; in a manner that would seem horribly abusive to<br/>
  us.<br/>
<br/>
  This is often what is happening in a situation where a child is treated<br/>
  roughly by a parent.  Again, I am not advocating spanking, yelling,<br/>
  time-out, etc.  I just don&#39;t think it is always abusive.<br/>
<br/>
  As a therapist, it has been my experience that most abusers are quite nice<br/>
  to their children in public....the shit hits the fan when they get home.<br/>

  &gt; &quot;No, he was tied up in a straight jacket instead &lt;sigh&gt;.  He eventually<br/>
  grew old enough to drug and then eventually gained some bit of empathy....he<br/>
  still could not function in a family setting.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; That is terribly sad. I&#39;m just not sure I understand the comparison of an<br/>
  obvious mentally ill child to that of a normal healthy child being spanked<br/>
  or hit for making mistakes or sometimes just for doing something the parent<br/>
  didn&#39;t happen to like at that moment.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; Should we just close our eyes to possible abuse, so as not to sit in<br/>
  judgement of others?<br/>

  &gt;   &gt; &quot;That was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other<br/>

  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt; I was just trying to point out there is another way. If the only way<br/>
  to<br/>
  &gt;   get a child to behave is by spanking, there is a much deeper problem as<br/>
  was<br/>
  &gt;   the case in your situtation. Gosh I would hope that a child with a<br/>
  &gt;   psychiatric illness wouldn&#39;t be hit as a solution.<br/>

  &gt;   &gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt; Curious how you all handle things like that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   Back when I was a therapist working at a children&#39;s locked<br/>
  psychiatric<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   facility, a young family admitted their 5yo child who was mentally<br/>
  &gt;   retarded.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   She threw fits, bit people, didn&#39;t sleep much, etc.....but I kept<br/>
  &gt;   wondering<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   why in the world this family admitted her.  She was 5 for gosh<br/>
  sakes.  I<br/>
  &gt;   had<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   children of my own and couldn&#39;t imagine not being able to handle a<br/>
  5yo.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   Then David came to live with us when we were foster parents.  David<br/>
  was<br/>
  &gt;   3<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   and actively psychotic.  He threw fits almost non-stop, kept<br/>
  forgetting<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   about the dog and screaming his head off every time he saw it, would<br/>
  &gt;   attack<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   other children for no apparent reason, didn&#39;t sleep at all that I<br/>
  could<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   tell.  After 6 days, I asked for him to be moved because I couldn&#39;t<br/>
  &gt;   handle<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   that kid.  A mother of 2 who had been trained for 6 years in child<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   psychology and had 10 years experience as a therapist couldn&#39;t<br/>
  handle a<br/>
  &gt;   3 yo<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   boy.<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   That was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other<br/>
  &gt;   parents...at<br/>
  &gt;   &gt;   least the ones I didn&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t know the story.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018468971">Not judging others shouldn&#39;t preclude disagreeing when others are <br/>
recommending spanking (or time outs, or standing in the corner with both arms over the <br/>
head and one leg raised, or shaming, or whatever nasty &quot;discipline tool&quot; is <br/>
being recommended) as effective parenting techniques. Not to speak up is shameful, <br/>
in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
When parents say &quot;I had to spank&quot; not to speak up is to be seen to agree. <br/>
Young parents who are reading these discussions especially need other parents to <br/>
speak up and say &quot;no, that is not ever necessary, you can learn to parent <br/>
differently&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand your example. Are you saying that either of those children <br/>
would have been helped by spanking, or that if parents resort to violence <br/>
with difficult children it&#39;s understandable and okay, that they shouldn&#39;t feel <br/>
bad about it or work to change it?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe any of that is true, and I think parents SHOULD feel bad when <br/>
they hurt their children. I know I do.<br/>

&lt;&lt; If nobody ever shared that there is an alternative to spanking, many moms <br/>
might never know it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s right.  And if we give up trying to do better &quot;because nobody&#39;s <br/>
perfect,&quot; we&#39;re not doing the best we can do.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If the only way to get a child to behave is by spanking, there is a much <br/>
deeper problem as was the case in your situtation.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And the problem is most likely with the parent.  Spanking might get a child <br/>
to behave a different way at the moment, but over the years, it creates a big <br/>
adult who wants to hit other smaller people.<br/>
<br/>
If someone&#39;s out of control at 50 lbs, he might grow out of it.  If someone&#39;s <br/>
out of control at 200 lbs, the world has a problem.<br/>
<br/>
-=&quot;So I try not to judge.&quot; I think there is a difference between judging and <br/>
between trying to point out other solutions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t judge&quot; is too often like &quot;I don&#39;t think&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m just not going to <br/>
be honest.&quot;<br/>
Without judgment we have no better/worse, no discernment, no preferences, not <br/>
likes or dislikes.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It means that I don&#39;t automatically assume that the person having the<br/>
<br/>
meltdown is lacking in some way.  Every single person has had a meltdown at<br/>
<br/>
one time or another, not been as kind as they wish they had,whatever. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the occasional meltdown or even swat that bothers me.  It&#39;s parents <br/>
who justify their actions (sometimes elaborately), own spanking tools, have <br/>
the child apologize to the mother after the mother was the one who unreasonably <br/>
lost it, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Some moms melt down as much as they want and never feel guilty, never desire <br/>
to do better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106530226">I&#39;ve been reading and watching for a couple months now<br/>
and don&#39;t say anything, but had an odd response to<br/>
your conversations on this subject.<br/>
I am a mom of 5 girls(4 mine, 1 step) and have<br/>
resorted to spanking in the past (youngest is 9 so<br/>
haven&#39;t spanked in years). I was raised with the<br/>
spanking philosophy, so at times I did resort to<br/>
spanking my kids, because that is what you&#39;re<br/>
&quot;supposed to do&quot;.  <br/>
However, while reading I had a odd remembrance from my<br/>
youth. I was 7 and my mom (divorced) was leaving me<br/>
and my 8 yo sister with a babysitter (21 yr old male)<br/>
so she could go pick up something from her work. I<br/>
threw a fit because we were being left (or so that is<br/>
what my mom thought). I was spanked probably 5-6<br/>
different times in a 15 min span -- would get taken to<br/>
my room, spanked, then would run outside to try to<br/>
stop her from leaving us, then the process would<br/>
repeat itself. She never stopped to find out why I was<br/>
acting that way and I wasn&#39;t prone to acting out.<br/>
Eventually, she just up and drove away with me<br/>
standing in the front yard screaming at her to stop.<br/>
Actually, what was happening was the babysitter was<br/>
sexually molesting my 8 yo sister, and had taken us<br/>
both with him to break into a couple houses while he<br/>
was &quot;watching&quot; us. I didn&#39;t want my sister to be hurt,<br/>
so I was attempting to get us taken with her instead<br/>
of being left. I guess she didn&#39;t talk much to us,<br/>
because she wouldn&#39;t listen.<br/>
So... I hadn&#39;t thought of that in years, but it<br/>
definitely is a good reason to listen to your kids,<br/>
especially if the behavior they are showing isn&#39;t<br/>
normal for them. <br/>
I really have never thought about the fact that you<br/>
don&#39;t have to spank. Your discussions have a way of<br/>
making people think twice about long held &quot;traditions&quot;<br/>
passed down by parents and not passing them down to<br/>
your kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506852907">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s the train of thought that it(spanking) is an acceptable form of<br/>
punishment that I personally don&#39;t agree with. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you.  But to take it a step farther....what is an acceptable<br/>
form of punishment?<br/>
<br/>
When we were foster parents, we often had small children living with us who<br/>
had no clue how to treat people or how to expect others to treat them.  We<br/>
were told over and over to use time-out.  I kept advocating for the kids,<br/>
saying over and over that taking a child a banishing them from perhaps the<br/>
only loving presence they have known is cruel and inhumane.....nobody<br/>
listened.<br/>
<br/>
But I can&#39;t say I always have the answer.  I do know that as my kids get<br/>
older, they are able to reason and things go better for us all.  That isn&#39;t<br/>
terribly comforting to a mom in the throws of toddlerhood.<br/>

&gt; &quot;As a therapist, it has been my experience that most abusers are quite<br/>
nice to their children in public....the shit hits the fan when they get<br/>
home.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh I know this to be true. I understand melt down (by the mother)<br/>
spankings more then I do the well thought out, &quot;now this for your own good<br/>
type&quot; that tend to be much more frequent and considered acceptable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think if a mom loses it and apoligizes for her actions, it&#39;s not great<br/>
but it&#39;s more acceptable. It&#39;s the train of thought that it(spanking) is an<br/>
acceptable form of punishment that I personally don&#39;t agree with. Which is<br/>
what the women on this other list were referring to. Using spanking to get<br/>
kids in line.<br/>

&gt;   The point is that the medical professionals didn&#39;t know what to do with<br/>
&gt;   David so he was &quot;treated&quot; in a manner that would seem horribly abusive<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   This is often what is happening in a situation where a child is treated<br/>
&gt;   roughly by a parent.  Again, I am not advocating spanking, yelling,<br/>
&gt;   time-out, etc.  I just don&#39;t think it is always abusive.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &quot;No, he was tied up in a straight jacket instead &lt;sigh&gt;.  He<br/>
eventually<br/>
&gt;   grew old enough to drug and then eventually gained some bit of<br/>

&gt;   &gt; That is terribly sad. I&#39;m just not sure I understand the comparison of<br/>
an<br/>
&gt;   obvious mentally ill child to that of a normal healthy child being<br/>
spanked<br/>
&gt;   or hit for making mistakes or sometimes just for doing something the<br/>
parent<br/>
&gt;   didn&#39;t happen to like at that moment.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>

&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &lt;&lt;&lt; Curious how you all handle things like that.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Back when I was a therapist working at a children&#39;s locked<br/>
&gt;   psychiatric<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   facility, a young family admitted their 5yo child who was<br/>
mentally<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   retarded.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   She threw fits, bit people, didn&#39;t sleep much, etc.....but I<br/>
kept<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   wondering<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   why in the world this family admitted her.  She was 5 for gosh<br/>
&gt;   sakes.  I<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   had<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   children of my own and couldn&#39;t imagine not being able to handle<br/>
a<br/>
&gt;   5yo.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Then David came to live with us when we were foster parents.<br/>
David<br/>
&gt;   was<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   3<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   and actively psychotic.  He threw fits almost non-stop, kept<br/>
&gt;   forgetting<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   about the dog and screaming his head off every time he saw it,<br/>
would<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   attack<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   other children for no apparent reason, didn&#39;t sleep at all that<br/>
I<br/>
&gt;   could<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   tell.  After 6 days, I asked for him to be moved because I<br/>
couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   handle<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   that kid.  A mother of 2 who had been trained for 6 years in<br/>
child<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   psychology and had 10 years experience as a therapist couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   handle a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   3 yo<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   boy.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   That was when I quit judging the parenting techniques of other<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   parents...at<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   least the ones I didn&#39;t know.  I don&#39;t know the story.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Do I think spanking is a good and effective parenting response?<br/>
No.<br/>
&gt;   Do<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   I<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   think time-out is?  No.  Do I think every child is capable of<br/>
the<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   empathy<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   required to make discussions of how our behavior effects others<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   effective?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   No.  Do I think there are parents that spank their kids at the<br/>
drop<br/>
&gt;   of a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   hat?  Yes.  Do I think there are parents that have tried<br/>
talking,<br/>
&gt;   tried<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   removing from the situation, tried distracting and then finally<br/>
&gt;   spanked<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   because they didn&#39;t know what else to do?  Yes.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   Have I spanked my kids?  Yes.  Is it something I would recommend<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   others?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   No.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; If you are on another email  list or group and something like<br/>
&gt;   spanking<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   comes up, do you try to voice your concerns or opinions on it? I<br/>
&gt;   just<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   did<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   because it seemed to be the norm on a board when discussing a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   behavioural<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   issue and I wanted the posters to know that there are others who<br/>
&gt;   feel<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   differently even if it&#39;s not the &quot;norm&quot; for the group.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; I&#39;m wondering now if it was wise, as I wait for the fall out.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;   &gt; Curious how you all handle things like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-657244139">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Are you saying that either of those children<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would have been helped by spanking, or that if parents resort to violence<br/>
&gt; with difficult children it&#39;s understandable and okay, that they shouldn&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>feel<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; bad about it or work to change it?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely not.  I&#39;m saying that often times experts who spend years<br/>
studying this exact type of thing don&#39;t know what to do.  To judge a parent<br/>
on how they handle a situation when all you get is a single still-frame of<br/>
the movie of their lives isn&#39;t fair.<br/>
<br/>
People tend to jump to the conclusion that if they see a parent meltdown<br/>
that the parent wanted to be acting that way...that this was their<br/>
plan....that they are awful, terrible people.  I will tell you a real life<br/>
example to see if this helps:<br/>
<br/>
You are cruising through a parking lot and just as you turn a corner you see<br/>
a dark haired woman grab a 2yo child by the arm and give her a swat on the<br/>
behind.  Makes me mad just to think of that.<br/>
<br/>
But let me give you the real life background.  This mom had a still-born<br/>
child that she still grieved over who would have been older than this child.<br/>
The mom felt guilty that perhaps she could have done something different so<br/>
that the baby would hav lived.  She played soccer as a stress-reliever for<br/>
herself and had injured her ankle the day before and was limping along.  The<br/>
mom and little girl were walking alone toward the parking lot where their<br/>
car was when the little girl took off running.  The mom called for her to<br/>
come back, to wait for her, to stop, etc. and the little girl laughed and<br/>
kept running.  The mom was hobbling as fast as she could trying to catch the<br/>
child.  The mom felt more and more panic rising in her chest as she watched<br/>
her dd getting closer and closer to the parking lot of cars.  She finally<br/>
caught her right at the curb, grabbing her by the arm and giving her a swat.<br/>
The mom cried on the way home thinking of what she had done.  Later, she<br/>
apologized to her daughter.  The mom felt so sad that she talked to me about<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Was the spanking &quot;called for&quot;?  no.  Did it make her a bad mother? no.<br/>
Would a stranger upbraiding this mom be helpful?  probably not.<br/>
<br/>
I know people&#39;s past colors how they see things.  I have never been abused<br/>
and perhaps that is why I see the above scenario happening much more often<br/>
than the woman who calls her kids names or pulls their hair when they don&#39;t<br/>
mind her immediately.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think parents SHOULD feel bad when they hurt their children.  I know I<br/>
do.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying anything different.  You admit that you sometimes hurt your<br/>
children.  All I&#39;m saying is that I wouldn&#39;t judge you as less of a person<br/>
for that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is abusive.....but the problem as I see it is the mental twisting of<br/>
reality (I hit you and now you owe me an apoloby) and the warping of the<br/>
relationship (kids are nothing/kids are gifts from God) , not the swat.<br/>
<br/>
Back when I worked as a therapist, we used to talk amongst ourselves about<br/>
child sexual abuse.  We came to the conclusion that the molestation itself<br/>
wasn&#39;t really the problem but it was the warping of reality to cover up (mom<br/>
walking in on the abuse and ignoring it) or attempt to excuse the<br/>
molestation (&quot;the child seduced me&quot;) that really damaged the kids.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; perfect,&quot; we&#39;re not doing the best we can do.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone is advocating this.  But I think making an offer to<br/>
help the mom, distracting the child, etc. is a much better option than<br/>
saying to the mom &quot;How would you like me to hit you?  Assault is illegal,<br/>
you know?&quot;  or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; &quot;I don&#39;t judge&quot; is too often like &quot;I don&#39;t think&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m just not<br/>
going to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be honest.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree with this at all.  I react with more of &quot;On some really bad<br/>
days in the past that could have been me.&quot;  And then I feel sad.<br/>
<br/>
When someone who wants to unschool comes to this board and says they<br/>
panicked and gave their kids some algebra problems, I don&#39;t judge them as<br/>
being less of a parent.  I think they are farther behind me in their<br/>
journey.  I am thinking and I am being honest.  I offer them suggestions<br/>
about what might work.<br/>
<br/>
Walking up to a school-at-homer and telling them they are all wet and<br/>
unschooling is the only way to go isn&#39;t going to get me very far.  Having<br/>
them see me with my kids, spend time with us playing and learning, modelling<br/>
unschooling for them might.<br/>
<br/>
I feel the same about parenting issues but I think people are extremely<br/>
defensive in that area particularly.  I think modelling alternative<br/>
parenting strategies, offering support is a better idea (how is that for<br/>
judgement?&lt;grin&gt;) than telling myself, my husband or even the parent that<br/>
the parents suck.<br/>

&gt; deeper problem as was the case in your situtation.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And the problem is most likely with the parent.  Spanking might get a<br/>
child<br/>
&gt; to behave a different way at the moment, but over the years, it creates a<br/>
big<br/>
&gt; adult who wants to hit other smaller people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone&#39;s out of control at 50 lbs, he might grow out of it.  If<br/>
someone&#39;s<br/>
&gt; out of control at 200 lbs, the world has a problem.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=&quot;So I try not to judge.&quot; I think there is a difference between judging<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; between trying to point out other solutions.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t judge&quot; is too often like &quot;I don&#39;t think&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m just not going<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be honest.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Without judgment we have no better/worse, no discernment, no preferences,<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; likes or dislikes.<br/>

I&#39;m really not trying to criticize, but... If you don&#39;t believe in spanking <br/>
why do you then? Or am I reading this statement wrong? Your kids are familiar <br/>
enough with it to know what it means? What is it? Spanking? Because they are <br/>
familiar with it it happens? In your &quot;rare occasion it happens&quot; statement you <br/>
make it sound like a cold, or falling off a bike. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I&#39;m not proud of it, and I always try to go back and see what I could do <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But it happens.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe instead of investigating the whys after the fact you could develop a <br/>
strategy now, instead of making statements that apply more to colds and falling <br/>
off bikes. <br/>
<br/>
Obviously these are made up, not what has happened at your house. Or maybe <br/>
they have? &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Scene one: The kids have been in moods all day. It is like a hurricane <br/>
outside, the cable is out, the second playstation controller broke, your car has a <br/>
flat, your partner&#39;s boss promoted the office ass instead, you bought the wrong <br/>
color of hair dye and didn&#39;t notice until after you dyed it, your period is <br/>
going to start any minute, and your son decided to play an impromptu game of <br/>
baseball in the dining room and your daughter is now screaming that he wrecked <br/>
her *My Little Pony* stable. So you spank them both. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t believe in it, but it happens.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Scene two: Same as above, except you intervened when you discovered the <br/>
second playstation controller was broken and now you are all sitting enjoying the <br/>
cookies you baked together, playing a rousing game of Sorry! <br/>
Bonus! You are laughing and having so much fun with the kids when you get the <br/>
call about the jerk at the office getting the promotion you can&#39;t be too <br/>
upset, you never got around to dying your hair, the chocolate in the cookies is <br/>
making you feel better about your period, you aren&#39;t going to be stepping on *My <br/>
Little Pony* pieces wrecked by a game of indoor baseball. ;o) OH! And no one <br/>
got spanked! <br/>
