<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103939540">I just read ONE of the CDC publications on the MMR vaccine--it contained a<br/>
summarization and statistic history of the diseases that are now under<br/>
control because of this vaccine<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm)">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm)</a>.  There are a ton of<br/>
others to read as well.  The numbers of reported cases (and deaths,<br/>
stillbirths, deformities, etc.) prior to the vaccine becoming available are<br/>
frightening!  It stated that with rubella alone, 85% of the children who<br/>
were born by mothers who contracted the disease during the first 8 weeks of<br/>
pregnancy were affected by the disease.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what figures some of you are using to justify the danger of<br/>
vaccines... but 40,000 to 60,000 cases A YEAR of rubella alone were the norm<br/>
before the vaccine.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that in all things moderation and information is necessary, but<br/>
exactly what kind of information is necessary to make this seem important?<br/>
<br/>
I know a little about these CDC folks... these aren&#39;t people who went into<br/>
medicine to make a profit.  The researchers and statisticians who join the<br/>
CDC are passionate about solving the world&#39;s diseases.  While some of these<br/>
folks might be described as bleeding heart liberals, at least they have<br/>
hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the homeopathic approach of giving a child camomilla??? I agree<br/>
with your warning about following that plan... Camomilla is one of the<br/>
strongest and most commonly known carcinogens.  Anyone that would give that<br/>
in any substantive dose to a child is misinformed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-217205751">Alrighty, let me preface this by saying that I wish you were sitting at the<br/>
table on my deck and that we could sit around with an iced tea and discuss<br/>
this because the written word never conveys the &quot;tone&quot; of what another one<br/>
is saying.  Therefore, remember, we are sitting around, NOT being<br/>
confrontational but simply discussing things.<br/>
<br/>
Connie, the folks working for CDC are NOT all in it for altruistic reasons.<br/>
They are no different than any other beaurocrat and just as dishonest as the<br/>
majority.<br/>
<br/>
CDC reports and logs what they please.  And when numbers aren&#39;t going their<br/>
way you will find a year with no figures.  Or they will change the reporting<br/>
criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has worked in the medical field (which I have for many years) is<br/>
fully aware that CDC reports what CDC wants to report!<br/>
<br/>
Also, the number of deaths, low birth weights, stillbirths and deformities<br/>
is still high.  In fact, it has hardly gone down at all.  The only<br/>
difference is they blame it on something else now.  I mean, come on, we rank<br/>
25th in the world for infant mortality!<br/>
<br/>
O.K., here&#39;s the bottom line, IMHO, on all this stuff and the whole point<br/>
that was originally being made, I think, informed choice.  You want measles<br/>
vaccine, fine you have your children given the shots but, my child does not<br/>
belong to you or the government, so keep your needles off my child.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think if you are feeding your child processed foods off the<br/>
average grocery shelf you are taking your child down the road to a slow<br/>
death.  But I&#39;m not going to try to force you to give up beef and buy only<br/>
organic and get rid of your teflon and plastics and all the formaldehyde<br/>
ladened things (clothes, sheets, mattresses, etc.) in your home because I<br/>
think they are also causing harm to your children.<br/>
<br/>
But, here&#39;s the big difference.  I will give you the info if you ask but I<br/>
won&#39;t try to force you to feed your child healthy food AND I won&#39;t ask the<br/>
government to force you to do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353812294">I&#39;m going to throw in my opinion, I guess it is actually a philosophy, and<br/>
hopefully that will make my point of view a little easier to understand.<br/>
There will always be something.  We keep digging more and more diseases out<br/>
of places we would have never gone if we weren&#39;t so consumer-oriented.  And<br/>
nature finds a way.  Humans are not all-powerful, and the Earth must find a<br/>
way to control our population or we will surely suffocate her.<br/>
Disease, famine, all that fun stuff is natural and needed.  I hope we never<br/>
find a cure for Cancer.  We caused cancer (at least the rampant kind), and<br/>
it is needed to control our population.  As is all these other diseases.<br/>
They come in waves, people die, it isn&#39;t pretty, it makes us sad, but that<br/>
is life.  And it makes our life better in the long run.<br/>
And then you have things like the Flu shots... incredible stupidity right<br/>
there.  The mass use of this is only speeding up the evolution of super,<br/>
very lethal flus that will be immune to anything we throw at it.<br/>
The diseases will only get worse and more terrifying because we cannot<br/>
escape our fate as humans.  I almost lost my daughter after she was born, I<br/>
could not even imagine what it would be like to have a child die.  I&#39;ve seen<br/>
a friend&#39;s child die and it was incredible how the mother was able to<br/>
survive.  But death is a part of life, and if you are a part of any of the<br/>
world&#39;s religions this should not be such a terrifying thing.  And if you<br/>
are not the spiritual type, then you probably can relate more to my<br/>
matter-of-fact views than others.<br/>
Tampering with nature is dangerous, we have learned that over and over and<br/>
over again.  And yet we continue to destroy ourselves through attempting to<br/>
claim some victory over Nature, for the sake of convenience or tidyness or a<br/>
little more money... and yet we all still empty inside like something is<br/>
missing even though we have the kids, the 2 story house full of stuff and 2<br/>
cars (including a mini-van or SUV) in the garage.<br/>
Vaccines are only one small part of how we tamper with a very fragile<br/>
system, and philosophically I despise it, and despise the society that<br/>
guilts me into thinking I am not doing right for my children by the choices<br/>
I make.  Perhaps I am faulty for caring for the people that must come after<br/>
us, or the people on the other side of the globe.  But it pains me,<br/>
physically and truly, knowing what people do for themselves without caring,<br/>
or even caring to know about what the repurcussions are.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I just read ONE of the CDC publications on the MMR vaccine--it contained a<br/>
summarization and statistic history of the diseases that are now under<br/>
control because of this vaccine<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm)">http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/00053391.htm)</a>.  There are a ton of<br/>
others to read as well.  The numbers of reported cases (and deaths,<br/>
stillbirths, deformities, etc.) prior to the vaccine becoming available are<br/>
frightening!  It stated that with rubella alone, 85% of the children who<br/>
were born by mothers who contracted the disease during the first 8 weeks of<br/>
pregnancy were affected by the disease.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what figures some of you are using to justify the danger of<br/>
vaccines... but 40,000 to 60,000 cases A YEAR of rubella alone were the norm<br/>
before the vaccine.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that in all things moderation and information is necessary, but<br/>
exactly what kind of information is necessary to make this seem important?<br/>
<br/>
I know a little about these CDC folks... these aren&#39;t people who went into<br/>
medicine to make a profit.  The researchers and statisticians who join the<br/>
CDC are passionate about solving the world&#39;s diseases.  While some of these<br/>
folks might be described as bleeding heart liberals, at least they have<br/>
hearts.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the homeopathic approach of giving a child camomilla??? I agree<br/>
with your warning about following that plan... Camomilla is one of the<br/>
strongest and most commonly known carcinogens.  Anyone that would give that<br/>
in any substantive dose to a child is misinformed!<br/>

religion to see that. I completely agree with your thinking, except I would <br/>
say death is not an end, but simply a passing on into another phase. I don&#39;t <br/>
believe life ends at all. . . just changes directions maybe. Thanks for <br/>
putting your thoughts down for others to enjoy.<br/>
