<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613846176">I am just going to have to see the Pirates movie now!!! After the <br/>
way everyone seems to describe Johnney Depp, LOL.<br/>
Now to get to my main reason for posting - 2 kids and 1 computer! <br/>
and soon I believe it will be 4 kids and 2 computers but still the <br/>
same basic issue. Should I have them sign up for time on a weekly <br/>
sheet and just make sure they are all allowed equal access? It <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to work well so far as having them &quot;work it out&quot; <br/>
because they do 15 minute turns and they spend half the day then <br/>
waiting around for their turn... Plus the person who only gets the <br/>
15 minutes usually doesn&#39;t get a lot done in that much time as well. <br/>
We are going to do a family meeting on this but I would really <br/>
appreciate some suggestions on ways that this could be resolved <br/>
before it becomes a major battle. Thank you!</div>

<br/>
I recently bought a used one, and plan to get a new low-end one after we get our tax overpayment.  Then we will have three.<br/>
<br/>
If you keep your eyes open, you can get some good deals.  I paid $100 for 386 mhz, 10G HD, CD drive, and 128MB RAM.  And I live in a low-population region.  If you are closer to an urban area, there should be loads of used computer stores or ads in the paper.  You don&#39;t necessarily need a printer for each computer.  Think of what you would spend on school supplies if your kids were in school.  A computer would be a great way to spend that money.  I have done some upgrading too.  If you watch for sales and rebates, you can often get extra drives and RAM for very little money.<br/>

<br/>
No.  Equal time is never fair.  Some need more.  Equal portions of food is <br/>
never fair to the bigger or more hungry ones.   Equal attention from mom is <br/>
never fair to the saddest or smallest ones.<br/>
<br/>
Let one use it until he&#39;s through and let the  next one use it until he&#39;s <br/>
through.  Some turns might be very short. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how we&#39;ve done it for years and it&#39;s worked really well.  We have two <br/>
computers for four, but for a long time we had one for four.  (My husband uses <br/>
the computer at work, not home.)<br/>
