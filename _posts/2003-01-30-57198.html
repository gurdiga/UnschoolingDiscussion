&gt;&gt; But finding work you love and figuring out how to make it work for the life<br/>
&gt;&gt; you want, isn&#39;t that a great life goal?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Like unschooling, if you want something better, it&#39;s more helpful to listen<br/>
&gt;&gt; to people who know there are better options and have found them or are<br/>
&gt;&gt; working toward them than people who are willing to stop part way.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree that it&#39;s a great goal to work towards but we all know how sometimes<br/>
&gt; life gets in the way and we take a different path, maybe not what we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; always dreamed of but sometimes we have to learn to be happy where we are at<br/>
&gt; too, that&#39;s the sadder part of reality.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a great deal of the problem is that people don&#39;t look for<br/>
alternatives. Dad is bringing in whatever income he does -- fine if it&#39;s<br/>
work that he likes that is fulfilling to him and that he feels mostly-good<br/>
about. Bad if it&#39;s work that he drags himself to every day to sacrifice for<br/>
the rest of the family that gets to stay home and play.<br/>
<br/>
The alternatives are out there: home business, telecommuting, mom and dad<br/>
both taking part-time jobs to share the load (once the kids are past the<br/>
toddler ages, maybe), sharing living expenses with another family, moving to<br/>
much cheaper housing or otherwise adopting a frugal lifestyle -- these are<br/>
all possibilities, some may fit in with a family&#39;s needs, some may not, and<br/>
there are many others.<br/>
<br/>
If one member of our family had a bad-to-him job to go to 5 days out of 7,<br/>
while the rest of us lived in clover, I wouldn&#39;t feel good about that, nor<br/>
would I stop looking for the solution that would end up working for us all.<br/>
