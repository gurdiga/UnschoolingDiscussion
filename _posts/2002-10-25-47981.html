<div id="ygrps-yiv-516718521">This was specifically about the Peaceful Parenting tape, but there are others <br/>
here too.  <br/>
And don&#39;t let this keep you from ordering from Kelly&#39;s SC tapes when those <br/>
are ready!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; how do we get the tape you spoke about? what is the cost? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can order it from Happy Harry who copies the tapes for HSC<br/>
or you can order it from me, when I get the stuff I left in SC, which will be <br/>
a few days from now.  There were things both at Kelly&#39;s house and that marty <br/>
had in the room when he checked out Tuesday that needed to be packed and <br/>
sent.  Poor KELLY!  Tons of stuff to go through.<br/>
<br/>
But anyway, <br/>
I have permission to order copies of my own tapes from the distributor to <br/>
sell.<br/>
<br/>
From me, $6 a tape and $1 for mailing per tape<br/>
I have three of those listed below plus two from the 2001 conference, mine on <br/>
Unschooling Gloriously Introduced, and one of me and Richard Prystowsky <br/>
called &quot;To Question or Not to Question--that is the question.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
2905 Tahiti Ct. NE<br/>
Albuquerque NM  87112<br/>
<br/>
From Harry you&#39;ll need the tape&#39;s number, too, and that&#39;s the letter and <br/>
number after each item, below:<br/>
<br/>
Tapes $6.00 each Ca. Res. Add Sales Tax 8.25%<br/>
Shipping will be $1.75 1-2 tapes, 3-6 $3.25, 7-15 $ 3.75<br/>
