<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137166711">Deana,<br/>
One of my daughters is like this.  She just asked me if I would stand at the<br/>
board and lecture the assignments!  I told her no, that I am preparing her<br/>
to do independent study and to help her follow her heart.  She didn&#39;t get<br/>
it!  She is worried about her spelling and wanted a textbook so I got her a<br/>
workbook to use.  She uses it faithfully, bringing me the list to test her<br/>
on.  She also wants math worksheets.  I was hesitant, but she spent some<br/>
time yesterday surfing for math worksheet sites and brought me a list of<br/>
them.  So, I printed off a few for her to do.  I still believe I am<br/>
unschooling because I am following her lead.  It&#39;s all about what the child<br/>
wants to do.   She is more apt to follow her own lead in learning about<br/>
ancient cultures and she chooses what books to read on the subjects she is<br/>
interested in. <br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>

<br/>
Even teacher training classes in the U.S. are now advising future <br/>
teachers that they should stop acting like &quot;the sage on the stage&quot; <br/>
(lecturing), and be more of &quot;a guide on the side&quot; (facilitating).  (You <br/>
can tell her I said so.)<br/>
<br/>
I personally hate lectures and love textbooks, so I think my learning <br/>
style may be quite different from you daughter&#39;s.  But if she likes <br/>
lectures, she may also learn well from videos.   I think that the <br/>
History Channel, and the Discovery channel and PBS all have websites <br/>
with resources for teachers that go with their various TV programs. <br/>
Possibly even downloadable worksheets.   (How wicked is that?)  In some <br/>
areas, community colleges broadcast some of their lecture classes.  Some <br/>
of them are dull enough to cure insomnia, but I really like the foreign <br/>
language instruction classes that I&#39;ve seen.  (The fancy Capretz <br/>
programs: French in Action and Destinos.)<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds awfully schooly.  I&#39;m not saying &quot;make her do it&quot;, <br/>
just show her some options.  If they don&#39;t suit her, she&#39;ll drop them <br/>
pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
And learning whatever you can about &quot;deschooling&quot; may help, too.<br/>

<br/>
If the parent or child knows no other way, then they&#39;re not making a choice, <br/>
they&#39;re doing the only thing they know of that will work.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Faithfully&quot; seems to me to be a telling word to use, if it was chosen <br/>
consciously.<br/>
And if it was used UNconsciously, even worse.  Faith in a workbook being <br/>
stronger than faith in natural learning or faith in herself says, to me, that <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t understood yet in that family.<br/>
