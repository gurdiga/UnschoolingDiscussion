&lt;&lt; OT:  I&#39;ve got a question about Alan Rickman movies.  I may be mistaken, <br/>
but <br/>
 did someone in this group say that he was in a Robin Hood movie? &gt;&gt;<br/>

Yes, he was the very naughty Sheriff of Nottingham.....and SO sexy. It was <br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>

complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
