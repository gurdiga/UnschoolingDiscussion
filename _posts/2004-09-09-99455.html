<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824012201">Today, awakened by the alarm clock at 7. Got up at 8. :) Came downstairs to kids watching <br/>
recorded anime cartoons with breakfast made and eaten. Cleaned up kitchen and checked <br/>
email. I teach online classes so I responded to work there.<br/>
<br/>
Drove my daughter to school.<br/>
<br/>
The kids and I read a chapter from Rascal, our current read aloud book, all snuggled on <br/>
the couch.<br/>
<br/>
Then I had to work on a paper for grad school so the three kids took the dog for a long <br/>
walk to a local park to play. They were gone for about 45 minutes. My oldest woke up and <br/>
wanted to discuss Memento (movie) so I did that for ten minutes. fun.<br/>
<br/>
Finished the paper and made lunch. We ate together. Kids and I did a quick pick up and <br/>
then they played a spy game where one of them hides outside and tries to &quot;break into the <br/>
house&quot; through a window and race upstairs undetected. They love this! They did that for <br/>
over an hour. Broke into an argument. I helped settle it and then they played some more.<br/>
<br/>
13 yr. old watched Usher bust some moves on TV and then worked in his MathUSee book <br/>
(he requested a math program so we bought him one and he loves it). Youngest daughter <br/>
added more memoribilia to her ever expanding personal notebook. Everyone helped fold <br/>
laundry. Liam (10) played computer games.<br/>
<br/>
Oldest took my car to a job interview.<br/>
<br/>
I checked email, saw my flylady reminders and got in gear to pick up the house before <br/>
leaving for grad school.<br/>
<br/>
Oldest returned later than I expected and I was now in full hurry mode. He saw that I was a <br/>
bit stressed needing to leve but with a refrigerator that appeared to be broken suddenly <br/>
and lots of frozen foods needing to go down to the basement freezer, not to mention the <br/>
need to clean up the kitchen so everyone could make a peaceful dinner while I was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Noah said, &quot;Mom, just go. I&#39;ll take care of everything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He did. He moved all the food, emptied the dishwasher and cleaned up all the dirty dishes. <br/>
and he got dinner out to be heated (chili I made yesterday).<br/>
<br/>
I went to grad school while Noah and Dad repaired Noah&#39;s car. Kids watched TV and <br/>
played computer games. Daughter came home to do email and homework.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the evening, I had conversations with every single family member. Amazing. <br/>
All happened naturally, but as i was typing, I realized that I had connected to everyone. <br/>
Noah asked me what I learned in class. My hsuband and I debriefed about class and kids. <br/>
Daughter and I went over her school day and had a few good chuckles. Little kids each <br/>
found me and chatted.<br/>
<br/>
It was a very ordinary day. But very nice too.<br/>
<br/>
I feel full.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800634612">Thanks for all the new day-in the-life accounts.  I<br/>
needed to read some new ones (I miss unschooling.com).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think I over-strew and squash interests. <br/>
Oh, you like poodles?  Here&#39;s a thousand books, a<br/>
field trip and a few movies. &quot;Great, Mom, now I&#39;m so<br/>
sick of poodles, I never want to see another!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Where do you store art supplies (or science kits or<br/>
whatever) so they are easy to reach (but not for a<br/>
toddler) and in plain view without being messy?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is the temptation, isn&#39;t it? I find that if my own life is full (I have stuff to do that <br/>
interests me), I am less likely to overdo their interests. <br/>
<br/>
And at times I offer: Do you want me to check to see if there are any books on that topic? <br/>
I&#39;ll be at the library later.<br/>
<br/>
Or: Here&#39;s a book about drawing that might help. (And I limit it to one book.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Always a trick. When I had toddlers, I kept my art supplies in the kitchen cupboards next <br/>
to the glasses. They weren&#39;t in plain view, but the kids knew where they were.<br/>
<br/>
My girlfriend had what I wanted. She had a bigger house and more tables. She kept her art <br/>
supplies in caddies (the kind that people use for cleaning supplies, etc.). She would put <br/>
them on the table when the kids were asleep and they would wake to see them there. If <br/>
they wanted to use them, they did. If the toddler was climbing on the table, she could pick <br/>
up the caddy and move it to a new location with ease.<br/>
<br/>
That made sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are older now and we use a big white cupboard for all that stuff and they know <br/>
where to find them.<br/>

<br/>
I think storing stuff on shelves or in closets or in boxes is good, but <br/>
then with strewing *rotate* them out onto the kitchen table or coffee <br/>
table.  It&#39;s kind of like a current.  You want to keep it flowing and <br/>
fresh, not stagnant.<br/>
<br/>
(I really don&#39;t know how to deal with the toddler part.  Because in my <br/>
house it works better for my son to see something than to hear me make a <br/>
suggestion.  He likes his ideas far better than my suggestions.)<br/>
<br/>
Also, just go ahead and be &quot;messy&quot;, or at least cluttered.  Try to think <br/>
of it positively, as a rich environment.  Whole fat milk, not skim.  <br/>
(Metaphorically.  Whole fat clutter. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Different times of life have been different for us in this regard. <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ve been pretty nonresponsive to new interests - that is <br/>
because I have three kids who have a LOT of interests. I have to admit <br/>
that there have been times that my kids had to get to the point of <br/>
BEGGING me to help them get involved in something new &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Other times,  I&#39;ve been over-enthusiastic - sometimes concerned that a <br/>
kid wasn&#39;t &quot;doing enough&quot; - and jumped too quickly on some minor <br/>
indication she might be interested in something &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
They let me know when I&#39;m not on target &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

This works for me, too.  The other thing I do is I just ask before I <br/>
spend money.  A lot of times I ask, and they tell me they aren&#39;t <br/>
interested.  Actually, a lot of times I find they aren&#39;t interested <br/>
in what I think they&#39;d be interested in and I&#39;ve just saved money by <br/>
asking first.<br/>

Ok, this totally doesn&#39;t make sense.  What I am trying to say is <br/>
that if you ask your kids if they want something before you buy it, <br/>
you may find they don&#39;t want it and you&#39;ve saved yourself the money.<br/>
<br/>
There, that&#39;s better!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve done that! lol  A few years ago we stopped at a park in a <br/>
different town after an appointment.  There was a stream running <br/>
through the playground, and we just had a perfect day.  We played at <br/>
the playground, played in the water, took pictures of the swans, and <br/>
followed the stream into a wooded area where it emptied into a big <br/>
river.  My kids were just fascinated by the day.  They asked which <br/>
river that was, and I wasn&#39;t sure if it was the Susquehanna or the <br/>
Schuylkill, so I went home and looked it up and told them.  That&#39;s <br/>
all they really wanted.  To know the name of the river, and to have <br/>
the memory of a really fun, full day.  <br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t stop there. ;)  I talked to them about every place on <br/>
the Susquehanna river we&#39;d ever seen, and then ordered a map of the <br/>
chesapeake bay watershed.  I planned a trip to the lake where the <br/>
river started, several spots along the river, and then to Maryland <br/>
where the river empties into the ocean.  I got stickers so we could <br/>
put a sticker on the map of every place we visited.  I got a few <br/>
books, one about salmon, one Minn of the Mississippi I think it was <br/>
called...I was on a roll &lt;grin&gt;  I thought for SURE they&#39;d like all <br/>
this since they had such a good day and were so interested in the <br/>
river we visited.  <br/>
<br/>
So one day I was talking to the kids about plans for the NY trip, and <br/>
dd said to me ever so gently, &quot;Ummm...Mom?  Do you know that you&#39;re <br/>
the only one interested in any of these trips?&quot;  roflol  I&#39;m glad she <br/>
burst my bubble before I dragged them all around the east coast. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
But anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I think when it comes to knowing how much to strew, it&#39;s important to <br/>
listen to and trust your maternal instinct.  Learn to recognize the <br/>
difference between your maternal instinct and the school voices in <br/>
your head.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m planning on reorganizing my cellar (it&#39;s a finished cellar) and <br/>
making it into a huge art area.  I bought those over the door <br/>
organizers to hang on the wall with nails instead of over doors.  The <br/>
ones I got have lots of pockets and they&#39;re mesh, so you could easily <br/>
see what was in them.  I plan on just keeping them filled with cool <br/>
art supplies. <br/>
