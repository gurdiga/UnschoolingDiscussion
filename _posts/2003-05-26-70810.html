 </span></blockquote>You can bring knives and such as long as they&#39;re in your checked luggage.  I<br/>
always bring a knife or two, a can opener, veggie peeler, and things like<br/>
that when I travel.  Much easier to make a simple meal in a hotel room.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies if I just ruined your excuse for avoiding the playing with your<br/>
food funshop, though! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042534949"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; That must be our reason also.  My daughter said the F word yesterday, the<br/>
&gt; whole family just stooped dead in their tracks and looked at me.  Ugh, it<br/>
&gt; prob. was me earlier in the day someone had nearly run my car off the road<br/>
&gt; and I am certain I said that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She may have only been trying out a new word, but now she&#39;s discovered it&#39;s<br/>
a power word.  If your family doesn&#39;t make an issue of it, it will probably<br/>
go away naturally, assuming you&#39;d prefer that.<br/>
<br/>
My son was two when he dropped something on his foot and used the F word to<br/>
express his displeasure.  We just ignored it, although my brain spun around<br/>
the idea that I needed to clean up my language, and soon!<br/>
<br/>
I think I next heard the F word when he was 5, as part of a question.<br/>
Something like, &quot;Why do soldiers say, um, uh, f*@$ so much?&quot;  I made an<br/>
effort to answer the question, commented that it&#39;s not a great word in some<br/>
people&#39;s minds (such as his Grandmother, whom we were seeing soon), and that<br/>
his father never uses it.<br/>
<br/>
In recent weeks he&#39;s used it occasionally, but likely because I tend to<br/>
swear more when my husband is away.  Something to do with the number of<br/>
things that go wrong when he&#39;s gone, probably!<br/>

<br/>
None of my kids have ever really used language like that when they were<br/>
little. I guess we&#39;re just lucky. Hell or damn slipped out once or twice<br/>
with each one of them and I remember Tara using &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; in not a nice<br/>
way to her dad once. But fuck or even bitch or shit never happened. Guess<br/>
it&#39;s just not in them!!<br/>
