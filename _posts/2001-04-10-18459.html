This reminded me of the thread about kids being home alone. Who would have thought you&#39;d have to worry about this, of all things?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858779676">I feel very sorry for the girl and her family but why was the alarm left on when<br/>
she was in the house anyway? Her mom had to know that this could be a<br/>
possibility. Didn&#39;t the girl hear the police car out front, then the knocking? I<br/>
understand that most kids are instructed not to answer the doors but if there<br/>
was a siren she probably could have looked out the window to verify that it was<br/>
the police or another emergency vehicle. I&#39;m not defending the dog or the police<br/>
for this action. I also wonder why the police did not try to contact the mother<br/>
at work before entry. Maybe they believe it takes too much time, but I thought a<br/>
lot of security systems have a &quot;checklist&quot; of sorts to check prior to contacting<br/>
the police. The dog should also have been trained to &quot;bark not bite&quot; as long as<br/>
there is no weapon in the hands. The things that get me most about these kind of<br/>
articles are that they are only going to print enough to capture your attention<br/>
and get you upset about it so that the media can keep going with stories like<br/>
this.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-901419125">tammy,<br/>
it says toward the beginning<br/>
&quot;The address given to police by the alarm company was<br/>
                                       wrong, police said. &quot;<br/>
so the burglar alarm went off for some other house and the police went<br/>
to the wrong house.  the kids&#39; house had no alarm (or at least it wasn&#39;t<br/>
turned on) and the kids didn&#39;t respond to the police at the front door,<br/>
as they had been instructed by their mother not to answer the door.  i<br/>
doubt they use a siren when responding to a burglar alarm.<br/>
<br/>
while this is more than unlikely (less than unlikely?) to happen, of<br/>
course, there are a lot of situations kids left home alone don&#39;t know<br/>
how to handle.  i think that was the intent behind the article.  you<br/>
can&#39;t tell them open the door if it&#39;s a policeman cause we know about<br/>
that trick too.  sigh.<br/>

I agree, so what&#39;s your solution (anyone) to latch key kids?  I have my own thoughts, but I will wait to hear what others have to share.<br/>

attack dog is  snuck through a window and disobeys handlers commands to wait<br/>
until handler can break in front door.<br/>
