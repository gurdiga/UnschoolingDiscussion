&gt;<br/>
&gt;This was a great idea, Michelle!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   We homeschool for a number of reasons such as my own negative <br/>
&gt;experiences<br/>
&gt;with public school, and my stubborn refusal to let anyone else raise my<br/>
&gt;child. But I,m always adding new and better reasons, for instance, reading<br/>
&gt;everyone else&#39;s posts I find myself saying over and over- yeah, I agree <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;that!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have just the one son so far-Gary age 6.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Gary has been VERY into bugs since before he could walk, and recently he,ms<br/>
&gt;gotten interested in Spanish,and how electricity works(which has stumped <br/>
&gt;me,<br/>
&gt;I have no idea how to explain this to a 6 year old without boring him to<br/>
&gt;tears,I have looked on the web, but most of what I found is a little too<br/>
&gt;advanced as he doesn&#39;t read much yet.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We live in Topeka,Kansas, and I,m actually very satisfied with the laws.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We currently have 2 Dachsunds, and 2 cats, although in the past year or so<br/>
&gt;we&#39;ve also had ,cockateils, Anoles, Red eared sliders and various species <br/>
&gt;of<br/>
&gt;fish, not to mention,dozens of varieties of insects in jars!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We are rather eclectic spiritually. We are practising Wiccans, and I also<br/>
&gt;attend a UU felowship, would like to be a member of CUUPS but we have no<br/>
&gt;chapter here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t always have time to post, somedays it&#39;s al I can do to read my<br/>
&gt;e-mail, but I too adore this list, I have learned alot from it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s all I can think of.<br/>
&gt;                             Blessings, Trisha<br/>
