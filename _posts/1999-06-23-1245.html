<div id="ygrps-yiv-953478641">Hi Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
Nope.  The sun doesn&#39;t set here this time of year.<br/>
It gets pretty low<br/>
in the sky, but it&#39;s certainly still light enough to<br/>
see clearly.  We<br/>
won&#39;t have &quot;pitch black&quot; until wintertime.  Our days<br/>
will get<br/>
progressively shorter until mid-December, when we<br/>
will only have<br/>
sunlight for about 2-3 hours (and even then, it&#39;s<br/>
not &quot;bright&quot; by any<br/>
stretch of the imagination).  This drastic change<br/>
does bother some folks<br/>
a great deal, but I&#39;ve been here now for over 20<br/>
years, so I&#39;m used to<br/>
it.  My husband took me to Seattle a few years back<br/>
for Mother&#39;s Day ...<br/>
we were there for an extended weekend... I thought<br/>
it&#39;s was SOOOOO weird<br/>
that it was &quot;nighttime&quot; at 8pm in MAY!!!  Here, it<br/>
still looks like the<br/>
afternoon at 2am that time of year!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yep.  Santa&#39;s house is still here!  I live 4 miles<br/>
from him!!<br/>
<br/>
Have a lovely day,<br/>
Monica</div>
