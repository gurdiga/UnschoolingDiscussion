<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717927598">Hi my name is Shelly. I live in Connecticut with my 5 children (Britt<br/>
13, Nate 11, Chelsea 9, Cody 7 and Jake 2) and my husband John. We have<br/>
been homeschooling for close to 5 years now. We pulled the kids out of<br/>
school for several different reason from one being totally bored and<br/>
unchallenged to Nate being beat up nearly everyday and just not socially<br/>
doing well which as you can guess made his school work suffer. Chelsea<br/>
only went a few weeks of kindergarten. And Cody has never been to school<br/>
at all. So recently when he heard you had to raise your hand to go to<br/>
the bathroom and couldn&#39;t enjoy a glass of juice when you want he<br/>
decided school sounded more like a jail and he never wants to go. *L*<br/>
<br/>
We had originally wanted to homeschool. Neither my husband or myself had<br/>
a good experience in school at all. He left in 10th grade and I left in<br/>
11 grade. He took the high school equivalency test and I took night<br/>
school and then the GED. He went on to work construction and I traveled<br/>
the country and then we got married at 18 years old. We have known each<br/>
other since we were 11 years old.  Family was fully against us<br/>
homeschooling when I began reading more on it when Britt was 18 months<br/>
old. We then decided maybe a Waldorf school which of course got worse<br/>
reviews. The running thought in his family is that we are trying to<br/>
raise communists. How they came up with this is beyond me but my father<br/>
in law still thinks this but at least is learning to keep his mouth<br/>
shut.  Anyhow when we moved to CT from CA we decided to give the schools<br/>
a try since the class size was so small. Didn&#39;t work as I said above. So<br/>
we started our adventures in homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Over the past 5 years I have reworked our way of schooling several<br/>
times. We started out doing school at home. I think it was more part of<br/>
my de-schooling than theirs. I am glad that only lasted a few months.<br/>
Next we tried Oak Meadow. I used that nearly 2 years until I had Jacob<br/>
and found my kids actually did learn without the books. So from there on<br/>
out we would use the Oak Meadow and Saxon math when we felt like that.<br/>
Some days were more structured than others.  Lately though I just even<br/>
think some of that is to structured and decided to toss in the towel<br/>
after talking with other unschoolers about their day  and reading up.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I am on another adventure. :0)<br/>
<br/>
I noticed you all were talking about colleges. I suppose there are<br/>
career where you need a college degree. My husband is in one of those<br/>
jobs now working in NYC for one of the top 10 marketing and advertising<br/>
firms and being upper management. He only like I said before has a 10th<br/>
grade education and went to trade school for 9 months (he doubled on the<br/>
course to go finish faster as we had 2 children at home to feed and debt<br/>
piling up after our constructions company went under do to economic<br/>
times during the gulf war). This got him in ground floor. He worked hard<br/>
over the next few years and everything he is doing now is nothing he<br/>
learned in school which cracks me up. It is all from working at jobs,<br/>
keeping his ears and eyes open and learning new skills and taking those<br/>
skills to a new job and learning more there. Companies have paid to have<br/>
him trained in certain programs and to work certain machines and he is<br/>
really the one who has benefited from this. Life really had been his<br/>
school teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Now he hires people and he will not really look at their education<br/>
background. He looks at their work experience and what they say they can<br/>
do and then bring them in and is able to see who they are. Like he said<br/>
it is rather easy to doctor up degrees and on the other side he has had<br/>
guys work for him who have years of college behind them and they stunk<br/>
or were unable to think for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I know not every career is like this but hopefully it gives some hope to<br/>
those who are worried. I know lots of people who are working in great<br/>
jobs making really really good money and never went to college and some<br/>
only have a GED some have trade school some just worked their way up and<br/>
learned fast. One of our high school friends also lives here in CT and<br/>
bought an extremely expensive home in a very well to do part of<br/>
Connecticut and owns his own business in NYC. Oh all before he was 30<br/>
too. Like me he left school early and just has a GED. Once more he is<br/>
really happy and has a small family of his own.<br/>
<br/>
The only one in our house at the moment talking jobs in my oldest,<br/>
Britt. She currently wants to be a Reiki master and teach yoga classes.<br/>
She knows she isnt going to make a milliion dollars doing this but she<br/>
thinks she will be happy doing this. I told her fine by me. And I am<br/>
currently trying to find a Reiki teacher for her. Actually we did find<br/>
one (two actually) who are willing to teach her. If she likes it<br/>
fine..if not fine. I am not that worried at the moment about college. We<br/>
will do whatever it takes to get in one if the kids decided to go. My<br/>
neighbor thinks I am nuts with this thinking. But then I think he is<br/>
nuts for spending over $100,000 to send a kid to college up in Boston<br/>
that dropped out because he never wanted to go in the first place. I<br/>
think I am more concerned with the happiness end of success than the<br/>
finanacial though I do hope my children will be finacially secure enough<br/>
to take care of themselves. I just belive that if your happy in what you<br/>
do you will be successful.<br/>
<br/>
Ok this is far longer than I had imagined posting. Sorry about that. I<br/>
have not had my coffee yet this morning and the kids are still sleeping.<br/>
Thank for listening to me and I look forward to getting to know you all.<br/>
<br/>

Namaste,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594616143">Thanks for writing Shelley....I enjoyed reading it...I am a two year <br/>
newbie, still uncertain after having to pull mine out of 6th and 2nd for <br/>
mental health reasons.  I agree with what you say and just keep my fingers <br/>
crossed that all will turn out well.  I figure my fall back position is the <br/>
fact that a motivated young person can learn anything in a short amount of <br/>
time!  Even if it takes &#39;till they&#39;re 18!<br/>

Honestly I keep focusing on stories I hear from other parents and what I read on kids that did learn a large amount when they wanted to or when they found they needed it. I am lucky too I live in a state with really no requirements either so I don&#39;t have anyone to answer too either.  But I do know kids who were not great writers and couldn&#39;t do certain things at age 14 have it hit them they want to this or that and suddenly want to learn and pick it all up.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is keeping that voice of doubt that goes off in my head quiet. *L* Like I said I need those stories and inspiration like  they are a broom to beat the doubt down.  My 7 year old  (Cody) has never been to school and honestly is unschooled , always has been just it didn&#39;t hit me till a little while ago. I have trouble with my 9 year old (Chelsea) with reading. Cody asked shortly after he turned 6 if I was going to teach him to read. I asked if he was<br/>
sure and he said yes and to my surprise picked it up fast. I am glad he did as I thought I did something wrong with Chelsea and was thinking what a horrible mother I was for not being able to teach her to read. Now I see she will blossom in her own time. Actually I have discovered she can read...just when she wants and what she wants.<br/>
