&gt;That&#39;s taking the analogy a bit far! Even adults who say they like a whack<br/>
&gt;up side the head don&#39;t litterally want a whack up side the head ;-) What<br/>
&gt;they are seeking is what they feel they need.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The words I used was &#39;whack upside the head with words&#39;. I meant with <br/>
words, not literally.<br/>
<br/>
So if a child asked you for the twentieth time &#39;why is the sky blue&#39;, <br/>
would you say &#39;it reflects from the sky/atmosphere, but you KNEW that&#39; or <br/>
would you just answer the question yet again.<br/>
<br/>
I know I would answer the question again, because sometimes the reason <br/>
why the kid is asking again isn&#39;t as aparent as the answer they are <br/>
seeking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We *can&#39;t* expect a group to be what we need. The most productive groups are<br/>
&gt;specialized. (As a mother is specialized to her child.) So our<br/>
&gt;responsibility isn&#39;t to demand that the group change when a group is meeting<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s own internal needs and not ours but to find a group that already meets<br/>
&gt;our own specialized needs.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So do you suggest that this list splits into the &#39;bluntunschooling.com&#39; <br/>
and to the &#39;politeunschooling.com&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
*disclaimer* I&#39;m not saying that blunt isn&#39;t polite, but I&#39;m at a loss <br/>
for words right now.<br/>
<br/>
Would that then specialize the two different POV the group has?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you suggest that the different people just keep posting with their <br/>
posting style and the smaller or more timid voices don&#39;t chime in?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just trying to think this through outloud in regards to the whole <br/>
situation. Maybe if you outline how you think it should be I can put it <br/>
all in perspective?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;If we expect any group to be other than what it is trying to be, who&#39;s at<br/>
&gt;fault, us or the group?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been involved with a group of parents here in my area that are <br/>
trying to get a democratic school going. We had a three day trial last <br/>
week and it was a great success. 12 kids and various parents and <br/>
&#39;teachers&#39;. What was interesting was the time when one of the kids said <br/>
they hated the meetings and wanted everyone to just say their piece. One <br/>
of the adults pointed out about how then only the people who are more <br/>
assertive get heard, and the quiet ones will naturally tend to not speak <br/>
up. The democratic process allowed even the 4 year olds with the shyest <br/>
personalitys get their voice out there.<br/>
<br/>
It was amazing to see how some of the little ones or very shy ones were <br/>
so involved by the 2nd day and they were out their with their ideas by <br/>
the 3rd. Some of the ideas were awesome and from an fresh POV.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine how it would of been if we just let the loud voices talk with <br/>
their already solidified viewpoints?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If someone&#39;s goal is to provide a place where specialized needs are met,<br/>
&gt;should they compromise meeting those needs for the sake of meeting the needs<br/>
&gt;of more people *just* because people arrive expecting their own needs to be<br/>
&gt;met?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good question Joyce. Maybe the list owner/ originator would jump in on <br/>
this and let us know what vision she had. Then maybe we can keep that in <br/>
mind when issues arise and it will keep in more in perspective.<br/>
<br/>
If she had a clearcut vision of how it runs then we can all benefit. <br/>
<br/>
If she wanted a place for the experienced ones to talk about unschooling <br/>
and the newbies to like it or leave it, then it has strayed from that <br/>
vision.<br/>
<br/>
If she saw an organic type of list that evolves according to the members <br/>
at the moment, then it sounds like its humming along fine.<br/>
<br/>
This is definately a subject that I defer to the owner on and respect the <br/>
wishes of their vision.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think it&#39;s our expectations of everything being for everyone that are at<br/>
&gt;fault not what one particular list or person provides. Even this list where<br/>
&gt;parenting and unschooling ideas are examined isn&#39;t for everyone. Some people<br/>
&gt;*are* just looking for support and &quot;good job&quot; pats on the back for how far<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re progressing. They want to share without it being held up to public<br/>
&gt;scrutiny.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I haven&#39;t seen just pats on the back here, have you? I&#39;ve seen <br/>
members jump in and put everything up for scrutiny. Some people pat, some <br/>
people scrutinize. Some people ask a lot of questions to the poster so <br/>
they get their juices flowing. Its IS a group from what I see.<br/>
<br/>
Do you feel that since the end of November its turned into just a &#39;huggy&#39; <br/>
commiserating list?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And if someone wanted help questioning herself and wanted to reach a certain<br/>
&gt;point through examining her ideas, how far would she get on a purely<br/>
&gt;supportive list that told her she was doing great?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She wouldn&#39;t. But she also wouldn&#39;t get far if she unsubscribed or didn&#39;t <br/>
ask because the experts responding were rude and inpatient.<br/>
<br/>
I thought this list evolved into a balance of voices. Not just a <br/>
reflection of one voice.<br/>

many months and she it wasn&#39;t the type of thing she&#39;d do as a joke, I&#39;d try<br/>
to answer again in a different way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If a forum is trying to reach as many as possible then it needs a variety of<br/>
approaches because different people learn differently. One way will fall<br/>
flat but another ring the bell. Some people need their hand held. Some<br/>
people need information.<br/>
<br/>
One problem is sometimes someone expects her hand held and gets upset that<br/>
some want her to ask herself some deep questions. (Perhaps the exact<br/>
technique that the last new person appreciated!) I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s a<br/>
solution to that except for people learning to be sensitive to the words<br/>
they use. But people perceive things so differently so even the most<br/>
inoffensive post can rile someone up!<br/>
<br/>
The thing is that I don&#39;t think a list can remain about unschooling<br/>
*without* asking difficult questions and examining things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If she had a clearcut vision of how it runs then we can all benefit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s mentioned a number of times over the years that she trusts people to<br/>
be adults and work out their differences :-) She was rather bummed out about<br/>
having to have moderators. And she likes Sandra&#39;s style.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you feel that since the end of November its turned into just a &#39;huggy&#39;<br/>
&gt; commiserating list?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I feel that it has been kinder, but the opportunities to challege that<br/>
haven&#39;t come along. Until the past few days, that is. The way people<br/>
perceived as &quot;difficult&quot; have been reacted to, the list hasn&#39;t really come<br/>
through the test of gentler and kinder with flying colors. :-/ It&#39;s great to<br/>
be kinder to newbies, but how we handle disagreements and difficult posts is<br/>
a truer test.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, the list split in November when one person voluntarily left to start <br/>
another list after being exasperated during a challanging time.<br/>
<br/>
Now, with Sarah, it appears to have happened again.<br/>
