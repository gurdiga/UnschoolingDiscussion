&gt; Pat, some people don&#39;t want to hear what you have to say no matter <br/>
&gt; how good or true or sincere it is. The ones that act so hateful don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; deserve a minute&#39;s thought from you. *Nothing* you say or do will <br/>
&gt; change them; they have so much other baggage making them the way they <br/>
&gt; are that they need greater help than what either of us could offer, <br/>
&gt; ya know? Ya just chalk it up and keep going.<br/>
&gt; Merry Christmas all you listees ;-)<br/>

one giving me a hard time. I am ruining my child and her life. I moved far <br/>
away and I am an unschooler. She battered me on the phone a couple of weeks <br/>
ago and I hung up eventually. Finally I wrote an apology e-mail. She scathed <br/>
back I said a small bit to explain, she seethed back I stopped and wrote a <br/>
simple lets forget the fight e-mail. Finally she quit w/ a few digs and a no <br/>
phone calls till after the holidays. I am cold, calculating and insecure b/c <br/>
I won&#39;t discuss our choices. Discuss? Huh gets yelled at and cursed at is not <br/>
discussing. Thus I am cold. If I truly believed in what I was doing I&#39;d <br/>
&quot;discuss&quot; it. UGH!<br/>
<br/>
     I am sick of it. But she is my mother and I am her only child so I feel <br/>
obligated to make peace. I always do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500041364">{{Nicki}} ! That&#39;s the pits!  I also feel that obligation for some <br/>
reason.<br/>
ok.. so here&#39;s the plan. Next time she gets on our case, wants to <br/>
&quot;discuss&quot; it, whip out a John Holt book (or my favorite Real Lives by <br/>
Grace Lewellyn) and tell her the discussion will begin in one <br/>
week..AFTER she&#39;s finished reading the book :-) :-P *Maybe* then, <br/>
she&#39;ll either read it and learn or she&#39;ll stop the harassment. It <br/>
will at least put you in a position to have something *to* discuss <br/>
other than misled opinions about what you&#39;re doing ~or~ she won&#39;t <br/>
bring it up because she&#39;ll never take the time to learn about it.<br/>
Wishing you better success that I&#39;ve had!<br/>
