<div id="ygrps-yiv-730314595">Hi all,<br/>
It&#39;s been a few months since I had my anxiety phase regarding my 7.5 yo<br/>
lerning to read.  She said she wanted to learn so we got &#39;Teach You Child to<br/>

other HSers.  Well,  dd doesn&#39;t like the drill.<br/>
She argues and refuses to cooperate with lessons.  Because I think she needs<br/>
to be interested to get something out of it,  we&#39;ll put it away and try<br/>
again off and on,  picking up where we were.  And trying to do other reading<br/>
activities.<br/>
    Well,  for a few weeks she has shown little interest in working on<br/>
reading.  Last night we pulled out a very simple book (Pumpkin Pumkin),<br/>
which she could read well a year ago.  She couldn&#39;t to get past the second<br/>
word!  I&#39;m a little frustrated with what looks like serious regression here!<br/>
    the other part of what&#39;s going on here is that her friend,  7.25 yo,<br/>
visited last night and began talking about books she&#39;s reading for her<br/>
Accelerated reading program at school.  (This girl attended a VERY small<br/>
private school for 3 yrs,   which was a lot like a more formal HS program -<br/>
they used PACES).   Anyway,  my dd isn&#39;t even reading some of the simple<br/>
books!  Another PS neighbor keeps asking if she can read yet because he can<br/>
read some now.  He&#39;s a yr younger;  and his mother pressures him BIG time to<br/>

    So anyway,  I have this bright daughter,  who&#39;s always been<br/>
developmentally &#39;ahead&#39; in language skills.<br/>
    I know everyone says to be patient,  but I wonder if we should be doing<br/>
something else to encourage her reading.<br/>
    I guess I also think her unschooling will &#39;fly&#39;  once she&#39;s reading.<br/>

    On one hand I am having some of the same concerns you are. My 8yro seems <br/>
to have done a backslide in some areas from last year when he was in a <br/>
private school.<br/>
He can read and I do have him read to me daily but he acts as though he can&#39;t <br/>
write because he can&#39;t spell anything. His writing is usually very sloppy <br/>
also. I worry that because I&#39;m not pushing him in this area he will never <br/>
learn how to write well.<br/>
    OTOH my 11yro did not learn to read until he was 9. Today he reads very <br/>
well although he still doesn&#39;t want to read much.(or write) I read to both of <br/>
them daily. I had to listen to the questions and worried. He just was not <br/>
going to read until he wanted to. I could tell because he would just refuse <br/>
to even look at the book. He is still that way today and I have to be careful <br/>
about anything that looks contrived.  Don&#39;t know if this helps, but you&#39;re <br/>
not alone.<br/>

    I want to add that my son has excellent comprehension and remembers so <br/>
much of what I read to him. I think we all get so caught up in the what they <br/>
are supposed to do at a certain age thing that we miss what they can do. Out <br/>
of six, four of my boys had trouble learning to read. The school&#39;s never knew <br/>
what to do either so most of the pressure fell on us to do something. <br/>
    With the 11yro. I read and read to him and still do. Somehow the idea is <br/>
put across that if they can&#39;t so it for themselves it is not as valuable. I <br/>
once bought into this but not now. I still read to him and 8yro and will as <br/>
long as they will listen. <br/>
    In doing so I can expose them to books they might not read on their own. <br/>
I have direct input into what I want them to explore. So much learning takes <br/>
place while we read together. We discuss words, phrases, figure of speech, <br/>
implied meaning,etc. All of this is woven in painlessly. I can also read <br/>
above their reading level but within their listening level and I even stretch <br/>
that at times. I always stop reading something that they say they can&#39;t <br/>
follow. <br/>
    My son was telling me last night of a neighbor reading to her boys. I <br/>
told him I didn&#39;t know she read to them. (I know she wasn&#39;t before from <br/>
conversation) &quot;Oh, they copied off of us&quot; he told me. Made my day!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like she&#39;s feeling a bit of pressure too.   You have to assure her<br/>
that it will come in her own time. If she&#39;s picking up from you, that you<br/>
wish she could read and she can&#39;t...well, the only option for her is to feel<br/>
badly or scared.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree, when she&#39;s ready it will fly. I had one child memorizing and paying<br/>
attention to words and letters for years.. it didn&#39;t click until this<br/>
summer. He&#39;s 9.75, 10 in January.  I have another child who is 7.5 years<br/>
old... he doesn&#39;t even know all of the alphabet.   My dh says he can read<br/>
some words and even can sound out some things, but I&#39;ve never heard him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Breathing deeply....<br/>
 </span></blockquote> This is the smartest thing you can do. :)  Also, don&#39;t let those other<br/>
children talk about their reading without piping up about things your<br/>
daughter is doing that they are not. It will do both children a world of<br/>
good to hear that not everyone is the same and isn&#39;t it wonderful that both<br/>
of them can develop in the way that&#39;s best for them.<br/>
<br/>
I would also talk to her and ask if she&#39;s putting pressure on herself to get<br/>
this done. Is she reacting to the subtle (maybe not so subtle) idea that she<br/>
should really be getting it by now and something just might be wrong with<br/>
her???<br/>
<br/>
Tell us about the games you play together and maybe we can brainstorm new<br/>
things to expose her to. (I&#39;m late with this, you all might be well beyond<br/>
this.  I actually stayed off the computer for 15 straight hours. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119833151">Dear Suz,<br/>
<br/>
I know you&#39;ll probably get a number of responses to your posting, but I<br/>
wanted to step forward from my lurking position within this Listserv to<br/>
provide my support.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter underwent similar challenges with reading when she was your<br/>
daughter&#39;s age.  I trusted my instincts and also received confirmation from<br/>
helpful &quot;experts&quot; at that time.  I have ultimately learned that one of the<br/>
greatest gifts my daughter has received from homeschooling is not feeling<br/>
pressured or rushed to learn how to read.  As a teenager, she now loves to<br/>
awaken to new adventures and to life-long learning through this marvelous,<br/>
acquired skill.<br/>
<br/>
As with crawling, walking, talking, etc., each child is developmentally<br/>
ready to master certain skills when their brains (and other body parts!) are<br/>
ready.  Reading is a similar skill.  Before a child can read, s/he often<br/>
needs to perform larger movements with their body.  Some helpful exercises<br/>
that we did together in fun ways are:  (1) Have your dd write alphabet<br/>
letters, shapes, etc. with large, non-permanent chalk and markers (when<br/>
applicable) on big chalkboards, whiteboards, sidewalks, etc.  She can<br/>
imitate the letter(s) you draw, or create them on her own.  This involves<br/>
her large motor skills and the left-brain/right-brain connections are<br/>
eventually made with greater ease.  (2)  Fill a cookie sheet with a thin<br/>
layer of sand, salt, sugar, flour (or whatever!) and have her use her<br/>
finger(s) or utensils to draw alphabet letters (and eventually words) in the<br/>
tactile stuff.  (3)  You (or another loved one or friend) can draw letters,<br/>
etc. on your dd&#39;s back with an index or other finger and have her feel what<br/>
is being drawn.  Eventually, you can draw more letters, until short words<br/>
are spelled.  (4) Carving alphabet letters (or purchasing some from<br/>
teachers&#39; supplies stores) from sponges, sandpaper, or other textured<br/>
materials can be a fun, tactile activity.   Using cookie and other dough is<br/>
also helpful and creative.  These letters can be arranged to make small<br/>
words, etc.  (5)  Have your dd make her own books.  Collate paper and even<br/>
make covers with construction paper or other materials.  She can draw<br/>
pictures (illustrations) under which you add printed words, which are<br/>
dictated to you by her.  This can lead to having her draw the pictures and<br/>
dictate the wording, but having you draw dots for each letter, which she<br/>
fills in.  Rhyming books are especially helpful.  Kids seem to like the<br/>
cadence, etc.  It&#39;s also easier to re-read a rhyming piece.  &quot;Sam sat.  Sam<br/>
is a rat.&quot; was one of my dd&#39;s first projects.  She was so proud of her<br/>
efforts! &lt;nostalgic sigh&gt;  (6)  Do cross-crawl exercises (as described in<br/>
Brain Gym and other helpful books and resources).  Sometimes, when a child<br/>
has been held, carried, etc. as an infant, they do not master the usual<br/>
crawling technique which actually integrates right- and left-brain<br/>
hemispheres.  (7)  Read, read, read to your dd!  She&#39;ll learn this wonderful<br/>
skill just by sitting close to you and hearing treasured stories.  (I was<br/>
taught in public school not to run my finger under each word as I read.<br/>
Wrong!  This is sometimes a very helpful tool that assists our children in<br/>
learning to read by sounding out each letter and connecting them to make a<br/>
word.)<br/>
<br/>
I know that others can provide additional hints and strategies.  It&#39;s late,<br/>
and I&#39;m probably leaving out some of the activities that we did, but please<br/>
remember that kids do pick up on our frustrations, fears, etc.  We obviously<br/>
don&#39;t want reading to have any negative associations.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter became developmentally ready to read when she was about 9 years<br/>
old.  For some children (especially boys, I&#39;m told), reading readiness<br/>
doesn&#39;t occur until they&#39;re even 10 or older!  The interesting result in my<br/>
own dd&#39;s situation is that when her reading skills &quot;kicked in,&quot; she was in<br/>
what would be 4th grade, but she actually whipped through early readers and,<br/>
in a matter of months, was reading books that were of high school level and<br/>
beyond!  She had seen the Jodie Foster movie, &quot;Contact&quot;, and became<br/>
interested in quantum and astro-physics.  She began to read books on these<br/>
subjects and communicated by e-mail with a scientist and professor at MIT.<br/>
What an accomplishment for someone who seemingly struggled with this skill<br/>
for so many years!  Just the other day, my dd shared with me that reading<br/>
has opened up so many doors to learning for her.  She loves to read and<br/>
reads so well!<br/>
<br/>
Suz, I couldn&#39;t decide whether I should send this response to you directly<br/>
or post it to the general readership of this Unschooling Listserv.  I<br/>
finally thought that others might benefit from our family&#39;s experience, so I<br/>
hope you&#39;ll understand that I&#39;m sending this very public posting in response<br/>
to your very personal situation.  I truly hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Linda Davis<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-983291810">I think that what you wrote Linda should be required &quot;reading&quot; for every<br/>
&quot;school&quot; teacher.  Maybe then, they would &quot;leave them kids alone&quot; instead of<br/>
poisoning them with the artificial, toxic &quot;one size fits nobody&quot; model that<br/>
schools have followed, to everyone&#39;s detriment, for years.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting it to the list.  It goes into my &quot;early reading folder&quot; for<br/>

&gt; I know you&#39;ll probably get a number of responses to your posting, but I<br/>
&gt; wanted to step forward from my lurking position within this Listserv to<br/>
&gt; provide my support.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My daughter underwent similar challenges with reading when she was your<br/>
&gt; daughter&#39;s age.  I trusted my instincts and also received confirmation from<br/>
&gt; helpful &quot;experts&quot; at that time.  I have ultimately learned that one of the<br/>
&gt; greatest gifts my daughter has received from homeschooling is not feeling<br/>
&gt; pressured or rushed to learn how to read. &lt;snip&gt;My daughter became<br/>
&gt; developmentally ready to read when she was about 9 years<br/>
&gt; old.  For some children (especially boys, I&#39;m told), reading readiness<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t occur until they&#39;re even 10 or older! &lt;snip&gt; Sincerely,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70023781">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Linda wrote a lot of good ideas, so I&#39;ll just add a few more from my past as<br/>
an adult literacy educator.  (I&#39;m sure hoping that I haven&#39;t missed any<br/>
posts on this topic in which the suggestions below were brought up--if so,<br/>
please excuse my shoddy groping through my 200 or so e-mails a day [I&#39;m a<br/>
listserv pack rat])...<br/>
<br/>
And be warned: my bias is whole language: I fully believe that building on<br/>
strengths moving from the meaningful whole to the component part is the most<br/>
affirming, constructive way to learn--well, anything, reading included.  So<br/>
letters don&#39;t precede words--meaning comes first, with the components coming<br/>
on that foundation.<br/>
<br/>
First thing I&#39;d say: packaged curricula can be de facto intimidating,<br/>
because it&#39;s like looking up a 12 foot wall, even if there are footholds at<br/>
each step.  You still know that *someone* expects you to get *this* far at<br/>
some point.  It also doesn&#39;t necessarily relate to the learner&#39;s life, and<br/>
we all know how being forced to read particular stuff can irritate you and<br/>
turn you off.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, a classic early activity for learners who have basically no<br/>
connection to print at all is called &quot;Language experience&quot;.  The idea is<br/>
that it&#39;s easiest to read something that *you* wrote, that is directly<br/>
meaningful text generated by *you*.  Further, you break down into the<br/>
*tiniest* steps possible, the distance between her experience and the<br/>
written word.  Between living and reading and writing.  BTW, what Linda<br/>
suggested about drawing illustrations and then dictating captions is a<br/>
smaller, word-by-word version of this.  (My own bias about what&#39;s called<br/>
&quot;whole-word&quot;:  it&#39;s better than straight bottom-up phonics, but it&#39;s still<br/>
words out of context.  Communicating meaning is what reading is about,<br/>
ultimately, not recognizing words.  So begin with the purpose of<br/>
reading--real meaning--and go from there.  Again, this is my personal<br/>
professional perspective.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll only generally outline the process--if this is not repetitive and<br/>
you&#39;re interested, I could fill you in on details and fine points...So you<br/>
can sit and talk with your daughter about something and then ask if you can<br/>
write one sentence of what she just said.  For instance: &quot;We picked apples<br/>
today.&quot;  A short sentence is good.  Then you can read it back to her.  Maybe<br/>
twice.  Pointing at the words.  Then you can start shadow reading it with<br/>
her--she kind of whispers while you read along.  Gradually, over many<br/>
repetitions, you can fade out and she can take over.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s memorization.  If you look at it, that&#39;s what reading is--it&#39;s<br/>
just so highlighted here because the process is broken down into its bare<br/>
bones.  But that&#39;s the first step.  And these words are *hers*.<br/>
<br/>
Once she can read the sentence all by herself (which is a cool thing!), you<br/>
can move from the meaningful whole to the component parts.  You can ask her<br/>
what particular words are in the sentence.  I&#39;d start with first and last<br/>
words, then move to meaningful words e.g. apples or picked.<br/>
<br/>
Periodically, let her go back and read it all together to keep the meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Then you can improvise--if she wants to learn the words even more out of<br/>
context, you can write a few of them on cards and she can identify them,<br/>
like flash cards except they&#39;re *her* words.  And make sure to write the<br/>
whole sentence on the other side of the card, with the relevant word<br/>
underlined.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants to add more to her story, you can add another sentence.  It<br/>
could get quite long, if you all want.  And before you know it, she&#39;s<br/>
written a piece about a significant event in her life that she can read and<br/>
control forever.<br/>
<br/>
You can break down to component parts even more, e.g. sounds of consonants<br/>
and vowels (always in combination)...but I won&#39;t bother with that right now,<br/>
because I don&#39;t even know if this is interesting to you.<br/>
<br/>
People in the programs I worked in would do language experiences for months.<br/>
Not the same one, but the same basic process.   It was totally emotionally<br/>
rewarding to watch people who had never thought their lives related in any<br/>
way to a written narrative put experiences they wanted to document down on<br/>
paper  (there were plenty of experiences they didn&#39;t want to document, of<br/>
course--but that&#39;s another story).  It&#39;s a tremendously empowering thing.<br/>
Anyway, *Then*, later, when your daughter feels like it, and feels some<br/>
control over words and patterns and such, she can move to other people&#39;s<br/>
writing.  Maybe *your* writing about experiences she knows about.  That<br/>
would be a wonderful next bridge.  Just off the top of my head, I envision<br/>
something like &quot;The sun shone on my daughter&#39;s hair&quot; as a companion story to<br/>
the apple-picking.<br/>
<br/>
If the process to other people&#39;s experiences and thoughts is rushed at all,<br/>
you can break the fragile connection between written symbols and meaning<br/>
that your daughter&#39;s trying to build.  Just glory in the connection of oral<br/>
and written narration or description.  It&#39;s phenomenal.  (Do you think I<br/>
miss my work? :))  If you feel like something is too much of a stretch, you<br/>
can go back and find the solid foundation under your feet.  That&#39;s the<br/>
beauty of this methodology.   There&#39;s always solid meaning to fall back on.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d offer this idea.  If it&#39;s helpful or you want more<br/>
information on this or other ideas, I&#39;d be totally willing.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, and please, from someone who&#39;s worked with adult basic ed<br/>
learners who are sometimes quite accomplished in their fields, sometimes<br/>
owners of businesses, etc.: it&#39;s no sign of a lack of &quot;intelligence&quot; or<br/>
s.l.t.  It will come.  Just build on what&#39;s meaningful to her.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and please continue to post about your all&#39;s experiences,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m assuming, Joel, that you were referring to what I wrote as<br/>
generalization.  And that I was implying that this was *the* way to go, as a<br/>
Fact.  Insofar as any comment or suggestion would be a generalization, I<br/>
guess you&#39;re right, but I certainly didn&#39;t think of it as one.  In fact<br/>
quite the opposite--did you miss where I said &quot;this is my bias&quot;, &quot;this is my<br/>
personal professional bias&quot; etc.  several times and that I was just offering<br/>
one more idea?<br/>
<br/>
Or was it the theoretical discussion that upset you?  I was offering, as I<br/>
understood it, another suggestion for things to do (in a long line of things<br/>
to do) in response to a post by a mother who was asking on behalf of a child<br/>
who wants to learn to read.  I did include a fair bit of theoretical frame<br/>
around it because I hadn&#39;t seen mentioned any approach that started with<br/>
meaningful units of more than one word rather than letters or a word and I<br/>
thought maybe the idea needed some introduction.  Actually, I was trying to<br/>
*counter* the implicit theoretical &quot;generalization&quot; that learning reading<br/>
happened by learning letters first (except for the whole word idea) that<br/>
seemed to apply in people&#39;s suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t think of reading as making meaning even at the emergent<br/>
stages because we&#39;re so schooled to think of it as intrinsically bottom-up,<br/>
phonics and such.  The bottom-up model (and the associated politics and<br/>
interpersonal dynamics--building on perceived lack of knowledge of a set<br/>
body of knowledge rather than on strengths and interests) is actually a<br/>
recent product of the industrial age, and some learners can work with it,<br/>
while other learners can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Or was it the step-by-step process I described?  I could have just said &quot;you<br/>
can write what your daughter says and it can be another thing for her to<br/>
read if she wants&quot; but broke down the process because it seemed that it<br/>
might be unfamiliar and people would want to be able to envision *one* way<br/>
it might go.  If one were to break down the process of writing letters in<br/>
the mud, I suspect it might look like a step-by-step process as well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be the first to say flexibility and following a learner&#39;s lead including<br/>
keeping out of their way is an utterly necessary factor not only in reading,<br/>
but in all learning.<br/>
<br/>
Since the learner was rebelling against a set curriculum, being prepared to<br/>
do the kind of stuff I was talking about instead seemed like a good thing to<br/>
have ready if it ever came up.  The poster didn&#39;t seem to have this kind of<br/>
tool in her toolbox (please forgive me if I was wrong, but ordering &quot;Teach<br/>
your child to read in 100 easy lessons&quot; seems very much further away from<br/>
unschooling than having a way to help a kid translate her/his experiences<br/>
into written, readable text.)<br/>
<br/>
So sorry if it was unhelpful or seemed offensive.  I offered it in a spirit<br/>
of one more idea to try, and why to think about trying it when other things<br/>
seemed to have failed.  People can always delete! :)<br/>

Sorry if I sounded offended.... I wasn&#39;t.  I was a touch piqued but by what<br/>
precisely I couldn&#39;t say now.  I meant pretty much what I said and not a whole<br/>
lot more.  I wasn&#39;t upset particularly.<br/>
<br/>
My apologies if I was inattentive or too off-hand.  I didn&#39;t really think you<br/>
had committed a transgression.  I don&#39;t think we disagree terribly when I reread<br/>
your current post.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry if I trod on toes.  I confess to feeling a bit snarly.<br/>
<br/>
I am, however good with the delete key or I would go nuts....nuttier.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I am increasingly convinced that left to their own devices, if there are<br/>
&gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt;people around them, children will come up with the method that works best<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt;them..... be that phonics, whole word, writing in the mud, copying letters<br/>
&gt; &gt;before they know the alphabet, etc. etc. et. al. They come equipped with<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt;mental apparatus to figure it out.  Keep out of their way and offer<br/>
&gt; assistance<br/>
&gt; &gt;when it is asked for in the amount it is asked for.  The variety of people<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt;learning styles makes generalization very risky at best and is always made<br/>
&gt; &gt;useless for the many outside the generalization.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m assuming, Joel, that you were referring to what I wrote as<br/>
&gt; generalization.  And that I was implying that this was *the* way to go, as a<br/>
&gt; Fact.  Insofar as any comment or suggestion would be a generalization, I<br/>
&gt; guess you&#39;re right, but I certainly didn&#39;t think of it as one.  In fact<br/>
&gt; quite the opposite--did you miss where I said &quot;this is my bias&quot;, &quot;this is my<br/>
&gt; personal professional bias&quot; etc.  several times and that I was just offering<br/>
&gt; one more idea?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or was it the theoretical discussion that upset you?  I was offering, as I<br/>
&gt; understood it, another suggestion for things to do (in a long line of things<br/>
&gt; to do) in response to a post by a mother who was asking on behalf of a child<br/>
&gt; who wants to learn to read.  I did include a fair bit of theoretical frame<br/>
&gt; around it because I hadn&#39;t seen mentioned any approach that started with<br/>
&gt; meaningful units of more than one word rather than letters or a word and I<br/>
&gt; thought maybe the idea needed some introduction.  Actually, I was trying to<br/>
&gt; *counter* the implicit theoretical &quot;generalization&quot; that learning reading<br/>
&gt; happened by learning letters first (except for the whole word idea) that<br/>
&gt; seemed to apply in people&#39;s suggestions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people don&#39;t think of reading as making meaning even at the emergent<br/>
&gt; stages because we&#39;re so schooled to think of it as intrinsically bottom-up,<br/>
&gt; phonics and such.  The bottom-up model (and the associated politics and<br/>
&gt; interpersonal dynamics--building on perceived lack of knowledge of a set<br/>
&gt; body of knowledge rather than on strengths and interests) is actually a<br/>
&gt; recent product of the industrial age, and some learners can work with it,<br/>
&gt; while other learners can&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Or was it the step-by-step process I described?  I could have just said &quot;you<br/>
&gt; can write what your daughter says and it can be another thing for her to<br/>
&gt; read if she wants&quot; but broke down the process because it seemed that it<br/>
&gt; might be unfamiliar and people would want to be able to envision *one* way<br/>
&gt; it might go.  If one were to break down the process of writing letters in<br/>
&gt; the mud, I suspect it might look like a step-by-step process as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d be the first to say flexibility and following a learner&#39;s lead including<br/>
&gt; keeping out of their way is an utterly necessary factor not only in reading,<br/>
&gt; but in all learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since the learner was rebelling against a set curriculum, being prepared to<br/>
&gt; do the kind of stuff I was talking about instead seemed like a good thing to<br/>
&gt; have ready if it ever came up.  The poster didn&#39;t seem to have this kind of<br/>
&gt; tool in her toolbox (please forgive me if I was wrong, but ordering &quot;Teach<br/>
&gt; your child to read in 100 easy lessons&quot; seems very much further away from<br/>
&gt; unschooling than having a way to help a kid translate her/his experiences<br/>
&gt; into written, readable text.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So sorry if it was unhelpful or seemed offensive.  I offered it in a spirit<br/>
&gt; of one more idea to try, and why to think about trying it when other things<br/>
&gt; seemed to have failed.  People can always delete! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762276681">My brother did not learn to read until he was over 9.  I remember many<br/>
nights with he and my mother both in tears as they sat at the dining room<br/>
table trying to force him to learn to read.  Finally, that summer while we<br/>
were on the highway headed somewhere for vacation and my dad was reading us<br/>
&quot;Last of the Mohicans.&quot;  He handed the book to my brother at a climactic<br/>
scene and said &quot;I&#39;m tired, you read for a while.&quot;  So he did!  <br/>
<br/>
To this day my dad is still &quot;proud&quot; of that and tells that story.  I find<br/>
it interesting, and sad, that he can feel justified claiming the credit for<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; my brother to read, when my brother so obviously did it himself.<br/>
 Despite all the school&#39;s efforts, and my mother&#39;s as well, to force him to<br/>
read, pidgeon-holing him and catagorizing him as a slow reader/learner or<br/>
whatever, he STILL learned to read all by himself when HE was ready.  <br/>
<br/>
I distinctly remember the whole process and all of the emotion involved for<br/>
everyone.  Even as a small child I remember keeping a low profile and not<br/>
reminding him of the fact that I (his year younger sister) was reading at<br/>
4.  It was just too obvious how painful the whole process was for him, and<br/>
sibling rivalry just flew out the window.  It makes me wonder how my<br/>
parents could NOT have seen the obvious.  That they should just back off as<br/>
well, and that torturing him did not help the issue at all.<br/>
<br/>
Now he is a very technically skilled reader with a voracious literary<br/>
appetite.  He reads very complicated Science Fiction, History, etc for fun<br/>
and finds it not the least challenging.  If that is not a story of<br/>
perserverence and overcoming being labeled, I don&#39;t what is.  7 - 8 even 9<br/>
- 10 are not &quot;late&quot; readers.  They are just so busy being precocious in<br/>
other areas that they do not have the time or the interest in learning to<br/>
read, and should not be made to feel less for that.  My brother has always<br/>
been very mechanically oriented and loved to take things apart.  He ended<br/>
up doing four years in the Navy as an electronics technician for Viking<br/>
jets, and is now beginning to study engineering, with a side interest (and<br/>
lots of knowledge) in computers.<br/>
<br/>
Have faith.  When they are ready and have a &quot;real&quot; need to read (not a<br/>
percived or imposed need) they will.<br/>

<br/>
    My sisters daughters always talked before my boys. Mine did not talk well <br/>
until they were 2 1/2-3. Potty trained late, all were almost 3. However many <br/>
are gifted in different ways and they all have superb physical skills. Most <br/>
road a 2 wheel bike with no training wheels by 3. The youngest has been a <br/>
whiz at every thing. He could rollerblade at 3 and taught himself using one <br/>
of older bros. skates. He snow skied at 5. He has been able to dribble a <br/>
basketball since he was 3 etc. Kids have all kinds of gifts, some are just <br/>
more respected than others.<br/>
    The son who could not read until late has built the whole star wars fleet <br/>
with cardboard and tape. These ships are impressive. He can draw and build <br/>
most anything. I&#39;m not saying any of this to brag. Only to emphasize that we <br/>
must see all of our kids talents and that they won&#39;t always fit into what <br/>
society thinks valuable.<br/>

    My brother told me several years ago that he finally learned to read <br/>
after I said to him one day &quot;Bill each of these letters have a sound and the <br/>
sound is always the same, they don&#39;t change every time you read them&quot; Mind <br/>
you I was only about 11 or 12 so my lesson was brief. He told me that no one <br/>
had ever told him that before and after that he was able to figure it out.<br/>

<br/>
No offense taken.  Mook is almost three and has no intention of going<br/>
near the toilet any time soon.  (And no, I&#39;m not worried, but everyone<br/>
else seems to be...)  I think each person learns what they want to learn<br/>
at whatever age they want to learn it.  He talked early, but he wasn&#39;t<br/>
walking until almost a year and a half.  He knows when he needs practice<br/>
at something - not me.  Sometimes he&#39;ll just come up to me and say,<br/>
&quot;Mom, let&#39;s talk in English.&quot;  OK, I guess he feels he needs practice<br/>
speaking English.  He just knows.  I imagine every kid just knows. <br/>
That&#39;s probably why some kids are &quot;problem&quot; kids in school.  They know<br/>
that they don&#39;t need practice at what the teacher is trying to teach<br/>
them.  Jets or bugs or whatever are just more important to them at that<br/>
time.  Maybe they already know what is being taught (or don&#39;t need to<br/>
know right now), and want to explore the real world.  <br/>
<br/>
I loved that John Holt&#39;s book How Children Learn.  I finally made it<br/>
through, and then reread it.  It was slow going for me at first, but I<br/>
found I agreed with almost everything he said.  (Which is unusual for me<br/>
- I rarely agree with half of what I read or hear - hope that didn&#39;t<br/>
offend anybody...)  If we just trust our kids, they&#39;ll learn what they<br/>
need to learn.  (Now I feel like I&#39;m preaching...)<br/>
