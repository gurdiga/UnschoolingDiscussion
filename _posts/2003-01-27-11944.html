<div id="ygrps-yiv-126642293">Thank you all for your imput. You all gave me a lot to think about <br/>
and that is always helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
Well you know what they say about the best laid plans.  My dd. <br/>
changed them and as it turns out that was for the best.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd. Elaine decided (unknown to me) that she would call her friend <br/>
and let her know that if her father was there she would not come over <br/>
or stay the night. Her friend asked, why? Elaine said I do not want <br/>
to talk about it now. Then asked her friend to come over, she said no <br/>
and hung up.  <br/>
<br/>
Ok, at this time I had a house with guest and strange dogs unsure of <br/>
each other and my phone rings.  I answer it.  &quot;Hi, Carol (my real <br/>
name) this is S. my dd. is upstairs crying, she is mad at me and told <br/>
me I ruined every thing and your dd. is afraid to come over here if I <br/>
am here and she won&#39;t stay the night.  Ummm, did I do something <br/>
wrong?&quot;  WHOA! Let me find a quite room to talk. (Everyone was well <br/>
fed and busy with the dogs or game).<br/>
<br/>
Let me say, that this man is not one of my favorite neighbors, but he <br/>
is not some kind of monster either.  He is a man that most people <br/>
would like. His children are not trouble makers and he is doing the <br/>
best he, at this point, knows how.  I do disagree SRONGLY with is <br/>
parenting philosophy.  I am not sure if he really knows what his <br/>
philosopy is, he just wants to have *good kids*.<br/>
<br/>
After I explained to him what Elaine had said happened he offered an <br/>
apology and his side of the story. Which really opened up the <br/>
conversation to parenting. He asked genuine questions and really <br/>
wanted anwsers.  When I was able to give him real examples, from what <br/>
he said, why he is the source of some of the problems he listened and <br/>
had great questions.  <br/>
<br/>
So in the end he said how do I fix this with you dd.  I told him <br/>
honestly she was uncomfortable with him and did not want to be there <br/>
if he was there. He respected that.  Maybe, hopefully, in the future <br/>
Elaine will feel better and that will change, but I think if Elaine <br/>
does go over it will be only if the wife is home.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that was really bothering me, and I told him, and he was <br/>
suprised, because he never actually thought about it, is the fact <br/>
that my dd. is a girl and a child, she needs to KNOW that she has the <br/>
right to say to ANYONE that touches her in a way that makes her <br/>
uncomfortable STOP! He understood because he has three children and <br/>
two are daughters.  I think this helped him to see another point of <br/>
view.<br/>
<br/>
Heidi, thank you you had some great points.  I will most definetly do <br/>
this&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
* leave him a copy of &#39;how to talk to kids so they listen and listen <br/>
so <br/>
they&#39;ll talk&quot; by that Adelle Faber woman. Free for him.*<br/>
 <br/>
And a copy of &quot;Whole Child/Whole Parent&quot; by Polly Berrien Breends.<br/>
<br/>
 I think he will read them.<br/>

verbalized how she felt and that she was uncomfortable being around the <br/>
father and wouldn&#39;t put herself in that situation.<br/>

things for the one child, and the other one will still play except around<br/>
the dad.  If he really did listen, and changes because of it, then<br/>
everybody&#39;s going to win.<br/>

Absolutely true.  I wish it could have happened without tears.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little I cried enough for a dozen little girls.  The more who can <br/>
be spared from here on out the better.<br/>
