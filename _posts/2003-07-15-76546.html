<div id="ygrps-yiv-316729144">Hi there,<br/>
We went to a Pow Wow event this weekend and I have some questions/concerns/comments.  First I would like to say that I had a VERY emotional reaction to the people in traditional (ceremonial) costume.  It was very intense...visceral.  I felt a connection that was tangible.  ( I am supposed to have a not too distant Native American ancestor but we have not been able to find her...yet)  They were/are beautiful.  Really, the words escape me.  Anyway, at the start they had a parade with the American flag and then a prayer ( God/Jesus etc).  It made me ill.  Now I will qualify that I have no problems with the Christian religion (at its purest) and attend a church (whose motto involves respect for other paths to God).  And I certainly love my county (for better or for worst...the good, bad and the ugly etc.)  What did bother me was this just seemed WRONG!!! (both the flag and the prayer).  Now here is the question.  Is this common?  Is there a certain place or certain groups that do not do this.  Is there anywhere in the Eastern region where one (who is not a member of a tribe ) can attend an event that is not adulterated (sorry this is how I feel ) by white culture.  <br/>
Thanks for any input,<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s common in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Another common particularly Indian activity here is Indian Rodeo, and all <br/>
rodeos are flag-waving situations.<br/>

PowWows are not in any way unadulterated activities.  They&#39;ve taken a word <br/>
which had another particular meaning and created a kind of all-new activity and <br/>
called it &quot;Pow Wow.&quot;  When they have a Pow Wow in Gallup, New Mexico, <br/>
organized probably by Navajos, that&#39;s not a Navajo word.  When they have one in Taos <br/>
(with a forest fire in the background) that&#39;s not a Tiwa word.<br/>
<br/>
Ever since the first &quot;pow wows&quot; which were dance programs and money-making <br/>
opportunities to attract tourists and which eventually became reunion events in <br/>
large part for the people who had been going for years, those participating <br/>
were Americans, and lots of the people old enough to have begun those things (in <br/>
New Mexico and Arizona) were WWII veterans who WERE patriotic.<br/>
<br/>
To strip a pow wow of those things wouldn&#39;t be to make it &quot;more authentic,&quot; <br/>
but to move it another step from what it is.<br/>
