<div id="ygrps-yiv-534302846">The discussion about the 8yo signing his name brought up a recent event <br/>
in our family.  Last June, my 15yo dd past her driver&#39;s test (on the <br/>
first try!) and was told when she signed the legal document that she <br/>
had to resign and write in cursive.  She was so nervous about the whole <br/>
situation that she almost told them to shove it!  Instead, she signed <br/>
and went on.  At that time, it got me to thinking about times in our <br/>
lives when folks are going to want a SIGNATURE, pretty or not.  <br/>
Eventually, your son will have to develop some form of identity, just <br/>
like my dd, just like Kirby.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1908296092">It is perfectly legal in most instances (Homeland Insecurity may have<br/>
created some exceptions) for a person to simply make &quot;their mark&quot;  on<br/>
official documents.     That said,  I have seen these individual power trip<br/>
demands about &quot;signature=cursive&quot;.     Even with adults .....e.g.  new<br/>
tellers at a bank wanting the signature on a check to be two names written<br/>
in pretty cursive.     Where I come from  I would wager that the majority of<br/>
adult &quot;signatures&quot;  are NOT in cursive.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A few years ago I tangled with the director of  a large umbrella soccer<br/>
association who was holding a meeting with club registrars and was insisting<br/>
that the player ID  cards required a  players signature (&quot;and that means<br/>
cursive&quot;).     Her view was that player cards were usually for children at<br/>
least 9 years old and they &quot;should&quot;  know cursive by then.    &quot;Just tell<br/>
them they have  to put both names and in cursive&quot;.    I argued with her<br/>
about BOTH  &quot;her&quot;  requirements for a signature and suggested it was<br/>
inappropriate for her to be dispensing such erroneous information.     It&#39;s<br/>
how urban myths get started.  Bear in mind she wanted kids to be &quot;signing&quot;<br/>
names that might be completely different from the names they used in day to<br/>
day life.    Made me think of 80 years ago and schoolteachers who decided<br/>
what names were &quot;proper&quot;  regardless of what might be on the birth<br/>
certificate!     <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Using a &quot;legal&quot;  name these days for official documents  (in the spaces<br/>
where they say &quot;type or print legibly&quot;) is one thing.  The whole point of a<br/>
&quot;signature&quot;  is  to be unique to the person.    In my years I have seen a<br/>
variety of signatures that bore little to no resemblance to the the full<br/>
legal name written in any of the standard cursive styles.     Time was,  the<br/>
recommendation was to avoid the  &quot;schoolteacher hand&quot;  for a signature so<br/>
that it would be more difficult to forge.   Times change. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the legal precedents are probably very varied!!<br/>
<br/>
When they say &quot;sign&quot; your name, that comes from a thousand years ago,  <br/>
and a few centuries on either side, when people made an x... only it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t an X, it was the sign of the cross.   It was a cross, made as  <br/>
an oath that you attested to what the document said in the name of  <br/>
God.  So &quot;signature&quot; is like a legally binding oath to stand by,  <br/>
abide by, the words in that document.  When you &quot;gave your word&quot; you  <br/>
were giving your word to and by God.<br/>
<br/>
When people are quadraplegic or otherwise unable to sign, they &quot;sign&quot;  <br/>
in front of a witness by putting a mark if they can or touching the  <br/>
thing (I think that probably varies from state to county too, because  <br/>
there is not as far as I  know any federal ruling on it, unless it  <br/>
has to do with tax returns).  My friend Mary Ann who&#39;s quadraplegic  <br/>
signed checks with an X.  Now I guess she just uses paypal and debit  <br/>
cards.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692149692">Thanks for reminding me. My ds is soon to sit his test for his next <br/>
level of driving license (here in NZ they have to sit 3 tests over a <br/>
period of time) and the first time he was upset by not having a <br/>
signature too. So I meant to remind him to start practicing well <br/>
beforehand so it flows easily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070908843">I still have a horrible time making legible handwriting.  I developed<br/>
a signature composed of cursived print or printed cursive.  In your<br/>
daughter&#39;s case I may have been tempted to sign in printed curses.. ;)<br/>
 Nah not really.  My signature is print letters and, depending on the<br/>
order and where the letters join, they may be capital or lower case. <br/>
I can&#39;t remember exactly when but I was about 25 or maybe older when I<br/>
got it figured out to my satisfaction.  One thing about having a<br/>
signature like that is I occasionally get prior warning when a<br/>
beauricrat is going to be difficult.  <br/>
