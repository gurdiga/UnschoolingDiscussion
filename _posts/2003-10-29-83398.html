<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962845029">***One Mom actually said (no joke) that she let her 9 or 10 yr. old child<br/>
play <br/>
video games for one day and he pooped and peed himself and sat in it all<br/>
day <br/>
then she dragged him out of the room kicking and screaming.. I am still<br/>
beside <br/>
my self on that one. How is this possible one and two how could anyone be<br/>
<br/>
comfortable writing it as an anti-video game defense? ***<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t even understand how desperate she has made him feel.   He<br/>
didn&#39;t mess himself because the game had power over him, he knew he&#39;d<br/>
never get another chance to play and it was worth it to him to get in<br/>
every minute.  It&#39;s *her* power she should be worried about.  Poor little<br/>
dude. <br/>
<br/>
***There are maybe 2 or 3 of us on this list of 200 that Unschool what<br/>
does one <br/>
say to this as a minority on a list? ***<br/>
<br/>
You probably risk getting booted off the list if you&#39;re really vocal. <br/>
Links, maybe.  Links to anti spanking web sites, gentle parenting,<br/>
articles supporting your position, Sandra&#39;s web site.   <br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re spiritually minded folks maybe a recommendation for Polly<br/>
Berrends book,  &quot;Whole Child, Whole Parent.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Some child respecting, gentle parenting, sig line that subtlety<br/>
brainwashes unsuspecting fence sitters. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Someone told me posting from one&#39;s own perspective is non threatening. <br/>
Writing &quot;when this happened at our house this is what we did..., etc&quot; <br/>
But I&#39;ve seen this style used and then I&#39;ve seen people say &quot;Well, it<br/>
must be nice to be so perfect!&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  So, some people are just plain hard<br/>
to communicate with, no matter what.  Some people don&#39;t know the<br/>
difference between - I disagree with you - and - you&#39;re a poop head, and<br/>
they view every disagreement as a personal attack.  <br/>
<br/>
Ask them why.  Why do you spank (or whatever the punishment is)?  Then<br/>
post web sites that offer alternatives.   (Maybe we should all arm<br/>
ourselves with these links so we can fire them off at will. Bang! Bang! )<br/>
 <br/>
My friend sent an e-mail explaining why she spanked her kids and I sent<br/>
it back to her a few days later.  When she read it she was horrified at<br/>
herself.   Seeing it written out might make others aware of how lame the<br/>
reasoning sounds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432302480">I, personally, am so glad to read there are people that DON&#39;T spank their <br/>
kids.  What really gets me curious, is how many that don&#39;t spank their kids are <br/>
Christians?  I for one am a Christian, and my position on spanking has always <br/>
been apalled by other Christians.  I have yet to read one place in the Bible <br/>
that says spank your children.  That &quot;spare the rod, spoil the child&quot; is a lame <br/>
excuse, and if you know the Bible you know that the rod is what the shepherd <br/>
uses to GUIDE his flock, not hit them with it, and that this is a metaphor.  <br/>
So, I&#39;m wondering, anyone in the same boat?<br/>

If you put the /unschooling after it they can bypass the SCA and my personal <br/>
life parts, and get straight to the links which now has spanking (and other <br/>
direct-stuff) right there, lefthand side, for those who don&#39;t like to read <br/>
through text to find their links.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for including that in your list!<br/>

Probably because they&#39;re feeling like poop heads and they want to blame it on <br/>
someone besides themselves.<br/>

<br/>
Yes! I am in the boat, too !!!  The only other Christians I have come in contact with that don&#39;t spank are also home/unschoolers, which makes perfect sense to me. Also, did attachment parenting, homebirth, breastfed til the CHILD was ready to be done, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Always believed as you stated above, Carol, about the rod not being punishment but guidance, but so many interpret it as instruction to spank. Sometimes thought I was not doing my &#39;Christian Duty&#39;, but I stuck with what I believed in my gut and in the end its between you and Him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973765717">Thank you, thank you, thank you, Melanie!  I&#39;m glad to know at least one <br/>
person knows how I feel.  I don&#39;t really care what everyone else thinks, but it <br/>
feels good to know SOMEONE else knows how I feel.  The only thing I really <br/>
missed that I regret is homebirth-I admire you for that.  All of my children were <br/>
born prematurely to some extent so it was too dangerous for me, so I was told, <br/>
and really don&#39;t doubt it, but wish it could have been different.  I don&#39;t <br/>
dwell on it, though. I am happy for you that you got to experience that.  I did <br/>
the same thing with breastfeeding-waited for my child to move on instead of <br/>
rejecting him (what else could you call it?) and boy was my MIL unhappy about <br/>
that.  I am so glad God gave me a strong personality and the ability from day one <br/>
not to care too much what people think of me.  I would have been a nut case <br/>
with all the mainstreaming I&#39;ve rejected!  <br/>
<br/>
Striking another human being has never accomplished anything in my life, <br/>
whether it was me being hit or me hitting.  I can&#39;t even wrap my mind around it.  <br/>
I feel like finding this web group has connected me to people who think <br/>
somewhat like me, and I keep learning more and more each day about things I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing that I need to change in order to really be unschooling.  Next week I am <br/>
giving away my textbooks that we never use anyway unless my son thinks there <br/>
is something interesting and of value in keeping them.  It is, after all, HIS <br/>
education, not mine.  And I feel like we are bonding quite more firmly, <br/>
because I&#39;ve been able to spend time learning about him, instead of teaching him so <br/>
many things I learned in school that I&#39;d forgotten and are so insignificant in <br/>
life in general.  (to me)  <br/>
<br/>
I feel blessed!<br/>

I would like to invite you to step away from the &quot;education.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s his life and learning, but have you stopped learning?  Maybe there&#39;s a <br/>
textbook you&#39;d like to keep as reference, or to cut the pictures out of, or to  <br/>
cut a secret compartment into.<br/>

I have never spanked or threatened or punished my boys and I am a Christian <br/>
but I do know some Christians who do not spank.  I know some that do.  I know <br/>
some non-Christians who spank and some who do not.  <br/>
