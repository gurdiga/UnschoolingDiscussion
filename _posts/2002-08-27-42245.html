<h4>Nora or Devereaux Cannon</h4>
<time>27 Aug 2002, at  2:24pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247131398">... also known as a way to step aside from the particulars of the<br/>
Eminem discussion and share a thought that occurred to me while<br/>
ya&#39;ll were metadiscussing or solipsizing or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
First, there is a big difference between &quot;pop&quot; culture at it&#39;s<br/>
roughest when it is experienced in the context of a family,<br/>
rather than in the context of a mini society defined solely by<br/>
age equality.  To put the cookies on a low shelf, a kid who has<br/>
to &quot;become&quot; Eminem/2 Live Crew/Elvis in order to fit into the<br/>
society he spends his waking hours inhabiting is very different<br/>
from a kid who can listen, take what he wants and back out when<br/>
it isn&#39;t what he wants.  For a while we had to put kids into day<br/>
care - and I had to be much more limiting about choices, simply<br/>
because the competition even at young ages to sound and look like<br/>
Brittany was more than was healthy for a developing individual -<br/>
now I try to know what they are &#39;into&quot; but it is more so that I<br/>
can stay a half a thought ahead of what will come next rather<br/>
than trying to &quot;undo&quot; damage.<br/>
<br/>
Second, folks, go outside!  We christened the 7 week old Sunday,<br/>
involving all the kith and kin coming up to visit and a grand<br/>
brunch.  The 6 asked me as we were driving to town how big a germ<br/>
was.  Now she had asked me before and I had promised to look it<br/>
up with her, when &quot;Teeny tiny, too small to see&quot; was not a<br/>
sufficient answer.  Caught with my research down, I suggested she<br/>
ask her Papaw, who is a doctor.  We got to their hotel room and<br/>
away she went asking.  His answer was prompt - &quot;about 2 microns<br/>
or 1/4th the size of a red blood cell.&quot;  That of course begged<br/>
the question of how big a micron is; he obligingly held out his<br/>
arms &quot;about&quot; 39 inches apart and said 1 millionth of this.  Now<br/>
she has the vocabulary of numbers to know what a million is, but<br/>
very few of us can really get our minds around all those zero&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
So after the party, I was pondering this issue and went outside.<br/>
Have I mentioned, &quot;Go outside&quot;?  We have a property line that is<br/>
about 1,000 feet long - wander around where you are, you can find<br/>
a good long line like that somewhere.  Now I needed to know what<br/>
was 1/1000th of a foot - so I calculated it up and put that<br/>
number into Google as the only search term - turns out that we<br/>
had some sheet copper around that was pretty darn close.  So we<br/>
took a meter stick and the copper mask (the sheet copper had been<br/>
used, LOL) and went out on an adventure - a micron is to this<br/>
meter stick as this piece of copper is to that property line.<br/>
Kinesthetic Kate has walked the line a couple of times in the<br/>
last two days and has tried laying the edge of the mask down into<br/>
the dirt to count how many times to make even an inch.<br/>
<br/>
That micron exploration has been broken up mainly by the fact<br/>
that we had a fruit salad in a watermelon bowl carved to look<br/>
like a baby cradle for the Christening.  Far too pretty according<br/>
to the kidlets to just compost.  So the 2 got his first hammering<br/>
project.  The woodpile is in the process of being shifted for the<br/>
winter&#39;s fuel, moving the last year leftovers to the side mainly<br/>
to become mulching, but some are still burnable.  I found a<br/>
couple of pieces that were still solid and that had a good flat<br/>
side, then handed him a fist full of finishing nails and a<br/>
hammer.  With a little help, he got a bunch of the nails into the<br/>
wood far enough for our purposes.  We cut the watermelon cradle<br/>
into chunks (about 4 inches square) and stuck them on the nails<br/>
yummy side up, then set the whole she-bang on the deck rail<br/>
outside the dining room bay window (that&#39;s the window with the<br/>
telescopes and binoculars).  We had a constant parade of<br/>
butterflies and hummers, leading to a constant parade to the<br/>
field guides to identify then.  By dark, all of the red had been<br/>
eaten away and we brought the contraption back in for refilling<br/>
this morning with more of the Christening cradle become butterfly<br/>
feeder activity... and somewhere along about 2:30 today, that<br/>
same lovely 6 asked me if we had any math workbooks laying around<br/>
she could play with.</div>
