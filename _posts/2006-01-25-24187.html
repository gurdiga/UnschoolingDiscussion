<div id="ygrps-yiv-974666072">&lt;&lt;Just saying hello, I&#39;m new  to homeschooling/unschooling and am <br/>
listening in to see how it is &quot;done&quot;  IRL. I have 2.5 yo b/g twins that <br/>
I am currently homeschooling/unschooling  in that we have decided not <br/>
to send them to preschool like almost everyone  does here in our area <br/>

I am finding that I particularly like advice/wisdom given  from parents <br/>
who did or are currently unschooling b/c they are so  child-friendly <br/>
and respectful. I have also been told several times by some  <br/>
acquantainces who are former teachers that I am probably more of an  <br/>
unschooler when they learn how we parent our kids. So, here I am to  <br/>
listen and learn if I am indeed an unschooler as they said &lt;G&gt; and to  <br/>
see where this journey will take us if it is so.  -Arlynn&gt;&gt;<br/>

If you are in the lower hudson valley vicinity contact me off list.  I&#39;ll connect you with unschooling families (many with younger siblings) so you and your kids can start right now being a part of the local community.  It was important for me when my oldest was around your kids ages to make the homeschooling community our main group.  It was then transparent to my dd when other 5yo&#39;s were going to Kindergarten...she never felt like she missed out on a thing.  The unschooling/homeschooling world of living and learning together was her &quot;mainstream.&quot;<br/>
