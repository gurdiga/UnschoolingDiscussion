<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435077322">This will definitely be helpful for us.  The only thing keeping me from completely committing to unschooling is the worry that he will say &quot;hey, wait a minute, homeschooling was on thing, but THIS? &quot;  So I am making small changes and we are having good conversations, and I am encouraged.  I think the best thing is that he sees the peacefulness and joy in me and our girls, and I think that is a great move in the right direction.  Trying to move slowly, but not too slowly!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143090790">I&#39;m still sorting through working out how to use unschooling principles with my husband so these links are very helpful! I printed the following from the first link for my office wall, but replaced &quot;child&quot; with my husband&#39;s name:<br/>
__________________________________________________________________<br/>
    * modelling positive behaviour<br/>
    * trying to understand your childâs behaviour rather than reacting against it<br/>
    * letting go of control, of âshouldsâ, âmustsâ etc.<br/>
    * validating and providing a safe space for your child to express their feelings<br/>
    * viewing the world from your childâs point of view<br/>
    * getting in touch with your own needs and constuctively, lovingly and respectfully communicating that to your child in ways and times that are appropriate<br/>
    * being on your âchildâs sideâ rather than arguing against them<br/>
    * assuming the best possible motives behind your childâs behaviour and engaging with them accordingly<br/>
    * working with your child to develop win- win solutions for all involved<br/>
