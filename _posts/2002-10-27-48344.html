<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty intense. I think Kathryn had a sort of love/hate relationship<br/>
with it at that age. She loved the dinosaurs but wished the movie were less<br/>
intense. I think the threat of death is scarier than the dinosaurs<br/>
themselves. There are a few scenes where people are basically prey being<br/>
tensely chased and stalked by the dinosaurs for loooong minutes. 3 of them<br/>
die.<br/>
<br/>
I think there might be a Making of Jurassic Park video which might be good<br/>
enough or would at least give him the knowledge of what the dinosaurs really<br/>
are: images generated by computers. If he does want to watch the movie,<br/>
perhaps watch it with a technical eye. Point out various times (particulary<br/>
the tense scenes!) when the actors are &quot;reacting&quot; to the dinosaus that there<br/>
wasn&#39;t anything there for them to react to. They&#39;re being chased by nothing,<br/>
threatened by empty air. They had to imagine what the dinosaur was going to<br/>
look like. And perhaps pause the video occasionally to marvel at how real<br/>
the dinosaurs look and try to figure out when they&#39;re using a model and when<br/>
it&#39;s CGI.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also Prehisteria (or Prehysteria?) for kids which looks like a<br/>
boring, cheesy movie of the week but was actually pretty good. There are<br/>
sequels. I assume he&#39;s seen all the Land Before Time movies.<br/>
<br/>
If he likes books on tape, he might enjoy Raptor Red. It&#39;s a story told from<br/>
the point of view of a Utah raptor. It&#39;s an adult book but my daughter<br/>
listened enraptured (literally as well as punnily ;-) to it at about that<br/>
age or even younger.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also Odds Bodkin&#39;s Little Proto stories. There are 3 of them. (And<br/>
if anyone has a chance to see him in person, he&#39;s *fabulous*.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332031120">Hey Amy,<br/>
I was just looking into Dinotopia and they will be rebroadcasting the miniseries on The Hallmark Channel, starting Nov 10 and then the new TV series will start on ABC on Thanksgiving Day,  Maybe he would like these.  My kids loved the miniseries and my son read Dinotopia at about age 6/7.  There are 3 Dinotopia books now and the pictures in them are awesome,  the illustrator is wonderful.  He was featured in August 2002 Smithsonian.<br/>
 <br/>
My son watched Jurassic park at about 8.  I was very uptight about those things then, I was worried about the violence,  then when he was 8 he bought it with his own money.  He was fine with it,  my daughter who is 19 months younger than him watched it at about 7 and she wanted to know what my problem was with it.   They seem to handle things better than me.    It is so true that often they seem to know themselves better than I know them.     My daughter self regulates herself wonderfully!  She wanted to watch Lord of the Rings and again I was a little apprehensive,  but as soon as I talked with her about it she said she was glad she hadn&#39;t gone with us to the theater and now she&#39;ll watch it on small screen.    <br/>
She hasn&#39;t decided if she&#39;ll watch the new one on screen or not.     I was a bundle of nerves after the first one.  Very stressful to me!!  But I still loved the adventure.<br/>
 <br/>
Take Care,<br/>

I think this is the key...knowing your child(ren) and trusting that they know themselves.Some children are very sensitive...mine don&#39;t seem to be AT ALL! Then again I think for my son the love of aliens and lots of cool special effects drowns out the violence to some degree, and again we talk ALOT about real vs. pretend.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My kids love the Jurassic Park movies. I think they first saw it when they <br/>
were like 2 and 3. They loved it right away and weren&#39;t scared at all. My <br/>
niece and nephew watched it at the same time and were 12 and 13, and they <br/>
were scared. Of course their mom was very restrictive as to what she thought <br/>
they should see or not. Probably the first time they saw anything with <br/>
suspense in it.<br/>
<br/>
I would imagine it&#39;s scary for some kids, especially if they are prone to <br/>
bad dreams and such. Watching it during the day, far away from bedtime I <br/>
think would help. Also, keeping the tone light during the movie will help <br/>
too. You know, laugh and talk a lot during the scenes so the kids don&#39;t get <br/>
all into thinking how scary it is. That&#39;s how we dealt with other kids <br/>
watching and possibly being scared. Seemed to work well.<br/>
<br/>
(my kids love Godzilla too, the new one.)<br/>
