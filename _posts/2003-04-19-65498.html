&gt; CHILDREN&#39;S HEALTH IS DECLINING,<br/>
&gt; SAYS AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; by Bette Hileman*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Over the past few decades, various disturbing trends have led<br/>
&gt; researchers to believe that environmental exposures are<br/>
&gt; contributing to children&#39;s declining health status in the U.S.<br/>
&gt; Federal and private health programs are just beginning to<br/>
&gt; realize the extent of the problem and to seek solutions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Scientists are concerned that environmental exposures cause a<br/>
&gt; wide range of health threats to kids, including birth defects,<br/>
&gt; cancer, and asthma. According to a recent study from the<br/>
&gt; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS),<br/>
&gt; childhood cancer incidence has risen 1% a year since the early<br/>
&gt; 1970s, the prevalence of asthma has gone up sharply, the<br/>
&gt; incidence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br/>
&gt; may be increasing, a growing percentage of boys are born with<br/>
&gt; defects in their reproductive tracts, and the prevalence of<br/>
&gt; autism is rising dramatically....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; [In late February the National Institute of Environmental<br/>
&gt; Health Sciences sponsored a meeting to examine a number of<br/>
&gt; specific environmental health risks to children, address ways<br/>
&gt; to translate science into action to protect children, and to<br/>
&gt; identify research gaps.]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ...Former U.S. Public Health Service director Philip R. Lee<br/>
&gt; gave the keynote speech at the meeting. He described the types<br/>
&gt; of exposures likely to affect the health of the fetus and<br/>
&gt; children and some things that can be done to mitigate these<br/>
&gt; exposures. Lee is professor emeritus of social medicine at the<br/>
&gt; University of California School of Medicine.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Children are especially vulnerable to environmental insults,<br/>
&gt; Lee said. &quot;At birth, their nervous, respiratory, reproductive,<br/>
&gt; and immune systems are not yet fully developed. They are in a<br/>
&gt; dynamic state of growth with cells multiplying and organ<br/>
&gt; systems developing at a rapid rate,&quot; he explained. Also, pound<br/>
&gt; for pound, children take in more air, food, and liquids than do<br/>
&gt; adults.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The impact of neurodevelopmental disorders such as ADHD on<br/>
&gt; children and their families is immense, Lee said. Children with<br/>
&gt; ADHD are at greater risk for dropping out of school early, drug<br/>
&gt; abuse, and suicide. Environmental exposure to any of a number<br/>
&gt; of known and suspected developmental neurotoxicants could<br/>
&gt; contribute to ADHD, including lead, mercury, manganese, tobacco<br/>
&gt; smoke, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), certain<br/>
&gt; pesticides, and solvents, he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One of the exposures society could easily reduce, Lee said, is<br/>
&gt; to manganese. Its effects include inattention, impulsivity, and<br/>
&gt; hyperaggression. Manganese -- an essential nutrient -- occurs<br/>
&gt; at very low levels in breast milk, but it is added to infant<br/>
&gt; formula made from cow&#39;s milk and occurs naturally at even<br/>
&gt; higher levels in soy formula. It is dangerous for infants to<br/>
&gt; consume more manganese than they would get from breast milk<br/>
&gt; because infants have no capacity to excrete excess amounts<br/>
&gt; until they are older, he said....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; David O. Carpenter, director of the Institute for Health & the<br/>
&gt; Environment at the State University of New York, Albany,<br/>
&gt; discussed the effects of exposures to lead, mercury, and PCBs.<br/>
&gt; Children with higher lead exposures are more easily distracted,<br/>
&gt; less organized, and apt to be hyperactive, impulsive,<br/>
&gt; aggressive, and easily frustrated, he said. &quot;Blood lead levels<br/>
&gt; as low as one microgram per deciliter are associated with<br/>
&gt; harmful effects on children&#39;s learning and behavior. There may<br/>
&gt; be no lower threshold for some of the diverse effects of lead<br/>
&gt; in children,&quot; he observed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Low-dose prenatal exposure to mercury, Carpenter said, also<br/>
&gt; affects a broad range of skills -- motor, attention, and<br/>
&gt; language for instance. It decreases IQ and increases<br/>
&gt; impulsivity. &quot;Children of women who consume large amounts of<br/>
&gt; fish and seafood during pregnancy&quot; are at highest risk of<br/>
&gt; problems from mercury, he said. Immigrants, Native Americans,<br/>
&gt; and others who obtain much of their protein from subsistence<br/>
&gt; fishing are likely to be overexposed to mercury. Blood levels<br/>
&gt; of mercury in one-tenth of U.S. women of childbearing age<br/>
&gt; exceed the reference dose, the safe level, he noted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Early life exposure to PCBs has similar effects, Carpenter<br/>
&gt; said. Infants with the highest exposure, as shown in cord blood<br/>
&gt; and breast milk, have abnormal reflexes and less developed<br/>
&gt; attentiveness to visual and auditory stimuli. Even 3.5 years<br/>
&gt; after birth, they have multiple behavioral problems, as well as<br/>
&gt; impaired thyroid and immune systems. What is totally unknown,<br/>
&gt; he explained, are the adverse effects if a child is exposed to<br/>
&gt; two or three of these substances--lead, mercury, and PCBs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Exposure to air pollution such as ozone or nitrogen oxides is<br/>
&gt; associated with a wide array of health problems, said Jonathan<br/>
&gt; Samet, epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg<br/>
&gt; School of Public Health. Prenatal exposures can cause pregnancy<br/>
&gt; loss and reduced birth weight. Postnatal exposures are<br/>
&gt; associated with cancer, sudden infant death syndrome, and<br/>
&gt; respiratory symptoms, he explained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It is important, Samet continued, to look at the air quality of<br/>
&gt; the microenvironments where children spend a lot of time. For<br/>
&gt; example, most children spend time at home, at school, on<br/>
&gt; playgrounds, in school buses (an average of 40 minutes per day)<br/>
&gt; and parents&#39; vehicles, and outside in neighborhoods, he said.<br/>
&gt; Inside the home, key exposures include tobacco smoke, nitrogen<br/>
&gt; oxides, wood smoke, radon, biological agents, volatile organic<br/>
&gt; compounds, and particles from outdoors, he said. Outdoor<br/>
&gt; exposures are to particles (especially from diesel smoke),<br/>
&gt; ozone, biological agents, and hazardous air pollutants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We know that high levels of combustion-related pollution<br/>
&gt; increase mortality and morbidity, including acute respiratory<br/>
&gt; illness,&quot; Samet said. &quot;But increases in the incidence of asthma<br/>
&gt; cannot be explained solely by outdoor air pollution,&quot; he<br/>
&gt; observed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;More research is needed, but we do know something,&quot; Samet<br/>
&gt; concluded. One is that children who live within 90 meters of a<br/>
&gt; main road have an increased risk of wheezing illness. Another<br/>
&gt; is that children who play team sports outside in areas with<br/>
&gt; high levels of ozone are much more likely to develop asthma<br/>
&gt; than those who play in clean areas. This is from a cohort study<br/>
&gt; of 3,522 children in Southern California with no history of<br/>
&gt; asthma. Also, among asthmatic children, the number of acute<br/>
&gt; events requiring emergency care goes down dramatically when air<br/>
&gt; quality improves. Emergency care and hospitalizations for<br/>
&gt; asthma declined 42% during the 1996 summer Olympic Games in<br/>
&gt; Atlanta when driving was sharply curtailed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peyton A. Eggleston, professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins<br/>
&gt; Bloomberg School of Public Health, noted that acute asthma was<br/>
&gt; more than twice as prevalent among black children (7.2%) as<br/>
&gt; among white children (3.0%) and that the annual death rate from<br/>
&gt; asthma among black children is more than twice as high (38.5<br/>
&gt; per million) as it is for white children (15.1 per million).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A study of hospitalizations for acute asthma in Baltimore from<br/>
&gt; 1989 to 1999 shows that the number is lowest in summer and<br/>
&gt; peaks during September and October. Ozone levels outdoors are<br/>
&gt; highest in July and August, so this means &quot;we need to look at<br/>
&gt; air quality indoors,&quot; as a causal factor, Eggleston said. Also,<br/>
&gt; he noted, &quot;I think viral infections are important in causing<br/>
&gt; asthma problems in the fall.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In a National Cooperative Inner City Asthma Study, researchers<br/>
&gt; went to the homes of 1,528 asthmatic children in eight urban<br/>
&gt; centers, Eggleston said. They found that smoking occurs in 69%<br/>
&gt; of these inner-city homes, elevated nitrogen dioxide in 24%,<br/>
&gt; leaky roofs with water damage--which means mold is probably<br/>
&gt; present--in 29%, and excess roach allergen in the dust in 77%.<br/>
&gt; Children who were sensitized to mold, cockroaches, and dust<br/>
&gt; mites had many more emergency visits to the hospital. As a<br/>
&gt; group, the 1,528 children averaged 3.3 wheezing days every two<br/>
&gt; weeks and one emergency room visit every six months.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The 1% annual increase in the incidence of childhood cancer<br/>
&gt; since 1974 is primarily due to increases in leukemia and<br/>
&gt; central nervous system tumors, said Leslie L. Robison of the<br/>
&gt; department of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. With<br/>
&gt; leukemia, however, &quot;it is less clear whether we are looking at<br/>
&gt; an artifact or a true increase over time,&quot; he said. For central<br/>
&gt; nervous system tumors, better diagnostic techniques may explain<br/>
&gt; the increase, he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In any event, Robison said, one individual in every 600 is<br/>
&gt; diagnosed with cancer before the age of 15, about 8,500<br/>
&gt; children are diagnosed annually with cancer, and about 2,500<br/>
&gt; die each year. The highest incidence of cancer is in the first<br/>
&gt; year of life. &quot;It is quite obvious these cancers are caused by<br/>
&gt; something that happened prior to birth,&quot; he explained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A second peak of tumors occurs during the latter part of<br/>
&gt; adolescence. The most common cancers during this period are<br/>
&gt; Hodgkin&#39;s disease, bone and thyroid cancer, and melanoma....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are known risk factors for some cancers, but they do not<br/>
&gt; explain the extent of the increase, Robison said. For example,<br/>
&gt; brain tumors and acute lymphoblastic leukemia can be caused by<br/>
&gt; ionizing radiation in utero. Acute myeloid leukemia can be<br/>
&gt; caused by ionizing radiation in utero or by chemotherapy, he<br/>
&gt; said. But there are no known risk factors for many childhood<br/>
&gt; cancers, such as neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, Wilm&#39;s tumor,<br/>
&gt; hepatoblastoma, Ewing&#39;s sarcoma, and germ cell tumors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some of the environmental risk factors that may play a role in<br/>
&gt; childhood cancer include the pregnant mother&#39;s exposure to<br/>
&gt; tobacco, alcohol, cured meats, topoisomerase II inhibitors (a<br/>
&gt; class of cancer drugs), and improper doses of vitamins.<br/>
&gt; Postnatal exposures to pesticides and electromagnetic fields,<br/>
&gt; and parental occupations in agriculture, aircraft, pesticide,<br/>
&gt; painting, and pulp and paper industries may also contribute,<br/>
&gt; Robison said. It is likely that genes and environment are both<br/>
&gt; important in most childhood cancers, he said. &quot;It is very<br/>
&gt; unlikely there are any cancers driven by genetics or<br/>
&gt; environment alone,&quot; he explained. But, he added,<br/>
&gt; gene-environment interactions have been investigated hardly at<br/>
&gt; all....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At this point, &quot;studies should focus on what actually we can do<br/>
&gt; to prevent childhood cancer,&quot; said Michael Thune of the<br/>
&gt; American Cancer Society. Much progress has been made in<br/>
&gt; treating cancer, but few advances have been made in identifying<br/>
&gt; cancer causes, he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even though cancer clusters get a lot of media attention, few<br/>
&gt; scientific discoveries have been made from studying them, said<br/>
&gt; Tom Sinks of CDC&#39;s National Center for Environmental Health. A<br/>
&gt; confirmed cancer cluster can be the result of chance or a<br/>
&gt; miscalculation in the expected cancer rate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, a cluster of leukemia in Fallon, Nev., is interesting,<br/>
&gt; Sinks said. Fifteen cases of childhood acute lymphocytic<br/>
&gt; leukemia were diagnosed there when less than one would be<br/>
&gt; expected. &quot;Fallon was warned for years about high levels of<br/>
&gt; arsenic in its drinking water,&quot; which remain very high, he<br/>
&gt; said. High tungsten levels have also been found in Fallon. When<br/>
&gt; compared with mean levels in CDC&#39;s latest national survey, 85%<br/>
&gt; of the people in Fallon have elevated tungsten levels, he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Godfrey Oakley, visiting professor of epidemiology at Rollins<br/>
&gt; School of Public Health at Emory University, pointed out there<br/>
&gt; is more about the environment than just contaminants that can<br/>
&gt; affect children&#39;s health, including vitamin deficiencies,<br/>
&gt; drugs, and maternal diseases. He said, for example, that folate<br/>
&gt; deficiency is known to cause birth defects, especially neural<br/>
&gt; tube defects. Folate deficiency is cheap and easy to solve by<br/>
&gt; fortifying flour and cereal with folate and taking vitamins. In<br/>
&gt; the U.S. since 1998, flour and some cereals have been fortified<br/>
&gt; with folate, but they are not fortified in Europe. &quot;If you want<br/>
&gt; to make a significant reduction in birth defects, pay attention<br/>
&gt; to old problems,&quot; he said. Other known causes of birth defects<br/>
&gt; are the pregnant mother&#39;s use of valproic acid, Accutane, and<br/>
&gt; excess amounts of vitamin A; maternal diabetes; and rubella<br/>
&gt; during pregnancy, he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Terri Damstra of NIEHS discussed the World Health<br/>
&gt; Organization&#39;s global assessment of endocrine-disrupting<br/>
&gt; chemicals (EDCs)--substances that disrupt the endocrine<br/>
&gt; system....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Exposure of the fetus or the young child to EDCs may result in<br/>
&gt; permanent changes in function, Damstra said, but exposure<br/>
&gt; during adulthood may not result in detectable effects. Another<br/>
&gt; feature of EDCs is that exposure to the same level during<br/>
&gt; different life stages may produce different effects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One observed effect of EDCs is impaired neurobehavioral<br/>
&gt; development in children caused by fetal exposure to PCBs,<br/>
&gt; Damstra said. A weight-of-evidence approach looking at data<br/>
&gt; from all the relevant research indicates that EDCs in the<br/>
&gt; environment have potential for adverse outcomes on people.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Coordinated international research strategies are urgently<br/>
&gt; needed to address numerous data gaps and uncertainties,&quot; she<br/>
&gt; said. &quot;Prevention of exposure is the single most effective<br/>
&gt; means of protecting against environmental threats,&quot; she<br/>
&gt; concluded.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Environmental agents can disrupt many cellular events in the<br/>
&gt; neurological development of the fetus, child, and early<br/>
&gt; adolescent, according to Ted Schettler, a physician who is<br/>
&gt; science director for the Science & Environmental Health<br/>
&gt; Network, a think tank that is concerned with the wise<br/>
&gt; application of science to the protection of the environment and<br/>
&gt; public health. These include cell division, migration,<br/>
&gt; differentiation, formation of synapses, pruning of synapses,<br/>
&gt; myelinization, and apoptosis.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For example, cell differentiation can be affected by exposure<br/>
&gt; to ethanol, nicotine, mercury, lead, and decreased thyroid<br/>
&gt; hormone, Schettler said. However, there are still many<br/>
&gt; uncertainties when trying to assess the effects of toxicants on<br/>
&gt; nervous system development. One is the &quot;long latent periods<br/>
&gt; between relevant environmental exposures and emergence of<br/>
&gt; evidence of impairments. Therefore, waiting for proof of harm<br/>
&gt; before acting can result in widespread damage,&quot; he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We are in the midst of a revolution in scientific<br/>
&gt; understanding of links between exposures and health that<br/>
&gt; promises to provide opportunities for new interventions to<br/>
&gt; protect public health,&quot; said John Peterson (Pete) Myers, senior<br/>
&gt; adviser to the United Nations Foundation. This revolution is<br/>
&gt; driven by research funded by many governments.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A result of these research efforts is a torrent of new papers<br/>
&gt; coming out virtually every week showing that many environmental<br/>
&gt; contaminants are biologically active. This research suggests<br/>
&gt; that adult chronic diseases will need fresh examination,<br/>
&gt; particularly with respect to the possibility that environmental<br/>
&gt; contaminants are programming the fetus so that chronic disease<br/>
&gt; develops later in life, he explained.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Despite these research needs, EPA&#39;s program on children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; environmental health may be scaled back. The agency&#39;s Office of<br/>
&gt; Children&#39;s Health Protection has been without a director since<br/>
&gt; April 2002, and the executive order creating the Presidential<br/>
&gt; Task Force on Children&#39;s Environmental Health & Safety will<br/>
&gt; expire on April 21. EPA has proposed to cut its annual funding<br/>
&gt; for the Centers for Children&#39;s Environmental Health from $6<br/>
&gt; million to $3 million. The centers are jointly funded by EPA<br/>
&gt; and NIEHS. If Congress approves this funding cut, the total<br/>
&gt; number of [children&#39;s environmental health] centers will<br/>
&gt; decline from 12 to 10.<br/>

&gt; From Plastics News March 31, 2003<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; HOUSTON (March 28, 2003) -- The American Chemistry Council<br/>
&gt; (ACC) may be taking a page from the American Plastics Council&#39;s<br/>
&gt; (APC) playbook in an attempt to improve its image. The ACC will<br/>
&gt; make a decision this spring on a communications program that<br/>
&gt; would be &quot;similar in size and scope&quot; [$50 million] to the one<br/>
&gt; APC launched several years ago, said Nova Chemicals Corp.<br/>
&gt; President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Lipton, who serves<br/>
&gt; as an ACC board member.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;APC spends most of its money on TV commercials that focus on<br/>
&gt; young, married women,&quot; Lipton said.... &quot; The commercials help<br/>
&gt; young, married women feel that they and their families are<br/>
&gt; safer because of plastic products.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;The concept has worked extremely well for plastics and it can<br/>
&gt; work the same way for chemicals.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; Council had selected Ogilvy & Mather, New York, and its public<br/>

&gt; campaign. The American Chemistry Council is a trade association<br/>
