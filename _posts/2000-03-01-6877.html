&gt; your point about being around negative people producing neg behavior is good,<br/>
&gt; but was almost lost on me for trying to recover from your &quot;birth vehicle&quot;<br/>
&gt; label on apparently another human being.  whew!  am i the only one that finds<br/>
&gt; that deeply offensive????  have i misunderstood your use of the phrase?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>i&#39;m not at all offended.   if i remember/understand it right, from sus&#39;s other<br/>
post, her &#39;mother&#39; doesn&#39;t really act like a mother so why bestow that title on<br/>
her.  it appears to me sus just giving her &#39;mother&#39; the title that best fits her<br/>
actions and the role her &#39;mother&#39; has chosen.  at least that&#39;s how i interpreted<br/>
it:)<br/>
