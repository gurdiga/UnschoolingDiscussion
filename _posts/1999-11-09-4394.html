<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628083670">In a book &quot;Living Joyfully With Children&quot; the authors suggest that<br/>
shielding children from violence would contribute to a more peaceful<br/>
society, because they would internalize non-violence as the norm.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it may be easier for children to understand that a story from a<br/>
book is &quot;fiction&quot; (although of course not all books are fiction).  My<br/>
four year old has a hard time understanding that even a cartoon character<br/>
on TV is not &quot;real&quot;.  Besides, when we are reading to pre-reading<br/>
children, we have the option of skipping parts that we don&#39;t want them to<br/>
hear.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;It may certainly be true for people who accept &quot;television reality&quot; as<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;real<br/>
reality&quot; (I can&#39;t believe I just created that abysmal phrase &lt;g&gt;) but<br/>
watching television doesn&#39;t create people with distorted reality, any<br/>
more<br/>
than reading fantasy novels or Winnie the Pooh leads to such.<br/>

<br/>
As all in life, there is a continuum from one extreme to another.  I<br/>
don&#39;t believe that seeing an occasional act of violence on TV will turn<br/>
someone into an ax murderer, but what possible good can come from seeing<br/>
hours of TV violence or reading lots of violent stories?<br/>
<br/>
To respond to an older post about Arthur: The creators may see it<br/>
otherwise, but I feel they promote the normality and accepted ness of an<br/>
unhealthy sibling relationship between Arthur and DW.<br/>
