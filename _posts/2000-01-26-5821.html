&lt;&lt;The sisters are 4 and 7 and the other little girl is 8.  <br/>

What kinds of things do kids these ages do for schooling?  They are coming<br/>
<br/>
from IS and I will probably need to begin with some structure for their<br/>
<br/>
comfort and ease out of it as they deschool and settle into the family.&gt;&gt;<br/>

If the 7 year old is not &quot;old for her years&quot; how about something like Five in <br/>
a Row, if you get the 4 and 7 year old sisters?  This is a literature based <br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot; that&#39;s not very curricular.  What you do is read some really <br/>
good picture books several times and explore concepts in language arts, <br/>
social studies, science and art.  I think the best ages for this are 5 and 6, <br/>
but your potential kids could be within the range.<br/>
(Check out the website: www.fiveinarow.com.)<br/>
<br/>
They do recommend supplementing Five in a Row with math and phonics <br/>
instruction.<br/>
<br/>
One lesson book, covering about 20 books, or 20 weeks of lessons costs about <br/>
$20, I think.  You can get the story books at the library, usually.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, something with lots of reading stories on the couch and having the <br/>
siblings work on the same stuff, but at their own level seems like it would <br/>
promote togetherness.<br/>
<br/>
I have less clear ideas about how to approach an 8 year old.  Although, Laura <br/>
Ingalls Wilder books have been big with the homeschooled girls I have known.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My daughter is only 2 and we have only begun researching homeschooling,<br/>
and then ultimately unschooling, in the past 6 months.  But even so, I&#39;ve<br/>
already joined the local support group in our area, Tulsa, Oklahoma, for<br/>
homeschoolers.  I thought for sure we would be out of place being<br/>
non-churchgoers and planning to unschool, but to my surprise, most of<br/>
these families who&#39;ve been doing it for years already have moved<br/>
naturally from schooling at home to unschooling, and they are eager to<br/>
talk about it at these Mom&#39;s Night Out or Monthly meetings.  I highly<br/>
recommend it, even if you don&#39;t begin right away.  It&#39;s a great way to<br/>
put into reality all the things we&#39;ve read and thought that brought us to<br/>
this decision.  And, it makes a real life community instead of that vast<br/>
internet one.  You can look in the back of GWS or HEM for the support<br/>
group nearest you.<br/>
