&lt;But I would also say to my husband or friend, &quot;try this, you might <br/>
like it&quot; <br/>
if there were something new or different offered and he/they had <br/>
gotten any, <br/>
they might have just over looked it.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that they way it is with LOTS of new things?  We see/hear/taste <br/>
something that we think our children MIGHT enjoy so we tell them <br/>
about it and let <br/>
them make their own decision?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this part.  My sister had to coax me into trying <br/>
Japanese sushi rolls.  Even though there was nothing raw, I was <br/>
seriously turned off.  Anyway, she talked me into it and I love them <br/>
now.  I could eat those things every day.  But again, I think it <br/>
comes down to personality.  There are some people who are more <br/>
*convincable* than others.  Like I mentioned in a previous post (gih, <br/>
I am days behind!), my 4yo is completely unconvincable.  In fact the <br/>
more you push, the more he would run.<br/>
