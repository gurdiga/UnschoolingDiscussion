&lt;&lt; Let me judge and handle what is harming the building. Just because <br/>
something<br/>
 doesn&#39;t get said on the list doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not being handled. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is very good advice.<br/>
Joyce has done a marvelous job of moderating some sticky posts.....I think we <br/>
all owe her a huge round of applause.<br/>
She&#39;s doing it for free, out of the goodness of her heart and love for <br/>
unschooling, not like she&#39;s getting some paycheck to put up with all the <br/>
snarkiness and crap.<br/>
The list is getting better because of her.<br/>
I say we listen very carefully to her advice and I think the list will be a <br/>
marvelous place for us all (at least those who choose to really think about <br/>
what is being said!!)<br/>
Thank you Joyce!! You&#39;re truly a gem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575281275">Common sense:<br/>
<br/>
If it doesn&#39;t help someone understand more about unschooling *don&#39;t* hit<br/>
send.<br/>
<br/>
This is *not* a rule. Rules tend to make people feel the need to get around<br/>
them or point fingers at who isn&#39;t abiding by them. It&#39;s a piece of common<br/>
sense advice to help us create a useful place to exchange information about<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And *do* take that to mean that questions are not only okay but encouraged.<br/>
Because without the questions we won&#39;t have the answers that will help<br/>
people understand more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Of course unschooling is about the whole world so you&#39;ll need to use your<br/>
own judgement on what is helpful and what isn&#39;t. As a general guideline,<br/>
posts that target someone personally or their posting style do *not* help<br/>
people understand more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Ask yourself before you hit send &quot;Does this help someone&#39;s understanding of<br/>
unschooling?&quot; If it doesn&#39;t then hit delete. If it does then hit send.<br/>
<br/>
The civility of the list for the next few days may rest on the decision you<br/>
make.<br/>

compensated for this.<br/>
<br/>
*If* I only put in one hour a day -- and that&#39;s a joke in itself -- I&#39;m<br/>
making less than $2 an hour.<br/>
<br/>
If I were doing it for the money, there&#39;s much easier ways to make a lot<br/>
more money than moderating this list ;-) So it would have to be more<br/>
&quot;goodness of [my] heart and love for unschooling&quot; than the paycheck that&#39;s<br/>
keeping me here.<br/>
