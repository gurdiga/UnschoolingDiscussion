<div id="ygrps-yiv-301518562">When the TV hesitancy was lifted in my house, I didn&#39;t try to encourage<br/>
my little one to do anything else.  Instead, I encouraged TV.  I rented<br/>
a lot of movies, helped find interesting programs, got cable.  For a<br/>
solid month we watched TV.  I served all meals in front of the TV, and I<br/>
talked about TV.  I bought TV related toys.  You get the idea.  It took<br/>
about a month until everyone was pretty sick of the TV.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
the TV was turned on for a couple of months after that.<br/>
<br/>
All things seem to come in phases.  Sometimes we watch a lot and<br/>
sometimes we watch a little and sometimes we watch none.  I think you&#39;ll<br/>
know when the children are ready to hear alternative suggestions.<br/>
They&#39;ll be antsy.<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations and good luck!  I think it is pretty freeing to give up<br/>
control.<br/>
