<div id="ygrps-yiv-1695103661">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to send an update on Lexie. If you forwarded the other <br/>
notes regarding Lexie, please please forward this one as well, I have a <br/>
large number of private notes from people and I will attempt to answer <br/>
them tomorrow... I&#39;m sorry if this note is somewhat repetitive...<br/>
<br/>
 We are home.  Lexie is wide awake in the living room on her very own <br/>
(ok, for a while) hospital bed watching TV, as she took a good nap this <br/>
afternoon.  She has a trapeze thingie to pull herself up, and we have a <br/>
slid board and a wheel chair, but I doubt if the wheel chair will work, <br/>
as it is too narrow.  Her cast is such that he knees are pointing <br/>
outward slightly and bent, so she doesn&#39;t fit in a car set...we took an <br/>
ambulance home!  Lexie was thrilled, and her pain meds kept the old <br/>
bouncing vehicle from hurting too much.  She already has lots of <br/>
signatures on her cast, but it&#39;s pretty big and there is still room for <br/>
more... I need to sign before all the good space is taken.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what was said, so I&#39;ll repeat this too. Lexie fell rather <br/>
hard on tile and broke her femur at the neck.  This is, sadly, a very <br/>
bad break, and her break in particular was one of the worst the <br/>
pediatric trauma orthopedic surgeon (specializing in fractures) had ever <br/>
seen.  We did get her into surgery within the 6 hour time frame crucial <br/>
to help ensure healing, but because of the position of the break and the <br/>
severity of it, there is a 60% chance of the femur head dying which <br/>
would lead to long term issues, likely more surgery, arthritis, growth <br/>
problems, etc. (Lexie is unaware of these issues). As it is we are <br/>
looking at long term recovery, with about 4-6 weeks immobility in a body <br/>
cast, and long term PT.  The surgeon put in 3 pins and is hopeful that <br/>
Lexie will recover.  He was very impressed with her spirit and <br/>
intelligence and her assertiveness with the care providers at the <br/>
hospital, and we all commented on how her positive spirit and attitude <br/>
will help with her healing.  She had been expected to stay in the <br/>
hospital until Thursday or Friday, but we came home today, so that was a <br/>
good sign of at least her recovery from the surgery and trauma of the <br/>
situation. <br/>
<br/>
Janene is very upset, this has been very difficult for her.  Janene <br/>
stayed the last two nights at friend&#39;s houses (thank you Keri and <br/>
Lyla!), and is now in bed in front of me (and I&#39;ll be joining her to <br/>
cuddle with her in a few moments).   My parents are trying to arrange to <br/>
come out, as I don&#39;t have any sick days left (after this week) and will <br/>
need to return to work.  I am also looking into respite care for <br/>
children, our insurance doesn&#39;t cover that but I am going to see if <br/>
there is another organization that will cover that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Two other friends came out today to meet the delivery truck and while <br/>
they waited, they took down 98% of my christmas decorations including <br/>
the tree, and finished cleaning up after a very rowdy girl scout New <br/>
Year&#39;s Slumber Party we hosted for my girl scout troop.  I came home and <br/>
broke down in tears at this gift, it was overwhelming.  Everyone has <br/>
been so supportive and I&#39;m so thankful, and I know that I&#39;m going to <br/>
need more help in the next month or so... :-/.<br/>
<br/>
We had dinner delivered (along with Janene, thanks Lyla!) and my sister <br/>
brought my dog, so we are all here...<br/>
<br/>
The surgeon did come out before putting the body cast on and ask me if I <br/>
thought Lexie was a child who would be still and 100% compliant with <br/>
staying still and off her leg... after a discussion we decided a body <br/>
cast was best, it will be a hard few months but ultimately this gives <br/>
her the best chance of a full recovery.  We won&#39;t know for 2-3 months if <br/>
Lexie won the lottery on this (ie, bone did not die) or if she didn&#39;t <br/>
beat the odds.  Keep up the good thoughts, please. <br/>
<br/>
Well, Lexie is ready for more meds, and then sleep...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone for your support.  Good night<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1266079295">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the mass email, but many people have asked for an update, so I <br/>
am going to send one. <br/>
<br/>
Lexie is doing very well.  She is doing well medically, and <br/>
emotionally.  She has good spirits, is learning to really control what <br/>
she can control.  She has a bedside table now and that&#39;s helping.  She <br/>
has learned to use the trapeze, to pull herself up and to move around <br/>
and exercise a bit.  We now have the proper size wheel chair, which will <br/>
help.  I plan to help her into it tomorrow and maybe get her to the <br/>
porch, if it&#39;s not raining.  She has enjoyed the visitors, she is <br/>
definitely an extrovert and needs the social contact.<br/>
<br/>
I am just stunned with the help we&#39;ve received.  People are bringing <br/>
meals (Ticia, LOVED the rice and potstickers, is that how you spell it?  <br/>
yummy!  The African mac and cheese type dish was great too!), things I <br/>
need from the store, and helping a lot with other things.  Lexie was <br/>
cold the first night and an electrical blanket helped with that.  I am <br/>
just so fortunate to have such great friends.  I can&#39;t even begin to <br/>
make a list of the help that I&#39;ve had, and that has been promised for <br/>
the next weeks.  The meals are just incredible, I will never again NOT <br/>
make a meal for a family in need, I never before realized how such a <br/>
simple thing could be so big.  Just to not have to think about what I&#39;m <br/>
going to eat, but to have someone bring me food, to feed to all of us. <br/>
<br/>
The CT scan didn&#39;t show any abnormalities, so we really don&#39;t know why <br/>
this happened.  There was no evidence of brittle bone disease or a cyst <br/>
or tumor or any other explanation.  At this point we are thinking it was <br/>
just an accident.  We are trying to remain positive about the outcome of <br/>
all of this.  I did find out her surgeon is one of the top four in the <br/>
country, with this specialty (pediatric orthopedic trauma).  I love, so <br/>
far, all of the people in his office.  They are just friendly and nice <br/>
and wonderful.  Even though her surgeon is in Orange County and we are <br/>
now in LA county and farther away, we will figure out how to get to him, <br/>
for continuity of care as well as just simply because he is a nice man <br/>
that treats my daughter with dignity and respect. <br/>
<br/>
Janene is doing OK but it&#39;s pretty hard one her.  She just told me she <br/>
wants to get chickenpox so she can be sick and have everyone wait on her <br/>
and treat her like a queen. <br/>
<br/>
One issue we are working on is how to get her to her doctor <br/>
appointment.  We really need a wheelchair assessable van.  Anyone have <br/>
any ideas on that?<br/>
<br/>
Well, Lexie is calling and Janene needs a story...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone for your thoughts and prayers.  They are much <br/>
appreciated.   Again, if you have sent this to other lists I am no <br/>
longer on, please feel free to forward.  And, again, sorry for the mass <br/>
email.  I have a bunch of emails that I have not answered and I&#39;m going <br/>
to try to do so soon...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>
<br/>

Maye there&#39;s something there like Suntran (the city bus line) has in  <br/>
Albuquerque, a van you can make an appointment to have pick you up.    People use it <br/>
for that, I know--getting to the doctor when they can&#39;t get to the  bus stop <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will check into a charity, but the bus situation is similar to suntran <br/>
but yes, because of the county thing... here is what I wrote to another <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They do... here&#39;s the scoop.  Lexie&#39;s doc is in Orange County, we are <br/>
just over the county line in another county, the services are a real <br/>
pain if you cross county l ines, you have to go to the hub and be taken <br/>
off the one van/bus and then put on another, when they get there.  I was <br/>
told this can take hours. Also, there is a 3 week processing time which <br/>
includes them coming out to assess the patient, and another visit that <br/>
takes the patient to their offices for another assessment.  So, by the <br/>
time we did this, we wouldn&#39;t need the service...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144797025">I think today is the 16th...<br/>
<br/>
Lexie is outside in her wheelchair, in clothing.  This is a big deal.  <br/>
No clothes fit over her cast, and a friend made her some wrap around <br/>
shorts that cover her as needed and are darn cute too!  She has that and <br/>
her DI tshirt on, and is not in her hospital bed with a sheet over <br/>
her--what this must be doing to her mentality, just to be out of bed <br/>
outside with her friend playing. <br/>
<br/>
She has good spirits, loves to talk on the phone with folks that call, <br/>
and loves visitors, is eating better, especially at night, although we <br/>
are having issues with getting her vitamins down, she just doesn&#39;t like <br/>
the flavor so we will try smooshing them again today and mixing them <br/>
with maybe yogurt or pudding.  She is pretty much pain free, except at <br/>
night a bit, and is getting really good at moving herself around, <br/>
getting to things on her table, and handling her personal needs (with <br/>
assistance, of course).  Lexie is going to get through this because she <br/>
is so strong and brave. <br/>
<br/>
I told her that in the hospital and she forbid me to say it again.  She <br/>
said &quot;when you tell me I&#39;m strong and brave I think this is some huge <br/>
and horrible situation I have to deal with and that it will be hard, but <br/>
if you just tell me you love me then I know it&#39;s just a normal situation <br/>
I can handle.&quot;  Wisdom from my 9 year old.  So I will just tell you all <br/>
that she&#39;s strong and brave and I will just tell her I love her.  I did <br/>
find a way to crawl into bed with her to cuddle, something we have <br/>
missed dreadfully, and that has helped us both. <br/>
<br/>
I have a cold as does Janene, but I&#39;m not surprised, between being <br/>
exposed to hospital germs and lack of sleep... I am catching up this <br/>
weekend.<br/>
<br/>
The things to over come still seem to be transportation and help with <br/>
home health care.  My mom isn&#39;t going to be able to do this for another <br/>
four weeks, or longer (I will talk to the doctor on Monday about what <br/>
the situation is when her cast is removed, will she be able to sit up <br/>
and be in a regular car seat?  I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;ll need to be pretty <br/>
much immobile for a while longer... If it&#39;s just a wheel chair and she&#39;s <br/>
sitting up then we may be able to return to our previous child care <br/>
situation before the injury...)  I am calling agency after agency, each <br/>
of whom just tells me to call another agency... Most of those calls are <br/>
stopped for the long weekend, but I will resume on Tuesday.  Kaiser is <br/>
open on Monday and I put a call in Friday night demanding that they help <br/>
with at least the transportation to the doctor and back as that is <br/>
medical necessary.  I told them that if I put her unsafely in my car <br/>
after THEY told me it was unsafe, and there was an accident, I&#39;m sure <br/>
that my car insurance would be quite interested in how a medical team <br/>
could allow a child to be transported unsafely... They tried to say the <br/>
trip home from the hospital (2nd hospital stay, I think some of you <br/>
don&#39;t know she had to go in again last week, Sunday-Tuesday--she got a <br/>
new hot pink cast out of it!)  wasn&#39;t covered and I told them that about <br/>
my insurance and within an hour they had agreed to transport her home by <br/>
ambulance --the precedence has been set. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I need to go out to help her go on a walk... the wheel chair is <br/>
off center a bit because of her size, but it&#39;s the only one that will <br/>
fit her cast, so her friend can&#39;t take her without me there to help in <br/>
case there is a problem.  Thanks again for all your healing thoughts and <br/>
prayers and help with meals (the meals are an incredible help, I never <br/>
understood that before, but I do now!) and all the other help people are <br/>
giving. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s interesting.  I wonder if some people would like hearing that they are strong and brave?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad to hear that Lexie is coming along and that you have lots of support.  It can be a gift to let our friends help us, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned awhile back that I would be having chemotherapy for breast cancer, but I&#39;ve decided not to do the chemotherapy at this time. ** (note below in case anyone wonders about that.  I gave little thought to breast cancer until it happened to me.)<br/>
<br/>
One of my friends has told me several times that I&#39;m so brave.  While it didn&#39;t highly annoy me, I didn&#39;t find it very helpful either.  I mean, this thing has happened and I have to deal with it.  Is that bravery?  A few times I&#39;ve found myself comforting other people who act so upset by my diagnosis.  Weird.  OTH, it is difficult to know what to say to people when bad things happen.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
<br/>
**note about breast cancer follows.  Delete now if not interested.<br/>
<br/>
My husband found the lump.  I&#39;ve since heard that a majority of breast cancers are found by the person&#39;s partner.  Mine was a &quot;typical&quot; cancer, being ER+ (Estrogen receptor positive).<br/>
<br/>
Definition of a small breast tumor is debatable.  It used to be 2 cm, but some docs think over 1.  Over 2 centimeters (usually chemo) and under 1 centimeter (chemo rarely recommended) are easier to recommend treatment.  Mine was 1.3 cm.  I saw two oncologists who both said it is a tough call whether to choose chemotherapy.  It is believed that half of the women who receive chemo for breast cancer do not need it, but there are no definitive tests YET available to accurately predict which ones should.  Chemotherapy treatment is much lower risk than it used to be, but certainly not something anybody would choose without good reason.<br/>
<br/>
I had a sentinel lymph node biopsy done.  That was negative (no cancer detected in lymph nodes.)  That test is about 97% reliable.  I had a blood test called CA28/29.  It tests for a protein in the blood that is secreted by tumors.  Normal is 0-40 and mine was 4.  The test has limited use though.  If it were reliable and useful for detecting cancer, it would probably be on the list of standard screening tests.  It does give the doctor some info and maybe its use now will result in better info down the road.  I had a chest x-ray that appeared normal.  When breast cancer spreads, it most often spreads first to bones and/or lungs.  I had quite a lesson on why they can&#39;t just do a complete bone scan to look for spread.  Apparently most middle-aged or older people have all kinds of scars or other oddities in their skeletons and doctors see a lot of things that look strange, but most of them aren&#39;t cancer.  So then it begs the question of what they do when they see something odd.  More surgery?  When most of what they find is benign?  Surgery carries plenty of risks that rule out using it without good cause.<br/>
<br/>
There are new results on a test that checks the DNA of the tumor.  Early results show it highly reliable at predicting which cancers will metastasize, but the test is not available for general use yet.<br/>
<br/>
I will be having radiation to the breast area.  This would be recommended even if I had chemo.  For some unknown reason, chemo doesn&#39;t prevent local recurrence.  Studies have found that lumpectomy (removing the lump) followed by radiation has the same long-term outcome as mastectomy (removing the entire breast)  When the radiation is done in early March, I am scheduled to take tamoxifen, a hormone receptor blocker.  That has potential risks too, but has been found to make a large difference in recurrence rates.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-435704551">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Another week gone.  Lexie has been in the cast for three weeks, and has <br/>
three  more weeks to go.  I spoke with her doctor today and she&#39;s <br/>
scheduled to go in on the 14th to have the cast removed. They will do it <br/>
in the office, and he reminded me to bring her clothing.  I&#39;m pretty <br/>
glad he reminded me, because I may have forgotten... she will have gone <br/>
6 weeks without wearing undies, clean or otherwise... Gotta find the <br/>
humor.  Lexie has her day planned out.  She wants a bath, (a real one, <br/>
these sponge baths  just don&#39;t cut it!), and to go out to eat. The <br/>
situation has made  her appreciate the small things in life and that can <br/>
only be good.  She&#39;s happy that the appt will be on valentine&#39;s day, and <br/>
I&#39;m happy too, as it&#39;s President&#39;s day or some such thing, which means <br/>
I&#39;ll have the day off.  Our appt is for 10:00 am! <br/>
<br/>
She will still be wheelchair bound, or on crutches, for six more weeks.  <br/>
The wheel chair will be switched out, so she&#39;ll have a normal sized <br/>
child&#39;s wheel chair or small adults, instead of this giant chair we have <br/>
now!  I am thinking the hospital bed will still be wise, just because <br/>
the waterbed will likely not be a good idea, and the other bed is on the <br/>
floor, without a frame. <br/>
<br/>
Lexie continues to be mostly in good spirits.  I am amazed at her <br/>
positive attitude, and willingness to do whatever it takes!  She can get <br/>
herself out of her wheel chair alone, with the help of her trapieze <br/>
bar.  She does many things alone, including taking care of a lot of her <br/>
personal needs (as she can, she still needs some help.)  She loves <br/>
visitors, and they give her energy (she&#39;s my extrovert!) so keep the <br/>
visits coming!  She loves to go for walks and is competent with the <br/>
wheel chair for a short time period, and confident enough that I have <br/>
let her go for walks down the street with a friend.  Girl Scouts and DI <br/>
are coming to her, so that&#39;s helpful. <br/>
<br/>
She is selling girl scout cookies and we are thinking she might have a <br/>
good year (another bit of humor).  She went out last night to neighbors <br/>
and she and Janene sold about 50 boxes. <br/>
<br/>
The hamster issue seems to have been solved too, as Catherine took them <br/>
to a fund raising sale, and sold all of them...to be picked up Friday or <br/>
Sunday!  Did you all know that hamsters still nurse when they are three <br/>
weeks old, this is in excess of their gestational time.  It&#39;s amazing <br/>
what we are learning about hamsters.  I actually have a waiting list if <br/>
someone renigs on a hamster. <br/>
<br/>
The dinners are still so appreciated, as are the visits.  Today I was <br/>
just so tired, when I came home.  Lexie had a few boxes from friends to <br/>
open (knitting stuff from Wendy, thanks! love the needles, arts and <br/>
crafts and other things from Fran, and the whopper, a laptop computer <br/>
from a bunch of wonderful friends from around the country and as far <br/>
away as Australia!  The computer is just amazing, and I&#39;m still crying <br/>
over this tremendous gift!) and I couldn&#39;t even think of eating when <br/>
Lyla shows up with salad, just what I was craving, and protein filled <br/>
chili casserole.  The list of things to do are endless, so that was a <br/>
big one (feeding my children, what could be bigger) crossed off--I could <br/>
concentrate on the rest, and sit down and relax for a few moments.  I <br/>
have vowed strongly that I will make meals and take them to anyone in <br/>
need always, forever.  And even if I don&#39;t cook, I will bring meals <br/>
because even the &quot;bought&quot; meals have come in handy (I ate Pollo Loco at <br/>
work!).  I don&#39;t know what happens to the evening, but it&#39;s already <br/>
10:30 and I&#39;ve accomplished half of what I wanted/needed to do, and yet <br/>
I know I haven&#39;t sat down or relaxed at all except for the 20 minute <br/>
bath I took an hour ago.  So the meals are so helpful.  If they could <br/>
continue, at least every other day, I would very much appreciate it. <br/>
<br/>
The transportation issue has been solved, as well as possible, with <br/>
furniture ties and my van.  Basically two seats have been removed, and <br/>
Lexie goes in the van, and the ties serve as extra seatbelts, attached <br/>
to the bars where the extra seats go.  She also wears the regular <br/>
seatbelt.  It&#39;s better than nothing and with this she will be able to <br/>
participate in the DI instant challenge day on Saturday, and go to park <br/>
day, etc.  It&#39;s very difficult to get her UP into the van (down is <br/>
easier, I just push her out ;-)) it takes two strong bodies (my parents <br/>
cannot help with this) but I figure everything will work out....<br/>
<br/>
The care issue is still an issue.   I am still continuing to look for <br/>
people/organizations who can help with this need.  Three more weeks.... <br/>
In a few months we&#39;ll look back on this and wonder why we were worried.  <br/>
As most of you know, I&#39;m not hugely religious, but I am feeling as <br/>
though it will all work out as it needs to work out, trusting that <br/>
things will happen as they need to happen.  So far that has happened.  I <br/>
work it on my end, calling and thinking and trying to find a solution <br/>
and it will happen, the solution will come and all will be fine. <br/>
<br/>
My parents are doing a wonderful job, but it&#39;s tiring for them, and <br/>
difficult.  I&#39;m not sure how much longer they can stay, but I <br/>
appreciative of every minute, every day. <br/>
<br/>
I continue to be overwhelmed with the friends we have who have supported <br/>
us through this time.  We are indeed very rich people, in the best <br/>
meaning of that word.  Thank you everyone.  I can never repay or say <br/>
thank you enough, so I will simply vow to pass it on.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Lexie is outside in her wheelchair, in clothing.  This is a big deal. <br/>
&gt; No clothes fit over her cast, and a friend made her some wrap around<br/>
&gt; shorts that cover her as needed and are darn cute too!  She has that and<br/>
&gt; her DI tshirt on, and is not in her hospital bed with a sheet over<br/>
&gt; her--what this must be doing to her mentality, just to be out of bed<br/>
&gt; outside with her friend playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She has good spirits, loves to talk on the phone with folks that call,<br/>
&gt; and loves visitors, is eating better, especially at night, although we<br/>
&gt; are having issues with getting her vitamins down, she just doesn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; the flavor so we will try smooshing them again today and mixing them<br/>
&gt; with maybe yogurt or pudding.  She is pretty much pain free, except at<br/>
&gt; night a bit, and is getting really good at moving herself around,<br/>
&gt; getting to things on her table, and handling her personal needs (with<br/>
&gt; assistance, of course).  Lexie is going to get through this because she<br/>
&gt; is so strong and brave.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I told her that in the hospital and she forbid me to say it again.  She<br/>
&gt; said &quot;when you tell me I&#39;m strong and brave I think this is some huge<br/>
&gt; and horrible situation I have to deal with and that it will be hard, but<br/>
&gt; if you just tell me you love me then I know it&#39;s just a normal situation<br/>
&gt; I can handle.&quot;  Wisdom from my 9 year old.  So I will just tell you all<br/>
&gt; that she&#39;s strong and brave and I will just tell her I love her.  I did<br/>
&gt; find a way to crawl into bed with her to cuddle, something we have<br/>
&gt; missed dreadfully, and that has helped us both.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a cold as does Janene, but I&#39;m not surprised, between being<br/>
&gt; exposed to hospital germs and lack of sleep... I am catching up this<br/>
&gt; weekend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The things to over come still seem to be transportation and help with<br/>
&gt; home health care.  My mom isn&#39;t going to be able to do this for another<br/>
&gt; four weeks, or longer (I will talk to the doctor on Monday about what<br/>
&gt; the situation is when her cast is removed, will she be able to sit up<br/>
&gt; and be in a regular car seat?  I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;ll need to be pretty<br/>
&gt; much immobile for a while longer... If it&#39;s just a wheel chair and she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; sitting up then we may be able to return to our previous child care<br/>
&gt; situation before the injury...)  I am calling agency after agency, each<br/>
&gt; of whom just tells me to call another agency... Most of those calls are<br/>
&gt; stopped for the long weekend, but I will resume on Tuesday.  Kaiser is<br/>
&gt; open on Monday and I put a call in Friday night demanding that they help<br/>
&gt; with at least the transportation to the doctor and back as that is<br/>
&gt; medical necessary.  I told them that if I put her unsafely in my car<br/>
&gt; after THEY told me it was unsafe, and there was an accident, I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; that my car insurance would be quite interested in how a medical team<br/>
&gt; could allow a child to be transported unsafely... They tried to say the<br/>
&gt; trip home from the hospital (2nd hospital stay, I think some of you<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know she had to go in again last week, Sunday-Tuesday--she got a<br/>
&gt; new hot pink cast out of it!)  wasn&#39;t covered and I told them that about<br/>
&gt; my insurance and within an hour they had agreed to transport her home by<br/>
&gt; ambulance --the precedence has been set.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I need to go out to help her go on a walk... the wheel chair is<br/>
&gt; off center a bit because of her size, but it&#39;s the only one that will<br/>
&gt; fit her cast, so her friend can&#39;t take her without me there to help in<br/>
&gt; case there is a problem.  Thanks again for all your healing thoughts and<br/>
&gt; prayers and help with meals (the meals are an incredible help, I never<br/>
&gt; understood that before, but I do now!) and all the other help people are<br/>
&gt; giving.<br/>

1/2 times the length of gestation while smaller mammals nurse less... It <br/>
just is funny to see these HUGE hamster babies nursing, and so many of them!<br/>

Lexie now has email.  Well, she had it before but it is now working on <br/>

&gt;&gt; shorts that cover her as needed and are darn cute too!  She has that and<br/>
&gt;&gt; her DI tshirt on, and is not in her hospital bed with a sheet over<br/>
&gt;&gt; her--what this must be doing to her mentality, just to be out of bed<br/>
&gt;&gt; outside with her friend playing.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; She has good spirits, loves to talk on the phone with folks that call,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and loves visitors, is eating better, especially at night, although we<br/>
&gt;&gt; are having issues with getting her vitamins down, she just doesn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt;&gt; the flavor so we will try smooshing them again today and mixing them<br/>
&gt;&gt; with maybe yogurt or pudding.  She is pretty much pain free, except at<br/>
&gt;&gt; night a bit, and is getting really good at moving herself around,<br/>
&gt;&gt; getting to things on her table, and handling her personal needs (with<br/>
&gt;&gt; assistance, of course).  Lexie is going to get through this because she<br/>
&gt;&gt; is so strong and brave.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I told her that in the hospital and she forbid me to say it again.  She<br/>
&gt;&gt; said &quot;when you tell me I&#39;m strong and brave I think this is some huge<br/>
&gt;&gt; and horrible situation I have to deal with and that it will be hard, but<br/>
&gt;&gt; if you just tell me you love me then I know it&#39;s just a normal situation<br/>
&gt;&gt; I can handle.&quot;  Wisdom from my 9 year old.  So I will just tell you all<br/>
&gt;&gt; that she&#39;s strong and brave and I will just tell her I love her.  I did<br/>
&gt;&gt; find a way to crawl into bed with her to cuddle, something we have<br/>
&gt;&gt; missed dreadfully, and that has helped us both.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I have a cold as does Janene, but I&#39;m not surprised, between being<br/>
&gt;&gt; exposed to hospital germs and lack of sleep... I am catching up this<br/>
&gt;&gt; weekend.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The things to over come still seem to be transportation and help with<br/>
&gt;&gt; home health care.  My mom isn&#39;t going to be able to do this for another<br/>
&gt;&gt; four weeks, or longer (I will talk to the doctor on Monday about what<br/>
&gt;&gt; the situation is when her cast is removed, will she be able to sit up<br/>
&gt;&gt; and be in a regular car seat?  I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;ll need to be pretty<br/>
&gt;&gt; much immobile for a while longer... If it&#39;s just a wheel chair and she&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; sitting up then we may be able to return to our previous child care<br/>
&gt;&gt; situation before the injury...)  I am calling agency after agency, each<br/>
&gt;&gt; of whom just tells me to call another agency... Most of those calls are<br/>
&gt;&gt; stopped for the long weekend, but I will resume on Tuesday.  Kaiser is<br/>
&gt;&gt; open on Monday and I put a call in Friday night demanding that they help<br/>
&gt;&gt; with at least the transportation to the doctor and back as that is<br/>
&gt;&gt; medical necessary.  I told them that if I put her unsafely in my car<br/>
&gt;&gt; after THEY told me it was unsafe, and there was an accident, I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt;&gt; that my car insurance would be quite interested in how a medical team<br/>
&gt;&gt; could allow a child to be transported unsafely... They tried to say the<br/>
&gt;&gt; trip home from the hospital (2nd hospital stay, I think some of you<br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know she had to go in again last week, Sunday-Tuesday--she got a<br/>
&gt;&gt; new hot pink cast out of it!)  wasn&#39;t covered and I told them that about<br/>
&gt;&gt; my insurance and within an hour they had agreed to transport her home by<br/>
&gt;&gt; ambulance --the precedence has been set.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Well, I need to go out to help her go on a walk... the wheel chair is<br/>
&gt;&gt; off center a bit because of her size, but it&#39;s the only one that will<br/>
&gt;&gt; fit her cast, so her friend can&#39;t take her without me there to help in<br/>
&gt;&gt; case there is a problem.  Thanks again for all your healing thoughts and<br/>
&gt;&gt; prayers and help with meals (the meals are an incredible help, I never<br/>
&gt;&gt; understood that before, but I do now!) and all the other help people are<br/>
&gt;&gt; giving.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141175087">Hey everyone<br/>
<br/>
A few people have asked me to post a general update, so...<br/>
<br/>
Lexie got her cast off today.  I have been warning her that she would <br/>
not go from a cast to playing soccer, and she understood that at some <br/>
level but I don&#39;t think she really did understand it.  (I don&#39;t think I <br/>
did either.)  She was scared and moving the hip for the first time <br/>
hurt.  Using crutches was hard, but by this afternoon, when she took her <br/>
bath, it was easier.  I think within a week she&#39;ll be more confident.  <br/>
Her right knee is actually more painful at this point, because it&#39;s been <br/>
in one position as well.  I can massage that, and that will help.  Her <br/>
skin is terribly dry. <br/>
<br/>
The doctor said no weight on that one leg (right) for a month and then <br/>
maybe, depending upon xrays at that point, we&#39;ll let her start walking <br/>
with a walker.  She is getting a different wheel chair, her size, not <br/>
the adult wide one she has now, which was necessary to fit her cast.  <br/>
She can sit up straight, and I can get her into the van without help, so <br/>
transportation will be easier.  She can now use the crutches to get into <br/>
the bathroom and take a bath (she soaked for at least 20 minutes today <br/>
and would have stayed longer except she was extremely tired) and use the <br/>
bathroom.  She should also be getting a walker, which the doctor says <br/>
she might find easier than crutches, especially for helping her get up <br/>
and sit down.  I took the shower doors off the bathtub and that helped <br/>
get her out (I took them off while she was IN the tub, not something I <br/>
recommend but we didn&#39;t think about the need to take them off until we <br/>
saw her get in, and realized how much easier it would be for her to get <br/>
in and out if they were off). <br/>
<br/>
The good news, at least tentatively, is that the bone in her hip doesn&#39;t <br/>
appear to be dying.  We will still need to wait another six weeks, to <br/>
make sure this is the case, but the preliminary report looks good.  The <br/>
bone is also obviously healing. <br/>
<br/>
After getting her cast off, we went out to eat and then Lexie went to <br/>
barnes and noble to spend a gift card.  She was able to buy four items <br/>
with the card, including a book on chocolate! <br/>
<br/>
Thank you everyone for your prayers and healing light.  We are getting <br/>
through this, thanks to friends and family like all of you. <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s great news that the hip bone seems to be healing well! My son broke<br/>
his leg last year and was in a cast for about a month, but his healing<br/>
process wasn&#39;t as long as your daughter&#39;s. I remember, though, after his<br/>
cast was off and how wary we both were about using the leg again and<br/>
worrying about injuring it again. It made me a little nervous when he<br/>
continued walking around as if he had a cast on, but he did adjust quickly<br/>
to being cast-less.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully everything continues to go well! It sounds as if you&#39;ve been quite<br/>
creative in helping her continue to adjust.<br/>

Thanks for sharing, I&#39;ll share this with Lexie.  We found out today <br/>
about another child who stepped off a truck back and broke BOTH hips, <br/>
same location as Lexie.  She is 20something now and is doing grand!  She <br/>
had some issues with mobility but she never let it bother her.   It&#39;s <br/>
good to hear these stories.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074962527">A couple people have asked me for an update, so here is one...<br/>
<br/>
Lexie is doing fairly well.  Her cast has been off for over three weeks, <br/>
and she&#39;s getting around pretty good on one leg.  She will not use the <br/>
crutches at all, will only use the walker and wheel chair.  However, <br/>
she&#39;s pretty good at those things.  She is back in charge of her own <br/>
personal bodily needs, which is a big deal to all of us.  She is eating <br/>
better, as she is moving around more.  She is very good at doing her <br/>
exercises for PT, and her range of motion is really improving.  She can <br/>
get up and down steps, her PT person said it was a bit unorthodox and <br/>
sorta weird, but very safe and if the method made Lexie comfortable then <br/>
it was OK.  She basically sits down and goes down the steps until she is <br/>
near the bottom then stands up and uses her walker.  I liked the <br/>
unorthodox and weird comment, because basically that is Lexie in a <br/>
nutshell--weird and unorthodox.  She is back to doing chores, which she <br/>
enjoyed the first day or two but then didn&#39;t like it.  She can make her <br/>
own pancakes, do the dishes, and help clean up a bit.  She complains <br/>
that sometimes that I treat her too much like she can walk and run, but <br/>
I like that complaint better than the one that I treat her like she can <br/>
do nothing.  The other day she made me pancakes and using the wheel <br/>
chair delivered me another one (I was lying in her bed so she delivered <br/>
me breakfast in bed) on the spatula.  I thought it was pretty good that <br/>
she could steer the wheel chair with a pancake on a spatula through the <br/>
kitchen into the livingroom.  :-) <br/>
<br/>
Next week we will get another xray, and will know more about the bone.  <br/>
We will also know if she can put weight on the leg.  At first it will be <br/>
only a small amount of weight, but the PT person feels she&#39;ll be running <br/>
around playing soccer in September.  <br/>
<br/>
I think one of the most amazing things about this whole thing is the <br/>
education that has come as a result of it all, not just for us, for <br/>
Lexie, Janene and myself, but for everyone who has come in contact with <br/>
Lexie.  The other night she had a sleep over with three friends, and I <br/>
came out to find one girl in bed with Lexie (better to see the <br/>
computer), the other one standing over them from behind the bed, and the <br/>
third in the wheelchair next to the bed looking on.  I&#39;ve watched her <br/>
friends help her get in and out of bed, use the restroom, get up and <br/>
down the stairs.  Her neighborhood friend was very worried at first, but <br/>
now is an old pro with Lexie.  Lexie goes over to Dana&#39;s house with Dana <br/>
helping, carrying the walker.  Dana can help get Lexie into her own <br/>
house as well as Lexie&#39;s house. Lexie has cared for babies in her wheel <br/>
chair and in her hospital bed.  It&#39;s been an amazing thing to witness, <br/>
and I know I&#39;m not giving the situation justice with my words.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s it for tonight, I must get ready for school tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again, everyone, for all you do.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199937748">Hello everyone<br/>
<br/>
Lexie went to the doctor today and had an xray.  The good news is... the <br/>
bone continues to heal well.  There seems to be no problem with the <br/>
bone, it does not appear to be dying.  There is still a chance this <br/>
might happen, but with each week it doesn&#39;t happen, the chance gets <br/>
slimmer and slimmer.  The fact there is still good obvious blood flow to <br/>
the bone and that there is no white on the xray (indicating calcium <br/>
build up) and that the bone definition is solid (ie, it&#39;s a clear curve <br/>
around the top, and around where the break occured) gives us great <br/>
hope.  The doctor said that he couldn&#39;t even find the break line, it has <br/>
healed so well.  Two xrays were taken and we both looked, but couldn&#39;t <br/>
find the line, which indicates that the bone is healing very well.  The <br/>
pins are HUGE , though.  They will come out in about a year.  Lexie has <br/>
permission to begin putting a bit of weight on the leg.  We had <br/>
discussed weeks ago they&#39;d begin really slowly, but it seems that she <br/>
has healed so well, we are moving a bit faster.  She can put about 50% <br/>
of her weight on her leg for about two weeks, using the walker.  After <br/>
that, she can move to walking slowly, without the walker.  She is not <br/>
allowed to run, jump, skip, or move any faster than a slow walk without <br/>
the walker until he sees her in a month and does another xray.  We have <br/>
an order for water therapy, but now we have to find a place and get <br/>
Kaiser to pay for it. <br/>
<br/>
Ten years ago today I was in labor with Lexie.  In retrospect, I handled <br/>
her birth wrong, and after two and a half days of labor, Lexie was born <br/>
by c-section.  I don&#39;t think I will ever have the chance to have a <br/>
vaginal birth, or another child, and I do and will always miss not being <br/>
able to give birth vaginally, but now, ten years later, I don&#39;t care.  I <br/>
have a beautiful and wonderful child who is growing into a wonderful <br/>
young lady.  She stuck with DI throughout the last ten weeks, when she <br/>
very well could have quit and no one would have thought badly of that <br/>
choice.  But she never even considered quitting.  She participated in a <br/>
DI creativity day while she was in a body cast, and then returned four <br/>
weeks later to participate in the tournament in a wheel chair, unable to <br/>
even put that foot on the floor.  Her team was just as wonderful, no one <br/>
suggested they go on without Lexie, but instead they personified what <br/>
Destination Imagination stands for and remained a team through what was <br/>
not an easy time for any of of them.  Even though they did not win an <br/>
award, they are all winners, and I am trying to figure out how to <br/>
recognize them as such.  They not only accepted Lexie in a wheel chair <br/>
but they used the wheel chair as a side trip to their challenge!  Lexie <br/>
is very lucky to be a part of a true team, The Tiny Tigers. <br/>
<br/>
Lexie has also done so well in her recovery.  Yes, there has been low <br/>
moments, and low days.  She has cried, and become angry with her <br/>
situation.  But for the most  part she has been a remarkable young lady <br/>
who has taken a difficult time and done the best with it.  She has <br/>
always done her excersizes to the best of her ability, and the result is <br/>
good healing and now the ability to begin walking again.  She has <br/>
followed the rules of no weight on one leg to the point of almost <br/>
obsessiveness, knowing that following those rules was the best way to <br/>
get an optomal outcome.  Now she is stepping carefully into the next <br/>
part of her recovery, with both feet and both legs.  I have never been <br/>
prouder of my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is about Lexie but I have to take a minute and talk about <br/>
Janene.  She has also been pretty amazing.  She has helped her sister, <br/>
almost always when asked just once, as well as she could.  This six year <br/>
old even learned to help Lexie use the bathroom using a bedpan, so that <br/>
I could stay in the bath a few minutes longer (this was without my <br/>
knowledge, I only figured it out when Janene came into the bathroom to <br/>
empty the bedpan!)  She has been encouraging and only once or twice <br/>
hijacked her sister&#39;s walker or wheelchair or hospital bed for her own <br/>
use.  She has brought Lexie water and liquid, books, computer, played <br/>
games with her sister, and handled the last few months, when our family <br/>
has been in so much stress, amazingly well.  I am proud and lucky she is <br/>
my daughter. <br/>
<br/>
We have also learned how &quot;handicapped accessable&quot; means pretty much <br/>
nothing in many cases.  I will never look at a handicap stall in the <br/>
same way again, nor will I do any small thing, from shopping to using <br/>
the restroom in a public place, without looking upon a person in a <br/>
wheelchair with new respect. <br/>
<br/>
As a family of three, without Mark, we have formed a bond with each <br/>
other, and have learned how strong we can be.   I am very sorry that we <br/>
have had to go through all of this, from Lexie&#39;s accident, to Mark&#39;s <br/>
leaving, to Addy (our dog&#39;s) tragic and horrible death, but we have come <br/>
through stronger in so many ways.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most important ways is the confirmation of our friends and <br/>
family. It was an amazing process to see just how many friends we have.  <br/>
Thank you all for all of your help.  This journey toward Lexie&#39;s <br/>
complete recovery is not over yet, but the worst is over, and it is <br/>
thanks to all of you that we made it through that worst.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
I could have made it without your support and help.  I wish I could <br/>
write individual, personalized notes to each and every one of you, and <br/>
maybe one day I will be able to do that, but for now please know I thank <br/>
you in my heart each night.  Every bit of the support was appreciated, <br/>
from the physical support of meals and help with errands and help with <br/>
Janene, to the emotional support of private conversations and public <br/>
emails, to the private support of precious prayers and healing and <br/>
calming thoughts and candles lit in our names.  All of it has been <br/>
noticed and appreciated.  Thank you. <br/>
<br/>
And I do know now that Lexie will completely recover.  That is a <br/>
certainty in my head as much as I am certain the sun will rise tomorrow <br/>
and that my little girl will be ten on Wednesday at 12:25 pm.  Ten years <br/>
old, two numbers, an entire decade.  Amazing, I look at her and am <br/>
amazed that I created this life inside my body and now I have such <br/>
little control over it, as she grows to womanhood, that is as it should <br/>
be.  Lexie will be an amazing woman--look out world, here she comes!<br/>
<br/>
I am crying now, and so I will say thank you again.  I&#39;ll send another <br/>
update next month, when we hope to get further good news, and maybe the <br/>
posibility of a bit more activity. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>
 Joylyn<br/>
