So does lobotomy for the lobotomy-ee.<br/>
<br/>
IF I were going to be a good Christian, I&#39;d probably go with the submissive <br/>
deal, though, because then you can blame your husband for absolutely <br/>
EVERYTHING.  I think valium would make the submission go down better.  And it <br/>
IS kind of a retro thing altogether.  Valium.  Or codein.  Or opium (casting <br/>
back through the years for the stupification of choice for women who can <br/>
afford the very numBEST).<br/>

anymore&quot;, I was talking about Laudanum. I don&#39;t think that is made anymore. I <br/>
remember reading a book (well lots of books where people took this.) about <br/>
Wyatt Earp and his wife was supposedly addicted to Laudanum. Laudanum was <br/>
made from opium and with the advances in medicine, since opium is so <br/>
addictive, medicine isn&#39;t made from opium derivatives anymore. <br/>
