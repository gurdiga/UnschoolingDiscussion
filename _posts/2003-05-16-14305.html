<div id="ygrps-yiv-537805448">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoppin on here to ask for some support I guess. Maybe I just need to not <br/>
be wigging out. Kass & Kree, 11 yo twin dd&#39;s, asked today if I could start <br/>
giving them spelling tests. I was taken aback and said, &quot;Sure, if that&#39;s what <br/>
you want....&quot; They said they don&#39;t want to write out definitions and they <br/>
don&#39;t want to write them 3 times each or anything like that, but that they <br/>
would like to write a sentence using each word. I&#39;m torn between wondering if <br/>
they are feeling like they are behind in something, (they have been playing <br/>
with the kid next door whom we, dh & I can&#39;t stand) or if they are just <br/>
leading themselves in wanting to pursue mastering spelling. I don&#39;t want to <br/>
make a big deal about it and have them think I don&#39;t want them to learn these <br/>
things, but they specifcally said test and my hair on the back of my neck <br/>
stood up. Yuck, was all I could think. So when I get done writing this I will <br/>
begin to make up a list of words, but any feed back from you all would be <br/>
greatly appreciated. I asked them why they wanted to do this and they said <br/>
they were bored today and were thinking if they had words to study, they <br/>
could be doing that. I don&#39;t buy that as the true reason, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>
disuede them from learning irregardless.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

&lt;&lt; hey said they don&#39;t want to write out definitions and they <br/>
don&#39;t want to write them 3 times each or anything like that, but that they <br/>
would like to write a sentence using each word. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Spelling was FUN for me when I was a kid!  And maybe they&#39;ll be interested in <br/>
spelling-bee stuff!!  <br/>
<br/>
There are probably some lists online somewhere that are &quot;ordered&quot; by <br/>
difficulty, and maybe you could come up with ten words and let them eliminate <br/>
words they already know, if they want to.<br/>
<br/>
See if they can use more than one word in a sentence (instead of one sentence <br/>
with each word, which is boring).  Two, or five or ALL the words in a <br/>
sentence!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So when I get done writing this I will <br/>
begin to make up a list of words, but any feed back from you all would be <br/>
greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do they want to do written tests or &quot;spelling bee&quot;?  You should try both and <br/>
see which one they like, and they can be analytical about why one or the <br/>
other is easier for them, or maybe BOTH will be fun and easy!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t buy that as the true reason, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>
disuede them from learning irregardless.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about why.  Either it will be a blast and they&#39;ll do it for <br/>
years, or they&#39;ll get tired of it in a couple of days, or somewhere between.  <br/>

<br/>
I always loved spelling or anything to do with language. I appreciate your <br/>
ideas. I had just mentioned to them maybe it would be fun to try to make a <br/>
story out of the words and use as many as possible in a sentence. We decided <br/>
to do words that are easily mistaken i.e.bare / bear. These are words they <br/>
already know how to spell although I threw some in that they may not know. I <br/>
just want them to be having fun with it and not measure themselves against <br/>
the kid next door. <br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t believe this though, no sooner than I came up with words, Kree <br/>
walked in and said, &quot;Oh yeah can we do some Math tests too?&quot; I couldn&#39;t take <br/>
it and broke down with, &quot;Is someone making you feel like you need these <br/>
tests, where is this coming from?&quot; I got, &quot;No we just feel like it.&quot; I <br/>
resolved to accept that answer although I still think it comes from somewhere <br/>
else.  I also know that this may be a phase thing and if not, who cares. You <br/>
can never know too many words.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx,<br/>

  greatly appreciated. I asked them why they wanted to do this and they said <br/>
  they were bored today and were thinking if they had words to study, they <br/>
  could be doing that. I don&#39;t buy that as the true reason, but I don&#39;t want to <br/>
  disuede them from learning irregardless.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks in advance,<br/>

Thank you, Sandra.  Who knew that there were people posting their magnet<br/>
poetry on the internet?  I shoulda been able to deduce that, since<br/>
everything is on the internet.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t phrase my question clearly.  I&#39;m trying to figure out if they<br/>
sell blank sheets of the magnet stuff that I can write my own words on. <br/>
Long ago, I think I had a friend who did some kind of scrapbooking thing<br/>
where she cut out the outlines of photos of her kids using this thin,<br/>
flexible magnet backing.  So maybe I should look in scrapbooking stores<br/>
or in the scrapbooking section of the craft store.  I can also go to the<br/>
craft store and wave my hands around a lot and see if they can figure<br/>
out what I want. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

begin to make up a list of words, but any feed back from you all would be <br/>
greatly appreciated.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do they want to do written tests or &quot;spelling bee&quot;?  You should try both and <br/>
see which one they like, and they can be analytical about why one or the <br/>
other is easier for them, or maybe BOTH will be fun and easy!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another Mom from our support group, although she is a school at homer, has a <br/>
child that loves to spell.  They will spell things out to each other instead <br/>
of talking.  It is so funny to watch and listen too.  The daughter will spell <br/>
out a question and the mother will spell back the answer.  This is one of the <br/>
things that isn&#39;t required.  Didn&#39;t want to make her sound too bad.  This was <br/>
something the Mom told us the child wanted to do.<br/>

Could you print your poetic words out on some label paper and slap it on<br/>
the magnetic sheet, then cut them out?   I don&#39;t know, but now I&#39;ll<br/>
probably have to try that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184921203">Thank you to everyone who responded to my worry. I guess I needed to sleep <br/>
the worry off. I love that they want to spell and plan to support it however <br/>
they wish. More than anything I guess I was more concerned with the reason <br/>
behind it. That probably has more to do with the girls playing with a child I <br/>
don&#39;t personally like than about learning. But I guess there is a lesson in <br/>
that too. Perhaps I need to sit back and let them see what attributes this <br/>
child displays that make us not like him. However, when they do play with <br/>
him, we notice an immediate change in their demeanor and it&#39;s not for the <br/>
positive. So I think I&#39;m really on the fence about their choice in friends. <br/>
<br/>
Thanx again,<br/>
