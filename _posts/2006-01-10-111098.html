   <br/>
  Logan is riding Megan&#39;s bike through the living room. I just dialed Grandma&#39;s number for Megan to leave a message for her, and Gracie is watching the Disney Channel while standing on her scooter taking a break from scootering through the house. I&#39;m reading one of Sarah&#39;s &quot;Diaries of America&quot; books, and Paul is napping on the couch.<br/>
   <br/>
  How about you? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s 11:09 p.m.  Kirby is making deviled eggs with eggs he and four  <br/>
other teens walked to buy.  I put a $10 bill into Holly&#39;s hands and  <br/>
said to buy better eggs than the cheapest, and she brought the $10  <br/>
back saying Kirby still had change from money I had given him and  <br/>
Marty to go up the tram yesterday.   Marty is asleep because he goes  <br/>
to work at 6:30 a.m.  He went on the egg run (to the store where he  <br/>
works) and went to sleep when they got back.  He was asleep by  <br/>
10:00.  The other kids are talking to Kirby while he works, one is  <br/>
finding a container because there are more eggs than they can finish,  <br/>
one is on a computer and singing...  Oh.  While the eggs were boiling  <br/>
I think, or maybe just before they went to the store) they played  <br/>
Five Crowns.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667368317">At the time I first read this most of us had just finished watching  &quot;Star <br/>
Wars III.&quot;  Much to my surprise I found out our adopted sons have  never seen <br/>
the first, second, or third Star Wars (techincally, IV, V, and VI,  the ones <br/>
with Harrison Ford) and were VERY happy to know there&#39;s more to the  story.  <br/>
Husband is going to rent it on the way home from the doctor  this morning.  We <br/>
talked about special effects, what people expected  &quot;back then&quot; from the future, <br/>
how when we were at Disneyworld we rode the &quot;people  movers&quot; and that it&#39;s <br/>
kind of comical (Tomorrowland) what people thought the  future would be like (no <br/>
sidewalks, just people movers carting everyone  around..LOL)<br/>
 <br/>
Two boys came in from the new skatepark.  First time going  there.  They were <br/>
timid about going, saw a bunch of kids they  &quot;thought&quot; would be standoffish <br/>
to them, but came home TOTALLY STOKED  because everyone there was so friendly, <br/>
nice, and SOOOO MUCH like them!   (lots of kids that like punk, rock, <br/>
alternative stuff.)  <br/>
 <br/>
They were afraid to ride some of the ramps, but all the kids there were  <br/>
saying stuff like, &quot;Oh go ahead!  We wipe out all the time, no one will  laugh&quot; at <br/>
which time another kid showed them by trying a trick and falling on  his <br/>
butt.  My son said, surprisingly, there are more older guys  than young (say, 18 <br/>
to 25).  They are still excited about it this  morning!<br/>
 <br/>
I had sat down to try and get our local homeschool yahoo list people to  <br/>
actually vote on something (the group has been slowly dying for a while and a  few <br/>
of us are trying to revive it, hoping to make it more inclusive, less  <br/>
structured, just fun.) <br/>
 <br/>
15 yo daughter is staying the night with unschooling friend who just got  <br/>
back from Peru (she&#39;s 17, her and her 19 yo sister went there for  Christmas.)<br/>

tales mixed up together!!&quot;) and then Bobo-bo-bo-Bobobo, and Andrew<br/>

books to read, and is now cocooned in his room on his couch under his<br/>
blanket reading away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122140060">9-11pm: 3 children go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I bring the pajamas into the living room, help the younger two <br/>
change, bring toothbrushes from the bathroom and brush, turn off the <br/>
bright lights, stroke hair, snuggle.<br/>
<br/>
First Evan, 9 months, puts his toy down, rubs his face and fusses <br/>
once. Very quickly he is snuggled in my arms nursing.<br/>
<br/>
Then I make &quot;nests&quot; with pillows, blankets and favorite bears. Mikey <br/>
(5)is watching Jetix shows. As he gets tired, he moves from sitting <br/>
up to leaning on the pillow (on the couch), to lying down. He asks <br/>
me to come snuggle and I sit next to him and stoke his hair as he <br/>
goes to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Caroline (3) climbs into her nest on the recliner, but is still wide <br/>
awake. She plays by herself, then talks to me, plays more and <br/>
finally climbs into my lap. She wiggles and thrashes around as I try <br/>
to keep my chin up to avoid getting bonked with her head--snuggling <br/>
with her can be painful if I&#39;m not careful! I wrap my blanket around <br/>
her and she burrows and falls asleep. When I start to get up to <br/>
carry her upstairs, I find that she is so wrapped up in the blanket <br/>
that I can&#39;t figure out how to unwrap her! She had been <br/>
experimenting earlier with blanket wrapping, asking us if she looked <br/>
like a mummy this way or that way. I think she figured it out pretty <br/>
well, lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485385663">Had to wait to write this post as Jessy 14 was on<br/>
Ruinscape. Robby 12 in the basement watching<br/>
Mythbusters with his dog. Levi 11and Tycen 7 on the<br/>
gamecube attempting to save King Kong from death. They<br/>
finished the game, but saw if you did some extra stuff<br/>
you could keep the ape from dying. Ashton 10 doing<br/>
ballet around the living room floor. Olivia 5 has 14<br/>
or 15 stuffed animals lines around the floor to watch<br/>
Ashtons performance. Megan 16 is on the phone with her<br/>
friend Caleb. While she is chatting she is making her<br/>
lunch for her CNA classes tomorrow.<br/>
That is it from here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152852923">my ds, 10, is in the kitchen fixing a Carnation instant breakfast<br/>
drink.  (It is 11:20 p.m.)  His friend is in his room playing Kirby<br/>
air ride on Gamecube.  My dd, 7, is spending the night with a friend.<br/>
 So I&#39;m able to spend lots of time catching up on this list!  My dh is<br/>
asleep :)<br/>
<br/>
earlier today:<br/>
I overslept & missed the early church service.  I had planned to go &<br/>
even went to bed at a reasonable hour (midnight) AND set my alarm<br/>
clock (which I rarely do).  But when it went off, I turned it off &<br/>
went back to sleep LOL.  And then had a scary dream that woke me up. <br/>
It was very vivid!<br/>
<br/>
My dd & I got up & hurriedly got ready so we could meet our church<br/>
friends at a local mosque where we were scheduled to have a tour.  It<br/>
was pretty boring for her, but I enjoyed it & she managed to sit<br/>
through it.  Afterwards we got snacks and then we went to the Family<br/>
Arts Festival downtown.  She did several art projects, did some<br/>
gymnastics with the Danish gymnastics team, stood in line to get her<br/>
face painted while I shopped at the &#39;friends of the library&#39; book<br/>
table.  I found 4 kids books - 3 with the cassette tapes, for only 50<br/>
cents each!  I was so excited.  Two of them are books my ds likes -<br/>
we&#39;ve gotten them at the library: &quot;Ping&quot; and &quot;The Last Dragon&quot;.   Dd<br/>
decided to leave the face painting line (it was REALLY long) & did<br/>
some more gymnastics.  Then we stopped at a art table & she made a<br/>
birthday card for her friend.  Then I bought her an icee and we<br/>
stopped and said hi to some homeschool friends.  And rolled down the<br/>
hill a few times.  And then had to take the prickly stickers out of<br/>
her skirt collected from rolling down the hill.  Then we left for the<br/>
birthday party where we met dh & ds.  It was cold & windy, but we<br/>
managed to stay at the park for 2 hours (we&#39;re in Tucson AZ so realize<br/>
when I say cold, I mean cold for Tucson LOL).  I came home with ds&#39;<br/>
friend & dd went home with the birthday girl.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1351655971">It&#39;s 7:13 PM and I&#39;m getting ready to pick up Jacqueline from Brownies. <br/>
Cimion just had some chili with cheese on top and some crackers on the <br/>
side and now I hear him doing the dishes. Shawna must be done with her <br/>
shower because I don&#39;t hear the water on anymore. (I only help her when <br/>
she washes her hair). Billy (my husband) is picking up Aunt Mary from <br/>
the airport. <br/>
