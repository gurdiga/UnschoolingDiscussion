<div id="ygrps-yiv-716318130">Hi Buzz (Debbie),<br/>
My kids and I participated in a hatching last year.  We got the still air<br/>
incubators & the eggs from the extension agent and a short lesson from<br/>
someone with the University.  My children quickly bored with turning the<br/>
eggs 3 times a day (they were at that time 6 & 2) so I did all &quot;the work&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We did not hatch any of our eggs....all the literature we received from the<br/>
extension office said they would hatch in 21 days.  At day 24 I got rid of<br/>
the eggs because I was afraid they would hatch & the chicks would be<br/>
malformed.  Later I found out from others in my group that their eggs were<br/>
very late in hatching.  I think our eggs were &quot;old&quot; since even those who<br/>
waited long enough only got aprx 2-5 chicks from 15 eggs.<br/>
<br/>
So, my advice, don&#39;t give up too soon.  I&#39;m sure we would have had chicks if<br/>
we had waited another day or so.  Also, be aware that you can&#39;t go out of<br/>
town without getting someone to &quot;babysit&quot; the eggs.<br/>
<br/>
Our brooder was a very sturdy cardboard box with shredded newspaper and a<br/>
clip on light above it.  Even though the kids tired of turning the eggs they<br/>
were VERY disappointed when we did not get chicks, they talked about them<br/>
all the time.  Planned for them all the time.  So I&#39;m sure your family will<br/>
enjoy the experience.<br/>
<br/>
