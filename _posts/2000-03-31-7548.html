<div id="ygrps-yiv-446752660">Glad some of you enjoyed the links :-) Yup, I&#39;m unschooling myself. I<br/>
decided I need a hobby. I need to use my brain for something other than<br/>
&quot;mommy mommy mommy&quot; all day long. Unfortunately, I need somthing I can<br/>
do with a very demanding, attention hungry, cute 17 m/o around! So I&#39;ve<br/>
been &quot;studying&quot;. Whatever gets my interest. For no particular reason, in<br/>
no particular order. I&#39;ve always loved astronomy but never really<br/>
studied it. At first I thought &quot;what are you going to do with this<br/>
info?&quot;. But then I realized the answer to that was &quot;enjoy it!&quot;. I&#39;m<br/>
having fun! We say part of unschooling is to have hobbies and interests<br/>
and passions that your kids can see you enjoying. I hope Bridget learns<br/>
to love astronomy too so we can share this! If not, oh well. *I* love it<br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, light pollution is pretty high where I am in Union<br/>
County, NJ. Ah well. I can make out Orion on a good night. But you can<br/>
also see the red glow from the nearby city. There is a local reservation<br/>
nearby where it&#39;s much better. I remember in the 80&#39;s going there to see<br/>
a commet (I have no memory of which one it was). So if we want to watch<br/>
the stars, we have to get in the car and take a short drive (less than<br/>
10 minutes) to do so. Standing in the yard only works on a very clear<br/>
night, and even then, we&#39;re missing so much. <br/>
<br/>
But I love the moon! Even w/light pollution you can still make out the<br/>
features :-) Maybe not if you are in an actual city, I guess (we&#39;re in<br/>
the suburbs). <br/>
<br/>
Jill &quot;keep looking up&quot;. Do you remember the name of that show? Where he<br/>
used to say that at the end every time? I used to love it! I wonder if<br/>
it&#39;s still on? (or maybe I&#39;m mis-remembering the quote?).<br/>
