I thought this would be of interest at this point in the discussion: <br/>
It&#39;s an editorial from Home Education Magazine, I forget the date, <br/>

Defining Unschooling<br/>
<br/>
by Helen Hegener<br/>
<br/>
	Over the past few months there has been a lot of discussion <br/>
in homeschooling circles about unschooling, what it is, what it <br/>
isn&#39;t, and how one does it - or doesn&#39;t. Workshops on unschooling <br/>
have become standard fare at homeschool conferences and conventions, <br/>
and several homeschooling publications have tried to define the word. <br/>
There are even derivatives now, like Christian unschooling and <br/>
structured unschooling and radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
	Unschooling is an interesting word, or at least I think it&#39;s <br/>
a word. How many people need to use a word, and more or less <br/>
understand and agree on what it means, before it officially joins our <br/>
language - as in it gets added to our dictionaries? I don&#39;t think the <br/>
word homeschooling was around for more than six or seven years before <br/>
it showed up in a major dictionary. Maybe with a few more years of <br/>
useage unschooling will join the ranks of publicly recognized and <br/>
respectable words.<br/>
<br/>
	But to be included in a dictionary, a word needs a <br/>
definition, and unschooling is a particularly difficult word to <br/>
define. Just last month there was a long and involved discussion <br/>
about what it means - and doesn&#39;t mean - on one of America Online&#39;s <br/>
homeschooling forums. There were those who felt unschooling totally <br/>
precludes the use of school-type materials, and those who said the <br/>
materials don&#39;t matter, it&#39;s your attitude that counts. From the <br/>
online discussions, one could gather that unschooling generally seems <br/>
to refer to the act of not learning in the same ways we were expected <br/>
to learn in school, i.e. with textbooks, workbooks, lesson plans, <br/>
drills and all the rest. But many avowed unschoolers said they do use <br/>
these handy educational tools, just not always in the ways they were <br/>
originally designed for.<br/>
<br/>
	Most unschoolers agree that it goes a little further than <br/>
that, tho, and can mean the entire process of shaking off schoolish <br/>
habits, patterns, and expectations. Of course others will say that <br/>
it&#39;s not a process at all, but just what they do with their kids <br/>
every day. It&#39;s their interactions, their interconnectedness, their <br/>
very lives.<br/>
<br/>
	In the Dec/Jan 1995 issue of Growing Without Schooling, <br/>
editor Susannah Sheffer had some interesting comments on the history <br/>
of the word &#39;homeschooling,&#39; and I was surprised to learn that <br/>
unschooling was actually the predecessor of that word. For a long <br/>
time now I&#39;ve thought it was the other way around!<br/>
<br/>
	Susannah noted that John Holt had used the word &#39;unschooling&#39; <br/>
in GWS #2, noting &quot;at the beginning Holt simply used it as a synonym <br/>
for what we now call homeschooling.&quot; She adds &quot;By issue #12, which <br/>
I&#39;d date at June 1979, you can see that the magazine was using <br/>
&#39;unschooling&#39; and &#39;homeschooling&#39; pretty much interchangeably, and <br/>
gradually the term &#39;homeschooling&#39; became the more common one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	Grace Llewellyn gives our term an interesting spin in The <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook. Throughout the book she prefers the term <br/>
unschooling, explaining early on that it has fewer negative <br/>
connotations than homeschooling. But in Chapter 11, on Legal Issues, <br/>
she writes: &quot;I am shifting my terminology a little. In this chapter, <br/>
I will mostly use the euphemism &#39;homeschooling&#39; rather than <br/>
&#39;unschooling.&#39; &#39;Unschooling&#39; is not a legally recognized term, and <br/>
probably never will be. Don&#39;t use it when you talk to schools, <br/>
courts, or legislators; it will confuse them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
	Well, maybe we shouldn&#39;t get our hopes up about getting it <br/>
into the dictionaries.<br/>
<br/>
	For that matter, do we even want official dictionary-style <br/>
recognition of the word&#39;s meaning? Unschooling means many things to <br/>
many people... that became quite obvious in the America Online <br/>
discussions. And that&#39;s part of its appeal. Each family, each <br/>
individual, can decide what they want it to mean for themselves <br/>
within a loosely-accepted larger context.<br/>
<br/>
	There&#39;s an odd dynamic at work in that once a word is <br/>
defined, it begins to lose its meaning through overuse, <br/>
overpopularity. The word homeschooling, officially recognized for <br/>
some time now, has been showing up in some strange places, most <br/>
notably as what parents do with their children after school and on <br/>
weekends. Because the term is widely recognized and accepted, it&#39;s <br/>
being used to stretch the meaning of other activities, with the very <br/>
real danger that the word&#39;s own original meaning will be completely <br/>
lost.<br/>
<br/>
	This has already happened with the term &#39;alternative <br/>
schools.&#39; Where that once meant schools which functioned outside the <br/>
educational bureaucracy, it now also means special public schools for <br/>
kids who don&#39;t fit well into the usual regimen. If one uses the term <br/>
alternative schools but means free schools, or student-participatory <br/>
schools, or any of the other originally accepted definitions, the <br/>
distinction needs to be made clear.<br/>
<br/>
	Unschooling is still a wonderfully nebulous term, subject to <br/>
individual interpretation. Homeschoolers can argue themselves in <br/>
circles about what it means, and that&#39;s as it should be. We need <br/>
words that are vague yet descriptive, changeable while unchanging. In <br/>
much the same way that homeschoolers have taken leave of the <br/>
educational bureaucracy, we&#39;ve taken leave of the English language <br/>
bureaucracy and are exploring new options in communication. We&#39;re <br/>
unschooling in the best sense of the word.</div>
