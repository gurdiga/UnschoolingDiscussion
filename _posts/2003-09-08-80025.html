<div id="ygrps-yiv-175435367">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Life got very crazy for us recently and I could not even keep up <br/>
with reading the emails, more or less posting so we dissapeared for <br/>
a while.  We just moved and that along with work and family life has <br/>
kept this summer busy and even forced us to miss the conference :(  <br/>
(which I am still bummed about!)  Life is seeming to settle and I am <br/>
missing all the great information and advice so I can&#39;t wait to get <br/>
reading.  With everyone arounf us back in school,  all those <br/>
anxieties are creeping in!!!  I am looking forward to much more <br/>
great wisdom and parenting help!!!<br/>
<br/>

in the same area? Welcome back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378547368">Hi Mary!<br/>
<br/>
We just moved about 10 minutes up the road although you think that <br/>
would make it easier!!  We are in East Boca now which seems to make <br/>
all the activities even further from HELPS.  We went to the picnic <br/>
yesterday which turned out to be great because there were a bunch of <br/>
boys all around 4-5 so Keiran has a blast and Pierce just thinks he <br/>
is one of the big kids so he loved it!<br/>
<br/>
