&gt;HELEN SAID:  Picture me sitting in a little Canadian lodge in the <br/>
&gt;middle of nowhere reading the messages I&#39;d downloaded in the last <br/>
&gt;&quot;big city.&quot;<br/>
&gt;KATE SAYS:  Helen --<br/>
&gt;I have never known envy before. . . .<br/>
&gt;I know it now. . . .<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mark got a call from his sister in Michigan yesterday - their mother, <br/>
whose health has been seriously compromised in recent weeks - had <br/>
what the doctors termed an &quot;incident of serious proportions&quot; <br/>
yesterday. She&#39;s old, very frail, and they&#39;re afraid it&#39;s only a <br/>
matter of time now. Mark wants to be able to be there within hours, <br/>
so I&#39;m flying to Alaska tomorrow evening. If he needs to fly to <br/>
Michigan I&#39;ll meet him back in Seattle en route...<br/>
<br/>
The adventure can wait. If my Dad weren&#39;t also in rough shape I&#39;d <br/>
probably not go at all, but my brothers advised me that it would <br/>
really be good for Dad to spend some time with me, and Mark agrees. <br/>
As the oldest I think he relies on me for a lot sometimes. Not more <br/>
than any of the other kids, but in different ways. My sister says Dad <br/>
keeps saying he has important stuff to talk to me about and frets <br/>
that he won&#39;t get the chance. Not the kind of stuff you can put in a <br/>
phone conversation, the kind of stuff you take a long drive into the <br/>
mountains for... At least that&#39;s how we do it in our family when we <br/>
need to connect on certain levels. We go out into the mountains, <br/>
where it&#39;s quiet and the only distractions are the incredible beauty <br/>
of a sunset or the northern lights. They can be awesome this time of <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. Just thought I&#39;d pop over and check the digest for my <br/>
favorite list. Found out last night that yesterday was the list&#39;s <br/>
third birthday: it was created April 11, 1999! Cool, eh? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Unschooling is what grownups do, all the time.  Why is it, then, <br/>
&gt;that any grownups (or politicians), think that schooling must be so <br/>
&gt;formulaic? . . . . .<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Training and conditioning. Our good friend John Taylor Gatto explains <br/>
that schools aren&#39;t failing, they&#39;re succeeding quite nicely at what <br/>
they were created to do:<br/>
