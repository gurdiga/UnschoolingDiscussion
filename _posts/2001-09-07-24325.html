<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123022408">I can relate to this :) Elly wanted to play with an Easy Bake Oven she got <br/>
for christmas from her auntie,(played with it once before this) she made one <br/>
tiny little cake, and then just made up all the the mixes and decided she <br/>
wanted to go watch her brother do his death defying tricks on the trampoline <br/>
:) I had a blast,( I couldnt let all the chocolate yummies go to waste!?) <br/>
each one little brownie, cake will fit in my mouth LOL anyway, had some <br/>
pretty cool little snacks for a little while :)<br/>
<br/>
Indiana Tami-who will prolly get something bizarre from eating all those <br/>
cakes made on top of a light bulb :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I am working on leaving things unfinished if I don&#39;t want to do them.<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me, I have this sort of completion compulsion. We do<br/>
currently have half-one bead and wax thingys that may never get done, I<br/>
didn&#39;t think they were much fun, anyway. I do reserve the right to ask<br/>
for clean-up help if neither of us plan to continue a project...<br/>
