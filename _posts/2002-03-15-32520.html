<div id="ygrps-yiv-28470501">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Iï¿½m sending in my experience of 5 years with a little boy who is fascinated <br/>
with guns. He does not listen well to no pointing or stop shooting people. <br/>
It is a constant battle. I thought when he was little I would be able to <br/>
steer him from gunplay. I have since learned I can not. I am intolerant to <br/>
people hurting people, animals, wildlife, and I have a son who is fascinated <br/>
with pointing and shooting. I continually remind him people will not like to <br/>
be pointed at. He holds his hand up and shoots at cars on drives sometimes. <br/>
Talk about worry. I have talked with him about hunting and using the animal <br/>
he has hunted. We now let him experience his shooting power with friends or <br/>
family members who are willing to play his game.<br/>
<br/>
I also have started showing him the history of guns and weapons. We look at <br/>
previous wars and civilizations to see what guns looked like, who they hurt. <br/>
When he is older, I will show him photos of gun wounds. A picture speaks way <br/>
more than my nagging. I can say I have learned to tune down my reaction to <br/>
his play. I have also found acceptable shooting actions. When he is fixated <br/>
with shooting, I usually join in and try to suggest ideas like shooting <br/>
water to put out a raging fire, or shooting beautiful pictures with a <br/>
camera. We have a little digital hand camera which has been used a lot on <br/>
these shooting frenzies of his. A real tool, which makes a great noise and <br/>
produces cool movies.<br/>
<br/>
We have relaxed our attitude, tried to find acceptable substitutes and <br/>
continually remind him of the power of real live guns and the damage they <br/>
inflict when used.<br/>
<br/>
Without any true answers to this complex issue,<br/>
<br/>
