<div><font size="2">our hospital has one of the&nbsp;9 (I think) milk banks in the 
UK, yet my daughter received formula as her first meal.&nbsp; IMO, if she was 
poorly enough to be on SCBU, she was poorly enough to receive donor milk, 
otherwise she could ahve been with me on the ward and we could have got on with 
our lives.&nbsp; Just my experience.&nbsp; &lt;g&gt;</font></div>

<div><font size="2">PS&nbsp; I think all mothers who are capable of breastfeeding 
should at least TRY&nbsp;it for 4 to 6 weeks, since this is the general amount 
of time it takes for nursing to settle down, and it can take this amout of time 
to become established after any problems such as nipple confusion are 
resolved.&nbsp; After all, no-one knows what they&#39;re missing unless they try it 
:-)&nbsp; Doesn&#39;t mean I expect it to happen, mind you...</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>hi,<br><br>coincidentally here in austin we have a milk 
  bank, one of 5 nationally.&nbsp; last<br>night on the news they were calling 
  for donations because the drs have found<br>that it can literally be the 
  difference between life and death to a preemie with<br>intestinal problems and 
  the demand is growing exponentially so they are in<br>serious need for 
  donations.<br><br></tt></blockquote></span></blockquote></html>
