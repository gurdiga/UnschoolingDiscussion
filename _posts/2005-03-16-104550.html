<div id="ygrps-yiv-399163406">Heard on a country station:<br/>
 <br/>
So let them be little,<br/>
&#39;Cause they&#39;re only  that way for a while.<br/>
Give &#39;em hope, give them praise,<br/>
Give them love  every day.<br/>
Let &#39;em cry, let &#39;em giggle,<br/>
Let &#39;em sleep in the  middle,<br/>
Oh, but let them be little. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Cool.  I hardly ever listen to the radio,  much less country, but overheard <br/>
this and so looked it up.  <br/>
 <br/>
First found it quoted on a blog here, and that  was cool:<br/>

 <br/>
And their link led to the lyrics.<br/>
Billy Dean is the artist, but I didn&#39;t find credits for the lyrics nor a  <br/>
date.  Maybe it&#39;s new.<br/>
 <br/>
The full lyrics are here:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d think &quot;let them cry&quot; could be a problem until I remember  the &quot;shut up or <br/>
I&#39;ll give you something to cry about&quot; of my west Texas infancy,  and remember <br/>
that even &quot;let them cry&quot; can be a cutting-edge idea for people who  are used <br/>
to backhanding children for hardly any reason at all.   And  now in the same <br/>
verse, he&#39;s promoting the family bed!!  Co-sleeping for  cowboys.  GOOD.<br/>
 <br/>
Anything that helps Christian conservatives soften up toward kids is  <br/>
wonderful.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508589423">My children hardly cry also, but there are times like when the dog died. <br/>
I remember being 9 years old and the dog we had had as long as I could <br/>
remember, died. I cried my eyes out and my stepdad ridiculed me for <br/>
crying over a &quot;stupid&quot; dog. When our dog died last year my children <br/>
cried and we held them and allowed them to express their grief and <br/>
sadness. Some families don&#39;t allow you to show your pain. You know the <br/>
kind &quot;big boys don&#39;t cry&quot; and all that garbage.  I think this is the <br/>
kind of crying the singer was referring to.<br/>

Just as  a side note, Billy Dean was involved in an Attachment Parenting <br/>
International  fundraiser or something like that a few years ago, so I think y&#39;all <br/>
are on the  right track as far as the &quot;let &#39;em cry&quot; means let your child have <br/>
their own  emotions.<br/>

So is that song a few years old, or does he have other similar  <br/>
child-supportive songs?  <br/>
 <br/>
(Maybe both.  I was just surprised not to find more about that one  with a <br/>
google search, and no lyricist credit and no date.  Do you know if  he wrote it?)<br/>

I found more info at this link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1495751/20050111/lonestar.jhtml">http://www.cmt.com/news/articles/1495751/20050111/lonestar.jhtml</a><br/>
It appears that this is a new song that Billy Dean co-wrote with a member of the band, Lonestar.  BTW, Lonestar has a great song called &quot;Mr. Mom&quot; about a guy who loses his job and tries to be a stay at home dad.  The video is animated and hilarious (at least in the context of my husband attempting to even baby-sit our children.) <br/>
It is at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lonestar/artist.jhtml">http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/lonestar/artist.jhtml</a>  Enjoy!<br/>
