California where you can order Englsih food. Whenever I&#39;m feeling<br/>
homesick I order some stuff in. Having said that, I did bring back three<br/>
large suitcases full of english food after xmas. I have enough brown<br/>
sauce to bathe in :)<br/>

Raleys!! Well, there&#39;s one down the hill from us in<br/>
Chico. I&#39;ll go and check it out. I&#39;m sure I could find<br/>
a recipe if I tried, but I just haven&#39;t gotten around<br/>
to it. I got some Robertson&#39;s Lemon Curd from my local<br/>
Safeway. I used it to make lemon polenta cake. I also<br/>
made scones the other day. I&#39;m okay on the tea front<br/>

crumpets with lemon curds.<br/>
I have a good recipe for lemon curds, it saves a<br/>
bundle over buying it.<br/>
And I remember making crumpets when I was in 4-H, with<br/>
washed out tuna cans that had both sides cut out. Yes,<br/>
you can make a crumpet ring out of a tuna can!!!<br/>
How&#39;s that for money saving?<br/>
As to the recipe? I&#39;d hafta ask Mom.<br/>

In 3 years I can sit the citizenship exam and answer lots of inane<br/>
questions about American history and culture, then prove my mastery of<br/>
the english language (ahem), then I too will be a citizen. Apparently<br/>
there&#39;s some ceremony thing too (I&#39;ll have to dye my hair purple<br/>
especially - or red white and blue).<br/>

Our friends Helena and Leon took their nine year old.  She&#39;s really loving <br/>
it.  They were in Kirk Ella near Hull for a year, then York, and now London.  <br/>
So that doesn&#39;t help.  And their two year old was born two months before they <br/>
left, so he might end up being the one who&#39;s homesick when they move back to <br/>
New Mexico.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe when they have more new friends it will seem more homey and less <br/>
foreign, Shyrley.  Not just holidays, but winter could be making it worse.  <br/>
<br/>
I forgot where you are, but if you&#39;re in Maryland or Virginia, those places <br/>
seem oppressively AMERICAN to me when I&#39;m there.  And with the flags <br/>
everywhere, and the Smithsonian (which I love, but I might not love at all <br/>
the same way if I were NOT American), maybe a trip to parts of the country <br/>
that aren&#39;t quite so focussed on national, national, national could help.<br/>
<br/>
And if you&#39;re already elsewhere I don&#39;t know what to say about that aspect.<br/>

Guess I&#39;ll have to make my own.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sentiments exactly! Here&#39;s a recipe that&#39;s been<br/>
converted to American measurements (for those of you<br/>
without scales!).<br/>
 <br/>
Crumpets:<br/>
<br/>
What it takes:<br/>
*	450 grams (3 cups) plain white or untreated flour <br/>
*	2 teaspoons (10 grams) dry active yeast <br/>
*	2 3/4 cups of warm water <br/>
*	Optional (1.5 teasopoons bread improver - if you<br/>
have it available) <br/>
*	1.5 teaspoons salt <br/>
*	1 teaspoon of sugar or honey <br/>
*	2 tablespoons powdered milk <br/>
*	1 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda <br/>
*	2 tablespoons of warm water <br/>
<br/>
The Method:<br/>
Combine yeast, sugar and one cup of warm water into a<br/>
mixng bowl. The water should be hot enough to take a<br/>
bath in, but not hot enough to scald. Cover with<br/>
plastic wrap an stand in a warm place for about ten<br/>
minutes. During this time the liquid should develop a<br/>
foamy head, showing that the yeast is dissolved and<br/>
happy.. <br/>
<br/>
Sift flour, milk and salt into another bowl, and mix<br/>
well. (NB. Please resist the temptation to eliminate<br/>
the salt, as the yeast need a small amount of salt to<br/>
do their job properly.) Make a well in the centre of<br/>
the flour, add the yeasty water and the rest of the<br/>
warm water. <br/>
<br/>
Using a wooden spoon, mix to a thick batter. Cover<br/>
with plastic wrap, and stand in a warm place until<br/>
well risen and bubbly. This will take about an hour.<br/>
�(I find that under the covers of the waterbed, the<br/>
temperature is absolutely perfect for rising bread<br/>
dough). The batter doesn&#39;t rise dramatically, but it<br/>
does expand somewhat, and the mixture takes on gases<br/>
which are necessary in the cooking process. <br/>
<br/>
Combine the bicarbonate of soda and the extra water,<br/>
and add this mix to the dough. MIX WELL. Then leave<br/>
this mixture to stand, covered, in a warm place for a<br/>
further 15 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
Preheat a heavy based frypan to a low heat. This heat<br/>
is such that oils (I use a spray on oil like &quot;Pure and<br/>
Simple&quot;, but butter or margarine may do) will not<br/>
burn, smoke or misbehave. I use an electric country<br/>
style frypan set on 5. This is almost a non-stick<br/>
surface, and so low cholesterol oils are great. <br/>
<br/>
Spray oils also allow you to coat the crumpet rings as<br/>
you are ready to cook. Place enough mixture into the<br/>
centre of each ring to come almost to the top of the<br/>
ring. (The dough does rise during cooking, and this<br/>
should be allowed for in the filling of the ring. Fill<br/>
the ring enough to get good rise, but not so much that<br/>
the ring overflows badly.) Cook for 4-8 minutes over<br/>
this medium heat, until bubbles appear over the entire<br/>
surface, and the dough appears &#39;dry&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
Remove the ring, turn the crumpet over and cook for a<br/>
further 30 - 60 seconds to brown the top. Remove from<br/>
the pan and cool on a cake rack. <br/>
<br/>
If you find that the bottom is too dark (politely<br/>
referred to as burnt), you are cooking too quickly.<br/>
Slow it down, relax, and try again. The worst thing<br/>
that can happen is that you have to make another<br/>
batch. <br/>
<br/>
Toast the crumpets and serve with lashings of butter. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Meghan :-)<br/>

you, we tried their crumpets and Tamzin was less than<br/>
impressed with them. Her comment, &quot;They don&#39;t taste<br/>
like proper crumpets&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708041921">What is &quot;bread improver&quot;?  How big is the &quot;crumpet<br/>
ring?<br/>
<br/>
This seems similar to an unsweetned donut only not<br/>
deep fried. ????? Maybe what is sometimes called<br/>
&quot;quick bread&quot;?  I have an iron skillet that lives on<br/>
the stove top, and I bake a lot, so have all of the<br/>
ingredients....Will a metal cookie cutter work? or a<br/>
tuna can without the ends?<br/>

&gt; GMO&#39;s in. Yuck.<br/>
&gt; Guess I&#39;ll have to make my own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shyrley&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My sentiments exactly! Here&#39;s a recipe that&#39;s been<br/>
&gt; converted to American measurements (for those of you<br/>
&gt; without scales!).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Crumpets:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What it takes:<br/>
&gt; *	450 grams (3 cups) plain white or untreated flour <br/>
&gt; *	2 teaspoons (10 grams) dry active yeast <br/>
&gt; *	2 3/4 cups of warm water <br/>
&gt; *	Optional (1.5 teasopoons bread improver - if you<br/>
&gt; have it available) <br/>
&gt; *	1.5 teaspoons salt <br/>
&gt; *	1 teaspoon of sugar or honey <br/>
&gt; *	2 tablespoons powdered milk <br/>
&gt; *	1 teaspoons bicarbonate of soda <br/>
&gt; *	2 tablespoons of warm water <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Method:<br/>
&gt; Combine yeast, sugar and one cup of warm water into<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; mixng bowl. The water should be hot enough to take a<br/>
&gt; bath in, but not hot enough to scald. Cover with<br/>
&gt; plastic wrap an stand in a warm place for about ten<br/>
&gt; minutes. During this time the liquid should develop<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; foamy head, showing that the yeast is dissolved and<br/>
&gt; happy.. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sift flour, milk and salt into another bowl, and mix<br/>
&gt; well. (NB. Please resist the temptation to eliminate<br/>
&gt; the salt, as the yeast need a small amount of salt<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; do their job properly.) Make a well in the centre of<br/>
&gt; the flour, add the yeasty water and the rest of the<br/>
&gt; warm water. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Using a wooden spoon, mix to a thick batter. Cover<br/>
&gt; with plastic wrap, and stand in a warm place until<br/>
&gt; well risen and bubbly. This will take about an hour.<br/>
&gt; �(I find that under the covers of the waterbed, the<br/>
&gt; temperature is absolutely perfect for rising bread<br/>
&gt; dough). The batter doesn&#39;t rise dramatically, but it<br/>
&gt; does expand somewhat, and the mixture takes on gases<br/>
&gt; which are necessary in the cooking process. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Combine the bicarbonate of soda and the extra water,<br/>
&gt; and add this mix to the dough. MIX WELL. Then leave<br/>
&gt; this mixture to stand, covered, in a warm place for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; further 15 minutes. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Preheat a heavy based frypan to a low heat. This<br/>
&gt; heat<br/>
&gt; is such that oils (I use a spray on oil like &quot;Pure<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Simple&quot;, but butter or margarine may do) will not<br/>
&gt; burn, smoke or misbehave. I use an electric country<br/>
&gt; style frypan set on 5. This is almost a non-stick<br/>
&gt; surface, and so low cholesterol oils are great. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Spray oils also allow you to coat the crumpet rings<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; you are ready to cook. Place enough mixture into the<br/>
&gt; centre of each ring to come almost to the top of the<br/>
&gt; ring. (The dough does rise during cooking, and this<br/>
&gt; should be allowed for in the filling of the ring.<br/>
&gt; Fill<br/>
&gt; the ring enough to get good rise, but not so much<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; the ring overflows badly.) Cook for 4-8 minutes over<br/>
&gt; this medium heat, until bubbles appear over the<br/>
&gt; entire<br/>
&gt; surface, and the dough appears &#39;dry&#39;. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remove the ring, turn the crumpet over and cook for<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; further 30 - 60 seconds to brown the top. Remove<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; the pan and cool on a cake rack. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you find that the bottom is too dark (politely<br/>
&gt; referred to as burnt), you are cooking too quickly.<br/>
&gt; Slow it down, relax, and try again. The worst thing<br/>
&gt; that can happen is that you have to make another<br/>
&gt; batch. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Toast the crumpets and serve with lashings of<br/>
&gt; butter. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Enjoy everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Meghan :-)<br/>
