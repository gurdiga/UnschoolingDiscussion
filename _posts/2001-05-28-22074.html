<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240153630">I prefer hand quilting.  It has nothing to do with the quality of the<br/>
stitches...it&#39;s because I use a large hoop and by hand quilting I get to<br/>
enjoy the quilt while it is being made!  It&#39;s wonderful to cuddle up under<br/>
the quilt and stitch away.  Very soothing.  Takes forever.<br/>
<br/>
My problem right now is that I&#39;m physically unable to sit at a sewing<br/>
machine long enough to create the quilt top or even cut out the pieces!  I&#39;m<br/>
on the look out for some great pictures in outline or quilting designs I<br/>
like well enough to have BE the quilt design.  Then I&#39;ll just put the top,<br/>
bottom and batting together and enjoy the quilting process (If I don&#39;t<br/>
expect to accomplish it quickly I can do the quilting part).<br/>
<br/>
As to heirlooms...My DS (age 12) has decided he really likes to be wrapped<br/>
up in the first quilt I ever made.  This quilt has a cross stitch top.<br/>
While it was great fun to do (even though it took me five years to finish!),<br/>
cross stitch does not hold up so well to life in a family!  Especially a<br/>
family that moves as much and is as disorganized as we are.  &lt;G&gt;  This quilt<br/>
has frayed edges, is torn, has stitching torn out or missing.  But this is<br/>
his favorite cover!<br/>
<br/>
My theory...a home made quilt is a portable hug.  I think he feels my love<br/>
every time he&#39;s wrapped up in the quilt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169049118">We need to live closer! I prefer piecing the tops!!! Sitting at the sewing machine is tolerable only because I want to get it done--hand quilting would take me forever!!! <br/>
<br/>
5 years for a quilt! I don&#39;t think I could have finished it. I just don&#39;t have the perserverance you do! WOW! <br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s his favorite! And one day, when he&#39;s grown with kids of his own, he&#39;ll understand why....<br/>

<br/>
I have several quilts that my grandmother made 40 and 50 years ago - <br/>
even then she was a small, white-haired little old lady; she&#39;d sit on <br/>
her sofa with her little Chihuahua and work all the stitches by hand <br/>
while watching Roller Derby on TV... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Her quilts are all stored for now, except for one I absolutely love <br/>
and always keep on my bed. It has incredible shades of light and dark <br/>
greens and cream-colors and just enough rose-burgundy to set it off <br/>
nicely. It&#39;s a work of art, and it reminds me of her, and the way she <br/>
always smelled like lilacs and roses...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468591728">Now, Helen, feel free to share those quilting sites with the rest of us....<br/>
<br/>
Started? Nope, not me. That&#39;s Betsy and Johanna. Betsy talking about buying fabric online....it&#39;s their fault, really. I&#39;m an angel! I never start anything and just keep my mouth shut all the time, no opinion or anything.....(yeah, right, you can tell *that* rather quickly can&#39;t you?) <br/>

with each of my children, I start a quilt when I find out I am having them. That way each stitch is put in with thoughts, prayers and dreams of them before they even arrive. All of my children love their quilts to death. My 11 yo sons is in tatters now. He still keeps it in his room.<br/>
