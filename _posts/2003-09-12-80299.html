<div id="ygrps-yiv-2063612349"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I think we&#39;re basically still in a deschooling/de-stressing phase here.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been 18 months since the kids left school but not quite that long since<br/>
I&#39;ve made a conscious effort to quit trying to control every little thing.<br/>
I have a long way to go and I hope the kids don&#39;t get jerked around by me<br/>
too much.  I guess they can&#39;t get jerked if I make the leash long enough can<br/>
they???<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s got to be better for them than school, especially since you&#39;re trying<br/>
so hard to deal with your own issues.<br/>
