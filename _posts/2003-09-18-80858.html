<div id="ygrps-yiv-894534343">**I went to B&N a month ago<br/>
to buy some books for my older kids and saw _The Mouse and<br/>
the Motorcycle_ on one of the kids&#39; tables. I knew immediately<br/>
that would be a book he&#39;d like.**<br/>
<br/>
Ah!  A homeschooling friend of mine was wishing for a book about a boy, <br/>
that deals with sibling rivalry as well as Beverly Cleary&#39;s Beezus and <br/>
Ramona books.  Any suggestions relating?  And any suggestion about <br/>
literary depictions of what it&#39;s like to be the middle child?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Betsy</div>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest son enjoyed Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing by Judy Blume <br/>
as well as the sequels (the ones with &quot;Fudge&quot; in the title).<br/>
They were a little school oriented for my taste (talk about not <br/>
wanting to be seen walking to school with the &quot;kindergarten babies&quot; <br/>
and such) but my boys laughed hysterically and could relate to the <br/>
many exasperating little brother stories as well as to the more <br/>
heartwarming parts where Peter realizes that Fudge isn&#39;t so bad <br/>
after all.<br/>
