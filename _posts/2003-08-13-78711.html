&quot;very bright&quot; daughter who just couldn&#39;t learn to read without great <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dad may very well be dyslexic.  He&#39;s never been &quot;tested&quot; or anything like <br/>
that.  I do not know exactly what his challanges are in reading.  I know that <br/>
he does recognize lots of very familar words, small words, but if he doesnt <br/>
know a word, he will just skip it, not even try to read it.    My sister and my <br/>
middle son have similar difficulties with reading.   Now, my son has been <br/>
&quot;tested&quot;... no dyslexia... more of a processing thing..  And, he can read, it is <br/>
just not easy for him<br/>
