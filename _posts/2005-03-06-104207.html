<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127450373">LAUnschooler, Louise, wanted to say THANKS!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks  for all of the advice in this email, and from the several others  I<br/>
received.  Some things we&#39;ve already done in the past for Derek and  they<br/>
truly have been a benefit.  We give him old appliances and  gadgets all the<br/>
time, and before we throw out any large appliances we let  him explore it for<br/>
awhile.  He has electronic kits and digital books  and experiments daily with<br/>
those.  He frequently is &quot;frankensteining&quot;  bits and pieces he takes from old<br/>
appliances and has made an electronic  fan, an toy airboat, a small plane<br/>
that moves across the floor with LED  lights that flash, and a motorized car.<br/>
ANd he&#39;s always coming to me with  conversations about amp&#39;s and wattage and<br/>
other stuff I have zero knowledge  about.  This past week he has built his<br/>
own workshop in the backyard  and it&#39;s a solid building built with much<br/>
precision, and he next gets to  install electricity in it. To boot, he&#39;s<br/>
already been commissioned to build  a similar workshop for a homeschooling<br/>
family we know and stands to make  some good money from it! (this workshop is<br/>
impressive).  I know he  understands much of the math involved with<br/>
electronics just from seeing the  stuff he builds.  And if he starts making<br/>
money from his endeavors, I  suppose he&#39;ll learn the math that I struggle<br/>
with daily (budgets, finances,  taxes, etc.:-)<br/>
<br/>
For his next stage of electronics that he has eagerly  expressed a wanting to<br/>
learn, we are going to combine a few things from  others advice and our own.<br/>
We&#39;re going to acquire some advanced math books  (thanks for the ones<br/>
suggested!) that explain formula&#39;s and such and have  them available to Derek<br/>
when he&#39;s ready to pour through them.  We&#39;re  also going to purchase Derek a<br/>
more advanced calculator than the basic one  he has.  He uses it frequently,<br/>
so I am pretty sure he&#39;ll appreciate  the more advanced one that works<br/>
formula&#39;s and such.  I&#39;ll also look  for those electronic know-how video&#39;s<br/>
suggested.  In addition, his  father has said he needs about two hours this<br/>
week to spend one-on-one with  Derek to show him the math he&#39;s needing as it<br/>
relates directly to the  electronics he&#39;s wanting to learn about.  After this<br/>
approach we&#39;ll  see if we need to hire a tutor as well, but I&#39;ll start<br/>
looking now so I  have a few resources if the time comes. In the meantime,<br/>
Derek is enjoying  the math computer games, and the cooking he gets to do.<br/>
(we enjoy his  cooking too!).<br/>
This plan brings me a big sigh of relief because we have  never followed a<br/>
curriculum and embrace letting Derek explore his interests  at his own pace.<br/>
I knew I would get some great ideas from the LAUnschooling  group that didn&#39;t<br/>
involve that nasty &quot;C&quot; word. (I was a bit surprised to  get one advice to<br/>
follow a curriculum from a radical unschooler  group).   Anywho, many THANKS<br/>
again for the wonderful  advice.  At least now when our babies get older and<br/>
want to learn this  stuff, I can tell them &quot;Go see Derek!!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Ciao!<br/>
Louise<br/>

Gosh....what horrible advice!  Math doesn&#39;t have to be  taught<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; incrementally, and doesn&#39;t have to be taught with  textbooks.  Blech!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Suggestions:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  1)   Visit a tv repair shop when it isn&#39;t busy and talk to the  guy<br/>
<br/>
