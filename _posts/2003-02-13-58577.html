<div id="ygrps-yiv-249252418">I&#39;m sorry, I deleted posts before I responded to the one asking me for the name of a craft book.<br/>
<br/>
It is called:    <br/>
<br/>
Kids Create! by Laurie Carlson<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
