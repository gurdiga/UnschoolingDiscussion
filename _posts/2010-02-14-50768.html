<div id="ygrps-yiv-502331322">I thought I should share this while it&#39;s happening.  What&#39;s happening  <br/>
at the moment is nothing, and I thought sharing it with people whose  <br/>
kids are still younger could be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Holly didn&#39;t come home last night.  There isn&#39;t an e-mail and there  <br/>
isn&#39;t a tweet.  No text message.   She has one of our cars.  I know  <br/>
where she probably is, at her friend Caiti&#39;s.  And it&#39;s possible that  <br/>
Caiti doesn&#39;t have e-mail.  And it&#39;s possible that her phone is  <br/>
needing a charge.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s smart, she&#39;s 18.  If there was something wrong, we would have  <br/>
heard.  This is a classic &quot;no news is good news&quot; situation.  I had  <br/>
left a sticky note on her closed laptop that says &quot;I love you.  Hope  <br/>
you had fun!&quot;  It&#39;s still there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m worried at an intellectual level, a little.  Not &quot;worried&quot;  <br/>
physically.  Not afraid.  A little apprehensive, but really only a  <br/>
little.  5%.<br/>
<br/>
Before Kirby could drive but he had older friends who did, he would  <br/>
end up being out all night sometimes because he stayed at a gaming  <br/>
party after his ride left, but he would always leave an e-mail for me  <br/>
to find when I woke up, or he would&#39;ve left a message with Marty or  <br/>
Holly.  The first time he wasn&#39;t here and there wasn&#39;t an e-mail  <br/>
either, I think he was fifteen.  It was before he had a phone of his  <br/>
own.  I called the place that would most likely know, my friend Jon&#39;s  <br/>
house, and he was there, and their internet was down.  That&#39;s all I  <br/>
needed to know; he was fine.  My first guess had been right.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s also out, but has been gone since Wednesday morning.  He&#39;s  <br/>
camping in Arizona, and there are many hundreds of people there who  <br/>
know me and Keith and so if Marty was not safe and healthy, we&#39;d know  <br/>
it in no time.<br/>
<br/>
If it turns out later that Holly was not in a good situation, will I  <br/>
feel bad about not having freaked out and started making phone calls  <br/>
and waking people up?  I hope not.  Odds are she&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
When I had been away at college for a semester,  I went to a New  <br/>
Year&#39;s Eve party at the home of a whole family of friends--the  <br/>
parents  and all six kids were there.  Lots of other people I knew,  <br/>
and some other parents I knew, too.  The party went nearly all night.   <br/>
Some of the kids were smoking a little marijuana, but the bulk of the  <br/>
party was alcohol consumption by the adults.  I was driven home  <br/>
(carefully) by one of the moms at about 5:30 in the morning, I think.   <br/>
My dad was awake, and really worried, and so angry with me.<br/>
<br/>
I had NOT expected my dad to be awake.  My dad had never ever once  <br/>
stayed up because I was out.  My mom was the one who did that, if  <br/>
anyone did.  But my mom had left a few months before.<br/>
<br/>
I had been off at college, living in a dorm, staying out whenever I  <br/>
wanted to, going where I wanted to.  I wasn&#39;t a partying kid at all.   <br/>
I went to class. I wasn&#39;t wild.    So I did feel bad for having  <br/>
worried my dad, but it seemed to be unfair that he was angry.  We just  <br/>
hadn&#39;t stated our expectations for the new situation at the house.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that the expectation here that someone should leave a message  <br/>
hasn&#39;t been ignored by Holly, but that she&#39;ll have a good explanation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
(Keith&#39;s still in the back and doesn&#39;t know she&#39;s still out.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
know if he&#39;ll be more worried than I am and want me to call her.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014529564">Holly called on the house phone.  Keith picked it up in the back, and  <br/>
me in the kitchen.  She said she wanted to let us know she was at  <br/>
Sita&#39;s house (the other girl she and Caiti went to the concert  <br/>
with).   She sounded really sleepy.  I asked if she was going to come  <br/>
home or sleep, and she said she wasn&#39;t sure yet.  Do you have the car  <br/>
there?  Yes.   (I thought maybe she was out because she had left the  <br/>
car at Caiti&#39;s and gotten a different ride away from the concert.)<br/>

The first time my older sister stayed out all night (can&#39;t remember how old she was, probably 17), my parents called the cops.  When I started staying out all night I was 19, and I distinctly remember my mother being pissed when I came home the next morning.  In our family there wasn&#39;t much communication, so I never felt the need to call and say I wasn&#39;t coming home (it was usually not planned in advance).  I was also in an angry &quot;I&#39;m an adult now, they can&#39;t tell me what to do anymore&quot; stage as well.  When I came home the next morning my mom never said a word, she would just give me dirty looks and the &quot;cold shoulder&quot; for the rest of the day:(<br/>
<br/>
The relationships between me & my husband and our two sons is different, and will be different.  I&#39;m ensuring that right now while we strive to be the best we can be as a radical unschooling family:)<br/>

<br/>
I guess it&#39;s useful to think about this while our kids are a bit younger so that habits don&#39;t have a chance to set in. <br/>
<br/>
My closest schoolfriend and I both had very protective parents who&#39;d wait up for us, all night if necessary.  We&#39;d go to our respective homes, not to yelling and arguments, but to hurt looks of the &quot;How could you do this to us?&quot; variety.  So we worked out a system.  My mate&#39;s parents trusted me and my parents thought my mate was the most sensible girl on the planet.  So we figured that if I phoned her folks to stay she was staying with me and vice versa, then we could party all night.  It worked consistently, and probably put us in far more dangerous situations because we were already breaking rules, so why not go as far as possible?  So a habit of watchfulness led to a habit of deception.  I hope that as a family our relationship will be trustful enough that schemes like that will be redundant.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This caught  my eye: &quot;all night if necessary.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Worrying, right? That&#39;s a huge burden on a relationship. Even if it&#39;s<br/>
warranted, what does worry usually do? Totally worth thinking about.<br/>
Jude&#39;s explanation of cooking up a plan between friends to phone<br/>
saying that each of them are staying at the other&#39;s house is a real<br/>
life example of what worrying *actually* does. It creates the dynamics<br/>
for parents be uninformed and, as Jude mentioned, for kids (whether<br/>
younger or older) to be in dangerous situations. I have sure been<br/>
there many times. Well past teen years (yes, my parents were that<br/>
protective), my parents continued admonishing for as long as I<br/>
continued informing them of my whereabouts. I finally quit telling<br/>
them anything at all about  my life, including when I was on my last<br/>
dime with no food and in need. I made it through but it was<br/>
unnecessarily hard.<br/>
<br/>
Worrying all night is soooo seldom necessary unless you have that kind<br/>
of relationship, when it&#39;s *always* necessary.<br/>
<br/>
Really, this thing of worrying is something I want to think on more<br/>
deeply on for myself in relation to Karl. I know I could use some<br/>
prevention pointers again even though I&#39;ve heard some pointers. I<br/>
guess I&#39;ll go look see if Sandra or Joyce have &quot;worry&quot; pages on their<br/>
website. I *know* I&#39;m better at dealing with worry than my folks and<br/>
their parents were. For sure!<br/>
<br/>
Any further thoughts? I&#39;m clearest on realizing that it&#39;s closely<br/>
related to basic instinct, feelings which are there naturally for good<br/>
(and bad) reasons, and that the feelings themselves are not the things<br/>
to work on. I also know that I do in fact worry sometimes. And that<br/>
confidence comes partly (or perhaps wholly ) from trust.<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worried. But I tried to hide much of it from the kids - it isn&#39;t their<br/>
burden to bear. I&#39;ve stayed awake, tossing and turning in bed, waiting to<br/>
hear the door open and know they&#39;re safely home. And I&#39;ve asked them to come<br/>
in and give me a little kiss on the cheek and tell me they&#39;re home, because<br/>
I sleep more soundly knowing that. They understand. Whether or not I worried<br/>
depended on ages and who they were going out with - and maybe it is a little<br/>
different with girls than with boys, I&#39;m not sure. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I never had a lack of trust or confidence in my kids, though. It was, for me<br/>
about traffic and drunk drivers (the other guy, not my kids) and the<br/>
potential for car accidents. I&#39;ve been hit by drunk drivers twice and Roya<br/>
was hit once. Maybe that&#39;s more a southern California thing (although Roya<br/>
was hit up in Northern California).  I was always perfectly able to sleep<br/>
soundly if I knew they were somewhere that they were going to stay. It is<br/>
the driving around part that worries me.  Two of my three don&#39;t live here<br/>
(Rox is here most weekends) and if I wake up in the middle of the night, and<br/>
Rosie isn&#39;t home, I text her and just say &quot;hi&quot; and she texts me back and I<br/>
say &quot;good night&quot; and go back to sleep more peacefully.<br/>

-=-Worrying, right? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t seem to me, when my mom stayed up, that she was worrying.  I  <br/>
think she was staying up hoping she would win.  She was betting  <br/>
against me, that I would be late, and then I&#39;d be in trouble, and then  <br/>
she would win.   When I came in on time did I &quot;win&quot;?  Not if staying  <br/>
out would have been more fun.  I came home to avoid punishment.  So  <br/>
when I came home she had won, too.   I stayed out until the last  <br/>
possible moment because being allowed out was a limited (and timed)  <br/>
privilege.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad for anyone whose mom stayed up worried, and *if* my mom was  <br/>
worried, I wish it had looked more like love and less like spiteful  <br/>
resentment.<br/>

<br/>
In my experience it is different with girls.  Even though Holly is  <br/>
strong-willed and quick witted, I still worry about her physical  <br/>
safety more than I do or ever did about Kirby or Marty.<br/>
<br/>
One morning before sunup Holly was still up and went for a walk up the  <br/>
bike trail.  I think she was thirteen or so.  (If anyone remembers,  <br/>
I&#39;d be happy to be corrected or reminded about the age.)   I was upset  <br/>
and asked her to at least take the dog if she ever did that again,  <br/>
which I didn&#39;t think she should ever do again.   She was upset in  <br/>
return and said I wasn&#39;t like that with the boys.  I said she wasn&#39;t a  <br/>
boy.  And she had dropped out of karate too early to defend herself,  <br/>
and I didn&#39;t want to talk about what my fears were.  Rape.  Kidnap.   <br/>
Murder.  The big stuff.<br/>
<br/>
She was offended and felt I was a big sexist poop.  I was shocked that  <br/>
she would be so irresponsible with my baby girl. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I turned the whole deal over to Keith.  He reassured me and  <br/>
persuaded her that it might not be such a great idea, leaving the  <br/>
house in the dark when people didn&#39;t know where she had gone.<br/>
<br/>
She went to a concert of Scarless, her favorite local band, a week and  <br/>
some ago, downtown at The Launchpad.  She had the Ford Taurus.  She  <br/>
parked in one of those ratty little pay-per-space parking lots where  <br/>
you put the money in a numbered slot and then park in that number.   <br/>
Not only not electric, not even mechanical.   When she came out there  <br/>
was a boot on the car.  Not a nice carboot-boot like in England. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
A big old flat anchor on one of the wheels.  For not paying.  There&#39;s  <br/>
no way in the world to prove you paid in one of those places.  They  <br/>
wanted $100 to take it off.  She had to walk a few blocks, she said,  <br/>
to get cash.  She had also had to call Marty to transfer money from  <br/>
her savings to checking.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was frustrated about the unfairness of it.<br/>
My thoughts were about that too, at first, and I offered to go and  <br/>
find the company that did that and tell them off and get some or all  <br/>
of her money back.  They didn&#39;t even give her a receipt, not a card.   <br/>
And the flyer that was on the car when she came out, they took off and  <br/>
kept.   That frustrated me.  But my deep mom thoughts were that the  <br/>
car was her safety,  her tank.  It was the place she could open with  <br/>
that key, and get into, and lock herself up and come home.  She had a  <br/>
car so she did NOT have to walk around downtown Albuquerque late at  <br/>
night.  But that was me, again, with my ugly mom-fears.   For her it  <br/>
was $102 (because it cost her $2 to get the cash out).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-673480088">I grew up with a grandmother who loved me to bits. I was never hit and<br/>
scolded very rarely, and those moments I can still remember. One was when I<br/>
was very young. It was summer holidays, and I went out to play in the<br/>
morning, and went over to my best friend&#39;s house to watch cartoons or<br/>
something because the idea came up. Had lunch there. Around tea time, a<br/>
frantic grandmother arrived there after having searched the entire vicinity<br/>
and asked at the homes of other friends (no phone). She was so relieved when<br/>
she saw me, and was almost in tears. Her &quot;scolding&quot; was &quot;Do NOT go without<br/>
telling where and when you are coming back&quot;. I never had to be told again.<br/>
<br/>
When she became old, and I went to stay with my parents, the habit stuck. My<br/>
dad was verbally abusive, and our relationship was bad, but I still used to<br/>
inform (rather arrogantly at times). I didn&#39;t lie because he was so awful to<br/>
me anyway, what did it matter what he thought of me? So it could be &quot;Going<br/>
out. Back by 2am&quot;. &quot;Where?&quot; - &quot;On the corner, chatting with friends.&quot; &quot;Why<br/>
so late?&quot; - &quot;I like the night. Its less crowded. More space.&quot; However, I was<br/>
always back before the stated time and told him that if I wasn&#39;t back by<br/>
whatever time I said, to go ahead and call the cops. I meant it. I used it<br/>
as a safety measure.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my husband and his brothers are always out of the house<br/>
and never inform, are never back on time. It sometimes seems like they<br/>
return home when all other options are gone. My husband will inform me, but<br/>
will still almost always return after she has gone to sleep. Their mother is<br/>
very controlling, and acts all wronged and tortured when they don&#39;t do what<br/>
she thinks is appropriate. She will never speak with them directly, but talk<br/>
about them to everyone except them. If I am out of town or otherwise out<br/>
overnight, my husband will simply not come home at all without informing.<br/>
His brother often is out all night. My husband and his brother do what they<br/>
want and avoid all conversation around it, including informing. They will be<br/>
home in the evening if she is not at home. They inform me if they will be<br/>
late, but not their own mother. There is no conflict between them, just<br/>
complete avoidance.<br/>
<br/>
So I think that it is also about how easily I can be me (for whatever<br/>
reason) at home. In a way, even by insulting, my father unintentionally<br/>
freed me to be myself by removing the need to lie to be liked. And the<br/>
grandmother liked me no matter what. So I could be me as I was, even if I<br/>
was coming late.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-977433062">Yeh.. I understand this about seeming more interested in winning rather than<br/>
having any worry. I felt much of the time that there was a sizable amount of<br/>
this going on when I was coming up too. On both my parents part. I know they<br/>
genuinely worried as well in with the unexamined and antagonistic maxim of<br/>
always winning.<br/>
<br/>
The largest share of that worry is avoidable through trust, which many<br/>
parents don&#39;t have for their kids. When I was in my late 20s, my dad (saying<br/>
it was a joke) warned me not to share any needles. ??!!  My parents knew me<br/>
so little and had extremely unrealistic ideas about what my life consisted<br/>
of. Good grief. That episode felt to me as though the relationship could<br/>
never be close, mostly because the dynamics were set in place and maintained<br/>
not by the child but by the parents. It&#39;s so unnecessary ... it isn&#39;t even<br/>
based on reality or a fun imagination. It just has things all kind of<br/>
backwards.<br/>

&gt; It didn&#39;t seem to me, when my mom stayed up, that she was worrying.  I<br/>
&gt; think she was staying up hoping she would win.  She was betting<br/>
&gt; against me, that I would be late, and then I&#39;d be in trouble, and then<br/>
&gt; she would win.   When I came in on time did I &quot;win&quot;?  Not if staying<br/>
&gt; out would have been more fun.  I came home to avoid punishment.  So<br/>
&gt; when I came home she had won, too.   I stayed out until the last<br/>
&gt; possible moment because being allowed out was a limited (and timed)<br/>
&gt; privilege.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m glad for anyone whose mom stayed up worried, and *if* my mom was<br/>
&gt; worried, I wish it had looked more like love and less like spiteful<br/>
&gt; resentment.<br/>
