<div id="ygrps-yiv-972500009">Members of the Canadian Homeschooling list were discussing ways of helping <br/>
Afghani women and children last fall and decided to make a quilt to <br/>
raffle.  A number of our members made squares (including moi) and last <br/>
weekend a bunch of us got together and quilted it.  Along the way, we&#39;ve <br/>
picked up several more prizes (with more possible).  We now have a <br/>
beautiful pieced, embroidered wall-hanging, a pillow (made from a square <br/>
that didn&#39;t arrive in time), and a necklace, along with the quilt.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in this project, go to <br/>

You can see a picture of the whole quilt as well as the individual squares, <br/>
the wall-hanging, the pillow, and the necklace.  If you want to buy a <br/>
ticket, you can print them out from the web page.  The address to send <br/>
money to is also there.  Be aware that we&#39;ve changed the draw date to <br/>
February 28.  If you have more questions, write me privately as I&#39;m having <br/>
trouble keeping up with my lists lately.<br/>
