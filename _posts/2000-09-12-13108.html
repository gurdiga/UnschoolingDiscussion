<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721765703">Here in Richmond, VA we have LOTS of hsing co-ops. We have the ones where parents<br/>
trade teaching classes to each other&#39;s children and the ones where you go to a<br/>
place (usually church classrooms that have been rented) where you pay for your<br/>
kids to take classes. Most teachers are hsing parents or people in the community<br/>
who have volunteered or who have been hired to teach.  It&#39;s mostly for academic,<br/>
middle school and high school classes.<br/>

It was my understanding that you could only teach your own children, and that teaching other children made what you were doing private school, and no longer homeschooling, required certification and other legal issues to be addressed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Who would know? I&#39;m totally confused on this *legal* thing.  :)  If I invite<br/>
4 of my friends over and we all learn something together, who needs some<br/>
sort of legal sanction?  If I invite 4 -5 if my kids friends over and we do<br/>
science experiments together, so what?    At different times I&#39;ve traded off<br/>
with one, to and four families.  We&#39;ve done all kinds of things together,<br/>
even producing one play.<br/>
<br/>
Our current happening is my good friend is painting a mural on my livingroom<br/>
wall as a birthday present and my teenager is going to come over and pick<br/>
her brain about math/algebra. I&#39;ll keep her two children busy while she<br/>
works. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the children are coming to your home every day of the week and you<br/>
act as teacher, then you are running a private school, but what we do,<br/>
trading skills and time, isn&#39;t the same thing.<br/>

I think if homeschoolers never reached out to the community and asked for<br/>
help teacher their child certain things, they&#39;d all go insane. My kids are<br/>
still very young, but I like to know that when they want to learn say,<br/>
algebra, there are people out there that can do it for me. There may also be<br/>
someone in my hsing group who is interested in say, pharmacology (my line of<br/>
work) and I might be able to teach them something. I could not teach my kid<br/>
everything through high school all alone. I just don&#39;t know all of that<br/>
stuff. I&#39;m not sure what the legalities are, but I&#39;m pretty sure someone<br/>
teaching my kid to knit does not make them a private school. You might want<br/>
to read books like David Alberts on community based learning. There are so<br/>
many  resources out there, we have to tap into them (at least IMHO)<br/>
