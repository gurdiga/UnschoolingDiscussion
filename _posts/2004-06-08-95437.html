<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053460869">&quot; We&#39;re<br/>
getting ready to take a two-week trek to see family in Austin TX...<br/>
taking a southern route from Maryland through Virginia, Tennesee,<br/>
Arkansas... then to Austin... &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well heck, if you just slipped a little further south as you wend towards TX, you could stop and say hi to us Pensacolians!:)<br/>
If you travel down through TN, then move towards the gulf, that&#39;ll put you right in line with Houston, an easy drive from here.<br/>
