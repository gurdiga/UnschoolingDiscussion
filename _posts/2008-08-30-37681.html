<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281889368">In the interest of accuracy, I have updated the Description of<br/>
UnschoolersOKWithLabels since my last post.  It now reads:<br/>
<br/>
---------------<br/>
This group is intended to give unschooling families a place where they may<br/>
(1) use labels more freely when they feel that such use is valuable; (2)<br/>
speak more freely about resources beyond &quot;unschooling only&quot; to help children<br/>
with special needs, learning &quot;differences&quot;, or behavioral issues; and (3)<br/>
speak more freely about whether, in some cases, &quot;personality differences&quot;<br/>
and &quot;learning differences&quot; relate to a diagnosis or biochemical condition.<br/>
<br/>
This group is intended to be less reactionary when labels are used. This may<br/>
assist those who want to spend more discussion time (which may include<br/>
labels) to help their families and less time fielding posts which may feel<br/>
like second-guesses as to whether their use of labels in their own unique<br/>
situations is appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Posts challenging the use of labels can be and often are extremely useful in<br/>
helping parents to be more conscious of the impact of their use. As such<br/>
posts are well represented on other unschooling groups, this group is<br/>
intended to be a place with a little less &quot;noise&quot; on this issue, so that the<br/>
list may be used more efficiently by those who &quot;get it&quot; about labels and<br/>
want to receive the benefit of the doubt about their particular use of<br/>
labels. This way, they may find it easier to move on to what they really<br/>
wanted to discuss.<br/>
<br/>
While this list is also intended to be more inclusive with regard to<br/>
parenting styles, challenges to parenting styles are permitted.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Noise&quot; is quoted and &quot;get it&quot; is quoted, but I don&#39;t think the  <br/>
discussions about labels are  noise, and I don&#39;t think the composer  <br/>
of that list description &quot;gets it&quot; about labels.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll end up cleaning up after you when people go there and get  <br/>
advice that hinders their unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since you&#39;re not planning to participate in or moderate the list, why  <br/>
not just delete it before it does any damage?<br/>

The problem is that your new list and my made up lists are not going<br/>
to help anyone move closer to a more peaceful and gentle life.  I see<br/>
unschooling as a lifelong journey.  Most of us are going to keep<br/>
walking forward, but you are going to hang right where you are. <br/>
That&#39;s all your new list is going to help you do.</div>

Unfortunately it might hang some others up, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping it will just be deleted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919439172">&quot;more freely&quot;<br/>
&quot;less reactionary&quot;<br/>
&quot;little less&quot;<br/>
&quot;more inclusive&quot;<br/>
These are all comparative terms... which causes me to think there must be an<br/>
ongoing discussion of the lists that are &quot;not&quot; what your list &quot;is.&quot;  And if<br/>
that discussion is not planned, the terms should be adjusted to reflect what<br/>
this particular list *IS* without comparison to what it is not.<br/>
<br/>
While some folks find their life&#39;s passion in rallying against Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>
lists for some imagined slight, it&#39;s the children I think about. The<br/>
children who are growing older and farther away from the very parent who was<br/>
once committed to finding peaceful ways to approach unschooling principles.<br/>
Your kids are more important than any list. Your kids are more important<br/>
than any label. Your kids are even more important than any hurt feelings you<br/>
may have from reading advice too close to the truth.<br/>
I&#39;d drop the list, focus on your kids and in the quiet moments you can<br/>
consider if labels are *really* that important to you...<br/>
I sure hope they&#39;re not.<br/>
