<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005947200">Hi All: especially Valerie and Carollyn:<br/>
<br/>
Having just read Melissa&#39;s e-mail jarred something inside of me... I need to <br/>
apologize to all for my hick comments... It was uncalled for and <br/>
unnecessary.. If I can&#39;t get my point across without resorting to insulting <br/>
people, then I ought to think again about how to reinforce my argument.  My <br/>
behavior was inappropriate and child like (well that&#39;s PS child like)...<br/>
<br/>
I do hope you all accept my apologies... I will continue to disagree on <br/>
subject such as spanking, but not to resort to namecalling.  <br/>
<br/>
Dawn F</div>
