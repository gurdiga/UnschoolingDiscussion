<div id="ygrps-yiv-73550433">Thank you for your reply.  You pointed out alot for me to consider.  As for<br/>
the email address, when I set it up four years ago, I wanted something that<br/>
reflected how I wanted to homeschool.  I wanted to follow my daughter&#39;s lead<br/>
  I wasn&#39;t really thinking about educating as school-at-home.  But I can see<br/>
how it looks that way.  Thank you for reminding me that there is no high<br/>
school in unschooling.  As I stated, I still have moments of panic!   I am<br/>
amazed at what my girls are learning without me leaning over them,<br/>
prescribing every thought.  They are getting more comfortable with it as I<br/>
grow more comfortable.  Again, I thank you.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
