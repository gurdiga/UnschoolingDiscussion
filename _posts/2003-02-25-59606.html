&lt;&lt;  The first two are sixteen and are very different <br/>
learners.  They started reading quite naturally.   &gt;&gt;<br/>

Very cool story, Lucie.  Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if your twins taught each other to read, in a way, by doing it <br/>
together?<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had some perfectionism going on as a kid and if he couldn&#39;t read (each <br/>
time he tried) he just QUIT.  But gradually things started looking like <br/>
language to him.  He read from  using a Nintendo players guide when he had <br/>
his very first NES.  And he subscribed to Nintendo Power before he could <br/>
read, kept them in order in magazine boxes and even paid for an index with <br/>
his own money, and that helped him read too.<br/>
