<br/>
Ok, I Googled it and found it what it real stands for (Bob Jones<br/>
University).<br/>
<br/>
But when I first saw it written with the other Christian curriculums,<br/>
the first thing that came to my head was &quot;Big Jesus Unversity.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Laughing is a great way to start the day, thanks<br/>
