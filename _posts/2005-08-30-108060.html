<div id="ygrps-yiv-553911093">I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s okay to post this notice here, but I&#39;m<br/>
enthusastic about this new magazine (I would be - I&#39;m a regular<br/>
contributor, plus getting a commercially available magazine about home<br/>
education into the newsagents in Australia has been a goal of mine for<br/>
over a decade). <br/>
<br/>
This magazine celebrates learning at home and in the community. The<br/>
contributors generally lean towards unschooling or are unschoolers. It<br/>
doesn&#39;t have a narrow focus as to be commercially viable it needs to<br/>
cover all home educating bases...<br/>
<br/>
Education Choices, Australia&#39;s first commercially available home<br/>
education magazine, is now on sale for AUS$8. Ask for it at your local<br/>
newsagent or purchase from Always Learning Books -<br/>
www.alwayslearningbooks.com.au [see Magazines]<br/>
