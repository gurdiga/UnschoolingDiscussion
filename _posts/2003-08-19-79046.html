<div id="ygrps-yiv-1954127027">I need some input here!<br/>
My 8yo son has a newly found love for soccer.  He attended a week of <br/>
soccer camp over the summer, and is now starting practices for a <br/>
travelling soccer team that he&#39;ll be playing with this fall.<br/>
This is all his choice, and he&#39;s learning a lot about the game and <br/>
having a great time, but he needs some help dealing with name <br/>
calling and other things which he&#39;s not all that accustomed to.<br/>
At the first practice there was one boy in particular who would <br/>
shout things at my son like &quot;PASS THE BALL YOU IDIOT!!&quot;  <br/>
Tonight at practice I hung out for a little while, and when the <br/>
coach asked me how my son was doing I said he was doing great except <br/>
for being a little upset at being called an idiot by this other <br/>
boy.  What I was hoping for (and half-expecting since I&#39;m usually <br/>
not around people who think name calling is okay) is that the coach <br/>
would be duly concerned and mabye even have a pep talk for the boys <br/>
about being a team/no name calling/all for one and one for all- that <br/>
sort of thing.  Instead he gave me a knowing smile and said, almost <br/>
affectionately &quot;I think I know the boy you&#39;re talking about.  He <br/>
rode my son for a while last year and it toughened him up and made <br/>
him a better player.&quot;  Said with a big smile, like this name calling <br/>
kid was an excellent mini-coach or something.<br/>
Then he said to me &quot;your son&#39;s homeschooled, right?  He&#39;ll get used <br/>
to it.  This will be excellent socialization for him.&quot;<br/>
Which made me angry I even brought it up to him because now I feel <br/>
like my son is perceived as an oversheltered, oversensitive kid who <br/>
needs to be &quot;toughened up,&quot;  and I&#39;m perceived as an oversheltering, <br/>
oversensitive mother.  I wish I just handled it with my son and <br/>
never even brought it up to the coach.  <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m wondering is, what advice would you all give your child in <br/>
a similar situation?  My son specifically wants to know what he <br/>
should say or do when this happens again.  Ignore it?  Say something <br/>
back in defense of himself?  What could he say back that would <br/>
deflect verbal abuse but wouldn&#39;t be stooping to the same level?<br/>
<br/>
Also, what would you have said to the coach in response to <br/>
the &quot;he&#39;ll get used to it- this will be great socialization&quot; <br/>
comment?  I was speechless at the time but all the way home in the <br/>
car racked my brain for the perfect response.<br/>
I have to be careful because my son wants to play on this team- he <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to throw in the towel because of this one kid.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading.<br/>

<br/>
Tell him some kids&#39; spirits are crushed by that kind of &quot;socialization&quot; in <br/>
school, and if you had wanted him &quot;socialized&quot; by abusive jerks, public school <br/>
is free and within walking distance.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My son specifically wants to know what he <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Okay mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if the kid says &quot;Pass the ball, idiot,&quot; he could say &quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br/>
It would confuse the kid and while he&#39;s stunned he might think.  It&#39;s a vague <br/>
insult, without BEING an insult.  It&#39;s a reminder that it&#39;s not that kid&#39;s <br/>
job to coach him, that it&#39;s not that kid&#39;s role to &quot;be the boss of him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or he could just stand and say &quot;SAY PLEASE&quot; if it&#39;s a practice and not a game.<br/>
<br/>
I have a standing fantasy of getting out of my car and walking back to the <br/>
car behind me and say &quot;What?&quot; when someone beeps in the first 1/10 of a second <br/>
the light turns green.   Yeah, if I&#39;ve been there a whole second, beep me.  If <br/>
the green didn&#39;t even warm UP yet, SHUSH UP!    My fantasy needs the other <br/>
lanes to be full and for me to walk slowly enough that the light turns red again. <br/>
 The other driver would say whatever, and I would say &quot;If you didn&#39;t want me, <br/>
you shouldn&#39;t have honked.  I thought you needed something.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I like this. When someone honks needlessly at me like that, I spend<br/>
several seconds exaggeratedly looking around for the danger they&#39;re warning<br/>
me about. Too scared to get out and ask, but I&#39;m happy to<br/>
crane around while they steam.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah the thought of getting out and asking what&#39;s up is pretty funny to me<br/>
too. Unfortunately for me, the first thing I think of is someone getting<br/>
blown away by a crazy road raged lunatic. Safer to stay inside the car. I<br/>
usually just sit there if they piss me off by being in such a hurry. Once I<br/>
even stayed there long enough for the light to turn again. There was silence<br/>
from that car that&#39;s for sure.<br/>

Not to be morbid but to remind everyone of the dangers of confrontation with other drivers.  Some people are just nuts.  <br/>

Oh sheesh!!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to have told a story too much like an ugly truth.<br/>
<br/>
Very sorry about your brother.<br/>
<br/>
I had thoughts of potential death when I confronted my behind-me neighbor <br/>
about being mean to his kids but at that moment it was worth the risk.<br/>

I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your brother, Kimberly!  When Sandra posted<br/>
that fantasy I actually thought the same thing because people have<br/>
been shot around here for doing that sort of thing.  There are too<br/>
many crazies out there that think nothing of taking a life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just joined the group.  I don&#39;t have much experience with <br/>
unschooling as my kids are 2 years and 6 weeks old, respectively, but <br/>
I&#39;ve played soccer all my life :).  <br/>
<br/>
IMO the important thing to consider is how your child reacts to the <br/>
situation.  If he&#39;s upset and doesn&#39;t want to play because of this <br/>
kid&#39;s harrassment, then you need approach the coach.  Where I grew <br/>
up, there were lots of different opportunities for playing soccer, so <br/>
I could switch teams if I wanted.  I did switch drop down to a lower <br/>
skilled team one year due to not getting along with the coach.  I was <br/>
happier, which is what&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is the type to blow off the other kid&#39;s comments or to <br/>
stand up and tell him off, then no worries.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also, what would you have said to the coach in response to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would ignore it.  Do you want to spend the time educating this <br/>
person on your educational philosophy?  You could have said, &quot;my idea <br/>
of positive socialization is not being bullied.&quot;  etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have to be careful because my son wants to play on this team- he <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have your answer then.  I would talk with your son about what he <br/>
wants you to do, if anything.  He will encounter bullies throughout <br/>
life.  My typical reaction to someone who is screaming for the ball <br/>
is to ignore them and find someone else for a pass :).  He could <br/>
always tell the kid he won&#39;t pass to him until he is nicer.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.</div>
