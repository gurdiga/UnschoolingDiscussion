<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051164121">&quot;Products.  Too many people think of themselves and<br/>
the things around them as products to be bought, sold,<br/>
returned for a refund, gone to small-claims court<br/>
about, rejected, replaced with newer/better  <br/>
products.  YUCK!  Fast-track to an empty life.<br/>
