<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465711128">Hi all.. I&#39;ve been a part of this list and the Unschooler one for several<br/>
months and I feel like I know many of you personally..I&#39;m a lurker.. but a<br/>
poster-wanna-be! Maybe I&#39;ll have a chance of keeping up with this list..the<br/>
unschooling one moves too fast! I can&#39;t seem to stay on top of it all..by<br/>
the time I am ready to post, it&#39;s already been said and so much better! But<br/>
my family and hubby, hear your names so often..things will come up in<br/>
conversation at times and it will be something that has just been discussed<br/>
on this list too.<br/>
I have 3 girls.. Emily is 18 and mostly lives away from home now, Sarah 13<br/>
and Laura will be 8 next month. My hubby Russ and I have been married for 22<br/>
years..I have the coolest kids and hubby in the world! We live in the<br/>
country in SE Missouri, I raise Nubian milk goats, (I&#39;m big into cheese<br/>
making) also Appaloosa horses, also raise chickens, ducks, and we have 4<br/>
dogs and 3 cats. I love to garden..veggies, herbs and lots of flowers<br/>
too..and the girls and I go on trail rides every weekend.. We started out as<br/>
school-at-home..but have been total unschoolers for at least the past 5<br/>
years. (Sandra.. you have been such a help and a great influence.. just want<br/>
to say &#39;thank ya&#39;..)<br/>
I wish I could have you all over for an afternoon!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137355498">Oooo cheese making. how cool I would like to learn to<br/>
make cheese so that me and my son Levi, who is 13<br/>
could do that together. I&#39;ve just started the<br/>
unschooling for Levi,but I love it! I used to just<br/>
duplicate school in my home ( I thought that was what<br/>
homeschooling was) But now we play Yahtzee and make<br/>
alot of trips to the creek to play and explore<br/>
things.I&#39;m a single mom. My other two childern are<br/>
grown and I&#39;m already a grandma. I love it though. My<br/>
grand kids are 2 & 3 I&#39;ll be homeschooling them also .<br/>
My daughter and I never want them to have to go to<br/>
public school. So nice to hear from you, Julie I hope<br/>
we can share Ideas with both of us having 13 yr.<br/>
olds;) Laurie<br/>

those boards)  Dagny has had some problems recently with a couple girls who<br/>
