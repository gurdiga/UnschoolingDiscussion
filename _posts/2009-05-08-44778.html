<div id="ygrps-yiv-649363857">Letting go of ways of living that are <br/>
not as peaceful and joyful as I would<br/>
like our lives to be, wading into unschooling,<br/>
I am hitting a stumbling block in re:  chores.<br/>
(From what I read, I am not the first!)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a lot of chores to<br/>
begin with, but we have been living<br/>
with the idea:  if you took it out,<br/>
put it back when you are done.<br/>
<br/>
I love everything I read about doing<br/>
work for others from a place of love<br/>
rather than obligation, and I love<br/>
the idea of using work as a meditative<br/>
practice.  I am glad that I have been<br/>
cleaning up, all along, after art projects<br/>
and cooking and science experiments.<br/>
<br/>
I am rethinking the &quot;if you took it out...&quot;<br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
My personal mental stumbling block:<br/>
litter.  I have a kid who throws<br/>
garbage on the ground, at home and<br/>
out and about.  When we are out, I say <br/>
something like, &quot;Other people don&#39;t want<br/>
to look at our garbage; look, there&#39;s a garbage<br/>
can.  Let&#39;s go put this (candy wrapper, used<br/>
napkin, whatever) in there.<br/>
<br/>
But then at home, would it be just the same?<br/>
&quot;Oh, please don&#39;t spit your gum onto the floor;<br/>
the rest of us don&#39;t want to step on it.  It makes <br/>
our shoes sticky.  Look, here&#39;s the garbage can; <br/>
this is a good place to spit the gum out... or throw <br/>
the candy wrapper, or the used napkin.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
A common room in a home (living room, kitchen,<br/>
other shared space) is not a public place, and certainly<br/>
there aren&#39;t any fines for &quot;littering&quot; in the home, but<br/>
I am having a hard time getting past the idea that there<br/>
is a basic level of orderliness that everybody who shares<br/>
a common living space should help to maintain.<br/>
<br/>
I know, I should be careful with &quot;should.&quot;<br/>
And:  Who says what that &quot;basic level of orderliness&quot;<br/>
is?  In my mind, it would be the same as at the park<br/>
or at the playground:  don&#39;t throw trash on the ground.<br/>
<br/>
At home, if ask DS to pick up the gum he has spit on the<br/>
floor, and he says, &quot;You do it...&quot; do I simply adjust my<br/>
attitude (let go of feelings of being disrespected) and do it?<br/>
Six people out of seven think this is gross; does this mean<br/>
one of the six who thinks it&#39;s yucky should scrape the gum<br/>
off the floor?<br/>
<br/>
And in public, the same, trusting in time that he will learn<br/>
not to litter in public places?  And do I tell him that what<br/>
he is doing is against the law?  I feel like that is important<br/>
information for him to have.<br/>
<br/>
I realize this reads like I haven&#39;t read all the pages and links<br/>
on chores and gratitude and have tos, but I have, over and<br/>
over again.  And I&#39;ve been thinking about it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
But I still feel stuck.<br/>

<br/>
Kelly, I do pick up the gum.  If necessary I scrape it.  What if a <br/>
child were to accidentally (not realizing) put the gum on the edge of a <br/>
plate and it rolls off but no one sees it happening.  Then someone <br/>
comes along and picks up, most likely the parent.  When an accident <br/>
happens, there&#39;s nothing to model or teach (which is in effect what <br/>
you&#39;re talking about with all the verbal instruction about where <br/>
garbage goes), is there?  Accidents happen.  Often I&#39;ve spoken to Karl <br/>
and wondered if it had been an accident.  Then all I&#39;ve done is model <br/>
how to be irritated at messes (if the &quot;lesson&quot; takes).  Other than <br/>
that, I&#39;ve made Karl a little more nervous about accidents.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent (6 out of 7, really?) thinks putting gum in one&#39;s hand is <br/>
gross, what makes a parent think that a child won&#39;t feel it&#39;s gross <br/>
too.  No wonder such a child is loathe to throw garbage away.<br/>
<br/>
Karl used to throw trash on the floor a lot.  He didn&#39;t see a mess like <br/>
I did.  He wasn&#39;t very aware of the fact that others consider garbage <br/>
on the floor to be a bad thing (littering!).  When a parent <br/>
consistently picks up garbage because it&#39;s important to the parent and <br/>
.. this is important .. not saying anything about it  ---just doing it <br/>
matter of factly-- then the child eventually gets the idea that garbage <br/>
goes in the trash and that child is matter of fact about doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Karl has begun to be pretty good about it most of the time.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
always want to do it and will ask me to, and ... just like I might ask <br/>
Karl to do something for me, I think it&#39;s fine if sometimes he&#39;d rather <br/>
I did it.  No problem.  That&#39;s building trust in the relationship <br/>
rather than focusing on the relative importance of stuff.<br/>

<br/>
When Jayn has trouble with trash, and she is also now a gum chewer, I told <br/>
her that I didn&#39;t like to bend to pick stuff up so could she hand it to me. <br/>
For a long time she handed me stuff. She now hands me her gum. I keep bins <br/>
or bags all over the house. Sometimes she puts her own trash in one of these <br/>
many receptacles.<br/>
<br/>
She hands me her trash at the park.<br/>
<br/>
When we go for walks we take a big bag with us and pick up other people&#39;s <br/>
litter. A walk is no fun unless we are picking up litter.<br/>

I didn&#39;t meaning that scraping up the gum is gross;<br/>
I meant that spitting gum on the floor is gross.<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean gross as in disgusting; I meant<br/>
gross as in crude behavior.  I don&#39;t mind holding<br/>
my kids&#39; ABC gum.  I&#39;m a mom; I&#39;ve been peed on<br/>
pooped on, puked on, bled on... Chewed up gum<br/>
is nothing.  I physically don&#39;t mind picking it up.  <br/>
This is more an attitude shift that I need to make.<br/>
<br/>
So, let go of judging the behavior--no more thinking,<br/>
&quot;Oh, that&#39;s crude!&quot;--and just pick up the mess.<br/>
Focus on the relationship.  In public or at home.<br/>
Less talk, more take care of the child, and the <br/>
child&#39;s mess.  Don&#39;t worry about public spaces/<br/>
private spaces.<br/>
<br/>
I think I am getting it.  <br/>

<br/>
Keith and I have always picked up trash, pulled stickers from  <br/>
roadsides and public parks and carried them to a trash can.  We pick  <br/>
up aluminum cans when we&#39;re out walking, and wood we could throw in  <br/>
fires.  It&#39;s just a casual thing, not a hunt.   We&#39;re not cleaning up  <br/>
the road, but if there&#39;s something obvious and easy to get, we just  <br/>
always did get it.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; the kids to do that, but they saw us and wanted to  <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
One time Kirby asked if we were getting paid to do that and I said no,  <br/>
we were just doing it to be nice.   He really liked that and always  <br/>
helped much more quickly after that, and smiled about it!<br/>

I don&#39;t know what this means.  Helping a child know what&#39;s expected is  <br/>
good.  It doesn&#39;t have to involve rules and punishments and  <br/>
arguments.  When they get old enough to understand, information is  <br/>
useful!  Until then, modelling is useful.   If one of my kids gets up  <br/>
to leave the table or to leave a room, they&#39;re likely to pick up any  <br/>
dirty dishes or trash that&#39;s between them and the door, especially if  <br/>
they&#39;re headed to the kitchen.   They do it because other people have  <br/>
done it for them.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, yes, yes, and yes.  That is why I am asking the questions;<br/>
also, in light of the recent discussion about how to use<br/>
public playgrounds in a way that allows us to respect our<br/>
children while also respecting that other people have different<br/>
ideas about how to use the equipment... <br/>
<br/>
...my mind made a connection between that conversation<br/>
and littering, and how a conventional parent handles<br/>
a child thoughtlessly dropping unwanted junk on the<br/>
ground, and how would it look different if a parent is<br/>
trying to parent more mindfully.<br/>
<br/>
(When I say &quot;thoughtlessly,&quot; I don&#39;t mean to convey<br/>
negative emotion.  I simply mean he doesn&#39;t give<br/>
it any thought.  He&#39;s done with the ice cream sandwich,<br/>
doesn&#39;t need the wrapper, so drops it.)<br/>
<br/>
And then my mind went from littering (in parks,<br/>
at playgrounds, walking around town) to the<br/>
same actions, but occurring in shared living<br/>
space in the home.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does he litter?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  He drops candy wrappers/other food wrappers/used napkins.<br/>
<br/>
He is adjusting to our family and this culture.  He hasn&#39;t<br/>
been here long.  The relationship is most important.  That<br/>
much I know.  <br/>
<br/>
But in general, I think, as I am deschooling myself, I am leaning<br/>
a bit too far in the direction of unparenting.  I am struggling<br/>
to find my balance.  It&#39;s harder with my adoptive kids, easier<br/>
with my bio kids.  With my bio kids, we are deschooling.<br/>
With the adoptive kids, we are bonding/attaching, dealing with<br/>
language barriers and different cultural assumptions,<br/>
AND deschooling.  And the adoptive kids are coming<br/>
from a culture where every aspect of every day of their<br/>
lives was structured.  So, I (personally) am on a steep<br/>
learning curve, and feel like, &quot;I&#39;d better get this right,<br/>
in a hurry...&quot; because they&#39;re in middle childhood already,<br/>
so time is short.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter has never been one to litter in public, but my<br/>
younger daughter has and both of them have done the garbage all over the<br/>
floor.<br/>
<br/>
As to the garbage in the house, I got paper sacks and folded over the<br/>
tops and put them ALL over the house, some rooms had a couple, like the<br/>
living room where individual people hung out in individual spaces within<br/>
the living room.  I announced that there were garbage cans all over and<br/>
showed them both where they all were.  I didn&#39;t have a problem with that<br/>
much after that.  On occasion someone would eat a bunch of little<br/>
candies that were individually wrapped while sitting on the couch and<br/>
I&#39;d just come in and pick them all up and put them into the nearest<br/>
sack.  That was maybe 4 yrs ago, and now I only have a few sacks out and<br/>
about and everyone uses them instead of the floor or coffee table.<br/>
<br/>
If we are out and about in public spaces, and one of my kids left<br/>
garbage, I&#39;d clean it up.  My youngest almost always cleans up these<br/>
days, but she didn&#39;t used to at all.  I&#39;ve made a habit of always<br/>
picking up garbage in public spaces, even if the garbage wasn&#39;t any of<br/>
ours.  I just do it if I see it and there is a can nearby.  I&#39;ve even<br/>
been known to tell a stranger that they accidentally dropped some<br/>
garbage, or even say, &quot;here, let me get that garbage that you&#39;ve<br/>
accidentally dropped.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965018361">i recently received a chart from my parenting class that i&#39;m taking (which i take most w/ a grain of salt...but thankfully most of it is geared to parents taking care of themselves and loving themselves in order to love and truly BE there for their children...)& the chart details kids and their abilities in re. to taking on responsibilities/household &#39;chores&#39;...it basically says that children before about 10ish need assistance...they need help...things such as...doing laundry...dishes...etc. and i have found this is so true. <br/>
<br/>
i have often expected my megh could do things all by herself and remember the whole process... i have had a real awakening by all this and realized i need to help her w/ stuff...stand back and then help out when need be...i have expected too much of her. especially things like doing laundry... like... today.<br/>
<br/>
my daughter and her friend are 6.5yo. her friend is spending the night. i&#39;m a single mom and have a little guy 17 mos. to look after...we don&#39;t have a washer and dryer in our condo so we have to take it to a laundry room the next building down. so i asked my daughter and her friend to take the laundry down in the basket and gave them quarters and poured the soap in the clothes. megh has put laundry in washing machines before...so i figured ok, she knows what to do. she knows to put the coins in and push that thing in to start the machine...  ok. good enough, right...wrong! my neighbor in the condo downstairs just knocked on the door to ask me if i was doing laundry...i said yes...she looked frazzled but was being polite of course... :O)  so to make a long story short, it seems like the girls took the neighbors clothes out of the washer soaking wet...then put most of it in the dryer. didn&#39;t start the dryer, of course. then they started the washer i suppose w/ our clothes and some of the neighbors mixed in...oh boy. well i&#39;m sure they learned from it but next time i&#39;ll go along w/ them i think... isn&#39;t that funny! we learn the hard way most of the time, don&#39;t we... hee! <br/>
<br/>
i just had to share this as i think most of us could stand to be reminded of this in regards to the littler ones in our houses... ;o)<br/>

conclusions, or ask us if we let them eat M&Ms, what will we do when  <br/>
they&#39;re shooting heroin.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would not give gum to a child who had spit it out  <br/>
that way.   If they wanted gum, I would say &quot;I&#39;m afraid if I give this  <br/>
to you I&#39;ll end up having to pick it up, and that&#39;s yucky.&quot; (or the  <br/>
equivalent in your own common phrasing--not that very phrase, but  <br/>
I&#39;d&#39;ve said that, or &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you chew the gum and I have  <br/>
to pick it up.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Then either they could pretend not to want the gum anymore, which is  <br/>
fine, or they could say please, or I&#39;ll pick it up, or whatever.  Then  <br/>
I would (and I have, often) give them a kleenex or paper napkin, too,  <br/>
and say &quot;keep this to put the gum in when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Very occasionally one of my kids would drop trash, or set it down and  <br/>
it would blow away.  I&#39;d say &quot;Hey, look,&quot; or &quot;Could you get that,  <br/>
please?&quot; and they would.   It doesn&#39;t need to be a lecture about  <br/>
littering, but they did know that there were fines for littering. I&#39;d  <br/>
read signs to them as a matter of course, about the rules of parks or  <br/>
whatever.  Not every time, just if it was interesting or we were new  <br/>
to a particular park or town or situation.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it were me, I would not give gum to a child who had spit it out  <br/>
&gt; that way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be my usual response to.  But each child is different.<br/>
This child steals from the other kids&#39; rooms.  This is very<br/>
understandable.  Nine months ago, he didn&#39;t have a thing to call <br/>
his own.  He is learning so much about ownership and boundaries <br/>
and abundance.  He is still living with fear that all this new wonderful <br/>
stuff:  the toys, the food, the screens, the freedoms, the hugging<br/>
arms, will go away.  He will let go of those fears when he is ready.<br/>
Meanwhile, he may hoard things, he may steal things, he may<br/>
express general distrust in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, last time he stole gum from a brother&#39;s room,<br/>
his brother asked him to use some of his allowance to pay him<br/>
back for the gum, and DS did that.  We reiterated that we don&#39;t go<br/>
into other people&#39;s rooms or take other people&#39;s things without asking,<br/>
and then I mentioned that if he wants gum, it is nicer to buy<br/>
his own than to take it from his brother&#39;s desk drawer.  I offered<br/>
to bring him to the store to buy his own gum when he wants gum.<br/>
<br/>
So, usually, I would agree with this approach:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they wanted gum, I would say &quot;I&#39;m afraid if I give this  <br/>
&gt; to you I&#39;ll end up having to pick it up, and that&#39;s yucky.&quot; (or the  <br/>
&gt; equivalent in your own common phrasing--not that very phrase, but  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;d&#39;ve said that,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But in this case, I feel in building the relationship, that it<br/>
is more important to prioritize finding a way for him to get<br/>
gum that doesn&#39;t involve stealing it than it is to set up the<br/>
if/then contract about gum-chewing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would (and I have, often) give them a kleenex or paper napkin, too,  <br/>
&gt; and say &quot;keep this to put the gum in when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have shown him how to keep the wrapper, and how to put the <br/>
gum in the wrapper when he is done with it, but he&#39;s not choosing<br/>
to do that.  Or, he&#39;s just forgetting.  It&#39;s easier just to spit the gum<br/>
out, and he&#39;s coming from a culture where spitting (saliva) in public<br/>
(even indoors) is not considered impolite.<br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  It doesn&#39;t need to be a lecture about  littering, but they did <br/>
&gt; know that there were fines for littering. I&#39;d  read signs to them <br/>
&gt; as a matter of course, about the rules of parks or  whatever.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, it feels that way to me, too, that he should be aware of the<br/>
rules.  He can understand that there are different rules in a park<br/>
than there are at home.  <br/>
<br/>
But here, again, is the mental roadblock I&#39;m setting up for myself<br/>
vis-a-vis chores:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you chew the gum and I have  to pick it up.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay.  But then, why not:  &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you left your dirty<br/>
dishes in front of the Playstation and I have to pick them up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so on.  There is a slippery slope and a tendency to fall<br/>
back into have tos.  If he doesn&#39;t have to carry his own dirty<br/>
dishes to the sink or his own dirty laundry to the hamper,<br/>
why should he have to carry his garbage to the garbage can?<br/>
Because there are seven people sharing these rooms and six<br/>
of us don&#39;t like that level of mess? <br/>
<br/>
Can I tell him that it&#39;s not fair for him to make certain messes,<br/>
but that he&#39;s completely encouraged to make others? <br/>
<br/>
And then, we could go to the other extreme; we&#39;ve got one son <br/>
who thrives on peace and quiet and order.  That is not our house,<br/>
not usually.  There are ongoing board games left out.  (Civilization <br/>
--old school, board game version--takes a long time to play!  <br/>
Chess, too, if each person is only making a move<br/>
once or twice a day.)  There are science projects in various stages.<br/>
There is artwork being made, or drying, or whatever.  There<br/>
is music being played, usually homemade, on various instruments<br/>
we enjoy playing, but occasionally coming out of the iPod.  There<br/>
are books and video game cartridges lying about.  There are puzzles<br/>
in various stages of creation.  My extremely neat son sees all of<br/>
this as &quot;mess.&quot;  The rest of us see &quot;fun&quot; and &quot;creativity.&quot;  I tidy things<br/>
up to the extent that I can, without interfering with other&#39;s creations,<br/>
when I get around to it, but usually I choose to be in the middle of<br/>
all the fun and creativity.  I focus on having clean dishes to eat<br/>
off of and clean clothes to wear.  Still, gum stuck to the floor, or<br/>
in the carpet?  That, personally, is where I draw the line.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have tone of voice or body language here, so I do<br/>
want to say that I feeling defensive, confrontational, or argumentative.<br/>
I *am* feeling confused.  I read and re-read the pages (chores, <br/>
gratitude, balance, have to, screw it up) and sometimes, as<br/>
now, I get stuck.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the variety of suggestions being offered, I am <br/>
hearing the very sound advice to put the relationship first.<br/>
That is where I can focus when I am breathing and choosing.<br/>

they see out and about.  That in itself probably answers my<br/>
question:  lots of good role models for kid #5!<br/>
<br/>
Around here, though, we have to be *very* careful when<br/>
we pick up litter.  We live very close to campus,<br/>
surrounded by fraternities, and some of the litter is harmless<br/>
to pick up:  pizza boxes, fast food wrappers.  But much of<br/>
it is perhaps dangerous:  e.g, broken beer bottles or old, rusty<br/>
cans.  And then there are the, ahem, used prophylactics left in the <br/>

dorm rooms, apartments, someplace else to go other than the woods?)<br/>

<br/>
Those are unrelated things.  If he&#39;s made to buy his own gum, you  <br/>
don&#39;t get to say no.  If you have a great big stash of gum (or even a  <br/>
fivepack) and all he needs to do is ask, and agree to put it in the  <br/>
trash when he&#39;s done, the questions about stealing or buying aren&#39;t  <br/>
any part of it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Can I tell him that it&#39;s not fair for him to make certain messes,<br/>
but that he&#39;s completely encouraged to make others? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know of anyone who completely encourages a child to make a  <br/>
mess.   Eating a meal isn&#39;t &quot;making a mess.&quot;  Doing an art project  <br/>
isn&#39;t &quot;making a mess,&quot; although there can be a fair amount of  <br/>
cleanup.   Chewing gum isn&#39;t such a communal, productive thing.  It&#39;s  <br/>
personal.  It&#39;s something that comes out of a person, filled with the  <br/>
potential of germs.<br/>
<br/>
If I pick up Keith&#39;s juice cup, it&#39;s not unsanitary.    He didn&#39;t put  <br/>
the cup where it will stick to carpet or stick to the bottom of socks  <br/>
or shoes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think your focus is on turning him into someone who doesn&#39;t drop  <br/>
gum and other litter. If a parent has given a child information and  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t do it then the explanation seems to be he either doesn&#39;t  <br/>
understand -- so the parent explains again and again -- or he&#39;s  <br/>
essentially saying screw you -- so the parent gets mad.<br/>
<br/>
A viewpoint that will help you respond without that baggage is seeing  <br/>
that he can&#39;t yet understand or he can&#39;t yet attach the understanding  <br/>
to action. It&#39;s possible he&#39;s focused on something else and he is  <br/>
oblivious to his actions. His ability to focus will increase with age  <br/>
but you can&#39;t force it to happen sooner. You can make the intervening  <br/>
time unpleasant, though if you&#39;re frustrated that he&#39;s not someone  <br/>
other than who he is right now.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, you be his awareness. Call his attention with &quot;Gum!&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Trash!&quot; or &quot;Hey, let&#39;s get that in the trash.&quot; When you bring his  <br/>
awareness, don&#39;t bring it to an unpleasant atmosphere (frustration,  <br/>
anger, humiliation, spills of information.) He won&#39;t want to bring  <br/>
his awareness to that! Trust he&#39;s doing the best he can with the  <br/>
information and skills he has right now. Help him do better.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you chew the gum and I have to pick it up.&quot;)<br/>

&gt; dishes in front of the Playstation and I have to pick them up.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that doesn&#39;t sound helpful, don&#39;t do it. It might work with some  <br/>
kids. Depends where their head is in the situation.<br/>
<br/>
The point is to bring awareness to a situation to help him, not set  <br/>
up rules.<br/>

Is your son perhaps dealing with some oppositional behavior due to the attachment issues?  If so, it is possible, not that he doesnt understand that gum shouldnt be thrown on the floor (or other trash) but that he knows you dont want him to do this.  I assume you have asked him to pick it up several times, and expressed your unhappiness with it being thrown down.<br/>
I think in your cirumstances I would bring a trashcan to him and say, &quot;hey lets clean up this mess&quot;, and proceed to clean up, if he helps great, if he doesnt ignore it.</div>

teamwork and helpfulness. Years.<br/>
<br/>
Reminding you that we&#39;re not offering a &quot;technique&quot; that &quot;works&quot; to <br/>
magically get your kid to do what you want them to do. I googled around <br/>
looking for parenting advice - haven&#39;t done that in quite a long time. <br/>
This is typical of what parenting &quot;experts&quot; are promising:<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;*Tips That Will Help You Gain Control Over Your Kids. Get Them to Do <br/>
What You Want Them To Do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are not promising that.<br/>
<br/>
I have a 24 year old who has lived on her own for a few years. She was <br/>
messy at home - when she was younger it was a HUGE issue here in our <br/>
house. I didn&#39;t handle it well at all. I felt resentful that I &quot;had to&quot; <br/>
clean up after her. I made up all kinds of different reward systems that <br/>
didn&#39;t work out. I yelled and begged and cried. WHAT  a waste!! Later, <br/>
when she was older, I read what others were writing about chores and I <br/>
changed. I did a little more work around the house and did it with a <br/>
happy-to-be-able-to-do-it attitude.<br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t suddenly change and start doing housework.  But, the <br/>
shaming and fighting stopped. Instantly. I had THAT in my control all <br/>
the time. After a few years (remember, my kids were already teens when I <br/>
started this), one day I realized that they were really helpful. I <br/>
noticed that they jump up to carry in groceries when I come home from <br/>
the store. I&#39;d notice the dishwasher was unloaded. I&#39;d notice someone <br/>
had picked up the living room clutter - straightened up. When we have <br/>
company coming over, I&#39;d start cleaning up and the kids would just seem <br/>
to naturally jump in to help. Rosie sort of took on cleaning the <br/>
bathroom as her regular thing and just does it once in a while. Rox <br/>
notices when the living room needs dusting and just does it. We&#39;re at <br/>
the point that I can say, &quot;If anybody has  time, can you do a load of <br/>
dishes?&quot; and probably someone will.<br/>
<br/>
My 24 year old in her own house? She lives pretty much the same way we <br/>
do - her house gets messy when she&#39;s busy. When she has more at-home <br/>
time her house is nice and neat. She&#39;s fixed it up beautifully - painted <br/>
in lovely colors and lots of artwork. Slowly, she&#39;s collected some nice <br/>
furniture pieces - other people&#39;s give-aways, etc. Her little house is <br/>
wonderful - very comfy and peaceful and inviting. People like to go hang <br/>
out there, with her. Isn&#39;t that what really matters?<br/>
<br/>
There are at least these three reasons people have &quot;chore battles&quot; with <br/>
their kids.<br/>
<br/>
1. They want the kids to help clean up because they want the cleaning <br/>
done and don&#39;t want to do it all themselves. They feel resentful at <br/>
cleaning up after other people or when other people are having fun.<br/>
2. They want the kids to help clean up because they think the kids &quot;need <br/>
to learn how&quot; to do chores so that they can do them when they grow up.<br/>
3. They want the kids to help clean because they want to be in charge, <br/>
they want their kids to be obedient, this is something they can order <br/>
them to do and they want their kids to obey orders.<br/>
<br/>
#1 -- battles over chores are far worse than doing it yourself in a <br/>
happy, peaceful way. Better to create a sweet and calm atmosphere in <br/>
your house - if you can do that by doing a little more &quot;picking up&quot; for <br/>
other people, why not?<br/>
<br/>
#2 - kids shamed and badgered and coerced with bribes and punishments <br/>
will grow up resenting housework, too. Vicious cycle is being <br/>
perpetuated. They don&#39;t need to do chores for years and years to learn <br/>
how to do them. It isn&#39;t rocket science. They can learn when they need <br/>
to learn. They can learn a lot more from voluntarily and happily joining <br/>
in a time or two than from years of force which creates resistance.<br/>
<br/>
#3 - what do you really want? Is following orders at the top of your <br/>
priorities? Is it that important to you to feel in control that you&#39;re <br/>
willing to have almost daily struggles with your kids over it? Is that <br/>
the kind of relationship you want to build with your kids?<br/>

My son  spent his first five years in the NJ foster system.  He had many unwelcome behaviors when he joined us. He was hypervigilant and would look everywhere for something of value.  So on a city street he would be picking things up like bird feathers, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
He also has a hard time picking up after himself, he will help me willingly whenever i ask him to do anything but seems to feel unloved if I want him to be responsible for his messes.<br/>
<br/>
What has worked for us over the last six years is to be very consistent in our requests, and to help him to do whatever he can&#39;t do by himself.  Robbie seems to respond to this and feel supported by it.<br/>
<br/>
It has taken 6 years to extinguish about 90% of the scavenging.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you chew the gum and I have to pick it up.&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay. But then, why not: &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you left your dirty<br/>
&gt; dishes in front of the Playstation and I have to pick them up.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And so on. There is a slippery slope and a tendency to fall<br/>
&gt; back into have tos. If he doesn&#39;t have to carry his own dirty<br/>
&gt; dishes to the sink or his own dirty laundry to the hamper,<br/>
&gt; why should he have to carry his garbage to the garbage can?<br/>
&gt; Because there are seven people sharing these rooms and six<br/>
&gt; of us don&#39;t like that level of mess?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where the logical reasoning behind why we do things matters a<br/>
great deal.  Dirty dishes left next to the PS isn&#39;t going to get stuck<br/>
on someone&#39;s foot or ground into the carpet.  Dirty dishes can sit there<br/>
for a day and probably be just fine, unless you live in a house with<br/>
lots of natural pesty invaders such as ants or cocroaches.<br/>
<br/>
It works the same for dirty laundry.  If the laundry is dirty, why would<br/>
it be weird for it to be on the floor instead of the hamper.  The only<br/>
distinction that we&#39;ve made with dirty clothes, is if it&#39;s wet and<br/>
dirty, put it in the bathtub or on the bathroom floor, so that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t get moldy and gross or get other things moldy and gross.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can I tell him that it&#39;s not fair for him to make certain messes,<br/>
&gt; but that he&#39;s completely encouraged to make others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you can tell him, is WHY you prefer one thing over another and hope<br/>
that he honors it, and until he can, do it for him.  Before you tell him<br/>
why, really consider it yourself first.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1697069970">I personally don&#39;t like getting into a thought process that involves &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
not fair&quot;. For me that thinking is a mental slippery slope into a litany of <br/>
all kinds of other unfairness in my life, most of which are the result of <br/>
willing choices that I have made. Some might consider it unfair that I stay <br/>
up all night with my dd because she needs my company, or that I arrange my <br/>
writing schedule around her, or that I happily pick up after my dh and dd, <br/>
or conversely that I get to stay home with my kid and often my dh.<br/>
<br/>
The world isn&#39;t necessarily fair. We live in a world where merit is not <br/>
necessarily rewarded as much as notoriety, and a man&#39;s inheritance can be <br/>
stolen from him by a stepmother&#39;s malice. People unschooling in New York <br/>
have endless hoops to jump through that I am free from in California.<br/>
<br/>
If I happen to have PMS on a particular day, ideas about unfairness can send <br/>
me into tears.<br/>
<br/>
It starts me on to a path of what other people &quot;should&quot; be doing, how *they* <br/>
should change, instead of focussing on what I can change - my own attitude <br/>
and behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Best not to go there at all for me. Best to keep on joyfully helping my <br/>
family be happy and peaceful by doing all I want to without worrying about <br/>
fair.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve written many times that Jayn is far more willing to carry my plate to <br/>
the kitchen, than hers. She is still like that. When she is visiting homes <br/>
where they have rules about carrying your own plate to the kitchen or trash <br/>
to the bin, she just does it. I could consider that she is still being <br/>
unfair to me by keeping her best behavior for visiting, but I&#39;m don&#39;t - I&#39;m <br/>
relieved and happy to know that she is nice when out of my sight.<br/>
<br/>
I loved that idea about children feeling loved when taken care of and helped <br/>
by having mom be ready to take the gum from them instead of getting caught <br/>
up in what is fair. It may be that that little boy has had to deal with a <br/>
lot of unfairness in his life already.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196562996">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He was hypervigilant and would look everywhere for something of value. <br/>
So on a city street he would be picking things up like bird feathers, etc. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jayn, attachment parented since birth, used to pick up treasures too and <br/>
collect little rocks, feathers, leaves, or seed pods from the ground when we <br/>
were out of the house. She would give them to me to bring home. Other people <br/>
have written about it happening. I used to just take the stuff from her, <br/>
usually putting it in the front pocket of the food bag, and she would <br/>
sometimes want it later, but usually forget about the bits and pieces once <br/>
we were home.<br/>
<br/>
I think collecting found stuff is a developmental stage. This might be an <br/>
issue of the extent of it. Perhaps some normal developmental things are <br/>
taken to extremes in kids with histories like your son.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And he may feel the need to dole some back out?<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids is sick and pukes, or accidentally spills a drink,  <br/>
or is invited to do something COOL and so I offer to pick up and put  <br/>
away paints and glue and paper clippings, those things are cleaning up  <br/>
after children out of love, and out of helping them have opportunities  <br/>
to be better and to do fun things.<br/>
<br/>
If one of my kids spit on the floor ten or twelve times, just to do  <br/>
it, or poured a drink out on the floor on purpose and walked away, or  <br/>
took out paints and cut up paper and poured glue on a plate and then  <br/>
went to pick on a sibling or some other irritating thing, the cleanup  <br/>
of those things would not be in NEARLY the same category.<br/>
<br/>
Cleaning up after someone who has eaten a meal for sustenance is not  <br/>
the same as picking gum up off the ground.<br/>
Picking up supplies after a child has wrapped a gift to mail away is  <br/>
sweet.  Picking up candy wrappers from a couch or living room carpet  <br/>
isn&#39;t in the same category.<br/>
<br/>
Help lovinging offered to someone who is doing her best isn&#39;t the same  <br/>
as being abused by someone who&#39;s being expressive by being destructive  <br/>
or inconsiderate.  The message in those can be &quot;I really don&#39;t care  <br/>
about you, and I don&#39;t care if you don&#39;t like what I do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not fair&quot; wasn&#39;t the best choice of words.   &quot;It&#39;s not right&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;it&#39;s not good&quot; or &quot;it&#39;s not okay&quot; or &quot;I really don&#39;t like it&quot; could  <br/>
cover the same ground.<br/>

I am new to this list, but not new to homeschooling or international adoption.  I think you are correct that building bonds has to be a top priority.  But in my experience children who have come from institutional settings needs lots of structure in the beginning to feel secure.   It is easier for them to learn how to fit in if they have an idea what is expected of them in a consistent way.<br/>
Lots of love and understanding is really very important as well as lots of patience, but kids do need to know what is normal in the family as well. It is a delicate balance.  <br/>

&gt; -=-Yes, yes, yes, and yes. That is why I am asking the questions;-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The reason it was worth asking is that some people jump to dire<br/>
&gt; conclusions, or ask us if we let them eat M&Ms, what will we do when<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re shooting heroin.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it were me, I would not give gum to a child who had spit it out<br/>
&gt; that way.   If they wanted gum, I would say &quot;I&#39;m afraid if I give this<br/>
&gt; to you I&#39;ll end up having to pick it up, and that&#39;s yucky.&quot; (or the<br/>
&gt; equivalent in your own common phrasing--not that very phrase, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d&#39;ve said that, or &quot;It&#39;s not fair that you chew the gum and I have<br/>
&gt; to pick it up.&quot;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then either they could pretend not to want the gum anymore, which is<br/>
&gt; fine, or they could say please, or I&#39;ll pick it up, or whatever.  Then<br/>
&gt; I would (and I have, often) give them a kleenex or paper napkin, too,<br/>
&gt; and say &quot;keep this to put the gum in when you&#39;re done.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Very occasionally one of my kids would drop trash, or set it down and<br/>
&gt; it would blow away.  I&#39;d say &quot;Hey, look,&quot; or &quot;Could you get that,<br/>
&gt; please?&quot; and they would.   It doesn&#39;t need to be a lecture about<br/>
&gt; littering, but they did know that there were fines for littering. I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; read signs to them as a matter of course, about the rules of parks or<br/>
&gt; whatever.  Not every time, just if it was interesting or we were new<br/>
&gt; to a particular park or town or situation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, this is just so obvious it&#39;s surprising it needs to be said.   <br/>
If you want gum, you have to dispose of it properly; I can&#39;t imagine  <br/>
condoning a child dropping gum on the floor, even outdoors.  Like  <br/>
Sandra, I&#39;d provide a piece of paper or tissue, and point the child to  <br/>
the nearest trash can.  That&#39;s a simple task -- the harder one of  <br/>
cleaning gum off the sole of the shoe would fall to me.<br/>
<br/>
Some of us grew up with &quot;Every Litter Bit Hurts&quot; ad campaigns, and the  <br/>
Crying Indian commercial of &quot;Keep America Beautiful&quot;:<br/>

Powerful propaganda when you&#39;re a kid &lt;g&gt;  I sure as heck don&#39;t  <br/>
