<div id="ygrps-yiv-46844811">I wrote something about this the  other day, and have been thinking about it <br/>
a lot since.  I think it&#39;s  common and people do it without thinking, but I <br/>
can see a lot of problems with  people asking and kids declaring &quot;what they want <br/>
to be,&quot; or worse, &quot;What are you  GOING to be?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
In the June 13 People  magazine there&#39;s an article about childhood sports <br/>
injuries--knee surgeries,  ankle surgery in young female gymnasts, etc.  It chats <br/>
on and on, but  ends with a quote from one of the doctors being interviewed:<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Some of these youngsters need to  decide if they want to be all-stars as <br/>
kids, or all-stars when they grow  up.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Although in retrospect people will  say &quot;He decided to be an all-star and now <br/>
he is one!&quot; what percentage of people  who &quot;decided to be an all-star&quot; ended <br/>
up NOT being?  Regardless of what it  looks like in hindsight, it&#39;s not <br/>
something someone can &quot;decide.&quot;    And so those youngsters not only do NOT &quot;need to <br/>
decide,&quot; they can&#39;t possibly  &quot;decide.&quot;  They can decide to risk injury for <br/>
present competitive joy and  the hope of dodging the injury and getting a <br/>
scholarship or getting to the  olympics or whatever.  That&#39;s a decision they can <br/>
make.  They can  decide NOT to risk it and find other things to do.  But they <br/>
cannot decide  to be all-stars, now or later.  <br/>
 <br/>
I was talking a little of similar  things with Pam Sorooshian, and it&#39;s just <br/>
simply about definitions of &quot;being&quot;  (and there is no discussion of what it <br/>
means &quot;to be&quot; that isn&#39;t purely  philosophy, but a very practical kind of <br/>
philosophy).   Pam wrote  this:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
-=-[Roya] tried on the idea that she&#39;d  major in art, in college, but got to <br/>
be 20 and decided she wanted to think about  what kind of WORK she&#39;d enjoy <br/>
doing, to make a living, and couldn&#39;t figure out  why she&#39;d want a college degree <br/>
in art - she does her art for its own sake,  doesn&#39;t need a degree in it to <br/>
&quot;be&quot; an artist.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
In lots of people&#39;s definitions, &quot;being&quot; means having a college degree, or  <br/>
being paid a salary and having that thing &quot;artist&quot; or &quot;player&quot; in your job  <br/>
description, on your business card, at the bottom of the tax forms where you  <br/>
declare your occupation.   And then there are the FAILED &quot;beings,&quot;  like former <br/>
priests, former teachers, former athletes.  They are BEING a  former-something. <br/>
 That&#39;s weird.  Not &quot;I used to be an athlete,&quot; but  &quot;I am a former athlete.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
That doesn&#39;t work with everything.  There are just a few &quot;occupations&quot;  that <br/>
last a lifetime.  You become an ex- forever.  Ex-cop.   Former nun.   It never <br/>
goes away.  <br/>
 <br/>
I told Holly the other day after a conversation in which she showed some  <br/>
amazing insight into some parenting she had seen that she thought was not well  <br/>
reasoned, &quot;You are going to be a great mom.&quot;  Then I thought maybe she&#39;ll  <br/>
never be a mom for some reason, and didn&#39;t like having said what I said, so I  <br/>
said, &quot;Or a great relative of kids, and a great friend.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
She looked at me a little long, like she was wondering if I was joking, or  <br/>
building up to another statement, and said &quot;I already am.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
She understands &quot;being&quot; better than I do, because she has grown up  being.<br/>
I grew up being maybe in the way, or being wrong, or being too noisy or  <br/>
being a smart-aleck.  <br/>
I was asked what I was going to be when I grew up, but I was constantly  TOLD <br/>
what I was being at the moment.  I was not hungry, I had nothing to  cry <br/>
about, I was asking too many questions.  My being was defined by how I  affected <br/>
the adults around me.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly has a lot of experience being Holly.  <br/>
She has years of being heard, and being respected, and being whole.<br/>
When she is older, no matter what she does, she will still be Holly.<br/>
Her doing won&#39;t be her being.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I often think about these things too, Sandra. I don&#39;t think my DH or <br/>
mother know how to &quot;be&quot; without &quot;doing&quot;. I grew up being told how I <br/>
should feel, how I should think about things, how I should act, what <br/>
I should do, and that never included just &quot;being&quot; me. I think my <br/>
mother still lives by alot of the &quot;shoulds&quot; she taught me, and that <br/>
prevents her from knowing how to just &quot;be&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Recently my husband and I met another married couple, and after the <br/>
husbands talked a little bit about what they &quot;did&quot;, the wife turned <br/>
to me and asked, &quot;So, what do you do Deanne?&quot; I hesistated, and <br/>
almost didn&#39;t answer because I was so caught up in my own thoughts <br/>
of being vs. doing. I thought: I DO lots of things. You mean my <br/>
work? I&#39;m leaving my position anyway. I don&#39;t know if I want to <br/>
explain what my job is anyway. I don&#39;t want you to make assumptions <br/>
about me from my job. Well, I could say I&#39;m a home educator. People <br/>
are usually so impressed, &#39;How do you do it?&#39; No, that&#39;s a lie, and <br/>
pompous. I&#39;ll never see these people again anyway, maybe I should <br/>
just make up something exotic lik Babara Sher suggested in her talk <br/>
at Live and Learn last year. Yeah! What can I say? What can I say? <br/>
Oh no, they&#39;re all looking at me waiting for an answer! &quot;I&#39;m a <br/>
homemaker,&quot; I replied. The other woman said, &quot;Me too.&quot; Then the <br/>
conversation turned to kids and homeschooling. (DH breathed a sigh of<br/>
relief. He thought I was gearing up for a rant about something in <br/>
that in that 10 seconds or so that I took to reply.&lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the things I love most about unschooling, it&#39;s the <br/>
freedom my kids have to just &quot;be&quot;.  They are valued and appreciated <br/>
for who they are, not because of what they do. They don&#39;t have to <br/>
conform themselves to &quot;be&quot; a certain way or &quot;do&quot; things to meet the <br/>
demands of the school system in order to feel valued. Of course we <br/>
celebrate their successes with them, but they are self-initiated <br/>
activities that have intrinsic value. <br/>
<br/>
Can you tell this is a hot topic for me? I must go however, to meet <br/>
more basic needs - food and water.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the post. What you wrote about Holly was beautiful. I&#39;m <br/>
grateful that I have experienced  a similar exchange with my 8yo <br/>
daughter. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-641310442">Andy is 5 now. When we discuss our lives, he knows that being<br/>
self-employed (with our cleaning business) is the way Dave and I earn<br/>
money to pay bills, provide food, buy fun stuff...and also the way we<br/>
make sure that one of us can always be with him. And also the way we<br/>
do something for money which we really love doing. It&#39;s a total-life<br/>
choice, not just a &quot;job&quot; choice. We talk about that, about how we feel<br/>
really happy with our choices, about how life is full of choices- and<br/>
we choose to focus on things which make us feel happy, fulfilled,<br/>
curious, interested...everything we are doing in our lives now feels<br/>
right, feels connected to who we are. Our choices nurture our Being.<br/>
Our choices ARE our Being! <br/>
<br/>
When anyone asks about his future career plans, Andy replies, &quot;When I<br/>
grow up, I&#39;m gonna sell stuff on the Internet to make money.&quot; :-) I<br/>
hope he always sees that there&#39;s a way to form your whole life around<br/>
what you love. And that he always respects his life passions more than<br/>
the opinions of others.<br/>
<br/>
And that, if he wants, he answers people in Barbara Sher fashion. &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
an Arachnid Communications Specialist.&quot;<br/>
