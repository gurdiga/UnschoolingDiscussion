<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998139734">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Someone who is or used to be on this group has a husband who&#39;s a <br/>
railroad engineer. Would you let me know?  My son is a certified <br/>
railroad fiend and I&#39;m seeking detailed information on being an <br/>
engineer, like when and where do they eat, where do they sleep when <br/>
they&#39;re away from home. I like to tell them stories and I don&#39;t have <br/>
enough details to fill in the engineer one.<br/>
<br/>
We could also talk on the phone--email me, please!<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane</div>

A friend of mine drove trains here for a while.  He would go from Albuquerque <br/>
to Gallup and back, so he slept at home.  Someone from Arizona would go from <br/>
his house to Gallup and then back, so neither of the routes was the whole <br/>
distance.<br/>

with an engineer/railroad worker for a husband. I&#39;ve forwarded the info on to <br/>
Sharon.<br/>
