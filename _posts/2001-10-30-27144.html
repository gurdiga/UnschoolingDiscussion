<div id="ygrps-yiv-572024353">I am no expert on Israel, but I think part of the reason that the US<br/>
supported an Israeli state after World War Two, was because of the<br/>
extermination policies,  the loss of all assets, land, families,etc. A<br/>
teeny, tiny fraction of land that used to be a larger Israel was supported<br/>
by the US at the begging of some guy, Jake somebody??<br/>
I am not advocating if it was right or not, but there is an interesting<br/>
history at www.csmoniter.com It appears at the top right hand corner.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758756704">Well Bridget,<br/>
  I guess I am a contradiction on such topics, because I cannot make sense<br/>
out of them. On one hand, I understand the outrage and urge to protest<br/>
(having done it myself on more trivial issues), on the other, I think many<br/>
people are more into the energetic high of protesting itself; lose sight of<br/>
the problem and self serving motives take over-maybe not intentionally.<br/>
I do wonder why many protests  begin on college campuses in the US. It has<br/>
crossed my mind that this is not coincidental, but an intentional target by<br/>
whoever.<br/>
Maybe I am way off, but lots of protests don&#39;t even involve students. Are<br/>
there laws that make college campuses a better forum than city hall? Do<br/>
people just mature and use other means? Are 18 to 25 year olds more intuned<br/>
to the world. I really don&#39;t know.<br/>
I just get nauseated by all of the romanticized versions of the sixties, a<br/>
cool time of peace and love, yea right. Some of the biggest names in &quot;peace&quot;<br/>
were violent. All of the  books, movies, and TV shows that explain how<br/>
Eisenhower got us in the war,then Nixon prolonged it, totally glossing over<br/>
Kennedy committing thousands of troops and Johnson profiting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2133541278">**Could we please cut this thread and get back to the reason we all here and <br/>
the one subject we can mostly all agree on, Unschooling!**<br/>
<br/>
Start a new thread. Don&#39;t read what annoys you. Start talking about what <br/>
you&#39;re interested in, get other folks interested with you. <br/>
<br/>
This is the essence of unschooling, for adults and kids too. Don&#39;t tell <br/>
people they shouldn&#39;t be interested in something because you aren&#39;t, don&#39;t <br/>
expect them to do and say exactly what you are interested in doing and <br/>
saying. If you want to learn about something, do it. If you want to show <br/>
people something wonderful, do it. If you want to stop listening and go read <br/>
a book, do it. Don&#39;t drag your kids off from what they&#39;re interested in to do <br/>
what you think is important, and don&#39;t shush adults either.<br/>
<br/>
It IS a free country. The framers of our constitution established free speech <br/>
as a right PRECISELY for situations like this, so that no one need ever fear <br/>
criticizing their government, it&#39;s actions, or it&#39;s policies. If it truly is <br/>
the greatest nation on earth that is a huge reason why.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in hearing everything folks have to say on all sides of this, <br/>
except I&#39;d like to ask the shushers to please, go ahead and talk about <br/>
something else but allow the rest of these folks to talk in peace here <br/>
without trying to shut them up. Their opinions can&#39;t hurt you or our country. <br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-595726937">The cities were Berkeley, SF, Oakland, various other Bay Area cities and LA.<br/>
I already had a high level DEA agent look in the Berkeley police files and<br/>
the files no longer exist.  You can find references to the &quot;unrest&quot; and<br/>
&quot;near riots&quot; in the local newspapers but the only references you will hear<br/>
about Patty are all sugar coated, sanitized and portray her as a victim.<br/>
<br/>
You have to understand that her father owned the newspapers and a large<br/>
portion of the real estate in California at the time.  He donated large sums<br/>
of money to the university.  He employed a large % of the population in one<br/>
way or another in the Bay Area.  If he wanted it sanitized or removed, it<br/>
was done!<br/>
<br/>
You can probably find references to Nancy Ling Perry that will verify that<br/>
she was a resident of Santa Rosa, California.  That her parents owned a<br/>
furniture store in Santa Rosa.  That she was an honor student at Montgomery<br/>
High School and graduated in the Class of &#39;65.  I can scan yearbook<br/>
pictures, but that only proves I have the yearbooks.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is you won&#39;t find the truth unless you find others that were<br/>
there.  That is what a cover up is all about.  The official voice says<br/>
&quot;blah, blah, blah&quot; and that is what is kept everywhere and they make the big<br/>
noise so that the general public won&#39;t believe the individual who was<br/>
actually there.<br/>
<br/>
Where did you get your info on what protestors had at Kent State?  All of<br/>
the government agencies even admit that the shooting didn&#39;t start from the<br/>
protestors.  And, all the stuff they were suppose to be carrying sounds like<br/>
government propaganda to excuse their actions.<br/>

bashing.  The facts are that he was AWOL, that is not bashing.  The facts<br/>
are that he was arrested THREE times, not once, that is not bashing.  The<br/>
facts are that he ran his oil business into the ground and to near<br/>
bankruptsy and then was rescued by one of daddy&#39;s friends, not bashing.  The<br/>
facts are that while governor of Texas he let $34 million in aide for poor<br/>
children be lost because he and he alone failed to sign the forms, not<br/>
bashing.  The facts are that while he was governor he put into effect the<br/>

after the kidnapping event that at least hinted of her involvement in radical<br/>
causes.  They didn&#39;t flat out say that she had herself kidnapped, but they<br/>
didn&#39;t rule it out, either.<br/>
<br/>
The stuff I remember was pretty general, and didn&#39;t quote her friends, but<br/>
maybe at least one reporter caught a whiff of it.  (Talked to someone off the<br/>
record, perhaps, or received third hand gossip.)<br/>
<br/>
It would be fairly easy, for the person who wanted sources, to dig up<br/>
microfilmed Chronicles from that time period and see that there were at least<br/>
questions about the authenticity of the kidnapping.<br/>

We took the kidlets down to the Bay Area a couple of years ago so they could<br/>

a night at the Claremont.  Drove past all the old fun places, took them to<br/>
Fairyland, Jack London Square, Lake Merit, Tildon Park and then had dinner<br/>
at the Cliff House.<br/>
<br/>
What was really weird was when we drove past the first grammar school I went<br/>
to, Nystrom.  When I went there it was in the middle of the projects and was<br/>
the largest grammar school in the U.S.  Now it looks like something out of a<br/>

&gt; &gt;You can probably find references to Nancy Ling Perry that will verify<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt;she was a resident of Santa Rosa, California.  That her parents owned a<br/>
&gt; &gt;furniture store in Santa Rosa.  That she was an honor student at<br/>
Montgomery<br/>
&gt; &gt;High School and graduated in the Class of &#39;65.  I can scan yearbook<br/>
&gt; &gt;pictures, but that only proves I have the yearbooks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sounds like we were growing up pretty close together at the same time.  If<br/>
&gt; I had graduated, instead of becoming an unschooler, I would have graduated<br/>
&gt; from Berkeley High in &#39;66.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The cities were Berkeley, SF, Oakland, various other Bay Area cities and<br/>
LA.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I already had a high level DEA agent look in the Berkeley police files<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the files no longer exist.  You can find references to the &quot;unrest&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;near riots&quot; in the local newspapers but the only references you will<br/>
hear<br/>
&gt; &gt; about Patty are all sugar coated, sanitized and portray her as a victim.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is not how I remember the case.  I remember watching a number of shows<br/>
with my Dad where she was portrayed as a rebellious, deliquent, spoiled,<br/>
rich, white kid.<br/>
