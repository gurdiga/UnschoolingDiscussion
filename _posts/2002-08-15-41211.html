The history of Indian and European scalping <br/>
<br/>
How did the Indians start scalping their victims? Very simply, they learned <br/>
it from the European settlers. A few Indian tribes had practiced scalping to <br/>
a very limited extent before the Europeans arrived. More often than not, <br/>
scalping was practiced as a response in kind. The Eurpoeans had taught them, <br/>
first hand, the horror of viewing the mutilated remains of their families and <br/>
friends after an attack by white settlers. By inflicting the same mutilation <br/>
on their enemies they had hoped to stem the onslaught of these white settlers <br/>
that were invading their land. To some Indians,if the attacks could not stop <br/>
the whites, at least it would send the message that they were prepared to be <br/>
as unscrupulous as the Europeans. The Iroquois in particular, used scalping <br/>
to this purpose. <br/>
 In the 11th century, the Earl of Wessex scalped his enemies. When the <br/>
English and the Dutch came to the new world they brought the custom with <br/>
them. This activity was brought not so much as an official method of warfare, <br/>
but as a bounty to ease the anger of the frontiersmen. The western border of <br/>
the colonies was being populated with settlers that were comprised of a <br/>
dubious lot. They were outlaws and runaways. With them they brought disease <br/>
and alcohol. The frontier was a breeding ground for conflict with the Indian <br/>
population. Initially the frontiersmen turned on the Indians in an attempt to <br/>
move them off the land. When the Indians retaliated, the settlers turned to <br/>
the government for help. The settlers demanded retribution for the Indian <br/>
reprisals. The Dutch, and soon after the English, government created the <br/>
scalp bounty as a means to pacify the settlers. Simply, they paid a fee for <br/>
each scalp that was delivered to the locally appointed magistrate. Although <br/>
the army was accomplishing the task of displacing the Indians, the bounty <br/>
encouraged settlers to mount attacks on the Indians whenever they could. In <br/>
1703, Massachusetts paid 12 pounds for an Indian scalp. By 1723 the price had <br/>
soared to 100 pounds. To the frontiersmen, it did not matter if the scalp <br/>
came from an Indian or a white man. All that mattered was the bonus. The <br/>
practice eventually became widespread. The French used the bounty on scalps <br/>
to eradicate a peaceful tribe in Newfoundland. During the French and Indian <br/>
Wars, the English offered their troops a bounty of 200 pounds for the scalp <br/>
of the chief of the Delaware tribe, Shinngass. This was 25 times the price <br/>
that they offered their Indian allies for the scalp of a French soldier. This <br/>
practice of paying a bounty for Indian scalps continued into the 19th century <br/>
before the public put an end to the practice. This practice of paying a scalp <br/>
bounty inspired a widespread retaliation from the Indians. White frontiersmen <br/>
would scalp not only the warriors but also the women and the children. In <br/>
many cases the scalp was not even taken from an Indian. The government could <br/>
not tell the difference. However, the Indians were blamed for initiating the <br/>
practice, because no European would stoop so low as to take a scalp. It <br/>
should also be noted that only the Indians were held accountable for the <br/>
practice. <br/>
