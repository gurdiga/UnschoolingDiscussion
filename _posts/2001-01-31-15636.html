<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522533970">Hey all. I know I don&#39;t post often. Seems like since I joined the list<br/>
my kids have been taking turns with one cold after another. And lately<br/>
it has been my turn to sit in the bed with a box of tissues as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow I just need to share. Maybe get something off my chest. I am sure<br/>
people have doubts when they are homeschooling if they are doing the<br/>
right thing. And sometimes I think the doubts are easier to get into<br/>
when we unschool. I recently saw something on tv that had a<br/>
homeschooling family in it and the kids were all sitting nicely at the<br/>
table doing work out of book. I thought isnt that sweet. Then looked<br/>
around at my family and thought gees maybe I should be pushing more for<br/>
them to do &quot;real&quot; work. Like books and paper and such. Of course a few<br/>
mintues later I was thinking what the heck just got into me. I want my<br/>
kids to be individuals and learn at thier own pace and learn what they<br/>
want and discover along the way who they are. But sometimes I wonder<br/>
about the choices I make as a parent.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is harder since it seems I find so little in common with<br/>
famlies here locally. I don&#39;t know many families that do family bed or<br/>
use cloth diapers or breastfeed past a few months. My choices I make<br/>
informed and I makes choices that will best suit my family and our<br/>
situation but when the rest of the world goes along it is hard to keep<br/>
the beat of your own drum.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know what my point is. *L*  Gee maybe that is my problem.<br/>
(Or I need some sleep.) I guess I just need to get it off my chest I<br/>
sort of feel like  at times I am going against the grain and wonder how<br/>
my kids will turn out and if I am doing the right thing. I am glad this<br/>
list is here. At least I can read there are really other families out<br/>
there with similar ideas and ways of doing things as we do.<br/>

<br/>
I think most of us feel this way at one time or another.  Have<br/>
confidence in the fact that you are not alone and there are TONS of<br/>
people out there who are like you and who are making many of the same<br/>
choices.  So what if we are not in the majority?  I think it takes great<br/>
courage to go against the grain...most leaders, artists and historical<br/>
figures became who they were because they had the courage to stand alone<br/>
and be unique.  You can feel good about what you are doing for your<br/>
family.  Kids, families, relationships, etc. are not factory issue.  We<br/>
can&#39;t possibly all be the same.  And the more rare something is, usually<br/>
the more valuable it is!<br/>

<br>There are parents who NEVER wonder. &nbsp;They just get up, send their kids to

<br>
<br>And I think that&#39;s sad -- not their fault, but sad. &nbsp;That&#39;s just how they 
<br>were taught and raised.
<br>
<br>I have been having a real itch lately to reach out to all the parents in the 
<br>universe and say &quot;You have choices!&quot;
<br>
<br>Not one practical idea on how to do that or if it should even be done, but it 
<br>does seem like a lot of people are trying to make decisions (like the whole 
<br>education reform/testing/vouchers/etc. plan in the legislative works now) 
<br>without even knowing what all their options might be.
<br>
<br>Let&#39;s see, everyone completely restructure your lives to fix 
<br>education-related problems and everything else.
<br>
<br>There -- that should do it.

It wasn&#39;t until after I&#39;d already decided to try homeschooling and began<br/>
to research it, that I learned that my state doesn&#39;t even require<br/>
children to receive an education until after age 8.  A child who is age 6<br/>
before Sep 1 can enter first grade whether or not that child has attended<br/>
kindergarten.  This certainly isn&#39;t common knowledge!  For that matter, a<br/>
large number of people are led to believe that pre-school is &quot;critical&quot;<br/>
to a child&#39;s education.<br/>
