<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022236478">Something else she might want to consider at some point would be hospital<br/>
social worker.  I think it&#39;s part of their job to help families through<br/>
tough decisions and experiences at the hospital.<br/>
This is my field. It&#39;s a great job with some flexibility to allow me to homeschool and be home more with kids + it&#39;s high drama and so am I. Kelli<br/>
