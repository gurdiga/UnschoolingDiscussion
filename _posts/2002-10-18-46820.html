&gt; The only solution I see, is consequences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When you say consequences, you&#39;re not talking about natural consequences<br/>
(she kicks wall, foot hurts), you&#39;re talking about punishment, so you might<br/>
just call it that.<br/>
<br/>
Several people offered you a variety of other solutions. I&#39;m sorry you&#39;ve<br/>
disregarded and dismissed all of them. This is probably not the right list<br/>
to find out how best to punish your 9 year old.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong about that, but I sure hope not.<br/>
