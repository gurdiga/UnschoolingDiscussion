all boys.  And what exactly are you &quot;admitting&quot; to?  Seems a strange <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m feeling a little quesy about how down you are on BOYS and how slow, <br/>
spazzy, mean, etc. they are concidering that your children are male.  <br/>
Don&#39;t you think that your preconceived expections of their behavior <br/>
and/or capabilities are helping to shape their outcome?  You&#39;re not <br/>
doing right by them. <br/>
<br/>
I encourage you to be their refuge from the outside world -- help them <br/>
feel loved, safe, protected, and worthy.  What sort of men are your sons <br/>
going to become if they know that their Mama thinks they are &quot;less than&quot;?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love boys.  I am not down on them at all, I accept their right to be <br/>
different.  There is nothing wrong with the way my sons are.  Have you read the <br/>
excellent book &quot;The War Against Boys&quot; by Christina Sommers?  The whole point is <br/>
that today the whole society, especially the schools, expects boys to act like <br/>
girls and labels them as hyperactive, LD, etc., when they do not.  One of my <br/>
kids was labelled and the other was at risk of being labelled just because, at <br/>
the age of six, he still couldn&#39;t print neatly!  I took my kids out of school <br/>
and they&#39;ve thrived, precisely because I accept them as they are.  I let them <br/>
be active as much as they need to be instead of relying on a 15 minute <br/>
&quot;recess.&quot;   And they&#39;re doing great.<br/>

I&#39;m being a smartalec because I&#39;ve been down that path.  Life with my husband <br/>
was certainly better balanced than it was after he died.  Not because my kids <br/>
were any different, because *I* was different without my main support person. <br/>
 Yes, I did swat my boy, for lack of other resources and because of the <br/>
pressure of my *smack-o-matic* family members.  They were not around, however, for <br/>
the incredible backlash that occurred when the smack was over and the trust <br/>
was gone.  If Hayden was incorrigible and needed a swat in the first place, his <br/>
behavior *after* the swat needed killin!!!  It was a cycle I could not and <br/>
will not continue.  I&#39;ve busted my hump to earn back the trust of my baby, and I <br/>
doubt it will ever be like it was before.  What *I* have to do, as the adult <br/>
and the only remaining parent, is to decide what is *REALLY* important to <br/>
instill in my children.  The fact that *mom will hit you if the car don&#39;t* is not <br/>
high on my list.  The fact that mom gets freaked out and doesn&#39;t know the right <br/>
thing to do all the time is okay.  The big thing I really really really want <br/>
my kids to know in their hearts is &quot;Mommy is the safest place in the whole <br/>
wide world&quot; ~ they cannot know that, if mommy hits them -period-<br/>
<br/>
(the lack of daddy mentioned here does not mean he (hypothetic) is not <br/>
considered, he is just not present in our life at the moment &lt;beg&gt;)<br/>

You will NOT get agreement from people here. It&#39;s a &quot;spank-free zone&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One smack, no matter how old---or YOUNG---the child, will NOT illicit <br/>
compassion here. Have you not read ANYONES&#39; posts???<br/>

We don&#39;t CARE that you think it&#39;s just fine and dandy. The consensus here is <br/>

I&#39;m really curious as to how, exactly, a spanking potentially saves <br/>

I&#39;ve known plenty of people who insist that they must spank their <br/>
toddlers for going near the street to keep them safe.  I&#39;ve also <br/>
noticed that even with all these &quot;necessary&quot; spankings the same <br/>
people don&#39;t leave their toddlers unattended by the street.  And if <br/>
we are going to be by their sides anyway, why not just gently remove <br/>
them from the road rather than smacking them first?  Why not hold <br/>
their little hands and explore the road together, pointing out when <br/>
a car is coming and moving to safety?    <br/>
I recently moved away from a very busy road which was intersected by <br/>
train tracks a half a block away.   A train rushed by approximately <br/>
every hour around the clock.  We lived there for six years- through <br/>
all three of my sons&#39; toddler years- and not once did I need to <br/>
spank any of them to save their lives.<br/>

the time, to explain why he never wanted anyone to hold his hand, and he has <br/>
since forgotten the whole thing.  He always had a keen need to explore and see <br/>
everything for himself, which is a good trait, I think.  It wasn&#39;t just me <br/>
who had a hard time holding on to him in the street, all of his sitters <br/>
complained about it.  Any kind of harness wouldn&#39;t have worked--we tried, he would <br/>
just fling himself to the ground.  I think perhaps he is the sort of child who <br/>
would have been better off living in the country, but Heaven did not ordain. He <br/>
is now off all stimulants and doing fine, except for the usual problems of <br/>
going through puberty!<br/>

Just wanted to pick out this part and say keep on doing what you are doing.<br/>
You will get that trust back. I don&#39;t think anyone could have screwed up<br/>
more than I did with my Tara. She was spanked a few times, sent to her room<br/>
screaming, given time outs, punished and had many things taken away from<br/>
hern, shamed, bribed, not listened to and spoken to like I can&#39;t even<br/>
believe still now. It took a lot of time, hard work and we had to sort<br/>
through a lot of crap to get to the good stuff. And it took me longer to<br/>
figure out all this than most here. But she&#39;s 17 now and we have a wonderful<br/>
relationship. Very trusting and respectful. She understands I didn&#39;t know<br/>

<br/>
People usually spank for 3 reasons: (1) desperate and overwhelmed and <br/>
don&#39;t have other ideas of what to do, (2) think it is good for the <br/>
child, (3) panic and reflexively spank in a moment of danger or extreme <br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve started a yahoogroup list for people who wish to talk about ways <br/>
to parent that do not involve spanking or other humiliating or shaming <br/>
ways of treating children.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody else is on it yet, except me. I think we can talk about it more <br/>
easily on a list that is specifically intended to support a No Spanking <br/>
decision. I am always available to talk to anybody who wants ideas and <br/>
encouragement for not spanking - just send an email to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NoSpanking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">NoSpanking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> and we&#39;ll talk there.<br/>
