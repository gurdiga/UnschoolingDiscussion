<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315584031">-=-Is it best to just get the drums that are sold specifically to go with the <br/>
set? Do they hook up to the gamecube somehow? Or is it just as much fun to <br/>
have any old kongas for multiple players?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Bongos.  I think the name of the game should have been Bongo Kazooie, because <br/>
it&#39;s really not a conga-drum situation&lt;g&gt;.   The bongos that come with the <br/>
set are game controllers.  They plug in right where the controllers would have, <br/>
and touching the drums are left and right (on menus) and there&#39;s a &quot;start&quot; <br/>
button on front of the drums (in a subtle place so they don&#39;t have the appearance <br/>
of being controllers).   <br/>
<br/>
Extra drums are $30 a set (same price as any controllers).  They&#39;re not <br/>
manufactured by Nintendo, but are made specifically for that game by another <br/>
company.  In two-player mode, the way you hit your drums affects the way your <br/>
&quot;character&quot; hits his.  If I make a mistake, the guy on the screen makes exactly the <br/>
same mistake, and that&#39;s what the score is based on.  So you&#39;re controlling an <br/>
on-screen cartoon drummer, with your drums.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111026661">Thanks!  I did pick up the drum-controller.  I don&#39;t normally spend that much on Christmas gifts for a niece or nephew, but his parents are pretty generous towards our family.  Besides, it just didn&#39;t seem right for him to have the game with only one controller.<br/>
