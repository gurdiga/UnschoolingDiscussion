Don&#39;t sweat it. It&#39;s just one person&#39;s opinion, which could have been <br/>
expressed with a bit more tact. One thing you&#39;ll quickly learn here and on <br/>
other lists, is that there will always be an occasional post which will <br/>
offend you, especially when one has opinions and values based in a religious <br/>
not share by everyone. I see the same thing on lists where every member is <br/>
supposedly of the same religious beliefs. A few words of advice:  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately, it was offensive to Meshell. Different people are offended by <br/>
different things. I am not often receptive to a message, however good it may <br/>
be, when it is expressed in a manner I find offensive. Here&#39;s an example. In <br/>
college, I was constantly harassed by a couple of male friends who would <br/>
literally yell at me whenever I would wear noticeable make-up. They insisted <br/>
I looked much better without it and that I was just buying into someone <br/>
else&#39;s idea of what I should look like, and doing myself a disservice in the <br/>
process. I eventually came to agree with them on several points. However at <br/>
the time I mentally deleted their message because it was communicated in a <br/>
way I found demeaning.<br/>
<br/>
I would not have been offended by that particular post either, but it&#39;s not <br/>
my place to tell someone else what they should find offensive. I don&#39;t delete <br/>
opinions that are simply different from mine. I rather enjoy reading them. <br/>
There is even one particular woman on a list I am on who constantly says <br/>
things offensive to me as a person of color, but she is so unbelievably funny <br/>
I have to read all her posts and take her attitude in stride. Instead of <br/>
starting or participating in a flame war, I often delete things that are <br/>
offensive on a personal level, after I&#39;ve read them, and don&#39;t look back. I <br/>
rarely delete without reading, unless the subject is obviously not of <br/>
interest. I don&#39;t worry that there will be some lone life-changing post out <br/>
there that I&#39;ll miss either.<br/>

No one here said that... it was all stated as their opinion.... <br/>

life changing?  well, that certainly wasn&#39;t said either... but it does <br/>
actually remind me that we are here to fill in each other&#39;s blanks in my <br/>
opinion... that&#39;s what touching each other is all about... be it information <br/>
or whatever... we are all interconnected... even on the internet... when we <br/>
&quot;write off&quot; others, or delete them, we are eliminating a possible chance to <br/>
fill in one of their blanks or to have one of ours filled in... in my <br/>
opinion....<br/>
