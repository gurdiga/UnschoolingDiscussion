<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377383227">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure any of you remember me. I posted quite a bit in Jan and <br/>
Feb. Took a long hiatus when I had an Internet crisis. Since then, <br/>
I&#39;ve been the &quot;soccer&quot; mom times three with multiple kids in <br/>
sports and activities. We&#39;ve been unschooling in earnest since <br/>
January. And it&#39;s taken all my focus to make this transition from<br/>
a more traditional homeschooling approach. I check in here <br/>
mostly just reading when I find myself needing a pep talk.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve taken the last several weeks to read up on NCP and TCS. I <br/>
noticed on this list that it came up here briefly for discussion. <br/>
What is it about NCP that makes several of you say: &quot;Oh that is <br/>
definitely not what this list is about&quot;? What is different about how <br/>
most of you unschoolers parent and how NCP comes across?<br/>
<br/>
The tone of our home has improved dramatically since January <br/>
in most areas. I&#39;ve seen our kids develop sibling harmony that <br/>
takes almost no help from me! That&#39;s been awesome. And they <br/>
seem to enjoy having more autonomy and control over their lives.<br/>
<br/>
But recently in a family conversation, there were a couple of <br/>
comments that I wanted to chew on.<br/>
<br/>
One of our kids is not liking the loss of the homeschool lifestyle <br/>
that we used to have. He liked the predictability of the routine, the <br/>
fact that all the kids were on the same schedule and that the <br/>
family had a united course of study. He&#39;s come to tears several <br/>
times over this and wishes we were back to the way we were. He <br/>
likes a measurable goal that he can tick off. But when I <br/>
suggested returning to a course of study for him, he resists <br/>
since he&#39;s not sure it will feel &quot;real&quot; if he&#39;s the only one doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Another one worried that she only cared about her friendships <br/>
and was disappointed in herself to find that she isn&#39;t getting <br/>
hooked on any &quot;interests.&quot; She thought that with the freedom to <br/>
explore anything she wanted to, she&#39;d find something that <br/>
hooked her. I&#39;m wondering if she is still judging her interests (as <br/>
though studying mythology--which she has loved in the past--is <br/>
somehow more worthy of her time and attention than her <br/>
friendships online and in person). After all, she has eight <br/>
international pen pals that she writes to all month, she&#39;s <br/>
completed a novella, has read three to five novels a week for <br/>
months, is redecorating her room using books on feng shui to <br/>
help her, and is studying Latin because &quot;she wants to.&quot; I&#39;m not <br/>
worried about her at all. But she&#39;s worried about herself.<br/>
<br/>
The other three are doing really well with this new freedom. I do <br/>
notice that the X Box is interminably interesting to two of my boys. <br/>
They literally can do it all day every day. But they both are happy <br/>
and the younger of the two surprises me almost daily with the <br/>
ways he&#39;s learning math without any books at all. My youngest <br/>
(6) is suddenly having reading breakthroughs and we&#39;ve done <br/>
nothing to teach her since Jan.<br/>
<br/>
I was interested in NCP because I have noticed that resentment <br/>
created in children is the biggest barrier to an open, close <br/>
relationship. It&#39;s this openness and closeness I want to preserve <br/>
and foster. Are there dangers inherent in NCP that I ought to <br/>
know about? As I face all the decisions that involve my teens, I <br/>
am even more concerned that I understand how to support and <br/>
cheerlead them rather than harnessing, nagging and controlling <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading this post after so much time since my last <br/>
one. You ladies are inspiring! Our lives have changed since Jan <br/>
for the better and I have you all to thank.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is just about not doing school.<br/>
<br/>
But I agree. I think it&#39;s easier to grasp unschooling if we extend the<br/>
philosophy into life. But that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a requirement.<br/>
<br/>
I think what&#39;s even harder to grasp is that many TCSers send their kids to<br/>
school.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe try to help him separate the aspects of what he enjoys from how he<br/>
wants to get it. Obviously it wouldn&#39;t be fair for the whole family to stop<br/>
doing what they&#39;re enjoying and go back to what they were doing before so<br/>
that he can get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps what he likes is the predictability of the day and the clear goals<br/>
to reach. It&#39;s very satisfying knowing there&#39;s a goal to reach and a time<br/>
limit and then accomplishing that.<br/>
<br/>
*But* he hasn&#39;t had the experience of setting his own goals and reaching<br/>
them. It&#39;s going to feel initially unsatisfying knowing that he doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to reach a goal. That he can drop it at any time. That he can set the bar so<br/>
low that he could reach it with his eyes closed.<br/>
<br/>
And he&#39;s probably going to think in terms of school-like goals: completing a<br/>
chapter by the end of the week, answering all the questions at the end of<br/>
the chapter. Those are all arbitrary goals so they&#39;ve needed someone to<br/>
assign them and enforce them in the past in order to make them &quot;real&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So what he needs are real goals for real personally meaningful reasons. He&#39;s<br/>
stuck, a lot like kids who have been working to acheive As and Bs. If the As<br/>
and Bs are taken away, then what&#39;s the purpose of working they wonder?<br/>
<br/>
So maybe talk to him about personal goals. He *does* need time to deschool<br/>
so he can come to value personal goals more than artificial arbitrary ones.<br/>
The summer should help. So maybe talk to him about summer-type things he&#39;d<br/>
like to accomplish like learning to swim better or a family bike trip to the<br/>
top of a local mountain or finding a great book series or watching all the<br/>
James Bond movies in chronological order.<br/>
<br/>
And as for predictable days, perhaps you could write the days schedule down<br/>
for him so he knows what&#39;s happening that day. (Be sure to schedule in<br/>
&quot;recess&quot; so that you have the freedom to do something that isn&#39;t scheduled<br/>
;-)<br/>

&gt; hooked on any &quot;interests.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is again about deschooling. Kids get convinced that school is the only<br/>
way to learn just as fully as adults do. We assume that kids will embrace<br/>
freedom as soon as they&#39;re given it, but they get brainwashed by the system<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
It would help to acknowledge her feelings. You&#39;ve changed the rules on her<br/>
and she was attached to the old rules. Maybe share that you&#39;re sorry that<br/>
you didn&#39;t find unschooling earlier because it isn&#39;t fair that she has to<br/>
learn to *re*value her interests. She should have been naturally valuing<br/>
them all along.<br/>
<br/>
And talk about how it&#39;s natural for teens to value friendships. It&#39;s part of<br/>
the process of being a teen and the journey to adulthood. She needs that<br/>
part of the journey.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it would help if she wrote down what she&#39;s doing so she can see all<br/>
the things she *is* accomplishing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Taking Children Seriously (TCS) is the parenting philosophy of Sarah<br/>
Lawrence. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.TCS.ac/)">http://www.TCS.ac/)</a><br/>
<br/>
Non-Coercive Parenting (NCP) is the method they use.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the difference between NCP and mindful parenting is that NCP is the<br/>
TCSers technique to become mindful parents. It&#39;s very specifically focused<br/>
on not coercing children and becoming great problem solvers to avoid using<br/>
coercion as a parenting tool.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas the focus of mindful parenting is on seeing children as fellow human<br/>
beings and helping them be who they are.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with NCP -- at least talking about it here outside the<br/>
atmosphere of TCS -- is that it&#39;s about how to implement a rule -- don&#39;t<br/>
coerce -- and not about a philosophy of how to respect children as fellow<br/>
human beings.<br/>
<br/>
Mindful parents generally won&#39;t coerce because it isn&#39;t how we&#39;d want others<br/>
to treat us, not because someone decided coercion was damaging.<br/>
<br/>
In practice they would probably look the same outwardly so the difference is<br/>
more internal and in how we talk about it to help people understand.<br/>

Maybe if you share a list of Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences with her, she <br/>
might see herself in the interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences, and <br/>
if so, you can talk to her about what those are good for &quot;in the real world&quot; <br/>
(paid-job world that she might be worrying about)--counselling, management, <br/>
public relations, personnel matters, meeting-and-greeting kinds of jobs with <br/>
airlines, restaurants, hotels, conventions...   Then just being interested in <br/>
friends might seem the gateway to a large chunk of adult interests and <br/>
pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;After all, she has eight <br/>
<br/>
international pen pals that she writes to all month, she&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
completed a novella, has read three to five novels a week for <br/>
<br/>
months, is redecorating her room using books on feng shui to <br/>
<br/>
help her, and is studying Latin because &quot;she wants to.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>

OH gosh.  Add international relations and professional advisor on protocol to <br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; I think what&#39;s even harder to grasp is that many TCSers send their kids <br/>
to<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;That one floors me.  What do they do if/when the child doesn&#39;t want to go? <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey ask them!!!<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t tell you.<br/>
<br/>
My main difference/irritation with the core of that &quot;group&quot; (I&#39;ve only seen <br/>
writings from two people, honestly, or two women and one woman&#39;s husband, so <br/>
two families represented) is that they refuse to tell stories about their own <br/>
families and actual experiences.  It&#39;s all theoretical and philosophical, and <br/>
it has been stated (elswhere, elsetime past) that the unschooling discussions <br/>
were disrepectful of our children because we told stories about them.<br/>
<br/>
My model and source-place for this is La Leche League.  In La Leche League we <br/>
talked about our real babies and our real experiences.  It wouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
worth a damn otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
They won&#39;t even tell how old their kids are.  It&#39;s private information.<br/>
<br/>
When one of the moms was active on the elsewhere homeschooling discussions, <br/>
she was often a wrench in the gears, by calling compromise coercion, and by <br/>
calling persuasion coercion.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some unschoolers who reall did like the philosophy and have <br/>
adopted lots of the principles in their homes, but the discussions pretty <br/>
much HAVE to be separate, since we talk about kids and they won&#39;t.<br/>
