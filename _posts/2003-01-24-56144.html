&lt;&lt; Was NCP a popular term among TCSers at one time but isn&#39;t any more? And is<br/>
the term now living on as an artifact of the discussions with Janet? I&#39;m not<br/>

<br/>
At the moment, Joyce, you seem to know more about that than anyone else in <br/>
the world!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad to have been able to meet Kathy Ward and Cheryl Seelhoff both <br/>
in person.  Both have BIG families, both are gentle, quiet kinds of moms, and <br/>
both have websites!<br/>
<br/>
Cheryl&#39;s you gave but I&#39;ll repost what you put<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;A bunch of us here, and I&#39;m assuming Kathy and Cheryl,<br/>
heard the term from Janet and Bob Reiland who debated TCS a lot on the old<br/>
AOL Homeschooling board.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where I learned all that, and what didn&#39;t set well with me was that <br/>
they refused on principle to tell real stories of their real children, or <br/>
even to tell how many children they had or how old they were.  But they were <br/>
glad to tell us how coercive we were and how disrespectful of our children we <br/>
were to tell stories about them.  So I was baffled at why they were there.  <br/>
Missionary work, I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
It seemed too narrowly focussed for me, and later I read a speech that Sarah <br/>
Lawrence had given, and it seemed to be ALL about libertarianism.  That made <br/>
me even less interested.<br/>

<br/>
About not using real evidence:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Many of the general points I make are generalised versions of things that I <br/>
have experienced, but that is really neither here nor there, for I want my <br/>
arguments and ideas to be judged on their own merit and not because I claim <br/>
any spurious authority of experience to justify them. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hi, Joyce --<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that&#39;s where I know the term from, and I think I&#39;m the one that<br/>
just dropped the jargon into the conversation here.<br/>
