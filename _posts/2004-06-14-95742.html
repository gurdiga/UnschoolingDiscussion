<div id="ygrps-yiv-276074589">I am not sure how much Greek Mythology this interactive, <br/>
biofeedback &quot;game&quot; incorporates but it sounds and looks incredible. I <br/>
heard about it last week at the Rethinking Education conference in <br/>
Texas. They have a sample of the graphics and game on their web site: <br/>
WildDivine.com. (sorry, I don&#39;t know how to post the site here <br/>
properly) It was reported to be enjoyed by both adults and a 4 year <br/>
old. We just ordered one for our family.</div>
