<div id="ygrps-yiv-2002420931">Hi everyone:<br/>
<br/>
I like to hear from people who have their own business at home and unschool.  <br/>
How does that work for you.  The logistics?  My husband works outside the <br/>
home and I have my own business which I work around the kids.  However, <br/>
anyone who has a business knows, the phone rings when it wants to and people <br/>
want to talk to me when they want to.  Do you schedule everything at night?  <br/>
Do you work when the other is home and available for the kids?  Do you work <br/>
only weekends?   Does it only work if you both work out of the home?  Do you <br/>
involve the kids in the business?  I&#39;ve been thinking that these are also <br/>
some concerns I have about how to balance both and not to hurt either.<br/>
