<div id="ygrps-yiv-544544472">The shouting down of an individual with a few supporters will not keep me <br/>
from helping unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I have never &quot;self-proclaimed&quot; myself anything except available and willing <br/>
to help unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Out of support for HEM and unschooling.com, I am on this list instead of <br/>
starting my own.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the problem, I believe, is that a few people have equated me and <br/>
Lynda in their summaries or reviews or peace-making here over the past few <br/>
months which emboldened Lynda to treat me extremely badly.  What benefit <br/>
there is to her or any of the Arab world, I can&#39;t imagine except that perhaps <br/>
it is the joy of troublemaking, which I have proposed before.  I can&#39;t prove <br/>
that nor should I have to try.  It speaks for itself.  <br/>
<br/>
A few months back I asked Lynda where she lived and how old her kids were, <br/>
and the response was a tirade without that information.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago I answered personal questions directly and honestly, and two <br/>
of those answers have already been turned to personal insult by Lynda (the <br/>
English degree comment and the journalistic tendencies comment).<br/>
<br/>
There are other insults I could answer directly and misconceptions <br/>
(purposeful or not) I could refute, but I much prefer to get back to topic.<br/>
<br/>
How many dogs bite, how many psychiatrists don&#39;t care about family dynamics, <br/>
how many hundreds of years the opinion of gun owners in northern California <br/>
has been known to Lynda and how to dry pears are all entirely side issues.<br/>
<br/>
Side issues are fine.  To me, truth is very important, and documentation for <br/>
statements is important.  But I come to this list to discuss unschooling, and <br/>
I will continue to do so.<br/>
<br/>
I hope any of those on the list who are tempted to dismiss problems with a <br/>
simple yet false comparison of me and Lynda will either stick around a while <br/>
and see whether unschooling is being discussed, or will check the archives of <br/>
this list to see whether we are equal in our focus on unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Sandra, I think you have a tremendous position to offer wisdom and insight. <br/>
You are into the wise and confident phase of life and yet you still have <br/>
fairly young children. So while I feel the age/wisdom from you, I can also <br/>
relate in a not too distant way to you because your children aren&#39;t grown and <br/>
married. I think you offer direct truth, which can be very painful when we <br/>
are too far from truth. And with my own tv debate, I got upset by your direct <br/>
point-blank manner, because it hurt. But it only hurt because it was true. <br/>
But then I had to ask myself, would I rather someone spare my feelings and <br/>
let me go in the wrong direction or speak truth that may hurt me but <br/>
ultimately help me and my son. I&#39;d much rather someone tell me. Otherwise, me <br/>
and my untruths have just been dismissed, disregarded, unchanged.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ll stick up for ya too. I haven&#39;t followed all the debates and <br/>
bickering, but I&#39;m very grateful that you&#39;re on here. I would certainly hope <br/>
that no one would verbally attack me for admiring someone&#39;s wisdom and <br/>
wishing to learn from them.<br/>

I never read those words on one of Sandra&#39;s posts, maybe I missed it but I <br/>
doubt it.  my opinion is that she was trying to tell you what she saw as the <br/>
truth of what you were saying.  I really doubt that her purpose was to hurt <br/>
you or insult you or your family. I believe she was trying to share a truth <br/>
with you that she thought could help you. If you don&#39;t agree with her, I <br/>
would say dismiss the whole thing and we can all stop bickering and insulting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452277357">For what it&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
I started homeschooling my now 11 year old daughter almost a year ago.<br/>
On day one, my daughter made a public school schedule for us to keep<br/>
with recesses and lunch break complete.  We didn&#39;t last one day at that,<br/>
thank goodness.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t take long for me to discover deschooling and unschooling.<br/>
Sandra and unschooling.com played a large roll in my discovery and our<br/>
process and I&#39;ve been a very grateful (mostly quiet) member on this list<br/>
since then.<br/>
<br/>
Initially, I was struck by what I perceived as Sandra&#39;s bluntness but,<br/>
being who I am, I liked it.  A lot.  Many, many of her postings have<br/>
really helped me and my family.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, I saw her speak at the HSC conference.  I was surprised to<br/>
hear how funny she is.  Delightful!  If you&#39;ve been on the net for any<br/>
time at all, I think you&#39;ve probably figured out that you really can&#39;t<br/>
put an accurate &quot;tone of voice&quot; on someone&#39;s postings a lot of the time,<br/>
even with all the little emoticons we have developed.  Sometimes, you<br/>
just read it wrong; it&#39;s so easy to misinterpret the feeling with which<br/>
the words are written.  After some painful mistakes, I try not to assume<br/>
that anyone is feeling what I think they are as I read their words.<br/>
<br/>
As school started up again this year and my daughter expressed some<br/>
desire to go to middle school, I felt desperate to find a way to get her<br/>
to agree to give homeschooling more of a chance.  I turned again to<br/>
Sandra&#39;s words and unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
I found Sandra&#39;s article with the suggestion of paying her half (or all)<br/>
of what we&#39;d spend  if we sent her to public school.  We didn&#39;t end up<br/>
needing to do that but I take great comfort in having that idea as my<br/>
last resort.  Again, she has agreed (with occasional mixed feelings --<br/>
all of which we are trying to address) that she wants to homeschool.  At<br/>
this age, at this time, in this town, I&#39;m willing to go to great lengths<br/>
to have her agree to homeschool.  (I don&#39;t think I&#39;m willing to force<br/>
homeschooling, to actually prohibit public school if she makes up her<br/>
mind but we haven&#39;t yet gotten to that point.)  Later on, we shall see.<br/>
<br/>
This has not been an easy year for us.  I&#39;ve had to look at myself and<br/>
my behavior a lot.  I needed to challenge many of my assumptions and<br/>
beliefs and many of them have had to change.  Sandra, more than anyone<br/>
else, has helped me in that uncomfortable process.<br/>
<br/>
I owe Sandra an enormous debt of gratitude.  I&#39;ve never talked to the<br/>
woman and she doesn&#39;t have a clue who I am.  So I say now:  Thank You.<br/>
I certainly wouldn&#39;t have gotten here without you.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She did say that.   &quot;Social vandal&quot; was her exact turn of phrase.  The<br/>
part of not knowing my own family was said in many ways and many places. <br/>
I did some cut and paste below to support those statements.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my thoughts regarding this issue at this point.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired of discussing my family as I am sure many others are tired of<br/>
hearing about us.  At this point I am more concerned with getting the<br/>
point across that what you all say this list is about and what happened<br/>
to me when I joined are two completely different things.  I really and<br/>
truly wonder how many others are listening but afraid to post because<br/>
they don&#39;t want to incur the wrath of Sandra - I know of one personally<br/>
and suspect that a couple of others are here but don&#39;t post for that<br/>
reason.  I also wonder how many have left without the help and advice<br/>
they need because their first post was jumped on by the more radical<br/>
fringe here as mine was and the person just up and left without waiting<br/>
to see if the whole list was like that.<br/>
<br/>
And no, I am not saying that Sandra is not here trying to help people. <br/>
I&#39;m sure she was not thinking how can I insult this person to the<br/>
fullest.  But, I think she could take a little of her own advice and look<br/>
with-in a little too.  None of us is ever &#39;finished&#39;.  I look inside<br/>
daily.  I also go back through the words I&#39;ve written in a thread if a<br/>
dispute arises or if someone questions my motivations.  I&#39;ve done both<br/>
with regard to this conversation and I am still fairly certain that I<br/>
know my family better than Sandra does.<br/>
<br/>
Bridget<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Here is what Sandra said in message #25431 if you follow the thread you<br/>
can clearly see (not just speculate) she is talking about me:  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think part of what&#39;s dishonest is that someone has come onto this <br/>
 </span></blockquote>list <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; without good intent.  I&#39;ve been told that some of these who are so <br/>
 </span></blockquote>vehemently <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; defending questionable stuff are on another list together, so I  wonder<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have been asking, in various ways) how much of the recent noise has <br/>
 </span></blockquote>been for <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the sake of disruption.  A kind of social vandalism.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She also said:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The arguments in your paragraph above are like those used by abusive<br/>
 </span></blockquote>spouses. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&quot;You had a choice.  You could have made a better dinner, and I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;thrown the casserole in the yard.&quot;  (To use an example of the father of <br/>
&gt;someone I know.)  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Implying that those who don&#39;t follow her &quot;total unschooling way of life&quot;<br/>
are abusive.  I know she didn&#39;t actually come right out and say that we<br/>
are abusive, but I think the tone is there.<br/>
<br/>
And then she said during a discussion with Lynda about me: #25356<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Just because there&#39;s a difference doesn&#39;t mean everytime a mom wants to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>say <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;my kid is an addict and so...&quot; that she&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course there was that beauty by you accusing me of not knowing<br/>
myself:#25181<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And while I&#39;ve gotten too irked to read many of her messages, I <br/>
&gt; understand where Bridgett is coming from. It&#39;s (hopefully) the last<br/>
 </span></blockquote>great <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stance. For me it&#39;s sort of like peeling layers, and frightfully<br/>
 </span></blockquote>hanging onto <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that last one...afraid of what&#39;s *really* underneath.<br/>
<br/>

This might be true. I&#39;ve started 3 posts, spent 1/2<br/>
hour wording and re-wording them only to cancel<br/>
everything. I&#39;m also extremely busy these last days.<br/>
Last night I deleted 500+ emails from this list from<br/>
last week because I&#39;ll never get through them. That<br/>
ment I missed a lot of the conversation and felt not<br/>
truly qualified to chime in with my opinion.<br/>

been to hers. So I&#39;m hoping she wasn&#39;t hurt because I<br/>
didn&#39;t defend her. Like I said I&#39;ve missed most of the<br/>
messages. And I&#39;ve never known Sandra to need someone<br/>
else to defend her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I started popping into the homeschooling chat rooms on<br/>
AOL a few years before we started homeschooling. Boy<br/>
was Sandra pinpoint accurate. She challenged my<br/>
beliefs on every turn. Sometimes reading what she<br/>
wrote in answer to another newbie homeschooler was<br/>
just what I needed to hear also. I never took her<br/>
words as harsh or blunt. To me she has always spoken<br/>
in a very wise voice. A voice I immediately respected.<br/>
But I was willing to learn from others. I&#39;ve only been<br/>
on this list for a few months and reading the<br/>
unschooling.com message boards again for the last 4-5<br/>
months. I had quit reading for more than a year. I<br/>
noticed as soon as I again started reading<br/>
unschooling.com how relaxed I became. I get really<br/>
weirded out and controling when I don&#39;t read for a few<br/>
months. <br/>
Without you Sandra I would never have felt comfortable<br/>
enough to make the leap to homeschooling and then<br/>
unschooling. Thank You.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen this on other unschooling boards.<br/>
The &quot;brave&quot; people sticking up for all the fearful ones.  <br/>
Well, in my opinion, if you are going to unschool, you better get <br/>
brave.  You better question your ideas, and throw them out &quot;to the <br/>
wolves&quot; and see how they come back.<br/>
If someone needs to take a while to get a grasp of what it&#39;s all <br/>
about, then they should hold back on posting and mostly read.  When <br/>
they do decide to throw out something, they better be prepared to <br/>
have it analyzed from every angle.  It would be helpful to realize <br/>
upfront, that people are going to question them and try to get more <br/>
information, while giving opinions about situations that MIGHT be <br/>
true.  It&#39;s all part of this way of communicating.  Clarify if <br/>
someone has misinterpreted.  Questioning yourself, and coming back <br/>
with ideas that have come from that.  Questioning others and being <br/>
open minded about thier ideas, and striving towards the place that is <br/>
right for you.<br/>
When it all turns personal and defensive, all the good that can come <br/>
from these types of discussions, is limited. <br/>
