&lt;&lt;  As our oldest became more aware, he realized that Daddy had a <br/>
Birthday plus another special day and that didn&#39;t sit well with him. So we <br/>
celebrate their half Birthday now. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly cares about her half birthday because her birthday is too close to <br/>
Christmas for her (November 2--but still...)  and Marty&#39;s is January 14, so <br/>
maybe I should either make a bigger deal about half birthdays or let each one <br/>
of them pick a special day.  This is sounding really good to me, this <br/>
two-day-a-year special.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll make certificates and give them that for Christmas--that they can <br/>
pick a day.  (Maybe I should give them next year&#39;s calendar, though, with my <br/>
homeschooling conferences blocked out.  I love homeschooling conferences.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We have a lot of those in our family.  My granddaughter is December 21.  I <br/>
have a nephew born on Christmas day, another on New Years, and a <br/>
grand-nephew on Christmas Eve.  My dh and all his brothers were born on <br/>
moveable holidays, Good Friday, Labour Day, and Victoria Day.  When Lars <br/>
was due on October 30, I figured he&#39;d arrive either on Halloween or <br/>
Canadian Thanksgiving, but he didn&#39;t.  He *was* nice enough to arrive 2 <br/>
weeks before his due date, though.<br/>
