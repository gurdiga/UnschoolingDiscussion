<div id="ygrps-yiv-970417315">I must admitt that I started this television debate :) Can&#39;t believe <br/>
how long it has gone on.  I hope nobody has felt attacked or have <br/>
hurt feelings over any of this.  Tolerance, tolerance, tolerance. It <br/>
is something I struggle with.  <br/>
<br/>
When I decided to unschool I didn&#39;t jump right in and let my kids <br/>
lead. I think for some of us, the ability to unschool comes in time.  <br/>
It takes time to dismiss our old ways of thinking and doing.<br/>
<br/>
I know that some of you may not agree witht he way I unschool. I <br/>
don&#39;t *teach* the basic subjects like Math, Science, History and so <br/>
forth.  I do however spend a few minutes about two or three days a <br/>
week working with my daughter out of a Spanish workbook.  She enjoys <br/>
it.  If she hated it I would stop.  Just recently I have decided to <br/>
try a few new things to occupy our minds during these long winter <br/>
months.  A hero a week, where I search out someone who I feel would <br/>
interest my daughter.  We learn a little about that person.  Also, I <br/>
am going to try creating a penpal relationship between my daughter <br/>
and another relative.  She loves recieving mail.  <br/>
<br/>
Although my daughter did not inntiate these things, I have taken her <br/>
interests in to account and am going to be introducing these ideas to <br/>
her and see how it goes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About television.  I often feel that my children watch television <br/>
when they are bored.  Winter has been hard because we can&#39;t spend any <br/>
time outdoors and we live in a small town where there is little to do <br/>
in our community.  When my son our daughter ask to watch television I <br/>
try to come up with something fun for us to do together.  Dance, <br/>
color, make cookies, read, etc.  They don&#39;t want to watch television <br/>
as much when we have fun things to do.  I do however let them watch <br/>
television after we have done a few fun things together.  I can&#39;t <br/>
entertain them all day long.  Sometimes thier eyes are glued to the <br/>
television (usually when they are tired), but most of the time they <br/>
move around, talk, ask questions, sing and so forth.  We avoid <br/>
channels that aren&#39;t kid friendly.  <br/>
<br/>

Can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to?  I ask because we live in Maine and although it&#39;s<br/>
often very cold (lately in the teens and low twenties but tomorrow is<br/>
forecasted to be a high of 7 with wind chill -10 to -20) but we choose to<br/>
spend time outdoors each day.  This year we have a horse and so we have a<br/>
great reason to be out in the cold.  We spend at least 2 hours a day outside<br/>
and often as much as 4 or 5.  Before we had the horse we went outside to<br/>
snow show, ski, sled, or just shovel the driveway.  It&#39;s always been<br/>
important for me to spend some time outside each day.  I feel better when<br/>
I&#39;ve had the change to get outside, even if only for 30 minutes.  Just<br/>
because you live in a cold climate doesn&#39;t mean that you can&#39;t go outside.  <br/>

Why don&#39;t you just let them watch TV, and recommend the fun things to do at  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Heather,<br/>
<br/>
This list tends to give hard-core advice about &quot;radical&quot; unschooling. If you<br/>
post something that gives people ideas for suggesting how it could be done<br/>
closer to radical unschooling, that is most likely what will happen. It is<br/>
not personal to you, though it can feel that way if you are the original<br/>
poster. I don&#39;t keep people and posts straight, and I imagine that most<br/>
people on this list don&#39;t either, so tomorrow I will not remember who said<br/>
what on the list. But I will remember the ideas. If it works for you, try<br/>
reading people&#39;s responses and sit on them for a while. They are meant only<br/>
to bring the thread closer to radical unschooling. I have learned so much by<br/>
doing this. I have had my moments of feeling attacked! But I am VERY<br/>
thankful to the people who challenged my thinking and gave me food for<br/>
thought. Even though it wasn&#39;t pleasant, it made positive change in our<br/>
home.<br/>

We&#39;re trying to talk about unschooling here.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My daughter is 5 and hates the cold.  My son is 20 months and won&#39;t <br/>
<br/>
wear mittens.  I choose not to take them out because they don&#39;t like <br/>
<br/>
it when I do.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Well this is important information.  Your daughter would only have been <br/>
schoolage this year, and you have a baby.  It is hard to get out with kids that <br/>
little.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also hard to speak with much experience and authority about unschooling, <br/>
or the value of reading in the life of a child who has learned to read on her <br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-so, If the only reason they are watching television is because thier <br/>
<br/>
bored, why not get out some pots and pans and make music with them.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Because if they want to bang on pots and pans they might ask to do that.  <br/>
And banging on pots and pans isn&#39;t NEARLY as musical as any TV show with <br/>
music.  <br/>
And if you see high value in banging on a pot, take a pan and a spoon in <br/>
there and let them bang along with the music.  Get some good videos of musicians <br/>
performing.  Raffi in Concert is one my kids liked a lot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; When I read, my eyes are glued to the book.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Right now, my eyes are glued to the screen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Your point is?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
That you said it as though having eyes glued to something one was interested <br/>
in was a bad thing.  If he&#39;s totally engaged with a television program, but <br/>
you refer to it as &quot;eyes glued,&quot; you&#39;re showing a disdainfully judgmental <br/>
attitude toward a sincere interest of his.  This doesn&#39;t lead to partnership, but to <br/>
antagonism.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We as a family have talked about what is okay to watch and what isn&#39;t <br/>

<br/>
A 20 month old has discussed this?<br/>
If a five year old agrees with a mother on &quot;what is okay to watch,&quot; I&#39;m <br/>
guessing she just agreed figuring that was her only option.    None of my kids have <br/>
ever watched a show they didn&#39;t want to watch, but they don&#39;t have to say <br/>
&quot;turn the channel,&quot; they can get up and walk away and do something else, or if <br/>
one is the only one there, they can push &quot;off&quot; and do something else.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Well then based on your judgement our school outside of public school <br/>
<br/>
would be better defined as semi-unschooling. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you have ANY &quot;school outside of&quot; anything else, you have school at home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Semi unschooling&quot; is not unschooling that will last.  It&#39;s a toe in the <br/>
water.  Toe in the water isn&#39;t being in the water.<br/>

They don&#39;t serve me in any area of my life. EVERYTHING is a choice, just a choice, not &quot;right&quot; choices and &quot;wrong&quot; choices. Little Johnny hit his brother &quot;BAD&quot; choice....Little Suzie said please &quot;GOOD&quot; choice...ugh. Your daughter is probably doing what she thinks you want her to. I don&#39;t see how that helps her gain the autonomy to figure out what she chooses for *herself*. Just my thoughts, not an attack.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401899621">Heather, <br/>
As I read your first post of today, my first thought was &quot;she doesn&#39;t quite get unschooling yet&quot;.  I don&#39;t mean this to be a slam against you -- many of us were in that place at one time.  I know I was.  As I read more of your words, I totally saw myself from about 15 months ago.  I also felt I was doing a great job in having child-led learning -- and while I wasn&#39;t doing a bad job, I was still a ways off in truly understanding what unschooling is.  I thought I knew...but I didn&#39;t know.  I joined an unschooling discussion list (not this one) and found myself argumentative with the members.  I was determined to stand tall against the members who disagreed with me that we were not really unschooling -- I wanted them to see that not every unschooling family had to be the way they shared.  I became very frustrated and even angry when members would point out that my views didn&#39;t seem to &quot;fit&quot; with their definitions.  I said almost every single thing you said in your posts.  Within a short<br/>
 time, I unsubscribed, never thinking that I would join again.<br/>
 <br/>
I continued on, and eventually, I REALLY got unschooling.  I really, really wanted to learn more about this way of life, so I gradually embraced much of ideas about unschooling.  I continued to read at unschooling.com on a regular basis.  I checked out the Unschooling Handbook from the library.  I would read unschooling articles on various websites.  In my case, I did see it -- finally.  I imagine there are others who get upset on unschooling lists who never do &quot;get unschooling&quot;, but I imagine that they never really wanted to understand it.  I did.  And after I left the list, I would often think back to things that Sandra Dodd and others wrote.  I never thought that those things I disagreed with, would be something I would feel so strongly about that I now even write this response to you!  <br/>
 <br/>
Today, I am a member of that same list I left many months ago.  I rejoined...a little apprehensive at first because I left so frustrated with those there!  But I rejoined and, as the list guidelines say, I read for 2 weeks before writing in.  During the two weeks, I realized that WOW! I honestly agree with the things that are posted here!<br/>
 <br/>
This is not to say that I agree with absolutely everything posted on this list or any of the other unschooling lists -- we all have our differences, but when it comes to truly unschooling, you will find that many of us have a lot in common.  <br/>
 <br/>
I hope you don&#39;t take my post as an attack -- and I do realize that you may be (probably are) very different than me.  I just wanted to share my story, since much of what you write sounded like me months ago.  If you wish to continue to learn about unschooling, I hope you will continue here -- keep reading the posts -- and find even more places online to learn about unschooling.  <br/>

Heather, you&#39;re not being attacked.  You took what Jules said about  strewing <br/>
totally opposite of what was meant.  Strewing is an important part  of <br/>
unschooling.  I think Jules&#39; comment was meant to be encouraging.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s been a day since these posts were written, so I hope you&#39;ve had a good  <br/>
night&#39;s sleep and can see them in a new light.  Your posts have been  <br/>
defensive, and I understand why, but it might be best if you just read and  didn&#39;t <br/>
post for a day or two; and go to the archives and read the posts  again.  You <br/>
might get a new perspective that way.<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re really in a good position to learn about unschooling.  You have  small <br/>
children, which means you can spend time learning about unschooling before  <br/>
there&#39;s any pressure to put them in school.  I&#39;d encourage you, though, to  <br/>
stop thinking of your home as a &quot;school&quot;.  It wasn&#39;t a school when your  little <br/>
girl was born, and it doesn&#39;t become one when she turns school age.   It should <br/>
just be home, with all the peaceful, loving learning that has been  going on <br/>
since there have been kids there.  Keep that going.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979743867">I need some help, if you don&#39;t mind. A little background on me....I have 5 kids (7,5,3,23 months and almost 3 months). When my oldest was around 3 I found a local community of Waldorf homeschoolers and I thought I&#39;d found the non-mainstream life I was looking for. All I knew at the time was I didn&#39;t like much of the way I was raised and was looking for something different. So, I spent 3 yrs living that lifestyle and then when my oldest was about 6 I started to realize that many of the choices I was making was just because they were &quot;Waldorfy&quot; choices and was not really being led by my kids or myself. So, I started to soul search and came across unschooling and non coersive parenting, and started my deschooling process. I&#39;ve read this, and other lists, for about a year now and our family has made pretty drastic changes with wonderful results.<br/>
 <br/>
Now, my friends are beginning to ask me about these choices and we have a thread going on our local moms list about letting go of control and food issues came up. When I mom said that sugar is to kids what drugs are to teens I had to respond and posted a thought out response  with links to Sandra&#39;s website as well as some email from Pam and Sandra (with their permission). I got fairly blasted and I could use some help articulating into words some of these concepts. I work from a feeling level and, being fairly new to living like this myself, feel like I could use some back up before I write my response. So, here&#39;s some of what I got back..<br/>
     *******************************************************************************<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;While I am completely in support of children&#39;s choices & freedoms, I also think their are limits to those acceptable choices. I have come to the conclusion that this is based on what is right for each family based on beliefs, habits, etc. What works for me wouldnt work for a parent who eats sweets or watches tv, they could not take those choices away from their children (they could, but it wouldnt work very well).  For me, sugar is completely unnecesary on a day to day basis & I believe it to be quite harmful. I think it plays a major role in our modern epidemic of chronic illness. I therefore, refuse to spend our hard earned money on something like that (except on occasions). However, they still get a great deal of choices. If they want yogurt (plain of course!) for lunch instead of the meal, ok. If they choose to eat at 2 instead of 12, so be it. They frequently peruse the garden while outside and feast on so much veggies & herbs that they do not eat the snacks I prepare for<br/>
 </span></blockquote> them. Great.  When they want a beverage, they choose from various fermented, yummy beverages I make - kombucha, water kefir, milk kefir, ginger beer (its not really alcoholic!). <br/>
 <br/>
I think trying to give complete freedom of choices is like saying when they are teenagers I should spend my money on cigarretes and alcohol & tell them to just make wise choices. They are children & are not fully capable of making all of their own choices, which is why there is an adult to help them. <br/>
 <br/>
Over Christmas my FIL (a very &quot;mainstream&quot; kinda guy) actually shared with us that he supports what we are doing b/c he believes 100% that endless hours of video games and a very high sugar diet (fruity pebbles for breakfast, countless Mountain Dew, and candy) caused Brian&#39;s epilepsy. Upon our return home, my mother was giving me grief, as usual, and my father butted in that he also agrees fully as he thinks my nieces add are directly related to how much tv she watches. As many people say &quot;you can just see it&quot;. Even the AAP came out with a statement against any tv viewing for children under 2 because it has been proven to cause structural changes in the brain during a crucial development time. <br/>
 <br/>
I write this not to persuade anyone, just to explain why I think the same & yet differently. <br/>
 <br/>
Another reason I believe we see things as we do comes from the way we ourselves were raised. It seems each generation sways to the other side of how they were raised, or is that just my perception? I was raised in a very free home. I was given free reign over endless candy, sodas, home baked sweets and tv/ video games. As a teenager I was given lots of money & a car & a &quot;curfew&quot; which was never enforced. They cared, dont get me wrong, they just had a very misguided or misplaced I suppose, trust. It took years of illness, fatigue & various health problems before I changed my diet and feel awesome. It took alot of work for me to maintain any form of self-discipline, I am very used to doing what I want, when I want & not realizing any consequences. Brian is too, so I suppose we both relate to that in the same way. <br/>
 <br/>
Perhaps we also have an addictive personality disorder within my family ;) When we had tv, my children wanted to watch it every waking minute. If I said no, it was an all day fight. Our lives revolved around whether or not they could watch tv. Since its been gone, they have never once asked or questioned. Its just no longer an option. They watch it at friends houses and grandparents, etc. They, for the first time, disappear for hours on end in their rooms or outside - my daughter even gets boxes & junk to set up little playscapes with her dolls and animals. These things never happened before. For us, these are the right decisions because of it. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
******************************************************************************************************<br/>
 <br/>
How might you respond to this? There are things I have to say, and I&#39;ve forwarded on Pam&#39;s great post on the economics of limiting tv (with her permission), but I want to write a well thought out post because there are also many on this list that like what I&#39;m doing with my kids and want to learn more. I want those who might be led to an unschooling lifestyle to get a good representation, does this make sense? I don&#39;t want it left with the feeling that I&#39;ve chosen total unruliness for my kids. Granted, with 5 kids, our house often feels like a 3 ring circus, but it&#39;s happy and joyful and it&#39;s working for us. <br/>
 <br/>
Anyhow...off to change babies diapers....if anyone has the time to give me a few thougts that I might want to consider before writing my response I would be SO appreciative. I&#39;m not trying to change anybody&#39;s minds here, it&#39;s not an unschooling list, but want the ideas to be well represented with what I have to say. <br/>
Thank you so much,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025639001">[this is a quote from something from another list, not from a member of this <br/>
one, just in case anyone&#39;s thinking she missed a weird turn &lt;g&gt;]<br/>
I think trying to give complete freedom of choices is like saying when they <br/>
are teenagers I should spend my money on cigarretes and alcohol & tell them to <br/>
just make wise choices. <br/>
It probably does seem like that to someone who&#39;s pretty sure the only thing <br/>
between her child and a world of debauched gutter-life is her rules and control.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s birthday was last week.  He was singing some birthday song about some <br/>
particular liquor (I don&#39;t even remember now) and I said, &quot;Hey, we have some <br/>
of that.  You want some?&quot;  He laughed, and said no.<br/>
<br/>
My kids could try cigarettes.  They have a couple of friends who smoke.  <br/>
Instead, they say &quot;Why do you do that?  It&#39;s expensive and nasty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How could they get there without rules?<br/>
Because rules are replaced with REAL honest information.<br/>
<br/>
We have gallons of liquor in dusty bottles, unlocked, half of it in plain <br/>
view, in a room in the back of our house.  Keith&#39;s brother (my brother in law), <br/>
whose kids are over-controlled Baptist teens, had stories of them stealing <br/>
liquor and replacing it with water so it would be at the same level, and him <br/>
having to spend some money on a locking cabinet.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s where money will be spent if parents are too controlling:  on lawyers <br/>
and therapists<br/>
<br/>
-=- Even the AAP came out with a statement against any tv viewing for <br/>
children under 2 because it has been proven to cause structural changes in the brain <br/>
during a crucial development time. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Proven? How many babies&#39; brains did they cut open to prove THAT?<br/>
Or did they have rats watching TV?<br/>
<br/>
-=-When we had tv, my children wanted to watch it every waking minute. If I <br/>
said no, it was an all day fight. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You might show her this (or not):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/strew/ifilet</a><br/>
<br/>
Cliched exaggerations like &quot;every waking minute&quot; and &quot;all day fight&quot; are <br/>
indications of stereotyping behavior and exaggerating, instead of really being <br/>
with and looking at children lens-free.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t want it left with the feeling that I&#39;ve chosen total unruliness <br/>
for my kids. Granted, with 5 kids, our house often feels like a 3 ring circus, <br/>
but it&#39;s happy and joyful and it&#39;s working for us. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could close off the topic by saying though people predict total <br/>
unruliness, that&#39;s not the reality and those who want more information could look <br/>
here... and list some webpages or lists or forums, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Another possible tack to take might be to say that if someone&#39;s main priority <br/>
is health food or a clean house, or keeping up with the neighbors or making <br/>
in-laws happy, that will inform all other choices.  If someone&#39;s priority is <br/>
their children&#39;s peace and joy, choices will be different.<br/>

of the day doing other things.  We do watch TV and generally we watch it<br/>
together in the evening and we like TV.  But we also play games, ride our<br/>
horse, go outside, visit friends, read books together, cook, eat, play, and<br/>
on and on.  I don&#39;t spend the whole day ignoring my children and they don&#39;t<br/>

But isn&#39;t it nice to have a choice?  Look, even though she had a childhood<br/>
of free rein on sweets, she, as an adult, has chosen to eat healthy foods.<br/>
How could that happen?  Does she think that there won&#39;t be any consequences<br/>
for her children coming from a home where sweets were off limits?  Maybe<br/>
they will spend their adulthoods binging on the things that were restricted.<br/>
It&#39;s certainly possible.  Wouldn&#39;t she rather they learn to follow their own<br/>
body signals even when exposed to sweets?  My kids, who have been given free<br/>
rein on foods, are much better at choosing a wide variety of foods to meet<br/>
their needs than I am.  They stop with one or two cookies and might even<br/>
follow it with carrot sticks.  I eat half the batch and have to force myself<br/>
to eat vegetables.  My mom made sure I ate all my dinner before I ate<br/>
sweets.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217997366">Now, my friends are beginning to ask me about these choices and we have a<br/>
thread going on our local moms list about letting go of control and food<br/>
issues came up.....<br/>
Snip..... <br/>
How might you respond to this? There are things I have to say, and I&#39;ve<br/>
forwarded on Pam&#39;s great post on the economics of limiting tv (with her<br/>

a good representation, does this make sense? I don&#39;t want it left with the<br/>
feeling that I&#39;ve chosen total unruliness for my kids.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You asked so I will answer. Post just the links once, and then step away.<br/>
Try to lose any attachment to the idea of converting or even leading people<br/>
to Unschooling. (You can lead a horse to water......)<br/>
<br/>
My experience with this type of issue, both in person with my local group<br/>
(few Unschoolers - mostly relaxed and eclectic) and on line with the<br/>
non-unschoolers, is to not get involved with this type of discussion, other<br/>
than to very briefly answer questions about my own practices without the<br/>
why&#39;s, or simply say, &quot;We are Unschoolers and we don&#39;t have food<br/>
restrictions&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I allow Jayn&#39;s actions to speak for themselves most of the time, and do a<br/>
lot of shrugging when people are trying enthusiastically to encourage me to<br/>
adopt some schoolish activity/trick/program that they have used with great<br/>
&quot;success&quot;. To be honest I usually even avoid sharing Jayn&#39;s achievements<br/>
with these non-unschooling folk because if I ever have, the immediate result<br/>
has been lengthy proselytizing about the next step *I* should take to<br/>
*ensure* that she briskly moves on to the next level of reading or writing<br/>
or whatever the skill may be. (I don&#39;t like the proselytizing; nor do they.)<br/>
<br/>
This is for my own peace of mind and emotional sanity. On the rare occasions<br/>
that I have gotten into any type of &quot;defending Unschooling&quot; discussion I<br/>
have ended up losing sleep from stress and worry about the poor little kid<br/>
being forced to write 3 sentences a day. I don&#39;t do school-bashing<br/>
conversations either, because it makes me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
If your friends are attracted to Unschooling, they *will* ask you, probably<br/>
privately, for information about it. These are the questions that I answer<br/>
in much more detail, focusing again on what we do every day, directing them<br/>
to all our favorite websites and books for more &quot;theoretical&quot; readings. Jayn<br/>
is in front of them, the picture of health, energy and curiosity so clearly<br/>
is in no trouble over tv or food. I love watching the jaws drop when she<br/>
says no to a chocolate. ;) Your joyful family will be the best advertisement<br/>
for the lifestyle also. <br/>
<br/>
Most local lists are not the kind of rigorous discussion lists that this and<br/>
the other R/U lists are. I have to remind myself to check the subject line<br/>
and make sure I am not about to slam someone on my local list.  - &quot;What is<br/>
the best early reading program? Ds is almost three and doesn&#39;t know his<br/>
alphabet yet.&quot; :P~~~~~~ <br/>
<br/>
The refreshing nature of being on an R/U list, the delight and wonder of<br/>
finding this brilliant, sparkling lifestyle is hard not to want to share<br/>
with all. However I have found that many people become defensive instantly<br/>
(even on these lists sometimes) because the truth is that Unschooling proves<br/>
that almost every thing they feel compelled to do, or control with their<br/>
children and their children&#39;s education, is utterly unnecessary. In some<br/>
cases this is tantamount to saying, &quot;Your whole life today is a waste of<br/>
energy&quot; if they are deeply committed to Home Schooling and all the<br/>
trappings. Trying to force people to hear this before they are ready is more<br/>
heart wrenching for me than knowing that the kid has to study about the<br/>
rainforest this month regardless of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I should add that I do speak up on those rare occasions when someone is<br/>
talking about punishments (&quot;consequences&quot;) for whatever reason, with the<br/>
information that we never punish Jayn. Luckily there are no apparent<br/>
spankers in our group - certainly that has never come up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626232250">Just a side question here...when I grocery shop, I usually buy what my kids<br/>
ask for along with my and my dh&#39;s favorites, most all of which are healthy<br/>
choices with a few junky things in the mix. If it&#39;s a tight week budget-wise<br/>
however, the junk food is usually what goes. I&#39;ve just automatically done<br/>
this. My kids have seemed to understand and have not complained, however<br/>
recent posts have talked about the &quot;quiet child&quot; who would really love<br/>
something (time with Dad, for example) but don&#39;t say anything because they<br/>
don&#39;t want to stress the parent. Would you recommend a pre-shopping<br/>
discussion on weeks like this so kids can express their ideas beforehand? Or<br/>
maybe it&#39;s just a fact of life that we have to buy the healthy food to stay<br/>
healthy and the junk comes second? I believe that at this point, they would<br/>
come to that conclusion themselves anyway. Or maybe they&#39;ll want to throw<br/>
this sense to the wind and live on ice-cream for the week? And what kind of<br/>
catastrophe would happen if we did that (nothing that a little detox<br/>
wouldn&#39;t cure)? What do you do with your money, groceries, and family<br/>
choices for food? There&#39;s probably a link on Sandra&#39;s site about this...I&#39;ll<br/>
look now...<br/>

any form of self-discipline, I am very used to doing what I want, when I<br/>
want & not realizing any consequences. Brian is too, so I suppose we both<br/>
relate to that in the same way. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

But isn&#39;t it nice to have a choice?  Look, even though she had a childhood<br/>
of free rein on sweets, she, as an adult, has chosen to eat healthy foods.<br/>
How could that happen?  Does she think that there won&#39;t be any consequences<br/>
for her children coming from a home where sweets were off limits?  Maybe<br/>
they will spend their adulthoods binging on the things that were restricted.<br/>
It&#39;s certainly possible.  Wouldn&#39;t she rather they learn to follow their own<br/>
body signals even when exposed to sweets?  My kids, who have been given free<br/>
rein on foods, are much better at choosing a wide variety of foods to meet<br/>
their needs than I am.  They stop with one or two cookies and might even<br/>
follow it with carrot sticks.  I eat half the batch and have to force myself<br/>
to eat vegetables.  My mom made sure I ate all my dinner before I ate<br/>
sweets.<br/>

said no, it was an all day fight. Our lives revolved around whether or not<br/>
they could watch tv.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

maybe it&#39;s just a fact of life that we have to buy the healthy food to stay<br/>
healthy and the junk comes second? I believe that at this point, they would<br/>
come to that conclusion themselves anyway. Or maybe they&#39;ll want to throw<br/>
this sense to the wind and live on ice-cream for the week? And what kind of<br/>
catastrophe would happen if we did that (nothing that a little detox<br/>
wouldn&#39;t cure)?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It honestly would truly help if you would stop referring to it and thinking <br/>
of it as &quot;junk food.&quot;  Some once &quot;healthy foods&quot; are considered unhealthy now, <br/>
and the term &quot;junk food&quot; will clog up your thinking surer than bacon to the <br/>
arteries.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you tried living on ice cream for a week, it probably wouldn&#39;t last two <br/>
meals.  Things will balance out, and people don&#39;t eat the same thing over and <br/>
over and over and over without variety.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should just keep a list, and if they think of something, put it on <br/>
the list for them, and let them know you might not be able to get everything <br/>
on the list the next time you go but will try to get it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just a side question here...when I grocery shop, I usually buy what my kids<br/>
ask for along with my and my dh&#39;s favorites, most all of which are healthy<br/>
choices with a few junky things in the mix.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You might also let each kid pick an extra thing instead of trying for <br/>
everything they ask for.<br/>
<br/>
I ask my kids every time I leave for the store what they want.  Nine times <br/>
out of ten they say &quot;nothing.&quot;  You might get to that point too.<br/>

something in the food dept. Those neon-colored sugar pops get me every time<br/>
:)<br/>

week. There&#39;s nothing unreasonable. Because I don&#39;t regulate food, they<br/>
don&#39;t strongly want anything, but I noticed that I DO regulate some when my<br/>
budget is tight. Trying to wriggle all control from my being...<br/>
