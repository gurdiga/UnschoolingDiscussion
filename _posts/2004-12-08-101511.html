<div id="ygrps-yiv-589520401">Hi all -<br/>
<br/>
I know many of you unschool some terrific web designers, so I hope you can share some info.  My son is interested in setting up a webpage with gaming reviews, photos, short stories, games, and short home-made movies.  I have no idea how to do any of this (as often happens in unschooling!) and have at least come to find out we need to buy web hosting/domain name, etc.  Trouble is, there are so many web hosts and they all seem to speak to business and e-commerce.  Do any of your unschoolers have suggestions about good hosting (and maybe not too costly) for personal pages like what we want to do?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1973685413">I register my clients&#39; domains at GoDaddy.com, and host many of them at<br/>
HostForADollar.com; GoDaddy costs around $8/year for domain name<br/>
registrations, and HostForADollar charges just that - a dollar a month, for<br/>
Linux-based hosting.  Pretty full-featured, too, for that.  The space is<br/>
limited at that price - I think it&#39;s 20MB, and he might run over that with a<br/>
lot of movies, but I think that they have some pretty reasonable<br/>
larger-sized plans, too.<br/>
<br/>
You might also check in with your ISP -- Comcast provides personal web pages<br/>
space with their accounts that&#39;s probaby adequate to what you&#39;re describing,<br/>
without requiring you to spend ANY additional money.<br/>

My daughter does a lot of website creation and has tried MANY hosts and <br/>
seanic is by far her favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the packages - as little as around $4.00 per month - gets you <br/>
domain name, webspace, email addresses and more. And they guarantee <br/>
99.9 percent up time which has been borne out by our years of using <br/>
them - we&#39;ve never noticed any down time at all, in fact. We also use <br/>
them for the &lt;unschooling.info&gt; message boards and they&#39;ve been <br/>
wonderful - great customer service!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069592914">I would recommend using a blog for this. Your son can have a web site<br/>
within minutes at BlogSpot --and it is free. If he needs more control<br/>
over the templating, he could pay for it there or try the different pay<br/>
structures at TypePad. <br/>
<br/>
Why use blogging software to create a web site? The technology behind<br/>
blogs is very versatile and powerful. It&#39;s based on templates and once<br/>
you have the structure and design of your site in place, you don&#39;t have<br/>
to worry about anything else --inputting text is like writing an email<br/>
on Yahoo!Mail. <br/>
<br/>
I use this technology for creating websites, to setting up online<br/>
communities and even Amazon stores. It&#39;s that good. <br/>
