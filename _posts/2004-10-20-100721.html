<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477691640">Have any of you read any of his books?  I ran across him while on  Amazon a <br/>
week or so back, when I was looking up the book, &quot;The Way Life Works&quot;  (kinda a <br/>
cool, illustrated biology &quot;reading&quot; book) and his books popped up as  being <br/>
bought by other people who bought &quot;The Way Life Works.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I ended up actually buying 2 of his books on Ebay...&quot;Why We Run&quot; and  &quot;Winter <br/>
World.&quot;  Both have beautiful illustrations, and my son (who hates  to read) <br/>
has been glued to &quot;Why We Run.&quot;  Has anyone read any of his  stuff?<br/>
 <br/>
Any other suggestions of cool, fun to read biology type books?  I&#39;m a  big <br/>
fan of &quot;The Cartoon Guides&quot; but the biology one didnt have good  reviews.  I did <br/>
get &quot;The Cartoon Guide to Genetics&quot; though...haven&#39;t been  able to look at it <br/>
yet.  <br/>
