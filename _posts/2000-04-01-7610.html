 </span></blockquote>Aaaaaaaaaallllllllllll the way up north in Union County :-) I was<br/>
wracking my brain trying to figure out what O.C. was! I was thinking<br/>
Canada, or Australia, lol! <br/>
<br/>
Do you (or anyone!) know where to get a star map? I would like something<br/>
that I can take with me on walks. Like I said, I can&#39;t see very many<br/>
stars up here, but I can see some and I&#39;d like to figure out what I&#39;m<br/>
seeing. <br/>
