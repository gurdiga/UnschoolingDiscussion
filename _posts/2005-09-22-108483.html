<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155577672">Just wanted to put in my 2 cents on this.  I have four dd&#39;s under 9 and <br/>
could definitely not leave the house to exercise at any time of day. <br/>
 I&#39;ve recently lost about 35 pounds jogging on my mini-trampoline.  You <br/>
can buy them at Wal-Mart for $20 and the beauty of it is...it&#39;s cheap, <br/>
it&#39;s quiet (for early morning or late night exercise), you can get <br/>
sucked into a tv show and forget you&#39;re working out, and best of all, <br/>
the moment you step off, it&#39;s an awesome toy for the kids.  Our <br/>
trampoline lives in the middle of the living room floor because someone <br/>
always wants it.  It&#39;s even pretty comfy with a pillow and blanket for <br/>
the little ones when watching movies.   Good luck!    Heidi Case<br/>

&gt; &gt;   One, my only time to go walking is early in the morning unless I <br/>
&gt; want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; drag all five kids with me and two,my 7mo is, and always has been, <br/>
&gt; an early<br/>
&gt; &gt; riser. <br/>
&gt; &gt; ========================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you walk before your husband goes to work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Can you wait a few years to resume your walking schedule?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a neighboring teenager who could come to your house early and <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; be there in case kids wake up and want breakfast?<br/>

fit into your day.  I love Leslie Sansone aerobics tapes and have been doing<br/>
them daily for 2.5 years.  They aren&#39;t that hard but they keep me fit and<br/>
keep the weight off that I lost initially.  <br/>

I had actually thought about buying one of these, but figured that it wouldn&#39;t solve the problem of keeping the baby happy while I worked out.  However, now that I stop to think about it, I could always put him in his play saucer and jog on it for 15 minutes here and there so that he could play while I sweat away the pounds!  Thanks for the idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793288020">It&#39;s funny you should mention jogging on it here and there, because I <br/>
meant to add to my post that every day my goal is to jog an hour.  Some <br/>
days (rarely) I do it all at once, but usually, one hour of jogging <br/>
lasts all day.  But I do believe jumping on and off the trampoline is <br/>
great exercise, too!   Another plus,  no extra cost to your electric <br/>
bill and it goes room to room or under the bed in a snap.  I try to <br/>
&quot;sell&quot; it to everyone who wants to lose weight cause there&#39;s no way you <br/>
can go wrong with the purchase if you have small kids in the house. <br/>
 I&#39;ve even seen kids catalogs selling them.  Anyway,  the best thing is <br/>
all that extra energy you get as you lose weight.  <br/>
<br/>
When I told my girls that I wanted to lose weight, they were so upset. <br/>
 One of them actually started to cry.  She said the I just wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
me anymore if I looked different.  I explained that I wanted to be <br/>
bouncier and feel like playing more often, and now they can see that <br/>
it&#39;s true.  It&#39;s so important to me to set a good example of working <br/>
toward a healthy body...not just a skinny one.  But most days, I still <br/>
have to talk myself into it and leave little notes around reminding me <br/>
why I need to take care of myself.  <br/>
<br/>
I also started a journal of all the calories, protein, and calcium I <br/>
ate.  It was a real pain to keep track, but it got easier with the <br/>
habit.  I didn&#39;t intend to limit myself, just to get an idea of what was <br/>
really going in me.  I think that awareness has helped a lot.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
worried about how over 9 years of nursing babies will effect my bones as <br/>
I get older.  It&#39;s also started a lot of conversations with the girls <br/>
about what&#39;s in certain foods and how those ingredients will affect our <br/>
health and our emotions.  My second dd has always had wild mood swings <br/>
and now she&#39;s starting to learn how lack of protein can effect her <br/>
ability to cope with things.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  Go buy a trampoline!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1922296780">That&#39;s too funny!  The dog I had when I was a teenager, Sheena, a Malamute/German Shepherd mix, used to sleep at the foot of  my bed. Whenever I would get out of bed to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night she would burrow under the covers and then climb back up to put her head on my pillow.  Then we&#39;d go back to sleep together.  She would have loved a mini-trampoline &quot;bed&quot;.<br/>
