Good thinking:<br/>

<br/>
    Statement of Faith<br/>
<br/>
Family Association for Instruction and Teaching at Home<br/>
<br/>
1. We believe the Scriptures, both Old and New Testaments, to be the inspired <br/>
Word of God, without error, the revelation of his will for the salvation of <br/>
men. <br/>
<br/>
2. We believe in one God, Creator of all things, infinitely perfect and <br/>
eternally existing in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. <br/>
<br/>
3. We believe that Jesus Christ is true God and true man, having been <br/>
conceived of the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He died on the <br/>
cross, the sacrifice for our sins according to the scriptures. Further, He <br/>
arose bodily from the dead, ascended into heaven, where at the right hand of <br/>
the Majesty on High, He is our Priest and Advocate. <br/>
<br/>
4. We believe that the ministry of the Holy Spirit is to glorify the Lord <br/>
Jesus Christ, and during this age to convict men, regenerate the believing <br/>
sinner, indwell, guide, instruct, and empower the believer for godly living <br/>
and sacrifice. <br/>
<br/>
5. We believe the shed blood of Jesus Christ and His resurrection provide the <br/>
only ground for justification and salvation for all who believe, and only <br/>
those who receive Jesus Christ are born of the Holy Spirit, and thus become <br/>
children of God. <br/>
<br/>
6. We believe in the personal and imminent coming of our Lord Jesus Christ <br/>
and that this &quot;Blessed Hope&quot; has a vital bearing on the personal life and <br/>
service of the believer. <br/>
<br/>
7. We believe in the bodily resurrection of the dead; of the believer to <br/>
everlasting blessedness and joy with the Lord; of the unrepentant to judgment <br/>
and everlasting conscious punishment.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965468685">Yep - that sweeps too broadly.  I bet that you would get a fair<br/>
match up between those beliefs and most Christians.  Not 100% -<br/>
and some with reservations about what the meaning/intent of<br/>
particular phrases might be - but too many to make it a<br/>
meaningful filter for who &quot;fundamentalist christians&quot; are.<br/>

I&#39;ll never get this one,they say they believe in 1 God,but he exists in 3 people?That means you have a mental image of 3 different people in mind when you are thinking about God,Jesus & the holy spirit,so how can they say they believe in 1 God?If Jesus is God that means he&#39;s a person just as we are,that means he does everything humans do,go to the bathroom,have relations,etc.The 1 God I believe in is much more superior than that & would never become a human,otherwise I would not worship somebody on the same level as myself(being human).I believe Jesus was sent to bring us the message of God & if you read the Bible,it says that Jesus told the people he was not God,but nobody choose to listen to him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282844063">Gosh Sheila, I have about a thousand questions I&#39;d like to ask and don&#39;t <br/>
quite know where to begin. Thank you for sharing your beliefs so calmly, <br/>
esp. knowing that many of us here have had unpleasant, hurtful <br/>
encounters with fund. xtians.  I appreciate the manner in which you have <br/>
answered these questions.<br/>
<br/>
My personal spiritual / religious beliefs are deeply held, and very <br/>
different from yours.  ~~~<br/>
<br/>
on another note..<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who might be interested, catholic priest / sociologist Andrew <br/>
Greeley, who is better known for his novels, also writes non-fiction, <br/>
based on his sociological research. He often discusses something he <br/>
calls &quot;the religious imagination&quot;. What he is referring to is that each <br/>
of us has a way in which we &quot;imagine God&quot;. I have always found his work <br/>
fascinating. If you&#39;re interested, read &quot;The Catholic Imagination&quot;. The <br/>
premise, if I recall correctly, is that Protestant Christians see God as <br/>
&quot;elsewhere&quot; (in Heaven, not on earth) whereas Catholics see God as <br/>
present in the world. That this basic differene allows for totally <br/>
different understandings of Christianity and society. This is all based <br/>
on research, and not his opinions.<br/>

<br/>
If you are interested in alternative views of Christianity, try Elaine <br/>
Pagel&#39;s &quot;The Gnostic Gospels&quot;, Margaret Starbird&#39;s &quot;The Woman with the <br/>
Alabaster Jar&quot; and Ester de Waal&#39;s &quot;The Celtic Way of Prayer&quot;.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html">http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/nhl.html</a><br/>
<br/>
As for celtic spirituality, there&#39;s so much out there - ancient, modern, <br/>
christian, pagan, irish, scottish.. it&#39;s difficult to give just one <br/>
link. If anyone&#39;s intersted, I can share more specific info. If not, <br/>
that&#39;s okay too. :-)<br/>

I like to think of it as three states of the same element, as steam, water <br/>
and ice are all manifestations of water.<br/>
<br/>
So steam can be the holy spirit, water and be God and ice (solid form with <br/>
edges) can be Jesus.<br/>

Half human.  Like Mr. Spock.<br/>

Bible,it says that Jesus told the people he was not God,but nobody choose to <br/>

<br/>
Jesus is quoting as saying lots of things.  One gospel says one thing, <br/>
another says it differenc, and yet people state in pulpits with frequency <br/>
that the Bible doesn&#39;t contradict itself.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone interested in such things, this site is interesting:<br/>
