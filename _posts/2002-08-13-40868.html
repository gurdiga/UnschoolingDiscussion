<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;What about the fact that if the State provides Vouchers then it will<br/>
&gt;expect accountability through various means such as Standardized testing<br/>
&gt;which in turn determines what is taught?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was my (Ned&#39;s post, in part)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; That&#39;s what vouchers are proving. Those who believe that parents would<br/>
&gt;&gt; not educate their kids or find decent schools for them, are believing<br/>
&gt;&gt; a state schoolers&#39; (usually racist) lie. Sure, there are exceptions,<br/>
&gt;&gt; and the schools use them to throw their net over all of us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned answers: <br/>
Yes, the state employees will always seek control.<br/>
Let&#39;s go back to about 1946 when the federal government gave vouchers to<br/>
WWII soldiers that they could use at ANY educational institution in the<br/>
country. The government did not certify institutions in order for the<br/>
vouchers to be used -- at least not back then. The vouchers eventually had<br/>
adverse effects on many colleges (they got used to being on the gov&#39;t dole<br/>
and so the money never stopped and certain controls have been applied to the<br/>
schools&#39; activities), but originally, nobody had to worry about how they<br/>
used their voucher -- it was good anywhere, including religious colleges, to<br/>
which virtually no one objected.<br/>
<br/>
The catch was that the vouchers were given to individual citizens to use as<br/>
they chose, and so not a penny was spent by the gov&#39;t directly to favor<br/>
religion. The vouchers were educational in intent.<br/>
<br/>
The same is true with the voucher programs that were in June declared legal<br/>
by the Supreme Court. They are not given to schools, but to parents so that<br/>
they can choose any school they want for their children. In no way, so far,<br/>
can the school system seek to control the private schools that accept those<br/>
vouchers...the state does not control private schools at all, without their<br/>
consent -- as I understand it.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that most of the vouchers in Cleveland are used at religious<br/>
schools is not relevant to the situation, mostly because those are the only<br/>
private schools available. Word has come recently, that since this federal<br/>
decision, many groups are working to open new schools and make more choices<br/>
available to the children who are trapped in the public schools of<br/>
Cleveland, and Milwaukee, and now other locations.<br/>
<br/>
The only people who are accountable are the receiving schools, and they are<br/>
accountable only to the parents who decide where the voucher goes once it&#39;s<br/>
in their hands. The schools need to meet the parents&#39; requirements, not<br/>
anyone else&#39;s, in order to get the vouchers.<br/>
