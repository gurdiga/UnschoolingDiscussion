<div id="ygrps-yiv-892157028">I am looking for good family books to read for a family of a 5yr old girl, a 11 girl and 12 yr old boy.  And for my family too.  However, mine may still be too little at 3 and 1.. any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Can you also give us a look inside a day of an unschooler?  For example, what did everyone do yesterday or plan on doing today? (Notice that I did not say &quot;typical&quot;...because I know better.)  Also, can you share your childrens ages?<br/>
&gt;Julie- who is really curious, not just trying to simulate a topic change....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Julie!  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, what do you mean by family books?  Novels, chapter books, general books for kids that age, books on Unschooling, or what exactly?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are 2 and 3 (both boys) and we have very busy days usually, but we are often home.  Yesterday we went to the park and met with some friends, a family with a three and five year old.  We played on the swings together, dug in the sand and ran around.  Then the boys rode home in our wagon.  We like to play computer games, read books, play in the yard, and do all sorts of pretend play.  <br/>
<br/>
My three year old helps me make soup (among other things) and tells me all sorts of interesting things during the day.  My two year old is just as fascinating of course.  Today, so far, we have driven around with a friend looking for houses for sale with her while I talked to the boys about what we were seeing out the windows.  We played games with counting, observation and identification, like &quot;find me two kitties&quot; says mom, or &quot;Do you see any pink flowers?&quot;  that sort of thing.  It&#39;s counting, observation, color, species, object identification, etc.  Now it&#39;s lunch time and then nap, but after that, we will probably read together and play some pretend games.  No outside today, as it&#39;s cold and rainy.<br/>
