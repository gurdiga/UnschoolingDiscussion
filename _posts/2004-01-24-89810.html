<div id="ygrps-yiv-16143312"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I need to find more non inciting to violence ways of giving Ben this <br/>
&gt; input.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A mini trampoline. <br/>
 A sockem bopper or whatever they call those weighted kid-sized things that <br/>
spring back up after you knock them down (although that&#39;s probably &quot;violent&quot;, <br/>
it may be very useful).<br/>
<br/>
Found this:<br/>
<br/>
Calming Activities: Experiences that may help to relax the nervous system <br/>
Stretches <br/>
Deep pressure massage <br/>
Slow rocking or swinging <br/>
Fidget toys <br/>
Progressive muscle relaxation <br/>
Quite music with a steady beat <br/>
Bear hugs <br/>
Reduced noise and light levels <br/>
Lavender, vanilla or other soothing smells <br/>
Snuggling in a sleeping bag, large pillows or <br/>
bean bag chair <br/>
Organizing Activities: Experiences that can help an individual become focused <br/>
and attentive <br/>
<br/>
Sucking or chewing on hard candy or gum <br/>
<br/>
Adding rhythm to the activity <br/>
<br/>
Vibration-toy massager, vibrating pillow, <br/>
<br/>
wiggle pen <br/>
<br/>
“Heavy work” tasks to include hanging, <br/>
<br/>
pushing, pulling or carrying heavy objects <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Similarly:<br/>
<br/>
To organize<br/>
<br/>
 -Swinging on a swing or climbing<br/>
-Rhythmical sustained movement:  marching, washing a table, or bouncing  <br/>
-Rocking in a rocking chair<br/>
-&quot;Squeezie&quot; toys (koosh balls, balloons or rubber gloves filled with flour or <br/>
cream, soft balls, gak, silly putty)<br/>
-Hanging by the arms on the monkey bars (20-30 seconds)<br/>
-Pushing/carrying heavy objects<br/>
-Carrying back packs weighted with books or bags of dried beans (this should <br/>
only be worn for 15-20 minutes with an hour or two between)<br/>
-A reading corner with a bean bag chair makes a wonderful place for escape <br/>
when there is too much stimulation.  Some students may like the bean bag on top <br/>
of them.<br/>
-Play dough<br/>
-Tactile Bins (cornmeal, oatmeal, water, sand, rice, beans)<br/>
-Kitchen time (mixing, tasting, smelling, washing up)<br/>
-Finger painting<br/>
<br/>
Some children also need extra sensory input in their mouths and hands in <br/>
order to organize their behavior: <br/>
-Drinking from a water bottle<br/>
-Chewing (you can use a straw, rubber tubing or coffee stir stick)<br/>
<br/>
To calm<br/>
-Being brushed with a corn de-silking brush (in one direction approximately <br/>
10 times with pressure brush their arms, back (but not over the spin), legs (on <br/>
the top, outer parts and underneath, avoid the inner thigh area),  top of the <br/>
feet and the hands)<br/>
-Sucking on hard candy, frozen fruit bar, or spoonful of peanut butter or <br/>
marshmallow fluff<br/>
-Licorice tug-of-war, blow pin wheels or various types of blow toys, bubbles <br/>
and whistles<br/>
-Pushing against walls with the hands, shoulders, back, buttocks and head<br/>
-Cuddling or back rubbing<br/>
-Taking a bath<br/>
-Being rolled tightly like a hot dog in a blanket<br/>
-Being squished under a therapy ball, mat or couch cushion<br/>
-Tug-of-war<br/>
-Wheelbarrow walking, jumping games like hop scotch<br/>
-Crashing games-run and dive into boxes, bean bags and couch cushions<br/>
-Pulling a wagon, carrying a heavy book bag, digging in the yard or carrying <br/>
groceries<br/>
-Sports such as wrestling and football<br/>
-Deep pressure (giving a massage) and joint compressions (holding above one <br/>
joint and under one joint then doing a quick 10 repetitions of compressions, <br/>
pushing and pulling) <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

A mini trampoline. ......<br/>
Thank you -So Much...<br/>
as soon as I read through the list  I realized how much Stephanie (our most volotile one)  likes a lot of these things.Kara does as well. but Stephanie seems to &quot;need&quot;  the feel of some of them more.<br/>
<br/>
I just printed out the whole list and put it  where I can see it in the kitchen<br/>
<br/>
We just got  them a mini-trampoline  from Sears (canada) on  Friday- one of the best $40  we have spent  in a while.<br/>
It is  a few feet behind the new playstation...We were seeing so much bickering and  tears over  whose turn is is to play games-etc.  lately  and they dont like going  outside much in the cold weather  unless friends are over. <br/>
They have just been gravitating to it every  once in a while and bouncing and singing and then  back to whatever they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
grace<br/>
in the BC Rockies-snowing again and getting colder.<br/>
