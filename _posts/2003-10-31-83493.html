&gt;Pam G<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know many Christians who believe parents should have the option to spank<br/>
but in practice don&#39;t.<br/>
I don&#39;t know *any* people I would call Friends of Christ (Quaker-eese for<br/>
Christians) who advocate beating or humiliating children in any way.  Those<br/>
who advocate the use of spanking as a part of discipline usually couch these<br/>
beliefs by saying it must be done without anger or rage, in a &quot;disciplined&quot;<br/>
way. I.e. &quot;if you continue to refuse to ____________ you will receive a<br/>
spanking at bed time.&quot;  And a small , unscientific survey at church last<br/>
night revealed that those raised by parents who were (in this case) Quakers<br/>
, remembered being spanked once or twice their entire childhood if at all.<br/>
Not regularly, need it or not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in a funny position because I do not believe spanking is good or<br/>
necessary and I certainly would never hit my child in anger but I have<br/>
spanked from time to time (maybe 6 times in 10 years of parenting 3<br/>
children) when there was a situation I could not figure out anything else to<br/>
do.  Over the years I&#39;ve learned that in every case, with my children, they<br/>
were *not* accepting of this behavior.  Neither the child being spanked nor<br/>
the siblings would accept this sort of punishment.  They got together and<br/>
gave me a talking to!  (good for them!)  If I had it to do again I would not<br/>
spank. Ever.<br/>
<br/>
As for convincing people not to spank, that&#39;s a hard sell.  Most people are<br/>
not going to change their views about this lightly.  And unfortunately, the<br/>
worst offenders will merely change to another abusive practice because it&#39;s<br/>
not about disciplining the child.  Abuse is usually about dysfunctional<br/>
feelings of the parent.  Mom or dad is in denial or needs to feel powerful<br/>
or is not capable of showing love and affection blah blah blah because of<br/>
his or her own deficient upbringing.  Peacefulness and love are things that<br/>
must be discovered and grown in the adult before one can expect to see it in<br/>
parenting behavior.  It takes lots of honest to goodness work to change<br/>
habits that are grown into a person.  And of course the person must want to<br/>
change.<br/>
<br/>
As for the idea I&#39;ve seen on this list that shepherds didn&#39;t beat their<br/>
sheep with a staff, well, there&#39;s also the rod.  I&#39;m afraid a deeper look is<br/>
necessary if you are going to try to argue the Bible doesn&#39;t advocate<br/>
spanking.<br/>
Consider: &quot;the rod and rebuke give wisdom.   But a child left to himself<br/>
brings shame to his mother.&quot; Prov. 29:15<br/>
&quot;Foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child:  The rod of correction<br/>
will drive it far from him&quot; Prov. 22:15<br/>
and &quot;Do not withhold correction from a child.  For if you beat him with a<br/>
rod he will not die.&quot; Prov. 23:13<br/>
<br/>
You get the idea.  There are not too many of these but they are there, so if<br/>
you are hoping to sweep away the old testament style &quot;correction&quot; with a<br/>
speech on the proper use of the shepherds&#39;s staff, you&#39;ll have to try again.<br/>
IMHO mentions of the &quot;rod&quot; seem to correlate with rebellion of a serious<br/>
nature in an older child not two year olds taking a tantrum in a store.<br/>
<br/>
I think a better tack would be to dig up all the verses about loving<br/>
children and the consequences of bringing harm to them.<br/>
Here are a few for those of you still interested enough to continue reading<br/>
this long-winded post.<br/>
&quot;Whoever receives one little child like this in my name receives Me (Jesus<br/>
speaking).&quot;  Q. how mad would He be if we mistreat that little one? A.  &quot;But<br/>
whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would<br/>
be better for him that a Millstone were hung around his neck, and he were<br/>
drowned in the depth of the sea.&quot;  Matt18:5-6<br/>
Do you think beating and humiliating a child or mistreating him would cause<br/>
him to sin?  I believe so as it causes pain, disconnect and disfunction<br/>
which tends to perpetuate more violence and mistreatment of others.<br/>
<br/>
I like this one:  &quot;you fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath...&quot;<br/>
Ephesians 6:4a<br/>
also from Ephesians &quot; Be kind to one another , tenderhearted, forgiving one<br/>
another even as God in Christ forgave you.&quot;  Does this apply to families<br/>
with children? Of course it does!<br/>
This last verse and hundreds like it are the crux (no pun intended) of what<br/>
the Bible teaches Christians to do and be.  The Christian must honor the<br/>
sacred trust Christ gives us by forgiving our sins and adopting us &quot;as dear<br/>
children&quot;.  What would He say if, after receiving his tender love, we turn<br/>
around and offer a stingy, nit-picky, conditional type of love to our own<br/>
children.  We are to be &quot;imitators of God as dear children.&quot; Eph.5:1   I<br/>
gotta be honest.  God doesn&#39;t take off His belt to whip me every time I make<br/>
a mistake or even when I rebelliously sin against Him.  Instead He waits, He<br/>
loves, He gently prods me back into his arms by his unfailing love.  I want<br/>
to be like that with my kids and I have plenty of role models of my<br/>
acquaintance to model that after.<br/>
Love and Peace to all,<br/>

<br/>
Yes, Pam -- I know these people are out there but what I am saying (perhaps<br/>
too subtly) is that the biggest euphemism they use is to call themselves<br/>
*Christians*.<br/>
I detest these things and I believe (whoa I&#39;m going out on a limb here)  I<br/>
believe God does too.  I would definitely take someone to the mat over<br/>
&quot;training&quot; a baby in the way you describe.  I do not associate with people<br/>
like this because it would sap all of my energy and focus to deal with them.<br/>
Neither am I inclined to be polite about it.  My own small congregation of<br/>
worshipers has never given me a reason to believe they would fall for these<br/>
unloving techniques.  If you are speaking with someone who thinks baby<br/>
training is a good idea you might ask: &quot;Can you imagine Mary strapping Jesus<br/>
to a changing table or beating him with a paddle because he wet his tunic?&quot;<br/>
I know there is a huge number of people being duped in this way and the ones<br/>
leading them astray have much to answer for.  Watch out for those<br/>
millstones!<br/>
I know anyone can use the name Christian to mean whatever they want it to<br/>
and for whatever purposes they decide but the Bible gives me some clues to<br/>
look for to decide for myself the authenticity of their commitment to God.<br/>
Here&#39;s one I use &quot; But the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace,<br/>
longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control.<br/>
Against such there is no law.&quot;  Gal.5:22  You could say I don&#39;t consider<br/>
them Christians but the truth is I just don&#39;t consider them much at all.<br/>
Maybe that has left me a little naïve.<br/>
P.S. I am in fact also saying that my Christian friends parent pretty<br/>
peacefully.  I do know one who thinks a paddle is a good idea (she is<br/>
someone I met at hsing circles, not at church BTW) but I &#39;m working on her<br/>
:).<br/>
Thanks for broadening the scope and usefulness of this thread Pam,<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420559007">Sandra,  I think you are absolutely right, lists like this one are probably<br/>
as ideal a place to change someone&#39;s mind as any.  People who are here and<br/>
reading a list like this might just be the ones who are open minded enough<br/>
to be swayed.  I guess my comment was too fatalistic.  In fact, I am very<br/>
glad to hear everyone&#39;s experiences here and on other peaceful parenting<br/>
sites, b/c it&#39;s not enough to say no more spanking you also need the do&#39;s if<br/>
that makes sense.<br/>

&quot;you&#39;ll never amount to anything&quot; &quot;You never do anything right&quot; &quot;why do you<br/>
always have to bug me&quot; can and does do just as much damage to a child.  And<br/>
I hear these kinds of things in public all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I would like you to know that I think you and others on this list do a<br/>
wonderful job supporting good parenting and If I&#39;m out of line, send me a<br/>
note off list and I&#39;ll shut up but I think since the climate among<br/>
Homeschoolers is so Christians are this way - unschoolers are that way,<br/>
other Christian parents might like to hear that it doesn&#39;t have to be like<br/>
that.  It shouldn&#39;t be like that.<br/>

Less damage.  Different damage.  I have a friend whose dad broke his jaw with <br/>
a 2x4.  They were Ozark hillbillies.  His dad was a drunk.  Stereotype?  Not <br/>
MY idea.<br/>
<br/>
My husband heard negative stuff.  He eats for comfort.  his mom wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
him eat much, so eating is a way to get back at her.  It&#39;s not healthy.  But <br/>
it wasn&#39;t the same kind of belittling humiliation as getting hit.<br/>
<br/>
I heard negative stuff. At some point <br/>
it just made it easier for me to ignore my mom earlier in my life.  I found <br/>

The thing I did this morning waiting for everyone to get ready to go with me just because they wanted to, not because they had to was just say I&#39;m getting frustrated.  And I went to the van and everyone that was sitting there staring at the tv came to the van and we went to the store.  Spent a nice couple of hours just browsing and replacing pillows the dog loves to tear up LOL.  The point is, I thought of shutting off the tv to get everyones attention.  That is old.  I did raise my voice just a little because I was frustrated, but that was it.  And that will teach them to use good words instead of screaming mean things and hitting themselves.

  &lt;&lt; I am a reformed spanker, and reformed expecting imediate obedience from <br/>
  the children.  Heck I don&#39;t even spank the dog!  Since the very first when I <br/>
  started this list and reading, we have no more spanking, although a few times I <br/>
  threatened but I didn&#39;t carry it out because I knew I didn&#39;t want to spank <br/>
  them.  Don&#39;&#39;t like it never did.  Just didn&#39;t know another way.  Now I do. Cool.  <br/>

  the spanking page:<br/>

<br/>
  Ugly name for that page, but you catch more future peaceful moms with seeming <br/>
  agreement sometimes than...   (that can&#39;t be turned around very well, but not <br/>
  too many spankers will go to a page that&#39;s clearly marked &quot;spanking is just <br/>
  stupid&quot;)<br/>
