&lt;&lt; Give me the name of this list.  I&#39;ve never been kicked off a list before <br/>
and it<br/>
 sounds like it would be an honor. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOLOL, Joel! I honestly don&#39;t remember the whole name of the list...I think I <br/>
had to join it to recieve some free stickers or something! Otherwise, I would <br/>
be more than happy to share it. There was, however, another homeschool mom <br/>
who made a comment about that particular thread also, though not as <br/>
inflammitory as mine! She stated she was going to leave that list. So, I do <br/>
not feel you are  missing much.<br/>
