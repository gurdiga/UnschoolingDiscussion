<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542510541">&lt;&lt;That is very scary. Maybe thats why some people don&#39;t let their kids go<br/>
on sleep overs. I would have never thought of something like that. Sick<br/>
minds&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having to put this image out of my mind.  I just began to let my<br/>
daughter spend the night at a couple of friend&#39;s homes.  I&#39;ve known them<br/>
a very long time and have a good knowledge of how their ethics work BUT I<br/>
realize that it&#39;s still a possibility, however remote.  Knowing what has<br/>
happened to some friends has made me cautious enough to wait until I<br/>
thought she was able to stand her ground.  Actually, I let her tell me<br/>
when she was ready.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trusting in my discernment as well as my daughter&#39;s and our open<br/>
communication.  I think at her age the trust and freedom are important. <br/>
I know the odds are in our favor so I have to make as wise a decision as<br/>
I can and stop my mind from rambling in the wrong direction.<br/>
