After signing on to this group and reading posts for a couple weeks I<br/>

kids--ages  8yrs (B), 6yrs(B), 4 1/2yrs (B), and 16 months (G).  We<br/>
will soon be moving to Virginia after living in the UK and<br/>
homeschooling under Maryland and English HE laws.  The HE laws in VA <br/>
will be something to get used to after having more freedom under the<br/>
MD and UK  laws.  But I am up for the challenge!  I grew up in<br/>
Virginia and think it is a beautiful state, so it will be interesting<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146722087">Hi my name is Denise and I am new to this group.<br/>
I had sent my daughter to various preschool programs and to <br/>
Kindergarden before I decided to homeschool her. We sort of <br/>
&quot;fell into&quot; unschooling, but I didn&#39;t have much info about it and <br/>
was kind of lost and lonely. After doing it for one year, I <br/>
(mistakenly) put her back into school where she is right now. <br/>
She has asked to be homeschooled again, but wants to finish <br/>
the year, so we are going to homeschool her starting in May. I <br/>
am very excited about it and after some extensive research, have <br/>
decided to unschool again. This time I have read Holt and Gatto <br/>
and hooked up with you guys and other groups on line. I am <br/>
hoping for better success this time and am commited to this <br/>
long term! I also have a 4 year old who is in preschool and I will <br/>
be pulling him out as well. One of the reasons I put my dd back <br/>
in school is that I decided to return to College for my BA, but I <br/>
have found the classes less than satisfactory because we <br/>
frantically write notes only to memorize and regurgetate the info <br/>
on the tests. I have decided to look into a correspondence <br/>
program to become a naturopath, but I am nervous whether this <br/>
will conflict with my ability to be available to my kids when they <br/>
need me.<br/>
Any comments or advice is welcome (be gentle though please!)<br/>
Great to be here!<br/>

My DD is turning 4, and we&#39;ve just begun the journey of explaning to <br/>
everyone that &quot;We&#39;re Unschooling!&quot;<br/>
If you spend a few moments explaning why you&#39;ve chosen this path to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-263751546">Denise - I don&#39;t have any advice or suggestions.  Actually what I have is a request.  Can you occassionally post and tell us how things are going with you?  I am interested in your idea of studying to be a naturopath while still being a mommy.  I think trying to balance &quot;getting something done&quot; and still being there when the kids need something is challenging for me, and I&#39;d like to hear how other people handle this.  My kids are older now (11 and 9), and I have recently taken on a project--redoing a house next door to ours to use as rental property.  I can go next door to work, or out in the garden to work, but there&#39;s a limit to how long I can work.  My kids are old enough to do without me for long periods of time, that&#39;s not the issue.  It&#39;s spending enough time with them.  Face time.  Your kids are younger, so once you get them home with you, you will be working on this same balancing act.  How much of the non-mommy stuff to you get done while still making sure your kids get enough of your full attention.   <br/>
    I do know that when my kids come to me and ask for something, I drop what I am doing.  Right that minute.  And when they were younger, if I spent lots of time with them in the morning, they were less likely to need me in the afternoon.  I could usually find a couple of hours to paint or sew.  <br/>
    Personally, I need something else going on besides just kids and housework.  I like having something more visible.  But I try very hard to keep from thinking, &quot;Oh, please let me go work&quot; when my kids want me to play video games with them.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-979843340">Okay, so I was being a tad optimistic about other prople being <br/>
sympathetic to your desire to provide the best for your children!<br/>
<br/>
Really, I had the following realization while family (who are VERY <br/>
Board of Ed-oriented) were asking AGAIN, &quot;So, how long are you <br/>
planning to homeschool her?&quot; My desire to homeschool makes people <br/>
who&#39;ve followed the &quot;accepted&quot; schooling methods feel that I disagree <br/>
with their choices for their own children. It also causes them to <br/>
feel insecure and defensive about their own education.<br/>
This makes me stop and think that maybe I too need to be more <br/>
accepting of others.</div>

&lt;&lt; Thanks for this, Sandra. This reply has served me well with my family <br/>

Yeah, it sure shushes the teacher-friends.  They have hope and trust that it <br/>
will NOT work, so they look forward to the day you put your kids back in <br/>
school and they can feel superior again.<br/>

I have lost two friends (teachers) over this homeschooling thing.  Maybe <br/>
three.  But their friendship wasn&#39;t worth compromising my beliefs or my children&#39;s <br/>
peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-885735550">Hello!  I just joined the group as we just spent time in Sandusky, Ohio <br/>
at the first ever Unschoolers Winter Waterpark Gathering...we are so <br/>
inspired now to broaden our community of unschoolers.  We have a 10 <br/>
year old daughter and a 6.5 year old boy and we&#39;ve always been <br/>
unschoolers.  Luckily for us, when I was pregnant with our oldest, a <br/>
friend handed me a copy of the Teenage Liberation Handbook and <br/>
introduced me to the idea of unschooling.  We decided then and there <br/>
that this was the life for us and we truly love it.  It gets better all <br/>
the time.  We live in Evansville, Indiana (transplanted from Colorado)<br/>
and would really like to meet some like-minded families - so if anyone <br/>
is at all local-ish, I&#39;d love to hear from you.  I look forward to <br/>

<br/>
I am a new member to this group. My name is Susanne, I am mother of 3,5 year old Veerle and we live in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. I work as a video editor, volunteer as a La Leche League leader and have a deep passion for natural parenting and gooooood food (as in delicious, not necessarily healthy).<br/>
<br/>
Because I really disliked school, I decided while in high school even, to homeschool my children without a curriculum. I was thrilled to find the unschooling philosophy on my journey when looking for ways and means to homeschool my daughter, and especially radical unschooling gave me many insights.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to learn and share on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-256370986">Well, not illegal, it doesn&#39;t &#39;exist&#39; officially. In the &#39;60&#39;s a law was passed that changed the obligatory learning for children in compulsory school attendance (I hope this is clear enough in my recreational English). Homeschooling was no longer allowed. <br/>
<br/>
But you can have, by law, &#39;reasonable doubt&#39; about the philosophies and religions the schools in the surroundings of 25 km from your home have. If none of them match your own religion or lifestyle philosophy, you can get exemption from the compulsory school attendance. You don&#39;t have to school your kids then, though all parents who go through the trouble of finding out how to keep their kids at home, off course DO school their kids, this is without even taking the unschooling thoughts in account, off course.<br/>
This is all mostly easy to do when your children haven&#39;t gone to school ever. If they did go to school at first, it is harder to &#39;proof&#39; your reasonable doubt because you did, once, seem to agree enough with a nearby school&#39;s philosophy to send your children to that school.<br/>
Many parents end up in court, fighting for the right to homeschool. Most win, I think, but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
So people do, even legally, homeschool in Holland. In Germany it is totally illegal, I think, but not here.<br/>

It&#39;s not illegal, but it depends on where you live :-( if you&#39;ll be getting<br/>
in trouble or not.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is not technically recognized by Dutch law. However, many are<br/>
able to obtain a religious exemption to compulsory education (HSLDA site).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But there is a growing number of homeschoolers in Holland!! :-):-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-974416646">-=-But you can have, by law, &#39;reasonable doubt&#39; about the philosophies  <br/>
and religions the schools in the surroundings of 25 km from your home  <br/>
have. If none of them match your own religion or lifestyle philosophy,  <br/>
you can get exemption from the compulsory school attendance. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone could set up a computer to make maps to show places to  <br/>
live where people are 25 km from any but one or two schools to make it  <br/>
easier. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-If they did go to school at first, it is harder to &#39;proof&#39; your  <br/>
reasonable doubt because you did, once, seem to agree enough with a  <br/>
nearby school&#39;s philosophy to send your children to that school.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How could you know you agree until you try it?<br/>
And people can change religions and beliefs, surely.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting!<br/>

Could have been easier, if Holland would have been a lot bigger and had less people living here- we are with 16,5 million people on a tiny part of land, the population density is about 400 people per km2. So wherever you go, loads of people and schools...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*How could you know you agree until you try it?<br/>

<br/>
Basically you can only get exemption with some known life philosophies or religions, and all the schools in Holland are either public or based on a religion or philosophy. Changing religion is def. a very good way to go to get exemption after school attendance,  but some people don&#39;t like that option.<br/>
<br/>
*Interesting!*<br/>
<br/>
and weird...<br/>

The Netherlands is a very very small country with more than 16,5 million people living here. It is not possible to live anywhere that&#39;s 25 km away from a school. Usually there are at least 10-20 schools within that area.<br/>
<br/>
---And people can change religions and beliefs, surely.---<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what Dutch parents usually do when they want to homeschool their children that have already been to school. It is what we did anyway, my son went to school for three months and when we took him out of school, we had to claim we had suddenly adopted a new religion &lt;g&gt; Ah well, there are worse things in life, we don&#39;t have to prove we are actually practizing our religion &lt;g&gt; And now my son get&#39;s to stay home and that&#39;s wonderful!</div>

As we&#39;re on the subject, if anyone has time and knowledge of regional  <br/>
resources I should add there (the more unschooling the better; I can&#39;t  <br/>
list all home education stuff in the world), please let me know.<br/>
