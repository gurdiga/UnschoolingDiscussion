Hi ladies,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious about those of you who have only children. Although we&#39;ve <br/>
been hs&#39;s for 4 years, we&#39;ve only been unschooling the last 4 - 5 <br/>
months. I read a lot (on message boards, in hs/us magazines, etc.) <br/>
about familes with 2+ children. Their kids play together, do projects <br/>
together, etc. I know that these parents also spend a lot of time <br/>
with their kids, but their kids also seem to spend a fair amount of <br/>
time doing things *together*. We don&#39;t have any kids nearby, nor <br/>
unschoolers (we do know some VERY strict school-at-homers, but we <br/>
don&#39;t socialize with them much). There aren&#39;t any hs co-ops or <br/>
playgroups in the area, unless the kids are 5 and under. He does have <br/>
some public school friends that come over every weekend, plus several <br/>
other weekly activities with kids, so he&#39;s not completely isolated.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m just wonding how other familes like ours work. What <br/>
works, and doesn&#39;t work, for your families? <br/>

Hi, Carri Ann -<br/>
<br/>
I have an only child, James, who is 11.  While having fewer children in <br/>
some ways reduces the effort required by the parent, the lack of built <br/>
in kids to play with in the home has a small opposite effect.  Parents <br/>
of only kids may end up playing more Candyland and Monopoly than other <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
For me, finding kid and adult friends at parkdays (for him and for me) <br/>
has been very important.  (Unfortunately, in the community we moved to <br/>
for my husband&#39;s job, the only active homeschoolers I can find are <br/>
signed up for the school district&#39;s homeschooling program.  So we <br/>
commute to parkday.)<br/>
<br/>
Our life is quieter than a lot of other unschoolers.  (Which can be <br/>
pleasant.  If I feel lonely, I can get on the computer.)  My kid enjoys <br/>
being at home.  Until recently he was totally into World of Warcraft and <br/>
was playing that as much as six hours a day, on &quot;at home&quot; days.  (We <br/>
drive an hour each way to go to our favorite park day, and when we leave <br/>
the house, like today, we&#39;re gone for 7-10 hours, including dinner and <br/>
extra-curricular hanging out.  So we have two kinds of days, and it&#39;s <br/>
not meaningful to &quot;average&quot; them.)<br/>
<br/>
We watch a lot of TV.  Mythbusters, stuff on Animal Planet and anything <br/>
funny are big at our house.  Last night we watched Terminator 2 and <br/>
talked about time paradoxes.  (I thought I spotted a plot hole!)  <br/>
Earlier in the week we watched Sky High twice, because he saw a <br/>
commercial and asked me to rent it.  (Both from Netflix.)  Star Trek TNG <br/>
and DS9 are on for about 3 hours on SciFi in the mornings, and sometimes <br/>
he watches a chunk of those.)<br/>
<br/>
If you care, he goes to bed around 11pm and wakes up at 8:30 or 9.<br/>
<br/>
My son is going on 12, but not all of his friends are that old.  <br/>
Possibly because he&#39;s never been in school, he&#39;s still willing to spend <br/>
his time with them playing a lot of tag and hide and seek.  It&#39;s kind of <br/>
cool that a kid who watches violent action movies can still be so innocent.<br/>
<br/>
James likes to read, but for the last 4 years has read comic books (like <br/>
Garfield and Foxtrot) almost exclusively.  (We have a lot of them!) Last <br/>
night he read Harry Potter after I was asleep, but that&#39;s rare.  I&#39;d say <br/>
he spends less than an hour a day reading.  Oh, I do read to him, when <br/>
he asks, and he picks what we read.  We&#39;ve read most of the HP books <br/>
together multiple times.  The last book my husband read to him was <br/>
Swimming to Antarctica.  I had picked this up at the library for my <br/>
husband, who&#39;s a swim coach, but my kid liked it a lot and asked for <br/>
more memoirs.  (I&#39;m thinking Farley Mowat.)<br/>
<br/>
I get concerned sometimes about the amount of so called &quot;screen time&quot; my <br/>
son is getting, and find it hard to get him out and moving on the day we <br/>
don&#39;t go to the park.  I don&#39;t use threats, but I have stooped to <br/>
noodging.  (I don&#39;t recommend this.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to get him to go cabin camping in the Santa Cruz mountains <br/>
with our state group next week, but he doesn&#39;t want to go without his <br/>
dad.  I think he doubts my competence. &lt;g&gt;  (My husband is a school <br/>
teacher so his schedule conflicts with a lot of great dates for <br/>
homeschooling events.  Darn it.)<br/>
