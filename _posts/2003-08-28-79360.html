Still not ready with names. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

But humor!<br/>
<br/>
The pirate name page is fun.  Not for little kids, but for us!<br/>

So at the end you can donate money, and I thought hey, that WAS fun.  So I <br/>
donated a dollar.  Here&#39;s what you get to read if you go through that, though.  <br/>
The appeal and the thank-you:<br/>

fi-del&#39;i-te: shameless begging page <br/>
Rest assured, all donations will got to feed and clothe the needy, or pay for <br/>
webhosting and CDs and electronics equipment. What! I&#39;m needy, trust me. My <br/>
ex-girlfriends are always going on about how needy I am. <br/>

<br/>
Note from fidelite:<br/>
Oh most happy donor of money for my page! You are truly a soul blessed with <br/>
wisdom and compassion, and I pray that your first child will be a masculine <br/>
child. Or a feminine child. Or a hermaphroditic child. It&#39;s up to you.</div>
