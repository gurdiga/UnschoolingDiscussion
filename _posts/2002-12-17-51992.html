<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  So kids and I had a discussion.. about <br/>
&gt; how well 8 yo handled it, about people being judgemental, and so on. I <br/>
&gt; learned in this discussion that when they play with this woman&#39;s <br/>
&gt; granddaughters, she consistently feels the need to direct their play.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my first homeschooling experiences with a group was at a park.  All <br/>
boys (which was great for MY boy).  One of the kids brought a bag of matchbox <br/>
cars and all the little boys gathered on the sidewalk to play. One of the <br/>
moms immediately went over and began directing their play - not just their <br/>
play, their dialogue!  I remember thinking &quot;oh my god, if this is <br/>
homeschooling, I&#39;m out of here&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
My MIL taught school for nearly 30 years so you can imagine what she thinks <br/>
of all this.  Fortunately, DH is not close to his mom so we see her <br/>
infrequently (that sounds like a horrible thing to say, sorry).  My parents <br/>
are quieter about their concerns but we still know they aren&#39;t behind us in <br/>
our decision.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that has been a wonderful experience for me is to watch Michael in <br/>
his TaeKwon Do class.  He&#39;s the only homeschooled kid - lots of little boys <br/>
in the class that are his age.  The difference in behavior is astounding.  <br/>
The other boys are wild animals - don&#39;t pay attention, run all over, don&#39;t <br/>
listen.  I can only believe that it&#39;s because they&#39;ve been forced to sit in a <br/>
classroom for 7 hours, forced to &quot;listen&quot; to a teacher, &quot;forced&quot; to obey, <br/>
&quot;forced&quot; to comply with someone&#39;s ideas about what they should be doing.  <br/>
Maybe if our MIL&#39;s could see our children in a setting like this it would <br/>
help them understand what we&#39;re doing!<br/>

This happened with my two younger kids in karate class.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has been at the same dojo since he was nine, is established socially, <br/>
is the ranking teenager these days (older ones having gone off to school in <br/>
other places), and teaches once a week.<br/>
<br/>
But both Marty and Holly tried the school too.  Separately they complained of <br/>
the other kids not listening, not taking it seriously, not trying if the <br/>
sensei wasn&#39;t right there watching, of trying to keep THEM from paying <br/>
attention.<br/>
<br/>
And lest people think my kids are humorless, they aren&#39;t.  But they thought <br/>
people were going there to learn karate!  And they didn&#39;t want to waste time <br/>
or be uncooperative.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them dropped out after their first belt test.  Said they had no <br/>
interest in being with those other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was sad, but glad Kirby kept up.<br/>
<br/>
Marty didn&#39;t like ice hockey, either, the year he played.  On the ice was <br/>
fine, but he didn&#39;t like the locker-room life, nor the way the other kids&#39; <br/>
dads treated them.  It was stressful for him being around shame and meanness, <br/>
it seemed.<br/>
<br/>
He still skates for fun sometimes, but has no interest in hockey or <br/>
competitions.<br/>
