<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107393729">Thank you, Marjorie. It&#39;s reassuring to hear there&#39;s a lot of other <br/>
unschoolers here, since we haven&#39;t met any yet. (We&#39;ve been here in Ohio only <br/>
a couple of years.) I&#39;ve heard of HECLC, but I seem to hear about meetings <br/>
after they happen, instead of before. I thought I was on an e-mail list for <br/>
them, but I think I&#39;m trying to go in so many directions at once I can&#39;t seem <br/>
to follow up anything completely. I&#39;ll keep the 23rd free! <br/>
<br/>
Also - what is the &quot;old Resource Center&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Linda<br/>

&gt; As far as I know, there aren&#39;t any official unschooling groups in town, but<br/>
&gt; there are a lot of unschoolers.  There also used to be a playgroup at the<br/>
&gt; old Resource Center for families with young children, but i don&#39;t know if <br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; still in existance or not.  I would recommend attending a meeting or two to<br/>
&gt; see who you could hook up with.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are you familiar with HECLC?  It&#39;s a group trying to start a  new Resource<br/>
&gt; Center in Columbus.  Our next meeting is Thursday the 23rd at the<br/>
&gt; Worthington Library.<br/>
