I would look several moves back in the game.  <br/>
What did you do before he said &quot;I hate you&quot;?<br/>
What did his brother do before he said he hated his brother?<br/>
<br/>
Things are wrong that are bigger and worse than the child&#39;s reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Have older members of the family have expressed feelings this strong about <br/>
people or things?  Is hating people (or saying so) a thing he hears or feels <br/>
outside himself?<br/>
<br/>
How old is he?  was he an only child before the brother came along?<br/>
If so, I think that&#39;s a MUCH bigger deal than anyone begins to realize who <br/>
wasn&#39;t a firstborn.<br/>

<br/>
My 5yo sometimes says this to me.  Sometimes he says<br/>
it about his brother.<br/>
<br/>
I used to say, &quot;you don&#39;t mean that&quot;.  But I realize<br/>
that at that moment he really does mean it.<br/>
<br/>
It is ok.<br/>
<br/>
He is angry and frustrated and can&#39;t think of any<br/>
other way to express it.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I say, &quot;you are angry at me because I<br/>
couldn&#39;t/didn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t (fill in the blank)&quot;.  Then I<br/>
tell him that I love him even if he is angry and even<br/>
if he says mean things to me, and that when he is not<br/>
so angry we can talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
Usually in a few minutes he says, &quot;I don&#39;t hate you. <br/>
I love you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then we talk.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes he stays angry for a long time.  And<br/>
sometimes now he will say, &quot;I am really angry at you<br/>
because...&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Told him to sit on his bed, after he took a Christmas present and <br/>
threw it at the wall. Yes, my tone was angry, though not, I don&#39;t <br/>
know, enraged. Just strong. But he says this frequently to each of <br/>
us in the family with very little provocation. He definitely thinks <br/>
everything should go his way, and anything that isn&#39;t entirely in <br/>
his favor is a huge injustice, in his eyes. <br/>
<br/>
And NO... we have NEVER said this to him or anything like it. In <br/>
fact, we&#39;ve frequently told him, &quot;You&#39;ll never hear me say that to <br/>
you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What did his brother do before he said he hated his brother?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t let him take away a toy. Asked to watch a tv show he didn&#39;t <br/>
want to watch. You name it. Thankfully, his little brother has NOT <br/>
picked up this phrase, and is just more mild manndered and less <br/>
emotionally intense than his brother. <br/>

<br/>
Or... the child&#39;s reaction is bigger than the thing that is <br/>
wrong. :) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How old is he?  was he an only child before the brother came along?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He is 6 1/2 and he was 2 1/2 when his brother was born. Of course <br/>
this was an adjustment, but one he was thrilled about. He never had <br/>
any of the &quot;jealousy&quot; that we were told to expect. And he hasn&#39;t <br/>
started saying this until a few months ago. <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s not an unusual thing for kids to say this. It&#39;s <br/>
just ... what do you do about it? We have told him this is not the <br/>
way family members speak to each other, but that hasn&#39;t stopped it. <br/>
I don&#39;t want to spank him for it, but I need to have *something* <br/>
else because it&#39;s just not okay and it shouldn&#39;t continue. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! I think you&#39;re right. I have said the same things you <br/>
mentioned, and often, just as you said, he will a few minutes (or <br/>
hours) come back and cuddle in my lap and say, &quot;I love you, mom!&quot; <br/>
Once he wrote his dad a note that said, &quot;I&#39;m vry mad at you but I <br/>
still love you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Still, the level of his anger and fury are off the map, and just <br/>
unacceptable, in my mind. In fact, after I wrote this, he screamed <br/>
at me, &quot;I&#39;m going to kill you!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I DON&#39;T know where he gets this. I have never, never, never told him <br/>
I hate him, or that I will kill him, or threatened bodily or <br/>
physical harm. Neither has his dad or brother. There have been a few <br/>
times in his life when I have (and I&#39;m ashamed of this) really, <br/>
really yelled at him. But never threatened him. <br/>
<br/>
We also watch very carefully what he watches on tv, and the computer <br/>
games he plays. He watches NOTHING but PBS and only a few of those <br/>
shows. Also videos like Finding Nemo, etc. We are pretty careful. He <br/>
has *not* watched Shrek though many people recommended it. I saw 5 <br/>
minutes of it and I knew it wasn&#39;t something i wanted him to see. <br/>
<br/>
Last week he was diagnosed with ADHD, and the doctor said he is <br/>
borderline &quot;oppositional.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought that kids with ODD are probably learning this behavior <br/>
at home. But other than those few times I really lost it and raised <br/>
my voice, I cannot think of anything in our home that would have <br/>
caused this. We have a very nurturing, loving, home. Not perfect, <br/>
but pretty good, by most standards. We took a positive parenting <br/>
class this fall, and the instructor mentioned to me that when she <br/>
has observed our interactions with our kids, that they are very <br/>
positive and healthy. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m going on and on. Thanks for writing. I&#39;m just hoping for <br/>
ideas, because I have found that networking with other parents like <br/>
this can sometimes be hugely helpful, and people have ideas that <br/>
work great, but that I wouldn&#39;t have thought of it on my own. <br/>
<br/>
THANKS again!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014392581">He sounds a lot like my nine year old son Levi. WHo is extremely hot <br/>
tempered. Anytime things do not go his way he goes into a bit of a <br/>
fit.. He raises his hands and says &quot;oh great.. That is just not fair <br/>
and then lists the reasons life has done him wrong.&quot; I do not find <br/>
that &quot;discipline&quot; works with him. Just aversion.. Like I watch and <br/>
help him negotiate.. He and his brother both wanted the same stick.. <br/>
Yes My kids fight over flippin&#39; sticks&lt;G&gt;. I asked how we could work <br/>
it out. My daughter popped up with a coin toss.. I checked with both <br/>
boys to see if that would solve it for them and they would accept <br/>
the results.He started with why he should get the stick.. I <br/>
said &quot;then I guess a coin toss will not work..&quot; He then calmly said <br/>
he would agree to the toss. He accepted defeat graciously. <br/>
Congratulating his brother. I think feeling empowered is very <br/>
important to him. When I am having fits it is usually because I feel <br/>
powerless and out of control. <br/>
I am not sure if this is helpful for you or not. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I think this is really good advice, it doesn&#39;t always provide the <br/>
answer. At least not in my house. My youngest (and my only boy, for <br/>
whatever that&#39;s worth) has had serious anger management issues his whole <br/>
3.5 years. ;) Yes, 3.5 is not that old, and yes, anger and frustration come <br/>
with the territory, absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
But, having always practiced attachment parenting with him and his two <br/>
older siblings (all my kids are 17 months apart), and always having had a <br/>
very loving atmosphere in our home, Sam&#39;s behavior can be way over the top. <br/>
He will hit, yell, hurl things, bang things, you name it. My mother in law <br/>
tried giving him one of those blow-up punching bag things, as if I hadn&#39;t <br/>
tried to show him appropriate outlets for his behavior. Well, that did <br/>
nothing for him whatsoever. One minute he would be my sweet little boy, and <br/>
the next he&#39;d be enraged. There was nothing predictable in what would set <br/>
him off; he was not exposed to any behavior of this sort. He would <br/>
literally run across an entire room just to hit someone instead of just <br/>
pitching his fit where he was. It was as if he just HAD to hit someone. As <br/>
he&#39;s gotten a bit older, some of this rage has become more verbal, kind of <br/>
like you&#39;re describing.<br/>
<br/>
About a year ago, I started to bring up his extreme behavior to my <br/>
pediatrician, who pretty much told me that I had two wonderful children, <br/>
and now I was just dealing with a high-need child who was also a boy. Boys <br/>
will be boys--maybe, but that&#39;s no excuse for throwing blocks at your <br/>
sister&#39;s head or kicking your mother.<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree that birth order can play a big part in this. My Sam&#39;s not <br/>
the oldest but the youngest, and I&#39;m sure this is difficult for him. <br/>
Frustration is high because he wants to be able to do everything his <br/>
sisters do. In many ways he can, but in lots of ways he can&#39;t. Still, this <br/>
didn&#39;t provide the answers to my puzzle.<br/>
<br/>
I am seriously looking into the possibility of food allergies/ <br/>
sensitivities. Sam has many classic signs, even if my pediatrician doesn&#39;t <br/>
buy the link between behavior and food allergies--red-rimmed ears, red <br/>
sand-paper cheeks, nail biting, chewing on sleeves and the corners of his <br/>
blanket.  We&#39;ve only been working on this for about two weeks, but already <br/>
I&#39;ve seen some really positive responses in him. He&#39;s much easier to <br/>
comfort. He regains control far more quickly. He&#39;s less likely to lose <br/>
control in the first place. When he would throw tantrums, it was like he <br/>
was inside a monster, looking out and having no control over what he was <br/>
doing or saying. There was fear in his eyes, and it was heartbreaking. I&#39;ve <br/>
spoken to adults with food allergies, and they&#39;ve described it in precisely <br/>
these terms, saying things like, &quot;It&#39;s like trying to climb out of your own <br/>
skin.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I started by listening to some well-meaning friends who&#39;ve dealt with <br/>
similar issues. I recently checked out the book, &quot;Is this Your Child&quot; by <br/>
Dorris Rapp, MD. This may have nothing to do with your situation, but feel <br/>
free to email me off-list if you want to talk about any of this.<br/>

<br/>
I think he&#39;s using that particular statement because it has power. The <br/>
feelings within him feel powerful and worthy of such strong words. <br/>
Maybe you can hear it in your own head translated as: &quot;I am so <br/>
frustrated and I want power and control but I&#39;m little and weak and <br/>
dependent and I want to be the center of the world but I&#39;m not because <br/>
there are other people who get in the way and I don&#39;t know what to do <br/>
besides scream the strongest thing I can think of to scream.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Its normal and healthy for him to want to be strong and independent and <br/>
to be the focus of people who care about him.<br/>
<br/>
Think about helping him learn to express strong emotions more <br/>
articulately so that in the future he&#39;ll be in the habit of saying what <br/>
he means. When he grows up and gets married, his wife will thank you if <br/>
he knows how to express what he is feeling in ways other than exploding <br/>
in hostility, right?<br/>

school system, and I thank goodness he won&#39;t be just about every day!<br/>
<br/>
I have read two of the books Pam has recommended and found them helpful in <br/>
my parenting. I have also employed many of Dr. Sears&#39;s discipline ideas and <br/>
those from the Positive Discipline books, but they really don&#39;t help that <br/>
much with my little guy. The girls--yes, they are wonderful, treat each <br/>
other&#39;s respectfully, you name it, because they have always been treated <br/>
that way. But there&#39;s just something more with Sam--something totally over <br/>
the top and out of control. It&#39;s so hard to explain unless you&#39;re dealing <br/>
with it yourself!<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, and keep looking for answers. He has the most powerful ally <br/>
on his side--a mom who loves him!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-644156303"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Thankfully, his little brother has NOT picked up this phrase, and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>is just more mild manndered and less emotionally intense than his <br/>
brother. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Intensity can be hard to manage for little ones. Have you read <br/>
Raising Your Spirited Child or The Highly Sensitive Child? Both are <br/>
full of good suggestions and calming, accepting words. (accepting of <br/>
the child and his temperament.) Just a guess, but are you more mild <br/>
mannered like your younger child?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Or... the child&#39;s reaction is bigger than the thing that is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wrong. :) <br/>
<br/>
Probably not from his point of view.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And he hasn&#39;t started saying this until a few months ago.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Anything new happen a few months ago? <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think it&#39;s not an unusual thing for kids to say this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess. My kids never have.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We have told him this is not the way family members speak to each <br/>
 </span></blockquote>other&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not true. He&#39;s a family member and he&#39;s been saying it. I <br/>
think you need to listen to him and try to understand what&#39;s <br/>
underneath and behind his words. I don&#39;t think he really hates any of <br/>
you, but he&#39;s having trouble articulating his true frrustrations and <br/>
feelings in a better way. And he is obviously very upset about <br/>
something if he&#39;s using this powerful phrase that&#39;s so sure to bring <br/>
a BIG parental reaction.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t want to spank him for it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well good. :o) I wouldn&#39;t want you to give him a reason to really <br/>
hate you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;but I need to have *something* else because it&#39;s just not okay and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it shouldn&#39;t continue.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then I think you should find out the *why* behind how he&#39;s behaving, <br/>
not just try to stop the behavior because it&#39;s upsetting you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>After I wrote this, I realized you would ask this, so okay, here&#39;s <br/>
the &quot;rest of the story&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
There are a few gifts under the tree. We put most of them out on <br/>
Christmas Eve after the kids are asleep, but there are some there <br/>
just for fun. Joel decided it would be fun to separate his brother&#39;s <br/>
gifts from his own, and went about creating two piles. Fine. His <br/>
brother, who had carefully picked out a gift for his dad, and then <br/>
wrapped it and put it under the tree, wanted to put that gift in his <br/>
own pile. But Joel was deadset against it. I told him if his brother <br/>
wanted it in his pile, that was okay. It is a gift from him to his <br/>
dad and he can put it where he wants. But Joel was adamant, and so <br/>
upset, he picked up the present and threw it at the wall. At which <br/>
point, I sent him to his bed. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s something wrong. He needs MORE attention, not less. He <br/>
&gt;needs MORE <br/>
&gt; love, not punishment.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I know you are well-intentioned, but without being in my <br/>
home, how can you make a judgement about the amount of attention he <br/>
receives or needs, or how much love he receives or needs? <br/>
<br/>
One thing I have learned is that moms need (unless they are actually <br/>
abusive) to be *affirmed* as much as possible, because the reality <br/>
is, they are with their kids pretty much 24/7 (esp stay at home, <br/>
home-schooling moms) and if mom believes she&#39;s a failure, she will <br/>
walk in that. If mom learns to trust her natural nurturing instincts <br/>
and that they are *good* and that she is a good mom and a good <br/>
person, she will walk in that! I&#39;m surprised and dismayed at how <br/>
many times people will insinuate that something she thinks or does <br/>
is wrong... when it is usually just a different opinion about <br/>
approach. This is so prevalent and, I think, the reason so many moms <br/>
end up feeling isolated. Because if she asks for help, surely <br/>
someone is going to say, &quot;You&#39;re doing everything wrong&quot; which isn&#39;t <br/>
a far cry from &quot;you&#39;re a bad mom.&quot; And if mom has any insecurities <br/>
about that, then this can lead to more isolation. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1903385240">I think finding out why this is happening is more important that figuring out how to deal with it.  You sound fed up and a little angry with him, maybe he feels the same way about something.  His feelings are as real as yours.  There is something wrong, something he feels very strongly about, but maybe doesn&#39;t know how to express what he&#39;s feeling, so he lashes out.  <br/>
<br/>
Different things upset different people, and trying to understand his feelings will help more than trying to get him to suppress his feelings.  Once he feels that he&#39;s not alone with his feelings, and someone really does understand, there may be nothing to suppress.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-242026170">Based on many years of observing and talking to many many moms and <br/>
their kids, I think it is safe to say that extremely attentive and <br/>
loving behavior will help an explosive child far more than punishment.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean you need to &quot;love him&quot; more and doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t <br/>
love him enough.<br/>
<br/>
You have a problem that you brought here that you&#39;re worried about and <br/>
people are giving you ideas. If they&#39;re wrong, let them go by. People <br/>
don&#39;t know you and could be way off track - they only can go by what <br/>
you&#39;ve said.<br/>
<br/>
Two things you might want to keep in mind: (1) those things that upset <br/>
you most, that seem to you to be attacks on your parenting - those are <br/>
the places you might want to look most closely and (2) remember back <br/>
when it said &quot;read the list for a while&quot; before posting but you said <br/>
you hadn&#39;t done that? That would have been a good idea before you <br/>
brought up your own personal issues since it appears that you didn&#39;t <br/>
realize that this is not a &quot;support&quot; or &quot;affirmation&quot; group - but an <br/>
analytical critical thinking discussion list.<br/>

-=-His feelings are as real as yours.  There is something wrong, something he <br/>
feels very strongly about, but maybe doesn&#39;t know how to express what he&#39;s <br/>
feeling-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there is a family friend, an outside adult, who could talk to him about <br/>
why he&#39;s frustrated.  Maybe if he spends a few hours with someone you both <br/>
trust he&#39;ll open up.<br/>
<br/>
It seems from what has been written (and all we have to go on is our own <br/>
experiences and what has been written) that he has frustrations which are being <br/>
overlooked or devalued.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest had VERY quick adrenaline when he was little.  He was easily <br/>
frustrated with his brother.  What we did that helped more than anything was to <br/>
teach him to breathe deeply when he was angry, or hurt, or frustrated.  &quot;Breathe!&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He would say that to me sometimes, too, if I was getting frustrated or I&#39;d <br/>
stubbed my toe or whatever.  It helps immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Different people&#39;s biochemistry is so different sometimes we can&#39;t imagine <br/>
what others are reacting to if they&#39;re quick to heat up and blow.  And some <br/>
people are quite laid back, not because they&#39;re mature or &quot;self controlled,&quot; but <br/>
just because their adrenaline is slow to rise.<br/>
<br/>
But adrenaline can be dissipated by taking deep, long breaths, holding them; <br/>
exhaling slowly; taking another breath... and after just two or three you can <br/>
tell the difference.<br/>
<br/>
We would breathe with him and keep eye contact with him, and he appreciated <br/>
being rescued/assisted  because he didn&#39;t like the effect of losing his temper.<br/>
<br/>
Now, at 17, he&#39;s the calmest person in our family.  Maybe because he learned <br/>
so long ago that he COULD control his mood.  Maybe because of his years of <br/>
karate.  Maybe he just &#39;grew out of it.&#39;  Probably some of all of that.   <br/>
Largely, we have worked to make his life comfortable and sensible and safe.  <br/>

** You&#39;ll do him a lot more good if you accept his anger and fury.**<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  This is why you *have* to read _How to Talk So Your Kids Listen..._<br/>
<br/>
After I read that and learned to acknowledge how my kids were feeling, it<br/>
was amazing how the blow ups stopped happening.   I could just see the anger<br/>
dissipate after I would say, &quot;you&#39;re really angry aren&#39;t you&quot;  instead of<br/>
saying &quot;stop it&quot; or &quot;you don&#39;t mean that&quot;.   They would feel better and we<br/>
could talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
That book is wonderful.<br/>

Could I also email you offlist?  My 5 yo is having a terrible time with his<br/>
temper and just &quot;wild, off the wall&quot; careening behavior almost all the time.<br/>
It is to the point that none of his 4 siblings will hardly even play with<br/>
him.  You never know what is going to happen.  He is very giddy or very mad<br/>
constantly.<br/>
<br/>
this might be something for us to consider.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I would look several moves back in the game.<br/>
&gt; &gt;What did you do before he said &quot;I hate you&quot;?<br/>
&gt; &gt;What did his brother do before he said he hated his brother?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While I think this is really good advice, it doesn&#39;t always provide the<br/>
&gt; answer. At least not in my house. My youngest (and my only boy, for<br/>
&gt; whatever that&#39;s worth) has had serious anger management issues his whole<br/>
&gt; 3.5 years. ;) Yes, 3.5 is not that old, and yes, anger and frustration<br/>
come<br/>
&gt; with the territory, absolutely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, having always practiced attachment parenting with him and his two<br/>
&gt; older siblings (all my kids are 17 months apart), and always having had a<br/>
&gt; very loving atmosphere in our home, Sam&#39;s behavior can be way over the<br/>
top.<br/>
&gt; He will hit, yell, hurl things, bang things, you name it. My mother in law<br/>
&gt; tried giving him one of those blow-up punching bag things, as if I hadn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tried to show him appropriate outlets for his behavior. Well, that did<br/>
&gt; nothing for him whatsoever. One minute he would be my sweet little boy,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the next he&#39;d be enraged. There was nothing predictable in what would set<br/>
&gt; him off; he was not exposed to any behavior of this sort. He would<br/>
&gt; literally run across an entire room just to hit someone instead of just<br/>
&gt; pitching his fit where he was. It was as if he just HAD to hit someone. As<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s gotten a bit older, some of this rage has become more verbal, kind of<br/>
&gt; like you&#39;re describing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About a year ago, I started to bring up his extreme behavior to my<br/>
&gt; pediatrician, who pretty much told me that I had two wonderful children,<br/>
&gt; and now I was just dealing with a high-need child who was also a boy. Boys<br/>
&gt; will be boys--maybe, but that&#39;s no excuse for throwing blocks at your<br/>
&gt; sister&#39;s head or kicking your mother.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I totally agree that birth order can play a big part in this. My Sam&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; the oldest but the youngest, and I&#39;m sure this is difficult for him.<br/>
&gt; Frustration is high because he wants to be able to do everything his<br/>
&gt; sisters do. In many ways he can, but in lots of ways he can&#39;t. Still, this<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t provide the answers to my puzzle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am seriously looking into the possibility of food allergies/<br/>
&gt; sensitivities. Sam has many classic signs, even if my pediatrician doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; buy the link between behavior and food allergies--red-rimmed ears, red<br/>
&gt; sand-paper cheeks, nail biting, chewing on sleeves and the corners of his<br/>
&gt; blanket.  We&#39;ve only been working on this for about two weeks, but already<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve seen some really positive responses in him. He&#39;s much easier to<br/>
&gt; comfort. He regains control far more quickly. He&#39;s less likely to lose<br/>
&gt; control in the first place. When he would throw tantrums, it was like he<br/>
&gt; was inside a monster, looking out and having no control over what he was<br/>
&gt; doing or saying. There was fear in his eyes, and it was heartbreaking.<br/>
I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; spoken to adults with food allergies, and they&#39;ve described it in<br/>
precisely<br/>
&gt; these terms, saying things like, &quot;It&#39;s like trying to climb out of your<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; skin.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I started by listening to some well-meaning friends who&#39;ve dealt with<br/>
&gt; similar issues. I recently checked out the book, &quot;Is this Your Child&quot; by<br/>
&gt; Dorris Rapp, MD. This may have nothing to do with your situation, but feel<br/>
&gt; free to email me off-list if you want to talk about any of this.<br/>

What do you do when your child screams &quot;I hate you!!&quot; Or: &quot;I hate my <br/>
brother!! I wish he had never been born!! I don&#39;t want a brother!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
<br/>
I have one who used to say things like this when he was really little and <br/>
really frustrated.  He would also say he hated himself, which, believe it or not, <br/>
is more heartbreaking to hear than &quot;I hate you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would usually say something like, &quot;Well, I love you, and I think you&#39;ll <br/>
feel differently at another time.&quot;  Sometimes I said, &quot;I will love you forever, <br/>
no matter how you feel about me.&quot;  And I wouldn&#39;t be flip about it or kidding <br/>
or mock serious.  I was absolutely serious.  Sometimes what I said would be <br/>
accompanied by a tight squeeze or locking eyes with him, if he would let me.  <br/>
Sometimes, after that, I would say, &quot;It hurts me to hear you say that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I handled it this way because I have a history of depression, and I believe <br/>
at those moments when I was feeling like I hated everyone but mostly myself, <br/>
was that I really wanted reassurance that I was loved.  <br/>
<br/>
I really didn&#39;t want to acknowledge his feelings of self-hatred, so I avoided <br/>
actually discussing the feelings.  That was too hard for me.  That might not <br/>
have been the best tactic, but it was all I could do at the time.  Eventually <br/>
it ended.  I&#39;m not saying he doesn&#39;t still have those feelings, but he doesn&#39;t <br/>
lash out anymore.  I think it&#39;s simply because he aged out of it.<br/>
