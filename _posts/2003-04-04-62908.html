&gt; me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And he didn&#39;t look at me for permission to say yes, which seemed an <br/>
&gt; indicator <br/>
&gt; that he felt whole in the situation too.  And it was his post-doctor-visit <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a nice morning.  I know my boys take charge of their own menus at <br/>
restaurants.  The server always looks at me and I say whatever they want.  <br/>
They order, and ask for refills.  I love to see that.  When I was young I had <br/>
to ask my parents permission for everything.<br/>
<br/>
We were at a sledding party this winter and after they had finished sledding, <br/>
the hostess offered the children some hot chocolate.  Dallen asked for <br/>
another cup and she said maybe he should ask his Mom first, he said <br/>
no..she&#39;ll say OK.  And I would have.  I overheard all this from the living <br/>
room.  <br/>
