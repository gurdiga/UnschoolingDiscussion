<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031277365">Oh, Holly what a tough situation!  I just can&#39;t imagine trying to <br/>
support a family by myself (though on occasion, I guess like most <br/>
folks, I&#39;ve tried...) We work from home as accountants, but that <br/>
involves visiting clients, not practical with kids in tow.  I&#39;m <br/>
contemplating a nappy laundry and delivery business, but that <br/>
would mean a lot of time in the car and doing laundry for the kids, <br/>
if my mum didn&#39;t live down the road and dh work &#39;odd&#39; hours.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know where your expertise lies, but I know folk who are <br/>
writing or running web-businesses from home.  Apart from that, I <br/>
don&#39;t know what to say, except that whatever happens, it&#39;ll work <br/>
out.<br/>

That does seem a horrible situation for you...When I had kids I took <br/>
everything that I knew how to do and made it into a business.  My suggestion, <br/>
if you are up for one, is to get something started before you leave so that <br/>
you can continue to do the other things that are important in your life, such <br/>
as your unschooling.  Make a list of all the things you are good at and have <br/>
experience at and love doing and find something that you can apply that too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899686738">Is anyone here a practicing Catholic, or know of some resources<br/>
for Catholic unschoolers?  In addition to taking my son out<br/>
of school, it looks like he will be unable to return to his<br/>
religious education class.  Long story.  I definitely believe in<br/>
philosophy of child led learning, but I also want to raise<br/>
my child in my faith.  That seems to be a pretty daunting task<br/>
at the moment with no family help, no religious ed help, and<br/>
a child with a very skeptical mind.<br/>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m so sorry to hear about your marriage falling apart. It&#39;s so difficult to balance your needs with your children&#39;s needs, isn&#39;t it? I don&#39;t know if these sites will help you out at all, but maybe you can find some leads at www.apbiz.com or www.wahm.com. Wish I could help more!<br>

Was it easy to get started?  Does e-bay send you a check for what you have <br/>
sold or does your money come straight to you?  This sounds very interesting <br/>
to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795314531">Good morning Holly!<br/>
The money comes straight to you.The buyer pays shipping .If I can do it<br/>
anyone can.It took a little bit to get used to it,but I learned fast.<br/>
Anyone can do it!<br/>
I use Auction watch to list my items,which makes it 100 percent<br/>
easier,and its free.I accept checks,money orders,paypal and<br/>
billpoint.Paypal is a free service which allows you to get money in an<br/>
instant from anyone with a credit card.I love that service.After the<br/>
auction ends you email each person who one  an auction of yours,tell<br/>
them the amount,item number,etc.. and when they get back to you they<br/>
tell you usually how they will pay,give their name and address.<br/>
When payment arrives if it is a money order or cash,or paypal the item<br/>
goes out within 2 days.If it is paid by check,you have the option of<br/>
holding it for as long as your bank takes to clear it.<br/>
Than you ship to each person.Since I have gotten so busy,I now only ship<br/>
on Tuesdays and Fridays.I was going to the post office every day at one<br/>
point.<br/>
What I do to keep track of my bidders that win,is use colored index<br/>
cards where I write all their info down.Item numbers,price<br/>
,shipping,etc..Than I keep all my cards in a file box after I am done<br/>
with the transaction.If you have any more questions,feel free to write.<br/>
hope this helps some...Have a super day!Debra :)<br/>
It costs .25 to list each item on ebay,ebay gets I think 3 percent or 5<br/>
percent on any item sold,which is not hardly anything at all.You can pay<br/>
differently.At the end of each month ebay charges my credit card for the<br/>
amount.There are different ways to do that I think.deb<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Does anyone know any stay at home work opportunities<br/>
&gt; &gt; that could actually support two kids?  Any help or suggestions would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I am eager to hear the responses to this. I can&#39;t help much but did want to<br/>
&gt;let you know there&#39;s an email list for working and homeschooling and the<br/>
&gt;folks there can probably give you some good ideas. There are lots of single<br/>
&gt;moms on the list. Here&#39;s the URL:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-615223130">Holly when you first hear of it,and start it seems complicated.It really<br/>

experience and I am doing it.I believe anyone can do it.YOu must like<br/>
people,be willing to write lots of emails,and cater to the customer.You<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Good morning Holly!<br/>
&gt; &gt;The money comes straight to you.The buyer pays shipping .If I can do it<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone can.It took a little bit to get used to it,but I learned fast.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Anyone can do it!<br/>
&gt; &gt;I use Auction watch to list my items,which makes it 100 percent<br/>
&gt; &gt;easier,and its free.I accept checks,money orders,paypal and<br/>
&gt; &gt;billpoint.Paypal is a free service which allows you to get money in an<br/>
&gt; &gt;instant from anyone with a credit card.I love that service.After the<br/>
&gt; &gt;auction ends you email each person who one  an auction of yours,tell<br/>
&gt; &gt;them the amount,item number,etc.. and when they get back to you they<br/>
&gt; &gt;tell you usually how they will pay,give their name and address.<br/>
&gt; &gt;When payment arrives if it is a money order or cash,or paypal the item<br/>
&gt; &gt;goes out within 2 days.If it is paid by check,you have the option of<br/>
&gt; &gt;holding it for as long as your bank takes to clear it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;Than you ship to each person.Since I have gotten so busy,I now only ship<br/>
&gt; &gt;on Tuesdays and Fridays.I was going to the post office every day at one<br/>
&gt; &gt;point.<br/>
&gt; &gt;What I do to keep track of my bidders that win,is use colored index<br/>
&gt; &gt;cards where I write all their info down.Item numbers,price<br/>
&gt; &gt;,shipping,etc..Than I keep all my cards in a file box after I am done<br/>
&gt; &gt;with the transaction.If you have any more questions,feel free to write.<br/>
&gt; &gt;hope this helps some...Have a super day!Debra :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;It costs .25 to list each item on ebay,ebay gets I think 3 percent or 5<br/>
&gt; &gt;percent on any item sold,which is not hardly anything at all.You can pay<br/>
&gt; &gt;differently.At the end of each month ebay charges my credit card for the<br/>
&gt; &gt;amount.There are different ways to do that I think.deb<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Was it easy to get started?  Does e-bay send you a check for what you<br/>
&gt; &gt;have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sold or does your money come straight to you?  This sounds very<br/>
&gt; &gt;interesting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693332502">Renee, I&#39;m not a practising Catholic (nor really a practising <br/>
anything!) but I think as long as you live your life according to <br/>
your beliefs and share those beliefs with him, he will learn what <br/>
Catholicism is all about.  The only problem I can see would be <br/>
finding the classes required for Confirmation, though if you&#39;re <br/>
raising him with choices, then he can make the choice to find <br/>
classes when and if he&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>
