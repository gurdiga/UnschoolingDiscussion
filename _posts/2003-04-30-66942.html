I asked if they let him know what he missed on the written test and he said <br/>

He wasn&#39;t excited about it.  Very matter of fact.  No test-baggage with him.  <br/>
Cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;d think that they would *want* the person to know what they missed.  In<br/>
fact, it might make sense to not issue the license until they *do* know all<br/>
the answers.  But then that&#39;s like the schools here that don&#39;t let the kids<br/>
keep the tests they&#39;ve taken through the semester so they can study for the<br/>
finals.  That was one of my main ways of reviewing for finals, but the<br/>
teachers here don&#39;t want to have to make up new tests every semester.  They<br/>
know the old ones would probably get passed around to the newer students . .<br/>
. sigh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1513945179">Congrats to Kirby!  Wonder why can&#39;t they just say you passed, or you<br/>
flunked?  I don&#39;t understand what the difference is between 1 point over the<br/>
mark or 20.  For insurance?<br/>
