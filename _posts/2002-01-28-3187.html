<div id="ygrps-yiv-699384441">Once again, I find myself in the passionate middle.<br/>
<br/>
We watch a lot of TV. I think there are wonderful things on TV -yes, we love <br/>
Friends. Buffy is one of the best things I&#39;ve seen in any medium. Television <br/>
can show us amazing things and tell wonderful stories.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it is somewhat addictive. I think computers are too.  Not what <br/>
you&#39;re playing or watching, but the medium itself. That&#39;s what makes them a <br/>
bit different as tools than clay or cats to me. And I think some people are <br/>
more prone to addiction than others. So, we have no TV rules. But while I can <br/>
see that my daughter is generally non-addictive and excellent at regulating <br/>
herself in most things, I see that my son, who tends to be more addictive and <br/>
is younger, needs some help learning to regulate. I liked Pam&#39;s description <br/>
of how it was with Roxana (?). Still no rules, but a lot of talking and some <br/>
mild limit-setting.<br/>
<br/>
Ever the happy medium,<br/>
