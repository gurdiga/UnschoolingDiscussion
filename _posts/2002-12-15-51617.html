&lt;&lt; I cant agree that children always <br/>
know what is best for them.. They are CHILDREN.  .. how can 13 or 14 <br/>
or 16 years compare to 35 , or 40 , or 60 in knowing about life???   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son Kirby is 16 and off to Denver for the weekend, staying with a family I <br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Another friend of mine is 36, and in Boulder for the weekend.  (He and his <br/>
wife gave Kirby a ride.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more worried about the actions of the 36 year old (I do have a social <br/>
investment) and what he might do and say than I am about Kirby.   My concern <br/>
about Kirby is that I hope he&#39;s charming enough that the family hosting him <br/>
is glad he came to their house. I hope he thanks them sufficiently and didn&#39;t <br/>
make a mess.  I have NO concerns about him being &quot;in trouble.&quot;  The older <br/>
friend, though, should not drink and still does, and he&#39;ll be at a medieval <br/>
Christmas feast and his chances of commiting a socio-political faux-pas are <br/>
greater than Kirby&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Even with an <br/>
adult along( they didnt follow us around everywhere), we managed to <br/>
get drunk a couple of times, hook up with strange guys, and get lost <br/>
downtown. I would have gotten in WAY more trouble, maybe even dead, <br/>
if there was not an adult along. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Midnight is arbitrary, though.  11:45 is as dangerous as 12:15, espeically if <br/>
kids will drink and hook up with strange guys.  That&#39;s dangerous at 2:00 in <br/>
the afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Distruptive and defensive&quot; seems to be defined and not agreeing 100% <br/>
with what some others practice..  Also, defending our own practices <br/>
when we are judged harshly for them.  There IS a double standard <br/>
here.. Its so easy to see when reading through the posts.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What there is is holding each story (mine or anyone&#39;s--I was lately <br/>
criticized, if not here then at the forum, for having told Kirby if he didn&#39;t <br/>
like it here pick another family he knew and we&#39;d pay them to keep him, and <br/>
still give him his allowance) up to the light of what&#39;s good for kids, and <br/>
what works with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The double standard has nothing to do with individuals, it has to to with <br/>
philosophy.  So if someone comes determined to defend traditional parenting <br/>
and to scoff at attachment parenting, continuum concept, unschooling, and <br/>
that group of principles (different people pick and choose from different <br/>
parts of that), the defenses will be challenged.  <br/>
<br/>
If I start making Holly do math books, people here are going to remind me <br/>
what kind of damage that can do to her love of math.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am curious as to why no one replied to my response.   I have <br/>
replied to many posts and they are basically ignored or only a minute <br/>
part of them responded to.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they thought your feelings were too hurt already.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;nother form or &quot;cliqueness&quot;..  I <br/>
was thinking, this list is a lot like High School.. or heck, even <br/>
middle school. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think so?  <br/>
The less you see the world in terms of school, the sooner you&#39;ll be <br/>
comfortable with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why do the unschooling police  want to act like a group of Queen <br/>
Bees. that wont allow anyone &quot;in&quot; unless that are clones of them??  <br/>
There have even been subtle advice to &quot;just leave if you dont like <br/>
it&quot;  Well, I am NOT leaving.  I wont be bullied by others into <br/>
agreeing with every aspect of thier lifestyle.  I wont try to change <br/>
them, and again, I must reiterate.. I HAVE NOT JUDGED... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The statement above is nasty and judgmental, and to say we&#39;re like midschool <br/>
is judgmental.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think my <br/>
parenting methods are just as valid and worthy as the next persons.  <br/>
I know I can gain knowledge and learn from others.  I think that <br/>
others can learn from me as well.   <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People can learn from going and reading about what size of dowel to use to <br/>
spank their homeschooled children who don&#39;t finish their work on time, but <br/>
that&#39;s not the topic of this list.<br/>
<br/>
If you really want to defend early bedtimes so kids can go to school, or you <br/>
want to say that a child who wants to show you a trick is always going to <br/>
have to wait until you&#39;re through talking to an adult friend (can&#39;t the adult <br/>
friend see the trick too?  Can&#39;t that conversation be put on hold for an <br/>
important parenting moment?) then maybe you won&#39;t stay on this list.  If you <br/>
think insulting us and then saying you didn&#39;t is the way to interact with <br/>
other homeschooling parents, maybe you have issues which won&#39;t be helpful to <br/>
others.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks Joyce.. I think it is a lot easier when we use real life scenarios to <br/>
illustrate our points.     I think a lot of what I try to convey gets <br/>
misconstrued.  Even the &quot;talking to Judy&quot; scenario.   I said that I would <br/>
have either called her back or asked her to come to see the trick too.. but.. <br/>
I still wouldnt just drop and run at his command.    I would acknowledge his <br/>
excitement, I would go see his trick.. But, he would have to wait for me to <br/>
be able to do that..( not long, long enough for me to &quot;finish up&quot;)  I think I <br/>
have come to understand that THIS list is specifically for &quot;total <br/>
unschoolers&quot; and to go against the grain in any way just causes conflict and <br/>
emotional debates.     I posted the following  to my local homeschool support <br/>
group, so its got some &quot;they and them&quot; references in it.  We have been <br/>
discussing the different types of homeschoolers, unschoolers, etc..  The <br/>
group is a lot more diverse and accepting of others practices and beliefs.  <br/>
And, that is not a judgement on THIS list, just an observance.  As a matter <br/>
of fact, several folks on this list have pointed out that list is for talking <br/>
about unschooling, not other methods of  parenting and/or teaching.   Anyway, <br/>
heres what I said.. its just basically sums up my perspective on the whole <br/>
debate. <br/>
********  <br/>
<br/>
I agree about the &quot;labeling&quot;, I dont really care for it.. but <br/>
sometimes its necessary to define our ideals quickly.  I suppose <br/>
since I am not in total agreement with the parenting lifestyle of <br/>
radical unschoolers, that I am more of a relaxed homeschooler.  <br/>
Really, Im just what I said in a much much earlier post ( right after <br/>
I joined)  I&#39;m just ME doing what I have to do for myself and my <br/>
children to be happy and productive.  Its kind of funny that I am <br/>
being considered &quot;traditional&quot; on the other group... LOL.. Most folks <br/>
who know me think I am WAYY too radical and lenient with my <br/>
parenting.  I think a lot of the very conservative and &quot;old school&quot; <br/>
parenting practices are very prevalent in this area because we live <br/>
in the Bible Belt.  NC (and dont get me wrong, I LOVE NC) is <br/>
generally a little &quot;behind the times&quot; and slow to accept change.  <br/>
Most folks say.. OMG, I cant believe what you let your kids get by <br/>
with!.. I wouldnt stand for that!... And here I am, now being accused <br/>
of being &quot;traditional&quot;   And, traditional does not automatically mean <br/>
bad or wrong.  A lot of us came up with traditional parenting, and we <br/>
are doing just fine.. Hey, even better than just fine, doing GREAT, <br/>
and not resenting our parents for raising us the old fashioned way.  <br/>
<br/>
  Landon and I had a nice conversation today about &quot;extremists&quot;  I <br/>
dont know what else to call folks who adhere strongly to thier <br/>
beliefs and dont accept any ones elses on any particular matter.   <br/>
This kind of people exist in every facet imaginable.  Religious (ANY <br/>
religion) people who think they are the only ones going to heaven and <br/>
if you dont agree and practice thier beliefs 100%, you are doomed.  <br/>
Folks who have political views that they think are the ONLY right <br/>
choice.  Parenting styles, education styles, sexual orientation, <br/>
heck, even hobbies like cooking, gardening, sewing. You have to do it <br/>
THEIR way, or you are wrong and &quot;bad&quot;.  I have realized and come to <br/>
appreciate my own acceptance of diversity.. Sure, I have my own set <br/>
of beliefs and practices for every aspect of my life.  I feel my <br/>
choices are right for me and my family.  I may even think they are <br/>
better than some other&#39;s choices.  But, I dont try to &quot;convert&quot; <br/>
others to my way of thinking.. Nor do I think folks with different <br/>
views are inferior to me in any way at all.  I can disagree with <br/>
someone and still respect them.   Maybe it is a protective instinct, <br/>
when you do something differently that the majority, to be quick to <br/>
judge and condemn others if they dont agree with you.  The thing is, <br/>
I dont really care if they want to make eggs at 3am, or leave all <br/>
thier toys and clothes on the floor, or end adult conversations for their <br/>
children.  REALLY, I dont care  (as long as  no one is getting hurt, <br/>
physically or emotionally).. I mean, it doesnt affect me or my <br/>
children..  I am sure these people love thier children and they feel they are <br/>
doing the right thing, and thats fine with me.  What I dont understand is why <br/>
they can&#39;t see my situation in the same light.   <br/>
************<br/>
<br/>
I would really like to stay on this list. I have met some very intelligent, <br/>
friendly, and helpful folks.    But, I dont think my own contributions are <br/>
appreciated or even wanted.    Several folks here have suggested that I find <br/>
or create a group for folks that share my views and opinions.. Well, life is <br/>
not segregated like that.  We all have to live together, and I think we <br/>
should all get along.   But, thats just my opinion.<br/>

Its pretty funny to watch my kids&#39; faces when I do things like that because they don&#39;t expect it,   I think they are still used to my earlier &#39;saying no&#39; parenting.    Sometimes they just stand there and look at me blankly,  and then they get this huge grin.    Its priceless.       <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It happened just yesterday with the rides at the mall,   pre-unschooling time when we would walk by the rides I would be the parent saying no, we don&#39;t need to do that,   yesterday Kyra, 5dd,  her little face was so excited when she saw them and she asked to ride the horse.   I&#39;m thinking,  a big 25 cents,  sure you can.   I swear I saw her clean out her ears!&lt;g&gt;      I can&#39;t believe that I would even think any other way.<br/>

Actually, *no*, that is *not* the way a discussion list works.  We don&#39;t<br/>
hang around here for the thrill of picking apart individuals (honestly),<br/>
we&#39;re here because we want to discuss ideas.  Individual posts often<br/>
remind us of ideas and principles that we find important to talk about.<br/>
<br/>
As I recall, the idea being discussed was that cleaning rules and<br/>
schedules are often devised for the parent&#39;s convenience, whether or not<br/>
the children appreciate them.  As a general statement, that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t said that any poster was &quot;bad&quot;, &quot;wrong&quot; or &quot;not going to get<br/>
into heaven&quot; just because someone used their life as a starting point<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is being done with out criticism of you! It&#39;s talking about the ideas<br/>
.... If we see our children&#39;s requests as commands, then our attitude and<br/>
the ideas we draw on to respond are going to be different than if we see<br/>
them as requests. And it helps to put those requests in the perspective of<br/>
the kids. If we ask a 3 yo to wait, it&#39;s like asking an adult to wait 10<br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I really neat thing AnneO (from the message board) says she does with her<br/>
kids is to squeeze their hand 3 times as a family signal &quot;I love you.&quot; It<br/>
also says I really wish I could be with you and I will as soon as I can. :-)<br/>
And because she *is* conscious of what she&#39;s asking of them from *their*<br/>
point of view they trust her that she *will* be there as quickly as she can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, he would have to wait for me to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And this is where I might think there might be some value in asking yourself<br/>
why does he *have* to? The reality is that his waiting or not waiting is in<br/>
your power. He &quot;has&quot; to wait because you choose to make him wait.<br/>
<br/>
What does it look like from his point of view? What is it you think you&#39;re<br/>
communicating and what are you actually communicating?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think I <br/>
&gt; have come to understand that THIS list is specifically for &quot;total<br/>
&gt; unschoolers&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Total unschooling&quot; is what gets discussed. It&#39;s the point of view that all<br/>
advice is matched up against. That makes it seem limiting, I know. But what<br/>
it is is really clear directions to a place we think is really cool. And the<br/>
people who want to come and use the directions to get there. And the people<br/>
who think some of it sounds okay and some doesn&#39;t can come part way to some<br/>
place they find comfortable. They can take what they want and leave the<br/>
rest.<br/>
<br/>
Some people define unschooling the way I&#39;d define eclectic or relaxed<br/>
homeschooling. If the list were relaxed homeschooling more people could<br/>
comfortably post but those who wanted to find &quot;total unschooling&quot; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have clear directions and they&#39;d be bumbling around the area. And it would<br/>
never be clear if they were &quot;there&quot; yet or not because they&#39;d be surrounded<br/>
by advice about how they &quot;had to make sure&quot; such and such happened.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and to go against the grain in any way just causes conflict and<br/>
&gt; emotional debates.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think, again, this is where hearing a tone that the writer didn&#39;t write<br/>
comes in. And reading something into a message that the writer didn&#39;t put<br/>
there. From my point of view the debates are logical support of beliefs<br/>
until someone takes a discussion about an idea to imply something personal.<br/>
And then it gets into name calling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m just ME doing what I have to do for myself and my<br/>
&gt; children to be happy and productive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think that&#39;s how most homeschoolers (except the schooling-for-religous<br/>
reasons ones) would describe themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m think unschoolers would express it as &quot;I want my children to live joyful<br/>
lives and unschooling is the way to provide that.&quot; (And I could go on about<br/>
how unschooling would do that.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Landon and I had a nice conversation today about &quot;extremists&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; dont know what else to call folks who adhere strongly to thier<br/>
&gt; beliefs and dont accept any ones elses on any particular matter.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sure, I have my own set<br/>
&gt; of beliefs and practices for every aspect of my life.  I feel my<br/>
&gt; choices are right for me and my family.  I may even think they are<br/>
&gt; better than some other&#39;s choices.  But, I dont try to &quot;convert&quot;<br/>
&gt; others to my way of thinking.. Nor do I think folks with different<br/>
&gt; views are inferior to me in any way at all.  I can disagree with<br/>
&gt; someone and still respect them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I accept that other people have different goals than I do. I accept that in<br/>
order to meet those goals they have different needs. Diversity is a great<br/>
thing in life. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But when you want to talk about one thing diversity makes it impossible.<br/>
It&#39;s like someone handing you an unalphabetized encyclopedia without an<br/>
index or table of contents when all you want is to find out about Thomas<br/>
Edison.<br/>
<br/>
Just because the Episcopalians want to discuss Christianity every Sunday<br/>
does that mean they don&#39;t embrace diversity? Does that mean they think<br/>
they&#39;re better than the Buddhists or the Hindus? (And if you happen to have<br/>
rigid my-way-or-the-highway Episcopalians around where you live, then insert<br/>
any liberal Christian denomination ;-) And because they adamantly sure of<br/>
their beliefs, does that mean they want you to believe the same?<br/>
<br/>
No one&#39;s saying unschooling is the only way to homeschool. (The forum is<br/>
clearly called Unschooling.com not Homeschooling.com No one&#39;s trying to<br/>
disguise the fact that this is a special subset of homeschooling.) No one is<br/>
saying you need to stop believing what you believe and believe what&#39;s<br/>
expressed here.<br/>
<br/>
But does a list about Italian cooking need to include tacos to demonstrate<br/>
that they accept diversity as is a good thing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe it is a protective instinct,<br/>
&gt; when you do something differently that the majority, to be quick to<br/>
&gt; judge and condemn others if they dont agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And no one here cares if you don&#39;t :-) Really! We&#39;re protective of the<br/>
*idea* of unschooling. No one needs to *do* what anyone here says but the<br/>
discussion needs to stick to the idea of unschooling or the list ceases to<br/>
be an unschooling discussion list and becomes something else. It becomes a<br/>
place for people who like the idea of unschooling to talk about life. That&#39;s<br/>
not a bad thing! It&#39;s just different from what this list is.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why there are 1000 members for all the complaining about how<br/>
mean this list is! ;-) but there&#39;s something this list offers that seems to<br/>
be what many people are looking for. There are a lot of unschooling lists<br/>
out there that are &quot;nicer&quot; than we are -- and I dont think it&#39;s the meaness<br/>
that makes people stick around! -- so I&#39;ve gotta go with the type of<br/>
unschooling discussion we have. (Or maybe there&#39;s something wrong with Yahoo<br/>
and people can&#39;t sign off once they sign on ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, I dont think my own contributions are<br/>
&gt; appreciated or even wanted.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again it&#39;s not personal. It&#39;s about ideas. Buddhists are  welcome at the<br/>
Episcopal church and I&#39;m sure plenty of Episcopalians would be interested to<br/>
hear what they have to say outside the church, but Episcopalians come to the<br/>
church because they *want* to hear about Christianity. If they let anyone<br/>
speak it wouldn&#39;t be an Episcopal church. It would be a Unitarian :-) And<br/>
being Unitarian myself, I don&#39;t see that as a bad thing! But it&#39;s certainly<br/>
different from an Episcopal church and I don&#39;t begrudge the Episcopalians<br/>
for sticking to their own brand of Christianity on Sundays or think they&#39;re<br/>
being exlusionary or uppity.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I cant agree that children always know what is best for them.. They are <br/>
CHILDREN.  .. how can 13 or 14 or 16 years compare to 35 , or 40 , or 60 in <br/>
knowing about life???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just a matter of letting ones children run helter skelter all over <br/>
town and just bow out with &quot;they know what&#39;s best for them!&quot;<br/>
There is so much more to it than that. So much more that comes from the very <br/>
beginning and knowing ones child and seeing what they do with life all along <br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
I never had a curfew and was totally trusted growing up. I certainly had my <br/>
share of partying but for the most part, knew my parents had the utmost <br/>
trust in me and wanted to keep it that way. I never got in trouble and <br/>
excelled in school too. (although I hated it but that&#39;s a whole other <br/>
story!)<br/>
<br/>
When I was tossing around dropping my daughters curfew, Sandra was the one <br/>
that pointed out that many kids were getting into plenty of trouble at 2:00 <br/>
in the afternoon. Kids that had to be home by a certain time and weren&#39;t <br/>
trusted and had to cram in the &quot;I&#39;m going to do it anyway&quot; stuff before <br/>
curfew. I started to look at that and actually see she was right. And to be <br/>
honest, kids can find much more trouble during the day among more people and <br/>
when there are more avenues to explore. I saw my daughters friends that were <br/>
allowed the freedom actually using it very wisely. Their parents weren&#39;t bad <br/>
parents who didn&#39;t care, they were trusting parents who had good kids <br/>
because of that. Now of course there are exceptions to the rule but one <br/>
would have to look at the parents and how the kids were raised.<br/>
<br/>
So I let go of the curfew and wondering and really put full trust in my 16 <br/>
year old. I haven&#39;t regretted it at all. She&#39;s a great kid and has really <br/>
flourished especially now that she has our complete trust. If she&#39;s working <br/>
until 10:30 p.m. and wants to come home and shower and go to a midnight <br/>
movie with her boyfriend and then walk the boardwalk or hang out at her <br/>
boyfriends cousins house, where&#39;s the problem as to why she can&#39;t? I always <br/>
know where she&#39;s at and who&#39;s she&#39;s with. And that&#39;s not me asking, that&#39;s <br/>
her doing it so I won&#39;t worry.<br/>
<br/>
Do I know of kids older and not half as responsible and level headed as my <br/>
daugher? You bet, but I also know plenty of adults much older just as bad.<br/>

Mary,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really good to read an update on all that!<br/>
<br/>
I know you had already told us you were glad and it was working out, but <br/>
still...  that it&#39;s calm and good a few  months out is good to know too.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby will be back within the next few hours from a weekend in Denver.  I <br/>
have the phone numbers of four of the five kids he went to hang out with; <br/>
e-mail addresses for two of them, a map to the house where he&#39;s staying.  <br/>
They have phone numbers here and of two cellphones of close friends who are <br/>
in Denver and Boulder (for local emergencies), and Kirby&#39;s insurance numbers. <br/>
 That was e-mailed in advance, and he has a paper copy.   And Kirby has a <br/>
phone card and his insurance card, and a state ID (like a non-driving <br/>
driver&#39;s license).<br/>
<br/>
Overkill?   Routine.  I always know who he&#39;s with, and it makes him feel <br/>
safer too.<br/>
<br/>
I even know the name of the mall where two of the girls work, where they were <br/>
going to hang around on Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
Saying no would have been easy, but cruel.  He planned this, he saved his own <br/>
money, and either he will have had a great time, or not such a great time.  <br/>
And his next decision on an outing like this will be based on this, on the <br/>
value he felt he got out of it.  <br/>
<br/>
When a kid has been &quot;on a short leash&quot; sometimes they get to their first <br/>
overnight trip, or to college and live in a dorm and they just go nuts.  They <br/>
do what they couldn&#39;t do at home, with a crazed vengence.  My kids won&#39;t have <br/>
a time like that.  And what it looks like, and what it feels like, and so (I <br/>
suppose) what it is, is maturity.   They&#39;re not joy-starved, and they&#39;ve been <br/>
making responsible decisions in bigger and bigger doses all along.<br/>

Exactly. And as much as I knew that with the younger ones, it never hit me <br/>
that it works the same with the older ones too. I was afraid to let go of <br/>
that old thinking. And I&#39;ve seen so much of those short leashed kids going <br/>
hog wild. Without them we wouldn&#39;t have our &quot;Wild Spring Breaker Co-eds&quot; <br/>
videos!!!<br/>
<br/>
Tara is doing great and so level headed it&#39;s almost scary. She expresses <br/>
concern for her year younger cousin and tries to talk some sense into her <br/>
all the time. Of course this kid is drug tested and smacked around and <br/>
grounded and then not grounded. It&#39;s not a bit of wonder she&#39;s a mess. It&#39;s <br/>
like the last few months have made Tara so aware of how she would like her <br/>
life to go. It&#39;s amazing what kids will do if you let them!!!!!<br/>

treated---and how much he appreciates his dad and me and our lifestyle. He&#39;s <br/>
more aware too of the differences and the freedoms he has in comparison. He <br/>
asks a lot about how we came to this decision, why parents feel they must <br/>
limit everything---and punish and shame---and what the eventual outcomes will <br/>
be (when they&#39;re all grown and away---&#39;though he says he&#39;ll never leave! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
). He got a good dose this weekend with all the Lovejoys here---watching the <br/>
children interact with their parents and talking to the cousins privately. He <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe what he heard and witnessed (and couldn&#39;t WAIT to tell me! &lt;<br/>
G&gt;). <br/>
<br/>
I wish we had more unschoolers nearby to hang with. But I&#39;m glad he&#39;s deeply <br/>
observing &quot;the other side&quot; and drawing conclusions. There are times he&#39;s <br/>
still not &quot;sure&quot;---with all the talk of &quot;success&quot; and &quot;education&quot;---but he <br/>
LIKES his life and the way he&#39;s treated and respected and appreciated and <br/>
adored. Happy childhood. Happy child.<br/>

different. I think trust in me is more important than learning stuff. And I&#39;m <br/>
not saying that he doesn&#39;t trust you or anything like that. I would find a <br/>
way to do both - drink my coffee AND help him make pancakes. I think it&#39;s the <br/>
tiny little things that we do that make trust blossom or wither. A long time <br/>
ago, I read some Amway rah-rah book on emotional accounts. Everytime we do <br/>
some tiny little thing that is good for someone else, we deposit some trust & <br/>
love coins into their account. (Ka-ching!) When we do something that hurts <br/>
another, slights them in the smallest way, then a withdrawl is made.(Buzzzzz) <br/>
Eventually the account is either filled way up or bankrupt.<br/>
In my heart, (and I&#39;m only using this scenario because it&#39;s already out <br/>
there) If I had gotten up and was AS excited AS HE (Ka-ching!)about the <br/>
pancakes , and went downstairs, got myself my coffee, sat down in the kitchen <br/>
and helped him get what he wanted(Ka-ching!) and stayed there to make <br/>
pancakes in my jammies (since the first offer was to wait till the coffee was <br/>
finished, and didn&#39;t include getting dressed(Buzzzzz)  ;o) )<br/>
Now, to be honest, it&#39;s alot easier to parent on list than in real life, <br/>
because there are no emotions, I probably would have done the exact same <br/>
thing! I do try to look back and see if I&#39;ve done the right things, said the <br/>
right words, made deposits in my family&#39;s emotional accounts.<br/>

asked if it was possible to get one for Christmas.<br/>
My husband was out of work for a total of five months this year, (not all<br/>

payday that had to be postponed in November when David wasn&#39;t working.  <br/>
I can catch him up AND advance him a pay day on the 26th when his dad<br/>
gets paid again, add that to what he already had in his wallet, he&#39;s<br/>
almost there.   We tried to figure out what the extras will cost, we<br/>
looked in some of the catalogs and sales flyers that have been coming in<br/>
the mail and we have a reasonable plan for him to get his PS 2 at least<br/>
by the 11th of December.   He was SO happy.  He checked the calendar, he<br/>
made of short list of the games he&#39;d start saving for right away, he<br/>
asked if I thought it would be ok to give his old Play Station to his<br/>
friend Aryel.&lt;g&gt;  But it could have gone a different way if he&#39;d just<br/>
heard &quot;no&quot;.   <br/>
<br/>
There is a town about an hour from us that has a cart rental place.  You<br/>
go and pay and zoom around for awhile.  Maybe you can find one near you<br/>
and find a way to get there a few times.   It&#39;s not the same as his own<br/>
cart, but it&#39;s something, and it will help him gain experience and maybe<br/>
give you some time to get comfortable with the idea. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, he has been to those tracks.. He LOVES it.. We cant afford to go very <br/>
often, its pretty expensive.    We have come up with some pretty creative <br/>
ways to be able to &quot;fund&quot; the things our kids want.  Landon and Anna work for <br/>
thier grandparents and that gives them some extra spending $$. Ethan will <br/>
probabkly start helping out on Dads farm pretty soon ( now that hes out of <br/>
school)  He may very well be able to start saving for a used go cart.    <br/>
Ethan wanted an Xbox for Christmas.. That was a big gift, so he knows he wont <br/>
be getting a lot of other things.  I got a used N64 for JP.. so they wont <br/>
have to ration thier time on thier game systems.   This gonna be a tight <br/>
Christmas,  I think the kids understand..  I am really looking forward to the <br/>
extra time we will be spending together.  We may make some gifts .. they love <br/>
doing that and folks seem to like handmade gifts better anyway.  <br/>

<br/>
I tried to know where my pre-car-owning teenagers were at all times, too.  <br/>
They didn&#39;t seem to mind telling me phone numbers and stuff.  It was easy, <br/>
because I was usually the one dropping them off.  But as soon as they got <br/>
cars, all I knew was that they had left the house, and if they were at work <br/>
or not.  Oh, they told me where they thought they might be going sometime in <br/>
the next 12 hours, but there was always some extra driving to do, extra <br/>
friends to pick up.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
But I still trusted them.  They got into minor mischief over the years, but <br/>
they managed to avoid police matters mostly.  In fact, the one time either of <br/>
them got into real trouble was when he wasn&#39;t driving and had been dropped <br/>
off at the mall, and I knew exactly where he was and who he was with.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the middle one is 18, I hardly ever know where he is, and he only <br/>
has a relationship based obligation to tell me.  So I work hard on <br/>
maintaining the relationship, and he&#39;s matured just enough to see his part in <br/>
that, too.  And that&#39;s why he tells me all about his band and his friends and <br/>
his work and why I let him borrow my truck when his car breaks down, and all <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Pam S., what was that book about parents and teens that I never got around to <br/>
reading?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi all,<br/>
I know I said I was lurking for a while but I just wanted to add something.  <br/>
This is the list people like me have been looking for.  And I have let <br/>
other&#39;s opinions of the list keep me off for a while now (I am so upset about <br/>
that).  So many homeschoolers out there think that unschooling is just about <br/>
&quot;curriculum&quot; choice or lack there of.  I get asked that question all the <br/>
time.  &quot; So you don&#39;t use any curriculum?&quot;  But it is so much more than that. <br/>
 And there are so many other lists out there that would be great for people <br/>
who interpret unschooling as just about curriculum.  But when you ask <br/>
questions or start discussions about allowing children to make choices in <br/>
their lives it seems like I don&#39;t fit in.  The discussion ends up to be about <br/>
discipline and getting a child to do xyz etc. This list has been so valuable <br/>
to me already in that it has validated my feelings.  For example:  I do not <br/>
make my children pick up.  I feel they have a choice and that I have to ask <br/>
like I would ask my husband.  Other lists have said that I should not do that <br/>
and have given lots of advice on getting my boys to help clean up, I end up <br/>
feeling like what I think is somehow wrong or damaging to my child, the child <br/>
should not have a chance to say no.<br/>
<br/>
 I think the term unschooling sometimes does a disservice to what I am trying <br/>
to achieve in my family.  Anyway back to lurkdom. LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ethan is just 11.. Thats another factor in my feeling that he is not &quot;ready&quot; <br/>
for a go cart. . He has the NEED FOR SPEED.. lol.. and I just dont think that <br/>
even physically, he&#39; s able to handle a go kart.. My dad has 4-wheelers on <br/>
his farm and Ethan has just recently be allowed to ride them alone.  He knows <br/>
where he can ride and he has done really good being careful.  I know that <br/>
even  4-wheelers are dangerous, but  I guess my &quot;eclectic&quot; style of parenting <br/>
has allowed me to give him more leeway than is advised by manufacturers of  <br/>
4- wheelers.    He&#39;s dying to drive the tractor, and I think his Grandpa will <br/>
probably let him this summer.   He already drives our lawn mower around the <br/>
yard.    Ethan does not know his times tables, but  he can change the oil in <br/>
a car and he always tells me what to do and where things are when I have car <br/>
trouble.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256188426">Generally, I prefer to stay out of arguments, but this post finally drew <br/>
me in.  I often see, whether on lists or &quot;real&quot; life, that while some <br/>
people are perfectly comfortable discussing ideas as apart from <br/>
themselves, others seem to have a more difficult time of separating <br/>
their self from their ideas, and from there can come misunderstandings <br/>
and hurt feelings. I like this list *because* it is about ideas, and <br/>
ideas are turned and examined and discussed - as things separate from <br/>
the person who shared the idea. To get the most from a group such as <br/>
this one, you must be willing to discuss ideas, and entertain the idea <br/>
that your way may not be the best way.<br/>
<br/>
So my two cents, is to say I think this list is great. As for all of the <br/>
arguing, well, I&#39;ve been skimming and deleting.<br/>
