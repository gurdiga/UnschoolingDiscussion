<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785350740">Last night I went to the local homeschool group meeting. I have <br/>
actually stopped being a member due the narrowness of their <br/>
statement of faith. But one of the moms who was speaking that <br/>
night asked me to come to hear her, so I went as a visitor.<br/>
<br/>
During one part of the evening, each mother was invited to share <br/>
about herself and her homeschool experience. By the end, I was <br/>
amazed at how much *this* list has changed how I think about <br/>
schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Comments:<br/>
&quot;I used to be really chaotic in how I approached school but it <br/>
drove my kids crazy. They just wanted to know what to do and <br/>
when they could be done, so we use text books now. They like <br/>
the structure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I need order and structure. I really like knowing what we have to <br/>
do and when so I can check it off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve already threatened to send my kids back to school and it&#39;s <br/>
only the second week!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was much discussion about the role of text books. Several <br/>
talked about how they (the mothers) tried to be less structured <br/>
and more fun but the kids got frustrated and asked for text books. <br/>
This got loads of laughter. Apparently it&#39;s a common occurrence <br/>
for these kids to not enjoy the more random approach to <br/>
&quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All I could think was that these &quot;chaotic days&quot; of homeschool <br/>
must still have included stuff the kids *didn&#39;t want to do*  or &quot;had <br/>
to do&quot; and the easiest way to get that done was to do the text <br/>
book format so they could know they could move on to other <br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
The words &quot;what to do&quot; and &quot;to be done&quot; came up over and over <br/>
again. I wanted to shout: &quot;Why would anyone just want to &quot;do&quot; <br/>
school? What happened to enjoying learning and life together?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to this list we&#39;re living a completely different reality... <br/>
which I shared when it was my turn. :)<br/>

How did they respond to that?<br/>
I hope they didn&#39;t look at you like you were a dangerous nut.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think so, though perhaps they do behind my back! :) One <br/>
benefit: since I teach writing online, they respect me as <br/>
someone who has spoken to their groups and at the <br/>
conventions. So they can&#39;t totally write me off yet, can they? <br/>
&lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids get quizzed regularly by their friends (do you do *any* <br/>
school?) and one of my kids is told daily on instant message, <br/>
&quot;Do your math&quot; because her friends worry that I&#39;m not *making* <br/>
her do it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping to start a monthly coffee chat for those interested in <br/>
unschooling. I need some local friends!<br/>

Hi Julie,<br/>
You&#39;re north of Cincy and I&#39;m south....but if it&#39;s a monthly thing,<br/>
maybe we can meet up.  I know one other Mom who wants to unschool,  and<br/>
I think would be very interested.  She told me about a third who said<br/>
she wants to unschool...we&#39;re all in Northern KY.  <br/>
<br/>
And a few weeks ago,  there was some talk about unschooling on the<br/>
Sohsinky list about unschooling...a few people exploring it.<br/>
It could work!<br/>
