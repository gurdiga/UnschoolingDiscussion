<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Shyrley can come to our apartment and she and I will head off to Berkely west<br/>
&gt; virginia and do all the hot spring spa packages.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, YES!!!<br/>
<br/>
We tripped over that place on a sweltering hot and miserable road trip from<br/>
Montana to Texas to New York with a 20 mo. old.  I have never been so<br/>
relaxed in my life.  Let&#39;s hold the next unschooling conference there!  I&#39;ll<br/>
fly across the Atlantic to come to that one!<br/>
