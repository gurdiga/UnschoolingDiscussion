before I started unschooling so maybe they were feeling coherced. At any <br/>
rate... we have given them away and moved on to cd rom games for math. Of <br/>
course my kids are very sensitive being treated like babies. I took them to a <br/>
Children&#39;s summer  library class a couple of years ago and they wanted to <br/>
leave in the middle because the Librarian was speaking and reading in <br/>
babyese&lt;g&gt; Not ever having been exposed to the twaddle of preschool, they <br/>
both took it as a personal affront:) <br/>

Last summer we were visiting my mother-in-law up (in midland, mi - home of<br/>
dow chemical) and a retired chemist was selling a how bunch of stuff - I<br/>
could shoot myself for not buying it then, but did not have the car space.<br/>
I would try garage sales for traditional chemistry stuff.<br/>
<br/>
For the others, what about normal kitchen measuring tools.  Little baby<br/>
medicine droppers and the like.  Sorry, haven&#39;t finished 1st cup of java and<br/>
my wits are not all together.<br/>

&gt; them and they<br/>
&gt; felt insulted by the &quot;babyness&quot; of the rods.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought that was an interesting comment. Makes it sound like they thought<br/>
it was too hard but too babyish at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of people are surprised that in the very first Miquon book you get<br/>
into things like multiplication and division of fractions. Traditional math<br/>
programs don&#39;t get into this type of stuff until much later, but using the<br/>
rods makes it seem like common sense.<br/>
<br/>
I second the opinion that the &quot;Labsheet Annotations&quot; is important to have,<br/>
although the &quot;Notes to Teachers&quot; is not as important. Using the Labsheet<br/>
Annotations not only gives you explanations of answers and other activities,<br/>
but it also has a chart that explains the code letters and numbers on the<br/>
work book pages. These codes enable you to use the system in very different<br/>
ways. You can take a standard approach and just go page by page through the<br/>
books. If your child suddenly develops a fascination with fractions, you may<br/>
decide that you want to pursue that. The codes will tell you how to skip<br/>
through the books so you can find just the sections on fractions, going from<br/>
the introductory concepts to more advanced concepts. This means you can<br/>
either go through the books page by page to focus on the level of the<br/>
materials, or you can decide to focus on concepts (adding, length, area,<br/>
volume, factoring, squaring etc)<br/>
<br/>
There are several things I like about the program. One of the first things<br/>
is the idea of using colors for the different levels instead of ranking them<br/>
by grade or age. This frustrates some people because they want to know what<br/>
grade level their child is at, but I think kids should work at their own<br/>
level and not have to endure negative pressure because the book says its<br/>
for kids younger than them. If grandma asks what level math youre doing and<br/>
the response is I finished orange and am just starting red, theres no<br/>
judgmental information there. Colors are neutral unlike grade levels or<br/>
numbers. (By the way, I think there can be just as much negative pressure if<br/>
everyone is complimenting the child for being ahead of their grade level).<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I like is the variety of approaches used. There is good use of<br/>
manipulatives and presentation of problems in a variety of ways. There are<br/>
also different strategies given for solving problems. For example, one<br/>
section on the  addition of a string of numbers shows 8+1+2+9+3=  ? The<br/>
solution is not to just get the totals, but to do it by drawing lines to<br/>
connect the numbers that add to 10 and then adding them (8+2, 1+9, 3+7).<br/>
Kids too often memorize multiplication tables and learn how to get correct<br/>
answers but dont really understand what they are doing. Math is usually<br/>
taught as if there is only one right answer and only one right way to get<br/>
it. But that is not true. At a recent support group meeting, most people<br/>
said that 3x9=27, and they just knew it from memorizing the multiplication<br/>
tables. I was one of two people that said they rounded the 9 up to 10 and<br/>
thought of the problem as 30-3.<br/>
<br/>
I also like that the program is fairly inexpensive. If you find it doesnt<br/>
work for your child, you dont feel the urge to force them to use it to get<br/>
your moneys worth. If it works very well and your child wants to move more<br/>
rapidly, you dont have to feel like holding them back because the next book<br/>
is so expensive. Although the program is designed for grades 1 through 3,<br/>
many people use it for 1 through 6 as you are basically at a pre-algebra<br/>
level when you complete the program.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line is that I think most programs teach you to do math, while this<br/>
one puts more emphasis on understanding it on several levels. You see<br/>
different strategies for solving problems, you do hands on activities that<br/>
are fun, and you apply what you learn to different situations. Rote<br/>
memorization may be good for tests where there is a time limit and you have<br/>
to answer quickly, but understanding concepts will help you solve more<br/>
problems in the long run (especially later in life after you forget all<br/>
those equations that you so diligently memorized for a test).<br/>
<br/>
If you made it this far and are interested in more information or a place<br/>
where you can get the entire set of Miquon books for under $50, go to the<br/>

LOL that&#39;s what I thought...... but they didn&#39;t like the math and I thought <br/>
it was because it moved to quickly for them. They didn&#39;t understand the <br/>
concept before it moved onto another. They hated the rods for the reasons I <br/>
stated above. Just stating what happened with Miquon Math at my home.<br/>

&gt; hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; rene&#39; told me he couldn&#39;t understand science (chemistry is his present<br/>
&gt; fascination) until he learned math  so we were looking into getting<br/>
&gt; cuisenaire rods & miquon math and would be interested in the opinions of<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We LOVE the Miquon/Cuisinaire rods. <br/>
The trick is to make sure you get the teachers Lab Sheets Annotations<br/>
book and the Notes to Teachers...it is essential.<br/>
They state right in the *teacher books* that the children are to learn<br/>
at their own pace with absolutely no pushing. A suggested pace is two<br/>
worksheets a day. Some of these sheets can be done in two minutes each<br/>
others are way more involved. It is worth working through the K/gr 1<br/>
book even ifyour child is say in gr 2. It gives them a chance to get<br/>
used to how the rods work. Later in the more involved books they are<br/>
used to explain fractions etc.<br/>
I like the series because they introduce complicated subjects in their<br/>
most simplistic form so when the kids hit something like geometry or<br/>
algebra in later years they are familiar with the concepts and aren&#39;t<br/>
panicked by them.<br/>
<br/>
Example...even in the lowest grade books they introduce the concepts of<br/>
*sets* and algebra; A=2, B=3, C=5 so given that key at the top of the<br/>
page the kids are asked to find out what A+B= or C+A= then A+B+C=?.<br/>
They intoduce negetive numbers in an extremely easy to understand<br/>
fashion....my oldest was in gr 8 in PS went through her brother&#39;s books<br/>
casualy and had a look and went &quot;DUH! now I get it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
They emphasize not pushing and the Lab Sheet Annotation books suggest<br/>
other activities to reinforce conepts that a child is having difficulty<br/>
getting. They even suggest skipping over sections that aren&#39;t being<br/>
understood and going back to them at a later date and letting those who<br/>
are understanding a concept well, skip ahead to those relative sections<br/>
in the following books.<br/>
All the sheets are consumable and are tear outs. If your child is really<br/>
getting to understand a concept well you can go to those related pages<br/>
through out all the books, tear them out and make up a booklet for them<br/>
in just that concept.<br/>
What passes for drill work in these books is innocuous.<br/>
<br/>
Buzz....who wishes the Miquon went past the gr 3/4 range.<br/>
