<div id="ygrps-yiv-302256397">&lt;&lt; My children are children of God, and joint heirs with Christ. I think you<br/>
have an awesome idea. You are not saying to worship our children but to have<br/>
the heart to treat our children with love, respect and compassion as<br/>
extermely valuable human beings. Am I correct? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 18:1-6<br/>
<br/>
[1] At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is the <br/>
greatest in the kingdom of heaven?<br/>
[2] And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of <br/>
them,<br/>
[3] And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as <br/>
little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.<br/>
[4] Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same <br/>
is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<br/>
[5] And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me.<br/>
[6] But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it <br/>
were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he <br/>
were drowned in the depth of the sea.<br/>
<br/>
                             (see Mark 9 and Luke 17 for similar quotes)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Matthew 25: 35-40<br/>
[35] For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me <br/>
drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:<br/>
[36] Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in <br/>
prison, and ye came unto me.<br/>
[37] Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an <br/>
hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?<br/>
[38] When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed <br/>
thee?<br/>
[39] Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?<br/>
[40] And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, <br/>
Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye <br/>
have done it unto me.<br/>
