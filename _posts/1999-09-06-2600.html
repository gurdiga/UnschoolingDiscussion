 (the young woman never reads fiction.. only nonfiction)<br/>
<br/>
I remember going through a phase like this myself - when my older kids were<br/>
little - I felt like I only had a limited amt of time for reading and so I<br/>
should (don&#39;t ya&#39; love that word &quot;should&quot;) be reading something worthwhile.<br/>
Before long I was either reading Parenting books or True Crime - and<br/>
enjoying the True Crimes way to much!  I eventually decided to return to<br/>
fiction, because at least when I would read about serial killers I didn&#39;t<br/>
have to ponder that they were still out there somewhere waiting to be<br/>
paroled!  (I still try to stay away from those books because I was really<br/>
becoming obsessed with the dark side of human nature.)<br/>
<br/>
Does your daughter think in &quot;shoulds&quot; or does she just prefer real things?<br/>
Has she always preferred nofiction?<br/>
<br/>
My boys prefer real things - they just never could get into raccoons wearing<br/>
vests or squirrels in shoes!  (That is until older ds started reading<br/>
&quot;Redwall&quot;.) The non-fiction-easy-reader-type materials have really improved<br/>
in the past 10 years.<br/>
