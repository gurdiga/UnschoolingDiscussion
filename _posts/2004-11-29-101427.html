<div id="ygrps-yiv-155039094">******************************<br/>
I went to a cool, hippy college where everyone designs their own course of  <br/>
learning (Hampshire College in western MA). It was one of the things that led <br/>
me  to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 Lots of other students there at the time <br/>
had  been homeschooled or went to alternative schools. <br/>

******************************<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in the area and have always remembered an incident while riding on one of the 5 College Buses:<br/>
<br/>
A woman was boarding the bus through the rear door and tripped up the steps.  My initial reaction (at 16 or however old I was) was to laugh--that&#39;s just what you did if someone fell at school or dropped their books or whatever--that&#39;s what *everyone* did.  Oy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, another young woman who had gotten on at Hampshire (very hippy-ish, &quot;typical&quot; Hampshire student &lt;g&gt;) immediately jumped forward and extended her hand to the woman, asking, &quot;Are you OK?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It was such a small act of kindness and it hit me *really* hard--made me ashamed for my feelings at the time and was such a clear lesson in what to do if someone is hurt or embarrassed in public.  It also made me realize how cruel my public school peers were and how cruel I had become.  <br/>
<br/>
That woman was such a good example to me--I&#39;ve never forgotten her.  I didn&#39;t know that many of the students at Hampshire were homeschooled, and maybe that young woman wasn&#39;t one of them, but it strikes me that that sort of behavior might be more common among kids who&#39;ve avoided the dog-eat-dog mentality of public school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for letting me reminisce.<br/>
