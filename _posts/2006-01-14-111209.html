&gt; So you were privately flamed by someone too cowardly to  put their insulting<br/>
&gt; views here, and back them up with sane argument and  real experiences.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not here but rather NEU where they began posting the past three months.  They <br/>
will not post some things publicly, they post attacks on their lists  (they <br/>
have changed a couple times to shake a few of us off) or gossip at their  <br/>
weekly meet. They will not answer questions when asked how a teen can be an  <br/>
unschooler when in highschool.. They just pretend I am not posting.. It  really <br/>
sours a list so I stopped until someone else began recommending  tutors for 7 year <br/>
olds....<br/>
<br/>
The email was a FWD from a friend who is on their list mixed with  some <br/>
events this past week. I was more than flamed I was threatened by the group  owners <br/>
husband (who I have met) when I asked that they NOT use my group  name AND in <br/>
an attempt to shut me up they threatened to silence my  hostility. <br/>
(Questioning their false statements about unschooling).  In the  end to really push my <br/>
buttons they threatened and bought up the extensions of my  group name. They <br/>
now have a site up with the same name as mine Southern Maine  Unschoolers but <br/>
they are using .net.  I did put an FYI out there to let  them know that <br/>
cyberhopping is illegal but....I doubt they care. I was  pretty mad about it the other <br/>
day but some pretty neat people helped to guide me  to be more productive and <br/>
try to deal with it in a kinder gentler  way. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sorry you were targeted like that. Getting information and  opinions<br/>
&gt; about Unschooling from people who are hostile to the concepts  is a little<br/>
&gt; like asking for a description of the philosophies and  practices of Wicca<br/>
&gt; from Jerry Falwell. The results are likely to  somewhat skewed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, Well I am a former member of that group so I know a bit more than they  <br/>
would like.. I am probably guilty of being a bit to blunt in my  skew also:). <br/>
I could care less what they do so long as they don&#39;t push the  BS on a list I <br/>
am on and think I am not going to correct it.<br/>
 <br/>
Thank you for adding some humor I need it..<br/>

Talking about unschooling in a philosophical way is great for this list.<br/>
Telling local political stories is Right Out.<br/>
<br/>
I know there will be a few posts maybe trickle in, but please put the  <br/>
brakes on as fast as possible.  This is no good.<br/>

If I were you, I&#39;d put on my site that you are in no way affiliated with  the <br/>
.net site.  Put it on a back page with a cryptic link on your front  page.  <br/>
Pull up the registration information for both sites and copy them on  your page <br/>
showing that you were there first.  Write something magnaminous  to go with <br/>
it.<br/>
 <br/>
Then put a link in all your postings to the lists.  ;)<br/>
