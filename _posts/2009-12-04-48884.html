<div id="ygrps-yiv-982464348">my son (11) just came in and shared with me a news item he read online, saying that the royal navy was concerned that the sailors offshore for long stints would not keep up intellectually and with news, etc., and so they have apparently issued PSPs to the sailors, equipped with newsfeeds and other information.  apparently the sailors ARE allowed to play games on them, because the royal navy presumed that allowing them to do so would inspire them to take better care of the PSPs.  <br/>
<br/>
such an unschooly story on so many levels - including my son browsing the news articles in the video games section of yahoo (he is now exploring the net worth of different video game franchises), and video game access enhancing the lives of sailors, etc.  thought that was quite interesting!<br/>
