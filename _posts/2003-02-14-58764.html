&lt;&lt; I also, have a child with special needs, and with your education, I <br/>
expected <br/>
<br/>
much more from you. And no, its not always gentic or learned by modeling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Its very apparent that You have absolutely no clue of parenting a child <br/>
with <br/>
<br/>
special needs, much less commenting in regards to it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago someone clearly misinterpreted something I wrote in another <br/>
place.  Plainly just didn&#39;t read carefully.   When called on that, she said <br/>
she had read it twice.  When it was quoted back and pointed out as her <br/>
misinterpretation, rather than saying &quot;Sorry--I misunderstood,&quot; a bizarre <br/>
defense was employed.  She said she had been on the dean&#39;s list, had a 4.0 in <br/>
college, and so COULD read very well.  <br/>
<br/>
She could have a PhD in remedial reading or philosophy or law, and if she <br/>
misread a post about unschooling she STILL misread the post.  Reading <br/>
comprehension is internal, and whether someone can do it or not has zip to do <br/>
with their formal education.<br/>
<br/>
In the e-mail quoted above, a put-down was couched in such terms:<br/>
-=- with your education, I expected <br/>
<br/>
much more from you-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some of the wisest and most effective unschooling moms I know don&#39;t have a <br/>
college degree.  Some didn&#39;t finish high school.  Some of the most clue-free <br/>
and oppressive parents I know have advanced degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers, of ALL people, need to work to rid themselves of attachment to <br/>
formal education and the papers that come with that.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- with your education, I expected much more from you-=-<br/>
<br/>
Like what?<br/>
Expected me to revert to what I was taught about learning disabilities when I <br/>
was taking psychology and education classes in the 1970&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
Those experts didn&#39;t know anything about unschooling.  They were talking <br/>
about how teachers in schools can deal with disabilities.  And the answer was <br/>
basically &quot;not very well.&quot;   But they WERE saying that in the open classroom <br/>
model, kids of different skill and ability levels could share a classroom <br/>
because it wouldn&#39;t be cooperative and individualized rather than competitive!<br/>
<br/>
What special education teachers try (unsuccessfully) to do sometimes is to <br/>
simulate home conditions more than regular school does.  They deal with <br/>
repetition, life skills, alternative exercises to what regular kids are doing <br/>
in sit-down classrooms down the hall, and above all they try to have only a <br/>
few children to each adult.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling does all that, and does it better.<br/>
Unschooling keeps kids from having to be labelled different, disabled, and <br/>
&quot;special&quot;<br/>
   (in a way that is not good-special, but just DIFFERENT special, <br/>
     and all the other kids know that)<br/>
Unschooling allows for kids to learn in fits and starts, instead of trying to <br/>
maintain or fake the smooth curve that schools&#39; units and sessions and <br/>
semesters and report cards and IEPs need.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s equally advantageous to ALL children.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&quot;Special needs&quot; can be and sometimes is used an excuse for a parent to say<br/>
<br/>
sullenly and determinedly, &quot;No, that won&#39;t work here.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen it happen lots.  And it looks like Teresa&#39;s defense against <br/>
unschooling is that her kids have special problems and so it&#39;s not going to <br/>
work.  The long post about breaking video controllers and doors started off <br/>
defensively.  She pretty much declared that answers other than Mary&#39;s and <br/>
Anne&#39;s were going to be condescending criticism she could ignore.  It seemed <br/>
to me to be saying that the advice from this list was ruining her family, and <br/>
was obviously NOT working.  <br/>
<br/>
Yet the projection continued with insults that there are people here who <br/>
follow advice blindly.<br/>
<br/>
Doing something recommended here without understanding WHY and without <br/>
changing one&#39;s own thought, attitude and expectations won&#39;t help much.  Doing <br/>
something for two weeks and declaring it a failure doesn&#39;t show much <br/>
dedication to change either.  It sounds more like justification for reverting <br/>
to the old behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
If a family is happy with the way things are going, then they&#39;re happy!<br/>
<br/>
If a family is unhappy and wants to learn more about how some  unschooling fa<br/>
milies have moved from a similarly unhappy state to a relaxed and &quot;together&quot; <br/>
family life, this list can furnish them LOTS of ideas and examples. <br/>
<br/>
I do not personally consider &quot;ADD&quot; or &quot;ADHD&quot; to be disabilities.  And even in <br/>
an extreme case of a set of those symptoms, saying unschooling won&#39;t work is <br/>
a massive cop-out.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t want to unschool, they shouldn&#39;t unschool.  They shouldn&#39;t <br/>
blame a child who&#39;s already been labelled defective and deficient for THEIR <br/>
failure to understand helping kids to learn in their own way where they are <br/>
today, right now.<br/>
<br/>
The symptoms of ADD are present in such a large percentage of people that <br/>
it&#39;s ludicrous to consider it &quot;special needs.&quot;  In school, because school <br/>
doesn&#39;t allow for individualization, that set of behaviors called ADHD is <br/>
problematical FOR THE SCHOOL.  For the teacher.  For the system.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling removes those strictures and barriers.  <br/>
When the barrier&#39;s gone, barrier-deficiency is not a factor.<br/>
<br/>
So I myself think it&#39;s a waste of unschooling time for us to encourage people <br/>
to think that &quot;ADHD kids&quot; can&#39;t learn on their own as other kids can.  Let us <br/>
be real:  they can probably do it BETTER.  So I have no interest in the <br/>
sighing of a mother who wants people here to say &quot;There, there, of COURSE you <br/>
can&#39;t unschool because youre children have disABILITIES.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t quit learning after I quit going to school.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=- with your education, I expected much more from you-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
That was an insult that revealed more of the prejudice of the writer than <br/>
anything else.<br/>
<br/>
I expect no less of myself than to give the most helpful and honest advice I <br/>
can give when people need it.  If we, this list and unschoolers, are going to <br/>
be blamed because one family can&#39;t understand unschooling and make it work, <br/>
it&#39;s worth pointing out that the behavior of children is sometimes genetic.  <br/>
I see it in my kids, and I see it in other people&#39;s kids, and people here <br/>
tell stories frequently of seeing their own childhood situations (peeing <br/>
beds, food preferences, fears, whatever) in their children.  I see people <br/>
talk about traits of bio parents in their adopted children.<br/>
<br/>
I expect no less of myself than to care more about the feelings and happiness <br/>
of children than about the personal comfort levels of their resistant mothers.<br/>
<br/>
And I DO expect unschoolers to try to dismantle their remaining prejudices <br/>
regarding formal education.  I&#39;m about to have three adults leave my house, <br/>
perhaps with no formal education whatsoever.  Perhaps with &quot;some college.&quot;  <br/>
Perhaps as lawyers or doctors.  Whatever it is, I HOPE I will have learned <br/>
enough not to value the kid with a college report card over one who chose to <br/>
put their money and energy into formal education.    Either way will be their <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
My children will choose college or not the way they choose TV or not, candy <br/>
or not, to sleep early or late, to set an alarm or to sleep, whether to play <br/>
video games or not.  And because they have practice making good decisions, <br/>
they will not make them spuriously or lightly or ignorantly.  They won&#39;t go <br/>
to college to make me happy.  They won&#39;t get into debt over their heads just <br/>
to please a grandmother who&#39;ll be dead before the debt&#39;s gone.  And IF they <br/>
go to college, nobody there will suspect they learned to read on their own <br/>
from gaming magazines and card games.   And IF they go to college, nobody <br/>
will say to them -=- with your education, I expected <br/>
<br/>
much more from you-=-.<br/>

defensive yourself.   If something is &quot;ruining my life&quot; I aint gonna keep <br/>
doing it.   Where are you getting your perceptions that unschooling is <br/>
ruining my life??  GOD, you think my life is bad now??.. you should have read <br/>
about it when they were in school.. Geez, this is a lot better.. but, still <br/>
not as good as it could be.   I&#39;m just trying to do the best I can.<br/>

that unschooling is not working for me?   We still have challanges, <br/>
difficulties, and we are learning how to do &quot;this&quot; everyday.. but we&#39;re <br/>
trying..  I&#39;ve not blamed my child once for my misunderstandings.    When <br/>
have I done that?  You seem to think I am  trying to discount unschooling.. <br/>
thats not the case at all.. Im trying to learn how it works for MY family.  <br/>
