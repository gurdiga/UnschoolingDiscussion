For a fifteen year old boy, it depends partly how invested he was in  <br/>
school, and how much he believes it&#39;s &quot;the only way.&quot;  If he liked  <br/>
school and is an academic type, maybe see if you can get him in a few  <br/>
community college classes (not necessarily academic ones, and not  <br/>
necessarily for credit) so that he doesn&#39;t feel lost.   By the time  <br/>
he&#39;s recovered from school, he would have been old enough to graduate  <br/>
(or drop out).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Benefit&quot; is an absolute thing.  You could have a better next hour of  <br/>
your life if you relaxed and found happy things to do together.  That  <br/>
would be a benefit.<br/>
<br/>
Is it too late for him to have all the benefits of someone who was  <br/>
unschooled always?  Yes.<br/>
Is it too late for him to have the benefits of a peaceful year or two  <br/>
at home without school pressures?  No, it&#39;s not too late.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If either of them reads lots, maybe get magazine subscriptions to  <br/>
things they&#39;re interested in, or bring more books in.  If they&#39;re not  <br/>
readers, don&#39;t push books.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you like movies, that can be a way to schedule and focus  <br/>
without being schooly.<br/>

<br/>
For the thirteen year old it will be easier.  Give him a big  <br/>
vacation, until next August (say, at first).  Probably by then you&#39;ll  <br/>
just be so much in the stream of unschooling that there will be no  <br/>
difference between August and September, because that&#39;s the eight  <br/>
months he&#39;ll need to deschool himself.  ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/">http://sandradodd.com/</a> <br/>
deschooling )<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But...<br/>
Every time you-the-mom chicken out and make assignments or push  <br/>
schooliness, you&#39;ll be back at square one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My sister took her son out of school after 11th grade - so he&#39;d have  <br/>
had only one more year of high school left.<br/>
<br/>
He spent that year mostly doing theater stuff - not acting, but  <br/>
working backstage - painting sets, moving sets, etc. He had a good  <br/>
time, made new friends, relaxed a lot.<br/>
<br/>
It was a wonderful gift of a year away from high school.<br/>
<br/>
Would he have benefitted from an entire life away from school? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t diminish the value of the gift of that year. Not at  <br/>
all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1116714127">I don&#39;t think its too late.  Our oldest boys at home are 14 & 15 and I&#39;ve seen a difference in them in the short time we have been unschooling.  My youngest children will probably benefit more as we stopped the insane &quot;school at home&quot; earlier.<br/>

two of college.  It&#39;s considered generally wasteful and self- <br/>
indulgent and lazy.   I understand that in British school&#39;s it is NOT  <br/>
considered a bad thing to do that.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve talked with friends who did that, it seems they learned  <br/>
more that year than they did in four years of college.<br/>
<br/>
How cool for a kid to get to have a year like that without it being a  <br/>
consolation for the frustration of having finished high school!<br/>
<br/>
So that reminds me to say that if the older boy can travel at all,  <br/>
even just to stay with friends during their school breaks, that might  <br/>
be cool.  Better yet, if you (mom) and the boys can do a little  <br/>
travelling, even just single overnight trips to towns four or five  <br/>
hours off to do something interesting there (museum, theatre,  <br/>
concert) that could be a fantastic bonding and recovery thing.<br/>
