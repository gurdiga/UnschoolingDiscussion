I find that one box and 3 cats (with one<br/>
on the way) does make it a bit more in need of care then none at all, but<br/>
still well worth it.<br/>

I just couldn&#39;t help mentioning that when I changed my three cats (and <br/>
one dog) over to a raw diet (as in uncooked meat, meaty bones, fish, <br/>
eggs, offal), the EXTREMELY stinky litterbox smell, whose smell had <br/>
permeated all over our apartment, dissapeared completely. They&#39;ve been <br/>
eating raw food now for 8 months with great health , and there&#39;s much <br/>
less OUTPUT and pretty much no smell.<br/>
They use most of what they eat, so less &quot;waste&quot;, and the unprocessed <br/>
grains in most commercial cat food (even so-called &quot;premium&quot; cat food) <br/>
are what makes most of the smell.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested in finding out more, there&#39;s a great Yahoo group: <br/>
