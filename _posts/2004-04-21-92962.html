&gt; Hi, Sang!  I was just curious as to what your &quot;closing&quot; says just above<br/>
&gt; your name.  I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s Gaelic, but I could be wrong.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926639711">Hi, Sang --<br/>
<br/>
I noticed you used the word &quot;superintendent&quot; in your post.  Most states <br/>
in the US have consistent rules throughout the entire state.  However, <br/>
in Massachussets, individual superintendents are allowed to set <br/>
themselves up as tin-plated dictators. &lt;g&gt;  Are you in MA?<br/>
<br/>
Because if you are, and you are just starting out, has anyone mentioned <br/>
the Live and Learn conference in August in Peabody?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I&#39;m not-I&#39;m in Ohio, actually. We do have statewide regs, but we notify <br/>
our superintendent each year, and some of them get on power trips and try to <br/>
demand more info than is required by law. From what I hear, it isn&#39;t many of <br/>
them, but the ones that are are very blatent and stubborn. The one we had up to <br/>
last year was one of these-openly and very vocally against homeschooling, but I <br/>
don&#39;t know how this new one is, yet. In fact, the old one left, he said, so <br/>
that he could go into politics and do away with the &quot;abomination&quot; of <br/>
homeschooling all together! Ohy... Thanks for the tip on the conference, though! :~)<br/>

I like to think &lt;g&gt; that there&#39;s going to be a prize for the person who <br/>
can slip it into conversation the most times.  It&#39;s fun AND <br/>
life-changing, so I figure it&#39;s always relevant on this list.<br/>

I&#39;m on the opposite coast, so I get my jollies from encouraging other <br/>

lately, and I wanted to double-check and make sure I remember correctly before I <br/>

<br/>
It is Celtic Gaelic and it means Peace on Earth. I know, sorta sappy, but its <br/>
a nice sentiment and I like to think it makes a bit of difference if I spread <br/>
it around ;~) Thanks for asking!<br/>
