 Or is this all normal<br/>
&gt; behavior for a boy?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me like it&#39;s normal behavior for a four year old. I&#39;ve got a 4 yog<br/>
who gets into mischief too.<br/>

&lt;&lt;It&#39;s really strange, he is really such a sweet child most of the time but<br/>
there are times (weeks in between thank goodness), without warning that a<br/>
switch flips & he&#39;s a nightmare.  Most of these times he&#39;ll start screaming<br/>
& you can&#39;t communicate with him at all.  Then the experience ends without<br/>
any causal connection & it&#39;s like it never happened.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi,<br/>
<br/>
All I can suggest is that you keep looking hard for a causal factor.  It may <br/>
take long-term observation.  Some food allergies can really make kids lose <br/>
control.  Otherwise, maybe an extreme sensitivity to texture, light, or <br/>
sound?  I think it&#39;s helpful to get a notebook and write down details of each <br/>
incident.  Maybe make a chart that shows how often problems occur and at what <br/>
time of day?<br/>
<br/>
If if would make you feel more empowered to be able to &quot;do&quot; something, then <br/>
pro-actively following a Feingold diet, or a food elimination plan, or just <br/>
buying healthfood with fewer additives for awhile might be worthwhile.<br/>
<br/>
In younger kids, tantrums are a fairly normal response to the &quot;last straw&quot; of <br/>
stress.  It could just be that.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  Betsy</div>

 </span></blockquote>If you promise not to tell anyone, I&#39;ll tell you a secret. *I* was this<br/>
child.  Might still be, but at 40 I&#39;m much better at hiding it.  Not only<br/>
did I survive, I&#39;m thriving. My parents, sorry to say, are<br/>
institutionalized. One choose  religion and ther other chose the mental<br/>
health care system.  You can&#39;t believe half the stories they tell though.<br/>
They get everything wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I also gave birth to your child&#39;s sister. At 3 she took the scissors to her<br/>
hair not once, not twice, but 3 seperate times!  My dh ended all of that by<br/>
taking  her to the barber when he took our boys. Unbeknownst to me he<br/>
decided she needed a buzz cut, and so she got one.  You should have seen the<br/>
4 of them with their skinned eggheads.  Everyone thought she must have had<br/>
some awful health problem, like a brain tumor or something, since all of her<br/>
hair was gone.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe...breathe so deeply you almost hyperventilate.  When I get back form<br/>
karate I&#39;ll tell you some more stories.  &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>

Thank you for your story.  I&#39;m beginning to feel more normal with each note<br/>
I receive.  Thinking back I think I was into similar stuff as a child.  I<br/>
guess I&#39;d forgotten.</div>
