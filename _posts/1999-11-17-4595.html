I remember several news stories from years past ...  One where a 9 <br/>
y/o and an 11 y/o pushed a 7 y/o out of a 5th story window <br/>
because he wouldn&#39;t steal for them.<br/>
<br/>
The story of a 10 y/o who murdered for his gang (so he wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
charged as an adult) and was himself murdered by a 9 y/o as <br/>
retribution.<br/>

I know for a fact that prisons no longer rehabilitate.  The prisons are <br/>
soft and cushy and prisoners are given all their rights.  The victims, <br/>
apparently have no rights, or their rights take second seat to the <br/>
rights of the poor prisoner.<br/>
<br/>
You can overhaul the system and look at each case individually.  <br/>
Bring in shrinks by the busload.  Look at the perps and ask <br/>
yourself &quot;Is this 9 y/o going to kill again?&quot;.  Maybe put him in <br/>
therapy.  Maybe medication.  Spend millions trying to make him a <br/>
productive member of society.  IMHO it won&#39;t work.  Not once he <br/>
sees that prison life is so much better than home life.  Cable TV, <br/>
health clubs, free education, the works.<br/>
<br/>
Todays prison system is a shame.  If you can&#39;t do the time, don&#39;t <br/>
do the time.  Heck, with prisons the way they are today the time <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814510223">With all due respect I think you are very confused on the issue.  The<br/>
history of punishment is clear.  It is an abysmal failure.  Most people in<br/>
prison have already had massive punishment in their lives.  The vast<br/>
majority of violent offenders had corporal punishment has a major feature of<br/>
their growing up.  Violence begets violence.  I suggest the article &quot;The<br/>
Fear of Being Permissive&quot; archived at Naturalchild.com.<br/>
<br/>
Of course prisons don&#39;t rehabilitate.  They have rarely ever been intended<br/>
to rehabilitate.  There is lip service paid to the concept but vengeance and<br/>
punishment rule supreme.  They continue to be as ineffective as they have<br/>
always been.  The only punishments that ever have worked are those which<br/>
stem from the persons connection with a community.<br/>
<br/>
The real culprit is the mystification about cause and effect.  Children<br/>
behave how they are treated. Barring massive neurological damage this is the<br/>
explanation for most human behaviour.  People continue to want to deny this<br/>
but when you dig deep you will find the roots of behaviour in how people are<br/>
treated.  Alice Miller has extensively written and explored this concept and<br/>
I see clearly the connection in my work as a nurse on an on-going basis.<br/>
<br/>
People&#39;s rage and powerlessness in the face of what they see clouds their<br/>
thinking.  People continue to blame victims.  What kind of society is it<br/>
that can say their prisons are better than the lives people have outside<br/>
prison.  You of course are absolutely right.... some people&#39;s lives are<br/>
better in prison than outside.  What does this mean.  It means that the<br/>
society has failed to create a community which includes large numbers of<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
The real questions continue to be around issues of power and distribution of<br/>
wealth.  The extreme rich continue to take a larger and larger percentage of<br/>
all income.  The distribution of wealth is a fundamental factor in this<br/>
discussion.  Prisons are part of an ideological machine along with media,<br/>
medicine, schools and church which enforce a world vision which destroys the<br/>
lives of millions and then lies about it and says we live in the best of all<br/>
possible worlds.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is one of the holes in the system.  It represents a hope for<br/>
change.  When people are deschooled, deeducated, they have a chance of<br/>
seeing what is before them through lenses which are not so clouded with the<br/>
dominant vision of life. It empowers and frees.<br/>

<h4>Joel Hawthorne</h4>
<p><small><time>18 Nov 1999, at  9:08am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876181463">In a small, (both geographically and culturally homogenous society it is<br/>
possible to have draconian responses to &quot;criminal&quot; activity.  I am sure that<br/>
the social stigma associated with offending behaviour is as much of a<br/>
significant deterrent than the violent nature of the punishment.  In addition<br/>
you need to look at what you don&#39;t have in such societies such little items as<br/>
freedom, self-determination, individual liberty, economic equity and any<br/>
non-conformity.  Order at any cost.<br/>
<br/>
In some communities wherein you have a communal distribution of resources and a<br/>
kinship network there was little crime not because there was not tolerance for<br/>
it but because the causative factors of aberrant, antisocial behaviour were not<br/>
there.  Banishment from those communities was the ultimate sanction.  Being cut<br/>
off from the loving network of the &quot;people&quot; provided any deterrent that was<br/>
needed.  People in those communities had complete investment in the values of<br/>
those communities.<br/>
<br/>
In addition there have been very orderly societies with low &quot;crime&quot; rates which<br/>
have pursued hideous, violent, war filled courses of action against their<br/>
neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &quot;whole cloth&quot; of allegations of abuse. There is outside<br/>
corroboration of many instances of abuse.  One doesn&#39;t have to just take the<br/>
word of someone making the allegation.<br/>
<br/>
As for corporal punishment, what can one say?  Human history is a tapestry of<br/>
violence, inequity, atrocity, exploitation, mixed in with nobility and<br/>
accomplishment.  Some of those accomplishments ultimately do not seem like<br/>
positive developments in retrospect.  The refusal and reluctance of people to<br/>
look and think critically at the behaviour of their own parents has more to do<br/>
with people&#39;s views on this subject than anything else.<br/>
<br/>
When examining the behaviour of normal, good people one needs to look at the<br/>
long litany of massively criminal behaviour of whole groups of people.  The<br/>
Nazis experience could not be that easily discounted and it is really only the<br/>
most glaring and well publicized example of mass horror by &quot;good normal&quot;<br/>
people. The inhumanity of people towards other people is a salient feature of<br/>
human history.<br/>
<br/>
Trotting out the aberrant psychopath as an example is always tantalizing.  Of<br/>
course there could be the debate as to just how normal this lovely home really<br/>
was. &quot;lovely&quot; homes, and &quot;love&quot; from parents are really topics worthy of very<br/>
careful examination.  Normal values leave much to be desired.  &quot;Loving&quot;  normal<br/>
parents regularly abuse their children out of ignorance of developmental<br/>
&quot;norms&quot;.  Normal people hit their children and call it love.  To be angry and<br/>
punish a toddler for trying to explore the world, following an absolute<br/>
developmental imperative hard wired into the brain is a twisted abuse but<br/>
happens regularly. This is from parents who do love their children and have the<br/>
very best of intentions.<br/>
<br/>
The contract killer&#39;s normal home life needs to be viewed by people who are<br/>
able to see the corruption of many normal practices.  It is so facile to<br/>
explain away horrifying behaviour by simple &quot;volition&quot;.  A contract killer does<br/>
not kill simply because &quot;it was easy and he was good at it and only had to work<br/>
a couple of days a year.&quot;  He lacked a conscience.  How did that happen?  Do<br/>
you care how that happened?  Is it preventable?  It is something engendered by<br/>
the conditions of his life?  Is it a defective neurological apparatus?  The<br/>
questions are there.  Your imo simplistic explanation doesn&#39;t address them.<br/>
<br/>
It would be tidy and much less anxiety producing if human behaviour were just a<br/>
simple question of volition.  It isn&#39;t.  Reluctance to look at the intricate,<br/>
paradox filled, frightening reality doesn&#39;t make it go away.<br/>
<br/>
There is a large body of research on prison populations which leads clearly, in<br/>
an epidemiological fashion to the conclusion that violence in childhood is<br/>
common denominator in that population.  Violence greater than the norm.  Not<br/>
all prisoners.  Just as people subjected to violence in childhood do not all<br/>
offend.  There is a direct correlation between the nature of a person&#39;s family<br/>
and that persons behaviour.  It is predictive on a large scale. There are<br/>
trends which can be seen.<br/>
<br/>
As for excuses.  None of the horror in any individual&#39;s life is an excuse for<br/>
misbehaviour and offending against others.  It may provide explanations for a<br/>
person&#39;s propensity to behave in a given way, it may provide an obstacle to be<br/>
overcome but it is never an excuse.  People choose to do what they do and must<br/>
be held accountable. That accountability must be in the context of community if<br/>
it is to be meaningful.  Punishment does not suffice.  The punishing aspects of<br/>
accountability must be secondary and coincidental if you want the person in<br/>
question to be truly accountable.<br/>
<br/>
I think we disagree immensely.<br/>
<br/>
I think the discussion is worthwhile.  I think you are mistaken as you must<br/>
think I am.  I appreciate your engaging in the discussion nonetheless.<br/>

&lt;&lt;   Not once he <br/>
 sees that prison life is so much better than home life.  Cable TV, <br/>
 health clubs, free education, the works. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I know this is a popular conception of prison life but it leaves out a <br/>
few of the harsher realities, two major ones being beatings by other <br/>
prisoners or sometimes guards and rapes.  Should these also be the <br/>
punishment?  This is the reality of our justice system.  If any of us think <br/>
about any of our own children or ourselves for that matter, being sent to <br/>
prison, I believe THOSE things are the fears that scare us most.<br/>
    Also, if a child&#39;s life in prison really is so much better than his home <br/>
life, isn&#39;t part of the answer to see what can be done to change the home <br/>
life?  I haven&#39;t met a kid yet who would rather be in prison for the cable TV <br/>
or the &quot;health clubs.&quot; <br/>
    I believe the U.S. responds too emotionally to these issues and doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to look at what it would take to truly solve the problems.  I guess <br/>
that&#39;s why we have such a huge percentage of our people locked up.  <br/>
    I am just as capable as anyone else of responding with anger and a desire <br/>
for revenge when I hear about horrible things done to people.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
what I would really do if someone hurt or killed someone I love.  I know <br/>
there is a part of me that would probably want to kill the person myself.  <br/>
Yet our current laws do not allow that as much as we all might feel that way <br/>
to some extent because we recognize that it would make our society more <br/>
violent, not less violent.  In the same way, I believe that many of the <br/>
&quot;solutions&quot; the U.S. has now also make our society more violent.  <br/>
    Here is another thing I think about a lot:  people talk so much about how <br/>
these kids should be made to take responsibility for what they do wrong.  But <br/>
these kids didn&#39;t just land here from outer space.  When is our sick society <br/>
going to take responsibility for creating an environment which produces the <br/>
kids they&#39;re complaining so much about?   The previous generations, for all <br/>
of their own problems and injustices, did not have kids who did these kinds <br/>
of things.  <br/>
    Some like to believe that it&#39;s because they beat their kids more and <br/>
&quot;didn&#39;t put up with this nonsense.&quot;  However, I remember my own grandmothers <br/>
and neither one were harsh at all.  They were very loving, warm people who <br/>
were always willing to talk, to enjoy kids, to help others, to extend mercy, <br/>
to help their kids with prolblems that the kids didn&#39;t know how to solve.<br/>
    Too many kids today are left in situations which they have no IDEA how to <br/>
solve.  Sure, there are some who do well DESPITE their horrible childhoods.  <br/>
But don&#39;t we want to create an environment in which the tendency is to do <br/>
well rather than have it be the exception?  Whenever I read about things like <br/>
the young boys who pushed the younger boy out of the window because he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t steal for them, the thing comes to my mind is how strange it is that <br/>
just a few years back when I was living in...wherever....or doing...whatever <br/>
it was...these kids were just little boys and I wonder what in the world <br/>
happened to make them become this way.  If we don&#39;t start figuring out the <br/>
answers to that, we won&#39;t ever solve the problem.<br/>

Reminds me just recently my 19yro son somehow agreed to buy almost $500 worth <br/>
of magazines over the phone. Even gave them his credit card #, they told him <br/>
it was a contest, and it was, your name was entered in some drawing every <br/>
time you paid the bill. I did mange to get this canceled but my son really <br/>
did not understand what he was doing. Made me look at how much kids know.<br/>
    I&#39;m not using this to explain away juvenile crime, just wanted to make <br/>
the point that sometimes we take even common sense for granted. After this <br/>
happened I had a talk with my other teenagers. I now try to take nothing for <br/>
granted.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554413221">Well, sorry to be so long in answering this but it would appear to have<br/>
been wandering in cyber-space and only landed in ye ol&#39; e-mail box this<br/>
morning.<br/>
<br/>
Studies in prison populations are the equivalent of anthropologists<br/>
wandering around the country in the 1800&#39;s &quot;studying&quot; the &quot;savages.&quot;  Of<br/>
course, everything they learned was the absolute truth, don&#39;t you know. <br/>
Well, as one who knows without a doubt and first hand what really happened,<br/>
let me explain to you about all those studies.<br/>
<br/>
Single white male who, in the minds of those he was studying, should have<br/>
been gainfully employed bringing home the bacon to his family is instead<br/>
wandering around bumming food and lodging and sitting around all day with a<br/>
piece of paper asking questions from the elders.  And doing equally strange<br/>
things like gathering up flowers and putting them inbetween sheets of paper<br/>
and then putting them in books.  Now, to the NA mind, this person is insane<br/>
(literally) so they decide to humor him.  They tell him nice stories and<br/>
the wilder the stories the happier he is.  Well, with an insane person, you<br/>
want at all costs to keep him nice and happy because you never know what<br/>
might happen if an insane person is unhappy.  When the &quot;insane&quot; white man<br/>
leaves, they all have a good laugh about the tall tales he was so happy to<br/>
hear not knowing that he would go and publish a story saying that these<br/>
people believed things like coyote talking to them or that frogs asked a<br/>
&quot;god&quot; to make their pond larger.  You see they shared their &quot;Grimm&#39;s Fairy<br/>
Tales&quot; with these white men and it came back to bite them as being facts.<br/>
<br/>
Now, as to prison populations, been there done that.  The studies are only<br/>
part observation but mainly these cute little question and answer sessions,<br/>
sometimes with the prisoners and sometimes with staff.  Neither of which is<br/>
a very good source of information.  If they want to do an accurate study,<br/>
then gather up folks that are out of prison and don&#39;t have an ax to grind<br/>
or want an excuse to get out of their cell so think the bigger the story<br/>
the more time out they get.  They even stand around the yard and discuss<br/>
what stories to tell.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot legislate &quot;community,&quot; therefore you must have an alternative. <br/>
Reality is that you are not going to rehab the over whelming majority of<br/>
these folks and all this time<br/>
spent talking about it isn&#39;t going to make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
Also, perhaps one needs to look at a very unpopulate thought on the human<br/>
conscience and being.  33 1/3% inherited (in your genes), 33 1/3%<br/>
environment (learned behaviors, things that happen to you, school, class<br/>
mates, friends, family) and 33 1/3% is individual.  Bob (the contract<br/>
killer) was studied to death, his family was studied to death.  All the<br/>
shrinks and so forth were totally baffled.  <br/>
<br/>
And, Bob did have a conscience except when it came to his &quot;work.&quot;  It is<br/>
funny because it would be acceptable to be ruthless in your work if you<br/>
worked on Wall Street but it isn&#39;t when it comes to Bob&#39;s line of work.  If<br/>
the banker ruthlessly evicts and forecloses on families, it is &quot;just his<br/>
job&quot; because he gives to United Way, belongs to Big Brothers, Big Sisters<br/>
and is a good husband and father.  His conscience is never called into<br/>
question.  And, I gotta tell ya, the banker has destroyed far more lives<br/>
and &quot;killed&quot; more people than Bob.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, before you go off and hit the tangent road, that is not to say that<br/>
what Bob does is o.k., it is an illustration of our skewed way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Well, since we don&#39;t have economic equity in the U.S., that argument don&#39;t<br/>
fly.<br/>
<br/>
As to substanciation of abuse reports you are talking a very small<br/>
percentage!  There was a study done which was, of course, immediately deep<br/>
sixed, in which a bunch of shrinks and social workers decided that they<br/>
needed a control group to &quot;prove&quot; that their investigative methodology was<br/>
accurate.  They brought in their own children and swapped kids and did<br/>
their testing. 100% of the kids in the youngest age group tested &quot;positive&quot;<br/>
for at least 3 of 5 points indicating sexual abuse in younger children. <br/>
Why, because young children are &quot;led&quot; by non-verbal body language<br/>
&quot;coaching&quot; by adults and the &quot;need to please&quot; factor.  Also, young children<br/>
do not understand the difference between inappropriate touching and<br/>
touching of any nature.<br/>
<br/>
the bottomline is that rehab in a &quot;caring&quot; community has been tried in the<br/>
U.S. and failed miserably with a less than 3% success rate for violent<br/>
offenders.  The rehab rate on pedophiles is less than 0.5%.  All this talk<br/>
is great but do you want to take in one of these folks and rehab them???<br/>
<br/>
Discussion is great but it doesn&#39;t fix the problems.  All these folks<br/>
writing books aren&#39;t fixing the problem.  I worked with these folks both in<br/>
the prison population and at an acute psych rehab facility.  What I am<br/>
saying is not based on opinion but on facts.  I don&#39;t know what the answer<br/>
is but I do know from first hand knowledge that what is put into print as<br/>
facts is just so much pie in the sky and/or pure unadulterated piles lift<br/>
by bulls by folks that aren&#39;t out to help or fix anything other than their<br/>
own wallets!  Sells those books, hit the talk circuit, make that money not<br/>
one dime of which goes back into helping to fix the problem.<br/>
