<div id="ygrps-yiv-551100302">Isn&#39;t this incredible? I just can&#39;t help thinking of the one boy who *didn&#39;t*<br/>
sign a confession because he mother had told him if he ever got hauled in for<br/>
something he didn&#39;t do to, &quot;...let them crush his hands before he signed<br/>
anything.&quot; I guess DNA evidence has its downside as far as the entrenched<br/>
police policy is concerned.<br/>

Convictions Overturned<br/>

New York--It took the justice system 13 years and 58 pages to decide that the<br/>
five<br/>
black youths convicted of raping and beating a Central Park jogger were not<br/>
guilty of<br/>
the crime. <br/>
<br/>
Ending an 11-month long investigation of the re-opened case, Manhattan<br/>
District<br/>
Attorney Robert Morgenthau filed a 58-page report on Thursday (Dec. 5) to<br/>
State<br/>
Supreme Court asking that all charges against the men, who were teenagers when<br/>
they were tried, be set aside. The recommendation was based mainly on the<br/>
confession of Matias Reyes, who said he is solely responsible for raping the<br/>
investment banker on April 19, 1989. <br/>
<br/>
In effect, the D.A. joined the defense&#39;s motion to vacate the case on the<br/>
grounds<br/>
that new evidence, &quot;could not have been produced by the defendants at the<br/>
trial<br/>
even with due diligence...which is of such character as to create a<br/>
probability...that<br/>
the verdict would have been more favorable to the defendants,&quot; the lawyers,<br/>
Michael Warren and Roger Wareham submitted. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Assessing the newly discovered evidence, as we are required to do,&quot; District<br/>
Attorney Morgenthau&#39;s report concluded, &quot;...there is a probability that the<br/>
new<br/>
evidence, had it been available to the juries, would have resulted in verdicts<br/>
more<br/>
favorable to the defendants, not only on the charges arising from the attack<br/>
on the<br/>
female jogger, but on the other charges as well.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Moreover, the D.A. believed no useful purpose would be served by a retrial on<br/>
any of<br/>
the charges contained in the original indictment against the youths. &quot;We<br/>
always<br/>
maintained our children&#39;s innocence,&quot; said Sharrone Salaam, the mother of<br/>
Yusef<br/>
Salaam, one of the so-called Central Park Five. &quot;Now, victory is ours.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Since District Attorney Morgenthau&#39;s report is merely a recommendation, the<br/>
defendants will have to wait and to see if Judge Charles Tejada accedes to the<br/>
request in February. Ordinarily, according to several lawyers familiar with<br/>
the case,<br/>
the judge goes along with the prosecution&#39;s recommendation. <br/>
<br/>
If Judge Tejada&#39;s ruling is favorable, it may set in motion another round of<br/>
litigation<br/>
as the defendants-Yusef Salaam, Kharey Wise, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray<br/>
and<br/>
Raymond Santana (who remains in prison on different charges)--all of whom have<br/>
served prison terms from 7-1/2 to 13-1/2 years, prepare lawsuits of wrongful<br/>
conviction. <br/>
<br/>
Such lawsuits are customarily difficult in the state of New York, which<br/>
enacted a law<br/>
in 1984 requiring plaintiffs to prove in a high and convincing manner that<br/>
they are<br/>
innocent and in no way did anything to contribute to their convictions. In the<br/>
previous wrongful conviction cases-some 175 since 1985 with 163 of them being<br/>
dismissed-a false confession is tantamount to contributing to conviction, and<br/>
it was<br/>
the confessions of the youths that the prosecution based its case. However,<br/>
defense lawyers will charge, as they have done throughout the re-examination<br/>
of<br/>
the case, that the confessions extracted from four of the defendants, were<br/>
coerced.<br/>
<br/>
Were it not for an accidental meeting between Reyes, 31, who is serving a<br/>
33-to-life<br/>
sentence for another rape and murder, and Wise while incarcerated, the case<br/>
would<br/>
have never aroused the public again as it did 13 years ago. Reyes said he had<br/>
a<br/>
religious epiphany upon seeing Wise and felt compelled to confess to the<br/>
crime. His<br/>
account was corroborated by his accurate recall of information only the police<br/>
knew,<br/>
as well as DNA testing from semen taken from the victim&#39;s socks and cervic. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I just had to have her,&quot; Reyes said of the victim as she jogged through<br/>
Central Park<br/>
near the 102nd Street Transverse. He said he stalked her through the park as<br/>
she<br/>
ran, accosted her and dragged her into a ravine where he beat her with a tree<br/>
limb<br/>
and then a rock before raping her. The woman lost 75 percent of her blood and<br/>
remained in a coma for 12 days. &quot;I thought I had left her dead,&quot; he added. &quot;I<br/>
deserve<br/>
everything that has happened to me.&quot; Because the statue of limitations has<br/>
passed<br/>
Reyes cannot be tried for the crime. In the spring, the victim will be<br/>
publishing a<br/>
book about the incident and revealing her identity. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly and the NYPD are conducting their<br/>
own investigation of the incident, and they are decidedly opposed to the<br/>
D.A.&#39;s<br/>
recommendation. They are of the opinion that the youths in their &quot;wilding&quot; are<br/>
to<br/>
some degree culpable, perhaps even precipitating the attack that Reyes<br/>
finished. Dr.<br/>
Robert Kurtz, who treated the victim after the attack, contends that her<br/>
injuries<br/>
were too severe and extensive to have been committed by Reyes alone. <br/>
<br/>
During a television interview, Professor Richard Uviller of Columbia<br/>
University Law<br/>
School was asked his impressions of the case and he said the District<br/>
Attorney, from<br/>
the very beginning, &quot;should have been more detached from the NYPD. And they<br/>
should have been more suspicious,&quot; he said, mildly berating the department for<br/>
not<br/>
connecting previous rapes in Central Park to Reyes. Two days before the youths<br/>
rampaged through the park there was a rape incident, which Reyes later<br/>
confessed<br/>
he did. <br/>
<br/>
Should an apology be forthcoming from the D.A&#39;s office, the professor was<br/>
asked?<br/>
&quot;This was not a personal matter, so no apology should be expected,&quot; Professor<br/>
Uviller<br/>
answered. &quot;They were operating purely on the evidence.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
None of the defendants were among the demonstrators outside the court when the<br/>
report was announced. McCray, according to his mother, Linda, has resumed his<br/>
life<br/>
outside the city with his wife and children; Salaam is a student of computer<br/>
science<br/>
somewhere in New York; Richardson is working as a night watchman and pursuing<br/>
an<br/>
undergraduate degree; Wise, who served the longest sentence, lives with his<br/>
mother<br/>
in Manhattan; and Santana is serving time on an unrelated crime, but is<br/>
expected to<br/>
be released soon, if Judge Tejada&#39;s ruling conforms with the D.A.&#39;s request. <br/>
