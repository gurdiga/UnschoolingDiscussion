<div id="ygrps-yiv-709200828">Hi, everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Well...between sick kids and migraines we haven&#39;t done too much lately. However, toxic neighbor is about out of our lives...we spent monday and today running her around and now she has her driver&#39;s license again and her own working vehicle!! YAY!!! To celebrate tomorrow, we are going to go to an indoor play-place I just found out about earlier today during Megan&#39;s Early Intervention playtime. Or maybe we&#39;ll wait until monday because I&#39;m thinking that none of us really want to go anywhere for a couple days! We might just put on our jackets and rediscover the fact that we have a backyard LOL (the weather here has been a &quot;warm&quot; 40 lately).<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not been the easiest thing in the world, but I think posting here has helped me to honestly look at things and realize that I could really use an extra hand around once in awhile when Paul is on duty. I&#39;m relying on Sarah too much, and that&#39;s not good for either of us. So since Social Services is offering help, I&#39;m taking it. I&#39;ll have someone coming in once a week for a couple hours to play with the kids so that I can shower, or run to the grocery store, or clean something, or just go sit on the porch with a cup of tea for a minute....<br/>
 <br/>
I really haven&#39;t been taking care of myself, and that&#39;s affecting the kids...so I&#39;ve joined a local gym with childcare; bought contact lenses again and some new clothes, and overall I&#39;m just doing  better than before. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re ALL doing better than before really. We joined the local children&#39;s museum (with reciprocal memberships to other museums) and like I said before we found out that there&#39;s a local indoor playground type place we can go to. The kids like the childcare room at the gym, and between it, the children&#39;s museum, the indoor playground...and a couple local playgroups for the little ones...the cabin fever is lessening, and they&#39;re also enjoying having more things of theirs easily accesible to play. I&#39;m hardly ever on the computer anymore because I&#39;m really starting to enjoy playing with them again, which is also nice. <br/>
 <br/>
SO anyway..just wanted to check in and say hello to everyone! <br/>
 <br/>
Oh..and my purple flute came in yesterday! It&#39;s GREAT and I&#39;m having a blast with it!<br/>

Yeah!  Good for you, that will make a big difference.  It&#39;s funny <br/>
that you posted today because I was thinking that I hadn&#39;t seen your <br/>
name in a while and was wondering if everything was ok on your end.  <br/>
Good to see you again.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-60054074">thanks...as I was working on rearranging things in the house to make things easier for the kids to do things they&#39;d like to do, like bring the playdough to a drawer they can reach rather than the upper cabinet..it hit me that maybe my pride in being able to handle things on my own was actually getting in the way of doing the best thing for the family...if it doesn&#39;t work out I can always end it. It&#39;s hard though because I&#39;m trying to not be suspicious and everything..I&#39;ve heard so many stories of kids being taken for stupid stuff...but I also talked with my lawyer and he says he thinks it&#39;s a good idea to at least try and see...Paul&#39;s duty weeks are an awfully long time to be on my own with them with absolutely no relief. Not that I&#39;m totally without anyone to help me, but to a degree I am because my friend is a single mom of 4 of her own and busy with them and work...<br/>
