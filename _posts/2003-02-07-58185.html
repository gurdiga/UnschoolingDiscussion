<div id="ygrps-yiv-416766689">I would like to share my thoughts on children that entertain<br/>
PS thoughts. <br/>
<br/>
I am on my second time around homeschooling the same child.<br/>
He reached a point of wanting to go back to school, the pressure<br/>
was intense. Not only from him, but everyone else who had<br/>
reservations about homeschooling in the first place, jumped<br/>
on the band wagon and cheered him on. His mind was made up.<br/>
I let him go back, it was a new school, I had high hopes for him.<br/>
He was 12.<br/>
It was wonderful in the begining. Thats what you would call the<br/>
honeymoon period. That ended quite abrubtly.<br/>
<br/>
Because I have been through this, I know first hand that<br/>
It can be very damaging, to both of you. I would recommend<br/>
thinking things through before making any changes.<br/>
Also, keep in mind that putting them in to PS, and taking<br/>
them out, its not that easy, espcially if you are not expecting it<br/>
when the time comes.<br/>
<br/>
Be prepared for open arms from the school when the first<br/>
day comes, and then watch your back, as its going to come <br/>
back on YOU hard and fast when your child doesn&#39;t handle<br/>
the school work, or a situation the right way.<br/>
If you have had a hard time understanding unschooling, but<br/>
trying it out, I will tell you right now, that this unschooling not well<br/>
known in the PS system, and YOUR child will probably turn into<br/>
the best damn spokesperson on the subject, when asked<br/>
what was homeschool like by a teacher, or other peers!<br/>
<br/>
My Son recieved so many compliments when he first started<br/>
school, his kindness, and manners, impressed the school staff.<br/>
He went to school, nicely dressed and handsome!<br/>
As the months passed, I watched our son turn into a selfish<br/>
brat. He didn&#39;t care if his clothes were clean or dirty, or were<br/>
play clothes. Screamed if I told him to take a bath, or just<br/>
wash his hair. I had forgotten this PS side of him. I hated<br/>
the mornings with a passion. <br/>
<br/>
If you think your child has any learning disabilities, brace yourself<br/>
for and special ed. services or something called an IEP. <br/>
<br/>
I found out what had been going on at school. My son broke<br/>
down at the kitchen table one night crying and told me everything.<br/>
The damage was done. I was furious, and immediately pulled him.<br/>
<br/>
Starting a family business and making it work is hard. Having<br/>
Drew home has been a big change and has added more to my<br/>
day, I am also not used to having him around everyday. This<br/>
is a small price to pay, not many understand my commitment,<br/>
and thats ok. I used to constantly worry, about way too many<br/>
what if&#39;s when I had him home before. (I had a very long list<br/>
of anxieties!) LOL. <br/>
<br/>
God and I have alot of talks. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know everything, but I know where we have been.<br/>
