<div id="ygrps-yiv-951011935">Dallen, my 9 yo, said something in the car the other day that I thought was <br/>
wonderful.<br/>
We don&#39;t really talk about what they &quot;want to be&quot; when they &quot;grow up&quot;.  I <br/>
hate that phrase but they are sometimes asked that by well meaning people.  And <br/>
they are happy to discuss their interests. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway we were in the car and Dallen said &quot;Mom...I thought my passion was <br/>
making the perfect computer game or creating the perfect artificial intelligence <br/>
but really I believe my passion is with genetics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I loved the way he put it.  He has always been fascinated with genetics and <br/>
loves to read everything he can about it.  He collects DNA.  Like hair samples <br/>
etc and puts them in baggies and labels them as to where he got them and what <br/>
it was from etc.  He talks with people at different science centers and all.  <br/>
I just loved the way he put it.  Not &quot;when I grow up I want to work in <br/>
genetics&quot;.  It was about finding his passion.  Like he is sampling everything. And it <br/>
wasn&#39;t about time.  Like &quot;when I grow up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I guess he has heard me say a time or two that quilting is my passion.  I <br/>
love to craft but quilting is a passion.<br/>

Hi, Janis --<br/>
<br/>
I just decided to make my current quilt project smaller and I&#39;m going to <br/>
have a few dozen 2 1/2 inch squares of different colored fabric cut out <br/>
and left over.  Can I stuff them in an envelope and mail them to you? <br/>
You can fiddle around and make mistakes with them before committing $$ <br/>
to fabric.<br/>
<br/>
(You can privately email me your address if you are interested.)<br/>
