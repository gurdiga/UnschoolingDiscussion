<div id="ygrps-yiv-323633293">Hi all, I&#39;m going to SC conference this year. I had someone who was <br/>
interested in sharing a room but we called too late for a suite. The <br/>
rooms have two large beds, queen I think. Would anyone be interested <br/>
in rooming with us. I&#39;m from NC and my son is 12yo. We share a bed <br/>
comfortably but we both snore some...allergies! We will be staying <br/>
at the Holiday Inn. The room is 80-85 dollars a night; we are <br/>
staying Friday through Sunday. Email me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:cheeps4u@...">cheeps4u@...</a>  Sara</div>
