<div id="ygrps-yiv-887620550">I just wanted to thank everyone for their answers to all of my posts.  I <br/>
believe that unschooling is the best way to live.  I&#39;ve been changing how I <br/>
relate to my children, not that I was a mean and nasty mom, but I talk to <br/>
them in a way that makes them on my level, and not treated like the child.  <br/>
My children are very close in age (13 months apart), and are very close to <br/>
each other.  I&#39;ve seen how they treated each other in the past, which mimiced <br/>
how I treated them, and I didn&#39;t like it.  My children need to show lots of <br/>
love and respect for each other and they can learn that from me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever introduced myself.  I just started butting in on the <br/>
converstations.  My name is Patti.  I have a girl named Natalie and a boy <br/>
named Nicholas.  I decided when my daughter was about 2 that I was going to <br/>
homeschool my children.  My husband immediately loved the idea.  I started <br/>
reading a lot about homeschooling and went to my first conference last <br/>
summer.  I knew I wasn&#39;t going to be a &quot;traditional&quot; homeschooler because the <br/>
main reason why I wanted to homeschool was, and is, because children learn <br/>
best if they direct their own learning.  The thought of using curriculums, <br/>
tests, worksheets, etc. and have a set schedule to have my children learn was <br/>
never going to be an option, unless my children love that way of learning.  <br/>
When deciding to homeschool, I realized that I was going to have to let some <br/>
things go in order for the family to love each other, respect each other, get <br/>
a long, and live together.  I&#39;ve never been one who dictated what my children <br/>
can and cannot do in regards to playing.  I&#39;m used to the HUGE messes and <br/>
most of the time it doesn&#39;t bother me.  When I started reading about <br/>
unschooling, it made me want to learn more about it and talk to families who <br/>
live this way.  I liked what I heard and decided I want to be an unschooler.  <br/>
This board has explained it, and has taught me a lot about families and how <br/>
they should be.  I&#39;ve already noticed a change in how we relate to each <br/>
other, although it&#39;s more difficult to help my daughter and son relate to <br/>
each other in a respectful manner because they get so mad at each other.  I <br/>
think in time they&#39;ll learn to communicate with each other without yelling, <br/>
taking things away from each other, and hitting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all your help!!!<br/>

&gt;Thanks my name is Dawna my son is 20 mths and daughter 32 mths 14 mths<br/>
apart. He was 2 mths premie. I am intrested in unschooling and looking for<br/>
more info. She is very bright. Hiding things she doesn&#39;t want me to take<br/>
away or books that need to be returned to the Library. She knows her<br/>
alphabet and counts to ten. knows shapes and colors. 1+1=2. She tries to<br/>
hide what she knows from me. ? is this normal!! One for u one for me is 2.<br/>
(oops) She is telling me the shapes of things. Cant keep her occupied.<br/>
 Her brother and her get along great. She is encouraging him to talk and<br/>
walk but the fight only for my attention. Any advice on how to stop this?<br/>
What can I do to occupie them ?<br/>
What advice can you give me on raising children so close in age. How do I<br/>
make her feel like a big girl? </span></blockquote></div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am intrested in unschooling and looking for<br/>
&gt; more info.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The best information is on the message boards at Unschooling.com. The<br/>
advantage over the list is that it&#39;s arrange by topic and you can go back<br/>
and ponder old stuff. The list tends to fly by. (Though some people will put<br/>
up with that since they much prefer lists!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hiding things she doesn&#39;t want me to take<br/>
&gt; away<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you knew your husband would take something away from you for what seemed<br/>
like unimportant reasons, wouldn&#39;t you hide it too?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She tries to<br/>
&gt; hide what she knows from me. ? is this normal!!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re quizing her it might be. Do you ask her questions about things<br/>
that you already know the answer to?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but the fight only for my attention. Any advice on how to stop this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you stop feeling something just because someone doesn&#39;t like the way you<br/>
act? First step is recongnizing that their needs are real and valid and<br/>
figure out how to meet those needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What can I do to occupie them ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stop thinking in terms of occupying them as though you were stuck waiting<br/>
somewhere without stuff to do. What do they love? What are their favorite<br/>
things? What makes their eyes light up?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What advice can you give me on raising children so close in age.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Siblings Without Rivalry by Mazlich (sp?) and Farber. A *very* easy read.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do I<br/>
&gt; make her feel like a big girl?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The more you try to make her feel like a big girl, the more she&#39;s going to<br/>
feel pushed out of being the little girl that she is. Recognize that she&#39;s<br/>
still little. Recognize that she probably feels even littler because she&#39;s<br/>
been displaced from being the center of your universe. To her being little<br/>
means you get taken care of more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I liked Joyce&#39;s advice there.<br/>
<br/>
If you tell a little girl to be a bigger girl, she loses her childhood and <br/>
she has lost the joy of advancing when SHE wants to.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, it&#39;s not a smooth transition.  It will be jumpy and choppy.<br/>
<br/>
If you baby her and let her be little, she will WANT to be bigger sooner than <br/>
if you just press for &quot;bigness,&quot; I think.<br/>
