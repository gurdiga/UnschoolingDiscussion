<h4>Billy or Nancy</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-152668424">Okay, I&#39;m cheating. This is just cut and pasted from our web site, but it<br/>
does answer the question! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Having always been someone who plans ahead, Nancy started thinking about our<br/>
children&#39;s education while still pregnant with our first child. We started<br/>
with different perspectives about education. Nancy had lived practically all<br/>
her life in the same house in Northern Virginia and attended public school<br/>
where she was subjected to an &quot;experimental program of the month&quot; education<br/>
during the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s. She remembers starting school as an outgoing child<br/>
who enjoyed reading to her classmates, but somewhere along the way becoming<br/>
more shy and developing a fear of speaking in public. She did well<br/>
academically, but just didn&#39;t enjoy going to school. Some of her strongest<br/>
memories include the year that &quot;mainstreaming&quot; put older kids with<br/>
developmental and behavioral problems in her class and one boy held her by<br/>
the wrists over a stairwell and threatened to drop her. She also remembers<br/>
the morning she felt sick and wanted to leave, but by the time the teacher<br/>
finally acknowledged her raised hand and called her to the front of the<br/>
room, it was too late and she threw-up on the teachers desk. Nancy just<br/>
didn&#39;t think much of her public school experience!<br/>
<br/>
Billy grew up as a Navy brat and attended about a dozen different schools.<br/>
Like Nancy, he also did well academically, but unlike Nancy, he viewed his<br/>
public school experience fairly positively, and wasn&#39;t as inclined to opt<br/>
for private school for our children. Besides, he figured we were going to be<br/>
such supportive parents that the actual school environment wasn&#39;t very<br/>
important. Our involvement could supplement any of the shortcomings of the<br/>
school. We started out evaluating and visiting lots of private schools and<br/>
public schools. As we checked out the public schools, we found they weren&#39;t<br/>
the same as when we attended. Classes were larger, students did more poorly,<br/>
and weapons and drugs were much more commonplace. Billy&#39;s frugal nature<br/>
rebelled against the idea of stretching our finances to pay thousands of<br/>
dollars for a private school, but it seemed like our only option and so we<br/>
visited several private schools. We liked many of the philosophies and<br/>
approaches we came across, but we ended up feeling that there were major<br/>
shortcomings at each school. For us, the perfect program would involve<br/>
combining the best ideas from 2 or 3 different schools. We also realized<br/>
that most private schools were based on the same model of the public<br/>
schools, only &quot;more&quot; and &quot;better.&quot; They had more computers, more hands-on<br/>
activities, better student/teacher ratios, better discipline, etc. We slowly<br/>
came to realize that we didn&#39;t just want a better version of a public school<br/>
education, we wanted something completely different.<br/>
<br/>
We had heard about homeschooling from various sources and decided we wanted<br/>
to read more about it. We checked out a handful of books from the public<br/>
library, including ones written by John Holt and the Colfax&#39;s Homeschooling<br/>
for Excellence. Parental involvement and the ability to combine the best<br/>
aspects of several different educational approaches were important to us, so<br/>
home education seemed the natural choice. We were even more convinced when a<br/>
careful self-evaluation made us realize that our important life skills, the<br/>
activities we enjoyed doing for fun or as hobbies, and most of our job<br/>
skills had all been learned outside of school! By the time our firstborn was<br/>
a year old, we had decided to continue educating him at home. That was in<br/>
1989, and we haven&#39;t looked back since.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;   When asked this question, I usually trot out what I&#39;ve always thought<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; the tried and true answers.  Colton can learn better one-on-one with me, I<br/>
&gt; can shield him from improper influences, etc.  But thinking this through a<br/>
&gt; little more carefully, I realize my reasons go a lot deeper.  Here are<br/>
just a<br/>
&gt; few of them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    I unschool because I was there when my son first held a butterfly.  I<br/>
&gt; unschool because it given me time to sit with my son, sewing patches on<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; Scout uniform, while he works on a Pokemon scrapbook and tells me stories.<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; unschool because I introduced Colton to the wonderful book &quot;Charlotte&#39;s<br/>
Web,&quot;<br/>
&gt; and we both cried when Charlotte died.  I unschool because the moment I<br/>
found<br/>
&gt; out that my father had to have brain surgery, Colton was there with me and<br/>
we<br/>
&gt; could pray together.  I unschool because when I battled cancer and<br/>
&gt; chemotherapy, Colton and I could snuggle together in bed and read living<br/>
&gt; books, and he would remind me that I had just eleven more treatments to<br/>
go.<br/>
&gt; I unschool because I am head-over-heels in love with this tender soul who<br/>
&gt; came into my life not quite ten years ago, and I don&#39;t want to miss a<br/>
minute<br/>
&gt; of it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Blessings,<br/>
&gt; Carol<br/>
