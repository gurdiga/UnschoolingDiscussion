<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341128061">I looked through the archives and didn&#39;t see anything about it, so I thought I&#39;d post: Has anyone read Thomas Friedman&#39;s &quot;The World is Flat&quot;? I&#39;m doing a holiday CD swap (getting my boss to listen to Gatto&#39;s &quot;Seven Lesson Schoolteacher&quot; while he has me listen to Friedman&#39;s book on tape) and I was curious if anyone had any opinions on him from an unschooling perspective - the folks at work talk about him all the time (we make self-directed technology curriculum software) and I managed to find a site that uses gatto and friedman to discuss the different sides of open-source programming... I figured I&#39;d listen to &quot;The World is Flat&quot; before forming any solid opinions, but I wanted to know what other unschoolers thought of him.<br/>
