 </span></blockquote>Since many of the recent posts have been somewhat less than<br/>
unschooling-focused, I&#39;m happy to agree with moving on.<br/>
<br/>
However, Linda, could you please quote a small portion of the post to which<br/>
you are replying so that silly little me reading zillions of messages out<br/>
here in digest-land knows what the heck you&#39;re refering to?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, I would really appreciate that.<br/>

p.s. The subject line got that old song stuck in my brain again...<br/>
<br/>
Labels are good for canned goods,<br/>
so you don&#39;t mistake the spinach for the beans<br/>
but the people that your meetin&#39;<br/>
aren&#39;t the same as food you&#39;re eatin&#39;<br/>
don&#39;t put labels on my friends.</div>
