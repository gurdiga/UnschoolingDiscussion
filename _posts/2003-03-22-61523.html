<div id="ygrps-yiv-320350120">my husband plays guitar and teaches professionally now. He always feels so much pressure from parents who want their kids to perform for them at a certain level ect. Most of everything that he has learned has been himself locking himself in a room and playing over and over again. However, he had a private instructor for years as a kid that he acknowledges moved him in the right direction and facilitated some of his skills. Kelli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s exactly my fear!  I remember starting ballet at 4 and being terrified <br/>
of the teacher, watching everyone else who seemed to know what was going on, <br/>
etc.  I eventually grew to love it, but then grew too tall for it way back <br/>
when.  Plus, I have ballet to thank for my lack of flexion in my foot.  In a <br/>
relaxed position, my foot is pointed more than most people&#39;s full stretch.  <br/>
When the surgeon tried to push my foot back to a neutral position, under <br/>
anesthesia, it wouldn&#39;t move.  So, almost four months after my cast came off, <br/>
I&#39;m still hobbling down the stairs.  <br/>
<br/>
So, do I really want to destroy my children&#39;s love of dance and deform their <br/>
feet at the tender ages of 3 and 4?<br/>
