<div id="ygrps-yiv-308632205">My kids haven&#39;t discovered the video games.  I don&#39;t limit computer<br/>
games, except that we only have one computer and they need to quit when<br/>
it&#39;s my turn or time for dinner, etc.  Computer usage hasn&#39;t been a<br/>
problem (yet).  They sometimes will play for a long time, but they<br/>
usually get tired of it or we need to go somewhere.  I&#39;m hoping to have<br/>
another computer in a year or two.  They are 8 and 5 now.<br/>
<br/>
I do limit watching TV.  We don&#39;t have cable, which greatly limits TV<br/>
appeal!  8 yr old rarely asks to watch a movie, but will watch if one is<br/>
going.  I&#39;m not really sure why I have this limit, except that too much<br/>
TV seems to &quot;dull&quot; them.  We did have a TV WEEK after Christmas.  5yr dd<br/>
asked if she could check out her limit of movies at the library, so we<br/>
each did and came home with 15 movies that we could keep for a week and I<br/>
said they could watch whenever they wanted.  I&#39;m happy to say that we<br/>
ended up not seeing all of them.  In fact, she preferred to re-view one<br/>
or two rather than see a new one.  But we did spend more time plopped on<br/>
the couch than normal.<br/>
<br/>
In Mother Dance (by same author as Dance of Anger, Lerner?), she writes<br/>
of an experiment with her sons.  She designated a shelf in the pantry<br/>
where they each had their own space.  They went to the store and they<br/>
each got to buy their favorite candy.  Then mom made sure that the pantry<br/>
was always well stocked with their goodies and they had unlimited access.<br/>
 (Can you imagine?  Johnny, your M&Ms are running low.  Put it on the<br/>
grocery list!)  If I recall correctly, they at first overdid the sweets<br/>
and then got tired of them.  In fact, she tells of her younger son<br/>
&quot;sneaking&quot; grapes at a buffet party.  The parents were boycotting grapes<br/>
because of worker issues, so they never had them in the house.  It&#39;s not<br/>
a homeschooling book, but I enjoyed reading her mothering insights.  Got<br/>
some good laughs too.<br/>

 <br/>
Too much mom-management there.  If Johnny&#39;s M&Ms are running out and <br/>
he doesn&#39;t ask for more, maybe he&#39;s had enough for the month or the <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
I CAN imagine giving kids unlimited choices, because we do.  And M&Ms <br/>
are loved, but still rarely requested.<br/>
<br/>
I had some in a container in my room.  The kids knew.  They still <br/>
lasted a month.  It&#39;s a long walk to my room and they had to REALLY <br/>
want M&Ms.</div>

&gt;	Not quoting anything just had something general to add.<br/>
&gt;While we don&#39;t really games at the moment. (we don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt;any)  The one thing I worry about with an excess of<br/>
&gt;computer, game, or tv time is the lack of exercise.  So<br/>
&gt;while I wouldn&#39;t really limit games I would say that for<br/>
&gt;every hour of game time I expected an equal amount of<br/>
&gt;exercise be it biking, soccer, running etc...<br/>

Would you do that yourself, too? Or do you consider housework to be exercise <br/>
enough?  I&#39;m asking, because I have a big, spread-out three-level house and I <br/>
end up doing a lot of exercise just moving things from room to room <br/>
(especially things like a big vacuum cleaner, big kids, frozen foods).  <br/>
<br/>
Modelling behavior seems better than requiring it, but there I am pointing <br/>
out logic-flaws and potential problems again...  (get used to it, i guess <br/>

 </span></blockquote>	It sounds like you get quit the work out!  I consider some<br/>
of the housework I do exercise, some not.  I tend to work<br/>
out a couple times a week (sometimes less) but I usually run<br/>
around in the yard with my daughter and play with her.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>	Exactly.  I have never believed that saying &quot;do as I say,<br/>
not as I do&quot; would ever work.  I impose similar rules on<br/>
myself (kind of tough on days when I&#39;m feeling lazy)  I<br/>
think most of all I enjoy being flexible.  If my daughter<br/>
comes up with a good enough reason to do something I&#39;ve<br/>
already said no to I&#39;m not afraid to change my mind. (she<br/>
can come up with some pretty good reasons too)<br/>

that&#39;s all I seem to want to do today.  That and now there<br/>
are four people vying for the computer.<br/>
