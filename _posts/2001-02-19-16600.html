<div id="ygrps-yiv-369490775">Hello, I am very new at this but am very interested in unschooling my <br/>
9 yr old daughter. She is currently in a TN public school, 3rd grade. <br/>
My questions are endless but I do have some specific ones. Is it <br/>
possible for me to take her out of public school now? or does she <br/>
have to finish the third grade so that I can register with the LEA by <br/>
Aug?  We were going to wait but are moving to a new school district. <br/>
Instead of putting her through the trauma of starting another new <br/>
school we really would like to start hs right away. We have talked <br/>
with local support group and they have advised us to register with a <br/>
local Christian school. The problem with this is that we are <br/>
not &quot;members&quot; of a church and have no pastor to sign their form <br/>
saying we are Christians.  I read something from LisaKK about <br/>
Interfaith Academy in Alabama would this be a way to go??  If anyone <br/>
has some suggestions or answers it would be greatly appreciated. My <br/>
daughter is really NOT wanting to start a new public school.</div>

<br/>
Yes, right in the middle of the day, regardless of what the school says.  <br/>
Because American citizens have the right to move when and where (within the <br/>
U.S.) they want to, unless there are other circumstances (felony, temporary <br/>
legal requirement to remain in a jurisdiction, custody considerations).  So <br/>
if you have no impediments to moving to Alaska (or the next county), you can <br/>
just go and get her.  Kids disappear and appear in U.S. schools all the time, <br/>
and the schools just have to accept them, records or no records.  And unless <br/>
you&#39;re wanting the records transferred to another school (which you don&#39;t), <br/>
you don&#39;t even need to tell the school what you&#39;re doing right away.   She <br/>
can miss several days of school without it being their big business.<br/>
<br/>
Registering by August (or whatever date individual states have, who have such <br/>
requirements) is for subsequent years.  The first year is usually an <br/>
exception! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty sure you don&#39;t have to. In most places you can pull your kids out <br/>
whenever you want to. You&#39;ll have to look into to TN law about how to do <br/>
that, you can get that easily from Jon&#39;s Homeschool Resource Page <br/>
&lt;www.midnightbeach.com/hs&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I don&#39;t know anything about Interfaith, but you might want to look into <br/>
Clonlara Home-based Education Program&lt;www.clonlara.org&gt;. Clonlara is a <br/>
private school in Ann Arbor, Michigan with a very good hpomeschool program. <br/>
They have a $550 tuition, but we find it well worth the cost. You simply <br/>
report your activities to Clonlara and they handle credits. They don&#39;t force <br/>
textbooks on you, and they take care of whatever records your state <br/>
requires, have a newsletter, offer pen-pals and advice, etc.<br/>
