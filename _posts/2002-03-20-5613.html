&lt;&lt;  Marty, when he was <br/>
 six and seven, would shoot straight up like a prairie-dog lookout and yell <br/>
 &quot;SCHOOL KIDS!&quot; and start gathering up our play equipment like we had to be <br/>
 OUT of there before the last of them touched the grass.    It was partly a <br/>
 joke, but it had happened several times that our park sessions were ruined <br/>
by <br/>
 other kids coming up, being stingy with the slides, taking our kids&#39; buckets <br/>
 and shovels and balls away from them, just getting on their bikes and <br/>
riding, <br/>
 etc.  The difference in behavior was notable.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, this sounds SO like our park days.  We meet at a park next to a community <br/>
center and a lot of the kids hang out in an after school program.....we like <br/>
to leave when they come.<br/>
Although last week it was a MOM (of preschoolers) that was the nightmare.<br/>
She first said &quot;Uh, uh, uh you sit DOWN&quot; to my daughter when she tried to go <br/>
down the slide on her feet.<br/>
Then she pointedly told us that &quot;THAT is an accident waiting to happen&quot; <br/>
referring to our children climbing a tree!!!<br/>
We politely told her that they climb the tree every week ( a huge old oak <br/>
with very large sprawling, SAFE branches btw) and left it at that.<br/>
She proceeded to go &quot;tattle&quot; on us inside the community center because we did <br/>
not remove our children from the tree....can you believe that?<br/>
The nerve.<br/>
Apparently the people running the center weren&#39;t too worried because nobody <br/>
came out to check on us, and she left shortly thereafter.<br/>
My son said he should have run up to her car and said &quot;Mam, please don&#39;t get <br/>
into that CAR!! It&#39;s an accident waiting to happen&quot;....LOL<br/>
Alice thought of a good one (after the fact of course ) too.....&quot;Oh, you are <br/>
SO right! We should ban all trees in this park!!&quot;<br/>
I would&#39;ve loved to see the look on her face...what a busybody!<br/>
School kids or school parents.....one can be just as annoying as the other.<br/>
<br/>
In all fairness though, a couple of our favorite friends are ps families.<br/>
They&#39;re so cool and open minded about many things,  I often scratch my head <br/>
and wonder why they don&#39;t get the homeschooling thing??!!<br/>

Thats a good one.<br/>
