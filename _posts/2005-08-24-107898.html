Different kids will need different kinds of coaching; some might need none at all.<br/>

And talking about it BEFORE it happens---like on the way to the <br/>
party---just give him a heads-up about what might/could happen and <br/>
different strategies for handling them.<br/>

<br/>
Last night my nephew called.   Holly took the call.   He was calling to say <br/>
he and his friend were going to drive home (100 miles) instead of coming to our <br/>
house to sleep, after Ozzfest.   Holly was polite, asked a couple of <br/>
questions, and then said &quot;Okay.   Bye.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After she hung up I suggested that maybe next time someone said he was going <br/>
to drive a hundred miles in the dark she might say &quot;Drive carefully&quot; or &quot;be <br/>
safe.&quot;   I said &quot;What you said was really nice, though.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
Just one little coaching moment.<br/>
