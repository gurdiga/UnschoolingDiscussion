<br/>
may I compliment you on all getting along living together, but suggest that<br/>
perhaps the fact that you all loved each other in some way (parent-child,<br/>
romantic relationship, whatever) before you became 5 different religions may<br/>
have some bearing on that?<br/>
<br/>
My impression is that many of the problems in the world relate to the fact<br/>
that people do NOT know and love each other as anything other than historic<br/>
opponents.  When relationships are built, as a christian school in Jerusalem<br/>
is trying to do with children from all 3 major faith groups, then people<br/>
have a foundation on which to build.<br/>

&gt; yet we all manage to live together.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So actually, it related to Ireland better, because that is a religion<br/>
&gt; thing more than the Palestine/Isreal thing which is beyond religion<br/>
&gt; and into land grabbing and politics.<br/>
