OH, vicious little dickens aren&#39;t they?!  I wonder if netting would work?  I put netting on all of our fruit trees when they look to be about ripe.  I don&#39;t know, I haven&#39;t had that much of a problem with my sunflowers.  Now the bird feeder, that&#39;s another story!!!  I wonder if you could put a smooth pipe up the stalk, like PVC or something, that&#39;s what we do with our young trees.  Or, you could try feeding them something else like someone mentioned.  <br/>

Squirrels around here don&#39;t like safflower seeds. Safflower seeds are more expensive than sunflower, but you use less since the squirrels don&#39;t do acrobatic feats to get them!<br/>
