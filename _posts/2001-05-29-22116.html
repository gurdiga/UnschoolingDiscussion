<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575451317">My nephew started homeschool after second grade.  He was the class <br/>
clown and kept getting notes from the teacher.  His dad was furious <br/>
because he would get a couple each week.  When he started homeschool <br/>
he was upset that he wouldn&#39;t be with his friends.  So mom pointed <br/>
out that (1) He and his friends never got together after school to <br/>
play anyway.  They only saw each other during school (and he was <br/>
getting in trouble).  (2) He kept getting in trouble!  Your son isn&#39;t <br/>
going to miss those friends for long.  When he realizes he can <br/>
complete school work in a couple of hours that will take his friends <br/>
seven hours, he will see it differently.<br/>

seven hours, he will see it differently.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I have tried to logic him out of it and it&#39;s just something he&#39;s going<br/>
to have to go through before he can fully feel that it&#39;ll be alright. Yes,<br/>
he&#39;s gone 7 hours a day. But he does not spend that amount of time doing<br/>
anything remotely like what he&#39;ll do at home. And he DOES have recess twice<br/>
a day plus lunch recess and PE twice a week - he and his friends organized<br/>
their own soccer games with teams and rules and he absolutely loves it.<br/>
These are not things I can recreate at home. Sure he can spend ALL day<br/>
outside if he wants when he homeschools but he can&#39;t spend it doing the<br/>
things he really loves - playing with all his friends. He NEVER gets in<br/>
trouble and he&#39;s (finally) made tons of really great friends. When we go to<br/>
school functions it is SO hard for me not to second-guess my decision<br/>
because I see the social interactions going on and they are all extremely<br/>
positive and not something I can recreate at home.<br/>
<br/>
SO - that being said - I do sort of have my own answer. I KNOW that he will<br/>
not have this interaction all summer, as is true with his other friends. And<br/>
he can&#39;t &quot;blame&quot; that on homeschooling. Over the summer, we are going to try<br/>
hard to keep busy in the neighborhood (he has two close friends he can ride<br/>
his bike over to) and try to further establish friendships in homeschooling<br/>
groups, church, etc. He&#39;s going to play soccer (yikes, I really hate this,<br/>
he lives in the real soccer haven in our area and everyone is<br/>
soccer-obsessed) through the summer and into the fall. They do teams by<br/>
neighborhood so that will be good. He will surely know all the kids from<br/>
school already. And then my husband has agreed to be &quot;social coordinator&quot;<br/>
for awhile (I am really introverted and shy - I&#39;d be happy to NEVER pick up<br/>
a phone) and arrange play dates and keep the friendships alive that he had<br/>
at school. No reason why he can&#39;t still have them from home, right? So<br/>
anyway - that&#39;s our plan. It won&#39;t be soccer three times a day, but<br/>
hopefully he&#39;ll have changed his priorities by fall and forgotten about all<br/>
that and won&#39;t resent homeschooling. Right now he resents the very mention<br/>
of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777954836">My daughter went to kindergarten and has kept up her friendship with her<br/>
best friend.  It can be done with some effort from the parents.  Are you<br/>
keeping him in school through the end of the year because he wants to stay<br/>
there?  I would be very concerned about the fact that he feels this adult<br/>
has the right to tell him what he&#39;s allowed to do and capable of doing.<br/>
Maybe the best message you could give him to show that she does not have<br/>
that power is to take him out now?   Every day he spends there is another<br/>
day to undo later, and if you&#39;re feeling that she has more power in your<br/>
home than you do, I&#39;d consider that a serious negative affect of being in<br/>
school. I&#39;m not trying to second guess you - obviously you know the<br/>
situation best.  My gut reaction is just get him out of there :). ~Rue<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039237258">&lt;&lt; Are you<br/>

<br/>
Well, if I were doing what *he* wants to do I&#39;d be keeping him there<br/>
forever. So, no, not really. I&#39;m keeping him there because I feel we have a<br/>
way better chance at a happier, less resentful transition into unschooling<br/>
if he leaves school with the rest of his classmates and just does not return<br/>
after break. I do respect the need for &quot;closure&quot; and the end of the year is<br/>
far less &quot;academic&quot; and structured and that is when ALL the &quot;fun&quot; stuff goes<br/>
on (Field Day, parties, etc). So I&#39;m ok leaving him in there if it means a<br/>
smoother transition later.<br/>
<br/>
This is a little boy who has been through TREMENDOUS change almost<br/>
constantly in life. He witnessed much emotional abuse for the first four<br/>
years of his life, then lost his father, was put into a charter Kindergarten<br/>
and then pulled out a few months later (JUST as he&#39;d started making<br/>
friends), then lost mama to the workforce, had a new man move into his life<br/>
and home, stayed with one caregiver, moved to a new city for the first time<br/>
in his life (had to lose all his life-long neighborhood pals), then went to<br/>
daycare (saying goodbye to his old caregiver) and had to leave when I lost<br/>
my job (and was completely tormented with grief that he lost all his daycare<br/>
friends and family), now I&#39;m home again and he&#39;s in school. My family has<br/>
made my comments about his lack of emotional stability - that I am<br/>
constantly uprooting him. I feel so guilty about all of this. Every time I<br/>
make a change he is more and more devastated. Things are FINALLY stable in<br/>
my life. But I am *so* cautious about making any changes in his life. I<br/>
*could* have homeschooled him last year and avoided all this mess but I lost<br/>
my job just a few weeks before school started and he already knew he was to<br/>
start and I had NO confidence that my unemployment status would be anything<br/>
but temporary. I still have days when I am in total fear that something will<br/>
happen that will require me to have to put my kids back in school/daycare<br/>
and those days are what make the jump to homeschooling so scary for me. But<br/>
the thoughts that I am consciously choosing an action that I KNOW will<br/>
absolutely devastate my child, emotionally, is a really HARD thing to do. I<br/>
am keeping to my convictions that homeschooling is for the greater good and<br/>
that my life IS stable and will continue to be stable but I am treading very<br/>
lightly because of the implications of uprooting this child from a place he<br/>
loves and feels safe yet again in his short six years of life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636386388">Well, Nicki, you and your little guy need some hugs!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.  Do you think that just possibly that he can be &quot;reading&quot;<br/>
some of the fear and guilt you feel and that is making all this harder for<br/>
him?  They have pretty good antennas at that age.  I mean, you are tense<br/>
because of feeling guilty and that tension may be affecting him.<br/>
<br/>
All the disruptions that have occured would have been big creators of<br/>
tension and he may &quot;read&quot; any tension as an automatic negative and<br/>
immediately go on the defensive.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can spend the summer setting up a network of friends for him to<br/>
stay close to when school starts.  Let him know what unschooling is all<br/>
about, how he gets to be in control.  Being in control may help him feel<br/>
safer and more secure.<br/>

This isn&#39;t an unschooler&#39;s response.  It&#39;s a homeschooler&#39;s response, but ANY <br/>
hours a day spent doing a day&#39;s worth of schoolwork is a school-based answer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Well, if I were doing what *he* wants to do I&#39;d be keeping him there<br/>

<br/>
That means you won&#39;t be doing what he wants by homeschooling either, and any <br/>
lack of success shouldn&#39;t be blamed on the homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
He might miss his friends.  Deciding in advance that parents can prevent the <br/>
missing of friends (or more likely missing the circumstances of seeing the <br/>
kids daily in a neutral place (not his home, not their home) might be <br/>
indicative of a lack of understanding of what he&#39;s liking about these friends <br/>

<br/>
Some of the problems of school have to do with the powerlessness of the kids. <br/>
 Sometimes homeschooled kids are put in a situation where they are powerless <br/>
too, and parents just can&#39;t understand why the problems continue.  The <br/>
powerlessness remained.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling works best when parents and children all WANT it. <br/>
School will work best when a child really wants it.<br/>

friends<br/>
and that school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I *think* I understand. He misses playing soccer three times a day. That is<br/>
what he says. That is what he claims to like best about school.<br/>
<br/>
I should also point out, for clarity, that he doesn&#39;t NOT like being at<br/>
home. He has NEVER complained about the days that I keep him home to attend<br/>
various homeschooling functions. He has, on many occasions, feigned illness<br/>
and later said that he just wanted to stay home. The further into the school<br/>
year, the more often he is doing this. It&#39;s pretty obvious that he wants to<br/>
&quot;have his cake and eat it too&quot; and I am trying to find the best way to make<br/>
that possible. Or, I guess I should say, I am trying to find the best way to<br/>
homeschool and make that possible.<br/>
<br/>
My desire to keep him home over the summer in the hopes that he will shift<br/>
needs is based on instinct - not necessarily some derived logic. I feel he<br/>
is &quot;on the fence&quot; and the best way to make the leap is to try it. He does<br/>
not like the *idea* of homeschooling but has enjoyed making his own<br/>
schedule - staying home when he wants, going when he wants, joining the<br/>
homeschooling group but still playing soccer three times a day. I would love<br/>
to try to simulate what he likes most at home over the summer and hopefully<br/>
he will just want to continue that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The<br/>
powerlessness remained.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I totally get that. I, myself, am very much on the fence however about what<br/>
areas he should have some say in and what areas are just adult decisions.<br/>
There are things I simply won&#39;t let him do (and I realize others are ok<br/>
letting their children experiment) and I haven&#39;t yet decided if choosing his<br/>
educational route at the age of 6 is one of those things. At one point it<br/>
felt appropriate to include him in the decision. Some days it seems like the<br/>
biggest mistake of my life...like maybe he needs me to just take control and<br/>
be the adult and make the choices and take a load off his back. I don&#39;t want<br/>
him to feel powerless but I also don&#39;t want to overwhelm him with options<br/>
that he can&#39;t possibly grasp the meaning of (long AND short term).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Exactly. We&#39;ve just &#39;experienced&#39; my unschooled girls<br/>
being with cousins who are in public school. While my<br/>
kids want and know how to play with other kids of<br/>
various ages and interests, the public schooled kids<br/>
are happy for the time that nobody is telling them<br/>
what to do and they prefer to veg out in front of the<br/>
tube rather than enjoy the company of what I consider<br/>
&quot;real&quot; friends (as opposed to a same-aged person<br/>
sitting next to them all day but not socializing!).<br/>
When you think about it, school isn&#39;t a social<br/>
gathering place where one can get to know other kids<br/>
very well. Social skills learned there are extremely<br/>
limited and controlled. I&#39;d much prefer the<br/>
unschooling way of having time to get to know yourself<br/>
as well as times (albeit less of it) getting together<br/>
with friends.<br/>

<br/>
One option we have here in Utah is called dual-enrollment. Mostly this is <br/>
used in the high-school level for those children who want to take upper <br/>
level math and science courses or want to get in on the optional classes of <br/>
art and drama, etc.  However, I do know of some parents with children in <br/>
elementary school who work with the teachers and their child goes 1-3 days a <br/>
week - afternoons only (that&#39;s the time of day the art, science and &quot;fun&quot; <br/>
classes are taught).  This might be one way to let him have his cake and eat <br/>
it too!<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion,<br/>

One option we have here in Utah is called dual-<br/>
enrollment. Mostly this is <br/>
used in the high-school level for those children who <br/>
want to take upper <br/>
level math and science courses or want to get in on the <br/>
optional classes of <br/>
art and drama, etc. However, I do know of some parents <br/>
with children in <br/>
elementary school who work with the teachers and their <br/>
child goes 1-3 days a <br/>
week - afternoons only (that&#39;s the time of day the art, <br/>
science and &quot;fun&quot; <br/>
classes are taught). This might be one way to let him <br/>
have his cake and eat <br/>
it too!<br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion,<br/>

Over here some children &#39;flexi-school&#39; (which, like <br/>
playgroup means something slightly different over here <br/>
to there, I think!)  It&#39;s at the discretion of the <br/>
teachers, &#39;authorised absence&#39; is the official term.  I <br/>
know of two families around here who&#39;ve used it.  The <br/>
amount of time a child spends in school is negotiated, <br/>
but the child registered with a state school has to <br/>
stay up-to-date with the National Curriculum (though <br/>
this isn&#39;t as hard as it sounds.)<br/>
