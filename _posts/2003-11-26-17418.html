<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298877765">I was just noticing tonight how much my parenting has changed.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight Janene had a tantrum in the store.  I had stopped at walgreens <br/>
for something, and had an extra kid with me.  THe kids wanted ice cream <br/>
but I only had so much cash and had forgotten my atm card, etc. so I <br/>
said I&#39;d buy them what they wanted as long as it was less than about <br/>
70cents each, which was about what I had left to spend.  Taylor and <br/>
Lexie picked out something pretty quickly but Janene kept choosing <br/>
things that were $3 or $9, or whatever.  Finally she settled on <br/>
something that was $1.99, which I could have gotten if I hadn&#39;t of <br/>
gotten Taylor&#39;s or Lexie&#39;s.  So I said no, she needed to choose <br/>
something under the price limit, as that was the cash on hand.  She <br/>
desolved into tears.  I tried talking to her but it was 8:00 and she was <br/>
tired and five, so I just put the things on the candy and started to pay <br/>
for them.  She was at my feet, screaming and crying.  I reached out and <br/>
picked up one of her favorite candy bars, KitKat, and paid for that <br/>
too.  Janene refused to leave.  She held on to the counter, screaming, <br/>
out of control.  I picked her up and carried her gently to the car.  Her <br/>
little arms wrapped around me and she loved on me as she was screaming <br/>
at me.  I just held her tight, until she settled and then put her in her <br/>
carseat and we drove home.  About half way home I started talking about <br/>
the plan for the evening, janene and I go upstairs to cuddle in bed, and <br/>
Lexie and Taylor wait downstairs for Taylor&#39;s mom.  Janene started to <br/>
say she didn&#39;t have a candy when I told her that I had bought her a <br/>
candy.  She was so happy. <br/>
<br/>
Thisi s a long convoluted way of saying that a few years ago I would <br/>
have said &quot;she doesn&#39;t get a candy, she had a tantrum.&quot;  But thanks to <br/>
all of you, instead I thought &quot;she is so tired, it&#39;s hard to make a <br/>
choice.&quot;  I don&#39;t think she saw the candy as a &quot;reward&quot; for her <br/>
behavior, as I have been taught would happen.  Instead I think she saw <br/>
it as a--I don&#39;t know, Sandra, Pam, all of you, help me out, a symbol of <br/>
my love, that even through she was upset, I still loved her.  Maybe more. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she&#39;s quiet in bed now and I&#39;m going to go cuddle until she goes <br/>
to sleep. <br/>
