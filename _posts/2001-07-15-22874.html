<div id="ygrps-yiv-473805306">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I need suggestions! We have been unschooling since my oldest daughter was<br/>
born (she is now almost 12) I am a single mother and have three other<br/>
children all of whom are unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
we also have a number of pets, two cats, one kitten, one puppy and lately<br/>
Ashley (my eldest) has bought two rats. (Skipping lightly over the fact that<br/>
her choice of pets leaves me stone-cold) the actual problem is this - in the<br/>
past when Ashley was younger she has had her own puppies and kittens and has<br/>
always failed to do her share of caring for them. After the last debacle<br/>
when I had to rehome her 10 month old puppy, I said that I would never again<br/>
buy her a pet - if she wanted one she would need to save up and buy it<br/>
herself plus do all the caring for it.<br/>
<br/>
She finally bought these two rats and their cage - had them at home for a<br/>
day and went off to a friend&#39;s place to play. She phoned later that night to<br/>
say she was going to stay the night! I reluctantly fed and looked after her<br/>
pet rats but now I am in a quandary.<br/>
<br/>
If I say that the rats have to go back to the petshop, I feel like I am<br/>
teaching her that living things are expendable. If I allow the rats to<br/>
starve or get ill through neglect, I really couldn&#39;t live with myself. How<br/>
do I ensure that she learns that pets are a commitment not to be taken<br/>
lightly and not to be passed on when she is bored???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841087602">Rats are very social creatures. (We have five females.)  You might explain<br/>
to her that she is their &quot;mommy&quot;.  They will get to know her voice and her<br/>
touch and will get to be loyal to her.  Personally, if it were one of my<br/>
children begging for a pet, with a history as you explained, I still<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have let her buy one, even with her own money.  Animals are<br/>
living creatures and don&#39;t deserve to be neglected just because their 11<br/>
yr. old. owner doesn&#39;t feel like dealing with the responsibility anymore. <br/>
You may explain to her that neglecting the animals she promised to care<br/>
for is just like you neglecting to feed and care for her.  It is your<br/>
responsiblity as her mom to care for her.  She knowingly took on these<br/>
animals and they are her responsiblity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sort of not following?  How is spending the night with a friend equated<br/>
with being bored by the rats?  If you wanted her to take care of the rats,<br/>
could she have come home, fed them, and then left to spend the night with<br/>
the friend?<br/>
<br/>
I have never had rats, so I&#39;m not sure if they need feeding more than once a<br/>
day or if they are like our gerbil, where you can place food in the cage for<br/>
a couple of days at a time. I know the water bottle lasts a couple of days<br/>
here.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1577786735">Hi, we have lots of pets here too. We live in the country and I guess the <br/>
kids figure we have the room. I guess it is a good thing that I like having <br/>
animals around too. We have never had rats though I hear they make great <br/>
pets. In the past we have had guinea pigs and gerbils. We loved the guinea <br/>
pigs but not so much the gerbils because they seemed intent on biting us. Now <br/>
our main pets are Siberean Huskies. It started with my 11 yr old wanting one <br/>
so he could start a dog team and has grown to all the kids (ages 13, 15, 17) <br/>
joining in. Now we have 7 huskies. The kids have them pull carts in parades <br/>
and pull them on scooters for fun. And if we have snow then we have them pull <br/>
a sled too. But there is definitely a lot of chores that go with that many <br/>
dogs. I just have a rule, chores first. When the kids get up in the morning <br/>
the dogs have to be feed and watered. After the kids have breakfast the dog <br/>
pens must be cleaned. In the summer the dogs need to be put in their <br/>
play/execise pen early before it gets hot. At first the kids would forget. <br/>
They would want to get on the pc or playstation, so I would remind them. I <br/>
did not order them to get out there, I would just remind them and off they <br/>
would go. Now it has become habit. Of course I am not so stern that there are <br/>
not exceptions to the rule. Last night the kids got a call to see if they <br/>
would like to help buck bales for a few hours. That meant money so of course <br/>
they wanted to go. Since it was spur of the moment and evening chores had not <br/>
been done I said I would do them. To me they are not really chores anyway, I <br/>
like to spend time with the dogs too, they are so sweet and each is unique. <br/>
The kids were gone till 11:00 last night and anyone who has lifted a hay bale <br/>
knows how heavy they are and what a job it would be to buck them for 4 hours. <br/>
So I took care of chores this morning too so the kids can sleep in. Everyone <br/>
is different on how they raise their kids and that is great. But here if the <br/>
kids get a pet then they have to take care of it. I have had good luck with <br/>
them doing so with only an occasional reminding. But if they just refused to <br/>
do it then I would say no psx, pc, karate classes, etc. I am not going to let <br/>
animals suffer because the kids decided they are tired of them. And I am not <br/>
going to take over for them all the time. I do not have that much free time. <br/>
Anyway, that is what I do here. I am sure that you will find a solution that <br/>
fits your family. <br/>
Have a lovely day<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1615479522">&lt;&lt; She knowingly took on these<br/>
animals and they are her responsiblity. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids can&#39;t knowingly do things as &quot;knowingly&quot; as adults can, because they&#39;re <br/>
kids.<br/>
They don&#39;t know the meaning of years, or forever.  Adults hardly can.<br/>
<br/>
With the earlier incident, the child was even younger.<br/>
<br/>
Are rats more important than spending the night elsewhere when the <br/>
opportunity arises?  The truth is she doesn&#39;t live all alone and there are <br/>
others in the family who can help out.  <br/>
<br/>
If I lived all alone, it would be a problem that we have a dog and some cats. <br/>
 But I don&#39;t live alone.  The few times the entire family is gone overnight, <br/>
we ask a friend to feed them, maybe even to stay with them.  But if one or <br/>
even four of us are gone, those who are home keep them.<br/>
<br/>
Since there&#39;s a rat aversion in the mom, maybe charge the child money for the <br/>
times others have to care for her pets?  If she gets allowance, maybe chart <br/>
what she&#39;s not going to get.<br/>
<br/>
But the problem there is levels of tolerance.  If the parent cleans the cage <br/>
every time it&#39;s not as clean as possible but the child would have waited a <br/>
couple of days, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to charge for that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How<br/>
do I ensure that she learns that pets are a commitment not to be taken<br/>
lightly and not to be passed on when she is bored???-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think your relationship with her is important and to harm it by being <br/>
inflexible, expecting too much understanding, or being cold about something <br/>
she cares about would be worse than just feeding rats sometimes.  Rats don&#39;t <br/>
live as long as dogs or parrots.  That&#39;s the good news (if there is any &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I had a rat when I was ten or so.  When it was cold one night it escaped the <br/>
bed and came and got in bed with me.  There were two kids in that room and it <br/>
came to me!  I saw it as a sign of true love.  Later it killed my cousin&#39;s <br/>
parakeet.  We gave it away.  It destroyed a fancy Christmas fruitcake the <br/>
grandmother had worked on for over a week.  They gave it away.  It fought <br/>
with a parrot they had had since before they had children.  They gave it away <br/>
to relatives in Santa Fe and I lost track of its adventures.<br/>
<br/>
You might find a family in which both parents think rats are great and give <br/>
them the whole setup (your daughter might, I mean) in a year or so when she&#39;s <br/>
tired of keeping them.  Rats won&#39;t pine away with sorrow at being given away <br/>
and having their names changed as a dog might.  <br/>
<br/>
I think helping kids with all their projects and tasks and goals is just part <br/>
of being a parent.  I&#39;m glad my kids are healthy and mobile and able to take <br/>
care of themselves to the extent they can, and that they&#39;re curious and want <br/>
to do things.  They can&#39;t be self-sufficient; they&#39;re kids.<br/>
<br/>
When I see a family with a child who will still be needing serious daily <br/>
tending even when he&#39;s an adult I&#39;m thrilled that mine can walk, read, climb <br/>
and sing.  When I see a family raising a child their own teen accidently <br/>
produced, I hope mine will be smart and lucky and responsible.  For some <br/>
families, even having a child turn 18 or 20 doesn&#39;t end the labor.<br/>

with one of them that if she is spending the night elsewhere, that they <br/>
could feed and water them?<br/>
<br/>
I have had 3 rats in my time and I know that going a night without food is <br/>
not a bad thing, as long as she came home the next day to feed them.  They <br/>
will not scream or make any noise and they usually hoard a bit anyway, at <br/>
least mine did in a corner of the cage...unless the other rat found its <br/>
stash :o)<br/>

<br/>
I have no objection at all to her going away overnight or even longer; my<br/>
issue was that she did not make any arrangements to have her brother (8) or<br/>
sisters care for these vermin...um...dear little members of the family while<br/>
she was to be away.<br/>
<br/>
I am very happy to help out when required but at almost 12 I do expect<br/>
Ashley to have the foresight to make arrangements for their care and feeding<br/>
when she is unable to do so. Is that unreasonable??<br/>
ease give me more feedback - what ages do you all think a child can<br/>
reasonably expected to do this level of caring??<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had my first pet rat 25 years ago - my dad was (and is) a research<br/>
pathologist and one year for Christmas, my brother and I each got one of<br/>
the extras - we&#39;d already done mice years before. In high school I had a<br/>
rat named Spike, who came to school with me. Our latest rat was Harry<br/>
Potter (a hooded rat with a white line of fur on his forehead). He was a<br/>
domestic rat but we got him from the animal shelter where he had been<br/>
turned in as a stray... before that my daughter was briefly in the<br/>
mouse-breeding business, and before that we had a hamster who would run<br/>
around loose and sleep with the cats (we have oh-so-wimpy cats), and<br/>
before that we had a ferret, who would also run around loose but would<br/>
chase the cats. <br/>
<br/>
I actually like ferrets best, but now we&#39;re in California where they have<br/>
misguidedly made them illegal... so we&#39;re thinking of a chinchilla next,<br/>
although my daughter really would prefer to have a rabbit again, I<br/>
think...<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never really had pets that ended up being hers or mine, they&#39;ve all<br/>
sort of ended up being family pets... like, Harry was mine, but she would<br/>
play with him and hold him while I cleaned the cage and stuff (in his<br/>
dottage, Harry bit her friend&#39;s finger and blood spurted everywhere, that<br/>
was exciting) and I helped with her mice, and she feeds the cats<br/>
sometimes which have got to be techinically my pets because they&#39;re older<br/>
than she is. I guess it just seems easier to me for each of us to do<br/>
stuff as it needs to be done... I mean, if she was around and I was<br/>
zipping past the mouse cage and noticed that the water was low, I would<br/>
mention it to her in passing and expect that when she came to a good<br/>
stopping place in what she was doing, she&#39;d take care of it... which<br/>
worked often enough to keep me from feeling put-upon, most of the time<br/>
anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249472273">Let&#39;s see:<br/>
<br/>
Eldest kidlet took care of her horses starting when she was 5.  Or at least<br/>
she thought she did &lt;g&gt;  But the point is that she faithfully did what she<br/>
could and never forgot them.<br/>
<br/>
Eldest son took care of his rabbits starting when he was 4 and his goats<br/>
when he was 7.<br/>
<br/>
Son #2 had various pets but never did accept the responsibility so he<br/>
stopped &quot;owning&quot; any pets.  He just never had that &quot;organized&quot; a mind and<br/>
would &quot;forget&quot; the pets when he became involved in something else.<br/>
<br/>
Son #3 had lizards, turtles, cats, guinea pigs, rats and birds starting when<br/>
he was 3.  He did fine with his responsibilities until he discovered girls.<br/>
By 17 he had given away most of his pets except for his extremely nasty<br/>
tempered chiclid which he still has.<br/>
<br/>
My point being that it is the individual child, not an age.  BUT, IMHO, by<br/>
age 12 if they want the pet they should be willing to accept the<br/>
responsibility or not have the pet.<br/>

&gt; Dear Sandra and all others who replied,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have no objection at all to her going away overnight or even longer; my<br/>
&gt; issue was that she did not make any arrangements to have her brother (8)<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; sisters care for these vermin...um...dear little members of the family<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; she was to be away.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am very happy to help out when required but at almost 12 I do expect<br/>
&gt; Ashley to have the foresight to make arrangements for their care and<br/>
feeding<br/>
&gt; when she is unable to do so. Is that unreasonable??<br/>
&gt; ease give me more feedback - what ages do you all think a child can<br/>
&gt; reasonably expected to do this level of caring??<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Love<br/>
&gt; Brooke<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had my first pet rat 25 years ago - my dad was (and is) a research<br/>
&gt; pathologist and one year for Christmas, my brother and I each got one of<br/>
&gt; the extras - we&#39;d already done mice years before. In high school I had a<br/>
&gt; rat named Spike, who came to school with me. Our latest rat was Harry<br/>
&gt; Potter (a hooded rat with a white line of fur on his forehead). He was a<br/>
&gt; domestic rat but we got him from the animal shelter where he had been<br/>
&gt; turned in as a stray... before that my daughter was briefly in the<br/>
&gt; mouse-breeding business, and before that we had a hamster who would run<br/>
&gt; around loose and sleep with the cats (we have oh-so-wimpy cats), and<br/>
&gt; before that we had a ferret, who would also run around loose but would<br/>
&gt; chase the cats.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I actually like ferrets best, but now we&#39;re in California where they have<br/>
&gt; misguidedly made them illegal... so we&#39;re thinking of a chinchilla next,<br/>
&gt; although my daughter really would prefer to have a rabbit again, I<br/>
&gt; think...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve never really had pets that ended up being hers or mine, they&#39;ve all<br/>
&gt; sort of ended up being family pets... like, Harry was mine, but she would<br/>
&gt; play with him and hold him while I cleaned the cage and stuff (in his<br/>
&gt; dottage, Harry bit her friend&#39;s finger and blood spurted everywhere, that<br/>
&gt; was exciting) and I helped with her mice, and she feeds the cats<br/>
&gt; sometimes which have got to be techinically my pets because they&#39;re older<br/>
&gt; than she is. I guess it just seems easier to me for each of us to do<br/>
&gt; stuff as it needs to be done... I mean, if she was around and I was<br/>
&gt; zipping past the mouse cage and noticed that the water was low, I would<br/>
&gt; mention it to her in passing and expect that when she came to a good<br/>
&gt; stopping place in what she was doing, she&#39;d take care of it... which<br/>
&gt; worked often enough to keep me from feeling put-upon, most of the time<br/>
&gt; anyway.<br/>

If it was in the past four years, it may be so.  Four or five years ago every <br/>
case they traced back had to do with deer mice in the Manzanos, and some were <br/>
found in eastern Albuquerque--not infecting, but caught and tested and <br/>
&quot;guilty.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s dead animals that get you anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
The University of New Mexico Hospital (here in town) is the champion plague <br/>
authority.   I would be surprised if prairie dogs weren&#39;t a danger, but there <br/>
are only fewer than five cases a year, and those are fixed with antibiotics.  <br/>
They&#39;ve had very few get to pneumonic (big bad phase) plague, and few (two?) <br/>
deaths, last I knew, over a fifteen year or so recording period.<br/>
<br/>
We camp in those mountains at least twice a year, often with a hundred or <br/>
thousand other people (crazy SCA stuff) and I only know of one incident--some<br/>
one went home to Kansas or Nebraska, I think it was, but they remembered the <br/>
announcement warning about symptoms, and had their doctor call UNM, and it <br/>
was all fixed up.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard that Japanese were importing prairie dogs for pets.  I can <br/>
hardly imagine, after hearing how small their houses are, how and where they <br/>
might be keeping them.<br/>

<br/>
I am thinking that you actually &quot;expect&quot; her to NOT make arrangements-to drop the ball.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is my feedback - forget all of her &quot;history&quot;, pretend she is your friend- not someone you have to &quot;teach responsibility&quot; to, take a deep breath and then respond.  It might sound something like, &quot;Oh, HI! I just called cause I wasn&#39;t sure if the rats had a babysitter- you know me! I&#39;m just icked out by it!&quot;  She might say, &quot;oh shoot! I forgot, hmm..Im so sorry, um let me talk to dad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could make up a bunch of different things you or she might say- but the point is- you are coming from a perspective of &quot;she just doesnt take responsibility!&quot; (&quot;expecting&quot; failure) and what really helps (at least in my experience)is to believe she is and will be responsible and capable.  <br/>
<br/>
We are our children&#39;s mirrors :-)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160601254">I know I&#39;m a little behind on this thread, but as we have a cat, fish, two <br/>
guinea pigs and now two land hermit crabs (in addition to sons 8 and 4), I <br/>
feel qualified to comment. I think I also have a slightly different point of <br/>
view than most others.<br/>
<br/>
I have always considered whatever animals I allow in (or around) the house <br/>
to be my responsibility. To me, the dividend for the kids is not the daily <br/>
drudgery of cleaning cages and taking dogs for walks, but the enjoyment of <br/>
cuddling a cat or guinea pig and the love they give you back, or the <br/>
scientific interest in watching an aquarium environment or a hermit crab. I <br/>
try to model loving and responsible care of the creatures and I think I have <br/>
succeeded in setting a good example, because the kids are kind to them and <br/>
respectful of all animals. I can say from the kids&#39; point of view, the <br/>
animals have all been a 100 percent positive and enjoyable experience -- no <br/>
drudgery. They usually do feed or water the animals on the occasions when I <br/>
ask (sometimes they say they&#39;re busy with something else, and I don&#39;t force <br/>
it) and they always are eager to cuddle and feed a guinea pig during story <br/>
time or while watching TV. (I think guinea pigs are the ideal pet for this <br/>
age group -- domesticated, cuddly, not nocturnal, hardy and, well, darn cute <br/>
in their beady-eyed way.)<br/>
<br/>
When I was a young teen-ager we got a dog (at my request) and it was my <br/>
responsibility to walk it and feed it. After a few years, I really  dreaded <br/>
the chores and was thoroughly tired of the dog. I am not crazy about dogs to <br/>
this day. I am hoping to spare my kids this type of negative experience. <br/>
(Another good thing about guinea pigs -- they usually only live about four <br/>
or five years.)<br/>
<br/>
In the past the guys have asked for a dog, and I always say no because I <br/>
don&#39;t want to take care of one, listen to it bark in the yard, clean up <br/>
after it, etc.<br/>

Thanks for your reply. My other children are 8, 6 and 3 so yes, the two<br/>
eldest could certainly care for the rats when Ashley isn&#39;t home. My concern<br/>
was that she hadn&#39;t made any arrangements to have someone else care for the<br/>

with one of them that if she is spending the night elsewhere, that they <br/>
could feed and water them?<br/>

I have had 3 rats in my time and I know that going a night without food is <br/>
not a bad thing, as long as she came home the next day to feed them. They <br/>
will not scream or make any noise and they usually hoard a bit anyway, at <br/>
least mine did in a corner of the cage...unless the other rat found its <br/>
stash :o)<br/>

I do tend to agree with you. However I also want to keep giving her<br/>
opportunities to care for pets ie I don&#39;t want to say &quot;No, three years ago<br/>
you didn&#39;t look after your kitten and asked me to give it away so now you<br/>
can&#39;t have any more pets.&quot;<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Pets!<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see:<br/>
<br/>
Eldest kidlet took care of her horses starting when she was 5. Or at least<br/>
she thought she did &lt;g&gt; But the point is that she faithfully did what she<br/>
could and never forgot them.<br/>
<br/>
Eldest son took care of his rabbits starting when he was 4 and his goats<br/>
when he was 7.<br/>
<br/>
Son #2 had various pets but never did accept the responsibility so he<br/>
stopped &quot;owning&quot; any pets. He just never had that &quot;organized&quot; a mind and<br/>
would &quot;forget&quot; the pets when he became involved in something else.<br/>
<br/>
Son #3 had lizards, turtles, cats, guinea pigs, rats and birds starting when<br/>
he was 3. He did fine with his responsibilities until he discovered girls.<br/>
By 17 he had given away most of his pets except for his extremely nasty<br/>
tempered chiclid which he still has.<br/>
<br/>
My point being that it is the individual child, not an age. BUT, IMHO, by<br/>
age 12 if they want the pet they should be willing to accept the<br/>
responsibility or not have the pet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1416524610">Dear Bronwen,<br/>
<br/>
Boy did you hit a nerve with this reply! LOL I was so defensive when I read<br/>
it that I decided a) I had better wait a couple of days before replying and<br/>
b) I had better examine WHY I was so defensive!!<br/>
<br/>
I think you are right, unfortunately. Ashley is almost 12 and since she was<br/>
6 has had four puppies (all of whom she asked me to give away as she was<br/>
tired of looking after them) three kittens (all of whom she asked me to give<br/>
away as she was tired of looking after them) and an aquarium of fish that<br/>
she managed to persuade her younger brother he really, really wanted when..<br/>
she got tired of looking after them!<br/>

I guess I feel like I am torn between letting her learn responsibility and<br/>
protecting the animals from being considered as chattels that can be just<br/>
passed on when the novelty factor wears off.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand what you are saying about a gentle query being possibly all<br/>
that is required. I guess I was just afraid that my fun, positive, gentle<br/>
reminders can be misconstrued as &quot;nagging&quot; by a child who no longer has any<br/>
interest in doing the necessary task.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmmmmmmmm - maybe it is my attitude that needs work!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thoughtful and thought-provoking reply!!<br/>
<br/>
Love<br/>
Brooke<br/>

Hi Brooke :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I am very happy to help out when required but at almost 12 I do expect<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking that you actually &quot;expect&quot; her to NOT make arrangements-to<br/>
drop the ball. <br/>
<br/>
Here is my feedback - forget all of her &quot;history&quot;, pretend she is your<br/>
friend- not someone you have to &quot;teach responsibility&quot; to, take a deep<br/>
breath and then respond. It might sound something like, &quot;Oh, HI! I just<br/>
called cause I wasn&#39;t sure if the rats had a babysitter- you know me! I&#39;m<br/>
just icked out by it!&quot; She might say, &quot;oh shoot! I forgot, hmm..Im so sorry,<br/>
um let me talk to dad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could make up a bunch of different things you or she might say- but the<br/>
point is- you are coming from a perspective of &quot;she just doesnt take<br/>
responsibility!&quot; (&quot;expecting&quot; failure) and what really helps (at least in my<br/>
experience)is to believe she is and will be responsible and capable. <br/>
<br/>
We are our children&#39;s mirrors :-) <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Boy did you hit a nerve with this reply! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>*oh man!  i wrote it maybe too fast cause i was in a hurry- sorry.  I love a quote I read once, &quot;attend your own lectures&quot;.  Usually what I can help people with, I do or have done myself and am trying to stop! (that is what I meant by &quot;in my experience&quot;!)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Totally! I hate being thought of as a nag!  I like what Annette said about doing the things herself.  I have been thinking alot lately about modeling and chores.  How ever can I think our kids are going to like taking care of the house if I just treat it as pure drudgery- &quot;please please help me clean the gross kitchen!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have been concentrating on my attitude- like if I see something that needs to be done- like Chloe weed eated the yard (without me asking!) but she left the weed eater out in the yard and stuff.  I thought about yelling, &quot;CHloe you left the weed eater out- just like your dad- never FINISHES things!&quot;  (now that sounds polite!) BUt instead, I thought- you know, I am just going to put it away- I am out here already, and I would love to help her- after all she weed eated!  Then later I said, &quot; Dont worry, I put away the weed eater for you&quot;  She said &quot;oh thanks mom!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
ANyway, I am always saying things like &quot;lets pick up as we go&quot;- &quot;it doesnt matter who made the mess- lets just all pick up&quot;- so then why would I say- &quot;go out there and pick up that weed eater!&quot; When I was just out there?-see I need to attend my own lectures....hee hee<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664515153">We have 3 dogs and a horse, and my youngest dd (9) wants rats and a goat. We&#39;ve been to the library a lot  and she&#39;s been on the internet a lot and has learned quite a bit about rats. I am learning to set aside my sensitivities about the cute little beasties/rodents, and to support her in her interest. <br/>
My oldest dd&#39;s(13) passion is horses. I don&#39;t love horses but I do love my daughter and HER love of horses. She cleans his stall daily, worms him, immunizes him and feeds. And we all help out. there&#39;s something magical about being in the barn in the dark...   As far as I am concerned, it doesn&#39;t get much better than this... <br/>
 I wonder what the world would be like if we had had the support to follow our dreams and to know what our passions were when we were young....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075972510">Dear Debra<br/>
Can you pursue some of your dreams now?  Perhaps at<br/>
this older age you know what you REALLY have aptitudes<br/>
for. You obviously have an aptitude for mothering.<br/>
Your children are lucky to have you. And their pets!  <br/>
<br/>
We have a horse (two in a few days) a goat (named<br/>
Stupid....it is a LOT of bother.  She has horns and<br/>
the horns are dangerous. She gets her head stuck in<br/>
the oddest places, but it is difficult, and dangerous<br/>
to get her our.  If you get a kid (they are really<br/>
really cute, and fairly easy to care for)for a pet, I<br/>
would suggest that you get one without horns. I&#39;m no<br/>
goat espert, but the horns are a pain. We also have<br/>
dogs, cats, rabbits, chickens, ducks and one<br/>
cockatiel, and lots of wildlife, which sometimes are<br/>
temporary pets.<br/>
