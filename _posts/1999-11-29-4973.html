<div id="ygrps-yiv-1362596958">I highly recommend the Douglas Adams classic: &quot;Hitchhiker&#39;s Guide to the<br/>
Galaxy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My first exposure to Adam&#39;s lunacy was over 10 years ago.  It started with<br/>
the BBC Radio Programs.  Later, I read the book and all of its sequels.<br/>
<br/>
Adam&#39;s sarcasm, wit, intelligent humor, and upside-down thinking did wonders<br/>
to help me break free from the shackles of mainstream thought and ideals.<br/>
His books opened my eyes and deconstructed so much of what I had thought was<br/>
the truth.  After exposure to Adams, my mind became sufficiently warped so<br/>
as to render me permanently incapacitated to function as a mere cog in the<br/>
machinery of society.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend him to anyone desiring such an irreversible transformation<br/>

&quot;...Man had always assumed that he was more intelligent than<br/>
 dolphins because he had achieved so much... the wheel, New York,<br/>
 wars, and so on, whilst all the dolphins had ever done was muck<br/>
 about in the water having a good time. But conversely the<br/>
 dolphins believed themselves to be more intelligent than man for<br/>
 precisely the same reasons.&quot;  Douglas Adams</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983096727">I remember hearing this funny book on CBC radio, what must be 15 years ago.  It<br/>
had a very Kurt Vonnegut kind of humour interwoven.  Has anyone read &quot;The Sheep<br/>
Look Up&quot; by John Brunner?  It was almost a psychic premonition of things to<br/>
come.  Today&#39;s news yesterday.  It really gave me an edge knowing what was going<br/>
to be happening 10 years later.<br/>

I second that!  (Despite the terrible pain in all the diodes down my left <br/>
side.)   <br/>
<br/>
Hilarious. My sons gleefully quote great chunks of it. The tapes need to come <br/>
with a health warning, though, about the Screaming Pitch Effect of having to <br/>
listen to them being played overandoverandoverandoverandagain. Even on <br/>
mothers who quite liked them, to start with. <br/>
<br/>
Gluttons for punishment might be interested to know that the sound version is <br/>
now available on CD. (eg from amazon.co.uk)<br/>
