     Eileen, I think your situation is very different than that of most <br/>
parents.  You are right; you know the reality of your situation and from the <br/>
things you have said, I can understand your point.  Also, you are talking <br/>
about spanking once with an unusual combination of circumstances.  I think <br/>
what most people who object to spanking are referring to is the more <br/>
commonplace situations where there truly are many other choices available <br/>
besides spanking.  I am sorry if anything I have said was insulting in any <br/>
way to you.  <br/>
