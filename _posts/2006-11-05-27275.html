<div id="ygrps-yiv-578612629">I let this post go through because with tweaks in language it could  <br/>
sound just as unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like funshops on bits from the geographical area, and could be  <br/>
good for an unschooling family.  So don&#39;t take it apart.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
spam.  I had a request in advance.<br/>
