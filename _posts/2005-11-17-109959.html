<br/>
Either way, I&#39;d discuss it with my kids (if they were interested--that would <br/>
be Holly and maybe Marty, for such a topic) and use it as an example of a <br/>
parent micro-managing a kid&#39;s life, and about bad science (or superstition, <br/>
depending).<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I&#39;d do.   That and try to avoid hearing her tales of doom.<br/>

Someone  on my local list told us that<br/>
her son came down with a cold because he  drank a root beer float<br/>
with his cross country team to celebrate a  victory.  The poor kid<br/>
couldn&#39;t run so well with his cold and got  knocked down to JV and<br/>
his mom is convinced it&#39;s because he drank that root  beer float.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
He caught a cold because he had too much exposure to one of thousands of  <br/>
cold viruses he came in contact with in the course of an hour at a public high  <br/>
school.  sheesh.  <br/>
 <br/>
Where do we get this idea that we can always prevent disease, no matter  <br/>
what, if we just do x and such?<br/>

scientific investigation, not the end point. To be a valid conclusion  <br/>
he would need to repeat the experiment several times.<br/>
<br/>
But since he was afraid to tell her it&#39;s also possible he was  <br/>
convinced he couldn&#39;t fight off a cold because of the root beer so  <br/>
his body gave into it<br/>
<br/>
And if that&#39;s true the experiment wouldn&#39;t work. Now he&#39;s more  <br/>
convinced her idea is right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-304374316">Chris, I work with this woman. Okay, not really, because my coworker <br/>
doesn&#39;t homeschool, but I work with a woman who believes that *all* <br/>
colds are caused by drinking milk (not, for example, by exposure to <br/>
a sick person), that consumption of **any** soy will wreak immediate <br/>
and lasting damage on the endocrine system, and on and on and on. I <br/>
have worked with her for 5 years, through 2 pregnancies (mine, I <br/>
mean) and my kids&#39; early lives. I have suffered a pretty steady <br/>
stream of &quot;advice&quot; and other &quot;helpful information&quot;. I have tried <br/>
talking sense to her; I have tried showing her research and studies <br/>
online that refute her &quot;information&quot;; I have tried telling her to <br/>
buzz off. Nothing works. I now either ignore it or gently tease her <br/>
for her &quot;wacky ideas&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m getting at is that there is probably nothing anyone can say <br/>
or do to disabuse a person like this of their notions. That frame of <br/>
belief is so strong, in my experience, that reality gets warped to <br/>
fit it, not the other way around. [My coworker, for example, is <br/>
never sick--because she takes so many vitamins. But once or twice a <br/>
year she &quot;eats some bad food&quot;, resulting in symptoms that look for <br/>
all the world like intestinal flu.]<br/>

<br/>
They don&#39;t mind there being God of the one-and-only or some sort, as long as <br/>
they&#39;re sure they can control him too.<br/>
<br/>
Last time there was a mini-ice age, in the Middle Ages, people undoubtedly <br/>
thought their crop failures had to do with how much money they were giving the <br/>
church, or whether they were being faithful in marriage or saying prayers at <br/>
night.    That seems silly to most people now (not at all to Pat Robertson, but <br/>
he&#39;s a nut).   But there are even more people now and then pretty sure that <br/>
we&#39;ve angered and endangered Gaia (or some representation thereof) and now there <br/>
will be a flood of coastal reas because People Were BAD.     <br/>
<br/>
People claim to respect God or the planet or whatever they consider bigger <br/>
than they are, but ultimately they want to control them too.<br/>
