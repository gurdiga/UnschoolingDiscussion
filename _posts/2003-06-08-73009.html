<div id="ygrps-yiv-935984160">The sequence about manners was really good for me. I started <br/>
thinking about shifts we&#39;ve made and why we&#39;ve made them. I <br/>
have a couple of points I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
1. I want my home to be reality-based.<br/>
<br/>
What I mean by this is that I want kids to respond to reality, not <br/>
an ideal. If the food isn&#39;t tasty, I don&#39;t want them pretending it is. If <br/>
they feel irritated that dinner is taking a long time, I don&#39;t want <br/>
them to pretend that they don&#39;t mind just to appease me or avoid <br/>
being in trouble. I would hope that they can express those <br/>
feelings with an increasing ability to care about the feelings of <br/>
others as they do, but even in an immature form, I&#39;d rather they <br/>
say &quot;Dinner is taking too long. I want to get down.&quot; than <br/>
smouldering and pretending.<br/>
<br/>
2. I want the kids to feel they can tell me anything.<br/>
<br/>
One problem with authoritarian parenting is that kids know who <br/>
calls the shots in their lives so they will lie or hide to protect <br/>
themselves from outcomes they don&#39;t want. Example: my <br/>
daughter went to a sleep-over with four Christian homeschooled <br/>
girls. When I picked her up, I said, &quot;How late did you stay up?&quot; <br/>
She said, &quot;4:30&quot; Her best friend said, &quot;I&#39;m not telling my mom <br/>
that. I&#39;ll just tell her 2:00 a.m. or she won&#39;t let me do it again.&quot; I <br/>
said, &quot;You&#39;d be lying to your mother.&quot; She replied, &quot;She won&#39;t <br/>
know.&quot; Blew me away that she&#39;d admit this to one of her mother&#39;s <br/>
best friends! (me)<br/>
<br/>
My son returned from an overnight where he and his four friends <br/>
streaked at 2:30 a.m. and he shared it with me saying, &quot;Please <br/>
don&#39;t tell the other moms. They will say no to future overnights.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m seen as the threatening kill-joy in my kids lives, I&#39;ll lose <br/>
access to them and any influence I want to have will be gone.<br/>
<br/>
3. I want my kids to experience reciprocity.<br/>
<br/>
When we (the parents) violate a child&#39;s sense of justice, I want <br/>
the child to feel free to say so, to expect restitution in the same <br/>
ways we want it from them when they damage or violate <br/>
someone else&#39;s space. And we give it. anyone can say, &quot;You&#39;re <br/>
out of line&quot;--parent to kid, kid to parent. My hope is that we&#39;re <br/>
raising kids who have a strong sense of what&#39;s right and won&#39;t <br/>
be subject to bullying... or at least won&#39;t accept it.<br/>
<br/>
4. I want us to have fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that life is just not that fun when one person&#39;s view of <br/>
how things ought to be done controls the space. This happens <br/>
in classrooms, in homes and in offices every day of the year. I&#39;m <br/>
happy to let go of control in order to create an environment where <br/>
everyone is able to find ways to enjoy living life together.<br/>
<br/>
Any other thoughts on what you want?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818614351">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
first of all, this is getting printed as I type. VERY good, Julie B!<br/>

<br/>
Another table rule of ours: taste everything on your plate. If <br/>
there&#39;s something you don&#39;t like, you don&#39;t have to eat it. But at <br/>
least taste it. I&#39;ve learned what&#39;s &quot;edible&quot; around here, and what <br/>
isn&#39;t, but trying things is a good habit, IMO. If it&#39;s yucky, I have <br/>
no problem with them saying so. <br/>

yes as often as possible, but both hubby and I being somewhat <br/>
pessimistic and naturally negative, &quot;No&quot; comes out automatically. <br/>
We&#39;ve given the kids (more for my husband than myself) a process <br/>
where they can say &quot;I&#39;d like to appeal&quot; and then explain why they <br/>
should get a &quot;yes&quot; instead of a &quot;no.&quot; If we can&#39;t think of a good <br/>
reason why not, we must change our &quot;no&quot; to a &quot;yes.&quot; This way, they <br/>
aren&#39;t just whining at us, and my hubby doesn&#39;t see it as back talk. <br/>
Which is a Good Thing, Man.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385779949">&lt;&lt;4. I want us to have fun.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me, too. In fact, I would say that having fun is our family&#39;s most important &quot;want&quot;. I notice that when we are having fun - or looking for the fun in everyday life  - well, we are happier, we are nicer to others, things flow better, we talk and share more.  The atmosphere of fun , of looking for joy, affects  all that we do...Leonie<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like this. It&#39;s silly when someone gets offended because everyone doesn&#39;t <br/>
care for their cooking. <br/>
My dh and kids are very honest, and I&#39;m glad because it helps me cook what <br/>
everyone likes most of the time.  They&#39;re very sweet when they don&#39;t like <br/>
something too....&quot;I&#39;m really glad you cooked this Mom, but I really don&#39;t care for <br/>
this recipe&quot;<br/>
They aren&#39;t made to eat things they don&#39;t like either...so there is a good <br/>
open communication and trust on both sides. And a huge willingness to try new <br/>
things.<br/>
I had all of them asking for squash the other day just because I cooked some <br/>
for myself.  A child forced to eat things would never have asked.<br/>
Jared found out he still doesn&#39;t like it, Jalen finished the rest of the <br/>
bowl!!<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;Another table rule of ours: taste everything on your plate. If<br/>
there&#39;s something you don&#39;t like, you don&#39;t have to eat it. But at<br/>
least taste it. I&#39;ve learned what&#39;s &quot;edible&quot; around here, and what<br/>
isn&#39;t, but trying things is a good habit, IMO. If it&#39;s yucky, I have<br/>
no problem with them saying so.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ewwww. I don&#39;t like this rule at all. I eat pretty much everything. But<br/>
there are a few things I can think of that I just wouldn&#39;t want to try. Lets<br/>
say oysters. I don&#39;t want to try them at all. I don&#39;t even want to look at<br/>
them. I can&#39;t imagine how I would feel going to someone&#39;s house and have<br/>
them tell I had to at least take a taste. Screw you!!!<br/>
<br/>
Now maybe the food you have isn&#39;t near like an oyster if you don&#39;t like the<br/>
looks of it. But to a kid, some food can look so much worse. I don&#39;t think<br/>
it&#39;s fair to make them try it. Just being made to do it can make it so that<br/>
if they would like it, the won&#39;t. Kids tastes change a lot but given their<br/>
own time and inclination to do so. Joseph and Tara are what some would call<br/>
picky eaters. They don&#39;t eat things now they use to but they eat a lot more<br/>
now than they ever did. Not because I made them taste anything. They did<br/>
what felt right to them.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who has a very controlling rigid husband. I&#39;ve seen him go<br/>
off on their son and he scares me. She was telling me how when they went to<br/>
Universal, they made him go on rides he was afraid of. That they didn&#39;t<br/>
travel all that way and spend that much money ot have him be afraid. I let<br/>
her know that I thought that was awful. She said he enjoyed the rides after<br/>
though. So I said, &quot;And wonder if it he didn&#39;t like it and was traumatized<br/>
by something you made him do?&quot; Her response was that he would get over it<br/>
and it didn&#39;t kill him.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oysters are yucky, to be sure. I know, because I&#39;ve tried them. Now, <br/>
if I was at a friend&#39;s house, or my mom&#39;s, and oyster stew were <br/>
offered, I&#39;d try it. I&#39;d take one small spoonful, and I&#39;d take one <br/>
bite, to see if oysters make oyster stew taste icky. <br/>
<br/>
Dunno if I&#39;d make the kids taste it, either. Maybe, let them have a <br/>
little taste from my small spoonful. What if they like it? <br/>
<br/>
the main thing is, helping them develop a palate that is capable of <br/>
taking in new things. Not forcing them to eat stuff they hate, just <br/>
not letting them always refuse things just because the food looks <br/>
different than what they are used to.<br/>

What is your goal here?   Do you think if you don&#39;t make them taste<br/>
certain foods they will never, ever try them?    Do you think that their<br/>
time with you is the only opportunity they will ever have to try a<br/>
certain food?<br/>
And what if they never eat haggis?   How will that ruin their lives?<br/>

Do you make them try on shoes they don&#39;t like?  Do you make them read<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Deb<br/>
<br/>
You make some good points. My main goal in having the kids taste <br/>
foods, is so that they don&#39;t turn something away just because it&#39;s <br/>
new. Trying new things. Educating their palates.<br/>
But also know, I don&#39;t force this. We&#39;ve just never had a power <br/>
struggle over it. First of all, we don&#39;t eat every meal together, nor <br/>
even every dinner. At a buffet, they choose what they want. I don&#39;t <br/>
hover over them making them take a little of everything. <br/>
<br/>
At Gramma&#39;s, or as guests at someone else&#39;s house, or sometimes when <br/>
I try a new recipe, if the cook has spent time making something that <br/>
they don&#39;t think looks good...if they take a bite, they will have <br/>
tested it out, and then they&#39;ll know whether it is tasty or not. At <br/>
the very least, tasting it shows respect for the person who worked to <br/>
prepare it. And...they might find it delicious.<br/>

So do I understand you that you never ever say to the kids now, &quot;just take<br/>
one taste to see if you like it.&quot; You mentioned it one time when they were<br/>
little and they taste everything new all on their own?<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s how it goes, then fine. If you mention it every time or even every<br/>
now and then, it&#39;s not doen on their own. It&#39;s something they do because<br/>
they know you want them to do it. I think Deb was mentioning about having<br/>
the faith that kids will try all sorts of things and make great choices if<br/>
you allow them to. Not just because you want them to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But I would also say to my husband or friend, &quot;try this, you might like it&quot; <br/>
if there were something new or different offered and he/they had gotten any, <br/>
they might have just over looked it.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that they way it is with LOTS of new things?  We see/hear/taste <br/>
something that we think our children MIGHT enjoy so we tell them about it and let <br/>
them make their own decision?<br/>
<br/>
I understand the uproar if one is FORCED to try/do/eat something they don&#39;t <br/>
want.  Merely suggestions that one might enjoy it is also not a good thing?<br/>
<br/>
If someone had not suggested to me that unschooling seemed a lot like what I <br/>
did already I would never have even known to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
A rule about trying every single thing is probably too much because it&#39;s a <br/>
rule of course.  But in general I think it&#39;s good for mothers to expose their <br/>
children to many different things, food included.<br/>
<br/>
If the child is opposed and doesn&#39;t want it I can see the point.  I can also <br/>
see that one might offer and suggest and even slightly cajole another person, <br/>
child or friend or spouse into trying something new that they feel might be <br/>
enjoyable.  If said person doesn&#39;t like it, they don&#39;t like it period but if you <br/>
haven&#39;t tried it you really don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Of course there are always exceptions to everything and one would know best <br/>
about handling one&#39;s own children and their responses to being <br/>
offered/suggested something, mostly anyway the mothers here.<br/>

foods, is so that they don&#39;t turn something away just because it&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
Would they really go their whole lives never trying new things if you<br/>
didn&#39;t require it in their child hood?<br/>
<br/>
But really Heidi, what if they never eat a turnip?   The world will keep<br/>
on turning, the sun will still shine.   Are you insisting they try bugs<br/>
because some cultures eat those?   Are you asking them to try dog because<br/>
they might end up in the Philippines someday?  (please say no!) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***Educating their palates.***<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to educate their palates.   They have palates, they will<br/>
eat.    Having things available because you or another family member<br/>
enjoys them will give your kids ample opportunity to try new things when<br/>
they want, without the rule. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309599662">&lt;&lt;At Gramma&#39;s, or as guests at someone else&#39;s house, or sometimes when<br/>
I try a new recipe, if the cook has spent time making something that<br/>
they don&#39;t think looks good...if they take a bite, they will have<br/>
tested it out, and then they&#39;ll know whether it is tasty or not. At<br/>
the very least, tasting it shows respect for the person who worked to<br/>
prepare it. And...they might find it delicious.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read this several times and something about it was eating at me, but I <br/>
couldn&#39;t put my finger on it.  I finally got it.  It seems like the <br/>
underlying goal is to push the kids into little praise giving robots.  Thank <br/>
the hostess, praise the food, respect so-and-so.  Rather than being truly <br/>
thankful, truly enjoying the food, they are made to.  I&#39;d rather watch a kid <br/>
leave something gross looking off his plate, rather than force a tiny bit <br/>
down and lie to the hostess by thanking her for food he thinks is repulsive. <br/>
  LOL  I&#39;ve been there...as an adult even!  I&#39;m very picky about textures in <br/>
particular.  I&#39;ve never been in a situation where there wasn&#39;t anything I <br/>
would eat, so I load up on the good stuff and offer my heartfelt thanks for <br/>
the things I truly enjoyed.  I&#39;ve never encountered anyone who was offended <br/>
that I didn&#39;t try everything.  And I&#39;ve been to a LOT of meals provided by <br/>
other people.  I can&#39;t stand most chinese food, so I load up on rice and a <br/>
few (very few) other choice items.  I have had another adult suggest I try <br/>
such-and-such but I reply, OH, this rice and whatnot is SO good I don&#39;t have <br/>
room for anything else!  This is so wonderful!  I mean it, too, and I <br/>
haven&#39;t offended anyone yet! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It seems like you want your children to be respectful, thankful beings, but <br/>
what&#39;s missing is genuine sincerity.  You can&#39;t insist that they be <br/>
respectful of others or thankful for their offerings.  That is something <br/>
earned and your children will give their thanks and respect freely to those <br/>
who deserve it.  I mean, if the food and service is horrible but the hostess <br/>
worked for hours to prepare the meal, I wouldn&#39;t thank her!  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
expect my kids to either.  That&#39;s kind of extreme but it happens!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s amazing how huge the shift has been for you in the past few <br/>
days.  I feel confident that if you ease up and begin to enjoy meals without <br/>
worrying how much *work* they are for you or what the kids will or won&#39;t <br/>
like, or how thankful and proper they are, you will be amazed at what a joy <br/>
mealtimes can be!  (Yes, even if you thought they *were* joyful to begin <br/>
with!)<br/>

Right.<br/>
<br/>
I get the sense that it&#39;s important for the poster to feel appreciated.<br/>
That&#39;s a whole &#39;nother issue than living respectfully and happily with<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
There was a post, which I can&#39;t find now, about being excused from the<br/>
table and expressing appreciation to the cook for the meal.<br/>
<br/>
When I cook for my family I don&#39;t do it to get praise or acknowledgement.<br/>
  I do it because I&#39;m the one can throw something good together pretty<br/>
quickly and easily and because we all need to eat. <br/>
I *do* like doing nice things for my family.  I love them and want them<br/>
to be happy.  I do it because I want them to feel good.   I don&#39;t do it<br/>
because I want them to feel good about ME.<br/>
<br/>
When you give someone a gift is it because you hope to impress them, or<br/>
because you knew they&#39;d love it?<br/>
It&#39;s different, the motivation is different and one seems less healthy to<br/>
me than the other.<br/>
<br/>
If we tie our emotional needs to the gifts we give our family and they<br/>
become aware of that tie, what will our kids believe when we don&#39;t feel<br/>
like cooking?   Will they think it&#39;s because we&#39;ve stopped loving them? <br/>
Will they consider it a punishment?   It seems manipulative to me.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see it as respect to taste something I might not like, don&#39;t like<br/>
the looks/smell of. Just seems weird to me to do something I don&#39;t want to<br/>
do to show respect to someone else.  If I were eating at someone&#39;s house I<br/>
would just not take what didn&#39;t appeal to me. If asked if I wanted some I<br/>
would say no thank you. If asked again why I would stated that I really<br/>
don&#39;t care for it. I have never had someone say oh just try it anyway. I<br/>
would balk at that bit time anyway. If it&#39;s something I see and don&#39;t know<br/>
what it is, I&#39;ll ask and then try it if I want to. I have made food at my<br/>
house that some won&#39;t eat and don&#39;t feel offended at all. I feel bad if<br/>
someone comes to my house and catches a cold from us let alone eat something<br/>
they didn&#39;t really like or that made them sick. I just don&#39;t see doing so as<br/>
a sign of respect. I would respect more their honesty.<br/>

What I&#39;ve told my kids since they were little was &quot;Say something nice.&quot;  I <br/>
didn&#39;t specify what, but they overheard enough of me and Keith saying something <br/>
nice to figure it out, and sometimes they asked specifically things like &quot;Mom, <br/>
I didn&#39;t really have very  much fun, what can I say?&quot;  And I&#39;ll ask what they <br/>
liked best, and we work from that.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples of &quot;something nice&quot; when maybe the food wasn&#39;t good or things <br/>
didn&#39;t go well:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thanks for inviting me!&quot;<br/>
&quot;Thanks for having us over.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Happy birthday!&quot; (again)<br/>
&quot;I really enjoyed playing with your dog.&quot;<br/>
&quot;That new game you got was really fun.  Maybe you could bring it over to my <br/>

  Thats what we do too.  I make a meal, and if they don&#39;t want it, they dont have to eat it.  They can make something else if they want to.  My only request is that *they* be the ones to make whatever it is, since I&#39;ve already cooked a meal.<br/>
