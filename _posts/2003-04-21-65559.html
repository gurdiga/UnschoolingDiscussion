<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675806766">I watched the DVD - it&#39;s like an unschooling-production.  The studio gave the director 100% freedom!  Classic!  So was Am. Graffiti!!<br/>

That movie really affected me when I saw it in junior high. Recently watched<br/>
it with my kids and they were sad about it for days. They really felt for<br/>
the little robot guy. It&#39;s also amazing to see how far Sci Fi movies have<br/>
come in just a generation.<br/>
