<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600827280">Last night I was flipping through a book at B & N and spotted Sandra&#39;s name. <br/>
I read the story about Sandra&#39;s sister and Homeschooling her own children. How <br/>
Sandra&#39;s had finally gotten to the point where she needed to tell her you <br/>
know what I am going to Say! Maybe not exact words (sorry Sandra) but it really <br/>
hit home for me because I have a sister who keeps calling me with school <br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
I dont mind, I want to hear them.  <br/>
I told her yesterday when the school called and suspended (last day of <br/>
school) her daughter for *play* fighting with a friend that she knew what I was <br/>
going to say. Then she told me her son was suspended Monday for missing 64 <br/>
detentions.  64! Evidently most of them for being late for school.<br/>
So then her son tells me today that he thinks its great that he is glad they <br/>
did so can do his Drivers Ed faster.  Brilliant kid too bad the school is <br/>
ruining<br/>
<br/>
She tells me she cant HS cuz she works and the kids will get into mischief. I <br/>
just don&#39;t know what to say to that.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say to that statement?<br/>
<br/>
So anyway I thought it was pretty cool that Sandra&#39;s name was in the book. I <br/>
wish I could remember the name of it. It was a question and answer book on Hs. <br/>

<br/>
Interesting!  There are critical reviews at Amazon from people complaining <br/>
that it&#39;s too radical or too unschoolingish.&lt;g&gt;  (Positive reviews too, though.)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I read this article and I loved it.  I&#39;ve also made the comment about <br/>
school being optional to principals in the past.  It causes problems, BIG <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
In fifth grade it was brought to my attention for about the fifth time that <br/>
my child had TOO many absences.  This was in Feb. and she had missed about <br/>
sixty days or so and they felt they were going to HAVE to report me to the <br/>
&quot;proper&quot; agency if she missed even one more day.  I asked them WHY?  They (five <br/>
people) went on to spin a tale of how it was adversely affecting her school life <br/>
and just simply wasn&#39;t good for her and wouldn&#39;t be tolerated any longer.  I <br/>
said open up the grade book, she had not one mark that was lower than <br/>
outstanding.  So I pointed this out and asked EXACTLY how it was affecting her so <br/>
adversely.  They couldn&#39;t say anything other than the &quot;party line&quot; that it was <br/>
detrimental to learning if she was only there one day a week or sometimes none or <br/>
sometimes three.  They reiterated that school was NOT optional and attendance <br/>
was required to pass to the next grade.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I didn&#39;t seem &quot;moved&quot; enough by their pleas to do what was BEST for <br/>
my child, so next report card, to get my attention and my child&#39;s, they put <br/>
failing grades on EVERY subject.  My child cried all the way home and all <br/>
evening.  No matter how much I tried to tell her it didn&#39;t matter.  I went in for the <br/>
obligatory conference and indeed she had still done &quot;outstanding&quot; on her work <br/>
and nothing was &quot;missing&quot; but they felt they needed to &quot;make a point!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make MY point that if she could stay &quot;caught up&quot; by attending only <br/>
one day a week more or less what did it say about their school system or more <br/>
clearly her classroom?  There wasn&#39;t anything more challenging for her to do <br/>
and they didn&#39;t try to make anything more challenging.  So we did LOTS of <br/>
things on our own on the days she didn&#39;t attend school, something&#39;s that she <br/>
brought back and shared on days she was there and other students then got to <br/>
experience through her.<br/>
<br/>
They had no answer for being able to attend once a week more or less and <br/>
still be on target with the rest of the class.  The only thing I could figure out <br/>
was that she didn&#39;t really need to be there at all.<br/>
<br/>
Took a while longer to convince DH that school was not necessary and even my <br/>
daughter LIKED the once or twice a week interaction with the kids and even the <br/>
teacher but we didn&#39;t like being told what was BEST for her.<br/>
<br/>
She LOVES being home all the time now, she said sometimes she does miss the <br/>
social aspect of it but she still goes to ball games and dances and stuff, but <br/>
I think she&#39;d like to meet more kids her age and not have to actively seek <br/>
them out.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, back to the topic of telling you that I really enjoyed reading the <br/>
story of your sister and how things naturally fell into place for her and her <br/>
children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>AH! my favorite article! I can remember finding this book(the first <br/>
edition, which is just as good as the newer) on the discard/sale <br/>
shelf at the library. I got it for 50 cents. I didn&#39;t know it was so <br/>
unschoolish, and gobbled it up as I started to read. I didn&#39;t realize <br/>
the same Sandra that I had read at unschooling.com was in this book <br/>
until I was reading it. <br/>
<br/>
I remember when the link to the schoolchoice article was broken, and <br/>
I emailed sandra asking was it the same as the one in my book. When <br/>
the link was fixed, I printed it out, and it took me awhile to get <br/>
it. Now it&#39;s my fave.  The book is also one of my faves, and I put it <br/>
on my recommended reading list for unschooling. I think it makes <br/>
unschooling approachable to folks who wouldn&#39;t go out and read the <br/>
Unschooling Handbook. <br/>
<br/>
Such fond memories &lt;&lt;g&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps their point was that lying for the benefit of the school budget was <br/>
fine, regardless of putting a child&#39;s whole self worth at risk. This is a prime <br/>
example of why children learn not to trust adults. This was clearly an adult <br/>
battle where the system hung the child out to dry. She&#39;s lucky to have you for <br/>
a mom though. <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Rhonda<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Sandra: your article was great!!!<br/>
