&gt; they&#39;ll see dollar signs and say &quot;Come on down!&quot;  (Though &quot;just&quot; a visit <br/>

held a great mystique for Hannah, so I thought a 1/2 day visit would be <br/>
perfect.  I contacted a friend in a small town (all the big towns have all <br/>
day kinder) and asked her to request permission from her dd&#39;s teacher.  She <br/>
explained the whole *homeschooler curious about school* idea and the <br/>
teacher&#39;s response was, &quot;No, she can&#39;t come to visit.  If we let her come, <br/>
then they&#39;ll all want to!&quot;  hee hee hee I guess they don&#39;t want us *all* <br/>
afterall!!  <br/>
