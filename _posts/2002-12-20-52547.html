<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301832482">I would take those &quot;studies&quot; with a grain of salt, because you never <br/>
know whose financial interests are behind them. They can be very biased. <br/>
That&#39;s why I trust homeopathic provings. They deal with the substance <br/>
more directly and show what it can cause (and therefore cure).<br/>
<br/>
It is known in homeopathy that coffee can prevent (or dissolve) stones, <br/>
both gallstones and kidney stones, but is it worth the price? I&#39;d rather <br/>
take it in homeopathic form and leave my liver alone.<br/>
<br/>
About making women smarter... Hmm, I don&#39;t know. Why would it work on <br/>
women only? And what is &quot;smarter,&quot; according to this article, having <br/>
good memory? The article also says that hormone replacement therapy <br/>
enhances brain power. Yes, but at what price again? It causes cancer.<br/>

powdered goat milk.<br/>

I just don&#39;t know how to give it up because I soooo love the smell of <br/>
a good cup of coffee in the morning or after a good meal. I have <br/>

That said, everything you said about coffee is true but so it is for <br/>
sugar, additives, hydrogenated fats and refined starches. You might <br/>
as well call them the staples of the US food industry --the fact that <br/>
they call it food manufacturing and not cooking, just explains a lot.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964975866">Yeah, that is because, like I said before, if coffee can produce asthma it can cure it too. Allopaths have sometimes encountered those principles homeopaths have know for 2 centuries without knowing how or why. The problem I see with giving the crude substance is that it is more toxic and harsh than necessary to cure. So, it&#39;s a shock that suppresse the symptoms for a while but doesn&#39;t cure the person. You&#39;d have to keep giving the substance over and over until it doesn&#39;t work at all. <br/>
Same thing with inhalers and such, except that those are not similar at all, like coffee in this case.<br/>
