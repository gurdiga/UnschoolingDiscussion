 </span></blockquote>I hope to be there Friday for at least one of the talks and the potluck. And<br/>
I totally sympathize about the name thing. Except I can&#39;t blame it on age,<br/>
I&#39;ve always had a hard time remembering all kinds of names - people, places,<br/>
roads, actors in movies, names of books, etc. The minute I need to recall<br/>
them, they just go &lt;poof&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-601407229">Hi David,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m an Oregonian and plan on coming to hear you speak in Tigard.  I&#39;ll introduce myself if I can overcome my shyness.  :)  Truly - not sarcastic.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to it.<br/>

Nicholina, you could slip him a note.  <br/>
David&#39;s really easy to talk to, and although he moves pretty quickly, he&#39;ll <br/>
probably sit at a table with his books sometimes, so you can approach him in a <br/>
still place.  <br/>
