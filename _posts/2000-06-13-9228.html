Hi Bridget,  Just curious...do you know where in Ireland?  My  mother&#39;s dad&#39;s <br/>
family are of Irish descent.    My mom&#39;s maiden name is Bryan.  My paternal <br/>
grandmother&#39;s family are Scots.  My ancestors are highlanders from the outer <br/>
Hebrides area,  known as the McKensie clan.  I would love to travel there one <br/>
day!  ~Karen</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1783888688">Not first name, but all of our kids will have my family name (Caffrey)<br/>
as their middle name. I think it&#39;s hard enuf coming up with a unique<br/>
first name for each child, I can&#39;t imagine having to come up with middle<br/>
ones too, lol! Bridget was the *only* name, of either gender, that we<br/>
both loved :-) (I was in labor and we still hadn&#39;t settled on a boy&#39;s<br/>
name so thank goodness she was a she!). We joke that our future children<br/>
will be &quot;Girl #2&quot; and &quot;The Boy&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
Plus, I really do like the family history feel of it. I changed my name<br/>
and had no problem doing so, but I didn&#39;t want to let it go completely.<br/>
This way it gets carried on a bit and I like that. <br/>

There was already a MacKenzie in the family on my dh&#39;s side, so we came up <br/>
with our own variation.  I am unsure as to where my family come from in <br/>
Ireland.  My dad&#39;s father&#39;s family are of English descent, and my maiden name <br/>
is Tillery.  I am very interested in genealogy, and plan to learn as much as <br/>
I can.  ~Karen</div>

How many littles do you have? My dh and I have 4:13 yob, 8 yob, 5 yob, and 19 <br/>
month old girl. My Irish-born dad told me if I ever want to get to Ireland he <br/>
would love to help pay for me but he cannot afford the airfare for all these <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788035756">Hi Bridget,  I have a son that will be 6 in Sept, a son that will be 4 in <br/>
Nov, and a 9mo daughter who is definitely sure she needs to be doing whatever <br/>
her big brothers are!  LOL!  :)  She still can&#39;t tolerate her car seat for <br/>
much more than an hour at the time before needing to get out, unless she <br/>
falls asleep in it, and we all count ourselves lucky!  We recently drove from <br/>
Evansville ,In, to Louisville, Ky.  She did so much better than I thought she <br/>
would have, and she did sleep about half of the way of the 2 hr trip.  Then <br/>
we flew from Louisville to Birmingham, Ala, which was an hr&#39;s flight.  She <br/>
did not have to be in a car seat, so she enjoyed it, and still napped some on <br/>
the flight even!   :)  I don&#39;t think she&#39;s ready to handle international <br/>
flights yet, though.  I wonder which one of us would be the most worn out!  <br/>
hee hee  But, definitely, one day for sure, we will make that great trip to <br/>
Scotland and Ireland! ~Karen</div>

they said let&#39;s just call him jeremiah if it is a boy, mommy. it grew on me <br/>
