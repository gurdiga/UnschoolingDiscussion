<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580126670">Some of the questions asked often are &quot;What&#39;s a typical unschooling day?&quot; and &quot;What about socialization?<br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of blogs you might want to read, and that might be good to pass on to others who ask.  Some people aren&#39;t ready for serious discussions.  I think Rippy&#39;s right, and serious discussions can make a profound difference in people&#39;s lives, but what about those who just want to peek at some info and then think about it on their own?<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://honeyhousekindgarden.blogspot.com/">http://honeyhousekindgarden.blogspot.com/</a> has descriptions of days with a young unschooler, and nice photos, too.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jennifermcgrail.com/2011/01/why-my-kids-will-never-be-socialized/">http://www.jennifermcgrail.com/2011/01/why-my-kids-will-never-be-socialized/</a> is a great blog post with a busy, happy, indirect answer to the socialization question.<br/>
That same blog has a good unschooling FAQ from a Christian point of view (and so includes the question Christians probably get most, which is whether it&#39;s possible for Christians to unschool).<br/>

On my own site, I have a typical days section left over from the days before there were blogs. :-)  (And there are some more recent entries, too.)<br/>

And here&#39;s my socialization collection.  I think I&#39;ll add that one from up above (as a link) there. <br/>
