<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840729328">One more point that needs to be made is that, as far as written <br/>
language systems go, English sucks! We have a phonemic alphabet <br/>
system, right? Ideally, this would mean that each letter-symbol would <br/>
represent a single sound. Except, many letters have more than one <br/>
possible sound, and when you put two letters together you get <br/>
digraphs that represent different sounds, and even then there is more <br/>
than one possible way for those to sound. LOL! Sometimes I wonder how <br/>
any of us figured this crazy system out!<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that English is not an original language, but a highly <br/>
derivative one. It is in fact a truly hodge-podge language, with <br/>
words from all different other languages thrown together. And for <br/>
some inexplicable reason, when words did come from other languages, <br/>
instead of being transliterated into a common &quot;English&quot; spelling <br/>
system, they were pretty much allowed to keep their original <br/>
spellings, and since those other languages were based on different <br/>
phonemic systems we now have a language where some words are <br/>
following French rules, some German, some Latin, some Greek, etc. <br/>
etc...<br/>
<br/>
All of this makes the English language &quot;code&quot; extremely difficult to <br/>
crack, because what you end up with are so many exceptions to <br/>
the &quot;rules&quot; that the rules become almost meaningless. Not even the <br/>
infamous &quot;i before e except after c&quot; rule is foolproof--neighbor and <br/>
weigh and sleigh, LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
I love the concept behind modern written Turkish, invented in the <br/>
1920s to replace the old Arabic script based system. Each letter has <br/>
one and only one possible sound, one letter for each sound present in <br/>
spoken Turkish, and there are none of those pesky digraphs and weird <br/>
stuff like silent letters. Why can&#39;t English be like that?? Let&#39;s <br/>
just do what the Turks did and throw out this old written system that <br/>
doesn&#39;t represent our spoken language well and come up with a better-<br/>
tailored set of symbols, and a more reliable batch of spelling and <br/>
pronunciation rules to go along with them, LOL!! <br/>
<br/>
On a more serious note, The beautiful simplicity of the modern <br/>
written Turkish scheme allowed literally millions of previously <br/>
illiterate citizens to learn to read in a matter of months. It was <br/>
one of Ataturk&#39;s lasting achievements, to bring mass literacy to a <br/>
land that had previously been largely illiterate. Even today, Turkish <br/>
children spend far less time learning how to read than American kids <br/>
do. I guarantee you that if written English made as much sense as <br/>
written Turkish does, that more kids would learn to read faster and <br/>
sooner, and that levels of dyslexia and other related &quot;reading <br/>
disabilities&quot; amongst children would drop dramatically.<br/>
<br/>
But of course, barring a fullblown revolution like what happened in <br/>
Turkey in the 1920s, I suppose nobody is going to be changing our <br/>
system anytime soon, so we just have to deal with it. Just remember <br/>
that many people who have difficulty with spelling and reading are <br/>
actually really bright--their problem may just be that they are <br/>
highly sensible, and written English just doesn&#39;t make sense <br/>
sometimes!! ;)<br/>

example of this. Unlike with English, where you can go back and <br/>
directly trace Old English to Germanic, when you trace back the <br/>
development of Turkish language you find only older and older <br/>
versions of Turkish.  I think that Chinese and Japanese also fit this <br/>
definition, but I&#39;ll have to double-check that. There are also dozens <br/>
of languages which are classified as &quot;isolates&quot;, because not only can <br/>
they not be directly traced to another language, they can&#39;t even be <br/>
linked to one of the theoretical &quot;proto-languages&quot; that are used to <br/>
put languages into families. Korean is the most notable example...<br/>

<br/>
Languages vary greatly in their degree of complexity. English <br/>
certainly ranks up there as amongst the most difficult, but there are <br/>
other languages which are even harder to learn. I think that Arabic <br/>
and Chinese are both more difficult, for instance...<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me--what do you think of this??<br/>

Brain buzz that proves Chinese is harder to learn than English <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, not really, that&#39;s the point.  Old English is a direct descendent <br/>
of Germanic. Turkic (which is really the term I should be using here) <br/>
is a direct descendent of...older and older forms of Turkic. The only <br/>
thing that can be said about Turkic is that it can be presumed to <br/>
have originally branched off from a theoretical &quot;proto-Altaic&quot; <br/>
language, hence it is grouped into the Altaic language family with <br/>
Mongolian and Tungus. &quot;Original&quot; languages can be tied to theoretical <br/>
proto-languages; other languages such as Korean are true <br/>
language &quot;isolates&quot;, not fitting into any of the established language <br/>
families at all.<br/>
<br/>
English isn&#39;t a direct descendent of a proto-language, it&#39;s further <br/>
down the evolutionary scale so to speak. All evidence we have seems <br/>
to suggest that Turkic is in fact a direct offshoot of a proto-<br/>
language. That&#39;s the difference I was trying to state.<br/>
<br/>
Now obviously, Modern Turkish has been heavily influenced by <br/>
neighboring languages such as Arabic and Persian. So in that respect <br/>
at least, one can certainly say that Turkish is a bit hodgepodgey. <br/>
But we&#39;re not talking about prevalence of loan words here, we&#39;re <br/>
talking about the actual &quot;genetic&quot; makeup of the languages, the basic <br/>
grammatical structure and core vocabulary. In that respect again, <br/>
Turkic languages are a much &quot;purer&quot; languages than English ones are.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, as you pointed out, nobody knows any of this stuff about <br/>
language evolution *for sure*, just like we don&#39;t know the exact path <br/>
of human evolution *for sure* either; but, based on what knowledge <br/>
and reseach we have available, both evolutionary theories are the <br/>
best that we&#39;ve got to work with at this time.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ooooh good one, I always write &quot;nite.&quot; I once wrote an email to several <br/>
friends and included my mom and sister. Well needless to say, my mom called me on <br/>
it. She thought I was having major brainfarts and asked what was wrong with me. <br/>
She wasn&#39;t being mean, I have these odd memory/neurotransmitter dysfunctions <br/>
and she was concerned. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Then there is that ...LOL. Around here, when someone makes a &quot;not at all <br/>
funny&quot; funny, we say L-O-L. As in it really isn&#39;t &quot;laugh out loud&quot; funny. <br/>
<br/>
Lastly, about a month or so ago, my sister was at our mom&#39;s house, online, <br/>
researching something, when I IM&#39;d her. Something was said by them and I typed <br/>
in &quot;ROFLMAO.&quot;  You&#39;d have thought we were doing &quot;who&#39;s on first.&quot; I kept typing <br/>
it as I was really laughing hard and thought I&#39;d pee my pants. So when they <br/>
asked what it meant I said, &quot;Rolling on Floor, Laughing My Ass Off&quot; They told <br/>
me they were laughing to, but what was &quot;ROFLMAO.&quot; We went back and forth <br/>
probably 10 times, only causing me to laugh harder. Little sis told me to stop being <br/>
such an internet bitch, and just explain the acronym!!! At that point in time <br/>
I did fall out of my chair. I was laughing so hard, tears were flowing from <br/>
my eyes. Then Phil and the girls came in to find me on the floor, crying. They <br/>
all got hysterical and thought I was stroking. Even remembering it now makes <br/>
me laugh all over again. They were just about to call 911, when I stopped <br/>
hyper-venthilating enough to tell them I was laughing. They were really pissed. So, <br/>
I had DH and DD&#39;s mad at me in my bedroom and my mom and sister mad at me at <br/>
mom&#39;s house, all over internet lingo. Finally I called my mom and explained. I <br/>
told them to go back to the first time I explained the acronym and seconds <br/>
later, I could hear the two of them ROFLTAO - Rolling on floor laughing THEIR <br/>
ass&#39; off. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you had to be there, but that was the time that internet language got <br/>
my ass in trouble!!!<br/>
