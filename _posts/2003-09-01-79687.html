<div id="ygrps-yiv-1780498509">Hello dear listmates-<br/>
So many thoughts have come into my head while following this thread. Here<br/>
are some -<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to make all decisions without the money factor playing such a<br/>
huge part in the dialogue (either an internal dialogue or one with my<br/>
children) . . . If we make our decisions with money being the issue, we<br/>
usually are acting out of fear that we will never replace that money. We<br/>
effectively close down our hearts to the process. I doubt anyone here would<br/>
really care about a course or sport dropped if they had not plunked down<br/>
good, hard-earned money for the activity. (well, maybe some would). I find<br/>
the more energy I give to the financial portion of my life, the more<br/>
elusive the funds become. When I operate out of integrity and clarity as to<br/>
the appropriate decision, not focusing on the money aspect, I am always<br/>
more content with the outcome, even if it means losing money. Money is just<br/>
that - only money. My relationships with my children, and their happiness<br/>
are way more important to me. And, yes, I have had my children drop<br/>
activities they did not enjoy that cost money  and I have left a rental<br/>
without proper notice, gotten a divorce, and, inadvertently, been late<br/>
and/or not shown up for an appointment! And, on the other end, I have been<br/>
the one who has had guests at my B&Bs cancel (sometimes for good reasons,<br/>
sometimes not) and I have had to make judgement calls on refunding their<br/>
deposits or not . .  .so, I&#39;ve had to suck it up sometimes, and so have<br/>
they - all depending on the appropriateness of the situation. . . not<br/>
strictly on the money aspect.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of being partners with our children, not adversaries cannot be<br/>
over-emphasized. Do my children always clean up after eating or after a<br/>
project? Absolutely not. Do I ask for their participation? Usually.<br/>
Sometimes it is in my flow to do it without disturbing their flow.<br/>
Examples: My 20 year old, Sky, just returned from a month-long adventure<br/>
away (another story!). Obviously, there was mountains of laundry to be<br/>
done. Now, while away, he managed to do all his laundry without my help.<br/>
But, it was my pleasure to do it for him upon his return. It came time to<br/>
hang it all on the line (2 loads) - he and I were hanging and talking.<br/>
&quot;Hey, Sky, I need to get these clothes on the line - let&#39;s keep talking and<br/>
do it together.&quot; &quot;Sure, Mom.&quot; Conversation did not miss a beat while we<br/>
worked side by side, hanging out the clothes. Thirteen year old son, Bay,<br/>
has just returned from dirt biking with friends - gear strewn all over the<br/>
shed, while he tinkers with the what-ja-jicket on his bike. . . &quot;Bay, can<br/>
you get this gear out of my way, it is in the middle of the lettuce we just<br/>
harvested.&quot; &quot;Let me just get this thingie cleaned, Mom, I&#39;ll do it in a<br/>
bit.&quot; Now, I had the choice then to hurumph and do it myself with attitude,<br/>
yell at him that it had to be done THEN, because it was my time frame, or<br/>
wait and let him do it. He did it - right after finishing what he was<br/>
focused on at the time. Nell, 16 year old daughter, has a habit of leaving<br/>
her clothes in a laundry basket at the foot of the stairs (she has the<br/>
upstairs bedroom). The basket overflows and often takes up the small hall<br/>
at the stairs often. &quot;Nell, the clothes monster is devoring the hall again,<br/>
honey - did you notice?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m on the way out to rehearsal, Mom, I&#39;ll do it<br/>
when I get home.&quot; Next morning, as tired daughter sleeps following a late<br/>
night long rehearsal, the clothes are still there, with more added on top.<br/>
I see them, scoop them up on my way upstairs to my office and fold them,<br/>
leaving them outside sleeping teenage girl&#39;s door. &quot;Thanks so much, Mom - I<br/>
was exhausted when I got home,&quot; comes the sleepy words from Nell with arms<br/>
around my neck while I work at the computer. The examples abound. I try not<br/>
to be a dictator around here. That is exhausting. And, yet, things get done<br/>
- and, yes, I do more than my &quot;share,&quot; I suppose. But, my children are all<br/>
responsible, honest, kind and actively involved in the home and all our<br/>
businesses. And no one resents their participation, because it is voluntary<br/>
and offered and requested with mutual respect. We have no contracts, no<br/>
chore lists. Just an intense love and clear way of being together.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive my rambling, but these thoughts have been running through my brain<br/>
while I&#39;ve read this discussion. I don&#39;t often post - but, I always read<br/>
and think. <br/>
<br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>
