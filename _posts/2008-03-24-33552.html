<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005688828">I apologize for this post on depression going thru so many times.  My computer once in a while has this issue, and I have had it looked at and &quot;fixed&quot;, but obviously, it was not.  Will take it to the doctor again. I don&#39;t mean to waste your time on the computer!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
SORRY <br/>
