<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307998321">Hey I just got this from one of my other groups!!  Just thought I would let you know!<br/>
<br/>
Looks like we will be fine!<br/>

Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m receiving many copies of an email purporting there to be a Yahoo <br/>
downtime from March 15-March 18.  This is NOT the case (though I <br/>
appreciate the heads up from those who were just trying to do a good deed <br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo UK will be down for that time, but at this point there has been no <br/>
indication that Yahoo US will suffer from the same problem.  Yahoo UK is <br/>
moving its servers to a different facility, hence the lengthy time to <br/>
break things down and get them up and running again.<br/>
<br/>
If you receive this message from a US based group, please let them know <br/>
it does not apply to Yahoo US groups.<br/>
