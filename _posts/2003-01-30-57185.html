the u.s.a. it doesn&#39;t mean you have to be poor or, for that matter,<br/>
american. the use of &#39;nigger&#39; is just one of those markers of class and<br/>
ethnicity for blacks in this country. it&#39;s just rare to hear a<br/>
brazilian, trinidadian or an african using the word (i live in nyc, so<br/>
the black population is hyper-diverse).&gt;&gt;<br/>

I never really thought of it that way, as in other countries not using that <br/>
word. Us americans can be a crude bunch.<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think people see that all blacks are poor? I don&#39;t see it that <br/>
way. I see that no matter who the person of color is, some people just don&#39;t <br/>
think they can be their equal and therefore find a way to degrade and knock <br/>
them down. My daughters father is extremely racist and I know just with him <br/>
and his family, they just don&#39;t see many people other than themselves <br/>
(Italian Americans) as being &quot;as good&quot;. They feel the same way about <br/>
hispanics, jews, blacks, asians, it&#39;s really pathetic.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing is, the daughter married a cuban and one son married a girl who <br/>
has a puerto rican child. Of course, those were the exceptions right? That&#39;s <br/>
their reasoning. Thank God my daugher is nothing like any of them and sees <br/>
how stupid they can all be. Of course it causes problems for us every now <br/>
and then as my daughter doesn&#39;t see color when deciding who to date. I&#39;ve <br/>
fought with her dad on this one a few times. He&#39;s a moron.<br/>
<br/>
My in laws are also prejudice and my husband is nothing like them. Not sure <br/>
what makes certain families stay with that mentality and others escape it.<br/>
