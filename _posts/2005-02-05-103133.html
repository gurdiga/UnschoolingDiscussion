For those participating in the bird count or anyone else for that matter,<br/>
an interesting article in the New York Times suggests birds are finally<br/>
getting the respect they deserve.   If the link doesn&#39;t work I can send<br/>
you the whole thing.  <br/>

We&#39;ve never done this but usually it gets mentioned each year. It&#39;s a<br/>
project that&#39;s been going on for 8 years managed by Cornell Lab of<br/>
Ornithology and the National Audubon Society.<br/>

It&#39;s a 4 day event -- Feb 18-21 -- to count and get to know your bird<br/>
neighbors :-) You don&#39;t need to do it all 4 days.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a tally sheet for each state (some states are divided into<br/>
smaller<br/>
pieces). And there&#39;s some tips on how to do it and some help on<br/>
identifying<br/>
some of the trickier ones.<br/>
