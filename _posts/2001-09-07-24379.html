<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295223908">&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;I love it that she reads so much&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would love it if one of my kids started reading more because there are <br/>
books I&#39;d like to share discussions about.<br/>
<br/>
Someday factors will probably change in the lives of my boys and they&#39;ll be <br/>
reading more.  My husband didn&#39;t start reading a lot of literature (novels, <br/>
fantasy, whatever) until he was away from his parents&#39; house.  He can read <br/>
for hours without looking up or stopping for food.<br/>
<br/>
But I love that my kids are learning, and I see them learning from hanging <br/>
out with their friends, from just thinking while they stack wood or put away <br/>
groceries, from making musical parody jokes with their sister in the car, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling participants and readers on this list don&#39;t bother me.  Answers <br/>
which go against unschooling bother me.  It&#39;s not the people, it&#39;s the <br/>
information (if that can make sense).  If &quot;relaxed homeschoolers&quot; read this <br/>
it might help them make the move to unschooling.  But if schoolish answers <br/>
are left without comment, the value of the list to new unschoolers isn&#39;t as <br/>
high.<br/>
<br/>
Note to anyone whose feelings are raw--I don&#39;t think anyone here is trying to <br/>
be critical of people or families, just of reasoning and justifications for <br/>
certain kinds of recommendations.  We&#39;re/I&#39;m trying to see what&#39;s behind <br/>
statements, and what&#39;s ahead if the statements are taken to their logical, <br/>
ultimate, behavioral ends.<br/>
<br/>
If someone came and told me that my fireplace was a fire hazard if I didn&#39;t <br/>
get a chimney cleaner more often since I&#39;m burning scrap wood and it&#39;s <br/>
gunkier, I would listen carefully and think about where I put that address.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be sitting there thinking &quot;What she&#39;s really saying is that I&#39;m <br/>
cheap and stupid and dumb and wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What she&#39;s really saying is probably that while I&#39;ve been happily running <br/>
around with my kids gathering scrap firewood I forgot to note how long it&#39;s <br/>
been since I called a chimneysweep, and that I really truly do NOT want to <br/>
burn my house down just because I&#39;m a space case about schedules.<br/>
<br/>
[And yes I DO  need to call a chimney cleaner guy...]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are thousands of reasons why Jenni&#39;s reading is better than<br/>
Wyndham&#39;s TV watching.  Some of them have to do with health.  Jenni will<br/>
read while walking.  Some of them are developmental issues that would<br/>
take a long time to explain here but I&#39;ll hunt down the data if you are<br/>
interested.  Some of the reasons have to do with content.  Jenni is<br/>
getting way more from her books than Wyndham is from his TV.  If he were<br/>
watching a better quality of TV it might not be as bad but even then the<br/>
other factors are still there.   And then there is the fact that Wyndham<br/>
has some behavioral issues that are made worse by inactivity.  That alone<br/>
would be enough to make me limit his viewing.<br/>
I will discourage Game Boy usage if the quantity is too high also.  But<br/>
that again is a health issue.  They need to get some physical activity.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1042003894">Ya know, maybe it is in the air or something but this is the third or maybe<br/>
forth post in as many days telling folks that they are on the wrong list or<br/>
that what they are doing isn&#39;t really unschooling, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think the list needs to also remember that not everyone came instantly to<br/>
unschooling.  Unschooling isn&#39;t instant coffee or tea that you drop in a<br/>
container and you get instant results from.  It might be better to not snipe<br/>
at folks or tell them to go elsewhere because they aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot;<br/>
unschoolers.  IMHO that is one sure fired way to send them running in the<br/>
opposite direction!I mean, like anything else, it can sometimes it takes<br/>
years for folks to get to the end of the journey.  Little steps, etc.  After<br/>
all one facet of unschooling is all about allowing the kidlets to be<br/>
individuals and to follow their own path, should this not also apply to the<br/>
adults and their journey to unschooling?  If it were your kids would you<br/>
tell them they got it wrong and they should hang it up and go elsewhere?<br/>

<br/>
I agree, but there&#39;s the consideration that on a list this big if someone who <br/>
knows nothing about unschooling comes and reads lots of posts by people who <br/>
aren&#39;t really unschooling, they won&#39;t know the difference even after weeks of <br/>
reading.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to find a balance, and each person&#39;s making this up on the fly too. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Those who make a strong, hard, critical recommendation which is seen as <br/>
potentially harmful to people on this list (whether it&#39;s letting kids stay up <br/>
all night with dirty hair or whether it&#39;s making them learn anatomy because <br/>
they said they liked the veterinarian&#39;s office, or wanting help on how to get <br/>
them through Saxon Math with some comfort), someone is likely to ask them to <br/>
consider WHY they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing.  (That someone might be me, <br/>
but it certainly isn&#39;t always me.)<br/>
<br/>
If there is a list out there which is marked &quot;unschooling&quot; and on which <br/>
people are supported equally whether they&#39;re unschooling or not, we should <br/>
give people that address if they want to call themselves unschoolers but not <br/>
really understand what it is.  There seem to be a lot of those people, and <br/>
really, if there&#39;s a &quot;relaxed unschoolers&quot; list which embraces unit studies <br/>
and &quot;all but math and writing,&quot; we should let people have the sign-up info!<br/>

You&#39;re attacking a straw man with that, and you DID say you would read a <br/>

<br/>
If you haven&#39;t tried unschooling without structure (and structured <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t), you don&#39;t really know what would happen if you did.  You <br/>
have judged without trying (as you did this list).<br/>

recommends anyone else sit back and watch their kids do absolutely <br/>
nothing. And what kid *would* do absolutely nothing, anyway? None <br/>
that I know. Kids are always busy doing stuff, even when they look <br/>
like they&#39;re not. Heck, I do some of my best work out by the garden, <br/>
laying in my swing chair, looking like I&#39;m asleep. But I&#39;m really <br/>
running over articles, columns, layout, trips to here and there, and <br/>
what color curtains I want in the bedroom! I&#39;m learning which birds <br/>
like what plants, which direction the wind comes from at certain <br/>
times of the day, and how long I can lay there without being <br/>
disturbed, which is never as long as I&#39;d like it to be... &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, parental control. One of my favorite topics. We control plenty of <br/>
what our kids do, isn&#39;t that our job as parents? We just don&#39;t <br/>
control what goes into their little heads, or when, in the same way <br/>
that schools do. But as much as I am able, I try to exert some <br/>
control over their lives, at least until it&#39;s clear to me that <br/>
they&#39;re ready and able to take over the controls themselves. Four of <br/>
our five have reached that point, but we&#39;ve still got one who&#39;s our <br/>
responsibility day in and day out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284696910">I don&#39;t think you give folks enough credit.  I really think most folks are<br/>
just a bit brighter than that!  Anyone who reads a post by someone who still<br/>
thinks in the ps or school at home mode will certainly immediately following<br/>
find a post where the offending posters are, in lots of instances,<br/>
immediately bashed for that thinking.  In other instances they are<br/>
&quot;corrected&quot; but the impression is never left that the majority of<br/>
unschoolers do things that way or that it is &quot;the&quot; unschooling way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the posts about schooling type things are going to give the<br/>
wrong impression or scare people off, IMHO the posts that follow those are<br/>
more likely to scare them off.<br/>
<br/>
Rigid statements such as &quot;this isn&#39;t the list for you&quot; as a first response<br/>
could be more effectively handled and perhaps bring about a change, by have<br/>
you considered or a question of why they feel they must do things in such a<br/>
manner.  Or stories of &quot;once upon a time I also thought . . .&quot; and continued<br/>
on to how a<br/>
change was made and the great results that were the result thereof.  And, of<br/>
course, recommending unschooling.com but in such a way that it is a<br/>

For moi, I&#39;d rather spent a little time and maybe convert them than to send<br/>
them away thinking this list is all about radical unschoolers, and believe<br/>
you me it isn&#39;t about radical unschoolers, not by a far stretch, and that<br/>
unschoolers are all rude and that isn&#39;t something they&#39;d want to have<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Unschooling isn&#39;t instant coffee or tea that you drop in a<br/>
&gt; container and you get instant results from.  It might be better to not<br/>
snipe<br/>
&gt; at folks or tell them to go elsewhere because they aren&#39;t &quot;real&quot;<br/>
&gt; unschoolers.  IMHO that is one sure fired way to send them running in the<br/>
<br/>
&gt; opposite direction! &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree, but there&#39;s the consideration that on a list this big if someone<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; knows nothing about unschooling comes and reads lots of posts by people<br/>
who<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t really unschooling, they won&#39;t know the difference even after weeks<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s hard to find a balance, and each person&#39;s making this up on the fly<br/>
too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those who make a strong, hard, critical recommendation which is seen as<br/>
&gt; potentially harmful to people on this list (whether it&#39;s letting kids stay<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; all night with dirty hair or whether it&#39;s making them learn anatomy<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; they said they liked the veterinarian&#39;s office, or wanting help on how to<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; them through Saxon Math with some comfort), someone is likely to ask them<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; consider WHY they&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing.  (That someone might be me,<br/>
&gt; but it certainly isn&#39;t always me.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If there is a list out there which is marked &quot;unschooling&quot; and on which<br/>
&gt; people are supported equally whether they&#39;re unschooling or not, we should<br/>
&gt; give people that address if they want to call themselves unschoolers but<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; really understand what it is.  There seem to be a lot of those people, and<br/>
&gt; really, if there&#39;s a &quot;relaxed unschoolers&quot; list which embraces unit<br/>
studies<br/>
&gt; and &quot;all but math and writing,&quot; we should let people have the sign-up<br/>
info!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I also suspect that there are those here who harbor a very narrow view<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; unschooling.  The impression I get is that they think I should sit back<br/>
&gt; &gt; and watch my kids do absolutely nothing because that&#39;s okay, they&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn anyway.  Well, it isn&#39;t.  I&#39;ve been homeschooling for 6 years now.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This is our seventh year.  There is no structure to our study but if I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don&#39;t set some rules and limits, Rachel will hole up in her room and let<br/>
&gt; &gt; her depression take her over despite the prozac and Wyndham is just<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wyndham and you have to meet him to understand.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If you have such a narrow view of unschooling that you cannot allow any<br/>
&gt; &gt; parental control at all, that makes you no better in my book than Mr.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648981551">&lt;&lt; Ezzo? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s much MUCH more out there, but this might should be enough to satisfy <br/>
the curiosity and to avoid further time on this list.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These professionals expressed disagreement with many of the childrearing <br/>
methods advocated by the Ezzos, and worry about the complete lack of credible <br/>
scientific foundation for the program.<br/>
Why has BABYWISE raised so many red flags for informed observers? Perhaps the <br/>
most hotly debated aspect of the program has to do with the Ezzos&#39; views on <br/>
routines for young children. BABYWISE admonishes parents to establish a <br/>
regular schedule for infants immediately after birth; they propose that an <br/>
unscheduled baby will lead to an undisciplined and difficult child with <br/>
&quot;metabolic chaos&quot; (a term not found in any medical literature). In the <br/>
religious version of the manual, the Ezzos strongly suggest that it is God&#39;s <br/>
will that infants eat, sleep, and play on an externally imposed schedule. <br/>
They write that God is a &quot;God of order.&quot; In fact, the subtitle of their <br/>
parenting curriculum is &quot;Growing Kids God&#39;s Way.&quot; The book insists that <br/>
scheduling an infant will actually help his nervous system to &quot;mature&quot; more <br/>
quickly. In BABYWISE, the Ezzos advocate something they refer to as <br/>
&quot;parent-directed feeding,&quot; in which infants, whether breast- or bottle-fed, <br/>
should be offered nourishment only every three hours or so as timed by the <br/>
parents. In earlier versions of the manual, parents were urged to wait at <br/>
least four hours between feedings. After vociferous outcry from the medical <br/>
community, the guidelines were modified. Still, according to BABYWISE, <br/>
&quot;demand feeding,&quot; the method currently advocated for infants by all major <br/>
medical organizations, is a faddish and child-centered practice that can only <br/>
lead to unhappy babies and mothers. Both GFI infant-care manuals advise that <br/>
demand-fed infants often grow into children who steal, who will be unable to <br/>
handle real life, and who will &quot;have difficulty with siblings and peers.&quot; Dr. <br/>
Robert Bucknam, the Denver-area pediatrician who co-authored BABYWISE with <br/>
the Ezzos, describes this alleged phenomenon: &quot;As they get older,&quot; said <br/>
Bucknam, &quot;every whine is an opportunity to feed. They become more demanding. <br/>
They become brats.&quot; Most child-health experts couldn&#39;t disagree more strongly<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In an interview with the Bradenton Herald (of Florida), Kearney discussed <br/>
the experiences she had working with a number of parents who were using the <br/>
Ezzo feeding program. In each case, babies were gaining weight slowly and <br/>
exhibiting signs of depression. Despite Kearney&#39;s professional advice to feed <br/>
the babies more often, these parents refused in accordance with the BABYWISE <br/>
schedule.&quot;<br/>

I exert some control, I am not unschooling.  So which is it?  I said from<br/>
the start that the kids control what when and how, I only dictate that<br/>
something get done, not what it is to be.  And those guidelines were set<br/>
up together, with their input.<br/>

   is   the first    year    my    kids   have   asked    for    some    <br/>
guidelines.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First time you said &quot;unschooling&quot; on the hoe many years.  Before you said <br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; (and I thought it was five years, but the posts have been <br/>
flying fast).<br/>
<br/>
If you &quot;accidently&quot; unplug something and admit it, your credibility is harmed <br/>
in other ways as well.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You obviously have not met Wyndham.  He is addicted to TV the way people<br/>
are addicted to gambling.  It isn&#39;t that he has nothing else to do, it<br/>
isn&#39;t that he even likes what he watches.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And the suggestions of getting out and doing things much more interesting <br/>
than TV are as good with or without genetic predispositions.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And, when I went and read the stuff at<br/>
unschooling.com and forwarded what I found&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Reading more there and posting less here might change your perspective and <br/>
mood.  You really don&#39;t seem happy with this list at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Now, I have a challenge for you:  Show me ONE place where I have insulted<br/>
anyone here.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My reading back through the list won&#39;t add to the body of useful suggestions <br/>
for unschoolers.  Neither will the continuation of this conversation, I&#39;m <br/>
afraid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826433081">Actually, Bridgett, you don&#39;t seem too happy, at all.<br/>
<br/>
It seems you have had some very hard times and that<br/>
perhaps it is not all over with yet. Maybe if you ease<br/>
up a bit things will flow a little more smoothly. <br/>
<br/>
If the TV really bothers you becuaswDS watching it<br/>
more than you like, you can unplug it, donate it to<br/>
charity, find other things you need to afford more....<br/>
<br/>
Have you thought about turning on some music...let him<br/>
choose the music sometimes...MAKE the music...dance. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could as DS to accompany you somewhere in<br/>
such a way that he knows you really would like for him<br/>
to BE with you..around the block, to the grocery<br/>
store, library, zoo, dentist, friend&#39;s house, up a<br/>
tree, on the roof, swimming, camping (most folks don&#39;t<br/>
take TVs there, though some do).  If you are still ill<br/>
a lot, take him with you to the doc or therapy or<br/>
whatever.  Just ease him away WITH you. <br/>
<br/>
What does he like second best to TV? I bet the listers<br/>
here would have some suggestions on how to make  a<br/>
particular interest assessible and attractive. What do<br/>
YOU like? Do it in the same room close to him or the<br/>
TV until he gets curious, let him get involved<br/>
someway, too.<br/>

have to look it up:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know where this conversation started but here&#39;s my trick - I<br/>
reach behind the TV and loosen the co-ax connector just enough to make<br/>
the picture garbage.  I&#39;m the only one who can fix it and that&#39;s my<br/>
solution when my 9yo son gets into TV too much.  I agree that asking them<br/>
to do something is not too much!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then when questioned about the dishonesty of it I said:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It isn&#39;t that they don&#39;t know what I did to the TV .  It is that they<br/>
can&#39;t fix it themselves (at least my youngest can&#39;t).  And I only use it<br/>
as a last resort when the TV starts staying on continuously for days at a<br/>
time.  My son occassionally &#39;forgets&#39; that there is life away from the<br/>
TV.  That&#39;s why I do it and he knows why.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So how exactly is my credibility harmed?  They know what I do and why I<br/>
do it.<br/>

defensiveness and a  unwillingness to look within to see if there may indeed <br/>
be an opportunity to learn something. It seems that when one is constantly <br/>
trying to defend, explain, etc. themselves, there is a big clue. When I get <br/>
into situation myself, I realize it is time to take a step back and figure <br/>
out why &quot;I&quot; am getting so defensive on my own positions, for if in reality if <br/>
I am comfortable with what I am doing, there is no need to defend it. . . it <br/>
simply won&#39;t push my buttons. But if there is something for me to learn, I <br/>
will without a doubt, defend defend defend. The situations and people I <br/>
encounter that give me the most difficulty are there for me to learn <br/>
something, and undoubtedly they will come up over and over until I take the <br/>
time to look at it.  . . <br/>
my opinions offered up for anyone&#39;s consideration who chooses it.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Ezzo? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s much MUCH more out there, but this might should be enough to<br/>
satisfy<br/>
&gt; the curiosity and to avoid further time on this list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;These professionals expressed disagreement with many of the childrearing<br/>
&gt; methods advocated by the Ezzos, and worry about the complete lack of<br/>
credible<br/>
&gt; scientific foundation for the program.<br/>
&gt; Why has BABYWISE raised so many red flags for informed observers? Perhaps<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; most hotly debated aspect of the program has to do with the Ezzos&#39; views<br/>
on<br/>
&gt; routines for young children. BABYWISE admonishes parents to establish a<br/>
&gt; regular schedule for infants immediately after birth; they propose that an<br/>
&gt; unscheduled baby will lead to an undisciplined and difficult child with<br/>
&gt; &quot;metabolic chaos&quot; (a term not found in any medical literature). In the<br/>
&gt; religious version of the manual, the Ezzos strongly suggest that it is<br/>
God&#39;s<br/>
&gt; will that infants eat, sleep, and play on an externally imposed schedule.<br/>
&gt; They write that God is a &quot;God of order.&quot; In fact, the subtitle of their<br/>
&gt; parenting curriculum is &quot;Growing Kids God&#39;s Way.&quot; The book insists that<br/>
&gt; scheduling an infant will actually help his nervous system to &quot;mature&quot;<br/>
more<br/>
&gt; quickly. In BABYWISE, the Ezzos advocate something they refer to as<br/>
&gt; &quot;parent-directed feeding,&quot; in which infants, whether breast- or<br/>
bottle-fed,<br/>
&gt; should be offered nourishment only every three hours or so as timed by the<br/>
&gt; parents. In earlier versions of the manual, parents were urged to wait at<br/>
&gt; least four hours between feedings. After vociferous outcry from the<br/>
medical<br/>
&gt; community, the guidelines were modified. Still, according to BABYWISE,<br/>
&gt; &quot;demand feeding,&quot; the method currently advocated for infants by all major<br/>
&gt; medical organizations, is a faddish and child-centered practice that can<br/>
only<br/>
&gt; lead to unhappy babies and mothers. Both GFI infant-care manuals advise<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; demand-fed infants often grow into children who steal, who will be unable<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; handle real life, and who will &quot;have difficulty with siblings and peers.&quot;<br/>
Dr.<br/>
&gt; Robert Bucknam, the Denver-area pediatrician who co-authored BABYWISE with<br/>
&gt; the Ezzos, describes this alleged phenomenon: &quot;As they get older,&quot; said<br/>
&gt; Bucknam, &quot;every whine is an opportunity to feed. They become more<br/>
demanding.<br/>
&gt; They become brats.&quot; Most child-health experts couldn&#39;t disagree more<br/>
strongly<br/>
&gt; ....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;In an interview with the Bradenton Herald (of Florida), Kearney discussed<br/>
&gt; the experiences she had working with a number of parents who were using<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Ezzo feeding program. In each case, babies were gaining weight slowly and<br/>
&gt; exhibiting signs of depression. Despite Kearney&#39;s professional advice to<br/>
feed<br/>
&gt; the babies more often, these parents refused in accordance with the<br/>
BABYWISE<br/>
&gt; schedule.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2064338605">Ezzo is a self-proclaimed expert on childrearing and one of the more <br/>
fanatical of the 3Rs.  He&#39;s written books about how all children <br/>
should be raised under strickly controlled circumstances from the day <br/>
they are born.  That includes scheduling feedings, scheduling <br/>
sleeping times, even scheduling when to change diapers!  He believes <br/>
that infants should be &quot;trained&quot; to self at scheduled times.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that is bad enough and followers have ended up with malnurioused <br/>
children.  CPS, pediatricians and even the church he belonged to have <br/>
been after him because he isn&#39;t a doctor and has no credentials to be <br/>
spouting off about how to raise babies.<br/>
<br/>
But, what really set me off are his speeches about sparing the rod <br/>
and spoiling the child.  He advocates carrying a &quot;rod&quot; in the baby&#39;s <br/>
diaper bag!  &quot;Discipline must begin in the cradle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Need I say more!  The guy is absolutely disgusting!<br/>
