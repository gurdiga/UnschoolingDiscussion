<div id="ygrps-yiv-12293157">-=-When I wrote my e-mail, I had just read your post and I felt as though I (even though it wasn&#39;t addressed to me, and I am not in a similar situation) had been emotionally bludgeoned. I should have waited to write to you and responded more thoughtfully and made it clear that I was expressing my perceptions, not my judgment. Your e-mail felt very harsh to me, and I simply reacted. It did not appear to me to be part of a discussion; it appeared to me to be a brutal reprimand. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This was addressed to me by e-mail, following a response I let through, but anonymously, in this thread:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/58476">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/58476</a>  (Unschooling from Bed)<br/>

The post which is being described above is here:<br/>

<br/>
I was asking the mom questions in order to get her to think of her situation in another way.  I didn&#39;t call her a name, I didn&#39;t write &quot;LOL&quot; or anything belittling.  Even if I had written the most terrible thing in the world, it wouldn&#39;t be brutal and it wouldn&#39;t be bludgeoning.<br/>
<br/>
IF someone feels bludgeoned by words, I think they&#39;re probably on the edge of feeling terrible anyway, and are looking for something or someone to blame their emotions on.  If something appears to be &quot;brutal&quot; but it was only words (and normal words, too--nothing nasty or hateful), that was in the eye of the beholder.<br/>
<br/>
As for a &quot;reprimand,&quot; it wasn&#39;t a reprimand at all.  A reprimand would have been &quot;don&#39;t write on my list anymore,&quot; or &quot;write differently.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to think about this:  &quot; It did not appear to me to be part of a discussion.&quot;  The person who wrote that had been a member of Always Learning for over two years.  Maybe she wasn&#39;t actually reading the list (that happens), but to accuse me of not being part of the discussion is quite odd.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some thoughts about violence:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/violence">http://sandradodd.com/violence</a><br/>
There are pictures, too, but none are brutal or bludgeoning.  They were done by a nice young man sitting at a table with pencils.  He didn&#39;t stab anyone with a pencil, nor even point a pencil menacingly.  He could have gone from there down to the bowling alley to break some windows, but instead he went to a scanner and sent me the pictures.  It was really very civilized.   <br/>
<br/>
He did that because I asked him to.<br/>
I asked him to because I thought it would help unschooling parents think more clearly about what &quot;violence&quot; is, and is not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213186552">Take time to read the section on Strongbad and write Sandra to tell her<br/>
exactly how you feel! And click on that word &quot;work.&quot;  Please I dare you. ;)<br/>

~Katherine<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: I didn&#39;t respond to the Unschooling from Bed thread. When I first read<br/>
the title of it, I had in mind cosleeping and unschooling for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
What I saw was a mom who might be having trouble she hasn&#39;t even thought<br/>
about yet. I worried that maybe her hormones might not be up to the task of<br/>
another pregnancy and that maybe she hasn&#39;t thought of that or how it could<br/>
color her outlook on her children. Emotions during and after pregnancy can<br/>
do a number on a woman and the people around her. The more pregnancies a<br/>
woman has, the more serious it can be because the older one gets, the less<br/>
ability one has to restore hormones.<br/>
<br/>
Continual cycles of anger can bring on more and more bursts of adrenaline.<br/>
Cortisol is a precursor to other hormones (for men and women). Overusing<br/>
adrenaline without the protective effect of some outlet, such as gently<br/>
moving one&#39;s limbs if one isn&#39;t able to vigorously scrub perfectly clean<br/>
countertops or walk briskly like I do when feeling annoyed, angry or<br/>
frustrated, can lead to adrenal exhaustion. It doesn&#39;t just effect the<br/>
adrenals but just about all the hormones the body produces. The primary<br/>
function of cortisol is to short-circuit the brain&#39;s ability to reason and<br/>
think so that one can focus solely on reacting as quickly as possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1706760132">The same situations can be stressful for some and not frightening or<br/>
frustrating for others. I think that&#39;s worth noting. And the key to seeing<br/>
that a person can change the effect on themselves of future situations they<br/>
might encounter. Mindfulness is very beneficial before situations arrive at<br/>
a stress point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The information on hormones, pregnancy and anger are very interesting to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>me.  Could you recommend any books or resources I might look at?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Tons I could recommend but starting with the very basic:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response</a><br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve picked up a lot of info just reading about things that didn&#39;t<br/>
appear to me under the headings &quot;hormones, pregnancy, anger&quot; etc. Jean<br/>
Auel&#39;s Clan of the Cave Bears, for instance, as well as Richard Adam&#39;s<br/>
Watership Down, mention in passing the effect of stress on reproduction in<br/>
the female, which is to lower or stop fertility or even cause spontaneous<br/>
abortions.<br/>
<br/>
Stress is not always physical. It isn&#39;t always sourced from something<br/>
suddenly appearing. Sometimes it&#39;s things like constant hunger. Hunger<br/>
probably was a frequent occurrence that formed a lot about stress response,<br/>
when you consider that --even not hungry-- people lessen stress with food.<br/>
Food is interesting. It expresses welcome and creates a soothing effect,<br/>
hence the phrase &quot;comfort food.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think a person who might not remember that the effects of stress are<br/>
multiple or may not have thought about stresssss multiplying or being<br/>
transferable or increased by sharing with or passing on to others, that&#39;s a<br/>
person who may be under more profound levels of stress than s/he realizes.<br/>
<br/>
Mindfulness before crunch times helps me immensely. That can be practiced<br/>
along with open curiosity about the world around us, as opposed to deciding<br/>
to close off to new things for fear of thinking about them. I think<br/>
unmindfulness is itself a source of continual stress because it blocks off<br/>
alternatives to stress.<br/>
<br/>
Most of us haven&#39;t encountered the stress of animal attacks. Forethought is<br/>
even beneficial there:<br/>

<br/>
The cumulative effect of mindful practice is to prepare for whatever<br/>
comes... stressful or not. This link to an audio of a talk on mindfulness<br/>
was very illuminating and I recommend it to anyone especially those new to<br/>
unschooling. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rentalk">http://sandradodd.com/rentalk</a><br/>
