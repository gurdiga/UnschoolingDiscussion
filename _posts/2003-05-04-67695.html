<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664951494">So I&#39;m going to unsub soon. Hey, it is only two months away, and we are<br/>
starting to pack, tomorrow we go to the appliance store and figure out those<br/>
needs, we have to sell the house...DEEP BREATH!!!!BUT, I have tons of<br/>
different books and there is no way we can get them to Israel. I won&#39;t be<br/>
able to fit them on the shelves!!!!  Here are some I think some of you may<br/>
be interested in. LMK if you want them (off list) and ask away if you have a<br/>
specific want. I may have your book!!!!<br/>

A Mathematical Mystery Tour: except for the dust jacket this is in great<br/>
shape. $10<br/>
