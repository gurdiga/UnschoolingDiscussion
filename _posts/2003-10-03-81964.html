<div id="ygrps-yiv-2069484902">Earlier today my kids were playing a game that involved two large bowls of water, straws, a syringe, and sick stuffed animals.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494238798">Just had such a moment, my own self. I peeked in on my littlest in <br/>
bed, while I was re-booting the laundry. Mercy. Me. Her bedroom. <br/>
<br/>
First of all, she was snuggled in deep under the covers, with the CD <br/>
player on low, playing Disney tunes. Must have had it on all night. <br/>
She&#39;s sort of curled around it.<br/>
<br/>
The microwave that she and her brother took apart, which she then set <br/>
up in her room as a drum set, is falling over on top of the nest they <br/>
made out of every blanket in the house. There&#39;s the sugar bowl, a tea <br/>
cup, and two water cups, on a makeshift tray, next to the bed. A <br/>
water cup and spoon over by the dresser. Blankets, dress up clothes, <br/>
and real clothes all in a jumble on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
And I said &quot;How cool. She has been having so much fun in here the <br/>
past few days.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
180 degree turnaround, list! And believe me, it is THIS LIST that can <br/>
take the credit. I will probably fish out the dishes from the rest of <br/>
the stuff in there. We got all the dishes done last night and only <br/>
had five water cups! L they&#39;re in Katie&#39;s room, eh? wonder how many <br/>
spoons are in that nest?<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, she can have her room how she wants it. I am not <br/>
going to even suggest she clean it up.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t what anyone wants to read after the fact, but for those who are<br/>
thinking about taking apart a broken microwave or a TV set or computer<br/>
monitor, those all have great big capacitors in them. A capacitor&#39;s purpose<br/>
is to store electricity so even when they&#39;re unplugged they can store a<br/>
potentially lethal charge. One repair site said the capacitor in a TV can<br/>
&quot;retain a dangerous or at least painful charge for days or longer!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922769947">Wow! I&#39;m glad to know about that, but just to put your fears to rest, <br/>
this microwave had been sitting out in my hubby&#39;s shop for at least a <br/>
year. We&#39;re gearing up to move, and the kids glommed onto it and <br/>
dismantled it in the kitchen. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the flux capacitor has ??? JIGAwatts of power? LOL <br/>
<br/>
blessings, heidiC (who always thought a capacitor was some imaginary <br/>
pseudo-mad-scientist word from BAck to the Future)<br/>
