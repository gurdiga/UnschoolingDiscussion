<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214008256">Deb, I forwarded your message to the group.  A Michele from .....   I don&#39;t know, somewhere out of state just rejoined and is missing you.  Said you and Barda gave her the best advice.<br/>
<br/>
Please do pop in next weekend if you get the time.  It&#39;s just not the same without you.  <br/>
<br/>
You take care, girl.<br/>
<br/>
Feel the love,<br/>
Nichole<br/>

  ***When are you coming back?***<br/>
<br/>
  Hey Nichole! How are ya Lovie?<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe sooner than I thought.   The influx of Minnesotan relatives has<br/>
  waned and I have my guest/computer room (that&#39;s code for junk room) back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Dylan and I are on the go all week and only home on weekends, lately.   <br/>
<br/>
  I didn&#39;t make it to see Bob... sorry about the Tee Shirt...     <br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ll try to check in there next weekend and say hi to everyone. <br/>
<br/>
  Deb, waving at you across the continental divide.  <br/>
