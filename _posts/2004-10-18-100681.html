<div id="ygrps-yiv-746115192">My son (11) is trying to making an electronic listening device.  He wants it <br/>
to collect distant sounds in order to amplify them.  The Radio Shack guy said <br/>
to go online and find directions as to what he needs but we have not been <br/>
successful in our searches.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t want a premade kit but wants to make this completely on his own.  <br/>
Any suggestions for websites that we could go to that might point us in the <br/>
right direction?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1732712469">Just as a guess I&#39;d say put into google:<br/>
<br/>
remote amplification parabolic<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
homemade spy equipment<br/>
<br/>
or <br/>
<br/>
echo reflection dish listening device (not all at once)</div>
