There are maybe 2 or 3 of us on this list of 200 that Unschool what does one <br/>

Oh, Laura, I&#39;ve learned that I can make myself crazy, or I can just realize <br/>
that it doesn&#39;t matter what I say. We all know that if that kid pooped and peed <br/>
himself she has MUCH bigger problems in her household than videogames. (I <br/>
suspect she lied about it, which is pretty sick.) <br/>
<br/>
What about, rather than arguing with these people on the list, just post <br/>
awesome sharing about the wonders of unschooling in your own home? Write about the <br/>
cool things your kids do and say, then just gush something like &quot;Oh, I just <br/>
love unschooling!&quot; Gradually, cool people will want to know more because those <br/>
cool things and your own energy will be something they will want for their own <br/>
families. <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, there&#39;s nothing you can do that will get those rigid people out of <br/>
their teeny heads. Focus on the joy, and try to ignore the misery.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708951571">Well said, Kathryn!  AMEN.<br/>
I was just thinking the other day....there are narrow-minded, controlling people of all beliefs and <br/>
professions...is that what is useful to unschooling- pointing that <br/>
out over and over?- or the truely helpful, wise and experienced <br/>
discussions from you all who are doing what we are talking about <br/>
doing???<br/>
