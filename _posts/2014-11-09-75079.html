<div id="ygrps-yiv-958812322">Another mindset that can interfere with deschooling a teen, especially one who is leaving high school with only a year or two to finish, is the idea of College Preparedness. If your son (or you) has the idea that at 18 he &quot;should&quot; be ready to launch into college it can become a barrier to letting go of school-ish thinking. College-immediately-follows-high school is a sacred tenet of The School Narrative. Broken down and looked at critically, all of modern day school (at least in America) builds on itself: elementary school prepares the student for middle school which prepares the student for high school which prepares the student for college which prepares the student for A Career/Success/Happiness (trade schools have long been cut out of The Narrative, and alternate, undefined paths were never part of it).&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The point of deschooling is to help a child (AND the parents) heal a broken relationship to learning. Sandra&#39;s analogy about healing a broken leg by resting rather than walking on it is so powerful when you consider that the effect of school on very many children is a broken experience of (and/or relationship to) learning. The more severe the break, the more time, space, and tender mindful care needed to provide the mending.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I would strongly encourage such parents to encourage any teens who are just starting the process to put thoughts of the future, especially any college or career tracks, on hold indefinitely. Truly take a hiatus from the whole forward tllt of schoolish thinking and immerse oneself in the now. Explore ideas, ponder interests, try lots of possibilities. Don&#39;t get stuck or sidetracked by the arbitrary timetable for Independence and Success that has been fostered and promoted by school think.</div><div><br></div><div>~ Leah Rose</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492650933">Thank you, Sandra! Absolutely helpful to me- my oldest is almost 17, but we started unschooling at nearly 14. Sometimes I have worried (inside) about how long and hard deschooling has been for her, versus the two younger ones. I have always put the worry aside and looked at her, as her interests flouish and her behaviour has mellowed and seemed more like &quot;her&quot;, as she began to resemble the uninjured child we sent to school. To others, though, it looks like lots of drawing, painting, reading, playing guitar, and they look at me with the what about SAT&#39;s look. It can help to read that,yes, it will look like that AND take longer for her, so thanks!</div>

(he was in school for 4 years in all). It has been SO helpful to read and realise that &#39;&#39;some is better than none&#39;&#39;, and that this is normal and to be expected of a child who has&nbsp;been in the &#39;system&#39; longer, &nbsp;but it has been painful in places.....</font></div><div dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div dir="ltr"><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">But.... Really recently he walked down the stairs and said &#39;I get it mum.&#39;&nbsp;</font><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">&#39;What do you get?&#39; I asked.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">I get that it&#39;s ok to listen to myself. I get thats it&#39;s ok to do what I feel I want to do and is right for me, and I get that I am really learning about myself now.</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font><img src="https://a.gfx.ms/Emoji_1F60D.png" alt="Emoji" style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;<img src="https://a.gfx.ms/Emoji_1F60A.png" alt="Emoji" style="font-size:12pt;"></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">He has found it very tricky in places to let go of the &#39;handbook&#39; (a&nbsp;Canadian&nbsp;friend of mine uses this expression and I like it - she says us english have the toughest version of it of all!).</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">Anyway he has fought and defended that &#39;book&#39; with us in places,&nbsp;which&nbsp;is kind of funny really as he is the one who has led the way to this path so&nbsp;determinedly and&nbsp;obstinately&nbsp;even at times.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">But since coming home, and while deschooling, we have had some quite belligerent&nbsp;arguments from him&nbsp;about the need to be &#39;normal&#39; and follow the&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana, sans-serif">crowd. He&nbsp;has wobbled more than I thought he would to be honest...and clung onto the old.</font></div><div><font face="Verdana, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">But I get why, and have done some reading on it (thank&nbsp;you Joyce and Amy among others). My partner and I try to stay calm in these moments and just answer him from an unschooling perspective - but as his loving parents though - not detached and schooly! I hope!&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">And my partner is good at&nbsp;using&nbsp;humour and lightening it all up for him. But it has been fraught and&nbsp;challenging&nbsp;in places,&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana, sans-serif">especially</font><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">&nbsp;his frustrations, and upsetting for us all at times.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="3"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana, sans-serif" size="3">We felt a bit&nbsp;tethered still in places, as if he were still holding onto the rope - scared to let go of it fully.</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">Some of this unschooling life he has slipped into like a glove, like the good fit unschooling is for him, and that we hoped it would be, and knew instinctually (when I finally listened to those instincts...).</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">The playing! Oh the playing - this boy was born to play and has always been so inventive and&nbsp;imaginative and such fun with it! and he grasped the freedom to explore to the far corners all of what he loves with both hands and ran with it.</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">Feeling and being safe and comfortable, being able to run and jump outside whenever he wants too - even in the dark and rain! Taking baths after lunch and&nbsp;watching&nbsp;films in the wee small hours, so much of it he has embraced&nbsp;beautifully and&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana, sans-serif">joyfully.</font></div><div><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">But....he/it... is still his own worse enemy in places, he couldn&#39;t quite shake the &#39;hand book&#39; jacket off. He found it painful, I found it painful.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">I have been&nbsp;recorded by Amy Childs&nbsp;actually&nbsp;talking about&nbsp;the regret, but I found it too upsetting, and&nbsp;exposing? I think? to recount and hear, and also&nbsp;couldn&#39;t quite put my finger on some it because I got so emotional when talking!&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">My deep feeling son picked up on it too, and as I felt it all over&nbsp;again and got a bit stuck in&nbsp;negativity again for a while, so he picked up on my feelings without knowing why, and&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn&#39;t good for me or him - we were not ready yet. Maybe it was&nbsp;this&nbsp;change&nbsp;that I/we needed to happen first....</font></div><div><span style="font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;">It is on hold for now or maybe never, and as she said with&nbsp;each&nbsp;day, month, year it will change for the better even more, and will always be&nbsp;relevant and maybe&nbsp;be even better and more helpful later on.</span></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">He found our new generosity from unschooling one of the&nbsp;hardest&nbsp;to handle (and the letting go of the clock, and limiting, and being able to choose wether to attend/do things or not, and the punishing and controlling sometimes too...).</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">Tough for me as my childhood was very limited and controlled and dominated over with fear, and full of &#39;We&nbsp;can&#39;t&nbsp;afford it&#39; and &quot;I don&#39;t want&nbsp;spoilt kids&#39;...) and I was doing just that for a good few years there...So I have loved the freedom of letting that go, found it so liberating and healing, and enjoy the joy from them when I bring&nbsp;things home or find things&nbsp;they love and get them for them - I love to see&nbsp;their&nbsp;faces&nbsp;light up and the big hugs I get, and the I love you&#39;s and &#39;best day ever&#39; exclamations!&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">But very&nbsp;momentously&nbsp;he also said.... &quot;I get that I am not spoilt if I get bought gifts from you, or get things I want and need if I ask for them. Im not&nbsp;spoilt&nbsp;because I have you and your time and love whenever I need it every day, so the gifts and stuff are an&nbsp;extension&nbsp;of that love not a replacement for it and your time!&nbsp;</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">He said he understand the paucity thing too - and has a&nbsp;friend who has kind of&nbsp;ruined their friendship lately through&nbsp;jealousy of my&nbsp;sons&nbsp;allowances (gaming mainly - the unlimited time and the games he is allowed to play) which is sad for them both, but it has&nbsp;really shown my son what&nbsp;limiting and controlling can do....and also he is horrified that his friend is 13 and still gets a five minute warning for bedtime from a parent while they are playing&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana, sans-serif">online and in full ear shot of my son...Ouch!</font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000"><br></font></div><div><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000">I&nbsp;seriously&nbsp;never&nbsp;thought I would hear him speak&nbsp;this way or hear him say &#39;I get it&#39; &nbsp;I just hung on to words of&nbsp;experience like these of Sandras&nbsp;</font><font face="Verdana,sans-serif" color="#000000" style="font-size:12pt;">&nbsp;&gt;&gt;&gt;</font><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13.333333015441895px;">STILL! &nbsp;Some is better than none.&lt;&lt;&lt; </span><font size="4"><font face="Georgia">&nbsp;</font></font></div><div><font size="4"><font face="Georgia">And Amy who said &#39;&#39;yes but&nbsp;</font></font><font face="Georgia" size="4">imagine how much worse if he was still in school and being parented by the hand book....&#39;&#39;&nbsp;And Joyce and Pams helpful&nbsp;words on this area.</font></div><div><font size="4"><font face="Georgia"><br></font></font></div><div><font size="4"><font face="Georgia">I wanted to write about it almost&nbsp;immediately but I&nbsp;thought I&nbsp;would leave it a while and see&nbsp;where he is&nbsp;with it, and I can&nbsp;report that he is still on this new path of thinking and having&nbsp;realisations a new almost daily now. He points things out that he has seen and heard and&nbsp;understood from an unschooling Vs mainstream perceptive, most of it he finds quite upsetting and gets very fired up&nbsp;about!

After all nature has had several million years to perfect it ;-)-=-</span><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">Joyce wrote that elsewhere; I brought it here. :-)</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">-=-</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">At that rate he’d be almost 18 by the time he had school well out of his system.</span><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">&nbsp;-=-</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">He will never have school well out of his system, because he went for at least ten years. &nbsp;He might have gone for 11, or he might have had pre-school or daycare.</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">School will never leave him. &nbsp;No matter what we do or say, the potential for the benefits of unschooling goes down the longer the child is in school. &nbsp;Some of the ids we’re writing about were never in school at all. &nbsp;Some of the benefits we write about are (sadly but inevitably) only going to be fully present in those who were unschooled from the beginning.</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">STILL! &nbsp;Some is better than none.</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">But if you goal is that he will be completely deschooled, it will be yet another failure.</span></div></div><br>
