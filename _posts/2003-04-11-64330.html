<div id="ygrps-yiv-1025905644">Please hold off a while on this kind of stuff about spanking:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I don&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
think you hate your children. I think you just don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s a<br/>
<br/>
shame. I&#39;m starting to think now that you don&#39;t want to understand. That&#39;s a<br/>
<br/>
shame too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why I&#39;m asking this.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay if someone&#39;s spanking who is on the way to changing various aspects <br/>
of parenting.  Many of already believe it&#39;s hard to maintain a little island <br/>
of control once the controlling starts to relax and the trust and respect <br/>
come streaming in.<br/>
<br/>
And if one family is spanking, it doesn&#39;t matter to me because for one thing, <br/>
I know millions of families are.   And for a more important thing, every <br/>
single time this discussion comes around, another family stops spanking.  It <br/>
isn&#39;t always the family engaged in the debate.  Sometimes it&#39;s just a lurking <br/>
reader, or something is written which a non-spanking lurker prints out and <br/>
passes to a sister or neighbor or friend.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to beat up a spanker to show that hitting is bad.<br/>
That&#39;s back to the original dilemma.<br/>
