<div id="ygrps-yiv-76589676">Mine are The Unschooling Handbook by Mary Griffith and Homeschooling:A <br/>
Patchwork Of Days by Nancy Lande.  Both of these get passed around alot, <br/>
the unschooling book serving as a &#39;yes you can&#39; primer and the patchwork <br/>
one as &#39;others do it and here&#39;s how&#39;.  Both have helped me with idea&#39;s, <br/>
plans, etc.  My dh was the same way yours is now.  He&#39;ll come around.  What <br/>
I told mine when worries came up was bookmarked pages that addressed the <br/>
concerns so you can say &#39;I&#39;ve got the info right here on____&quot;.  Makes it a <br/>
whole lot easier.<br/>

John Holt&#39;s writing is as sharp and as relevant as ever. I still pull <br/>
his books off the shelf when I want to be truly inspired by clear <br/>
insights and honest appraisals. Even after all the years, and all the <br/>
other homeschooling books written in the interim, I think &quot;Teach Your <br/>
Own&quot; is still an excellent book for anyone wondering about the hows <br/>
and whys of homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477026985">I know I&#39;m not Helen, but I read Teach Your Own just this year and found it extremely inspiring, encouraging and enlightening. Yes some of the references are dated, but the majority of information contained in it would be pertinent in any generation. We as parents will usually seek the best for our children and that is what John Holt was striving for. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241999722">Dumbing us Down by Gatto is an excellent book to help make the break!  I<br/>
read everything I could get my hands on by Holt, and I read the most<br/>
interesting passages aloud to whomever was in ear shot.  Also, maybe you<br/>
could get some back issues of Growing Without Schooling (maybe try<br/>
ebay).<br/>
