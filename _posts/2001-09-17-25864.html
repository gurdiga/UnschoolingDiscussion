<div id="ygrps-yiv-915670693">Hi,<br/>
Sorry, not trying to bombard you with the bible, I was taught this, and I<br/>
wondered if anyone else was. I am not trying to push religion, but I think<br/>
it could be a possible history.<br/>
 In the bible story where Rebecca and Jacob tricked their father, so that<br/>
Esau would not get his birthright inheritance is where the holy was started,<br/>
and it has never ceased. Jacob had to leave work in fields for 14 years, and<br/>
Esau wanted to kill him.  Esau could be the disgruntled Christian. Whether<br/>
the story is historically accurate-the point of this story for me is<br/>
forgiveness, and keeping peace in the family.<br/>
