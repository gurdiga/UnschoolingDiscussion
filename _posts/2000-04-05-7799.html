<div><font color="#000080" size="2">I had read on this list (I believe) not long ago 
that the desire that children have to learn to read is often tied to the age at 
which they begin to lose their baby teeth. Evidently there is some significance 
in the emotional/developmental stages that correspond to each 
other.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">Last Sunday night, my 6yo son said (those 
beloved words) &quot;I want to learn to read.&quot;&nbsp; He then proceeded to start 
working on the letters and sounds on a chart my 10yo daughter had made for him 
some months ago.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">The following morning, my son woke up, and 
announced &quot;I have a loose tooth.&quot;&nbsp; I thought he was joking at first, a 
belated April Fool&#39;s Day joke - but no, he had a loose tooth!&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">I believed you all that the timing would 
coincide, but within hours of each other?!!!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">Anyway, on another of my lists, someone asked 
what they should answer to their children when they say &quot;I&#39;m bored!&quot;&nbsp; I 
posted this list, which is on my daughter&#39;s wall, and to which I send her if she 
dares utter those words.... if any of you would like this in the Microsoft Word 
document version, email me at <a rel="nofollow"

you!</font></div>
