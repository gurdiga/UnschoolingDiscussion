<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680636361">My son is studying Chinese and he is frequently lectured about how he cannot<br/>
miss class -- ever (this is in response to our taking him to visit his<br/>
grandmother in Albuquerque), if he expects to &quot;be a good Chinese student.&quot;<br/>
My daughter used to be in the same class, but she got sick of the way she<br/>
was being treated and she knew it was her choice to attend or not. The<br/>
teacher kept on telling me about how I needed to get her a tutor because she<br/>
wasn&#39;t picking things up as quickly as she should. That was not my take on<br/>
how she was doing, although I knew she was not responding well to aspects of<br/>
the class that had nothing to do with learning the language (I&#39;ve sat in on<br/>
the class). But when I told the teacher that my daughter wouldn&#39;t be going<br/>
to class anymore, the teacher told me, &quot;Oh, she was doing so well!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I talked to a friend who is native-born Chinese about my daughter&#39;s<br/>
experience, and she said it was familiar to her from her experiences in<br/>
Chinese schools. She said: Chinese teachers like children and want them to<br/>
do well, so they are genuinely sad when a student does not continue in a<br/>
class. Chinese teachers will say a child &quot;isn&#39;t doing well&quot; when they are<br/>
not happy with something else about the child. Chinese teachers expect the<br/>
children and the parents to make all the effort, to adapt to the teacher and<br/>
the system. <br/>
<br/>
The Chinese class is very regimented: The children sit in order according to<br/>
their birthdays and there are many lectures about how a good Chinese student<br/>
acts. They do processions like my husband did in Catholic grade school in<br/>
the 1950s and early 1960s. We&#39;ve had some interesting values-based<br/>
discussions about it in our family. I&#39;ve asked my son if Chinese class is<br/>
something he wants to do (it frankly is sort of a pain to get him to the<br/>
class because of the time and location of it), and he&#39;s adamant that he<br/>
wants to continue. My daughter is still interested in learning Chinese, but<br/>
she&#39;s choosing to watch DVDs in the language.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m writing because I suspect that schools *in China* would be a<br/>
huge shock for U.S.-born people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2089585293">You can get a DVD of El Cid in Chinese with subtitles (turn the subtitles  to <br/>
Chinese with the language track to Chinese or English).  They only cost  <br/>
about $6 plus shipping, and I got a BUNCH of great Hong Kong stamps on the  <br/>
package.  For some reason it&#39;s not available yet straight out in  English.  <br/>
 <br/>
There are probably other movies in that situation too, not to mention  movies <br/>
originally in Chinese. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
El Cid&#39;s my favorite movie of all time, so that&#39;s why I have that  one.<br/>

Here are lots of great Chinese products for kids, including some fun videos (like Sagwa). <br/>

<br/>
One of my h/s friends visited China with her family last year. They were all<br/>
astonished to find that there are almost no playgrounds with kid&#39;s equipment<br/>
either in schools or just around for the public. The few urban playgrounds<br/>
that exist apparently are part of some kind of special program instigated by<br/>
some Americans.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-771777308">While I&#39;m certain there are many differences in the<br/>
systems, we were in Japan several years ago to visit<br/>
our close friend.  He is a teacher in elementary/jr.<br/>
high level schools in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
We were amazed at how the schools operate there.  The<br/>
students have three uniforms - a lighter-weight<br/>
uniform and a heavy-weight uniform and a &#39;gym<br/>
clothes&#39;-type uniform.  They change them throughout<br/>
the day.<br/>
<br/>
The classrooms in this particular town (and Dan told<br/>
us it is the norm) do not have heat or A/C.  There are<br/>
no janitors.  The kids are responsible for cleaning<br/>
the school every day.  Lunch begins with a ceremony<br/>
that I didn&#39;t ever comprehend fully but involves two<br/>
students at the front of the room with signs on long<br/>
poles (so everyone can see) that look like a countdown<br/>
from 10 to 1 before anyone can eat.<br/>
<br/>
The teachers are rather physical with the students,<br/>
poking them or thumping their heads, etc.  The<br/>
students have their school day followed by clubs of<br/>
various kinds.  Many of them are gone from 6AM to 6PM<br/>
every day, including Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
It is a very different experience from any I have had<br/>
or seen here in the US.  On the one hand, I could see<br/>
how their system brought the children into the active<br/>
care of the school.  On the other hand,... well there<br/>
is a LOT of on the other hand!<br/>
