&gt;Nicky is yelling that he wants to read something else, I take him by the <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We send Brian to the &quot;fuss room&quot; if he gets intrusive with it, and it&#39;s up to <br/>
him to rejoin us when he&#39;s done (usually within about 15 seconds). When I <br/>
tell him &quot;fuss room!&quot; and he decides to quit fussing instead, that&#39;s find, <br/>
but if dh does it, he wants him to go there, even if he was willing to stay <br/>
with us and be pleasant. Then Brian usually stays longer and fusses more and <br/>
more loudly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1503134559">Hi, I&#39;m new to this list. I don&#39;t have any kids of my<br/>
own, but I have been a nanny to many many kids over<br/>
the past 8 years and when I do have my own kids (soon,<br/>
I hope!) I definitely plan to unschool them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I know this sounds strange, but when my 3yo objects<br/>
&gt; to something, what often <br/>
&gt; works is to sympathize (&quot;I know it&#39;s really rotten<br/>
&gt; that we have to leave <br/>
&gt; now, I wish we could stay...&quot; &quot;I would love to get<br/>
&gt; some French fries! I wish <br/>
&gt; I had some now&gt; <br/>
<br/>
&gt; I actually urge <br/>
&gt; him, very sincerely, to scream and howl as loudly as<br/>
&gt; he can. (Louder! <br/>
&gt; Louder!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I do the same thing with sympathizing. I also<br/>
sometimes add in, &quot;I must be the worst nanny in the<br/>
world, I&#39;m so mean!&quot; for good measure and it usually<br/>
provokes a smile. I&#39;ve never had any of the kids agree<br/>
with me, and sometimes they even have defended me -<br/>
&quot;No you&#39;re not, you let us ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I also tell the kids, &quot;You are welcome to scream and<br/>
cry and make a fuss about this. You may be as upset as<br/>
you like, in your room (or outside). Because I&#39;m doing<br/>
[whatever I&#39;m doing] here in the [whatever room I&#39;m<br/>
in], I can&#39;t listen to you cry right now.&quot; I think<br/>
this acknowledges that the kid is upset, and that he<br/>
has a right to express that upset-ness, but that it&#39;s<br/>
not going to control my world. I usually have success<br/>
with this.<br/>

&lt;&lt; When he objects to something in a very loud and whiny way, I &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We use the technique of saying to Zak &quot;that&#39;s whiny voice... that hurts my <br/>
ears&quot; and then we give him an example of a regular voice... It usually takes <br/>
about 5 mins to get a sentence out of him between the whining and the regular <br/>
voice, but he does end up doing it, otherwise we don&#39;t respond.  <br/>
<br/>
The other thing we do is that Zak likes to shout lots of requests from his <br/>
bedroom and we&#39;ve told him that if he wants help or to talk to us he has to <br/>
come into the kitchen/lounge/office whereever we are and talk to us in front <br/>
of us... We ignore him until he does this.  At first it took over an hour, <br/>
but now it&#39;s only about 5 mins before he realizes that someone is not coming <br/>
to fix whatever the problem is and that he has to come and ask us in a <br/>
regular voice.  This is all so much more exhausting than it was working in an <br/>
office somewhere and having my boss tell me what a wonderful job I&#39;m doing <br/>

hmmm Tracy.. I feel an uncomfortable feeling coming on at the thought of <br/>
letting him fall face down into the water... No he hasn&#39;t fallen down because <br/>
I&#39;m always there to catch him and I figure that because he&#39;s 9 months old he <br/>
(a) ought not to be standing in the bath as that&#39;s a safety issue and (b) I <br/>
think I&#39;m more concerned about him drowning in 5 inches of water... I&#39;ll have <br/>
to give this some thought because in some ways it&#39;s a freedom issue and I&#39;m <br/>
not sure at 9 months he&#39;s ready for that freedom, nor will he remember the <br/>
consequences of his choices.... But I&#39;ll give it some thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-68893487">well it was just a thought.  I&#39;ve been reading Deb Jackson&#39;s Three <br/>
in a Bed, which borrows a certain amount from (while adding <br/>
clarity and balance to) Jean Liedloff&#39;s Continuum Concept.  <br/>
Jackson describes it as &#39;minimalist mothering,&#39; doing nothing for <br/>
the child that he can do for himself.  No doubt I&#39;ll be coming over <br/>
all Yequana for a while &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I doubt he&#39;d fall face first, more likely on his no doubt well- <br/>
rounded bottom and then perhaps slide back onto his head.  The <br/>
thing is, at that age, mine were in the bath with me, not me waiting <br/>
by the side, so perhaps it&#39;s different...<br/>
