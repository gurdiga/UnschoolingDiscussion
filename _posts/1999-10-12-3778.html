Google Search: visual-spatial learners&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I am and have a visual-spatial learner. I have had trouble finding any <br/>
information on this type of learner. Today I hit he jackpot and thought I <br/>
would pass it on. From reading some of the posts it sounds as though there <br/>
may be a couple of these learners out there. (thinks in pictures,<br/>
artistic,etc.) Well I hope someone can find some interest.<br/>

should forward it or not. There are several books on this subject also.  <br/>
&quot;Right Brained Kids in a Left Brained World&quot; and &quot;Unicorns are Real&quot; are two <br/>
that come to mind. Sorry can&#39;t recall authors off the top of my head. You may <br/>
try Borders or Amazon web sites.<br/>

&gt;  &quot;Right Brained Kids in a Left Brained World&quot; and &quot;Unicorns are Real&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read the Right Brained Kids in a Left Brained World which was <br/>
recommended to me by a friend.  I read this before the meeting with the <br/>
school psychologist and another round of meetings last school year.  So I <br/>
knew what they were talking about and even told them a few of the techinques <br/>
I&#39;d learned.  The school psychologist kept looking at me over his glasses <br/>
without saying anything.  I go the feeling from the principal too that they <br/>
were not too happy I educated myself about his learning style.  Now of course <br/>
Everett is at home with me so I reread the book.  I just lent it to a sister <br/>
in law.  Another intersting thing is this book talks about kids with ADD.  He <br/>
says many are diagnosed with ADD when actually they just have this learning <br/>
style.  The whole book title is &quot;Right Brained Children in a Left Brained <br/>
World: Unlocking the Potential of your ADD Child.&quot;  The school psychologist <br/>
had told me personally on the playground that Everett had ADD.  The teacher <br/>
said no way (she was a blessing for Everett).  Then I read that book and was <br/>
all geared up for the meeting and the psych guy never mentioned it there at <br/>
all.  <br/>
  Thanks for the suggestion of Unicorns Are Real.  I&#39;ve never seen that title <br/>
before so plan to get it now.  I&#39;m a reader-aholic.  I don&#39;t necessarily take <br/>
all the advice, I take a little and leave a little.  But if I&#39;m without a <br/>
book I feel lost.  lol<br/>
  Thanks again.<br/>
