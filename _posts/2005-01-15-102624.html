<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382584112">Robyn - thank you for your thoughtful post/reply.  I see many similarities <br/>
in your Jayn and my son Logan (who just turned 6).  He, too, will exhibit <br/>
avoidance/denial behavior when something happens. Typically, when I try to <br/>
discuss an appropriate behavior he will close his eyes and tell me he is <br/>
sleeping.  He does not hit other children, only me and his father. And he <br/>
can turn his anger on and off so fast it amazes me. He could be lashing out <br/>
at me - growling, punching - and then the next second turn to his baby <br/>
sister and smile and kiss her. So I see that his behavior is a ploy for <br/>
attention. He was the center of attention for nearly 6 years before his <br/>
sister came along, so that has a lot to do with it, although he had been <br/>
hitting us even before she was born. I see clearly that when he is bored or <br/>
frustrated that we can&#39;t give him complete attention, the yelling and <br/>
hitting begins. But nothing we do seems to curb this behavior. I&#39;ve tried <br/>
&quot;holding&quot; - he will have none of that, practically wrestles me to get away <br/>
and he is quite strong. I&#39;ve tried &quot;punishment&quot; in the sense of putting him <br/>
in his room and holding the door closed (we have no locks and he will not <br/>
simply stay in if I tell him to) - this just adds fuel to the fire and he <br/>
ends up screaming and throwing things. I&#39;ve tried punishment in the sense <br/>
of taking things away (no treats for two days, Gameboy taken away, etc.) <br/>
and this does not seem to affect him. He&#39;ll tell me (smugly) &quot;I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to play Gameboy today anyway.&quot;  I am at a loss for how to stop the hitting, <br/>
and I feel I don&#39;t have any way of preventing it - there WILL BE times when <br/>
he is bored and I can&#39;t entertain him. So I am trying now to simply ignore <br/>
it and just tell him &quot;You can not hit&quot; and moving away from him. Yes, he <br/>
will follow me, but if it&#39;s my attention he&#39;s after, hopefully he will see <br/>
that hitting is not the way to get it. I suppose it will just take time, <br/>
like anything else!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;<br/>

time can you say &quot;I don&#39;t want to talk about it now. Can we wait <br/>
until later?&quot; Then, of course, I need to respect his request. I also <br/>
took it as a sign that talking about what he&#39;d done when he was <br/>
really upset was NOT working. Waiting even one minute makes it a lot <br/>
easier for him to hear what I have to say.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that there are times when, in the moment, you can&#39;t prevent <br/>
it, but I absolutely believe there are things you can do to minimize <br/>
it happening. You can&#39;t change him directly, but your reaction makes <br/>
a huge difference. Find calm things to say to acknowledge that he <br/>
wants attention and ask him to say it in a different way. Here that <br/>
sometimes goes like this: &quot;Gentle words, gentle touch. Looks like you <br/>
want to play with me. I&#39;m in the middle of changing Caroline&#39;s <br/>
diaper, so I can&#39;t pick up the engine. Can I make him talk while you <br/>
move him for me?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Adding my negative emotions to the situation just makes it much <br/>
worse, I&#39;ve found with ds. He recently started walking up to 2 y o dd <br/>
and hitting her for no apparent reason. I could not stay calm about <br/>
it and it kept getting worse. I finally started reacting calmly--but <br/>
still reacting, don&#39;t get me wrong--this week and there was a big <br/>
change pretty quickly. (I also looked for an underlying reason--was <br/>
he feeling like he has less power because she&#39;s now 2 and has <br/>
something to say on most every subject?) It&#39;s really hard to stay <br/>
calm or appear to stay calm without feeling like you&#39;re &quot;doing <br/>
nothing&quot; but it just works better!<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;gentle words, gentle touch&quot; phrase came from the author of this <br/>
site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.empathic-discipline.com">http://www.empathic-discipline.com</a> She&#39;s got lots of good <br/>
advice on reacting to kids without punishing. There&#39;s also a Yahoo <br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>
It might not be the best plan, but a couple of times I did something like  <br/>
this:<br/>
 <br/>
I would use the kid-behavior to them at a moment when they really wanted my  <br/>
attention.  I didn&#39;t have that exact example above, but a few things, like  <br/>
total subject changing, or dirty looks or whining.<br/>
 <br/>
But to do it with the thing above, I would pick some non-crucial time or  <br/>
moment and when he started to tell me something I would cover my ears and yell  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not listening&quot; and turn away and maybe really lay it on.  When it  <br/>
happened with my kids I did it just long enough for them to think &quot;WHAT!?&quot; and  then <br/>
figure it out, and then start to get frustrated.  About five seconds,  <br/>
probably.  And then if they protested, I&#39;d say &quot;I thought you thought that  was an <br/>
okay way to communicate&quot; or something like that.  Or &quot;I thought you  liked <br/>
whining.&quot;  And they&#39;d say something and I&#39;d say something real and  immediate, like <br/>
(them) &quot;Well I don&#39;t,&quot; and (me) then maybe you should do it  to other people <br/>
because they don&#39;t like it either.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
So it was a little role-playing moment removed from the time when they were  <br/>
actually in the throes of their own irritating behavior.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s not the best thing I ever did with kids, but it&#39;s not the worst,  <br/>
either, and sometimes a couple of seconds of shock that they can think about in  <br/>
their own way later can be useful.<br/>
 <br/>
That is IF the kid has some interpersonal or intrapersonal skills.  I  think <br/>
a child with Asperger&#39;s or other shut-down in the social skills area might  <br/>
not benefit from it, if they can&#39;t transfer what they&#39;ve felt to what others  <br/>
might be feeling, or if that behavior wouldn&#39;t surprise them or hurt their  <br/>
feelings any at all.  Then I have no ideas but to just give it time.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Breathe&quot; was the thing said most here, and the kids will say it to me,  too, <br/>
if I&#39;m  hurt or getting seriously flustered and feeling like I have NO  time <br/>
and things are spinning out of control.  &quot;Breathe.&quot;  And it goes  with eye <br/>
contact and a deep breath to model and share.  That calms down the  person who&#39;s <br/>
trying to do the calming, too.<br/>

the time.  I&#39;ve had sixth graders who were totally overwhelmed and upset <br/>
and about to become violent in my classroom and if I can just get them <br/>
to breathe... I&#39;ve used it on the soccer field to calm down a player who <br/>
is injured, at home to calm a frustrated or angry child, and with myself.<br/>
<br/>
Janene is my hitter, and I typically try to name her feeling, and then I <br/>
tell her that I&#39;m not to be hit.  I&#39;ve left the room, but usually I just <br/>
hold her.  You can&#39;t hit if you are being held.  Not theraputic holding <br/>
but just cuddling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283553315"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;  I would tell him too, truthfully, that there are people in jail and prison<br/>
&gt; &gt;for just hitting another person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;d like to put out a caution on this one.  I tried this with both <br/>
my kids.  With one it didn&#39;t seem to make an impact either way.  The other <br/>
one it terrified.  I&#39;m sure I didn&#39;t say it in the best way possible or at <br/>
the best time, but I really think it scared him in a bad way.  He felt that <br/>
he had little or no control over the hitting and telling him about jail <br/>
must have seemed like a prediction of something he couldn&#39;t avoid.  I <br/>
should ask him now at age ten what he remembers about that from a few years <br/>
back.  Even bringing that up at a calm time was too much for him.  He <br/>
immediately felt ashamed and scared.  In retrospect, I think we would have <br/>
been better off if I&#39;d said something to the effect that we as his parents <br/>
need to help him get that under control so that he can control himself as <br/>
he gets older because our laws don&#39;t let adults do that.<br/>
