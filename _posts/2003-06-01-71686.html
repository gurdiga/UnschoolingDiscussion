I always liked the way he talked about her. Just bring up her name and he<br/>
goes on about what a great wife and mother she is. How he trusts her totally<br/>
with the children and how wonderful she is in her mothering. I love when<br/>
guys publicly do that with their wives. I should also say that I also like<br/>
when women talk about their husbands like that too. Way too much spouse<br/>
bashing going on these days.<br/>
