<div id="ygrps-yiv-696924417">Hi, I had a sudden discovery last night that my child thinks differently than <br/>
I do (duh) and I&#39;d like some help in understanding her.<br/>
<br/>
I had a pile of puzzles on the floor and I was trying to put one together.  <br/>
It took me a little while to figure out which pieces went with the picture I <br/>
wanted and how to orient them.  I ended up looking at the puzzle box to <br/>
figure it out.  My 6-yo daughter came over to see what I was doing and just <br/>
plucked out the pieces and put it together in maybe 5 seconds.  My 8-yo <br/>
daughter came over and, like me, took awhile and had to look at the puzzle <br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
The 6-yo (almost 7) doesn&#39;t want anything to do with reading, games (she <br/>
hates the competition/winning aspect), or being judged or evaluated in any <br/>
way.  She&#39;s very short-tempered, high strung, and uncooperative.  Teachers in <br/>
classes she&#39;s taken have told me that she gets her feelings hurt a lot and <br/>
will storm off if she &quot;messes up&quot; in some way.  She&#39;s very curious, has lots <br/>
of interests, very verbal, and can articulate very clearly her emotions.  <br/>
BTW, she&#39;s left-handed ( I remember some discussion of how this affects <br/>
learning.)<br/>
<br/>
Does this sound like any children you know?  Is there some way to understand <br/>
her better?  How can I help her to explore her gifts better?  I feel like I <br/>
just don&#39;t get her or how she learns.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for a few years now, and I purposely try not to put on <br/>
any pressure to be perfect or to not make mistakes.  We mainly read together <br/>
and do interesting things/go to interesting places as a family.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insights, Kacy<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like she&#39;s a big-picture thinker. She can evision the end result in <br/>
her head and doesn&#39;t always need all the steps to get there. That&#39;s very <br/>
cool. My husband thinks like that too. He&#39;s a programmer and just &quot;knows&quot; <br/>
where the bugs are when someone is talking design with him. Trouble is, he <br/>
sometimes has a hard time explaining to the others just how he knows without <br/>
a lot of testing. He says he just sees the program run through to its end in <br/>
his head and can visualize where the problems are.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a good thing. :o) Luckily she&#39;s home and doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
evaluated on a regular basis. As far as the reading goes, six (even almost <br/>
7) is still young. I would let her take her time and come to reading at her <br/>
own pace. You, of course, can stil surround her with all the joyous <br/>
excitement that the printed word can bring. This means lots of access to <br/>
books, magazines, lists, notes, posters, cards, crafts, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She&#39;s very short-tempered, high strung, and uncooperative.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow! You could be describing my daughter, Casey. Except I would use the <br/>
terms intense, focused, and independent. :o) After all, if you&#39;re always <br/>
thinking, and have great ideas of your own, it&#39;s got to be awfully hard to <br/>
just do it someone else&#39;s way and at their tedious pace. And when they won&#39;t <br/>
listen just cause you&#39;re *only* six, how frustrating!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Aahhh.....another perfectionist. :o) I know it well and lived it a bit, <br/>
although not as intensely as Casey. I think it&#39;s hard to have a perfect, <br/>
fabulous, grown-up vision in your head and then only 6 year old hands to <br/>
complete it. It&#39;s frustrating. Lots of love and patience have helped Casey <br/>
to mature with this particular trait.<br/>

&gt;&gt;very clearly her emotions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great! Keep her talking and keep her mind busy! Casey thrives with lots of <br/>
different projects to work on. She NEEDS to have have her mind fed at all <br/>
times. It&#39;s exhausting, but so worth it and so necessary.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend reading the book Raising Your Spirited Child by Mary <br/>
Sheedy Kurcinka. It was a life altering book for me in understanding my <br/>
fabulous, intense girl.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;&gt;on any pressure to be perfect or to not make mistakes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure she&#39;s still putting pressure on herself. It may be in her nature, <br/>
like it is with Casey. I like to let Casey see me making mistakes. I talk <br/>
through them, even show my frustration with myself. I try to model coping <br/>
techniques for her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;We mainly read together and do interesting things/go to interesting places <br/>
&gt;&gt;as a family.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds great. Casey also likes LOTS of crafts and writing and drawing. She <br/>
likes to create. Maybe your daughter might need a similar outlet. An outlet <br/>
for Casey&#39;s seemingly limitless physical energy has also been invaluable. <br/>
For Casey it&#39;s been gymnastics and swimming, but a trip to the park also <br/>
improves her mood when she&#39;s frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Thanks for any insights, Kacy&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, you&#39;re a Casey/Kacy too! :o)<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
