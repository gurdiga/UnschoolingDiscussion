Majordomo.  If I did it, what did I do?  Also, thanks so much for the <br/>

about &quot;school.&quot; It will be hard for me for awhile to get <br/>

Fall and be a chicken!! Cluck, cluck . . .What would you do? Are any <br/>

I&#39;d pull her now and say you&#39;re going to go it on your own, if it were me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420337886">Hi, Sara --<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m in California, in the Northern Bay Area.<br/>
<br/>
All the people I know of that waited to take their kids out said that<br/>
they wished they had taken their kids out sooner.  I guess withdrawing<br/>
from an independent study program is not exactly the same. (You kid<br/>
isn&#39;t actually &quot;serving time&quot; in a classroom.)<br/>
<br/>
Is the school system imposing on your life and limiting your freedom in<br/>
pleasure and learning?  Are you getting anything from them that you<br/>
really need? <br/>
<br/>
Somewhere pretty prominently on the HSC website (www.hsc.org) there&#39;s<br/>
information about their booklet about homeschooling in California.  It&#39;s<br/>
free and you can get a hard copy in the mail or read it online.  It&#39;s<br/>
called From Chaos to Confidence.  (Great name!)  It has a thorough<br/>
section about legal issues in Calif.  Once you read it you will feel<br/>
much more confident.  <br/>
<br/>
**It will be hard for me for awhile to get <br/>
unconditioned to the pressure to LEARN, after what is going on with <br/>
our charter and the demands from our &quot;Educational Specialist&quot; (our <br/>
credentialed &quot;teacher&quot;)  Afterall, I have always thought that we are <br/>
in a learning mode everyday, every hour even if we are not &quot;doing&quot; <br/>
something our charter school thinks we should be doing to satisfy <br/>
someone else.**<br/>
<br/>
Right.  You&#39;ve got the key insight here.  You know that learning can<br/>
take any shape or form (or be amorphous).  Educators who are checking up<br/>
on you will be biased towards knowledge that is quantifiable and &quot;flat&quot;,<br/>
that is that fits on a nice, fileable piece of paper.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201348182">Hey Sara!<br/>
<br/>
What charter school are you with? we&#39;ve been in Idaho Virtual Academy <br/>
this year, using the K12 curriculum. After seven years of doing it on <br/>
my own, though I&#39;ve never been an unschooler as described here, I <br/>
have been relaxed. My kids have played more than any other thing, but <br/>
I&#39;ve also gotten lessons together for them using curriculum such as <br/>
KONOS.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I sent an email to our &quot;teacher&quot; (educational specialist! <br/>
Love it!) yesterday, telling her our decision not to re-enroll next <br/>
year, and should we withdraw now or wait, sometimes utilizing the K12 <br/>
curriculum, but not necessarily? She advised withdrawing now, if I&#39;m <br/>
not going to mark progress with the school (which I might&#39;ve or might <br/>
not...)<br/>
<br/>
Why not talk to*your* State Employee...um, what SHOULD we call these <br/>
people...Intermediary Just Here to Help the Mere Moms Do It Right...<br/>
<br/>
Tell her you intend to withdraw (don&#39;t say &quot;we&#39;d like to&quot; Use <br/>
stronger language) and ask her advice whether now or at the end of <br/>
the year would be better.<br/>
<br/>
that&#39;s what I did. I&#39;m getting together the returnable curriculum <br/>
items over the next few days and finding out where to ship them to. <br/>
And then shipping them. HA!<br/>
<br/>

position is that homeschooling is a poor second to the wonderful hard work <br/>
they do. Just do what YOU want to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485738541">--- Hi Heidi!<br/>
We have been with Horizon Instructional Systems out of Lincoln, Ca. <br/>
They are HUGE and very organized. The sites are all over and offer <br/>
many classes.  We do have money to spend for materials, classes and <br/>
computers but that money of course is tied to testing, work samples <br/>
and meeting with our &quot;educational specialist.&quot; They have become much <br/>
more restrictive and controlling. My daughter was not interested in <br/>
any of the classes this year, we already have two computers here at <br/>
home and I wanted to follow a more traditional approach to subject <br/>
matter so we have not used hardly any of our budget for curriculm <br/>
materials. So, no they have not contributed much to our home <br/>
schooling environment except pressure to produce work samples and <br/>
learning records that meet &quot;their&quot; (i.e. California standards) <br/>
subjective ideas. I was also asked to sign a statement that my child <br/>
would participate in the SAT 9 testing with the understanding that if <br/>
we refused to test that our enrollment in the charter next fall would <br/>
be at risk.  BLACKMAIL!!!  All of this is why I feel ready to jump <br/>
ship.  I have been doing so much reading about my rights in Calif. <br/>
and what we can do.  Then last night I went to the California <br/>
Department of Education website and the information there scared the <br/>
you know what out of me!  Those of you in California let me know how <br/>
you did it and what has happened, if anything. I feel vey alone and <br/>
worrried about doing the right thing now and in the future for my <br/>
daughter. What if she decides she wants to go to high school in a few <br/>
years?  Will it be hard for her to get in?  Anyone been through that <br/>
issue?  I love this site.  You are all so involved and helpful.  <br/>
Thanks so much from the &quot;newbie.&quot;  Sara<br/>
