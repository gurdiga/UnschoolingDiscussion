You&#39;re right.  Adding the word &quot;radical&quot; to something that is already<br/>
radical (meaning &quot;fundamental&quot;) is merely adding hyperbole, but without<br/>
meaning. There&#39;s homeschooling (which, to most people today means, &quot;doing<br/>
school at home&quot; whether it&#39;s a classical style or ecclectic or religious),<br/>
and there&#39;s unschooling which means NOT doing &quot;school&quot; at home.  Some are<br/>
now calling it &quot;natural&quot; learning, and that seems to mean whatever is<br/>
&quot;picked up&quot; through living...the term has a positive, new-age flavor that<br/>
just might eventually replace the &quot;UN&quot; word.<br/>
<br/>
There are sure to be arguments and complaints about what I&#39;ve said, however.<br/>

You didn&#39;t answer the question.<br/>
Radical got added to unschooling because of people using the word <br/>
unschooling inappropriately.<br/>
There were entire e list and message boards(still are)dedicated to <br/>
unschooling that were dominated by ecclectics types who called <br/>
themselves unschoolers.<br/>
So when someone who was an actual unschooler came on the list and <br/>
started discussing ideas, they got put into the &quot;radical&quot; category.<br/>
I know people IRL who call themselves unschoolers, who are very much <br/>
not.  They consider me a radical one.<br/>
To me, you either unschool or you don&#39;t.  No radical needed.<br/>

is.  It is pretty well accepted...but when I used the word &quot;Un&quot; to my mother <br/>
red flags got thrown up every where.<br/>
