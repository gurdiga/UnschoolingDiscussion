 Here in FL, I know many people who turn in portfolio&#39;s with mostly pictures <br/>
 of where they went and what their children do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I did. The &quot;examples&quot; of their work were art pictures or anything <br/>
they had built or collected from road trips. I only brought a few of those. <br/>
Mainly what I showed was a scrapbook with loads of pictures and descriptive <br/>
sentences underneath.<br/>
The bad thing, is that I geared the scrapbook towards the evaluation instead <br/>
of just doing it for US. I realized this after a couple of years and decided <br/>
to quit doing that, they&#39;d just have to deal with it. But then we moved and I <br/>
didn&#39;t register in the new county. Problem solved. <br/>
I was doing the scrapbook for the school year...from Sept. to June. Dumb!  I <br/>
would just do it as our &quot;2002 memories&quot; or something that I&#39;d make anyway, <br/>
with or without evals. if I did that again. But I won&#39;t. &#39;Cuz the umbrella <br/>
schools are way less invasive and there are a couple run by unschoolers down <br/>
here...the cost is minimal.<br/>

 I find the portfolio option just as offensive as tests. It is saying that <br/>
 you can only prove what you have learned if you then write it down <br/>
 to demonstrate that fact. Just like testing. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I don&#39;t think they aren&#39;t nearly as offensive. If only for the reason <br/>
that you don&#39;t have to prove anything other than the fact that the child <br/>
progressed in the last year. The paren&#39;ts summary is one of the most <br/>
important things they consider, and it&#39;s all up to you really.  If a nine <br/>
y.o. isn&#39;t reading, they technically can&#39;t say anything about that, you only <br/>
have to show that he&#39;s doing more than last year!  The worst that has ever <br/>
happened here is that an evaluator has said there isn&#39;t enough english or <br/>
math in a portfolio and you have to turn some stuff in by August. I&#39;ve never <br/>
heard of them not passing anyone, ever.<br/>
If that happened to me I&#39;d just be up front and tell them we aren&#39;t turning <br/>
anything more in, ever.  The good thing is you can find an unschool friendly <br/>
evaluator and then that won&#39;t even happen. I am going to be speaking with and <br/>
&quot;educating&quot; an evaluator here in pensacola to help her know how to handle <br/>
unschoolers. She&#39;s all excited about doing it and wants to understand <br/>
unschooling better. Very cool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But how do you turn in a portfolio if your child wont write anything? <br/>
My 7yo has read all the Roald Dahl books and the Harry Pooter <br/>
books in the last month. He has also talked about probabilty with <br/>
his dad and rolled dice.<br/>
We have no proof of any of this as he refuses to write anything <br/>
down. As is his write. He says, and I agree, that his learning is in <br/>
his head and he doesn&#39;t want to put it on a piece of paper.<br/>
<br/>
My other two often write but often destroy their stuff when they <br/>
have finished with it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; <br/>
But how do you turn in a portfolio if your child wont write anything?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They can dictate and you can type.  Or you can play word games and list <br/>
those.  The portfolio doesn&#39;t have to be written by the child.  Kids don&#39;t <br/>
write their own school records.  That&#39;s the teacher&#39;s job.  <br/>
<br/>
You could have a list of storytelling and narrative incidents (telling a <br/>
movie after he gets home, reporting on something he did, telling you what <br/>
happened when he visited another house, and that can be worded in <br/>
&quot;educationalese&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My 7yo has read all the Roald Dahl books and the Harry Pooter <br/>
books in the last month.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could interview him.  Ask him what he liked best or whatever, and put <br/>
that down in interview form.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching 15 year olds, I never used written book reports.  They <br/>
sat with me and told me about the book and we discussed it.  For one thing, <br/>
it&#39;s easier to spot faking (if they hadn&#39;t read the book).  For another, I cou<br/>
ld ask them things about THEIR interests and their own ideas and get them <br/>
thinking about the book in a different way than they might have in <br/>
traditional book-report fashion.<br/>
<br/>
You could do the kinds of analysis that&#39;s beyond the writing ability of <br/>
anyone the child&#39;s age if you do it verbally.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My other two often write but often destroy their stuff when they <br/>
have finished with it..&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Will they type/&quot;keyboard&quot;?  Put your &quot;Word&quot; program on every-thirty-seconds <br/>
automatic save or something! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Include photos, museum brochures, ticket stubs, lists of books read, lists <br/>
of magazines read, lists of games played. Keep a very brief journal (in <br/>
educationese if necessary) on discussions had, comments made, observations <br/>
noted, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We did this for the charter school. *You* can write. I turned in<br/>
printouts of the books Rain checked out and read from the library. I<br/>
wrote summaries of discussions we&#39;d had. I turned in game score sheets,<br/>
mad libs pages (that I&#39;d written, but she came up with the words, and<br/>
there was a lot of &quot;toilet&quot; and &quot;poopy&quot; in some of them), pictures of her<br/>
doing stuff (rolling dice, if you want, and caption it &quot;working with<br/>
probability&quot;). I know some people who did audiorecordings with the<br/>
computer and stuck them on disks. I know people who did &quot;math logs&quot; and<br/>
noted all the times a kid used math in a week - game playing, cooking,<br/>
standard stuff. We used flyers from exhibits and museums and wrote on it<br/>
&quot;attended this on such-and-such date&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about &quot;proof&quot;, per se. If you were going to lie about what your<br/>
kids were doing, you could just as easily fill out a few worksheets for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
It was a little different for us because Rain always had the option to<br/>
drop out of the charter, which we eventually did...but she never ended up<br/>
doing anything special for their paperback, anything she wasn&#39;t already<br/>
doing.<br/>

YOU write it, keep a weekly journal!<br/>
DO they ever send Thank you notes to Relatives? Copy them before you send<br/>
them out along with anything you may &quot;remove from the trash to put in the<br/>
recycling bin&quot;<br/>
Photo&#39;s and a Mom&#39;s journal make a pretty full portfolio, especially if you<br/>
divide them into &quot;subjects&quot; to make it easier for the educrats to see the<br/>
learning.<br/>

 <br/>
 My other two often write but often destroy their stuff when they <br/>
 have finished with it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is where the photographs come in handy. Take pictures of them doing <br/>
their everyday stuff, whatever you think would make a fun picture or document <br/>
what they do.  If your child has you translate his ideas to paper, that <br/>
counts too. Like I said, you don&#39;t have to prove the child is doing a certain <br/>
thing, only  that they are progressing (pretty impossible for a person not to <br/>
show some progress of something in a years time).<br/>
Do they do art? Throw in a couple of samples.<br/>
Do your kids collect anything? Show a picture of the collection or bring a <br/>
sample in.<br/>
Write a list of movies you watch and books you read....it&#39;s fun to have later <br/>
anyway.<br/>
So much of what we do can not be taken in to an evaluation anyway, trips to <br/>
science museums, gallery nights etc....Pictures, pictures, pictures. <br/>
When you travel, or visit a cool place just grab a brochure if you can&#39;t take <br/>
a picture that day.  I had such a full scrapbook of pictures, they don&#39;t have <br/>
much time to do anything else during the eval.<br/>
They will usually have a reading child read them a small sentence or <br/>
paragraph. But if your child does not read they can&#39;t ask for that.<br/>
If my child didn&#39;t want to I&#39;d just decline that portion.<br/>
Evals. were a cinch for us, and my kids actually enjoyed it because it was <br/>
their time to show off everything they had fun doing all year. The evaluator <br/>
we had made it seem not at all like a test or that any pressure was on them. <br/>
It was just a chance for them to shine for someone other than Mom.<br/>
I would be careful in selecting a relaxed evaluator though, some of them <br/>
would probably freak out if they knew I had a 9 y.o. that didn&#39;t read.<br/>
I think the umbrella schools are the best option for many.<br/>

<br/>
Some of Kirby and Marty&#39;s first &quot;record keeping&quot; was lists of action figures. <br/>
 Sometimes it was finding a list already printed out or online and marking <br/>
those they had, and using another mark for those they hoped to get.  <br/>
Sometimes it was making a list by copying the names off the card, or comic, <br/>
or game.<br/>
