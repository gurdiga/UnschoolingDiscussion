&lt;&lt; I just hope we can avoid the &quot;What and who really is unschooling?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
discussion, pretty please? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, that discussion we can&#39;t avoid.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is unschooling?&quot; ends up involving looking at what is NOT unschooling, <br/>
and if we stop discussing that, we have no reason to have this list.<br/>
