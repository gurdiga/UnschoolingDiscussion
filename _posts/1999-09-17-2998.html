<div id="ygrps-yiv-348555698">Welcome Timea,<br/>
I have always unschooled but I understand it can take up to  a year for<br/>
every year in school to deschool. It seems to me though, that they will<br/>
always be learning, maybe just not actively until they adjust. Welcome to<br/>
the list. I unschool 5 children ages 2-7. What made you decide to begin home<br/>
educating? And what led you to unschooling?<br/>
