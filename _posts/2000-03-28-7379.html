<div id="ygrps-yiv-966760457">Our day so far:   kids got up e-a-r-l-y!!! 11 1/2 y.o.dd got up at 6:30(the<br/>
birds woke her) 8 yo dd got up at 7:00.<br/>
  Older dd ate, read newspaper, walked dogs (all 3 or them), stopped at<br/>
grandparents house(they live over the stream and through the woods), then<br/>
she spent quite a bit of time doing Carmen SanDiego&#39;s Great chase through<br/>
Time CD-ROM. then more food, then worked on Body Language in Horses project<br/>
she decided to do. Now is grooming one of the dogs--said she&#39;s going to play<br/>
her fiddle for a while and then do some geometry. Has a 4H meeting tonight.<br/>
  8 yo got dressed, drank juice (not a breakfast eater). Dressed her doll.<br/>
Then we went outside to look for signs of fairies, being careful not to step<br/>
on them!!!.  Then put laundry in dryer, went to store to get matchbox car<br/>
for physics experiment she wants to do, came home, did inertia experiments,<br/>
ate something, read stories, watched video on Alexander Calder while eating<br/>
lunch. Then she put her doll down for a nap, and just made herself hot<br/>
cocoa.  Next we fold laundry and I want to clean up a bit.<br/>
  it has been nice not to have to go anywhere today!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009474439">Hi all,  I  am enjoying reading  how many of your families fill the average, <br/>
or not so average day.  One question comes to mind if you have kids 5 and <br/>
older-- Do you recall about the age your child began really persuing things <br/>
independently?  For me right now,  my oldest is 5.  There are some things he <br/>
will do on his own, but for the most part he really needs my assistance when <br/>
working on something.  The difficulty for me is that my kids often compete <br/>
for my attention ( my other two are 3yo, and 6 mos).   I get somewhat <br/>
concerned that my oldest gets slighted because I  get so distracted by having <br/>
to keep up with the other two, as well; and my 3 yo &#39;s skill level is not up <br/>
to that of his bro&#39;s, so they cannot do the same things very often.  As it <br/>
is, the baby does not take long naps, which would otherwise open up more time <br/>
for the boys.  In fact, neither of the older kids nap, either.  I guess I am <br/>
finding it hard to balance things out.  But, I must add, that there are some <br/>
very good days, or even better times within a given day, and it is not all <br/>
negative.  It is easier when my hubby is home to help with the baby, and I&#39;m  <br/>
sure it will get easier as the kids get a bit older.  So, while I do cherish <br/>
this time in their lives, I can say that I do look forward to my kids being <br/>
able to do a little more for themselves, too.  Thanks for &quot;listening&quot;!          <br/>

I&#39;m right there with ya on that!  My eldest is 8 and he can work pretty well <br/>
independently.  My 6 yo prefers to have me help him, even on the things that <br/>
he CAN do alone.  He just still needs that security.  The baby, of course, <br/>
needs constant cuddles and caring.  By the end of the day I often feel that I <br/>
have been putting fires out all day long.  It will be easier when the 6 yo <br/>
learns to read.  I&#39;m trying to treasure this short, precious time but I&#39;m <br/>
sooooo tired.    I know these years will be gone before I know it.<br/>

<br/>
Depends on what the project is but both of mine will do a lot of things on <br/>
their own -- they are 6 3/4 and 5.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The difficulty for me is that my kids often compete <br/>
 for my attention ( my other two are 3yo, and 6 mos). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Happens all the time.  I tell them to cut it out!  Really.  They know what <br/>
they are doing and they know I am doing my best and they have to take turns.  <br/>
Sometimes I am nice about it and sometimes I am not so nice -- hey, they&#39;re <br/>
bugging me!  Usually it&#39;s a lot of fun but sometimes . . . <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I get somewhat <br/>
 concerned that my oldest gets slighted because I  get so distracted by <br/>
having <br/>
 to keep up with the other two, as well;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Happens all the time.  They both claim that &quot;you never do anything with me.&quot;  <br/>
Of course, first one says it and then the other.  They are kids!  Then they <br/>
find something to do before I have a chance to get to whatever urgent thing <br/>
it was I was supposed to be doing with them in the 1st place.  :)  Or they <br/>
end up doing something together if I have to take a phone call or something <br/>
(we have abiz out of the hosue).  Somehow they manage quite nicely!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; and my 3 yo &#39;s skill level is not up <br/>
 to that of his bro&#39;s, so they cannot do the same things very often.  As it <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s exactly what it is -- balancing!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But, I must add, that there are some <br/>
 very good days, or even better times within a given day, and it is not all <br/>
 negative.  It is easier when my hubby is home to help with the baby, and I&#39;m <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
Yeah, right!!  I&#39;m not holding my breath!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347020006">Hi Karen-<br/>
I enjoyed your post, and boy do I know what you&#39;re talking about.  With kids <br/>
of any age, life is a continuous balancing act.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote:<br/>
&lt;&lt; Do you recall about the age your child began really persuing things <br/>
 independently? &gt;&gt;<br/>
I think this differs so much from child to child.  My 2yo now is very <br/>
independent and will sit and draw with markers in her high chair or play peg <br/>
board or doll house for an hour or so without any assistance.  My 4 1/2 yo, <br/>
otoh, needs constant assistance from me to pursue his interests.  I think one <br/>
key is to really watch them and find out what they are interested in and then <br/>
use these interests to build on things.  Sometimes my kids under 6 are all <br/>
together-but all doing different things.  For instance, my 6 yo loves to play <br/>
imaginary games outside.  My 4 yo loves more work-oriented things.  So, I <br/>
might let the 6 yo play, get the 4yo started raking leaves, put the 2 yo in <br/>
the sand box and then carry the baby around in the sling while I hang wash on <br/>
the line. <br/>
 <br/>
You also wrote:<br/>

One bit of advice I took away from a h/sing conference I attended once was <br/>
this:  Take a look at how much time you think you have each week or each day <br/>
to spend one on one with each child and then cut that in half and then set up <br/>
a time with that child and honor it.  They get to do anything they want (you <br/>
can set limits like monetary ones, of course!) with you and they have you <br/>
entirely to themselves.  You can do a separate time with Dad too.<br/>
We have done this in my home for about a year.  Each child gets 15 minutes a <br/>
day to spend with Mom and 15 minutes a week with Dad.  This sounds like <br/>
little time, I know, but remember something is better than nothing.  And this <br/>
is their EXCLUSIVE time.  This has helped a lot for me with the younger ones <br/>
especially.  They have learned to save what they think is important for those <br/>
times.<br/>
I&#39;m glad you can see the positive, too, because this time when they are <br/>
little really does fly!  Good luck...<br/>

My daughter is 8, and she&#39;s gradually become more independent over the last <br/>
two years (which is good since we have a 14 mo boy).  She made great leaps in <br/>
her independence when she learned how to read last summer - she went from <br/>
puzzling out words in March to reading chapter books by the fall.  Now she&#39;s <br/>
*extremely* independent.   My oldest is 12 yo.  It seems like he&#39;s been <br/>
independent forever (::::wistful grin::::).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AHA!  I finally figured out why I couldn&#39;t answer this question about my<br/>
children.  There is no magical age for independence...... and nothing ever<br/>
stays the same. The 8 year old who may be content to do her own thing will<br/>
become a clinging vine at 11.  The 14 year old who thinks they are all so<br/>
fired independent will sit in your rocking chair at 17 and ask for you to<br/>
explain things you thought she knew years ago.  I turn 40 this year and I<br/>
find myself more needy for company and approval then I have in over a<br/>
decade.<br/>
<br/>
Factor in different personalities and there is just no way to say that by<br/>
___ the kids will be living and learning self-directed and self-motivated<br/>
lives.  It&#39;s much more of a dance, with partners and music changing and<br/>
shifting over a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Not losing yourself to everyone&#39;s needs is something I&#39;ve struggled with and<br/>
I suspect almost all parents do.<br/>
