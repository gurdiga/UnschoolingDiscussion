                      2007 Highlights: Linda Ball<br/>
    Rethinking Education welcomes Linda Ball, a talented healer and single parent<br/>
<br/>
   When I was a child, I established a humorous and inspirational card line called &quot;Ballmark&quot; (get it?) with the logo of a banner across a globe declaring &quot;Lend a Ball!&quot; If you accept the Spanish translation of my name to be &quot;Beautiful Ball (of Light)&quot; then this logo still expresses my soul mission - and yours-, for I believe that all we have to do each day is be the beautiful ball of light that we are and shine brightness into everything we do. That&#39;s it. Now doesn&#39;t that cure those panic attacks and nervous stomachs? My business is called &quot;Lighten Up&quot; Healing Therapies, specifically to remind me to keep a sense of humor and to stay focused on the high side of people and our life adventures. The birth of my amazing son, Michael Ball of Light, propelled me onto the path of Holistic Medicine seventeen years ago when our scheduled water birth became an emergency Caesarean, and my partnership with his father dissolved turning me magically into &quot;poof!&quot; a single parent. I sought<br/>
 healing for my emotional and physical pain and relief came though learning Reiki and other natural healing modalities such as Qi Gong, Yoga, Meditation, CranioSacral, BodyTalk and Massage. I am now returning to my early interests in art, music and writing. I am working on a book about my experiences with Reiki and also creating a CD to promote rapid recovery after surgery or illness.<br/>
  Linda will host:<br/>
  Unschooling as a Single Parent: Tips and Tidbits<br/>
  Whether you are divorced, separated, or never married, I am facilitating this topic as a solution- finding forum for the unique challenges a single parent faces. How do I keep my job without turning my child over to daycare? How can I be a homeschool parent and still be the breadwinner? When my son was young, I could not find any role models that had resolved these predicaments. In fact, one speaker suggested that I take out an ad and find a partner fast, because homeschooling alone was impossible. Well, I&#39;m still single, but through trial and error, I now have some ideas and resources to share, and I would love to hear what has worked for some of you, too!<br/>
  Working the New Male/Female Relationship Models<br/>
  This topic is so hot, I almost don&#39;t want to touch it. But let&#39;s do it anyway! More than any other group I know, Unschoolers are as experimental in their relationships as they are with their children&#39;s schooling. We&#39;re not just talking about roles shifting as to who goes to work and who stays at home, but how do we balance the male/female polarities within ourselves without losing the sexual balance in our relationships? Come think out-of-the-box about what is means to be a man or a woman. The first part of the class is discussion to surprise our minds; the second part is a sensory activity to surprise our bodies. Come as a couple if you can, but a partner is not required.<br/>
<br/>
                    Want to Learn More about the Wonderful Life called Unschooling?<br/>
  <br/>
   Join hundreds of unschooling families from around the globe as we rethink the meanings of education, learning and parenting. Rethinking Education supports attachment parenting, unconditional love, support for each person&#39;s unique journey of life experience, freedom with responsibility, unschooling and you. YOU are the vital ingredient at this conference, as we come together and revel in the magic and mystery of kindred spirits and each other&#39;s rich diversity, as we challenge ourselves to trust the extraordinary process of living and learning, the wondrous ability to improve the ways we communicate, discovering new ways of listening to one another, giving full support to our dreams, no matter how wild or ordinary, large or small.<br/>
  Unschooling is vital to the profoundly intelligent development of our children. And yes, as adults we can even unschool ourselves... as you will discover.<br/>
<br/>
                    <br/>
   Let us put our minds together and see what we will make for our children.<br/>

                    We&#39;re Building a Yurt!<br/>
  <br/>
  RE supporter Laurence Becker is making big plans to orchestrate the building of a yurt at the conference. Pitch in to help with the sawing, drilling and assembly. Next year the RE kids will paint it and it will become a permanent playhouse for them to use at future conferences. Learn how to build your own functional yurt! For the uninitiated, a yurt is an 8 sided, round building that is easy to assemble, break down and transport. Good for both permanent living, guest house, play house, or for traveling. Google for lots of info on yurts!<br/>

                    MORE 2007 Highlights: Jim Lemon<br/>
    RE welcomes Jim Lemon with his great combination of passion for the environment, simplified ways of living, creativity & unschooling<br/>
<br/>
   35 years ago, I read that &quot;white men live in boxes&quot; which accounts for our lack of balance. Living in a tipi, then constructing several log hexagons, gardens, and canoe trips have been my way to seek balance. Having been disenchanted by city life in the Dallas/ Fort Worth Metroplex, I fled to the Piney Woods of East Texas. Having few skills but lots of energy and help from friends have made my close-to-Nature lifestyle possible. Homescooling our children, offering environmental camps through Sierra Club and SFA (Stephen F. Austin University) Arboretum and organizing lots of river trips from the Buffalo to the Rio Grande have been my way to give back to life. &quot;Nature Deficit Disorder&quot; is rampant and virtual cures don&#39;t have substance. The popular(?) new country-western song &quot;I&#39;d like to pick your ticks&quot; is only one example of how the seemingly &quot;inconvenient truths&quot; of country liivng can be a gift to the creative homesteader. Cold showers before bedtime and summers in the<br/>
 mountains help in the heat of Texas summers. Wood heaters , saunas, and lots of rainfall make fall and winter wonderful. Spring flood and inland hurricanes keep spring a surprise.<br/>
  Jim will host:<br/>
  Off the Grid<br/>
  Off the grid living is not simpler or easier but it can be cheaper than conventional living. After 35 years off the power grid, a 2nd marriage, and 2 homeschooled children later, I have as much to learn as I do to share about unconventional living. As the children mature, their challenges with being different from their peers in how they live their lives is an unexpected bonus and hurdle to confront. As I mature, the need for less strenuous systems is apparent.<br/>
  For those of you like Jim who need regular contact with the Natural World, Jim will be leading a walk in North Lake Park, not far from the hotel on Sunday morning. We will car pool or caravan from the hotel. Anyone is welcome, especially kids who have grown ups attached. Bring water to drink and snacks if you desire. We will return at noon.<br/>
