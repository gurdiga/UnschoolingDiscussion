&lt;&lt; The math textbook is often a jumping off place for <br/>

This sentence brings up a question that constantly nags at me about <br/>
unschooling.  We used to do Calvert a few years ago, and though a lot of it <br/>
was dull and redundant, there were oftentimes things brought up in the <br/>
textbooks that we &quot;jumped off from.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For example, my oldest son was in 4th grade then and he studied Art History <br/>
and Raphael was one of the painters they talked about.  Two years later, he <br/>
still points out every print he sees that he thinks was painted by Raphael <br/>
and he has a great interest in Medieval art that I don&#39;t think would have <br/>
come without that text.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed this in other areas, too, with my other kids.  And I wonder...if <br/>
I weren&#39;t using these texts, how would they have been exposed to this? I <br/>
would never have just started talking about Raphael because it isn&#39;t really <br/>
part of my &quot;expertise.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m saying is...Aren&#39;t textbooks valuable sometimes if they <br/>
provide that &quot;jumping off point&quot; and if we take the kid&#39;s lead and really do <br/>
&quot;jump off?&quot;  Isn&#39;t the problem with textbooks mainly that we feel <br/>
&quot;programmed&quot; to use them in a rigidly defined way?<br/>
<br/>
My 7 yo discovered a high school biology textbook from the 1950&#39;s at a <br/>
library sale; begged for it-and it&#39;s become one of his most cherished <br/>
possessions. He even took it to the Dr. to show him!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling...just wanted to share some thoughts and questions.  Any <br/>
opinions welcome.  Thanks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Carol, thanks for putting into words some thoughts I&#39;ve had.  My daughter&#39;s<br/>
last picks at a thrift store included textbooks in American History  (about<br/>
5th grade), Biology (highschool), and Psychology (college level).  These<br/>
cost 39 cents each.<br/>
<br/>
It bothered me at first, thinking maybe she had been so programmed to the ps<br/>
methods that she couldn&#39;t envision learning any other way.  And indeed, this<br/>
may be part of it.  But on talking to her, she is just interested in these<br/>
books and isn&#39;t following the interest the heart of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
When I think about the problems we had with traditional curriculum, they<br/>
really had more to do with the rigid methodology we used.  I don&#39;t intend to<br/>
ever again force her to endure material that bores her, or answer written<br/>
questions, or take tests that prove nothing.  But I don&#39;t see why textbooks<br/>
can&#39;t be a great source of material as long as they are used in the same way<br/>
any other book would be used -- to pursue a real interest, and without<br/>
regard to &quot;grade level&quot;.  And as long as they are part of her resources, not<br/>
the whole.<br/>
<br/>
To me, to rigidly disregard or dismiss textbooks as a resource would be as<br/>
big a mistake as rigidly following them.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811961362">We have a 1920&#39;s set of encyclopedias and the kidlets love them.  there is<br/>
a whole section on how to care for babies &lt;g&gt;  All kinds of cute drawings<br/>
including how to fold diapers and how to give bathes and shows how to use<br/>
your elbow to test the water.  Youngest kidlet (8) reads the thing and then<br/>
practices on her doll.  I caught her the other day muttering to herself<br/>
that some of it was really &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;well, Sara, we aren&#39;t going to wait.<br/>

there&#39;s no way we could do so about *everything*.  Between my husband and I<br/>
was can cover an awful lot of ground because we both have wide and varied<br/>
interests, but neither one of us would ever begin talking about<br/>
microbiology. And guess what, I have a child that drools over microbiology<br/>
textbooks.  It was truly disconcerting to find her interests were in an area<br/>
that I not only knew little about, I didn&#39;t want to know more either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling to me is broad enough to accept any style or way of learning, as<br/>
long as no one is fighting and being drug down by the *shoulds*.  My oldest<br/>
used quite a  number of texts in her own way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Books like this are wonderful, because you compare and contrast them, thus<br/>
learning all kinds of things.  One year we compared a 4th grade history text<br/>
from Abeka and a Catholic school text.  It was eye opening to read the same<br/>
event from different perspectives.  After the Abeka book chastised the Greek<br/>
culture for not being Christian.... um.. when Christianity hadn&#39;t been<br/>
invented yet, Sara refused to even open the book anymore.  This was an<br/>
eye-opening day for me, because I truly did not know she was reading so<br/>
closely.  Remember how we used to read textbooks ---looking for the right<br/>
answer to the questions we had to turn in.  Well, it seems without the<br/>
pressure to do that kind of stuff, true critical reading can take place.  ;)<br/>

<div><strong>Although I&#39;m by no means an unschooling expert.&nbsp; I would have 
to say that whatever the child wants to use, whether that be a textbook or not, 
I&#39;m certainly&nbsp;going to let them use what they want.&nbsp; We can certainly 
be flexible about what they decide to use to become educated.&nbsp; I have told 
my older DD that if she chooses to use a curriculum than that is her 
choice.&nbsp; But when I mentioned that the approach this year was unschooling, 
she &#39;yipeed&#39; just as much as my younger DD!&nbsp; And she asked me to buy her a 
course on learning Japanese!&nbsp; Of course, it is because she is into online
