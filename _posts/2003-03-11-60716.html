Learning to Be Stupid in the Culture of Cash<br/>
March 8, 2003<br/>
By Luciana Bohne<br/>
<br/>
You might think that reading about a podunk university&#39;s English<br/>
teacher&#39;s attempt to connect the dots between the poverty of American<br/>
education and the gullibility of the American public may be a little<br/>
trivial, considering we&#39;re about to embark on the first, openly-<br/>
confessed imperial adventure of senescent capitalism in the US, but<br/>
bear with me. The question my experiences in the classroom raise is<br/>
why have these young people been educated to such abysmal depths of<br/>
ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t read,&quot; says a junior without the slightest self-<br/>
consciousness. She has not the smallest hint that professing a<br/>
habitual preference for not reading at a university is like bragging<br/>
in ordinary life that one chooses not to breathe. She is in my &quot;World<br/>
Literature&quot; class. She has to read novels by African, Latin American,<br/>
and Asian authors. She is not there by choice: it&#39;s just<br/>
a &quot;distribution&quot; requirement for graduation, and it&#39;s easier than<br/>
philosophy--she thinks.<br/>
<br/>
The novel she has trouble reading is Isabel Allende&#39;s &quot;Of Love and<br/>
Shadows,&quot; set in the post-coup terror of Pinochet&#39;s junta&#39;s Nazi-<br/>
style regime in Chile, 1973-1989. No one in the class, including the<br/>
English majors, can write a focussed essay of analysis, so I have to<br/>
teach that. No one in the class knows where Chile is, so I make<br/>
photocopies of general information from world guide surveys. No one<br/>
knows what socialism or fascism is, so I spend time writing up<br/>
digestible definitions. No one knows what Plato&#39;s &quot;Allegory of the<br/>
Cave&quot; is, and I supply it because it&#39;s impossible to understand the<br/>
theme of the novel without a basic knowledge of that work--which used<br/>
to be required reading a few generations ago. And no one in the class<br/>
has ever heard of 11 September 1973, the CIA-sponsored coup which<br/>
terminated Chile&#39;s mature democracy. There is complete shock when I<br/>
supply US de-classified documents proving US collusion with the<br/>
generals&#39; coup and the assassination of elected president, Salvador<br/>
Allende.<br/>
<br/>
Geography, history, philosophy, and political science--all missing<br/>
from their preparation. I realize that my students are, in fact, the<br/>
oppressed, as Paulo Freire&#39;s &quot;The Education of the Oppressed&quot; pointed<br/>
out, and that they are paying for their own oppression. So, I<br/>
patiently explain: no, our government has not been the friend of<br/>
democracy in Chile; yes, our government did fund both the coup and<br/>
the junta torture-machine; yes, the same goes for most of Latin<br/>
America. Then, one student asks, &quot;Why?&quot; Well, I say, the CIA and the<br/>
corporations run roughshod over the world in part because of the<br/>
ignorance of the people of the United States, which apparently is<br/>
induced by formal education, reinforced by the media, and cheered by<br/>
Hollywood. As the more people read, the less they know and the more<br/>
indoctrinated they become, you get this national enabling stupidity<br/>
to attain which they go into bottomless pools of debt. If it weren&#39;t<br/>
tragic, it would be funny.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, this expensive stupidity facilitates US funding of the<br/>
bloody work of death squads, juntas, and terror regimes abroad. It<br/>
permits the war we are about to wage--an unfair, illegal, unjust,<br/>
illogical, and expensive war, which announces to the world the<br/>
failure of our intelligence and, by the way, the creeping weakness of<br/>
our economic system. Every man, woman, and child killed by a bomb,<br/>
bullet, famine, or polluted water will be murder--and a war crime.<br/>
And it will signal the impotence of American education to produce<br/>
brains equipped with the bare necessities for democratic survival:<br/>
analyzing and asking questions.<br/>
<br/>
Let me put it succinctly: I don&#39;t think serious education is possible<br/>
in America. Anything you touch in the annals of knowledge is a foe of<br/>
this system of commerce and profit, run amok. The only education that<br/>
can be permitted is if it acculturates to the status quo, as happens<br/>
in the expensive schools, or if it produces people to police and<br/>
enforce the status quo, as in the state school where I teach.<br/>
Significantly, at my school, which is a third-tier university,<br/>
servicing working-class, first-generation college graduates who enter<br/>
lower-etchelon jobs in the civil service, education, or middle<br/>
management, the favored academic concentrations are communications,<br/>
criminal justice, and social work--basically how to mystify, cage,<br/>
and control the masses.<br/>
<br/>
This education is a vast waste of the resources and potential of the<br/>
young. It is boring beyond belief and useless--except to the powers<br/>
and interests that depend on it. When A Ukranian student, a three-<br/>
week arrival on these shores, writes the best-organized and most<br/>
profound essay in English of the class, American education has<br/>
something to answer for--especially to our youth.<br/>
<br/>
But the detritus and debris that American education has become is<br/>
both planned and instrumental. It&#39;s why our media succeeds in telling<br/>
lies. It&#39;s why our secretary of state can quote from a graduate-<br/>
student paper, claiming confidently that the stolen data came from<br/>
the highest intelligence sources. It&#39;s why Picasso&#39;s &quot;Guernica&quot; can<br/>
be covered up during his preposterous &quot;report&quot; to the UN without<br/>
anyone guessing the political significance of this gesture and the<br/>
fascist sensibility that it protects.<br/>
<br/>
Cultural fascism manifests itself in an aversion to thought and<br/>
cultural refinement. &quot;When I hear the word &#39;culture,&#39;&quot; Goebbels<br/>
said, &quot;I reach for my revolver.&quot; One of the infamous and telling<br/>
reforms the Pinochet regime implemented was educational reform. The<br/>
basic goal was to end the university&#39;s role as a source of social<br/>
criticism and political opposition. The order came to dismantle the<br/>
departments of philosophy, social and political science, humanities<br/>
and the arts--areas in which political discussions were likely to<br/>
occur. The universities were ordered to issue degrees only in<br/>
business management, computer programming, engineering, medicine and<br/>
dentistry-- vocational training schools, which in reality is what<br/>
American education has come to resemble, at least at the level of<br/>
mass education. Our students can graduate without ever touching a<br/>
foreign language, philosophy, elements of any science, music or art,<br/>
history, and political science, or economics. In fact, our students<br/>
learn to live in an electoral democracy devoid of politics-- a<br/>
feature the dwindling crowds at the voting booths well illustrate.<br/>
<br/>
The poet Percy Bysshe Shelley wrote that, in the rapacity that the<br/>
industrial revolution created, people first surrendered their minds<br/>
or the capacity to reason, then their hearts or the capacity to<br/>
empathize, until all that was left of the original human equipment<br/>
was the senses or their selfish demands for gratification. At that<br/>
point, humans entered the stage of market commodities and market<br/>
consumers--one more thing in the commercial landscape. Without minds<br/>
or hearts, they are instrumentalized to buy whatever deadens their<br/>
clamoring and frightened senses--official lies, immoral wars,<br/>
Barbies, and bankrupt educations.<br/>
<br/>
Meanhile, in my state, the governor has ordered a 10% cut across the<br/>
board for all departments in the state--including education.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991503196">I forward this article on to my husband and he had some interesting <br/>
observations. Thought I&#39;d share them with the group.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I enjoyed the article, but she presents a dichotomy: She decries the state <br/>
&gt;&gt;of the educational system, yet she bemoans the cut in spending on <br/>
&gt;&gt;education.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Also: She is upset that her students have never heard of Plato&#39;s Allegory <br/>
&gt;of the Cave, without acknowledging that this work is a complex and <br/>
&gt;long-winded metaphor which can be summed up in a single sentence <br/>
&gt;(perception is not reality -- and guess what? It turns out that Plato was <br/>
&gt;wrong, perception IS reality; see The Matrix). I imagine that a teacher <br/>
&gt;would spend a couple of weeks on this single subject (read it aloud, <br/>
&gt;discuss it, do worksheets?, write a paper...). And of course, all of this <br/>
&gt;is necessary to understand an obscure novel whose import is subjectively <br/>
&gt;decided by a college professor.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;There have to be better ways to teach such things but she seems to care <br/>
&gt;only about the &#39;what&#39; and not the &#39;how.&#39; I think she makes some excellent <br/>
&gt;points, it&#39;s too bad she approaches it from the perspective of an <br/>
&gt;educator.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

The magazine doesn&#39;t put articles online for some reason, and they won&#39;t let<br/>

soon!<br/>
