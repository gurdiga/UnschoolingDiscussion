<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021563697">&quot;I&quot;ve told my kids, &quot;I love your friends, but my budget just won&#39;t <br/>
allow<br/>
for them to eat the stuff we have here&quot;. I just can&#39;&#39;t afford it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to tell neighbor kids to go home to eat before, but I try <br/>
to keep affordable snacks on hand. When they stop here after school <br/>
and start snooping through my fridge, I say NO. That&#39;s what home is <br/>
for. But if we have company, I assume we feed them while they&#39;re <br/>
here.<br/>
There&#39;s a difference between kids that stop here every day and those <br/>
we invite. The invited ones I expect to feed, the stopoffs I don&#39;t <br/>
feel responsible for...though I&#39;ll put out cheap snacks for them <br/>
sometimes too. Depends on our finances at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Chips, lemon/limeade, small oranges or apples, cereal, nuts or <br/>
chunks of cheese are the typical ok snacks. Lately our S&#39;mores maker <br/>
has been popular with the neighbor friends we have....they think <br/>
it&#39;s heaven to get sick on marshmallows. Marshmallows are cheap, I <br/>
just hope their parents don&#39;t catch on!:)<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a fairly cheap trade off...a few extra groceries for my <br/>
kids to have a fairly constant stream of friends through our house.<br/>
