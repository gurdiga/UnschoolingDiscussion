<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369500219">People often ask for fiction that includes homeschoolers/unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I just finished reading &quot;The Canning Season&quot;.  Two teens in a remote part of Maine with two elderly sisters who have lived in the same house their entire lives.  The local doctor suggests homeschooling the girls and when one of the women expresses that she couldn&#39;t do it the doctor says that lots of people homeschool and all you need is a computer with Internet access.<br/>
<br/>
Although &quot;unschooling&quot; is not mentioned, home&quot;school&quot;work is not mentioned either.  I don&#39;t want to give it away, but will say that both girls pursued their interests rather than follow a curriculum, and one of them ended up with a college degree and a career in her field of passion.<br/>
<br/>
I was enjoying the story well before homeschooling came into it.  It&#39;s a very sweet story, though does include a couple of very unpleasant mothers, which is why the teens were living with the elderly women.<br/>
