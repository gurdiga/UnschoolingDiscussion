<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694554656">Ok, you&#39;ve all got me thinking now.<br/>
I really don&#39;t think I can afford England with my trip planned to Alaska <br/>
already (in July) but I want to know more.<br/>
Is London the best place to fly into?<br/>
I heard someone saying the fares are better in May, but everything I&#39;ve found <br/>
so far is over $800 usd, is that good? yikes.<br/>
And what are the dates again?<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where you flying from?<br/>
Fares should be about $400 in May.<br/>
Virgin Atlantic flies to London, British Midlands flies to Manchester <br/>
but thats a 6 hour drive to hesfes then.<br/>
Birmingham is a possibility. I think BA may go there from here.<br/>
<br/>
I paid $412 for me and $203 for the kids when I flew DC to London <br/>
last May.<br/>
Flights from New York, Orlando and DC tend to be cheaper.<br/>
