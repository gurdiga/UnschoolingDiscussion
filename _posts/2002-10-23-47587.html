<div id="ygrps-yiv-227757174">&lt;&lt;The other day when I was having the flashes of light that signal an<br/>
oncoming migraine my son lovingly patted me on the hand and said,  &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
sorry mom... but the lights are better than the voices.&quot;  <br/>
He really thinks he&#39;s funny!<br/>

I&#39;m very fortunate, my migraines are triggered by sinus pressure.  When I<br/>
see the lights I take an antihistamine and can avert the pain most times.<br/>
 When the warning doesn&#39;t come first the antihistamines only &quot;dull&quot; the<br/>
pain.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard (never tried it) that putting a cold pack on your head and<br/>
neck with your feet in hot water helps by pulling the blood away from the<br/>
head helps a lot.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;voices&quot;, a few days ago I kept hearing a bell that no one else<br/>
seemed to hear.  My daughter got a LOT of mileage out of that one!  Until<br/>
she heard it too, then we discovered it was a window lock that had fallen<br/>
on the ground and the cats were tossing it around.<br/>
