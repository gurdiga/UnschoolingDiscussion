<div id="ygrps-yiv-550194561">There are no free eyeglasses. Not even at Target.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve stopped one moderated post that said to please pass on the  <br/>
information that Target was promoting their optical department and  <br/>
offering free glasses to children 12 and under for a limited time.<br/>
<br/>
So you may see that announcement on other lists. PLEASE don&#39;t pass it  <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
If you see a too-good-to-be-true offer, Google it before passing it  <br/>
on to someone else. Or check directly at Snopes. It only takes a  <br/>
minute to investigate. -- It&#39;s a good life skill to model for you  <br/>
kids! -- And saves hours of time for other people.<br/>
