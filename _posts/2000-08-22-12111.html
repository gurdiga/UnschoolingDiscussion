<div id="ygrps-yiv-626341566">Hi Carol and Linda et al,<br/>
My 14 DD is going to start a HP story-sharing list.  When she gets it up and<br/>
running, I will let you all know.  They (my DD&#39;s) got fairly excited when I<br/>
told them about it! And they are anxious to start it, so it won&#39;t be long<br/>
I&#39;m sure!<br/>

&gt; Hi-<br/>
&gt; My 13yog and 11 and 9yob would be very interested in a<br/>
&gt; Harry Potter story sharing group.  Thanks for sharing<br/>
&gt; the role playing group.<br/>
&gt; Let us know the details or if we can help start a<br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
