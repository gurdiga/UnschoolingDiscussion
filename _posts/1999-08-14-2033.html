<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806752571">Hi Michele<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t ignored your message - I&#39;ve been thinking about it a lot. And<br/>
still haven&#39;t come up with definitive answers &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    their choice of methods for parenting and homeshooling are one<br/>
&gt; thing - anyone&#39;s kids being allowed to become physically aggressive<br/>
&gt; with other kids and/or adults is another.  If two children at the<br/>
&gt; group ended up in a full blown knock down fight, would everyone just<br/>
&gt; stand around and watch if the parents were of the mindset that they<br/>
&gt; should be allowed to fight it out as a lesson?  what if one of the<br/>
&gt; kids drew a knife out of nowhere (or worse yet, the unspeakable!),<br/>
&gt; what then?   why should &quot;one hit on the head&quot;  done in an obviously<br/>
&gt; aggressive manner be any different?   being inclusive and respectful<br/>
&gt; of everyone&#39;s parenting or homeschooling methods should not mean that<br/>
&gt; anyone (or their kids) should have to endure physical attacks of<br/>
&gt; aggression - i&#39;m sorry....  spirited, gifted, ADD...  that is no<br/>
&gt; longer the issue here.  the issue is that this aggressive behavior is<br/>
&gt; not only being tolerated at someone else&#39;s expense, but by allowing<br/>
&gt; it, it is encouraging the fact that it&#39;s okay to treat others this<br/>
&gt; way and a means to get your own way!  this is not right IMO under any<br/>
&gt; circumstances!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t imagine anyone not trying to intervene if a kid drew a knife or a<br/>
gun. Yet there is a continuum of behaviours that lead to that point, and it<br/>
seems there is almost as great a continuum of parental attitudes. Line<br/>
drawing is very difficult. The mother of this particular child is a very<br/>
thoughtful person who believes very strongly that her children need to learn<br/>
to be assertive in their own right, that children should learn to live and<br/>
manage their own lives. She has seen for herself the problems that develop<br/>
when a child is totally managed / protected by its mother. She wants to see<br/>
the children sort out problems for themselves. She would have no problem in<br/>
me telling her son I don&#39;t like being hit on the head. Or my son telling<br/>
hers he doesn&#39;t want to be strangled. She just doesn&#39;t notice that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t listen, nor that he is much bigger and stronger than other kids his<br/>
age.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    it&#39;s nice that the group is inclusive of all parenting and<br/>
&gt; homeschooling styles but i think it does need a couple &quot;house rules&quot;<br/>
&gt; that everyone should have to abide by.  how each parent enforces<br/>
&gt; those rules with thier children is where the everyone else&#39;s respect<br/>
&gt; of the choice of that parent&#39;s style comes into play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But who makes the house rules?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   no, why should your family be impositioned or deprived of utilizing<br/>
&gt; the benefits of a group because some kids are being allowed to be<br/>
&gt; physical and hurt others?  I used to take Sterling to a playgroup at<br/>
&gt; the local gymnastics center.  it&#39;s intent was to give the kids safe<br/>
&gt; equipment and area to play in, to learn their social skills when<br/>
&gt; playing with other kids, and to give parents the environment to be<br/>
&gt; able to teach their kids these things.  the playgroup was for 2-6 yo.<br/>
&gt; the rules were simple - no running, no physical contact (hitting,<br/>
&gt; pushing, shoving),<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our group has kids from 0 - 17, and includes a range of acivities including<br/>
sports. That does make it difficult to make definitive rules that can be<br/>
understood by all ages &lt;sigh&gt;. And again, people&#39;s ideas about social skills<br/>
differ considerably.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; parents were to be with their kids at all times,<br/>
&gt; parents would ensure their kids were following the rules (no matter<br/>
&gt; what parenting style they chose to use to enforce them).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some parents don&#39;t believe a parent should &#39;enforce&#39; anything on children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;cut&gt; There was a monitor present at all times<br/>
&gt; and everyone knew that if a child continually broke the rules and the<br/>
&gt; parent was not doing anything about it, that the monitor could<br/>
&gt; intervene and they could also be asked to leave if the parent did not<br/>
&gt; want to participate in keeping the group enjoyable for everyone by<br/>
&gt; controlling their child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that is what I have decided is the crux of the matter. We are a group of<br/>
very independant people and we try to operate as a cooperative, and as a<br/>
consequence have no-one that every one agrees is &#39;in charge&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  With everyone knowing these expectations,<br/>
&gt; it was a fun place for the kids to go.  but kids will be kids and i<br/>
&gt; think every single child at some time or another lashed out<br/>
&gt; inappropriately.  however, it was dealt with immediately because of<br/>
&gt; the rules that were in place and everyone was able to get past it<br/>
&gt; quickly, put it behind, and enjoy the rest of the session.  in a<br/>
&gt; nutshell, learning to treat others the way you want to be treated and<br/>
&gt; making sure no one gets physically hurt and having fun, was the basis<br/>
&gt; of the group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps this is the philosophy that needs to be adopted by the group<br/>
&gt; and implementing any rules necessary for that philosophy to<br/>
&gt; materialize.  after all, isn&#39;t part of homeschooling teaching values<br/>
&gt; and respect for others?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Weeell - I have met people who are in it solely for academic reasons, and<br/>
for whom values seem to be remote! And those who tell their children they<br/>
can&#39;t associate with mine because we are evil atheists - I personally<br/>
wouldn&#39;t call that respect - at least we don&#39;t have to contend with that<br/>
group at our activities! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   i have a question about the group.  what is it&#39;s purpose?  is it a<br/>
&gt; meeting to discuss homeschooling issues?  is it a social setting for<br/>
&gt; kids to play?  is it a learning session for kids to get together and<br/>
&gt; help each other academically?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a social session, held in a church complex which has a gym where the<br/>
older kids can play basketball, dance etc., a small outside area with a<br/>
trampoline, a sandpit and water for the younger ones, plus rooms to paint,<br/>
play cards, board games....., and a place for homeschooling mothers to get<br/>
together and network. Sounds great, doesn&#39;t it? And it is, a lot of the<br/>
time, I realise as I&#39;m typing. And it seems very important to me to have a<br/>
place that is inclusive, so that people can come along freely, and perhaps<br/>
have their eyes opened to other ways of doing things.<br/>
But...... &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   no, i don&#39;t think you&#39;re a coward.  perhaps a little over-cautious<br/>
&gt; to not make waves<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh Michelle, if you knew how many people would die laughing to hear<br/>
&#39;over-cautious&#39; suggested of me! But perhaps you&#39;re right - after 13 years<br/>
of winning the homeschooling golden spoon award for stirring, maybe I&#39;ve<br/>
tired of making enemies &lt;g&gt;  (?? Do you use that expession &#39;stirring&#39;? As in<br/>
stirring up trouble??)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; for the group or appear to go against the<br/>
&gt; principles of the group?  perhaps the principles of the group need to<br/>
&gt; be better defined.  how long has this group existed?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just this year, although it arose out of a previous group that had been<br/>
going about 8 years, and only stopped because the venue was no longer<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe I&#39;m getting too old and weary to be tolerant. Maybe I&#39;ve<br/>
passed the age of inclusiveness, democracy and cooperation and I just need<br/>
to start another group where I can be dictator and make the rules on a take<br/>
it or leave it basis?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, anyway, Michelle, for pushing me into thinking more clearly about<br/>
what is bothering me.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Michele<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t ignored your message - I&#39;ve been thinking about it a lot.<br/>
&gt; And still haven&#39;t come up with definitive answers &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  oh no, i figured you were as busy as i&#39;ve been this week.  &lt;G&gt;  and <br/>
i&#39;m still trying to get used to the volume of posts that come through <br/>
this list.   so i didn&#39;t think anything of it!<br/>
<br/>
 The mother of this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; particular child is a very thoughtful person who believes very<br/>
&gt; strongly that her children need to learn to be assertive in their<br/>
&gt; own right, that children should learn to live and manage their own<br/>
&gt; lives.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i agree that children should learn to live and manage their own <br/>
lives too.  i am raising Sterling to be as independent and <br/>
self-sufficient as he possibly can be and to learn to solve his own <br/>
problems.  However, let&#39;s think about this for a moment.  in fact, <br/>
let&#39;s take out the homeschooling variable for a minute to simplify <br/>
this even more.  Regardless of how much you would like to let <br/>
children figure out things on their own, they still guidance from <br/>
somewhere as the basis for figuring out those things on their own.  <br/>
the have not lived long enough to have experienced enough of the world <br/>
around them to always enough information yet to make sound decisions. <br/>
that&#39;s not to say that we should give them the answers or enforce <br/>
control over their every move... no, that would be managing thier <br/>
lives for them while they learn nothing by always being told what to <br/>
do and when.  <br/>
<br/>
 She has seen for herself the problems that develop when a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child is totally managed / protected by its mother. She wants to see<br/>
&gt; the children sort out problems for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  right...  &quot;totally managed/protected&quot;.  i think we are talking <br/>
extremes here - all or nothing.  don&#39;t you think there should be some <br/>
happy medium somewhere in between?  we provide &quot;guidance&quot; to an <br/>
infant in learning lots of new skills.  Before we know they are <br/>
capable, we do certain things for them - feed them, change their <br/>
diapers, etc.  We hope that they will learn to feed themselves.  Do <br/>
we withhold food so that they will learn how to feed themselves when <br/>
they are starving enough?  NO!  We provide the guidance initially <br/>
while gradually shifting the responsibility over to them for figuring <br/>
it out themselves once we know they are armed with the information <br/>
needed to figure it out on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
  if a child goes to grab a sharp knife, do we let them do it and cut <br/>
their finger off for the sake of &quot;letting them figure things out on <br/>
their own&quot;? not hardly.  <br/>
<br/>
  Stepping in and providing guidance at critical milestones of <br/>
growing up does not take away thier opportunity to figure things out <br/>
on their own and make their own decisions, it enhances it!    <br/>
<br/>
 She would have no<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; problem in me telling her son I don&#39;t like being hit on the head. Or<br/>
&gt; my son telling hers he doesn&#39;t want to be strangled. She just<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t notice that he doesn&#39;t listen, nor that he is much bigger<br/>
&gt; and stronger than other kids his age.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But who makes the house rules?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  well, after reading down through the rest of your message and <br/>
learning more about the group, then i would say everyone collectively <br/>
should make the house rules.  and i hate to use the word rules but <br/>
actually that&#39;s real life!  everywhere you go, there are rules and <br/>
even unschooled children need to learn that - whether they figure it <br/>
out themselves or not, what better place to practice?  If they are <br/>
served some rules in the group it gives them a chance to figure it <br/>
out for themselves in a more neutral environment before going out in <br/>
the real world to be crudely awakened on unfamiliar ground.  let&#39;s <br/>
face it, there are rules everywhere we go!  and breaking some of <br/>
those rules can have some pretty serious consequences!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our group has kids from 0 - 17, and includes a range of acivities<br/>
&gt; including sports. That does make it difficult to make definitive<br/>
&gt; rules that can be understood by all ages &lt;sigh&gt;. And again, people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; ideas about social skills differ considerably.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>   well, i&#39;m not suggesting that there has to be a lot of complicated <br/>
ridiculous rules.  i think it would undermind the purpose of the <br/>
group!  and too many rules... well then you might as well send them <br/>
to school where they even have to go pee by the rules.  (sorry so <br/>
crude but hey.)  just some basic rules that encourage respect for <br/>
others - no hitting or shoving.  are there not at least some rules <br/>
already like &quot;no fighting&quot;?  maybe that is too general for a younger <br/>
child to grasp.  and some forms of hitting are not done within the <br/>
scope of fighting, but in other aggressive means like to get <br/>
someone&#39;s attention.  a younger child understands no hitting.  if you <br/>
can&#39;t hit, you can&#39;t fight but also if you can&#39;t hit, you can&#39;t <br/>
physically disrespect someone.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some parents don&#39;t believe a parent should &#39;enforce&#39; anything on<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Enforce might be a strong word.  maybe direct or guide would be <br/>
more appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And that is what I have decided is the crux of the matter. We are a<br/>
&gt; group of very independant people and we try to operate as a<br/>
&gt; cooperative, and as a consequence have no-one that every one agrees<br/>
&gt; is &#39;in charge&#39;.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  i can understand this philosophy too... and i think it&#39;s great if it<br/>
works out.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is a social session, held in a church complex which has a gym<br/>
&gt; where the older kids can play basketball, dance etc., a small<br/>
&gt; outside area with a trampoline, a sandpit and water for the younger<br/>
&gt; ones, plus rooms to paint, play cards, board games....., and a place<br/>
&gt; for homeschooling mothers to get together and network. Sounds great,<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t it? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  yes!  and as i was reading i found myself wishing there was <br/>
something like that here! <br/>
<br/>
And it is, a lot of the time, I realise as I&#39;m typing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And it seems very important to me to have a place that is inclusive,<br/>
&gt; so that people can come along freely, and perhaps have their eyes<br/>
&gt; opened to other ways of doing things. But...... &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  but then if you have to ask yourself whether you would feel <br/>
comfortable bringing someone, then i guess it doesn&#39;t fit the bill of <br/>
inclusive anymore, does it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh Michelle, if you knew how many people would die laughing to hear<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  happy to be of service and add some giggles to your day!  &lt;G&gt;  i <br/>
haven&#39;t heard the expression &quot;stirring up&quot; in your context in a long <br/>
time.  my mom used to use it all the time though!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  h-m-m-m-m-m.  no comment!  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
