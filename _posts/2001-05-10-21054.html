<div id="ygrps-yiv-910763852"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: Nanci Kuykendall &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aisliin@...">aisliin@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; I guess I should post on this thread, since I<br/>
&gt; inadvertantly started it with my thread on dubious<br/>
&gt; &quot;expert advice&quot;.  Many of you know that I have an<br/>
&gt; eldest son with many challenges that make him a daily<br/>
&gt; struggle to raise.  I am not certain from whence all<br/>
&gt; his problems stem, but we know that he has agression<br/>
&gt; and anger management issues, patience and attention<br/>
&gt; span limitations, self control problems and explosive<br/>
&gt; emotions, multiple severe allergies, asthma, eczema,<br/>
&gt; and other issues.  He is a bright child, and a joy<br/>
&gt; sometimes, with a hyperactive imagination and a<br/>
&gt; charming sense of humor.  Most folks tell us that we<br/>
&gt; are models of patience (which I often feel the<br/>
&gt; opposite of) and that we are wonderful parents doing<br/>
&gt; our best with a difficult child (when I often feel<br/>
&gt; like the worst kind of miserable failure with him).<br/>
&gt; My son right now is four and a half years old and we<br/>
&gt; are struggling daily with the issue of potty training.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My heart goes out to you Nanci as we have been down some of the same path<br/>
with our own son (who is also 4 1/2). One thing I can tell you is that when<br/>
we finally got the food allergy issues straightened out, so much else<br/>
magically fell into line too that we were amazed. He instantly potty<br/>
trained, I could brush his teeth or his hair without a major battle, he<br/>
would go into a swimming pool willingly, go down slides and on swings, was<br/>
able to wear different kinds of clothes (he has been extremely sensitive to<br/>
textures, sounds, tastes, smells his whole life) so many things he had never<br/>
done before! In his case, most of his issues were centered around the whole<br/>
sensory integration issue, and the resulting motor coordination problems.<br/>
Once those became straightened out, he had so much incredibly less<br/>
frustrations in his daily life, and overstimulation, that everything else<br/>
just seemed to even out too.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read them already, I found the following books to be<br/>
exceedingly helpful and important in our road to healing:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Out-of-sync Child&quot; (don&#39;t forget the hyphens if you&#39;re doing a search<br/>
for this book) - about sensory integration<br/>
&quot;Is This Your Child&quot; - about how food allergies affect everything in a<br/>
person&#39;s life<br/>
&quot;Say Goodbye to Illness&quot; and &quot;Say Goodbye to Allergy-related Autism&quot; - about<br/>
NAET practices (which has been our saving grace), written by Dr. Nambudripad<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, on the potty training, I know how difficult it is to have a child<br/>
who is 4 and not able to control their bowels/bladder. So many people think<br/>
they need to give well-meaning advice on this issue when they see a 4 year<br/>
old in diapers. And it begins to be emotionally telling on the child as<br/>
well, once he realizes that this is &quot;different&quot;. If your child has no<br/>
control, daily battles are not going to change that, and only result in<br/>
heartbreak. For us, the potty issue was directly linked to the allergies, so<br/>
if you can find a way to alleviate the allergies, it might just magically<br/>
resolve itself. For us, that meant eliminating almost every food source on<br/>
earth it seemed, until we could get things under control. Then we started<br/>
the NAET treatments and have been able to add the foods back, a bit at a<br/>
time, with no adverse effects. That&#39;s just my experience, in case it helps!<br/>
Best of luck to you!!!!<br/>

&gt; with a child with no fear of danger, as I had one too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sympathize as this is my daughter to a &quot;T&quot;, at 18 months I found her<br/>
swinging from a chandelier in the dining room. It was also me as a child, so<br/>
I feel really sorry for my parents! They were always taking me to the<br/>
emergency room, and these days probably would&#39;ve received a visit or two<br/>
from CPS. I&#39;ve broken 13 bones and gotten over 300 stitches in my life. And<br/>
now that I&#39;m a &quot;responsible&quot; adult, my passions are things like skydiving,<br/>
LOL. I guess sometimes we don&#39;t totally grow out of it :-). I also have to<br/>
run my body *hard* every day or I have too much energy and I literally<br/>
jitter to pieces and can&#39;t sleep. So I understand to a certain extent what<br/>
these kids need and crave - it was me as a child and it still is today. I<br/>
also understand that when people say &quot;kids will learn their limits&quot; that<br/>
this isn&#39;t always strictly true. Some people have a hard time feeling their<br/>
limits and this can be both a good and a bad thing. Being in the world of<br/>
skydiving, I&#39;ve come into contact with quite a few of these people :-).<br/>

&gt; cart or his stroller (and believe me, we had plenty of<br/>
&gt; battles over it) we didn&#39;t go.  I spent a lot of time<br/>
&gt; at home his first three years<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, this sounds familiar. There was quite a time period where<br/>
grocery shopping was just impossible for us. My son was *not* into being<br/>
restrained. I don&#39;t think he has ever ridden in a grocery cart, LOL! I used<br/>
to see other kids riding in the fronts of the carts and wonder how the heck<br/>
their parents got them to do that. My DH got good at shopping at nighttime<br/>
with my illegible lists :-)<br/>
