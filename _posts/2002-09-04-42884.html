&gt; Great counselling! :o) And when you start saying yes, you realize how<br/>

it. :-)<br/>

The Joy of Yes motto - Have you said YES to your child today?  or  Just Say<br/>
YES!<br/>

Thanks for reminding me about saying YES more often - sometimes I get stuck<br/>
in that NO mentality.<br/>

On another list (not just an unschooling list) people are talking about <br/>
chores and making kids do things.  One in particular kind of made me sickly <br/>
sad, and it &quot;However (like everyone else I assume), the<br/>
nastiness and fighting do happen WAY too often for my sanity...&quot; and later <br/>
goes on about a point system, with minus points and earning rights (like <br/>
Gameboy playing time) and...  &quot;So far they&#39;ve accumulated quite a few points <br/>
but we had a doozy of a fight this morning that no amount of points could <br/>
address! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was really REALLY tempted to write and say we don&#39;t have doozies of fights <br/>
here and we don&#39;t have any nastiness at all.   <br/>
<br/>
But you know what?   Often people don&#39;t believe it.<br/>
And if they DO believe it, they get pissed off.<br/>
Or they say I bought that happiness at the expense of not teaching my kids to <br/>
take care of themselves when they&#39;re grown.<br/>
<br/>
Thing is, my kids take really good care of the things they&#39;ve chosen to prize <br/>
and care about.  Every one of them has things from when they were babies, or <br/>
toddlers, and some of those things are paper, or otherwise fragile.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night I walked to the video store to get Marty&#39;s list of movies (I got <br/>
four of five) because he&#39;s had a cold and needed to just stay home today.   <br/>
He watched two last night.  He was sitting watching one this afternoon, after <br/>
eating chicken soup with me and Holly, when Keith came home and wanted Marty <br/>
to go with him to deliver the big TV to the repair shop.  So Marty had to <br/>
change shirts, put on pants and shoes, and go outside, which he hadn&#39;t <br/>
planned to do.  But he didn&#39;t whine one bit.  When he gets home he&#39;ll watch <br/>
that movie some more and we&#39;ll all be calm and appreciative of each other.<br/>
