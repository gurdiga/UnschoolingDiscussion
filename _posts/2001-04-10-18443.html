offers a similar thing for a small fee (4 bucks or so) a month that works great 
for us.&nbsp; we use bellsouth and its called Internet Call Waiting . to get a 
look at it you can go to <a rel="nofollow"

    shift<br><br></font></div>&lt;&lt;How about a little more info on &quot;call 
    wave&quot;? I struggle with being<br>online because my husband works on the 
    road and I never know when he is<br>going to call.&gt;&gt;<br><br>Oh 
    sure!&nbsp; I&#39;m fairly certain their web site is <a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.callwave.com">http://www.callwave.com</a>. <br>The software 
    is free and it&#39;s very small little window that sits on top<br>of all other 
    windows.&nbsp; It runs little ads but they aren&#39;t too intrusive.<br><br>You 
    have to have your phone set up with &quot;line busy forwarding&quot; 
    which<br>means that if the call encounters a busy signal it is forwarded to 
    their<br>800 number.&nbsp; They get a message that you are using Call Wave 
    and to leave<br>a message. (the main drawback is that they only get 30 
    seconds). <br><br>On your computer you hear a single ring and once they&#39;ve 
    recorded the<br>message they play it for you on your computer.&nbsp; If it&#39;s 
    important I go<br>offline and call them back.&nbsp; The only problem I&#39;ve 
    experienced is that,<br>because I have call waiting, the computer doesn&#39;t 
    seem to always call out<br>on the right line and that means everyone gets 
    the busy signal.&nbsp; If I<br>reboot the computer it picks up the right 
    line and I have no idea why<br>this happens.<br><br>There is another service 
    which you can pay for and it has some really<br>nice features.&nbsp; It 
    includes caller ID and you can click on one of several<br>options like 
    &quot;I will call back later&quot; or &quot;Call me back in 5 minutes&quot; 
    and<br>they will give the caller your message.&nbsp; I think the name of 
    that one is<br>Pagoo, <a rel="nofollow"

    the web site is different than the one I gave I will post<br>again.&nbsp; 
    I&#39;m writing this on Juno and can&#39;t check the site right
