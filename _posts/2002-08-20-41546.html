<br/>
Well of course they&#39;ve been documented.  Cannibalism in humans has been<br/>
documented....but is it the norm?<br/>
<br/>
I keep bringing this back to other types of show animals because that&#39;s what<br/>
I know.  A couple of years ago in Dallas a 4-H kid found out that his pig<br/>
was not going to make the weight limit....so he stuck a hose down the pig&#39;s<br/>
throat and turned on the water....until the pig died....in front of several<br/>
witnesses...who did nothing to stop him.<br/>
<br/>
To me, that is horrifying.  It is well documented that it occurred, even<br/>
made the paper, but it is not the norm.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  These are accounts that have been written by elephant trainers:<br/>
<br/>
Trainers Grim Details of Discipline<br/>
In addition to bullhooks, trainers use baseball bats, ax handles, <br/>
pitchforks, and electric shock. Chains, ropes, and block-and-tackle are <br/>
used as restraints.<br/>
<br/>
Alan Roocroft, an elephant consultant to circuses and zoos, cowrote in his <br/>
book Managing Elephants:<br/>
<br/>
[W]hen corporal punishment is administered to an elephant, it has to be <br/>
fairly forceful in order that it is perceived by the elephant to be <br/>
punishment at all.  [T]he trainer must now intimidate the animal in order <br/>
to acquire a dominant position.  [R]estraining a potentially hostile <br/>
elephant needs at least a crew of eight, preferably 10, in order to insure <br/>
sufficient muscle is available. Once immobilized, the elephant may be the <br/>
object of punishment in the form of blows with a wooden rod.<br/>
<br/>
In I Loved Rogues, elephant trainers George &quot;Slim&quot; Lewis and Byron Fish wrote:<br/>
<br/>
Circus animals are performers, and training them depends on a certain <br/>
amount of rough treatment.<br/>
<br/>
What is true of training for performance is even more true of the basic <br/>
discipline that must be established before an elephant can work or act. It <br/>
isn&#39;t kept in a cage, and, while it is chained much of the time, there are <br/>
many occasions when it walks at liberty with only the respect it pays its <br/>
handler to keep it in check. It is absolutely essential, therefore, that <br/>
the animal must have this respect for its handler; and to get down to blunt <br/>
facts, this quality begins with fear: fear of punishment and discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
A good stout stick should be used, and it should have a sharp prod on the <br/>
end of it to keep the elephant from turning its head.<br/>
<br/>
[Teaching an elephant to lie down is] done by gradually tightening the <br/>
chain, a few inches at a time, until the elephant is supporting its weight <br/>
entirely on the front and hind legs that are free. It is very tiring for a <br/>
bull to hold up its mass in this manner. When the handler sees it <br/>
weakening, he gives the command, Down! Come on down.<br/>
The command is repeated until the elephant obeys. Just before it gives in, <br/>
it will show signs of fear and defeat. Its eyes will bulge and its bowels <br/>
become loose and watery as they are emptied several times.<br/>
When the elephant finally surrenders and falls over on its side, it knows <br/>
it is comparatively helpless and that it has lost a psychological battle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie, what you are talking about here is horrific, yes!  But I am not <br/>
talking about other kinds of animal shows.  I am not attempting to indict <br/>
everyone involved in every type of animal showing.  I don&#39;t know enough <br/>
about it for one thing, and I appreciate your shedding light on the <br/>
subject.  But, about circuses, rodeos, and roadside &quot;zoos&quot; I do know a <br/>
thing or two about, and the norm in these venues is cruelty and <br/>
exploitation for greed and profit.  I can say that there is no such thing <br/>
as a humane circus act or a humane rodeo.  Whenever you see exotic, wild <br/>
animals performing in unnatural ways, fear and intimidation are essential <br/>
parts of the trainer&#39;s bag to tricks to get them to do this.  Where exotic <br/>
animals are concerned, not only are the animals subjected to cruel <br/>
treatment, but people are exposed to dangerous situations.  In these <br/>
situations, the animals never win.  I cannot imagine the justification for <br/>
plucking a wild animal out of its natural setting to be subjected to a <br/>
lifetime of horrors.  To suggest otherwise is pure denial.  No insight can <br/>
be gained, no conservation efforts realized.  Furthermore, when animal <br/>
circuses and rodeos are held out as &quot;educational&quot; opportunities for <br/>
children and the public, nothing other than the acceptance of cruelty is <br/>
taught.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, the animal circus industry is not doing all that well these <br/>
days.  Attendance has been declining at circuses that use animal acts and <br/>
animal-free circuses have been steadily gaining in popularity.  In April <br/>
2001, Time Magazine said, &quot;Mixing hokum with the perception of brutality, <br/>
the traditional circus seems uncomfortably out of place in todays <br/>
entertainment market.&quot;<br/>
