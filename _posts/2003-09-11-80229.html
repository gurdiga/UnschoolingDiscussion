<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985019092">This isn&#39;t very exciting or pressing at all, but here it was on my computer, <br/>
saved for me to see because Holly wants me to arrange a get-together for her.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know the girl or her mom, but they&#39;re next-door neighbors to a <br/>
homeschooling family Holly met this summer, and they live within walking distance.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s 11 and hasn&#39;t been to school or had any spelling or &quot;writing&quot; <br/>
lessons, other than having her questions answered and practicing.  <br/>
<br/>
The other girl is about Holly&#39;s age too, and went to school.   Some of the <br/>
spellings (you&#39;ll probably see which) are purposely particular to Instant <br/>
Messages, but some (like &quot;sood&quot; for &quot;should&quot;) are just things Holly can&#39;t spell.  <br/>
The other girl&#39;s writing isn&#39;t much better, and she goes to school.<br/>
<br/>
On one hand it&#39;s not fair (whatever &quot;fair&quot; is &lt;g&gt;) to judge writing by this <br/>
extremely informal kind of communication, but on the other hand, compared to <br/>
carefully edited practice writing for school assignments which isn&#39;t &quot;real&quot; <br/>
writing, this stuff was real, for a reason, and will have a real-world affect, <br/>
which I think is very cool.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly:   cant stay on long what<br/>
Other girl:  wut  <br/>
Holly:   i wonna see you agaen<br/>
Other girl:  me 2  <br/>
Holly:   are you like always at kaills?<br/>
Other girl:  not nemore  <br/>
Holly:   school<br/>
Holly:   ?<br/>
Other girl:  yea and too much homework  <br/>
Holly:   we sood get r moms to talk and get together that way<br/>
Other girl:  yea  <br/>
Holly:   oh sorry  i gotta go now marty want on <br/>
Other girl:  ok  <br/>
Other girl:  laterzz  <br/>
Holly:   ta ta<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking for awhile that Dylan can&#39;t spell.   His dad&#39;s not a<br/>
great speller and I&#39;m, well, you all know. &lt;g&gt;  We&#39;ve gotten along fairly<br/>
well in the world and I&#39;m not worried about whatever ability Dylan will<br/>
have. <br/>
He sends e-mail to his cousin, but there he uses spell check and she<br/>
seems to be able to read what he&#39;s writing. <br/>
<br/>
My friend Amy has been coming over in the mornings after she drops her<br/>
kids at school.  She likes my coffee and sunny bird watching windows.  <br/>
We play Flinch or Racko or Set while we talk.  We were playing Quiddler<br/>
this time and Dylan wanted to play.  He&#39;s played before and his dad and I<br/>
always accepted his creative spellings as if they were right.   We<br/>
haven&#39;t played in months, probably, but here he came and asked to play.  <br/>
We were at the five card hand already so he just jumped in where we were.<br/>
  His word that round was &quot;grasp.&quot;   Next round &quot;ravens&quot;.  Next,<br/>
&quot;whistle&quot;, and the next word was &quot;skeletal&quot;.   He stopped playing then<br/>
because he had a phone call.  His spelling was perfect.    <br/>
<br/>
I was so damn impressed.   I told him so and he said, &quot;don&#39;t be too<br/>
impressed mom, your bird book was open and I just found words on that<br/>
page the right length and spelled those. &lt;G&gt;  So, I still don&#39;t know what<br/>
he could spell without a handy book or the spell check, but I&#39;m even more<br/>
impressed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed this kind of spelling when my 17 and 12 are online. They <br/>
tell me they purposely spell phonically or kinda silly when in a <br/>
conversation. It&#39;s a kewl, freestyle thing and a small revolt against <br/>
spelling. Sara</div>

Oh my gosh!!  Yeah, that&#39;s cool, but the odds of there being words on that <br/>
very page that he happened to have letters for in his hand is WONDERFULLY cool!!<br/>

<br/>
We haven&#39;t done it on Quiddler, but with Five Crowns if someone wants to <br/>
join, we &quot;average them in&quot; by giving them a starting score of the average of the <br/>
others&#39; scores to that point.  It&#39;s been the most practical use of averages I <br/>
can think of in our daily lives. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I particularly liked the other girl&#39;s &quot;not nemore&quot; which I assume is <br/>
&quot;not anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked Holly about &quot;yaa&quot; which she used for &quot;yeah.&quot;  She said she knows the <br/>
other spelling, but it&#39;s a way to show it with a certain inflection (didn&#39;t <br/>
use the word &quot;inflection,&quot; but pronounced it the way it&#39;s intended to be if they <br/>
wrote &quot;yaa&quot;).<br/>

cool!!***<br/>
<br/>
That he scanned or read until he found a word with at least some of the<br/>
letters he was holding, and made sure it was the length it needed to be,<br/>
and kept track of the letters he still needed to collect, and used the<br/>
book in the first place really delighted me. <br/>
<br/>
He delights me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I just ordered Five Crowns after reading about it here.  It hasn&#39;t<br/>
arrived yet, but we&#39;ve been playing Racko, which I found at the<br/>
secondhand store for forty nine cents.   It&#39;s old, 1962? I think, but in<br/>
perfect shape, so if we get bored with it quickly I won&#39;t feel bad about<br/>
passing it along. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and daughter (10) play Everquest together sometimes. He <br/>
sometimes gets frustrated (not REALLY frustrated, but frustrated in a <br/>
way he can laugh about) that she sometimes tells him he&#39;s pronouncing <br/>
or spelling a word incorrectly.  He&#39;s never been a great speller or <br/>
reader.  She still spells like a 10 year old, but is an excellent <br/>
reader.  <br/>
<br/>
They BOTH pronounce &quot;erudite&quot; incorrectly, which is a word that comes <br/>
up when they play that game a lot.  It grates on my nerves like nails <br/>
on a chalkboard.  They tell me to be quiet when I correct them <br/>
because they like to say it that way.  I think they just do it to bug <br/>
me. ;)<br/>
