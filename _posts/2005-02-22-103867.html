<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819482041">It&#39;s a magazine for muslim girls, but I read the 2nd issue today and was <br/>
highly impressed, and feel it would be great for all girls!  The girl <br/>
who started the magazine is a friend, and a wonderful young lady.  The <br/>
cost for the magazine is $20 a year.  Her website is www.mgmagazine.net. <br/>
