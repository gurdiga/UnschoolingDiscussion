&gt; &gt; Interesting statement Bob - let me think about it, okay?...Especially the <br/>
&gt; &gt; last part - un-American - I&#39;m not American anyway! lol! ..Leionie<br/>

&gt; This wasn&#39;t addressed to you as if I disagreed with what you were saying, <br/>
&gt; nor <br/>
&gt; was anything in that reply posted with you in mind. I appreciated what you <br/>
&gt; were getting at. Also, by &quot;support and encouraging the victim,&quot; I meant <br/>
&gt; monetarily -- buying their products. I meant nothing about not giving moral <br/>
&gt; support and encouragement to victims, as well we should.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Bob, <br/>
This is addressed to you. This is the second time you have replied to a <br/>
poster on this list by stating that one of your posts wasn&#39;t addressed to <br/>
them. When you post on the list your post is assumed to be addressing <br/>
EVERYONE on the list. And if you include someone&#39;s name (like you did <br/>
Sandra&#39;s) in a post then it is doubly assumed that not only is the post for <br/>
everyone, it is for the person mentioned as well. Regardless, if you post, <br/>
anyone, including Leoine, is allowed to reply. If you want your post to be <br/>
only &quot;for&quot; certain people, or you only want certain people to reply to you <br/>
don&#39;t send it to the list, send it privately. <br/>

&lt;&lt; If you want your post to be <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t want anything private.  The tone of the other seemed harrassing, and <br/>
if I start gettng harrassing e-mail in private because of having posted on <br/>
this list, that&#39;s not right or good.<br/>
<br/>
But I too would like to note that it&#39;s a big list and we&#39;re writing to the <br/>
list, yet often comments ARE in direct response to others.  Denying it <br/>
doesn&#39;t change it.<br/>
