&lt;&lt; Yeah right, two of mine already had theirs on the 2nd and 4th. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Yeah, same here. Jalen&#39;s is coming up on Feb. 2nd, his 2nd Birthday. I&#39;ll <br/>
just have lots of pictures and tell him &quot;that was your Golden Birthday&quot; when <br/>
he&#39;s older....actually I like the &quot;star Birthday&quot; better.<br/>
Trevor was a wee little 1 y.o., so no memories there....but Jared and Sierra <br/>
will both be 29 for theirs, cool!!<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
