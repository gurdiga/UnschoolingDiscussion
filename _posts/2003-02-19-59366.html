<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715587279"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Casey has always liked to write, so she&#39;s been handwriting her stories for<br/>
&gt; years. Some of them we staple up into books. Those first ones are just<br/>
&gt; precious to look at. It was from when she first understood inventive<br/>
&gt; spelling-and inventive they were!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I felt like we were losing all those pieces of paper she was writing<br/>
&gt; on, I started typing them up for her after she wrote them. She said she<br/>
&gt; wanted book spelling, so I also edited for her as I went along. We now<br/>
 </span></blockquote>have<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; two notebooks full of her writing. One is called My Big Book Of Little<br/>
&gt; Stories and the other is a book of poetry. Priceless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Michelle (7) invented a character called &quot;The Sea Cat&quot; (fierce cat-like<br/>
animal with 3 snakes for a tail) which she has played for about 6 months or<br/>
so with a friend who invented her own &quot;Creature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She decided just before Christmas to write a book about the Sea Cat.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t physically write and is just learning to read, but that doesn&#39;t stop<br/>
her from dictating the text to me and making a book!  I hand-printed it, she<br/>
colored the cover and we bound it with wool.  She determined it was the 5th<br/>
book in the series and came up with titles to list on the back, like those<br/>
she had seen on other books we&#39;ve read.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle has dreams of an entire marketing package, with Sea Cat coloring<br/>
books, Sea Cat craft books and Sea Cat research guides, along with the<br/>
actual stories, to be distributed at Chapters (our Barnes & Noble) and other<br/>
bookstores throughout North America.  I&#39;m guessing I need to step up my<br/>
production methods to keep up!<br/>

First you have to excavate your back yard about 60 feet down, and then you  <br/>
have to wait for the cat to die.  Unless you find some previously-deceased <br/>
cats about three feet down on your way to dinosaurs...<br/>

&gt;&gt;of?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Casey&#39;s museum was called The Museum Of Life Learning. She had permanent <br/>
exhibits of rocks and gems, sea life, forest life, Indian artifacts, and <br/>
coins from around the world. She also had an art gallery. Then there was a <br/>
table for visiting or temporary exhibits. She had some of her brother&#39;s <br/>
stuff set up for the visiting exhibit. And she did something about the <br/>
Aztecs for a new, temporary one. Everything was laid out and labelled. She <br/>
also had some books around with more info. It was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
The museum was recently taken down to make way for her new project. She <br/>
wants to start a real lending library now. We&#39;re shopping around for cheap <br/>
bookshelves for her to get started.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Go for it! Tell her she could set up shelves in her bedroom for displays if <br/>
the living room isn&#39;t feasible. It was basically taking all the cool stuff <br/>
we had collected over the years and sorting, classifying and labelling it.<br/>

One time Casey wanted to raise money for a charity. We found giant candy <br/>
bars on sale 10/$1.00. She went around the neighborhood and sold them for <br/>
$1.00 a piece. She ended up making over $50 for a local Hospice.<br/>

I had a friend in high school who got a second locker and sold bubble gum and <br/>
candy bars. He&#39;d just buy them by the case (box of 36; not big case) or the <br/>
&quot;tub&quot; (for gum) and sell them the same retail price as the store.  He made <br/>
enough to have his own candy free, and for some records and guitar strings <br/>
sometimes.  But for him, he liked the interaction with others, meeting new <br/>
kids, and the happiness of the moment of &quot;WOW!&quot; when someone could get <br/>
something at school instead of waiting hours.  Community service, in a way.<br/>

This is funny. just the other day, we were all talking about how we were in <br/>
school. Tara&#39;s boyfriend Dru was telling us about when he was in middle <br/>
school. He would sneak away to the grocery store and buy candy and then <br/>
bring it all back to school and sell it for like a nickel more. It got to <br/>
the point where even the teachers were buying it. One teacher finally <br/>
approached Dru&#39;s mom about the business he had on the side. Dru&#39;s mom almost <br/>
had a heart attack as the first thing that came to her mind was drugs! <br/>
That&#39;s when the teacher told her that her son had quite a lucrative candy <br/>
business on the side!!<br/>
