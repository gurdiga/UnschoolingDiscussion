hi,
<p>they aren&#39;t really sure what the problem is.&nbsp;&nbsp; i was diagnosed
with still&#39;s disease, an autoimmune disease which is kind of a cross between
rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, though i tested neg. for everything, my
blood work was really wacky.&nbsp; i&#39;ve seen 30 (+ or -) drs and they all
told me to go home because they don&#39;t know what to do with me.&nbsp; they
said only come back if i need to be hospitalized.&nbsp; i guess i have
symptom similar to cf but i&#39;ve had symptoms of hepatitis - one of the first
diagnosis but tested neg.&nbsp;&nbsp; all i know was after having rene&#39;
it took me a long time to get my energy back even though he was a really
easy baby.&nbsp; we were just planning on trying for a second kid (rene&#39;
was 20 mo) when one day i was feeling particularly great,&nbsp; i sat do
to eat and couldn&#39;t get up.&nbsp;&nbsp; i had to crawl to the phone and
call my dh to come home (he didn&#39;t return to work for over a month and
then it was just part time).&nbsp; i&#39;ve never gotten my health back.&nbsp;
i lost 20 lbs in three wks nearly all the muscles in my shoulders were
destroyed, i&#39;m still not able to write (typing is easier) for very long.&nbsp;
i&#39;m constantly <u>exhausted</u>.&nbsp; i&#39;m seeing an acupuncturist and
she said my kidney qi is exhausted and that&#39;s why i miscarried i simply
didn&#39;t have the energy to hold the pregnancy.&nbsp; anyway i would be interested
in the article since my diagnosis is very iffy.&nbsp; i appreciate you
thinking of me.

I had posted to someone on the list about my sister who has Cfids, so maybe <br/>
that was me you saw, I would be interested in the article to pass it on to <br/>
her if you don&#39;t mind.    : )<br/>

     It has been a few weeks since my last post, but I have Chronic Fatigue <br/>
Syndrome and Fibromyalgia.  I am not sure if you are thinking about me or <br/>
not, since I do remember discussing this with a few people on this loop.  <br/>
Perhaps Susan also has this, I don&#39;t remember what she said her illness was.  <br/>
I would be very interested in reading the article though, if you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
mind sending it to me.  My e-mail address is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:FreeSchool@...">FreeSchool@...</a><br/>
Thanks,<br/>
