Back to TV. I am not concerned that my five year old will find some sex or violence to watch on the TV, but I am concerned that if he watches something during adult broadcasting time - let&#39;s say the news - he might be exposed to sex or violence during advertisements or trailers of other kinds.<br/>

  open, consistently choose age-inappropriate television.<br/>
Mmm... that I believe, but that would not allow unrestricted television viewing to my 5 yo, since the age-appropriate programmes are limited in hours.<br/>
<br/>
The other question is, are you not concerned with limitless hours of TV viewing for a child. Again I find it hard to ignore the research on hours spent watching TV. I accept that you don&#39;t pay much notice to the research, but it does make me nervous. In all honesty I can see the effects on children around me. Obesity seems to be an increasing problem and most primary schools here have a perceptual development program - where kids learn to jump and hop and climb. Things that they should have been doing in their first five years at least (and off course beyond).<br/>
<br/>
I am a flexible person, and I change my reality constantly. Even though these are my views on TV right now, they might change in the near future. That is why I like to read different opinions. Thanks for sharing yours.<br/>

sure how to answer questions or hold debates without making <br/>
some judgments or sharing the judgments I&#39;ve made in my life <br/>
(not being sarcastic, just not sure what you would &quot;like&quot; people to <br/>
sound like when disagreeing with you).<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Brit (who to be fair is almost 8, but this sort of thing happened <br/>
regularly when she was much younger, too) just walked in as I <br/>
was watching the news. Victim #11 was shot tonight in Virginia <br/>
and I exclaimed, &quot;Oh no!&quot; as the news report came on. She said, <br/>
&quot;What? What&#39;s wrong?&quot; I could have lied. I could have changed <br/>
the subject. I could have said, &quot;You&#39;re too young.&quot; Instead I <br/>
explained what I was upset about. I made sure to reassure her <br/>
that we&#39;re far from where it&#39;s happening (we&#39;re in California) and <br/>
that I was hoping the police would catch the criminal soon.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, again, I&#39;m sure I have a much broader range of what I <br/>
consider &quot;age appropriate&quot;. My oldest (the almost-8) is a fan of <br/>
Japanese anime and watches some fairly adult-style shows on <br/>
Adult Swim late on Saturday nights. My just-5 year old loves to <br/>
watch veterinary shows on Animal Planet. My oldest, earlier this <br/>
spring, decided to watch CSI (revolting crime scene drama) with <br/>
her father (we told her what to expect, and I did try to talk her out <br/>
of it - I was wrong about what she could handle) and enjoyed it. <br/>
She also watches surgery programs on television.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, age appropriate depends on the child. If I think <br/>
something is going to be too much for my daughters, I tell them <br/>
what I think. If they still want to watch, I watch with them or their <br/>
father does until we know they&#39;re okay with it (or they&#39;ve said, <br/>
&quot;yuck&quot; and turned it off themselves).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not concerned with limitles hours of TV viewing for a child <br/>
who has parents who notice and who has actual options for how <br/>
to spend their time. <br/>
<br/>
Children who do not have limits under those circumstances <br/>
don&#39;t watch TV the way children who do have limits watch TV. The <br/>
television is not a magical forbidden temple to my children. It&#39;s <br/>
entertainment they take advantage of -- sometimes a little, <br/>
sometimes a lot. They practice somersaults while watching <br/>
Sponge Bob. They pretend to be baby foxes and crawl all over <br/>
the floor during Crocodile Hunter. They race in and out of a room <br/>
while the television is on and leave it on the slightest whim to go <br/>
play outside. <br/>
<br/>
Actually sitting down to watch a program for more than awhile <br/>
indicates they need the quiet time, or that the program is simply <br/>
riveting (and they aren&#39;t easily riveted, they know they don&#39;t have <br/>
to stuff in as much TV as they can before we say &quot;that&#39;s enough&quot; <br/>
and decide for them. It&#39;s the same reason my children don&#39;t <br/>
gorge on chocolate -- what&#39;s the point when they can have it any <br/>
time in any quantity they want?)<br/>
<br/>
Many children in school come from TV-watching houses where <br/>
there is nothing better to do and/or where the parents are <br/>
constantly shushing the children and punishing them for being <br/>
spirited, so the kids have little choice of anything to do BUT <br/>
watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter is very slender, my youngest somewhat <br/>
chunky. I was slender, my husband&#39;s sisters were chunky. <br/>
Neither is a couch potato, they&#39;re both very active girls with <br/>
different body types. And they may change body type as time <br/>
goes on. I have been given no reason to worry about their <br/>
physical health or weight.<br/>

To me the difference lies in a statement and a hypothesis. I know it&#39;s semantics, but it certainly works for me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your views on TV. I&#39;m still digesting it. I do not believe my problem is a lack of trust, but rather a fear installed by the media.<br/>
<br/>
Yes I can see that the research might be a reflection on families a bit different to ours. I know my son usually always chooses reading to stories to watching TV, but sometimes I say know when he&#39;s already spent two hours in the mornings watching his programmes and then want to watch a video later.<br/>

sex and violence.  If you were watching a program and something came on<br/>
that concerned him you would be there to explain it.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think we can know what age appropriate is.  I think the person<br/>
who can best decide that is the child.  My son always loved monster<br/>
movies and when Starship Troopers came out I was worried that the brain<br/>
sucking scene would be too much for him.  We talked about it and he<br/>
wanted to see the movie anyway.  He loved it.  What I thought might be a<br/>
problem wasn&#39;t in any way.  He has a firm grasp on what is real and what<br/>
is not.  He&#39;s a good judge of what he can handle.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve never known my son&#39;s TV viewing to be limitless.  It&#39;s just I&#39;m not<br/>
the one limiting it.  He does that himself.  Sometimes he watches TV,<br/>
sometimes he doesn&#39;t.  He has other interests and ambitions.   We can<br/>
make sure our kids have other good choices of entertainment and they can<br/>
decide for themselves which are appropriate.  <br/>
I have seen some of the concerns relating TV to obesity in children but<br/>
TV has no calories.  A  sedentary lifestyle may not be the healthiest<br/>
one, but we sit for other things as well, and I&#39;ve not yet heard any push<br/>
to ban books because kids who read all the time are sitting. <br/>
Kids sit at school too, much longer than my son ever sits during TV.  <br/>
Frequently he is upside down or in the process of getting upside down. <br/>
Kids sit for homework.  Let&#39;s be realistic.  A parent doesn&#39;t have to<br/>
watch their child sit all day.  You can take kids walking and hiking and<br/>
swimming and skiing and biking and out to play hopscotch. <br/>
<br/>
As far as schools having to teach kids to jump and hop, etc, school<br/>
&quot;teaches&quot; a lot of things that kids will do when they&#39;re ready without<br/>
all that teaching.  Gross motor skill development is on their list now of<br/>
things that must be taught, but If the child is walking at school age I&#39;d<br/>
say he&#39;s on his way to gross motor skill development and he did it<br/>
without the schools help.  I believe it&#39;s wrong that schools force<br/>
children into reading because they are a certain age, and I don&#39;t see any<br/>
difference between that and forcing jump rope skills.  It&#39;s more than a<br/>
little silly that we make kids go sit all day at school and then develop<br/>
special programs for them because they sit too much.  It probably works<br/>
slick for everyone to blame TV.<br/>
