<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808278259">Thank you Kim and everyone for all your input on bedtimes, computer use and <br/>
math...I find all your input very helpful and supportive.<br/>
<br/>
I have battled back and forth around structure vs. unstructured <br/>
homeschooling since my ds were 8 and 6 yo (now 13 and 11). I know the best <br/>
advice for me is JUST RELAX. Part of it is all the old &quot;shoulds&quot; that we <br/>
learned in school. I believe the other part of it is that I feel kinda LOST. <br/>
Without the structure of the curriculum and all its requirements and demands <br/>
to push...when we let go of it...the girls go off and play and I feel as if, <br/>
after all these years of being so involved with them, that I am rather <br/>
stunned. Like, what do I do now? And what did I used to be interested in? I <br/>
guess I keep checking to see if it is really okay for me to take time to <br/>
focus more on my own interests again (whatever they are...). Kind of like <br/>
the empty-nest thing, I guess. The girls are busy all the time. They read <br/>
alot, work on the computer, play with their animals, do role-playing dramas, <br/>
play piano, play ball, do some chores, cook and bake, and on and  on. I know <br/>
that their resistance to the curriculum stuff we have around is due to their <br/>
present healing from the structured approach we took last year where we had <br/>
them do some math, history, english, science, writing, etc. 4 days per week. <br/>
Now that we have once again let go of the &quot;program&quot; they are thrilled to <br/>
have the weekly assignments stuff &quot;off their backs&quot;. We had included <br/>
software in typing and Spanish in their curriculums as well and now I see <br/>
that they are also staying away from that. Even the encarta program that <br/>
they liked hasn&#39;t been touched. I think anything you &quot;require&quot; turns into a <br/>
&quot;no fun&quot; thing, so when the requirements are lifted, they still have a &quot;bad <br/>
taste&quot; over it.<br/>
It will all balance out over time, I bet.<br/>
<br/>
I need to get over this idea that I need to be &quot;on-call&quot; and always <br/>
available for them. For the last 13 years, I have been &quot;right there&quot;. I DO <br/>
need to RELAX and start doing my OWN unschooling. Maybe it will take me <br/>
awhile too, to find my way. I have been doing some structured educating with <br/>
them (off and on) for about 5 years and living a very structured mom&#39;s life <br/>
for 13 years. I think I have kind of lost myself...or maybe I am learning <br/>
from them for the first time in my life, how to &quot;lighten up&quot; and I want to <br/>
feel that same joy that they demonstrate in following one&#39;s bliss. I ache <br/>
for that and yet I don&#39;t know how to get there yet.<br/>
when they are off playing all day now...and glad to be free of the &quot;push&quot;, <br/>
how can I &quot;do my thing&quot; and yet still be a &quot;good&quot; mom and be available for <br/>
them. I guess my fear is that I am afraid I will somehow &quot;not do it <br/>
RIGHT&quot;...like I am using unschooling to get out of doing a &quot;good&quot; job at <br/>
teaching my girls...I start fearing that I am slouching on the job if I am <br/>
over here having my own fine time and they are &quot;just playing&quot; instead of <br/>
&quot;learning what they are SUPPOSED to be learning. WHEW!!! You can tell I have <br/>
been WELL PROGRAMMED, huh? My heart says FREEDOM; my mind is at WAR and full <br/>
of judgement when we do not have STUCTURE and CONTROL.<br/>
<br/>
I need to paste RELAX AND TRUST on my forehead, both for my ds AND for me <br/>
and my process too. And I really need your support right now too...so thank <br/>
you.  Linda<br/>

just relax<br><br>&lt;&lt;Thank you Kim and everyone for all your input on 
bedtimes, computer use and <br>math...I find all your input very helpful and 
supportive.&gt;&gt;<br><br></div>As I read your post I kept&nbsp;nodding my head 
and saying, &quot;uh huh, I&#39;ve either been there or am going through a lot of what 
you are now.&nbsp; And I took up gardening with a fervor!&nbsp; I found out that 
I love to garden and that is what I do for myself!&nbsp; It has also rubbed off 
on the girls as well!&nbsp; They still have their own interests separate from 
mine.&nbsp; They are still trying to get me to read the rest of the Harry Potter 
books!&nbsp; I have only gotten through the first 1 and 1/2 books!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have also noticed that&nbsp;my girls are repelled from the work books 
that they had to do as well!&nbsp; I guess I will have to get them all new books 
that they choose this year!&nbsp; They know that is the one thing that I will 
always buy them when we go to the store, anything else they want, has to be 
purchased with their own money!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&lt;&lt;&lt;when they are off playing all day now...and glad to be free of 
the &quot;push&quot;, <br>how can I &quot;do my thing&quot; and yet still be a &quot;good&quot; mom and be 
available for <br>them. I guess my fear is that I am afraid I will somehow &quot;not 
do it <br>RIGHT&quot;...like I am using unschooling to get out of doing a &quot;good&quot; job 
at <br>teaching my girls...&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, I felt that way too, but I tell myself, the other way was not 
working.&nbsp; And that is why we are here and on this list!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I know, it&#39;s scary, we just have one shot at raising our kids and we want 
to do it right, but for me, it just feels right!</div>
