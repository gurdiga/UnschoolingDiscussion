<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806791089">&lt;&lt;Were you ever able to follow up on how those kids turned out?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  I think about them often.  Those 2 and one other boy who burned down<br/>
half of a small town and was placed in a youth ranch.  That kid could fight<br/>
like the dickens, curse like a sailor, threaten everyone around him with<br/>
physical violence.....but he was so tender raising little runt pigs.  We<br/>
used to have our &quot;sessions&quot; out at the pig farm because he was able to open<br/>
up and be himself there.<br/>
<br/>
I think about those boys very regular.<br/>
