&lt;&lt; The closer we get to high school (both turning 13 this<br/>
year), the more I panic.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is no high school in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have to bolster myself and remind myself that I<br/>
made an educated decision ...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re really attached to &quot;education,&quot; still.  You used it here and its in <br/>
your e-mail address.<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;education&quot; is something someone does to someone else (or even to <br/>
oneself, but still it&#39;s the insertion of a prescribed body of SOMETHING).    <br/>
<br/>
Learning just happens, not from a set of things they &quot;should know,&quot; but from <br/>
all the things they DO know, and if their learning in the back yard is as <br/>
valid and real as their learning in the front yard, if their learning by the river <br/>
is as real as their learning on a mountain, soon you can see that their <br/>
learning from a TV show is as real as their learning from a book.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the book is an almanac and the TV show is The Price is Right.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the book is twenty year old dirt on some actress&#39;s marriage, and the TV <br/>
show is a re-run of Connections on PBS.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is taking every bit of stuff you hear/see/touch/think/smell/taste <br/>
and connecting it to other things in your mind.  The more input and the more <br/>
peace to connect, the more learning has taken place.<br/>
<br/>
Motherly nervousness doesn&#39;t add a lot to what your kids know.  Being and <br/>
doing with them will though!<br/>
