<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311612333">There&#39;s a Sylvan Learning Center ad on Neopets:<br/>
 <br/>
Is it time for a tutor?<br/>
 <br/>
(an animated checklist checks itself off slowly:)<br/>
 <br/>
I want my child to feel more confident about school.<br/>
My child&#39;s report card could be better.<br/>
My child has struggled with homework.<br/>
 <br/>
I clicked to see their special offers, but they won&#39;t give fees, just  <br/>
collect information in exchange for a printable certificate.<br/>
 <br/>
The specials include $100 off a Sylvan program<br/>
$25 off Sylvan Skills Assessment<br/>
 <br/>
So... Assuming they&#39;re not offering more than 1/3 off, that&#39;s some pretty  <br/>
expensive assistance.<br/>
 <br/>
When Holly was five and we were hosting a weekly unschooling get-together a  <br/>
family came by.  The dad was into unschooling.  The mom was half owner  of a <br/>
new Sylvan center (which she had added onto a kids&#39; gymnasium she had  bought). <br/>
 The family ended up separated and then divorced, but the kids  (two little <br/>
girls) liked Holly so she was in on the whole unfolding,  visiting at various <br/>
apartments and houses for six or seven years after, and was  invited to the <br/>
mom&#39;s remarriage wedding etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
Turns out the mom&#39;s interest in coming to our group was the hope of  <br/>
recruiting people for her Sylvan center.  A couple of times when Holly was  with her, <br/>
she &quot;let Holly have a lesson.&quot;  She really had zero confidence in  humans and <br/>
a lot of love for her potential business.  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m sorry for the school culture that makes parents put time  and <br/>
energy into afterschool tutoring and pressure, when they could have done  better <br/>
to have spent that time and money taking kids on overnight trips to the  next <br/>
state, or just BEING with them in relaxed and happy ways.   Poor kids and poor <br/>
parents.  <br/>
 <br/>
And I&#39;m reminded to be grateful for my own life in which the list of  <br/>
questions about confidence, report cards and struggle are not applicable.   Kirby <br/>
struggled some with his math class the first couple of weeks, but he chose  to be <br/>
in it and it was tuition-free.  We paid for the books.  He kept  asking <br/>
questions in class and asked a few different people to explain this or  that their <br/>
way, so he had more than one perspective.   Kids at school  are pretty much <br/>
trained away from doing that, and it&#39;s sad.  So they pay  &quot;professionals&quot; to try <br/>
a different outside insertion method.<br/>
 <br/>
Hooray, we don&#39;t need it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The ads on TV have been bugging me for a long time. They&#39;re really not about<br/>
the kids in the ads at all. They&#39;re all about that good feeling, the fix,<br/>
the mom gets when she sees her kids report card or other &#39;improvements&#39;. The<br/>
kid really isn&#39;t important except in how he/she makes her parent feel.<br/>
