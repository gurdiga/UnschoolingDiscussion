He&#39;s 18.  Does he still have to go to school?  Has he  graduated?  Does he <br/>
want to go to college?  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d just leave him be...maybe encourage him to get a job, get out and make  <br/>
friends.  Get the local free weekly paper and help him find interesting  things <br/>
to do, like concerts or whathaveyou.  If he&#39;s interested in reading  it, get <br/>
him The Teenage Liberation Handbook.  <br/>
 <br/>
He&#39;s in a huge transition, moving from one country to another, and then  just <br/>
being 18 with a schooled history.  Is there any hurry for him to be on  some <br/>
sort of track?<br/>
