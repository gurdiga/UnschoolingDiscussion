<div id="ygrps-yiv-329344179">As I am the one who started all this discussion about unschooling<br/>
highschoolers I want to thank all of you that responded and gave me good ideas.<br/>
<br/>
1. The idea of attending community college is one that I have had in the<br/>
back of my mind. We have one nearby that offers correspondence courses. I<br/>
imagine that with a few of those courses under her belt to &quot;prove&quot; her<br/>
ability it might be easier to convince a college that she was capable.<br/>
<br/>
2.The idea of taking the GED with no studying is a wild one but one to think<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
3.It&#39;s OK to go with some structure IF the one being schooled/unschooled is<br/>
in favor of that.<br/>
<br/>
4.I believe that one of the best talents that we can give our kids is how to<br/>
learn for themselves. Think of all the stuff that we learned and promptly<br/>
forgot, but if we know how to go about acessing this information we can<br/>
learn or relearn very quickly when we have an interest.<br/>

I wasn&#39;t suggesting anyone purposely NOT study for anything. Taking the GED<br/>
early is a really DOable option though. ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I&#39;m such an an over-achiever that I couldn&#39;t even stomach the <br/>
idea of not studying for something like this.  But, the reality is, why not <br/>
just give it a go?  If they don&#39;t pass it the first time out, they can easily <br/>
retake it and I don&#39;t think there is even an additional charge, if there is, <br/>
it&#39;s minimal.<br/>
<br/>
Depends on the personality and maybe I&#39;m missing something...but, I don&#39;t see <br/>
any reason to be concerned about &#39;failing&#39;.  If the test isn&#39;t passed, then <br/>
the student knows what to brush up on for the next try.  <br/>
<br/>
I took a GED rather than graduating.  Since then I&#39;ve been on to college and <br/>
in the work place.  In the last 25 years NO ONE has asked to see my test <br/>
scores.  At most they just want to know I have the certificate.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth.<br/>
