  <div><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">&gt;But mostly I feel it is the 
  fathers that miss out by working so much... I<br>can&#39;t imaging it any 
  more.&nbsp; Not after I have experienced the difference in<br>the depth of my 
  connection to them.&nbsp; In an ideal world I think both parents<br>should 
  have the privledge of experiencing this closeness with 
  their<br>children.&lt;</font></div>

  <div><font face="Times New Roman" size="4">I think that my children have learned 
  so much this year by having Dad home. (DH was injured in an accident) With DH 
  home, we have had more time to travel and not worry about time constraints. It 
  also serves as a buffer when I need down time. I know that DH has loved the 
  time he has spent with the children, and none of us looks forward to the day 
  that he returns to the office. :( It is so great to have him here, and he has 
  learned things about the children that I do not think he would if he were 
  going to the office at 6:30am.</font></div>
