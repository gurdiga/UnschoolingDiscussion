<div id="ygrps-yiv-1132707811">Instead of soccer camp, why not send your kids to &quot;Action Camp&quot; next year?<br/>
They&#39;ll learn important skills which will serve them well throughout life.<br/>
<br/>
Better yet, why not make it a family vacation?<br/>
<br/>
From the online prospectus:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Since Ruckus was founded in 1995, thousands of activists have attended our<br/>
 </span></blockquote>week-long training programs throughout North America. We&#39;ve shared skills<br/>
with recognized frontline organizers from all over the world - activists<br/>
combating authoritarian regimes and multinational corporations&#39; ecological<br/>
obliteration and human rights abuses. We call it Action Camp. U.S. News and<br/>
World Report call it &quot;Basic Training for Tree Huggers&quot;. The New York Times<br/>
asked, &quot;Can Green Rads Be Tamed?&quot; and a spokesperson for B.C. lumber<br/>
interests stated, &quot;it&#39;s just insanity.&quot; Flattering praise indeed.&lt;&lt;<br/>
