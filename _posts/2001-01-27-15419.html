<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649841486">Dumbya owes big time for the support he received during his campaign from<br/>
religious organizations.  He and Read My Lips have a long history of<br/>
backroom deal making (spell that money laundering) with the Catholic Church<br/>
via D&#39;Onofrio.  It would appear that it is no payback time.<br/>
<br/>
This is no different than the way he kissed up to women during the campaign<br/>
to get their votes with statements and evasions about abortion issues.<br/>

Heaven help those that don&#39;t belong to an &quot;approved&quot; religious group if he<br/>
manages to get this through Congress!<br/>

<br/>
PRESIDENT BUSH AND &#39;FAITH-BASED&#39; INITIATIVES<br/>
AU Report And Answers To Frequently Asked Questions<br/>
<br/>
President George W. Bush has announced that the week of January 29, the<br/>
second full week of his presidency, will be devoted to building support for<br/>
&quot;faith-based&quot; government initiatives. As part of his approach, Bush<br/>
reportedly will be unveiling a new federal office of &quot;faith-based action,&quot;<br/>
along with the details of his administration&#39;s plans to fund religious<br/>
groups to provide social services.<br/>
<br/>
Americans United for Separation of Church and State has prepared this<br/>
document to provide background information on Bush&#39;s position on the issue,<br/>
his record in Texas and a preview of what will likely be discussed based on<br/>
the president&#39;s materials and speeches made available during the<br/>
presidential campaign.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bush intends to throw the massive weight of the federal government behind<br/>
religious groups and religious conversions,&quot; said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn,<br/>
executive director of Americans United.  The president appears to believe<br/>
that the government should use religion to solve all of the nation&#39;s social<br/>
problems. This approach strikes at the heart of the religious freedoms<br/>
guaranteed by the First Amendment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bush&#39;s Support For &#39;Charitable Choice&#39;<br/>
<br/>
During the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush was often vague about specific<br/>
positions on public policy. On faith-based initiatives (or &quot;charitable<br/>
choice,&quot; as it is often called), Bush never vacillated in his enthusiastic<br/>
support.<br/>
<br/>
Charitable choice originated with former-Sen. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.) during<br/>
the drafting of the 1996 Welfare Reform Act. The concept altered existing<br/>
law to permit taxpayer-financed social service funding of houses of worship<br/>
in a few welfare programs.<br/>
<br/>
This legislative approach represented a radical change. In the past,<br/>
government would contract with religious groups to provide services, but<br/>
safeguards were kept in place to protect the integrity of the groups and the<br/>
interests of taxpayers. Religious institutions would have to create separate<br/>
secular entities to deal with public funds.  Charitable choice removed those<br/>
safeguards, allowing groups to evangelize while providing publicly financed<br/>
services. It also permits groups to discriminate in hiring on religious<br/>
grounds, despite financial support for the government.<br/>
<br/>
Bush quickly became a fervent advocate of the policy, and as Texas&#39;<br/>
governor, was among the nation&#39;s first chief executives to implement<br/>
charitable choice at the state level. Shortly after charitable choice became<br/>
law in Washington, D.C., Bush created a 16-member Governor&#39;s Advisory Task<br/>
Force on Faith-Based Community Service Groups, which issued a report calling<br/>
for a church-state partnership in the Lone Star State. Bush subsequently<br/>
issued an executive order directing state agencies to work with houses of<br/>
worship to provide social services while allowing them to maintain their<br/>
&quot;unique ecclesiastical nature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Expanding Existing Programs As President<br/>
<br/>
As president, Bush intends to expand the charitable choice approach to<br/>
unprecedented levels, applying the principle to virtually all aspects of<br/>
government aid. (For specifics, see Bush&#39;s campaign website at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.georgewbush.com/issues/armiescompassion.html">http://www.georgewbush.com/issues/armiescompassion.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;In every instance when my administration sees a responsibility to help<br/>
people, we will look first to faith-based institutions, to charities and to<br/>
community groups that have shown their ability to save and change lives,&quot;<br/>
Bush said on July 22, 1999, at a rally in Indianapolis.<br/>
<br/>
According to news media reports, Bush proposes spending $8 billion during<br/>
his first year in office on tax incentives for charitable donations and in<br/>
direct support to charities and religious groups. (That figure may<br/>
ultimately be even higher. On Sept. 21, 2000, Bush wrote in USA Today that<br/>
he would allocate $80 billion over 10 years in tax incentives to help<br/>
churches provide services.) Bush has expressed concern that existing federal<br/>
funding mechanisms may not be efficient enough in distributing tax dollars<br/>
to religious ministries so he has promised a new government agency to make<br/>
things easier.<br/>
<br/>
Bush has explained that the new agency, once in place, will remove barriers<br/>
that prevent additional funding of religious groups, coordinate federal<br/>
funding from multiple government agencies and encourage states to establish<br/>
their own faith-based offices to facilitate state funds going to religious<br/>
groups.<br/>
<br/>
It is his position on this issue that serves as the single most serious<br/>
threat to church-state separation.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bush is proposing an unprecedented program of government funding of<br/>
religion, involving literally billions in taxpayer dollars,&quot; said Americans<br/>
United&#39;s Lynn. &quot;His plan for social services would essentially merge church<br/>
and state into a single bureaucracy that would dispense religion alongside<br/>
government aid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Effect Of Bush&#39;s Changes<br/>
<br/>
The practical effects of Bush&#39;s proposals would be sweeping and dramatic.<br/>
Under his plan, Bush would distribute federal tax dollars to religious<br/>
groups to provide a plethora of social services now being provided by<br/>
government agencies or secular groups. He wants religious groups to provide<br/>
services in areas including after-school programs for children, job<br/>
training, drug treatment, prison rehabilitation programs and abstinence<br/>
programs.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, Bush intends to use tax dollars, houses of worship and his<br/>
office of faith-based action to create church-state &quot;partnerships&quot; at an<br/>
unparalleled level. In the process, the president literally hopes to change<br/>
the lives of millions of Americans. As Bush wrote in the foreword to Marvin<br/>
Olasky&#39;s Compassionate Conservatism, a 2000 book about expanding charitable<br/>
choice, &quot;Government can do certain things very well, but it cannot put hope<br/>
in our hearts or a sense of purpose in our lives. That requires churches and<br/>
synagogues and mosques and charities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Church-state experts describe the new faith-based government agency as part<br/>
of a misguided and dangerous approach to public policy. &quot;The Constitution<br/>
requires a separation between religion and government, not a government<br/>
agency designed to unite the two,&quot; said AU&#39;s Lynn. &quot;The very existence of a<br/>
federal office whose sole purpose is to give tax dollars to religious groups<br/>
is in irreparable conflict with the First Amendment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Americans United Responds To Frequently Asked Questions<br/>
<br/>
* How will the needy people who receive assistance from the religious groups<br/>
be affected by Bush&#39;s approach?<br/>
<br/>
The religious freedom of beneficiaries would be threatened. Those in need<br/>
could be subjected to religious indoctrination when they are sent to a<br/>
religious organization to obtain their government benefits. Religious<br/>
organizations are able to combine the government services with various forms<br/>
of religious indoctrination, such as religious teaching or the excessive<br/>
display of religious icons or symbols.<br/>
<br/>
All of this amounts to a serious violation of religious liberty. Imagine the<br/>
discomfort of a Roman Catholic family referred to Louis Farrakhan&#39;s Nation<br/>
of Islam for help, or a Hindu directed to a Mormon temple to get assistance.<br/>
<br/>
In many communities, Bush&#39;s policies will put the poor in an impossible<br/>
position. They will either submit to religious coercion or go without food,<br/>
shelter or other needed services to which they are legally entitled. Placing<br/>
people in need in this kind of position is wrong. In theory, charitable<br/>
choice is supposed to offer secular alternatives, but as a practical matter,<br/>
those alternatives are not always available to those in need.<br/>
<br/>
* Will Bush&#39;s policy lead to federally funded employment discrimination?<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely. When religious groups receive tax dollars through charitable<br/>
choice, they are free to discriminate on religious grounds in hiring.<br/>
Allowing religious groups to take tax aid and still discriminate will be a<br/>
central part of the plan implemented by Bush&#39;s new government agency. A<br/>
religious group will be able to receive public tax dollars to pay for a job,<br/>
but still be free to hang up a sign that says &quot;Jews And Catholics Need Not<br/>
Apply.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just imagine: your money pays for a job that you can&#39;t have because of your<br/>
religious beliefs. That&#39;s not compassionate conservatism; that&#39;s outrageous.<br/>
<br/>
Under Bush&#39;s plan, it will be perfectly legal. Taxpayer money should never<br/>
be used to subsidize any type of discrimination.<br/>
<br/>
* Isn&#39;t Bush concerned about the faith-based initiative conflicting with the<br/>
First Amendment?<br/>
<br/>
Bush is apparently aware of the constitutional difficulties surrounding<br/>
expansive public funding of ministries to provide government services, yet<br/>
he seems to have little use for church-state separation.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in a July campaign speech, Bush brushed aside legal<br/>
difficulties. &quot;I&#39;m told by the legal experts that my initiative will pass<br/>
constitutional muster,&quot; Bush said. &quot;We will send money to fund services. But<br/>
the money does not go to fund the religious programs within the<br/>
institution.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is a distinction without a difference. In most cases, the services<br/>
being provided are explicitly religious. Thus, there is no way to fund<br/>
religious programs without also funding religion.<br/>
<br/>
* If Bush believes religion is the key to changing lives, why doesn&#39;t he<br/>
admit he wants to fund religious services?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a half-hearted attempt to make this effort seem legal. But just as<br/>
importantly, it exposes a serious flaw in Bush&#39;s approach to this policy.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, the president openly acknowledges that public funds cannot<br/>
go to finance religion. On the other hand, Bush believes adamantly that it<br/>
is religion that has the power to &quot;change lives,&quot; which is why he thinks<br/>
religious ministries deserve government support. Complicating matters, Bush<br/>
believes the groups should get public funds without strings. In a December<br/>
1996 speech in San Antonio, Bush said Christian ministers will provide<br/>
public services with tax dollars &quot;on their terms, not ours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This creates a paradox. Bush cannot change people&#39;s lives by funding<br/>
religious ministries and maintain the façade that tax dollars aren&#39;t<br/>
financing religion. If Bush intends to change lives by funding religion,<br/>
he&#39;s violating the Constitution in the process. Unfortunately for his<br/>
administration, Bush can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>
<br/>
* Will all religious groups be eligible for funding under Bush&#39;s plan?<br/>
<br/>
Apparently not. Initially, Bush said all groups would be able to receive<br/>
government funds. In his 1999 speech in Indianapolis, Bush insisted that<br/>
services provided by ministries be &quot;non-sectarian&quot; and said, &quot;We will keep a<br/>
commitment to pluralism [and] not discriminate for or against Methodist or<br/>
Mormons or Muslims or good people with no faith at all.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
However, in the spring of 2000, Bush was asked if tax dollars would be<br/>
distributed to the Nation of Islam to provide publicly financed services. &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t see how we can allow public dollars to fund programs where spite and<br/>
hate is the core of the message,&quot; Bush said on March 2. &quot;Louis Farrakhan<br/>
preaches hate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These comments suggest that there are problems with the policy to which Bush<br/>
has not prepared solutions. Legal experts already question whether public<br/>
funding of multiple religious groups is legal, but Bush would run into an<br/>
immediate constitutional quagmire if he selects some faith traditions for<br/>
public support, while excluding others.<br/>
<br/>
* How will the religious institutions be affected by Bush&#39;s efforts?<br/>
<br/>
Bush&#39;s plan threatens the independence of the religious institutions. The<br/>
government regulates activities that it subsidizes, since it is obliged to<br/>
make certain that taxpayer funds are properly spent. Once churches, temples,<br/>
mosques and synagogues are being financed by the public, some of their<br/>
freedom will be placed in jeopardy by the almost certain regulation to<br/>
follow.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, many houses of worship already do a fine job operating soup<br/>
kitchens and homeless shelters with voluntary contributions. Many houses of<br/>
worship believe that they are called by their religious faith to provide<br/>
these services. Participation in these programs and the tendency of people<br/>
in the pews to &quot;dig a little deeper&quot; to help fund them may draw congregants<br/>
more fully into the lives of their churches. Inevitably these contributions<br/>
from church members will diminish if religious institutions start receiving<br/>
public dollars to provide services. In the long run, charitable choice will<br/>
make religious institutions dependent on the government for money and lessen<br/>
church vitality.<br/>
<br/>
 * * * * *<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s nothing compassionate about Bush&#39;s legally dubious scheme,&quot;<br/>
concluded AU&#39;s Lynn. &quot;Contributions to religious groups must come from<br/>
supporters voluntarily, not be forced by the government. Bush&#39;s faith-based<br/>
initiative is a constitutional nightmare and a disastrous step in the wrong<br/>
direction.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Americans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington,<br/>
D.C. Founded in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and allied<br/>
houses of worship in all 50 states.<br/>

Bush to roll out faith-based initiatives, prescription drug plan next week<br/>
<br/>
By G. Robert Hillman<br/>
<br/>
WASHINGTON -- President Bush, working down his list of campaign promises,<br/>
will offer Congress next week his proposals to aid faith-based charities and<br/>
his plan to help the elderly meet the high costs of prescription drugs,<br/>
aides said Thursday.<br/>
As a prelude, the new president and first lady Laura Bush had dinner<br/>
Thursday night in eighboring Hyattsville, Md., with the Rev. Theodore<br/>
McCarrick, the Catholic archbishop of Washington who has been elevated to<br/>
cardinal.<br/>
<br/>
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer, who previewed next week&#39;s agenda,<br/>
noted that Bush had made his faith-based initiatives a cornerstone of his<br/>
campaign and was determined to offer his proposals to Congress early in his<br/>
administration.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are more ways to help people,&quot; Fleischer said, calling Bush&#39;s<br/>
initiatives the next step in welfare reform.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Faith-based solutions are one way to help those people make a better life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
During the campaign, the former Texas governor vowed to rally the &quot;armies of<br/>
compassion&quot; to help deliver social services.<br/>
<br/>
He has proposed to allow taxpayers who do not itemize to deduct their<br/>
charitable contributions, at a cost in lost revenue of about $6.3 billion a<br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, he has called for another $1.7 billion in charitable grants<br/>
and the creation of an Office of Faith-Based Action.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The president made a series of promises during the campaign, and he&#39;s going<br/>
to honor them,&quot; Fleischer said. &quot;There will be weeks where we have a strong<br/>
focus on an issue. There will be weeks where there will be several issues<br/>
discussed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also next week, Fleischer said the president plans to address one of the<br/>
more contentious campaign issues: prescription drug benefits for the<br/>
elderly.<br/>
<br/>
The initial proposals to change the 35-year-old Medicare health-care program<br/>
for the elderly would involve only Bush&#39;s stop-gap program to provide poor<br/>
seniors with some relief for the high costs of their prescription drugs,<br/>
Fleischer said.<br/>
<br/>
Even before the president formally offered his faith-based initiatives,<br/>
however, critics continue to question whether they might violate the<br/>
separation of church and state provision of the Constitution.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Constitution created a separation between religion and government, not<br/>
a massive new bureaucracy designed to unite the two,&quot; said the Rev. Barry<br/>
Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and<br/>
State.<br/>
<br/>
Responding, the president told reporters in a brief question-and-answer<br/>
session in the Cabinet Room that he was confident his proposals would meet<br/>
constitutional muster.</div>
