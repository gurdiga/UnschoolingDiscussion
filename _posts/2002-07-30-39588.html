<div id="ygrps-yiv-717932612">Hey all,<br/>
<br/>
Tuck, I can identify! I have a 9yo who discovered baseball this summer. It <br/>
is ALL he wants to do. When there&#39;s no one around to pitch-and-catch with, <br/>
he sits on the front porch and mopes. In his precious, ragged baseball cap.  <br/>
Baseball just ended -- and he wants to know when sigh-ups start. Of course, <br/>
baseball is full of statistics... a great way to learn percentages and <br/>
fractions!<br/>
<br/>
I do have a small problem. My 5 yo thinks he&#39;s much bigger than he is. He <br/>
thinks he&#39;s 9, basically, like his big brother. THe trouble with that is <br/>
that he looks down on anyone his age. There is a  a little boy down the <br/>
street and my 5yo won&#39;t play with him because this kid, who is his age, is a <br/>
  &quot;stupid wussy baby.&quot; The little boy is admittedly bossy (a very verbal <br/>
only child) but I think it&#39;s wrong for my 5yo to be so mean to him-- , if <br/>
the little boy shows up at our door, my son runs off, locks a door, and <br/>
calls the little boy a baby or a &quot;wussy boy&quot; until the other kid leaves in <br/>
tears. I don&#39;t care if they play together or not, actually. I just don&#39;t <br/>
want my llittle guy to be a bully. When I try to reason with him -- ie, &quot;how <br/>
would you feel if someone called you names?&quot; -- he responds by saying, &quot;But <br/>
Mom! William IS a wussy boy!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s getting this from his brother and his brother&#39;s friends, and <br/>
really fixated on it! Has anyone had a problem with their child being mean <br/>
to some other kid, and what do you do??<br/>
<br/>
