<div id="ygrps-yiv-892842084">Ive heard many similar stories from public school.  My son, ( in public high <br/>
school) has done the same thing, as well as his classmates.  Most times, the <br/>
teacher never catches the remarks.. Sometimes they do, and the most <br/>
&quot;consequence&quot; that has ever been rendered was maybe a verbal reprimand and of <br/>
course, the answer counted wrong.    That teacher needs a reality check, not <br/>
you.. ridiculous.  I think sometimes the answers the kids come up with are <br/>
more intelligent that the actual answers.  I&#39;ve gotten a big kick out of some <br/>
that Landon has told me about.   <br/>
