 </span></blockquote>Wow, that was a cool story!  I&#39;ll save this one for my daughter (i.e., LOL, <br/>
send it to her e-mail addy, and yes we DO live in the same house, I&#39;m ALWAYS <br/>
doing this, geezsh)! when she returns from her trip.  She&#39;s always (since I can <br/>
remember) been really into Dinasours/Palenontolgy, so this trip she&#39;s on is <br/>
perfect for her.  LOL, guess what we&#39;ll be studying a lot about this year?  And <br/>
we can add Jack Horner to the list for reading!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m just hoping my OLD video camera is working for her.  We haven&#39;t used <br/>
the thing in years (in fact, I thought the battery charger was lost, till be <br/>
moved, and it suddenly showed up in the new place, go figure, I sure don&#39;t <br/>
remember seeing it when things were packed).  I know, if it does work, we can <br/>
have her &quot;movie&quot; memories transferred to VHS, now I&#39;m wondering if we can then <br/>
have it transferred to DVD.  If so, it will probably have to go to VHS first, <br/>
then DVD.  I can only hope for the best!<br/>
<br/>
Again, thanks for the heads up for additional reading!  Sounds great!  <br/>
Amazing the stuff we learn on our own because of our own driven interests, huh?<br/>
