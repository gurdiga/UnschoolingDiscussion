<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have to agree with everyone else that unschooling 
encompasses so much of life that it is impossible to separate &quot;academics&quot; from 
&quot;other stuff&quot;.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if we have a typical day as so much depends on 
the season and weather.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">In general we do animal chores first, milking, 
feeding, raking out pens, then come in for breakfast.&nbsp; Two of the three 
kids do the dishes, and they all do their inside chores next.&nbsp; I usually 
try to check my email in the morning too.&nbsp; After that I check with them and 
see if anyone needs my help with anything.&nbsp; Depending on what needs to be 
done I may assign them something, like &quot;work on one of your 4-H projects&quot;, or 
&quot;clean out your closet today&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the weather is good then the two 
younger will usually go outside and play in their fort, or take a hike, or just 
be with the animals.&nbsp; My oldest is very much into computers and spends a 
lot of time on one of the computers.&nbsp; He is designing a web page right 
now.&nbsp; We go out into the garden almost every day during the spring and 
summer, there may be picking and preserving to do.&nbsp; Sometimes one or 
another will work with me on cooking, sewing, or other projects.&nbsp; My 
youngest enjoys working with Dad when he does fix-it projects, so he will tag 
along whenever he can.&nbsp; During the school year we have Awana once a week, 
and 4-H meetings once a month year round.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We go to the grocery store, fabric store, library, 
all of the other places that are necessary to run a house.&nbsp; They learn by 
being a part of life instead of being an observer of it.</font></div>
