<h4>Shimokawa Family</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123993497">OK, so maybe I didn&#39;t make myself very clear.  I&#39;m not worried that<br/>
Rachel isn&#39;t getting enough to eat.  I know I have enough milk for her. <br/>
She&#39;s not particularly hungry at the dinner table, she just wants to<br/>
participate in something the rest of the family is obviously enjoying. <br/>
I was also wondering if maybe her body requirements - since she is so<br/>
big - are not satisfied by breastmilk alone.  Like, I&#39;ve heard (T or F?)<br/>
that a one year old needs different nutrients than a newborn, so I was<br/>
wondreing if that&#39;s because of size.  With Mook, we used a blender, and<br/>
never bought baby food.  He&#39;s so healthy.<br/>
<br/>
The special toy at dinnertime was a good idea.  I let her chew on the<br/>
tips (I was holding them) of some clean chopsticks.  She LOVED that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also VERY interested in herbs, essential oils, and making soap,<br/>
candles, etc.  Somebody (sorry - I forgot who) posted a vegetarian soap<br/>
making site (sunsoap.com), so I visited it, and got really interested. <br/>
When we settle down (we&#39;ll be moving three times in three months!), I&#39;m<br/>
going to start making soaps and growing herbs, etc.<br/>
