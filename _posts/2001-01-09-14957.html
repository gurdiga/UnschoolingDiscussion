<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031392298">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t believe my first post to this list (after at least a year lurking!) is going to be about a vacuum cleaner, but...<br/>
<br/>
My kids are severely allergic to dust and dust mites and one of the steps we had to take was to replace a perfectly good (and fairly new) Kenmore.  After LOTS of research, I learned something that&#39;s so obvious but never thought of - the exhaust from the vacuum is just as important<br/>
as the filtration going on inside it.  So, long story short, we bought a Miele - very expensive, but awesome!  It&#39;s a basically sealed system (engine) so that whatever particles, etc. come out in the exhaust are next to nothing while most others are sky high.  It&#39;s a fabulous<br/>
vacuum and I&#39;m a lifelong fan now! FWIW :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215972140">I had to laugh about Ann and her de-lurking about a vaccuum.  I am<br/>
pretty new to this list and have also been lurking to get the &#39;lay of<br/>
the land&#39; so to speak, and I am going to unlurk in order to second Ann&#39;s<br/>
opinion on the Miele vaccuum.  As a severe allergy sufferer myself (and<br/>
after spending at least $1,000.00 on bad vaccuums over the last 10 yrs)<br/>
I decided to do the research too, and THIS time buy one that would work<br/>
more than 6 mos. As the Miele&#39;s ARE rather expensive, I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
put in my experience with them as a new member, but as a affirmation of<br/>
a seasoned list member, I will!  Deb Jones (HS my 9 y/o daughter and 13<br/>
