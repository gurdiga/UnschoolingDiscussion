<h4>Judy Anderson</h4>
<time> 8 Mar 2005, at  9:45am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142609428">I have been reading along here for a couple of weeks and decided it was time<br/>
to start asking questions.  My name is Judy and I was homeschooled from<br/>
grades 3 through 8, then I went to public school for high school.  I always<br/>
wanted to homeschool my children, but I feared having the same lack of<br/>
social activity that I had when I was young.  My mom had no car during the<br/>
day and we lived way in the boonies, so our whole life was pretty much spent<br/>
at home.  I am finally getting over that fear and looking into taking my<br/>
children out of public school.  I have four children, three of whom live<br/>
with me.  My oldest is Cait, she is 8 and in 3rd grade and lives with her<br/>
father.  My second is Moira who is 5 and in kindergarten.  Next comes<br/>
Lauren, who is 2 and is receiving therapy for a speech delay.  Not language<br/>
delay, just speech.  She will start in the public preschool in April when<br/>
she turns 3 and will be taking advantage of the special ed she can get<br/>
there.  My baby is 12.5 months old and rather young for me to worry abuot<br/>
her education right now.  Moira loves kindergarten, so I am a little<br/>
hesitant to take her out.  I am very glad that she has gone to public school<br/>
this year because she now has friends, which she didn&#39;t before she started.<br/>
She is reading very well, much better than I thought she could until I<br/>
realized she was actually reading _Put Me In The Zoo_ instead of reciting<br/>
it.  Moira is very smart, and very sociable, and I want nothing to hold her<br/>
back, including me and my own limitations.  We are on very, very limited<br/>
resources, and I don&#39;t want her to lose out on anything because we can&#39;t<br/>
afford to take her/get it for her/etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now on to my questions.  This may seem like such a basic concept, but I am<br/>
having trouble grasping it.  I know that school is mandated so that children<br/>
are prepared to enter the adult world, and that many who dropped out of<br/>
shool before it was mandated (i.e. my granparents&#39; generation when it wasn&#39;t<br/>
uncommon to drop out of school at 6th or 8th grade to go to work) struggled.<br/>
I don&#39;t want my children to struggle like that.  How is unschooling<br/>
different from simply dropping out of school?<br/>
<br/>
Second: Due to the fact that we are on state assistance to survive until my<br/>
husband finds a job, how can I maximize my children&#39;s exposure to new and<br/>
interesting things?  Until he starts working again, we do have a car, but we<br/>
also have to budget our gas.  Obviously, going to the theater is out of the<br/>
question.  When I was young, we raised goats and my mom had a garden.  But I<br/>
can&#39;t offer those right now because we live in an apartment in the middle of<br/>
town.  I can&#39;t even send my children outside to play in the yard because<br/>
there isn&#39;t one.  We have cable and they are allowed to watch quite a bit of<br/>
it, but I limit which stations they can watch.  I also have the internet<br/>
(obviously) and I let them play on it when they like.  They tend to mostly<br/>
visit the Noggin, PBS and Nick Jr websites and play the games they find<br/>
there.  I also take them to the library regularly and take advantage of<br/>
their free programs.  We were also quite active in the SCA for a couple of<br/>
years, but money had a way of running thinner and thinner so we can no<br/>
longer afford to go to events.  Also, the size of our family has required<br/>
that we find a trailer if we wish to go to any over night events.  The<br/>
children love the SCA and were upset when we told them we had to take this<br/>
year off.  I feel that it is depriving them of an awesome environment, but<br/>
we just can&#39;t do it this year.<br/>
<br/>
I have been slowly perusing Sandra Dodd&#39;s website, but there is a lot there,<br/>
so it will take me a while.  If my questions are answered on one of those<br/>
pages, please direct me there.  I have been wracking my brain trying to<br/>
figure out why your name is so familiar, but I just can&#39;t find it.  My<br/>
husband said it is familiar to him to, but he couldn&#39;t place it either.  I<br/>
had never heard of unschooling until last month or so when some one on<br/>
another list made casual mention of it.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to not be quiet so long winded in future posts, but I can&#39;t<br/>
promise anything.  :)  Thanks for your help and ideas.<br/>

A *lot* of therapy is geared towards getting skills into kids that the<br/>
schools need them to have.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the &quot;olden days&quot; when kids maybe went to kindergarten, was there<br/>
speech therapy for 2 yos? Or did most people know that some kids develop<br/>
later and it was best to wait things out because most of them self correct.<br/>
<br/>
The unschoolers here won&#39;t be shy about telling their experiences with<br/>
waiting on speech therapy!<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Have you done a statistical analysis of that data? ;-) Do you have hard<br/>
evidence that people in their 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s who dropped out struggled more<br/>
*because* they dropped out than those who stuck school out?<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m totally guessing on when there would have been a chunk of people who<br/>
weren&#39;t required to go to school -- though frankly I remember watching<br/>
Spanky and Our Gang as a child which was filmed in the 30&#39;s (maybe) and they<br/>
had truant officers chasing after the kids.)<br/>
<br/>
There is anectdotal &quot;evidence&quot; that if you drop out you&#39;ll be a failure.<br/>
People say that to keep kids in school! Sure there are people who get<br/>
demoralized and drop out and end up even more demoralized. That&#39;s not a<br/>
recipe for success!<br/>
<br/>
But there are plenty of people who say &quot;To heck with school! I can do better<br/>
on my own!&quot; and then succeed.<br/>
<br/>
And there are many many many more (more than those who drop out I&#39;d say) who<br/>
struggle even though they went to school.<br/>
<br/>
Schools take credit for those who succeed. But they don&#39;t acknowledge<br/>
responsibility for those who stay in school and fail to succeed. That&#39;s seen<br/>
as the child&#39;s fault.<br/>
<br/>
Funny, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t want my children to struggle like that.  How is unschooling<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone drops out of school after years of being told they&#39;re a failure<br/>
and won&#39;t amount to anything if they don&#39;t succeed in school, then will<br/>
giving up on school make them realize they are filled with potential and the<br/>
world is their oyster if they just reach out and take it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I can&#39;t take my daughter to the moon. Which will come off sounding<br/>
snarky but it&#39;s not meant to be. It&#39;s meant to say if we focus on what we<br/>
can&#39;t do, it&#39;s a whole lot harder to see what we *can* do!<br/>
<br/>
If you have walls, you can put up paper -- ask around for places, like print<br/>
shops, that have lots of left overs -- and draw/paint murals. (People or<br/>
Google may have recipes for cheap paint.)<br/>
<br/>
Go for a walk down the block and count all the blue cars. Next time count<br/>
all the red cars. Next time count all the silver cars. More or less?<br/>
<br/>
Find recipes from different countries. Which might spark an interest and you<br/>
can read books set there and watch movies.<br/>
<br/>
There are books about wildlife in the cities. You&#39;d be surprised at what has<br/>
taken up residence. It&#39;s more than pigeons and squirrels.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have cable and they are allowed to watch quite a bit of<br/>
&gt; it, but I limit which stations they can watch.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Start exploring! (You&#39;ll find plenty of reading material at Sandra&#39;s site<br/>
about not limiting kids.) If your world is limited by circumstances it makes<br/>
even less sense to deliberately choose to make it more limited.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry. They won&#39;t choose to watch pornography ;-) They may choose<br/>
shows out of their comfort zone, but each time they do that, they learn more<br/>
about themselves and what they can and can&#39;t handle.<br/>
<br/>
Be there with them! Help them learn how to deal with the edges in ways other<br/>
than stepping back and closing it off :-)<br/>

referred us for a speech eval and (of course) therapy was recommended.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The reason we consented to the eval is that it seems like dd tries to <br/>
talk, but can&#39;t get the sounds out, which is what the eval also found.  <br/>
She&#39;s an excellent communicator -- she never wanted to use signs (as my <br/>
older early speaking dd did), but she pantomimes, gestures, changes her <br/>
facial expressions, and uses a few words all in combination.  It&#39;s just <br/>
recently that I&#39;m wondering if her inability to talk can&#39;t help but to <br/>
limit the complexity of what she can communicate -- things like what <br/>
she&#39;s thinking and feeling, things that happened in the past or will <br/>
happen, questions she might have ...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A *lot* of therapy is geared towards getting skills into kids that the<br/>
&gt; schools need them to have.<br/>

much less therapy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What the speech therapist said (biased source, I know) was that kids <br/>
who are late at developing speech are just that -- late at developing <br/>
speech.  That is, they don&#39;t really try to talk until they&#39;re ready, <br/>
and when they do, they don&#39;t have any difficulties pronouncing the <br/>
words.  With my dd, she tries to say things, and we just can&#39;t <br/>
understand lots of them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; The unschoolers here won&#39;t be shy about telling their experiences with<br/>
&gt; waiting on speech therapy!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would love to hear what people have to say about this.  Right now, <br/>
we&#39;re in the process of getting therapy scheduled.  I feel like I might <br/>
as well give it a try, and can always discontinue if I feel it&#39;s not <br/>
working out or if she really hates it or whatever.<br/>

***She gets very frustrated when we can&#39;t understand what she is saying and<br/>
will end up having temper tantrums.  Her main problem is that she<br/>
understands everything, but she can&#39;t get her mouth to say what she is<br/>
thinking in a way that we can understand.  She just had her evaluation for<br/>
the preschool and she was at the extreme top of the chart for comprehension,<br/>
and barely made the bottom of the chart for expression.  If the difference<br/>
wasn&#39;t so dramatic and so obviously difficult for her, I wouldn&#39;t worry so<br/>
much about it. Her therapy consists of lots of floor play with beads and<br/>
sorting and such to develop fine motor skills.  They said that should help<br/>
her control her oral muscles better.  She really enjoys it and always asks<br/>
when Nina (Elaina, her therapist) is coming over.<br/>
<br/>

*** I found that when they watch channels that have lots of commercials<br/>
aimed at selling things to children, they get whiny and cranky.  Instead of<br/>
dealing with the horrible behavior, I just don&#39;t let them watch those<br/>
channels.  I don&#39;t want to create more reasons I have to say no.  Otherwise<br/>
I let them watch pretty much anything that I would watch.  Scary things<br/>
cannot be watched after supper for nightmare reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Be there with them! Help them learn how to deal with the edges in ways other<br/>
than stepping back and closing it off :-)<br/>
*** What exactly do you mean by this?<br/>
<br/>
What do you think of the idea of gradually working your way into unschooling<br/>
by starting opening up their world on weekends and vacations?  I don&#39;t think<br/>
I&#39;m confident enough to jump in head first yet, but then again, I don&#39;t have<br/>
to really make a decision until August 1.<br/>

I know, sounds pie in the sky!<br/>
<br/>
If you got cranky after reading your favorite author, would you want your<br/>
husband to take the book away and forbid you from reading any more of her<br/>
books?<br/>
<br/>
Or what if he brought you something to eat while you were reading and gave<br/>
you a kiss on the top of your head? What if he asked if you&#39;d like to take a<br/>
break and go for a walk with him? What if he asked you in between books what<br/>
you thought made you cranky and what he could do to help?<br/>
<br/>
How would you rather be treated?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Do they want to have nightmares?<br/>
<br/>
If we think in terms of being their partner and helping them get what they<br/>
want then we don&#39;t need so many rules and so many nos!<br/>
<br/>
You can say &quot;Remember when you guys watched The Mummy and you had<br/>
nightmares? Well this movie is like that. How about we tape it and we can<br/>
watch it in the morning when it&#39;s bright and sunny? And we can have popcorn<br/>
and talk about how maybe they created the special effects so it won&#39;t seem<br/>
so scary.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Won&#39;t work as beautifully :-)<br/>
<br/>
People will do what they&#39;ll do, but it&#39;s better when they do from a more<br/>
informed position.<br/>
<br/>
If your husband was nervous about you reading certain books, would you feel<br/>
more respected and free if he never let you read them or if he let you read<br/>
them just on weekends as he nervously fretted ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The more we control something, the more valuable it becomes. If we dole<br/>
something out in small bits then it becomes something to be desired and<br/>
looked forward to.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the effect you&#39;d like to achieve with TV?<br/>
<br/>
If something is plentiful then we can take it or leave it depending on<br/>
whether we want it at the moment or not. People with limitless water don&#39;t<br/>
hoard it ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If kids fear that if they leave the TV it won&#39;t go back on, they&#39;ll stay<br/>
glued to the TV. If they know they can turn it on whenever they want,<br/>
they&#39;ll only turn it on when they want.<br/>
<br/>
If kids have things that are better than TV -- books, hide and seek, games,<br/>
wresting matches with dad -- then they won&#39;t choose TV because it&#39;s the best<br/>
of a bad lot. They&#39;ll only choose TV when they really want it.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has always had free access to cable. She has gone through binges<br/>
but because TV is freely available, she doesn&#39;t feel the need to watch it.<br/>
She just watches it when she wants and hardly even that.<br/>

Right.  Promoted by schools.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I graduated from college and had a lot of debt and went to a job  that <br/>
paid me $6,800 the first year (teaching in a public school in  1974/75), people <br/>
who had dropped out were four or five or six years into a job,  sometimes a <br/>
state or federal job with a great retirement plan and wonderful  benefits.  <br/>
They had no loans to repay.  They owned cars and some had  already started buying <br/>

You could use it as an opportunity to discuss how advertising works.   You <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that might be confusing to the kids, depending on what kind <br/>
of changes you&#39;re talking about making. <br/>
<br/>
If you decided to stop controling tv, for example, on the weekends, <br/>
they would probably want to know why they can&#39;t watch anything they <br/>
want on other days, too.<br/>
<br/>
I would pick one area to relax on. If you keep reading about not <br/>
limiting tv and then try that, it will probably take up quite a bit <br/>
of your time as you sit down with the kids, see what they want to <br/>
watch, watch it with them, see what&#39;s coming on later and talk about <br/>
it with them. They might watch a lot in the beginning to test you and <br/>
see what it&#39;s like. <br/>
<br/>
Once you see how that goes and talk about it here, it might give you <br/>
the confidence to try other unschooling ideas. And you&#39;ll have the <br/>
experience of seeing how your kids react to less control, which may <br/>
come up again. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not clear, though, on what you mean by opening up their world. <br/>
How would that look, how would it be different from the way things <br/>
are now?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460374683">I think it might be easiest here to give an example of a typical weekday.<br/>
Moira and Lauren get up in the morning usually between 6 and 7 and come down<br/>
and turn on Noggin on TV (It&#39;s their favorite channel).  I get up around 7<br/>
and make breakfast and feed the family before Moira has to get on the bus at<br/>
8:20.  Lauren and Rowan continue watching TV until 10 or so, when my husband<br/>
says it is his turn for the TV.  Lauren and Rowan play as they wish in the<br/>
living room or upstairs in the bedrooms (rarely, but it does happen).<br/>
Noontime is lunch time, then Lauren goes down for her nap (and Rowan too, if<br/>
she hasn&#39;t already taken one).  Lauren usually wakes up between 2 and 3 and<br/>
has a snack then plays in the living room while my husband is still watching<br/>
TV.  At 4, Moira gets home from school, they have a snack and get the TV<br/>
again until 5 or 6.  They take turns between Noggin (for Lauren) and PBS<br/>
(for Moira).  Then they go upstairs to play until suppertime because they<br/>
are driving me bonkers by being loud and rambunctious.  After supper they<br/>
either loaf in the living room or go upstairs again to play or clean their<br/>
rooms or take a bath.  Then at 7:30 I put them to bed again.  On weekends,<br/>
the scenario is pretty much the same, excepting the going to school part.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize how drab our lives are until I started reading this list.<br/>
We went out and bought some new games and replaced Connect Four which they<br/>
played so much it broke.  Moira at age 5 can give my husband a run for his<br/>
money with that game.  :)  I have a folder in the bookmarks on our browser<br/>
that I am trying to fill with more interesting sites for them.  The TV<br/>
channel I have the hardest time with is Cartoon Network, with its endless<br/>
commercials for the latest Barbies and action figures and Tickle Me Elmos.<br/>
The kids see those commercials come on and beg and beg and beg me for them,<br/>
even after I say we can&#39;t get them because we don&#39;t have the money.<br/>
<br/>
Does this help explain where we are coming from?<br/>

You could say &quot;maybe for Christmas&quot; or &quot;maybe for your birthday&quot; and write  <br/>
them down on a list, and when the time&#39;s nearer, ask what they still  want. <br/>
 <br/>
If they&#39;re not bored and feeling needy, they will probably ask for fewer  <br/>
things.   <br/>
_http://sandradodd.com/spoiled_ (http://sandradodd.com/spoiled) <br/>
I&#39;m not recommending that because I think your kids are spoiled.  I  don&#39;t <br/>
like the concept &quot;spoiled,&quot; I&#39;m just thinking that there might be a level  of <br/>
irritation for you when the kids beg that you hadn&#39;t been considering.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058210033">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Then they go upstairs to play until suppertime because they<br/>
are driving me bonkers by being loud and rambunctious. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You may find they are less rambunctious if they have more chance to really<br/>
run and climb during the day. Jayn (5) finds various ways to get a lot of<br/>
physical activity in every day, including running around the pool of the<br/>
apartments, climbing on the exercise bike, dancing, yoga and sofa jumping,<br/>
on those days when we aren&#39;t getting to a park, dance class, or swimming<br/>
(summer). However the days when we do get out give her much more action and<br/>
physical release. The stuff she comes up with are a kind of stop gap<br/>
measure. In poor weather we go to indoor playgrounds sometimes, or malls, or<br/>
go puddle jumping. My dh and I were discussing recently that the area of<br/>
physical activities is our greatest lack, so that Jayn had to make up for<br/>
our inadequacy with her own devised games. It seems like she is modeling<br/>
being physically active for us instead of the other way around.<br/>
<br/>
In the archives you can read about our peculiar sleep pattern, in which our<br/>
schedule travels around the clock. I mention this because we have about 5 or<br/>
6 nights every five weeks where we are on a night shift. Jayn and I are<br/>
perforce isolated in the house with the additional need to be less physical<br/>
at night for noise reduction (2nd floor apartment). I know that she<br/>
sometimes has frustrations from the lack of big physical activities, and<br/>
when we first &quot;emerge&quot; on the other side of the schedule (getting up at 3AM)<br/>
Jayn will push herself to stay awake for a long day at the park to get lots<br/>
of extra sun and exercise. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The TV<br/>
channel I have the hardest time with is Cartoon Network, with its endless<br/>
commercials for the latest Barbies and action figures and Tickle Me<br/>
Elmos.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The Disney Channel, as compared to Toon Disney, has no ads for products<br/>
other than Disney DVD&#39;s, movie promos, other shows, and &quot;public service&quot;<br/>
segments that feature kids following their passions. Jayn loves them. I&#39;m<br/>
lucky because she also loves the Disney shows, and doesn&#39;t care for the<br/>
animation styles prevalent at Cartoon Network. Probably the only show on<br/>
that channel she tolerates is &quot;Powerpuff Girls&quot;, and she prefers the books.<br/>
