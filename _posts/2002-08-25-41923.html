<div id="ygrps-yiv-711341801">Dear pumpkin_kisses (sorry, I don&#39;t know your name),<br/>
<br/>
You wrote: &quot;Many young men of the underclass live lives where the gun-toting, <br/>
bitch smacking, misogynistic, racist, homophobic, and sociopathic ideals <br/>
expressed in rap music do nothing to improve their day to day existence. So, <br/>
perhaps gangsta rap is best enjoyed by those who don&#39;t have to personally <br/>
deal with the reality that fuels the lyrics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is brilliant and true. Indeed, when the safe and protected children of <br/>
anointed families spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year to <br/>
entertain themselves on the pornography that is rap music, clearly the <br/>
chickens have yet to come home to roost. But when white and wealthy Johnny <br/>
skips karate class or soccer and instead rapes the 12 year old girl down the <br/>
road, &quot;keepin&#39; it real&quot; like the &quot;homies&quot; he respects so much on his CD&#39;s, <br/>
then Mom and Dad will have to deal with the reality. But for now ... <br/>
<br/>
Here is Stanley Crouch: &quot;Snarling racial alienation is just one more item on <br/>
the adolescent shopping list. The suburban white kid in search of savages <br/>
noble and ignoble doesn&#39;t have to apply for a passport, put on a pith helmet, <br/>
get inoculations, purchase expensive plane tickets, hire a guide, buy <br/>
mosquito netting, and the rest of it. All he or she has to do is go to the <br/>
record shop or turn on cable television. The alienated white adolescent then <br/>
symbolically reaches down to pat the cap turned backwards on the head of the <br/>
black commodity that has expressed &#39;rock-n-roll anarchy&#39; to a fare-the-well. <br/>
Ivory and ebony, ebony and ivory. They have worked it out. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;In essence, the cable television executives and the record producers are no <br/>
different than the South American drug lords who reside in palaces and on <br/>
grounds that are paeans to overstatement while supplying the powders that <br/>
increase the desperation and speed the decay of the slums. These developments <br/>
are as harrowing as the biracial cooperation that was essential to the slave <br/>
trade. We observe the white captains of media industry profiting from the <br/>
marketing of the ethos of the black pirates of the streets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Crouch tells us that, &quot;[F]or the bulk of white rap fans, the surliest rap <br/>
recordings and videos [will] function as experiences somewhere between <br/>
viewing the natives boiling the middle class in a pot of profanity and the <br/>
thrill of gawking at a killer shark in an audio aquarium.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd interpreted what you wrote as if you were saying that you <br/>
consider a different sort of music ought to be &quot;imposed&quot; upon those living <br/>
rough lives. But hope that the gangsta rap music establishment -- and the <br/>
pathologies that fuel it -- might someday crumble, is no &quot;imposition&quot; of <br/>
whatever music might take its place. Moreover, the lifting up of norms and <br/>
standards of behavior and art is also no &quot;imposition.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Others at this list seem to see the refusal to allow such pornography into <br/>
one&#39;s home as an unacceptable form of censorship. (&quot;It may offend you, but <br/>
your child may see something different in it.&quot;) If rape, racism, misogyny, <br/>
drug use, and violent hatred are evils for everyone, everywhere, and at all <br/>
times, then those who are entertained by as much ought to be ashamed of <br/>
themselves. That the odd child may have a sociological attraction to such <br/>
things is something different altogether and also very rare.<br/>
<br/>
I saw nowhere in your post that you are &quot;refusing to listen to expressions of <br/>
frustration&quot; found in your community. But Sandra Dodd saw it, and reminds us <br/>
that &quot;refusing to listen to expressions of frustration doesn&#39;t lessen the <br/>
frustration.&quot; Has it crossed her mind that refusing to listen may take the <br/>
profit out of the frustration, and convince a generation of *human beings* <br/>
that it&#39;s high time they aspired to behave as such? That the &quot;underclass&quot; <br/>
with its sociopaths have become museum pieces for more enlightened <br/>
homeschoolers to study doesn&#39;t lessen the imperative.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd asked, &quot;Would there be less violence without the accompanying <br/>
music?&quot; It&#39;s a good question, but one that doesn&#39;t demand a cut and dry <br/>
answer in order for change to happen.  Whether or not the lifestyle or the <br/>
music ought to go first is beside the point. They both fuel each other, and <br/>
for those suffering from the exploitation, it matters not which part first <br/>
shuts down, but only that it ends.<br/>
<br/>
The gangsta culture is just that -- a culture, with its own art, rules, <br/>
taboos, goals, norms, and visions. Consider the place that rap music <br/>
currently holds in our society, and then ask yourself if the gangsta life <br/>
hasn&#39;t been an astronomical success, for both its protagonists and their <br/>
chroniclers? Change will not come from within.<br/>
<br/>
There is a simple answer, though it requires that we slip out from under the <br/>
comfortable liberal and relativistic vision, and face truth. Again, Stanley <br/>
Crouch: &quot;What must be done is rather obvious. The values of civilized <br/>
behavior must be reestablished and defined as fundamental beyond race. No one <br/>
in this society should be encouraged to believe that excellence, mastery of <br/>
our national language, tasteful dress, reliability, or any of the virtues <br/>
that bring vitality to a society are the sole province of the white <br/>
population.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If my post is offensive, or insulting, so be it. Rap culture and its <br/>
apologists are every bit as offensive. <br/>

 <br/>
And much of what people have done, in the name of culture or education or civilization or religion, has been violent and offensive, too. Which is not giving a blanket okay to gangsta rap, pornography, you name it. I am just recognising that there always seems to be this violence and frustration. There are many things, I am sure,  that can be/should be considered in order to address this. But I am looking just at my own home and family atm. So, what works for us, is to expose the children to beauty, without censoring the bad or censuring their tastes..Leonie<br/>

<br/>
What is offensive about the rap culture (or the thrash metal culture, etc.) <br/>
is not the bad language, or the violence. It is that it is a cowardly <br/>
retreat, a failure of morale, an unwillingness to face head on the <br/>
shortcomings of human nature. You don&#39;t abuse and leave your &quot;bitch&quot; because <br/>
she&#39;s not living up to your expectations, or because she caught the eye of <br/>
someone else. You don&#39;t cower into a self-indulgent ghetto because &quot;the man&quot; <br/>
isn&#39;t fair, or your parents messed you up. You take your tragedy and you work <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Have we learned nothing from Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Ralph Ellison, <br/>
Dorothy Dandrich? These folks faced the evil head on, engaged it, and shot <br/>
for something higher. But such an undertaking requires that one believe in <br/>
&quot;higher,&quot; or &quot;better.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Always playing the victim, and supporting and encouraging the victim, is <br/>
cowardly, and un-American.<br/>

You named me by full name three times in your commentary.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to shame me by full name, my middle name is &quot;Lynn,&quot; so you can, <br/>
if you wish, say &quot;Sandra Lynn Dodd, you should be ashamed of yourself.&quot;  Like <br/>
my mom used to.  If that will make you feel better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-when the safe and protected children of <br/>

chickens have yet to come home to roost. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Guess how many rap albums reside in my house?<br/>
None.<br/>
There are a few parodies on a South Park CD we have, and one on an Weird Al.  <br/>
The boys have seen videos on TV.    Music shows, movie soundtracks...<br/>
<br/>
So using my name three times doesn&#39;t change any facts in MY life.<br/>
<br/>
If you said the Rio Grande should be dammed up so there would have been no <br/>
drought in New Mexico, would you have gotten angry if I had suggested that <br/>
the Rio Grande cannot BE dammed up and that if we tried we&#39;d only flood <br/>
thousands of homes and the river would still continue its way toward the Gulf <br/>
of Mexico?  It&#39;s a heck of a slope from the mountains on top of the Colorado <br/>
Plateau to sea level.<br/>
<br/>
ESPECIALLY in America, you nor you and the president&#39;s army can stop freedom <br/>
of expression, and that includes musical expression.<br/>
<br/>
Saying rap music shouldn&#39;t exist is like saying scabs shouldn&#39;t exist.  They <br/>
do.  If you want to stop the scab, try to prevent the original wounds.  <br/>
<br/>
But trying to prevent wounds in the sense of trying to prevent all urban <br/>
realities is trying to dam up the Rio Grande.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In which generation was this not true?  Have you ever seen &quot;The Wild Ones&quot;?<br/>
&quot;Easy Rider&quot;?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Are you suggesting that jazz used to be clean and uplifting?  That <br/>
early-20th-century American blues wasn&#39;t about sex and drugs and shooting <br/>
them that done you wrong? <br/>
<br/>
Are you suggesting that there are no African-Americans involved in &quot;normal&quot; <br/>
fiction or theatre or mainstream music, but that they&#39;re all doing rap?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see what your list has to do with a form of music which has been <br/>
around on the radio and other mainstream venues for over twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Always playing the victim, and supporting and encouraging the victim, is <br/>

<br/>
This will seem a change of subject,  but it isn&#39;t at all.  Kathy Ward, one of <br/>
the presenters of the workshop on video gaming, came across and shared with <br/>
us an article on violence in comic books and other media kids like, and to <br/>
help you with your problem of characterizing swaths of young people as <br/>
&quot;un-American,&quot; I think it&#39;s worth reading.<br/>

To use my name THREE TIMES in your tirade is about like blaming me for it <br/>
being summertime.  Life goes on, and you can&#39;t stop life, the Rio Grande or <br/>
rap music.  You don&#39;t have to buy any.  I never have.   <br/>

I&#39;m thinking perhaps this is about me.<br/>
<br/>
Actually I&#39;m not bad as a musicologist.  I&#39;ve been really interested in <br/>
traditional music and in different forms since I was little.  Nine&#39;s the <br/>
first I remember, but I really started collecting stuff and researching it <br/>
the summer I turned fifteen.<br/>
<br/>
How are you with realizing there are some things you can&#39;t change?  I guess <br/>
that would be being a realist.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt;Life goes on and you can&#39;t stop life<br/>
&lt;&lt;You call that living?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think what humans do is life.  Trying to stop them is futile.<br/>
Trying to shame others who defend them doesn&#39;t really hurt the authors or <br/>
speakers or musicians.  It doesn&#39;t hurt those who made the observations that <br/>
this music is neither new nor preventable.<br/>
<br/>
What it does hurt, when one says something nonsensical or gratuitiously <br/>
insulting, is the reputation of that writer, or speaker.<br/>
<br/>
Are you aware that Eminem isn&#39;t Black?  In some sort of parallel or example, <br/>
you named four Black artists of decades past.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it wasn&#39;t about him, although it did have his name in the subject line.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;White America,&quot; the first song on the album, is a satirical look at why <br/>
he&#39;s seen as the Big Bad Wolf with a mic. &quot;Hip-hop is never a problem in <br/>
Harlem, only in Boston,&quot; he says. Em concedes that if he were African <br/>
American, maybe people wouldn&#39;t be as fascinated with him and that his record <br/>
sales would probably be cut in half. -=-<br/>

<br/>
The word is &quot;cite,&quot; and the entire tone of your post was that it should be <br/>
preventable, stopped, not bought.  When you talked about it being unAmerican, <br/>
maybe you didn&#39;t mean against freedom of expression.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where did I do that? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Guess how many rap albums reside in my house?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t talking about you. But I&#39;m glad you don&#39;t have any. [Hint:<br/>
because <br/>
your name comes up a few times in a post, doesn&#39;t mean the post is about<br/>
you. <br/>
You&#39;re not that important.] <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Neither you nor the President ... can stop freedom of expression.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What gave you the impression I want to do such a thing (I&#39;m serious --<br/>
site <br/>
the places where I said as much)?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;By trying to prevent ... all urban realities, is like trying to dam up<br/>

Again, where did I say anything about trying to prevent all urban<br/>
realities?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are you suggesting that jazz used to be clean and uplifting?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all. That Bessie Smith sang crude songs on occasion doesn&#39;t<br/>
invalidate <br/>
my argument -- and she would be the first to agree with me. I asked<br/>
about the <br/>
lessons learned, as an example, from four specific artists. You<br/>
completely <br/>
missed my point. <br/>
<br/>
de Sade wrote about brothers and sisters having anal sex with each<br/>
other. <br/>
Shall I no longer argue against such a thing? Shall I no longer<br/>
encourage and <br/>
support those who aspire to something greater in life and art, and who<br/>
are <br/>
attempting to reintroduce humane norms and standards back into American <br/>
culture? <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re quite a musicologist aren&#39;t you? My post has everything to do<br/>
with it. <br/>
Did you not read it? Is there a twenty year statute of limitations on <br/>
perversion and sociopathy in art?<br/>

This wasn&#39;t addressed to you as if I disagreed with what you were saying, nor <br/>
was anything in that reply posted with you in mind. I appreciated what you <br/>
were getting at. Also, by &quot;support and encouraging the victim,&quot; I meant <br/>
monetarily -- buying their products. I meant nothing about not giving moral <br/>
support and encouragement to victims, as well we should.<br/>

I understand, Bob. Its just that there are things I  wouldn&#39;t support with my money but my older kids do - kwim? This causes a lot of discussion in our house. Its their choice how they spend their money... On a related topic, not rap :-) , the younger boys, too, want to buy things that I feel are pure commercialism.  We talk about this.Yet, I buy the stuff for them, or they buy it with their money, - all the while  I know my money is going to support some companies with which I disagree, but knowing that the stuff often is part of a good experience for  the boys..Leonie<br/>
