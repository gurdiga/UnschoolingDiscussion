<div id="ygrps-yiv-954246129">Thanks Laura,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to examine all the options.  My main concern is how to deal with<br/>
inlaws, friends and other curious people who all seem to need answers.  As I said,<br/>
my girls are 13 and 15, and I&#39;m starting to feel the pressure.<br/>
<br/>
The way it looks, our only options are public school (NOT), correspondence(WAY to<br/>
much paperwork--I could go on and on about this one), and GED, or-- nothing.<br/>
<br/>
 Did you do anything special to prepare your boys for the GED?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838110890">Hi Helen,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 11, and we are in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I plan <br/>
to allow her to pursue her interests (by unschooling) through her teen <br/>
years. If she decides on a career direction that requires university <br/>
training, then the high school Grade 11 and 12 subjects are available by <br/>
correspondence in a few learning centres in this city, so she would have <br/>
support from teachers as well. Otherwise, she may find a niche in<br/>
work that doesn&#39;t require a diploma. In British Columbia, any adult may <br/>
attend Community College Programs, many of which are career-driven.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194439028">I have two teens - a 13 yob and a 19 yog.  My daughter is now in <br/>
college.  When she started homeschooling,  we knew nothing about <br/>
unschooling.  She ended up getting a diploma from American School - <br/>
very dry - very traditional - but she only spent an hour or two a day <br/>
on it.  My 13 yob has unschooled since he was 10 and isn&#39;t interested <br/>
in the correspondence route.  He does plan  to go to college.  We <br/>
haven&#39;t decided yet whether to just create our own transcript and <br/>
diploma or whether to use an unschooling friendly cover school to get <br/>
a diploma.  Either way,  we&#39;ll continue unschooling and &quot;make it <br/>
fit.&quot;  I&#39;ve recently purchased two books to help - <br/>
<br/>
And What About College?  by Cafi Cohen - an eclectic homeschooler <br/>
whose kids got diplomas from American School,  but most of their <br/>
education elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
From Homeschool to College and Work,  by Alison McKee  -an unschooler<br/>

Both books explain a lot about how to put together transcripts, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250197925">Hello Jael,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re on Vancouver Island, as you may have guessed.   The correspondence route<br/>
would be our last resort.  I say this only because I&#39;m aware of the HUGE<br/>
workload associated with all of the courses.  I know so many people whose kids<br/>
don&#39;t have a life because all they do is work on papers, and many don&#39;t get<br/>
summer holidays when the rest of their peers are off enjoying themselves during<br/>
the summer.  If my kids choose to go this route, I would certainly support them,<br/>
but I would hate to see them have to do it just to get a diploma.  At the<br/>
moment, I&#39;m considering the GED our best option, or as you said, finding work<br/>
where a diploma isn&#39;t required.  I&#39;m actually hoping they&#39;ll learn to create<br/>
their own employment, working with computers, sales, service, or such.(My<br/>
husband has a home business selling and servicing computers, so they are quite<br/>
knowledgable in this area.)<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s really bothering me lately is deciding how to respond, when people ask me<br/>
how my girls will get their diplomas.  The truth is, they may not get one, but<br/>
this response leaves people with a blank expression.  And, sooner or later we<br/>
have to face the moment of truth, when the inlaws will want some answers.  Are<br/>
any of you out there struggling with this?<br/>

    Although my boys left high school to Ged it is still a dilemma when <br/>
people ask about school. The 17 yro would not have grad. until next yr. I&#39;ve <br/>
considered just saying he graduated early to avoid the sad looks people give <br/>
me. My boys were sick of school and I was sick of dealing with the school. So <br/>
we&#39;re very happy it&#39;s over for them.<br/>
    Make your own diploma and develop a transcript to show them. If they <br/>
didn&#39;t except you hsing not much else will impress them. Time will be the <br/>
biggest factor in<br/>
proving your children&#39;s success. Of course one mans success is another&#39;s <br/>
failure.<br/>
I would suggest you find people who validate you so you can feel good about <br/>
whatever you decide.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have high school diplomas (I&#39;m in New Zealand), but do have other things,<br/>
so I have often faced this question. My oldest is 18, joined the work force a year<br/>
ago. People still ask how I managed to get him his &#39;qualifictions&#39;, and look aghast<br/>
when I say we didn&#39;t bother because he didn&#39;t need them! He is working for a<br/>
beekeeper and learning that way. Of course with three more sons coming along (16,<br/>
12, 9) I&#39;m going to face that question for a lot  longer!<br/>
<br/>
What I try to do, nicely, is to try to get them to answer for themselves. First, I<br/>
ask them in what circumstances my child would need such a thing. Which brings to<br/>
their notice, often for the first time I think, that you don&#39;t need these bits of<br/>
paper to breathe, eat or even work. The we examine alternatives to the ones that<br/>
supposedly need them - and I haven&#39;t found much that doesn&#39;t have an alternative.<br/>
Then, finally, we get on to how you can get the bits of paper if  you really really<br/>
want / need them. (correspondence schools, community classes......)<br/>
<br/>
Usually, with a bit of guidance they end up seeing things in a new light, and<br/>
answering their own questions.<br/>

Thanks for taking time to respond.  You&#39;ve given me some things to think about.<br/>

&gt; Helen,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; you asked:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; What&#39;s really bothering me lately is deciding how to respond, when people ask me<br/>
&gt; &gt; how my girls will get their diplomas.  The truth is, they may not get one, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; this response leaves people with a blank expression.  And, sooner or later we<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to face the moment of truth, when the inlaws will want some answers.  Are<br/>
&gt; &gt; any of you out there struggling with this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t have high school diplomas (I&#39;m in New Zealand), but do have other things,<br/>
&gt; so I have often faced this question. My oldest is 18, joined the work force a year<br/>
&gt; ago. People still ask how I managed to get him his &#39;qualifictions&#39;, and look aghast<br/>
&gt; when I say we didn&#39;t bother because he didn&#39;t need them! He is working for a<br/>
&gt; beekeeper and learning that way. Of course with three more sons coming along (16,<br/>
&gt; 12, 9) I&#39;m going to face that question for a lot  longer!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I try to do, nicely, is to try to get them to answer for themselves. First, I<br/>
&gt; ask them in what circumstances my child would need such a thing. Which brings to<br/>
&gt; their notice, often for the first time I think, that you don&#39;t need these bits of<br/>
&gt; paper to breathe, eat or even work. The we examine alternatives to the ones that<br/>
&gt; supposedly need them - and I haven&#39;t found much that doesn&#39;t have an alternative.<br/>
&gt; Then, finally, we get on to how you can get the bits of paper if  you really really<br/>
&gt; want / need them. (correspondence schools, community classes......)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Usually, with a bit of guidance they end up seeing things in a new light, and<br/>
&gt; answering their own questions.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been here all along, reading and.....um....well, reading LOL  I must <br/>
belong to every list and newsletter on the internet (except for the fact that <br/>
I&#39;m always coming upon new ones that pique my interest) and the email keeps <br/>
pouring in!  That, and the fact that we just never seem to stop around here, <br/>
keeps us going and going and going!  <br/>
<br/>
And, anyway, there are so many wise and wonderful people on this list, I just <br/>
read and learn with awe :) <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Elissa, for the warm greeting - and if I can help anyone with <br/>
anything else, just yell - I&#39;m right here!<br/>
<br/>

i think this (your words above) would be a good answer for questions about <br/>
your choices with your boys!  :)  wouldn&#39;t get sad looks anyway!<br/>

&lt;&lt; The way it looks, our only options are public school (NOT), <br/>

 much paperwork--I could go on and on about this one), and GED, or-- nothing.<br/>

  Did you do anything special to prepare your boys for the GED?<br/>

    I think that some states allow your own diploma.  I know that ours does, <br/>
and that is what I am planning.  We unschool, so we don&#39;t have records or <br/>
grades, but I will make my own diploma (even have it notarized) to go with <br/>
his &quot;graduating&quot; our homeschool.  He can honestly say that &quot;yes, he has <br/>
graduated highschool and has his diploma&quot; when applying for a job.  If he <br/>
decides to go to college, he and I will sit down and make up a transcript of <br/>
the things that he did for school.  This has worked for others in this area, <br/>
and I haven&#39;t seen any problems from it.  Hope this gives you another <br/>
alternative.  :-)<br/>

    Many people still don&#39;t get it. I get tired of explaining what problems <br/>
were with school. School is such a different place than it was even a few <br/>
years ago. Others refuse to see what I;m saying so I figure the less said the <br/>
