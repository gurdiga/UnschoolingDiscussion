<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071347496"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;My &quot;wonder years&quot; come at seven. Both are cooking. I&#39;m almost superfluous.<br/>
&gt;~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I actually get into trouble with my seven year old because I get to thinking<br/>
I am superfluous and then get annoyed when he wants me to do something for<br/>
him just because I&#39;m the mom.  It&#39;s not that I mind doing something he can<br/>
do just as well himself, but I have to remember--Little Kid!!!  -smile-<br/>
<br/>
What is a big make or breaker for me is spoken language.  By about 4 they<br/>
are clearly speaking and functional linguistically.  At least enough for the<br/>
day to day crap.  No more &quot;Mama, Mama&quot; accompanied with eager pointing and<br/>
much disappointment if I don&#39;t get it.  It&#39;s so frustrating for everyone.<br/>
Also they understand the concept of &quot;later&quot; and &quot;maybe&quot; at least as well as<br/>
any adult.  (Ie, not so well!  -grin-)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t even imagine them all at 7 and older.  That would be 7, 9<br/>
and -gasp-14.  James at 14.  YIKES!!!  Then I really WILL be superfluous.<br/>
