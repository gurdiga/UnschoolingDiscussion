<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934419787">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley wanted me to post an update for her.<br/>
<br/>
I finally talked with her on IM today.  She had her natural delivery <br/>
on the 9th,  but things didn&#39;t go well.   Baby wasn&#39;t breathing <br/>
after the delivery and Shyrley lost lots of blood.  :(<br/>
<br/>
They were both rushed to the hospital.   Shyrley ended up with some <br/>
infections, but got to come home this afternoon.   Baby, Celyn, <br/>
isn&#39;t doing as well.  She has brain damage.  :(   She is breathing <br/>
on her on now,  but they think she possibly has Cerebral Palsy.<br/>
<br/>
So,  keep Shyrley and her baby in your thoughts.  If anyone wants <br/>
more info,  you can e-mail me off list.<br/>
<br/>
Kelli~</div>
