<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006856132">I&#39;m having one of those moments.    I&#39;m missing those days of homeSCHOOLING. <br/>
  I miss the schedule of it all.  Knowing what the majority of my day will <br/>
be like.  Playing &#39;teacher&#39; and making lesson plans.  For some reason, I got <br/>
a lot of *oomph* out of that.  Some feeling that I was &#39;doing the right <br/>
thing&#39; or something.  I can&#39;t really verbalize it.  I think I&#39;m even <br/>
overexaggerating.<br/>
<br/>
Our van has been down for a looong time.  It won&#39;t be ready for at least two <br/>
more weeks, so we are very house-bound.  We are antsy.  Full of cabin fever. <br/>
  Needing to get out.  It&#39;s hot and humid.  Dang humid.  We have some <br/>
atmospheric smoke thing going on and two of the kids have asthma, which has <br/>
been terrible this week, so even getting outside has been near impossible.  <br/>
As a result, my kids are doing things they normally wouldn&#39;t dream of doing. <br/>
  Getting into the fridge and spilling an entire gallon of milk on the <br/>
floor.  Pulling all the books and videos off the shelves.  Ethan figured out <br/>
how to unlock the door today and ran next door to my great grandparents <br/>
house!  I was sitting in the living room nursing Chloe.  Didn&#39;t even hear <br/>
the door open.  It was terrifying.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s just stress, really.  My husband has been gone for weeks and <br/>
won&#39;t be home until next weekend.  I lost $300 in my house, somehow, and <br/>
can&#39;t find it anywhere.  I even dug through the trash, which had been at the <br/>
curb for at least two days.  It was full of maggots.  I stupidly made RICE <br/>
for dinner and when I sat down to eat, I immediatly envisioned a plate full <br/>
of maggots and felt an instant wave of nausea and ran for the bathroom.  <br/>
What was I thinking???<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t shake this feeling that if I were playing school, that my days <br/>
would have a lot more structure and the kids would be more occupied, <br/>
deterred from getting into everything but the attic, which they&#39;d probably <br/>
do right now if the string hadn&#39;t been stuck inside last time we opened it.  <br/>
LOL<br/>
<br/>
Ok, so tell me I&#39;m being dumb.  Tell me this too shall pass.  Give me some <br/>
wonderful bit of wisdom to carry me through the next two weeks before I go <br/>
curriculum hunting in my garage!  I *know* you can do it! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

Can you play happy music, make scavenger hunt lists for the kids <br/>
(co-operative hunt, and put down there &quot;cash&quot; as a thing to find--you could <br/>
draw pictures), and really clean out your kitchen cabinets?  Maybe organizing <br/>
spices and plastic lids would keep you from wanting to teach a lesson on <br/>
helping verbs.<br/>
<br/>
Did you use the money for a bookmark?<br/>
Is it stuck in the watch pocket of some pants you left under your bed?<br/>
Under your bed randomly otherwise?<br/>
<br/>
How could a curriculum REALLY help anything?  Adding unhappy kids and a <br/>
more-guilty mom to your existing circus of confusion can&#39;t be right.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks. :)  It isn&#39;t right, I *know* that.  I think it&#39;s just the believing <br/>
part that&#39;s eating at me.  I like that.  Circus of confusion.  LOL  It&#39;s <br/>
like I&#39;m having some strange sort of out of body experience. ;)  I&#39;m in some <br/>
dream world, watching myself sitting at the kitchen table with my June <br/>
Cleaver apron on, teaching my perfect, smiling children some perfect, <br/>
smiling lesson and inside I&#39;m screaming for her to wake up, wake up!  This <br/>
isn&#39;t really happening!  That show ended eons ago.  It was a SHOW!!  OH, OH! <br/>
  That commercial!  Jane, Michael, breakfast!  Thank you mother dear.  <br/>
Switch to reality.  Michael runs in in his cape and Jane grabs some instant <br/>
breakfast while rushing out the front door...<br/>
<br/>
Oh good lord, I&#39;d better shut up.  Forgive me, it&#39;s 4 in the morning.  I <br/>
don&#39;t always work right at 4 in the morning.  I should go back to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow (today) is a new day!  The circus doesn&#39;t last forever!  I hope I&#39;m <br/>
not the only one who has odd moments like this.  Or maybe it&#39;s better if I <br/>
am. &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s been a rough week....<br/>

I wish I could help. Is van in the shop? My dh is a mechanic, is there <br/>
something he may be able to diagnose?<br/>
As for the funds I hear ya when I loose money I find it when I dont need it <br/>
as much.<br/>
Curriculum isn&#39;t going to fix cabin fever. It may actually be an even worse <br/>
time to break it out. <br/>
Can you all watch movies, snuggle up, cook, play games? When we get loads of <br/>
snow here I get the same way but then another day comes along and looks <br/>
better. I would say just be sure and have some you time and breath...<br/>

I know where you&#39;re coming from right now.  We&#39;re stuck inside <br/>
because of weather, it&#39;s completely humid but the air conditioner is <br/>
making this horrible rattling sound so it&#39;s either sit here sweating <br/>
or listen to *that sound* that I swear is driving my blood pressure <br/>
up.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids are on completely different sleep cycles and they both want <br/>
to be with me, which means I&#39;m up around the clock.  And my husband <br/>
has been gone all week and won&#39;t be home for at least another week, <br/>
maybe longer.  <br/>
<br/>
So if my posts have seemed a bit inconsistent and I seem to be losing <br/>
my mind, it&#39;s because I AM losing my mind.  And I&#39;ve been daydreaming <br/>
about curriculum because some part of me thinks this whole thing <br/>
would be easier if the kids got up at seven in the morning, did some <br/>
chores, sat down at the table and quietly worked for a few hours, and <br/>
went to bed at like eight or something (yeah right!  Reality check: <br/>
they&#39;re two and five!).  <br/>
<br/>
I even joined Flylady again for crying out loud.  Flylady annoys the <br/>
heck out of me, but I needed a little bit of order in my life right <br/>
now.  I rearranged furniture all day yesterday and cleaned out two <br/>
closets.  I&#39;m working on cleaning out the walk-in closet today.  I <br/>
know when my husband is home and/or the weather clears up, things <br/>
will be easier.  I know part of their behavior this week has been <br/>
missing their dad and the other part has been being trapped indoors.  <br/>
But I am seriously losing my mind here.  So I&#39;m not much help, but <br/>
I&#39;m in a parallel place.<br/>

7 children and a curriculum...........I am sorry...can&#39;t type <br/>
more..........laughing too hard ;)<br/>
<br/>
If you could coordinate that and LOWER your stress level we will all <br/>
support you on your campaign to run in the presidency next election.  <br/>
Relax, because your kids are being kids.  I have two, and that little <br/>
one...grrrr...he keeps me on my toes and no amount of curriculum will <br/>

Okay Jennifer, ::STEP AWAY FROM THE CURRICULUM!:: That&#39;s it. Nice and <br/>
easy and no one gets hurt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the unschooling, sweetie, it&#39;s the circumstances. You&#39;re <br/>
having a rough patch. You&#39;re out of sync. The universe is telling you <br/>
something, but it&#39;s not to sit your kids down and force feed them <br/>
some spelling words. Try to remove the whole schooling thing from the <br/>
picture and see if you can figure out what the the message might be.<br/>
<br/>
Are there places in your life that might need more attention? Do you <br/>
need to slow down? Focus more? Take care of yourself a little? Forget <br/>
about school. What&#39;s going on in your life?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re feeling the need for more structure, than maybe write up a <br/>
schedule for movie watching, park outings and lego time. Get some new <br/>
books from the library and set aside a time to look at them with the <br/>
kids. Make the gooey slime recipe that someone posted and play around <br/>
with chemistry. Pull out the cards and board games and play, think, <br/>
learn. <br/>
<br/>
This too shall pass.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

posts and I&#39;m picturing you like Ren (as in Ren & Stimpy) getting Space<br/>
Madness talking to the bar of soap like it&#39;s an ice cream sandwich.  LOL<br/>
Snap out of it, Woman!  hee hee&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I could just hug yer neck right now! &lt;bwg&gt;  Thank you. :)  I&#39;m trying <br/>
desperately to hang on to my humor so I don&#39;t completely lose it.  (I&#39;m <br/>
actually hearing Ren&#39;s voice while I write this!)  I have space madness!  <br/>
I&#39;m stuck in this space and I can&#39;t get out!  ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
Normally, it wouldn&#39;t be this bad, but my great grandparents were BOTH in <br/>
the hospital all week and I&#39;m facing two facts here.  One, they won&#39;t live <br/>
forever.  How does a person live this long without figuring that out?  It&#39;s <br/>
really tearing me up.  Two, we have to move and I won&#39;t be right next door <br/>
to them anymore.  I love being *right there*.  I mow their yard, clean their <br/>
house, take out their trash, make sure they take their meds.  I like knowing <br/>
that while I&#39;m here, they can still have the most independant life possible. <br/>
  Now that we are moving, my family is talking about hiring someone to come <br/>
in.  I know I can still help even when we move, but it&#39;s not the same as <br/>
being here, in this house, right next door.  Reality is slamming me in the <br/>
head and I just don&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
Just too much crap to deal with all in one week.  I feel much better today, <br/>
though.  I&#39;m going to clean my house, top to bottom and get ready to start <br/>
packing.  At least that will keep me busy and give me a good excuse to NOT <br/>
push my silly desires of teaching onto my kids.  Well, I may teach them some <br/>
organizational skills and packing abilities. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks, you and Sandra made me feel MUCH better.  That means a lot!  <br/>
It really gave me the oobie goobies (our slang for butterfly lovie feelings) <br/>
to hear you call me Jen.  I haven&#39;t heard anyone do that since my brother <br/>
died.  Good memories. :)<br/>
<br/>

Yup.  My husband refuses to pay to have everything fixed by them, so they <br/>
are doing half the load and he&#39;ll finish the rest when he gets home.  (I <br/>
have a conversion van and they charge an arm and a leg to do engine work <br/>

It does help!  It&#39;s nice to know I don&#39;t have to be *perfect* all the time! <br/>
&lt;bg&gt;  I know, it DOES *sound* easier on days like this.  I have the same <br/>
problem.  My kids are in a huge funk right now with their sleeping habits, <br/>
too.  I was a big stickler on that with at least my younger five, but I <br/>
really let go once I started feeling sorry for myself.   They are falling <br/>
asleep in the late afternoon and staying up very late.  I woke everyone up <br/>
early (earliER anyway) this morning and I&#39;m putting them down for a nap when <br/>
they finish watching cartoons.  Hopefully, just getting my little ones back <br/>
on a reasonable schedule will make a huge difference.  It always does.  <br/>
Haleigh and Nic keep their own schedules, but they are older and don&#39;t need <br/>
&#39;babysitting&#39; as much.  In other words...I trust that they won&#39;t dump the <br/>
contents of the fridge if I&#39;m not awake!<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there.  We&#39;ve only got a week left (hopefully here, too..we&#39;re never <br/>
exactly sure) and hubby will be home and life will be a little easier, <br/>
right?  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027774797">&lt;&lt;nd if you did break out the curriculum you would just have to pack it away<br/>
because it is summer vacation.  So I guess you could do &quot;school&quot; for the <br/>
next<br/>
three months and your children would never know.  LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840146100">LOL!  Okay, I&#39;m going to share a little of my mean, sadistic side here. ;)<br/>
<br/>
When we are out in public and I get those idiots who say, Are they ALL <br/>
YOURS??!?!?!?!, then they say, I bet you homeschool, too, huh?  and laugh <br/>
like it&#39;s some big joke.  I just suck it up and tell them, yes we do <br/>
homeschool.  (No mention of unschooling for these nincompoops.)  Then they <br/>
ask me if we use some curriculum, like Konos or something, I guess, that <br/>
they can all do together.  I say no, I tailor everything to each of my <br/>
children.  &quot;You mean you use SEVEN DIFFERENT things for each child???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OK, first of all, they are sitting right in front of me.  Six of my children <br/>
are six and UNDER so it would SEEM pretty obvious that most of them don&#39;t <br/>
need schoolwork, even to the MOST schoolish, right??<br/>
<br/>
So anyway.  I just keep up the dramatic frenzy and say &quot;Yes!  They are all <br/>
working on different things at the same time!&quot;  Then they start oohing and <br/>
aahing because I am &quot;superwoman&quot;, &#39;amazing&quot;, &quot;a better mother&quot; than *they* <br/>
are.  Mwahahaha!<br/>
<br/>
I use those moments for big ego power trips.  &lt;beg&gt;  I mean, hey, I wasn&#39;t <br/>
lying, righ??  Sometimes, I just love idiot remarks!<br/>
<br/>

7 children and a curriculum...........I am sorry...can&#39;t type<br/>
more..........laughing too hard ;)<br/>
<br/>
If you could coordinate that and LOWER your stress level we will all<br/>
support you on your campaign to run in the presidency next election.<br/>
Relax, because your kids are being kids.  I have two, and that little<br/>
one...grrrr...he keeps me on my toes and no amount of curriculum will<br/>
change him :)<br/>

just curious, but how old are your little ones?  I used to want 6 and <br/>
I have gone down to 3, although dh still wants 4 which is most likely <br/>
where we will end up.  <br/>

Oh lordy!  It would be much more simple and sweet to tell you what ISN&#39;T <br/>
going on! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Guess what I did??  I put my old curriculum boxes in my grandparents car for <br/>
their next trip to Good Will!  I bet there&#39;s thousands of dollars out there, <br/>
but I can&#39;t be tempted in my dumb moments.  My husband is a little miffed <br/>
with me about it, but WOW!!!  It felt really GOOD!  And at least I know <br/>
someone who chooses that route but doesn&#39;t have a lot of funds will get some <br/>
help.<br/>

Good idea. You could also list them for sale on eBay. I sold an old <br/>
Math-U-See curriculum and got back most of my money. (Of course it <br/>
was practically brand new!!)<br/>

some cool computer games, or new toys, or clothes, of fix your van, or <br/>
SOMETHING and you&#39;ll be helping out other homeschoolers much more by listing <br/>
them this way.  I would never think of getting homeschool books at the <br/>
Goodwill, and they may go to waste there.  If anything, contact your local <br/>
homeschool group and donate or sell them there.  <br/>
