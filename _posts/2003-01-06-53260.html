<div id="ygrps-yiv-315890848">Home Ed. Mag.  has often had several unschooling articles in it and of course, Sandra&#39;s column, which is a must read&lt;plug&gt;,   <br/>

But I would also like to know if there are other publications,  I also receive Life Learning and have enjoyed it.<br/>

an unschooling magazine than anything else. Almost all of our <br/>
columnists are unschoolers, the vast majority of our writers write <br/>
from an unschooling perspective, both our articles editor and our <br/>
columns editor are unschoolers from way back, and the publishers are <br/>
certainly dyed-in-the-wool second generation unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We recognize that some of our readers prefer a more structured <br/>
approach to education, so we do run articles for that perspective <br/>
from time to time, but I wish I had a nickel for every subscription <br/>
cancellation sent with the notation &quot;HEM is just an unschooling <br/>
magazine and we&#39;re looking for something different.&quot;<br/>

so surprised at who wants to come and be a vendor!!!! I write back explaining <br/>
that I&#39;d love to sell them space. But I make sure they understand that is is <br/>
an UNschooling conference and suggest that they check out unschooling.com <br/>

Welcome back!! It&#39;s great to &quot;see&quot; you!<br/>
I think the reason I don&#39;t think of it as an unschooling mag, is simply <br/>
because of the advertising. Of course, it would be difficult to pull in ad <br/>
revenue as a strictly unschooling mag, LOL<br/>
The articles definately are unschooling oriented. I think of it as relaxed <br/>
eclectic magazine.<br/>
PS, It is my favorite!<br/>

I didn&#39;t see it as an unschooling mag because I started off reading Growing <br/>
Without Schooling.<br/>
<br/>
And even now, I&#39;m afraid if it&#39;s outed as an unschooling magazine, they won&#39;t <br/>
need an unschooling columnist anymore!  <br/>
<br/>
Come on, HEM is really mainstream.  Very inclusive.  Unschooling is mostly in <br/>
my column and a an article or two or four each month.<br/>
