<br/>
You&#39;ve been through hell and gotten out of it!! Wow!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry at ALL about the personal hygiene<br/>
thing - after what <br/>
he&#39;s been through, it isn&#39;t that big a deal and, trust<br/>
me, it is VERY <br/>
very very common among boys his age.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have sons, but I have 3 daughters 14, 17,<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
hi again,<br/>
I have a son, and I agree with the above. I do think<br/>
everything is a deschooling-moving to unschooling<br/>
issue as the lifestyle change from ps is so radical.<br/>
someone said that something went wrong a long time ago<br/>
that had nothing to do with schooling.<br/>
I felt that things had gone wrong a long time ago with<br/>
my son as well, namely his dad&#39;s alcoholism and my<br/>
deppression during his infancy, which is why I saw<br/>
deschooling as a second infancy, now that I was<br/>
feeling much better and not reacting to his dad.<br/>
now I think that school is so much a part of our<br/>
cultural experience and even babies go to daycare and<br/>
are expected to sleep alone that pretty much<br/>
everything relating to parenting is related to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-422690659">If there was no such thing as &quot;schooling&quot; - at least not in the intense <br/>
all-encompassing of children&#39;s lives way - we could still have this <br/>
list and we&#39;d still talk about how we help our kids learn and how we <br/>
live together and all that we already talk about.<br/>
<br/>
We would just call it &quot;parenting&quot; - or maybe we&#39;d call it <br/>
&quot;relationship-based parenting&quot; or &quot;learning-focused living&quot; or <br/>
something else --- but we only call it &quot;unschooling because it is in <br/>
contrast to today&#39;s norms.<br/>
