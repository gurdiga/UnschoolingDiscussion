<div id="ygrps-yiv-412628248">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
I forgot to mention that there is a great link that explains dairy <br/>
history in the US... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.notmilk.com/deb/112298.html">http://www.notmilk.com/deb/112298.html</a> We&#39;ve <br/>
used this as a great unschooling topic of discussion with kids in my <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Also, it&#39;s pretty amazing to look at the health issues of our own <br/>
American Natives & the use of dairy & sugar, & even more startling to <br/>
look at the Japanese who are dropping like flies since dietary <br/>
changes after WW2 & western foods. Their cancer rates have <br/>
skyrocketed as has heart disease. <br/>
<br/>
I am Ogalala/Sioux & have witnessed first hand the effects of dairy & <br/>
other un-natural foods disapear when people in my own & different <br/>
tribes go back to a natural diet. Food can certainly heal or kill.  <br/>
<br/>
Much history & interesting topics to be found that may even prompt <br/>
you to question your own families diet choices... or perhaps simply <br/>
broaden your awareness.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18311714">Yes. For us this tends to be organic as much as possible... Some <br/>
(very little)   meats, fish, fresh roots & vegetables, legumes <br/>
fruits, nuts, seeds, some grains (if wheat, which we rarely eat,  <br/>
it&#39;s only sprouted), & water with occassional veggie or fruit juice.<br/>

Thanks for sharing.  That all sounds yummy to me.  Just add in some good old-world cheese and yogurt and an occasional serving of chocolate ice cream for me &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a sincere question re: natural diet.  Some foods are obviously natural, such as fruit from a tree or a freshly caught fish.  But once it is processed in some way, how can it truly be &quot;natural&quot;?  Is cooked meat a natural food?  It is certainly normal for humans, but so is consuming milk (at least for some humans!).  What about tofu?  That is very processed, yet has been an important part of the Asian diet for centuries, certainly part of their natural diet.  Many cultures use a lot of salt to cure foods, or they dry foods to prevent spoilage, and without these techniques they might have starved and died off.  What about when people move from their native country - should they continue to eat their old diet, or would it be more natural to switch to the diet of their new country?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I love my vegetables and have found that I *need* to eat lots of fresh vegies to feel good.  My tastes have changed enormously since I was a child.  I generally prefer less sweet foods now, except for fresh, juicy fruit, which I always enjoy.  And chocolate.  Which probably isn&#39;t at all natural, but sure makes me happy :-)<br/>

<br/>
Cancer rates might have nothing to do with western foods.  Other things <br/>
happened after WWII.  Maybe it&#39;s electricity in the homes.   Maybe it&#39;s <br/>
too-overcrowded conditions.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe there was more cancer before and it was called other things.  &quot;Natural <br/>
causes&quot; is hardly ever a cause of death anymore, and so statistics seem to <br/>
climb when the manner of reporting and the terminology is what changed. <br/>
<br/>
Nobody dies of consumption anymore.  Was &quot;consumption&quot; cured?<br/>

Like it would just &quot;consume the body&quot;--&quot;eat it up&quot;.<br/>

I could be SOOOO wrong!<br/>
