 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m curious as to why you keep on reading and answering these unschooling <br/>
messages if some part of you doesn&#39;t enjoy this?  When the Gun talk was going <br/>
on (I get a digest version) I read the amount of messages, looked at the <br/>
titles and skipped to the ones I wanted to read.  That&#39;s not to say I didn&#39;t <br/>
read some of the gun talk, just not all of it.  It wasn&#39;t such a hot topic <br/>
for me, but I thoroughly enjoyed the banter back and forth of the people that <br/>
it was an important subject too.  I even learned some things about not only <br/>
people but guns.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t learning what we are all about?<br/>
