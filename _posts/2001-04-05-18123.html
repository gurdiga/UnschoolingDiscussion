<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767957271">Oh Juli, I love you -- will you be my best friend?!<br/>
&lt;Composing myself&gt; -- see, it&#39;s just I loved what you<br/>
said and how you said it, and John Irving is one of my<br/>
favorite authors.<br/>
<br/>
Sure! I can use all the best friends I can get! I&#39;ve<br/>
read every book of John Irving&#39;s and I did a big<br/>
project/presentation on him for a comic lit class. My<br/>
all time favorite is still Garp. I know most Irving<br/>
fans rave most over Owen Meany, and I loved that, too,<br/>
but Garp&#39;s my man. I  even named my goldfish Garp (pun<br/>
on carp, which goldfish are, you know). Juli <br/>
