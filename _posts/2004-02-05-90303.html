<div id="ygrps-yiv-973386233">I have obtained permission to quote from a private e-mail, from a confident <br/>
unschooler who has spent a lot of time trying to help others get it.  I had <br/>
some ideas about the answers, but I thought maybe people here could discuss it <br/>
and maybe shed more light on it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about all the people that come to the boards or the lists <br/>
and ask the same questions that have been answered repeatedly over the years. <br/>
 Some claim to have done LOTS of reading, but then still ask a repeat <br/>
question.  So, do you think this is due to laziness and they were lying about doing a <br/>
lot of reading, or are some people simply unable to relate to what&#39;s being <br/>
said unless it&#39;s said directly to them?  I know these aren&#39;t the only two <br/>
possibilities, but they seem the most likely to me.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you think?  I&#39;m finding myself saying the same old [stuff] over and <br/>
over, and it&#39;s getting hard to come up with new ways of wording it.  I know <br/>
the new people don&#39;t realize it, but it has to get old for the rest of us.  It&#39;s <br/>
really cool when someone asks something that I have to actually think about, <br/>
lol.  I can only imagine how you must feel.  You&#39;ve been doing this a lot <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know I&#39;ve read lots of stuff, but it often doesn&#39;t mean much to me unless<br/>
I try to explain it to someone else. I learn better by explaining than by<br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a matter of how some people learn. Reading lots of philosophy<br/>
and stories from other people isn&#39;t the same thing for them as having it<br/>
translated into someone&#39;s own situation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I nearly always find some new insight when I answer a question. There&#39;s<br/>
almost always something different in each question. And posts are like<br/>
puzzles. It&#39;s a challenge to find all the pieces that fit together,<br/>
influencing each other, causing someone to think as they do.<br/>
<br/>
And there are still some connections I need to make in order to explain<br/>
things better and each post gets me a little closer. Like the difference<br/>
between what we think we need and our personal boundaries. Describing how we<br/>
need to stop imposing our boundaries on kids often comes across as sounding<br/>
like we need to stop having boundaries. And how to tell people to stop doing<br/>
academic things to their kids without it sounding like stop doing things<br/>
with your kids. When they&#39;re thinking learning is doing academics, then<br/>
stopping that sounds like stopping everything :-/<br/>
<br/>
So it doesn&#39;t bother me to answer the seemingly same question over and over<br/>
because they aren&#39;t ever the same question!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My response leans toward the latter, except I think it&#39;s a matter of <br/>
needing to interact with this new material, and to interact on an <br/>
emotional level.  New unschoolers are learners -- when I was <br/>
considering whether or not to unschool, I read stuff all day every <br/>
day for weeks.  I was passionate about it, immersed in it -- I <br/>
couldn&#39;t get to sleep at night because I needed to read &quot;just one <br/>
more article&quot; on it. I&#39;d wake up thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
It felt like a lot.  I&#39;ve read much more since then.<br/>
<br/>
And then when I posted to the list, I sure &#39;nough asked repeat <br/>
questions.  (I hadn&#39;t seen them on the list in the 2 weeks I&#39;d read, <br/>
though.)  &quot;Do you guys *really* have no restrictions on TV?  Do you <br/>
*really* have no set bedtimes?&quot;  I thought I had read most of <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site (I hadn&#39;t -- there were some rather huge pockets I <br/>
hadn&#39;t found yet), but still, she was one person, and I didn&#39;t know <br/>
she was a big name in unschooling.  And I thought I might be missing <br/>
something -- I didn&#39;t want to make these changes based on a <br/>
misunderstanding.  <br/>
<br/>
So I put my question out there, and got responses -- interactivity.  <br/>
Real people, from Florida to Ontario, from New York to California, <br/>
saying, &quot;Yes, what you read is true.  It&#39;s not a trick.  You won&#39;t be <br/>
ruining your child.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And the other thing they said?  &quot;Welcome.&quot;  There was that emotional <br/>
element, too.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971235014">In regards to...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some claim to have done LOTS of reading, but then still ask a repeat <br/>
question.  So, do you think this is due to laziness and they were lying <br/>
about doing a lot of reading, or are some people simply unable to relate to <br/>
what&#39;s being said unless it&#39;s said directly to them?  I know these aren&#39;t <br/>
the only two possibilities, but they seem the most likely to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A few things popped into my head when I read this, and they are:<br/>
<br/>
A)  I am new to this list.  I have done a lot of reading.  I also was raised <br/>
completely opposite to what I am trying to achieve with my own family.  In <br/>
my mind, I often feel like I have this battle going on between what I <br/>
instinctually know is right (and from what I have read), and my own <br/>
upbringing.  So although I have read a lot and know where I am going, I also <br/>
have to struggle with responding to my children in ways that my own parents <br/>
responded to me.<br/>
<br/>
B)  Reading something and understanding it, and then actually living it are <br/>
two different things.  I have come to this site to learn from parents who <br/>
have been unschooling for awhile and who have dealt with various situations, <br/>
to learn concrete ways that I can live peacefully with my own family.  Like <br/>
I said before, I never have actually seen a family live peacefully.  And <br/>
while I am not really &quot;seeing&quot; it on this message board, I am hearing <br/>
real-life situations that will more than likely occur in my own family <br/>
someday.<br/>
<br/>
C)  I love John Holt&#39;s books (and other&#39;s too - but especially John  :).  <br/>
And while I read them before I found this message board, it wasn&#39;t until I <br/>
started reading this board that I really started to &quot;get&quot; what he was saying <br/>
in relation to living in day-to-day life.<br/>
<br/>
D)  I am uncertain as to the &quot;repeat question&quot; remark.  It isn&#39;t a repeat <br/>
question if the person has never asked it before.....?  I am sure it is to <br/>
other people who have been on the board awhile, but that is to be expected, <br/>
right?  Especially if this board is for explaining unschooling to other <br/>
people...  Also, although I have read a lot about unschooling, there are <br/>
certain things that I never read in unschooling books that I have learned at <br/>
this message board - such as issues regarding eating, bedtimes, TV, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two cents.<br/>
<br/>
Erika  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-347345967">I first heard about Unschooling about 3-4 years ago.  A friend of mine was a practicing unschooler and told me a little about it.  I was intrigued.<br/>
<br/>
In the short time I&#39;ve been on this list and reading websites, testimonials, etc....I have noticed a lot of the same questions/concerns tossed around.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I know that my upbringing has contributed a lot to my fears of &quot;Am I really doing the right thing???&quot;, but I have simply to watch what&#39;s really happening to discover that I am, indeed, doing what&#39;s best for my family.  <br/>
<br/>
During the last week, I kept thinking &quot;Man, if Nathan comes home and finds out I let Madison play video games all day...he&#39;s going to be really upset and I&#39;m going to get a lecture on how irresponsible I&#39;m being!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I sat down and showed him some articles.  Madison is an avid gamer.  He always has been.  I remember when he was 3 and we had a PlayStation.  He would sit there and get so into playing that he&#39;d forget he was potty trained.  He was just flat out passionate about it.  It drove me crazy.  I kept saying &quot;He&#39;s going to end up some veggie that&#39;s addicted to video games and never make anything of himself!!!!&quot;  He was only 3!!!  I&#39;ve still struggled with it over the years, but in making the decision to homeschool/unschool him, I have also forced myself to let go.  To stop being my parents.<br/>
<br/>
So how people learn about unschooling (this is stricty opinion) is by doing.  It&#39;s a process.  Although, I can honestly say that the instinct to reach for the nearest &quot;seasoned&quot; unschooler and say &quot;OH PLEASE HELP ME!!!  I&#39;M SCARED!&quot; is strong, I try to hold myself back and say &quot;The info is here somewhere&quot;...in other words..look before you leap.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve ingested a lot of information over the last two weeks or so.  It&#39;s helpful.  It&#39;s still scary, but I did talk to my husband.  I showed him the same articles I&#39;d read.  I told him about how Madison really needs to &quot;de-school&quot;..and you know what the result was?  He was proud.  He was proud of me for letting go and finally getting to know this really cool little boy I&#39;ve got.  We can&#39;t wait to get started on the other two :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991181611">In a message dated 2/5/04 7:42:44 PM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:erikanunn@...">erikanunn@...</a> writes:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  It isn&#39;t a repeat <br/>
question if the person has never asked it before.....?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  Holly has only seen two hamsters, and those in the past year.  I <br/>
said &quot;But you&#39;ve seen pictures of them, right?&quot;  &quot;Not really,&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
So I wondered how a person could live in the world without seeing at least <br/>
pictures of hamsters, but I remembered she hasn&#39;t been here as long as I have <br/>
been.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people haven&#39;t seen snow.   Most people have never been to Hawaii <br/>
(where lots of people haven&#39;t seen snow. &lt;g&gt;)  So even people  who&#39;ve been on <br/>
earth a long time can totally miss out on things.<br/>
<br/>
But then...<br/>
If Holly really cares about hamsters, she can look on websites and in books.<br/>
If I&#39;m going to Hawaii I should study up a bit, at least geography and <br/>
history, so I don&#39;t ask them questions that are in the flyer in my hand, that they <br/>
might&#39;ve answered 350 times before.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people talk too much.  I talk too much.<br/>
But sometimes people talk without meaning to.  Or they don&#39;t figure out how <br/>
to have an exchange without nattering on.  Lots of times people could just <br/>
think a little while and look for the answer to their question without asking it.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s true, if it&#39;s that person&#39;s first time to ask, they&#39;ll ask.  Or <br/>
worse, they&#39;ll make the insulting suggestion that probably none of us have <br/>
considered that maybe our children can never get into college or get jobs, or that <br/>
because we focus too much on our children&#39;s comfort, that they&#39;ll never be able <br/>
to set an alarm and get to work, or asking questions in that way that suggests <br/>
the people they&#39;re coming to for help are probably really stupid.   &quot;How do <br/>
you expect a child to learn to read if you don&#39;t teach him?&quot; Or &quot;He won&#39;t find <br/>
math in the real world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those kinds of statements are the ones that bother me most.  It would be like <br/>
someone coming to my house, me inviting them to eat, handing them a plate, <br/>
and them saying some pretty horrible things before the food&#39;s on it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know like what.  Maybe like &quot;Most people WASH their vegetables before they cook <br/>
them,&quot; or &quot;chickens have to have the feathers and entrails removed before you <br/>
cook them&quot; before they&#39;ve even seen what&#39;s in the dish.   <br/>
<br/>
I know sometimes people come to unschooling discussions kind of distraught <br/>
and over-emotional.  But if someone&#39;s really hungry, maybe he just needs to hold <br/>
his plate and smile quietly, and taste the food, and then decide whether to <br/>
eat it.<br/>
<br/>
I have a huge amount of respect for La Leche League leaders who will help <br/>
other moms after their own kids are older.   It&#39;s a sacrifice.   Same with scout <br/>
leaders, and other volunteers who put their own time into organization and <br/>
meetings and cleanup and follow-up and hand-holding for people, few of whom know <br/>
how much is involved.  At least on-line help can be done without dressing up <br/>
or leaving home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1477346432">This is in response to the question regarding if people are asking repeat <br/>
unschooling questions because they haven&#39;t read a lot, or just don&#39;t <br/>
comprehend ideas that don&#39;t relate to them....(not exactly what was written <br/>
before, but the general gist...)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I was just folding my laundry and all of a sudden I realized, &quot;That <br/>
Dodd!  She just pulled a good one over on us!  She&#39;s asking why us <br/>
unschooling people have to ask questions even though we just read tons of <br/>
books!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it seemed kind of like a question we would ask kids who are <br/>
schooled.....&quot;Well, you read all these books on algebra....why are you <br/>
asking MORE questions about how it relates to x, y, and z?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know Sandra wasn&#39;t really pulling our chain, but it made me think for a <br/>
bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845690870">For me, learning something so often includes my asking a question about what was just said or read.  My question is often simply rephrasing the point presented.  It is a way for me to integrate information by using my own language and/or point of reference.  Funny thing about this trait is that of the two people who have commented on this bothering them the most - one offered me a job and the other married me &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348688012">I&#39;ve been on these boards since my six-year-old was a toddler. I <br/>
consider myself a person who &quot;gets it,&quot; but I know at times I don&#39;t. <br/>
Somebody else&#39;s problems often seem easier to me than my own, and when <br/>
I&#39;m deep in the fray the solutions that were offered a week or a month <br/>
before don&#39;t seem to apply, or don&#39;t come to mind.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s getting annoyingly old, you could pause and let someone else <br/>
respond, or make your own personal FAQ with responses you can just cut <br/>
and paste (like Sandra&#39;s offering the relevant parts of her website in <br/>
response to repetitive questions).<br/>
<br/>
As someone else said, the map is of much more use to me when I&#39;m <br/>
actually driving the terrain than when I&#39;m sitting in my comfortable <br/>
chair at home.<br/>

one of the first resources I came to. I think I asked all the dumb first <br/>

it took some time for me to realize that if I just shut up, the information <br/>
was there, and I like the taste of it very much.<br/>
The people who get incredulous(sp?) about the impossibility of unschooling <br/>
working  and post the irritating posts seem to just not be ready yet? They <br/>
simply are not yet of the mindset to believe in it , perhaps. That may be why they <br/>
can&#39;t be quiet and read maybe?<br/>
this list has been a great jumping on point for me and pointed me in the <br/>
direction of many other great resources and given me great ideas, even the posts <br/>
from the people asking the irritating things teach me stuff, not the least of <br/>
which is how much patience the &quot;old-timers&quot; here must have.<br/>

  Some claim to have done LOTS of reading, but then still ask a repeat <br/>

about doing a <br/>
  lot of reading, or are some people simply unable to relate to what&#39;s being <br/>
  said unless it&#39;s said directly to them? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, if all the questions have been asked and the answers are readily <br/>
available, why have a list like this or unschooling 101?<br/>
<br/>
I could read every book ever written about engine repair but I think I&#39;d <br/>
still have a hard time doing it until someone told me about their experience, how <br/>
they actually were successful at rebuilding a car engine on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;d believe that I COULD do it but maybe I&#39;d doubt WHY I would want to. <br/>
 After all, engine repair shops have been in the business for a long long <br/>
time, how could I EVER be as good?  Sure some of them are really really bad and I <br/>
would never want them to work on my engine but how could I KNOW that I could <br/>
do this thing to perfection since I&#39;ve never tried?<br/>
<br/>
Sure I&#39;ve read lots and lots about it and other people SAY they&#39;ve done it, <br/>
but how did it REALLY turn out?<br/>
<br/>
You make connections with others that have been where you want to be, you ask <br/>
questions, you listen, you respond, you ask some more, they might word it a <br/>
little differently so you finally understand that you CAN do this.<br/>
<br/>
On some level you KNOW you can repair an engine.  You can read, your hands <br/>
work fine, you can turn a wrench but what about all the little details?  What <br/>
about all the people who tell you that you are insane for even thinking about <br/>
such a thing?  There are places that stuff like that gets done and it&#39;s not done <br/>
at home by YOU.  But you say, well, I&#39;ve talked to ____________ and they&#39;ve <br/>
did it.  Then you tell them about another experience that someone else had and <br/>
how wonderfully it turned out.  You build a sense of encouragement and a sense <br/>
of ability and confidence the more stories you hear, the more ways and tricks <br/>
(in the sense of things you&#39;ve never thought about before to get you to where <br/>
you want to be).<br/>
<br/>
Reading is certainly wonderful.  It plants the seeds of WANT TO, even NEED <br/>
TO, unschool.  BUT interaction with those who HAVE been there and are living <br/>
wonderful lives, is what gives the confidence that one CAN DO!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-23608356">I had written a long and glorius response to this...and LOST IT!<br/>
I&#39;m just not in the mood to try and recreate what I said...way too much work.<br/>
I had a piece of what Erika wrote and expounded upon her thoughts in #1 of her list, and how I still battle the things I learned as a child, rather than doing what I KNOW is right and good.<br/>
I had read so much John Holt when we started in 1996, but just didn&#39;t GET that I had to actually live the way those he was talking about were living, I couldn&#39;t get the results without living the lifestyle FIRST.<br/>
I didn&#39;t see the results in my ds, so I thought I had to push him.<br/>
So sad.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo...why people don&#39;t want to accept that unschooling could work all relates to FEAR in my opinion. Fear that their children will be failures, fear to step out of the comfortable bounds of society, fear that someone will think they&#39;re not being &quot;good&quot; parents etc....<br/>
&#39;Course, that&#39;s why I wrote an article about it: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://addy.com/mhegener/HEM/202/marunning.html">http://addy.com/mhegener/HEM/202/marunning.html</a><br/>
<br/>
So having been there myself, I do understand why some folks take longer to connect the dots. It took me several years to totally 100% GET IT.  But I wasn&#39;t here blathering on about how nuts you all were either..... I did question a lot, because the unschooling was pretty easy for me, the part that was hard was how the philosophies apply to everything, including chores, food etc...<br/>

entire lives over the years but I am continually looking for where I am<br/>
still resisting...still controlling...how to handle various situations<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the repeated questions let me look at things at a slightly<br/>
different angle which helps me tremendously.  Some threads I immediately<br/>
pass over ( been there, done that) and others I know the information but I<br/>
find myself reading them anyway.  For me, it is almost a way for me to see<br/>
where I am on this journey our family is taking.<br/>
<br/>
It is kind of like listening to tourists ask the locals where the good<br/>
places to eat are.  You may have driven past a restaurant over and over and<br/>
not given it a thought but then you hear someone talking about it and<br/>
suddenly you look at the place a little differently.<br/>

&lt;&lt; At present, I&#39;m working to articulate unschooling to folks who haven&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
read ANYTHING about unschooling and can&#39;t possibly make the paradigm<br/>
<br/>
shift (which you would think is a silly thing). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For me it was easy because I had been trained in open-classroom philosophy in <br/>
the early 1970&#39;s, and there is a lot of educational research from the late <br/>
60&#39;s and early  70&#39;s that supports that.  So if your audience is older (45+) and <br/>
has been following education all those years, if you say &quot;Like the school <br/>
reformers of the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s...&quot; or &quot;Open classroom&quot; and that opens a flood of <br/>
info for them.<br/>

If they&#39;re younger, it&#39;s harder.<br/>

If one really wants clarification it&#39;s less irritating than if one  has the <br/>

always QUITE despised the therapists&#39; tool of repeating a question back *when* it <br/>
is used thoughtlessly.<br/>

If someone says something they didn&#39;t hear themselves say and a therapists <br/>
says &quot;So you&#39;re saying you have plans for when your mother dies?&quot; that&#39;s one <br/>
thing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they say, &quot;So you&#39;re saying you don&#39;t like potatoes?&quot; when the person has <br/>
just said &quot;I don&#39;t like potatoes,&quot; it probably means they&#39;re thinking about <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105538887">I think part of it is that newcomers just need reassurance from real live people when they&#39;re starting off--all the reading in the world isn&#39;t the same as personal reassurance. Unschooling goes against what society and loved ones say is &quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot; for children. Newbies just need to hear from people living this right now that they are not going to screw up their kids, the kind of rhetoric probably being flung at them from lots of directions. They&#39;re in that hand-holding phase where advice needs to be tailored to their lives. Whether veterans really want to continue this coddling is a whole &#39;nother question. *g*  It&#39;s like when people join twelve step programs and get a sponsor to check in with daily. Veteran unschoolers are sponsoring new unschoolers, holding their hands and reassuring them on their journey. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389275548">I think it&#39;s because human beings have a need for community.  <br/>
Younger, unexperienced people have a need for older, more experienced <br/>
people to show them how to do things and hold their hands and assure <br/>
them.  I think that&#39;s why we have grandparents. :)  Unfortunately in <br/>
today&#39;s society we often don&#39;t have grandparents living nearby their <br/>
grandkids, or the grandparents are working or don&#39;t have the <br/>
experience needed to help people.  (If Grandma didn&#39;t breastfeed or <br/>
cook from scratch or sew, she can&#39;t pass those skills down to her <br/>
grandkids)<br/>
<br/>
I have a huge mental block when it comes to sewing.  I&#39;ve read books <br/>
and websites, I&#39;ve read my sewing machine instruction book, but I <br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out how to thread my bobbin.  And once I took the <br/>
bobbin compartment apart, I couldn&#39;t figure out how to put it back <br/>
together again. The diagrams in the instruction book didn&#39;t help me <br/>
and my very non-technical brain couldn&#39;t figure it out.  I&#39;m an <br/>
otherwise intelligent person, but I have huge difficulties figuring <br/>
out how to sew.  So last time dd had pants she wanted hemmed, I <br/>
called a friend.  I made her lunch, her kids played with my kids, and <br/>
she patiently helped me through all the steps so that I could hem the <br/>
pants. <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of literature available about breastfeeding.  But La <br/>
Leche league exists even though people could just read The Womanly <br/>
Art of Breastfeeding.  <br/>
<br/>
When dd wanted to make pancakes for the first time, she read the <br/>
cookbook but still wanted me to stand with her and encourage her as <br/>
she made them.  &quot;I can flip them now?&quot;  &quot;Yes, I told you, as soon as <br/>
you see bubbles&quot;.  &quot;There are bubbles here, but are there enough <br/>
bubbles?&quot;  &quot;Yes, go ahead and flip them.&quot;  &quot;What if the pancake <br/>
breaks when I flip it?&quot;  &quot;That would be ok, it will still taste just <br/>
as good.&quot;  &quot;So I should flip it?&quot;  &quot;Yes, go ahead and flip it.&quot;  And <br/>
she finally did.  <br/>

someone who doesn&#39;t but in a different context.  Most of the time <br/>
books and articles are geared towards a particular audience and some <br/>
people don&#39;t exactly fit that audience to the tee.  So they&#39;ll have <br/>
the same question but might need a slightly different answer.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Okay, so I was just folding my laundry and all of a sudden I realized, <br/>
&quot;That <br/>
Dodd!  She just pulled a good one over on us!  She&#39;s asking why us <br/>
unschooling people have to ask questions even though we just read tons of <br/>
books!&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good theory, but no!<br/>
<br/>
If anything, it&#39;s more like asking people who calmed to have read a ton of <br/>
books to actually read them, and maybe even think about them!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The complaint didn&#39;t come from me, I was just sharing what someone had <br/>
written in private e-mail.   I figured my own theories weren&#39;t sufficient and by <br/>
asking in public it would not only help more experienced unschoolers know they <br/>
weren&#39;t the only ones who get tired of the same answers, but to kinda <br/>
pep-rally-up their enthusiasm to keep doing it a while. <br/>
<br/>
And maybe at the same time, some of the people who tend to ask the same <br/>
questions they know are answered elsewhere could consider waiting a day each time <br/>
and seeing if the answers don&#39;t present themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I just figured it would be something to make everybody think <br/>
about how learning works when someone&#39;s in a hurry to learn something and <br/>
they go to the resources they can find.  <br/>
<br/>
What I wrote back, now that others have put forth their ideas and theories, <br/>
was that some people want to be spoonfed.  Not the most charitable analysis, <br/>
but on the other hand it&#39;s frustrating when a mom says &quot;How will my children <br/>
learn unless I spoon-feed it to them?&quot; and my thought is &quot;Maybe she hasn&#39;t <br/>
experienced learning without it being dolloped out bit by bit herself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And there have been moms come through and leave in a huffy fury that we&#39;re <br/>
hypocrites because we *claim* to be patient and to let our children learn at <br/>
their own pace, but we&#39;re not that nice to the moms on the list.<br/>
<br/>
That irritates me anew every time, because the moms on the list are NOT my <br/>
young children, they are themselves the mothers of young children and I don&#39;t <br/>
have time to help them through Piaget&#39;s stages of mental development (their own, <br/>
I mean).  They&#39;re past that.  They&#39;re asking an adult question of adults, and <br/>
I want them to take the answers like an adult with a mission and go and use <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m expecting too much sometimes.<br/>

From: &quot;Deirdre Aycock&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aycock@...">aycock@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**  I had never<br/>
&gt; heard of sandradodd.com until you sent someone there instead of repeating<br/>
&gt; yourself--maybe the other new folks don&#39;t know about it either.  What an<br/>
&gt; awesome resource!  It&#39;ll take me awhile to read everything I want to at<br/>
that<br/>
 website, but are there other websites like it?  **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think this is worth repeating.   Sandra also has so many other related<br/>
links there too.    Ones that relate to unschooling, but really don&#39;t<br/>
literally relate to unschooling.  &lt;g&gt;   Ones on peaceful living and<br/>
respectful parenting.   All sorts of offshoots.  I remember when I first<br/>
started reading about unschooling and found her site.   I think I read for 3<br/>
hours one night,  just going from one link to another.    Then the next<br/>
night I read and read at the unschooling.com message boards.  That can go on<br/>
for hours and hours also.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that really helped me were tapes.  Her peaceful parenting tape<br/>
is great.  Also Anne O has some great parenting tapes that helped me to get<br/>
to a place where I could understand, feel comfortable  and *live*<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think all of these resources can help a person get to that happy<br/>
unschooling place.   Discussion lists, message boards,  tapes,  books,  and<br/>
of course meeting these people, in person, at conferences.  :)<br/>

&quot;I&#39;ve been thinking about all the people that come to the boards or the lists <br/>
and ask the same questions that have been answered repeatedly over the years. <br/>
Some claim to have done LOTS of reading, but then still ask a repeat <br/>
question.  So, do you think this is due to laziness and they were lying about <br/>
doing a lot of reading, or are some people simply unable to relate to what&#39;s <br/>
being <br/>
said unless it&#39;s said directly to them?  I know these aren&#39;t the only two <br/>
possibilities, but they seem the most likely to me.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you think?  I&#39;m finding myself saying the same old [stuff] over and <br/>
over, and it&#39;s getting hard to come up with new ways of wording it.  I know <br/>
the new people don&#39;t realize it, but it has to get old for the rest of us.  <br/>
It&#39;s <br/>
really cool when someone asks something that I have to actually think about, <br/>
lol.  I can only imagine how you must feel.  You&#39;ve been doing this a lot <br/>
longer than I have, and I&#39;m feeling a little burnt out sometimes.  &quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I first read this, I thought *I* might have written it in a daze or <br/>
while sleeping and had just forgotten I&#39;d written it! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To me, the problem is not necessarily the same &quot;idea&quot;----it&#39;s the same damned <br/>
QUESTION. Word for word. No alterations. Sometimes the child-in-question is <br/>
the *same* age and gender as the child who was discussed the *last* time it was <br/>
brought up (not to mention the month or season before). Did the questioner <br/>
REALLY read last week&#39;s posts? Really? REALLY???<br/>
<br/>
I realize that the questioner maybe *has* read for a week or two (not just <br/>
the daily posts, but also the archives) and that maybe she&#39;s thought about what <br/>
she&#39;s read. But she wants to know that it&#39;ll ALSO work in *her* family. Well, <br/>
we&#39;re all willing to say YES, it can. Again. It can. We can NOT tell her <br/>
exactly how it will work. We can&#39;t even tell her definitively that it will <br/>
work----if she doesn&#39;t DO the work. We can tell her again and again that it *has* <br/>
worked in our families and how. We can tell her that it can work if she&#39;s willing <br/>
to trust and respect her children and the process. But it really won&#39;t be any <br/>
different from the way we told the last person.  (Except for Joyce----she can <br/>
pull another great analogy out of her butt every single DAY!)<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I&#39;m willing to &quot;do it again&quot; and sometimes I&#39;m not. I&#39;m about to <br/>
the point where I&#39;m NOT.  I just want to scream, &quot;READ!&quot;  And then I&#39;ll just <br/>
watch Joyce and Sandra and Deb and and Mary and Tia and Kathryn and Pam(s) and <br/>
Ren and Rue and Lyle and ... do it all over again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on Unschooling-101 because I feel that &quot;someone&quot; has to be there (other <br/>
than Joyce and Deb). Otherwise it&#39;s overrun by NON-unschoolers giving really <br/>
bad advice----which has happened!<br/>
<br/>
If there weren&#39;t ---what did someone call us? Professional unschoolers? &lt;g&gt; <br/>
If there weren&#39;t &quot;seasoned/experienced/got-it unschoolers&quot; around to answer the <br/>
same questions over and over, what would happen to all the potential <br/>
unschoolers? They&#39;d HAVE to read what others had already written (in the archives) <br/>
---just like many of the old-timers did before the &#39;net (when they just had GWS <br/>
and a few books)! <br/>
<br/>
If other experienced unschoolers like this original poster *are* getting <br/>
burnt out and exhausted, there&#39;ll be fewer and fewer experienced unschoolers to <br/>
help. Burn out is burn out!  What if we ALL quit? (won&#39;t happen, but you know...)<br/>
<br/>
There will (I hope! &lt;g&gt;) always be experienced unschoolers around to help the <br/>
newbies. It&#39;s a passion! But the burn out factor IS there! I think that you <br/>
should definitely ask a question if you have one----ALWAYS. BUT! If you can <br/>
find the answer in the same spot without asking the *same* question, <br/>
well----isn&#39;t that better? MUST it be explained *just* to you? To your exact <br/>
specifications? Can&#39;t you take what you read and translate it into your situation? You&#39;re <br/>
going to have to anyway because EACH family is different: there are no two <br/>
alike!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of the &quot;issues&quot; that comes up here often: that some poster&#39;s <br/>
advice/writing style/inspiration is not what *you* wanted to hear. Well, then the <br/>
next poster might be &quot;just what you  needed&quot;---or the next or the next or the <br/>
next. And the first poster might have been spot on with someone else. If we <br/>
lose one, well.......<br/>
<br/>
The advice and inspiration here is free. My fear is that when an experienced <br/>
unschooler has had enough of the same-old-same-old,.....well, I&#39;d HATE to lose <br/>
that poster! Each experienced unschooler is invaluable to this process of <br/>
nurturing newbies. Each one! Because *that* experienced poster&#39;s advice might be <br/>
the one that&#39;s so inspiring to YOU.<br/>
<br/>
So! &lt;g&gt; Please read, read, and read some more----not just the daily posts, <br/>
which can indeed be daunting all by themselves: this is a *very* active list. <br/>
But read the archives at the site. Follow threads that interest you or that <br/>
address your concerns. It&#39;s rare that a new issue comes up. They happen, but it&#39;s <br/>
rare. Spanking, chores, reading, bedtimes, algebra, in-laws, alarm clocks, <br/>
spouses, etc.----they&#39;ve all been discussed again and again. After you&#39;ve read <br/>
and read, it&#39;ll be a part of you and you can even start *quoting* some of these <br/>
brilliant people. We&#39;ll still be here for your more pressing concerns (that <br/>
we&#39;d LOVE to explore---we&#39;re always up for a *new* challenge! &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;re between a rock and a hard place: if you don&#39;t ask questions, <br/>
we&#39;re here twiddling our thumbs. If you ask the SAME questions that have been <br/>
repeatedly answered, we&#39;ll burn out. I guess my suggestion is this: read until <br/>
you&#39;re blind! &lt;g&gt; Then if you STILL have questions, challenge us! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve probably muddied the situation even more, but I know where this note to <br/>
Sandra came from. I&#39;ve been there. I don&#39;t want newbies to quit asking; I just <br/>
want them to think about their situation a bit more before jumping in with <br/>
the same word-for-word questions. I WANT to help; I really do. I enjoy it. I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be here ever day if I didn&#39;t. I certainly wouldn&#39;t have put on the <br/>
conferences! But the &quot;if I let him, he would________ all day&quot; ....well, I find it <br/>
hysterical that Sandra&#39;s finally started a list of those! We hear it so much! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Your situation *is* different from the last poster&#39;s, but our advice can&#39;t <br/>
change much: we&#39;re still describing our own families and what *we&#39;ve* done/can <br/>
do! It&#39;s all we have! You&#39;re going to *have* to tweak our advice anyway to fit <br/>
your family. Try it ----or at least THINK about it----before you ask the same <br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe you could<br/>
<br/>
automatically give us newbies a list of websites! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We need a list FAQ!  <br/>
(I say that sheepishly, since I should&#39;ve been drafting one.)<br/>
<br/>
A list of other sources is a good thing to have there.<br/>
<br/>
What else should we have there?   Answers to the repeating questions!  <br/>
<br/>
Like....   <br/>

(What questions/answers should this FAQ have? and the modern days of the <br/>
