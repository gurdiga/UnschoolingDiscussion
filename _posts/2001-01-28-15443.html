<div id="ygrps-yiv-1792388678">HellO! I had my son in my lap while reading your post<br/>
and he went HAYWIRE when he saw where you&#39;re from. You<br/>
see, our favorite Boston Bruin&#39;s hockey player is from<br/>
your area! Kyle MacLaren, known dearly to us as<br/>
Sasquatch.<br/>
He would like to know if, 1. he can come live with<br/>
you, and 2. do you know Kyle?<br/>
