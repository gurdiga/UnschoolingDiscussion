<div id="ygrps-yiv-834194487">I just want to clarify that I did not mean to imply that people who <br/>
aren&#39;t familiar with natural parenting or radical unschooling do not <br/>
have principles. I&#39;m just trying to understand things through the eyes <br/>
of those who have those philosphies that are unfamiliar to me.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that my questions were not offensive and that you can see I&#39;m <br/>
just sincerely seeking something that I would love to one day <br/>
implement in my home.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
