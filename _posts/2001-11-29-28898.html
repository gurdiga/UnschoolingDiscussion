 </span></blockquote>Well, Julie, considering that my post was about what to do with a child<br/>
having problems, I stand by the statement that as unschoolers we are free<br/>
to figure out what they need from us.  As opposed to labelling them<br/>
whatever and doing what some psychologist said would work for a child<br/>
with that whatever.<br/>
As a parent I think I have a resposibility to pay attention and respond<br/>
to the needs of my child.  Do you think I should just let him flounder<br/>
until he figures it out for himself???  If not, why do you object so<br/>
vehemently to the statement that Unschooling frees us to figure out what<br/>
they need?<br/>
