<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906819705"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; No one teaches reading, yet <br/>
&gt; every kid that attends there, leaves knowing how to read<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was an important development for me, too.  My kids see the ding-dang <br/>
*Hooked on Phonics* commercials every day, with the proud parents proclaiming *My <br/>
child&#39;s a reader!* ~ they became convinced they won&#39;t read because mom won&#39;t <br/>
buy the program (believe me, this led to a HUGE discussion of truth in <br/>
advertising).  I waited out their skepticism ~ Hannah, soon 7, began reading her <br/>
first book a couple of months ago.  Suddenly, in the past three weeks (ever since <br/>
those teeth started falling out!) she&#39;s been reading about 25+ words from the <br/>
environment, even using context and first letter sounds to figure some out.  <br/>
The immediate effect on Hayden has been amazing!  At soon 5, he&#39;s *writing* <br/>
every word he sees and bringing the page to his sister to read back to him.  Last <br/>
night we talked about it and did a mock commercial *We kept our 100 bucks and <br/>
our kid&#39;s STILL a reader ~ NO THANKS Hooked on Phonics* (which I must <br/>
pronounce phonics, just on principle!)  <br/>
Faith, the most important quality for mommy to have...<br/>

â€œRelationships are a prerequisite for producing results beyond ourselves. <br/>
They expand our imaginations to infinite possibilities that cannot exist in a <br/>
life of isolation.&quot;    --Brian Koslow<br/>
