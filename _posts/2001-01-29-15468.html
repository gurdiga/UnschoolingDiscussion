&gt; CONFERENCE OVERVIEW<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The theme of this year&#39;s conference is: &quot;Multiple Currents: Expanding<br/>
&gt; The Boundaries of Transformative Learning&quot;. In the field of education<br/>
&gt; there is a growing use of the term transformative learning which appears<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; coming out of multiple and diverse areas of educational concern.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At the Transformative Learning Centre (TLC), we attempt dialogue<br/>
&gt; between people in areas as diverse as ecological and aboriginal studies;<br/>
&gt; feminist, anti-racist and post-colonial critiques; popular, global and<br/>
&gt; holistic education; critical pedagogy and cultural studies. This dialogue<br/>
&gt; generates creative tensions that have informed and expanded our views of<br/>
&gt; transformative learning and the possibilities of transformation. Our<br/>
&gt; intention in hosting this Fourth Annual Conference is to engage other<br/>
&gt; educators/learners in this broader exploration. The TLC&#39;s working<br/>
&gt; definition of transformative learning is as follows:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Transformative learning involves experiencing a deep, structural<br/>
&gt; shift in basic premises of thought, feelings, and actions. It is a shift<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; consciousness that dramatically and permanently alters our way of<br/>
&gt; being in the world. Such a shift involves our understanding of ourselves<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; our self-locations; our relationships with other humans and with the<br/>
&gt; natural world; our understanding of relations of power in interlocking<br/>
&gt; structures of class, race and gender; our body awareness, our visions of<br/>
&gt; alternative approaches to living; and our sense of possibilities for<br/>
 </span></blockquote>social<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; justice and peace and personal joy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; This conference will emphasize knowledge diversities, and bring into<br/>
&gt; dialogue educators from different sites where the language of<br/>
&gt; transformation is being used. We will continue to carry forward the<br/>
&gt; history of the previous conferences at Teachers College Columbia<br/>
&gt; University and the California Institute for Integral Studies (CIIS),<br/>
&gt; and also expand the boundaries to encourage participation from others. We<br/>
&gt; will attempt to support this diversity for creative educational dialogue<br/>
&gt; in the hope of deepening existing theory and practice. In this spirit, the<br/>
&gt; conference will include :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; - Innovative practice workshops<br/>
&gt; - Paper presentations - Poster presentations and other visual displays<br/>
&gt; - Presentations by noted leaders in the field of transformative<br/>
&gt; learning - Arts based performances that address transformation<br/>
&gt; - Popular education approaches to transformative learning - Self-<br/>
&gt; organized pre and post conference sessions or workshops - Special speakers<br/>

&gt; Institute for Studies in Education (OISE) and the University of Toronto<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; CALL FOR PROPOSALS<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To assist potential conference presenters and panel organizers in the<br/>
&gt; areas listed above, some guiding questions may be kept in mind :<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. In your work as an educator, how do you understand transformative<br/>
&gt; learning and how does your understanding relate (or not) to the<br/>
&gt; definition posed above?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. How do you distinguish transformative learning from other types of<br/>
&gt; learning?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 3. Does the process of transformative learning imply or require<br/>
&gt; particular content, i.e. are all changes transformational? Does any<br/>
&gt; content-shift constitute transformative learning? Or do we as educators<br/>
 </span></blockquote>make<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; implicit assumptions about what constitutes a &quot;perspective<br/>
 </span></blockquote>transformation&quot;?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 4. Transformative education for what? And transformation from what to<br/>
&gt; what?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 5. People who are not in the formal educational field of<br/>
&gt; transformative learning nonetheless do transformative education. How do we<br/>
&gt; understand and theorize this currently unacknowledged work?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In sending a conference proposal (papers and/or panels), identify at<br/>
&gt; the top what type of proposal it is from the options above. The proposal<br/>
&gt; should be no more than 350 words (about a page and a half) double<br/>
&gt; spaced. Participants should also include a short vitae not over half a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>page.<br/>
