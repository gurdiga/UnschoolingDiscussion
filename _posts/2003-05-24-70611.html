&lt;&lt;  I wanted to say that someone is capable of becoming an artist, and really <br/>
making it in the world. My husband supports our family very comfortably. He <br/>
never went farther than H.S. but he always tells the story of sleeping in <br/>
class <br/>
and the teacher telling him,&quot;he will never amount to anything&quot; and some one <br/>
pipes up and says &quot;teacher..he already makes more money than you&quot;! He was <br/>
airbrushing T-shirts in Daytona. He has gone on to be a very succesfull <br/>
artist! He is <br/>
the biggest unschooling advocate I know! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a great story!  Thanks.<br/>

Wonder if he knows my cousin Rob Oakes,  who airbrushed T-shirts in<br/>
Daytona for years.  He was given the rap of &quot;beach bum&quot; within the<br/>
family;  yet I envied him.  He did what he wanted and found a way to<br/>
make it productive.  Maybe in some way he planted or nurtured that seed<br/>
within me.  Now I wonder why most people don&#39;t pursue their dreams and<br/>
live the life they want to live.  Oh,  yeah,  they went to school and/or<br/>
had parents who &quot;broke&quot; them of that dream.<br/>
<br/>
My own Mom constantly discouraged me from pursuing arts as more than a<br/>
hobby because &quot;you can&#39;t make any money doing that.&quot;  I&#39;m finally<br/>
beginning to explore those ways of being creative.....thanks to the<br/>
unschooling mentality I have been developing for the past several years.<br/>

My parents always encouraged my artistic ventures and my dad always said,<br/>
&quot;Figure out what you REALLY like to do, then figure out how to make money<br/>
doing it.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-877846312">Well Susan ,<br/>
   Could be that he knows him. Most airbrushers know Henry, he&#39;s like a <br/>
legend up there. He worked there in 1965- ! We have like an &quot;Art House&quot; thing here. <br/>
Always projects going on. One is like edward sissor hands and there&#39;s the <br/>
glue gun guy.Drawing, sewing, pottery, oils, and I weave, spin and dye. These are <br/>
all going on every day. Once I was asked why I homeschooled if not for <br/>
religious reasons..I said for &quot;Artistic Freedom&quot;...I never wanted one of those <br/>
perfect cut out  refrig. flowers, you know that they bring home from Kindergarten. <br/>
As long as THEY  like the way something turns out that is what matters..look <br/>
at art show winners or masters works to see that. <br/>
  I can&#39;t say where that will lead the kids, but I encourage to do what <br/>
interests them.    <br/>
Hugs, Patti<br/>
