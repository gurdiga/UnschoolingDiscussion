<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676760840">Thanks to all who offered their experiences on seat belts  and booster <br/>
seats. I&#39;ll head out to the (horrible, oversized, impersonal, suburban) <br/>
toys-r-us and try the Kangaroo and Cosco models. I enjoy the thought of <br/>
hauling booster seats out to the parking lot to try them in my car. I&#39;m sure <br/>
the employees will look at me like I&#39;m from the proverbial other planet. <br/>
Perhaps I can even take a couple of models at a time, and ask for an <br/>
employee to come with me to show me how it goes in the car (not only will <br/>
they not go with me, they wouldn&#39;t know how it goes in the car). I&#39;ll pick a <br/>
day when I&#39;m mad at the world, and just be the yuppie mom from hell. I&#39;ll <br/>
let you all know how it goes. :)  ... Thanks again!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No they won&#39;t.  We try out all car seats in<br/>
each car before buying the seat.  They are<br/>
used to it, and even commented to me that few<br/>
people do this, but enough do that they won&#39;t<br/>
look at you funny.  Do take out each model,<br/>
and try it in your car, in each of the cars<br/>
you will be using.  Also, try it in different<br/>
seats, middle seat, etc.  it&#39;s really worth<br/>
it!  But don&#39;t expect them to help you, they<br/>
can carry but they have no idea how to put<br/>
them in.<br/>
