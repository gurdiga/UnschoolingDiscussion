<div id="ygrps-yiv-624002915">Hi everyone<br/>
I am a virgin at &#39;unschooling&#39; and need some help.<br/>
Up until this year all my little people (13,9,6) were public schooled <br/>
(never knew about &#39;homeschooling&#39; much less do it myself!)  This year <br/>
we moved and dd13 entered highschool (year 7 in land of Oz) She hated <br/>
it and was miserable.  After a month (school starts in Jan here) I <br/>
couldn&#39;t stand it anymore.  She has always liked school so this was <br/>
new territory.<br/>
I am a firm believer in learning our own life lessons and I thought <br/>
she would learn what she needed to from the experience and things <br/>
would improve.  I was wrong.  So I made a soul decision to remove her <br/>
from school realising that it was as much my life lesson as hers.<br/>
For the first month we followed a schedule of subjects like school, <br/>
both of us not knowing any different.  I got frustrated with that so <br/>
started researching other methods.  We have tried Rudolf Steiner and <br/>
Charlotte Mason.  Even though these worked better and have something <br/>
to offer they still weren&#39;t quite what I wanted.  Then I <br/>
discovered &#39;unschooling&#39;.  Something clicked and I knew it was the <br/>
way to go.  <br/>
I have tried to explain the concept of natural learning to dd13 but <br/>
she doesn&#39;t believe that it could be that &#39;simple&#39;.  I&#39;ve told her to <br/>
forget about subjects and how schools teach, just to do whatever she <br/>
feels like doing.<br/>
Anyway, sorry for rambling on :), she will do this for a week or so <br/>
and then get into a panic about all the things she is not learning <br/>
and what she &#39;should&#39; be &#39;studying&#39;.  She is really scared that she <br/>
will be behind her peers, that she will not be able to go to <br/>
University if she doesn&#39;t follow a cirriculum - Maths is the bigger <br/>
(She hates maths!)<br/>
I&#39;ve explained till I&#39;m blue in the face and there is still a &#39;but&#39; <br/>
after each discussion.  I was hoping :) that some of you could post <br/>
some reassurances to her, especially if you have children her age or <br/>
older.  Maybe they have some words of wisdom to offer her too?<br/>
Her name is Coreyna and she is one of the lights of my life.  If she <br/>
thrived and was happy doing hours of &#39;school&#39; bookwork each day I <br/>
would do it with her.  But she hates it.  I don&#39;t like seeing her so <br/>
scared and anxious about her future.<br/>
I asked if she would like to read some posts from people who have <br/>
breathed &#39;life learning&#39; and she is very interested in doing that.  <br/>
Guess she doesn&#39;t trust my judgement or her own :(  I think she <br/>
thinks I will change my mind again on how we will homeschool as we <br/>
have tried so many methods.  She doesn&#39;t quite get that this isn&#39;t <br/>
a &#39;method&#39;, just life.<br/>
So, pleeeeeeeeeeez help.  Your guidance would be very much <br/>
appreciated.<br/>
Love Joz<br/>
<br/>
PS  Pulled other 2 out of the &#39;system&#39; recently with dh&#39;s full <br/>
support.  They are both &#39;deschooling&#39; and loving it.  Have had others <br/>
in the neighbourhood plead with me to homeschool them!  There are no <br/>
other homeschooled kids in this area.  Some parents think I am insane <br/>
or just plain stupid - and I&#39;ve never been happier in my life.<br/>

I have a 14 yo and I think she&#39;d be willing to correspond with your daughter. <br/>
She&#39;s articulate about learning and unschooling and a VERY <br/>
committed-to-unschooling kid.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll forward your post to her and ask her to respond.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933955253">Hello Joz<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lurker/learner here on the list.  I just thought I&#39;d ask &#39;where abouts<br/>
in Australia are you?&#39;  We&#39;re in Brisbane and although my children are still<br/>
young (boys - 7 years and 22 weeks), we&#39;d be happy to talk &#39;unschool&#39; with<br/>
your daughter and can point you towards some resources (try Stepping Stones<br/>
mag for one - some school-at-home types, but others too and very inclusive).<br/>
Maybe you can email me off list and I can give you my &#39;phone number or some<br/>
such.  Or maybe you live in the next street and can come for tea and I&#39;ll be<br/>
overjoyed!!!!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062767220">If she is that concerned, have you let her set her own educational goals?  For example, if she thinks that huamn biology will be inportant, have her decide WHAT about human biology would be important and what she would like to do about it (research it, attend an autopsy, have a baby -- okay, I&#39;m being really far out here, and very tongue in cheek, but the point I am trying to make is : why does she think a specific area is important?  You mentioned Math -- is she thinking it will be important to a future career, or just an entrance subject to University?  Or does she really love it?  Whatever the answer is will dictate a very different approach.  If she is wanting it for a career, have her talk to somebody in that career and see what exactly they use and why -- was it mainly learned &quot;on the job&quot; or is there a specific theorem that is really useful?  If it is for university, both of you sit down and talk to a registrar and see what equivalencies would be accepted.  If it is an intrinsic interest, how would she care to pursue it?  As she begins to &quot;deschool&quot;, she will even quit dividing things into discrete subject categories, and start thinking instead about what interests her and why.  For example, a passage I just read tonight in a book talks about a girl sitting outside and copying a picture of a bird&#39;s skeleton.  A boy asks her if she is doing science.  She laughed.  &quot;See how school shutters you,&quot; she said.  &quot;I&#39;m drawing, painting, reading, looking. I&#39;m feeling the sun and the air on my skin.  I&#39;m listening to the balckbird&#39;s song.  I&#39;m opening my mind.  Ha!  School!&quot;         Does your daughter like to read?  There are numerous living books out there on the topic of homeschooling, and unschooling.  I just read one to my kids tonight, called Skellig.  Now, I don&#39;t know where you are at with the supernatural and fantasy, but the boy&#39;s next door neighbor, Mina, is unschooled.  He needs to take time off school to deal with his baby sister&#39;s illness, and hangs out with Mina.  He asks her a lot of the same kinds of questions about how will she learn anything, and she shows him the sculptures she has been making, and shares her research on the archaeopteryx and how birds fly.  Then they look at his homework of fill in the blanks and see the contrast.  It&#39;s a great lesson.  However, there is a supernatural character, who seems to be evolving from a human into a bird.  I can see where many people would be put off by this, but I really like the homeschool scenes.  There is another book called Libby on Wednesday, where the girl is homeschooled, and then tries public school.  Her friends are really impressed by the time lines and other projects she worked on while she was at home.  You know your daughter best and what will motivate her.  Possibly talking to other homeschooled teens will be a reassurance to her.  Anyway, I wish you luck -- and if there is anything more concrete I can do (book recommendations or whatever) let me know!   Debi  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Oooooh... this struck a chord of memory.  When I was around that age, my<br/>
mom says I started all my sentences with &quot;yeah-but&quot;.  (Pronounced with a<br/>
soft &quot;yeah&quot; and a very loud &quot;but&quot;, with no pause between the two words<br/>
at all.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to tell her that even on the other side of the world, where<br/>
people are walking around upside down &lt;g&gt;, teenage girls are teenage girls.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe I&#39;ll apologize to her for torturing her in this fashion. <br/>
Sorry mom!<br/>
<br/>

P.S.  (I studied hard in college, got pretty good grades, and promptly<br/>
forgot everything that I was supposed to be learning right after the<br/>
exams.  I think college is a scam.)</div>

I don&#39;t know of a specific board, but on another list I am on, www.Homefires.com  <br/>
-- go E-Mail Lists which is at the very bottom of the left hand side, then #2 Homefires Journal Discussion List -- there is a homeschooled teen, aged 16, who is entering college and has said she would love to answer any questions about college for homeschooling families.  It is in the archives, but was referred to today by another member, so you can get the email address there.<br/>

Oh, and the teacher will be better able to motivate him?   :o)<br/>
I couldn&#39;t get my kids to their bookwork either -- now we unschool and I am amazed at the self-motivation they are both showing!  The 9 yr old is designing his own Legolas costume (He has just discovered Lord of the Rings and is absolutely entranced), trying to build an Ancient Egyptian shaduf (an irrigation device), refining a balance scale he created, inventing a gamebook based on Star Wars.... but show him a text book and he becomes absolutely mutinous!  The 7 yr old is also creating a Star Wars gamebook, making clay floor tiles based on Egyptian pattern, building a space station out of Lego, writing her own &quot;EasyBake Oven&quot; cookbook based on her own invented recipes, and trying to figure out how to sew a princess outfit out of an old sheet.... who has time for school?

 *Real life math: &quot;Help children feel at home with money ....<br/>
Speak up about money early and often .... involve them in the family&#39;s<br/>
finances .... Give children an allowance ... make them responsible for<br/>

Open a savings account in the child&#39;s own name .... involve them in<br/>
investing, perhaps by using mock accounts that some websites offer ....&quot;<br/>
