&gt; me right now as we may be getting ready to close on of those doors I am <br/>
&gt; talking about and take a leap of faith on a new business. It&#39;s not that my <br/>

&gt; together so much more.. . . anyway, I need to keep focuesd on trusting . . <br/>

business where he works part time and I work part time.  That way we can both <br/>
be with them. I did have to take a leap of faith.  The other alternative was <br/>
to wait for the &quot;safe&quot; thing to happen.  Sometimes I have had to create that <br/>
space to allow the good things to come along.  At the beginning of the week <br/>
after writing about 7 preschools that my son had been too, the light bulb <br/>
went back on that he isn&#39;t meant to go there and to just jump in and do this. <br/>
 We unschooled for 6 months last year, but I think I did it half heartedly <br/>
and hadn&#39;t completely changed my priorities.  This time I scaled back my <br/>
business to only weekends (apart from the radio shows which are usually at <br/>
5am in the morning, when kidlets are asleep) and started to look at the <br/>
lifestyle hubby and I want to have and how we can craft businesses around <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
It still takes faith and it sounds like that&#39;s what you have right now... <br/>
Good luck with your venture.  By the way, what is it?  Tell everyone what you <br/>
are doing because you never know who might need your services and where you <br/>
are going to meet those people.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s a business idea I have been kicking around for a year or so, and <br/>
it looks like the time is come to do it (sometime next year). It&#39;s a barter <br/>
exchange, where we sign up other business&#39;s that are interested in bartering <br/>
with other business&#39;s. It frees up their cash and allows them to move extra <br/>
inventory they may have. I was in one in Louisiana and absolutely loved it. . <br/>
. it&#39;s a great way to expand your business and increase your bottom line. My <br/>
husband is a travel agent and would still do that, although only as an <br/>
outside agent. We moved here for him to take over the travel agency from his <br/>
uncle, but it doesn&#39;t look like that may happen. I think it&#39;s a great <br/>
opportunity for him to be the primary parent at home, even though it will be <br/>
a home business and I will be home a lot. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787760775">Thanks Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
I just went to your website. . . very cool! Have you read any of Sylvia <br/>
Browne&#39;s work? Some of what you talk about sounds like her cell regression <br/>
stuff, which I find particularly fascinating. My daughter and I are going to <br/>
do some of the meditations on this and try to recover some past life <br/>
information. . . I was so excited when Lelia (my 12 year old) picked up one <br/>
of the books I had laying around and read it (no prompting at all from me) <br/>
and is so interested in it as well. . . and my husband too. Should be really <br/>
interesting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t read any Sylvia Brown but I do know who she is and about the work <br/>
she does.  Looking at the Pluto, North and South Nodes in your Natal chart is <br/>
really helpful is finding your Soul Purpose and how to get there.  I <br/>
absolutely love what I do and working with women (especially mothers) to help <br/>
them find a career they can do from home around their children and make money <br/>
at it, has been one of my main goals in the past couple of years.  I&#39;m <br/>
working on a book about this and will let you know when it&#39;s finished.<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for the feedback.<br/>

helping women to see they do have choices. It sounds like what your focus is <br/>
fits so well in with unschooling. Do you have the opportunity to turn people <br/>
on to unschooling/homeschooling with  what you do?<br/>
