<div id="ygrps-yiv-362683248">From what was marked Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 1599<br/>
a great post by Julie/<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jnjstau@...">jnjstau@...</a><br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; In both cases, the root cause was physical but the mental made all the<br/>
difference in my perception of the event how I handled it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly has been hurt twice tonight.  A friend&#39;s cat scratched her fairly badly <br/>
in three long lines, on her calf, through her jeans.  She called crying and <br/>
said they were bringing her home, when she had called just shortly before <br/>
that all happy and saying she&#39;d be home a few hours later.  But she was calm <br/>
about it as soon as the pain quit, and she was attentive about antibiotics <br/>
and care of cat wounds.<br/>
<br/>
Then she was playing with a balloon and somehow got something &quot;big and sharp&quot; <br/>
in her eye.  She came upstairs to me saying &quot;something really big is in my <br/>
eye and it really hurts.&quot;  She was scared, but cooperative, and at one point <br/>
asked &quot;Can I rub it, just a little?&quot;  I said sure, because I figured if it <br/>
was cutting her she&#39;d stop.  She pulled her own eyelid out, she lay down and <br/>
let me pour water on her eye so she could open it and let the water in.  We <br/>
spent the whole time discussing what it might be (probably something from the <br/>
carpet that stuck to the balloon--probably a tiny piece of wood, as we were <br/>
splitting kindling by the fireplace last night).  <br/>
<br/>
Because we&#39;ve taught them to calm themselves by breathing since they were <br/>
babies, she does it herself matter of factly.  We neither freak out nor say <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re fine&quot; when they say they&#39;re hurt or scared or whatever.  And the calm <br/>
and communication have always been a part of it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my own mom would want to totally take over and knock my hand away <br/>
from whatever she was doing, and tell me to be quiet.  If a problem was <br/>
turned over to her it was HERS and no longer the kid&#39;s.  I would have stopped <br/>
at any point Holly said stop.  She knows what she can handle and what she <br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
And other kids have been hurt here and not handled themselves or getting <br/>
assistance NEARLY that well.  A cactus thorn in October was a huge ordeal for <br/>
a visiting little girl.  I sympathized with her for the first fifteen minutes <br/>
or so of panic and &quot;NO! NO! Don&#39;t touch it!&quot; and then left it to my husband <br/>
who had more patience.<br/>
<br/>
I have a ton of faith in my kids&#39; good judgment and self-awareness.<br/>
