<div id="ygrps-yiv-267296000">Hi everyone,  I am so angry this morning!!  I sent my dd to Hulbert Homeschool Camp in Vemont this week.  As you can see by the title this is a camp specifically for homeschoolers.  At other times duriing the year they welcome school groups.  Well, I found out that their ae people that have children in school and send them to this camp!!  First of all how can someone be so inconsiderate?!  These people homeschooled in the past and decided to send them here again.  The other thing is this.  The cabins are designed to have 4 girls in a room.  My daughter loves the cabin part!   This schooled kid is in her room in an extra bed.  So, there are 5girl in there!!   I wanted her to go to a *homeschool* camp...I am so upset about this.  We paid $230 for the week which isn&#39;t a small amount to us.   There are so many things for schooled children that I can&#39;t believe anyone would be arrogant enough to just blow off the rules and send their kid....especially someone who has homeschooled before.  So, what would all of you do?  I am so afraid that she is having a crummy or less than ideal time &#39;cause of this....we can&#39;t communicate unless it&#39;s an emergency.   My friend who also has a child there told me about this and we have a mutual friend that knows these people.   I am irrate, pissed, rantin&#39; and ravin&#39;....People have always got to horn in on something that&#39;s good for homeschooler&#39;s....feedback greatly appreciated!!!<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know -- is it such a bad thing that kids who are now going to school<br/>
&gt; are at the camp? I have heard good things about Hulbert and am going there<br/>
&gt; myself in September. I know that there are some children and teenagers who<br/>
&gt; go there, who have been homeschooled but are now in school. That doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mean that all of these children who are not homeschooled are a bad or<br/>
&gt; disruptive influence on your child. Some things you just have to live<br/>
&gt; with -- and who knows? Your daughter might make friends with those &quot;schooled<br/>
&gt; kids&quot;! :) My advice is not to worry. Going to camp is not supposed to be<br/>
&gt; about making your kid associate with the &quot;right kinds of kids&quot; -- it&#39;s about<br/>
&gt; having fun.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714291404">The children that are there are not trying hsing out...they are in school now and will be going to a Catholic school in the fall.  I am not terriffied or anything...dd can make good choices on her own.  I was just looking for some unschoolers to agree with me about having schooled kids take up space unfairly at the camp...I know of a family that didn&#39;t get to go cause of this.<br/>

&gt; Linda,<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t sound very peaceful!  Take a deep breath!  I think (as a parent)<br/>
&gt; that it is awful not to be able to reach your child unless you have an<br/>
&gt; emergency!  What if they just need to touch base at home, get support, or<br/>
&gt; talk a little?  That is probably just my paranoia though, my older son will<br/>
&gt; probably never go to anything like camp.  He has some very dangerous<br/>
&gt; allergies, and I would not be comfortable with him being so unsupervised<br/>
&gt; and so far from emergency medical care.  I have to carry his medications<br/>
&gt; everywhere he goes, just in case.  It would only take a few seconds after<br/>
&gt; exposure to something (in another child&#39;s candy or something) and we would<br/>
&gt; not have him anymore, so I am very careful with him.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As to the &quot;extra&quot; child in the cabin.  Maybe the parents are having second<br/>
&gt; thoughts about ps.  Maybe the little girl is much more comfortable in the<br/>
&gt; environment with the other homeschooled children.  She&#39;s only a little<br/>
&gt; girl, and in my experience, and extra girl at the slumber party just meant<br/>
&gt; more giggles to go around.  Trust your daughter&#39;s ability to make the best<br/>
&gt; of the situation.  Her cabin carries the status of having more girls than<br/>
&gt; anyone elses.  That alone should be enough to make the girls in there happy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you are this upset, I would call it an emergency (an emotional one<br/>
<br/>
&gt; anyway.)  Just call the camp and tell them that you need to speak to your<br/>
&gt; daughter about a personal family matter.  Then ask her what she thinks,<br/>
&gt; feels about the situation.  It may put your mind at ease, or she may want<br/>
&gt; to come home early if she is really &quot;having an crummy time.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077680358">Hey Eryn,   Misunderstandings are easy out here in cyberland!  My point is that kids that go to school are not supposed to be at Hulbert during Homeschool Programs.  I understand the desire to visit and hang with friends no matter if you&#39;re in school or not.   There are not alot of forums for *just homeschoolers*.   So, when the opportunity arises for a homeschool specific gathering it is meant as just that.  So, the expectation that kids who are in school should be able to come to such a gathering is ludicrous.  Hulbert breaks the kids cabins into girls and boy and youngest, middle, and oldest children.  It does have a structure to the day but, kids have options of how they choose to participate...it isn&#39;t an option not to participate in some way even if it means just supporting others.  This is all spelled out in the registration materials and so if it isn&#39;t what someone wants there are no surprises.<br/>
Peace and Understanding<br/>

&gt; Hi Linda,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s okay. I guess I did misunderstand you. I get kind of defensive when<br/>
&gt; home/unschoolers I know act like kids who go to school are a different<br/>
&gt; species. I know a lot of very intelligent and perceptive people who go to<br/>
&gt; school -- and some of them do like hanging around the homeschool crowd!<br/>
&gt; Their are many homeschoolers are in school for the time being but have<br/>
&gt; homeschooled friends who they get to see for a whole week at Hulbert.<br/>
&gt; So how old is your daughter anyway? I&#39;m not sure whether they separate kids<br/>
&gt; by age or not at Hulbert (I know they don&#39;t at Not Back To School Camp --<br/>
&gt; but Hulbert is more structured I believe). I&#39;m fifteen and going mainly to<br/>
&gt; see other homeschooled (and unschooled) teenagers than I made friends with<br/>
&gt; at an unschoolers weekend. (I&#39;m also going to Not Back To School Camp as<br/>
&gt; well). Anyway, I&#39;m kind of rambling on right now :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In peace,<br/>
&gt; Eryn<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am not worried about her associating with the right kinds of kids...it&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001223395">I can see why you are upset but if it is a well run camp I would think the<br/>
the schooled child would feel a bit out of place, not your child.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t worry too much I always think my child will react one way and then<br/>
she goes some other way I didn&#39;t even think of so your daughter my not have<br/>
a problem with this.<br/>
Maybe next year you can talk to  the camp and try to keep this from<br/>
happening again. Of course I could be wrong and its easy for me to say all<br/>
this since its not me its happening to.<br/>

talk a little?  That is probably just my paranoia though, my older son will<br/>
probably never go to anything like camp.  He has some very dangerous<br/>
allergies, and I would not be comfortable with him being so unsupervised<br/>
and so far from emergency medical care.  I have to carry his medications<br/>
everywhere he goes, just in case.  It would only take a few seconds after<br/>
exposure to something (in another child&#39;s candy or something) and we would<br/>
not have him anymore, so I am very careful with him.<br/>
<br/>
As to the &quot;extra&quot; child in the cabin.  Maybe the parents are having second<br/>
thoughts about ps.  Maybe the little girl is much more comfortable in the<br/>
environment with the other homeschooled children.  She&#39;s only a little<br/>
girl, and in my experience, and extra girl at the slumber party just meant<br/>
more giggles to go around.  Trust your daughter&#39;s ability to make the best<br/>
of the situation.  Her cabin carries the status of having more girls than<br/>
anyone elses.  That alone should be enough to make the girls in there happy.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are this upset, I would call it an emergency (an emotional one<br/>
anyway.)  Just call the camp and tell them that you need to speak to your<br/>
daughter about a personal family matter.  Then ask her what she thinks,<br/>
feels about the situation.  It may put your mind at ease, or she may want<br/>
to come home early if she is really &quot;having an crummy time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-392187052">Hi Linda,<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay. I guess I did misunderstand you. I get kind of defensive when<br/>
home/unschoolers I know act like kids who go to school are a different<br/>
species. I know a lot of very intelligent and perceptive people who go to<br/>
school -- and some of them do like hanging around the homeschool crowd!<br/>
Their are many homeschoolers are in school for the time being but have<br/>
homeschooled friends who they get to see for a whole week at Hulbert.<br/>
So how old is your daughter anyway? I&#39;m not sure whether they separate kids<br/>
by age or not at Hulbert (I know they don&#39;t at Not Back To School Camp --<br/>
but Hulbert is more structured I believe). I&#39;m fifteen and going mainly to<br/>
see other homeschooled (and unschooled) teenagers than I made friends with<br/>
at an unschoolers weekend. (I&#39;m also going to Not Back To School Camp as<br/>
well). Anyway, I&#39;m kind of rambling on right now :)<br/>
<br/>
In peace,<br/>

that are having a school experience....we do plenty of that.  When they have<br/>
weeks for school kids homeschooler&#39;s are not included....She is involved<br/>
with lots of kids here at home...ps kids, private school kids, unschoolers,<br/>
whatever...So, yeah it is crummy that kids that aren&#39;t homeschooling are<br/>
taking up space.  I never said these children were bad or disruptive...<br/>
She&#39;s got lots of schooled friends...she&#39;s social and outgoing and friend<br/>
making isn&#39;t a problem for her.  By the way going to a homeschool camp is<br/>
about going to a homeschool camp...and having fun.   Hey, maybe she&#39;ll meet<br/>
you in September as she goes to each session....I am sorry that you<br/>

Well since I can&#39;t speak from personal experience about camps I can only<br/>
say that if you know there to be issues that make it a bad idea to include<br/>
schooled kids (lack of space, etc) then trust your gut.  If it makes you<br/>
upset, the by all means talk to the folks who run the camp about their<br/>
thoughts and reasons for allowing this.  I see you are not trying to be<br/>
exclusionary, and it is up to you how far you want to take this or how<br/>
important you think it is.  Talk it over with your daughter when the<br/>
opportunity arises and get her take and the situation.  Maybe she will be<br/>
interested in doing something about it if she does not like it and this<br/>
would be a good opportunity to learn about community and civic interaction,<br/>
or whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453298495">I just got off the phone with Carolyn, and there are some openings left <br/>
for this homeschool camp.  This camp is really cool cause the working <br/>
parent can attend on the weekend, and then go back to work while the <br/>
other parent and kids can stay through thursday!  THe price is really <br/>
reasonable, and it&#39;s a good getaway.  If you have any questions, email <br/>
me.  I highly recommend this camp, the food is great, the people are <br/>
wonderful, the environment is restfull, the cabins are comfortable (not <br/>
the hilton, but nice!) and it&#39;s worth every minute!<br/>
<br/>
for those of you who are not in California, the camp is in the San <br/>
Bernadino mountains, about one hour, 20 minutes (without traffic) from <br/>
Orange County (disneyland), about the same from LA.  It&#39;s worth a longer <br/>
drive, though, and people have come from all over--from Arizona, Utah, <br/>
Northern California, etc. <br/>
