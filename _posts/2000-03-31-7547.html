<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094650249">Thanks Theresa,<br/>
Ive been reading everybody&#39;s posts and so wanted to jump right in. <br/>
Every time I went to onelist I would look for the &quot;chat&quot; button and <br/>
never did quite find it. I found this post thing by playing with all <br/>
the buttons! I wonder why my dd is always touching everything!LOL. I <br/>
know its good for her.</div>
