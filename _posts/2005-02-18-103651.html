 Uh, I am unsure of me questioning this, but what the heck---Why?<br/>
Not about why you were alone, not about being in the dark, but why are<br/>
you collecting old wax from luminaries in the graveyard? (I keep<br/>
laughing, picturing this) Did I miss some posts---I was reading about<br/>
Monty Python earlier which had me shopping at amazon and then popping<br/>
into ebay...<br/>
  Anyway, haven&#39;t posted before. Have been reading thru & learning<br/>
lots. Wish I had more time for an intro, maybe another day. <br/>

========================<br/>
 <br/>
Because I don&#39;t go to medieval feasts anymore.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s the real reason.  <br/>
 <br/>
Because for years and years I had lots of reasons to clean up after candle  <br/>
wax, and it came to be my habit and practice to melt wax and put it on little  <br/>
splits of kindling wood, and give it to my friends at Christmas and to start <br/>
our  own fire with that &quot;waxy wood.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
SO we got this hot tub that needs a fire build down in a, but I had NO  scrap <br/>
wax, and we haven&#39;t even had a party here for a long time that used  candles, <br/>
though we used to have a couple of times a year when I was big involved  in <br/>
the medieval thang.  <br/>
 <br/>
We had gone to the cemetery on Christmas Eve and seen all the hundreds of  <br/>
luminarias, and a week later I went to collect the little cold puddled  wax.  <br/>
And as a grave robbery tax, I cleaned up whatever trash I  found.<br/>
 <br/>
Melted it, poured it on the kindling, started many happy fires.<br/>
