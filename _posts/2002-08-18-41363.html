Does anyone know of a description of this Biblical Commonweatlh?<br/>
Is there a vision of how life would be under such a regime?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got two bits here that says it&#39;s socialism.<br/>

More off topic than usual, I admit.<br/>

<br/>
There were, I think, 6 or 7 states who after the ratification of the <br/>
Constitution still held their established Christian denominations. Each state <br/>
slowly disestablished in time, but till then, those states had religious <br/>
tests for office holders, and taxes to support the churches. Yet, I don&#39;t <br/>
think any of those could be considered a Biblical commonwealth. Fortunately, <br/>
citizens of those states realized that none of this was consistent with the <br/>
general spirit of liberty that had got hold of most of America. <br/>
