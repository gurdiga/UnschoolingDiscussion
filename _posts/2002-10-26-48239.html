 </span></blockquote>Behind what or behind who?<br/>
<br/>
School is an orchard where trees are expected to begin producing fruit on a<br/>
specific schedule.<br/>
<br/>
For unschoolers the trees are nurtured in a tropical garden where they will<br/>
bloom in their own time.<br/>
<br/>
There is an Unschooling and Special Needs folder on the message boards at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a> that should help you see how unschooling works<br/>
with special kids.<br/>

Why would it be different from unschooling anyone else? (She asked, <br/>
rhetorically. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same.  Too bad they&#39;ve been labelled and declared to be &quot;behind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As much as you can, never mention or think those labels ever again.  The work <br/>
is on the mom&#39;s art much more than the child&#39;s part to tell him that he&#39;s <br/>
just him and can&#39;t be behind or ahead of him-own-self.  Give him time and <br/>
room and patience and love and input and experiences and let him learn in his <br/>
own way.  <br/>
<br/>
Liam McClure is an 18-year-old I&#39;ve known for sixteen years.  He&#39;s never been <br/>
to school.  You can read about him and his siblings learning to read here:<br/>

It&#39;s the second article there.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same for any kind of learner, since the idea is to <br/>
offer all kinds of information and ideas and downtime and opportunity and let <br/>
the children pick and choose as at a big banquet that lasts for years.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually you can see the world as a big banquet that lasts for life.<br/>
