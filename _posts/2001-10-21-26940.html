&gt; Your preparedness and planning are commendable, Julie.<br/>
&gt; Thanks.<br/>

Our local paper had a recent article about &#39;emergency&#39; kits (no,  I think<br/>
they called them survivor kits...do ya think that&#39;s what they provide on the<br/>
TV show?!) .....thay include things like blankets, waterproof<br/>
matches...water,  first aid supplies.  I believe the American Red Cross<br/>
sells kits and/or has a list of supplies for both first aid and survival<br/>
items.  I remember $145.00 for a 4 person kit.<br/>
Check out the ARC website,  I&#39;m fairly certain that&#39;s where the lists can be<br/>
found.  I&#39;ll check the paper if I haven&#39;t pitched it for the site.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve had kits for some time now, not just because of Y2K, not just <br/>
because of the Sept 11th attacks, but just because its the way we do <br/>
things in our house. Keeping them ready, checking them every 6-9 <br/>
months, and being aware of what&#39;s going on around you becomes <br/>
natural, not paranoia. I&#39;ve been married to a firefighter and <br/>
paramedic for 17 years now so that has a lot to do with it. He is <br/>
constantly surprised by how few people know where basic documents are <br/>
kept when they have simple fires or emergency health issues. It is <br/>
not a panic response to want to have your life in some order, just in <br/>
case, especially when you have children.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

NY with recent Red Cross fund drives. That is not true. They are <br/>
giving to a general fund that funds ALL of the Red Cross. Yes, that <br/>

could well be a very one-sided view. I really just wanted to get out <br/>
the info about the FEMA web page. It is very well constructed, has <br/>
served for coverage of many health and safety issues as my children <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748350841">Wellll, ya didn&#39;t ask me but I&#39;m going to chime in with some first hand<br/>
experience from several disasters the latest of which was Loma Prieta.<br/>
<br/>
Although they say that the money stays local, it doesn&#39;t and when it was<br/>
needed it wasn&#39;t there.  It took weeks to get stuff done.<br/>
<br/>
Where was the money, you ask?  Well, at that point in time it had gone to<br/>
national and the big wigs were taking vacations to Europe with their<br/>
families, supposedly to attend conference--once, twice and sometimes three<br/>
times in one month.  There were major questions asked and when the answers<br/>
weren&#39;t acceptable was when Lizzie Dole stepped down.<br/>
<br/>
this is not, before anyone jumps in, anti-Republican.  My boss, at the time,<br/>
was the head of the local chapter of red X and he was an absolute rabid,<br/>
frothing at the mouth Republican.   My info as to where the money went came<br/>
from him and I was the one that had to put through all the phone calls and<br/>
take all the messages.  Also, the mayor of SF took them to court to get the<br/>
money back.<br/>

 &gt;  &gt; Out of curiousity :) why are you not fans of the red cross?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; This is a generalization and is based only on my experience and that<br/>
 &gt; of my husband and his fellow firefighters in and around a large urban<br/>
 &gt; area. The Red Cross is king of paperwork and &quot;assessment of need&quot;<br/>
 &gt; (read: prove you need this) rather than real and direct help in times<br/>
 &gt; of need. When there&#39;s been a fire or a tornado or other disaster, we<br/>
 &gt; typically refer people to the Salvation Army. If the city cop or<br/>
 &gt; firefighters says this family needs this, that&#39;s all the SA needs to<br/>
 &gt; provide ON THE SPOT help. Conversely, the Red Cross takes hours,<br/>
 &gt; sometimes days, two to three people asking the same questions, and<br/>
 &gt; enough paperwork to choke a horse. Their overhead is tremendous and<br/>
 &gt; their staff is way too fat to get my money. Additionally, money does<br/>
 &gt; not stay locally and cannot be designated to a specific need. Many<br/>
 &gt; folks across the nation believe that they are giving to help folks in<br/>
 &gt; NY with recent Red Cross fund drives. That is not true. They are<br/>
 &gt; giving to a general fund that funds ALL of the Red Cross. Yes, that<br/>
 &gt; certainly helps NY, but that is not what all those $$ have been<br/>
 &gt; pouring in for. Check out their overhead - the portion of each dollar<br/>
 &gt; that actually goes to those in need. It was an eye opener for me a<br/>
 &gt; few years back.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; That&#39;s it in a nutshell. My husband wouldn&#39;t give you a dime for the<br/>
 &gt; whole organization. I&#39;m not quite as critical but not a fan.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Leave it to me to enter a list with a loud opinion... sorry. I<br/>
 &gt; certainly don&#39;t feel the need to change the opinions of others, nor<br/>
 &gt; do I negate in positive interactions people have had with the Red<br/>
 &gt; Cross. Again, this is only my family&#39;s experience and opinion and<br/>
 &gt; could well be a very one-sided view. I really just wanted to get out<br/>
 &gt; the info about the FEMA web page. It is very well constructed, has<br/>
 &gt; served for coverage of many health and safety issues as my children<br/>
 &gt; have grown. For a government entity, they do okay ;-)<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; in peace,<br/>

Doesn&#39;t FEMA have the ability to run the government and enforce <br/>
marshall law in a nat&#39;l state of emergency?   I remember reading some <br/>
subversive literature a decade ago that pretty much equated FEMA with <br/>
satan, though I&#39;m sure their emergency preparedness tips are right <br/>
on.  Any thoughts? </span></blockquote></div>

&gt;&gt; I believe the American Red Cross sells kits and/or has a list of<br/>

&gt; Not a fan of the Red Cross, myself. FEMA - the Federal Emergency<br/>
&gt; Management Agency  - has a full listing of ways to prepare and lists<br/>
&gt; of supplies as well as how to assess your needs on its Community and<br/>
