<div id="ygrps-yiv-1627146335">I&#39;m always encouraging my DH to quit his job, get a closing 4 hr shift at <br/>
Starbucks for the benefits, and consider it socializing and coffee time.  <br/>
He&#39;s up til 1 every night anyway, and coffee at night doesn&#39;t mean a thing.  <br/>
And there are about five Starbucks within working distance.  Of course he <br/>
hasn&#39;t done it!  But it would provide the benefits and a little cash.</div>
