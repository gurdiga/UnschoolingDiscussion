<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038735744">Just to note...no one was addressing me with these questions,  it was I who<br/>
posed them.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Susan,<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m wondering...if you think TV watching is dangerous to children...do<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;mean &#39;all TV viewing&#39;?  ALL children?  all ages?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Children model. And they also pursue life as passionately (or<br/>
&gt; dispassionately) as their parents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were in Canada for 3 weeks and he watched it for a total of 3 hours.<br/>
&gt; He had children to play with, a fun house to visit - roasting<br/>
&gt; marshmellows on the wood stove, snowball fights with crayola modeling<br/>
&gt; clay, kids are allowed to take apart the couches and cushions for forts<br/>
&gt; as long as they get put back etc. (get the pix?) And three other children<br/>
&gt; of various ages around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; IF you can take all of them and say the kid has options, the house is<br/>
&gt; light, there are children around THEN let him watch TV. He&#39;s choosing it<br/>
&gt; as a qualified choice. Not as an escape option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>kolleen,  I love how you *demonstrate* what I was trying to explain!  that<br/>
mirrors my own experience.  When I find myself frustrated about the kidlets<br/>
seeming to spend mindless hours in front of the TV,  I find that the lack of<br/>
other opportunities a major factor.  My oldest is brginning to understand<br/>
that she sometimes turns it on from a can&#39;t-think -of anything-else-to-do<br/>
rather than an I&#39;d-really-like-to-watch-something-on-TV viewpoint.<br/>
    that&#39;s,  to me,  where unschooling is quite challenging at times from<br/>
the adult perspective.  My own creative energy ebbs and flows.....when I am<br/>
stronger,  more energetic,  and creative...we all see more choices in what<br/>
we want to do,  how well we interact,  etc.<br/>
thanks for sharing youe experience, Kolleen!<br/>
