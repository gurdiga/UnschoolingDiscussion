<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She likes the grades and the work that accompanies it. She isn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; finding it hard. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is an interesting thread.  I&#39;m thinking of my own school experience, and <br/>
the type of learner I was then and still am.  I flourished in a school <br/>
environment -- loved the challenge of shooting for grades (even in math, <br/>
which I loathed), enjoyed the personal challenge of testing well, and did a <br/>
lot of self-motivated integration of materials.  It was a game.  I liked <br/>
jumping through the hoops, and I did it well.  I look back on it now and see <br/>
that I really was a self-directed learner, even within a classroom setting.  <br/>
I remember finding baroque music to listen to while I read history from that <br/>
period...specifically looking for historical fiction from those periods to <br/>
enrich the textbook experience...really getting into debate with my teachers <br/>
about alternative views of several different subjects...rocking the boat, in <br/>
other words.  Not all of the teachers liked this, but some did, and I didn&#39;t <br/>
much care anyway.  I was having a good time.<br/>
<br/>
If I had had the opportunity and the support, I would have been a candidate <br/>
for unschooling, but as it was, I made the best of a limited situation.<br/>
<br/>
There have been several other excellent points made in this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But, again, it&#39;s the motivations, not the actions that define unschooling.<br/>
If a child is certain they need a teacher to learn something, then they<br/>
aren&#39;t making that decision based on unschooling principles but on fear<br/>
instilled by society.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think this point is dead on.  My own schooling experience was positive IN <br/>
SPITE OF the institutional setting because I have somehow always been a <br/>
self-directed learner.  My dad gave that gift to me (bless him, since he <br/>
didn&#39;t give me much else.)  I was relatively free of the socially proscribed <br/>
sense that I had to do it THEIR way -- except, as I said, in math.  For me, <br/>
the teachers were as useful as their ability to get out of the way and let me <br/>
go with the material.  They were there to bounce ideas off of, the good ones. <br/>
 It was a partnership.  That&#39;s what I hope to do for my son as we unschool <br/>
now.  Get out of his way and let his own internal magic happen.  Obviously, <br/>
it&#39;s much more efficient to do this at home than in school, especially these <br/>
days, what with all the extra stuff they have to *teach.*<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;How can a person by definition be unschooling in school? That is ludicrous <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to <br/>
me.<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
Unschooling is not only an attitude and philosophy, it also mean NOT <br/>
schooling, at school, or at home.<br/>
<br/>
Ren&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I have to agree with these statements.  While I may have been, by and large, <br/>
a self-directed learner in school, I was never completely free of societal <br/>
and institutional restraints and expectations, despite my rebellious nature.  <br/>
Not all of my teacher/student relationships were positive -- not by a long <br/>
shot.  I may have been self-directed, mainly, but I was in no way an <br/>
unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think the *process* of discussing whether someone can unschool at school<br/>
 </span></blockquote>can be illuminating. Exploring the borders of an idea can help us better<br/>
understand its core because it gives us the opportunity to look at things<br/>
from a very different point of view.<br/>
<br/>
But I think pinning down and labeling something at the fringe is just<br/>
confusing because the *action* isn&#39;t unschooling and labeling that action as<br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t clarify the definition of unschooling for anyone. It<br/>
just muddies it.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Right on.  The label, unschooling, just doesn&#39;t fit in this scenario, no <br/>
matter how much we might want it to.  Again, as Ren said, though, there is a <br/>
big difference between *going to school* and taking classes that interest the <br/>
child and which are initiated by that child.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;There&#39;s a book by Grace Llewellyn and Amy Silver called Guerilla<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Learning: How to Give Your Kids a Real Education With or Without School.<br/>
I&#39;d recommend it to any unschooler whose child is thinking of going to<br/>
school or is already there.  On page 33, they say, &quot;While we are not<br/>
generally in favor of war, we liked the &#39;guerrilla&#39; image of a nimble,<br/>
zealous, loosely organized group of kids educating themselves &#39;beneath<br/>
the radar&#39; of the dominant school paradigm.  The power of guerrilla<br/>
force lies in their passion and flexibility.  Dedication to a shared<br/>
vision of freedom allows guerrillas to resist much bigger,<br/>
better-funded, and better-organized forces.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorcha&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I laughed when I read this because it so closely defined my own school <br/>
experience (25+ years ago!)  I&#39;ve read Llewellyn&#39;s TLH, but not this one.  If <br/>
we need a label for *unschooling at school,* why not adapt her phrase?  <br/>
Guerilla schooling?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that if my son decided to go back to school, I would respect his <br/>
decision, once I felt he had thought it through.  But I would hope that he <br/>
would go in with a sense of internal rebellion and independence.  I could see <br/>
him being quite good guerilla -- now.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-924618012">I&#39;m trying to come up with an analogy because sometimes it&#39;s helpful to<br/>
think of things from a different angle.  If I spend a whole pregnancy<br/>
read about homebirth and talking to women about homebirth, but when<br/>
labor starts, I decide that I should go straight to the hospital, am I a<br/>
homebirther?  <br/>
 <br/>
What if the topic was breastfeeding?  What if I wanted to consider<br/>
myself an extended nurser because I&#39;ve read about how children in other<br/>
countries breastfeed until they&#39;re seven?  What if I nursed for a few<br/>
weeks and the baby didn&#39;t really seem into it, but he took to a bottle<br/>
right away?  Since he &quot;chose&quot; bottlefeeding even though I support<br/>
breastfeeding, can I still be an extended nurser?  (I do realize that<br/>
it&#39;s not an entirely fair example for older kids.  I think of a 5 yr old<br/>
choosing school as an uninformed choice - they might have just seen it<br/>
on Sesame Street or Blues Clues and it looked like fun.  With a 15 yr<br/>
old, it&#39;s more of a choice)<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think you can homebirth in a hospital, I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
extended nurse with a bottle of Similac, and I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
unschool while sitting in your assigned seat in your third-period World<br/>
History class, listening to someone drone on about King-someone-or-other<br/>
while you&#39;re still thinking about the poem you were trying to write last<br/>
period.  I learned far more outside of school than I ever did in school,<br/>
but I wasn&#39;t unschooled.  My dad&#39;s an artist and I tagged along to<br/>
museums, art shows, Art Association meetings, films about Van Gogh.  I<br/>
also had a set of Childcraft encyclopedias that I would read over and<br/>
over in my bedroom.  I explored the woods outside my home, and followed<br/>
my grandfather around when he was gardening.  When I went to school, my<br/>
dad told me that to succeed in school, all I had to do was follow the<br/>
instructions and give the teacher the answer s/he wanted.  He told me it<br/>
didn&#39;t matter if what they were saying was complete nonsense, just<br/>
parrot it back as closely as you can for the test and don&#39;t let it<br/>
interfere with your life.  I became very good at school, even though I<br/>
was learning far more in my out-of-school life.  But I wasn&#39;t<br/>
unschooled.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555508293">My 5 yo daughter is in kindergarten (at her request) 14 hours/week.<br/>
A few weeks ago I would have been offended if someone told me I <br/>
wasn&#39;t unschooling, because I felt that it really was her decision, <br/>
and she was empowered by that.  I ask her everyday if she wants to go <br/>
to school, and she used to always say yes. Lately she&#39;s been <br/>
saying, &quot;no, I want to be homeschooled today&quot; (I haven&#39;t explained <br/>
the unschooling label, but she has friends that are homeschooled and <br/>
their days look very different from ours).<br/>
<br/>
On those days, and on weekends we spend our day in child-led <br/>
activities, she calls them science days because the bulk of the day <br/>
is spent investigating nature, space, etc.  She says, &quot;you don&#39;t <br/>
teach me anything, my mind teaches me, I homeschool myself&quot;. She is <br/>
starting to see that she doesn&#39;t learn anything at school (though <br/>
they don&#39;t really teach anything, it&#39;s a Waldorf-based school and <br/>
they just free-play and make bread, though they do have some open-<br/>
ended projects). <br/>
 <br/>
On unschooling days, I feel like we are living in the present moment <br/>
and are really connected with life, our minds and our hearts.  On <br/>
days she goes to school she often seems dissconnected, like <br/>
she &#39;checked out&#39; at some point.<br/>
<br/>
After these experiences I know what unschooling is really about and I <br/>
have to say I can&#39;t call ourselves unschoolers.  She still wants to <br/>
stay in school, though I have a strong feeling that we won&#39;t be <br/>
returning next year (yeah!).  So right now we don&#39;t have the label of <br/>
unschoolers, but I don&#39;t care, she sought out school for a reason, <br/>
and she seems to have to have the experience of school before she can <br/>
appreciate unschooling.  <br/>
We all choose our own paths, and as parents we need to respect that, <br/>
even if it includes school.  It&#39;s not our choice to make. Forced <br/>
unschooling may still be unschooling, but it is not right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704037348">I guess what I&#39;ve been pondering is the difference between unschooling (the method) and unschooling (the philosophy).  <br/>
<br/>
Although trusting kids to choose is definitely respectful parenting, it is also tied up with unschooling in general, simply because successful unschooling actually depends on trusting a child to choose.  The two really can&#39;t be separated for unschooling to work.<br/>
<br/>
But I agree, in terms of method, school is school, not unschooling.  And there are definitely subtle (and not so subtle) messages given to the students on a daily basis that wholly contradict what unschooling is all about.  Because of that, the two are diametrically opposed to each other, even if we choose to be there.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think you can homebirth in a hospital, I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
extended nurse with a bottle of Similac, and I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
unschool while sitting in your assigned seat in your third-period World<br/>
History class, listening to someone drone on about King-someone-or-other<br/>
while you&#39;re still thinking about the poem you were trying to write last<br/>
period.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I learned far more outside of school than I ever did in school,<br/>
but I wasn&#39;t unschooled. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with me.<br/>
