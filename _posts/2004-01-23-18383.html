&lt;&lt; As to Viggo...I could have some REALLY hot dreams about that man. He is SO <br/>
completely sexy. wow. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a movie with him in you might really like called American Yakuza.<br/>
It&#39;s a kind of mafia movie and bloody in places, but he plays an interesting <br/>
character and is in it throughout.   Not a chick flick.   Good nobility scene, <br/>
but pretty much too rough for me to watch again.<br/>
<br/>
He has a minor but speaking part (and some meaningful eye-contact bits) in <br/>
Witness.<br/>
