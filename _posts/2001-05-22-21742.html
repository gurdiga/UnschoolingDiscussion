<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For all of you who have always unschooled your kids, I&#39;m curious about the<br/>
&gt; mechanics of how they learned to read. Did they pick it up on their own from<br/>
&gt; having watched and listened to you, or did you use some sort of program when<br/>
&gt; they indicated that they were ready?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter read fluently well before her fourth birthday.  No<br/>
evident &quot;sounding out&quot; of words, but she could somehow read words I wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have thought she&#39;d had opportunity to sight-learn.  She read with expression<br/>
even then.  She&#39;s just wired for language somehow.  It came quite naturally<br/>
to her.  I did read to her a lot, we watched Sesame Street together, made up<br/>
word games because that&#39;s what she liked.  No teaching.  She just read.  Has<br/>
never *had* phonics.  She&#39;s also writing a lot now, at 11.  Her spelling is<br/>
pretty good and I think she usually realizes on her own when she makes<br/>
spelling errors.  Not sure though, because she doesn&#39;t show me much of what<br/>
she writes.  I have no idea what&#39;s in all of those journals.<br/>
<br/>
My middle daughter *said* she couldn&#39;t read up until this year, and she&#39;s 8.<br/>
She actually could read a few words, but I she didn&#39;t really get that what<br/>
she&#39;s doing is reading until this year.  That realization came to her while<br/>
playing Gameboy--pokemon, I think.  She suddenly got that she knew what the<br/>
words on the screen were.  Very cool moment.  We haven&#39;t &quot;done&quot; phonics<br/>
either, though I offered several times when I realized she wanted to learn<br/>
to read.  She did read some Bob books to me last year--I just this moment<br/>
remembered that, and she thought that was cool too, but she knew those were<br/>
words that were chosen to be really easy, and it didn&#39;t mean the same thing<br/>
to her that reading the Gameboy screen did, where she was reading for<br/>
information.  <br/>
<br/>
My son, who just turned 5 isn&#39;t reading at all, and in fact there are a few<br/>
letters he still confuses.  He can spell &quot;aardvark,&quot; though, picked up from<br/>
watching Arthur on PBS.  ;-)  He likes to ask me to spell things and tells<br/>
me, &quot;correct&quot; or &quot;incorrect.&quot;  He likes Mr. Ratburn, obviously.  A few weeks<br/>
ago, my PS&#39;ed 10 year old nephew got into an argument with him, insisting<br/>
that &quot;a-a-r-d-v-a-r-k&quot; was incorrect.  &lt;g&gt;.  Charlie&#39;s sisters backed him<br/>
up, and the cousin still didn&#39;t believe them until his mom said,  &quot;Yes, a<br/>
word can start with AA and aardvark does.  :-D  If Charlie reads late, I<br/>
don&#39;t think I&#39;ll freak out or anything because I&#39;ve already watched one<br/>
child who swore she couldn&#39;t read and was at the beginning of some real<br/>
frustration about it--and who adamantly did not want lessons--simply pick up<br/>
the skills when she was ready.<br/>
<br/>
If I could explain the mechanics of my children learning to read, I would,<br/>
but for us, it&#39;s been internal process I haven&#39;t really been privy to.  We<br/>
have tons of books, tv, video games, and I read to them (less for every<br/>
child, though--less time on my part, less interest on their parts--the<br/>
younger ones were more interested in keeping up with the other kids than<br/>
sitting still with me) and they see me reading for information and pleasure<br/>
and writing a great deal.  That&#39;s about it.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I can&#39;t shed more light about specifics.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I did read to her a lot, we watched Sesame Street together, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I forgot to credit TV and video.  Sesame Street, Animaniacs, Disney <br/>
Singalongs (with words going by which they can ignore, but after you see it <br/>
over and over, maybe the words are more interesting to look at).  Some of the <br/>
things they liked involved interpersonals more than reading/language--Mr. <br/>
Rogers, Muppet Babies, Ninja Turtles.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays Holly watches Between the Lions a fair amount (and calls me for <br/>
Chicken Jane, which it totally reading, but it&#39;s spoofing the Dick and Jane <br/>
books with dead-on art (only animated) and a cool theme song.  And they have <br/>
Gawain&#39;s Word (combo Wayne&#39;s World theme song and a kind of Electric Company <br/>
or Sesame Street moment where the front of a word and the end come together).<br/>
<br/>
I have never, and I recommend to all here very strongly they they not either, <br/>
ever said &quot;Oh, good!  Now you are learning to read!  This is like the lessons <br/>
in school only look--it&#39;s funny, and there&#39;s music!  Now lovely for us all <br/>
and God Bless Unschooling.&quot;   When you get teachery or condescending you <br/>
break the spell.<br/>
