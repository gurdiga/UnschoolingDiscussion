Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This is a message that I sent to the national financial aid officers email<br/>
list this evening, in response to the message posted by Nathan Richman of<br/>
the HSLDA to the financial aid officers list last week.<br/>

<br/>
To the list:<br/>
<br/>
No organization in homeschooling &quot;has its act together&quot; as well as does<br/>
the Homeschool Legal Defense Association (HSLDA). No homeschooling<br/>
organization is as professional, media and politically savvy, nor as<br/>
economically sound. The HSLDA is, however, not the authoritative voice of<br/>
homeschooling. They are an authoritative voice for, and of, some in<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Because most of us in higher education are ignorant of the realities of<br/>
homeschooling, it&#39;s important to point out that the The National Center<br/>
for Home Education (NCHE), a division of HSLDA, which networks state-wide<br/>
organizations in all 50 states, only networks organizations built upon<br/>
local groups the majority of which generally require a statement of<br/>
religious faith as a condition of membership. The tenets of these<br/>
statements of faith substantively eliminate non-Christians, theologically<br/>
observant Catholics, some Protestants, secular humanists, and Mormons<br/>
among others. And this exclusionism is reflected in the HSLDA web site<br/>
which doesn&#39;t refer to state groups other than those seemingly built on<br/>
statements of faith.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents who have no interest in the theological and political views<br/>
of the HSLDA or these state groups, or who are ignorant of them, join the<br/>
HSLDA for the legal protection which it can provide, and therefore are<br/>
counted as committed members of the HSLDA for statistical purposes.<br/>
<br/>
The political and religious views of the HSLDA probably represent a<br/>
significantly large plurality of homeschool families. But, at the present<br/>
time, the largest growing segment (by percentage of growth) of<br/>
homeschoolers are probably those who start to homeschool for non-religious<br/>
reasons - perhaps a Columbine type of reaction is the reason, or a<br/>
perception of a poor education in public schools coupled with an inability<br/>
of the parents to afford a private or parochial school education.<br/>
<br/>
The HSLDA has done many really important things such as their involvement<br/>
in the recent redefinition of the conditions under which homeschooled<br/>
students can receive aid. They are constructing Patrick Henry, a college<br/>
in Virginia for homeschooled students - with a law school - which is<br/>
intended to train up a Godly generation of students to gradually move into<br/>
positions of political influence.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for us in higher education, and for many homeschool parents,<br/>
there is no national group to whom one can turn in a busy day that can be<br/>
said to represent the non-HSLDA constituencies, which are often fractious<br/>
to the point of irrelevancy when it comes to financial aid and admissions<br/>
issues. There are many local groups, there are some effective state<br/>
organizations, but aside from the HSLDA and the NCHE network, there is no<br/>
homeschool group today which has the expertise and economic base to<br/>
address financial aid and admissions issues on a national and regional<br/>
basis in a consistent and timely fashion, especially now when<br/>
homeschooling is becoming such a hot issue. It&#39;s a big problem. There is,<br/>
however, the beginning of a new inclusive national homeschool<br/>
communications network, the National Home Education Network (NHEN), which<br/>
is attempting to set up an inclusive communications and resource network.<br/>
It remains to be seen if this will have long term viability.<br/>
<br/>
The HSLDA&#39;s positions clearly are not universally admired in<br/>
homeschooling. Nor are its partisan political stances. Much of the<br/>
research it sponsors is based in a segment of homeschoolers and doesn&#39;t<br/>
reflect the diversity of homeschooling and so the research conclusions<br/>
which are drawn must be understood in context. Many homeschoolers don&#39;t<br/>
feel comfortable with the HSLDA&#39;s approach to testing, standards, and<br/>
pedagogy. Lastly, many homeschoolers feel that the HSLDA&#39;s intervention in<br/>
legal issues in certain states has on occasion been misguided, short<br/>
sighted, or partisan, acting not as true representatives of all<br/>
homeschoolers, but just of those who are truly confirmed members of<br/>
National Center for Home Education groups.<br/>
<br/>
When dealing with homeschooling, it&#39;s always important to have more than<br/>
one source for information because how things are presented are often<br/>
conditioned by the ideological underpinnings of the source. For instance,<br/>
when looking at state laws governing homeschooling, in addition to<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hslda.org">http://www.hslda.org</a>&gt; it might be a good idea to also use<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nhen.org/legnet/index.html">http://nhen.org/legnet/index.html</a>&gt; for the sake of comparison.<br/>
<br/>
The HSLDA doesn&#39;t represent homeschoolers in general even though one might<br/>
gain that impression from HSLDA press releases. And since the HSLDA/NCHE<br/>
point of view and agenda is anathema to many in homeschooling, the<br/>
limitations of this viewpoint on issues affecting homeschooling cannot be<br/>
effectively understood in a context in which the critical faculties are<br/>
suspended.<br/>
