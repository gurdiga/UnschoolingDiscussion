<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145105552">We&#39;ve been homeschooling for almost 3 years, but we really just started <br/>
unschooling a few months ago.  I have an unschooling moment to share.  <br/>
<br/>
I bought a cookbook for cooking with kids.  I thought it would be fun to try <br/>
some kid-friendly recipes and maybe get some kid interest in the process.  My <br/>
almost 8 year old son was very excited, although he&#39;s never shown more than a <br/>
passing interest in working in the kitchen.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I couldn&#39;t find my cup measure when I needed it, and I asked my son how <br/>
many 1/2 cups I&#39;d need, and he said 2, Duh Mom.  He was making a bread recipe <br/>
that required that he cut canned biscuits into quarters.  So he started <br/>
cutting them in half then in half again, just like he was supposed to.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t need to tell him.  I asked him how he knew, and he told me that <br/>
quarters means 1/4 which is 4 pieces.   <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve really never talked about fractions at all, and I was a bit surprised <br/>
that he knew this.  I remember fractions being such a struggle in school.  Of <br/>
course, algebra isn&#39;t quite as intuitive, but I guess my point is, if you <br/>
make it hard, it will be hard.  If you make it life, maybe it comes as <br/>
naturally as life does.<br/>
