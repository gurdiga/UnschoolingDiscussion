<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786464979">From: &quot;Karen McLaughlin&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:karenmcl@...">karenmcl@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We&#39;re working on finding some<br/>
&gt;homeschooled friends (there aren&#39;t a great many unschoolers around here)<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;the local homeschool drop-in which we attend sporadically hasn&#39;t led to any<br/>
&gt;new friendships yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One thing I&#39;d say that I&#39;ve noticed in our homeschooling group is that the<br/>
kids who regularly attend lots of events end up knowing each other more,<br/>
establishing deeper friendships, and inviting each other over more. I guess<br/>
it&#39;s a question of familiarity more than anything. New kids are definitely<br/>
welcomed into our group, but I can see that it takes time before the kids<br/>
who know each other well have figured out who the new kid is, how they like<br/>
to play, and which of the kids generally ends up being more compatible with<br/>
them for individual playdates. That&#39;s hard to do on an occasional basis.<br/>
Most of Mackenzie&#39;s good friends now he has been playing with for over 2<br/>
years at various homeschooling events.<br/>
So if you&#39;re looking to find friends for regular get-togethers and<br/>
playdates, you might want to try attending consistently and letting him get<br/>
to know the other kids better. That might spark some new friendships more<br/>
easily.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>together<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;since infancy or toddlerhood) and I&#39;m hoping there will be some way to<br/>
&gt;maintain these friendships despite school but I sense there may be a lot of<br/>
&gt;difficulties ahead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hope you have better luck than we have. Mackenzie says he no longer wants to<br/>
play with his two good neighborhood friends. They both went to kindergarten<br/>
this year and it really changed everything.<br/>
