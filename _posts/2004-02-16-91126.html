<br/>
This is child-led learning, meaning the children&#39;s interests dictate what <br/>
they learn. This philosophy comes from Rousseau&#39;s book, Emile. The late John Holt <br/>
also popularized the idea in his homeschooling books. The families that <br/>
choose this approach are homeschooling because they believe that traditional <br/>
methods of education stifle children&#39;s creativity and zest for learning. The online <br/>
interview ofSandra Doddhelps explain what unschooling can be if a parent can <br/>
relax and enjoy it. I wasn&#39;t able to deal with the uncertainty myself.<br/>

I doubt the philosophy comes from any one book, but it&#39;s an interesting <br/>
assertion.  I&#39;d rather think it came from something I had at least read.  <br/>
Slapstick, or Candide or something.  Did anyone read Emile and want to tell us how it <br/>
changed all our lives?<br/>
<br/>
But as I&#39;m cited and linked,  I&#39;m able to deal with the uncertainty.<br/>
<br/>
(I do think the middle part is true about stifling and zest.)<br/>

  =========================================================<br/>
<br/>
Rousseau&#39;s _Emile_ is not even close to unschooling. It&#39;s manipulative, prescriptive and incredibly mysogenistic. If you feel like slogging through it go ahead; it&#39;s rather eye opening. Instead, _Emile_ serves as the foundation of liberal education--the kind we see in public schools and universities all across the US. The whole purpose is to educate Emile into a true citizen.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely *NOT* unschooling! Sandra, yes. Emile, no! *g*<br/>
