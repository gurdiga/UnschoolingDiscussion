<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000421656">I don&#39;t mind story telling.  I like it.  The more a story is about  <br/>
learning or parenting the better.<br/>
<br/>
Stories about school and relationships with parents are not nearly as  <br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
I like stories that are carefully factual and well thought out.    <br/>
While it&#39; can be therapeutic to journal one&#39;s immediate feelings, it&#39;s  <br/>
not therapeutic for this group to read them.  If anyone has joined  <br/>
since I last mentioned this. the list has well over 1000 readers (plus  <br/>
some old leftover accounts, putting Yahoogroups official count at  <br/>
2085.   There aren&#39;t that many reading every post.  There are hundreds  <br/>
of people reading every post, though, so don&#39;t post emotional  <br/>
outpourings.  Post things that will help readers understand  <br/>
unschooling, or that will ask a question or present a situation that  <br/>
can be discussed here.<br/>
<br/>
Trim your posts.  Don&#39;t append two or three posts.  Don&#39;t even append  <br/>
one whole post.<br/>
<br/>
Gratitude is wonderful, but it&#39;s okay to be grateful without posting  <br/>
&quot;thanks!&quot; to the group.  It&#39;s much better to bask in the warmth of  <br/>
gratitude while you play with your kids.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve averaged over 25 posts a day this year so far.   Let&#39;s let the  <br/>
average of great posts be high too.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes here agitated and is sent links and the person  <br/>
continues to respond without having read those links, it&#39;s a little  <br/>
like offering a relative to discuss something after they&#39;ve read about  <br/>
unschooling, and then them say &quot;Yeah, but...&quot;   Read the links people  <br/>
send you about making choices and thinking about food.  And not school- <br/>
style, where you open the book to that page and turn the page when you  <br/>
see other people turn the page.   The links at Joyce&#39;s site and mine  <br/>
are the greatest hits of the past ten or twelve unschooling discussion  <br/>
years.  If you can&#39;t be bothered to read the really great stuff,  <br/>
please just read here and don&#39;t write for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Going gradually into unschooling and being mindful are being missed by  <br/>
some of those newer to unschooling.   Please, everyone, take a look at  <br/>
these two pages.   People who don&#39;t know why should look the  <br/>
longest.   Those who do know why might want to look to see what could  <br/>
be added in way of link or clarification.<br/>
