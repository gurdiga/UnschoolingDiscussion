<div id="ygrps-yiv-802874174"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Over the holidays, the news kept flashing that shot of the guy arrested <br/>
&gt;for attempting to blow up a Paris flight. I asked dsister how she would <br/>
&gt;have reacted if she had seen him on one of her flights. (I know this gets <br/>
&gt;into discrimination... I call it instinct). She said she would have viewed <br/>
&gt;him with great suspicion and never hesitates to let the pilots know of <br/>
&gt;suspicious looking people on her flights.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t catch a pix of the paris guy, so i don&#39;t know what you mean <br/>

I think the doctor in my story wasn&#39;t worried of them being arab, he was <br/>
worried becasue they were cajoling together then split apart as if they <br/>
didn&#39;t know eachother.<br/>
<br/>
I would of been suspicious also regardless of what they looked like. Its <br/>
just not a natural scene.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

It wasn&#39;t that he was Arab (I don&#39;t think he was)... it had more to do with an dishoveled appearance rather than a race issue. He was travelling overseas without any luggage. He bought a one-way ticket. Things were stacking up to make him look very suspect.<br/>

suspicious.  I&#39;m just amazed at how lax security was in his case.  It&#39;s <br/>
very fortunate that the folks on board were on the ball.  And now they&#39;re <br/>
saying he was just testing, preparing the way for more sophisticated <br/>
attempts.  I&#39;m perfectly happy to stay on the ground.<br/>
