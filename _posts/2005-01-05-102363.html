&gt;  Some of my favorites are Triominos, Blokus, Upwords, Sequence. We <br/>
 </span></blockquote>got a few new ones at Christmas but haven&#39;t cut into all of them <br/>
yet. Also, my kids get a big bang out of making up their own games. <br/>
For instance, I called out a word and one of them is to write it on <br/>
an index card, and I keep repeating this with the theme of them <br/>
being able to create compound words when they are all done writing <br/>
out the cards. My youngest caught on to this before we even started <br/>
to put them together.  Another thing that came up was again my <br/>
youngest was on the computer typing in giant numbers and printing <br/>
them off. He was proud of this achievement, so I had him mount them <br/>
on index cards. Now we can make up different number games like what <br/>
are the odd or evens, add this and that to get what, type of <br/>
questions. <br/>

Encore.<br/>
We have the old one, but there&#39;s a new one as of a year and some ago.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote some about it here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320460599">We got two new Binary Arts/Think Fun games for Christmas.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wonderbrains.com/page/wb/CTGY/games-all">http://www.wonderbrains.com/page/wb/CTGY/games-all</a><br/>
<br/>
 We already had Rush Hour Traffic Jam, which we love, and now we have Shape<br/>
By Shape and Brick By Brick.  They are logic games that you play<br/>
individually, but we take pleasure in competing against each other some<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We also got Horseopoly for Christmas.  We already had Whoville-opoly, but we<br/>
like Monopoly games.  The horse one is a fun version with the cheaper<br/>
properties being ponies and on up, until you get to the expensive<br/>
properties, which are draft horses.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We also got a new game called Horse Race.  The amount you pay (bet) is times<br/>
1, time 2, times 3 or times 4, depending on what number you roll.  Gives us<br/>
all a chance to practice multiplying and it&#39;s fun to win a load of play<br/>
money.  (you can play with real money too, if you like.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Five Kings is still on my want list.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We planned on going to my sister&#39;s house on New Year&#39;s Eve to play Texas<br/>
Hold Em.  The kids were worried about feeling left out because they didn&#39;t<br/>
know how to play, so I gave them a crash course on Poker the day before we<br/>
went.  Both girls played and did very well.  There were 11 people who played<br/>
at $2 a person.  My 8 yo came home with $20 in winnings.  (home school math,<br/>
LOL!)  She put the money towards another riding lesson.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354804505">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My kids are really into a new game (?) called Flip and Find <br/>
(although not necessarily a board game).  It&#39;s a scavenger hunt game <br/>
and you use magazines to find pictures of the items on the cards.  <br/>
For instance, items on the cards might be as generic as &quot;find a belt <br/>
buckle&quot; to teenybop questions, like &quot;find a cute guy wearing <br/>
jeans&quot;.  It&#39;s a fast flip game and first that hits the buzzer wins <br/>
the card.  Well, this is how I understand the game anyway...my kids <br/>
have only let me play once for a short time because &quot;I stink&quot; at it <br/>
and I slow them down!  But they have a blast playing together.<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking you could probably make this game yourself using <br/>
index cards, a bell and a good stack of magazines.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-209610490">My 12yo daughter Sarah and I had a lot of fun playing Blokus with two other <br/>
moms at our most recent game day. Strategy, visualization, and it&#39;s pretty to <br/>
boot. The box insert to hold the pieces is frustratingly flimsy, good thing the <br/>
board is plenty sturdy. <br/>
<br/>
Gobblet has been a favorite since Pat   talked me into buying it from the <br/>
Manhattan Children&#39;s Museum gift shop two years ago. It&#39;s deceptively simple, <br/>
like tic tac toe. I&#39;m really good at strategy games, not so strong apparently on <br/>
some kinds of visualization. Sarah beats me at this game most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Quarto we found at a thrift store a while back and it&#39;s become a regular. <br/>
Players choose the piece their opponent must place on the board - a real strategy <br/>
twister.<br/>
<br/>
Sarah has taken Mad Dash to every Fun Club day the last few months, she&#39;s <br/>
having a competition of sorts with an older teen boy there, they play at least a <br/>
few rounds every week. Deck of 50 cards each with a state name, the object is <br/>
to make the longest trail you can from state to state in three minutes. Alaska <br/>
and Hawaii are wild cards you can use in place of a missing state in your <br/>
half of the deck. Extra points for going coast to coast. States score points <br/>
based on how many neighbors they have - Maine is a high value because you can only <br/>
go from there to one other state, Kentucky has many ways in and out so low <br/>
value. <br/>
<br/>
We collect games, they&#39;re everywhere in the house right now. My sister comes <br/>
for Christmas and spends at least half her time here playing games with my <br/>
kids. :)<br/>

Fun Club...<br/>
That&#39;s a good name for a group.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Goof Group&quot; was ours years ago, but Fun Club sounds more uplifting.<br/>
Less goofy.<br/>
