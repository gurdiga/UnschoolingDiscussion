totally radical unschooler.  &lt;&lt;<br/>

All the Holt books,  old GWS newsletters........I find reading helpful at<br/>
times,  but I have found really opening my eyes, ears, etc and really<br/>
experiencing adventures (these include &quot;ordinary days&quot;) with your family<br/>
will solidify your views.  I would suggest doing both.     Make sure you<br/>
observe your own possible tendencies to try to &quot;teach&quot;...what happens?  How<br/>
do your children reeact?  What&#39;s something they&#39;ve learned that you&#39;ve had<br/>
no part of?   (E.G.,  when our oldest was about 4,  she would have this<br/>
pondering look on her face often on little trips here and there in the<br/>
car.....turns out she was figuring out addition..you could practically see<br/>
the lightbulbs popping off as she discovered the relationships between<br/>
number names and quantities of items!)    you never really know what&#39;s going<br/>
on in their minds,  but if you pay attention,  you&#39;ll realize it&#39;s a great<br/>
deal.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I have to comment on Christian unschooling.  I&#39;m a Christian and I&#39;m <br/>
an unschooler.  However, there aren&#39;t any good resources out there <br/>
that I&#39;ve seen that are specifically for the Christian unschooler.  <br/>
The Christian Unschooling book is good for helping Abeka <br/>
homeschoolers relax, but it&#39;s more about relaxed or ecclectic <br/>
homeschooling as opposed to unschooling.  It talks about unit studies <br/>
and stuff.  Christian unschooling lists also are usually more relaxed <br/>
homeschooling lists.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know that.  I was really hoping some of those were seriously <br/>
unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Still, to be around all Christians would be a comfort sometimes, I bet.  It <br/>
might not be fun to be the most radical unschooler and have to sit through <br/>
much discussion how to get kids to finish their work, though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry there aren&#39;t better Christian unschooling resources.  <br/>
