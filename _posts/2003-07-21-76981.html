 </span></blockquote>Rue, Jason(dh) suggests that you look into the &#39;lost wax method&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I googled &#39;lost wax method silver&#39; and got a bunch of results, if you <br/>
do just &#39;lost wax method&#39; you get a lot more, but they deal mostly <br/>
with brass, although Jason say&#39;s that the principle is the same with <br/>
brass and silver<br/>

<br/>
this site looks pretty good.<br/>
<br/>
If you have any more questions let me/us know. Jason loves to work <br/>
with metal and is willing to awnser any questions.<br/>
<br/>
We both know a lot about stones too, so if you have any quetions on <br/>
those too feel free.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624307601">Thank you Rebecca and Jason!  I will look into this.  Are there any books<br/>
you guys would recommend on working with metals?  What kinds of things does<br/>
Jason make?<br/>
<br/>
I do have a kind of random stone question too.  What color chalcedony is<br/>
&#39;best&#39; quality?  (If you don&#39;t know I&#39;ll google - it&#39;s just something I&#39;ve<br/>
been wondering.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for answering :0).   ~Rue<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure if this is what you are looking for...<br/>
 <br/>
Chalcedony is considered as a member of the quartz family. It is either transparent, traslucent, or opaque. It occasionally containes small amounts of opal.<br/>
 <br/>
Some of the many types of chalcedony include agate, bloodstoe, chysoprase, carnelian, chert, flint, jasper, onyx, sardonyx, touchstone, and petrified wood.<br/>
 <br/>
Chysoprase is concidered to be &#39;best quality&#39; chalcedony<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;The best quality material is a rich &#39;apple&#39; green, homogeneous, translucent, chalcedony which is used as a simulant for rare and highly prized Imperial Green Jadite.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It is often called and sold as &#39;Australian Jade&#39;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll ask Jason when he gets home what books he would recomend, as far as the silver casting goes.<br/>
 <br/>
We have both been doing a lot of wire wrapping lately and Jason used to work in metals a lot when he was doing iron work and had acess to the equipment. He&#39;s doing a lot of gem cutting right now. <br/>
