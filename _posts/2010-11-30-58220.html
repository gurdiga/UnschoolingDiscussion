<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571648206">There are a ton of these stories out there, on Sandra&#39;s page, and from other<br/>
people, but I wanted to chime in, because I&#39;ve been on the deschooling path<br/>
for almost a year now, and a couple of things happened in our family this<br/>
week that I thought would be fun to share for people still deschooling (I<br/>
know I am, so it&#39;s good for me to get these reminders, too).<br/>
<br/>
One (letting go): my ten-year-old step-son has always hated writing.  His<br/>
first four/five years of formal education consisted of traditional,<br/>
school-at-home, curriculum-based, heavy-duty<br/>
sit-at-your-desk-and-pay-attention WORK.  We started backing off all that<br/>
last year at this time.  Slowly, through the year, I have deconstructed his<br/>
schooling environment.  We&#39;ve changed a lot at our house: parenting<br/>
interactions, activities, following his passions, etc.  There&#39;s been a lot<br/>
more to it than that, and it&#39;s all been very intentional, but that&#39;s a topic<br/>
for another post.  I&#39;ve had a lot of pressure from the people around us (his<br/>
grandmother, primarily, who used to teach him) to make sure he&#39;s &quot;doing what<br/>
he&#39;s supposed to.&quot;  I mostly ignore all that.  We haven&#39;t done ANY formal<br/>
writing lessons (reports, grammar, spelling, journaling, etc.) or anything<br/>
like that for over a year.  I&#39;m a big writer.  I always have a journal with<br/>
me, and I like jotting down notes and lists and stuff.  Over this past year,<br/>
I have really let go of the idea that J has to write, or be taught how to<br/>
write, or be taught how to enjoy writing.  He can write, and be understood<br/>
through writing, but we no longer make him write.  If he wants to, he can,<br/>
and if he asks for help, we give it, gladly.  But we just don&#39;t talk about<br/>
it or worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, we were all sitting around doing our own thing (it was a lazy<br/>
Sunday), and kind of enjoying the cozy living room, with the Christmas<br/>
decorations recently up.  J ran into the other room, where we have a shelf<br/>
full of empty notebooks, pencils, pens, crayons, markers, art stuff, books<br/>
with craft ideas, etc., and grabbed an empty notebook.  He scurried up onto<br/>
the couch with his pencil and notebook, and cuddled in a throw, and started<br/>
scribbling in the notebook.  I didn&#39;t pay a whole lot of attention, but<br/>
noticed he looked pretty content.  A little while later, he said, &quot;D, you<br/>
know what I&#39;m doing?&quot;  I said, &quot;What?&quot;  He said, &quot;I&#39;m writing all the stuff<br/>
that happened today, and all the stuff that happened yesterday, like you<br/>
always do.  And then I&#39;m going to make a list of things to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could have knocked me over.  It was like he had discovered that he could<br/>
keep track of things by writing them down -- all by himself.  And he was so<br/>
pleased.  I said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s cool,&quot; nonchalantly.  And I really feel like<br/>
I&#39;ve let go of the underlying voice that wants to say, &quot;Oh, sweet, we can<br/>
turn this into a language arts lesson!&quot;  If he never picks up the notebook<br/>
again, that&#39;s fine.  Or if he leaves it laying around for a couple weeks and<br/>
then rediscovers it, that&#39;s okay, too.  His dad doesn&#39;t write, or get<br/>
anything from writing, so...if J does, that&#39;s cool that he&#39;s discovered it.<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t, that&#39;s really okay.<br/>
<br/>
Two (regarding TV and connections):  we&#39;ve taken all limits off TV, not that<br/>
we had a lot to begin with, but I definitely was carrying around some<br/>
concerns about my babies (20 months and 6 months) having too much<br/>
screen-time.  I&#39;ve dropped all that.  My 20 month old loves The Wiggles and<br/>
Barney, and we play the same episodes over and over and over on Netflix for<br/>
her.  Sometimes she sits mesmerized watching, sometimes she plays at other<br/>
things with it in the background, only stopping to dance to her favorite<br/>
songs.  J, the 10-year-old, is usually around while the shows are on, and<br/>
today, we were watching a Wiggles Christmas show.  The guys, who are<br/>
Australian, were singing a song about Christmas in Australia being warm and<br/>
sunny.  J, amazed, looked at me and said, &quot;they don&#39;t have snow in<br/>
Australia?&quot;  Which began this entire conversation about the climate in<br/>
Australia, the northern and southern hemispheres, why it might be snowing in<br/>
Argentina in June, why places closer to the equator, whether north or south,<br/>
are hotter all the time, etc. etc. etc. why it&#39;s cold at the south pole AND<br/>
the north pole.  All these questions and explorations online and with our<br/>
globe came up, all started by J, because of a Wiggles show.<br/>
<br/>
And I had this memory of being 10, in the 5th grade, and being shamed<br/>
because I answered a question wrong on a test about the north and south<br/>
poles.  For some reason, I believed that *south* meant *hot,* because in my<br/>
experience, traveling to the south from Indiana, it got warmer.  I just<br/>
extrapolated that to the south pole -- it must be hot there.  Whatever we<br/>
had been told from the textbook or whatever, had gone in one ear and out<br/>
again, because my real, true experience was that it is hot the farther south<br/>
you go.   I just remember my teacher laughing at me, and shaming me about<br/>
it.  And I&#39;m so, so glad that J has the opportunity to learn about this<br/>
stuff when he wants to, when it fits and is connected to things he&#39;s<br/>
thinking about, without being tested, without being shamed.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
