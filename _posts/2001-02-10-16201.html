<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Wellllll, I don&#39;t think anyone needs automatic weapons or handguns.  It<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
interesting that folk who own guns are 22% more likely to injuried with a<br/>
gun.  And folks that have guns for &quot;protection&quot; are 75% more likely to be<br/>
injured by their own gun than by the supposed bad guys they are protecting<br/>
themselves from.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok Lynda.. so on the 22%, that would be like saying that those who don&#39;t own<br/>
cars will be less likely to be injured by them? Or those who don&#39;t kitchen<br/>
knives will be less likely to cut themselves with one? (Also automatic<br/>
weapons are already banned.)<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t know where you found your statistics.. but here is what I found.<br/>
Self-Defense -- In a landmark survey, criminologist Gary Kleck found that<br/>
handguns are used in about 2/3 of 2.5 million annual defensive firearm uses.<br/>
Analyzing Nat&#39;l Crime Victimization Surveys, Kleck found that people who use<br/>
firearms to defend themselves are less likely to be attacked or injured than<br/>
people who use other or noprotective methods. Protection method and percents<br/>
of individuals injured included: Used gun -- 17.4%, Used knife-- 40.3%, Used<br/>
other weapon -- 22.0%, Used physical force -- 50.8%, Tried to get help,<br/>
frighten offender -- 48.9%, Threatened, reasoned with offender -- 30.7%,<br/>
Nonviolent resistance, (including evasion) -- 34.9%, Other measures --<br/>
26.5%, Any self-protection -- 38.2%, No self-protection -- 24.7%. Kleck also<br/>
found that &quot;at most, 1% of defensive gun uses resulted in the offender<br/>
taking a gun away from the victim,&quot; including instances in which burglars<br/>
stealing guns from homes are confronted by homeowners armed with other guns.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;One of the problems with guns is that we don&#39;t enforce the laws we have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AND<br/>
we don&#39;t put rules on the books that will make a difference.  Folks who sell<br/>
guns illegally get a slap on the wrist, so why should they care if they are<br/>
providing guns to gang members and bad guys.  The number of illegal guns<br/>
coming over the borders is enormous!  Deal with that.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
True. And every free American has the responsibility of being the watch dog<br/>
of their government..if that government is not enforcing the laws. If the<br/>
police and judges aren&#39;t doing their jobs, then its time to have them<br/>
removed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;AND, I won&#39;t shout but really want to, what about IDIOT police departments<br/>
 </span></blockquote>that take the guns they have confiscated and then turn around and sell them!<br/>
Some of those guns have been traced through 3 or 4 criminal acts after being<br/>
sold by police departments!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
As long as they are selling them legally and not selling to criminals.. then<br/>
what&#39;s the problem?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Also, the real origin of lots of guns used by the bad guys is the same<br/>
 </span></blockquote>folks<br/>
that bought them to protect themselves and then they were stolen.  Folks<br/>
don&#39;t do enough to keep guns safe and that includes safe from theft.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
How do you know this is the real origin?<br/>
So do we ban all guns?.. the criminals will still obtain them somehow. As<br/>
for me and my family we want the option of being able to defend ourselves.<br/>

own<br/>
&gt; cars will be less likely to be injured by them?<br/>
<br/>
***No, you would have to relate it to not only owning but riding in because<br/>
the ratio of injury to ownership is not as relevant as the injury to<br/>
occupancy.<br/>
<br/>
Or those who don&#39;t kitchen<br/>
&gt; knives will be less likely to cut themselves with one?<br/>
<br/>
***Wellll, the stats on kitchen knives is that you are less likely to be<br/>
injured by a sharp knive than a dull knive &lt;g&gt;  Those numbers I have as we<br/>
owned a butcher shop and I did safety seminars.<br/>
<br/>
 (Also automatic<br/>
&gt; weapons are already banned.)<br/>
<br/>
***Accuracy, please, or the honesty police will get you &lt;g&gt;  Some automatic<br/>
weapons are banned.  There are many loops holes in the laws and each state<br/>
has their own version.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I don&#39;t know where you found your statistics.. but here is what I<br/>
found.<br/>
&gt; Self-Defense -- In a landmark survey, criminologist Gary Kleck found that<br/>

uses.<br/>
&gt; Analyzing Nat&#39;l Crime Victimization Surveys, Kleck found that people who<br/>
use<br/>
&gt; firearms to defend themselves are less likely to be attacked or injured<br/>
than<br/>
&gt; people who use other or noprotective methods.<br/>
<br/>
*** This statement is an oxymoron.  If one was not being attacked or<br/>
injured, why would one be defending oneself and filling out a Crime<br/>
Victimization Survey?<br/>
<br/>
Protection method and percents<br/>
&gt; of individuals injured included: Used gun -- 17.4%, Used knife-- 40.3%,<br/>
Used<br/>
&gt; other weapon -- 22.0%, Used physical force -- 50.8%, Tried to get help,<br/>
&gt; frighten offender -- 48.9%, Threatened, reasoned with offender -- 30.7%,<br/>

&gt; 26.5%, Any self-protection -- 38.2%, No self-protection -- 24.7%.<br/>
<br/>
***These stats are worthless.  They are only relevant if the &quot;victims&quot; were<br/>
in the same set of circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
Kleck also<br/>
&gt; found that &quot;at most, 1% of defensive gun uses resulted in the offender<br/>
&gt; taking a gun away from the victim,&quot; including instances in which burglars<br/>
&gt; stealing guns from homes are confronted by homeowners armed with other<br/>
guns.<br/>
<br/>
***This disagrees with the stats that the various police agencies have<br/>
compiled.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;AND, I won&#39;t shout but really want to, what about IDIOT police<br/>
departments<br/>
&gt; that take the guns they have confiscated and then turn around and sell<br/>
them!<br/>
&gt; Some of those guns have been traced through 3 or 4 criminal acts after<br/>
being<br/>
&gt; sold by police departments!&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As long as they are selling them legally and not selling to criminals..<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s the problem?<br/>
<br/>
*** One of the problems is that some of these guns were not legal to begin<br/>
with.  Another problem is that obviously the folks they are supplying are<br/>
selling the guns illegally.  It doesn&#39;t take an Einstein to figure out that<br/>
if you sell a confiscated gun on January 1 and on March 1 it is in the hands<br/>
of a &quot;bad guy&quot; and then you resell the gun and 3 to 6 months later it is<br/>
again confiscated from a &quot;bad guy&quot; and this continues to happen, then &quot;you&quot;<br/>
as the policing agency are doing something wrong.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Also, the real origin of lots of guns used by the bad guys is the same<br/>
&gt; folks<br/>
&gt; that bought them to protect themselves and then they were stolen.  Folks<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t do enough to keep guns safe and that includes safe from theft.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you know this is the real origin?<br/>
<br/>
***  Gun &quot;x,&quot; &quot;y&quot; or &quot;z&quot; is reported stolen in a home burglary.  Same gun is<br/>
later confiscated in a crime.  That is simple dot to dot with the numbers<br/>
being that 3 to 4 out of every 5 Saturday night specials that are<br/>
confiscated have been reported stolen.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So do we ban all guns?.. the criminals will still obtain them somehow. As<br/>
&gt; for me and my family we want the option of being able to defend ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
***  No, you don&#39;t ban all guns but you do make folks responsible for their<br/>
own actions AND that includes the folks that buy guns for &quot;protection.&quot;  If<br/>
you buy a gun and it is stolen and someone is harmed by that weapon, then<br/>
the owner should bear some of the burden of guilt!<br/>
<br/>
Also, can someone please explain to me (skip the paranoia, please) in a<br/>
logical manner why some folks are so against the waiting period and the<br/>
requirement that you prove you can use the blooming things AND why they are<br/>
so up in arms about the laws against automatic weapons.  The only purpose in<br/>
the world for an automatic weapon is to kill someone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661282478">Do I know why you pulled me over.  Well, I do now thanks to your e-mail<br/>
explaining that you were a teacher at a ps.  Guess old habits are hard to<br/>

list as one of your classes.  You might also take a closer look at the<br/>
e-mail in question as &quot;the reponse is&quot; not &quot;general and to the topic.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You assume, probably because that is where you come from, that anger was<br/>
involved or would become envolved.  And, if you taught English, then you<br/>
know what &quot;yellow rag journalism tactics&quot; are and really should refrain from<br/>
using them.<br/>
<br/>
You should also know what an oxymoron is and thus should know that the<br/>
statement given by the statistition was an oxymoron.  AND, that the<br/>
statement was not aimed at a list member.  Thus, you know that pulling that<br/>
part of the e-mail to illustrate your &quot;lesson&quot; to the &quot;class&quot; was<br/>
ineffective as it negates the balance by not being representative of what<br/>
you were trying to demonstrate and merely looks petty and nitpicky.<br/>
<br/>
Also, while the first two examples may qualify as rhetroic, the balance only<br/>
do if you use selective quoting, ie. yellow-rag journalism.  And again, even<br/>
the first two are a stretch as each was qualified.  To fit the definition<br/>
each statement would have had to be simply dropped into the &quot;conversation&quot;<br/>
and left by itself without regard to supporting facts or qualifiers.<br/>
<br/>
You then go on to say in another e-mail that you &quot;address concepts and<br/>
statements, NOT people.&quot;  Not quite the truth as when the pronoun &quot;you&quot; is<br/>
used, it is to a specific person, not a concept or idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-512638444">This is really getting tiresome.  There is so much anger on this list.  It <br/>
seems to me that many of the posts sound like an argument between children, <br/>
&quot;he said this...she said that&quot;. Could we all grow up a little bit and get on <br/>
with any subject other than bickering. It is one thing to discuss the <br/>
subject of honesty it is another to continually accuse someone of being <br/>
dishonest.  I&#39;m not trying to take sides. I know who I agree with, but don&#39;t <br/>
feel that it is pertinent.  I also don&#39;t feel that this line of discussion <br/>
is beneficial to anyone on this list.  It is divisive and unnecessary.<br/>

<div><font face="Century Gothic">I don&#39;t know if this counts as skipping the 
paranoia or not...probably depends on your definition of paranoia.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">I oppose such laws because I believe it 
infringes on my personal right to bear arms.&nbsp; I believe the founding 
fathers included those rights in order to help us protect all within our 
society.&nbsp; The law was originally put into place to allow the average 
citizen to protect himself/herself, family, property and country.&nbsp; The need 
for personal protection&nbsp;has not gone away.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">(here&#39;s the potential paranoia part), Waiting 
periods and back ground checks leave lists &#39;lying&#39; around somewhere which have 
the potential to be used unlawfully against the gun owner.&nbsp; Hackers can 
break into computer files and know just where to go to steal the gun of their 
choice, for instance.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">There is also the potential for the laws to be 
changed &#39;allowing&#39; the government to come in and take all guns at &#39;whim&#39; or in 
some politically correct situation (i.e. for the &#39;protection of society&#39; all 
guns must be turned in).</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">I&#39;m not saying we are currently on the verge of 
some cataclysmic societal or governmental breakdown.&nbsp; But we don&#39;t know 
what the future may bring and once such laws are on the books it is hard to 
reverse them.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">What IF we have a war in our land?&nbsp; It 
happens elsewhere, why not here (USA)?&nbsp; The military or the police will NOT 
be able to be in all places to protect all people.&nbsp; We would be on our own 
to take care of ourselves.&nbsp; I know it&#39;s a big &#39;what if&#39; right now...but it 
has happened here and there is no way to say it will never happen 
again.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Century Gothic">My two cents worth (and I probably owe someone 
change!),</font></div>

  <div><br></div><tt>Also, can someone please explain to me (skip the paranoia, 
  please) in a<br>logical manner why some folks are so against the waiting 
  period and the<br>requirement that you prove you can use the blooming things
