<div id="ygrps-yiv-429493325">I want to thank everyone here for your input and for opening my mind to <br/>
different things in the short time I have been here. I am unsubscribing from <br/>
the group and wish you all the best in your unschooling ventures. <br/>

I don&#39;t believe that homeschooling the unschooling way is for me. I will <br/>
continue with my venture in homeschooling, just not in this way.<br/>
