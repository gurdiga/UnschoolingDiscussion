<div id="ygrps-yiv-784742033">My children are the biggest inspiration....I look at them and watch them, and<br/>
know that they are really good people.  They are interesting, and interested...I<br/>
find those very important qualities.<br/>
Having said that, I do have doubts sometimes, and I like to read Sandra Dodd&#39;s<br/>
essays...look at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.com">http://unschooling.com</a> for those.<br/>
I also love to read John Holt and Grace Llewellyn.<br/>
The reading helps,  but for the most inspiration, I spend time with schooled<br/>
kids....<br/>
Whether it is family, or just going to the zoo or whatever...when I get home I<br/>
am completely and utterly happy and content....  ahhhhhhh.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My children.<br/>
<br/>
I know that sounds so corny.  But, just when I begin to wonder, and I do, if <br/>
they have learned anything lately, they amaze me.  <br/>
<br/>
Daughter&#39;s favorite time lately is when we are alone running errands after <br/>
dropping her brother off at Tae Kwon Do.  Today she told me the best jokes!  <br/>
Really, for 6 they were great!  And then some weren&#39;t.  And we talked about <br/>
that.  Humor and what makes a joke funny -- or when the pun isn&#39;t quite <br/>
right.  Etc.  And then what to buy the little girl for her bday party next <br/>
Saturday -- she likes Barbies -- so a Barbie -- but not too expensive a <br/>
Barbie,  I was told by my daughter -- the other girl is young, you know.  <br/>
<br/>
And my son was reading to me today out of the Time Mag that came about the <br/>
demise of the universe.  (Whimper not bang is the latest theory was all I <br/>
could understand.)  He was fascinated with the size of the numbers involved.  <br/>
<br/>
Having stuff around that is interesting to talk about actually does lead to <br/>
interesting conversations.  It actually does.  <br/>
<br/>
And these are just snippets of our day.  Nice things like this happen all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
So, have fun!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, part of my encouragement just comes from watching my kids and <br/>
how they learn. They each learn in their own individual way and just <br/>
look at the things they have mastered in their relatively short <br/>
lives! Acquiring human language has to be the single most difficult <br/>
task we ever accomplish in our lives, and we do it before we&#39;re 2 or <br/>
3 years old with no formal instruction whatsoever and each of us does <br/>
it in our own way, some kids speaking just nouns for a year and then <br/>
adding verbs, some kids not talking for years and then coming out <br/>
with whole sentences. When I see this, I know that if we just apply <br/>
the same encouraging, yet hands-off principle to all other learning, <br/>
our kids will do just fine at whatever they put their ambition to.<br/>
<br/>
And for external motivation, you can&#39;t beat a good John Holt book, he <br/>
wrote a dozen or so and they&#39;re all great.<br/>
