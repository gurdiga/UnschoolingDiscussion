&gt; &gt; &gt; WASHINGTON D.C. - Following an emergency meeting Wednesday<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; morning, Congress unanimously voted to excise Florida from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; United States of America.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The move was a reaction to the confusion and irregularities in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the state&#39;s voting numbers that have totally disrupted the 2000<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Presidential election.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;This is the last straw,&quot; said Utah senator Orin Hatch. &quot;First<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Elian Gonzales, now this.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Several congressmen told reporters the decision has been a long<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; time in coming.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;We&#39;re all pretty much sick of Florida,&quot; said representative<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Barney Frank. &quot;They&#39;ve been a constant embarrassment for too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; long now.&quot; Added Frank, &quot;They had Dan Marino for a while, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what have they done lately? Oh that&#39;s right, screw up our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; entire democracy. I forgot.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; In a speech on the Senate floor, Massachusetts senator Ted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kennedy commented that the loss of Florida&#39;s sizable elderly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; population will free up billions of dollars in social security<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; funds. &quot;These are valuable funds which can now be redirected<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; toward national defense. We can finally rebuild our demoralized,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weakened military,&quot; said the Senator to roaring applause.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As a result of the Florida screw-up, the House and Senate decreed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a new election will take place in early December. This time,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ballots in each state will be tabulated by robots. &quot;It is clear<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that our human vote-counting system is too inherently flawed,&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; said Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert. &quot;The presence of these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; new, superior robot mast- err, I mean - tabulators will ensure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 100% accuracy.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Remember,&quot; said Hastert, &quot;every vote counts, especially if it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; counted by robots.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dynamiting will begin along the Florida border next Wednesday,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; after which the state will be completely geographically separated<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; from the United States.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;After that, they&#39;re on their own,&quot; said Hastert. &quot;I hope they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sink.&quot; </span></blockquote></div>
