<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241960830">I just have to tell this:<br/>
<br/>
Zac is 15.5 years old and has always gotten the months of the year mixed up - he could say all 12 from an early age but never in order.  He&#39;s never had a sense of time as in what month comes next.  He&#39;s always had to ask us or use a calendar.  Anyway:<br/>
<br/>
Today he and my husband stopped at the grocery store.  Upon arriving home Zac informed me that he thought he knew the months and proceeded to list them off - he left out October but got all the rest in order.  He told me that he was standing in the potato chip isle looking at &quot;best by dates&quot; and figured out the order of the dates and for some reason all the months came to him in order.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been sending him off in the store to retrieve items for a long time (he offers to go get items to speed things up) and he has been looking at best by dates for several years but I guess they are usually within the same month???  Not sure why it all clicked today but it did - well I do know that his brain was ready and the situation presented itself.   He went to school through mid third grade so no amount of teaching did it for him - but in his own time he did it - he was exposed to kind answers and an available calendar for years- and given time - when he was ready - standing in the potato chip isle figuring out &quot;best by&quot; dates - he figured out the months of the year in order.<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share - thought others might benefit !<br/>
<br/>
HA I just realized the title to my post is a pun - OK so it was not intended but I&#39;ll leave it as it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-957923496">That&#39;s cool when things just click. My son is 12 and is the same with <br/>
months, even days of the week for awhile. He recently figured out the <br/>
order of the days in the week. My 2 daughters picked up on the months of <br/>
the year through a song they learned in kindergarten. Since my youngest <br/>
dd has been singing it off and on, I think he picked up on it as well.<br/>
