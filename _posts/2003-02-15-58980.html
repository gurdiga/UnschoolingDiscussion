<div id="ygrps-yiv-908846163">Hi all,<br/>
  Let me start this post by stating that while I consider our family <br/>
unschoolers as far as learning styles go, there have been many times that <br/>
I&#39;ve scratched my head over parenting philosophies or ideas that made me say, <br/>
&quot;Wow, I&#39;ve never thought of it that way!&quot; or &quot;No, I just can&#39;t conceive of <br/>
trying that, YET anyway.&quot; But (big BUT) I do think that my way of parenting <br/>
has been going through changes and while I may never make it all the way, my <br/>
kids are happier now and I am a happier parent.<br/>
  Anyway....I picked up a book from B&N called Under the Chinaberry Tree: <br/>
Books and Inspirations for Mindful Parenting by the publishers of the <br/>
Chinaberry catalog. I&#39;d like to share a quote from the introduction that I <br/>
really liked (and may hang on my fridge.)<br/>
  &quot;But each night, as I became more firmly grounded in motherhood, I came to <br/>
know that there would seldom be life-or-death choices I would be called upon <br/>
to make in order to protect her from all the kinds of pain that visit humans. <br/>
Instead, there would be a myriad of small choices I would need to make day in <br/>
and day out that would help mold her into the person she would eventually <br/>
turn out to be. I came to understand that it would be the small choices in <br/>
parenting that would really and truly matter- the choices that there are <br/>
hundreds of every single day when you have a child.&quot; (end quote)<br/>
