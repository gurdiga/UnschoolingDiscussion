<div id="ygrps-yiv-64713249">LOL - I have almost 900 emails piled up - but somebody sent me this one <br/>
(thanks Jocelyn).<br/>
<br/>
My older daughters were both extremely successful and happy in school - <br/>
one in 4th grade and the other in an nongraded primary classroom. They <br/>
were superstars of the school - everybody loved them, they were given <br/>
special privileges just because they were successful and popular. Roya <br/>
was in the gifted program and Rox was in a wonderful class of kids from <br/>
4 to 8 years old. There were no tests in this school - no textbooks - <br/>
no grades. It was a public school - but very innovative (I&#39;d done a lot <br/>
of legwork to get them a transfer to that particular school). They used <br/>
&quot;authentic assessment&quot; and a lot of learning centers - little <br/>
whole-group teaching. Lots of music and art - really high quality. <br/>
Couldn&#39;t ask for better public school situation. I was PTA treasurer - <br/>
a job that required that I work pretty closely with the school <br/>
principal, so we were friends and I took advantage of that to make sure <br/>
my kids got the best teachers.<br/>
<br/>
I took them out because I got AOL, was interested in education, ended <br/>
up on the homeschooling forums - met Sandra and others there - and <br/>
caught the unschooling fever. Roxana was happy about the idea, but Roya <br/>
wanted to stay in school. I had to promise her we&#39;d reconsider after 6 <br/>
weeks. I took the kids to the beach almost every day for the first <br/>
three weeks - and they quickly got involved with a very active <br/>
homeschooling group. She never wanted to go back and they both thank me <br/>
almost every single day for discovering unschooling!!!<br/>
