<div id="ygrps-yiv-560082117">Hello!<br/>
  My name is Amy and I&#39;ve been lurking on this list (and a few of the other <br/>
unschooling lists) for quite a while and felt I should introduce myself. I&#39;m <br/>
married to Brian and have a 4.5yo son and a 2.5yo daughter. My son would be <br/>
attending K in the fall, if he were going. We live in Toledo, OH . We belong <br/>
to a home-preschool group, though they tend to be a lot more structured and <br/>
what-curriculum-do-you-use-ABeka-of-course than I&#39;m comfortable with. I love <br/>
following my kids&#39; interests and astounded at what they learn compared to <br/>
when I used to try to &quot;teach&quot; them. My son is considered &quot;very bright&quot; (their <br/>
words, not mine) and I&#39;m coming under a lot of pressure to send him to <br/>
school, especially as all his friends are now registering for K. Some of the <br/>
stories I&#39;m hearing about K assessments and testing make my hair stand on <br/>
end. Anyways, this list has been a great source of encouragement for me and I <br/>
appreciate the help!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Mary...I agree totally. Any doubts I have about homeschooling vanish <br/>
as soon as I picture him sitting bored in a classroom, staring out the window <br/>
with all his natural curiosity squelched. (Much as I did as a child....many, <br/>
many wasted hours.)<br/>
