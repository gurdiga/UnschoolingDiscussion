<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537815344">&quot;That sounds a lot like &quot;if you aren&#39;t upper middle class, able-bodied and <br/>
white, don&#39;t have children.&quot;  What do you expect women to do who live in<br/>
 big <br/>
cities and who don&#39;t have cars, or the ability to drive for some reason? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This makes me really mad. So first of all, you&#39;re assuming I am upper middle class (based on WHAT?) because I advocate being more creative in a situation where you don&#39;t have a car? Because I KNOW you didn&#39;t have to hit your child and because I say it is the PARENT&#39;S responsibility to be prepared in that situation?<br/>
Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
For the record, I&#39;ve been on welfare when dh and I were separated for 6 months. I&#39;ve lived for two years without a car in the past and managed to get groceries without hitting my children.<br/>
<br/>
Today I drive an OLD car that has no AC, needs new tires but is paid for. I live with FOUR children (three of them boys btw) in a small house in a lower middle class neighborhood. I&#39;ve also lived in an upper class neighborhood (without owning a car!! Go figure) so I do know the difference. And I find your remarks rude, intolerant and hateful.<br/>
