 </span></blockquote>Holly went.<br/>
<br/>
That was less than an hour&#39;s notice, as an initial problem. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And it seemed perhaps that some kids&#39; chat-access was blocked.<br/>
<br/>
If you let your kids go to such chats, PLEASE make sure they&#39;re on an account <br/>
that is cleared for chatrooms!  Poor kids were frustrated trying to get into <br/>
the right place.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe practice a bit maneuvering chatrooms before time if it happens again.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was totally excited about the concept and would love to do it again!<br/>
<br/>
Basically, if you&#39;re on AOL you go to &quot;find a chat&quot; (by a pulldown menu in <br/>
the &quot;people&quot; or &quot;friends&quot; area) and then click &quot;enter or create a private <br/>
chatroom&quot; or it might say &quot;private chat&quot; (depending on which AOL version and which <br/>
computer).  Then type in urinvited or whatever the designated chat name is.  <br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to do it from AIM, but there&#39;s a way, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who types that in will end up in the same &quot;room.&quot;  It&#39;s like an <br/>
instant message with more than one person.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to try again tomorrow, Holly&#39;s interested.  11:00 pacific is <br/>
noon Mountain, 10:00 central, 9:00 Eastern.   We&#39;ll try again.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to propose a different name and time that&#39;s okay too.<br/>

Moly is interested too, but we didn&#39;t get the announcement until the chat was <br/>
over. If the details are worked out tonight then all the kids will know the <br/>
time way before hand. I would like to suggest something a bit different, :o) <br/>
like 1pm central, 2pm eastern, noon mountain, and 11am pacific. (Sandra, I think <br/>
your times are off &lt;g&gt;) <br/>

I&#39;m guilty for poor planning on today&#39;s chat.  I guess one good thing is that only 3 kids were involved in a chat that didn&#39;t go well technically!  I apologize to those 3 though :-(   It wasn&#39;t my intention to be on the chat.  I just wanted to help set it up for my dd.<br/>
<br/>
I have AOL installed on one computer in my house.  I installed only AOL AIM on the other computer (it has less than 500 MB free drive space so can&#39;t take any more programs!)  I was not able to get on the chat on the computer that only had AIM.  With only AIM, there isn&#39;t an option to search for chats.  If someone with AOL sends a link to the chat to someone with only AIM, the person with AIM gets a message that the link doesn&#39;t work.  At least that is what seemed to happen on my two computers.<br/>
<br/>
It does work to use the Buddy List &quot;Chat&quot; on AIM to invite other AIM users to a chat, (regardless of whether they have full AOL or not) except that the person starting it would need to know the addresses of those interested.  As Sandra mentioned, some kids have chats blocked to their screen names.<br/>
<br/>
That is all I can figure out so far.  Unless we go with a different service for the chat or someone else has a better understanding of how this works.  Doesn&#39;t someone have a teen who knows how to do this?  How do they get on chats together?<br/>

You don&#39;t need to go there if someone else is already in the room.  If she <br/>
sends and IM to someone IN the room, they can send them a link.   Do links pass <br/>
to AIM accounts?  I really thought so.  <br/>
<br/>
To do that, you drag the heart from the chatroom into an IM.<br/>

This might only be true if they all have AOL accounts.  When we tried today, once of the girls had an AIM account, but not an AOL account.  Two people with AOL accounts sent her a link to the chat and it didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
It appears to me that when you start a chat on AIM, it doesn&#39;t have a name.  Instead it has a very long number.<br/>
