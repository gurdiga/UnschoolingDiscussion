Ha!  I&#39;m thinking that at least 95% of the people who have joined this <br/>
list.  Starting right about the time they join this list.<br/>
<br/>
I just never knew how much I controlled my kids until I joined this <br/>
list!  I&#39;m not regretful at how I&#39;ve raised them so far, but I&#39;m glad <br/>
for a new perspective.  I&#39;m also glad they are 8 & 12.  Young enough to <br/>
(hopefully) fully recover and shine, and old enough to pretty much <br/>
&quot;get&quot; what I&#39;m working on now.<br/>
