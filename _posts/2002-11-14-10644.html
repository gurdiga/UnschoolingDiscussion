<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283833484">This isn&#39;t about homeschooling, so it wouldn&#39;t hurt my feelings if you all <br/>
skipped it.  I&#39;ll save it for my diary after I write it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Oh, and I&#39;m down to one or two painkillers a day, motrin <br/>
the rest of the time, so I&#39;m feeling less loopy.  How are you doing with the <br/>
pain? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I went off pain killers a week and a half ago.  Monday November 4.  I saved <br/>
what seemed to be two days&#39; worth, in case I were to fall or something, and <br/>
wanted to dope up until I could get to the doctor for more, because my <br/>
narcotic allotment for this accident was done.<br/>
<br/>
I took Advil or Aleve (after they found it for me), not every day.  <br/>
<br/>
But by Friday I was feeling like I was dying.  JUST DYING.  I was having <br/>
creepy, useless, irritating and non-productive dreams.  I woke up Friday <br/>
feeling like I was in a pool of stench, so I got up, figured out how to do a <br/>
sponge bath (Holly helped me set up in the bathroom), and Holly washed by <br/>
sheet and pillow cases and blankets.  She kept saying they didn&#39;t stink, <br/>
though.  Keith had told me the night before I didn&#39;t stink, either.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of friends I asked desperately for help.  Others I told NOT to come <br/>
see me, thanks anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Saturday my friend Frank called, who&#39;s always since we were kids known what&#39;s <br/>
inside people.  I have vague ideas, but he&#39;s always known REALLY exactly, and <br/>
how it worked, from a mechanical to a molecular level, and now that he&#39;s <br/>
almost 50, he knows all of what western Chinese and Indian/Ayurvedic medicine <br/>
thinks about all those things.<br/>
<br/>
I was feeling better Saturday, but told him how bad Thursday and Friday had <br/>
been.  He asked when I had stopped the painkillers.  Monday.  Exactly, he <br/>
said.  Withdrawal.  DTs.  The stench and the dreams and the feelings of death <br/>
were my brain and nervous system readjusting.  So he asked about other <br/>
symptoms, predicted a few, was spot on, told me to go get this&#39;n&#39;that (liver <br/>
cleansing / intestinal assistance) and that Sunday I felt WAY better.  <br/>
<br/>
After sitting up and watching &quot;The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the <br/>
Desert&quot; with nine teenagers (I had been watching but wasn&#39;t too far into it <br/>
when a batch of folks showed up and the lead-female said &quot;I&#39;ve never SEEN <br/>
this!&quot; so there it was), I did a wonderful thing.  A really wonderful thing, <br/>
with Keith&#39;s help.   I went to the back and took a shower.  Sat on a library <br/>
kick-stool which no longer had wheels, with my back to the shower head (we <br/>
have an oversized, flat shower with two hold-bars--closest to handicapped <br/>
equipment we have, though another bathroom, upstairs, has good bars.  This <br/>
house was for nine years a health facility--halfway house for the university <br/>
hospital.<br/>
<br/>
That shower was the best thing to happen to me in a month.  I washed my hair <br/>
just about hair by hair, and used a BIG handful of conditioner.   My cast was <br/>
wrapped up in a compactor bag, taped two ways, because Keith&#39;s that kind of <br/>
guy.  I stayed until the water was going cooler.<br/>
<br/>
In a week, the 20th, I get a walking cast.  Then I go upstairs and cook.<br/>
<br/>
Marty said this morning (I woke up and talked to him from 2:20 to 3:15 or <br/>
so--it was nice) that a few days before that to remind them so they can go <br/>
and clean up the library.  I told him I had  had a dream that it was all <br/>
clean.  He said well, it&#39;s not.   They&#39;ve been having gaming sessions and <br/>
kids staying over.  The library is a two-car-garage-sized room, opens into <br/>
the kitchen, and is over the garage.  There&#39;s a deck in the back with long <br/>
dangerous stairs down to... Keith&#39;s old pickup.  My brother-in-law parked his <br/>
nice new pickup in our backyard spot for two weeks while he&#39;s in Peru (we&#39;re <br/>
in the airport city), so Keith moved his ratty old pickup across...  <br/>
<br/>
Oh... and the other side of the library has a picture window facing the <br/>
Sandia Mountains, which turned yellow and shedded the aspen leaves while I <br/>
was stuck in the back.  <br/>
<br/>
I went out the other night.  When I was freaking, Friday night, I said I <br/>
hadn&#39;t been out for two weeks.  Keith pointed out kinda gently that I had <br/>
been out one week earlier to see Fiddler on the Roof.   But he helped me get <br/>
to the back door, where I stood with the walker under the short eaves, while <br/>
it rained hard.  The air was NICE to breathe, but I was surprised that the <br/>
tomatoes were all withered, and the tree was yellow.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll survive.  It&#39;s not very pleasant, though.  <br/>
<br/>
Monday my friend Jon Ibarra, who was one of my SCA students and is now <br/>
assitant DA in charge of violent crimes, came over, brought me a Wendy&#39;s <br/>
chicken salad, told me stories of coronation (not many, I didn&#39;t want much) <br/>
from the weekend, talked to me about lawyers and lawsuits (and thought 40% <br/>
plus fees was way too much for me to agree to in so clear and simple a suit), <br/>
and we watched Crimson Tide because he&#39;d never seen it.  That magically took <br/>
six hours away from my countdown, and I was glad.   Tuesday morning Keith <br/>
went to Target at 8:00 (which meant going to work almost three hours later <br/>
than he would have) to get me the extended version of The Fellowship of the <br/>
Ring, with its two LONG DVD&#39;s of how and who and what, with its FOUR <br/>
voice-over commentary tracks to play along with its 3.5 hour new length.  <br/>
It&#39;s GREAT.  That has made another two days pass quickly.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s another kind of drug. &lt;g&gt;  But I don&#39;t care.  I&#39;m also re-reading the <br/>
books, starting with The Two Towers, checking into the first book to answer <br/>
kids&#39; questions.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you so much for this.  Particularly in your description of going off <br/>
the pain killers.  I feel so much better when I&#39;m just taking motrin.  I&#39;ll <br/>
try aleve.  I was expecting the reduction of pain to be constant, like a slow <br/>
drop off.  But sometimes it just hurts more than others. I guess growing bone <br/>
isn&#39;t such an easy thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Boy, your description of coming down from the narcotic was frightening.  The <br/>
ghost of my Christmas future really.<br/>
<br/>
The shower.  I&#39;ve never been this long without a shower before.  I can only <br/>
imagine the joy.  Both of our showers are scarry places to me right now.<br/>
<br/>
I had a massage over the weekend and she&#39;s coming back on Saturday.  It&#39;s <br/>
orthobionomy, which isn&#39;t really a kneeding the muscles kind of massage, but <br/>
a method of teaching your body to find comfort and balance.  She worked a <br/>
long time on my right leg, foot and ankle.  I could actually feel the <br/>
mirroring of what she was doing in my left ankle, inside the cast.  I hadn&#39;t <br/>
felt that good in a long time.<br/>
<br/>
How great that you are reaching the walking cast goal.  I&#39;ll be thinking of <br/>
you...<br/>

He said beta-carotene stuff.  Carrot juice if I can get people to make it for <br/>
me, or buy it, or pill-form.  Extra vitamin C (and in my case the Estrogen <br/>
stuff from the health food store, but you might not be my age ! &lt;g&gt;), zinc, <br/>
and an ayurvedic thing called Triphala.  I just used it for the first day.  <br/>
It did its stuff.  I&#39;ll know when I need it again.  I can say no more. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was already taking other vitamins and a pineapple supplement (fresh <br/>
pineapple is supposed to be good for bone growth, or something--that I got <br/>
from another friend) and calcium and arnica.  I feel bad putting so much <br/>
pill-stuff in, but I&#39;m not really feeling like eating much, and a couple of <br/>
times I&#39;ve lagged on the pill regime and started to feel malnourished.<br/>

<br/>
Today is the day I find out what the extent of the damage is to my wrist<br/>
and knee.  I am not to worried about getting my wrist pinned, but I am a<br/>
bit concerned that I might need knee surgery.  I have heard that it can be<br/>
quite painful, and being a drug addict (I refused morphine at the<br/>
emergency room after the accident), I do not look forward to any use of<br/>
heavy pain killers.<br/>
<br/>
I did noy know about the pineapple for bone growth, so I will have to keep<br/>
some around.  I have felt like I am starving all the time lately as my<br/>
body heals.  I can&#39;t hardly look at food now without getting hungry.<br/>

I hope there is something you can do or think or have that will help keep the <br/>

Sandra,<br/>
I desperately want a bath.  I fell on Oct 6, while working in the yard so I was quite dirty and sweaty to begin with.  Sink baths stink!!!  And I feel like I do to. Mine is the right leg also, can&#39;t drive, would have to sit backwards in the bathtub with no bars to hold on to and a stationary showerhead.  So I&#39;ll wait.  I hope for a pressure boot or something when I go back on the 19th!  <br/>
<br/>
And rather that going upstairs, I have an up and a down stairs.  Downstairs is 1000 sq feet of toys, computers, TV, arts and crafts, etc.  The kid&#39;s place.  Also the laundry room is down there and dh has been doing just the necessities.  I told him last night I desperately needed clean sheets too!!!  I really dread seeing the condition of the kid&#39;s space as well as the master bedroom upstairs :-)<br/>
<br/>
Luckily I have lots of windows and was able to enjoy the leaves (we live about 8 minutes from the Blue Ridge Parkway) and I can go out on the deck with my walker.  But it seems every time we have an outing, even to the doctor, it has been raining....and that sucks with a cast too!!<br/>
<br/>
Hope we both are back to normal soon!!!  <br/>

Last night I overheard Keith say to the boys, &quot;No, clean the library NOW.  <br/>
All three of you!&quot;  Joey, a semi-regular kid, was here overnight and had been <br/>
here most of the week.  I had seen him twice. &lt;g&gt;  He&#39;s always ghostly, but <br/>
especially when he can spook about upstairs and I&#39;m stuck down.<br/>
<br/>
The library is a floor and a half from here, so I might not see it for a long <br/>
while, but I hear it&#39;s straightened up.<br/>
<br/>
I can get outside in the walker and think I&#39;ll go outside today and sit.  <br/>
It&#39;s sunny.  I can sit on the edge of a garden-thingie made of railroad ties. <br/>
 Our house is on the side of a hill--not too steep, but it makes it split <br/>
level two different ways, and I&#39;m near the flatness of the back yard.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t that strange...I was the life of the party in the ER for about two <br/>
hours on morphine.  And then I was just sick.  I remember telling the <br/>
anesthesiologist that morphine was a highly overrated drug - it didn&#39;t kill <br/>
the pain and it makes you vomit.  And then I begged him to knock me out.  I <br/>
think I even told the surgeon he could give me a hysterectomy for all I <br/>
cared, I just wanted to be knocked out.  Sure glad he didn&#39;t take me <br/>
seriously...<br/>
<br/>
I had no concerns at all about the surgery, though, because it seemed like <br/>
the first step down a long path towards it not hurting any more.  But I know <br/>
not all surgeries are that way.  My mom had a heart tumor removed - jogged 4 <br/>
miles the day before her surgery, now she has trouble doing her grocery <br/>
shopping.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to all those healing out there!<br/>
