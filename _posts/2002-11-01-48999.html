<br/>
I also question what I am doing. Sometimes twice daily. Then I see what we are<br/>
into. Right now chess, drawing, dancing, biking. I&#39;m learning piano. I<br/>
practice a lot, I wish more. When I practice, I have to share the piano with<br/>
everyone because they all want to try a new piece or show me what they know.<br/>
The piano sat quiet for 6 months or more until I started taking a 20 minute 1<br/>
time a week lesson.<br/>
<br/>
Some weeks I plan a lot, usually outings, to the zoo, a walk, a play, a lunch<br/>
at a resturant, a play date. Other weeks are completely freeform. We may still<br/>
go to the zoo, or a play, yet more spontaneous.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids get cranky, agitated, I usually try to connect with themm.<br/>
Cooking is great, they actually need me to assist. We make fun stuff,<br/>
playdough, bread, soups. We garden, or use a real tool, like a drill, or saw,<br/>
or hammer.<br/>
<br/>
Schoolish type work happend around our house because kids around here go to<br/>
school. They write, or do spelling tests, always asked. My son, also 5 likes<br/>
adding problemsd. I write up a sheet and he does the math. He likes these like<br/>
chess and biking. Something we do together. Time to go.<br/>
