&gt; Dear Friends,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Butler County Superintendent (Butler County, OHIO) has sent all home<br/>
&gt; schoolers a request to update their intent to home school next year.<br/>
&gt; PLEASE DO<br/>
&gt; NOT USE THEIR FORM!  If you belong to a Butler County home school group<br/>
&gt; please<br/>
&gt; be sure to notify your friends as well.  At the end of this message I have<br/>
&gt; provided a URL to a Notification Form which meets the state minimum<br/>
&gt; requirements for annual notification.  As well, I have attached the text<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; this form for those on JUNO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Butler County has requested the following not required by law.<br/>
&gt; 1.  Name of school system you reside in.<br/>
&gt; 2.  Home phone number (labeled optional)<br/>
&gt; 3.  Have asked you to specify the home school parents level of education.<br/>
&gt;         This is not required by law.  By law you only<br/>
&gt;         have to agree that you meet one of the criteria,<br/>
&gt;         you do not need to tell them which one you meet!<br/>
&gt; 4.  Stated in their cover letter that they &quot;need to notify everyone&quot; about<br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; home school activities.<br/>
&gt;         I have not called to determine what this means,<br/>
&gt;         however, State Law does not require or stipulate<br/>
&gt;         that any other state agencies or educational<br/>
&gt;         institutions should be notified about your intent<br/>
&gt;         to home school your child.  I plan to call the<br/>
&gt;         Superintendent tomorrow to determine the<br/>
&gt;         extent of this comment.<br/>
