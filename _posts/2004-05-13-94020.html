<div id="ygrps-yiv-66733529">Hello<br/>
<br/>
I am a SAHM to 2 girls(almost 3 & 5yo).  I have been researching <br/>
homeschooling and have been very interested in/drawn to/comfortable <br/>
with unschooling as a way of life for my family.  I feel I understand <br/>
the philospophy, but I still feel a little fear about completely <br/>
letting go and doing it (or NOT doing what everyone else is doing, <br/>
expects, etc.).  I have an open-minded husband, and a few <br/>
homeschooling friends (traditional parenting, curriculum-users) but <br/>
little support otherwise.  I joined this list and have been re-<br/>
visiting Unschooling.com for some reassurance, as I am somewhat <br/>
nervous about taking the first &#39;official step&#39; into hs, by not <br/>
sending dd to kindergarten.  I also have been needing some help with <br/>
communication & mindful parenting (thanks for the referral to <br/>
NoMoreSpanking -- great people).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Here&#39;s what I am afraid of with the preschool idea. <br/>
&gt;What I&#39;m worried &gt;about is that Scotty will love it so much (all the <br/>
&gt;toys, art supplies, playground equipment) that when he gets too old <br/>
&gt;for it he will still want to go to &quot;school&quot; like all his friends <br/>
&gt;(and all of their parents are calling preschool &quot;school&quot;, I guess to <br/>
&gt;get them used to the idea), even though kindergarten is much more <br/>
&gt;structured. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We sent Orion to preschool when she was 3yo, because it was what <br/>
everyone recommended and what everyone was doing, as well as to give <br/>
ourselves a break as we adjusted to life with younger dd.  The <br/>
program was quality (if you agree with acadmeics at young ages), the <br/>
teachers were nice, and Orion loved it, but we chose not to send her <br/>
back for the second year for the same concerns as above.  As we <br/>
strengthened our resolve to pursue hs, we did not want her <br/>
brainwashed into what &#39;school&#39; is, and confused when she did not go <br/>
to that wonderful place when her friends do...  We got a lot of crap <br/>
(and still are) from family but we really feel we made the right <br/>
decision.  I have always seen learning, and my dh is coming to <br/>
understand the concept of learning from life.  For &#39;preschool at <br/>
home&#39; we are providing dds many opportunities and fostering their <br/>
interests as we see them develop. We tried being more structured, but <br/>
older dd is very independant, and we soon saw that she learns best on <br/>
her own terms.  So, our (dh & I) private catch-phrase after getting <br/>
questioned or harrassed as to how preschool at home is going, or when <br/>
we see dds doing/saying something impressive is &quot;guess the <br/>
homeschooling is going well&quot;! <br/>
<br/>
I will admit that while I feel unschooling is the way for our family, <br/>
I have been exploring different materials (ie for phonics/math), and <br/>
methods like Charlotte Mason, mostly out of fear.  We don&#39;t even have <br/>
to notify in Ohio until age 6 but the kindergarten thing is freaking <br/>
me out a little...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the inspiration this group provides.<br/>

Fear is contagious.<br/>
Don&#39;t make your kids afraid of phonics and math, nor afraid that they can <br/>
fail at unschooling.   Try to overcome your fears so the kids can grow up in the <br/>
absence of them!<br/>

I&#39;m an unschooling mom, through and through, but I have always enjoyed <br/>
looking at different kinds of curriculum materials - it is MY hobby, <br/>
though, I don&#39;t impose it on my kids &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Well, to be honest, sometimes, over the years, I&#39;ve become so enamored <br/>
with some program or another that I&#39;ve presented it to my kids and a <br/>
couple of times one of THEM caught my enthusiasm and said they wanted <br/>
to try it. Yeah -until something better came along, which was almost <br/>
immediately!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684454498">You can learn from my experience, though, and not waste your time or <br/>
money or risk that she&#39;ll feel bad about not liking something you seem <br/>
to think is important.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, to satisfy that urge, I suggest you have a look at Anna <br/>
Kealoha&#39;s book, &quot;Trust the Children,&quot; and Peggy Kaye&#39;s books, &quot;Games <br/>
for Learning,&quot; &quot;Games for Math,&quot; and &quot;Games for Reading.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with those instead of thinking of them as &quot;phonics&quot; and &quot;math&quot; <br/>
- they&#39;re filled with interesting fun things to do - just fool around <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I need to say that I NEVER considered using any kind of phonics <br/>
program, I don&#39;t want to leave you misunderstanding me about that. I am <br/>
firmly convinced, based on many years of experience and interest in how <br/>
children learn, that early phonics is a serious risk to a child&#39;s <br/>
long-term reading and learning ability. I wouldn&#39;t take the risk. It <br/>
pushes one particular way of learning on a kid that may be in conflict <br/>
with that child&#39;s own individual learning style and that can really be <br/>
harmful to do to a young child. Look at what the schools are turning <br/>
out with all their early emphasis on phonics/reading. It isn&#39;t <br/>
necessary - let your child learn when she&#39;s good and ready to do it her <br/>
own way. In the meantime, surround her with a print-rich environment <br/>
and lots and lots of opportunity to play with pencils and paper and <br/>
crayons and markers and paint and stickers and stamps and post-it notes <br/>
and tape and staplers and paper of all kinds and maybe restaurant pads <br/>
and little tiny pads of paper and big giant sheets of paper and <br/>
scissors of all kinds and on and on with whatever interests her.  And <br/>
read aloud all the absolutely wonderful picture books there are out <br/>
there - don&#39;t be in a hurry to move past those - and play stories and <br/>
music on cd&#39;s/tapes including storytellers and musicals and include <br/>
books with lots of repetition like Patty Wolcott&#39;s &quot;The Marvelous Mud <br/>
Washing Machine&quot; and &quot;The Cake Story.&quot; Put your energy into high <br/>
quality books - every dollar spent on a very very special picture book <br/>
instead of some phonics program is a dollar VERY well spent. Please <br/>
don&#39;t hurry her.<br/>
<br/>
For math - spend your money, instead, on puzzles and building materials <br/>
like lego and Kapla blocks and pattern blocks and geoboards and games, <br/>
especially games using dice and cards and strategy games like Othello <br/>
and Pente and visual games like SET.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m serious - I do like looking at what other homeschoolers are doing <br/>
as far as curriculum, but it is an interest of mine, I&#39;m curious. But I <br/>
don&#39;t recommend trying them out on young children.<br/>

Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the book and game recommendations...  I will be looking <br/>
them.  I was very interested to read your thoughts on phonics and <br/>
math (had to laugh at your long list of materials but I get the <br/>
point).  I have felt somewhat uncomfortable with almost all <br/>
approaches I&#39;ve looked at, until I came across the Simply Phonics & <br/>
Math Series.  It seems to be very relaxed and could be used very <br/>
loosely.  I thought, just what **I** need to help when she seems <br/>
ready!  But I have hesitated in buying, because deep down, I feel <br/>
like they might be unneccessary, and most likely go largely unused <br/>
(bought first two volumes of Five in a Row for preschool with same <br/>
idea and that&#39;s what happened with them.  Now I have this twinge to <br/>
try again with them, because I spent the $$). <br/>
<br/>
I browsed a few books at the library on helping children learn to <br/>
read using literature, reading readiness activities etc. Can you <br/>
recommend any more specific parent resources like this? And any other <br/>
math games for young children?  And sites where I can find  <br/>
intelligent resources/games? I really would rather spend the money on <br/>
quality items that have been recommended by those with experience.<br/>
<br/>
I know I will feel better if I can trust myself more.  Perhaps that <br/>
is the basis of my &#39;fear&#39; more than trusting my kids to learn at the <br/>
right time for them -- that **I** will not be prepared to adequately <br/>
help them when that time comes.  I am, after all, a product of public <br/>
schools!  There is so much I don&#39;t know, and I need to become more <br/>
comfortable with the idea that I can/will learn right along with <br/>
them, and that is OKAY.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Too structured.  Just read to them, watch movies with them, talk to them, if <br/>
they want to write a story maybe type it up for them, save it, print it, read <br/>
it to them sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually they can learn naturally.<br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t have to play games that are specifically &quot;math games,&quot; especially <br/>
if they&#39;re young.<br/>
<br/>
There are a couple of games my kids liked, though, that are HEAVILY <br/>
mathematical without using a single numeral and if you can find them, you should.  Even <br/>
really young children can play them, and they best thing about them is they <br/>
will give you the mom a greater of understanding of what math looks like when <br/>
it&#39;s not numbers on paper.<br/>
<br/>
A board game, maybe out of print, but maybe you&#39;ll find it at a garage sale <br/>
or thrift store or online somewhere:   Bazaar.   If you only get a partial set, <br/>
write and I&#39;ll tell you what you need to get to play it.  It&#39;s doable, to <br/>
play with a partial set.<br/>
<br/>
A card game called Set.  <br/>
<br/>
A computer game called Zoombinis.<br/>

Sell them on ebay or the homeschooling board at VegSource (I think that is what it is called).  You can recoup a little money and get them out of your house. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479735620">I keep meaning to write this.  Peggy Kaye also has an email list.  You could get a lot of her ideas for free right there.<br/>
<br/>
Its on Yahoo.  I&#39;ll look it up and see if I can find it.<br/>

  &gt; Those books I always recommend are: &quot;Trust the Children&quot; by Anna <br/>
  &gt; Kealoha and the learning books by Peggy Kaye. Those contain lots of <br/>
  &gt; actual activities and games and are perfect for you having ideas at <br/>
  &gt; your fingertips.<br/>
<br/>
  I did look into the Peggy Kaye books on Amazon, and want to show them <br/>
  to dh.  Seem much easier and more fun than the relaxed curriculum...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; For helping you be more confident and secure, nothing beats reading <br/>
  &gt; &quot;The Book of Learning and Forgetting&quot; by Frank Smith.<br/>
<br/>
  I actually just put this one on hold at the library. Hopefully I can <br/>
  find Trust the Children and order it too.<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks.<br/>

I&#39;m guessing his parents limited his sweets access.<br/>
<br/>
My kids could buy two with their own money, and only eat one if they decided <br/>
their eyes had been bigger than their stomachs.  They&#39;d give the other away or <br/>
throw it in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
The whole principle of what creates neediness and fear is at the root of <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Parents fear that children won&#39;t learn math, so they teach them math, but in <br/>
the process they teach them to avoid it, to fear it, to only do it when they <br/>
have to.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think the side parenting stuff is not crucial to unschooling, and <br/>
other times I think it is.   <br/>
