Try writing it every nite before bed, like a journal entry.  I did that for a <br/>
while, just &#39;cause.  Alex likes reading it, even tho I gave up on it long <br/>
ago. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596071853">Bedtime is when I am exhusted. Kids are still going, but I usually have read <br/>
til I am falling asleep. Maybe if I were to gather them as if I were going to <br/>
read and have their input for the journal for a few minutes! That might work! <br/>
I miss those nursing baby moments, when everything else was put on hold!<br/>
  Hugs, Patti<br/>
