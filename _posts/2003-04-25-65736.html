<div id="ygrps-yiv-620317951">Hi! My name is Tina, I have been homeschooling, or unschooling my 7 <br/>
year old son since, well in my opinion, birth. I also have a 2 year <br/>
old daughter. I have joined your group because I have always had the <br/>
desire to fully unschool, but parts of me cannot let go of <br/>
the &quot;traditional&quot; schooling ideal. I have many reasons for <br/>
homeschooling, as we all do, but one of the biggies was I wanted to <br/>
make this experience for me and my children truly memorable. A fun <br/>
childhood. This year my son will turn 8 and my state that is the <br/>
magic number, 8. I have to be starting to be accountable in some <br/>
way..so for these past few years I have just done whatever we felt <br/>
like doing without much in the way of record keeping etc. My <br/>
questions are....how do you help yourself let go of the traditional <br/>
feeling, how do you document or keep track for the state and how do I <br/>
keep from freaking out? Ha ha! Currently we do do a few things most <br/>
days....but I really want the things we do to be more natural..fun, <br/>
unschool like. I am just having a really hard time bridging that gap <br/>
right now. Many times I see things being learned without my trying <br/>
and I am thrilled, but then my fears start to get me. You know?! <br/>
Anyway, any helps, tips, good books etc would help me tremendously.<br/>
Thanks so much! I look forward to your replies!<br/>
Take Care, <br/>
Tina</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187557368"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Hi Sheila, I am in Washington state. Why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because the homeschooling laws are different in each state.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;This year my son will turn 8 and my state that is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; magic number, 8. I have to be starting to be accountable in some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way..so for these past few years I have just done whatever we<br/>

&gt; traditional<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feeling, how do you document or keep track for the state<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think Washington is pretty easy to unschool in.  From what I&#39;ve read, you<br/>
have to have a certain amount of college or take a short easy course on<br/>
homeschooling.  You have to have your kids tested every year, but the<br/>
results either don&#39;t count or don&#39;t even have to be sent in.  Somebody<br/>
correct me if I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Where are you in Washington?  I&#39;m across the Juan de Fuca Strait near<br/>
Victoria in BC.  My mother used to live in Eatonville, but now she&#39;s in an<br/>
adult family home in Sequim.<br/>
