<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227426964">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve really been enjoying the responses regarding the original e-mail I<br/>
posted.  I am striving towards little to no control in regards to my kids,<br/>
and practising saying yes more often.  With regards to foods containing more<br/>
sugar, I am personally concerned with cavities, and overall nutrition.<br/>
Although initially much more relaxed with dental health, by the time my<br/>
second child was 3 this was resulting in more cavities than we liked  (And<br/>
that was a time of very, very little sugary food).  So, now we&#39;re much more<br/>
conscious of oral care, which includes brushing/flossing right before bed,<br/>
and this seems to work so far.<br/>
<br/>
  As far as encouraging open choices regarding food, what I&#39;m seeing that<br/>
would work for me, and may be exactly what others on this list are doing, is<br/>
that while having lots of sugary/fried snacks around for choice/enjoyment is<br/>
important if everyone wants it that way, also providing or having more<br/>
healthful snacks on hand and easily available is also important.  Combined<br/>
with talking about what&#39;s in foods casually so kids can make connections<br/>
between what they eat/how they feel as it pertains to their experience.  So<br/>
they can also learn about protein etc.<br/>
<br/>
  I can see that this might be more &quot;work&quot; for me, since if I would like<br/>
healthy snacks to be available, I will need to make them easy and<br/>
accessible, since sugary/fried snacks tend to be shelf-stable and easy to<br/>
grab.  Carrots, apple, cheese, etc are not always immediately edible, and<br/>
require cleaning,  peeling, cutting, etc - by me for the younger ones.<br/>
<br/>
  Anyways, the kids have really been enjoying my tendencies as of late to<br/>
say yes, or go ahead, or as much as you&#39;d like, lately.<br/>
<br/>
  How do others keep healthful food choices as available to themselves and<br/>
their kids as the shelf-stable more sugary/fried choices?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve always been a finger food kind of person, so I tend to make platters for the kids to share. I usually try to have a bit of everything: fruit/vegetable; protein; something crunchy. Lots of times I&#39;ll do color platters: orange, yellow, green. That way there&#39;s something for the kids to choose from and often when one thing&#39;s gone, they&#39;ll eat the others before coming for a refill.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I might make up an orange platter with carrot sticks, cantaloupe cubes, cheddar cheese sticks and cheese crackers. Or I might do a tray of cucumber circles/sticks, string beans, honey-dew melon, and guac tortilla chips. I started this when the kids were little, and they still think it&#39;s fun. We&#39;ll also do shapes sometimes: triangle triscuits, melon balls, square crackers, shape cheeses. I find that they really like cookie cutter shapes for sandwiches, cheese--anything that will cut well. And they really like cocktail toothpics, too. Those kinds of things go over big.<br/>
<br/>
I always think of the movie Mermaids when I do this kind of stuff. The mom only ever made hors d&#39;oevres--I forget why.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Something DS has fallen in love with are cheese shapes. We buy a big <br/>
block of cheddar and slice it about as thick as sugar cookie dough <br/>
then cut it with mini cookie cutters. Pop half a dozen give or take <br/>
into a ziplock bag - quick, fun, protein snack. He also likes just <br/>
getting out the slicer and the cheese and cutting some for himself <br/>
(he&#39;s 6). Those wire slicers don&#39;t cut skin easily so he can use it <br/>
himself (also slices eggs, kiwi, banana sections, strawberries,  <br/>
mushrooms and COOKED potatoes). As was mentioned, pre-sliced melon <br/>
chunks are a big hit here in summer. Yogurts (the 4 oz size seems to <br/>
be a better snack size than the 6 or 8 oz ones) are nice - when DS <br/>
was 2 or so, he&#39;d get out a yogurt, eat it, then toss both the <br/>
container and the spoon in the trash. It took us weeks to figure out <br/>
where all our spoons were disappearing to loL! Graham crackers with <br/>
PB, or Nutella, or assorted jams and jellies are fun - we keep it <br/>
all within DS&#39; range (with step stool as needed) so he can grab some <br/>
at will pretty much. We&#39;ll also hard boil a dozen eggs up at once <br/>
and have them available for snacking for a few days. Then again <br/>
there are times DS has pulled out a container of cold, no sauce, <br/>
pasta and grabbed a fork and that was his snack. Didn&#39;t even want us <br/>
to heat it up any. It&#39;s kind of funny I guess but we have a big bowl <br/>
of assorted candy bars sitting out and DS requested cheese shapes <br/>
for a snack yesterday. Last Friday at the ballpark (rain delay then <br/>
cancelled long story) DS asked for some cotton candy (a friend&#39;s DD <br/>
got some and he thought it was cool that they came right to the <br/>
seats with it). He ate about 1/3, decided it didn&#39;t taste so very <br/>
good and went back to eating his hot dog. (BTW their little DD, who <br/>
has fairly regulated food choices, wouldn&#39;t part with that cotton <br/>
candy for anything until she ate it right down to the paper cone).</div>
