<br/>
I have never had my kids teased by other kids, just quizzed by adults!  <br/>
When my kids encounter other kids who are being bratty or mean, they usually just don&#39;t get it.  They stand there looking  at these kids like they are from outer space!  They usually just ignore it and walk away.<br/>
The quizzing doesn&#39;t seem to bother them either.  They just say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.  It makes me furious, but since it doesn&#39;t matter at all to them I just let it go.<br/>

  Teach them to ignore rude people.<br/>
  Ignoring them will diffuse the situation.<br/>
  Besides tell your children that for every question they do not know, <br/>
  they are many others their &quot;friends&quot; will not be able to answer.<br/>
