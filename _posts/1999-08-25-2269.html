Well, naturally with a statement like that you will upset some people. But <br/>
that&#39;s what&#39;s great about America!   And old-fashioned may work great for <br/>
you.  I hope it does.  This decade in this house, it is working for us.  I&#39;m <br/>
at home; hubby works.  But 10-20 years ago -- our lives were different.  At <br/>
different times in the future I may do different things.  Other people have <br/>
other choices to make.  All are valid for that person.  Assuming they are <br/>
trying to do their best, learning and changing as needed,   saying there is <br/>
only one way to structure a family is as bad as saying there is only one way <br/>
to hs.  To me.  <br/>
<br/>
I just think this is an ongoing thread that crops up from time to time that <br/>
divides women.  We are often the ones dealing with the kid-related issues and <br/>
to say that there is only one right way is unnecessary and counterproductive, <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you and yours.<br/>

I have struggled with this divisiveness SO much personally.....having been a<br/>
working mom then a part time working-part time home mom currently stay at<br/>
home but struggling with the economics mom....<br/>
I have seen the divisiveness and it saddens me deeply because I hope we can<br/>
all support each other &quot;where each one is&quot;.<br/>
    Some people don&#39;t examine their choices or even believe they have<br/>
choices.....it&#39;s hard to know how to be supportive and yet challenge people<br/>
appropriately to have them consider all their choices.<br/>
    I know for me,  I&#39;ve only had 18 moths to explore myself in the SAHM<br/>
role.  I know my friends notice my sparkle of joy,  but it&#39;s been a real<br/>
challenge in many ways.<br/>
    Well,  gotta run and meet those challenges!<br/>
Susan<br/>
Keep me in your prayers!<br/>

I do not feel it is my job to challenge anyone.  Maybe my kids.   But not <br/>
other adults.  Supportive -- yes.  Anything else -- unless I am asked for <br/>
info -- well, let me put it this way -- I wouldn&#39;t like it if someone else <br/>
told me how to live.<br/>
<br/>
See, and you thought we were agreeing. :):):)<br/>
<br/>
Take care.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I am sure plenty of people won&#39;t agree with me but I do<br/>
 believe that God had the roles of men and women perfectly laid out and only<br/>
 our own selfishness has changed those roles. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Sorry I have been offline for a few days. I would just like to say that <br/>
e-mails are an imperfect form of communication as sometimes the meaning of <br/>
ones words can come across differently than what was intended. I believe this <br/>
has happened with my original comment. I was not meaning to sound judging or <br/>
hateful and later when I had thought about it more, I felt I could have <br/>
worded it better. My personal feelings are not something I expect everyone to <br/>
share. I apologize for any hard feelings.<br/>
Blessings, Lori in TX</div>
