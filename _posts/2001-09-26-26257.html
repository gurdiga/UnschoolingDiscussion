<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374628913">Just an update. The web sites listed in the subject line do not present any<br/>
danger of infection. Although the server was partially infected by the<br/>
W32-Nimda worm, only the script that is supposed to deliver the payload was<br/>
active. The file that causes the damage (readme.exe or an outlook e-mail<br/>
file containing it) was not present.<br/>
<br/>
If you visit the sites, you may notice a minimized second browser window<br/>
that opens with a &quot;file not found error.&quot; If the worm had been fully<br/>
functional, that browser window would have linked to the virus file and you<br/>
would have had a message asking you if you wanted to download and run a file<br/>
name readme.exe or *.eml.<br/>
<br/>
If you have up-to-date anti-virus software running, it will detect the<br/>
script and give you a virus warning, but since the infectious file is not<br/>
present, there is no danger. If you do not have any anti-virus protection,<br/>
you may notice the minimized second browser window, but again there is no<br/>
danger of infection. On a PC, the browser window can be closed by right<br/>
clicking on the icon in the task bar and choosing &quot;Close.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You should never download and run a file from any web site you visit unless<br/>
you know exactly what it is.<br/>
<br/>
I am pleased to say that there is currently no danger of infection from<br/>
visiting our web sites and we hope to have all traces of the worm removed<br/>
soon.<br/>

==== previous message =======<br/>
One of the servers I lease space on fell victim to the W32-Nimda worm. The<br/>
above sites were knocked off-line on Tuesday and came back on-line today<br/>
infected with the W32-Nimda worm. All major anti-virus software companies<br/>
have updates to avoid infection and you can go to http://www.sarc.com for<br/>
more information or to run a free check on your system.<br/>
<br/>
If you visit the above sites you may be prompted to download an eml file. Do<br/>
not download the file! If you download the file, then open it, you can<br/>
become infected. Just visiting the web site should not infect your computer.<br/>
Your anti-virus software may detect the virus script and give you a warning.<br/>
Just do not download and open any eml (OutLook format email file) and you<br/>
should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
This worm normally is spread by e-mail and the email form has the nasty<br/>
capability to infect you using a MIME exploit that allows the virus to be<br/>
executed just by reading or previewing the file. Information and a patch for<br/>
this exploit can be found at<br/>
&lt;http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS01-020.asp&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you have visited any site that prompted you to download and open an eml<br/>
file, and you did so, you may be infected. Please visit the SARC site<br/>
(http://www.sarc.com)  and check your system. I apologize for any<br/>
inconvenience you may have experienced from visiting one of our sites.<br/>
Technicians are working to eliminate the virus and restore the server to<br/>
normal operation.<br/>
