 face="Comic Sans MS">I haven&#39;t really considered the term &#39;de-schooling&#39; for 
some time since we have been homeschooling for awhile, but I think your 
right!&nbsp; I will get The Teenage Liberation Handbook, I&#39;ve been meaning to 
for awhile!&nbsp; It is so funny how things come around!&nbsp; My older daughter 
(14YO) has done well with a curriculum, and I will leave it up to her this year 
if she wants to follow a path, or etch out her own.&nbsp; She has an anxiety 
disorder and is pretty much worried about getting a good education!&nbsp; I 
don&#39;t have to push her very hard!&nbsp; My 10yo OTOH, will fare much better if 
she is allowed to chose what she learns.&nbsp; I tried and tried for a couple of 
years to get her to learn her multiplication tables.&nbsp; I made flash cards 
for her, bought her favorite character math books, but being forced into it, I 
can see how her brain has resisted.&nbsp; So I finally gave up and then one day, 
not to long after, she just started spouting answers to multiplication problems, 
she just learned it one month on her own!&nbsp; I guess it is hardest for me to 
just &quot;let go&quot; and let them do their own learning!&nbsp; But I 
sincerely believe now that children&#39;s brains do not learn when they are 
forced!&nbsp; </font></div>
<div><font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry this is so long!&nbsp; I am just anxious 
to start letting my kids really learn!</font></div>
<div><font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for listening!</font></div>

    Kim,<br><br>What you are describing sounds like you have to 
    &quot;de-school&quot; them.&nbsp; Have you<br>read&nbsp; &quot;The Teenage 
    Liberation Handbook&quot;.??.. your girls might be ready&nbsp; to<br>read 
    that for themselves.<br><br>I read it twice and now I gave it to my 11 year 
    old to read so he can<br>understand the unschooling way better--in terms of 
    options and ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; .<br>We have always been child-led but for my 
    kid...he needs some direction.<br>This year since he is technically doing 
    upper middle school /high school<br>level work , I told him we would be more 
    hands-off.&nbsp; It will be more<br>directed my him as to what he wants to 
    study.<br><br>Each year I have him sit down and do a list of things he might 
    want to<br>investigate or study..... we don&#39;t stick to it but its a starting 
    point.<br>When we run out of ideas or get bored we try to remember what was 
    on the<br>list to see if its sounds interesting or not and go from 
    there.<br><br>In the meantime,,, we just &quot;live&quot;&nbsp; !!!!.&nbsp; 
    Between activities, the dog, the<br>house, the shopping, the meal 
    prep,visiting our friends, volunteer work,<br>the laundry, field trips and 
    our huge appetite for books and&nbsp; going to the<br>library....<br><br>We 
    have been mostly &quot;unschoolers&quot; for years but have in just the past 
    few<br>years gone to a more text approach for math only.<br><br>It takes 
    time to come up with your own family&#39;s rhythm.<br><br>Good luck<br>Jeanne in 
    Wisconsin<br><br><br><br></tt><tt>Message boards, timely articles, a
