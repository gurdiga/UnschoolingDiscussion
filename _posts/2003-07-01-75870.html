Looks like a Tupperwear Party selling curriculum... maybe people<br/>
don&#39;t want to leave because homeschoolers like to talk to one<br/>
another?<br/>

Education Explorations ... <br/>
Our Workshops ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Our workshops are a wonderful learning experience, for every parent<br/>
who attends one of our Education Explorations Home Parties. <br/>
<br/>
With a broad range of topics, that change each spring and fall, you<br/>
will always have new topics to choose and explore, experience and<br/>
enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
The host/ess of each party chooses the topic of their choice. <br/>
<br/>
The Resource Consultant then shares in a seminar style for about<br/>
10-15 minutes on the topic chosen, inviting input, questions and<br/>
feedback as they go. <br/>
<br/>
Once this portion is over, it is usually followed up with group<br/>
discussion, questions and answers. <br/>
<br/>
Then the group will enjoy fun activities, quizzes or games (all in<br/>
fun) to further establish what has been covered in the workshop. <br/>
<br/>
Once this portion is complete, guests will receive one or more<br/>
handouts, pertaining to the topic that has been covered. Your<br/>
Resource Consultant will also give you some examples of some of the<br/>
products we carry, that relate to the topic of the workshop. <br/>
<br/>
This is a unique concept in the home party world and one that has<br/>
been well loved by all who have attended one of our parties. <br/>
<br/>
Our Resource Consultants have said they have trouble leaving a<br/>
party, because everyone gets so involved talking and sharing with<br/>
one another, it is too much fun to want to leave. <br/>
<br/>
We view this as a great thing! <br/>
<br/>
We hope you will enjoy this experience soon, with your friends. <br/>
