a very subtle way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025545055">I&#39;m getting a really good list.  I&#39;ll look up the name of the book we bought<br/>
this weekend.  He reads it at work (he stays after his shift because he gets<br/>
a free lunch (Italian restaurant with original Noni recipes, child is<br/>
getting spoiled &lt;g&gt;) while he has lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we do, however, have to keep in mind that remember things besides the<br/>
phone numbers that girls give him is not a priority at the moment, it might<br/>
take a couple of days to get the book home &lt;g&gt;<br/>
