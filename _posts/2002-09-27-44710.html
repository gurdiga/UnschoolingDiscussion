<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467348018">We have been unschooling for 3-4 weeks now. I am still working on<br/>
letting go of my anxiety around it. When ever family members, etc. ask<br/>
what I am teaching the kids, is it working and so on this irks/stresses<br/>
me. My 14 year old son with dyslexia and mood disorder is calming down a<br/>
bit. He came to me and told me he wants to learn more about our town<br/>
history but doesn&#39;t want to talk to any one but me - he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
go to any historical meetings, etc. Really both of the boys are sitting<br/>
around doing what ever they feel like doing. The younger of the two is<br/>
always making something as a project. The older of the two has been so<br/>
traumatized by &quot;school&quot; that I am happy he even asked to learn anything.<br/>
There is an old sign painted on the back of an old building in our town.<br/>
It is the last sign/advertisement on any building in our town. The other<br/>
buildings were all washed away during a flood. I asked him if he wanted<br/>
to go take a picture of the advertisement and explained to him that was<br/>
how it used to be done. He looked at me like I was an alien so I guessed<br/>
that was a no. :)<br/>
Really when I stop and think of it I have been thinking &quot;outside the<br/>
box&quot; fairly often. I was sexually abused by 5 family members for 17<br/>
years which included 3 pregnancies at 9, 10, and 15. Society wasn&#39;t<br/>
ready to hear about that when I was ready to deal with it. I became very<br/>
strong - some would say a &quot;b&quot; word and made it through the years of<br/>
healing by allowing myself what I needed to heal. Some of that was<br/>
spiritual/seeing, feeling, etc. of spirit. During that time I let this<br/>
part go for the most part because I feared being labeled as a lunatic.<br/>
After 4 years of post-traumatic memories, etc. I began my own group, put<br/>
together conferences and was the editor/publisher of a newsletter for 6<br/>
years for incest survivors. I won 7 awards. I was able to concentrate on<br/>
helping those who wanted help instead of those who said no one ever gets<br/>
molested. The laughable statistic at the time was 1 in a million people<br/>
get molested. I know it&#39;s half. I also know the national birth<br/>
statistics start at 10. Public school books say puberty can start at 8.<br/>
A huge survery in Africa stated puberty starts at 7 for some. Anyway, I<br/>
was able to work through some extremely terrifying times by thinking<br/>
outside the box. <br/>
I now have gone back to my spirituality in a big way. I have been<br/>
working with Reiki - spiritually guided life force energy - for 5 years.<br/>
I mostly send it at a distance although I give hands on healings, too. I<br/>
attend a spiritualist church and give healings and psychic readings<br/>
there as well as over the internet for free. I rarely charge any money.<br/>
This brings me to my 14 year old. He is very empathic/psychic. He sees<br/>
and hears spirit. I have never told my 6 kids they can&#39;t see, feel,<br/>
hear, etc. what they have told me they are seeing, etc. Since my first<br/>
child was young enough to talk she told me she talked to and saw spirit.<br/>
We have had some interesting experiences. I think bipolar is living half<br/>
in earth energy and half in spiritual energy. I suppose that is<br/>
unscientific. My life has been an unschooling experience in many ways. I<br/>
have passed this along to my kids unexpectedly. Michele<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-232300756">Wow Michele,<br/>
You&#39;ve been through alot, and it sounds like you are doing so well!  I often think alot about the things you touched on in your message... the bipolar part especially.  Noone will talk about these things, and then when they do it seems like they medicate the person,  I wish I knew more about this.  I know of someone now that just told me her son and daughter see visions and I was flabbergasted (sp?)  I guess I have never known anyone personally.. .<br/>
Its very sad that these people can&#39;t talk about it,  maybe if society was more open to these kind-of ideas we would learn more about it.  And maybe there is alot known about it and I&#39;m just uneducated on it&lt;g&gt;,,,,,anyway,  Michele you get a huge &quot;Good Job!&quot;  on your healing from me; and also in listening to your children, hope I can be as open minded and loving with mine!<br/>
Take Care, <br/>
Kelli <br/>
