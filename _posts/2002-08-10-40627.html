<div id="ygrps-yiv-200900181">I am pretty much a lurker but I happen to enjoy very much Ned&#39;s discussions<br/>
and don&#39;t understand why the list would want to silence him or have him go<br/>
elsewhere. I believe that what he has to say is VERY relevant. I have two<br/>
children who are very much into the truth and have trouble with hypocracy. I<br/>
could hear them saying the very things that the homeschooling family in Mass<br/>
said and so I have been very interested in hearing about the case even tho I<br/>
live in Florida which has very easy homeschool regs.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have learned how to make the state happy (even if they have to<br/>
lie to do so) and some people feel the need to stand on their priciples at<br/>
great personal loss. Many times it is the people who stand on their<br/>
principles that are the ones that really make the changes in how things are.<br/>
If they never challenged the law, then there could never be any change. It<br/>
is a ashame from what I am seeing on the list that the homeschoolers aren&#39;t<br/>
standing behind this family.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it is something built into our personalities the one&#39;s fighting for<br/>
principles and the ones that placate and maybe the two types have trouble<br/>
seeing eye to eye and appreciating each other. I would hope that this list<br/>
could be tolerant enough to accept both.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, I think I&#39;ve figured out how to express what bothers me. (I knew if I<br/>
threw enough words at it I&#39;d figure it out ;-) It isn&#39;t Ned&#39;s *particular*<br/>
political point of view that I&#39;d like to send elsewhere. It&#39;s having a<br/>
*single* political point of view being expressed.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s *very* interesting hearing a viewpoint that&#39;s so totally<br/>
different from mine. If this were the debate folder in AOL&#39;s old<br/>
homeschooling forum I&#39;d *love* to debate this. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t have a debate folder or any way of shuttling off a very large<br/>
specialized discussion. The list is one great big messy it. And people<br/>
signed up to discuss unschooling. Which means that if one person does want<br/>
to express his political point of view if the rest of us go on discussing<br/>
unschooling, that one person&#39;s view becomes the defacto political point of<br/>
view of the list. I&#39;m not accusing Ned of doing that or wanting that. It&#39;s<br/>
just how groups work. If no one disagrees, it appears everyone agrees.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to unschoolers for Ned&#39;s to be the only political<br/>
point of view expressed nor for it to appear he speaks for everyone. I think<br/>
it&#39;s far more valuable for there to be a diverse political point of view.<br/>
Which means that since I strongly disagree with Ned that I, and anyone else<br/>
who values more than one viewpoint being heard, need to point out where we<br/>
disagree and why and discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
Political discussions being the way they are, they can&#39;t be handled in a few<br/>
short posts. To offer a diverse -- or even just *one* other! -- political<br/>
viewpoint the list would be taken over -- as it has for the past few days --<br/>
by political discussion. And the people who discuss unschooling would be<br/>
spending their energy in the political discussion. The overall quantity of<br/>
emails would go up but the quality and quantity of unschooling discussion --<br/>
which is what people signed up for -- would go down. (It&#39;s not a<br/>
speculation. I&#39;ve seen it happen numerous times when one discussion<br/>
overwhelms the list. People get shorter and fewer answers to their<br/>
unschooling questions.)<br/>
<br/>
So the choices seem to be: 1) to have one political point of view expressed,<br/>
2) to have the list filled with political discussion or 3) to have no<br/>
political points of view. (Or at least as close as can be achieved.)<br/>
<br/>
Suggesting Ned take the discussion somewhere else is like asking someone to<br/>
take a very loud and overwhelming specialized discussion to another room so<br/>
that those who came to *this* room to discuss unschooling can do so.<br/>
<br/>
I think Pam suggested NHEN&#39;s Legislative list.<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/NHEN-Legislative)">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/NHEN-Legislative)</a>. There are also loads of<br/>
other lists at Yahoo. And Ned could even start his own. (Or someone could<br/>
start one and invite Ned to join :-)<br/>

homeschooling forum. Doesn&#39;t AOL still have the homeschooling forum? Just <br/>
curious as to why the word old is stuck in there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200510050">&quot;In an effort to end the flame fanning, I asked Sandra not to respond <br/>
to my<br/>
posts. She can&#39;t resist. Now she wants us all to think I don&#39;t know <br/>
what I&#39;m<br/>
talking about because she guesses I was never in band. She seems to <br/>
need me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
See how that&#39;s in quotes Ned? That means I&#39;m quoting someone else and <br/>
responding to that quote.....<br/>
YOU are fanning the flames by ignoring the list owner, moderator and <br/>
long time supporters by not dropping the political discussion.<br/>
It is quite obvious what your agenda is and it angers me that you <br/>
blame Sandra.<br/>
I think you have marvelous things to say about unschooling, I&#39;ve read <br/>
some of it in the past.<br/>
I wish you would honor everyone&#39;s requests and focus on unschooling. <br/>
You&#39;ve been asked politely, not so politely, begged and yet you <br/>
continue.<br/>
<br/>
Why? <br/>
