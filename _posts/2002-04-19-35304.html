Here in FL they have a &quot;dual enrollment&quot; program for kids age 15 and up. They <br/>
can go for free and it counts as their HS credit. Many homeschoolers here <br/>
take advantage of this program....the requirement is they must pass the <br/>
entrance exam.<br/>

grade requirements or anything - the absolute only requirement is: 18 and/or <br/>
a high school graduate. Anyone 18 or a high school grad can go, <br/>
automatically. And they MAY allow younger students to enroll, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203862633">I also wanted to mention about that credit/nocredit option. <br/>
<br/>
Many of what are referred to as &quot;academic&quot; courses are not offered as <br/>
credit/no credit. I teach Economics and Statistics - credit/no credit is not <br/>
available for my courses. Also - the credit/no credit grade doesn&#39;t get <br/>
counted in your GPA by the community college, but when you apply to a <br/>
university, they can decide to count it any way they want to count it and can <br/>
consider it however they want to consider it. For those hoping to transfer, <br/>
eventually, to the highly selective universities, having academic courses <br/>
with only a &quot;credit&quot; but no grade, might not look all that great. Same with <br/>
having a lot of &quot;W&#39;s&quot; on your transcript -- it won&#39;t matter at all if you <br/>
withdrew from a bunch of courses, to most colleges. But if you&#39;re applying to <br/>
highly selective, competitive universities, it might be held against you.<br/>
