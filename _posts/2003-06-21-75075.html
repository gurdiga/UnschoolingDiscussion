I got Kirby a copy of a little paper back (little novel size, I mean) called <br/>
(I think) &quot;What&#39;s Happening to my Body?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was a little older, I got him a copy too (used bookstore, both <br/>
times) and he said &quot;I already read Kirby&#39;s,&quot; and I said he should keep it anyway <br/>
in case he wanted to check something a few years up the line, or in case one <br/>
of his friends needed to borrow it.<br/>
<br/>
I looked it up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Amazon has LOTS for sale, used, some less than a dollar (plus shipping).  One <br/>
14 cents. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s very commonly available!! <br/>

Well the two books I have aren&#39;t just talking about puberty issues. They<br/>
talk about everything from that to having babies. Pretty good and rather<br/>
light reading. The kind my kids have just picked up and skimmed through the<br/>
parts that interested them. They are 7 and 8. Boy and girl stuff too.<br/>

<br/>
highly recommended by my 15 yr old boy who read it in one sitting when he <br/>
was 12 and has read only two books since then!<br/>
