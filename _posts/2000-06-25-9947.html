<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471948967">Well Dia, I have to say that  I agree with you on this one. I&#39;m sure that <br/>
more moms would stay at home if they were given the respect they deserve. <br/>
There&#39;s kind of a stigma attached to being a &quot;housewife&quot;  Not to mention , <br/>
has anyone ever sat down what you would be owed if you were paid a salary? <br/>
My husband would go bankrupt paying me! Allthat laundry , food service, <br/>
childcare, yardwork, If you itemized everything and charged the going rate <br/>
for these services- can you imagine? tee hee.<br/>
