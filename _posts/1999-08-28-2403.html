<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714829147">My teenage liberation began at age 16. In a very unconventional way, i<br/>
became pregnant and got married. I got a real life and real education.<br/>
Mother hood was just what i needed. I t fulfilled my nurturing<br/>
instincts. And i learned by living, making mistakes along the way. My<br/>
children are now teenagers them selves, while i wouldn&#39;t want my<br/>
daughter to start so young as i did, I commend her for wanting to be a<br/>
wife and mother when she &#39;grows up&#39;. Its an excellent choice for a young<br/>
woman to make. We need more loving, nurturing, content stay at home<br/>
moms. But who says it so wrong to be a mother at 16, now i don&#39;t condone<br/>
premarital sex and it&#39;s much nicer to have a spouse to help with raising<br/>
children. But if a young couple wants to marry and start a family whats<br/>
to stop them. If one wanted to do any other job there wouldn&#39;t be much<br/>
to hold them back if they were educated in that line. Are ya&#39;ll<br/>
following me?<br/>
 We are a diverse group, we home/un schoolers, and have much to offer<br/>
the world and each other.<br/>
We can give each other new ideas and the support we need.<br/>
And yes i do believe in marrige and the traditional family unit, i am a<br/>
follower of Jesus and believe his ways are best. And I would never have<br/>
&#39;made it&#39; with out Him to guide me in my decisions.<br/>
I enjoy everyone one and though i don&#39;t agree with the choices some make<br/>
in thier lives it doesn&#39;t mean i can&#39;t be their friend. And if one thing<br/>
in their life is against what i believe it doesn&#39;t mean the rest of them<br/>
is fouled, we have much to offer one another.  We have choices. Jesus<br/>
gave us that gift of choice in creation. He doesn&#39;t want us to love and<br/>
serve him<br/>
because we have to but because we want to.<br/>
ok, i&#39;m done, i think....thanks Deborah</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835397122">Expressions of tolerance from the Christian folk out there are very welcome<br/>
and greatly appreciated.  The willingness to be &quot;friends&quot; with people who<br/>
make choices with which you disagree is truly a virtue.  I also think of it<br/>
as Christian in what I consider the &quot;best&quot; sense of the word.<br/>
