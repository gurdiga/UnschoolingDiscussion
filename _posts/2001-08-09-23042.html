<div id="ygrps-yiv-522867096">&lt;&lt;when i learned that the federal government has established a fund to <br/>
&#39;compensate&#39; victims and families for injuries and deaths from<br/>
vaccinations. <br/>
(it must&#39;ve happened a few times)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
so very sad.  Also, there are MANY more cases that never get &#39;officially&#39;<br/>
blamed on vaccines, since the medical community has every resource under<br/>
the sun to blame an injury or death on some other source.  It is very<br/>
hard to get any doctor/hospital/whatever to blame a vaccine, even if it&#39;s<br/>
blatently obvious.  <br/>
I&#39;m not neccessarily anti-vaccine (we do selected vaccines, on a delayed<br/>
schedule) but I am very wary of blindly trusting the government to decide<br/>
for me when the best time to vaccinate is.  It has little to do with when<br/>
the vaccine is the most effective, and more to do with how convenient it<br/>
is for the medical community to chart it. <br/>
By delaying my children&#39;s tetnus shot (and ONLY the tetenus, no D or P<br/>
with it!) to after a year, they only needed one and not the standard 3<br/>
(or is it 4?) doses that most infants get.   works for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-800297823">Sharon, any of the vaccines can give your children vaccine induced autism or worse.  Many children die every day or are harmed in many other ways daily from vaccines.  If you would like to email me personally I can give you more places to find this information out for yourself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-483831458">Hi Sharon.<br/>
<br/>
Rachel had many vaccines that fateful day, so I don&#39;t know which one exactly, but it doesn&#39;t really matter because it can happen with any of them.<br/>
I have about 50,000 (only a slight exaggeration) links to info about the dangers of vaccines which I would be happy to pass along, if you&#39;re interested. <br/>
<br/>
For now, I&#39;ll just send alond a list of vaccine ingredients. As you read them, think about if you yourself would drink a concoction of this stuff, and yet we are injecting these poisons directly into our childrens little bodies. It really is a crime.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Extremely important information from the New England Journal of<br/>
&gt;&gt; Medicine regarding the rush to vaccinate people against smallpox. This<br/>
&gt;&gt; is especially important information for people with hiv, asthma,<br/>
&gt;&gt; rheumatoid arthritis and eczema (atopic dermatitis) and other<br/>
&gt;&gt; immune-deficiencies.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband is active duty military.  He just finished the anthrax series.<br/>
But the military IS aware of the problems with the smallpox vaccine, and<br/>
takes them seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Our son has eczema.  The army declined to vaccinate Alan based on that, and<br/>
won&#39;t unless there&#39;s a possible exposure.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Does it say anywhere how long one would have to worry when exposing<br/>
&gt;themselves to someone who had the vaccination? Otherwords, if someone gets<br/>
&gt;vaccinated against smallpox, how long would someone have to stay away to<br/>
&gt;make sure they didn&#39;t catch it??<br/>
