<br/>
A mom at the park yesterday has some worries about autisim and Asperger&#39;s<br/>
being linked to food allergies.  Have any of you heard anything about that?<br/>
 (She wasn&#39;t extremely clear, but I&#39;d still like to help her.)<br/>
<br/>
She is breastfeeding a 7 month old who is allergic to many of the foods<br/>
that the mother eats.  (Gets hyper if she eats them and stays up til<br/>
midnight.)  She has restricted her diet, but giving up wheat and dairy and<br/>
several other things does get to be a burden.  She&#39;s anxious about the long<br/>
term effect of her diet on her infant.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone point me in the right direction for more research?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Betsy</div>

If she wants reassurance that breastfeeding (and for <br/>
such an allergic child, the longer it&#39;s exclusive, <br/>
probably the better) is not going to damage her or the <br/>
child, and also for basic allergy stuff, I&#39;d start with <br/>
LLL&#39;s website, www.lalecheleague.org  if there&#39;s a <br/>
group in your area, so much the better.  It might have <br/>
a different name over there, but there&#39;s a professional <br/>
liasion panel, where a LLL Leader can ask a medical <br/>
professional about specific queries which strictly <br/>
speaking fall outside a Leader&#39;s specific <br/>
responsibility/experience.  Also, there&#39;s an &#39;ask the <br/>
experts&#39; message board at www.promom.org  HTH<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went through a lot of this last summer when my daughter was about the same<br/>
age. My son (also nursing) had a severe food allergy reaction and I had to<br/>
eliminate tons of stuff from my diet. For several months there I was eating<br/>
no meat, dairy, fish, shellfish, nuts, soy products, or gluten .... which as<br/>
you can guess basically left me with almost nothing to eat! Both of my<br/>
nurslings were fine through this period, even my daughter who was almost<br/>
exclusively breastfed (she was just starting to get some solids). She<br/>
weighed 25 lbs at one year old, so I know she wasn&#39;t starving, LOL. BTW, we<br/>
used the NAET treatments I mentioned above to totally get rid of my son&#39;s<br/>
allergies.<br/>
