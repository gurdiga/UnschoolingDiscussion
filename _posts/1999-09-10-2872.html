<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600827162"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I&#39;m in Richland.  Do you ever get over this way?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We just moved from Richland in March.  My parents, and my DH parents live<br/>
in the Tri Cities, as well as my closest brother and his family.  I was<br/>
asking because there seem to be an awful lot of Unschoolers in that area.<br/>
I have been subtly working on &quot;converting&quot; my brother and his wife.  She is<br/>
in the last stretch of her certification to teach High School, but she has<br/>
told me she would much rather stay home with the girls (ages 4 and 2.5) and<br/>
homeschool them.  My brother still does not know what he wants to be when<br/>
he grows up, and he cannot currently support them on his salary alone.<br/>
They have been very receptive and interested in the information I have<br/>
passed along regarding Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sorry, this isn&#39;t exactly unschooling, except that it&#39;s life which is all<br/>
&gt;learning! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Honey, EVERYTHING&#39;S Unschooling!!<br/>
