<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020386939">**<br/>
I have still acquaintances whose kids go to public school.  Today one<br/>
said that she asked my son if I had given any homework and when he said<br/>
no, she came up to me and told me her second grader already had her<br/>
first spelling test today and implied that I had a lot of catching up to<br/>
do.**<br/>
<br/>
I have confidence that my son doesn&#39;t need to drill on spelling or<br/>
grammar in order to learn to read and write his native language.  (English)<br/>
<br/>
However... the same confidence doesn&#39;t always follow with respect to<br/>
Math.  There are a lot of words in our everyday life, but not so many numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts about strewing a little more math into our lives?<br/>

I have to laugh at myself.  About an hour after I wrote this, my mom<br/>
called me up and asked me what we were doing for math this year!  (She&#39;s<br/>
also concerned about James&#39; handwriting.)  But... she did tell me that<br/>
she thinks he will pick up grammar and spelling naturally, from reading.<br/>
<br/>
It cracks me up that my mom and I share the same anxieties.  Maybe it&#39;s genetic!<br/>

standard of measurement to help him grasp relationships. (It&#39;s more<br/>

Not a number in the whole deal, and fairly difficult puzzles, too.  All logic <br/>

Logic in words would be a good way to &quot;do some math&quot; without numbers too.  <br/>
Logic puzzles, one-minute mysteries, Mind Trap (card game with various &quot;brain <br/>

Once I decide to keep a &quot;Maths journal&quot; for a week, just noting where/how the kids  or I used Maths in our everyday life. It was an eye opener. I suggest it as another way of being conscious of the maths around us, and  of how our kids are absorbing Maths ideas in their every day life...Leonie W. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085062729">Good news!  While I was sitting here reading your reply, Joyce, my son<br/>
came in and asked me to play &quot;multiplication war&quot;, a card game that I<br/>
made based on PamS&#39;s suggestion.  A good time was had by all.  My son<br/>
even &quot;Yee-haa&#39;ed&quot; a few times when he got good cards.<br/>
<br/>
**There&#39;s a Dorling Kindersley book that used to be called Comparisons<br/>
but I<br/>
think has a different title now?**<br/>
<br/>
Is this the type of book that shows how many kangaroos stacked one on<br/>
top of the other it takes to reach the top of the Empire State building?<br/>
 Those can be cool.<br/>
<br/>
I love DK books, because I am seduced by the pictures.  I have to<br/>
realize that I&#39;m a lot more visual than my son.  When I&#39;m looking for a<br/>
great math book for him, I have to tear my eyes away from the juicy<br/>
pictures and actually evaluate the text, preferably by reading it outloud.<br/>
<br/>
**But above all speak math. Walkthrough solving problems out loud.<br/>
(Stick to<br/>
problems he asks, like how long until Christmas...**<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, I think you must be psychic.  (Maybe your daughter is only a year<br/>
or so older than James, 8.)  He frequently asks me how long it is until<br/>
Xmas, his birthday, or Halloween.  I can &quot;show my work&quot; for him when I<br/>
calculate it out loud.  (For some reason, this question always comes up<br/>
in the car, not anywhere near a calendar.)<br/>
<br/>
**(It&#39;s more<br/>
meaningful to translate 18 feet into 3 Daddy&#39;s for instance. Some of the<br/>
ones I use are a story which is 10 ft, 3000 miles across the US, 600 miles<br/>
from Boston to Pittsburgh as units of measurement.)**<br/>
<br/>
OK.  Time for me to figure out where our measuring tape disappeared to.<br/>
<br/>
**The reason math in school takes so long is they need to substitue<br/>
drill for<br/>
understanding. It&#39;s really hard to do pages of problems like 7.5% of 182<br/>
when you don&#39;t know and don&#39;t care what percents are. If the understanding<br/>
is there first, the details are *much* easier.**<br/>
<br/>
I think the amount of mathematical drill done in school is ridiculous. <br/>
I need to get comfortable with the idea that maybe will spend only 5 or<br/>
10 percent as much time on math as a school does.  I don&#39;t think we will<br/>
ever be doing/talking math an hour every day, unless we have another<br/>
Monopoly marathon.<br/>
<br/>
James did get to hear an explanation of percents in the car, recently. <br/>
But it was aimed at his dad and I don&#39;t know how much of it was<br/>
accessible to him.  Dh and I were thinking about investments and<br/>
speculating about what an increase in interest rates might do to the<br/>
stock market.  I was babbling to my dh about &quot;return on investment&quot; and<br/>
&quot;price-earnings ratio&quot;.  <br/>

to see it that way. My kids have knows the concept of fractions at a very <br/>
early age just by cutting their toast in the morning!! Fractions can apply <br/>
to many things in that way.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids help feed the puppies or cook or bake, all kinds of numbers <br/>
come about. And then there&#39;s board games. My kids love Monopoly. When <br/>
they&#39;re cleaning up and sorting through their toys, there&#39;s grouping and <br/>
adding and multiplying. We wrap coins and just dividing up snacks for the 3 <br/>
kids start number thinking. You just have to look at it differently.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes!  Money!<br/>
If kids have their own money they get to make real choices about saving<br/>
or spending or just counting it over and over again like some people I<br/>
know.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Money is a real part of life and has real meaning to kids who have some<br/>
to spend.  They have to figure out if they have enough for both toys or<br/>
just one, etc.  <br/>
Kids need help figuring for a while but not for long.  Don&#39;t make them do<br/>
the calculating on their own if they&#39;re not ready because that&#39;s just<br/>
frustrating and a bummer, but lots of experience with money gives kids<br/>
lot&#39;s of exposure to real life math. <br/>

Hi, Pam --<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  We have a lot of different shaped dice and sometimes like to<br/>
substitute one type for another.  (Knights and Castles is an Aristoplay<br/>
game with a board layout like Parcheesi, and we roll the 6 sided die to<br/>
&quot;start&quot; a man, but the 20 sided die to get him around the board quicker.)<br/>
<br/>
I went thrift shopping yesterday and came home with Survive, Pirateer<br/>
and TAKE-OFF.  In TAKE-OFF you have to fly a fleet of planes through a<br/>
web of flight paths connecting cities around the world.  And we had to<br/>
make up the rules as the rules were missing, even though the little<br/>
packages of parts were unopened.<br/>
