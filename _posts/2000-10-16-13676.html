<div id="ygrps-yiv-421529231">We too had trouble with recurring ear infections and our chiropracter helped<br/>
us to figure out that it was A.) dairy/wheat in the diet and B.) I was a<br/>
strep carrier - so, once we tackled these two things - she never had an ear<br/>
infection again until I tried dairy about 12 months later.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, she is now 5 and can handle dairy in her diet (no, she does<br/>
not drink cows milk or eat ice cream) - but limited dairy does not affect<br/>
her anymore.  My friend had told me that she had read somewhere that kids,<br/>
if they show early signs of dairy allergies, once the product is removed and<br/>
slowly introduced, by age 5 they have usually grown out of the problem.  So<br/>
far, this seems to be the case for us.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we too began calling ourselves unschoolers when Dana was 22mos.  Folks<br/>
would look at us funny, and other people on other lists chastised me for<br/>
&quot;labelling&quot; her that - but we did anyway and we still do - and we are all<br/>
the better for it.  Had I not given myself permission to &quot;wander&quot;, I don&#39;t<br/>
think I would have become the person I am today.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
