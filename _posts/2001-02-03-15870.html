<div id="ygrps-yiv-748891926">Dear Sandi,<br/>
<br/>
I want to say that your long post on your experience with abortion and your <br/>
early pregnancy was the most compassionate and meaningful thing I have read <br/>
on that subject EVER. One truly has to have been there and you said it. <br/>
Thank you so much for taking the time to post. I know exactly what you are <br/>
talking about. Our society shuns and shames girls for getting pregnant and <br/>
their own moms don&#39;t come to their baby showers. I have seen it happen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the good news is that there is an easy way to reduce abortion and it <br/>
is working: access to birth control. This has a long-term effect in that <br/>
women who are not overwhelmed at a young age by the responsibility and <br/>
expense of children are able to finish their education, settle into a stable <br/>
relationship and then have kids they can support emotionally and <br/>
financially.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to a better and more compassionate world.<br/>
<br/>
Annette<br/>

Annette wrote that, but I agree totally.<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to have the snapshots of people&#39;s life stories, but quite a <br/>
more powerful thing to have the experience laid out in order, long term.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with that 100%, but it does not always work.  I myself had an <br/>
allergic reaction to the pill, and when I became pregnant with our son, we <br/>
had used a condom.  I think it is very important to make sure young men and <br/>
women truly understand all of the risks involved, even when using <br/>
protection. I think a lot of them think that these work 100% of the time, <br/>
and they do not. It takes more than putting your daughter on the pill or <br/>
buying your son a box of condoms.   Though freer access to birth control <br/>
can go a heck of a long way towards cutting down, open communication and <br/>
honesty with our children about their sexuality could go a long way too.<br/>
