<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088401414">My friend asked me to post a question for her about her son&#39;s food <br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
One day for lunch she took her two kids to an outdoor mall which had <br/>
several restaurants. My friend and her daughter wanted to get <br/>
something from the Una Mas.  Her son, however, eats a limited number <br/>
of things and did not want anything to eat from this restaurant, but <br/>
expressed that he would love a cookie from the Starbucks.<br/>
<br/>
Since he hadn&#39;t eaten since breakfast, should she insist/gently <br/>
persuade/shove down his troat a quesadilla? Or, should she say, &quot;I&#39;d <br/>
love to get you a cookie as soon as your sister and I are done with <br/>
our meal here at the Una Mas.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am, I mean, she is interested in knowing your thoughts. ;)<br/>

What I would have done was get the cookie and a drink from Starbucks <br/>
first.  Then he could bring his food over to a table while I ordered <br/>
and eat my food at the outdoor restaurant.  He could have been happily <br/>
munching his cookie then rather than having to wait and watch you eat <br/>
first.  Kinda mean to make him wait.  KWIM?<br/>

 <br/>
Just get him the cookie!  For crying out loud, who cares what he eats  from <br/>
one 4 hour period to the next?<br/>
 <br/>
And why make him wait to get the cookie until after you and his SISTER  eat?  <br/>
Is that some kind of bizarre punishment you&#39;re doing to make him  eat?  It&#39;s <br/>
totally missing the point of food autonomy, I&#39;ll tell you  that.<br/>

friends to a place with food that&#39;s repulsive to you (chicken liver and <br/>
pigs feet?). Should they make you wait until they&#39;re done with their <br/>
meal before they go with you to get a piece of double fudge cake that&#39;s <br/>
calling to you? Or should they insist you have some pigs feet and <br/>
chicken livers first?<br/>

 <br/>
Both seem punitive.<br/>
A quesadilla isn&#39;t all that much better for a person than a  cookie.<br/>
To make him smell food and wait (especially if he&#39;s very young) is  cruel.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s my opinion.  If the purpose of food is nurture and energy,  figuring <br/>
out how to get everyone some food is primary.  If the purpose of  food is <br/>
training, I have no interest in helping someone find a training-style  answer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316222340">I just wanted to clarify that I started the original post as if it <br/>
was a question for my friend.  I was attempting to joke around a <br/>
little, but realize now that the words were ineffective (i.e. bad <br/>
joke.) I wanted to make it clear that this question is entirely mine <br/>
and not of any friend.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to say here what I ended up doing at the Una Mas and what <br/>
happened later on in the day.<br/>
<br/>
I _did_ get the cookie for him and I _didn&#39;t_ make <br/>
him eat anything he didn&#39;t want to.  We got the cookie after we ate <br/>
because he wasn&#39;t hungry at the time and was intersted in explaining <br/>
a science experiment to me. My daughter and I, on the other hand, <br/>
were hungry so we just happened to eat first before getting him a <br/>
cookie.  He didn&#39;t care one way or the other, so there was no issue <br/>
of punishment or anything.<br/>
<br/>
But the story is not finished.  Later, my son has a major blood <br/>
sugar dip and was very emotional and combative because he had only <br/>
eaten a slice of bread and a cookie the entire day.  Similar <br/>
scenarios of this sort have happened many times.  I allow the <br/>
children to eat anything anytime, but they tend to break down later <br/>
when they have not had sufficient calories and/or protein to carry <br/>
them through.  Food is available to them, but they choose not to eat <br/>
until it is too late and they are crying and yelling.  So, I am <br/>
interested in knowing what suggestions people might have for <br/>
handling this pattern and helping my children through this bit of a <br/>
stickler.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127846540">Milk shakes, ice cream and pizza have saved us and cranky kids many  times.<br/>
 <br/>
I have carried water, string cheese, fruit roll-ups and nuts lots of times  <br/>
(after the kids outgrew the cheerios and fruit juice stage, when I carried <br/>
those  along all the time).<br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes if it&#39;s been a while, a tuna and egg salad sandwich will really  <br/>
hit the spot, and it&#39;s pretty easy to carry along, too, and cheap enough that if <br/>
 it ends up being fed to the cat or dog it&#39;s no big loss.<br/>
 <br/>
When we camped, I&#39;d take jerkey and some little cheese and sausage balls  for <br/>
kids to snack on if they were feeling protein deprived and a meal wasn&#39;t  <br/>
imminent.  At home it&#39;s easy for them to get something out of the freezer  and <br/>
microwave it, but with camping they have to wait for meals more than they&#39;re  <br/>
used to.    Those cheese ball things (I&#39;ve never settled on a  good name for <br/>
them &lt;g&gt;) can be made lots of ways, and don&#39;t go bad in a  day of being out. <br/>
Someone asked me for that recipe just a couple of weeks  ago and I had to look too <br/>
hard so I put it here<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/sausageballs/_">http://www.sandradodd.com/sausageballs/_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sandradodd.com/sausageballs/)">http://www.sandradodd.com/sausageballs/)</a> <br/>
 I called it sausage balls, but they can be made without the sausage.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117272724">Thanks for the food ideas.  My problem is more that the food is there, <br/>
but does not get eaten, especially when my son is playing video <br/>
games.  Oops.  I just answered my own question.  I know what you all <br/>
will say.  Put the food in front of him as he plays.  I haven&#39;t done <br/>
this yet and will definitely try it.  My own food habits follow a <br/>
similar pattern and I don&#39;t get the signal that I&#39;m hungry so I don&#39;t <br/>
eat until it&#39;s too late and I have a headache and am cranky.   <br/>
Thinking about food in advance is trying to say the least...heavy <br/>
sigh. I guess there is no help there.  If only I were rich, I would <br/>
have a personal chef to set food in front of my family and I. :)<br/>
<br/>
I was sort of hoping that the kids would get those old internal <br/>
signals going and would make good food choices based on how the food <br/>
makes them feel after eating it.  I&#39;m wondering what other&#39;s opinion <br/>
is on this.  Is this similiar to what people mistakenly think about <br/>
unschooling?  All children will read Shakespear and love Calculus to <br/>
boot left to learn on their own?  Obviously, not every person is going <br/>
to like Shakespear and not every person is going to like salad.  I <br/>
don&#39;t have any expectation that my kids will love salad at any time in <br/>
their lives, but are my expectations too high to expect that they <br/>
should gravitate to a variaty of food that supplies an adequate amount <br/>
of nutrition?  Obviously, my lack of trust is showing in that last <br/>
sentence.  I am interested in other folks opinions/experiences with <br/>
this.<br/>

Just ignore the last bit of my reply then. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But the story is not finished.  Later, my son has a major blood <br/>

handling this pattern and helping my children through this bit of a <br/>
stickler.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This kind of thing has happened with Jayn (5.5) at times when we are out,<br/>
with either unrealized by her hunger or tiredness, and I usually have a good<br/>
idea which it is. I have said to her &quot;your behavior is telling me that you<br/>
are probably hungry&quot;. I almost always have the food bag with us, or at least<br/>
in the car, with an assortment of snacks and drinks.<br/>
<br/>
If the needy behavior is having an impact on other children at a playdate, I<br/>
have in the past actually picked her up and carried her to a private place<br/>
with the food. She usually will eat when the yummy thing is right in front<br/>
of her, and it only takes a bite or two to restore her calm. She will then<br/>
rationally and calmly tell me about how bad she was feeling.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn is like this any appeals to logic are futile. The only thing that<br/>
helps her feel better is to put liked food right there. So far it has not<br/>
happened that she has refused to then eat.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Food is available to them&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Other than when you are out, what does this mean at your house?<br/>
<br/>
I bring Jayn a sandwich and a sliced up piece of fruit to where she is if it<br/>
seems like it has been a long time, and she is very engaged in something.<br/>
Other people talk about things like &quot;monkey platters&quot; of finger foods that<br/>
are right there on the table, or dishes at child&#39;s eye level in the fridge<br/>
that require neither preparation time nor adult assistance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916661124">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Since he hadn&#39;t eaten since breakfast,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That would be irrelevant to me in terms of menu choice in a similar<br/>
situation, but might make me more willing to put his need before mine and<br/>
anyone else&#39;s in my party who had eaten recently and was less hungry.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; should she insist/gently <br/>
persuade/shove down his troat a quesadilla?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well I would never do so, once Jayn had expressed her disinterest in it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Or, should she say, &quot;I&#39;d <br/>
love to get you a cookie as soon as your sister and I are done with <br/>
our meal here at the Una Mas.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My answer to this might depend on the ages of the children. For example<br/>
could the sister be left in the restaurant for a moment while Mom and son<br/>
went across the courtyard to get the cookie? A very much younger child would<br/>
have a harder time waiting for his cookie than an older one.<br/>
<br/>
The principle behind it of procuring the food that was the child&#39;s choice -<br/>
I always get Jayn what she wants to eat if it is gettable. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I am, I mean, she is interested in knowing your thoughts. ;)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
The wink prompts me to ask is this friend really you? If so it&#39;s better to<br/>
be upfront and honest with us.<br/>

Provide food without making him choose it first.  My son has a  terrible time <br/>
deciding what to eat and when he was 4 or 5 it was horrible, with  some of <br/>
the same consequences.  I offered him bites of what I had at odd  times (ham <br/>
sandwich or whatever) and he would usually take one.  As he got  older and could <br/>
see the pattern I could have a conversation about it with  him.  We called the <br/>
reaction the &quot;hungry uglies&quot;.  So, on the mornings  he asked me to run out <br/>
and get donuts (a major cause of the hungry uglies for  him), I&#39;d ask, &quot;how are <br/>
we going to prevent the hungry uglies?&quot; and he&#39;d have an  idea...maybe a piece <br/>
of cheese first or he could eat again at 10:00 or get a  piece of sausage <br/>
with his donut.  <br/>
 <br/>
One thing I absolutely counted on to prevent that behavior was me fixing  <br/>
something to eat and nibbling on it myself.  I wouldn&#39;t say, &quot;I&#39;m slicing  up an <br/>
apple, want some?&quot;  I&#39;d just go in and slice up the apple and go plop  down <br/>
beside him and eat it.  For Will, it&#39;s the change from doing what he&#39;s  doing to <br/>
deciding what to eat that seems to be the problem.  He doesn&#39;t  want to have <br/>
to think about food--he just wants it in front of him.  At  restaurants, he <br/>
needs lots of time to look at the menu, even if he&#39;s just  getting the same <br/>
thing he always gets.  When I cook, instead of putting  salad on his plate, I save <br/>
out half the cucumber and slice it up and put on his  plate.  I cut up a <br/>
little steak for his plate.  I only put things on  his plate that I know he has <br/>
eaten and liked in the past.  At 11, I can ask  him if he&#39;s hungry and he&#39;ll say <br/>
&quot;I had a bowl of cereal&quot; or &quot;YEAH!&quot;  He no  longer says, &quot;what are you <br/>
making?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a progression.  He knows he has to eat.  When he was younger  he didn&#39;t <br/>
recognize those symptoms of hunger in time.  We didn&#39;t put  pressure on him to <br/>
try new things (he learned about trying new things from Blues  Clues when he <br/>
was 3--his palate is way more adventurous than mine).  We  don&#39;t make him eat <br/>
anything he doesn&#39;t want, even if he asked for it.  It  was hard at first, <br/>
because I&#39;m a waste not/want not type of person.  <br/>
 <br/>
Now he wakes up and asks me to take him to the local diner for their  <br/>
farmer&#39;s breakfast, pancakes, eggs, sausage gravy and biscuits, bacon,  etc.  He eats <br/>
much more than he used to, and he can fix himself something  if I&#39;m not <br/>
thinking about it.  If I ask him if he wants a grilled cheese,  he usually says <br/>
yes.  I still surprise him with food in his room and he  sometimes doesn&#39;t know <br/>
he&#39;s hungry until he sees it.  But the hungry uglies  are a thing of the past.  <br/>
He thinks about how much sugar he&#39;s had himself,  and makes adjustments.<br/>
 <br/>
The learning curve wasn&#39;t all that steep.<br/>

&gt;of punishment or anything.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fwiw, although it&#39;s already been said, I agree that I would&#39;ve gotten <br/>
the cookie first if he had expressed that as we were deciding where to <br/>
eat. I couldn&#39;t ascertain whether this was a food court situation or a <br/>
sit down, waitress type situation. The beauty of food courts is that <br/>
*everyone* should be able to find something to enjoy. A sit down <br/>
restaurant is slightly different, and if I&#39;d known about the cookie in <br/>
advance, then the cookie would&#39;ve been the first on our agenda. If I <br/>
were sitting down with my three young kids and we were already in the <br/>
middle of eating when the cookie came up, I would tell my son that we&#39;d <br/>
stop first thing after I&#39;d paid the check here. I wouldn&#39;t be able to <br/>
run get it while I left them at the table, and none of them is old <br/>
enough to head over on their own, so I would feel kinda stuck. I&#39;d also <br/>
try to see if there were any cookies or something available where we <br/>
were that he might like to have instead or at least in the mean time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But the story is not finished.  Later, my son has a major blood <br/>
&gt;sugar dip and was very emotional and combative because he had only <br/>
&gt;eaten a slice of bread and a cookie the entire day.  Similar <br/>
&gt;scenarios of this sort have happened many times.  I allow the <br/>
&gt;children to eat anything anytime, but they tend to break down later <br/>
&gt;when they have not had sufficient calories and/or protein to carry <br/>
&gt;them through.  Food is available to them, but they choose not to eat <br/>
&gt;until it is too late and they are crying and yelling.  So, I am <br/>
&gt;interested in knowing what suggestions people might have for <br/>
&gt;handling this pattern and helping my children through this bit of a <br/>
&gt;stickler.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have a son who is *very* much like this, but he also knows he&#39;s like <br/>
this because we&#39;ve had lots of conversations about it. *I&#39;m* also very <br/>
much like this, so he gets it from me, and I&#39;m able to model good <br/>
choices for him, so it&#39;s not always about *him.*  Because of this, he&#39;s <br/>
very used to the, &quot;Sure! What can I get you with the cookie that will <br/>
help your body feel full and keep your blood sugar even?&quot; He gets this <br/>
rather often because he&#39;ll ask for a cookie or ice cream first thing in <br/>
the morning when he wakes up, an especially important time of the day <br/>
for him to have protein of some sort. He&#39;s fine with the response <br/>
because he&#39;s always gotten the cookie in addition to the food and <br/>
usually first while I&#39;m preparing whatever else he&#39;s going to eat. So, I <br/>
would&#39;ve launched into that same pattern with Sam in the situation you <br/>
describe. I would&#39;ve said &quot;Sure! Do you see anything else here that I <br/>
can get you to eat with your cookie so your blood sugar doesn&#39;t drop?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how old your children are. My Sam is 5, so I&#39;m still <br/>
extremely involved in helping him get meals, which offers lots of <br/>
opportunities for conversation. I&#39;ve been setting up the solution to <br/>
this dilemma for quite a while now, so the important groundwork is <br/>
already laid.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062288908">As Danielle said, information, information, information, over time, <br/>
will have an effect. My DS is just turned 7 and we noted the blood <br/>
sugar/protein lack situation probably 3 or 4 years ago. If I notice <br/>
he&#39;s starting to get on the edgy side, I may offer to make him <br/>
something, I may just get out some foods and put them by him. Also, <br/>
since I get grumpy without food too, I might say &quot;hey I&#39;m starting <br/>
to feel a little hungry. Think I&#39;ll get (whatever). Want some?&quot; <br/>
(okay so not typically in verbose complete paragraphs - generally, <br/>
it&#39;s more part and parcel of the flow of talk throughout the day). <br/>
He requested we keep a list of protein foods on the chalkboard in <br/>
the kitchen for his easy reference - sometimes he just can&#39;t think <br/>
of anything and seeing it there takes some of the pressure off him. <br/>
Sometimes seeing it acts as a reminder &quot;oh yeah I think I&#39;ll have <br/>
some of that&quot;. And, when we&#39;re out, there&#39;s always some way to get <br/>
food quick - whether it&#39;s a snack bag in the car, spare cash for a <br/>
quick run to a minimart or whatever, some way to get needed food in <br/>
pretty quickly. We&#39;ve found that string cheese (and now they <br/>
have &#39;swirl&#39; string cheese that has cheddar swirled in) and even <br/>
plain cheese cut with mini cookie cutters into shapes travel pretty <br/>
well for a day - oh and baby bel cheeses too (bonus is that DS likes <br/>
to play with the wax off the baby bel cheese - food and toy in one!<br/>
lol). Over time, DS has gotten more able to notice when he&#39;s needing <br/>
a refill - if he&#39;s being a car, he needs more &quot;fuel&quot; at <br/>
the &quot;pitstop&quot;. We&#39;ve also done things like bring him a snack and <br/>
remind him that a Jedi (or whatever character he was being) needed <br/>
to keep his energy up, so we brought him ...(and we make up some <br/>
odd, in-character name for whatever it is - &#39;Naboo fish balls&#39; or <br/>
whatever).</div>

 <br/>
I like this, and it makes sense to me, and I wish everyone just knew it  <br/>
calmly in their insides.<br/>
 <br/>
I cringe when people say &quot;I asked him if he wanted to eat and he said  no.&quot;  <br/>
Put some food where he can reach it, and bypass the chit-chat and  <br/>
negotiations.  LOTS of times people (adults included) say &quot;no&quot; about food  because they <br/>
can&#39;t slow their minds enough to think about what they would want  to eat, or <br/>
they don&#39;t want to stop what they&#39;re doing and risk it being a LONG  food break <br/>
with distracting conversation while they&#39;re trying to  concentrate.  I do <br/>
that with writing sometimes.  If Keith asks me if  I want breakfast, I say no <br/>
rather than break my train of thought.  If he  puts food in reach, I eat it and <br/>
everything&#39;s better.  <br/>
 <br/>
I do that for my kids.  Yesterday they were each involved in a video  game <br/>
for a long time (not all at once, different times and places).  I  made <br/>
sandwiches and delivered them where they were and each kid was happily  relieved and <br/>
only had to interact with me about this long:   &quot;Thanks!  cool.&quot;  No longer.  <br/>
They didn&#39;t have to pause or tell  their teammates they&#39;d be back (these were <br/>
Halo2 and World of Warcraft  situations.)   <br/>
 <br/>
I also had times of warm conversation with each of them yesterday (Holly  <br/>
several times because she&#39;s been gone and keeps coming to hang out with me and  <br/>
tell me stories).  Both Kirby and Marty sought me out just to talk  sometime <br/>
during the day.   It was a good day.  <br/>
 <br/>
The worst thing would&#39;ve been one of them really didn&#39;t want a sandwich,  but <br/>
we have a dog and three cats, so it wouldn&#39;t have been really  horrible.  <br/>

&gt;can get you to eat with your cookie so your blood sugar doesn&#39;t drop?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These types of conversations go on all the time.  And, I am often <br/>
talking about the importance of different types of foods.  I have a <br/>
fairly restricted diet myself due to a food allergy, so my kids see <br/>
that effect of good food and bad food on me all the time. In that way <br/>
I am a role model (notice, I didn&#39;t say &#39;good&#39; role model). I just <br/>
want to note here that I do not force my food restrictions on them in <br/>
anyway.  I do have to pay very close attention though that they are <br/>
not exhibiting the same food reactions as I have.  Allergies build <br/>
over time.  So, while they do not seem allergic at this point, that <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily mean they won&#39;t become allergic in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I say something similar as you quote above, my son and my <br/>
daughter for that matter will not necessarily choose something else to <br/>
eat.  This is when the pattern begins.  They are happy with a cookie.  <br/>
They do not get hungry later on and they do not eat anything else <br/>
later on, then their blood sugar drops.  So I am compelled to remind <br/>
them to eat something.  And, I&#39;m compelled to remind them to eat <br/>
something good in the first place.  I am trying not to follow through <br/>
on these urges, however.  As in the case with the cookie, I went ahead <br/>
and bought the cookie for him as he wished.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to find the balance between my concerns for their <br/>
nutrition and my concern for their autonomy.  Ultimately, I want them <br/>
to become fully autonomous in there food choices and for them to do is <br/>
successfully without these dips.  They and I have not arrived yet, <br/>
that&#39;s why I&#39;m posing the question to the group.<br/>

<br/>
Thinking  about food in advance is trying to say the least...heavy <br/>
sigh. I guess  there is no help there.  If only I were rich, I would <br/>
have a personal  chef to set food in front of my family and I. :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t do it yourself, it&#39;s extra unfair to be cranky that your kids  <br/>
haven&#39;t developed that awareness of what their body needs.  But the good  news <br/>
is, they&#39;ll probably learn it more easily than you have because they  started <br/>
earlier!<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I was sort of hoping that the kids would get those old internal  <br/>
signals going and would make good food choices based on how the food  <br/>
makes them feel after eating it.  I&#39;m wondering what other&#39;s opinion  <br/>
is on this.  Is this similiar to what people mistakenly think about  <br/>
unschooling? -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Well...<br/>
That makes it sound like you&#39;ve already decided it&#39;s a mistaken idea, and  <br/>
false.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids do have good awareness of what they need to eat.   That  doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
they love salad or eat &quot;enough fruit&quot; (by the charts), but it  absolutely <br/>
DOES mean they don&#39;t live on sweets or starches.  (Kirby eats  more breakfast <br/>
cereal than I think is good, but if I start to rag on him I&#39;m  sure that will <br/>
only be worse than leaving him alone.)  They&#39;re all good  about eating protein <br/>
and drinking water and juice and milk, though they&#39;ll drink  soda too.  They <br/>
don&#39;t crave soda.  They eat it with pizza and things  that &quot;need soda.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
And it&#39;s not just &quot;how the foods make them feel after,&quot; it&#39;s almost a  <br/>
knowledge of needing more roughage or something soothing to the stomach.   Sometimes <br/>
one of them will just want rice or ramen with nothing else.   Filling but <br/>
bland.  <br/>
 <br/>
Marty and Holly have braces.  I forget they&#39;re not supposed to eat  popcorn <br/>
or nuts.  They never, ever forget.  Kids whose parents try to  control what <br/>
they can and can&#39;t eat because they have braces will have kids who  sneak the <br/>
foods thinking they&#39;re &quot;winning&quot; or getting away with something.   I&#39;ve known <br/>
several other (controlled schooled) kids with braces who seemed to  think that as <br/>
long as their parents or the orthodontist didn&#39;t know, it was  okay.  Holly <br/>
and Marty are fully aware of the reasons not to chew sticky  gum or have hard <br/>
food or corn on the cob.  One of  Holly&#39;s favorite  foods is apple, and she <br/>
used to eat them a lot.  She chose to have braces,  though, and now she&#39;ll only <br/>
eat cut-up apple.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- Is this similiar to what people mistakenly think about  <br/>
unschooling?  All children will read Shakespear and love Calculus to  <br/>
boot left to learn on their own?  Obviously, not every person is going  <br/>
to like Shakespear and not every person is going to like salad.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
The idea that Shakespeare is like salad, though, is (I&#39;m thinking maybe) a  <br/>
schoolish idea.  Shakespeare is part of a balanced curriculum.  Salad  is part <br/>
of a balanced modern diet.  <br/>
 <br/>
Some people live and breathe Shakespeare.  That&#39;s not unhealthy.   <br/>
Shakespeare involves history, poetry, costume,  philosophy, theology,  politics, <br/>
language, interpersonal relations, prejudices, slapstick humor,  culture... and <br/>
that&#39;s before even getting to the actual staging, sets, costume,  lighting, music, <br/>
make-up...    <br/>
 <br/>
Salad is just salad.  It doesn&#39;t need to be in the form of a  salad.  There <br/>
are other and better ways to eat green  vegetables than chopped in a bowl with <br/>
too much vinegar, oil and sugar on  top.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-I don&#39;t have any expectation that my kids will love salad at any time in  <br/>
their lives,-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Lots of people go through a season in their lives (or in the year) when  they <br/>
love salad.  It doesn&#39;t mean salad is their favorite  food.    Are their <br/>
cooks here who know of websites specializing  in salad recipes?  There are seafood <br/>
salads and potato and macaroni salads  and chicken salads and all KINDS of <br/>
salads.  <br/>

the kitchen and alert DS that there&#39;s food coming so he can set up a <br/>
table (we have plastic lightweight stack tables in the living room - <br/>

it out to him, sometimes he&#39;ll come get it at a commercial break, <br/>

Good stuff for eating elsewhere: DS is really fond of wraps - any <br/>

instant, easily portable grilled cheese; he&#39;ll even do PBJ wraps; <br/>
cold cuts work fine too; anything spreadable - cream cheese and ham <br/>
wraps are tasty - tuck in a pickle spear when you roll it or mix in <br/>
some dill pickle relish in with the cream cheese for more flavor; <br/>
scrambled eggs and sausage rolled up fresh way better than fast food <br/>
breakfast burritos; you can even make BIG pancakes and use them to <br/>
wrap eggs and sausages. Drop biscuits with shredded cheese and meat <br/>
(ham, ground meat/sausage, etc), veggies (bell pepper etc) are great <br/>
handy bites (a donut place near here calls them &#39;scones&#39; but I&#39;m not <br/>
sure if they fit the definition of a proper scone or not). DH and DS <br/>
can both play certain video and computer games one handed while <br/>
eating a wrap.</div>

If the goal is to keep him on an even keel, why wouldn&#39;t one of the options  <br/>
be to bring the food to the computer?  <br/>

==&gt; I was sort of hoping that the kids would get those old internal <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; signals going and would make good food choices based on how the food <br/>
&gt; makes them feel after eating it. ==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, but they will -- and they&#39;ll make choices based on a lot of other<br/>
factors, too.  As long as they have information *and* freedom *and*<br/>
the support/help as they need it, they will.  The choices they made<br/>
last week may be completely different from the ones they make next<br/>
year.  It&#39;s a learning process -- it doesn&#39;t happen all at once, or<br/>
even in neat little graduated steps.  It happens over time, at their<br/>
own pace.<br/>
<br/>
== My own food habits follow a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; similar pattern and I don&#39;t get the signal that I&#39;m hungry so I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; eat until it&#39;s too late and I have a headache and am cranky.   <br/>
&gt; Thinking about food in advance is trying to say the least...heavy <br/>
&gt; sigh. I guess there is no help there.  If only I were rich, I would <br/>
&gt; have a personal chef to set food in front of my family and I. :)==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So no wonder they&#39;re having the same issue, right?  You and your kids<br/>
are learning together, as in so much of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, and I started to realize that I had some behaviors<br/>
(about waiting to eat) that I was doing habitually, I would probably<br/>
start exploring that and journaling about it, bringing up memories and<br/>
images I associate with the issue -- getting a good look at the<br/>
choices my unconscious is making while I&#39;m not looking, so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
I would also start noting when I do feel enthusiastic about food and<br/>
when I don&#39;t.  When I do, I would use that energy to make some good, <br/>
nurturing food and snacks ahead of time.  Banana nut bread, apple<br/>
cheddar nut bread, whole wheat pancakes, frozen smoothie popsicles, a<br/>
batch of trail mix, a whole-wheat pasta dish that will keep or freeze,<br/>
a big salad ... even just cutting up cheese and lunchmeat and veggies<br/>
for finger snacks over the next few days.  Stuff that you like and<br/>
stuff that your kids like.  Focus on finger foods, since it sounds<br/>
like your kids (and maybe you) need to be able to eat while you&#39;re<br/>
doing the things that interest you.<br/>
<br/>
Then, as you head into the times that you don&#39;t feel so energetic<br/>
about food, you have stuff made ahead that you can feel good about and<br/>
can easily pull out.  To bring to your children while they&#39;re watching<br/>
TV.  To bring with you on outings.  And so on. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
== are my expectations too high to expect that they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; should gravitate to a variaty of food that supplies an adequate amount <br/>
&gt; of nutrition? ==<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t get in your head and see what exactly your expectations are<br/>
when it comes to words like gravitate and variety and adequate and<br/>
nutrition.  My kids gravitate to a variety of adequately nutrional<br/>
foods, by my definition, but they still have ice cream or otter pops<br/>
for breakfast sometimes. &lt;G&gt;  And they still will go through phases<br/>
where they eat mostly one food or one type of food for days at a time.<br/>
<br/>
I think you will answer your own question as you take a breath and<br/>
honestly explore your own expectations.  Remember that &quot;nutrition&quot;<br/>
balances out over a few days.  Remember that they need information<br/>
(not nagging) given in a helpful, supportive, &quot;let&#39;s try it and see&quot;<br/>
environment.  Remember that your expectations may be (are probably)<br/>
colored by your own issues.<br/>
<br/>
A pretty good book that might help you explore these issues is<br/>
_Preventing Childhood Eating Problems_ by Jane R. Hirschmann.  It&#39;s a<br/>
little mainstream on things like weaning (or at one point she mentions<br/>
the difficulty of living with teenagers -- definitely not<br/>
unschooling), but it contains references to the scientific data that<br/>
supports &quot;self-demand feeding,&quot; as she calls it.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The peanut butter thing triggered another thought - pack a snack <br/>
with you - string cheese, a plastic wrapped peanut butter cookie, <br/>
some trail mix, etc - they take little space, time, effort, money <br/>
and pay off in a big way in the long run. That way, as you are on <br/>
line (at Starbucks or Una Mas), you can grab one and say &quot;until we <br/>
get the ordering done, how about this to tide you over?&quot; Not as a <br/>
substitute but simply acknowledging that buying food often entails <br/>
lines and you want to accommodate things as quickly as possible <br/>
while waiting for their main goal.<br/>
<br/>
The reason the pb mention got this thought going is that we make <br/>
peanut butter, banana, honey, oatmeal, raisin, chocolate chip <br/>
cookies where the banana and honey subs for the sugars and where fat <br/>
free plain (or vanilla) yogurt subs for the butter/shortning. They <br/>
come out more like ball shaped muffins and they are quite sturdy for <br/>
travel snacks. Great for eating on the move and contains protein, <br/>
fruit, dairy, and complex carbs and *chocolate*&lt;grin&gt;. Sometimes we <br/>
also use other dried fruits like cranberries or cherries; sometimes <br/>
we put in peanuts or other chopped nuts; sometimes we use mini M&Ms <br/>
for color. Whatever&#39;s handy.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-958613309">My daughter eats maybe 15 different things. 90% of them are very good <br/>
for her (raw carrots, garbanzo beans, yoghurt, etc )but are very <br/>
specific;, like Aunt Millies 7 Grain Indian Bread and natural peanut <br/>
Butter from a particular grocery store, 2% milk from a particular <br/>
grocery.... The ONLY food outside of the house she will eat, is <br/>
Wendy&#39;s chicken Nuggets - it&#39;s also the only meat she eats (she hasn&#39;t <br/>
actually figured it out yet - she&#39;s convinced they&#39;re made from mean <br/>
and evil roosters so she assures herself that it&#39;s a good thing). Of <br/>
course she&#39;ll eat cookies and ice cream too - but ironically she won&#39;t <br/>
touch chips, crackers or most prepared snack foods from a convenience <br/>
store...and frankly when we are away from home there are days when <br/>
that is all she has available beccause there is no Wendys or Aunt <br/>
Millies Indian bread, or whatever. So, she gets cookies and apple <br/>
juice if thats what is available. <br/>
<br/>
The most important thing my 6 year old daughter has learned, is that <br/>
she WILL feel like crap when thats all she eats. So at this very young <br/>
age, she packs a lunch when ever we leave the house for any length of <br/>
time...PB sandwiches, carrots , apples, string cheese, water....<br/>
<br/>
People used to think I was crazy when I&#39;d allow her the cookie or ice <br/>
cream just like in your friends situation...but in the short run (I <br/>
can&#39;t say &quot;long&quot; run because the child is so young!) it has paid off <br/>
in that she is extremely aware of her own nutritional needs. She paces <br/>
herself very well and knows when she needs to fuel up on what she <br/>
considers &quot;good food&quot;. <br/>
