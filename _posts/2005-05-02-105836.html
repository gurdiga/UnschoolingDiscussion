<div id="ygrps-yiv-1456735268">Sarah likes the Prismacolor pencils, and I do think<br/>
they are worth the money. She takes better care of<br/>
them than she did the cheap RoseArt ones.<br/>

they can be a pretty penny, epically the larger sets.<br/>
dickblick.com has real good prices on Prismacolor Pencils.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556031780">Prismacolor for sure!  We have bought the big set (I can&#39;t remember how<br/>
many, maybe 80 or 100 colors) and just love it.  It was definitely worth the<br/>
money for my dd who draws every day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271461409">Nothing beats Prismacolor, amazing smooth pure pigment pencils, you can even get them woodless, just sticks of pure pigment.  If you are looking for something cheaper, crayola really are pretty good quality.  Roseart just plain sucks.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341436544">Prismacolor pencils are my favorite.  For discounted prices, try<br/>
www.viking.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.viking.com/">http://www.viking.com/</a>&gt;  - put the coupon DZ4-PRD20 in<br/>

warehouse in your area you may get it in a day or two, not much longer<br/>

lower price.<br/>
 <br/>
There are a few special offers that sometimes work, too - they get added<br/>

end.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1476633050">Dylan likes Conte pastel pencils in his field bag, for quick sketches of<br/>
birds, etc.  They&#39;re a little larger diameter pencil but he feels they<br/>
give him better definition on fine markings. <br/>
<br/>
He has a set of Prismacolor and uses them more than the others he says,<br/>
but he has a broader range of colors in those. But he&#39;s not happy about<br/>
losing color over time.  They claim to be light fast but he feels they<br/>
aren&#39;t as good as Derwent. <br/>
<br/>
He says Derwent is a good pencil for soft lines and blending.   And get a<br/>
blending pencil, he says, it will make you feel like Rembrandt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you live near a university visit their art store.  We can usually get<br/>
a better assortment of several different brands for less than we can buy<br/>
sets at other art supply stores. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285124260">Prangs are also nice and not quite as expensive.  However, you can sometimes get a coupon for JoAnn Fabrics for 50% off anything and everything in the store.  That&#39;s the time to get Prismacolors, or you can order them on ebay.  I got my first 120-colors box for $72 with shipping and my second 96-color box from Hobby Lobby (half price Prismacolor sale) for something like $65.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!  We love ours!<br/>
