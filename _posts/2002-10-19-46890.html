&lt;&lt;  Jews and Christians share the same scriptures: the <br/>
Old Testament, as Rachel Ann mentioned, was passed intact from Jews <br/>
to Christians.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Intact&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
The Torah is only the first five books of the Protestant Old Testament.  <br/>
Catholics have extra books which Protestants decided to dump at some point.  <br/>
When was it &quot;intact&quot;?  Is there a Hebrew word or concept for that set of <br/>
writings which Christians call &quot;The Old Testament&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
And Jews have commentary along with the scriptures.  Do we inherit the <br/>
commentary too?  And if so, just commentary up to 2,000 years ago or even <br/>
newer?<br/>

tells which books belong in the Hebrew Scriptures and the Old <br/>
Testament.  Near the end of the web page, a summary sentence <br/>
indicates that Protestant Christians use the Jewish scripture intact:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the 1600s, some Protestant Christians began to use only the <br/>
Jewish list of Old Testament books, while the Roman Catholic and <br/>
Eastern Orthodox Christians continued to use some or all of the <br/>
Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical books as well.&quot;<br/>

indicates that Jews and Christians regard their scriptures <br/>
differently.  In fact, it seems to indicate that Jews regard their <br/>
commentary as authorative as they do their scriptures, which <br/>
Christians do not (generalizing here for simplicity).<br/>
<br/>
The whole web site warns against simplistic comparisons of the <br/>
Christian OT and the Jewish scripture, which I guess was your point.  <br/>
So I learned something new from this research.  Here are the first <br/>
and last paragraphs:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;STILL MORE fundamental is the partiality of vision that allows the <br/>
statement&#39;s authors to declare that both faiths &quot;seek authority from <br/>
the same book,&quot; known to Jews as the &quot;Tanakh&quot; (a Hebrew acronym for <br/>
the three sections of the Jewish Bible) and to Christians as the &quot;Old <br/>
Testament.&quot; This awkward gloss on how the two traditions refer to <br/>
the &quot;same book&quot; already points to the problem. Christians do not <br/>
refer to the Old Testament alone as the Bible, and Jews, for their <br/>
part, do not consider the New Testament to be biblical in any way.&quot;<br/>
........<br/>
&quot;In their paragraph about the Bible, the authors of Dabru Emet also <br/>
passed up an opportunity to correct one of the most common Christian <br/>
misconceptions about Judaism--namely, that the Bible is its sole <br/>
authority. They could have done so by pointing to the centrality of <br/>
the oral Torah, that is, the Mishnah and subsequent rabbinic <br/>
teaching. Did they refrain out of the (perhaps unconscious) <br/>
recognition that this would have profoundly undermined their <br/>
simplistic claim that the two communities appeal to &quot;the same book&quot;?&quot;<br/>
