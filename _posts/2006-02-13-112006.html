<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765417532">Hey everyone,<br/>
   <br/>
  I just wanted to let people know that Diana&#39;s (hahamommy) daughter, Hannah, was just diagnosed with ALL, a leukemia.   Hannah had some nose bleeds in the last few weeks, was feeling very weak, bruising easy,  and running a temp.  They were up here visiting me and we brought her in and they just thought it was a ear infection.  She went on some antibiotics and seemed a bit better.   After they got home, about a week ago, she was feeling really weak still, so they took her in and did some tests and got the diagnosis.<br/>
   <br/>
  They would like to do chemo on her,  starting tomorrow,  and Diana is just trying to take it all in right now.   <br/>
   <br/>
  For those of you who don&#39;t know Diana,  she is a single parent unschooling her 2 children.  She lost Mitch, her husband and father to Hannah and Hayden,  5 years ago to brain cancer.   I&#39;m about 6 hours away from her now, but will try and get down to her as soon as I can.<br/>
   <br/>
  She wanted me to let you all know so you can keep her and her family in your thoughts.  <br/>
   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kelli, thanks so much for letting us know so we can keep them in our <br/>
thoughts. HaHaMommy was one of the people I bonded with so deeply at the <br/>
first Live and Learn, and I adore her family! I even got a chance to <br/>
meet her mom at the last Live and Learn, and she insisted on mothering <br/>
me and trying to keep me warm at the freezing Margaritaville!<br/>
<br/>
I emailed Diana privately, but I forgot to mention this website that <br/>
makes coordinating help (even far away help, I would think) really easy: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sgk.lotsahelpinghands.com/">http://sgk.lotsahelpinghands.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Check it out and let her know about it next time you talk to her; maybe <br/>
someone close (not necessarily proximity) to Diana could volunteer to do <br/>
the coordinating information through this site? I know I&#39;d be very <br/>
interested in hearing updates, knowing when I could light candles and <br/>
keep them in my thoughts, and knowing where I might be able to buy <br/>
take-out or grocery-store gift certificates or something that could ease <br/>
their minds at least a bit.<br/>
<br/>
I thought I&#39;d go ahead and post about it here in case anyone else might <br/>
find this resource useful--I&#39;d never heard about it until a gal over at <br/>
the AU list was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and her friends <br/>
organized help through this website.<br/>

  She is amazing.  I just talked to her and she is doing really well.  Hannah also seems to be doing well.  They will be starting chemo tomorrow and there&#39;s a really good prognosis for the leukemia.  Like a 90% cure rate.  Yayy!<br/>

  I&#39;m passing on everyone&#39;s well wishes and she said she was gonna try and get online soon.  Has a laptop that she got to borrow from a friend.  Another Yayy.<br/>

And if any of you aren&#39;t sure which person you&#39;ve met is Hannah, or  <br/>

there are photos of Hannah, her mom, her brother, and probably a kid  <br/>

Part of the reason I wanted a blog address is that we can&#39;t turn the  <br/>
list over to discussions of individuals or side issues, but lots of  <br/>
people here know Diana, Hannah and Hayden from conferences or lists.<br/>
<br/>
When I was talking with Holly and Keith earlier this evening about  <br/>
Hannah&#39;s condition, I mentioned to Keith how much worse it would be  <br/>
if Hannah were in school.  Keith understaood immediately; Holly  <br/>
didn&#39;t at all, and asked.  We talked a little about the problems of  <br/>
chemo therapy or any major medical treatment and school, and of the  <br/>
possibility of losing hair or being weak or nauseous at school, and  <br/>
how much better to be home.  I didn&#39;t even begin to touch on missing  <br/>
school or getting behind and all that.   That was our &quot;how wonderful  <br/>
they&#39;re unschooling&quot; tie-in for today.<br/>
