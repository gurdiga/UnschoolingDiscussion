<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387693307">This looks long because I painstakingly wrote out everything - didn&#39;t leave <br/>
any gaps. So you have to read each line - don&#39;t skim. Please try it - I <br/>
really would appreciate it MOST if some of you who don&#39;t think they <br/>
understand why a negative times a negative is a positive would give this <br/>
example a real go. I made it up and I want to know if it helps people &quot;get <br/>
it.&quot; I&#39;m not claiming you can &quot;get it&quot; without an effort - I&#39;m asking you to <br/>
do me the favor of making an effort - I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find it terribly <br/>
painful, the whole point is that I think this is a pretty clear example, <br/>
bettter than others I&#39;ve come across or made up myself. (I HOPE I don&#39;t have <br/>
any typos - that would be really discouraging - I&#39;ve proofread - but if <br/>
someone catches one, please let me know FAST so I can fix quickly.)<br/>
<br/>
If you have kids who are at the right stage to maybe try to follow this, that <br/>
would be GREAT too, if they&#39;d &quot;review it&quot; for me either by reading it <br/>
themselves or by you presenting the examples to them.<br/>

Question: Why do you get a positive answer when you multiply a negative <br/>
number times a negative number?<br/>
<br/>
Answer:<br/>
The reason positive and negative multiplying and dividing are so hard to <br/>
intuitively grasp is that we have to give SOME meaning to the ideas of <br/>
positive and negative for them to make sense. You don&#39;t usually have to <br/>
consciously do this for just positives because you do it automatically in <br/>
your head. If I ask you, &quot;What is 2 times 30?&quot; You can say it is 60. You <br/>
don&#39;t have to THINK about what the positives mean -- you don&#39;t stop and think <br/>
about it as +2 times +30 equals +60, because you are comfortable with <br/>
positive numbers meaning - it could mean that you received two payments of 30 <br/>
dollars each so you got 60 dollars or  they could mean things like a car <br/>
drives 2 hours at 30 miles an hour so it has gone 60 miles. These are <br/>
meanings that just make sense - you very likely had some experience with such <br/>
meanings before you ever learned to multiply. You KNEW that if 3 people gave <br/>
you 2 cookies each that you&#39;d end up with 6 cookies, probably before you <br/>
learned to multiply. So you had some &quot;hooks&quot; to use when you learned to <br/>
multiply positive numbers together. Not so with negative numbers - you very <br/>
possibly didn&#39;t have any automatic hooks for those.<br/>
<br/>
When you work, in REAL life, with positive AND negative numbers, the meanings <br/>
will be clear. But when you&#39;re just doing pure &quot;math&quot; problems, there is a <br/>
tendency to try to do it without any context - with no meaning attached - and <br/>
that is too hard, at first. You can do it later, when you&#39;re CONVINCED <br/>
already that there are ways for it to mean something real.<br/>
<br/>
So - you have to give meaning to positive and negative.<br/>
<br/>
For example - imagine a car sitting on a long east/west road. Draw a <br/>
horizontal line on a piece of paper. Put a mark in the middle of the line - <br/>
that&#39;s where you&#39;re standing, watching this car. The east is to your right <br/>
and the west is to your left. You might want to use a toy car for this. Sit <br/>
it on that marked spot in the center of your line.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to multiple two signed numbers. <br/>
<br/>
The sign of the first number indicates which direction the car is facing. If <br/>
it is facing east, we will give the first number a &quot;+&quot; sign and if the car is <br/>
facing west we&#39;ll give the first number a &quot;-&quot; sign. So - the meaning of the <br/>
sign on the first number is whether the car itself is facing east or west.<br/>
<br/>
The value of the first number is going to tell us what the speed of the car <br/>
is when it takes off (we&#39;ll pretend it is at a constant speed - not worry <br/>
about the time it takes to accelerate to that speed). <br/>
<br/>
So if the first number is +30, then it means the car is facing east and that <br/>
its speed is 30 miles per hour. If the first number is -30, it means the car <br/>
is facing west and that its speed is 30 miles per hour.<br/>
<br/>
The sign of the second number indicates whether the car is in drive or in <br/>
reverse. If the sign is positive, it means the car is in &quot;drive&quot; and if the <br/>
sign is negative, it means the car is in &quot;reverse.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The value of the second number is how many hours the car goes (at the speed <br/>
given by the first number). <br/>
<br/>
So if the second number is -2, then it means that the car is in reverse and <br/>
it travels for 2 hours. If the second number is, +2, then the car is in drive <br/>
and it travels for 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose we want to multiply +30 times +2.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;+&quot; in the first number means the car is facing east (to the right). The <br/>
value means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>
<br/>
The + in the second number means the car is in &quot;drive&quot;. And the value of 2 <br/>
means that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - make your toy car face east (to the right). It is in &quot;drive&quot; so when <br/>
it starts moving it is going to also MOVE to the east - the way it is facing. <br/>
And it is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the <br/>
east. <br/>
<br/>
So our answer is going to be +60. The &quot;+&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>
ends up to the east of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how many <br/>
miles from the starting point.<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
Suppose we want to multiply -30 times +2.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;-&quot; in the first number means the car is facing west (to the left). The <br/>
value means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>
<br/>
The + in the second number means the car is in &quot;drive&quot;. And the value of 2 <br/>
means that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - make your toy car face west (to the left). It is in &quot;drive&quot; so when it <br/>
starts moving it is going to also MOVE to the west- the way it is facing. And <br/>
it is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the west. <br/>
<br/>
So our answer is going to be -60. The &quot;-&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>
ends up to the west (left) of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how <br/>
many miles from the starting point.<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
Suppose we want to multiply +30 times -2.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;+&quot; in the first number means the car is facing east (to the right). The <br/>
value means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;-&quot; in the second number means the car&#39;s transmission is in &quot;reverse&quot;. <br/>
And the value of 2 means that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - make your toy car face east (to the right). It is in &quot;reverse&quot; so when <br/>
it starts moving it is going to MOVE the opposite of the way it is facing - <br/>
to the west (left). And it is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end <br/>
up 60 miles to the west. <br/>
<br/>
So our answer is going to be -60. The &quot;-&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>
ends up to the west (left) of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how <br/>
many miles from the starting point.<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
And now the moment you&#39;ve all been waiting for &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose we want to multiply -30 times -2.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;-&quot; in the first number means the car is facing west (to the left). The <br/>
value means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;-&quot; in the second number means the car&#39;s transmission is in &quot;reverse&quot;. <br/>
And the value of 2 means that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - make your toy car face west (to the left). It is in &quot;reverse&quot; so when <br/>
it starts moving it is going to MOVE the opposite of the way it is facing. <br/>
Since it is facing west and it is reverse, it&#39;ll MOVE to the east. And it is <br/>
going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the east. <br/>
<br/>
So our answer is going to be +60. The &quot;+&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>
ends up to the east (right) of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how <br/>
many miles from the starting point.<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
<br/>
So here is ONE example where the signs of the numbers have some meaning and <br/>
so the sign of the answer has a meaning too. There are other similar kinds of <br/>
examples. If you FOOLED with enough of them BEFORE you had to actually learn <br/>
the paper-and-pencil computational skill - then it wouldn&#39;t be that hard - it <br/>
would make sense and slip into place in your brain. It is harder to do it <br/>
after you&#39;ve got it into your head that positives and negatives are <br/>
confusing.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Impossible. Unless you done so much stuff with positives and negatives <br/>
BEFOREHAND, that it just happens that you can think of a meaning for a <br/>
problem. I doubt there are many of us who got that opportunity.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; or <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; constant speed don&#39;t worry about the time<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not understanding. What I meant was that if the car is starting out, if <br/>
it isn&#39;t moving and then is moving, it&#39;ll take a few seconds to get up to 30 <br/>
mph so, in reality it won&#39;t be going 30 mph for the whole 2 hours. It&#39;ll be <br/>
for 2 hours minus a few seconds. So I was saying that we should just ignore <br/>
those few seconds and pretend the car is going the full 30 mph right from the <br/>
get-go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; The sign of the second number indicates whether the car is in drive or in<br/>
&gt; &gt; reverse. If the sign is positive, it means the car is in &quot;drive&quot; and if <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why would the sign for drive or reverse be attached to the hours it <br/>
&gt; travels?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is arbitrary. I could say that it is because they go &quot;in reverse&quot; or &quot;in <br/>
drive&quot; for that many hours. <br/>
<br/>
The sign of the first number is which way the car is facing. Again, you could <br/>
ask why that would be attached to how fast it moves? It is arbitrary. I could <br/>
say that it is how fast it is going while facing in that direction, though.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - I could switch the meanings and it would still make just as much sense. <br/>
For those with the patience - I&#39;ll do it:<br/>
<br/>
********************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - you have to give meaning to positive and negative.<br/>
<br/>
For example - imagine a car sitting on a long east/west road. Draw a <br/>
horizontal line on a piece of paper. Put a mark in the middle of the line - <br/>
that&#39;s where you&#39;re standing, watching this car. The east is to your right <br/>
and the west is to your left. You might want to use a toy car for this. Sit <br/>
it on that marked spot in the center of your line.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to multiple two signed numbers. <br/>
<br/>
The sign of the first number indicates whether the car is in drive or in <br/>
reverse. If the sign is positive, it means the car is in &quot;drive&quot; and if the <br/>
sign is negative, it means the car is in &quot;reverse.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The value of the first number is going to tell us what the speed of the car <br/>
is when it takes off (we&#39;ll pretend it is at a constant speed - not worry <br/>
about the time it takes to accelerate to that speed). <br/>
<br/>
So if the first number is +30, then it means the car is in drive and that <br/>
its speed is 30 miles per hour. If the first number is -30, it means the car <br/>
is in reverse and that its speed is 30 miles per hour.<br/>
<br/>
The sign of the second number indicates which direction the car is facing. If <br/>
<br/>
it is facing east, we will give the second number a &quot;+&quot; sign and if the car <br/>
is <br/>
facing west we&#39;ll give the second number a &quot;-&quot; sign. So - the meaning of the <br/>
sign on the second number is whether the car itself is facing east or west.<br/>
<br/>
The value of the second number is how many hours the car goes (at the speed <br/>
given by the first number). <br/>
<br/>
So if the second number is -2, then it means that the car is facing west and <br/>
it travels for 2 hours. If the second number is, +2, then the car is facing <br/>
east <br/>
and it travels for 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose we want to multiply +30 times +2.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;+&quot; in the first number means the car is in drive. The <br/>
value means that the car is traveling 30 mph.<br/>
<br/>
The + in the second number means the car is facing east. And the value of 2 <br/>
means that it travels for 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - make your toy car face east (to the right). It is in &quot;drive&quot; so when <br/>
it starts moving it is going to also MOVE to the east - the way it is facing. <br/>
<br/>
And it is going to go 30 mph for 2 hours so it will end up 60 miles to the <br/>
east. <br/>
<br/>
So our answer is going to be +60. The &quot;+&quot; in the answer tells us that the car <br/>
<br/>
ends up to the east of its starting point. The value 60 tells us how many <br/>
miles from the starting point.<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
<br/>
and so on --- I switched the meanings of the &quot;signs&quot; of the two numbers -- <br/>
but it still works out sensibly.<br/>

as understandable as:<br/>
<br/>

The implied &quot;will not&quot; after the dash seemed to need to be explicit.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Why would the sign for drive or reverse be attached to the hours it<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, to *me* it makes perfect sense. I can &quot;see&quot; the math from your example<br/>
and why multiplying two negatives makes a positive. Perhaps because I&#39;ve<br/>
done vector math and it reminded me of it?<br/>
<br/>
But it seemed like the type of question that a nonmathie would wonder. The<br/>
direction the car faces seems clearly related to the car. But forward and<br/>
reverse also seem clearly related to the car. But attaching the negative to<br/>
time makes it seem like going back in time. Why would one direction be given<br/>
to the car and the other given to time? Why not both to the car?<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t worry about it. Wait to see if a nonmathie actually does ask the<br/>
question!<br/>
