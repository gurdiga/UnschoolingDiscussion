<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247470425">Eight-year-old ds and his dad spent the whole weekend building a Yoda <br/>
figure from a Lego kit with more than 1,000 pieces. It&#39;s the first big kit or <br/>
model they&#39;ve tried (from the top of Dear Son&#39;s Santa list.) <br/>
<br/>
       It fascinated them. THEY fascinated me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       The kit was too advanced for Son to do solo, rated age 14+  I suppose <br/>
due to the &quot;organization&quot; skills involved to find the right tiny piece and <br/>
then position it in the right tiny place, according to 70-something charted <br/>
steps. <br/>
<br/>
       Once in a while they needed to backtrack to figure out and fix hidden <br/>
missteps (like trying to reconcile my checking account to the bank statement <br/>
without Quicken.) This part was tedious and not forward-progressing, plus at <br/>
any moment some unknown error might prove catastrophic. Not fun!<br/>
<br/>
       Dad took physical charge of the boxes and bags of pieces because he <br/>
said it would be hopeless for both of them otherwise. Son was good at reading <br/>
the charts and he loved snapping in the pieces and watching Yoda take shape row <br/>
by row.  To communicate across the two task areas, they unconsciously coined <br/>
their own private &quot;terms of art&quot; like single double, double triple, and <br/>
L-shaped thingee.<br/>
<br/>
       But I noticed there was no natural &quot;guys building stuff&quot; rhythm to it <br/>
-- any rhythm they had was more like a constant negotiation. If they hadn&#39;t <br/>
each accommodated the other, they couldn&#39;t have worked together at all. I stayed <br/>
nearby but kept my mouth shut and just responded to their various requests -- <br/>
for food, stories, diversions, supplies, and to come admire various stages.<br/>
<br/>
       Son was dancing and bouncing around, telling stories, taking cookie <br/>
breaks, wanting to deny or ignore suspected errors hoping to speed on, etc. He <br/>
went in and out of the room multiple times per hour (but he ALWAYS came back!) <br/>
It was much louder and more frenetic than old people like us prefer for <br/>
project-doing. Hard to concentrate and get right -- I was worried Dad wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
able to tolerate it, and might throw up his hands and tell Son if he wasn&#39;t <br/>
interested enough, to forget it. <br/>
<br/>
       OTOH, Son was patient and reasonably cheerful about Dad&#39;s seemingly <br/>
endless need to check the charts, trace possible errors down, and hoard the <br/>
loose pieces, lining up each step and checking it twice before proceeding.<br/>
<br/>
       Dad was the anchor, or maybe the rudder or navigator, steadying and <br/>
steering and soothing and smoothing the rough spots, enabling Son to do as much <br/>
as he could do happily, without having the rest forced on him as the price for <br/>
his happiness. No ultimatums about taking the nasty with the nice, or not <br/>
being worth doing if it wasn&#39;t done Dad&#39;s way.<br/>
<br/>
       And without ever letting Son see the total cost -- Dad was exhausted <br/>
and bleary-eyed, and thoroughly sick of Yoda and Legos of every kind before it <br/>
was finished. But not sick of Son! <br/>
<br/>
       There was some fine modeling going on, all right.  :)<br/>

       I do write essays and columns here and there (not for HEM) but hadn&#39;t <br/>
thought of using this particularly, so I appreciate the suggestion. :)  JJ<br/>
