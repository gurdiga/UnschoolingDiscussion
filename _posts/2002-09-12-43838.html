&lt;&lt; She&#39;s very active, and I still haven&#39;t found any unschooling ideas <br/>
 for a child that doesn&#39;t want to sit still for more than aminute, she <br/>
 always has to gogogogogo.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling  or homeschooling? Unschooling means following the childs lead, <br/>
not making them do things they don&#39;t enjoy. If she enjoys moving, MOVE. If <br/>
she wants to run and move and play, then that&#39;s what she should do.<br/>
Unschooling is learning the way adults learn...the way they want to, when <br/>
they want to and where they want to. Which is all the time usually, we just <br/>
have to quit trying to hold everything up to the light (or dark actually) of <br/>
school.<br/>
Forget lessons, forget shoulds and have to&#39;s and all that BS.<br/>
Enjoy your child for who she is, right now, today.<br/>
All will be well.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sorry, I wanted to share this wonderful article, and the light just <br/>
 flickered on.  I think I finally understand what unschooling is all <br/>
 about.  I was looking at it as fun teaching, when that&#39;s not all it&#39;s <br/>
 about.  it&#39;s about fun teaching that the CHILDREN choose what they <br/>
 want to learn, based on what they want to do at that given time!!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!! Hurray Maria, that&#39;s it.  Keep on having those shifts in <br/>
thinking...you&#39;re on your way.<br/>
