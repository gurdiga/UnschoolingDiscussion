<div id="ygrps-yiv-528122914">Sandra, I am so glad you brought this subject up!  I feel the same <br/>
way, my kids have nothing to &quot;rebel&quot; against, I actually encourage my <br/>
kids to question things!  Kevin just turned 13 and I get comments all <br/>
the time &quot;Ohhhhh, those teenage years!&quot;.  I always respond with &quot;Well, <br/>
I happen to really LOVE those teenage years and REALLY enjoy my <br/>
teenager, thank you very much.&quot;  I have also over the last couple of <br/>
years been asked quite a few times, &quot;How do you make your <br/>
kids______?&quot;  It can really get me steamed up.  Reading that little <br/>
section that you posted about the rebellious teenager makes me so sad, <br/>
that mom is missing out on so much!!<br/>
