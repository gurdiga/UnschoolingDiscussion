<div id="ygrps-yiv-730304715">I know we where on this subject a week or 3000 emails ago but I tried it and <br/>
I am getting some friction.<br/>
<br/>
I told Dustin he no longer had a bed time and he of  coarse thinks this is <br/>
great!<br/>
My husband after being annoyed that Dustin did not empty the dishwasher told <br/>
him to shut off his light. Now I had gone to Walmart late for diapers and we <br/>
got back at 10:30.  My husband went up stairs around 10:45 and told Dustin to <br/>
shut off his light.  He didn&#39;t tell him to go to sleep or turn the tv off. My <br/>
issue was that Dustin was READING! UGH<br/>
<br/>
My son was reading Dick and Jane in public school a few years ago and I was <br/>
told he will always have issues.<br/>
Now he reads Novels/big books.  The boy is consuming books like no tomorrow a <br/>
site I didn&#39;t think I would ever see. So I told my husband that he really <br/>
needs to be on the same page as the rest of the house. I said ya know I dont <br/>
want to sit here and read pages out of books to you or emails every night to <br/>
show you what&#39;s its all about. I dont want to bore you or anything. I said <br/>
also dont want to ask you to read a book cuz I know you wont. <br/>
<br/>
But Please please follow my lead and watch what I do. I said do you believe <br/>
Unschooling is working, do you believe he is reading more? Well, yes he said. <br/>
I said ok, I am her day and night I have to deal with the kids more than you <br/>
so please allow me to choose the direction we need to do and PLEASE dont come <br/>
home and undo what has positively happened all day.<br/>
<br/>
Then I made the mistake of talking about it in IM with my husbands dad who <br/>
supports our HS now. He went off! He is a child not an adult he needs to be <br/>
in bed period! <br/>
<br/>
I told Dustin no bed time well over a week ago, he is asleep by 11 and up <br/>
between 8/9am.<br/>
What&#39;s the harm?<br/>
I told my husband that if he would have allowed him a second day Dustin would <br/>
have done the dishwasher without being asked.  Six months ago if I had asked <br/>
him if he could take to dog out or grab the laundry basket he would have <br/>
stomped his feet. I stopped asking and now he just does it.  Progress.......<br/>

I have the same trouble but I can see progress. With our oldest son, after<br/>
years of disagreeing about a set bedtime, I have worn my husband down. Son<br/>
one (11 years old)  now turns his light out when he is ready - usually after<br/>
husband and I are asleep. He regulates himself having some really late<br/>
nights and earlier ones other nights and although this does depend a lot on<br/>
how exciting the book is that he is reading, he is also more aware of his<br/>
own body and how tired he is feeling. A strict &quot;lights out because I said<br/>
so&quot; does not allow children to feel that because they are too busy crying<br/>
&quot;unfair&quot;. But the freedom to do this means that he listens to me and takes<br/>
notice if I recommend an earlier night for any real reason. One day he had<br/>
been feeling unwell earlier in the day and came to me after tea and asked<br/>
what time I recommended he settle down for the night.<br/>
<br/>
However, now my husband is stressing about our second son (8 years old). I<br/>
usually go and check on him before I go to sleep and ask if he wants to be<br/>
tucked in. Sometimes he does, sometimes he decides to put his own light out.<br/>
But if my husband decides &quot;its far too late, he&#39;s only eight years old, we<br/>
can&#39;t have him sleeping in till 9.00 am every morning...&quot; we end up with a<br/>
power struggle  and a son who is determined to stay up as late as possible<br/>
regardless of how he feels. Because we are flip-flopping between these two<br/>
approaches, the son is very conscious of the time and trying to stay up as<br/>
late as he can. I am hoping that my husband will back off and leave it to me<br/>
and honestly, he gets so stressed about it, he probably will.<br/>

you grow up a certain way it is difficult to think that there might be <br/>
another way to do things. Also it is a loss of control for him, that might be <br/>
scary too.  He might also be having the &quot;are we doing the right thing&quot; <br/>
doubts. It might just take some understanding and gentle reminders of how it <br/>
is working and what the long term goals are etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893408502">What&#39;s wrong with sleeping past 9:00?   My husband will call from work and<br/>
say &quot;Did you all get up at the crack of noon?&quot; (as in &quot;the crack of dawn&quot;<br/>
which doesn&#39;t happen much around here)  Besides, I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s much<br/>
healthier for kids (and adults) to sleep until they wake up naturally, if<br/>
possible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the issue. Not the unschooling end of things it is the disagreements <br/>
on choices with DH. I am not perfect but he has childhood baggage and refuses <br/>
to dump it. His way or the highway.<br/>
I just take each day and try to deal with the issues before he delivers them <br/>
to the kids especially the oldest.<br/>
He has come a long way but often takes 1 step forward and 10 back so it has <br/>
been like having a fourth child.<br/>
I do understand what you are saying also, I do!<br/>

  &gt; I have the same trouble but I can see progress. With our oldest son, after<br/>
  &gt; years of disagreeing about a set bedtime, I have worn my husband down. Son<br/>
  &gt; one (11 years old)  now turns his light out when he is ready - usually <br/>
  &gt; after<br/>
  &gt; husband and I are asleep. He regulates himself having some really late<br/>
  &gt; nights and earlier ones other nights and although this does depend a lot on<br/>
  &gt; how exciting the book is that he is reading, he is also more aware of his<br/>
  &gt; own body and how tired he is feeling. A strict &quot;lights out because I said<br/>
  &gt; so&quot; does not allow children to feel that because they are too busy crying<br/>
  &gt; &quot;unfair&quot;. But the freedom to do this means that he listens to me and takes<br/>
  &gt; notice if I recommend an earlier night for any real reason. One day he had<br/>
  &gt; been feeling unwell earlier in the day and came to me after tea and asked<br/>
  &gt; what time I recommended he settle down for the night.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; However, now my husband is stressing about our second son (8 years old). I<br/>
  &gt; usually go and check on him before I go to sleep and ask if he wants to be<br/>
  &gt; tucked in. Sometimes he does, sometimes he decides to put his own light <br/>
  &gt; out.<br/>
  &gt; But if my husband decides &quot;its far too late, he&#39;s only eight years old, we<br/>
  &gt; can&#39;t have him sleeping in till 9.00 am every morning...&quot; we end up with a<br/>
  &gt; power struggle  and a son who is determined to stay up as late as possible<br/>
  &gt; regardless of how he feels. Because we are flip-flopping between these two<br/>
  &gt; approaches, the son is very conscious of the time and trying to stay up as<br/>
  &gt; late as he can. I am hoping that my husband will back off and leave it to <br/>
  &gt; me<br/>
  &gt; and honestly, he gets so stressed about it, he probably will.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s the issue. Not the unschooling end of things it is the disagreements <br/>
  on choices with DH. I am not perfect but he has childhood baggage and refuses <br/>
  to dump it. His way or the highway.<br/>
  I just take each day and try to deal with the issues before he delivers them <br/>
  to the kids especially the oldest.<br/>
  He has come a long way but often takes 1 step forward and 10 back so it has <br/>
  been like having a fourth child.<br/>
  I do understand what you are saying also, I do!<br/>

Im am usually up till 1 or 2 just going through the emails. He falls asleep <br/>
within 5 minutes of getting in to bed so that was something I said last <br/>
night. He doesn&#39;t even know what time Dustin goes to bed cuz he is sleeping. <br/>
I said I am awake and I know when I go up stairs at 11 Dustin is snoring. <br/>
Heck the 3 year old has been sleeping in our room the past week or so she is <br/>
up later than our son. I think its a father son thing. Tonight was better he <br/>
left him alone went in and gave him a hug and said nothing. Progress....<br/>

  HI,<br/>
   I had a simular situation about bedtimes in this home. My dh <br/>
believes that when it is bedtime you just go to sleep(he can sit on <br/>
the sofa and be asleep in less then a minutes),our girls need to <br/>
unwind by either reading or quietly playing in their beds.<br/>
  We have set bedtimes the 8 year old has to be in her bed by <br/>
8:30p.m. if she wants to read or play,otherwise it is 9:00p.m. The 14 <br/>
year old is a nightowl..she goes to her room at 9:30p.m. but doesn&#39;t <br/>
shut her light off till 12:00p.m. and she is up and ready to start <br/>
her day at 7:00a.m.<br/>
  I have tried the no set bedtime but I have found that my girls want <br/>
a set time...to atleast be in their &quot;corner of the world&quot; as we call <br/>
it.<br/>
  I feel whatever works in your home..I know that our dh&#39;s have <br/>
strong ideas on how things have to be. When my dh worked for Office <br/>
Depot he never saw the girls except on the weekends,but I had to have <br/>
set(no letting it slide on times),but found that they didn&#39;t interact <br/>
with him. So I came up with this idea and it works much better.<br/>
