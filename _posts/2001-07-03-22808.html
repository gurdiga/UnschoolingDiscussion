<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324761043">I need some great ideas to help make chores fun for my children.<br/>
<br/>
We do a 15 min hotspot routine where we choose the messiest room, crank up the tunes and sing and dance while cleaning as much as we can within the 15 mins.  I was thinking about making a chore wheel for each child to spin but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to be much fun.  <br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, if you have any ideas for cleaning games can you please share them with me?<br/>
