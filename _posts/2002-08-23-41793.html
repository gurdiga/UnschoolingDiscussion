That was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
I used &quot;slide show&quot; and it left all those windows on my desktop, so as I <br/>
clicked them shut, the rabbit &quot;got better,&quot; nearly came back to life.<br/>
<br/>
It seems rabbits must decompose more artfully and efficiently in England than <br/>
in New Mexico.  We get dead animals dry up so that the skin is hard as a rock <br/>
and they get flat.  The ants will eat the insides and are kinda frisbee-like, <br/>
like cow pies.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in wet places there aren&#39;t frisbee-like cowchips dry as dust, nor <br/>
flat petrified mouse corpses.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little there was a dead porcupine, sitting looking fairly healthy <br/>
except for many years dead.  We saw him every year, just inside an old mine <br/>
shaft where we used to go camping.  He was hollow from little bugs eating the <br/>
inside, but he was still in his original shape, NOT all gone like that <br/>
rabbit.  <br/>
