<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896114741">Faith,No offense taken, just a point that breastfeeding may not be the<br/>
best option for the family.� I think we can all agree that in most<br/>
cases, it is the best for baby.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Andi,<br/>
&gt; I hope nothing I said made you think that I believe breastfeeding is<br/>
&gt; the only healthy way to do it, because that is not how I feel.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes it&#39;s hard for<br/>
&gt; others to understand what you mean over e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The majority of time baby was with us, even today it is that way.� Every<br/>
once in a while we go sans child, but reliable sitters that I trust are<br/>
so hard to find.� My last one just went off to college.� Now a days it<br/>
is a matter of finding the right kind of sitter, rather than taking her<br/>
with us.� Until she was a year, she did pretty much sleep in her crib,<br/>
by herself.� A trip at that time upset the balance and it has pretty<br/>
much been a family bed since, which works for us, but I know it doesn&#39;t<br/>
with most.� I used a baby sling sometimes, but most of the time if she<br/>
wanted to play or be held, I just stopped and interacted with her.� My<br/>
back would not of been able to handle it either!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now with attachment parenting did you go out every once in a while,<br/>
&gt; just you and your husband, or was the baby always with you?� Also,<br/>
&gt; when baby fell asleep did<br/>
&gt; you put her in a crib or ... what did you do?� I&#39;m just curious.� I<br/>
&gt; know some of you have talked about keeping the baby in a sling on you,<br/>
&gt; but I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
&gt; for the sake of my back.� I don&#39;t have the greatest back as it is, and<br/>
&gt; I would think that it would make it worse.� I would love to hear what<br/>
&gt; you, and anyone<br/>
&gt; else, have to say.<br/>
