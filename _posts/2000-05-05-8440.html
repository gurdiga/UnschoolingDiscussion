&gt; Hi all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do not open any attachments to any posts, even from your mother - unless<br/>
&gt; you were expecting it and the attachment name is what you expected (such<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; a photo). If you accidentally do so, do not reboot your computer until<br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; have taken evasive action by running a current virus scan/cleaning.<br/>
&gt; &quot;Exe&quot;<br/>
&gt; files are terribly dangerous, but other file extensions have been<br/>
&gt; identified as infected so don&#39;t trust any attachments except possibly<br/>
&gt; jpeg<br/>
&gt; and gif ( I haven&#39;t seen them on the lists yet).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you have your system options set to automatically open attachments<br/>
&gt; (and<br/>
&gt; this is the default in OE) go change it at once. Also, in the &#39;My<br/>
&gt; Computer&quot;<br/>
&gt; area, click &quot;View&quot;, then &quot;Options&quot;, and then &quot;View&quot; again - and make<br/>
&gt; sure<br/>
&gt; the &#39;Show all file extensions&quot; is checked. This way you will always see<br/>
&gt; what kind of a file is attached to your messages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is anyone immune? So far you seem to be safe IF you are running anything<br/>
&gt; except win98 or above plus Outlook Express. This worm takes advantage of<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; security hole in those programs. Microsoft is offering a patch to close<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; barn door, but their site is as busy as all the others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you do not have a recent-update to a virus scan on your computer, or<br/>
&gt; (shuddering) you don&#39;t have such a program at all, surf over to<br/>
&gt; Housecall<br/>
&gt; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://housecall.antivirus.com/explorer.html">http://housecall.antivirus.com/explorer.html</a>&gt;. You will need to<br/>
&gt; register,<br/>
&gt; and have an option to sign up for a free newsletter (Trends) that<br/>
&gt; wanders<br/>
&gt; in once in a while with accurate virus information. You download a small<br/>
&gt; program, select which drives you want checked, and go do something else<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; about 15 minutes. You can even keep surfing, because this is a separate<br/>
&gt; window.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Norton and Mcaffee and all the other antivirus sites are terribly busy<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; people doing updates they had neglected. If you run the AllAdvantage<br/>
&gt; Viewbar (pays you $25 every other month,) you can get an almost free<br/>
&gt; copy<br/>
&gt; of McAffee with eternal updates. That&#39;s a great deal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Other sites where you can find information and updates include :<br/>
&gt; Trend Tracking map - see where each virus has been identified<br/>
