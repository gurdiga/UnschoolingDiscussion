<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091908587">Hi guys,<br/>
<br/>
I hear you&#39;re sick, or you kids are, or you are depressed, etc., and I just think, man if these guys tried HOMEOPATHY with a good homeopath (no self-prescribing) they would be so pleased and surprised at the results!<br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;s another homeopath on this list and I&#39;m sure she will agree with me: all those ailments can be treated with homeopathy in a gentle and effective manner. Plus, kids LOVE homeopathy because it comes in litle sugar pills. And it works for depression too, with no side effects or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just a sincere hope that you&#39;ll try it sometime...<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
Yol<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m a bit late reading these post sorry.  I have over the years been on different things for depression. (It runs in the family, aunt has been locked up, on meds most of her life, mom on meds for several years now... ect)  I was reading your post about Celexa, I have found that most of the med make me very fatigued and not much use to myself, does this one make you really tired?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Heidi,<br/>
&gt; No, I&#39;ve had no problems at all being on Celexa.  The first few days I had a bit of an upset stomach, but that&#39;s all.  I was fatigued and no use to anyone BEFORE the Celexa.  I have never had any problems with depression before, but this year was different.  I didn&#39;t like myself.  I cried ALOT.  I rarely, maybe never, had a good day.  I felt like my kids and husband were getting cheated big time because I just wasn&#39;t myself.  I felt like my life was one big chore, I never smiled or laughed anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I have my old self back.  I laugh, make jokes, play with my kids.  I have so much more energy and don&#39;t mind doing chores now that life is more than that.  And I&#39;m enjoying playing with my husband again now, which had also become a chore :-(    Although I&#39;ve never been on an anti-depressant before, I would recommend this one, but I can&#39;t compare it to others.  My doc said it would rebalance the seratonin etc in my brain which had gotten out of whack due to the unusual amount of weirdness going on in my life all at once.  I&#39;m not sure it would be right for you but you could discuss it with your doctor.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have to just also add another great experience with Celexa. My daughter<br/>
&gt; was on it for a year. Also along with counseling too. She had never been on<br/>
&gt; anything before either and was very apprehensive about going on it. She<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t like to take any kind of meds really. She had no problems with it at<br/>
&gt; all. It worked very well and after a year she was able to go off of it and<br/>
&gt; has so far been fine. It&#39;s been about 3 months or so since she hasn&#39;t been<br/>
&gt; taking it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mary B<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Has anyone found anything that their kids will take when sick? Kids who<br/>
&gt; normally won&#39;t take anything at all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have two here that seem like they would rather die then take something to<br/>
&gt; ease their discomfort. I&#39;ve tried different liquids, chewables, soft chews<br/>
&gt; and pills. The only thing I can get into them is colloidal silver, which may<br/>
&gt; make things not get worse but doesn&#39;t help with the symptoms. Other than<br/>
&gt; that and some saline nose spray, they sniff and snot and sneeze all over the<br/>
&gt; house and get anyone who isn&#39;t sick, sick. I have one like that now and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; desperately trying to keep everyone else healthy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any ideas?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone found anything that their kids will take when sick? Kids who<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; We often have this problem.  Right now my kids will only take medicine that<br/>
&gt; happens to be orange in color and flavor.  It stinks.  And of course, when<br/>
&gt; they get sick next time, they will demand another color.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My daughter, in particular, doesn&#39;t eat or drink during the first few days of<br/>
&gt; a bad cold or asthma attack.  We just had croup here, it was awful.  I resort<br/>
&gt; to threatening pedyalite and using a dropper.  Usually before that I&#39;ll buy<br/>
&gt; all sorts of stuff that I think might be appealing or fun.  Popsicles,<br/>
&gt; pudding, jello, different juices, it&#39;s all an exerice in futility.  she tends<br/>
&gt; to vomit with mucus production and after that, all food and drink are bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We did find those lollipop cough drops this time around, they worked.  Zinc<br/>
&gt; lozenges made for kids, I think.  I didn&#39;t buy them.  And carrot/apple vruit<br/>
&gt; juice worked this time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a challenge.  I&#39;m sorry you are going through this now, today.<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know if they still make it, but for a while you could get<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you are open to homeopathy. It is a pretty amazing system of medicine. Here are some resources that will get you started.<br/>

This is a great site with suggestion of remedies for specific common ailments. It&#39;s like a handboook online. Great for all those coughs, colds, flus, headaches, etc.:<br/>

ailments. It&#39;s like a handboook online. Great for all those coughs, colds,<br/>
flus, headaches, etc.:<br/>
