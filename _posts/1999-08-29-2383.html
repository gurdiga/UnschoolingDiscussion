<div id="ygrps-yiv-313191347"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  I am very surprised<br/>
&gt; to see Pat Montgomery lined up as a key note speaker, because her<br/>
&gt; philosophy<br/>
&gt; of relaxed, child-led learning is in direct contrast to  the<br/>
&gt; conservative<br/>
&gt; Waldorf approach of teacher as repository of knowledge and culture.<br/>
&gt; Agaf<br/>
&gt; Dancy heatedly refuted student initiated learning in the elementary<br/>
&gt; years at<br/>
&gt; the first WE conference, claiming the young child is not old enough or<br/>
&gt; wise<br/>
&gt; enough to know what is available for him to learn so he needs a<br/>
&gt; teacher to<br/>
&gt; expose him to the world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have always learned from reading and thinking about Steiner and his<br/>
approaches; but my limited experience of Waldorf Schools has always been<br/>
disappointing -- all of the trappings of Steiner, but with little of the<br/>
inner reasoning, nor encompassing the perhaps unsettling truth that<br/>
Steiner learned from children much more than they learned from him.  The<br/>
curriculum of the Waldorf schools I have seen is different (and in good<br/>
ways) from your run-of-the-mill public school, but in the strictures<br/>
placed upon children by even having a curriculum (one-size-fits-all)<br/>
approach, it is profoundly similar to public education.  I honestly<br/>
don&#39;t think Steiner would have approved, at least of what I have seen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I strongly feel that all of the debate over homeschooling in the<br/>
&gt; elementary<br/>
&gt; and secondary years is so misguided; we should all really be working<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; universal higher education.  The world would be a vastly different<br/>
&gt; place if<br/>
&gt; everyone could go to college/grad school and study and do what they<br/>
&gt; want to<br/>
&gt; do, and contribute their God-given gifts towards a better world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is happening in colleges and grad schools these days (I&#39;m perhaps<br/>
overgeneralizing) is also so disheartening.  First of all, they must<br/>
deal with the learning diseases kids coming out of public education<br/>
bring with them.  Next, the dumbing down of liberal education for the<br/>
purpose of providing a few required courses so the students can get on<br/>
with the real business of careering.  Finally, so much of its has become<br/>
a business in and of itself that sometimes it almost seems that the fact<br/>
that learning is supposed to take place there is almost an afterthought.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, enough of that.  Let us know how your experiment with the &quot;open&quot;<br/>
public school works out!<br/>
