 </span></blockquote>No, it doesn&#39;t make any difference to the rest of the world how someone<br/>
homeschools any more than it makes a difference how someone eats. The<br/>
discussion perhaps looks like someone saying this is how I homeschool and<br/>
others saying, no you&#39;re wrong you need to do it this way.<br/>
<br/>
But the discussion -- at least on some people&#39;s part! -- is about clarifying<br/>
what is and what is not *unschooling*.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to be *pure unschoolers* -- not just be more relaxed<br/>
homeschoolers -- then they need to see real unadulterated unschooling in<br/>
action. It&#39;s *scary* to get away from the well traveled shore. We&#39;re trying<br/>
to show how people do navigate successfully without relying on the shoreline<br/>
at all. There *are* some parts where you&#39;ll be scared and most people will<br/>
feel more comfortable retreating back to shore. That will work for them.<br/>
(*Unschoolers* don&#39;t feel it will work as well. If we did think there were<br/>
better ways we&#39;d be doing them! That&#39;s not a condemnation of someone<br/>
choosing some other way, just honestly following what we believe in.) But we<br/>
want those who *don&#39;t want to rely on the shore* to know it isn&#39;t necessary.<br/>
It *will* take some uncomfortableness to learn to see things in new ways,<br/>
but it *does* work.<br/>
<br/>
For those who want to travel out beyond the shore/lessons only occasionally,<br/>
the information is still valuable and they can pick and choose what they<br/>
like and feel comfortable with. For shore hugging/lessons there&#39;s *plenty*<br/>
of places to get that kind of information. (There are *hundreds* of sites<br/>
and books and articles where you can find ways to make kids write. There are<br/>
a few handfuls (if even!) of sites where you can see kids learning to write<br/>
without being made to. Is it so wrong to want to fiercely protect<br/>
information we feel is unique and valuable?)<br/>
<br/>
As another example pure, unadulterated unschooling or vegetarianism or<br/>
sailing or Buddhism or living off the grid information is useful to those<br/>
who want to be those things in their pure form without compromising. The<br/>
information is *also* useful to those who don&#39;t mind compromising. They can<br/>
take what they like and leave the rest. On the other hand information about<br/>
those ideas that suggests compromises for the uncomfortable parts is *only*<br/>
useful to those who don&#39;t mind compromises but *isn&#39;t* useful to those who<br/>
want to embrace those ideas without compromises.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re just trying to say here&#39;s unschooling in it&#39;s pure, unadulterated<br/>
form. Take it all and call it unschooling. Or take just the parts you like<br/>
but please call it something else as a courtesy to those who are trying to<br/>
get the pure form.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?<br/>

for continuing shifted yesterday a bit.  I realized that I don&#39;t care<br/>
what you choose to call me but telling me to go away after my first<br/>
(kinda sorta) education related post was probably not a good way to get<br/>
support for the movement or to help those who may need it.<br/>
I&#39;m not even sure who said it but if I had been a more sensitive type, I<br/>
would have cut and run and you all would never have known if I were a<br/>
first time homeschooler looking for a path or not.  I stuck around for<br/>
other reasons and discovered that there are only a few here who are like<br/>
that - tell people to go away or that they are wrong.  <br/>

I&#39;ve been thinking about his for a day....I don&#39;t know why I don&#39;t understand this<br/>
debate..  Strange that I can&#39;t seem too....<br/>
Maybe it is that I am trying to classify where I belong?  I&#39;m not sure.  I guess<br/>
this matters to me, though I didn&#39;t think it did.<br/>
Can I ask some more questions to you (and others who are reading)?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are there people that are aiming to be a &quot;pure unschooler&quot;.  I guess I never<br/>
thought of aiming to be any sort of homeschooler.  I just wanted to be with my<br/>
kids, and for us to live our life together.  Sort of share the journey of life so<br/>
to speak.but it *does* work.<br/>
<br/>
The analogy of traveling beyond the shore is wonderfully put.  A very clear picture<br/>
in the mind of learning at home I think.  (probably alot of other things that are<br/>
done against the popular opinion)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Is it so wrong to want to fiercely protect<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, seems like a very normal, human reaction.  This sentence has really been<br/>
sticking in my mind though...  I just don&#39;t feel a need to defend it.  If others<br/>
don&#39;t agree with the way I raise my children, birth my children, feed my children,<br/>
conduct my marriage, plant my garden ect, ect so on and so on...  that is just fine<br/>
with me.  They can do it their way.  I just never thought of protecting and<br/>
defending.  Maybe I&#39;m living in a safe fog though.  (though I like that safe fog)<br/>
:)<br/>

what you mean here.  I may be too loose in my thinking.  I am the most unrigid of<br/>
people.  This seems like a very rigid ...um....whats the word....  classification?<br/>
I see things &quot;looser&quot; if that makes sense.  I have a hard time believing that<br/>
people are all or nothing of anything.  We (as in humans)  seems to be constantly<br/>
changing, and evolving in many ways...our thoughts as well as bodies.<br/>
Am I understanding this the way you meant?<br/>

almost getting funny how much I keep trying to figure this out.  Maybe like I said<br/>
before I don&#39;t care what I am, and I don&#39;t feel a need to defend a movement (as in<br/>
the unschooing movement)<br/>
I&#39;m not sure much of my post is making sense, but I really appreciate your hard<br/>
work in explaining.  I&#39;m really thinking hard about this.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been thinking about your post.  I guess the need to define comes if<br/>
you feel that unschooling is bigger than just your family.  Not all of us<br/>
will give ourselves to the &quot;cause&quot; or &quot;movement&quot;.  Some, like Sandra and<br/>
others, will feel strongly enough about the social impact  they begin to<br/>
think beyond their own children, to what it could mean for all children. <br/>
 Like any social movement it begins with a personal choice.  You have<br/>
made your personal choice and know it&#39;s right.  At some point, maybe, if<br/>
you see a friend&#39;s child suffering humiliation at public school,  you<br/>
might decide to speak up.  &quot; Do you know there&#39;s a better way?  Doesn&#39;t<br/>
this child deserve more?&quot;   When enough people begin to search for that<br/>
better way, they will need to know WHAT to look for.  They will want<br/>
examples,  WHAT is this?  WHY does it work?  HOW do I implement it?<br/>
If you say &quot;homeschooling&quot;  and someone is looking to you for that better<br/>
way, and in their mind &quot;homeschooling&quot;  is text books and drills and<br/>
structure,  they won&#39;t find it.  <br/>
You and I might never tour the country speaking on behalf of unschooling,<br/>
or write books, or make ourselves available to others who have questions.<br/>
 But if you use that one word, and we all know it&#39;s bigger than just a<br/>
word,  it might make all the difference to your neighbor&#39;s child or your<br/>
sister&#39;s child or your friend&#39;s child.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are there people that are aiming to be a &quot;pure unschooler&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, though it sounds a bit odd put that way! As though it were a cult where<br/>
the goal is to follow some nonsensical rules to reach nirvana ;-)<br/>
<br/>
First there&#39;s the certainty -- from observation, personal experience,<br/>
reading and thought and discussion, at least to our satisfaction -- that<br/>
given a rich, nurturing, real environment free from coerced learning we<br/>
trust that kids will grow in the direction that suits them best.<br/>
<br/>
So, perhaps the first sticking point for people understanding why<br/>
unschoolers defend the unschooling process is that unschoolers have<br/>
different goals for their kids than the average parent and the second<br/>
sticking point is we&#39;re certain that the standard way of thinking about<br/>
learning will interfer with those goals. It&#39;s more on the order of trusting<br/>
that nurturing kids interests to the fullest extent -- if immersed in the<br/>
process of living (like food shopping and bill paying and voting and so<br/>
forth) -- will allow kids to absorb what they need for life and grow into<br/>
who they are.<br/>
<br/>
The average parent thinks of learning more in terms of feeding their kids&#39;<br/>
capabilities. They want to make sure the kids have a solid foundation to<br/>
begin building whatever the kids want to.<br/>
<br/>
But, like most foundations, the kids are limited to what they&#39;ve been handed<br/>
and unfortunately aren&#39;t given the skills to expand or start over from<br/>
scratch. On the other hand, the unschooled kids will have a foundation<br/>
they&#39;ve been shaping to their own specifications from the get go *and* in<br/>
the process they&#39;ll have been acquiring the skills to build in any direction<br/>
or configuration they need.<br/>
<br/>
Most homeschooling parents are on a continuum between the two extremes.<br/>
<br/>
The first sticking point doesn&#39;t get talked about much. It just sort of<br/>
evolves out of taking the unschooling journey. It&#39;s hard to stay on the fast<br/>
track to Harvard when you realize how wonderful the flowers and streams and<br/>
woods are along the way ;-)<br/>
<br/>
The second sticking point is where unschoolers get defensive about what is<br/>
and isn&#39;t unschooling. Without understanding the first and then also<br/>
realizing the second is necessary for the first, then unschoolers can come<br/>
off as seeming rigid and inflexible as though they&#39;re saying &quot;McDonalds is<br/>
not food!&quot; when it seemed like people were just generally talking about<br/>
lunch ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So unschoolers basically believe coerced learning will interfer with the<br/>
type of unfolding their hoping to nurture in their child.<br/>
<br/>
*To me* the purpose of the list is to help people along the unschooling path<br/>
and to share with other unschoolers. Anything else the list gets used for is<br/>
fine as long as it doesn&#39;t interfere with those two. (Others may perceive<br/>
the purpose of the list differently.)<br/>
<br/>
Part of the defensiveness is because most people come to unschooling filled<br/>
with scripts about how learning needs to take place: practicing, directing<br/>
and so forth. And those people who are trying to &quot;get&quot; unschooling need to<br/>
see a model free from those scripts so they can build new paradigms for<br/>
themselves. Whether they become radical unschoolers or not, it&#39;s still a<br/>
difficult process to go through and most unschoolers are sympathetic to<br/>
newbies coming along, being painfully aware of their own difficult journey<br/>
to a new way of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
And part of it is because the list is for unschoolers to share unschooling<br/>
with each other. For those who aren&#39;t pure unschoolers to suggest ideas that<br/>
aren&#39;t unschooling is sort of like a visitor suggesting a Buddhist ritual<br/>
might be nice in the middle of the Catholic service ;-) It does cause some<br/>
confusion when a self-identified unschooler comes in and offers methods that<br/>
other unschoolers are ceertain will interfer with unschooling goals and<br/>
people&#39;s understanding of unschooling.<br/>

We say &quot;the kids don&#39;t go to school&quot;<br/>
<br/>
they say &quot;Oh, you homeschool?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I say &quot;kind of&quot; or &quot;yes, but we don&#39;t do school at home&quot;<br/>
<br/>
or we say &quot;we homeschool&quot;<br/>
and they say &quot;what curriculum&quot;<br/>
and I say &quot;None--it&#39;s like the old open classroom stuff from the 60&#39;s&quot; <br/>
because in New Mexico that was big stuff and most people over the age of 30 <br/>
were involved in it one way or another.<br/>

&gt; you see a friend&#39;s child suffering humiliation at public school,  you<br/>

would say something like &quot;Do you know about homeschooling?  We really love <br/>
it. &quot;  Then follow up with more info if there was any interest.  In a way <br/>
that reassures the parent that there are several other options without <br/>
finding fault with the parent -- and probably just making them defensive <br/>
anyway.  I would try to offer hope and encouragement without a pinch of <br/>
judgement and superiority.  Some folks think they have found the answer -- <br/>
that&#39;s terrific.  But it&#39;s not the answer for everyone.  The only &quot;answer&quot; <br/>
for everyone, imo, is to figure it out for yourself, one situation, one <br/>
family, one child at a time.  The only &quot;movement&quot; I hope to see developing is <br/>
one where every parent knows what all their choices are and feels confident <br/>
enough to make a conscious decision.  Whether they end up hsing or not.  <br/>
