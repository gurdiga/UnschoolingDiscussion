<div id="ygrps-yiv-884342453">I&#39;ve been wondering if I should tell this story or not, but I think I <br/>
will.  <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who are lucky enough to know Janene, you know she is <br/>
very--well, she knows her own mind.  As soon as she could walk, which <br/>
was right under a year, she was hard to deal with in any situation that <br/>
had to do with streets, cars, parking lots, etc.  No amount of talking <br/>
about cars, helped, she continued and continued to run out into the <br/>
parking lot, running toward the streets, etc.  By the time she was three <br/>
I was scared to death that she would be hit because she was very quick, <br/>
very smart, and very good at slipping away.  I did use the sling a LOT, <br/>
and that helped but it wasn&#39;t the perfect answer. I also would hold her <br/>
tight, in my arms, or just hold her hand, and that was working but I <br/>
made the decision that she needed to understand better how dangerous a <br/>
situation it was.  So I did something that even today, 2 years later, I <br/>
wonder if I should have.  Sometimes I think it was good, it solved the <br/>
problem.  Other times I think so totally traumatized my child and I <br/>
never should have done that.  This is what I did.<br/>
<br/>
I put a soda can, half empty, behind the wheel of my tire.  I had my <br/>
mother roll backwards slowly over the can, and Janene and I watched it <br/>
get squished.  Janene immediately broke down, crying hysterically.  It <br/>
took a long time to calm her.  The result was immediate though.  Janene <br/>
immediately stopped running into the parking lot, instead she would <br/>
insist on holding my hand or being held in arms when entering a parking <br/>
lot.  To this day, she is super careful in parking lots and near <br/>
streets.  She will hold onto my shirt if a hand is not available.  She <br/>
makes sure every body else is also safe, insisting that Lexie also be <br/>
right next to me and if there are any other children she makes them stay <br/>
next to me, making sure they hold my hand or shirt or purse strap.  She <br/>
is overly concerned about it.  <br/>
<br/>
To me, I&#39;m not quite sure what I did was worth it.  She was traumatized. <br/>
 Of this I am sure.  I just asked her and she has NO memory of the <br/>
incident, but I remember it, as does my mother and father and sister, <br/>
all who were there.  They all agreed that it was necessary, but I often <br/>
wonder if the emotional damage I did was worse than just keeping her <br/>
safe by holding her, loving her.  I know I never thought of spanking or <br/>
hitting her, but I also know it was a constant concern.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I do know I did the best I could at that moment in my life. <br/>
 Would I do it again, probably not.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159367121">Joylyn,<br/>
Your story triggered a memory for me.  My youngest (of 6) is a darling child, <br/>
all smiles and happiness, but one day when she was 2 1/2  (now 10)she got <br/>
into a defiant mood while we were out in the front yard planting bulbs.  She took <br/>
off down the street, looking over her shoulder laughing at me.  She was <br/>
headed straight for the intersection with the busy 4 lane highway and she wasn&#39;t <br/>
slowing.  It actually had become fun for her, the excitement of the chase and <br/>
all that.  She had enough of a head start and was not into listening and I just <br/>
knew she would reach the corner and keep going right out into the highway.  <br/>
<br/>
Luckily one of her older brothers was on his bike and he raced ahead of her, <br/>
laid the bike out flat in skid and jumped off and caught her.  She was enraged <br/>
at her will being thwarted.  But we all gathered ourselves back inside.  My <br/>
daughter raged and carried on, no amount of trying to reach her worked, so we <br/>
left her be.  In a little her BIG brother came home (there is a 9 year <br/>
difference and he is now 6&#39; 7&quot;) and all the kids shared the drama of the afternoon <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
Next thing I know my oldest and youngest are outside standing together in the <br/>
street, walking up and down, crouching down together, engaged in earnest <br/>
discussion.  I resisted the urge to run outside screaming &quot;Get your sister out of <br/>
the street,&quot; the fear thing was still hammering in my heart.  In a little <br/>
while they came back in and I took my son aside and asked what they had been <br/>
doing.  He explained that they were out looking at squished squirrels and stuff.  <br/>
He had calmly explained to her that that was what happened to things that got <br/>
run over and they had investigated how flat they were and that they couldn&#39;t <br/>
run and play any more, etc.  He said he told her he would be very sad if his <br/>
sister got hit by a car and looked like that.  <br/>
<br/>
I was a little horrified, positive that all sorts of emotional trauma would <br/>
ensue, but the very calmness and matter of fact way that her 11 year old <br/>
brother handled it had far more impact than anything I had said.  From that day <br/>
forward we did not have any repeats of that incident and my kids would all remind <br/>
each other of street safety with the catch word, flat squirrels. <br/>
<br/>
This is just one example of the many times that my kids have been wonderful <br/>
teachers to each other, instinctively knowing how to reach each other in ways <br/>
that I as an adult would not be as effective.<br/>
<br/>
As to your daughter&#39;s trauma, I hope she finds a balance point between her <br/>
need for safety and unreasonable fear.  Personally I would rather have a little <br/>
trauma than a dead child.  Whenever I look back and really wonder about a <br/>
decision in the past that is irrevocable I reassure myself with the fact that at <br/>
least I have given them something to take to therapy in their later years :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479149605">The flat squirrel thing.. thats also how I demonstrated to my kids that it <br/>
was not safe to get into the road.   Actually, roadkill is ever present out here <br/>
in the rural area where we live.   Lots of dead dogs, cats, possums, <br/>
squirrels, skunks ( Peeeuuuuu) etc can be seen every time we go somewhere.   Even <br/>
though we live in a rural area, we do live on a very busy highway ( by &quot;country&quot; <br/>
standards)  and my children have never ventured near the road.  <br/>
<br/>
OH, thats a lie.. one time, JP got in the road!  It was so TOTALLY my fault.  <br/>
 I was outside talking with a neighbor.  The kids were playing around in the <br/>
yard.  JP was about 3.   Dh was mowing the yard and he was doing the strip <br/>
next to the road.  One minute, JP was next to me playing, the next minute, he was <br/>
standing in the road waving at his Daddy on the lawn mower!!!    I had become <br/>
distracted in conversation and just didnt see him go towards the road.   He <br/>
was OK, we rescued him .. A car blew its horn to alert us.  Myself, my <br/>
neighbor, my DH, my kids and my neighbors kids ( 5 total) all ran down do the road to <br/>
get him and make sure he was OK.     I just picked him up and hugged him and <br/>
everybody was saying Jon Phillip, are you OK?  were you scared?  why were you <br/>
in the road?   I think all the fear and anxiety and relief from a whole crowd <br/>
of people was more than enough for him to get the idea that the road was NOT <br/>
SAFE.  Although, I really don&#39;t even think he realized he was in the road.  He <br/>
had been chasing after his daddy on the lawn mower and I he probably thought <br/>
anywhere his dad was had to be a safe place.   The lesson learned was MINE and <br/>
my husbands.  PAY ATTENTION!  <br/>
<br/>
You know, we also lost JP in Disney World when he was 5... but thats another <br/>
story :-)<br/>

Beth, that&#39;s really sweet!  <br/>
(In a flat squirrel sort of way, I mean.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sweet that he cared enough to tell her that.  Maybe seeing a squirrel is <br/>
what made him realize the danger, and he remembered and shared it because of <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Great story.<br/>
