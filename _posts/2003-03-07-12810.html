<div id="ygrps-yiv-90088866">When I first came to America I worked in a very large company where the<br/>
office was open plan.  I remember shouting across the room &quot;Does anyone have<br/>
a rubber?&quot;  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve heard so many people snicker and laugh out<br/>
loud in my life.  The woman who worked next to me grabbed me (I was also<br/>
standing up) and said &quot;you can&#39;t ask people that&quot;.  My response was &quot;but my<br/>
pencil doesn&#39;t have one and I need to rub out the sentence I just wrote&quot;...<br/>
She then explained that in America an eraser as the name for a rubber and<br/>
exactly what a rubber was.   I think I must have turned a very beet root red<br/>
and didn&#39;t live it down in that company for a long time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>AH, but Dawn, did you know that there&#39;s a dance called &quot;The Shag&quot;? I was the <br/>
Shag Queen at college. &lt;G&gt; I shagged every night. With MANY different <br/>
partners! Often for hours at a time. &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
My Brit friends STILL can&#39;t get their heads around THAT one! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anybody want to learn to shag at the conference? We even have our own <br/>
shaggin&#39; music! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

After visiting England, I&#39;ve always wondered how Brits handle being in a <br/>
donut shop or similar counter-situation which has a sign saying &quot;NO TIPPING.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First time I heard reference to &quot;a tipping lorry,&quot; I thought it meant an <br/>
unstable truck that was likely to fall over.   But it meant DUMP TRUCK.  And <br/>
when I saw a sign on the side of the road in the middle of nowhere on the way <br/>
to some little town that said &quot;NO TIPPING,&quot; I thought...<br/>
where have I seen a sign like that?  Behind the counter at the Dunkin Donuts <br/>
where I worked in Santa Fe.   <br/>
<br/>
EEEYEW!!!<br/>

I guess when prim Christian moms threaten to swat a kid&#39;s fanny, that&#39;s porn <br/>
