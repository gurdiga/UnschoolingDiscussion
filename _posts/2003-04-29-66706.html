Universalism, I think in Indianapolis, and the focus was on youth. As a <br/>
result, there were a ton of teenagers participating, going to workshops, etc. <br/>
It was great. The conference center was huge, with these very tall <br/>
escalators.  My favorite part, though, was overhearing this statement:<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the workshop was great. I learned so much about leadership in worship. <br/>
But then things were winding down at the end, so we left a little early to <br/>
ride the escalators.<br/>

 I never got to play with elevators really until I was a teenager.  <br/>
 Imagine. <br/>
 I was deprived. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The best elevator ride I ever had while growing up, was a 13 story building <br/>
in Fairbanks (the tallest at the time). We only went there on very special <br/>
occasions, to eat at the &quot;Tiki Cove&quot;, a Chinese restaraunt that we LOVED.<br/>
That was the sum of my cool elevator experiences until I grew up and moved to <br/>
Portland, OR. <br/>
Oh! Except for on family vacations. I remember the Space Needle being super <br/>
exciting!!<br/>

spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>

the May Company elevator up and down (it was really isolated and almost no <br/>

feeling, especially if it suddenly stopped just when you were getting the <br/>

floor suddenly...good memories!<br/>

If there is a bank of them, we take bets on which one will get to us, first.  <br/>
That&#39;s our elevator game.<br/>

in the elevators!  We used to run up the down escalators until we got caught<br/>
and kicked out.  And there was a really scary circular exit from a parking<br/>
garage that we used to skateboard down on Sundays when it was closed.  (That<br/>
was when most skateboards were just board with roller skate wheels bolted<br/>
on.)<br/>
