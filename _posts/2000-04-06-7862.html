  Would you want to talk about what you see as *concrete*?  I do not want to<br/>
seem to pick at these issues, especially if there is stress surrounding<br/>
what&#39;s been happening.  Plus, I think it&#39;s perfectly fine to say something<br/>
like, &quot;mom is having a hard time seeing that you can do _____ would you mind<br/>
proving it to me. ;)  I did this a couple of time with my teenager.  Other<br/>
times I have been able to sit back and really watch for what was worrying<br/>
me, and I was able to find the math  and writing skills I was looking for.<br/>
And of course a couple of time my temper got the better of me and I snapped<br/>
about learning/school issues.<br/>
<br/>
On another note we got a new computer program today,  Zap by Edmark, and<br/>
I&#39;ve not seen my 8 year old for hours and hours.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;                 We&#39;re actually doing the opposite of you. We&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; unschooling for the past few months and it stresses me out too much not<br/>
&gt; having something concrete everyday. We are going to try Oak Meadow this<br/>
&gt; fall. I&#39;m glad to hear you like it. I doubt we&#39;ll follow it to a tee, but<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s nice to have something to fall back on.<br/>
