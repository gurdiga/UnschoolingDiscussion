<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842493013">I&#39;ve been enjoying the thread on children learning to play the piano<br/>
and am finding it very informative.  I bought our two small boys a toy<br/>
 Grand Piano manufactured by First Act, and it came with stickers for<br/>
the keys.  I haven&#39;t yet put them on and wonder if I should?  I guess<br/>
it would be educational for all of us (as neither parent plays), but<br/>
part of me wanted to allow the kiddos to experiment and fiddle around<br/>
on their own w/o the keys being labeled.  Below I&#39;ve pasted a quote by<br/>
John Holt on the topic of children learning to play music.  Thought<br/>
some might be interested.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I have since come to feel very strongly, partly from my experience in<br/>
music and my own work on the cello (about which I wrote in Never Too<br/>
Late), partly from the little I know of music history, that<br/>
improvisation lies at the very heart of all music making and should be<br/>
a central part of every kind of music instruction.  Much of my own<br/>
time on the cello I spend improvising in different ways, and if I were<br/>
teaching cello or any kind of instrument to children or adults, I<br/>
would urge them to spend some of their time doing the same: either<br/>
trying to play by ear tunes they know, or thinking up tunes in their<br/>
mind and trying to play them, or simply moving their hands around the<br/>
fingerboards or keyboards, with no conscious plan, just hearing<br/>
whatever notes come out. <br/>
<br/>
In other words, there can be varying amounts of conscious control in<br/>
improvising.  At one extreme, we try to make our muscles play the<br/>
tunes, other people&#39;s or our own, that we hear in our minds.  At the<br/>
other, we let our hands move on their own, and listen to and think<br/>
about what they bring to us.  It is when our muscles, hands, and<br/>
fingers can improvise with the least conscious control that we are<br/>
most truly improvising and have the most natural and effortless<br/>
control of our instruments.<br/>
<br/>
Little children do this when they are singing their charming endless<br/>
made-up songs.  They are not first hearing a tune in their minds and<br/>
then trying to sing it.  They are simply singing, and letting whatever<br/>
comes out, come out.  We ought to encourage them in this, and do more<br/>
of it ourselves.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1478150931">Hi Jennifer<br/>
<br/>
It is not a piano but my youngest learnt to play a glockenspiel without labelling the keys. He is only 6 and enjoyed messing around to get the tunes he wanted out of it.  As an experiment I gave him sheet music ( that came with it)  with coded notes that corresponded to the coloured keys on the instrument but he ignored them so I took them away. So  would say let them get on with it and ses how it goes.  If frustration sets in you could ask them if they would like the labels on then.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it depends on what the kids want. Mackenzie (ds) wanted to know which notes were which and putting stickers on the keys was the easiest/quickest way for him to see that. I only had some colored star stickers and some animal stickers, so some of our keys became &quot;gorilla&quot; and &quot;cheetah&quot;. Which is funny, because even when he plays on another piano without the stickers and he is reading music, I can hear him saying under his breath &quot;red, blue, gorilla, gorilla&quot;, LOL. So for him it was a help. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter ignores the stickers and plays by ear. She has been taking Suzuki violin for 2 years, and one thing I really like about that program is that they do not push reading music at all. She has really developed the ability to play by ear and can pick out anything she wants on the piano. My son doesn&#39;t really have the same ear ability that she has and was getting frustrated trying to pick out songs or even having me play bits so he could learn them from me. For him, the logical-brained guy, the stickers as visual cues worked so much better.<br/>
<br/>
So really, it all boils down to what would work best for your kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love that quote (and indeed his book is really interesting). Our experience here is that the key labels didn&#39;t prevent any experimenting or fiddling around. Mackenzie tends to learn a song and then fiddle with the parts of it. He learned Greensleeves for instance, then he will do things like play it with the bass hand playing the first note, then the right hand playing the second note but an octave higher, then going back to the bass hand for the 3rd note. Or he&#39;ll play with adding chords, or he has even composed some music and written it down for me to play. And like I said, Asa ignores the stickers completely and plays, fiddles, composes, noodles, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031084213">If you have plastic keys on your piano (not ivory-and-wood, which hardly <br/>
anyone has anymore anyway) you can put the note names, or numbers, or whatever, on <br/>
with crayon, up above where the fingers touch.  It&#39;s EASY to wipe off with <br/>
kleenex.  Or you can use washable markers.  It will come off easily.  Just don&#39;t <br/>
give littlest kids the idea of crayoning the keyboard or taking a permanent <br/>
marker to it.  But for older kids, it&#39;s easily doable.<br/>

&lt;&lt;and it came with stickers for<br/>
the keys.  I haven&#39;t yet put them on and wonder if I<br/>
should?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do the stickers have the letters of the notes, or just<br/>
colors?  I think the color thing is weird, personally,<br/>
it seems like an extra thing to learn, an intermediate<br/>
step that doesn&#39;t add much value in the long run, but<br/>
maybe that&#39;s just us. <br/>
<br/>
We just bought letter stickers for our keyboard.  I<br/>
haven&#39;t put them on yet, but Alex asked for them. I<br/>
think it&#39;ll be especially helpful for us because we<br/>
practice hit or miss, a few days at at time, for<br/>
hours, then two weeks later we pick it up again, etc. <br/>
They&#39;re removable, supposedly, lol, so we can take<br/>
them off if/when we learn how to read the staff. <br/>
<br/>
 They have little sharp/flat notations, too, that&#39;s<br/>
good, I want to start learning those. <br/>
<br/>
It might be enouraging to find music online for<br/>
beginners with just the letters like we did, and play<br/>
songs right away. <br/>
<br/>
Ode to Joy (with right thumb on middle C, then you&#39;re<br/>
next finger is on the next key, so your 2nd finger is<br/>
on D, 3rd on E, and so forth)<br/>

EEFG GFED CCDE DCC(hold)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that we both say the letters while we play,<br/>
mumble mumble. lol <br/>
<br/>
 This one might be tough at first for small hands,<br/>
because E is the middle finger, but I wanted to give<br/>
you an example of what might work with those stickers<br/>
if you choose to put em on. <br/>
<br/>
(Warning: This song gets annoying very quickly! lol )<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the only thing you might do well to remember<br/>
is to play with your wrists up, not resting on the<br/>
keyboard, (just like typing) it&#39;s just a good habit<br/>
that&#39;ll help if/when you play faster and more<br/>
complicated stuff later.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing my music teacher taught me that I found<br/>
useful, lol.  <br/>

=============<br/>
<br/>
Because of a trip that started to get boring once, all my kids can sing  The <br/>
Flintstones in this way (which I figured out phrase by phrase without an  <br/>
instrument while we&#39;re driving through the desert with three restless  kids):<br/>
 <br/>
5 1, 8--6 5 1 <br/>
5  4 3 3 4 5  1   2   3---<br/>
5 1, 8  6 5 1<br/>
5  4 3 3 4 5 1 2 1 <br/>
 <br/>
We didn&#39;t do the next part, just that.  But they&#39;ve since gone up to  various <br/>
sorts of instruments that had the notes or intervals marked  with numbers and <br/>
played that song, most noteably on a set of steel drums at  the Museum of <br/>
International Folk Art in Santa Fe.<br/>
 <br/>
And since then when the concepts &quot;octave&quot; or &quot;a fifth&quot; have come up, it&#39;s  <br/>
easy to say &quot;like &#39;1-8&#39; on the Flintstones,&quot; or to sing &quot;FIVE one&quot; and say &quot;a  <br/>
fifth.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t intend for it to be so far-reaching in their lives, but there it  <br/>
is. Heck of a tool.<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure I DON&#39;T have perfect pitch.  But I could have figured  it <br/>
out, as long as I could find a starting point.  I can tell how  many steps one <br/>
note is above another.  <br/>

--------------<br/>
 <br/>
I could figure out what key it was in  by humming around in it (or not  &quot;what <br/>
key,&quot; but where the tonic/do was) so I went up to the beginning note by  <br/>
thirds (again, just humming around to see where the beginning note was).   So if <br/>
that was the fifth and the next note was 1/do/tonic, I found the other  ones <br/>
relative to that.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s just relative pitch.  It will work in any key.<br/>
 <br/>
Perfect pitch is when someone has something in them to compare a note  to.  <br/>
They can tell a D from an F somehow, by counting up or down from a  note they <br/>
have indwelling somehow.  Some vibration in them is a  constant.  I don&#39;t have <br/>
that.  My friend Martha does.  Some  people think perfect pitch means just <br/>
being able to tune an instrument, but  that&#39;s relative pitch.<br/>

Transposing is transposing.  <br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re singing in the shower and you  just start on whatever note comes <br/>
to you, and you&#39;re in tune for that key  (whatever it might be) that&#39;s about <br/>
relative pitch.  It&#39;s starting with one note and knowing where to go next to <br/>
sing the song you have in mind.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m playing an instrument and start on a note, I might find that&#39;s not an <br/>
easy key for the song and I&#39;ll move to another key.  That&#39;s not relative <br/>
pitch.  That&#39;s operating within the bounds of that instrument.  <br/>

  I can sight read music, but I just get a starting pitch when it matters, or <br/>
I don&#39;t when it doesn&#39;t matter.   <br/>
<br/>
When we do our madrigal and parts-music singing, we play the starting pitches <br/>
on a recorder or piano.  But in the absence of an objective source, we can <br/>
start in a key we know isn&#39;t too high for the highest voice nor to low for the <br/>
lowest, and then find the other notes in the chord from that.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another kind of music I sing sometimes called Sacred Harp (shape <br/>
note, or fa-so-la are other names for that general style of music) and it&#39;s all <br/>
based on relative pitch.  Someone &quot;sets the pitch&quot; by singing the tonic note and <br/>
others find their starting pitches from that.    It&#39;s never &quot;in a key,&quot; it&#39;s <br/>
pitched each time by the person who&#39;s leading the singing.  There&#39;s only a <br/>
fairly small window of what will work and if it ends up being too high or too <br/>
low, it can be started again.<br/>

If you can&#39;t tell when you have gotten it or haven&#39;t, that can be overcome <br/>
with practice and tricks.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t EVER hit one, not even once, not even with friendly others <br/>
signalling &quot;a little higher&quot; or &quot;lower,&quot; that&#39;s tone deaf.  Can&#39;t hear it, can&#39;t <br/>
match it.<br/>
<br/>
Misses sometimes might be tone-hard-of-hearing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875872118">Yeah, tone deafness would be never hitting the notes. &quot;Can&#39;t carry a <br/>
tune in a bucket&quot; describes such an individual. LOL My husband, and <br/>
my best friend both have this characteristic.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes getting it right means that, with practice, you&#39;d be <br/>
getting it right more and more. That&#39;s my daughter. With strong <br/>
accompaniment, you&#39;d be able to sing right on, most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Singing a scale accurately without accompaniment means you have a <br/>
good ear, but not perfect pitch. That&#39;s me, my oldest son, and my <br/>
mom. <br/>
<br/>
someone with a good ear could do this game that Sandra describes, of <br/>
finding the relative pitch of a song. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558221159">Okay, but if I took your &quot;numbers&quot; that you figured out for <br/>
Flinstones theme, and played starting at C, it would be in the key of <br/>
C. I could then take the same numbers and start with D or G, and, <br/>
playing the same &quot;numbers&quot; the song would then be in a different key. <br/>
Right? Isn&#39;t that transposing?<br/>
<br/>
I mean, that is also doable, for some, with the music on the page. If <br/>
a note is a half step up in the key of DMaj, then it&#39;s a half step up <br/>
in any key. If a note is a fifth up from the starting note in C, then <br/>
it&#39;s going to be a fifth up from the D, as well. It&#39;s knowing what <br/>
that half step or that fifth is, in the different key.<br/>

-=-<br/>
 <br/>
In a way.<br/>
It&#39;s not transposing if you never knew what key you were in in the first  <br/>
place.  &quot;Transposing&quot; is a formality about changing something from key to  <br/>
another with the key in mind.  In simplest rock&#39;n&#39;roll terms (or  <br/>
country&#39;n&#39;western), it&#39;s moving to another higher key for the last verse.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
-= If a note is a fifth up from the starting note in C, then <br/>
it&#39;s going  to be a fifth up from the D, as well. It&#39;s knowing what <br/>
that half step or  that fifth is, in the different key.<br/>
<br/>
right?<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Yes.  Usually the things they&#39;ve found that were numbered were  little-kid <br/>
sets of bells or chimes or little electronic keyboards with numbers  on, and <br/>
usually the 1 was a &quot;C&quot; because they were set to keyboards.    The steeldrum <br/>
might not&#39;ve been in C. I don&#39;t have perfect pitch, so I don&#39;t  know, but the <br/>
Flintstones played, using their numbers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Similar if not identical methods are called &quot;solfege&quot; and &quot;Kodaly&quot;.  I<br/>
mention this only because if someone is interested in learning this type<br/>
of singing, it may be called by different names in different regions.<br/>
There are a couple places doing solfege with homeschooling families here<br/>
in the greater D.C. area.  My son wants to try it next year.<br/>

That WOULD be irritating!<br/>
So I&#39;m glad now to be blessed with relative only.  Nothing inside me  is <br/>
acting as a tuning fork, and yet I can tell if a chord is in tune.   Lucky me! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
