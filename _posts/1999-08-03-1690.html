She had some piano background, and could read music.  I would ask at the <br/>
local &quot;real&quot; music store (You know, one that hires people who KNOW music!!)<br/>
<br/>
As for Sacramento -- it is looking less likely at this point.  We have had a <br/>
financial set-back (AGAIN!!) and I&#39;m not sure if I can swing it.   &lt;sigh&gt;  <br/>
But if I can&#39;t go for sure, I&#39;ll be saving for NEXT YEARS conference, for <br/>
sure.<br/>

Guess what??!?&nbsp; With this newly rediscovered interest in music at<br/>
my home, I remembered that someone mentioned a *long* time ago (not on<br/>
this list..) about a terrific catalog for music lovers called &lt;b&gt;Lark in<br/>
the Morning&lt;/b&gt;.&nbsp; I looked them up on my search engine, and sure enough,<br/>
they&#39;ve got a website.... &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.larkinthemorning.com&quot;&gt;http://www.larkinthemorning.com&lt;/A&gt;&nbsp; Even better<br/>
than THAT... is they have pictures of *all sorts* of way-kewl instruments..<br/>
such as a &quot;rain stick&quot;, which is a piece of dried out cactus.. I suppose<br/>
the &quot;innards&quot; of it.. seeds or something have shaken loose... ANYWAY..<br/>
(I don&#39;t know exactly how they make &#39;em..)... there&#39;s a sound sample you<br/>
can click on, and hear what a rain stick sounds like!&nbsp; And yes, it<br/>
does sound like falling rain!! LOADS of music samples, all sorts of instruments..<br/>
I played and played on there for HOURS last night!! Tristan (my **almost**<br/>
3yo) was on my lap, playing along.. and it was **soooo cute***... every<br/>
time I played a particular steel drum sample (of two that I&#39;d downloaded),<br/>
he&#39;d turn around, give me a grin and a huge hug!&nbsp; Then, I&#39;d play different<br/>
samples of different instruments, and he&#39;d do something different, or do<br/>
nothing, but whenever I played that steel drum segment, here came the smile<br/>
and hug!&nbsp; It was KEWL!!!<br/>
&lt;p&gt;Also, for those of you with kids who play video games... Y&#39;all familiar<br/>
with the Zelda game for N64???&nbsp; Wellllll.... my kids LOVE that game..<br/>
and I haven&#39;t paid much attention to it at all, except that Luke (my 9<br/>
yo) keeps trying to tell me about it.. and particularly about something<br/>
he called &quot;orcachina&quot;, and about some neat kind of flute that Zelda (or<br/>
someone on that game) plays..... So.. while I was at the Lark in the Morning<br/>
website, I came across a flute-&quot;ish&quot; instrument called an Ocarina, which<br/>
I thought might be the same thing from Zelda... and SURE ENOUGH, IT WAS!!<br/>
***Boy*** were MY kids impressed with **THAT**... (cuz their daddy is always<br/>
telling them &quot;those games have nothing to do with real life... and so on..)...<br/>
So, we listened to the various samples for the different sizes and shapes<br/>
of Ocarinas, then the boys wanted me to see Zelda&#39;s.. so I went off with<br/>
them...&nbsp; And on Zelda, there are certain codes the kids can learn<br/>
to play the various songs that Zelda (or maybe it&#39;s a different character<br/>
on that game, I don&#39;t know..) can play... and the kids knew them all..<br/>
and played them all.. and hummed along.. and watched the &quot;notes&quot; on the<br/>
staff that displayed on the screen (which I thought was super-kewl).. and<br/>
so on..&nbsp; and *then* we played with our recorder.. and on and on and<br/>
on... a total &quot;music night&quot; at our house, until the wee small hours of<br/>
the morning..<br/>
&lt;p&gt;FUN!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1920127882">Oh yeah... I forgot to mention.. that there&#39;s also a Ukelele sample on the Lark<br/>
in the Morning website... and I agree, Sue, it *does* sound like it would be<br/>
fun to play!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a mandolin sample, and when comparing the two sound samples, I<br/>
also think the Ukelele would be **much** easier for a beginner... but the<br/>
mandolin has a very lovely sound... relaxing to my ears.. but the U. sounded<br/>
like a *blast* of fun...<br/>

      well, i just spent over an hour at this site.  i was going to <br/>
pop in for a second, add it to my bookmarks for later, and then go <br/>
get some other stuff accomplished.  HA!  i should know better by now. <br/>
 i got hooked!  been there for well over an hour looking at some of <br/>
the neatest instruments and playing sound clips.  i was fascinated by <br/>
the simplicity of a lot of them.  although i saw a lot for <br/>
$1.00-$10.00 that i&#39;m sure any little (or big) kid would LOVE, i <br/>
thought it would be fun to take it one step further if the kids could <br/>
make some of them - great musical instrument, cultural, sound, <br/>
rhythm lesson!  well a visit to one of my recent favorite sites <br/>
quickly got me to this site:<br/>
<br/>
Recycled Rythms<br/>
http://www.discover.net/~jarjetb/<br/>
the first instrument on the list is a RAIN STICK!  this one is made <br/>
with a bamboo stick (i would imagine the garden shops would carry <br/>
those!) but the cactus version is probably made the same.  there&#39;s <br/>
also a pan flute made out of straws!  <br/>
<br/>
The site i started out at is:<br/>

Go down to &quot;Musical Crafts&quot; for lots more instrument ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021202860">Hi Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! I&#39;ll be sure to check out those links!  Also, I *think* DK publishes<br/>
a book on making instruments.. I think we even may own a copy (many books<br/>
around here are in boxes as we are planning a move soon)... but I&#39;ll see if<br/>
I can find it and let you know!<br/>
