<div id="ygrps-yiv-450760034">Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to drop a note and let everyone know that I am home from<br/>
the hospital.  The surgery went well but the doctor found more than he<br/>
expected.  I had a tumor.  The results have not come back but he is<br/>
pretty sure it was benign.  Anyway, I am too tired and groggy to read my<br/>
mail but I wanted to say hi.<br/>
<br/>
Talk to you soon!<br/>
<br/>

                S�och�in ar domhan, <br/>
