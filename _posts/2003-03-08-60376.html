<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176161521">I came across this today in a book by Toni Morrison. Leapt off the page at me.<br/>
&quot;She was back in that place whre final wars are waged, the organized trenches of high school, where shame is the plate-shifting time it takes to walk down the hall, <br/>
failure is a fumble with the combination lock and loathing is a condom wafer clogging a fountain. <br/>
Where aside from the exchange of clothes and toys, there are no good intentions. <br/>
Where smugness reigns, judgments instant, dismissals permanent. And the adults haven&#39;t a clue.<br/>
Only a prison could be as blatant and as frightening, for beneath its rules and rituals scratched a life of gnawing violence. <br/>
Those who came from peaceful well-regulated homes were overtaken by a cruelty that visited them as soon as they entered the gates. <br/>
Cruelty decked out in juvenile glee.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522434018">I really like Toni Morrison&#39;s writings.  I&#39;ll bet there&#39;s a lot of truth to<br/>
that one.  I was talking with a friend who has really good kids in high<br/>
school.  She was saying that it isn&#39;t geeky anymore to play in the band and<br/>
that the kids don&#39;t categorize and torture other kids for their choices<br/>
anymore.  I asked her if she really knew that to be true.  She said &quot;Well,<br/>
it isn&#39;t as bad as it was when we were there.&quot;  Could that be true?  Or is<br/>
she looking through rose colored glasses....because she is only seeing it<br/>
through what her kids share with her now?  They seem to have a pretty good<br/>
relationship but I find it impossible to believe that kids aren&#39;t still<br/>
categorized and pigeonholed, etc..<br/>

class. Usually I&#39;m remembering at the last minute that I have a class<br/>

tense and upset!<br/>

kids got the best grades so it wasn&#39;t uncool to be smart.<br/>
<br/>
But I also think it doesn&#39;t feel anywhere near as bad from the outside. And<br/>
kids often learn not to complain about things they feel they have no control<br/>

Well I can only speak locally but yes they still are. And from what I know, <br/>
even more so than I remember from school. When I was in high school, (early <br/>
and mid 70&#39;s) it was just the popular kids, the ones no one thought about <br/>
and the geeks. Now they categorize the kids a lot more so. Smart ones and <br/>
pretty ones. Athletic ones and trouble makers. Preppies and head bangers. <br/>
Kids who are potheads, kids who do rolls, kids who have sex a lot.... The <br/>
list goes on. Seems like there&#39;s a label for everyone nowadays.<br/>

dream, you can direct your dreams the way you want them to turn out.  Both<br/>
my older two have had great success with &quot;lucid dreaming&quot;.  We recently<br/>
discussed flying dreams and how to try to induce them.  I&#39;ve done this in<br/>
the past and it&#39;s really cool when it works!  Basically, you say to yourself<br/>
before going to sleep &quot;Tonight I&#39;ll fly&quot;or something similar.  You just<br/>
repeat this as you drift off.  Sometimes you have really great realistic<br/>
dreams of flying.<br/>

I&#39;m back in school and for some reason I&#39;ve misseda  semester and the exams are coming up and I can&#39;t find my timetable to I don&#39;t know which class I should be in. Sometimes part of my mind is saying<br/>
&#39;you have 3 kids, you have a degree, it doesn&#39;t matter if you fail the exams&#39; but I still can&#39;t figure out why I&#39;m back in school and I&#39;m worried what my mother will say if I fail the exams.<br/>
