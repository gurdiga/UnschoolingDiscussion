<div id="ygrps-yiv-1127247322"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    I just finished reading &quot;And What About College?&quot;  How do most of you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>keep records?<br/>
<br/>
I see two ways to get around the record-keeping worries:<br/>
<br/>
1.  When the children are in their teens, encourage them to enroll in<br/>
community college courses.  If they are motivated, and work hard, they might<br/>
be able to earn an associates degree by the time they&#39;re 18 or 19.  Wouldn&#39;t<br/>
you suspect that an AA should be &quot;good enough&quot; to earn them admission to a<br/>
university?<br/>
<br/>
2.  Pursue the mentor/apprenticeship option.  Encourage your children to<br/>
learn a trade.  Then later while they are working in the trade, see if they<br/>
can&#39;t take classes at the university (if that is what they want).  Sometimes<br/>
employers will pay the tuition for them.  Wow, what a deal!  For more on<br/>
this fascinating concept:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.life.ca/max/index.html">http://www.life.ca/max/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
3.  If the children are so inclined, they might work towards ownership of<br/>
the family business, or starting their own business.<br/>
There are many splendidly self-educated people out there who are<br/>
self-employed.  This option is a great one for free spirits.<br/>

serious about it.  Also they usually prefer upper-classmen to freshmen.<br/>

for unschoolers who want to get into a university.<br/>

coming from the same perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74916995">What a great arrangement!<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is that community college (if it&#39;s available in your<br/>
community) is an excellent way for unschoolers to qualify for university.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147847167">I have both university and community college experience.  I found most<br/>
teachers at the CC were really into their subjects and helping students. <br/>
At the U, many of the smartest teachers were only there to do their<br/>
research and seemed to think teaching classes was a nuisance.  Plus, my<br/>
CC classes were always WAY smaller!  Even before I started hs, I thought<br/>
I would encourage my kids to start at CC, then transfer.<br/>
