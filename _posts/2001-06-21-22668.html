<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880092081">Dear Ann,<br/>
If you have ANY questions about it: condition, manufacturer&#39;s warranty, etc. etc.,<br/>
ask BEFORE you place a bid.  If they don&#39;t answer you back, or don&#39;t give an answer<br/>
that satisfies you, don&#39;t bid.  Wait.  Another item just like it will come along. <br/>
If it turns out not to be what was advertised on the eBay site, try to resolve any<br/>
problems with the seller.  If nothing gets settled to your satisfaction, turn them<br/>
in to  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:abuse@...">abuse@...</a>.  <br/>
<br/>
Having said all that, most people selling on eBay are wonderful people to deal with.<br/>
 I have bought several items (too many items!) and have only had one bad turn. <br/>
But, ask questions first, bid second.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844247337">We bought our digital camera on ebay (and my wedding dress and veil and<br/>
tiara and all our kids&#39; tuxes and my wedding stationary and and and...).<br/>
<br/>
My rule of thumb is to *only* buy from vendors who have sold a *ton* and who<br/>
have been selling for several months. Also, many times I will write someone<br/>
privately and make the sale that way. They often have more than one of the<br/>
same product and will sometimes sell for cheaper because I save them the<br/>
hassle of putting the item up for bid (and the cost, albeit minimal).<br/>
<br/>
So if you know exactly what product you are looking for, check out the<br/>
person&#39;s selling history, other items up for bid, rating, etc. This tells me<br/>
a lot about what kind of seller the person is. And also keep in mind a good<br/>
ebayer will be as leery of you (first time buyer) as you are of them. They<br/>
have a lot to lose too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had a bad ebay experience. I did buy something once that wasn&#39;t<br/>
exactly what I expected (a toy - the picture made it look *much* larger than<br/>
it was but clearly stated the size) but I am still extremely happy with it<br/>
and that was *my* error.<br/>
<br/>
When we bought our digital camera, we also negotiated (behind the scenes,<br/>
after we won the auction) for extras at a lower price. A bag, an extra<br/>
battery, etc.<br/>
