<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103880934">A friend of mine once told me that she would be forever grateful to Sandra<br/>
because one time when this friend was being mercilessly attacked in a forum<br/>
we used to frequent, Sandra (who I don&#39;t think knew my friend all that well<br/>
at that time, but who I&#39;ve always always found to have a very good sense of<br/>
what is what) calmly said, &quot;Stop being hateful to (my friend).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ll be a karmic designated hitter here and say, for my friend who would<br/>
if she were here:<br/>
<br/>
Stop being hateful to Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
If you are frustrated, go buy a punching bag, but don&#39;t use the &quot;safety&quot; of<br/>
cyberspace to personally attack someone on this list, please. That is not<br/>
what it&#39;s here for.<br/>
<br/>
When you ask in public for people&#39;s ideas and help, it is helpful to learn<br/>
to deal gracefully with what comes your way and discard what won&#39;t work and<br/>
keep the rest. Neither you nor any of us get to pick who answers the<br/>
questions in a public forum.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t kind, useful, acceptable, or polite to disrupt the list with<br/>
personal attacks on another member.<br/>

*****Sandra just took an opportunity to take a pot<br/>
shot at me.. Like she does every time she finds a tender spot.  She wants to<br/>
always get the last word in and she aims lower every time she punches.<br/>
Folks  continually tell me to ignore her advice.  And I say again, why dont<br/>
she ignore my posts?    Uhhh, let me see, her kids are perfect, so what in<br/>
the world can she offer in the way of advice to folks who have special needs<br/>
kids?   Can&#39;t she just at least sit one out?  Maybe let some folks who<br/>
really<br/>
know what they are talking about offer some REAL support, advice and<br/>
suggestions. *****<br/>
