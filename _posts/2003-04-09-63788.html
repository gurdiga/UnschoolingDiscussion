which has a really busy network of forums for all aspects of the program <br/>
(questions for getting started, one forum for each grade level, legal issues, <br/>
etc.)  I cannot tell you how many posts I read about the best ways to &quot;cover <br/>
up&quot; the cultural pictures in the early level Usborne books.  Everything from <br/>
ripping out pages to coloring in little outfits over the naked bodies!  This <br/>
always had me rolling on the floor with laughter.  Thanks for bringing back <br/>
the memory.  I was in need of a good, hearty laugh today.<br/>

start for how long they will be: a 1 yr show, 5 yr show, 10 yr, whatever, as<br/>
long as you know upfront. Then the writers could really plan the whole thing<br/>
and not end up dragging things out till they die a sad and ugly death. I&#39;ll<br/>
miss Buffy, but I&#39;m glad they&#39;re going to do it right.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with you.  Joss Wedon has said that he carefully scripts<br/>
each year as though they aren&#39;t coming back, just in case!  Good man for an<br/>
evil troll who keeps us on tenderhooks...oops, did that slip out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading spoilers about what&#39;s going to happen.  Now I&#39;m trying to<br/>
forget them.  It&#39;s a mantra--Trust Joss, Trust Joss, Trust Joss......<br/>
