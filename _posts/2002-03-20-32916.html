&gt;Gargoyles?  Why might I want to watch it?  (I don&#39;t think my guys have <br/>
&gt;watched it, at least so far.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The Gargoyles are transported to Manhattan by the evil Xanatos. They <br/>
escape his manipulation and befriend a female police officer. There&#39;s <br/>
magic, good vs. bad, time travel, intrigue.<br/>
<br/>
Best of all, I personally have fun guessing who&#39;d doing the voices.. as <br/>
they have had many famouse and familiar actors/actresses on the show. <br/>
Including Sean Connery, Ed Asner et al.<br/>
