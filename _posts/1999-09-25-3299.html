<div id="ygrps-yiv-517700016">Regarding the dairy products thread, I noted the following in the<br/>
subject line of a recent post: &quot;Re: diary sensitivity&quot;!!! <br/>
<br/>
I love to watch &quot;Jeopardy,&quot; and my question to that answer would be,<br/>
&quot;What my 16-year old daughter feels when I open her top dresser drawer!&quot;<br/>

to switch to Microsoft.  Now I discover I can&#39;t spell check my emails.  Oh<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969463702">That had to be me! Spell checker doesn&#39;t do the sub line and I should<br/>
remember to check. (remember is one of those words that always gets<br/>
corrected for me too, I leave out the second m). It isn&#39;t my poor spelling<br/>
though, it is my fast typing.  (although I am a horrid speller, not that it<br/>
has hurt my life one bit). I am glad my dyslexic typing is amusing. I got a<br/>
laugh out of it Denise, thanks  for noticing.<br/>
