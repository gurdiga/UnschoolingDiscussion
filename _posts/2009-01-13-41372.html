<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191540107">Hey everyone, I will try to get my question out with a few common<br/>
examples of everyday life and I would like to see how others here<br/>
*deal* with this.<br/>
Today: Lukas and I head out for town stopping to get him some food he<br/>
wants,then we go to a game store then visit my Dad. It was fun. We<br/>
came home and like most days we play. We do alot together then he gets<br/>
into doing something by himself so I start reading on the computer.<br/>
Not more then a minute goes by and he runs in saying Hey mommy,I did<br/>
this or that. I say cool or wow and go back to reading. A few seconds<br/>
later he is back and so on. I then get a tone like OKAY,can i finish<br/>
this? I forgot to say he is 7yo.<br/>
sometimes i stop and play with him and we are done I try to go back to<br/>
what i was reading.It seems when he gets most of my time i should be<br/>
able to do something without being interrupted or would it be best to<br/>
go along with them until he is older?<br/>
I am not asking for a bunch of time...20 minutes?<br/>
I have said to him that i would like to finish and he has said okay<br/>
but comes running back in talking to me.<br/>
I have wrote in the past about the all day having to hear his video<br/>
games and I asked him to use head phones after 11pm at night and he<br/>
says NO. I have several different kinds that he has tried. He says he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like them so I have no quiet in the house and have accepted<br/>
that although i would like more suggestions.<br/>
I have said to him that he gets to be loud all day and i want some<br/>
time where it&#39;s quiet and I can do what i want. I guess i could wear<br/>
mack waxy earplugs...lol<br/>
If I say I do not want to be interrupted for such and such time would<br/>
that be telling him that my needs are important also? I worry that he<br/>
will feel like I&#39;m shutting him up.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1718710102">I wear earplugs a lot. I wear them to sleep because dh really needs sound to <br/>
sleep well. I wear them when I am trying to write because it makes me feel <br/>
like I&#39;m in  a box. Sound is muffled, reduced but not eliminated, so I can <br/>
still hear when Jayn calls to me. It means that Jayn can play her computer <br/>
games and watch tv and I can still do a bit of work.<br/>
<br/>
However I do most of my computing (eg blog work) before she gets up and <br/>
after she falls asleep on the sofa on those occasions when she falls asleep <br/>
before I do. I reduced the amount of time I spend on the computer, and <br/>
refocus my attention differently ever since Jayn accused me of loving the <br/>
computer more than her a few years ago. EG I only have two lists that I read <br/>
actively. I try to involve her in my online activities like my Etsy store as <br/>
much as she is willing.<br/>
<br/>
When dh takes Jayn out, I grab that time for some intensive writing stuff. <br/>
Right now she is calling for me to play a Nancy Drew game with her, so I&#39;d <br/>
better go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Expectations can be damaging to relationships!<br/>
<br/>
You expect that after spending all day with him that he could give  <br/>
you a few minutes and he&#39;s not so you&#39;re starting to feel resentful  <br/>
of him for not doing what you expect.<br/>
<br/>
It hurts relationships -- and this goes with relationships between  <br/>
adults too! -- to expect someone to respond in a certain way when  <br/>
they have no clue they&#39;re being tested to see if their natural  <br/>
responses match your expectations.<br/>
<br/>
You could ask him for 30 minutes :-) Set a timer or put on a 30  <br/>
minute video or music CD and when it&#39;s done, you&#39;re done. (And *do*  <br/>
be done. He&#39;s trusting you to keep your end of the bargain. If you  <br/>
damage his trust, it will come back to bite you in other ways! You  <br/>
may hear him say &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s what you *say* ...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If he can&#39;t go for half an hour, try a shorter time. But if he can&#39;t,  <br/>
he can&#39;t yet. Try again next year.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids -- and adults too! -- do need someone they&#39;re sharing  <br/>
life&#39;s happenings with. It&#39;s an extrovert thing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds like a solution imposed on him even if you&#39;ve given him  <br/>
several options of headphones. And the new problem becomes getting  <br/>
him to conform to your solution.<br/>
<br/>
Try going back to the original problem and brainstorming ideas with  <br/>
him. You&#39;d like to sleep at 11 and need some quiet. What are the ways  <br/>
that might happen? Instead of turning him into the problem -- he  <br/>
won&#39;t wear headphones -- involve him in the process of solving the  <br/>
problem.<br/>

Yikes.  I would have said the FIRST time that he can only play late  <br/>
at night if he wears headphones.  Either wear headphones or turn it  <br/>
off until morning.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said &quot;It&#39;s okay&quot; so many times to my kids they take me seriously  <br/>
when I say &quot;It&#39;s not okay.&quot;<br/>

Some families might have said &quot;Anything you want is okay,&quot; and that&#39;s  <br/>
a problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-914465629">I didn&#39;t read for years after having Simon and Linnaea. That&#39;s not true. I didn&#39;t read much for a long time after having Simon and Linnaea. I still only tend to read at bedtime or on the toilet. It isn&#39;t because I don&#39;t like reading, it&#39;s because reading takes a bubble that I have to live in for a little while to get back into a book. It helps for me to reread books that I know fairly well and enjoy as I can pick them up and walk away from them with greater ease than books that are new to me. <br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you don&#39;t really want to hear that, though. You want to hear that it is perfectly reasonable for you to have an uninterupted 20 minutes here and there. I&#39;ve found that the more I feel like I deserve something, the more I feel that it is perfectly reasonable for me to have 20 minutes uninterupted to myself, the less likely it seems to be that it will happen. It&#39;s all perspective. The more I can relax and let it be good to hang out, all the time, with Simon and Linnaea, the more I can embrace sitting with them and watching them play Halo 3 or playing Goblet or building towers or making a tuna sandwich or whatever it is, the less taxing the interruptions seem to be. And then, suddenly, my time is less required. Not always, not that I can take 20 minutes whenever I want, but somehow when I relax into being there and with them whenever they ask and more than just when they ask, when I am generous with me, I seem to get time to just do stuff.<br/>
 It&#39;s like I fill their cups and they can go for longer without needing my presence. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, it&#39;s even more amazing then that. My back went out earlier this month and I&#39;ve been hobbling around. And they cater to me. When I was really in pain and having trouble getting up from the couch, Simon was fetching the hot sock (a sock filled with dried beans that holds lovely heat when microwaved) and bringing it to me every time he thought of it. Linnaea was getting me drinks and food and the remote and their generosity was astounding. <br/>
<br/>
I love when they bounce into the room really excited and want to have me see the new thing, the old thing, the thing that they are bouncing about. I love being given that gift. It&#39;s so much better than another chapter of a book, an uninterrupted episode of Ray Mears Extreme Survival, or whatever. Someday they won&#39;t be in my home. Someday they will have a life that isn&#39;t so much about sharing with me. So loving it now is really important. Really important. <br/>

Eli is sometimes a constant talker.  Most of the time I love to listen but sometimes I just need a break.  Sometimes he can be quiet for a minute or to when I ask, more likely he can&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
The book Raising our Children, Raising Ourselves had something that really helped me.  She asked would you really want them to stop talking all day.  Knowing that I would hate that, helps me to be more gentle when we are in conflict.  I try hard to stop and listen, or gently set him up with something to do for a few minutes.  I know that Eli can be hurt very easily and thinking I did not want to listen anymore would hurt him terrribly.  <br/>
Some distractions: a puzzle, a game, a snack, reading to him, a bath, getting the mail, a movie, asking him to check/get something in another room, I wish he would talk on the phone.  Stopping a listening for a few minutes until he talks himself in doing something.<br/>
Some kids talk a lot.  Joust be grateful no one is medicating them for it.<br/>

Whoa.  Exactly.  Karl is big on talking, humming, chatting, commenting,<br/>
hollering and hooting.  I can not imagine him in school being ok with always<br/>
having to hush.  His dad is the same way, and when he is home he talks<br/>
almost constantly on the phone.  I&#39;m very very quiet by comparison.  It<br/>
takes it out of me to attend to lots of sound but it would absolutely take a<br/>
lot MORE out of me to have dead silence, and I would not enjoy the quiet if<br/>
it meant someone was being medicated into it.  !!  Ew.<br/>
<br/>
Lucky for me, Karl wears headphones sometimes (not always... and I&#39;m fine<br/>
with that).  Getting up earlier has worked well for me (and I&#39;m a night owl)<br/>
in order to have uninterrupted writing, reading, thinking time.<br/>

&gt; I am not asking for a bunch of time...20 minutes?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can really relate to this. Some days I feel as if I&#39;m going to explode if<br/>
I can&#39;t have just a few minutes of<br/>
quiet-concentrate-on-something-other-than-whatever-the<br/>
guys-are-doing-this-moment. I&#39;m lucky in that I can usually get one of their<br/>
other mommies to entertain them for a while or I can remind myself that<br/>
being fully with them is a conscious choice that I make each and every day.<br/>
<br/>
I have wrote in the past about the all day having to hear his video games<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and I asked him to use head phones after 11pm at night and he says NO.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like Sandra said in her reply, &quot;I would have said the FIRST time that he can<br/>
only play late at night if he wears headphones. Either wear headphones or<br/>
turn it off until morning.&quot;  For me, it&#39;s not a question of expectations,<br/>
but courtesy and boundaries. I wouldn&#39;t hang out with someone if s/he made<br/>
noise at all hours of the day and night even after I asked for some quiet<br/>
time. It&#39;s not a grown-up lords it all over the kid thing. If the guys ask<br/>
for quiet time or for me not to disturb them, I gladly comply. (In fact,<br/>
Ryan just came up and asked me not to disturb him and Ethan while they are<br/>
playing Jedi master with their new light sabers.) I do it for them because I<br/>
love them and want them to be happy, and they do it for me for the same<br/>
reason. If they don&#39;t, I take a deep breath and remind myself that they are<br/>
kids and I don&#39;t expect them to be short adults. I will, however, remind<br/>
them that it&#39;s polite to honor other people&#39;s requests when you can. Most<br/>
times they say &quot;Oh yeah. You&#39;re right.&quot; and try to be a little more quiet.<br/>
Sometimes, they say &quot;But we&#39;re playing and we need to be loud.&quot; When that<br/>
happens, I try to remind myself that whatever it is they are playing, they<br/>
won&#39;t play it forever or even all day, and that there are times when I need<br/>
to be loud, like when I&#39;m in the middle of baking something and need to use<br/>
the mixer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling. I guess I just meant to agree with Sandra&#39;s answer and then to<br/>
take it one step further to allow for exceptions, like important light saber<br/>
battles *grin*<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

But those times need to NOT be in the middle of the night, especially  <br/>
if one lives in an apartment building or crowded neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
There are laws.<br/>
<br/>
Why some parents decide not to be honest with their kids about laws  <br/>
regarding quiet and appropriate clothing and such I will never  <br/>
understand.  Being unschoolers doesn&#39;t put anyone outside of the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988341340">Hi there, <br/>
<br/>
Sound exactly like my kid LOL!! So much so, my hubby, peeping over <br/>
my shoulder, reading, thought it was a post from me!<br/>
<br/>
My solution, in the beginning, was to just forget about doing <br/>
reading, watching tv or internet, no point for i will only be <br/>
interrupted again, and again and again LOL! <br/>
<br/>
I just stay with DS, and use his enthusiasm to do things together. <br/>
If I have to do any cooking(if i ran out of my freezer stash), i <br/>
invite him to join in. If he is not interested, then everytime he <br/>
says &quot;look at this, look at that&quot;, i just say come and show me here <br/>
in the kitchen, if he says &quot;i can&#39;t&quot;, then I&#39;ll say &quot;wait a minute, <br/>
i&#39;m in midst of cooking, will be with you in 10 or 15 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I only catch up on what i wanna do, when hubby gets home and takes <br/>
over with showering DS and pjs and quite frequently, bedtime stories <br/>
too. So i either be going to bed at 7pm to read, or stay downstairs <br/>
and watch tv on my own.    <br/>
<br/>
DS soon got out of this mode, and I had the chance again to get on <br/>
with my daily routine. But sometimes, it happens again, but this <br/>
time, I find that i can sit next to him, reading and pay attention <br/>
to whatever he wants me to see. If the interuption gets too much, i <br/>
just forget my reading and join his games. <br/>
<br/>
As for the loud night time playing, we have yet figure out a <br/>
solution LOL! Tried getting DS to put on his headphone but he <br/>
complains it&#39;s uncomfortable. Frankly speaking, it only bothers <br/>
hubby, so am considering getting hubby the headphones for the tv <br/>
instead. Presently, DS is playing his Nintendo or psp on low volume, <br/>
while hubby watches tv on a reasonable volume, with me in the middle <br/>
typing on the laptop. Seems like all parties are happy.  <br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>
SharonBugs. <br/>

usually keep my internet browsers open all day, simply because I usually<br/>
can sit for only a few minutes at a time.  So, I&#39;ll read, then do other<br/>
things, then post something, then do other things.<br/>
<br/>
My focus is on my family first though, so, unless I&#39;m feeling<br/>
particularly cranky or unsocial, I try to do other stuff than just<br/>
reading, which I like a lot.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I have no idea why parents wouldn&#39;t be honest about things like that. I<br/>
always tell my kids what the laws and cultural expectations are and whether<br/>
or not  I personally agree with them. I also tell them whether or not I<br/>
would follow the law, the cultural imperative, or the custom and why I<br/>
choose to follow them or not. I do think that unschooling puts us outside of<br/>
the culture. We are breaking cultural norms. I don&#39;t think that not being<br/>
part of the dominant culture is as problematic as some people think it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380484848">I have always told Lukas that we must be quiet after 11pm. That&#39;s the<br/>
law. The video game loudness has to do with me not that neighbors can<br/>
hear, we have some pretty a pretty good size yard,a 1/3 acrea. Most of<br/>
the problem is that we have a small house that is open and any sound<br/>
is everywhere.  there&#39;s no bedrooms except one small one and he likes<br/>
to be around me.<br/>
 This house is owner finainced so the contract  limits our options but<br/>
we have 18 months and it is paid off!!<br/>
That means freedom for choices...yay! I am definitly seeing his<br/>
*interruptions* differently. I changed how I was thinking and I<br/>
decided to welcome them and because of that I am feeling more joyful.<br/>
I love him so much and he is so happy talking to me, i am lucky that<br/>
he wants to share with me. Seeing his eyes light up when he is<br/>
explaining what he did on his game and asking me questions is the<br/>
best! Him knowing that I am interested...really interested makes me<br/>
value this time I have with him! This is the only time (his childhood)<br/>
that I will have ALL this time with him! <br/>
For myself and us,We have gotten out more in the last few days and<br/>
that has been good. His Dad took him out too.We recently couldn&#39;t get<br/>
out because of money,truck problems and I got in a stuck place,<br/>
feeling. Tomorrow i am going to target by myself for awhile and that<br/>
will help.So thanks so much for helping me see things much better!<br/>

Karl happened into Brian&#39;s and my life and we have never been the same.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Karl was saying that I (his mom) am going to live thirteen<br/>
hundred years... the biggest number he could think of to rattle off then.  I<br/>
said oh not if he isn&#39;t there too, and he promptly informed me that he is<br/>
also going to live thirteen hundred years.  ;)  Oh good I said... that<br/>
should be a really nice long time.  Such conversations are a great way to go<br/>
off to sleep.<br/>
