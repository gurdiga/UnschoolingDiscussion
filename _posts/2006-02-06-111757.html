<div id="ygrps-yiv-944469716">I think learning that we, as parents, do not have to supply all of <br/>
the information to our kids is a big lesson to learn (and not always <br/>
an easy one!)<br/>
<br/>
You have a child that wants to be a veterinarian? Find out if they&#39;d <br/>
like to volunteer at a local vets office or animal shelter. If you <br/>
have a zoo nearby, they may even take teen volunteers. This will not <br/>
only help your child learn what&#39;s really involved in working with <br/>
animals, it will allow them to form relationships with adults in the <br/>
field (who will, in turn, help them learn what it really takes to do <br/>
that kind of work). <br/>
<br/>
The child that&#39;s interested in computer programming? Put the word out <br/>
that he&#39;s looking for a mentor (if he&#39;s interested). You&#39;d be <br/>
surprised at how often adults love the opportunity to share their <br/>
knowledge with someone who&#39;s really interested in what they do. <br/>
<br/>
And yes, kids *do* learn things because they want to. Sometimes it&#39;s <br/>
not clearly visible, especially if it&#39;s not something that we, as <br/>
parents, think is particularly valuable. But they do learn. All the <br/>
time.<br/>

anything American war related (from the Revolutionary War to <br/>
VietNam), video games, and his new current obsessions: Russia, banjos <br/>
and bluegrass music, and learning French.</div>
