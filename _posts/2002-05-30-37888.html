<div id="ygrps-yiv-1654465879">I know we&#39;re all unschoolers. What I mean is, does anyone have <br/>
children (or have you?) that have grown up in an unschooling <br/>
situation?  Or is unschooling too new for that?  If they (you) have <br/>
done this, I&#39;m curious as to what type work you do for a living, if <br/>
you went to college or chose another route...we&#39;ve been unschooling <br/>
for about 3 years now and wouldn&#39;t do it any other way.  Just thought <br/>
it would be fun to find out the different avenues people chose when <br/>
they weren&#39;t hampered by public school.<br/>

college for several years and works 30 hours a week at a company that sells <br/>
clays and glazes and pottery wheels and kilns. She currently plans to <br/>
transfer to a University of California and major in creative writing and <br/>
minor in ceramics. She has a LOT of unschooled friends and many are in their <br/>
20&#39;s. In fact, a big group of them are all meeting up in Oregon next week for <br/>
Quo Vadis -- a camp for unschoolers who are &quot;moving on&quot; into adulthood -- <br/>
most are in their 20&#39;s. Quo Vadis means somethng like &quot;Where to now?&quot; This is <br/>
their first year - it is composed of former Not-Back-to-School Camp kids who <br/>
are getting older and want to support each other as they go off into their <br/>
different directions -- college, career, or whatever. My daughter will <br/>
probably be the youngest. She&#39;s traveling for several weeks -- including the <br/>
week at Quo Vadis - visiting her friends in Northern California, Oregon, and <br/>
Washington. She made all the arrangements herself - including trains, busses, <br/>
planes, and shuttles -- and who is picking her up and where she is staying, <br/>
etc.  This is VERY common for unschooling kids - to take time to travel <br/>
whenever possible. I think it is a wonderful way for them to really exercise <br/>
their competence and ability to handle themselves, independently. <br/>
<br/>
--pam (nervous about her &quot;baby&quot; being out traveling on her own, but very <br/>
confident in her ability to manage it, too)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005213008">Hi April,<br/>
<br/>
I am Bill, Diane&#39;s husband, Diane sometimes does post on unschool brd.<br/>
You might find some interest in knowing that Thomas Jefferson and Thomas<br/>
Paine (Sp?) were homeschoolers.  A fun comment made by JFK when a few Noble<br/>
Winners were seated for dinner at the white house was that:<br/>
&quot;There has not been so much tallent in the white house since one night when<br/>
Thomas Jefferson ate alone.&quot;  My estimation is that was a correct statement.<br/>
