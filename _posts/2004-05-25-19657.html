<div id="ygrps-yiv-674607411">I&#39;m happy to post it, thanks, Sandra! Here it is; hope it&#39;s insightful. The <br/>
link is to a slightly rougher version and may not be active for a few days. <br/>
This was originally created to help give parents who punish their children tools <br/>
to handle things differently.  I was asked to keep it short but could&#39;ve went <br/>
on for pages! It&#39;s commonsense that most people who subscribe to attachment <br/>
parenting philosophies are already doing...but I do find myself rerreading as a <br/>
reminder~:)<br/>

Parenting In The Positive<br/>
By Debbie Rose<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As parents and caregivers I&#39;m sure we can agree that we want to do what is <br/>
best for our children. If we really search our hearts and are honest we learn <br/>
that hurting a child, no matter the intention, is not truly in the best interest <br/>
of the child. Nor is &quot;punishment.&quot; But we&#39;re at a loss. What&#39;s the <br/>
alternative? Most of us simply know of no other way.<br/>
<br/>
The following are suggestions that have been especially helpful to families, <br/>
perhaps one just like yours, and they are beneficial for the whole family.<br/>
<br/>
· Be trustworthy.  Keep your word and do your best to keep agreements.<br/>
<br/>
· Be a &quot;safe&quot; person your child can talk with and confide in.<br/>
<br/>
· Eliminate from your life whatever you can that takes your patience away <br/>
from your child.<br/>
<br/>
· Practice stress release techniques. Paint, write, walk, breathe. Make sure <br/>
you&#39;re staying hydrated and drinking enough water. When you&#39;re feeling well, <br/>
you&#39;re in a better position to think clearly and be there for your child.<br/>
<br/>
· Be respectful, kind and supportive of one another. Be courteous.  Say <br/>
&quot;please&quot; and &quot;thank you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
· Allow all family members (including toddlers) to contribute to the welfare <br/>
of the family. This empowers everyone and helps them feel they belong. Make it <br/>
fun and not a &quot;chore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
· Teach children to respect their bodies (spanking and/or hitting them is not <br/>
teaching respect for their bodies). Allow the word &quot;no&quot; to be an acceptable, <br/>
okay and safe word in your family. In a dangerous situation both could save <br/>
your child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
· Discover and celebrate your child&#39;s unique gifts and hidden talents. We&#39;re <br/>
all different and unique; it&#39;s what makes us special.<br/>
<br/>
· A daily dose of love goes a long way. Give your child hugs and say, &quot;I love <br/>
you,&quot; every day.<br/>
<br/>
· When a child &quot;acts out&quot; they are asking, (sometimes begging) for your <br/>
acknowledgment, love and attention. It&#39;s up to you as the parent to figure out <br/>
what&#39;s going on and why.<br/>
<br/>
· Have family meetings where everyone&#39;s voice is welcome and heard (including <br/>
babies). Keep them a pleasant and safe space where anything can be discussed.<br/>
<br/>
· Take care of yourself. Give yourself  &quot;me&quot; time. Whether it&#39;s a fifteen <br/>
minute bath everyday, a moment to take a &quot;time-out&quot; or &quot;cool-down&quot; for a few deep <br/>
breaths when you&#39;re feeling overwhelmed and stressed or an hour massage once <br/>
a month. Whatever is nurturing for you.<br/>
<br/>
· Establish a family ritual such as a daily evening stroll after dinner or a <br/>
weekly pizza and game night. These are what create enjoyable, loving and <br/>
lasting memories and give everyone something to look forward to as a family.<br/>
<br/>
· Remember that children learn about the world around them from us. Not <br/>
really by what we say but by what we do. What example are you setting?<br/>
<br/>
· Always be on the lookout for ways to empower your child instead of taking <br/>
their power away.<br/>
<br/>
· Catch your child being &quot;good&quot; and express your appreciation. Remain mindful <br/>
that there really is no such thing as a &quot;bad&quot; child.<br/>
<br/>
· Talk, talk, talk. Find out what&#39;s going on. Truly listen and care. Talk <br/>
with; not at and no lectures.<br/>
<br/>
· Strive to have a family where everyone is equal, including babies and <br/>
younger children. We&#39;re all humans worthy of acknowledgment, dignity and respect.<br/>
<br/>
· Provide an environment where it&#39;s safe to feel and explore all feelings. <br/>
It&#39;s how we express those feelings that may be appropriate or inappropriate. <br/>
Make sure your child knows it is okay to have and experience all emotions.<br/>
<br/>
· Know your child&#39;s developmental level. They may not be emotionally or <br/>
neurologically capable of behaving how you are expecting them to behave.<br/>
<br/>
· Diet matters. Too much sugar, caffeine (i.e. cola drinks and chocolate) and <br/>
junk food can cause anyone to feel grumpy, impatient or overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
· Provide positive opportunities for expressing and processing emotions. <br/>
Offer art supplies, musical instruments, your child&#39;s favorite CD&#39;s and something <br/>
to play them on, books, paper…whatever they&#39;re into and find helpful in order <br/>
to express themselves safely. Encourage and suggest tactile, interactive <br/>
activities such as gardening, water play, making mud pies, looking at cloud <br/>
formations, having a picnic under a tree or going for a walk. <br/>
<br/>
· Provide a safe space your child can retreat to that&#39;s all their own. It <br/>
doesn&#39;t have to be a whole room, just a comfy, cozy spot where they can go to <br/>
relax and unwind preferably with some favorite, comforting things nearby. A safe <br/>
retreat to go to can help shift the focus away from a situation that feels <br/>
overwhelming or that has become too stressful to resolve in the moment and is <br/>
just nice to have at any time.<br/>
<br/>
These are just a few ideas to get you started. There are many more in the <br/>
resources listed below and elsewhere. The bottom line is that children who are <br/>
forced to live in an environment where they are under the threat of physical <br/>
punishment, shame, humiliation or any other form of punishment are, on some <br/>
level, existing in a constant state of fear. They are always in survival mode. Not <br/>
an ideal place for a child to be.<br/>
<br/>
Would you prefer to teach your children through fear or through love? There <br/>
is no such thing as &quot;loving punishment.&quot; Would you like to provide an <br/>
atmosphere of constant fear or to provide a kind, loving and safe home? The choice is <br/>
up to you.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;I recently wrote an article that you may find helpful. It was created for <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; nonprofit that educates parents and schools on alternatives to hitting, but <br/>
&gt; there are some tips and more sources you might find helpful. Email me and <br/>
