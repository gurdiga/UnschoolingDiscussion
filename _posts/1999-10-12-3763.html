<div id="ygrps-yiv-817344907">Making the Decision to Homeschool<br/>
By Melanie Shimokawa<br/>
	I am an American living in Japan with my Japanese husband and our two<br/>
year old son, Mook - who is both.  It is common to send children as<br/>
young as two to cram school or baby genius school.  They are expected to<br/>
read basic Japanese by age five.  But, of course, every mother wants her<br/>
child to be ahead.  I figured, preschool starts at age four here, so<br/>
before then, I wanted him to be able to read English, since he won*t get<br/>
it anywhere else.  I bought him some educational software, but I wanted<br/>
to learn how to teach him after school.  So I looked all over the<br/>
internet for homeschooling, just for ideas to teach my son now, and when<br/>
he would go to school.  Never ever did I think that I would completely<br/>
homeschool him.  What about socialization?  What about things I can*t<br/>
teach him?  How could I afford all the equipment?  How would I know what<br/>
I was supposed to teach him?  So I would just teach him English after<br/>
school.  <br/>
	The more I researched homeschooling, the more wonderful it sounded, and<br/>
the more convinced I was that I could do it.  The more I realized how<br/>
much time would be wasted at school.  Then I remembered my own<br/>
experiences at school.  I was constantly playing sick to avoid having to<br/>
go.  I claimed to like school.  I thought I did.  But I would rather<br/>
have stayed home and learned what I wanted to.  I didn*t get any<br/>
positive socialization.  Bullied at recess and prevented from<br/>
socializing during class time, I feel I could have done better out of<br/>
school.  I realized that homeschooling doesn*t mean you have to stay at<br/>
home.  That would be boring.  My two year old now makes friends with<br/>
people at the store, whenever we meet anyone when we go for a walk,<br/>
people - grown-ups and kids alike - at the playground, the library,<br/>
church, etc.  He has more friends than I ever did.  He is never lonely.<br/>
	Even though he*s only two, Mook teaches me things I never knew before. <br/>
Just from following his interests, I have learned the names of all the<br/>
trains in Japan (though he still has to correct me once in a while), and<br/>
the parts of a train and how they work to make the train go.  I never<br/>
knew any of that before - neither did I care - but I know now.  And so<br/>
does Mook.  My husband and I both help him pursue his interests.  We<br/>
take him to the library, search the internet, and his educational<br/>
computer programs also help.  One thing leads to another, and through<br/>
phases of bulldozers, trains, and now dinosaurs, Mook is learning to<br/>
love learning and life.  He does worksheets once in a while - when he<br/>
really wants to, but to him, learning is not being forced to study<br/>
things he couldn*t care less about.  To Mook, learning is discovering<br/>
all the wonderful things about life.  That will continue, as long as he<br/>
has the chance to allow it to.<br/>
