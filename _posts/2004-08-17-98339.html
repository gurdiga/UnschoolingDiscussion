<div id="ygrps-yiv-84659115">********I&#39;ve started many novels only to decide a short way into them that they&#39;re not (to me) worth finishing.  Should I force myself to read the entire book so that I can judge it fairly as a whole?  Mabye that would be really nice of me, but I have better things to do with my time.  ********<br/>
<br/>
I must have some funky sickness &lt;BWG&gt; cuz I do finish awful books and movies... I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a hope that things will get better, or if it means I&#39;m too darned nosy to just leave it alone - I just gotta know exactly how awful it is... LOL<br/>
