<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what *didn&#39;t* help me, oddly enough, is counseling. maybe i had a bad<br/>
&gt; counselor or just didn&#39;t really need it, but it was such a huge waste<br/>
&gt; of my time and money.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My priest (and friend) said something about counselling that really stayed<br/>
with me, and made it much clearer to me why it doesn&#39;t work sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
He said that counselling is for people who are &quot;stuck&quot; and want to get<br/>
&quot;unstuck&quot;.  For someone working alone to change, and not stuck on some<br/>
problem(s), couselling may well be a waste of time and money.  For someone<br/>
who&#39;s aware of their &quot;stuckness&quot; but not really in the mood to get unstuck<br/>
right now, counselling isn&#39;t going to help, either.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with not being ready, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with<br/>
doing it yourself.  So many people think anyone with problems needs<br/>
counselling.  But there&#39;s more to it than that, of course.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, maybe that would help and inspire someone.  It helped me.<br/>
