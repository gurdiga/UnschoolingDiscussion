<br/>
We have a new puppy and have been reading some super books on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Culture Clash&quot;, Jean Donaldson..<br/>
let me tell you  THIS is an amazing and cool book!  This book is a good read<br/>
even if you don&#39;t have a dog.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Power of Positive Dog Training&quot;,  Pat Miller<br/>
This gives you a week by week training program and describes positive dog<br/>
training.<br/>
<br/>
here is her web site- she also has a e-mail list where she answers<br/>
questions!<br/>
