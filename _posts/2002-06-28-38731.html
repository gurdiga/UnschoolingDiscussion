<div id="ygrps-yiv-431573155">Just wanted to remind everyone about the Unschoolers Network 25th<br/>
Anniversary Conference coming up on Saturday, June 29 at Brookdale Community<br/>
College in Lincroft New Jersey. This conference is a must for anyone in the<br/>
New York/New Jersey area and well worth a road trip for unschoolers in other<br/>
states.<br/>
<br/>
John Taylor Gatto will give the keynote speech on &quot;The Paradox of Extended<br/>
Childhood.&quot; FUN Books will sponsor a special showing of &quot;A Life Worth<br/>
Living&quot; a video tribute to the late John Holt. FUN Books will have a variety<br/>
of titles by John Holt available as well as backissues of Growing Without<br/>
Schooling, the magazine he started. John Holt is generally recognized as the<br/>
father of the modern homeschooling movement and the person who coined the<br/>
term &quot;unschooling.&quot;  A limited number of copies of the video are available<br/>
from FUN Books.<br/>
<br/>
The conference will feature dozens of great workshops and a resource fair<br/>
with a variety of new and used materials.<br/>

<br/>
Be sure to share this information with any new homeschoolers you know as<br/>
well as veteran homeschoolers. This conference will appeal to both and will<br/>
also include workshops for families with younger children as well as those<br/>
with teens.<br/>
