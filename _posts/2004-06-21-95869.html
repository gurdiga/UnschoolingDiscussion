<div id="ygrps-yiv-796528389">I have created a new yahoolist/yahoogroup called<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ThinkAndLearn@yahoogroups.com">ThinkAndLearn@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; and you are invited to join it.<br/>
<br/>
   On this new list, I will offer questions to think about, people can<br/>
spend some time thinking about them on their own or with friends and<br/>
relatives, and I will post explanations/answers a few days later.<br/>
<br/>
   This group is for people who like to learn - think it is fun to take<br/>
on a challenge - and who like puzzles or trivia questions or just to<br/>
learn something new about all kinds of subjects.<br/>
<br/>
   The point of the questions is always to stimulate our thinking and to<br/>
have fun and learn something in the process.<br/>
<br/>
    If you have a question and answer/explanation you&#39;d like to pose to<br/>
the group, send it to me directly at:<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ThinkAndLearn-owner@yahoogroups.com">ThinkAndLearn-owner@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; .<br/>
<br/>
My goal will be to have a wide variety of questions and <br/>
answers/explanations so<br/>
I welcome your submissions. Questions can be very brief or fairly<br/>
detailed, answers can be short or long, but the goal is for them to be<br/>
reasonably &quot;accessible&quot; to most people. Sometimes the questions may<br/>
seem too simple to you and other times might go right over your head -<br/>
that&#39;s okay, I hope there will be something fun and challenging for<br/>
everybody.<br/>
<br/>
This will not be a place for online discussion, but just for the<br/>
questions and answers/explanations to be posted. You can talk about them<br/>
with other people, of course, and it might be fun to<br/>
think about them as a family, maybe at the dinner table or in the car.<br/>
Posting will happen whenever I have something to post - could be<br/>
multiple questions in one day or only one question in a week, depending<br/>
on what my schedule is like and if other people have sent me questions<br/>
to use.<br/>
<br/>
