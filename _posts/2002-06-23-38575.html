&gt;Oh that would be SO COOL!!!  It might serve to make him just want to use the<br/>
&gt;potty, too, if you make a list of things you think would be neat for him to<br/>
&gt;pee in.  <br/>

&gt;&quot;A HAT!  You&#39;ve never done it in a hat before.  Here&#39;s one!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!! I love the idea of partnership as opposed to the adversarial stuff we<br/>
parents can get caught up in.<br/>
<br/>
We can turn almost anything into a power struggle. Hmmm... would it work<br/>
with junk food?  &quot; You can&#39;t have your spinach until you finish every cookie<br/>
on that plate!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Cassidy once asked me &quot;Mom, are you using reverse psychology on me?&quot; Now, we<br/>
never had any psycology lessons at our house -- where did he learn that?<br/>
<br/>
And speaking of constipation & oversharing ... I could add another benefit<br/>
of medical marijuana, but it&#39;s illegal (sigh).<br/>
