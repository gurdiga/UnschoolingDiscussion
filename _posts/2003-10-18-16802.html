Pawlenty pitches paying &#39;super teachers&#39; up to $100,000<br/>
      James Walsh, Star Tribune <br/>
     <br/>
      Published October 2, 2003 SUPE02 <br/>
<br/>
Will paying &quot;super teachers&quot; as much as $100,000 a year at the state&#39;s most challenged schools make students learn better? Will making it easier for educated professionals to become teachers do the trick? Gov. Tim Pawlenty, in a multipronged initiative announced Wednesday, said he is willing to give it a go.<br/>
<br/>
Minnesota students still are among the tops in the country on test scores, but the achievement gap between black and white students is among the widest. Pawlenty said more must be done.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have to try something,&quot; he said. &quot;Right now, we have school sites that are failing. And it&#39;s not the teachers&#39; fault and it&#39;s not the principals&#39; fault. But those are the outcomes, and they&#39;re failing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The governor&#39;s plan would pump millions in additional money into a handful of pilot projects around the state to see if basing teachers&#39; pay on their students&#39; performance pays off.<br/>
<br/>
The first and perhaps most dramatic part of the plan would be to create &quot;super teachers&quot; at five Minnesota schools.<br/>
<br/>
Principals of those schools would have sweeping authority to recruit, hire and fire teachers outside of normal union contracts and tenure rules, Pawlenty said. In exchange, teachers at those schools would be eligible for bonuses of $20,000 to $40,000, based on their performance and student achievement. The program, which would cost $2.5 million to $5 million in new funding per year, would target those schools that serve large numbers of disadvantaged students and have struggled to raise test scores.<br/>
<br/>
Under this program, Pawlenty said, &quot;All the rules are off as to who&#39;s working there. And in exchange for your coming, you have a shot to make $100,000.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pawlenty said he recognizes that parents play the biggest role in student achievement and that many struggling schools suffer from high student poverty and low parental involvement. But teachers play the next biggest part in student achievement, he said.<br/>
<br/>
By creating the five &quot;super teacher&quot; sites, schools can attract the sharpest teachers to work with the most struggling students. Schools with poor outcomes are working to improve, he said, &quot;But they&#39;re nibbling around the edges and not making a big difference.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When asked if he thought teachers unions might oppose giving principals the authority to essentially start from scratch at those schools, Pawlenty said, &quot;This is a way to demonstrate whether by paying teachers more -- in some cases dramatically more -- that we can retain the best and the brightest to benefit children. How could you be opposed to that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Money and more <br/>
<br/>
Other aspects of the initiative:<br/>
<br/>
. Attract new teachers. Make it easier for professionals from other fields, particularly math and science, to get into teaching. The state Department of Education would create an alternate licensing program to streamline and shorten the training period that educated professionals would need to enter the classroom. The department would have the power to accredit alternate training programs. Officials said the state also will begin issuing report cards on how well private and public universities train teachers for the classroom.<br/>
<br/>
. Retain good teachers. Establish a new pay-for-performance program at seven pilot schools that would reward teachers with bonuses based on increased student achievement. The state would use $7.8 million in federal grant money to fund this program, as well as create an online database of lesson plans for teachers and develop a mentor program to support new teachers. The plan would also guarantee that teachers are assigned to classrooms before the start of the school year and prohibit interschool transfers during the year.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;super teachers&quot; and pay-for-performance pilot projects would be in addition to a current alternative compensation pilot program at five sites around the state. Education Commissioner Cheri Pierson Yecke said having three different projects going at 17 sites across Minnesota will give officials the kind of data they need to study how compensation affects student performance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It will be a good, rich pool for evaluation,&quot; Yecke said.<br/>
<br/>
But state Rep. Mindy Greiling, DFL-Roseville, called the money for alternative compensation &quot;chump change&quot; when compared to the $180 million that was cut from education funding last year.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think it&#39;s trying to camouflage what&#39;s really going on in the schools,&quot; she said, noting that more than 75 Minnesota school districts are proposing excess-levy referendums to make up for state funding they lost in the last legislative session. While Greiling said the &quot;super teacher&quot; program is interesting, there certainly are more than five Minnesota schools facing huge challenges.<br/>
<br/>
Hopes for support <br/>
<br/>
State Rep. Barb Sykora, R-Deephaven, chairwoman of the House education policy committee, said she thinks the Legislature will support the plan as a way to study what really makes a difference for students.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The bottom line is: We&#39;re here to educate kids,&quot; she said. She said she hopes the teachers unions see this as an opportunity for their members to grow.<br/>
<br/>
Judy Schaubach, president of Education Minnesota, said the teachers union shares the governor&#39;s goals of getting more teachers and getting them into the most challenged schools. And they share a desire to improve compensation, she said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But there are a lot of issues that need to be talked through,&quot; she said, including just what it means to be a &quot;super teacher.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And, while getting professionals to become teachers is a good goal, Schaubach said, &quot;We feel strongly that we not lower our standards. We&#39;ll do a disservice to kids if we don&#39;t ensure that teachers have the best preparation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pawlenty said the &quot;super teacher&quot; program, which would be among the first in the nation, will be a bold step toward closing the achievement gap between disadvantaged and minority students and white students in Minnesota. Arguments for increased overall education funding miss the mark, he said. The gap has been widening over the past 10 years, regardless of how much money schools are spending.<br/>
<br/>
He pointed at Minneapolis as an example.<br/>
<br/>
The district, he said, spends more than $10,000 per pupil per year. Yet the district&#39;s four-year graduation rate was 46 percent -- and just 26 percent for black students.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Those outcomes are unacceptable,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
Dave Heistad, director of testing, evaluation and student information for the Minneapolis schools, disputed the governor&#39;s data. Under new federal rules, he said Minneapolis&#39; four-year graduation rate in 2002 was 57 percent -- 78 percent when counting just the students who attend the city&#39;s seven regular high schools.<br/>
<br/>
While the governor said that he understands that the Minneapolis schools cannot control the poverty of their families or the readiness of their new students to learn, focusing funding on results could have a dramatic effect.<br/>
<br/>
If the pilot projects work, Pawlenty said, &quot;I think it opens the door to the whole discussion about how we pay teachers.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412722984">I knew one woman last year who is a 1st grade teacher in Rhode Island.  Being that she worked at a school in the city, there was a good mix of students (spanish, white, african american, etc.).  I remember asking her why she didn&#39;t work in one of the schools in the town she lived in (southern r.i.).  She told me that she likes working in the city because the majority of the students&#39; parents were non-english speaking and didn&#39;t really know their children&#39;s rights in school, i.e. if one of the children needed extra support or services and how to go about obtaining those services.  She said that she does not want to have to deal with parents such as myself who know their children&#39;s rights and would attend iep meetings, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Because the kids in her class spoke english as a second language, they sometime struggled and she would tell me that the work they generated was nothing but garbage.  I just could not believe what I was hearing!  On top of it, she would be surprised when the pricipal would check up on her and the other teachers would complain about her teaching.  She was shocked when letters of reprimand were placed in file.  What is wrong with people?<br/>

Another thing to add to your vision, Paula.  Let&#39;s open up all the buildings called &quot;schools,&quot; rename them &quot;free learning centers&quot; or something to diminish negative associations, and welcome all students, regardless of age.  Let&#39;s see 80-yr.-olds learning alongside 6-yr.-olds in a class led by an 11-yr.-old.  <br/>
<br/>
In addition to having well-paid instructors, let&#39;s have a network of volunteers willing to lead classes in areas of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s open up these buildings 24 hrs./day, 365 days/yr. to community groups.  What a wonderful use of our tax dollars!    <br/>

Funny you should mention Ivan Illich and Deschooling Society, Norma.  I just bought it at a used book store!  My parents were visiting last weekend, and my dad started to read it before I did.  I told him to go ahead and take it home, and I would get it at Thanksgiving.  <br/>
<br/>
He read the book twenty-some years ago as a high school teacher, and now he&#39;s rereading it while teaching a college course for future English teachers.  He just told me today that he may have to reconsider what he&#39;s doing, that preparing people to teach within schools might be an uphill battle.  We&#39;ll see...<br/>

Ivan Illich:  <br/>
<br/>
Ivan Illich on Schools<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what<br/>
the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and<br/>
substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the<br/>
more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation<br/>
leads to success. The pupil is thereby &quot;schooled&quot; to confuse teaching<br/>
with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with<br/>
competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His<br/>
imagination is &quot;schooled&quot; to accept service in place of value.<br/>
Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the<br/>
improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military<br/>
poise for national security, the rat race for productive work.<br/>
Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavour are<br/>
defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which<br/>
claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on<br/>
allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools,<br/>
and other agencies in question.&quot;<br/>

  &lt;&gt;Funny you should mention Ivan Illich and Deschooling Society, <br/>
  Norma.  I just bought it at a used book store!  My parents were <br/>
  visiting last weekend, and my dad started to read it before I did.  I <br/>
  told him to go ahead and take it home, and I would get it at <br/>
  Thanksgiving.  <br/>
<br/>
  He read the book twenty-some years ago as a high school teacher, and <br/>
  now he&#39;s rereading it while teaching a college course for future <br/>
  English teachers.  He just told me today that he may have to <br/>
  reconsider what he&#39;s doing, that preparing people to teach within <br/>
  schools might be an uphill battle.  We&#39;ll see...&lt;&gt;<br/>

  Sounds like he&#39;s given himself a challenge.  Here&#39;s another taste of <br/>
  Ivan Illich:  <br/>
<br/>
  Ivan Illich on Schools<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what<br/>
  the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and<br/>
  substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the<br/>
  more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation<br/>
  leads to success. The pupil is thereby &quot;schooled&quot; to confuse teaching<br/>
  with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with<br/>
  competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His<br/>
  imagination is &quot;schooled&quot; to accept service in place of value.<br/>
  Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the<br/>
  improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military<br/>
  poise for national security, the rat race for productive work.<br/>
  Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavour are<br/>
  defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which<br/>
  claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on<br/>
  allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools,<br/>
  and other agencies in question.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Ivan Illich - Deschooling Society (1973: 9)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24057108">&quot;.... paying teachers $100,000 would make better teachers.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
I know you all have a very sophisticated sense of humor - are you kidding about this?<br/>
 <br/>
Joylyn sounds like a ray of hope in a horrible situation.  If her salary were doubled would that make her a better teacher?  I don&#39;t see how it could.<br/>
 <br/>
Homeschools or public schools are only two options, with lots of things in between.  Paying half our income in taxes makes people think there are no other viable options.  The only moral, non-coercive learning centers are ones which would be paid for by users or charities instead of tax dollars taken by force.  Give back all those tax dollars that are thrown away on inhumane institutions and you&#39;d see lots of new ideas springing up everywhere.  Demand creates supply.  Refunded tax dollars would cover a lot of user fees - enough to defray the cost to families who can&#39;t afford them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Taxpayers have no real say in how the tax dollars are spent; consumers do.  I believe whole heartedly that that&#39;s why public schools are in the condition that they&#39;re in - we are forced to pay for something we have no say about and no real choice in.<br/>
 <br/>
In &quot;Growing Without Schooling&quot; John Holt said that if what teachers do is so valuable they should try leaving the monopoly of the government schools, rent an office, hang out a sign that says, &quot;teacher&quot; and see how many people are willing to pay them tens of thousands of dollars for what they do.  John Holt was a &quot;super teacher&quot; and he left the profession because it was so destructive and because of the futility of trying to improve it. <br/>
We&#39;re all very diligent at non-coercion of our children; I just don&#39;t believe in the government coercing my neighbors to pay for my children&#39;s education or any other choice I make or forcing me to pay for theirs, it&#39;s immoral.<br/>

Great points!  I left teaching because beating one&#39;s head against the <br/>
brick wall of institutionalization hurts, and leaves one with a <br/>
bloody beaten mess sitting on one&#39;s shoulders.  Not my idea of good <br/>
sense.  JTG said the same thing, leaving at his peak, upon receiving <br/>
his New York state teacher of the year award.  This is one <br/>
institution where inertia and all the forces of resistance are really <br/>
set in concrete.  When I left full-time teaching back in the <br/>
seventies I felt we should blow up all the schools and go back to the <br/>
way this country started.  I know that is not realistic, but home <br/>
education, and unschooling in particular, are about as close to that <br/>
as we can easily get.  <br/>
<br/>
As for us paying for our neighbor&#39;s children&#39;s education, well, <br/>
geesh, just look what a great job public schools have been doing with <br/>
all those tax dollars!  Try to find qualified help, for anything.  <br/>
Try to get service from workers, in offices, stores, repair shops.  I <br/>
know several friends who had to close their businesses because they <br/>
could not find adequate qualified help to do the work they had.   The <br/>
problem, as I see it, is that we home educators don&#39;t get out the <br/>
vote enough on this issue.  We could, in some places and some <br/>
elections, turn the vote around and prevent those bond issues or tax <br/>
levies from passing.  But not enough of us get out and vote.  We are <br/>
a viable voting block, if we will but register and vote.  Otherwise <br/>
we are stuck supporting a system from which way too many people are <br/>
making way too much money to be willing to let go without a huge <br/>
fight.  Even when the schools they are supporting are failing <br/>
miserably with plenty of data, data that we all paid for by the way, <br/>
to support that contention.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And you were there voluntarily!  Imagine those poor, powerless children, it must be like being in prison.  <br/>
 <br/>
My 15yo tells me about once a week how happy he is to be out of that &quot;prison.&quot;  He sleeps in while his friends are in school (also asleep), wakes up and makes coffee, usually starts a discussion with me about what he&#39;s reading or events in the world covering economics, history, civics, etc, he then spends a couple hours teaching himself calculus or programming or whatever or telling the dog he loves her.  Gets himself organized for his day depending on his plans asks me or his dad for whatever he thinks he needs, asks what I&#39;m doing that day, then picks up his buddies after they get released, sometimes bringing them here to shoot pool, play foosball or hang out.<br/>
 <br/>
A young guy in my art class just graduated from the local high school.  I asked him how he tolerated it, he said he hated it, hated every minute of it for four years.  The young people in the class are generally lethargic and have to be herded and spoon fed, and it&#39;s an art class.  I wonder where they learned that???<br/>

<br/>
This is why we&#39;ve done something as radical as throw in our lot with the Free State Project.  Coincidentally, New Hampshire is having an education funding crisis right now.  Their state supreme court ruled that the property tax funding method is illegal, they have no state income or sales tax and NHer&#39;s are violently opposed to new taxes.  It is ripe for an education revolution, although I don&#39;t hold any hope for success anytime soon.  We just feel we must take some action and make a stand, so we&#39;ve agreed to relocate to NH along with 20k other liberty lovers.<br/>
