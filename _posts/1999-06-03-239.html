always knew he would have to pulled out by 3rd grade cus he would need more<br/>
then they could give him. A good friend hsed so I knew alot about it and I<br/>
was pro hs for many years. Making the decision was hard, hard to convince<br/>
my partner. It took Isaac about 3 mo of boredom and tv to deschool. we do<br/>
use some workbooks and there are times I &quot;make&quot; him do some but not too<br/>
often.<br/>

Good for you, Andi! I had stomachaches all through school. They never went <br/>
away.<br/>
The STRESS!! My 8 y.o. liked kindergarten for about 3 months, then she <br/>
started <br/>
&quot;complaining&quot; in the morning about still being tired. In first grade, the <br/>
&quot;crying&quot; started. My mornings went something like this:<br/>
&quot;Michelle, what&#39;s wrong honey?&quot;<br/>
&quot;Nothing&quot;. <br/>
&quot;Why are you crying?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t you like school honey?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I guess so&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Well, hurry up and get dressed, you don&#39;t want to be late&quot;.<br/>
This was like an everyday thing. I finally set her free in Feb. Now she <br/>
sleeps in till 8 or 9, sometimes gets dressed and never cries in the morning <br/>
anymore(smile).<br/>

more fights about going place. we plan time otgether, he knows what we have<br/>
to do , what i have to do and he gets to chose some of what he wants to do.<br/>
I like it this way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1676405870">I just found a post I want to comment on so I decided to write my<br/>
intro first.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Cindy, married to Rob.  We have two children, Megan age 4 and<br/>
Alex age 1.83333...  I have a grown child from my first marriage,<br/>
Justin.  He&#39;s 24 and did/is still doing the traditional school<br/>
thing -- he&#39;s a grad student at UC Santa Cruz working on his Ph. D.<br/>
in astronomy.  He&#39;s been interested in astronomy since he was 4 BTW.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t like the way schools were when Justin was in school and they&#39;ve<br/>
gotten worse since then.  Rob and I had some long discussions about<br/>
what we wanted for Megan and Alex.  We both independently reached<br/>
the conclusion that we would homeschool them.  Then I learned about<br/>
unschooling and realized that was how we would live our life!<br/>
<br/>
I would say I am a complete unschooler with bouts of anxiety from<br/>
time to time.  I have unschooled both Megan and Alex since birth.<br/>
I also realize that I sort of unschooled Justin in that I (and his <br/>
father) supported his outside-of-school interests.  <br/>
<br/>
I live in Sunnyvale, CA.  <br/>
<br/>
Megan currently attends a coop preschool.  I had some doubts about <br/>
this last fall.  She is very happy there; the program is very <br/>
unstructured.  It&#39;s more like a park day with art projects, dress up<br/>
clothes and music activities too.  We will be continuing that for<br/>
next year for her and probably for Alex too when he&#39;s old enough. <br/>
The main reason I utilize it is that I have had difficulty<br/>
finding a good support group with younger children involved.  We <br/>
went to one last summer but Megan ended playing with other children <br/>
in the park rather than the homeschool group.  I couldn&#39;t justify<br/>
interrupting Alex&#39;s naptime when we could just go to the park at<br/>
any old time and get similar results!  What do others do for social<br/>
activities with young ones?<br/>

Most of the social activities that my kids have are with each other, and<br/>
when we make trips to town.  Then occasionally we get together with<br/>
friends.  Even  more occasionally, we get together with a group of kids.<br/>
I like the kids to be friends with themselves and their family first.<br/>
BTW, my kids are 6, 4, and 3.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619188170">Having jumped in and offerred my opinion on college admission, I suppose I <br/>
ought to take a minute and introduce myself...BG<br/>
<br/>
Our family includes 2 &#39;children&#39;, boys, ages 10 and 21.  Along the way we <br/>
have added a daughter in law and a grand-daughter.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son started home education in the middle of his eigth grade year.  <br/>
The final straw was frustration over the school interfering in our home <br/>
schedule...hubby worked out of town at the time and we wanted to take a long <br/>
weekend and go visit him instead of waiting for him to get away to see us.  <br/>
The school, in their infinite wisdom, didn&#39;t think that was an appropriate <br/>
reason to miss a day of school and informed us that if he wasn&#39;t in school he <br/>
would not be allowed to make up any work and would automatically fail all <br/>
classes.  So, we took back the reigns of his education and have never <br/>
regretted it.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest boy has never been to public school, except to support cousins <br/>
by attending concerts and such.  I don&#39;t anticipate that changing.  We are <br/>
very happy with our decision to educate at home.  <br/>
<br/>
We used more unschooling than anything regulated with the oldest.  It was a <br/>
bit nerve wracking and I had to keep checking my gut to be sure it was the <br/>
right decision for us.  It was often hard to see that any learning was <br/>
actually happening.  Then the rascal decided to pass his GED on the first try <br/>
with no studying and having not participated in any sort of &#39;educational&#39; <br/>
activity for over 2 years.  So, now I&#39;m much more comfortable with it.<br/>
<br/>
Still, there are days that I get compulsive or have friends/family members <br/>
question what I&#39;m doing and why.  So, I thought I&#39;d try hanging out with some <br/>
people that understand.  <br/>

I&#39;d use my nick name to help avoid confusion ;-)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021053226">i just wanted to take a few minutes to introduce myself.  i&#39;m dawn h-s, i<br/>
eschew the cap key, stink at spelling, rarely have time topoofread my<br/>
posts, and teach college level writing as my main money earning occupation<br/>
(as pitiful as the money is).  I also love parenthetical asides.<br/>
<br/>
my main occupation and passion is raising my boyz.  one, N, will be 7 in<br/>
december, and the other, A, was 4 a few weeks ago.  although i teach as a<br/>
profession, hold a teaching certificate, and am even teaching a course<br/>
full of honors education majors *in* the building that houses the college<br/>
of education at the uni where I teach, we are unschoolers, and for good<br/>
reason;)  i know from whence i speak.  although i&#39;ve not always know i<br/>
would unschool my kids (actually, I geuss they unschool themselves), i<br/>
have known from way before even *having* children that i would hs.  i was<br/>
schooled-at-home for a while way, way, way back when--even before holt<br/>
started writing about it (in fact, on of my hs&#39;ing assignments was<br/>
watching nixon resign, if i remember correctly).<br/>
<br/>
what else?  i started doing year-end assessments for some area hs&#39;ers this<br/>
past fall.  a very enjoyable experience, and i learned a lot doing it.<br/>
between that and being an advisor for a homeschooler 4-H club, i&#39;m<br/>
starting to feel like i&#39;m &quot;with it&quot; wrt other homeschoolers in our area,<br/>
albeit they are mostly quite structured, which is nice.  my older son is<br/>
fortunate in that his closest friends are all hs&#39;ed from the start,<br/>
relationships the developed out of attending LLL when our kids were<br/>
babies.  he has only recenlty made a close friend who goes to school.  he<br/>
frequenlty comments on how school interferes with that friendship:/  never<br/>
once has he asked to go to school to spend more time with his friend.<br/>
<br/>
my ohter son generally dislikes most kids and prefers to go off and play<br/>
with playmobile or dig in dirt byhimself (today he spent 2 hours &quot;working&quot;<br/>
on dirt removal at the park--whatever).<br/>
<br/>
this list came highly recommended.  and i&#39;ve enjoyed what i&#39;ve seen of it.<br/>

&gt; Hi  everyone!  My name is Susan , single mom to  Matthew  (almost 4yo).<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for months now  and decided to come out<br/>
&gt; of hiding. I guess what made me decide to come out of lurkdom is   that<br/>
&gt; you all sound so knowledgeable,  or at least have had some experiences<br/>
&gt; that I too have had. The whole &quot;  stalking &quot;  conversation really hit<br/>
&gt; home , as well as the varied views on holiday customs.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t really want to get off the unschooling topic,  but I&#39;ve had a<br/>
&gt; situation here that really has me down, and I&#39;m hoping that maybe some<br/>
&gt; of you will have some words of wisdom for me.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve recently gone thru a court battle with my son&#39;s father.  He wanted<br/>
&gt; visitation, I wanted child support.  During the whole process with him ,<br/>
&gt; my overbearing mother jumped on the bandwagon and sued for grandparents<br/>
&gt; rights.  To make a long story short,  I got my little bit of child<br/>
&gt; support (very little),  he got joint custody, changing my son&#39;s last<br/>
&gt; name to his, gets visitation every weekend,  and my controlling mother<br/>
&gt; gets him all day, one day a week.  My lawyer didn&#39;t bother to show up to<br/>
&gt; represent me ( my third one , I might add).<br/>
&gt; Now my problem isn&#39;t really with the dad, but with the domineering<br/>
&gt; mother.  No lawyer will give me advice on how to divorce a parent,  the<br/>
&gt; statute of limitations on child abuse and neglect, etc.  I just want to<br/>
&gt; raise my son in peace and this woman will not stop interfering in my<br/>
&gt; life !!!  I know that when she finds out that my son will be unschooled<br/>
&gt; , she&#39;s not only gonna hit the roof,  but she will get a court order to<br/>
&gt; try and foce me to put him in school.  The same with my religious<br/>
&gt; beliefs,  she won&#39;t respect the way I choose to raise my child, and is<br/>
&gt; trying to force her beliefs down my son&#39;s neck on her day of visitation.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really sorry this is such a long post. If anyone has any good advice<br/>
&gt; for me , please email me privately, so as not to tie up the list.<br/>
&gt; Thanks for listening, Susan<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Susan, start saving, and get a good lawyer.  Period, a good lawyer is worth <br/>
his weight in gold.  Also, you may want to refrain from using the word <br/>
homeschool in front of your 4 yo, just mention that he will be attending <br/>
private school.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d appeal to the court requesting that the day of visitation be <br/>
changed to a weekend day.  So she doesn&#39;t go any near a school.  If I <br/>
couldn&#39;t file a request to have her stop teaching religious beliefs contrary <br/>
to your beliefs.<br/>

Ack, I&#39;m so bad I didn&#39;t finish this.  The first Monday in October is an <br/>
interesting date in US Government.  On that day the Supreme Court begins <br/>
reviewing the cases it&#39;s accepted.  One of the cases up for review this year <br/>
is the issue of Grandparents rights.<br/>
<br/>
Might be an issue you&#39;d want to keep an eye on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134345212">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Sara Johnson & I am new to this list.  I am 30 & married with 2 <br/>
children.  My son is 6 & my daughter is 3.5.  We&#39;re really just winging it & <br/>
don&#39;t have a lot of support or connections around homeschooling yet so <br/>
that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for--inspiration, encouragement & answers to my <br/>
questions from people who&#39;ve been there. I&#39;ve been with my kids from the <br/>
beginning.  My daughter is still nursing.  I work part time giving care to a <br/>
quadripeligic & my children come with me.  I am also a Raw Food Chef.  My <br/>
interests include learning how to achieve vibrant health, working out, <br/>
making collages, playing games & sometimes movies.  I look forward to <br/>
getting acquainted with you all.<br/>
<br/>
