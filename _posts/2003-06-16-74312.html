<div id="ygrps-yiv-675386002">Hi,<br/>
  Sorry about that.<br/>
  I was right in the middle of composing when....whoosh......my mail was <br/>
sent.<br/>
  My post was a quote from a site about Aspergers.  The clueless husband and <br/>
socially awkward son just reminded me of that.  But then, I read a lot about <br/>
autism, so it jumps readily to mind.<br/>
