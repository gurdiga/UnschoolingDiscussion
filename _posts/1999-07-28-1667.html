I know what you mean, we really enjoyed the Viz Caya.  It was so beautiful, <br/>
and being on the grounds of the estate made it even more so.  The boys sat, <br/>
SAT for 3 hours watching all the dramatics.  They bring people over from <br/>
Italy to do this.  Really neat, we had even thought about becoming members of <br/>
the Miami Renaissance Society, but it would just involve to much night time <br/>
activity in Miami, and we don&#39;t go there!!!  LOL I think the site I sent <br/>
shows some of the grounds, not sure, but you would love it, it is right on <br/>
the water, with docks and patio running down to and into the water.  Gorgeous!<br/>
