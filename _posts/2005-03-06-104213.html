<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900967696">I enjoyed your pictures of your kids, Sandra.  I especially liked Cameron&#39;s<br/>
hair.  It suits him so well.  I like long hair on guys.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m the only mom in my circle here in Houston (that I&#39;ve discussed<br/>
this with, anyway) who has encouraged her son to grow long hair and a<br/>
goatee.  Liam would look so good like that, but he keeps his hair buzzed.<br/>
At least he&#39;s finally growing a goatee.  I&#39;m happy.  He&#39;s happy.  It&#39;s all<br/>
good.<br/>

Those who&#39;ve seen Marty at conferences probably saw him bald to baldish,<br/>
but<br/>
in that photo he has hair! &lt;g&gt;  He kept his head shaved for three  years or<br/>
so, and it&#39;s nice to see it grown out some.  It&#39;s curly in the  back!  We<br/>
didn&#39;t expect that.<br/>

Cameron&#39;s not mine, but I like his hair too.  His parents are Kelly  and Ben <br/>
Lovejoy, in SC.<br/>
There&#39;s a photo of Kirby with long hair at _<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/kirby_">http://sandradodd.com/kirby_</a> <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/kirby)">http://sandradodd.com/kirby)</a> , but his hair  is shorter now, like an inch and a <br/>
half or two and fluffy (nice, thick  hair).<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad for the ability to put photos up in public sometimes.  It&#39;s  cool.<br/>
