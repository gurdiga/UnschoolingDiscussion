&lt;&lt; *But* long time posters to this list tend to be people who love words and<br/>
<br/>
recognize how important it is to use them accurately. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday morning Holly said out of the blue &quot;You know what I wish?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you wish?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I wish that every person knew the meaning of every word they ever used.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A wave of &#39;Wow, that WOULD be cool!&#39; washed over me.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out what she really was thinking of was etymology.  That if we <br/>
understood immediately what the basis of each word was we would understand them more <br/>
clearly and use them better and not have to learn useages.  (She didn&#39;t have <br/>
those terms, but that&#39;s what came out of it on examination.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s that Lewis Carroll bit about words meaning precisely what I want them <br/>
to mean?  One of the characters from Alice in/through wherever?  Maybe someone <br/>
knows a phrase to find it online.  I need to go start breakfast for the <br/>
balloon-fiesta returnees.<br/>

`When I use a word,&#39; Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, `it <br/>
means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
`The question is,&#39; said Alice, `whether you can make words mean so many <br/>
different things.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
`The question is,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master - - that&#39;s all.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute Humpty Dumpty <br/>
began again. `They&#39;ve a temper, some of them -- particularly verbs, they&#39;re <br/>
the proudest -- adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs -- <br/>
however, I can manage the whole of them! Impenetrability! That&#39;s what I say!&#39;<br/>
<br/>
`Would you tell me, please,&#39; said Alice `what that means?`<br/>
<br/>
`Now you talk like a reasonable child,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty, looking very <br/>
much pleased. `I meant by &quot;impenetrability&quot; that we&#39;ve had enough of that <br/>
subject, and it would be just as well if you&#39;d mention what you mean to do <br/>
next, as I suppose you don&#39;t mean to stop here all the rest of your life.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
`That&#39;s a great deal to make one word mean,&#39; Alice said in a thoughtful tone.<br/>
<br/>
`When I make a word do a lot of work like that,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty, `I <br/>
always pay it extra.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
`Oh!&#39; said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other remark.<br/>
<br/>
`Ah, you should see `em come round me of a Saturday night,&#39; Humpty Dumpty <br/>
went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: `for to get their <br/>
wages, you know.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more.<br/>
