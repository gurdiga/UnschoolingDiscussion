&lt;&lt;Holly was asked what she wanted to be when she grew up and was being fed <br/>

Whenever people ask my 5yo what she wants to be when she grows up, she gets <br/>
the question confused with Halloween.  The questioner always looks shocked when <br/>
she answers a vampire or a bunny or a princess!!!<br/>
