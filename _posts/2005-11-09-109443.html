<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393269030">One tiny request, in general.<br/>
 <br/>
Please break your writing up into paragraphs.  Two taps of the enter  key <br/>
between thoughts would help me read your posts, even if the English teacher  in <br/>
your head would disapprove of their placement.  I pretty much skip every  post <br/>
that doesn&#39;t have paragraphs breaks.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only  one.  And <br/>
since there are several people posting now that haven&#39;t used  paragraph breaks, I <br/>
thought it would be appropriate to make this request.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for your consideration,<br/>
Karen<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659641653">Hi Karen <br/>
<br/>
I would be one of the non spacing posters. I am sorry, I didn&#39;t even <br/>
realize, just got caught up in my thoughts and kept on going.  You are <br/>
right though it does seem to make the posts easier to read.  See I <br/>
learn something new here every day. And by the way I thought about <br/>
hitting enter after each line here but decided not to try and get a <br/>
rise or a laugh out of anyone. &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>
