Is your Mom around a lot?<br/>
<br/>
Nodding and smiling at people who are wrong but don&#39;t want to learn, has been <br/>
helpful to me.  <br/>

You are doing the right thing and are a good mother.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082898638">Lisa,  What about giving your mother some literature about <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling?  With so many wonderful books, and so many success <br/>
stories maybe she could see for herself that you have your children&#39;s best <br/>
interest at heart.  It sounds like she is afraid of something different than <br/>
educating the &quot;traditional&quot; way; maybe her fear is coming out to you as being <br/>
closed minded and judgmental.  Also, if she lives close to you, invite her to <br/>
come and be a part of your day from time to time; maybe she could take part <br/>
in sharing something specific with your children- a special skill or talent.  <br/>
Let her see that there is nothing to be concerned about.  Let her know about <br/>
local homeschooling events and conferences and playgroups and co-ops that are <br/>
available.  (We recently participated in a science/art fair.  Both sets of <br/>
grandparents came to see.)  If, after everything, she continues to put you <br/>
down, I think you have every right to calmly, yet firmly, state that she does <br/>
not have to agree with you, but she does have to accept your decision, and <br/>
that maybe it would be best to agree to disagree, and let it drop for awhile. <br/>
I would also maintain that in no circumstance would it be acceptable to put <br/>
down homeschooling in front of your children. Chances are, especially if you <br/>
maintain a confident approach with her, she will come around.  Just stay <br/>
enthusiastic about what your kids are doing-- and she will catch on that this <br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; is a really good idea, afterall!                                <br/>
                    Best of Luck to you!                                        <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831967241">Hi Lisa,<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what kind of relationship ypu have with your mom overall, but<br/>
would it be possible for you to ask her not to share her critisims with you?<br/>
I know my parents also have concerns, but not having to defend myself to her<br/>
does make thiings easier on a day to day basis. I also try to constantly<br/>
point out the benefits of hs to her. Someone recently told me that there is<br/>
a new book for grandparents of hs kids. I don&#39;t  any details about it but it<br/>
might help.<br/>
Good Luck.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Advice Needed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Hi, my name is Lisa and I have been homeschooling my children since<br/>
&gt; January. I have no support for homeschooling on my side of the family<br/>
&gt; except my husband (whose idea it orginally was to hs)and my children<br/>
&gt; who are totally all for it. I love having my children home with me<br/>
&gt; all day long and enjoy being with them. I just started the<br/>
&gt; unschooling approach about a month or two ago. I love it and so do<br/>
&gt; the children! I would never send them back to ps again unless the<br/>
&gt; children insisted that they wanted to go. But, I don&#39;t think that<br/>
&gt; will happen anytime soon! Anyway my problem is my mom. She just<br/>
&gt; totally opposes the idea of homeschooling especially unschooling. I<br/>
&gt; tried to keep the whole unschooling idea in the closet, hidden from<br/>
&gt; her so I wouldn&#39;t have to try to explain the idea behind it all. She<br/>
&gt; is so narrow minded on the subject and argues that the kids &quot;will<br/>
&gt; never learn beyond what I know or what&#39;s around them to know.&quot; I<br/>
&gt; tried to tell her that children will learn in any area that interests<br/>
&gt; them far beyond what I know or can tell them. That I have learned far<br/>
&gt; beyond what she or any public school has taught me. That I went on to<br/>
&gt; learn things in areas that interest me. I know I don&#39;t live my life<br/>
&gt; or raise my children to make her happy but it bothers me when I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have her support. Does anyone know how I could handle this situation<br/>
&gt; better? I get so upset and teary eyed everytime she puts me down for<br/>
&gt; what I feel like is best for my children. Then I start wondering if<br/>
&gt; they won&#39;t learn properly. Will they learn enough by unschooling. Can<br/>
&gt; anyone reassure me of my decision to homeschool?<br/>
&gt; Lisa, whose confused and upset at the moment.<br/>

    I don&#39;t really have any advice for you about your mom, but I can say I <br/>
sympathize.  I have been unschooling my daughter since September, and I have <br/>
not told anyone on my husband&#39;s side!  I am sure of the negative response I <br/>
would get and I don&#39;t want to hear it.  Luckily, they live in Fla. so it <br/>
isn&#39;t too hard to hide although there have been some close calls!  It is very <br/>
hard to live a lie and I hate it.  But you have to understand that my FIL <br/>
hated that I breastfed!  He thought I was being totally selfish not allowing <br/>
anyone else to feed her!  And, when he found out that we were not vaccinating <br/>
my daughter, he told me he would kill me if anything happened to her!  He <br/>
thinks I am a total nut and often talks behind my back to other members of <br/>
the family.  So you can see why I didn&#39;t rush to tell him she&#39;s unschooled!  <br/>
The only thing is, I feel like maybe now we should tell since we are sure <br/>
that she will again be home next year.  I don&#39;t know what to do- either way, <br/>
it stinks.   Jackie</div>

    Thanks for the advice.  I think you are right - there is no reason I HAVE <br/>
to tell the in-laws that we are unschooling.  I guess I needed someone else <br/>
to agree with me.  Thanks!!  Jackie</div>

&lt;&lt; If some people can&#39;t<br/>
 handle some information then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a (real) lie to withold<br/>
 facts from them.  Like we don&#39;t always tell our kids EVERYTHING all the<br/>
 time.  They&#39;re too young or immature to understand some concepts.  So<br/>
 until they are ready/mature-enough they won&#39;t know everything.  If the<br/>
 time comes that the in-laws have indicated their readiness for more<br/>
 knowledge than we will share more with them.  It&#39;s a self-preservation<br/>
 thing.  For all concerned.<br/>

I agree with the above.  (can you believe it?  &lt;wink&gt;) I don&#39;t think that <br/>
withholding some information is dishonest.  My own mother is horrified by the <br/>
whole concept of homeschooling, even school-at-home.  She has settled for <br/>
silent disapproval for the most part.  It&#39;s so thick you can practically see <br/>
it in the air at times.  She would become spastic if she knew that we are <br/>
unschooling!  I think of it kinda like when I puree spinach and put it in the <br/>
kids&#39; meatloaf.  It&#39;s not really a lie - it&#39;s just better for everyone this <br/>
way.  I know I could handle her attitude if she knew, but the kids shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have to face her disapproval, be it silent or outspoken.  <br/>
