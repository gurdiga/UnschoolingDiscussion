&lt;&lt; Now I am more thirsty than<br/>
 ever, because for the first time in years I recognize my body&#39;s thirst<br/>
 signals, whereas before I was shut down to even knowing when I was thirsty<br/>
 or I would just plain ignore the  signals. &gt;&gt;<br/>
I haven&#39;t read it but I have been increasing my water intake.... I thought I <br/>
was a woman of little sweat.... In reality it was because I was dehydrated! <br/>
Who knew???<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555623310">I just spent a VERY unpleasant day in the hospital yesterday having a kidney <br/>
stone removed.  The one best way to avoid this is WATER.  I will be highly <br/>
motivated to drink enough every day of my life from now on.  In fact I&#39;m <br/>
having to control myself from telling everyone I see, stranger or friend, to <br/>
drink.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
My dd resists drinking enough water and this has been a very personal study <br/>
on it&#39;s importance to the body.  It effects brain function, skin health (best <br/>
remedy for blemishes), digestion and even helps your body feel warmer.  I <br/>
know the list goes on.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve heard that women, especially, tend not to drink enough water because <br/>
 they&#39;re busy taking care of other people, and that they also don&#39;t urinate <br/>
 often enough, because theyr&#39;e taking care of other people, and so mothers <br/>
 (the more motherly) tend toward urinary tract infections and bladder and <br/>
 kidney problems just because they allow that system to sludge up.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought that I drank enough water but found out that I don&#39;t.  Actually the <br/>
2 litres mentions doesn&#39;t sound like too much to me.  My goal is to drink at <br/>
least two quarts a day, is that about the same?  I&#39;m metrically imparied!<br/>
