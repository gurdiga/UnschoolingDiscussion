be spent on more programmed teaching programs where the teacher reads from the <br/>
manual and no creativity is involved.   Oh!   Then they can hire all cheaper <br/>
teachers too.   Minimum wage, and dispense with all that &quot;master teacher <br/>
program&quot; crap, because in fact the better the teacher, the less likely she will be <br/>
to go along with the new order of education and will have to be disposed of to <br/>
keep the peace.<br/>

Soon the American myth that all are created equal can be a reality.<br/>

Unschoolers can&#39;t, though.   I guess we&#39;ll have tobe rounded up and locked <br/>
away for individuality and creativity.<br/>
