Well, now you&#39;ve got my curiosity up. :-)<br/>
Is this something you &quot;practice&quot; at home, by yourself, or do you go to a VEGA practitioner?<br/>
Is there another similar method used by doctors in N. America today, but just named differently than VEGA or &#39;functional medicine&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
After reading the following quote from the site you posted, VEGA seems very unattainable to the general public in N. America, but here you are using it. Is that what they mean by &quot;alternative instrumentation&quot;? Could you elaborate a little about this? I&#39;m not understanding it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Quote from the site:<br/>
&quot;To date VEGA continues with their campaign of slander against the Institute, and have done little to reestablish support for existing VEGA practitioners in North America. Fortunately alternative instrumentation is available that meets all the industry standards, AND is less expensive!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My vega practicioner we use is in Canada. She&#39;s been doing this for <br/>
almost 20 years and has studied with the inventer (Dr. Schimmel) and they <br/>
confer often on bringing Vega to its full potential. Using it to <br/>
determine implications on a cellular level in addition to just using it <br/>
for allergy testing.<br/>
<br/>
The Occidental Institute which held the patent for the Vega offered <br/>
classes, so suffice it to say, most of the NA practicioners are in Canada.<br/>
<br/>
I am not familiar withthe BioSet, although she most likely is. And Vega <br/>
is extremely more advanced than Applied Kinesiology (muscle testing).<br/>
<br/>
Working on the body&#39;s priority system is the main crux of the diagnosing. <br/>
And then giving the body what it asks for allows for the body to begin <br/>
mending itself.<br/>
<br/>
Because of her allopathic medical background and her degrees in chinese <br/>
medicine and homotoxicology, she&#39;s very open to put up almost anything to <br/>
test out and see if it works. So everything is up for testing regardless <br/>
of which medical beleif system manufacturered it. This is, in my opinion, <br/>
the best of all worlds.<br/>
<br/>
I was not her best patient, until recently. Now I follow my body&#39;s advice <br/>
and I don&#39;t take the signs for granted. <br/>
<br/>
There have been very few vaccinations that test up. The tetanus one from <br/>
a company called Connaught tests fine on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
In the mid-80s I did endeavor to learn the machine myself, but since find <br/>
the &#39;disorder control&#39; is the hardest part.. well, I never made it past <br/>
that. So luckily I have her.<br/>
<br/>
It is an absolutely fascinating aspect of medicine and there was a book <br/>
called &#39;21st Century Medicine&#39; that detailed for the layman the uses of <br/>
resonation and medicine.<br/>
