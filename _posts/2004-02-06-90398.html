  Well, not four hours later, Holly and a friend are upstairs playing with <br/>
  those castle blocks.<br/>
<br/>
  Marty and I had dumped them and I washed the plastic box we keep them in (way <br/>
  dusty, from sitting on a shelf for six months or more), separated all the <br/>
  pieces and put them back in the box.  Without any proper strewing strategy, I <br/>
  just put them on a table I passed by thinking I would do something thoughtful.  <br/>
  TOO LATE!  Holly and Meggan are making castles.  <br/>

  Cool!<br/>

&lt;&lt; The fourth group are what the first group distainfully calls &quot;eclectic<br/>
<br/>
homeschoolers&quot; or &quot;posers.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Eclectic&quot; was a term taken on by some people who liked unschooling but <br/>
couldn&#39;t really live there.  It wasn&#39;t a term put upon them by unschoolers.  That <br/>
term was first used, I think, by a group at AOL&#39;s Homefront Hall, on the <br/>
homeschooling boards.<br/>
<br/>
The only &quot;poser&quot; statement I&#39;ve ever heard was lately when someone who <br/>
claimed to be a veteran unschooler (not on this list) made statements only someone <br/>
who didn&#39;t really get unschooling could have made.  Someone used that term in <br/>
questioning her veracity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The fourth group are what the first group distainfully calls &quot;eclectic<br/>
<br/>
homeschoolers&quot; or &quot;posers.&quot; They are usually people who like the idea<br/>
<br/>
of unschooling and want to adopt it, but because they have not yet<br/>
<br/>
shifted their educational paradigm, have not made the leap from<br/>
<br/>
another method to further down the unschooling continuum.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The self-styled eclectics were not intending to move further into <br/>
unschooling.  They had already settled happily with a kind of assortment-pack of <br/>
materials and styles, and seemed quite content!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The third group are Holt/Gatto devotees. They tend toward &quot;life<br/>
<br/>
experiences&quot; and the library rather than television.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where&#39;ve you come across this group?  Some of the people on this list might <br/>
like to read all that.  Is there a hangout you can refer them to?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The first group are on one end of the spectrum. They believe that<br/>
<br/>
there is no separation of &quot;unschooling&quot; from any other part of life,<br/>
<br/>
except that anyone placing any boundaries on anything, and anyone who<br/>
<br/>
uses textbooks/workbooks, cannot be an &quot;unschooler.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing by &quot;uses textbooks/workbooks&quot; you mean &quot;uses&quot; in a schoolish <br/>
sense?   Assignements or at least the hope/promise that they contain information <br/>
arranged in so valuable a way that children will do well to have them?<br/>
<br/>
My kids have workbooks and have &quot;used them&quot; the same way they use coloring <br/>
books and crossword puzzles, and that doesn&#39;t disqualify them as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-except that anyone placing any boundaries on anything. . . cannot be an <br/>
&quot;unschooler.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
We have boundaries on lots of things.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wouldn&#39;t get in the van and drive to Colorado, but if he went somewhere <br/>
in Albuquerque without us knowing in advance, that wouldn&#39;t be a problem.<br/>
Marty wouldn&#39;t clear out every change-stash and wallet in the house, but if <br/>
he got $5 from one of those sources and left a note or told us later, nobody <br/>
would care a bit.<br/>
Holly can stay up as late as she wants, but she stays in the house and she <br/>
stays quiet.<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of people have you come across who had no boundaries?  That&#39;s just <br/>
not right or healthy.<br/>
<br/>
I think just about all unschoolers, and eclectics, and relaxed homeschoolers <br/>
are Holt and Gatto fans.<br/>

Seems mean to call them posers, since they are just as<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The use or non-use of text/workbooks is irrelevant. Book worship, though, is <br/>
a problem.<br/>
<br/>
The far end of the spectrum, though----the radical unschoolers---are the loud <br/>
ones here. I would fall into this &quot;radical unschooler group&quot;: the unschooling <br/>
philosophy permeates our lives. ALL learning is valuable and is equal. We <br/>
make connections throughout our lives and we never stop learning. We immerse <br/>
ourselves in passions and wonder.  <br/>
<br/>
Boundaries on learning? On living? On what?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
To me, these are the folks that unschool in the &quot;educational&quot; part of their <br/>
lives *only*. Given time and support and ideas, they can, and often do, allow <br/>
it to leak into the rest of their lives and learn to enjoy their children and <br/>
their lives more.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get this group at all! I&#39;d put the &quot;Holt/Gatto devotees&quot; and life <br/>
experiencers in Group I----but not library over TV! We all have ways we prefer to <br/>
receive our information: for some it&#39;s books; others, TV!<br/>
<br/>
Classical Model? As in the Bauer&#39;s four-year repeat/spiral of info???? That <br/>
wouldn&#39;t follow.  The Classical Method &quot;requires&quot; that certain things be <br/>
learned. That can&#39;t happen with unschooling. Makes no sense----sorry.<br/>
<br/>
School is certainly a viable experience---to 90-something percent of this <br/>
country&#39;s children! Unschoolers just believe that school destroys children&#39;s <br/>
natural curiosity, creativity, and intelligence.<br/>

<br/>
Eclectics tend to be happy where they are. They have no desire to make the <br/>
shift. And they don&#39;t believe that &quot;natural learning&quot; of everything is possible. <br/>
Therefore, the &quot;eclectic&quot;  pick-n-choose curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Posers&quot; would be those that say they unschool &quot;except for math&quot; or &quot;on the <br/>
weekends&quot; or  &quot;after the children finish their schoolwork&quot;.They just want the <br/>
neat LABEL of &quot;unschooler&quot;. They don&#39;t understand natural learning, nor do they <br/>
seem to want to. They like to seem to be &quot;on the cutting edge&quot;, but don&#39;t <br/>
want to *actually* BE there! Too scary.<br/>
<br/>
Two varieties, maybe? &quot;Radicals&quot; and &quot;just the educational part of life&quot; <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve NEVER heard unschoolers here say these things. EVER. And I&#39;ve got  <br/>
to be one of the most radical unschoolers around -- I&#39;ve never heard  <br/>
anybody here say they have no boundaries on anything and I&#39;ve never  <br/>
heard them say that using textbooks/workbooks rules out unschooling.   <br/>
Sandra and I have BOTH told stories of our kids doing workbooks - in  <br/>
the BATHTUB, no less &lt;G&gt;. And I know MANY unschooled kids who wanted to  <br/>
learn something and found textbooks useful to them at some time or  <br/>
another. And to think that we have absolutely no boundaries? Ridiculous  <br/>
- what we have are principles our families live by. What we try to  <br/>
avoid are arbitrary rigid &quot;rules.&quot; If you think that not having  <br/>
arbitrary rigid rules means we have no boundaries, you&#39;re not  <br/>
listening.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The second group are toward the same end as the first--they eschew<br/>
&gt; anything &quot;schoolish,&quot; but may divide some parts of life from<br/>
&gt; &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are people who don&#39;t test, don&#39;t give assignments, and don&#39;t  <br/>
follow a parent-planned and directed curriculum, but do have  <br/>
restrictions on tv, assigned chores, bedtimes, and food requirements.  <br/>
True. I consider them unschoolers, myself, but I also think they  <br/>
haven&#39;t realized the FULL potential of the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The third group are Holt/Gatto devotees. They tend toward &quot;life<br/>
&gt; experiences&quot; and the library rather than television. They tend to<br/>
&gt; believe that not all experiences are created equal (since, were that<br/>
&gt; so, school would be as viable an experience as unschooling), and hence<br/>
&gt; edge (or at least emphasize) the Classical Model in terms of potential<br/>
&gt; content, and unschooling as a method of delivery.<br/>
<br/>
This is just nonsense. Holt and Gatto are VERY different, for one  <br/>
thing, so I&#39;m not sure how someone could be a devotee of both. And how  <br/>
can you say this group tends toward &quot;life experiences&quot; - how on earth  <br/>
does that distinguish them from anybody else? Library versus  <br/>
television? That&#39;s just a barely disguised insult - as if those who  <br/>
watch tv are tending away from libraries? Again - nonsense. All  <br/>
experiences created equal? What does that mean? Getting married is  <br/>
equal to breaking your leg? Learning to read is equal to having toast  <br/>
for breakfast? What? Nobody thinks that. And people using &quot;the  <br/>
Classical Model&quot; aren&#39;t unschooling - they have a fixed curriculum and  <br/>
even if they use a gentle method of guiding the child to learn what is  <br/>
included in that curriculum, you can&#39;t impose a curriculum and unschool  <br/>
at the same time.  Here is a very brief description of what is included  <br/>
in a &quot;Classical Model of Education:&quot;<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
On the first level, which we call the Grammar level, the child learns  <br/>
the basic facts and the fundamental rules. In English, this would  <br/>
include phonics, vocabulary, and spelling rules. In mathematics, the  <br/>
number system, math facts, and measurements. In history, this would  <br/>
include such things as the story part of history, including names,  <br/>
places, and dates.<br/>
<br/>
On the second level, which we call the Logic level, the child learns to  <br/>
comprehend the way these facts fit together. In English, this would  <br/>
include the parts of speech and the construction of sentences. In  <br/>
mathematics, the proofs of algebra or geometry. In history, the reasons  <br/>
for wars, migrations, or inventions.<br/>
<br/>
On the third level, which we call the Rhetoric level, the child learns  <br/>
to express and practice what he has learned. Essays, compositions, and  <br/>
public speaking are applications of English study. Surveying,  <br/>
accounting, and engineering are all applications of mathematical study.  <br/>
Developing views in politics, economics, religion, or science are  <br/>
applications of historical study.<br/>
**********<br/>
<br/>
This is NOT unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The fourth group are what the first group distainfully calls &quot;eclectic<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers&quot; or &quot;posers.&quot; They are usually people who like the idea<br/>
&gt; of unschooling and want to adopt it, but because they have not yet<br/>
&gt; shifted their educational paradigm, have not made the leap from<br/>
&gt; another method to further down the unschooling continuum.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Disdainfully? Tell that to Eclectic Homeschooling Online&#39;s Bev Krueger,  <br/>
someone many of us here have known for 10 years, and who is largely  <br/>
responsible for that term, having coined it some years ago when we all  <br/>
were coming up with ways to describe various homeschooling styles, and  <br/>
it is CERTAINLY not a negative term. It does NOT denote people who like  <br/>
unschooling but haven&#39;t made the leap yet - it is the clear choice of  <br/>
people who don&#39;t WANT to unschool, but do want to pick and choose from  <br/>
all kinds of different methods, depending on child, subject and  <br/>
circumstances. If you&#39;re unfamiliar with eclectic homeschooling, you&#39;ll  <br/>
want to spend some time at &lt;www.eho.org&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thoughts?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My thoughts are that you didn&#39;t get much of the above right and I have  <br/>
no idea what your point was anyway.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that gets heard though. (Boy was there an argument on 101 about it<br/>
:-/)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to tell people stuck in school-think that they need to stop<br/>
thinking the only important learning is in textbooks without it sounding to<br/>
others like unschoolers should never touch textbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my &quot;categories&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers who apply the philosophy to just academics, not<br/>
parenting.<br/>
<br/>
There are unschoolers who apply the philosophy to all aspects of life.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who are influenced by people with a different definition of<br/>
unschooling than gets used here. Unschooling gets used to mean days off from<br/>
curriculum and what kids do on the weekends and in the afternoon after doing<br/>
their school work. It appeases parents&#39; guilt to be able to attach an<br/>
official term to times when their kids aren&#39;t doing what looks like<br/>
learning. They needed a word and from what they understood from hearing<br/>
about unschooling, unschooling sounded like the word they needed.<br/>
<br/>
But they aren&#39;t unschoolers. They&#39;re just misinformed about what unschooling<br/>
is. They don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s a real philosophy of learning, not just a<br/>
word for when kids aren&#39;t doing school work.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who &quot;unschool except for math&quot; and &quot;unschool as soon as my<br/>
kids can read&quot;. To me, they&#39;re missing some key elements in the unschooling<br/>
philosophy because of fear.<br/>
<br/>
And there are probably small pockets of unschoolers where they&#39;ve banded<br/>
together in agreement that certain aspects of life need controlled like<br/>
television or food. I know occasionally people will say on this list that<br/>
they got slammed on another unschoolingl ist for video games and television.<br/>
(Again, I think, people who limit are missing some key elements in the<br/>
unschooling philosophy.)<br/>

believe that not all experiences are created equal (since, were that<br/>

I think those are missing THE key ingredient.<br/>
<br/>
It IS true, though, that a child who comes out of school already <br/>
understanding mathematical notation and being an avid reader is a SHOE-IN for continuing <br/>
with unschooling, because he won&#39;t be baffled by standardized tests, and <br/>
because the mom will be past those two great points of paralyzing fright.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s is not to say I would ever EVER recommend that a prospective <br/>
unschooler with a young child should teach reading and math first and then later <br/>
unschool.<br/>

loathe it for the most part.  Unless he has changed his mind about <br/>
it, everything I have read by him (granted alot of his essays in book <br/>
form are at least 5 years old) is that he ranks television the 2nd <br/>
bad influence on children next to the 1st which is, of course, <br/>
school.  Here&#39;s a quote from him below:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Between schooling and television, all the time children have is <br/>
eaten up. That&#39;s what has destroyed the American family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 and another one:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Two institutions at present control our children&#39;s lives -television <br/>
and schooling- in that order.  Both of these reduce the real world of <br/>
wisdom, fortitude, temperence, and justice to a never-ending, nonstop <br/>
abstraction.  In centuries past, the time of a child and adolescent <br/>
would be occupied in real work, real charity, real adventures, and <br/>
the real search for mentors who might teach what one really wanted to <br/>
learn.  A great deal of time was spent in community pursuits, <br/>
practicing affection, meeting and studying every level of the <br/>
community, learing how to make a home, and dozens of other tasks <br/>
necessary to becoming a whole man or woman.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I LOVE television as much as anyone here. We&#39;ve got DVDs, PCs, TVs, <br/>
Dishnetwork, Gaming systems, you name it. But, hey, they don&#39;t call <br/>
it the &quot;plug in drug&quot; for nothing. Even I can see that. And there are <br/>
many, many times that I think to myself, &quot;How much exploring and <br/>
discovering, learning, creating-in and enjoyment of the world around <br/>
them would my kids be doing if I unplugged them from their Matrix?&quot; <br/>
My honest answer to myself is, &quot;a whole bunch more&quot;. I can&#39;t lie to <br/>
myself, TV can be a ridiculous time wasting, productivity sucking <br/>
sink. It can also be wonderful. For me, I am still trying to find <br/>
that balance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507315226">&lt;&lt; he ranks television the 2nd bad influence on children <br/>
next to the 1st which is, of course, school &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He knows a lot about schoolkids, and TV is bad for schoolkids.<br/>
<br/>
It honestly does seem that TV is used differently by unschooled kids than <br/>
school kids, in almost every conceivable way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Both of these reduce the real world of <br/>
<br/>
wisdom, fortitude, temperence, and justice to a never-ending, nonstop <br/>
<br/>
abstraction. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can see that in the case of school, but not of TV in an unschooled life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; In centuries past, the time of a child and adolescent <br/>
<br/>
would be occupied in real work, real charity, real adventures, and <br/>
<br/>
the real search for mentors who might teach what one really wanted to <br/>
<br/>
learn. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From most of what I&#39;ve read about centuries past, the time of a child and <br/>
adolescent were spent being forced to do things they didn&#39;t want to do, at the <br/>
threat of violence, and few were in the home of their parents after they were 15 <br/>
or so, either having been put out to work, as servants in other households or <br/>
page/lady/hostage if they were wealthy, or they had run away or were married. <br/>
  &quot;Centuries past&quot; aren&#39;t much model to hold up to any unschooled child in <br/>
the peace of his own home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But, hey, they don&#39;t call <br/>
<br/>
it the &quot;plug in drug&quot; for nothing. Even I can see that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They called it that because it was catchy and the author of a book wanted to <br/>
hook people in to buy a book and say he must be really smart.  It&#39;s rhetorical <br/>
wrestling at the pro-wrestling circuit level.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For me, I am still trying to find <br/>
<br/>
that balance.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For you, or for your children?   Your own rhetorical musing involved You <br/>
unplugging Them.<br/>
<br/>
What wonderful real-world adventures are you offering them instead of <br/>
watching TV?  Because if you want them to find their own adventures in the same old <br/>
back yard or their same old bedroom, they might be wise to watch TV..<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;TV can be a ridiculous time wasting, productivity sucking sink&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What are you wanting your kids to produce?<br/>
Are your kids in the habit of doing ridiculously wasteful sucking things?<br/>
<br/>
Holly spent the night with a friend, so I have no idea if she&#39;s watching TV.  <br/>
I doubt it.<br/>
<br/>
Marty watched Addams Family Values because it&#39;s overdue on a rental and I <br/>
want to take it back.  I watched some of it with him.  We took a castle-blocks <br/>
set all apart into its little pieces so someone will play with it next time it&#39;s <br/>
out, and I looked up two things on the internet for him.  We paused to talk <br/>
about The Producers, and to look something up about voice work (because of a <br/>
short scene Nathan Lane is in).   I brought him lunch while he was watching, and <br/>
sat with him for a lot of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is painting miniatures.  He has to go to work at 5:00, but he got up <br/>
before noon and started working on his miniature army.  He was watching a movie <br/>
on TV.  I went in to sit with him and talk to him about last night (he was <br/>
home with role players; I was gone).   He said &quot;I don&#39;t think you would like this <br/>
movie.&quot;  It was about kidnapping, and violence, and craziness.  He was out of <br/>
the room a lot anyway, putting coats of primer or finisher on one piece or <br/>
another, on the deck where it wouldn&#39;t stink so much.<br/>
<br/>
TVs in five rooms, and two were on for a movie&#39;s-length apiece.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s going ice skating later.  Holly will probably go too.  We&#39;re having <br/>
overnight company, and they&#39;ll probably go skating as well.<br/>
<br/>
If there were no skating planned, they might watch TV instead, or not.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t see it as a ridiculous...sink.<br/>
If someone&#39;s life is sad enough that TV is the best thing for them, then <br/>
STILL it&#39;s a good choice.  But the unschoolers I know are out and about, doing <br/>
real things that involve art or birds or skateboards or scouts or music, and <br/>
they&#39;re not using TV for avoiding life.<br/>
<br/>
The schoolkids I know, that&#39;s another matter.  Some are no longer in a <br/>
relationship with their parents outside of appeals for funds and reports of whether <br/>
they have homework, whether it&#39;s done, and what their teachers said.  Past <br/>
those obligations, they avoid their parents.  It&#39;s sad.  TV didn&#39;t cause that.  <br/>
School did.<br/>

she was doing while watching her cartoons.  <br/>
<br/>
We played a board game, we pretended to be various animals and hoped <br/>
around the house, she played pretend kitchen and made me cookies and <br/>
cakes, she pulled EVERY book in her room out and &quot;read&quot; them to the <br/>
tv and then to me, she stood on her chair got her microphone and <br/>
sang to me a song that she was making up as she went along......the <br/>
list goes on and on.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you Sandra for, once again, making me see that she wasn&#39;t just <br/>
sitting in front of the tv like a little robot.<br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking about another article that I read on Sandra&#39;s <br/>
website about &quot;strewing.&quot;  I was picking up the toys from the living <br/>
room that my DD had stopped playing with and took a bunch of new <br/>
ones that she hadn&#39;t played with in a while down there.  She got all <br/>
excited and started yelling &quot;thank you mommy, thank you.&quot;  :)  She <br/>
can&#39;t remember what toys she has unless they are in front of her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224528819">I too still have days where I struggle with the hours spent <br/>
watching tv.  However, I don&#39;t limit the amount of time that my DD <br/>
watches. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I struggle with this too, especially this time of year.  BUT, I am trying to also keep in perspective that it *is* cold outside, that we are all tired of the snow, that we LONG for warm weather.  And I try to remember that in the summer we rarely ever watch tv or play video games.  We are almost always outside doing *something*.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra asked what is offered that is more interesting in place of tv.  She also asks if we expect our kids to have an adventure in the &quot;same old&quot; backyard, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
That would be *our* problem.  And I confess, in the cold dreary weather, it is hard to motivate myself to get out there and mix things up a little.<br/>
<br/>
TV (and movies, I love movies) are our escape, though today it was grocery shopping and going to the library, and yes, even doing the taxes (my 11 year old enjoyed watching me do that).  And I am absolutely astonished at all the stuff my 15 year old has learned from tv.<br/>
<br/>
Just today my daughter was complaining bitterly about the weather, and I said &quot;we really need to come up with something creative to do between now and spring so that we don&#39;t go nuts&quot; LOL.  I&#39;m a home body.  I am content to sit at home and read.  My kids aren&#39;t.  They&#39;ve done a lot of drawing, creating, and playing with dolls.  But its getting old.  They need something new.<br/>
<br/>
I guess its time to break out the games again or find a really suspenseful book to read to them...or maybe get out the scrapboooking stuff again, or who knows what else.  Maybe we&#39;ll learn to cook some new dishes, or bake, or plan a room makeover.<br/>

  I was <br/>
  &gt; thinking about my DD sitting in front of the tv for a lot of the <br/>
  day <br/>
  &gt; and focusing on that instead of focusing on the OTHER things that <br/>
  &gt; she was doing while watching her cartoons.  <br/>
<br/>
  My daughter cracks me up when she settles down in front of the tv <br/>
  with a Harry Potter book in her lap.  I don&#39;t know how she does it, <br/>
  but she watches tv and reads at the same time.  She knows what&#39;s <br/>
  going on the tv show and knows what she read.  I don&#39;t know how she <br/>

brain can&#39;t focus on just one thing at a time.  My parents never <br/>
believed me and made my turn off the tv if I was reading or doing <br/>
homework.  I was so glad when I got to college and could study with <br/>
the tv on.  Big surprise, my studying was better in college.  I <br/>
learned from that experience that I should listen to my kid when he <br/>

  I did say, however, that in all honesty I have seen TV be a huge <br/>
time sink for my family. Given a beautiful day, during winter, they <br/>
don&#39;t want to go outside.  Somehow, TV has this seductive quality <br/>
that can pull people in the same house far away from each other, <br/>
video gaming and the internet have the same pull, it seems. I look so <br/>
forward to time spent together, because that time is increasingly <br/>
rare, and being with each other seems less appealing than being in <br/>
front of a screen. Surely, I can&#39;t be the only one who has ever <br/>
experienced this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling the 2 youngest for years, the oldest off/on <br/>
(I want on, my husband want&#39;s off...whole different story...at least <br/>
dh is coming around).  Alot of unschoolers say after a while tv <br/>
looses is hold. Well, not in my house. We don&#39;t have limits or rules <br/>
about it&#39;s use either. I long for the day my kids don&#39;t care about it <br/>
as much anymore. I long for that more than I long for them to read, <br/>
write, etc...<br/>
<br/>
I know the whole &quot;to TV or not TV that is the question&quot; has been <br/>

list.  So I am not trying to start anything. Just musing a little. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I realized that, Rachel. And I think it is extremely important to note <br/>
that John Gatto is not some sort of expert on tv and/or unschooling and <br/>
I am also saying that it isn&#39;t relevant to me WHAT John Gatto thinks <br/>
about it. John Gatto has never unschooled a kid. He was a <br/>
schoolteacher, for many years, and a speaker and writer about education <br/>
since. His ideas are provocative - I&#39;ve heard him speak and read his <br/>
books (I read the galley proofs of his history of education book, <br/>
before it was even published). I&#39;ve talked to him myself.<br/>
<br/>
Saying that John Gatto thinks tv is evil - providing quotes for proving <br/>
that John Gatto thinks it is evil - makes it seem like we should <br/>
actually CARE what he thinks about it. I&#39;m saying, unequivocally, that <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know what an unschooling life can be like and why tv and <br/>
video games can have a very very different role in our families.<br/>
<br/>
Now - Rachel -- you&#39;ve now posted more than once about how TV is awful <br/>
for your family. but then you sound in your last paragraph like you <br/>
don&#39;t really want to talk about it. However, remember that one of our <br/>
list guidelines is that you shouldn&#39;t post anything you don&#39;t want <br/>
discussed.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you want to talk about what&#39;s going on and why TV appears to be <br/>
such a problem in your family - we can do that, but I&#39;ll leave it alone <br/>
for now except to say that maybe your focus is too much on the <br/>
tv/problem. For example, did YOU go outside and enjoy yourself - maybe <br/>
make hot chocolate and cookies and have a picnic in the gorgeous <br/>
outdoors? Or did you just keep thinking that they &quot;should&quot; look outside <br/>
and want to go out?<br/>

But there ARE rules and restrictions about its use in your house. They may <br/>
not be verbalized, but because, deep down, YOU CARE----you want them to choose <br/>

&lt;&lt; Castle blocks?  Sounds interesting!  Where did you procure these?  *grins* <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Kirby was a baby, there were castle blocks at Toys by Roy, an upscale <br/>
toy store in Albuquerque which then promptly went out of business (after having <br/>
been there my whole life).    We couldn&#39;t have afforded them anyway, as they <br/>
were $60 and $80 a set.  They&#39;re from Spain.   They&#39;re like Lego, but specific <br/>
castle-parts.<br/>
<br/>
Then one day at a thrift store there was a plastic bag with a bunch of blocks <br/>
AND the booklet for the set, for $5.  What a score!<br/>
<br/>
I looked at the paper.  The company is Exin, and the line is &quot;Castillo,&quot; so I <br/>
looked up Exin Castillo at google and found this:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.trollandtoad.com/p108270.html">http://www.trollandtoad.com/p108270.html</a><br/>
One small used set, but you can see what they look like so you can be on the <br/>
lookout at thrift stores or maybe e-bay.<br/>
<br/>
There were other sites, in Spanish.  So if anyone&#39;s in Europe or going to <br/>
Europe, maybe they&#39;re still in production!<br/>
<br/>
The blocks are like Lego, kind of, lots are curved for towers, there are <br/>
gates and windows and little roofs.  The blocks are a little bigger than Lego <br/>
blocks, and stone-colored.<br/>
<br/>
Another building set my kids have really enjoyed is Ramagon.  Those are Lego <br/>
compatible, but they&#39;re space stuff, and more mathematically oriented than <br/>
regular Lego.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ramagon.com/">http://www.ramagon.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Those, too, are brought out every eight or 13 months (randomly after they&#39;re <br/>
cold and forgotten) and Marty and Holly, especially, go to it!  I should buy <br/>
some more...<br/>

movie (if I&#39;m not reading, LOL). That bugs my DH also, he used to have a <br/>
problem with me having a book while watching TV because he never felt like I was all <br/>
there. The book no longer bothers him, he&#39;d rather I do that now than go to <br/>
the computer. I just have to do more than one thing to be able to stay engaged. <br/>
