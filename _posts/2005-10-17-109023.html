Jackie  has not yet found much joy in taking walks.  Can&#39;t even get around <br/>
the  block without complaining that her legs hurt, too tired,  etc.<br/>

I dislike taking walks around my neighborhood, too.  BOOOORING.   It feels <br/>
pointless and if I&#39;m with others it makes me feel out of control.   I feel <br/>
vulnerable to being hurt or it raining or something like that and not  being able <br/>
to get back except via my own two feet.  These are the same  reasons I had <br/>
trouble on group runs in the Army, too.  Physically I could  do it.  <br/>
Psychologically, not knowing where I&#39;m going and when it would end  was VERY hard.<br/>
 <br/>
But I LOVE to walk in the woods and ride my bike all around my  neighborhood <br/>
and wherever else I can ride it. I LOVE to walk my dogs in the  neighborhood.  <br/>
I can walk to the park or the store.  But just to  walk around the <br/>
neighborhood, nah.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just walking is boring.  Doing something while walking, or doing it  for a <br/>
purpose is not.<br/>
