<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801327090">I met this cool woman who just signed onto my homeschool list. She publishes <br/>
a zine called The Edgy-catin&#39; Mama, a feminist homeschooling/unschooling zine. <br/>
She offers the first issue free, and her subscriptions are inexpensive. To <br/>
get a free issue, e-mail your address to: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:edgycatinmama@...">edgycatinmama@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an interview with her here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://grrrlzines.net/interviews/edgy.htm">http://grrrlzines.net/interviews/edgy.htm</a><br/>
