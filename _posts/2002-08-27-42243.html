My parents thought it was scary that negroes might actually get rights some<br/>
day. They believed that it was scary that the Jews were interested in<br/>
becoming educated. They though it was ludicrous that nuns visited our house<br/>
to collect money for their churches from our servants (!). They were not at<br/>
all scared that Hitler was exterminating Jews in Europe. They believed it<br/>
was a good idea that blacks who were convicted of crimes should be<br/>
castrated. They liked having people in office who could be bribed.<br/>

I had a friend once who asked a group, &quot;Are we in this room, or is the room,<br/>
really, in us?&quot;    i.e., do we create our life, or does it create us?</div>

This is true - however it is hard to really comprehend how people thought the way they did - and how they found certain things acceptable.(Slavery for instance) and lived with themselves -<br/>
