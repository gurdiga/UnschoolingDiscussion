<div id="ygrps-yiv-948391471">Many thanks to those who responded both on and off list with pet loss <br/>
references, and for the condolences.  I wrote that e-mail last night.  My Schip died <br/>
Mar. 4, and it took me that long to be able to ask for references.  <br/>
<br/>
This morning, we found our 6 year old orange tabby paralyzed from the waist <br/>
down.  Medication for an embolism isn&#39;t working, and most likely we will have <br/>
to euthanize him tomorrow.  Looks like I asked for the books just in time.  <br/>
It&#39;s been pet hell at our house this year; DD also lost her beloved aquatic frogs <br/>
which she&#39;d had for two years.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, and I look forward to eventually posting some happy comments, <br/>
but not tonight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147886340">Oh, yuck.  I&#39;m sorry you are having such a hard month.<br/>
<br/>
In 1997, I lost a baby on June 18th, my Sheltie, Jasmine (16 years old, <br/>
I had her for half my life)  in July, and my 15 year old Sheltie (the <br/>
two shelties had been together for 14 years, and poor Jerry couldn&#39;t <br/>
handle it without Jasmine, he died of heart break...I was too heart <br/>
broken myself to even notice he was dying) in August.  It was three <br/>
months of hell.  It took me years to open my heart up to another <br/>
animal.  We still had our Tigger (who is now a 16 year old <br/>
Malamute/Shepard cross).  Tigger is doing great, but not a day goes by I <br/>
don&#39;t worry about him being so old and having to undergo the pain of <br/>
death again.  His death, of course, will be painless, but dealing with <br/>
our children (who have never had life without him) and my own heartbreak <br/>
will be difficult.<br/>
