<div id="ygrps-yiv-469955095">We made it back from the goat show.  Had a ball and Adriane did a good job<br/>
showing her goat.  We were able to talk until there was simply nothing left<br/>
that NEEDED to be said and we could just enjoy comfortable silence at times.<br/>
<br/>
Shyrley--you shave a goat&#39;s butt because it is a dairy goat show and the<br/>
judge has to get up close and personal to check out all the mammary system.<br/>
The goat is washed, shined and shaved from head to toe.<br/>
<br/>
But.....today I was snotty and hateful and so were the kids.  Stressed to<br/>
the gills and couldn&#39;t put my finger on why.  The kids and I just couldn&#39;t<br/>
see eye to eye on anything today.  Finally, after supper, we were able to<br/>
find a way to relax into each other and find some enjoyment together.<br/>
Thinking positive thoughts for a better tomorrow.<br/>
