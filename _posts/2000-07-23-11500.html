&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t afford that.  <br/>
 I am 52 and am afraid to try to go without health insurance for myself. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I and the two kids don&#39;t have health insurance... Our premiums were $300 a <br/>
month and then a co-pay of $15.  My kids go to the doctors about once a year, <br/>
if that and it seemed such a waste of money.  We took $200 and put it into an <br/>
account each month and that&#39;s where we pay from if we need the doctors <br/>
(which, as I said is rare).  Our car insurance covers us if we are in any <br/>
kind of accident, whether it&#39;s my fault or not and people we visit own their <br/>
homes and have home owners insurance so the only other accidents or medical <br/>
issues would be like apendicitis.  We felt that self-pay was the better way <br/>
to go in our case, as our kids just don&#39;t seem to get sick (touch wood).... <br/>
Max has never been sick since he was born and he&#39;s 10 months and Zak&#39;s had 2 <br/>
very bad colds and that&#39;s it in his 5 years.  I guess we come from robust <br/>
stock (LOL)...<br/>
