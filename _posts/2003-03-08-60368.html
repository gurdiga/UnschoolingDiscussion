<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010646684">Hello All !  <br/>
<br/>
For those in Brevard County, Florida.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let everyone know that our 4-H club, the South Brevard<br/>
Shamrocks, will be starting 2 new projects in 2 weeks:  one will be<br/>
&quot;model rocketry&quot; and the other will be &quot;rabbits&quot;.  Anyone interested in<br/>
one or both of these projects can contact me at  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Diane@...">Diane@...</a><br/>
We are now meeting on Friday mornings, 10am for most projects-this seems<br/>
to be a better fit for most of us.  Our meetings have been switched to<br/>
Grant Park (1st St in Grant) for the time being to allow younger<br/>
children play time in the playground while the older kids are involved<br/>
in their projects.  Bring your own drinks and snacks!<br/>
<br/>
Our solar car project and photography project have both been delayed due<br/>
to the project leader being out of town for a bit.  I am sorry about the<br/>
delay-both should be starting early May, but will keep everyone updated.<br/>
<br/>
Our dog care & training project continues.anyone interested, let me<br/>
know!<br/>
<br/>
