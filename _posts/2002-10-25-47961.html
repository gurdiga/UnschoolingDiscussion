&gt; schism when I suddenly think &quot;Mum would have hit me if I had been doing<br/>
&gt; this&quot;. It could be something as simple as making a mess with water.<br/>
&gt; These realizations make it hard for me to accept her apology in my<br/>
&gt; heart. She said to me, &quot;I felt about you the way you feel about Jayn&quot;.<br/>
&gt; There must have been something in my face, because her next words were<br/>
&gt; &quot;you don&#39;t believe me&quot;. I don&#39;t. If she had felt the way I do, she<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t have done it. A thousand generations of abuse and fury. Well it<br/>
&gt; stops here: the chain is broken. I am the bulwark against the teeming<br/>
&gt; rages of my family history. There is nothing that Jayn could ever do<br/>
&gt; that would cause me to spank her, or believe she deserved to be spanked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>God Robin! What a great post! <br/>
<br/>
This is long and full of some much needed venting, so skip if you need to.<br/>
<br/>
When you say that you sometimes think *My Mom would have hit me for this* is <br/>
it at times when Jayn is doing something and you are frustrated and have to <br/>
think before you act? Or are you just watching Jayn, thinking, but not in the <br/>
least upset? (makes no sense? &lt;g&gt;) I ask this because, unlike you, I used to <br/>
spank and I still find there are times when I have to stop, remind myself how <br/>
unfair I used to think things were in my house. How much I hated the belt, <br/>
the spoon, the hand, my parents. And remind myself that I am not going to <br/>
take my anger at a perceived situation and turn into that wild woman I once <br/>
saw in the mirror. <br/>
<br/>
Many times I have to remind myself that the ideas I have about how children <br/>
should act come from being hit, or even just the looks. I&#39;m not exaggerating <br/>
when I say that I could eat too loud, breath the wrong way, sit the wrong way <br/>
and get a nasty look or a pinch or a slap. I remember too many colds, not <br/>
being able to breath through my stuffed up nose and forcing myself not to <br/>
breath through my mouth, cause *mouth breathers look like retarded dopes*. I <br/>
remember sitting at the table with a plate of food being taught how to eat. <br/>
You keep one hand in your lap, you take a fork of food and put it in your <br/>
mouth. You close your mouth, but not your teeth, around the food. You take <br/>
the food off the fork, but don&#39;t scrape your teeth on the fork and make an <br/>
irritating noise. You slide the fork out of your mouth, without opening your <br/>
lips too far, making sure your teeth don&#39;t make any noise, then you set your <br/>
fork down and chew, making sure not to open your mouth. Eating chips was pure <br/>
terror. No noise. I remember eating a chip very slowly to keep from getting <br/>
smacked. There were ways to dust, to vacuum, to make a bed, to eat, to wash <br/>
dishes, to set a thermostat, to put pillows on a couch... <br/>
<br/>
Last Thanksgiving Darin was in the kitchen with my Mom, Sister and me and he <br/>
asked if there really was a right and wrong way to do dishes. My Dad and <br/>
Brother walked in just then and my whole family just looked at him. I looked <br/>
at Darin, shrugged my shoulders and said, I told you so. He understands me <br/>
now when I sit at a table and cry just to keep myself from saying something <br/>
to the kids about how they are eating. <br/>
<br/>
My Sister called me a month or so ago, crying. She had just moved to <br/>
Pennsylvania, just gotten married, and was trying to set her new husband&#39;s <br/>
kitchen in order. She had taken everything out of the cabinets, washed every <br/>
single cup, fork, cookie sheet and bowl and put everything away. She had <br/>
stacked all the dry goods up in the *right* order, placed all the cans on the <br/>
shelves in the *correct* place. That evening, her husband did the dishes *all <br/>
wrong* and then put them away with no regard to how Renee&#39; had organized <br/>
everything. They didn&#39;t have a fight, but he couldn&#39;t get her to understand <br/>
that it was okay if he put a bowl on top of plates. He put some groceries <br/>
away and he just stacked the cans in the cabinet. She called, crying and the <br/>
first words out of her mouth were &quot;Aren&#39;t the cans of green beans supposed to <br/>
all be together? Doesn&#39;t the cereal all have to be stacked in order of box <br/>
size?&quot; She was frantic. She wanted me to tell her new husband that he did it <br/>
all wrong, that there was a right way to do things, to explain it to him, to <br/>
make him understand. But what I heard was a terrified little girl. <br/>
<br/>
I thought I had avoided passing some of this crap onto my kids. I have never <br/>
said to anyone how to wash a dish, or put things away in a certain order. I <br/>
was wrong, I didn&#39;t have to. Actions speak volumes. Moly was washing dishes <br/>
the other night and Darin went in and asked her if she wanted help. She said <br/>
sure, you wash, I&#39;ll dry. So they were going about it and about 5 minutes <br/>
later, she came into me and said, &quot;Daddy&#39;s washing the dishes in the wrong <br/>
order.&quot; Darin laughed and said to me that she is just like me! Then he told <br/>
me that when I was gone for a week last summer, she had helped him with the <br/>
groceries and they were putting things away and she put things in the cabinet <br/>
just like I did. He said she dusts like me, folds clothes like me... I <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe it. Sometimes I really feel like I haven&#39;t escaped all that <br/>
abuse, and I have passed it on through my genes or something. Its like ugly <br/>
cold fingers that have reached past my efforts to keep my kids safe and <br/>
touched them despite me. I really hate that. Does anyone who has made it to <br/>
the end of my long post, go through this too? I hope not. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255438611">Nancy,  <br/>
  I can surely relate to your post.<br/>
 But is it possible that you have modeled the way you do things and your<br/>
daughter has picked up on it? she is with you most of the time it sounds<br/>
like and would have picked up your way.<br/>
  Just a thought!<br/>
<br/>
  I have struggled with these issues too. I may not spank but if I yell<br/>
is that &quot;better&quot;? If I get to where I don&#39;t yell but I  shame them<br/>
verbally is that &quot;better&quot;? If I don&#39;t shame them verbally but I give the<br/>
&quot;look&quot; is that better?  I feel like I am failing...but my family tells me<br/>
that I am &quot;learning&quot; and these are the baby steps to doing it &quot;better&quot;.<br/>
  I love the idea of picking up the child that I am angry with. Talk<br/>
about wisdom!!!! Your dad really has something there. <br/>
  Does anyone else have &quot;tapes&quot; that seem to play in your mind of what<br/>
you should do (because of what you have heard,seen or been told to do by<br/>
friends or family)? And you have to deal with that as well as your own<br/>
feelings and the issue at hand?<br/>

<br/>
Hope you don&#39;t mind my asking but how old are you both? I ask because<br/>
this sounds more like my sister&#39;s generation. She is almost<br/>
50.....Reminds me of the not wearing white until a certain date. Making<br/>
sure that you crossed your feet at the ankles instead of at the knee,<br/>
making sure you had gloves,purse and hat all matching... sounds old<br/>
huh?(Actually it isn&#39;t as I am 41 and we have our own set of &quot;rules&quot;) The<br/>
picture I get is Jaqueline Kennedy...wasn&#39;t she the example to follow<br/>
then?<br/>
  As you both shared I could see that there are alot of &quot;manners&quot; that<br/>
don&#39;t really have a purpose. How many people are offended by sucking ice<br/>
cubes when you drink (no offense Nancy...it just seemed funny), having<br/>
your arms on the table etc...But I did feel that certain families had<br/>
very set rules and sometimes what was okay in my family either made me<br/>
feel like a &quot;heel&quot; in someone elses or made me think ill thoughts of<br/>
them.<br/>
  *sigh* we sure do put alot of &quot;expectations on people don&#39;t we? And<br/>
many times we don&#39;t think twice about them.<br/>

my oldest daughter sob at the table...she must have been 3 at the <br/>
most....because she wasn&#39;t sitting properly.  Not a proud parenting moment <br/>
and not one I ever repeated.<br/>
<br/>
My dad had rules for everything from how to shut a door to how to walk across <br/>
the floor.  Sadly, I truly empathize with your sister.  It took me<br/>
a long, long time to realize that there wasn&#39;t a &quot;right&quot; way to do laundry or <br/>
clean or turn on the stupid television.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, we can un-learn that kind of garbage!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I ask this because, unlike you, I used to <br/>
spank and I still find there are times when I have to stop, remind myself how <br/>
unfair I used to think things were in my house.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I still do that sometimes.  And sometimes I say &quot;My mom would have spanked me <br/>
for that, so it&#39;s hard for me not to see you do that and get kind of <br/>
agitated.&quot; (or whatever)<br/>
<br/>
Just today I was really angry with Holly, so I asked her to go and check <br/>
whether the back gate was locked.  Kirby had gone out, to walk to work (since <br/>
I can&#39;t take him) and I wanted her to make sure it was locked.  But I mostly <br/>
wanted her to go for a walk outside and breathe.  While she was out I told <br/>
Marty, &quot;Marty I&#39;m really angry with Holly, so much I felt like hitting her.  <br/>
Help me!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Marty said, &quot;Okay, you want to hit me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said no, that I just wanted him to talk to me to help me figure out how to <br/>
solve the afternoon&#39;s social problems.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly was supposed to go to a movie with some teenaged girls, homeschoolers.  <br/>
Another homeschooling family invited her over at 3:00, for just a while. She <br/>
didn&#39;t know yet whether they were going to the 4:30 or 7:00 show.  She was <br/>
very indecisive, and as the mom was calling me from some phone somewhere and <br/>
I couldn&#39;t call her back, Holly said okay.  Then she started whimpering and <br/>
whining and saying she also wanted to go swimming with her dad at 6:00.  So <br/>
marty called and found out the movie was at 4:30.  So we can cancel the one <br/>
playdate, she can go to the 4:30 movie and then swim with her dad.  Then she <br/>
starts whining that she really wants to play at 3:00.<br/>
<br/>
It was the whining and pouting and hitting the floor that was bugging me the <br/>
most.  The embarrassment of having to tell this other really nice family that <br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t able to go after all (they&#39;re going to come pick her up).  <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a horrible big deal, but my mother&#39;s spirit came into me and wanted <br/>
to tell Holly to go to her room, she couldn&#39;t go anywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s stupid, and not a solution.<br/>
<br/>
So we discussed (Marty and I, in front of Holly who was pouting) what all the <br/>
factors were.  It&#39;s really not a huge problem.  The family won&#39;t be crushed <br/>
about Holly not playing; they had some stuff to pick up here anyway, and it&#39;s <br/>
just a very few miles out of their way.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out after the movie the girls are going to the mall, and so she <br/>
cancelled swimming with her dad.<br/>
<br/>
All my angst and frustration was MINE!  (Mine and my mom&#39;s.)  <br/>
<br/>
What made the difference was me thinking &quot;How important is it?&quot;  And seeing <br/>
that Marty wasn&#39;t the least bit agitated, even though there was a time that <br/>
he was in on the movie plan and he can&#39;t go.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly will see her friend for probably half an hour this afternoon and then <br/>
NOT go home with them.  She can show her her new room (my old office) and I <br/>
can talk to the mom.<br/>
<br/>
Too long, but freesh evidence that the urge to smite still comes upon me.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I have struggled with these issues too. I may not spank but if I yell<br/>
is that &quot;better&quot;? If I get to where I don&#39;t yell but I  shame them<br/>
verbally is that &quot;better&quot;? If I don&#39;t shame them verbally but I give the<br/>
&quot;look&quot; is that better?  I feel like I am failing...but my family tells me<br/>
that I am &quot;learning&quot; and these are the baby steps to doing it &quot;better&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a firm believer in getting better incrementally if you can&#39;t jump all the <br/>
way to the ultimate goal.  Yes, verbal shaming is a step away from hitting.  <br/>
And once you feel bad about that, you can try another thing when those tapes <br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
Richard Prystowsky, in the Peaceful Parenting talk said something about tapes <br/>
in your head.  One teacher told him you can never get rid of them entirely, <br/>
but you can turn down the volume.<br/>
<br/>
What I do is I have the taped response to go with it.  &quot;YES, but you didn&#39;t <br/>
have to do that.&quot; or &quot;But it&#39;s not that important.&quot;  So I think my mom&#39;s <br/>
words, and then I include my own.  Then I feel better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705666399">Nancy, yes I go through this too,<br/>
I read this and tears run down my face,<br/>
I had the same experience, not so much physical abuse on the controling side but verbal and emotional.   I was lucky my parents were older when they got to me,  my older siblings got the physical abuse.<br/>
In this new life for us, (unschooling) it is really opening my eyes to how different my family lived, compared to many.   I thought that was the right way to parent.  My mother would still argue that we are just helping our children see what it right.  How to eat, what to say, how to react, etc...<br/>
I never knew how to do those things.  She never let me figure it out.<br/>
Now it&#39;s very hard to let those things go and it definitely comes into conflict with new ideas (new ideas to me anyway) such as attachment parenting, the continuum concept and peaceful/joyful parenting.  For me,  I know I have to try and seperate my childhood feelings/sadness from how I react to my children.   I believe that this is my biggest hurdle.    If I am completely rested and feeling healthy, I do pretty well at it.   But yet on the other hand if I am feeling the way I am right now how I did last night, I fail miserably at it!!              What happens with me also is when I&#39;m around my family, my parents especially, I fall back into those feelings.   Hence then I come back home and yuck!              Slap on top of that a bad cold and my period and I think its a recipe for disaster!! ( Ok this is probably more info than needed, but that&#39;s me, sorry)<br/>
Remember, Tia, what you said,  many things are very cyclical!  <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway,  Nancy,  I know what you are going through, I&#39;m just glad that we have found this way of life and with the help and support of others we can lick these unhealthy/dysfunctional behaviors. <br/>
If you ever need to vent like I do,  go ahead and e-mail me.  <br/>
I know some of you will wonder where this comes into unschooling, but for those of us who grew up this way, its much harder to live a free, joyful life and to me that is what unschooling can be.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for being here, everyone!<br/>

<br/>
This is long and full of some much needed venting, so skip if you need to.<br/>
<br/>
When you say that you sometimes think *My Mom would have hit me for this* is <br/>
it at times when Jayn is doing something and you are frustrated and have to <br/>
think before you act? Or are you just watching Jayn, thinking, but not in the <br/>
least upset? (makes no sense? &lt;g&gt;) I ask this because, unlike you, I used to <br/>
spank and I still find there are times when I have to stop, remind myself how <br/>
unfair I used to think things were in my house. How much I hated the belt, <br/>
the spoon, the hand, my parents. And remind myself that I am not going to <br/>
take my anger at a perceived situation and turn into that wild woman I once <br/>
saw in the mirror. <br/>
<br/>
Many times I have to remind myself that the ideas I have about how children <br/>
should act come from being hit, or even just the looks. I&#39;m not exaggerating <br/>
when I say that I could eat too loud, breath the wrong way, sit the wrong way <br/>
and get a nasty look or a pinch or a slap. I remember too many colds, not <br/>
being able to breath through my stuffed up nose and forcing myself not to <br/>
breath through my mouth, cause *mouth breathers look like retarded dopes*. I <br/>
remember sitting at the table with a plate of food being taught how to eat. <br/>
You keep one hand in your lap, you take a fork of food and put it in your <br/>
mouth. You close your mouth, but not your teeth, around the food. You take <br/>
the food off the fork, but don&#39;t scrape your teeth on the fork and make an <br/>
irritating noise. You slide the fork out of your mouth, without opening your <br/>
lips too far, making sure your teeth don&#39;t make any noise, then you set your <br/>
fork down and chew, making sure not to open your mouth. Eating chips was pure <br/>
terror. No noise. I remember eating a chip very slowly to keep from getting <br/>
smacked. There were ways to dust, to vacuum, to make a bed, to eat, to wash <br/>
dishes, to set a thermostat, to put pillows on a couch... <br/>
<br/>
Last Thanksgiving Darin was in the kitchen with my Mom, Sister and me and he <br/>
asked if there really was a right and wrong way to do dishes. My Dad and <br/>
Brother walked in just then and my whole family just looked at him. I looked <br/>
at Darin, shrugged my shoulders and said, I told you so. He understands me <br/>
now when I sit at a table and cry just to keep myself from saying something <br/>
to the kids about how they are eating. <br/>
<br/>
My Sister called me a month or so ago, crying. She had just moved to <br/>
Pennsylvania, just gotten married, and was trying to set her new husband&#39;s <br/>
kitchen in order. She had taken everything out of the cabinets, washed every <br/>
single cup, fork, cookie sheet and bowl and put everything away. She had <br/>
stacked all the dry goods up in the *right* order, placed all the cans on the <br/>
shelves in the *correct* place. That evening, her husband did the dishes *all <br/>
wrong* and then put them away with no regard to how Renee&#39; had organized <br/>
everything. They didn&#39;t have a fight, but he couldn&#39;t get her to understand <br/>
that it was okay if he put a bowl on top of plates. He put some groceries <br/>
away and he just stacked the cans in the cabinet. She called, crying and the <br/>
first words out of her mouth were &quot;Aren&#39;t the cans of green beans supposed to <br/>
all be together? Doesn&#39;t the cereal all have to be stacked in order of box <br/>
size?&quot; She was frantic. She wanted me to tell her new husband that he did it <br/>
all wrong, that there was a right way to do things, to explain it to him, to <br/>
make him understand. But what I heard was a terrified little girl. <br/>
<br/>
I thought I had avoided passing some of this crap onto my kids. I have never <br/>
said to anyone how to wash a dish, or put things away in a certain order. I <br/>
was wrong, I didn&#39;t have to. Actions speak volumes. Moly was washing dishes <br/>
the other night and Darin went in and asked her if she wanted help. She said <br/>
sure, you wash, I&#39;ll dry. So they were going about it and about 5 minutes <br/>
later, she came into me and said, &quot;Daddy&#39;s washing the dishes in the wrong <br/>
order.&quot; Darin laughed and said to me that she is just like me! Then he told <br/>
me that when I was gone for a week last summer, she had helped him with the <br/>
groceries and they were putting things away and she put things in the cabinet <br/>
just like I did. He said she dusts like me, folds clothes like me... I <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe it. Sometimes I really feel like I haven&#39;t escaped all that <br/>
abuse, and I have passed it on through my genes or something. Its like ugly <br/>
cold fingers that have reached past my efforts to keep my kids safe and <br/>
touched them despite me. I really hate that. Does anyone who has made it to <br/>
the end of my long post, go through this too? I hope not. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
~Nancy<br/>

Hope you don&#39;t mind my asking but how old are you both? I ask because<br/>
this sounds more like my sister&#39;s generation. She is almost<br/>
50.....Reminds me of the not wearing white until a certain date. Making<br/>
sure that you crossed your feet at the ankles instead of at the knee,<br/>
making sure you had gloves,purse and hat all matching... sounds old<br/>
huh?(Actually it isn&#39;t as I am 41 and we have our own set of &quot;rules&quot;) The<br/>
picture I get is Jaqueline Kennedy...wasn&#39;t she the example to follow<br/>
then?<br/>
  As you both shared I could see that there are alot of &quot;manners&quot; that<br/>
don&#39;t really have a purpose. How many people are offended by sucking ice<br/>
cubes when you drink (no offense Nancy...it just seemed funny), having<br/>
your arms on the table etc...But I did feel that certain families had<br/>
very set rules and sometimes what was okay in my family either made me<br/>
feel like a &quot;heel&quot; in someone elses or made me think ill thoughts of<br/>
them.<br/>
  *sigh* we sure do put alot of &quot;expectations on people don&#39;t we? And<br/>
many times we don&#39;t think twice about them.<br/>

in anger and I would hold out my arm and say &quot;Ok, you want to hit my arm for <br/>

stopping and thinking is the last thing you want to do.  My son is only four, <br/>

an accident, etc. etc.) is to put a picture of the thought in a circle and<br/>
then draw a diagonal line through it, the international symbol for &quot;don&#39;t do<br/>
this&quot;.  It seems to help and might with the parenting tapes.  Maybe visual<br/>
people would find this works and oral people could follow Sandra&#39;s<br/>
suggestion.<br/>
