&lt;&lt; &quot;I like it because I&#39;m good at working there. I like the atmosphere and <br/>
people and it isn&#39;t a stressful job. It doesn&#39;t pump up my adrenaline and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t depress me. I can do it and still do all the other things that I really <br/>
enjoy doing away from work.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty and I met lots of people on our three day &quot;explore&quot; of the far SW <br/>
corner of New Mexico.   We sat and talked, we heard stories, we messed with 19th <br/>
century stuff (little &quot;museums&quot; which are more like extended junkrooms where you <br/>
can pick the dusty stuff up) and asked questions and heard more stories.<br/>
<br/>
We met a lot of enthusiastic people.  The youngest was 20 or 21.  The oldest <br/>
were in their 60&#39;s, maybe 70 on a couple of them.   But they were happy, and <br/>
knowledgeable, and enthusiastically glad to see us.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of them had college degrees, but nothing we saw or talked to them <br/>
about or that they were doing when we saw them had to do with those degrees.   <br/>
<br/>
I hope I will get the mood to write an account of the weekend, but Marty was <br/>
great and learned TONS and made lots of connections and got many future trails <br/>
to follow (literally and figuratively), and all this learning came from <br/>
people who were doing what was fascinating to them.<br/>
<br/>
The youngest person is the oldest granddaughter of the man who currently owns <br/>
a ghosttown called Stein&#39;s (pronounced &quot;steens&quot; and sometimes spelled that <br/>
way in historic mentions).   As she was giving me and Marty our little private <br/>
tour, for which we had paid $2 apiece, I asked her if she thought she would <br/>
still be doing this when she was fifty.   &quot;If I&#39;m lucky!&quot; she said very brightly. <br/>
  My real question had been whether she might want to stay there and become <br/>
the owner someday, and I guess I had my answer.<br/>
<br/>
What college degree would be the best for owning and operating a ghost town?  <br/>
Maybe archeology, or history?  Museum curatorship?    She and her family had <br/>
met 200 people who had lived in that town at one time or another, who had come <br/>
through and told stories.   She told some to us.  Had she been off at college <br/>
instead, she wouldn&#39;t have known so many of those stories.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mention this to Marty; never said &quot;college.&quot;  We just basked in the <br/>
wonder of the journey and the many unplanned stops.  We had never heard of <br/>
that town, but as we showed up to Shakespeare (a more famous ghost town) two <br/>
hours early and had already read all we could at the graveyard, we had those two <br/>
hours to kill, so perused the map for side trips.  There was Stein&#39;s.    They <br/>
were closed too.  So we drove to Arizona just so Marty could say he had, found <br/>
a candy machine at a rest stop that gave us two KitKats for the price of one, <br/>
threw a u-turn and went back to New Mexico where we followed other odd roads <br/>
until we hit gates and turned back.<br/>
<br/>
How could a weekend be better than to be filled with things like that?  And <br/>
we listened to music and sang and laughed and admired different mountain <br/>
skylines and different desert flora than we were used to.   We live around cholla, a<br/>
nd this place had mesquite, and barrel cactus--very exotic for us. &lt;g&gt; We&#39;d <br/>
only seen barrel cactus 2&quot; high in little pots.  Some of these were three feet <br/>
tall and healthy.<br/>
