<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207016781">Have I mentioned we love Tivo? Certainly for being able to easily stop  stuff <br/>
we&#39;re watching and to record stuff we want, but also because Tivo loves us  <br/>
and gives us interesting gifts.<br/>
 <br/>
For some reason, Tivo chose an episode of What&#39;s my Line, a REALLY old  <br/>
gameshow, for us at one point. Julian suggested we watch it, and now we have it  on <br/>
auto-record.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s a really simple show. The panel asks yes or no questions to determine  <br/>
the occupation of a guest contestant. The shows we&#39;re watching now were made in <br/>
 the early 60&#39;s. But it&#39;s SO interesting!!!! And all three of us, including <br/>
16  year old Julian, sit and watch every one.<br/>
 <br/>
Some stuff we&#39;ve learned (partially from the show itself, and partially  <br/>
because it&#39;s led us to lots of googling):<br/>
The panelists are very sophisticated and intelligent. Think NPR&#39;s Wait,  <br/>
Wait, Don&#39;t Tell me. They dress in formal wear (GORGEOUS clothes!). The regulars  <br/>
are Arlene Francis, a really warm, funny actress, Dorothy Kilgallen, a  <br/>
journalist, and Bennet Cerf, who was the publisher who ran Random House. The  host <br/>
is John Daly. They have a fourth panelist, who changes, and occasional  other <br/>
guest panelists.<br/>
 <br/>
Dorothy Kilgallen was a very successful journalist who died under very  <br/>
mysterious circumstances, possibly related to the deaths of Kennedy and Marilyn  <br/>
Monroe.<br/>
 <br/>
At one point they had a contestant who was a black criminal court judge in  <br/>
NYC in the 60&#39;s. I googled him, and it turned out that later he became one of  <br/>
the first black cabinet members under Nixon, and ran HUD. He eventually left  <br/>
that position under scandal.<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s tons more (including seeing some very famous celebrities when they  <br/>
were extremely young...like Dick Van Dyke when he was starring in Bye, Bye  <br/>
Birdie on Broadway), but it seems like such a cool way to learn all kinds of  <br/>
stuff, and the three of us have just been eating this up.  <br/>
 <br/>
Ah, Television and a net-wired laptop... who needs school?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890364320">I watched that show lots as a kid.   I had no idea WHY the people were famous <br/>
who were on the panel, but that&#39;s how it was with most celebrity panels--I <br/>
was too young to know what they had done before Hollywood Squares or whatever.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I remember a few things on there that were really &quot;educational&quot; for me--one <br/>
was a mountain climber, and they were asking really good questions of him about <br/>
the realities of high altitude stuff and climbing gear, and one of the false <br/>
line-up guys was really hesitant.   All the others had quick answers, but that <br/>
didn&#39;t mean TRUE answers.   <br/>
<br/>
It was fun for me not only to hear the trivia and see that (in those days <br/>
more easily than now) someone could be pretty famous and still have an unknown   <br/>
face and voice, but it was fun to see how people moved and acted and how their <br/>
eyes were when they were nervous, faking/acting, puzzled, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
The closest to a home game of this for us has been playing dictionary, where <br/>
people make up dictionary definitions, and they&#39;re all read by whoever&#39;s &quot;it.&quot; <br/>
  It&#39;s only a pale version, because the person who is &quot;it&quot; gets more points <br/>
if you don&#39;t pick the true definition (and she knows which one is the true one) <br/>
so she needs to try to read all the others convincingly.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;What&#39;s My Line,&quot; where people made money if they could bluff the <br/>
panelists to choose them, was really a fascinationg set-up.    Very cool that it&#39;s <br/>
still being shown some!<br/>
