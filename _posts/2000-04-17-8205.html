<div id="ygrps-yiv-709250814">And here&#39;s another comment, FWIW :)<br/>
<br/>
When my sons were in their mid teens, we were stationed at Fort Hood, in TX.  <br/>
My older son had taken Tae Kwon Do before our move to Ft Hood, but couldn&#39;t <br/>
resume after the move.  My younger son had never really found a group he felt <br/>
comfortable in.  So for a while, both of them were house potatoes--we never <br/>
watched much TV, but they spent lots of time in their rooms reading.<br/>
<br/>
My older one got motivated out of the house when an opportunity opened up for <br/>
him to work as a summer hire in the mail room on Ft Hood.  He enjoyed being a <br/>
valued part of a team so much that when the money ran out, he went back as a <br/>
volunteer.  He eventually worked about 45 hours a week, until he joined the <br/>
Army, taking no holidays and only one sick day.  I never would have thought <br/>
he would be interested in such a mundane, dull job--but he was important to <br/>
them, without him they couldn&#39;t have done as good a job, so he stuck with it. <br/>
 He ended up training the new people when they came in, who were always at <br/>
least a couple years older, and sometimes had several years in the Army <br/>
before arriving.<br/>
<br/>
I finally talked my younger son (then 14) to work in the volunteer center on <br/>
post, doing data entry on an important data base that had been trashed by <br/>
accident.  He started out working about 10 hours a week, but slowly expanded <br/>
until he was doing 20-30 on that project, working as an office assistant and <br/>
later almost the office manager, helping to maintain, debug, and otherwise <br/>
assist all the other computer users in the building, and then was invited to <br/>
be a &#39;Teen Trainer&#39; in a pilot program--they thought he was already 15 even <br/>
though he was small for his age :)  He ended up organizing and chairing <br/>
meetings, setting agendas, and giving classes, in addition to the office <br/>
responsibilities he had.  In addition, the data base he set up was copied by <br/>
other similar organizations throughout the Army, and he wrote a couple <br/>
articles for a national publication serving those organizations.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that hard to get a teen out of the home and in the real world, IF <br/>
you are willing to scout out some opportunities that might interest them.  My <br/>
younger son would never have gone to work at that place if computers hadn&#39;t <br/>
lured him out; my older son was motivated by money at first.  Later both <br/>
discovered the value of being an important member of a team.  And both (gotta <br/>
brag :) won awards for what they did.<br/>
<br/>
In looking at their situations, the most important thing was that I didn&#39;t <br/>
focus my efforts on finding something for them to do with their age peers.  <br/>
Instead, I found things for them to do which followed what they were most <br/>
interested in at the time.  Then, they found friends, skills, and <br/>
opportunities that kept them enthused and motivated.  And it&#39;s worth noting <br/>
that I didn&#39;t start out with kids who were super extroverted and used to <br/>
doing things outside the home.  Aside from Tae Kwon Do, my older son spent <br/>
most of his time in his room before working as a summer hire.  My younger son <br/>
repeatedly tried to make friends with age peers and failed, until he became <br/>
involved in that program.  If I had waited until they decided to look outside <br/>
the home, they might still be here.  It&#39;s hard being a teen today, there&#39;s so <br/>
few places where teens are trusted with any responsibility at all.  It will <br/>
often take a parent willing to make a few promises and guarantees before <br/>
opportunities come open.<br/>
