<div id="ygrps-yiv-1626557716">Is there anyone on this list in West Virginia?  Is it possible to <br/>
unschool in this state?  I understand there is annual testing there.  We <br/>
may be moving within the next two years and my husband suggested 2 <br/>
states.  West Virginia is very attractive to us because of the very low <br/>
cost of land there.<br/>
