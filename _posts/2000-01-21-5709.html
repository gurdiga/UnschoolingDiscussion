<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683170100">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
In CA - Solano County (half-way bewtween Sacramento & San Francisco), we<br/>
had a lot of clouds,  but they parted enough for us to see the last<br/>
half (or less) of the eclipse.  I had hoped to watch the whole thing,<br/>
but as we are desperately in need of rain, I won&#39;t complain!!<br/>
<br/>
As far as socialization is concerned, I have a suggestion that has<br/>
worked great for our dgs (dear grand son!! 6 yo). He attends his<br/>
Sunday School class (since an infant) and children&#39;s church on Sunday<br/>
mornings (since he was 3), Children&#39;s activities on Sunday evenings and<br/>
on Wednesday he has another children&#39;s activity to attend.  That&#39;s three<br/>
different groups each week.  He has made friends that he will grow up<br/>
with - all attend the same church.  He has grown close to several of the<br/>
adults - the teachers, helpers, etc. - and I think children do need<br/>
some friendships with adults other than family.  <br/>
<br/>
And, I have a plus, as there are several members who are school<br/>
teachers and they seem to be very glad to answer questions I<br/>
have regarding how to present different subjects to my dgs.  My<br/>
own private &quot;support group&quot; - so to speak!<br/>
<br/>
We did try a gymnastic class for him, but he felt uncomfortable among<br/>
children and teachers that he did not know.  And,,,he loves to do<br/>
gymnastics.  <br/>
<br/>
Enjoy all the list and the sharing that goes on here.<br/>
<br/>
