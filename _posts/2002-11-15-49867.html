Funny story. We have a six degrees of separation thing between my daughter <br/>
and my husband. Turns out that my husband&#39;s sister was married to a guy who <br/>
was best friends with my daughter&#39;s father&#39;s sister&#39;s 1st husband! Did you <br/>
follow that one?<br/>
<br/>
Thing is my husband and I were together for years before finding out. It was <br/>
my daughter&#39;s 8th grade graduation dinner and our chosen table consisted of <br/>
myself and my husband, my SIL, her ex husband, and my ex husband. My now SIL <br/>
also knows my ex SIL and one thing led to another and BAM, the connection!! <br/>
It was too funny as I knew my ex SIL&#39;s 1st husband too. My husband and I <br/>
were a lot closer way back when then we realized!!!!<br/>
