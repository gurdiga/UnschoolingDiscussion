<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298799903">I&#39;ve been on this list for short while trying to gleam some insight into unschooling.  I have a friend that &quot;does it&quot; and her kids are always doing the most interesting things and I just don&#39;t know how to &quot;make&quot; my kids have more interests.  If I let them be, they just play barbies all the time.  (they are girls 9 and 7).  BUT after taking a couple months off at<br/>
 &quot;school&quot; as my friend suggested. They finally stopped playing barbies once I got K&#39;nex out.  They started building kits from the book for about a week then started making up their own models.  I was amazed, that my &quot;uninteresting&quot; kids are being creative.  THEN out of curiosity, I gave a copy of Home Training Tools to my 91/2 yr daughter and just asked her to look through it and see if anything is interesting to her.  I was SHOCKED!!  She practically begged for a disecting kit.  &quot;You&#39;re kidding!&quot; I thought.  Now that&#39;s something I would NEVER have picked out for her.  I told my husband and he was excited and said he wants to do it with her.  She also said she&#39;s interested in robots but wants to spend her own money on it.  Now my youngest, I did the same with her and she has expensive taste.  I had to read the catalog to her but she really wants a rock tumbler, stereoscope, and a dinsaur replica to build.  I just have to say, I am blown away.  Now if I could only get my youngest to read!!  Life would be easier.  <br/>

 If you leave your youngest to read when the time is right you&#39;ll be blown <br/>
away again!<br/>
<br/>
I loved the post but the end made me think your revelation wasn&#39;t yet <br/>
illuminating your whole life with kids! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Once it starts working, let it work!<br/>
<br/>
And the kids don&#39;t necessarily need bought kits to learn in surprising ways, <br/>
so don&#39;t just wait for the order to come in, but start to give them other <br/>
things, ideas, and opportunities.<br/>
