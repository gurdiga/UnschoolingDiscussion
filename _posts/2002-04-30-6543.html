&lt;&lt; If a man was beaten as a child and grows up to beat his own children,<br/>
does he have a valid reason?   Is that nature or character choice?  Do we<br/>
try to understand it?    &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If his mother was beaten by his good Christian father who forced him to go to <br/>
church, and he grew up and married a girl chosen by his parents and her <br/>
parents, and they tell them NEVER, under any circumstances, can they divorce, <br/>
and he beats her because the parents never let him associate with anyone <br/>
outside the family because of their evil influence and he had no other role <br/>
models, THEN was he &quot;born Christian&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Are people just BORN Jewish?<br/>
YES by God!  &lt;G&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then is no one born Christian?  Not Catholics who baptize infants?  <br/>
<br/>
Christianity isnt&#39; genetic.<br/>
<br/>
Is Hinduism?  Is Islam inborn to 20th-generation Arabs?<br/>
<br/>
When does the choice wear off and the genetic component kick in?<br/>
<br/>
Does culture count?  <br/>
<br/>
If a boy&#39;s grandparents on four sides were Eagle scouts and his dad too and <br/>
his dad&#39;s a state BSA leader and the boy is an Eagle Scout, is that a Good <br/>
Thing, but his neighbor who&#39;s dad is the grand dragon of the Alabama KKK (or <br/>
whatever all the terminology would be) and he was taught to honor his father <br/>
and his mother and believes that anglo-saxon offspring are the TRUE <br/>
Israelites and chosen of God, he is a Bad Thing?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My head hurts. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My head stopped hurting years ago. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
But it seems imperative upon me to help other people&#39;s heads hurt from time <br/>
to time.<br/>
