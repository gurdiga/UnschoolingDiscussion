&lt;&lt; Proverbs 29:15 The rod of correction imparts wisdom, but achild left to<br/>
 himself disgraces his mother.<br/>
 Thanks Johanna for the scriptures, I thought I would add a couple more.  If<br/>
 any are interested... a book called, &quot;What the Bible says about Child<br/>
 Training&quot; is very good about detailing the parents responsibility and<br/>
 explains the &quot;rod&quot;, &quot;chastisement&quot;, &quot;discipline&quot;.  The author of the book is<br/>
 J. Richard Fugate.<br/>
 I recieved spankings as a child.  I do not remember the spankings , but I do<br/>
 remember the negative comments made by authority figures.  The verbal scars<br/>
 wound far deeper than any spanking can.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
   And all other rod writings. The shepard&#39;s rod is used to guide his sheep <br/>
not inflict pain. If a shepard hit his sheep w/ a rod they would run off. I <br/>
live in the world&#39;s second largest area for sheep herding for their wool <br/>
(Australia is now #1) I haev watched the herders for 7 years now every spring <br/>
thru fall. They do not hit the sheep they wave a rod or rope and use the dogs <br/>
the guide the sheep for hundreds of miles each year. <br/>
<br/>
   This biblical take some have on the rod is fallacy. I believe it was meant <br/>
as a metaphor for guiding our children kindly and firmly if need be. Not as a <br/>
permission slip to hit or spank our children. Is this respectful? Our <br/>
children need our love, guidence, redirection, and nurturing  along the way. <br/>
Not corporal punishment.<br/>
<br/>
   For those who do believe in spanking,how do you feel when you spank your <br/>
child? Is it a matter of fact thing? Like,ok you my dear son have disobeyed <br/>
me and it is time for a spanking. Or are you spanking and feeling angry for <br/>
the disobedience? Do you feel sad or upset w/ having to spank your child? <br/>
Disappointed? Or truely feel justified?<br/>
<br/>
   Redirection when they are young and explaining dangers when a bit older <br/>
work wonderfully. Granted there are times they aren&#39;t going to listen and <br/>
scar you to death like running for the street. But is spanking them really <br/>
going to fix this? I do not believe so. It teaches children to learn how not <br/>
to get caught doing wrong things. Creates sneakiness and parent wise kids. <br/>
<br/>
   My mother didn&#39;t believe in spanking but when I provoked her to anger she <br/>
certainly left mantal scars by words and physical punishment. She left raised <br/>
red handmarks flicked my face for smart mouthing,kicked the shit out of me <br/>
for running away and sneaking out w/ boys. She took away priviledges and TV <br/>
or grounded me. What did it accomplish? I learned how to sneak around even <br/>
better,I also became a people pleaser. Even to this day I fight this <br/>
tendancy. I find myself cleaning the house like a mad woman when dh and I <br/>
fight b/c I know he likes a clean house. Normally I would say oh well <br/>
tomorrow I may clean if I have time and he would be fine w/ it also. But my <br/>
fear of not pleasing the one I love makes me kick into child mode. I also <br/>
have a difficult time expressing myself esp. w/ someone whose presence is <br/>
dominant. Actually I am having difficulty right now writing this,afraid to <br/>
speak my mind. But spanking a child is NOT ok w/ me. I struggle w/ my anger <br/>
every day and I feel my mother coming out of me on occaision. I am learning <br/>
to shut my mouth and take a time out. Spanking out of anger or out of duty is <br/>
never ok in my NSHO.Screaming at a child isn&#39;t either or saying nasty <br/>
things,these are all akin to me. So yes I am scarred from my childhood. But I <br/>
am working on it and trying not to blame my mother too much. She was abused <br/>
as a child verbally and physically and it got passed down. I intend to stop <br/>
it at this generation so my grandchildren won&#39;t be on the recieving end some <br/>
day.Treat others as you wish to be treated.<br/>
