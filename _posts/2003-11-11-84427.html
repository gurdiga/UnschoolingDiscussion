<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803523284"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Is your instinct not to put out candy the same instinct that led <br/>
&gt;&gt;you to put out homemade toffee and tell you kids they could not eat<br/>
&gt;&gt;it?  While you describe that as &quot;controlling&quot; and something that you<br/>
&gt;&gt;would never go back to -- is the limit on candy in general<br/>
&gt;&gt;different? I&#39;m genuinely asking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But I don&#39;t see it as a limit, per se, as much as my preferring not<br/>
&gt; to have it around the house all the time.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I keep trying to think of a more polite way to say, &quot;Well, who died and made<br/>
you Empress?&quot; &lt;g&gt; but I&#39;ll have to go with that for now.<br/>
<br/>
What about their preferences?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When the kids have money,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was purely a stay at home Mom, I suppose my husband could have said<br/>
the same thing any time I wanted money for something that he didn&#39;t<br/>
personally feel a need to buy. Wouldn&#39;t have done much for our marriage.<br/>
Doesn&#39;t do much for a parent/child relationship.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But one thing I am trying to do as their mom is<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is nothing that says you can&#39;t show them how to make homemade fries<br/>
AND take their wishes (if they wish for the pre-processed stuff) into<br/>
consideration. It isn&#39;t an either/or scenario.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters, bless them, do not care for my delicious (if I say so myself)<br/>
homemade hamburgers. They politely decline them when I make them. They do<br/>
enjoy a nice McDonald&#39;s burger. It&#39;s their choice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is a fact of life in our family right now, though: tight budget.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Any and all of those &quot;facts of life&quot; can be changed, or solved, or bypassed,<br/>

<br/>
A tight budget means cutting back somewhere else, or finding a way to make<br/>
some extra money, or finding cheap candy sources.<br/>
<br/>
Natural/whole foods/Granola is your thing, not necessarily theirs.<br/>
Respecting other people is all about the differences, not about applauding<br/>

not.<br/>
<br/>
A life in the boonies is a non-issue -- many candies keep a long time. Ditto<br/>
many healthy snacks, including dried fruit (and drying fruit at home is fun,<br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
If the kids have no money are you willing and able to help them figure out<br/>
ways to get money so they can meet their own wants and needs, if you are<br/>
unable or unwilling to do so?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628527338">&lt;&lt; &gt; When the kids have money,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they buy candy, they eat the candy...no comment from me. Go for it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If candy were important to my kids they might buy candy too, with their <br/>
allowance.  They spend their allowance on going to movies, or buying gaming <br/>
materials or music.  Sometimes they save it and take a friend out to eat.  I&#39;d rather <br/>
they bought things like that.<br/>
<br/>
This discussion has slanted over to a focus on a bowl of candy, but if we can <br/>
back up, I think the principle is to provide all kinds of food (including <br/>
candy) in a casual way so that they truly can be making a choice.   And when that <br/>
availability is long-term casual, candy loses value and loses glory.  If <br/>
candy is occasional and special and forbidden and valuable-reward at the same <br/>
time, and shamed bad-habit all at once, it become more than it&#39;s worth.   When <br/>
it&#39;s just there, getting dusty or moldy (depending on climate) it&#39;s not much more <br/>
valuable than paper napkins or table knives.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually it wouldn&#39;t be worth kids spending allowance on.   <br/>
<br/>
I had some homemade bread last week and offered to make Holly French toast <br/>
one morning when she said she wanted something different to eat for breakfast.  <br/>
I don&#39;t really love French toast, but we had extra eggs and this bread was <br/>
perfect for it, but Holly said, &quot;No thanks, I&#39;m not in the mood for something <br/>
sweet.&quot;   We did cream cheese on toast instead.   But that&#39;s typical here, that <br/>
the kids prefer something other than sweets.<br/>
<br/>
Last night Kirby and I were going to watch the tape of last week&#39;s 24, which <br/>
we just hadn&#39;t gotten to yet.  We were both putzing around trying to settle <br/>
and he said from the next room, &quot;I found the tape.  And a big bag of candy!&quot;  I <br/>
said that was Rhiannon and Norma&#39;s leftover Hallowe&#39;en candy they had brought <br/>
over for us.  &quot;Oh!&quot; he said happily.  But he didn&#39;t eat any of the candy.   <br/>
Just looked in the bag.  And it was quite an assortment.  But he didn&#39;t want <br/>
candy, he wanted to watch 24.<br/>
<br/>
These stories are lame and boring except as snapshots of kids in the same <br/>
room as candy they&#39;re able to take or leave.  Leave is common.<br/>

to keep homemade things more readily available. Running twenty <br/>
minutes to buy (pretty expensive, small town grocery store) candy <br/>
when it runs out. That is no more in the budget than little trays of <br/>
Lindt truffles, you know?<br/>

frozen fries aren&#39;t something I habitually buy (frozen fries; frozen <br/>
pot pies; pre-fab food at all, pretty much. I prefer scratch; my kids <br/>
like the food I make. I also have mac and cheese in a box in my <br/>
pantry, because they like that, too...) I don&#39;t deny them the foods <br/>
they want, but in this family&#39;s life, lots of processed food isn&#39;t a <br/>
reality. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>actually, these things feature very large right now. My husband <br/>
bought 14 bags of candy at the dollar store...amounting to probably <br/>
four pounds total (smallish bags from the dollar store...very cheap. <br/>
The dollar store is a 60 minute drive from here, btw.)<br/>
<br/>
It is now less than one week later, and that candy is GONE. I found <br/>
some candy at the &quot;very cheap&quot; grocery store, valentine&#39;s and easter <br/>
candies packaged up together, on Saturday. GONE. On Saturday, we also <br/>
bought two pounds of Brach&#39;s candy. Gone. Obviously, my kids eat all <br/>
the candy all gone, really fast. I&#39;m confident that, if we could do <br/>
it, and we did provide candy along with all the other food that is <br/>
available, they&#39;d eventually have enough and the bowl would sit half <br/>
empty for long periods of time.<br/>
<br/>
MY point is: the cheap candy is an HOUR away. It really is an issue, <br/>
this life in the boonies. It&#39;s more economical for me to give the <br/>
kids their allowance and then make a trip to the little store that&#39;s <br/>
15 minutes away for them to buy whatever they can afford, and restock <br/>
when we make our bi-monthly run to the bigger, cheaper, grocery <br/>
stores. As with the fruit I buy, which disappears pretty quickly, <br/>
when it&#39;s out...it&#39;s out until I can get to town again (in a couple <br/>
of weeks).<br/>

this thread. It&#39;s making me THINK...this list makes me think. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing I would like to offer for discussion.  Do you think it makes a <br/>
difference about candy if the children are &quot;older&quot;.  Six year olds vs say ten or <br/>
fifteen year olds?<br/>
<br/>
We have always had a candy bowl/basket around the house, always, even when <br/>
the children were little.  While a new addition might spark a momentary <br/>
interest, for the most part it sits untouched until one of the neighbor children or <br/>
one of their friends drops by and decides to have some.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest boy who doesn&#39;t live at home often gets a gallon ziploc bag and <br/>
fills it up to take home.  His girlfriend LOVES candy, he enjoys it to a lesser <br/>
extent and hey, it&#39;s FREE here.<br/>
<br/>
But I do think younger children would be more inclined to be excited or <br/>
enticed by a candy bowl than older children to some extent but I might be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?  Does age also play into the excitement of candy as much <br/>
as the availability of it does?<br/>
<br/>
I know the neighborhood children get VERY excited about digging into the <br/>
candy bowl here but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the age or because it&#39;s not the same <br/>
kinds they have at home or if it&#39;s because I simply don&#39;t care if they eat <br/>
themselves sick on it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Generally kids eat sugar coated cereal that adults don&#39;t. I would bet that<br/>
the number of kids who love Capt Crunch is closer to the number of adults<br/>
who are repulsed by it rather than vice versa. My guess that it has to do<br/>
with kid biology craving high calorie foods because they&#39;re growing so fast.<br/>
Just a guess.<br/>

That sounds VERY GOOD!  *drool*<br/>
<br/>
And, I love knowing what goes into my sweets, instead<br/>
of the preservatives, etc.  And the basic ingrediants<br/>
you mentioned can be stocked up on, cheap.  <br/>
<br/>
And the kids learn where FOOD actually comes from. <br/>
Like, how you make caramel, and the different ways to<br/>
make it, is what Alex and I have been having fun with.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
He heated up just plain brown sugar til it was melted<br/>
and at a high temp, turned hard automatically. That<br/>
was fun to clean,NOT! Next time we added corn syrup<br/>
and butter, hehehe, much better.  Then we turned that<br/>
into fudge sauce, white sugar instead and with lots of<br/>
cocoa. Now we&#39;re playing with the temperature, ie soft<br/>
ball stage, hard ball stage, etc.   <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s that saying, better living thru chemistry?  Who<br/>
needs drugs? lol Play with candy instead! <br/>
