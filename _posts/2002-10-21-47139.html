<div id="ygrps-yiv-78084325">I am extracting the following comments from Sheila&#39;s post...these are <br/>
not my words:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It will, someday, when Jesus comes back and the tribulation period <br/>
is <br/>
over. :)<br/>
<br/>
Our children don&#39;t belong to us, they belong to God. They were <br/>
loaned to us by Him, and He commanded us to raise them for Him, with <br/>
love and compassion and mercy. There are a lot of parents who don&#39;t <br/>
do a lot of things right. Still, those children belong with their <br/>
parents, because that&#39;s where God has placed them. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering Sheila, the way you state this as fact, if you are <br/>
considering the wide range of beliefs at this board.<br/>
To me it is disrespectful to state your beliefs as fact when you are <br/>
well aware that there are atheists, pagans, buddhists etc....on a <br/>
list.<br/>
I have no problem with someone saying &quot;I believe that......&quot; blah, <br/>
blah, blah.<br/>
But to state your own personal religious views as a fact bugs me.<br/>
<br/>
I think about someone here saying &quot;well, your children have evolved <br/>
from apes, so it makes sense that.....&quot;  or &quot;There will be world <br/>
peace when the great Goddess _____is made powerful by our wicca <br/>
ceremony&quot; as though it were fact.<br/>
It might bother you.<br/>
I think we should state our beliefs as our own and not assume anyone <br/>
else here automatically agrees.<br/>
<br/>
It hugely bothers me, to say &quot;that is where God placed them&quot; as <br/>
though God willy nilly places children with some horrid abusive <br/>
parent.<br/>
NO! I will never believe they are there because some mean spirited <br/>
God put them there. People have children that were never meant to, <br/>
people abuse children that don&#39;t ever deserve any of it.<br/>
God doesn&#39;t do it, humans do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I find that religious beliefs contrary to mine are presented on this <br/>
board all the time.  Things like &quot;My child must have had 200 <br/>
reincarnations&quot; or various statements from the Continuum Concept <br/>
assuming evolution is true or even &quot;I don&#39;t think there will ever be <br/>
world peace&quot; are all coming at it from a world view that is, <br/>
essentially religious in some sense.  Statements supporting humanism <br/>
and eastern religions are very common on this board, so why not <br/>
Christian views too? <br/>
