&lt;&lt;  The media producers and advertisers are majorly<br/>
invested in us/our children spending as much time in front of their<br/>
adverstisements as possible.   Do we simply allow our children to be fed<br/>
this stuff? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kid aren&#39;t deciding what they want to do based on its advertising.  Some <br/>
toys are played with one day, even though the advertising was great!   Mine <br/>
still play original nintendo even though it hasn&#39;t been marketted for ten <br/>
years or so.  Who told them to do that?  They did it because it was fun.  And <br/>
they did it even though they have flashier, newer &quot;cooler&quot; stuff in the house.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;At any rate,  this state of consciousness,  with its low level of <br/>
awareness,  seems<br/>
decidedly unhealthy to stay in for prolonged periods.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why?<br/>
And low level of awareness of WHAT exactly?  They&#39;re aware of a great deal.  <br/>
What they&#39;re doing is so interesting that outside conversation is an <br/>
interruption.<br/>
<br/>
I could see, if I were an immature and jealous mom, wanting them to think I <br/>
was more interesting than anything else.  When they were little, I pretty <br/>
much was.  But people grow and change.  If I want to get their attention I <br/>
need to actually be saying something important or attractive.  And what I do <br/>
is ask them to let me know when they come to a pausing place or a commercial, <br/>
if they&#39;re involved in a show or game.  Even if Holly&#39;s playing Barbies, <br/>
there are moments when she needs to finish the action or set-up she&#39;s on <br/>
before paying attention to something else.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In regard to video games.....I wonder if studies have been done.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re just not living our lives by other people&#39;s studies and predictions.   <br/>
If a study told me how much time to read and how much driving around is too <br/>
much and how long reading to Holly at night and sleeping with her if she <br/>
wanted was &quot;right,&quot; why would they know?  What would be their own prejudices <br/>
and basis of analysis and methodology?  <br/>
<br/>
I do know because I&#39;m there and seeing and discussing and helping that my <br/>
kids have learned lots from just about everything they&#39;ve ever done or seen <br/>
in their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s because of my attitude toward them and learning more than the <br/>
actual materials or activities.  Maybe because I didn&#39;t pre-judge the things <br/>
to be bad, and pre-conceive what &quot;balance&quot; would be it&#39;s working out well <br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
I do have the advantage of having started early with kids who hadn&#39;t gone to <br/>
school.  And there are people here reading who are in that same situation.  I <br/>
think some of the limiting parents do is like school and because of <br/>
school--at least the school models in the parents&#39; heads.  They think school <br/>
learning has to look like and be like school, and they value school-learning <br/>
(subject areas) over what they see as playing.<br/>
<br/>
Many people don&#39;t honestly believe that learning can come from play.<br/>
That  makes it really hard to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
And even new age health folk have &quot;sins&quot; to consider.  It seems this <br/>
beta-wave state is a state of sin to some here.<br/>
<br/>
Is sleeping sin?  Do you limit your children&#39;s sleep to 8 hours a day?  Even <br/>
babies and toddlers?  Even teenaged boys?  How&#39;s the brain wave while <br/>
sleeping?  (I already know; was hoping others would consider it, though, and <br/>
remember what temporary insanities can be induced by lack of sleep.)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder what brain wave state dancers and jocks are in?  It&#39;s not possible <br/>
to check them with today&#39;s equipment, because they&#39;re moving during that <br/>
activity, and this culture with it&#39;s work ethic values movement over being <br/>
still.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You can color me immature and jealous.  My husband&#39;s hockey game on the PC is my<br/>
bitter rival!  (It crashes when he pauses it, so he caters to it and expects me<br/>
to be robust and understanding and patient.  Arggghhh!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How much time to read, to drive or to sleep together depends on the individuals<br/>
in the situation.  There isn&#39;t one scientific answer -- and if there was, it<br/>
would be a meaningless average.  So, we can&#39;t prescribe the right amount for<br/>
others, can we?<br/>
