&gt; Hi Buzz,<br/>
&gt; What are serive berries?  I am from NJ and have never heard of these.  Are<br/>
&gt; they like blueberries?  They grow on bushes in NJ.<br/>

I&#39;m not kidding!<br/>
They taste like a cross between a black currant and a blueberry. They<br/>
are rather pithy and need to be softened first for pies and cobblers<br/>
etc.<br/>

They can get as large as the end of your thumb or be quite small like a<br/>
currant.<br/>
