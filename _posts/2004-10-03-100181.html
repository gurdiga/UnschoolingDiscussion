<div id="ygrps-yiv-991661074">Karen (4.9) also loves to switch things around.  Her favorite game is <br/>
&quot;Opposite Day.&quot;  Everything gets turned around.  When we first <br/>
started playing just answers and directions were opposite, now she <br/>
also changes nouns.  Get the milk from the frig, turns into, Don&#39;t <br/>
put the bike into the dishwasher.  Makes getting dinner ready a real <br/>
challenge!<br/>

Re: Pool rules wrong was software<br/>

I was just thinking of this story!  My almost 3 yr. old as a book of<br/>
Football Opposites (Wide/Narrow; Above/Below; Full/Empty, etc.) and<br/>
lately he has taken great joy--glee, even--in reading it &quot;wrong!&quot; <br/>
Sometimes he has to take a minute to &#39;get it&#39; the right way in his<br/>
head before he can verbally switch it, but you can totally see that <br/>
he<br/>
knows the full equipment box is really full--it just makes the book<br/>
much more interesting and funny to point at it and say &quot;EMPTY!&quot;<br/>
