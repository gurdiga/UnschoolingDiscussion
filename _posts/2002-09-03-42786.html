&gt; Dear Robin,<br/>
&gt; Yes, you probably will be the one doing the reading. That&#39;s okay. I do <br/>
&gt; wonder <br/>
&gt; about these &quot;conditions&quot; though. The one thing about unschooling I have <br/>
&gt; tried <br/>
&gt; to stress to Darin is that the kids will learn better this way (as opposed <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; the rigors of a ps curriculum.) but for him not to expect them to pick up a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; math book or ask for a history book. He says he understands, but I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; think he does..............<br/>
&gt; I have tried to get him to read books on the subject, then I tried to get <br/>
&gt; him <br/>
&gt; to &quot;Just read this chapter honey!&quot; then I tried reading whatever paragraph <br/>
&gt; had just struck me as an extraordinarily, eye-opening, what ever idea I <br/>
&gt; thought just might help him *get it*. I&#39;m going to try tapes next. He likes <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; books on tape so maybe this will work! Someone else telling him what I have <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; been saying all along, in their words. I think, over the years, he has come <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to accept it though. He knows the kids are smart. He is just so impressed <br/>
&gt; with the way Moly had taken to reading, and is always asking about what she <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is reading. But I am sure if there were worksheets with big gold stars, all <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; over the fridge, he would be more comfortable. Marrying me has definitely <br/>
&gt; put <br/>
&gt; Darin outside his comfort zone! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My best advice is, be gentle with it. For many people the idea of <br/>
&gt; unschooling <br/>
&gt; takes time.......<br/>
&gt; Good Luck!<br/>
&gt; ~Nancy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks, Nancy.  Your husband sounds a bit like mine.  You know, he just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>wants his children to be okay and knows the way he knows.  Fortunately, the <br/>
learning objectives are vague enough the first few yeaers...and I&#39;m trying to <br/>
be aware of open moments like when my daughter was all excited about a new <br/>
video coming out on a specific date and we talked about calenders and bought <br/>
a calender and put the date in.  If she&#39;s willing, I thought we might plan <br/>
our week together.  If not, I&#39;ll plan on my calender in her presence.  So the <br/>
&quot;list&quot; is in my mind and hopefully the &quot;pressure&quot; will be mine, not hers.  I <br/>
just cannot see forcing a child to learn something for the sake of making an <br/>
adult feel... whatever, so there&#39;s my pressure....hopefully by the time the <br/>
objectives list gets more specific, we will be in a different place ( or <br/>
maybe the CAT scores....a standardized test is required by VA as proof of <br/>
learning ) will become sufficient in and of itself.  Just wish the pressure <br/>
wasn&#39;t there....and hope it doesn&#39;t spill over.  My husband has gone along <br/>
with alot of things outside his comfort zone becasue of my beliefs...and I&#39;m <br/>
grateful for that.  Just wish.......<br/>

       Testing is not the only way to demonstrate achievement in VA. In <br/>
addition, your child/children can be evaluated by &quot;someone acceptable to your <br/>
ps system&quot; or you can provide a portfolio. <br/>
       Admittedly this is a stressor for me also. The past two years my <br/>
children have taken the SAT. They hate it. I didn&#39;t know an evaluator, so I <br/>
took the easy way out (for me only). I have yet to find an evaluator, but I <br/>
plan to present the question to the VA Eclectic list that we both participate <br/>
on. My children hate testing, especially Eric. I do also. There is an <br/>
alternative; I just have to put forth a more concerted effort to find an <br/>
unschooling friendly evaluator.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Ginny,<br/>
I probably should have said that it was my choice (for now) of evaluations.  <br/>
Actually I did post a question about the portfolio evaluation and was kind of <br/>
scared away form it.  Seems that evaluators  and the county I live in tend to <br/>
be very SOL &quot;oriented&quot; when evaluating....expecting the portfolios to reflect <br/>
the SOLs (Standards of LEarning).  So what do you do.....Let them nit-pick or <br/>
take the test? Fortunately, we don&#39;t have to be concerned about it yet since <br/>
my children are so young.  I hope you can find an acceptable solution...maybe <br/>
&quot;things&quot; are more easy going in your county.  Have you tried the CAT...heard <br/>
it has been the test of choice for quite a few families.  Can take it at home <br/>
and test results delivered to you (through Seton, I think)...but you may <br/>
already know this.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also thinking that it might be difficult to have a portfolio that <br/>
reflects what we&#39;re doing because we&#39;re doing a lot of experiental <br/>
learning....playing store today.  I wonder if a parent journal of activities <br/>
would be accepted....but, you know, something really bothers me about someone <br/>
else critiqueing our daily activities.  <br/>
<br/>
This accountablility stuff is really irritating me...I am accountable to the <br/>
state for what children learn and when? ROAR!!!!!!!<br/>

fulfills the purpose of allowing me to unschool in peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276044327">In regard to the portfolio issue, what exactly does the state say should be <br/>
in the portfolio? I have always found it best to give only what is asked for <br/>
and no more. Some people try to be so compliant and I believe that only <br/>
makes things worse for us homeschoolers in general. The more you give, the <br/>
more they will eventually ask for.<br/>
<br/>
Here in FL, I know many people who turn in portfolio&#39;s with mostly pictures <br/>
of where they went and what their children do. I have seen portfolio&#39;s with <br/>
hardly any written work in them at all. Finding an unschooling friendly <br/>
evaluator would of course help. Do you have a local support group who could <br/>
refer some to you?<br/>

still don&#39;t understand this.  Why do we submit if it violates our conscience <br/>

but not an exemption of consciencious objection.) If a portfolio would be <br/>
accepted as given on *my* terms (as Sandra described), I would have less of a <br/>
problem with the whole thing; but I would still have personal objections <br/>
because of the general idea of being accountable to strangers for my <br/>
children...we are not talking abuse here.  Beyond that, if it could be <br/>
accepted, the type of portfolio just described by Sandra would be better for <br/>
my children(I can only speak for my self) than the test.  Then they are out <br/>

work for me.  The question is.... if accepted.<br/>

&gt; Here in FL, I know many people who turn in portfolio&#39;s with mostly pictures <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of where they went and what their children do. I have seen portfolio&#39;s with <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hardly any written work in them at all. Finding an unschooling friendly <br/>
&gt; evaluator would of course help. Do you have a local support group who could <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; refer some to you?<br/>

(Standards of LEarning). He does interview the children as part of his <br/>
evaluation. You can contact me personally if you want more info.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Virginia state notice that I am here and demand the NOI and all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other hoops I have no problem with purchasing a test, filling it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself, getting a score and turning that it in to the county. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; county are happy that they have a number and I&#39;m happy that my kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t get tested.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So did you do this or just thinking of it? My son doesn&#39;t &quot;test well&quot;.<br/>
&gt; They probably don&#39;t look at the previous year&#39;s results, but what if I<br/>
&gt; did something like that and they did check. How would you distinquish<br/>
&gt; between different children&#39;s results without stating such? This is<br/>
&gt; such a PITA! There has to be a better solution.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t done it cos VA still doesn&#39;t know I&#39;m here. Seton send <br/>
each child a seperate CAT test so you just write the child&#39;s name <br/>
on it, fill ina % of the circles correctly yourself, being careful to get <br/>
the score just over the required 23 percentile and Seton mark it for <br/>
you and you get a piece of paper with your child&#39;s name and a <br/>
score to make the county happy.<br/>
It isn&#39;t strictly 100% legal I would imagine but the county&#39;s main <br/>
concern is to get a piece of paper with a number on it every year. <br/>
They never question further than that and you are left in peace.<br/>
