How sad that people are so depressed about spending time with their children. <br/>
 So many businesses were also closed.  You would think parents would be happy <br/>
to have an extra day to go sledding and drink hot chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
I am just so lucky to be able to spend time with my wonderful boys every day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-827491142">That is so sad, isn&#39;t it.  Kind of like that Staples back to school<br/>
commercial where the parents are elated that the kids are going back.  Makes<br/>
me sad, really sad.  When my kids see something like that on TV, I have to<br/>
explain to them that some people actually feel that way, because they always<br/>
look confused.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909858443">It irks me too.  My sister (she is a single parent of 2) is like that though.  She has 2 children and she acts like she hates weekends because they are home together.  We also got BIG SNOW and she keeps calling me saying she is going to go bonkers if she can not get the kids to the sitter. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651925998"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;she acts like she hates weekends because they are home together.  We also <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s because the kids are in school and both she and they <br/>
have to deal with implicied expectations that some unschoolers dont...  I <br/>
mean, she might have to feel that she meets the other school mom&#39;s <br/>
expectations of &#39;being overwhelmed&#39; by her kids and needing a break.  That <br/>
maybe, if she isn&#39;t absolutely exhausted by her kids, that there&#39;s <br/>
something wrong with them, or they&#39;re not bright and inquisitive, or she <br/>
doesn&#39;t have a &#39;full&#39; life.  By the same token, her kids maybe feel they <br/>
should be &#39;acting out&#39; or be boistrous to get her attention...<br/>
I wonder...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I never understood that concept, when I had four children in PS, the absolute <br/>
worst day of the year for me was the first day of school, every single year, <br/>
I would just cry and cry.  I hated the concept of &quot;turning them over&quot; to this <br/>
unknown entity that wanted to seem like they knew best for my precious <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I so regret not finding &quot;mainstream&quot; homeschooling much sooner.  I LOVE <br/>
having my children home, I LOVE it when my grown children all show up at the <br/>
same time.  They are all precious gifts to me and while they aren&#39;t always <br/>
the sweet darlings I crave, I still want to be with them as much as <br/>
absolutely possible.  We have such a few short years with them anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But the poster is right, I know MANY people who can&#39;t WAIT for school to <br/>
start and dread long weekends or snow days, I wonder why?<br/>
