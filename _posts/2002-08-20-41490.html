&gt; It isn&#39;t about being anti school or advertising home or unschooling just some<br/>
&gt; thought provoking quotes from some well known people that don&#39;t say anything<br/>
&gt; bad about schools at all.<br/>

<br/>
If an unschooling phrase doesn&#39;t say anything bad about schools, it&#39;s not a<br/>
great phrase. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one borrowed from the Negro College Fund:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A Mind is a terrible thing to waste.....in school&quot;<br/>
<br/>
anyway, <br/>
What kinds of thoughts do you want to provoke?<br/>
Also, who are you trying to reach with your message?<br/>
And, what response would you like to get from the readers?<br/>
If we don&#39;t know those things, it&#39;s hard to know what quotes to send.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;I think; therefore I homeschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
PS  In my town, a business opened up right across the street from the big<br/>
middle school. It&#39;s called The Learning House. They teach phonics to all the<br/>
kids (hundreds)  who have not been taught phonics and therefore cannot read<br/>
well. The school also employs Learning House tutors to teach the<br/>
schoolteachers how to teach phonics so there won&#39;t be so many kids who can&#39;t<br/>
read in the schools here.</div>

<br/>
Yeah, Joyce I agree.<br/>
<br/>
As a funny parallel, if someone was starting a campaign extolling the<br/>
benefits of chastity (and I&#39;m sure there are some) I don&#39;t think the<br/>
best place to start would be with the slogan &quot;Sex isn&#39;t so great&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Heck, I don&#39;t think even &quot;Just say &quot;NO&quot;&quot; is much of an encouraging slogan.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Besides which, a lot of the people we might like to convince are totally <br/>
turned off by school-bashing.  I know my husband was.  His school <br/>
experiences were mostly positive, so he didn&#39;t want to hear how bad schools <br/>
are.  What he wanted to hear were the positives about <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling.  That&#39;s what he got from me, and now he&#39;s <br/>
totally in support.<br/>

Do you remember Helen saying clearly and plainly TWICE that she was unwilling <br/>
for this list to be a school-bashing list?<br/>
<br/>
If unschoolers can&#39;t get to the point where they&#39;re not even THINKING about <br/>
school, they will live in the shadow of school every day forever.<br/>
<br/>
We turned away from school and schooling, but you seem to live there, still, <br/>
even though you don&#39;t have any school-age children at home.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about learning, and MOST learning has nothing to do with <br/>
school, and so I think the statement &quot;If an unschooling phrase doesn&#39;t say <br/>
anything bad about schools, it&#39;s not a great phrase. &quot; is counter to the best <br/>
purposes of this list and to helping people live with natural learning in <br/>
peaceful and tranquil surroundings.<br/>
