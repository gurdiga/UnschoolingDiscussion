<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I am a big fan of Star Trek, but have been disappointed in how they<br/>
&gt;portrayed children learning. It didn&#39;t seem vary imaginative of what the<br/>
&gt;future could be. Smaller classes, better teachers, better technology - just<br/>
&gt;what we keep hearing today is needed to improve schools. Deep Space Nine<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;several episodes which showed this kind of school. When we started out, we<br/>
&gt;went through the debate of public school vs private school. As we looked at<br/>
&gt;different schools in the area, we saw that  many of the private schools<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;just better versions of school, and we realized that we didn&#39;t want just a<br/>
&gt;better school, we wanted something that was not school at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I like the Voyager version better. The one little girl born onboard learns<br/>
&gt;more through mentoring/apprentice relationships. She is treated with<br/>
 </span></blockquote>respect<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;and performs real duties. If she has an interest in something, she can<br/>
&gt;pursue it through the ship&#39;s computer or through access to the people who<br/>
&gt;have interest in that subject matter. She is shown learning from various<br/>
&gt;people she comes in contact with and by doing real things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, finally someone who agrees with me!! I feel the exact same way about<br/>
this, but I didn&#39;t know others noticed the way Naomi learned the way I do.<br/>
Star Trek is a little slow to catch onto society changes sometimes, but they<br/>
are doing a very good job with the character or Naomi and how she learns.<br/>
She seems a much more *real* child to me than the children on TNG were. Go<br/>
Star Trek! ;-)<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
