       Hello all!   I had a wonderful vacation, got back yesterday, late.  <br/>
Canada is wonderful, as always!  Swam and ate and rested all week, with a party <br/>
or two thrown in, and the whole family, Canadian and American, was up there.  <br/>
Alex spent the whole time in the water or in the sand, he had his snorkeling <br/>
mask on so often he has a semi-permanent line around his eyes, and he became a <br/>
much stronger swimmer, too.  I wish we had gone on more hikes, but Alex and I <br/>
love the water so much, we couldn&#39;t take the time to get shoes and real <br/>
clothes on!!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everybody who sent suggestions on travel activities.  Alex&#39;s <br/>
favorite was a game where you think of a phrase, and the other person has to start a <br/>
sentence ending with that phrase to make you laugh.  For example, &quot;bowl of <br/>
cereal&quot;and I say, The kitties were swimming in....and he has to say &quot;bowl of <br/>
cereal&quot;.  Of course most of the sentences that cracked him up were fart, pee or <br/>
poo related, but that&#39;s not surprising... lol  <br/>
<br/>
We had a homeschooling discussion while I was up there, and I just want to <br/>
say thank you to everyone who has helped me &quot;live unschooling&quot; so much that I <br/>
didn&#39;t much care when everybody delivered the typical questions that used to <br/>
upset me. Socialization, testing, etc.   I didn&#39;t get defensive or frustrated <br/>
like I used to.  Their doubts don&#39;t trouble me anymore.  Hooray!  And maybe I <br/>
modeled enough respectful interactions with *their* kids to turn a light on in <br/>
their brains?  One can hope.......<br/>
