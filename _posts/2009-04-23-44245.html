<br/>
I don&#39;t think my kids ever used any but they needed &quot;a student ID&quot; to  <br/>
get a bus pass one year, and it couldn&#39;t be &quot;made up.&quot;  So I got state- <br/>
issued ID cards, like a non-driving driver&#39;s license.    Sometimes  <br/>
when they were going to be in public on what was a school day for the  <br/>
public schools, I would send a note on a 3x5 card with my name and  <br/>
phone number, saying they were homeschooled and had pemission to go to  <br/>
the mall (or zoo, or wherever they were going).   It made me feel  <br/>
better that they had them, but nobody ever asked to see them, as far  <br/>
as I remember.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015411786">We have them and I like that my teens have them when they are out and  <br/>
about without me but the only time they&#39;ve showed them to anyone was  <br/>
to get a student discount somewhere.  (the movies I think).<br/>

I read somewhere that it&#39;s a good idea to carry around student ID  <br/>
cards in case you get questioned by a truancy officer or someone - is  <br/>
this true? Have you ever been stopped/questioned and the ID saved the  <br/>
day? If so, what does it need to say - just name, school name, school  <br/>
year, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!   Linda&lt;&lt;<br/>

The store is only two blocks away, but she had never gone alone before. I had always just walked with her or we&#39;d ride up together...today she asked, more as a convenience to me,if she could go on her own( I&#39;m packing for us to head out on a trip tomorrow). She was back in a flash, with out insident, but she said some people where looking at her weird in the shop...and it got us talking about how we should handle it, if she was actually approached, or just questioned about being on her own!   I like the note card idea, she caries a state id in her wallet.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879800804">I make them for my kids and others. Here in California, we homeschool by <br/>
establishing a private school in our home, so we are, legally speaking, <br/>
a private school. We&#39;re not required to follow a curriculum or test or <br/>
give grades or anything like that, but we are, technically, a private <br/>
school. So I make id cards every year. They have a date, a picture, <br/>
name, school name, and on the back it says we&#39;re an independent study <br/>
program and the students have permission to be out in the community <br/>
during conventional school hours.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have used their school id&#39;s to get student discounts.<br/>
<br/>
We had a big Harry Potter day, once, and one of the dads made all of us <br/>
Hogwarts student or faculty ID&#39;s - complete with photos. Shortly after <br/>
that I was flying on an airplane and at the last minute they took my <br/>
carry-on luggage away and put it in with the regular luggage. Problem <br/>
was my ID was in my carry on and by the time I remembered, my luggage <br/>
had been whisked away. All I had was my pretend Hogwarts Professor ID <br/>
card - they TOOK it as a legitimate photo ID and let me on the plane.<br/>

How cool!<br/>
Maybe they figured anyone trying to use a fake ID wouldn&#39;t have seized  <br/>
up on the brilliant idea of it being a Hogwarts Professor, so you must  <br/>
be being honest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112287606">Wow!  I&#39;m feeling lucky to live where I do!  Neither my kids<br/>
nor I have ever seen a truancy officer, much less been <br/>
stopped by one.  The kids go out on their own during school <br/>
hours... we don&#39;t even think about school hours... and rarely <br/>
get questioned about why they are not in school.<br/>
