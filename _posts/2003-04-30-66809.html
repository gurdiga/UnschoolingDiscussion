<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400742418">Hi!!  I thought I already sent this out but I never saw it come up in<br/>
the digests.  So, if it already came up sorry for the repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Rowe conference center can be checked out at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:retreat@...">retreat@...</a><br/>
Sounds a bit like the place people are describing  in Great Barrington.<br/>
Nice camp,with hiking trails, various bunk houses, etc..<br/>
Usually prices for conferences there include housing, vegetarian food,<br/>
and the workshops.  <br/>
<br/>
Also wanted to mention a group I met last year that did a one day<br/>
unschooling workshop in Arlington MA.  Maybe they could be of some help<br/>
or have some ideas to share.  <br/>

Looking forward to meeting others--Sharon :)</div>
