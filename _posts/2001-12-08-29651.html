on this. But I wonder too Sarah. . . if truly left to their own desires about <br/>
things, what the &quot;normal&quot; age range would be for reading. What I did do with <br/>
Lelia was read with her, read road signs with her (because she asked) and we <br/>
would send notes back and forth to each other when I was working at my desk <br/>
and she was playing at hers. We never had anything special really, except <br/>
lots of books around all the time. She started reading pretty well at 8. I <br/>
suspect Quinton will read much earlier, although that is a guess at this <br/>
point, just based on observations. Food for thought though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My experience with reading and unschooled kids is different... almost all<br/>
of the unschooled girls we know have been reading fluently by 6 or 7, and<br/>
by 8 they&#39;ve all been reading books that are well above the traditional<br/>
school expectations. Now, most of the boys haven&#39;t been fluent readers<br/>
until later, say 8 or 9 typically. Of course, there are exceptions, but<br/>
that&#39;s the general trend I&#39;ve seen. The youngest I knew was 2, the oldest<br/>
was 12 or 13 when he started reading.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I only know of one or two unschooled kids who were writing at &quot;grade<br/>
level&quot; when they were 7-9 or so... most seem to pick that up a lot later,<br/>
which seems to be natural to me... schools push writing early because<br/>
they need a quick way to judge a child&#39;s work or knowledge, and it&#39;s<br/>
easier to look at 25 worksheets than talk to 25 kids...<br/>
<br/>
And my experience with unschooled kids and math is that they all seem to<br/>
do it differently..<br/>

brought up the subject of  unschooling kids failing standardized tests.<br/>
