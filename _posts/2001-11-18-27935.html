<div id="ygrps-yiv-13134964">I was thinking about Laura&#39;s question below...<br/>
<br/>
I am a member of a lot of online communities, not just<br/>
for unschooling/homeschooling, but others as well. I<br/>
moderate one of those communities. Prior to someone<br/>
joining there is usually a letter sent as to what the<br/>
rules of etiquette are within any particular group.<br/>
There may have been one here as well, I just don&#39;t<br/>
remember. <br/>
<br/>
My point is, that I think respect is a big piece of<br/>
what that should be. I haven&#39;t seen much respect here.<br/>
I have left this group twice before for exactly the<br/>
same reasons. I don&#39;t really care who thinks they are<br/>
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;.  What I seek is a community that<br/>
allows us to voice our ideas in an environment that<br/>
offers differing viewpoints, diversity of opinions,<br/>
encouragement, and support. For *ALL* of us to feel at<br/>
home in such a community, we need to create an<br/>
environment that treats each other with respect. I<br/>
don&#39;t think an unschooling community such as this<br/>
would want a new member to think that there is just<br/>
*ONE* way to do unschooling. Isn&#39;t that exactly what<br/>
we are hoping to avoid by unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I think the threads that suggest that we ignore the<br/>
posts that are not respectful, is really just avoiding<br/>
the issue. Shouldn&#39;t we strive to have a community<br/>
that demands such from its members? Would our children<br/>
behave this way in such a community exchange? I don&#39;t<br/>
think so...<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the moderator can repost the rules of<br/>
etiquette here? And, if it still continues, perhaps we<br/>
need to discuss some simple and effective methods for<br/>
appropriate list communication? <br/>
<br/>
I would like to see this list become a place to<br/>
exchange ideas in an environment that nurtures, not<br/>
alienates. The best of advice, offered in a manner<br/>
that is rude and disapproving, won&#39;t be heard. What is<br/>
it they say about drawing more bees with honey?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064296600">This list doesn&#39;t have a moderator. No list cop, no listmama, no <br/>
all-seeing, all-knowing person who&#39;s going to decree this is this or <br/>
that is that or ban anybody from the list. We&#39;re all grown-ups here, <br/>
and we don&#39;t need to be baby-sat or policed or moderated or told how <br/>
and what to post. This is just a discussion list, pure and simple, <br/>
and when I created it I assumed it would become populated by thinking <br/>
people who would find interesting things to discuss, would probably <br/>
disagree with each other at some point, would just as probably work <br/>
out their disagreements, and life - and the list - would go on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading all the posts for the last week or two, trying to <br/>
stay out of the disagreements and personality clashes, hoping things <br/>
would chill out again, but like several others, I&#39;m getting damned <br/>
tired of it. I might just quit my own list - wonder if that would be <br/>
a first?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to play God and unsubscribe anyone from this list, but <br/>
it&#39;s a major disappointment to me that what was at one time one of <br/>
the brightest, savviest, sharpest lists on the Net has fallen to <br/>
constant schoolish sniping. And that&#39;s all I&#39;m going to say - or do - <br/>
on the subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246594782">Thanks for clearing this up for me Helen. I didn&#39;t realize that the <br/>
list was unmoderated. And with a different group of personalities <br/>
onlist right now, we might be hearing predominantly issues of <br/>
interest on unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I am just disappointed as well, to see many people leave just because <br/>
they are feeling attacked by the postings of a few.  I was hoping <br/>
that my third time to the list, might be the charm. That the former <br/>
problems would be worked out. <br/>
<br/>
Can I ask that those of you would like to continue the discussion of <br/>
right and wrong, perhaps form a sub-group, to continue that topic? Or <br/>
perhaps email each other off-list?  Or at the very least, perhaps put <br/>
an OT (Off Topic) in the subject line? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d really like to find a group that can challenge and support each <br/>
other&#39;s ideas, *respectfully*. <br/>

IMO, and the way I intented the statement to be, is that it is <br/>
possible to *listen* to drastically different viewpoints <br/>
*respectfully*. Challenging points of view? Wonderful!  I love to <br/>
hear what people have to say about a topic. I sometimes disagree.  I  <br/>
choose to express that in a way that will not undermine your choices <br/>
as a parent. <br/>
<br/>
As for thick skins, well its wonderful not to take something <br/>
personally. What others say and do is very often a projection of <br/>
their own reality, their own dream. So yes, having a thick skin will <br/>
prevent needless anxiety. However, its a tough world out there.  Do <br/>
we really need one more place that we have to have a tough hide??<br/>
<br/>
I am suggesting that we are more aligned than different here, in that <br/>
we have chosen an untraditional method of schooling. We live in <br/>
communities that quite likely don&#39;t have a large support network for <br/>
such a method. So a community such as this one is very important.<br/>
<br/>
Those lists you mentioned, where your &quot;reprimanded for not agreeing <br/>
how beautiful the weather is, is the extreme and not at all what I <br/>
was suggesting. In fact, I was <br/>
not suggesting that we become a moderated list. What I was saying, <br/>
was that we *can* have diversity in ideas and opinions. And we <br/>
*don&#39;t* have to sugar coat it. And we *CAN* challenge even those <br/>
deepest ingrained thoughts *without* resorting to insults and <br/>
bickering. <br/>
<br/>
I am just suggesting we think about ourwords...Write with integrity. <br/>
(in this case, meaning sincerity, honesty, uprightness, and truth.)</div>

<br/>
Thanksgiving is coming.  And while I love most of my relatives, there is<br/>
always potential for the big &quot;we-think-you-shouldn&#39;t-homeschool&quot; fight at<br/>
any family gathering.  (Or long car trip with my brother.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t take criticism really well -- especially the heavy-handed kind that<br/>
starts with &quot;your are ruining this child!!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anybody got any happy thoughts for rising above this or just slogging<br/>
through?  I&#39;m going to three and a half family gatherings over the long<br/>
weekend, and it&#39;s really more than I can sail through serenely.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever been on an email list that didn&#39;t have periodic <br/>
flare ups.  People often get their knickers in a knot about the silliest <br/>
things, taking offense where none was meant.  It&#39;s really hard to say what <br/>
you mean in a way that will be understood by others exactly the way you <br/>
meant it.  If people misinterpret what someone says, either because it <br/>
wasn&#39;t clearly written, or because they just didn&#39;t read it right, they&#39;re <br/>
going to get upset.  It happens.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra states her position in an abrasive way sometimes.  If it really <br/>
bothers you, don&#39;t read her posts, though you&#39;ll miss some very good ideas <br/>
in the process.  Lynda obviously doesn&#39;t like Sandra and makes that <br/>
clear...frequently.  If you don&#39;t like reading about it, skip her <br/>
posts.  But you&#39;ll miss some really good posts by doing so.  Bridget still <br/>
feels misunderstood and picked on from stuff that happened this <br/>
summer.  When she forgets about that, she has some good things to say.  I&#39;d <br/>
say those are the main actors in this soap opera, though there are lots of <br/>
bit players, like me, jumping into the fray.<br/>
<br/>
Really, the best way to stop a flame war is to change the subject.  How&#39;s <br/>
the weather where you are?  We&#39;ve just had a bunch of badly-needed rain, <br/>
and now we&#39;re getting cold and clear.  I hadn&#39;t thought it would be clear <br/>
enough on the Wet Coast of Canada to see the Leonides last night, but they <br/>
were quite spectacular (for the little while that I could stay awake to watch).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Betsy,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my happy thought for the day:<br/>
We went to see Harry Potter today.  (It was good but that&#39;s not my <br/>
point!)  As we were leaving the theater, the girls and I got ahead of <br/>
the boys.  We stopped to wait for them just outside the door and I <br/>
had one of those sudden shocks that you never quite see coming.  My <br/>
girls are BOTH adults.  Rachel is 16 and Jenni is 14.  I&#39;ve known <br/>
they are mature for their ages (relative to others I&#39;ve met) but I <br/>
didn&#39;t realize until just that moment that they are adults no matter <br/>
what society says. <br/>
<br/>
They have both chosen their own clothes for years and usually look <br/>
like refugees from a poorly funded Salvation Army.  I don;t <br/>
care &#39;cause I usually do too.  Today, in the same clothes they&#39;ve <br/>
always worn, they suddenly look like they are two unique and <br/>
interesting individuals who like to dress their personalities.  They <br/>
both were standing straight and tall and interacting with the world <br/>
around them.  I don&#39;t know how many teens you all see regularly but <br/>
if they are anything like the high schoolers around here you will <br/>
recognize that as a great thing.  No pouting at the wait.  No whining <br/>
that they wanted anything.  Just a bit of conversation about the <br/>
movie and what was left out.<br/>
<br/>
Our good days far outnumber the bad ones.  I love spending time with <br/>
them and they are just really cool people.  Probably the most <br/>
interesting people I know.  They know things.  I don&#39;t know how or <br/>
when they learned them but they know them.  Whenever someone asks me <br/>
if I think unschooling (or homeschooling works) I tell them to look <br/>
at my eldest and they can tell me!<br/>

refugee and dressing her personaility, with the percentage way over on the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316027412">My cousin put together a little booklet which included a suggested reading<br/>
lists, a list of famous homeschoolers, quotes and newspaper clippings that<br/>
have been positive about homeschooling, a list of quotes from various<br/>
kids/families who have left public school and why, and she did a section on<br/>
the whole college question.<br/>
<br/>
She was very sweet when she gave them out, saying &quot;I have lots of experience<br/>
with public schools, so I understand your arguments.  But since you don&#39;t<br/>
know anything about homeschooling, I&#39;ve put together some information for<br/>
you.  We can discuss this later after you have a chance to read this so that<br/>
we will both be able to discuss both sides of the issue with some knowledge<br/>
of each side.&quot;  Then walked away while they stood there with their mouths<br/>
hanging open.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I honestly don&#39;t get it.  As far as I can see, this list IS a palce<br/>
&gt; &gt; to exchange ideas.  Quite frankly, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to<br/>
&gt; &gt; look to a list for nurturing.  People have the choice to let strong<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinions differing drastically from our own either alienate them or<br/>
&gt; &gt; be challenged by them.  It should either make us rethink our position<br/>
&gt; &gt; or strengthen our conviction in our already existsing position.<br/>

&gt; Hi, folks --<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving is coming.  And while I love most of my relatives, there is<br/>
&gt; always potential for the big &quot;we-think-you-shouldn&#39;t-homeschool&quot; fight at<br/>
&gt; any family gathering.  (Or long car trip with my brother.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t take criticism really well -- especially the heavy-handed kind<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; starts with &quot;your are ruining this child!!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anybody got any happy thoughts for rising above this or just slogging<br/>
&gt; through?  I&#39;m going to three and a half family gatherings over the long<br/>
&gt; weekend, and it&#39;s really more than I can sail through serenely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

off and away, and if it does go that direction (which it might not), have <br/>
them prepared to take offender-person off and deliver the ultimatum that it <br/>
has to stop. <br/>
<br/>
If it comes from you, it might seem just plain defensive, but if you have a <br/>
brother in law or cousin or someone who can deliver the &quot;back off&quot; <br/>
dispassionately, you could last longer.<br/>
<br/>
Or if there&#39;s time, you might e-mail each hostess or suspect (or send a note) <br/>
and say flat out that if they plan to criticize your parenting you&#39;d rather <br/>
go to Thanskgiving with friends.  You could say you&#39;d like to spend the day <br/>
being thankful intead of resentful, and so you need their assurance that it&#39;s <br/>
a safe place for you to come.<br/>
<br/>
How can you digest a big meal like that if you&#39;re all tied up waiting for the <br/>
axe to drop?<br/>
<br/>
I feel really sorry for those families in which the other relatives haven&#39;t <br/>
yet seen how cool the homeschooled kids are.  I know there are problems; I <br/>
had some with my brother-in-law last time he was in town (although it was me <br/>
prodding him about being too controlling and inflexible with his poor <br/>
in-school teen this time).  Things are never just right.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck, however it goes!<br/>

&gt; around them.  I don&#39;t know how many teens you all see regularly but<br/>
&gt; if they are anything like the high schoolers around here you will<br/>
&gt; recognize that as a great thing.  No pouting at the wait.  No whining<br/>
&gt; that they wanted anything.  Just a bit of conversation about the<br/>
&gt; movie and what was left out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our good days far outnumber the bad ones.  I love spending time with<br/>
&gt; them and they are just really cool people.  Probably the most<br/>
&gt; interesting people I know.  They know things.  I don&#39;t know how or<br/>
&gt; when they learned them but they know them.  Whenever someone asks me<br/>
&gt; if I think unschooling (or homeschooling works) I tell them to look<br/>
&gt; at my eldest and they can tell me!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Bridget, for the inspiring preview.  I totally agree with you that<br/>
the unschooled and homeschooled kids that I know, or see at group<br/>
gatherings, have a completely different vibe than kids in school.  (So, I<br/>
can really visualize your kids as cool and wise.)  Park days have such a<br/>
different feel compared to say, recess on the playground with asphalt and<br/>
screeching and whistles.  It&#39;s just so hard sometimes to put this into words<br/>
that will persuade anyone who hasn&#39;t seen and felt it.  (If I was going to<br/>
put one word labels on things, my park day word would be &quot;delight&quot; and my<br/>
school playground word would be &quot;tension&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
My #1 reason for homeschooling is so that my son will have a happier<br/>
childhood.  When he&#39;s really engaged in what he&#39;s doing, he just radiates<br/>
satisfaction.  I&#39;m just not sure that everyone around me (&#39;cept you guys)<br/>
values this radiance.  Heck, I think there are people in my family, and in<br/>
the community, that don&#39;t even have the eyes to see it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to guide my life with this kind of intuition, but hard to explain<br/>
it (and PROVE it) in the heat of an argument.  (Imagine &quot;Hey, sis, I know<br/>
what I&#39;m doing because I&#39;m guided by my son&#39;s radiance and positive<br/>
vibrations.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Hope what I&#39;m saying makes sense to those of you who understand the life<br/>
we&#39;re living.<br/>

Thursday he will be sucked into the pit of Nintendo &lt;g&gt; with the teenaged<br/>
nephews and not be seen for hours.  (And this is his family, mind you.)  (The<br/>
Nintendo room is pretty small, so I don&#39;t think I can spend the whole day hiding<br/>
there, but it&#39;s tempting.)<br/>

a free day for myself, I just send the dh and kid without stopping for guilt.)<br/>
I usually don&#39;t skip the major events, but I could.<br/>

&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been reading all the posts for the last week or<br/>
two, trying to <br/>
stay out of the disagreements and personality clashes,<br/>
hoping things <br/>
would chill out again, but like several others, I&#39;m<br/>
getting damned <br/>
tired of it. I might just quit my own list - wonder if<br/>
that would be <br/>
a first?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not going to play God and unsubscribe anyone from<br/>
this list, but <br/>
it&#39;s a major disappointment to me that what was at one<br/>
time one of <br/>
the brightest, savviest, sharpest lists on the Net has<br/>
fallen to <br/>
constant schoolish sniping. And that&#39;s all I&#39;m going<br/>
to say - or do - <br/>
on the subject.<br/>
