<br/>
By TAMAR LEWIN<br/>
<br/>
      ost fourth graders spend less than three hours a week writing,<br/>
which is about 15 percent of the time they spend watching television.<br/>
Seventy-five percent of high<br/>
      school seniors never get a writing assignment from their history<br/>
or social studies teachers.<br/>
<br/>
And in most high schools, the extended research paper, once a<br/>
senior-year rite of passage, has been abandoned because teachers do not<br/>
have time to grade it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Those are among the findings of a report issued yesterday by the<br/>
National Commission on Writing in America&#39;s Schools and Colleges, an<br/>
18-member panel of educators<br/>
organized by the College Board.<br/>
<br/>
The commission&#39;s report asserts that writing is among the most important<br/>
skills students can learn, that it is the mechanism through which they<br/>
learn to connect the dots in<br/>
their knowledge  and that it is now woefully ignored in most American<br/>
schools.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Writing, always time-consuming for student and teacher, is today<br/>
hard-pressed in the American classroom,&quot; the report said. &quot;Of the three<br/>
R&#39;s, writing is clearly the most<br/>
neglected.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The panel, led by C. Peter Magrath, president of the National<br/>
Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, is<br/>
recommending that the amount of time students<br/>
spend on writing be doubled, that writing be taught in all subjects and<br/>
at all grade levels and that every school district adopt a writing plan.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If students are to make knowledge their own, they must struggle with<br/>
the details, wrestle with the facts and rework raw information and dimly<br/>
understood concepts into<br/>
language they can communicate to someone else,&quot; the report said. &quot;In<br/>
short, if students are to learn, they must write.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In two decades of education reform, the teaching of reading and<br/>
arithmetic has come under intense scrutiny, with increased state<br/>
regulation and a host of new assessment<br/>
tests.<br/>
<br/>
But until recently the teaching of writing has been largely overlooked.<br/>
That seems to be changing now. With everyone from employers to college<br/>
professors expressing alarm<br/>
about the dismal writing skills of most American students, there is a<br/>
new urgency, and new energy, to upgrade the teaching of writing.<br/>
<br/>
Both of the major college-entrance exams, the SAT and the ACT, are being<br/>
revised to include writing tests, and last year the College Board, which<br/>
administers the SAT,<br/>
created the National Commission on Writing to study the issue.<br/>
<br/>
The panel found that only about half of the nation&#39;s 12th graders report<br/>
being regularly assigned papers of three or more pages in English class;<br/>
about 4 in 10 say they never,<br/>
or hardly ever, get such assignments. Part of the problem is that many<br/>
high school teachers have 120 to 200 students, and so reading and<br/>
grading even a weekly one-page<br/>
paper per student would be a substantial task.<br/>
<br/>
On the National Assessment of Educational Progress exam, only about one<br/>
in four students in Grades 4, 8 or 12 scored at the proficient level in<br/>
writing in 1998, the most<br/>
recent such results available. And only one in a hundred was graded<br/>
&quot;advanced.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Further, a 2002 study of California college students found that most<br/>
freshmen could not analyze arguments, synthesize information or write<br/>
papers that were reasonably free<br/>
of language errors.<br/>
<br/>
There are some encouraging signs, though, among them the growth of the<br/>
National Writing Project, a professional-development effort that began<br/>
at the University of<br/>
California at Berkeley almost 30 years ago and has expanded to 175 sites<br/>
nationwide, where teacher networks are fostered at five-week summer<br/>
sessions on writing.<br/>
<br/>
The commission&#39;s report is to be followed by a five-year campaign to<br/>
fulfill its recommendations. That campaign, called &quot;A Writing Challenge<br/>
to the Nation,&quot; will be led by<br/>
former Senator Bob Kerrey, president of the New School University.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our spiritual lives, our economic success and our social networks,&quot; Mr.<br/>
Kerrey said, &quot;are all directly affected by our willingness to do the<br/>
work necessary to acquire the<br/>
skill of writing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just how much national will exists to do that work remains the crucial<br/>
question, educators and policy experts agree.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This report is a great beginning,&quot; said the executive director of the<br/>
National Writing Project, Richard Sterling, chairman of the commission&#39;s<br/>
advisory board. &quot;If this is the<br/>
trigger that allows us to step up to the kind of interest there has been<br/>
around reading and math, it will make a big difference in children&#39;s<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But the commission could sink without a trace unless we go forth and<br/>
say: How does it actually happen? How do we get the recommendations into<br/>
policy? How do we get<br/>
enough professional development for teachers? How do we recognize the<br/>
excellent work that&#39;s going on?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Connect the dots is my favorite unschooling analogy these days, and will be <br/>
big in what I&#39;m talking about at the Live & Learn conference in SC.   <br/>
<br/>
Writing in school would NOT be among my top 200 recommendations!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Turning off the TV to write AFTER school wouldn&#39;t even make my top thousand.<br/>
<br/>
If they want kids to write, they forbid it.  They take notebooks away if they <br/>
catch kids writing, and they tell them not to bring any pens or pencils to <br/>
school.  THEN those kids will write.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But until recently the teaching of writing has been largely overlooked.<br/>
<br/>
That seems to be changing now. With everyone from employers to college<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
When I taught, I spent at least six hours every weekend going through student <br/>
writing.  My salary was embarrassingly low.  It wasn&#39;t the greatest use of my <br/>
time.  SOME of the kids really read what I wrote and looked at what I marked. <br/>
 More of them glanced at the score and shoved the paper somewhere that would <br/>
cause it to be trash within days.  Those were hours in addition to what I did <br/>
on my prep period and before school in the half hour we had to be there <br/>
early.  I worked my butt off trying to teach kids the mechanics of writing, <br/>
and to play with words, to roll and fly, to write things that were light and <br/>
funny.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
Ah, jeez, they don&#39;t have a clue about making it seem easy and fun.<br/>
