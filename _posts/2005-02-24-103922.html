<div id="ygrps-yiv-452208587">Hi.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a site where my son can download printable yu-gi-oh cards to <br/>
practice and play with?  Anne--would you ask Sam or Jake? I think one of them told <br/>
him at the conference that it was possible to do this. John has been searching and <br/>
searching the web but can&#39;t find anything.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Thalia<br/>
