<div id="ygrps-yiv-984440837">I&#39;m wondering how many of you worked or are working with younger children? I know there are some families with much older kids now who may choose or be able to work but what about when your kids are younger. Do you simply make the choice to be broke all the time so that one parent can be home for sure or have you had to work outside the family and if so how did it work. I know people who want to keep their kids home but sometimes can&#39;t because they need the income and have to make a choice. anyway, I&#39;m kind of not sure exactly how to phrase this otherwise. I think I got the jist of what I wanted to say across. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Until 3 years ago, I worked part-time as an English instructor at the local community college. I would ask for classes at 8 a.m. or in the evening (and usually got them, because they were the ones nobody wanted), and then when on-line classes came along, I was about the first in my department to get trained and start doing those, which I could do entirely from home except for office hours and student conferences a couple of times a semester. So I worked while caring for the kids, or while my partner was with them.<br/>
<br/>
In some ways, it was a great job for a mom. In other ways...not so much. I often ended up grading papers until 2 or 3 in the morning if the day hadn&#39;t allowed me any stretches of time during which I could concentrate. I was glad to be able to stop doing it, but that had to do with the job being very stressful, and I&#39;d have been glad to quit even if I didn&#39;t have any kids.<br/>
<br/>
I very occasionally pick up a freelance writing or editing job for a little extra money. But really we live on my partner&#39;s income as a software engineer.<br/>

<br/>
Be careful with &quot;just&quot; or &quot;simply.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the only choices you can see are working outside the family or  <br/>
being broke all the time, that&#39;s a problem with clarity.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know people who want to keep their kids home but sometimes can&#39;t  <br/>
because they need the income and have to make a choice. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I know people who would love to own horses, but they live on a small  <br/>
lot, and can&#39;t afford to pay to have horses stabled, and can&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t free, and it&#39;s not necessary.  It&#39;s a luxury.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a choice some people make, for an array of reasons.<br/>
<br/>
On a list about solar straw-bale homes, there will be some readers who  <br/>
just cannot possibly feasibly build such a home where they live  <br/>
whether because of zoning, or insufficient sunshine, or the lack of  <br/>
ownership of any land.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is sometimes portrayed by enthusiastic but irresponsible  <br/>
people as &quot;Anyone can do this!&quot; but that&#39;s not true.  Many people  <br/>
can&#39;t, even those who would like to.<br/>
<br/>
There is a mental &quot;that&#39;s not fair&quot; kneejerk in people sometimes, that  <br/>
if everyone can&#39;t do it NOone should do it.  I believe that reaction  <br/>
in humans, that sudden jealously and low-level confused desire is  <br/>
older than schools by far, and we can&#39;t change human nature.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve worked on and off full and part time for most of my children&#39;s lives.<br/>
I&#39;ve worked as a waitress, a personal trainer, an administrative assistant,<br/>
and a few other positions.  One of the best jobs I had was working part time<br/>
for a Unitarian Universalist church as an education assistant.  My<br/>
supervisor (she was homeschooled and now homeschools her children) and I<br/>
brought our children with us.  I did that for a year until church budget<br/>
cuts dictated otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m working full time and hubby is not employed.  It would be<br/>
great if the kids could stay at home with him but he&#39;s not really the one to<br/>
have the kids home with him full time.  Whenever I have gone back to work<br/>
full time the kids have had to go to school - even if dh was unemployed.<br/>
So..to school they have gone.again, and most likely they will be there until<br/>
I can find a way to earn a suitable income working part time, or for myself,<br/>
or with some type of schedule that allows me to be at home with them at<br/>
least 6 hours out of the day.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Of course if anyone has any suggestions I&#39;m all ears.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106363258">We stay broke as far as running around spending a lot of gas in the car. We<br/>
live pretty far out from most things interesting enough to go to. Walking<br/>
distance to anything is at least 1/2 hour in the humidity and heat and,<br/>
these days, frequent dashes of impromptu rain.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not ideal. We do a lot of things at home and luckily we have a great<br/>
big field to walk in mornings (if we get up in time) and evenings. Stuff out<br/>

just jumping in on this but straying off the topic a bit.<br/>
r yr children ok with being in the house a lot?  have u found they miss out on much becos u can&#39;t get to different places?<br/>
i had a period were we did not very much outside of the home and feel a bit guilty.....especially the interacting with other people, except each other and me.<br/>
now we have a bit more money and can get out but sometimes my children won&#39;t want to come along.  soemtimes we decide no but other times they may initially say no and i say let&#39;s go and try it and they come away glad they experienced it.  is that ok?<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s fine to be persuasive, if that&#39;s the question.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel guilty or don&#39;t feel like you&#39;re doing enough, then do  <br/>
more.  Every time.<br/>
It&#39;s like feeling hungry and eating, or feeling tired and lying down.<br/>
If you feel that you&#39;re not doing as much for your children as it  <br/>
seems you should, then do more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my son was born (1995), my wife and I were living in London, a relatively expensive city, and both working full-time but with different schedules that meant one or other of us was at home most of the time but we needed some childcare for various periods during the week, including one full day. I quit my job to be at home with our son full-time when he was two (or perhaps to be more accurate, so he could be at home with me full-time) after our complicated lifestyle had become rather stressful and we had crunched the numbers and discovered that most of my income was being spent on doing what I needed to do to earn the income in the first place. It was an unexpected finding and a lesson learned - it&#39;s not just about salaries and wages: take into account when assessing income the financial cost of earning that income. So, initially, when I quit my job, we had to tighten our belts but not really by that much. Then, because my wife was now free to focus on her career, her income started to rise and I would say probably no more than two years later our net family income was what it had been when we&#39;d both been working. <br/>
<br/>
Something similar happened when we took our son out of school in 2002. Only this time it produced a financial bonus. At the time, I was still a stay-at-home dad. I&#39;d chosen to continue with that even though my son was now in his second year at school because he&#39;d never settled at school and I wanted to be free to get into the school at every opportunity to watch over him. He attended a private Catholic school. After the decision was made to remove him and educate him at home, a whole range of expenditures disappeared from our lives - fees, uniforms, out of school activities, the money the school always seemed to be after for one thing or another... In the past seven plus years, my wife and I have saved probably tens of thousands of dollars that would have been the cost of sending our son to school.<br/>
<br/>
And in both those cases, everybody was so much happier, so what we did would have been worth doing even if it hadn&#39;t worked out for us financially.<br/>

=) =)   We, DH and I chose to go to one income when we started our<br/>
family almost 12 years ago.  I never chose to feel broke!  I feel<br/>
creative ....a few years ago I taught myself the way of the coupon, I<br/>
opened myself up to thrift stores and freecycle and other ways of<br/>
obtaining and providing my families needs.<br/>
<br/>
I have worked part -time, mostly in child care, when it worked well for<br/>
or benefited all us...like when my girls where toddlers and the place<br/>
had very cool indoor climby things or with Girls Scouts so the girls<br/>
could attend for free or at very discounted rate  a camp or event in the<br/>
more recently years .<br/>
<br/>
Last Aug my DH lost his job, I didn&#39;t go back to work, we made it work<br/>
with what we had coming in, unemployment and food stamps, and such...the<br/>
girls played a big part in the decision making on what to scale back on<br/>
and how and what we would spend on...they maintained their monthly $50<br/>
allowance each (often offering it up if they thought it was needed<br/>
elsewhere { teary happy sigh moment} )  We even got to travel across<br/>
country, East coast to West coast and back again...with a month long<br/>
paid stay in CA , all thanks to a job DH decided to go for that didn&#39;t<br/>
work out!  So a small shift in thinking goes along way!   I see our life<br/>
as very full and joyfully abundant.   Happily DH found a job  ( he&#39;s<br/>
happier..we do miss not having him a round as much ) about 3 weeks ago<br/>
and he&#39;ll be making less than half of what he was making...and honestly<br/>
that&#39;s OK.  I make the choice not to feel stuck .  =) =)<br/>

worked 7pm-4am and I worked an 8 to 5 -- was a perfect dance! We had a<br/>
mother&#39;s helper come in 4 mornings a week during the summer, just for a<br/>
couple of hours, to play with her while Mitch finished sleeping or did yard<br/>
work. When Hayden came along, Mitch was just returning to work after a<br/>
summer of radiation & I worked as an interpreter.  I worked out a deal with<br/>
a friend, a two hour minimum for drop off childcare (it was THE place my<br/>
kids could both be dropped off without transition issues!).<br/>

not hard. No matter the cash price, I was *gifting* all of us with our<br/>
collective presence.  There was nothing *broke* about it! We didn&#39;t have a<br/>
whole lot of disposable income available at any given moment and we did the<br/>
best with what we had -- including many trips to California (including<br/>
disneyland), unschooling conferences, visits to friends who lived hours<br/>
away. I worked hard to lessen their loss, choosing NOT to be broke (in any<br/>
sense of the term) was a very important first step.  Sometimes the only<br/>
thing worth changing is your perspective.<br/>

worked full-time professionally and my core aches thinking of the moments<br/>
I&#39;da missed if I&#39;d taken that road instead...  The gains on this road, the<br/>
tough road, greatly outweigh the losses :) (and this from a woman who&#39;s also<br/>
lost a daughter to life&#39;s process).  It&#39;s priorities and choices in line<br/>
with them, not easy, AND absolutely possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322826064">I do agree with Sandra that it isn&#39;t financially possible for every family to unschool, but reading Elisabeth&#39;s story reminded me that &quot;where there&#39;s a will, there&#39;s a way&quot;. Living on one salary often means getting creative and making every dollar stretch as far as possible. There are thousands of ways to be frugal and thrifty.<br/>
<br/>
I think most people would be surprised at how much &quot;free&quot; there is out there. Most libraries have a variety of free workshops and programs for all ages (year round). Communities across the country have free summer concerts. If you live near a participating alley, kids can bowl free (other than shoe rental) all summer long (Google &quot;kids bowl free&quot;). Friends, family and neighbors are also good sources for learning skills and experiencing different things. The possibilities are really endless!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; =) =)   We, DH and I chose to go to one income when we started our<br/>
&gt; family almost 12 years ago.  I never chose to feel broke!  I feel<br/>
&gt; creative ....a few years ago I taught myself the way of the coupon, I<br/>
&gt; opened myself up to thrift stores and freecycle and other ways of<br/>
&gt; obtaining and providing my families needs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have worked part -time, mostly in child care, when it worked well for<br/>
&gt; or benefited all us...like when my girls where toddlers and the place<br/>
&gt; had very cool indoor climby things or with Girls Scouts so the girls<br/>
&gt; could attend for free or at very discounted rate  a camp or event in the<br/>
&gt; more recently years .<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last Aug my DH lost his job, I didn&#39;t go back to work, we made it work<br/>
&gt; with what we had coming in, unemployment and food stamps, and such...the<br/>
&gt; girls played a big part in the decision making on what to scale back on<br/>
&gt; and how and what we would spend on...they maintained their monthly $50<br/>
&gt; allowance each (often offering it up if they thought it was needed<br/>
&gt; elsewhere { teary happy sigh moment} )  We even got to travel across<br/>
&gt; country, East coast to West coast and back again...with a month long<br/>
&gt; paid stay in CA , all thanks to a job DH decided to go for that didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; work out!  So a small shift in thinking goes along way!   I see our life<br/>
&gt; as very full and joyfully abundant.   Happily DH found a job  ( he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; happier..we do miss not having him a round as much ) about 3 weeks ago<br/>
&gt; and he&#39;ll be making less than half of what he was making...and honestly<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s OK.  I make the choice not to feel stuck .  =) =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769610976">My baby is young. I Stopped working as a trainer/facilitator (self-employed)<br/>
in my third trimester and didn&#39;t go back. No plans. I have just stopped. I<br/>
figure that if a time comes when I will be ready to work again,<br/>
circumstances will be different enough to call it a new start. And yes, we<br/>
are often broke.<br/>
<br/>
That is with my main profession. However, I continue working on my websites<br/>
as and when I get time from home. Some days, that can be a lot of time,<br/>
other days, i am not even able to check email. That earns me enough money to<br/>
pay some bills, which is good, since my husband doesn&#39;t earn much. We run<br/>
the same business, but the parts he manages generally are less paying than a<br/>
consultant&#39;s fee. I was the earner of the two of us before I stopped. So<br/>
that money comes in handy to keep him from getting desperate from the<br/>
pressure. Plus, I have the flexibility to have a work marathon when someone<br/>
is available to take charge of the little guy for long periods of time, or<br/>
do bits and pieces as and when I can.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see it so much as a work or stay home thing. There are loads of<br/>
things I do from home that bring money or save money, which, while not<br/>
exactly a full profile job, do matter and make a difference. I am also able<br/>
to do what I can, when I can to make his work easier for him so that he is<br/>
able to do more/better/get some rest...<br/>
<br/>
I think with a young child, its important to not have absolute descriptions<br/>
of working or staying home. Then there are many things, which while not<br/>
exactly a job, work well to keep the money going further.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m wondering how many of you worked or are working with younger children?<br/>
&gt; I know there are some families with much older kids now who may choose or be<br/>
&gt; able to work but what about when your kids are younger. Do you simply make<br/>
&gt; the choice to be broke all the time so that one parent can be home for sure<br/>
&gt; or have you had to work outside the family and if so how did it work. I know<br/>
&gt; people who want to keep their kids home but sometimes can&#39;t because they<br/>
&gt; need the income and have to make a choice. anyway, I&#39;m kind of not sure<br/>
&gt; exactly how to phrase this otherwise. I think I got the jist of what I<br/>
&gt; wanted to say across.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I work part-time from home as a technology transfer consultant.  The hours are highly variable, from 0-10 per week.  I try to do most of my work from 3:30-5:30/6pm when Audrey and Tyler are napping most of that time.  I have a 13 year old &quot;mother&#39;s helper&quot; come over during that time. She plays games with James and gets the other kids up if/when they wake up.  Her only &quot;role&quot; is to play with them, so they look at it as fun.  I plan snacks ahead of time and even tell her to let me know if a diaper needs changing.<br/>
<br/>
If I can&#39;t get my work done in the hours she can be here that week, then I grab an hour in the evening, or a few on the weekend.  My only anxiety is when I have a client phone call.  It happens infrequently, but I absolutely can&#39;t be interrupted during the teleconference.  I have a hard time relaxing and not anticipating that I am going to be needed. Fortunately, most of my work is solitary, online, and just requires thinking and writing and not much phone time.<br/>
<br/>
The money I make is helpful to round out our variable expenses budget sometimes (groceries, clothes, books, toys, money to go to the pool and eat lunch out,etc) but doesn&#39;t make a dent in our fixed expenses (mortgage, insurance, utilities, etc).  In all reality, I am forgoing a $125K+ salary per year by not working.  That&#39;s a huge deal to some people (my relatives, friends and neighbors sometimes lament my &quot;wasted potential&quot;), but we don&#39;t want to live in the rat race of daycare sucking up the income, work wardrobes, new more reliable cars, commuting, rushing, enforced schedules, and, needless to say, school. I&#39;d rather put that effort into my relationships with my kids (and my husband, who makes our free lives possible).<br/>
