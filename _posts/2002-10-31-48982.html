 </span></blockquote>And, go figure...I&#39;d LOVE to be back in Germany! Where are you? We were in <br/>
the Wiesbaden/Mainz area. Cameron was born in the Weisbaden hospital (yuck!). <br/>
Our little town was Bodenheim (there&#39;s also a Budenheim and a Boedenheim <br/>
nearby!&lt;G&gt;). We still have many friends there. We were a little partial to <br/>
the weinfests &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m relatively fluent, so we were on the economy and pretty much lived German <br/>
lives (except for occasional visits to the commissary). I did a few officer <br/>
wives things, but I&#39;d rather do &quot;Kaffee und Kuchen&quot; with my neighbors! Most <br/>
of our shopping was at the local Metzger and Baekerie. I LIKED knowing that I <br/>
had to have everything done by noon on Saturday for a relaxing weekend! <br/>
Sometimes my neighbor would pick up Broetchen on Saturday mornings and drop <br/>
them on our porch for us to find! I drove all over Europe going to dog shows. <br/>
I made a whole &#39;nother group of dog friends. Many introduced themselves just <br/>
to watch me handle (or ask me to handle their dogs! &lt;G&gt;) and to ask about <br/>
American shows.<br/>
<br/>
The most &quot;agitated&quot; I got was when we were &quot;short&quot;, and I was READY to go <br/>
home---THEN I started wishing for all those &quot;American&quot; things---because I <br/>
knew we&#39;d be here soon. <br/>
<br/>
As for folks not speaking---I&#39;ve had more problems with THAT in Yankeeland! &lt;<br/>
g&gt; ALL my neighbors/townsfolk were delightful. Everyone knew we were &quot;The <br/>
Americans&quot;---and went out of their ways to speak and help! We dressed like <br/>
the natives (except when Ben was in uniform, of course!) and tried to fit in <br/>
as well as possible. We DID have rockin&#39; Fourth of July blasts and invited <br/>
the neighborhood (we taught them how to spit watermelon seeds!)! We made many <br/>
good and lifelong friends in the neighborhood.<br/>
<br/>
They ARE more formal---but remember, I&#39;m from the South---that&#39;s not abnormal <br/>
to me! The biggest day was when the neighbors ask me to call them &quot;du&quot; and <br/>
&quot;ihr&quot;---that&#39;s when the formalities are gone. We all cried the day we <br/>
left---several went to the airport with us! I love and miss those Krauts! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I knew women who NEVER left the base! They shopped at the commissary and <br/>
BigX; they went to the base church; they drove their American vans (if they <br/>
drove at all); they ate at the bowling alley or Pizza Hut/McD&#39;s ; they never <br/>
ventured out of the company of Americans. They ALL said how much they HATED <br/>
Germans and Germany. (I&#39;m not saying that you&#39;re saying this!) I even met a <br/>
German woman married to a soldier---her children knew NO German! She didn&#39;t <br/>
even speak to them in her own languauge in her own country!<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I have discussed going back---for a year or two. I&#39;m not as much a <br/>
fan of visiting; I like staying a while. I miss it a lot. I envy your stay <br/>
there! &lt;g&gt; Enjoy it while you got it; you&#39;re gonna miss it when it&#39;s gone! <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I envy your stay <br/>
&gt; there! &lt;g&gt; Enjoy it while you got it; you&#39;re gonna miss it when it&#39;s gone!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, Kelly, I&#39;m enjoying it.  But my situation is very different than yours,<br/>
and I also don&#39;t like being here.  I am entitled to that, although sometimes<br/>
it leaves me feeling torn.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know when you were here, but much has changed in recent years.  Most<br/>
people do not live on the economy now.  There are so many closed posts, that<br/>
there is lots of extra housing.  Obviously that colors my view of this<br/>
country.   Much has changed here since September 11th, too.  All posts are<br/>
closed, all housing areas are closed.  Armed guards walk our perimeters at<br/>
all times.  The Germans do not like being locked out of areas they used to<br/>
walk through, and we are much more seperated from each other these days.<br/>
<br/>
Friedberg and Giessen together have 1 brigade and the BSB.  We have 1 px, 2<br/>
small commisaries, and 2 shopettes.  It&#39;s nothing like the facilities at<br/>
Wiesbaden and Mainz.  I do get off the base, quite a lot.  I find that in<br/>
larger towns, particularly Frankfurt and Wiesbaden, there are lots of<br/>
foreigners and they&#39;re more tolerated than they are here in my small town.<br/>
<br/>
I do know people who don&#39;t get out and hate Germany.  But I know that many<br/>
people, like myself, miss America a lot, yet still try, still travel, and<br/>
see this as a mixed blessing.  Does that make sense?<br/>

someone has to stay and look after the dogs n cats. They are <br/>

I&#39;ll be booking my hesfes tickets just after xmas. Its tent camping <br/>
although I think there are some caravans for hire. Mind you, they <br/>
are off the main site and a lot of the fun at Hesfes is in sitting <br/>
outside poeple&#39;s tents and talking. The kids run lose over the <br/>
campground. Lots of warm clothes as England can be chilly at <br/>
night in May and rainy.<br/>
Most people who go are unschoolers and are alternative :-)<br/>

I don&#39;t know if they&#39;d be living on a base or out on the economy, but if they <br/>
are on a base then they would follow under the DODDS, which from what I <br/>
understand isn&#39;t that big a deal. They may have to submit a form to the local <br/>
school principal, etc. notifying them that they are homeschooling. If they are out <br/>
on the economy then they are subject to local rules if I am not mistaken...&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They are allowed to homeschool whether they live on base or on the economy.<br/>

We found  the beds to be interesting as well.  When we first arrived <br/>
there, we  stayed in a hotel for a few weeks.  Instead of a big double <br/>
bed,  there were 2 single beds with wooden frames around them, and they <br/>
were  pushed together.  But it wasn&#39;t really like a big bed because <br/>
there  was wood in the middle!  And instead of disgusting hotel <br/>
bedspreads  that rarely get washed here in the U.S., they had down <br/>
comforters and  changed the comforter covers every day.  They hung the <br/>
comforters out  of the (unscreened) windows to air them out.  You could <br/>
see  comforters hanging out of windows all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The beds used to DRIVE US CRAZY!!!! We lived in Germany for 7  years.  Also, <br/>
Tupperware, European Tupperware is all very very small sized  oriented.  <br/>
Unique, but small.  We&#39;d call the soda delivery and they&#39;d  deliver cases of cola, <br/>
spezi, and several other flavors right to our door,  anytime.  We&#39;d pay our <br/>
monthly bill.  Pizzas were large rectangles,  not circles.  The layout of apts <br/>
was confusing.  In one apt we rented,  you had to walk through absolutely every <br/>
room of the house to get to the  bathroom.   I loved watching the weddings, <br/>
we lived across the street  from a church.  They would have horse-drawn <br/>
carriages, beautiful gowns, and  LOTS of bells.<br/>
