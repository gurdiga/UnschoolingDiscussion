<div id="ygrps-yiv-699908639">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I need some help, Please:<br/>
We have been finding an assortment of spiders in our son&#39;s room for the<br/>
first time in the 10 years we have lived in this house....What is an<br/>
environmentally/human safe way to get rid of them? Our house is not<br/>
filthy, a bit learning cluttered, but notheing serious that isn&#39;t<br/>
livable....Does anybody have any ideas??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-909186539">I like spiders a LOT, very few are harmful and they do an incredible job<br/>
of catching things which CAN be harmful like flies.<br/>
<br/>
We catch them and put them outside unless they have a productive web<br/>
constructed and then we let them stay.  Our cat, on the other hand, is<br/>
not so friendly, she loves to catch and eat them.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your children could do the job of gently catching and releasing<br/>
them?  It does wonders for diminishing any fear of them.<br/>

My daughter wasn&#39;t afraid of spiders until she saw &quot;Arachnaphobia&quot;, we<br/>
both wish she had never seen that movie.  Now I&#39;m the only one who can<br/>
handle catching them.  I&#39;ve made it abundantly clear that any comments or<br/>
emotions are not allowed around my little guy so he can escape being<br/>
afraid of them.<br/>

Dear Norma.....I just plop a glass over the little buggers (or big ones as the case may be) then slide an index card or envelope or some other stiff paper under the glass, trying not to tangle the legs.  Then pick up the mini-glass cage and transport the arachnid to a new more challenging OUTDOOR environment.  Sometimes I can&#39;t catch them the first time and have to use hunting techniques.  Study their habits and lie in waite.  If one inadverdantly touches me, I have to waite until I stop shuddering in order to complete my task. But the always end up outside.<br/>
