<div id="ygrps-yiv-493468220">I&#39;ve been reading through the posts and websites about unschooling, <br/>
and what I&#39;m finding is that I&#39;m not smart enough to unschool. <br/>
<br/>
Someone on a thread here pointed out to her three year old that Plato <br/>
thought alot about the names of things. On another page, someone <br/>
pointed out to their child who was drawing triangles that all of the <br/>
angles add up to 180 degrees no matter the size or type of triangle. <br/>
In reading about unschooling, I am finding hundreds of examples of <br/>
this, and I don&#39;t know these sorts of things to point out to my child.<br/>
<br/>
What to do when you don&#39;t know enough neat facts to interest your <br/>
child?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415744188">Everyone has their own body of knowledge of things that they find<br/>
interesting and useful.  Some people never think to share the things they<br/>
know and love with their children.  Point out connections when you see them.<br/>
Make a conscious effort to do that if you don&#39;t already do it naturally.<br/>
Don&#39;t keep your kids home where they can only learn from you.  Expose them<br/>
to all the wonders of this planet and to people who can enrich their lives.<br/>
It isn&#39;t about what you know.  A big part of it is about helping them find<br/>
out what they want to know.<br/>

<br/>
And even those who do choose to share it won&#39;t know the same things  <br/>
other people know.  I can talk about what bands the members of  <br/>
Crosby, Stills and Nash were in before, and pull the records off the  <br/>
shelves and play the cuts that best show WHY those members were good  <br/>
for the group.    Does that &quot;matter&quot; in life?  No more or less than  <br/>
mentioning that the idea of an ideal, pure form of a thing is an idea  <br/>
credited to Plato and something he wrote about.  No more or less than  <br/>
knowing that the same director who did Groundhog Day did Bedazzled,  <br/>
and discussing what the two movies have in common.  Someone who  <br/>
shares the history of the Super Bowl or the Rolling Stones or the  <br/>
construction of colliseums and other massive buildings through  <br/>
history is helping children make connections, and connections are  <br/>
what learning is made of.<br/>

Ok, I&#39;m going out on a limb here, so just slap me if I&#39;m wrong....I&#39;m<br/>
going to take a stab at analyzing. I could be waaaaay off, but maybe<br/>
not.:)<br/>
You&#39;re youngish? Maybe only one child so far (I&#39;m not going back to<br/>
read posts and don&#39;t remember) possibly two...they&#39;re young still.<br/>
<br/>
You came out of school like a LOT of us here, beaten down, not sure of<br/>
yourself and convinced there wasn&#39;t anything ultra special or &quot;smart&quot;<br/>
about you.<br/>
<br/>
Well guess what? All the &quot;smart&quot; parents you&#39;re reading about here,<br/>
probably went through a period of time when they were really, really<br/>
unsure too. School doesn&#39;t do much in preparing us for day to day<br/>
information. What swirls all these lovely bits of information into our<br/>
lives, is INTEREST.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned about angles in the last few years, I&#39;ve learned a LOT<br/>
about philosophy and Plato and such in the last few years. Everything<br/>
I learned about history was done after leaving school. Most of my<br/>
&quot;cultural literacy&quot; was formed in my late 20&#39;s up to now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 36 now, with a teen and almost teen in the house. I&#39;ve learned<br/>
right alongside them....researching bizarre factoids and trivia<br/>
whenever we feel like it.<br/>
<br/>
The key is not how much knowledge you have at this point in your<br/>
life...it&#39;s HOW CURIOUS are you? That curiosity and interest is the<br/>
foundation for great unschooling, not how much information is crammed<br/>
into your brain!:) Honest.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like a dunce on these lists some days....there&#39;s such a<br/>
wonderful variety of interesting, brilliant and wise people here. <br/>

Actually, I&#39;m 33 and have three kids. They are 13,12 and 8. I was an A<br/>
student and in the gifted class and came out of school feeling VERY smart.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until I became a parent and got the internet that I realized how<br/>
much I didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids ask questions, I normally do not know the answer. We usually do<br/>
a search on google and if that doesn&#39;t yeild any results we post on a<br/>

<br/>
The key to being &quot;good&quot; at school is basically retaining facts for about a<br/>
week until the test and then forgetting them. If you&#39;re &quot;good&quot; at that you<br/>
are made to feel really smart. Then you get out in the real world and<br/>
realize that &quot;school&quot; smart and real smart are two very different things.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Dunce.&quot;   What a school word!<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time with Pam Sorooshian and her two younger girls last  <br/>
month.  I feel intimidated sometimes by the depth of Roxana&#39;s  <br/>
knowledge, and the intensity of some of her interests.  All of Pam&#39;s  <br/>
kids have taken classes at a college near them.  That makes me look  <br/>
at my kids and think for a fleeting moment that they&#39;re like pound  <br/>
puppies next to Pam&#39;s show dogs.  It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s not right, it&#39;s  <br/>
not totally true (but it might be a little bit true &lt;bwg&gt;), but my  <br/>
kids probably know as much as her kids do, it&#39;s just way more  <br/>
scattery.  Pam&#39;s kids know a lot about a few things.  Rosie knows  <br/>
lots about soccer and horses.  My kids, nothing.  My kids know a  <br/>
little about a lot of things. &lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t mind that, but I still  <br/>
have a pause when I&#39;m around someone whose child is an expert at  <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the deal, though...<br/>
When I was in school, I was relatively expert on The Beatles.   <br/>
Certainly didn&#39;t learn it in school, but the other kids would ask me  <br/>
when the next album was coming out, or who wrote which songs, or  <br/>
whatever.    My best friend played piano better than anyone else in  <br/>
town.  She didn&#39;t learn that in school, but school certainly made use  <br/>
of it, and gave her music credit for being the accompanist for the  <br/>
chorus class.   (Lame deal, but she enjoyed being there more than  <br/>
taking P.E., which it got her out of.)  One friend was a silversmith;  <br/>
learned from his dad, and was making jewelry good enough to sell by  <br/>
his teens.  Some of the girls from Santa Clara Pueblo were making  <br/>
potters, and are now considered &quot;potters,&quot; meaning have been making  <br/>
traditional pottery all their lives.  When we were kids, they were  <br/>
experts already (beginning, but had experience and opportunity others  <br/>
didn&#39;t have).  Some kids rode rodeo, or trained horses or dogs for  <br/>
ranchwork.<br/>
<br/>
The range of what kids do and what parents know is no broader or more  <br/>
narrow among unschoolers than other—but parents whose kids are in  <br/>
school have the dubious luxury of leaving it all up to the teachers;  <br/>
unschooling parents need to wade into the world and start gathering  <br/>
some good stuff!<br/>

<br/>
See...that&#39;s why I said I&#39;m going out on a limb!! Totally off.:)<br/>
<br/>
BUT, my other hunch was that maybe you&#39;re newer to unschooling? I only<br/>
say that because unschooling has been a profoundly healing influence<br/>
in my own life and in many other families.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it sad that whether or not you leave school feeling smart or<br/>
dumb, you quickly find out that you&#39;ve been fooled? That school didn&#39;t<br/>
do anything to help you do the things that really matter for your own<br/>
life&#39;s journey.  I had this notion that I wasn&#39;t very bright, that I<br/>
just couldn&#39;t follow through well enough and wasn&#39;t &quot;living up to<br/>
potential&quot;, basically lots of yucky baggage that didn&#39;t help me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you just need to reclaim that creative spark?<br/>
You already know how to find information, so don&#39;t worry about how<br/>
much you have! You&#39;re doing the important part of helping your<br/>
children find resources they might need. <br/>

You are right! I feel the same way sometimes. I had this finance Professor<br/>
in college who allowed us to make our own &quot;cheat&quot; sheets with formulas,<br/>
because he said never in real life will you not be able to look something up<br/>
or use a calculator! I sat next to an exchange student from Germany, who was<br/>
really an engineering student - and he didn&#39;t have to write down<br/>
formulas...but everyone else did. It took a lot of the pressure off.<br/>
<br/>
Just today we looked up Onomatopoeia! and I am sure that I  was supposed to<br/>
have learned that in school. And my daughter was figuring 3/4 of 12 or<br/>
something and was dividing the 12 by 4 first and then multiplying. I was<br/>
taught the opposite - which gives you a larger number to divide by.... so I<br/>
was amazed at how she figures these things. I learn much more today than I<br/>
did simply becasue I am open to it<br/>

&gt; &gt; &quot;What to do when you don&#39;t know enough neat facts to interest your<br/>
&gt; &gt; child?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ok, I&#39;m going out on a limb here, so just slap me if I&#39;m wrong....I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to take a stab at analyzing. I could be waaaaay off, but maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; not.:)<br/>
&gt; &gt; You&#39;re youngish? Maybe only one child so far (I&#39;m not going back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; read posts and don&#39;t remember) possibly two...they&#39;re young still.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You came out of school like a LOT of us here, beaten down, not sure of<br/>
&gt; &gt; yourself and convinced there wasn&#39;t anything ultra special or &quot;smart&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; about you.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well guess what? All the &quot;smart&quot; parents you&#39;re reading about here,<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably went through a period of time when they were really, really<br/>
&gt; &gt; unsure too. School doesn&#39;t do much in preparing us for day to day<br/>
&gt; &gt; information. What swirls all these lovely bits of information into our<br/>
&gt; &gt; lives, is INTEREST.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve learned about angles in the last few years, I&#39;ve learned a LOT<br/>
&gt; &gt; about philosophy and Plato and such in the last few years. Everything<br/>
&gt; &gt; I learned about history was done after leaving school. Most of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;cultural literacy&quot; was formed in my late 20&#39;s up to now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m 36 now, with a teen and almost teen in the house. I&#39;ve learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; right alongside them....researching bizarre factoids and trivia<br/>
&gt; &gt; whenever we feel like it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The key is not how much knowledge you have at this point in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; life...it&#39;s HOW CURIOUS are you? That curiosity and interest is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; foundation for great unschooling, not how much information is crammed<br/>
&gt; &gt; into your brain!:) Honest.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I feel like a dunce on these lists some days....there&#39;s such a<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonderful variety of interesting, brilliant and wise people here.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Don&#39;t let it bug ya. Just grab onto one of those interesting bits of<br/>
&gt; &gt; information and ride the wave!! I can&#39;t tell you how many times I read<br/>
&gt; &gt; a post and run my butt over to google to learn more.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just like your children, you are building a storehouse of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; information that you enjoy picking up.<br/>

children&#39;s museums and bookstores and libraries. Watch movies and tv.  <br/>

rangers. Hang out in the visitor centers. Talk to people and ask them  <br/>
questions. Don&#39;t be a snob about it - there are interesting people  <br/>
everywhere and the most unexpected people often have the most  <br/>
interesting stories to tell.<br/>
<br/>
Visit your own local area as if you are a tourist. Take tours. Google  <br/>
local buildings, people, newspapers, stories, and so on. Stop and  <br/>
watch buildings go up at construction sites. Try a new fruit or  <br/>
vegetable. Eat out at an ethnic restaurant you haven&#39;t tried before.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, be a little adventurous and have fun.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll all add up.<br/>

Don&#39;t TRY to learn stuff - just look for stuff that interests you and  <br/>
enjoy yourself. The learning will &quot;just happen.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>==============<br/>
<br/>
But even if &quot;facts&quot; (as in memorized phrases or numbers) escape you,  <br/>
you can still reconstruct it or figure it out, can&#39;t you?  Because if  <br/>
you can&#39;t (and got A&#39;s), I would hazard a guess (maybe as wrong as  <br/>
Ren&#39;s &lt;bwg&gt;) that it&#39;s because you&#39;ve TRIED to block out such things.<br/>
<br/>
As to angles and triangles and squares and such...<br/>
<br/>
You know just from everyday speech  or from manipulating photos with  <br/>
Photoshop or something what 90 degrees, means, right?  And &quot;a right  <br/>
angle&quot;?<br/>
And you know what someone means when they said they&#39;ve changed 180  <br/>
degrees from what they used to believe?<br/>
And you know something about 360 degrees having to do with the earth  <br/>
or circles or sewing or something, maybe?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing left then but to remember that the total of a circle or a  <br/>
square is 360 degrees (the whole thing, from the center in all  <br/>
directions) but that a triangle is only half of that (180).<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like buying some educational stuff, consider a geoboard.   <br/>
It&#39;s a plastic pegboard you use for playing with rubber bands.  That  <br/>
can be just plain fun, and might help you understand some things you  <br/>
didn&#39;t really get in school.  It really helped me a lot.  They&#39;re  <br/>
cheap.  If you have an educational supply house you can get one for  <br/>
$5 or so probably, or order them cheaper (except the &quot;plus postage&quot;  <br/>
part) online somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
We have computer games that have shown the kids things about angles  <br/>
without me getting involved. &lt;g&gt;  And if your kids weren&#39;t interested  <br/>
in those kinds of games but you yourself were feeling math-needy, you  <br/>
could play them yourself.  They might be lured over if you&#39;re having  <br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something about triangles and Holly here:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks!  That swimming thing, though... you were doing US a favor!   <br/>
And the food was great.<br/>
<br/>
I will pass the compliments on to them, their dad, their grandma... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Except for the zinging insults (made in fun, but I still feel the  <br/>
zing), older kids have been really nice to my kids too.  My kids tend  <br/>
not to have the urge to zing others (though they can retaliate if  <br/>
needed, and they do practice on me sometimes, especially Marty).  But  <br/>
when Kirby was thirteen he started attending midnight-to-whenever  <br/>
anime club meetings, and was invited, attended to and transported by  <br/>
various older members.  It wasn&#39;t even Kirby&#39;s idea, and he didn&#39;t  <br/>
call around for rides.  They would remember him and arrange for  <br/>
whichever would take him, or sometimes I would deliver him and he  <br/>
would get a ride home with someone else.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty got old enough to be more fun than irritating to Kirby (it  <br/>
happened gradually), Kirby started inviting him to gaming sessions  <br/>
and movies and parties.   Just in the past four months or so, Holly  <br/>
has reached the point that either or both of the boys will include  <br/>
her, too.  That&#39;s a huge relief for me, because the year or two  <br/>
leading up to that point in both cases led to a lot of hurt feelings  <br/>
from not being invited, and then sometimes invited, and then  <br/>
excluded, or not even asked.   The occasional invitation just seemed  <br/>
to make the &quot;not this time&quot; instances worse.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no way to avoid those awkward times.<br/>
<br/>
There is a younger neighbor who has periodically tried to get Holly&#39;s  <br/>
undivided attention (or sometimes will settle for ANY attention), and  <br/>
though she used to hang around with his sister, she just can&#39;t get  <br/>
into playing with him much, especially now that she&#39;s passed into  <br/>
real teen years.  I feel sorry for him.  A couple of times in the  <br/>
past year she has done a brief thing with him, but it&#39;s more  <br/>
rejection than agreement (poor guy).<br/>
<br/>
There are two neighbor girls who ended up not being playmates because  <br/>
Holly was impatient and frustrated that their opening conversation  <br/>
was REPEATEDLY the automatic dialog &quot;Where do you go to school?&quot; and  <br/>
the same questions about homeschooling they would have asked if they  <br/>
had never met her before.  One went through it three times, and  <br/>
another about five, before Holly just started avoiding them.   Partly  <br/>
it was her feeling that they weren&#39;t really paying any attention to  <br/>
her or her answers, partly that they were boring, and partly they  <br/>
seemed jealously disturbed (which is probably why they blanked out on  <br/>
the answers—they couldn&#39;t very well process the idea that she really  <br/>
didn&#39;t have school or lessons).<br/>
<br/>
My kids really aren&#39;t universally as nice to every human, but they  <br/>
have grown up without the prejudices about age that school ingrains  <br/>
in people, and they&#39;re freer with other unschoolers out of relief at  <br/>
being understood and appreciated instead of being prodded and  <br/>
interviewed.<br/>

Hey!  Here&#39;s an online geoboard.  You put the &quot;rubber bands&quot; on with  <br/>
the mouse, and you can color in the area you&#39;ve outlined.  AND these  <br/>
rubber bands won&#39;t break!<br/>

made, about the angles of a triangle adding up to 180:<br/>

I agree with Angela!  I have a dd who is extremely gifted in<br/>
art/drawing/painting.  I can&#39;t draw a stick person.  We went to local art<br/>
galleries and made contacts with people I thought could lead us to someone<br/>
who could help.  I was honest in telling them I don&#39;t know how to help my dd<br/>
except by connecting her with someone like you.  We ended up connecting with<br/>
a local artist who just took her under his wing and mentors her.  She had<br/>
her first art showing at age 13 all because my dh took a few pieces to the<br/>
Chamber of Commerce when he heard they were going to have a showing of the<br/>
local artist and they were so blown away that they asked her to be a part of<br/>
it.  It has snow balled from there.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t be afraid you don&#39;t know enough.  Be excited that there is so much<br/>
that you and your children will learn on your journey.  I know more know<br/>
about art than I did a year ago.  Now, don&#39;t get too excited.....I still<br/>
can&#39;t draw a stick person!!! :)  To be completely honest, somedays I feel<br/>
like I learn more from them than they learn because of me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70572172">**The key is not how much knowledge you have at this point in your <br/>
life...it&#39;s HOW CURIOUS are you?**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d add, just let go of the idea that you are supposed to know <br/>
everything already because you are &quot;done&quot; with school.  That&#39;s a <br/>
powerful myth, but it isn&#39;t so.  Learning doesn&#39;t happen well in a <br/>
school with textbooks.  Learning is a fundamental part of life and <br/>
continues lifelong.  We all have the opportunity to constantly encounter <br/>
new and &quot;unknown&quot; and fascinating things.  We&#39;re not supposed to stop <br/>
learning when we reach school-leaving age.<br/>
<br/>
Any concept that comes up in your life that you wish you knew more about <br/>
is an opportunity.  It is NOT a missed question on a test.  If you are <br/>
grading yourself, as a teacher would, with an imaginary red pen, just <br/>
put down the pen and stop downgrading yourself.  Let go of the idea that <br/>
&quot;we were supposed to cover this before&quot; and just enjoy covering (or <br/>
toying) with the concepts now.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more information in the world than we could swallow in a <br/>
century. Just sip it or gulp it as you wish, but know that you&#39;ll never <br/>
drain the whole ocean.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-541317446">Ah, but that Plato tidbit is the ONLY thing I remember<br/>
from two semesters of a college Philosophy class!<br/>
<br/>
And I think the only reason that stuck with me is<br/>
because my boyfriend&#39;s roommate had one of those<br/>
computer chairs without a back and pads for your shins<br/>
to rest on. I saw it in their room and had no idea<br/>
what it was--they had to convince me that it was a<br/>
chair.  So the &quot;pure form&quot; of &quot;chair&quot; was an example I<br/>
could bring to class the next day and talk about.<br/>
<br/>
My mother often says that her three children led her<br/>
down paths she&#39;d never have traveled on her own. She<br/>
facilitated all sorts of interests we had that she<br/>
didn&#39;t share, and she learned all sorts of things<br/>
she&#39;d never have known if we&#39;d never been born.<br/>
<br/>
- Meg<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Someone on a thread here pointed out to her three<br/>
year old that Plato <br/>
thought alot about the names of things. On another<br/>
page, someone <br/>
pointed out to their child who was drawing triangles<br/>
that all of the <br/>
angles add up to 180 degrees no matter the size or<br/>
type of triangle. <br/>
In reading about unschooling, I am finding hundreds of<br/>
examples of <br/>
this, and I don&#39;t know these sorts of things to point<br/>
out to my child.&gt;&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99768752">I sure can relate to this!  I, too, did well in school, and the <br/>
further away from school I&#39;ve gotten, the more I realize how little I <br/>
really retained.  Invariably what I remember is either something I <br/>
was interested in or something that I used in my daily life.  With my <br/>
kids, I&#39;m finding that I&#39;m learning anew and enjoying it a whole lot <br/>
more.  I never cared much for science in school, but my boys are so <br/>
interested in nature and animals that I&#39;ve cultivated an interest in <br/>
some of the same things.  I&#39;m finding that without all the pressure <br/>
to perform, I really enjoy learning about all sorts of things that I <br/>
used to hate.  And a lot of these things make more sense now because <br/>
I&#39;m learning with a context and not just memorizing facts out of a <br/>
textbook.<br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I&#39;m rather a timid person (school didn&#39;t help with <br/>
that), but being a mother has forced me to be more outgoing and I <br/>
have no problem asking the &quot;experts&quot; at museums, zoos, etc. questions <br/>
because I want my kids to be comfortable asking whatever questions <br/>
they have.  I don&#39;t want them to be like I was.<br/>

============<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dunce.&quot;   What a school word!<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time with Pam Sorooshian and her two younger girls last  <br/>
month.  I feel intimidated sometimes by the depth of Roxana&#39;s  <br/>
knowledge, and the intensity of some of her interests.  All of Pam&#39;s  <br/>
kids have taken classes at a college near them.  That makes me look  <br/>
at my kids and think for a fleeting moment that they&#39;re like pound  <br/>
puppies next to Pam&#39;s show dogs.  It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s not right, it&#39;s  <br/>
not totally true (but it might be a little bit true &lt;bwg&gt;), but my  <br/>
kids probably know as much as her kids do, it&#39;s just way more  <br/>
scattery.  Pam&#39;s kids know a lot about a few things.  Rosie knows  <br/>
lots about soccer and horses.  My kids, nothing.  My kids know a  <br/>
little about a lot of things. &lt;g&gt;   I don&#39;t mind that, but I still  <br/>
have a pause when I&#39;m around someone whose child is an expert at  <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the deal, though...<br/>
When I was in school, I was relatively expert on The Beatles.   <br/>
Certainly didn&#39;t learn it in school, but the other kids would ask me  <br/>
when the next album was coming out, or who wrote which songs, or  <br/>
whatever.    My best friend played piano better than anyone else in  <br/>
town.  She didn&#39;t learn that in school, but school certainly made use  <br/>
of it, and gave her music credit for being the accompanist for the  <br/>
chorus class.   (Lame deal, but she enjoyed being there more than  <br/>
taking P.E., which it got her out of.)  One friend was a silversmith;  <br/>
learned from his dad, and was making jewelry good enough to sell by  <br/>
his teens.  Some of the girls from Santa Clara Pueblo were making  <br/>
potters, and are now considered &quot;potters,&quot; meaning have been making  <br/>
traditional pottery all their lives.  When we were kids, they were  <br/>
experts already (beginning, but had experience and opportunity others  <br/>
didn&#39;t have).  Some kids rode rodeo, or trained horses or dogs for  <br/>
ranchwork.<br/>
<br/>
The range of what kids do and what parents know is no broader or more  <br/>
narrow among unschoolers than other-but parents whose kids are in  <br/>
school have the dubious luxury of leaving it all up to the teachers;  <br/>
unschooling parents need to wade into the world and start gathering  <br/>
some good stuff!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have only thrown pottery for three years - I do well enough I guess  <br/>
since<br/>
I sell out at most shows I do but I guess I can&#39;t be a &quot;potter&quot; since my<br/>
mother didn&#39;t throw pottery and I didn&#39;t have the opportunity to throw<br/>
potter since birth.<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Santa Clara Pueblo potters are practicing an art form of long  <br/>
continuing tradition.<br/>
You could never become a potter of Santa Clara Pueblo. Neither could I.<br/>
<br/>
The definition below (which you quoted) along with the quotation  <br/>
marks around &quot;potter&quot; were intended to suggest the added depth of the  <br/>
situation.   A teen starting out wouldn&#39;t be considered one of the  <br/>
potters at the pueblo, but after years of doing it and mastering the  <br/>
whole process, then might be considered &quot;a potter&quot; within that  <br/>
tradition.<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t throw the pots, they&#39;re coil pots of local clay, fired in  <br/>
traditional ways.<br/>

&gt; do anything to help you do the things that really matter for your own<br/>
&gt; life&#39;s journey.  I had this notion that I wasn&#39;t very bright, that I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did, too. At home, my mother would tell me I was &quot;so smart&quot; (but didn&#39;t <br/>
have any sense), but then act and treat me like I wasn&#39;t, so I got it two-fold. <br/>
It took me at least 10 years out of school before I even got a glimer that <br/>
maybe they were wrong-after all, isn&#39;t it &quot;mother knows best&quot;? Yikes. Not in my <br/>
opinion, anymore! And in the 10 or so years since that glimmer, I&#39;ve started to <br/>
hesitantly believe that I&#39;m really smart-though it is SO easy to backslide <br/>
when something comes along like this board full of smart folks! :~) You&#39;re not <br/>
alone, Erin, in feeling that sometimes. Just focus on the fun it is to look <br/>
things up and learn new things-we have a blast doing that here, and sometimes I&#39;m <br/>
almost too excited and anxious for when the boys are ready for MORE! :~)<br/>
