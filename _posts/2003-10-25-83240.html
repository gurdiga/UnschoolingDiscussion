<div id="ygrps-yiv-603232723">Ok, this is an awesome educational experience which was sent by one <br/>
of our FIELD TRIPS!!! families who works with the FAA (and are moving <br/>
soon, grrrr, you WILL be missed!!!).  Due to the fact that the <br/>
website specified that all educators had to be affiliated with <br/>
an &quot;accredited&quot; school, I became immediately concerned.  I emailed <br/>
the contest coordinators and received a prompt reply.  HOME EDUCATORS <br/>
across the country are WELCOME and ENCOURAGED to enter this <br/>
educational experience. Here is the response I received, and <br/>
following is the actual email describing all the ins and outs of how <br/>
TEACHERS SIGN UP YOUR STUDENTS NOW FOR THE WEATHER CONTEST OF THE <br/>
CENTURY!<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Pamela....<br/>
<br/>
While designed with classroom teachers in mind, homeschool educators <br/>
are <br/>
absolutely welcome to register and participate in the program.<br/>
<br/>
Since we are interested in tracking the number of locations where the <br/>
program <br/>
is implemented, we would prefer that each homeschool educator <br/>
register <br/>
individually.<br/>
<br/>
For school name, just enter &quot;homeschool&quot; and for type of school, <br/>
select &quot;other&quot; from the dropdown menu.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your interest in the 2003 Flight Forecast program!<br/>
Let me know if you have any other questions.<br/>
<br/>

FAA employees (of which my husband is one)  He has been working their <br/>

WHAT:  <br/>
<br/>
Starting September 25, students in grades K-12 are being challenged <br/>
to predict what the weather conditions at Kill Devil Hills, N.C., <br/>
will be on Dec. 17, 2003, the 100th anniversary of the Wright <br/>
brothers first powered flight. On that day, man will attempt to <br/>
recreate that first flight in the most accuratereproduction of the <br/>
1903 flyer ever built.<br/>
<br/>
WHO:<br/>
The 2003 Flight Forecast program is a national contest developed by <br/>
the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission and The Franklin Institute <br/>
Science Museum. It provides teachers with fun and interactive <br/>
activities and historical weather data that students can analyze as a <br/>
basis for predicting the weather at Wright Brothers National Memorial <br/>
on Dec. 17, 2003. All of the activities align with the National <br/>
Science Education Standards, the National Principles and Standards <br/>
for School Mathematics, or some combination of both.<br/>
<br/>
WHY: <br/>
<br/>
Media around the world will be covering the attempt to re-create the <br/>
first flight. This contest gives students a once-in-a-lifetime chance <br/>
to be part of history. Additionally, the event gives students an <br/>
exciting way to apply and learn theories of<br/>
mathematics and science to a real-life situation.<br/>
<br/>
HOW: <br/>
Teachers are asked to go online to www.centennialofflight.gov to <br/>
register their classes between September 25 and November 3 to <br/>
participate in the program. Once on the Web site, teachers will also <br/>
find activities and information to help their students explore <br/>
aviation and meteorology.<br/>
<br/>
MORE DETAILS:   Forecasts will be collected in three grade groupings, <br/>
K-4, 5-8 and 9-12, with the complexity of the forecast increasing at <br/>
the higher grade levels. Forecasts must be submitted online no later <br/>
than Nov. 17, 2003, and prizes will be awarded for the most accurate <br/>
forecasters within each grade group.<br/>
<br/>
The 2003 Flight Forecast program is a part of the national Centennial <br/>
of Flight: Born of Dreams Inspired by Freedom campaign coordinated by <br/>
the U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission in honor of the 100th <br/>
anniversary of the Wright brothers&#39; first powered flight. Additiona; <br/>
educational materials and resources related to the history of flight <br/>
are available at www.centennialofflight.gov/user/edu.htm. Teacher <br/>

<br/>
The U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission was created by Congress to <br/>
expand national and international interest in the commemoration of <br/>
the centennial of powered flight. The Commission is coordinating a <br/>
national outreach campaign and advising<br/>
the President, Congress and federal agencies on the most effective <br/>
ways to encourage and promote national and international <br/>
participation in 2003. Its members include the director of the <br/>
National Air and Space Museum, the administrators of NASA and the <br/>
FAA, the presidents of the Experimental Aircraft Association and<br/>
