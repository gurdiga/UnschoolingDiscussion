<div id="ygrps-yiv-487116200">If you&#39;re looking to transport animals overseas, be very careful <br/>
about the instructions the airline gets about them.  There&#39;s a fly-on-<br/>
the-wall series over here about Heathrow airport, including the <br/>
kennels and animal care centre.  Two beautiful Newfoundlands <br/>
got shipped from Canada (a 12 hour flight) in boxes taht were too <br/>
small, so they couldn&#39;t lie down.  The bloke who found them was <br/>
spitting mad!  Basically, when measuring dogs for travel boxes, <br/>
they&#39;re supposed to take the full head-to-tail length and add the <br/>
&#39;forearm&#39; length, without which, a dog can&#39;t lie down.  These poor <br/>
animals had stood up for over 12 hours!!!  ugh!!  Here in the UK, <br/>
they are trying to bring in &#39;pet passports,&#39; id chips or somesuch to <br/>
reduce the time spent in Q (and the cost!  yes the owner pays for <br/>
6 months kenneling fees...)  And the quarantine regs are so strict <br/>
for a good reason, rabies is rife in Europe and it&#39;s extremely rare <br/>
here.<br/>
