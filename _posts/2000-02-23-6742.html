<div id="ygrps-yiv-70489490">I think I am having migraines.  I&#39;ve been to the eye dr, and he thinks<br/>
so too.  So, I start my research....<br/>
Anyone have these?  What do you do about them?  What kind of Dr. do you<br/>
go to?  Do you take medication?  Any help anyone can give would be<br/>
great.<br/>

Wow! Migraines are horrid, my dh suffers from them. His are from a  car<br/>
accident. As for answers....<br/>
We put dh to bed, a dark quiet room is best. I hear that some people prefer<br/>
soft music, like classical, but do not do TV.<br/>
Dh goes to a neurologist for them.<br/>
Meds, well he is taking Imetrix, dig around, I know that I have seen a free<br/>
trial in some magazines, and you may be able to find them online, not sure,<br/>
though. Dh is on the pills, they have a self induced shot, and nasal spray<br/>
as well.<br/>
I would suggest that you see your family physician. Tell him/her what is<br/>
going on and let her know if the dark works. You want to get this taken care<br/>
of. A friend has suffered from Migraines for years, was doing the Imetrix<br/>
shots, only to find that when she stopped taking the pill, she stopped<br/>
having migraines. Good luck, and do try to find what triggers them.<br/>
Avoidance of an allergy is much cheaper than Imetrix ($90 for 10) though<br/>
sometimes not so easy to avoid...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103335631">read a snippet in an alternative medecine write-in page about migraine and onion soup, apparently some therapists recommend natural blood-thinners like onion and garlic.  Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t seem to be on the paper&#39;s website yet, but there are lots of entries when I searched for migraine, www.telegraph.co.uk  <br/>
<br/>
Having not suffered myself, I can only sympathise, and hope this is helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802842105">I&#39;ve heard of a couple of things people have had success with - might be <br/>
worth a try:  breathing into a brown paper bag, and feverfew.  If I come <br/>
across anything else, I&#39;ll post :)<br/>
