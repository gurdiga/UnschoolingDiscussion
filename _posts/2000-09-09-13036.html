<div id="ygrps-yiv-351669582">We are part of a coop--we meet every other Friday for half a day. Parents or<br/>
(usually) older teens share their passions and/or skills. I taught hands on<br/>
art history last session--this time i&#39;m doing Cool Art Stuff--art history,<br/>
science and art and more! One of the dads isa chemist and he&#39;s doing<br/>
chemistry. We also have Spanish from a native born Peruvian, watercolor,<br/>
German, swing and ballroom dance, baseball skills, creative wrtiting,theater<br/>
for kids, Harry Potter stuff. We plan on having a thing where kids can share<br/>
their passions with everyone--my dd wants to demo dog obedience, another<br/>
kids wants to show his claymation work, another wants to play the bagpipes.<br/>
It is neat to see how this evolves...<br/>
