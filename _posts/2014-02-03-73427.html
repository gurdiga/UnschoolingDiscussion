<div id="ygrps-yiv-306944899">Sorry for use of word &quot;screens&quot; but the subject space want enough to write them all individually. 
Our 8 year old daughter had never been to school and hhas always had limits with TV. Since receiving an ipod for christmas along with a whole bunch of barbie movies and games for ipod since then and introducing barbie.com  she spends her days and nights moving from her ipod first thing in the morning (skipping breakfast) then to barbie. Com or reading eggs for another couple of hours.  Then to the TV for a movie or three for another few hours.  Only interrupted by requests to go to the pool which we try to do. How do you know when this activity of TV or ipod or computer is being used excessively (I have a feeling that word isn&#39;t the right one as it tells how I feel about it and how conflicted I am) because there&#39;s nothing more interesting or sparkly or if its truly a choice that is authentic and not driven by motivations to do with &quot;the is nothing better to do&quot;  aka boredom ? We have lots of puzzles/games/craft options/toys like barbies (now) Sylvanian families, a piano and other musical instruments, dress ups etc etc.  I have always strewed and tried to provide interesting things from different places. I have this nagging feeling that I am not making life sparkly enough.  But maybe she&#39;s simply getting her fill of previously heavily restricted choices.</div>

<div><br>It is just over a month since she got the device, so it is probably the latter.<br><br>You might feel more comfortable if you were more involved. There are games that you take turns with - there are ways to cast the movies from a device to the tv so you can watch together. You can play the games on another device so that you can either play together online or at least talk about the playing of the game. <br>

<br>However, whenever I hear that a parent thinks maybe they aren&#39;t making life interesting enough, I usually think they might be right. Instead of thinking about it, just see if you can think of one thing to introduce. She&#39;s a Barbie fan, so what about a visit to the Barbie aisle at Target. Wandering around a department store is often a great place for parent/child interaction and conversation. <br>

<br>What about you look at some of the amazing Barbie stuff online and share that with her (Put &quot;custom Barbie dolls&quot; into Google and click on images.)<br><br>Do you sew? Maybe get started with a custom Barbie doll project of your own - she can sort of give direction and you do the sewing. <br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785342555">Yes thank you.  It is very big to her especially since we got wifi hooked up in our house on weekend.
It helps to put self into child&#39;s shoes with husband example. Offers that insight where you are indeed a partner not a dictator. 
I would love to come to terms with technology. I am quite old fashioned in this way. 
My husband gets this so much better than me. We have been trying to tear apart my fears and biases and strongly uncomfortable feelings around children looking at ipod or computer or TV. .. I am looking at the clock and wondering if she will ever play with her toys again. I am worried about our 2 and 4 year Olds and their sudden increase in exposure to these technological devices. Our 2 year old daughter sits transfixed when something is on. I do have a really hard time with this.  All my Waldorf reading indicates they will contract some terrible disease at 35 if they are &quot;awakened&quot; too early from early academics or watching media. It&#39;s scary stuff and after reading Waldorf materials for the past three years I am now basically saying everything Mr Steiner said was rubbish! Oh it&#39;s very confusing. 
My husband says if I can just come to peace with this part of life (which I constantly ask myself does it have to be part of life... Plenty of people don&#39;t have televisions) I will be able to embrace unschooling.  Or rather if I can embrace the technology I will be closer to getting unschooling.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070240113">I was cited and linked in a blog post called <br/>
How Much Screen Time is Healthy?<br/>
BY TEACHERS WITH APPS · MARCH 24, 2013 · BLOG · 1 COMMENT<br/>
<br/>
I used to get excited if I was quoted by total strangers, but this one is a bit lame. I don&#39;t like it when a blogger doesn&#39;t use her name.  I want to know who&#39;s saying what, in the world.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s had one (1) comment.  Maybe it&#39;s good that not many people are reading it.<br/>
<br/>
My name links to my &quot;Screentime Index Page,&quot; but the reference says <br/>
Sandra Dodd, from Unschooled<br/>
<br/>
So now that the complaints are stated, still there&#39;s an article here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://teacherswithapps.com/how-much-screen-time-is-healthy/#wp-comments">http://teacherswithapps.com/how-much-screen-time-is-healthy/#wp-comments</a><br/>
<br/>
The one comment she posted was <br/>
<br/>
[...] How Much Screen Time is Healthy? I wasn&#39;t expecting such diverse reactions to opinions surrounding kids and the amount of time spent in front of screens.  [...]<br/>
<br/>
(The ellipses were in it; maybe the blog owner edited it down?  I don&#39;t know.)<br/>

No need for TV there!!!!<br><br>I know I am being picky here . I am glad you are trying to look into your fears and your husband is so supportive. <br>I wish people did not get so scared by
 doom-professing people. You know the run of the mill If your child watches TV their brain will melt and they will have a horrible disease by the time they are 35 or your child will be living in your basement and a looser because they love video game.<br><br><br></div><div style="font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"><div style="font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1431603316y_msg_container"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905"><div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905ygrp-mlmsg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905ygrp-msg" style=""><div id="ygrps-yiv-1431603316yiv1283246905ygrp-text">

This is not the place to say what and why, but it is a place to say keep going, keep reading on unschooling and not looking back on what steiner wrote - how could he have known the&nbsp;damage to being &#39;awakened&#39; to early media if it&nbsp;didn&#39;t exist then?

      Yes thank you.  It is very big to her especially since we got wifi hooked up in our house on weekend.
It helps to put self into child&#39;s shoes with husband example. Offers that insight where you are indeed a partner not a dictator.
I would love to come to terms with technology. I am quite old fashioned in this way.
My husband gets this so much better than me. We have been trying to tear apart my fears and biases and strongly uncomfortable feelings around children looking at ipod or computer or TV. .. I am looking at the clock and wondering if she will ever play with her toys again. I am worried about our 2 and 4 year Olds and their sudden increase in exposure to these technological devices. Our 2 year old daughter sits transfixed when something is on. I do have a really hard time with this.  All my Waldorf reading indicates they will contract some terrible disease at 35 if they are &quot;awakened&quot; too early from early academics or watching media. It&#39;s scary stuff and after reading Waldorf materials for the past three years I am now basically saying everything Mr Steiner said was rubbish! Oh it&#39;s very confusing.
My husband says if I can just come to peace with this part of life (which I constantly ask myself does it have to be part of life... Plenty of people don&#39;t have televisions) I will be able to embrace unschooling.  Or rather if I can embrace the technology I will be closer to getting unschooling.<br>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You *should* be worried if your daughter gets transfixed by something!<br/>
<br/>
So you can&#39;t relax until you can see what&#39;s *really* happening that you&#39;re *labeling* transfixed. Until then you&#39;re just trying to stuff your fears down. That&#39;s not good! The fears will fester and pop back up unexpectedly.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s engaged. She&#39;s found games and other things that seem to her to understand what she&#39;s curious about. They&#39;re answering her questions. They&#39;re showing her new things she&#39;s likely to be curious about and she is curious about some of them. And she then has the freedom to explore them.<br/>
<br/>
Games are incredibly empowering! Kids get to control what they pursue. And they are given the power to pursue it. The younger you are the more road blocks that real life puts in your path to pursuing interests. Real life makes young kids dependent on adults who may not have the patience or time to support a child investigating their curiosities. Real life sets up roadblocks of time, money, distance and all sorts of other things. With games it&#39;s all right there in reach of a finger. If you make a mistake, no adult will make you feel embarrassed or point it out. Games provide *real* feedback that something didn&#39;t work. So you get to try again. And again. You can even *deliberately* choose wrong to see what will happen and learn more about how the world (or the rules) work.<br/>
<br/>
You want to grab all that power and freedom away from her. So she can do what? Play with physical toys that make *you* feel better?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our 2 year old daughter sits transfixed<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she were transfixed, that means all our kids are (or were) also transfixed. <br/>
<br/>
So what does that mean? Did we not care that our kids were transfixed? And now that some of our kids are older, do we not see or care about the damage it caused to our kids? Are we so in love with a philosophy that we&#39;d recommend other parents damage their kids too?<br/>
<br/>
Which is more likely? That your daughter is transfixed? Or that you&#39;re mislabeling what you&#39;re seeing?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; All my Waldorf reading indicates they will contract some terrible disease at <br/>
&gt; 35 if they are &quot;awakened&quot; too early from early academics or watching media.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Television has been around (in significant numbers) since the 1950s. Computers since the end of the 70&#39;s. Why is it that only these Waldorf people -- as opposed to the legions of scientists who would be naturally curious about such connections -- have noticed these diseases and how they connect to technology?<br/>
<br/>
Waldorf writers are playing on the natural instinct of mothers to want to protect their children from scary things. And what do they get? They get people to buy their books and send their kids to their schools.<br/>
<br/>
I believe Waldorf people believe what they&#39;re saying. I believe they do want to protect people from what they believe are horrible things. The thing is that once someone accepts that their fears might be real, they start filtering the world through that fear. They pull in all the ideas that support their fears which bolsters their confidence that they&#39;re right to fear. And they dismiss anything that would cause them to question their fears. The fear becomes like a big comfortable wall between you and what will harm your children.<br/>
<br/>
*If* you want to support your children rather than your fears, those fears need to be dragged out in the light to be examined. (As you say you are :-)) <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; which I constantly ask myself does it have to be part of life... <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were living alone, technology would definitely not have to be part of *your* life. You could make that choice.<br/>
<br/>
But you have a family and your choices impact them. You&#39;re deciding that *they* shouldn&#39;t have TV just because you don&#39;t want it.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to unschool, then you&#39;ll need to find a way to live your values in such a way that others can peacefully pursue what they values. Vegetarian and organic loving unschooling parents *can* find ways to eat and prepare what they believe is best while supporting their kids exploring the world of food.<br/>
<br/>
With TV fears, it&#39;s often much easier for a parent to drag her dislike out into the light to examine it. It&#39;s much harder to create an environment where everyone can watch what they want in peace and feel supported while you avoid it! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So *is* it just the Waldorf message that began your fears? Or did Waldorf feed fears that were already there? Can you trace the roots of your fears back? Does it go deeper than technology? Is there something you fear not having control of because of something bad in your past?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240609490">Yes in You are your child&#39;s first teacher by rahima Baldwin Dancy there is a quote from one of Steiners lectures in 1924 in chapter 13 about how illnesses in later life are related to influences in first 7 years and if a child is taken out of their dreamy fluid heavenly state too early (before loss of baby teeth) from exposure to things that stimulate the intellect.  Yep is all there in that book. My husband had no time for any of it.  But once you have read this stuff Gee is hard to unread it if that makes sense. It has made sense to me but to enable this dream state to be then one must live on another planet I feel.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189077451">I read in one of my early childhood development textbooks that babies gazing at tree branches crossed over their heads against the sky stimulates their intellect.  Do waldorf parents have to keep their babies from gazing at tree branches too?<br/>
<br/>
What kind of evidence and research does this author base the idea on that children have a &#39;fluid dreamy&#39; state that lasts 7ish years that will be ruined by tv?<br/>
<br/>
And what about the parent fearing most of the real world, the idea that the real world is a dangerous place- that fear doesn&#39;t do anything to ruin this &#39;fluid dreamy&#39; state for the child?<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t unread words. But you can choose not to let them haunt you.<br/>
<br/>
Stress, anxiety-- those can definitely have a big impact on the body&#39;s immune system, and on diseases in later life, like heart disease. That&#39;s not special information only certain people have figured out and have the secret to- it&#39;s pretty well known, scientifically documented fact.<br/>
<br/>
And escapism- escapism is a tool for coping with stress. If you don&#39;t want children who need to escape, work on what you can do to make their lives peaceful, loving, and fun. A mom who is afraid of the things her children love won&#39;t do that as well as one who sees the value in them, and appreciates the joy they bring.<br/>
A lot of literature is called &#39;escapist.&#39;<br/>
People talk about &#39;escaping&#39; into nature.<br/>
<br/>
Waldorf schools and philosophies strike me as rather escapist. <br/>
<br/>
Escaping into fantasies helped me survive my childhood.  I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true of a lot of people.  But, a childhood that a child doesn&#39;t have to escape from (like escaping from a fear-filled, anxious mom, or a world filled with attractive but toxic, dangerous things), would be a lot better.  <br/>

I read TONS of books (by Steiner and by his followers), ran a discussion group from my house AND a biodynamic discussion group when we had our biodynamic farm. I had the perfect little Waldorf homestead and my house looked like a Waldorf kindergarden. I made all my needle-felted props (with homemade plant-dyed wool!!) to tell stories to my girls (Waldorf-approved stories, of course!!) and had a very strong daily, weekly and yearly rhythm... Sooooo, I know where you are coming from. But you know what? I kept going to bed (memorizing my stories... and talking to the girls angels, of course!) and wondering: when will we have fun together? When will it get easier? What&#39;s the point of all this if I feel like going through the day is just a reproduction of a script?<br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I was on Waldorf forums and kept asking about my girls not wanting to participate in circle time, not wanting to go outside when it was &quot;time&quot;, etc. and all I got was: reign those little girls back in! And it did not felt right... Finally, I came accross Sandra&#39;s Website and Big Book and Rue Kream&#39;s book and others and it all made sense. I remember reading those books on a camping trip with my girls and it was a revelation. Everything changed. And we started having fun! It felt so right...</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Of course, I didn&#39;t drop everything all at once. It was a slow transition (fortunately, my girls were still quite young, so we were still in the early childhood phase), but a sure one to more authenticity and more joy. That being said, it is a long process to let go of those Waldorf-induced fears. The only cure is to watch your child, watch movies with them (and if you do not care for the movie, watch them watch the movie and how their little faces light up!). Forget Steiner and his funky ideas, look at your children. They are your inspiration, not Steiner. Trust that their joy is much more important than some quirky ideas about how to raise children from 100 years ago. Steiner was an interesting man, but he lived a long time ago and we need to be here and now, WITH your children.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Need to go and fix lunch!</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Love,</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Catherine Forest<br></p></div>

Maybe all the blogs I have read are just pretending.

When potatoes are eaten in large quantities, the head becomes a kind of stomach and also digests ... This kind of knowledge can never be derived from natural science. When things are genuinely investigated with respect to their spiritual quality, it becomes apparent that in this modern age humanity has been seriously injured by the excessive consumption of potatoes.&quot;</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif">But learning more about unschooling and noticing how things really are with your children will be more helpful than lingering over the waldorf stuff. &nbsp;From what I understand, Waldorf education is extremely prescriptive - children need this at this time and so on. &nbsp;Unschooling allows children to grow and learn in their own unique ways and times, as they did when they were little children learning to walk and talk. &nbsp;It&#39;s an awesome way to learn. &nbsp;That guy in charge of a European school a century ago with all those confident but wacky ideas, didn&#39;t know what will help your children thrive today. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif">When children are supported in exploring what they&#39;re drawn to, their learning will be joyful, deep, complex and wonderful to witness. &nbsp;Enjoy their explorations of the world, help them with it, support them in it, share it.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif">Debbie.</font></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div><font class="ygrps-yiv-612519428Apple-style-span" face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div></html></div>
