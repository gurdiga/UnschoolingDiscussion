&lt;&lt; Never telling another human I love what to do or not do isn&#39;t my goal. <br/>
Respecting their wishes and desires IS. But if someone wants to do something that <br/>
bothers another person I will ask them to stop, and if they choose to <br/>
continue a harmful behavior I will TELL them to stop. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.<br/>
<br/>
I had an example of telling someone to do something two nights ago.  I was <br/>
sleeping in a reclining-chair-end of a couch (&quot;Kirby&#39;s couch&quot; which he got for <br/>
helping some people move), and Holy was sleeping next to me on the rest of the <br/>
couch.  I have pneumonia/bronchitis/something nasty and couldn&#39;t sleep lying <br/>
down for a couple of nights).   Marty had been upstairs in Kirby&#39;s room on the <br/>
computer.  I woke up when he was coming downstairs, and he was turning lights <br/>
off in the kitchen and such up there, and when he got to his room he hadn&#39;t <br/>
turned off the light on the stairs, and it wasn&#39;t RIGHT in my face, but it was <br/>
bright.  I said &quot;Marty, turn the light off on the stairs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ask him nicely, I just told him.   I didn&#39;t say it mean, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t say it loudly because I didn&#39;t want to wake Holly up.  I didn&#39;t add extra <br/>
words for the same reason.<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;I&#39;d rather leave it on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah.  That&#39;s his nightlight.  He leaves the door to his room open, and <br/>
that light on the stairs makes light on the wall he sees from his bed.  I had <br/>
forgotten, for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Okay,&quot; and I turned over the other way a little and went back to <br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I couldn&#39;t go to sleep with it on.  I had gone to sleep before <br/>
with a big fire in the fireplace, Totoro on TV, and that light on on the <br/>
stairs.<br/>
<br/>
And I was the one sleeping in &quot;the wrong place.&quot;  I have a darker room.   So <br/>
being more in Marty&#39;s territory, I let him make that call.<br/>
