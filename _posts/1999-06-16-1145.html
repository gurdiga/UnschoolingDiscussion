<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129005615">Dear Friends,<br/>
<br/>
The team compiling the votes to select a name for the new national<br/>
organization for homeschoolers have narrowed the selections down to the top<br/>
four choices.  We would ask that you AGAIN send in your<br/>
votes, but this time for only one of the four listed below.  In the event<br/>
that you list two, we will take the FIRST choice listed.  Please put<br/>
National Org. Name in your subject line, to make sorting this mail more<br/>
efficient.  Votes can be sent to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NatOrgName@...">NatOrgName@...</a> with a cc: to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Herbladee@...">Herbladee@...</a>.<br/>
<br/>
Listed in no particular order:<br/>
<br/>
 - National Home Educator&#39;s Alliance<br/>
 - National Home Education Association<br/>
 - National Home Education Network<br/>
 - Homeschooling Community Network<br/>
<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
The accounting team of Jeri and Mary</div>
