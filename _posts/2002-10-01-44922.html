<div id="ygrps-yiv-779736979">Hi,<br/>
I have used a sling style called a rebozo (there might be a website on it).  <br/>
basically, it&#39;s a very large piece of cloth which you fold in half <br/>
lengthwise, tie in a square knot and carry the baby in the pocket that&#39;s <br/>
formed.  It goes on your shoulder and neck like a purse.  It can also be <br/>
used as a playmat at the park, and is a great burp cloth.  I bought my <br/>
fabric at the $1/yd. table at the store.  The hardest thing was finding a <br/>
boyish material.<br/>
