left them right here on the counter...  Wait, maybe they fell off into this <br/>
basket.  No....  I&#39;m going to check between the sofa cushions.  I&#39;m mean, I <br/>
just saw them a couple of days ago!  Grrrrr.  I&#39;ll have to get back to you.<br/>

&quot;y&#39;all&quot;. Once Eric relaxes, he&#39;ll join in. It just takes him a while. It took <br/>
longer to get home. I took the wrong Rt 15 exit off 29S. I hate driving in <br/>
the dark. It started snowing too. Gorgeous. Typical VA though; it&#39;s almost <br/>
gone.<br/>
When it gets warmer, we&#39;ll open up our home to everyone. We&#39;re surrounded by <br/>
lots of woods plus have a pool. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830717846">Yes, thank you Shyrley! It was great meeting folks. And Eric was a big help getting<br/>
Jason set up with Spyro and helping him figure it out. :o) Also a big help to me,<br/>
since I got to stay a bit longer! How long did you guys wind up staying? I left<br/>
around 3:30 I think. <br/>
