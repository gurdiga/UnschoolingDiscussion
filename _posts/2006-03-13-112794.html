educators who don&#39;t know any more about unschooling than they read in  <br/>
a magazine or  newspaper article, or than they heard in quick summary  <br/>
from a reporter isn&#39;t really &quot;balanced reporting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly, Brenna and Roya (all of whose moms read here) were interviewed  <br/>
for a short article in the April ElleGirl magazine.  ElleGirl is all  <br/>
about fashion and make-up, and though the cover of every issue says  <br/>
&quot;Dare to be Different!&quot; I don&#39;t think they&#39;re advocating TOO much  <br/>
difference.    The magazine is only $1.99 in the U.S., but it&#39;s more  <br/>
in Canada and the U.K. (2.99 canadian, 2.50 in pounds).  I don&#39;t know  <br/>
how readily available it is, and the article isn&#39;t that great, so you  <br/>
can look at the one I scanned to show Holly&#39;s grandmother if you want  <br/>
to.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ellegirl2006april">http://sandradodd.com/ellegirl2006april</a><br/>

This current newspaper article under discussion is WAY, way better,  <br/>
but the &quot;balance&quot; is equally lame, in my opinion.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a little commentary on the ellegirl thing here:<br/>

The standard isn&#39;t very high for the  Chicago Tribune article to be better<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66823135">COOL!  It wasn&#39;t just half a page of irritating fluff.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was posted to my blog:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old daughter Mallory and I just read the article in Elle  <br/>
Girl, actually that&#39;s why I bought the magazine.<br/>
 From the article I saw your website and right now I&#39;m reading  <br/>
everything I can get my hands on that has to do with homeschooling or  <br/>
unschooling. This past year is our first experience learning at home.  <br/>
Mal came to us asking to try 8th grade at home not wanting to deal  <br/>
with the madness at middle school anymore, and although it&#39;s gone  <br/>
very well the curriculum I purchased is still very structured and  <br/>
classroom like. Mal is an amazing writer and artist and I would love  <br/>
to just let her focus on that for a while but my fears of her being  <br/>
college ready hold me back. I know I still have much to learn but  <br/>
because of Moms like you willing to put the experiences of your  <br/>
wonderful family out there for others to learn from maybe I&#39;ll catch  <br/>
up sooner than later.</div>

That&#39;s cool.  You just never know when something you say will affect someone<br/>
in such a positive way.  <br/>
