<div id="ygrps-yiv-446967548">Issue 5 of *Connections: ezine of unschooling and mindful parenting* is <br/>
out and loaded with some really wonderful articles. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://connections.organiclearning.org">http://connections.organiclearning.org</a><br/>
<br/>
Jan Hunt, director of the Natural Child Project, has an article in this <br/>
month&#39;s issue titled &quot;Learning Through Play&quot; that offers inspiration and <br/>
some really fabulous pictures of her always-unschooled son, Jason, who&#39;s <br/>
now 25!<br/>
<br/>
Arun Pradhan, an Aussie dad, takes us on his journey into the <br/>
mind-blowing paradigm shift of radical unschooling and mindful parenting <br/>
in his article, &quot;Parenting is Making My Brain Hurt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Our regular columnists offer interesting and thoughtful discussions on <br/>
everything from creativity to music to comet-watching. Anne Ohman&#39;s <br/>
article, &quot;The Winter of Our Discontent,&quot; examines the world-expanding <br/>
nature of disquiet and restlessness, inviting us to explore and embrace <br/>
these feelings as opportunities to learn and grow. Ben Lovejoy details <br/>
his ongoing love-affair with music and how sharing that passion with his <br/>
oldest son has made the road to Bonnaroo Music Festival a road home for <br/>
them both. Kelly Lovejoy offers sage advice from a place of hind-sight; <br/>
Robyn Coburn encourages us to celebrate our children&#39;s inherent <br/>
creativity; Deb Lewis invites us to consider the importance of <br/>
connection and positive thinking; and Ren Allen explores the many ways <br/>
families share, learn and grow together.<br/>
<br/>
*Connections* is pleased to offer such an inspiring line up of articles <br/>
this month and excited to announce some upcoming changes in the ezine&#39;s <br/>
format as it continues to grow and evolve. As of next month&#39;s issue, <br/>
*Connections* will be moving to a bimonthly format--every two <br/>
months--allowing us to offer more in each issue, though original <br/>
subscribers will still receive the same number of issues for which they <br/>
subscribed.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be adding a new creative department by Ren Allen, modeled after <br/>
her &quot;Imagination Tribe&quot; and filled with inspiring ideas, tips, and <br/>
encouragement for the artist within, as well as adding a &quot;Marketplace&quot; <br/>
feature, offering a virtual mall of *unschooling* vendors--contact me to <br/>
find out how to list your business in the Marketplace.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps our most exciting news is that we&#39;ll be adding Laurie Chancey to <br/>
our list of regular columnists as of the June/July issue. Laurie, as <br/>
many of you know, is a grown unschooler and the inspiration for her <br/>
mother&#39;s book, _The Unprocessed Child_. Laurie will muse on her own life <br/>
as a sociology grad student, her childhood, her future and the world in <br/>
general in a column titled, &quot;Unprocessed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With this expansion, however, come the inevitable growing pains, and I&#39;m <br/>
sad to announce that the next issue will be Rue Kream&#39;s last as she <br/>
leaves us to spend more time with her family. I&#39;ve so enjoyed working <br/>
with Rue, and I know many along with me will miss her gentle wisdom and <br/>
firm advocacy for children in her &quot;Ask Rue&quot; column. I&#39;ve been honored to <br/>
help Rue&#39;s voice appear more regularly in the unschooling world, and <br/>
now, we&#39;ll all just have to bug her--ahem--*encourage her* to write that <br/>
second book!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for your support and enjoy!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743642572">Thanks, Danielle.  NICE ISSUE!!<br/>
<br/>
This was a very cool post to pull for Always Learning, but I wonder  <br/>
if you could add commas or put it as a list (as I&#39;m guessing it might  <br/>
have been) on this:<br/>
<br/>
I read that kids (everyone) learns all the time, from life, so  <br/>
anything they do can be thought of as a &quot;learning experience.&quot; How  <br/>
can a person fail at unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
A parent can fail at unschooling by being critical negative  <br/>
exasperated selfish bored boring depressed depressing cheap lazy  <br/>
insulting pessimistic cynical unwilling to change more concerned  <br/>
about their own mothers&#39; opinions than about being their children&#39;s  <br/>
best mother<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(If not, it&#39;s still readable, and I bet people will figure out it was  <br/>
formatted some other way originally...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
