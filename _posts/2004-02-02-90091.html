If it didn&#39;t help, I would respond to everything my mom said in that<br/>
sing-song voice people tend to reserve for children and then stand too<br/>
close, sit too close, etc..  It won&#39;t take long for mom to get annoyed and<br/>
you can point out that this is exactly how your daughter feels when they do<br/>
it to her.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
I&#39;ve recommended this once as well, but in a spanking situation. My friend&#39;s <br/>
mother was/is a spanker. One day my friend went over to pick up her <br/>
just-turned-two year old son from her mom&#39;s. The baby started screaming when he heard <br/>
his mom at the door. The grandmother went over and smacked him HARD on his bare <br/>
thigh---left a handprint---and said, &quot;I told you not to scream.&quot; My friend was <br/>
livid, snatched him up, and called me. She was completely distraught; she had <br/>
asked her mom many times NOT to spank him. Her mother&#39;s answer to *this* one <br/>
was that she had repeatedly told him (just two years old!) not to scream.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested that the next time it happens (because we ALL knew it would!) she <br/>
should walk over to her mother and smack her bare thigh as hard as she could <br/>
and scream, &quot;I&#39;ve told you and TOLD you NOT to spank my child! Don&#39;t do it <br/>
again!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Violence to end violence is stupid, I know. BUT! This grandmother had *never* <br/>
looked at it from the baby&#39;s point of view. NOW she knew it hurt, she knew it <br/>
was humiliating, and she was sorry----and not just for hitting her grandson, <br/>
but for hitting her daughter too.<br/>
<br/>
She hasn&#39;t done it again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d do the same thing to this mom who won&#39;t leave my child in peace. I&#39;d get <br/>
in her face, stay annoying, speak in the &quot;poodle voice&quot; and do everything <br/>
they&#39;ve been doing to my child for the entire visit. I used to be too shy and too <br/>
worried about what&#39;s proper socially, but I&#39;ve HAD it with the way some folks <br/>
want to treat my boys.<br/>
<br/>
You may now all scream at me for suggesting the spanking of a parent!&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Yes, but that&#39;s illegal and the mom could call the police and they would <br/>
come!  And the mom who hit her would probably have to go to jail (depending on <br/>
local domestic violence policies).<br/>
<br/>
And it was not illegal for the grandma to smack a baby that wasn&#39;t even hers.<br/>
<br/>
Sad, huh?<br/>
<br/>
When people I&#39;ve been with have chosen not to say anything to smacking moms <br/>
I&#39;ve said &quot;Wouldn&#39;t you say something if a man hit a woman at WalMart?&quot;   It&#39;s <br/>
been years since I&#39;ve just let something go by without saying something.  If a <br/>
parent is being really mean to a child I at least give them the big glare and <br/>
keep my eyes on them until they turn away nervously and become pointedly <br/>
nicer to the child.   I&#39;ve said &quot;Don&#39;t do that&quot; to strangers.  One cussed me.  One <br/>
said &quot;Mind your own business,&quot; but I didn&#39;t avert my eyes, and they were both <br/>
nicer right after that.   I haven&#39;t heard my neighbor behind me be hateful to <br/>
his kids one time since I marched out into our shared neighboring vacant lot <br/>
and told him to be nicer to his kids, in front of his kid and wife.    If he&#39;s <br/>
still being abusive, he&#39;s at least gotten quieter about it, which is what I <br/>
told him when he said it was none of my F**KING business.   I told him if I <br/>
could hear it from my house it was my business.<br/>
<br/>
But at least his kids know that other adults, and parents, disagree with his <br/>
dad&#39;s actions.<br/>
<br/>
The police were looking for him in the neighborhood TWICE after that and <br/>
didn&#39;t find him.  That might be inspiring him to tone down his evil ways too.<br/>
<br/>

I haven&#39;t had much trouble with other people.  My husband&#39;s mom is kinda <br/>
creepy-mean, but what I&#39;ve done when she&#39;s done something I didn&#39;t agree with was <br/>
to just talk directly to my child as though she were a lifesize animatronic <br/>
Disney character, and we could have a discussion without her hearing it or <br/>
something.  When she told Marty he couldn&#39;t have dessert, I just passed mine over <br/>
to him and said, &quot;Here, you can have mine&quot; without a glance at her, and he <br/>
didn&#39;t look at her either, when he smiled at me and said &quot;thanks!&quot;     When she <br/>
has said &quot;get down&quot; in public to toddlers I&#39;ve said, &quot;It&#39;s okay&quot; *to the <br/>
toddler* not to her.  I never used the exact words &quot;You can ignore grandma,&quot; but she <br/>
knew that&#39;s what it meant.    <br/>
<br/>
What I have done is when I&#39;m not directly in a stressful situation with her, <br/>
I&#39;ll tell her a story about some positive feedback we&#39;ve gotten on the kids, <br/>
or something cool they did, and I tell it in a conversational yet intructive <br/>
way.  She can take from it or not.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re big enough to defend themselves not, and I have no doubt they would.  <br/>
Her abuse is all in the disdain department, and insult.     Not hitting.  <br/>
