I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re new to the list, and that&#39;s cool, but I think it still <br/>
maintains quite an us-and-them dichotomy between parents and kids and <br/>
unschooling works better without so much of that.&gt;    I guess what I would like to add to that is that, not only is the above point a good one but also what I have noticed in my own parenting and in counselling other parents, is that this approach often does not work, period. In my own experience, especially this year, when I start the whole punishment and reward thing, I am setting everyone up for this crazy game, that is not built on mutual trust and relationship building. It is really hard sometimes (especially when we are talking about my almost three year old:) but I have been trying to just be patient with her and always try to figure out what it is she is trying to tell me, through the tantrum. For example today, she was throwing her weight around her bedroom, yelling, throwing the teddy bear, all as I was rearranging her room for her to allow for more space. Finally I stopped myself and looked at her and slowly sat down with her to ask her what it was. It was in this whole process of slowing down that we both connected. I was willing to take the time to hear her and it was so simple. She was upset because I was not letting her help enough! Poor little thing looked up at me with tears and told me, &quot;Sadie wants to sweep too, Mama!&quot; Ugh! It took us a good hour extra to accomplish the goal but did we EVER have fun! Kelli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412746105">See, now this is what I meant that I didn&#39;t expand my thoughts far<br/>
enough to let others read what I was trying to say. My kids have never<br/>
thrown a tantrum in their live&#39;s. We&#39;ve always &quot;used our words so mommy<br/>
knows what you want&quot; or &quot;show mommy - mommy doesn&#39;t understand&quot;. Maybe I<br/>
used the wrong term  _reward_ and I did NOT use the term punishment - I<br/>
said logical consequences. <br/>
 <br/>
Tracy - who agrees with your handling of this scenario - 100% and I<br/>
would have done the same - gotten to the bottom of the problem instead<br/>
of punishing her for throwing a fit.<br/>
