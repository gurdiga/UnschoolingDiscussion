<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689661491">Zach (9yo) has been gun crazy since before he could talk.  Our local 4-H<br/>
club has a skeet shooting project and Zach has joined up and gone out a few<br/>
times now for practice.  It is fairly expensive but we think we can manage<br/>
it if we watch our pennies.  Dh&#39;s guns are just too big for Zach (he&#39;s small<br/>
for his age) and the club&#39;s gun fitter recommended a .28 gauge over and<br/>
under shotgun for Zach.  He said we could pick one up for about $900.  That<br/>
was when our jaws hit the floor.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for anyone with any gun knowledge who might know how to go about<br/>
getting one cheaper.  I would just say forget it, but Zach is having soooo<br/>
much fun, I want to try to work this out if we can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528640685">My two boys (11 and 7) are &quot;gun crazy&quot; also, so we went to our first <br/>
gun show recently.  My daughter (9) went also but was not crazy <br/>
(about guns or being at the show).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we saw a number of shotguns for $100-200.  I bought a single <br/>
shot shotgun in WalMart for that price a few years ago (never used it <br/>
and hope I never have to).  <br/>
<br/>
Does it have to be over-and-under?  Maybe that is what jacks up the <br/>
price.<br/>
