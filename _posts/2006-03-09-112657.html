<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215513359">Along the accent line...it was very interesting to me (even if it was  <br/>
a &quot;duh&quot; moment) that non-English speakers usually cannot distinguish  <br/>

they can.  I just found that very interesting.<br/>

<br/>
In college a New Yorker seemed incredulous and irritated (one of  <br/>
those jealous moments among English majors, it seemed) because I  <br/>
could tell West Texas from East Texas in an accents exercise in a  <br/>
History of English class.  He couldn&#39;t tell Texas from anywhere else  <br/>
in the south.  But that&#39;s fine; he grew up very far from there. I  <br/>
never &quot;studied&quot; or analyzed to know the difference, it&#39;s just I just  <br/>
I had relatives in West Texas, and friends southeast of Austin, so I  <br/>
only had to know that one sample sounded  like my dozens of  <br/>
relatives,  and one sounded like Dave and Fran.  That was easy. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
The r&#39;s are different.<br/>
<br/>
Holly can understand Australian accents better than I can, and for no  <br/>
reason we know.  I don&#39;t think I would ever have heard New Zealand  <br/>
accents if not for the special features on the Lord of the Rings  <br/>
movies.  (And again I was grateful for DVD subtitles.)  I liked the  <br/>
story of so many people only learning after it was over that Brad  <br/>
Dourif was American.  He used the accent he was using for Wormtongue  <br/>
the whole time so he&#39;d have it, and only when the filming was all  <br/>
done did he use his own voice.<br/>
<br/>
When we were staying in east Yorkshire she could understand people  <br/>
better than I could.  If they knew we were American they could  <br/>
rephrase, but if they used their regular shortcut phrases full speed,  <br/>
assuming I would understand, I was baffled, but Holly usually got it  <br/>
the first time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of the best things about lists like this, that even though  <br/>
there are problems with communicating in writing, at least we don&#39;t  <br/>
have accent problems.<br/>

 -= We&#39;ve noticed similar things in my family.   Dh can understand people<br/>
with accents we&#39;re<br/>
not used to hearing much quicker than myself.  Yet, I can usually say where<br/>
someone&#39;s accent<br/>
was acquired from and he can&#39;t unless, it seems, he&#39;s known someone<br/>
personally from that area.<br/>
 <br/>
-= He was a military brat and heard accents all his life.  The first time I<br/>
remember any personal <br/>
interaction with anyone with an accent was when a family member married<br/>
someone from <br/>
NC.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566237516">My mom is the same way.  She&#39;s 4th or so generation Texan, and she  <br/>
can tell what *part* of East Texas they&#39;re from (such as Dallas vs  <br/>
Houston).  She also used to be able to tell which state in the south  <br/>
someone was from based on their accent.  Not so much now that people  <br/>
are working to loose their accents, which I just do not get.  I like  <br/>
accents.  They&#39;re cool.<br/>

after being ridiculed in school in California for my accent and  <br/>
therefore lost it)<br/>
