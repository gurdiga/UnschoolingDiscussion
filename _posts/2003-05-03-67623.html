<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912333991">I have also looked for websites with content that we have covered, but that we don&#39;t necessarily have documentation for.<br/>
<br/>
For example, in December we got up early to see the brightest stars:  Venus and Mars were converged, making a VERY big &quot;star&quot; near the moon.<br/>
<br/>
I got the girls up and we looked at, identified it, talked about planets, talked about the sun, the moon, day and night, and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
How do I document that?  I don&#39;t keep a daily journal anymore (and yes, I do live in PA) because I refuse to give the district something that the law does NOT require.  But I *will* find websites that cover that information and submit the links in my log of book titles or print them for &quot;samples&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840904481">&lt;&lt;And it may not be any easier for me with our move to NC---they have <br/>
testing there!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering about that.  I know some states require testing and I&#39;ve <br/>
heard the scores don&#39;t matter.  Three questions...<br/>
<br/>
Why test if the scores don&#39;t matter??<br/>
<br/>
Who actually sees these tests??<br/>
<br/>
In states where the scores DO matter, what happens if the child is below <br/>
*grade* level??<br/>
<br/>
I always think that must be a hard thing to deal with.  We have great <br/>
homeschooling laws in Texas, only matched by Alaska, if I&#39;m correct and we <br/>
require really nothing.  We are *required* to teach the very basics, <br/>
reading, math, spelling and good citizenship.  I think I&#39;m leaving one out, <br/>
but the bottom line is...no one ever checks in and we never have to check <br/>
out, so to speak.<br/>

Same with New Mexico.  It lists what subjects you&#39;re supposed to teach <br/>
(&quot;provide instruction&quot; is their term), and you&#39;re supposed to do &quot;comparable&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-686816484">Here in Maine, they say the amount of days and subjects we need to cover but <br/>
do not say how to cover them.  <br/>
We have portfolios but all that they are asking is to show progress and maybe <br/>
a list of things we did.<br/>
We where just talking about this on Friday at a meeting. We figure our <br/>
children learn 365 days a year and over 4 hours a day.  Two years in one? Im <br/>
kidding but really if you think about it 365 days we should be able to stop <br/>
notifying the state by say......age 15 right?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545983998">Well, here in Va, we have to either have a portfolio evaluation (which means for the most<br/>
part you have to comply with the Va Standards of Learning (SOLs (yup that is the name)) or<br/>
test. The school focus on the SOLs was definitely a reason for us homeschooling so I<br/>
do not want to go the portfolio route. Luckily we do not have to test for kindergarten so<br/>
we have another year before jumping through that hoop.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why test if the scores don&#39;t matter??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our scores &quot;technically&quot; matter in that we do have to report them. Some states require you<br/>
to test but do not have to report the scores. I have no idea why...I guess to look like<br/>
they are keeping tabs on what hsers are doing?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Who actually sees these tests??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have to submit them to the superintendent I believe (actually we only have to test in<br/>
Math and Language Arts).<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In states where the scores DO matter, what happens if the <br/>
&gt; child is below <br/>
&gt; *grade* level??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here you only have to be above the 4th stanine (23rd percentile). If not you go on<br/>
probation for a year. If the scores are not brought up them I believe you have to<br/>
put your kid back in school. However, if it looks like your child will not pass<br/>
a standardized test, you can always go the portfolio route or choose a different test.<br/>

it&#39;s nothing new---with my business, I had to write EVERTHING down so I would <br/>
get it done (I didn&#39;t write Alex&#39;s birthday down last week; and if her mother <br/>
hadn&#39;t have called yesterday morning, Duncan wouldn&#39;t have gone. I&#39;d <br/>
forgotten). When we&#39;ve stayed up late to star-gaze, I write &quot;star-gaze, <br/>
1-3:30&quot; or whatever. Some things I write before the fact, some after. I also <br/>
have disposable cameras all over the house and in the cars, just in case. I <br/>
have more than a dozen wating to be developed!<br/>
<br/>
None of this is FOR documentation. It just so happens that it QUALIFIES as <br/>
documentation! &lt;g&gt; And in SC we do have to keep attendance and a journal or <br/>
portfolio---and cover certain &quot;subjects&quot;. All that&#39;s done simply and easily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402978479">Here&#39;s in CT we have fairly relaxed laws as well.<br/>
<br/>
By law you don&#39;t have to register in order to homeschool - there is a &#39;guideline&#39; that says you should and then I think you do the portfolio thing at the end of the year.  .  If they catch you homeschooling without registering I think you have to fill in their form.  Which lists subjects you&#39;ll cover etc.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &#39;have&#39; to start homeschooling until age 7<br/>
<br/>
As Brogan is only 3 we have awhile before we have to worry about anything official.  I&#39;m not going to file (unless discovered) - afterall it&#39;s only a guideline :-)<br/>

 Computer test with pictures etc and I let my boys decide what test they want <br/>

the 2nd grade test last year and the 1st grade test this year, he found both <br/>
to be very easy.  By age he should probably be taking 3rd or 4th grade, <br/>
although I am not really sure.  Doesn&#39;t matter to me and the state doesn&#39;t <br/>
say it has to be a grade appropriate test.  They just say test once a year.  <br/>
No punishments, no level they have to meet, etc.<br/>

Laura D&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cool!  I do think a lot of homeschoolers take the laws too generally.  If it <br/>
were me, I&#39;d probably never even thought of that!  Not that I think the <br/>
state should even have anything to do with it, I don&#39;t, but it seems like if <br/>
they are going to require testing, having the parents shell out money for a <br/>
piece of paper that basically proves the child is in a test-taking situation <br/>
once a year is just silly! Makes you wonder if it&#39;s just a bunch of people <br/>
sitting around with nothing else to do but meddle, and *then* they can&#39;t <br/>
even agree on an outcome.   Person A says, we need to test, person B says no <br/>
way, so they agree to disagree and decide you *must* test but they won&#39;t <br/>
care about the scores in the end anyway.  Sheesh!  Great proof as to why the <br/>
government should keep it&#39;s nose out from the get-go, in my opinion.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt;Why test if the scores don&#39;t matter??<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;1.  Because it is required by law&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL!  Another word jumble.  Actually, I meant, why would the *state* test if <br/>
they don&#39;t keep up with the scores. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some places will require it so that just in case you get in trouble with the <br/>
county (township/region/province/whatever) you can prove something to someone <br/>
if the court requires it.<br/>
<br/>
The same way people ask homeschoolers about times tables and socialization, <br/>
professional educators and interested parents who are opposed to unschooling <br/>
will ask administration and the state, &quot;Don&#39;t they have to be TESTED?&quot;   The <br/>
right answer to shut them up is &quot;Yeah, they have to be tested too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico for years there were only three grades at which homeschoolers <br/>
were required by law to test.  The scores went in as a batch so the state <br/>
could look at the scores of homeschoolers--how they were doing as a batch.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the way the school&#39;s scores go in too.  <br/>
<br/>
The uses made of those scores are two kinds, and none applied to <br/>
homeschoolers.  The schools use them as first pass (or last) in placing kids <br/>
in classes and determining special ed.  And the batch scores are used to <br/>
apply for funding (state or federal special programs or extra funding).<br/>
<br/>
Since homeschoolers have no special ed classes or advanced or remedial, and <br/>
since the state and federals wouldn&#39;t give them any money if they could, they <br/>
dropped the test score.<br/>
<br/>
Happy speculation among some homeschoolers is that the scores were so high it <br/>
was embarrassing the state.  They could be true.  MOST (way most) <br/>
homeschoolers weren&#39;t testing their kids anyway.  They were either just <br/>
ditching, not registering, or registering twice for a grade that didn&#39;t test <br/>
and then registering for the grade past the test.  <br/>
<br/>
So for some combo of those reasons, New Mexico no longer requires testing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989385458">Another thing to consider about PA and testing is that while we are <br/>
required to give tests in grades 3,5 and 8, nowhere does the law say <br/>
that we&#39;re required to have our children in grades 3,5, or 8.  We&#39;re <br/>
required to report their ages on the affidavits, not their grades.  <br/>
Never put a grade level on an affidavit.  Some schools might insist <br/>
on knowing &quot;the grade level&quot; anyway and some won&#39;t.  Some people, <br/>
when challenged by their school districts, will say they use <br/>
an &quot;ungraded k-6 curriculum&quot;.  That *probably* wouldn&#39;t hold up in <br/>
court if the superintendent challenged it with a due process hearing, <br/>
but some people do it.  Depends on how friendly your school district <br/>
is!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-582899025">Here in CT it is very relaxed with the laws but they can give you a hard time <br/>
in regard to how they see the law concerning homeschooling and how we see it. <br/>
They push and actually tell you that it is the law to file a Notice Of Intent <br/>
which then means you are subject to a portfolio review at the end of each <br/>
school year. But our law clearly states that this is suggested procedure not <br/>
the law. This issue has been challenged many times in the state of CT. We had <br/>
to have a lawyer here in CT that stands up for children&#39;s rights to <br/>
homeschool in the state of CT help us with our case just so we would not <br/>
continue to be harassed and charged with truancy. There have been many <br/>
reports of the officials even sending Child Protective Services, school <br/>
officials, and the police right to honest peoples homes just because they <br/>
homeschool and have chosen NOT to file the Notice Of Intent. So while our law <br/>
may be more relaxed we still face people in our state that are pushing and <br/>
pushing to change those relaxed laws that we enjoy so much at this very <br/>
moment. And there are still families here that are targeted just because they <br/>
wont file a notice that is suggested not law.<br/>
<br/>
Kim<br/>
&lt;&lt; Here&#39;s in CT we have fairly relaxed laws as well.<br/>
<br/>
By law you don&#39;t have to register in order to homeschool - there is a <br/>
&#39;guideline&#39; that says you should and then I think you do the portfolio thing <br/>
at the end of the year.  .  If they catch you homeschooling without <br/>
registering I think you have to fill in their form.  Which lists subjects <br/>
you&#39;ll cover etc.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t &#39;have&#39; to start homeschooling until age 7<br/>
<br/>
As Brogan is only 3 we have awhile before we have to worry about anything <br/>
official.  I&#39;m not going to file (unless discovered) - afterall it&#39;s only a <br/>
guideline :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750339534">Here in Maine we also have the option of becoming a non-approved private<br/>
school.  By going  this route, you don&#39;t have to have a portfolio review<br/>
by a teacher or test.<br/>
 <br/>
This is the route I have taken this year and it has been great.  We had<br/>
to file a letter of intent with the state. (Actually, it&#39;s optional to<br/>
file it, believe it or not.)   We had to have at least two unrelated<br/>
kids in our *school*.  (two home school families who each home school<br/>
however they see fit in their own homes.)  We had to send another letter<br/>
to the superintendent that told him which kids from his school district<br/>
were in our private school.  We have to review our own kids quarterly<br/>
and say we covered the traditional subjects, which we do by living life.<br/>
I have my quarterly assessment on the computer and I just change the<br/>
date and print it out and file it.  It just says that I reviewed the<br/>
kids work for the first (second, third, fourth)  quarter of her second<br/>
grade year in the following subjects...math, language arts, etc. and<br/>
that I have found that satisfactory progress has been made.  I keep no<br/>
other records other than that quarterly assessment I write to myself.  <br/>
 <br/>
If creating a non-approved private school is an option in other states,<br/>
I would look into it.   It sounded intimidating until I actually did it.<br/>
It&#39;s easier than filing as a homeschooler.  The only drawbacks I can<br/>
think of are that we aren&#39;t counted as homeschoolers and we cannot<br/>
participate in any public school activities, which is an issue for some<br/>
people but not for us.  I want to stay as far away from the public<br/>
school system as possible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I liked Florida too...you register with a &quot;private&quot; umbrella school, then you <br/>
just sort of drop off the face of the earth to the public school system...no <br/>
worries!!  West Virginia is awful, IMO.  We&#39;ve never had to jump through so <br/>
many hoops, and never had the state change legislation/laws so often.  <br/>
Hopefully the last one will stick for a while.<br/>
