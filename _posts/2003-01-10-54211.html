&lt;&lt; Yeah, Joyce said that, but I had replied my &quot;OH NO NOT Big Bird&quot; statement <br/>
to <br/>
something Sandra had said about Ned going around bashing Big Bird.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mention Big Bird.  I mentioned teachers and schools.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce voiced one of Ned&#39;s opinions without saying it was Ned. <br/>
I don&#39;t believe Joyce agrees with the radical opinion that Big Bird is an <br/>
agent of the evil government.  <br/>
<br/>
The Big Brother has to do with the government watching individuals in their <br/>
homes.  There&#39;s no way for Big Bird to do that in any incarnation, so that&#39;s <br/>
probably why people didn&#39;t respond.  <br/>
<br/>
Many comments are made which get no response.  It&#39;s common and commentary on <br/>
that or explanations of why responses weren&#39;t made aren&#39;t productive to the <br/>
unschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
My kids loved Sesame Street, learned lots from it, still sings songs from it, <br/>
Holly still watches it...   Holly, Keith and I sang a really old Bert & Ernie <br/>
song at the music party last Friday which we have on a sing-along tape.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My question was geared toward how to handle stuff that you may consider <br/>
going against your values or ideals within the context of unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Where was the very recent discussion on mature video games which extended <br/>
into movies too?  I thought it was here.  <br/>
<br/>
I grew up with and around people who controlled (tried to control) their <br/>
children&#39;s exposure so that they would grow up innocent and with the illusion <br/>
that all the world was like their surroundings.  That would be the Southern <br/>
Baptists.   <br/>
<br/>
Rather than give my children something to rebel against, I try to give them <br/>
everything that casually comes along, and to always give them more than one <br/>
point of view so they can do some of  their social discoveries now while <br/>
they&#39;re safe at home with people to discuss it with instead of hearing of <br/>
some things for the very first time when they&#39;re off with just other people <br/>
their age, <br/>
and maybe one of them is trying to persuade them to be/do/try something they <br/>
only just then heard of.<br/>
<br/>
If kids were in school and heard something the parents were opposed to, the <br/>
parents could indignantly blame the school (for saying homosexuality wasn&#39;t <br/>
necessarily an abomination, or that humans and apes and monkeys were all <br/>
primates, or something else that opens the gates of hell).  With unschooling, <br/>
I can&#39;t blame school or a curriculum, and I see no reason to &quot;blame&quot; anyone <br/>
anyway.  I see opportunities.  <br/>
<br/>
I do avoid the news.  This week is a dead baby fest on the news.<br/>
<br/>
But Holly asked today why her dad hadn&#39;t wanted to go see what the lights <br/>
were (an apparent accident 1/4 mile up from our turnoff).  I said he probably <br/>
didn&#39;t think she really wanted to see.  But Holly has a fascination with <br/>
accidents that neither of her brothers ever had, and had it been just me and <br/>
Holly, I would&#39;ve driven by.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a value or ideal to show her wrecks, it&#39;s respecting her expressed <br/>
curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sorry if I missed something here, but are you saying that you wouldn&#39;t<br/>

It really depends on what it is. Vegetarians have mentioned letting their<br/>
kids choose whatever they want to eat outside the home. Peacelovers have<br/>
said their kids have toy weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect religion is a bit tricky for some people. I can imagine it being<br/>
incredibly tough to explore outside a faith if you&#39;re certain other paths<br/>
are not only false but misleading.<br/>

simply triggered my question.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s really hard to know when to allow your kids to not do <br/>
something that you think they need.  <br/>
<br/>
From a homeopthic point of view, I&#39;m facing that now.  My son (5 <br/>
years old) has been going to a homeopath for awhile and was cured of <br/>
food allergies.  But he still has this thing where he hates to leave <br/>
the house, and he&#39;s being treated for that.  So he hates to leave the <br/>
house, is mad because he&#39;s there, and refuses to take a remedy that <br/>
will make it easier for him to leave his house.  Would you hold him <br/>
down and force him to take it?  <br/>
<br/>
If your child had a serious cavity and didn&#39;t want to go get it <br/>
filled, do you make him?  How many parents would really be at peace <br/>
with watching their child&#39;s teeth fall out if that&#39;s what the parents <br/>
choose?  Yet there are some adults who choose to not treat cavities <br/>
and not go to the dentist.  When do we let go? <br/>
<br/>
What if his appendix burst and he refused to go to the hospital for <br/>
an operation?  Do you let him stay home and die?  <br/>
<br/>
At some point I think all parents would step in and say, &quot;I am going <br/>
to take care of your needs whether you like it or not&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem comes in when parents think their child &quot;needs&quot; a <br/>
classical education.  Or they &quot;need&quot; socialization.  Or they &quot;need&quot; <br/>
to be punished for irresponsibility.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; How many parents would really be at peace <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen a child&#39;s teeth fall out.  <br/>
The ultimate exaggerations (he&#39;ll never read, his teeth will fall out, he&#39;ll <br/>
watch TV all the time if I let him) never seem to happen.<br/>
<br/>
If a tooth hurts a child will complain.  There are cures short of removal of <br/>
the baby teeth.  There are short-term remedies, and such pain might come and <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have said &quot;I think I need to go to the dentist now&quot; when things have <br/>
hurt (and more often things were caught early while they were there, found in <br/>
x-rays or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if his appendix burst and he refused to go to the hospital for <br/>
an operation?  Do you let him stay home and die?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That kind of pain blacks people right out.<br/>
Do you know any stories (even one) of someone choosing to stay home and die <br/>
of something like that?<br/>
<br/>
I tried to press Kirby to go to the doctor for a wart he had on the bottom of <br/>
his foot.  He kept saying no, and just limping and whining.  One day he said <br/>
&quot;I think I need to go to the doctor.&quot;  It was better that it was his choice.  <br/>
It took three visits, ultimately, but he&#39;s totally better now.  It was <br/>
frustrating for me, but the mutual respect between us is better,  and the <br/>
knowledge he gained from making his own decision will come in useful when <br/>
it&#39;s something more acute.<br/>

watching it when I was pregnant with Cameron that my children would NEVER <br/>
watch it!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t STAND Elmo. The Grouch gave me the creeps. I think Jim Henson was a <br/>
genius, but the program was a real freak show. Neither child was interested, <br/>
to my delight. It gives me the heebie-jeebies to even think about!  <br/>

your kids LOVED it.. were obsessive over it..wanted to watch it all the time, <br/>
had videos and games of it, wanted clothes with characters on it.. LOL.. you <br/>
know what I mean? Like lots of kids obsessions over characters or shows.. <br/>
I&#39;ve been lucky in those regards too.. my kids have never really liked <br/>
anything that I didnt like.. BUT, Im very flexible, I really cant think of <br/>
much I can&#39;t tolerate.  Pokemon kinda gets on my nerves.. but not to a <br/>
&quot;UGHGHGH gag me&quot; point.  I just dont watch it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208913480">&lt;&lt; I think it&#39;s really hard to know when to allow your kids to not do <br/>
something that you think they need. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know. I allow my dd to do pretty much what she wants, and respect her choices, but that doesn&#39;t mean I am not her mother anymore. I make her do things that I consider important as a mother, like brush her teeth, etc. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m necessarily forcing her, just instilling good habits in her.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; From a homeopthic point of view, I&#39;m facing that now.  My son (5 <br/>
years old) has been going to a homeopath for awhile and was cured of <br/>
food allergies.  But he still has this thing where he hates to leave <br/>
the house, and he&#39;s being treated for that.  So he hates to leave the <br/>
house, is mad because he&#39;s there, and refuses to take a remedy that <br/>
will make it easier for him to leave his house.  Would you hold him <br/>
down and force him to take it? &gt;&gt; Did your homeopath tell you that the remedy s/he&#39;s giving him is to *treat* that particular aspect, or is that your interpretation? I am asking you this because true homeopathy treats the whole person and not just certain aspects. So, I&#39;d suggest you  ask him/her if s/he is treating your son constitutionally, and if s/he isn&#39;t, look for a different homeopath!<br/>
<br/>
Also, if the treatment is constitutional, perhaps you shouldn&#39;t tell your son that he&#39;s been treated for that specific aversion, or that the remedy is for that, because it is part of his imbalance and of course he&#39;s not gonna want to take it. And it is not totally true either. A true homeopath sees more than just what&#39;s bothering the patient (or her mom...lol) and focuses on the whole person.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If your child had a serious cavity and didn&#39;t want to go get it <br/>
filled, do you make him?  How many parents would really be at peace <br/>
with watching their child&#39;s teeth fall out if that&#39;s what the parents <br/>
choose?  Yet there are some adults who choose to not treat cavities <br/>
and not go to the dentist.  When do we let go? &gt;&gt; I&#39;ve made my girl brush her teeth ever since she was very little and now it&#39;s simply a habit. Same thing with her hair and personal hygiene. We all do those tings here, so it&#39;s not like something extraordinary, just for her. She knows why and she is willing to do it. I don&#39;t have to *force* her. I understand that unschooling is about trusting and letting kids lead their learning process, but they still need parenting, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; At some point I think all parents would step in and say, &quot;I am going <br/>
to take care of your needs whether you like it or not&quot;. &gt;&gt; Totally. I understand there are ways of doing it and ways of doing it, of course. So I try to make those things fun. I truly believe that my daughter needs me as her mother and not just *a buddy* or something like that... ;-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; The problem comes in when parents think their child &quot;needs&quot; a <br/>
classical education.  Or they &quot;need&quot; socialization.  Or they &quot;need&quot; <br/>
to be punished for irresponsibility.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree. My question was more geared toward certain values that may be opposed by say, TV shows and such. For example, I&#39;ve heard parents say thay don&#39;t worry about their kids be exposed to porno on the net, and so on. Or to be exposed to anything, for that matter. I tend to think differently, not because I am a prude or anything like that, but because I believe there is a time for everything and as we grow up we develop a greater capacity to understand and assimilate the world. Any thoughts?<br/>

her body. <br/>
<br/>
 There might be times when a child is more in tune with her instincts <br/>
than a parent, yet is forced to do what the parent thinks is needed. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the answer is, except for encouraging parents to be <br/>
healthy and in tune with their own instincts. And of course the same <br/>
concept applies to what tv shows we let our kids watch.  The child <br/>
might be more in tune with his own instincts than the parent is.  The <br/>
child might be right and the parent might be wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Did your homeopath tell you that the remedy s/he&#39;s giving him is to <br/>
*treat* that particular aspect, or is that your interpretation? I am <br/>
asking you this because true homeopathy treats the whole person and <br/>
not just certain aspects. So, I&#39;d suggest you  ask him/her if s/he is <br/>
treating your son constitutionally, and if s/he isn&#39;t, look for a <br/>
different homeopath!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She is treating him constitutionally, and is treating the whole <br/>
person.  I just didn&#39;t explain myself well.  He has done really well <br/>
with homeopathy and he knows it.  His diet used to be extremely <br/>
limited and now he can eat anything.  In his mind, he&#39;s glad he was <br/>
treated but now he thinks he&#39;s better and doesn&#39;t see the point in <br/>
going. But he still has some little things, and the biggest one seems <br/>
to be being uncomfortable away from home. I&#39;m not sure what his <br/>
remedy is at this point.  At one point he was cal carb, but I think <br/>
she changed it at some point. Maybe lycopodium?  Or maybe that was my <br/>
other son--I&#39;m not sure.  There are 6 of us being treated so I don&#39;t <br/>
always remember who&#39;s getting what. :) <br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m sure. Right now I hold him, she dumps them into his mouth and <br/>
holds it shut until she thinks it&#39;s been in long enough, then we let <br/>
him go and he spits them out. <br/>

<br/>
I know that my daughter will get upset seeing certain types of tv <br/>
shows.  She is free to pick what tv shows she wants to watch and just <br/>
never picks anything scary.  If dh and I are planning on watching <br/>
something that we think might scare her, we just tell her that and <br/>
she willingly chooses to stay out of the room. <br/>
<br/>
As far as porn, she&#39;s never watched it.  I recognize that the <br/>
possibility exists that at some point she might see it and be <br/>
curious. I would talk to her about it.   <br/>
<br/>
But how does one know when it is ok to lift the reigns and say when <br/>
something is ok to see?  In my ideal world, my daughter wouldn&#39;t see <br/>
a naked male body until her wedding night. <br/>
       <br/>
Even if porn doesn&#39;t become an obsession, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to <br/>
watch porn even occasionally.  Beyond that possible first time seeing <br/>
it, asking what it is, and then discussing why it isn&#39;t healthy, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want my kids watching it at all.  I just don&#39;t believe it&#39;s <br/>
a good moral thing for anyone to watch.  <br/>

&gt;&gt; My question was geared toward how to handle stuff that you may consider going<br/>

&gt;&gt; on Big Bird simply triggered my question.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt; I think a lot of that was covered in the Grand Theft Auto thread! I don&#39;t<br/>
think most parents responding were delighted to have that particular game in<br/>
their homes! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It really depends on what it is. Vegetarians have mentioned letting their<br/>
kids choose whatever they want to eat outside the home. Peacelovers have<br/>
said their kids have toy weapons.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect religion is a bit tricky for some people. I can imagine it being<br/>
incredibly tough to explore outside a faith if you&#39;re certain other paths<br/>
are not only false but misleading.<br/>
<br/>
What did you have in mind specifically? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m thinking out loud here... mainstream American culture... racism... the demeaning portrayal of women... porno... spanking kids... abuse of animals... political agendas... and all those things that seam to be accepted by this and other cultures that not only do not convey our family&#39;s ideals and values, but seem to go against them... <br/>
<br/>
What about that new TV show that portrays a homeschooling family as a bunch of misfits who can&#39;t relate to the world outside their home?<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, *sheltering* or *denial* are not in my mind, but protecting and guiding are, especially because my dd is still very young.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone is advocating exposing kids to those things, but if<br/>
they chance on it or become curious, then the answer is to help them deal<br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
There are some things on that list that she&#39;ll probably encounter in the<br/>
course of American culture or entertainment and then you can talk about how<br/>
they make you feel or talk about the time period (if it&#39;s historical).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Warts will go away on their own.  The body will build up antibodies and get <br/>
rid of a wart.  Although it is a long process.  May take a year or longer.  <br/>
And the bottom of the foot is a painful place for a wart.  And in mild cases <br/>
the body will repair a cavity.  If it is just a small decay.  And it is kept <br/>
clean etc, the decayed enamel may repair although there will be a brown spot, <br/>
like a scar.  Happened with my youngest and that is how our dentist described <br/>
it to me.<br/>
<br/>
I give my son the same choice with cold sores.  He gets one once in a while.  <br/>
He can choose to use the cream that will help it stay small and go away in a <br/>
matter of a couple of days with little pain or he can choose no cream and it <br/>
takes longer to heal and may be a bit larger and a bit more painful.  He says <br/>
the cream tastes bad and usually refuses.  I know the sore will go away it is <br/>
just a matter of when.<br/>

<br/>
I agree. A lot of the time it&#39;s plain ingnorance about alternatives. Even unschoolers can be very mainstream when it comes to health care...  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I let my dd choose what she wants to eat, and have done it ever since she was born. She was breastfed on demand and then when she started eating solid food, she would go for only rice or broccoli or whatever. I&#39;ve never pressured her about any of that, because I totally trust her inner inteligence.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; There might be times when a child is more in tune with her instincts <br/>
than a parent, yet is forced to do what the parent thinks is needed. <br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the answer is, except for encouraging parents to be <br/>
healthy and in tune with their own instincts. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you here. I think that they are totally in tune with their instincts when it comes to instinctual stuff, but when it comes to mind stuff it gets a bit more tricky...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; And of course the same <br/>
concept applies to what tv shows we let our kids watch.  The child <br/>
might be more in tune with his own instincts than the parent is.  The <br/>
child might be right and the parent might be wrong. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is where I am not so sure. I think kids are extremely impressionable and tend to believe that what&#39;s out there is *normal*. Yet I don&#39;t think that most of what&#39;s out there is natural or normal at all! I don&#39;t think playing with guns is going to make a kid violent, but I do believe that watching someone spanking or hitting a kid may leave a disturbing impression on them, for example.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We don&#39;t tell him that he&#39;s being treated for that.  And I know she&#39;s <br/>
taking into account other things--like that he&#39;s sensitive to smells <br/>
and doesn&#39;t like to wear jeans and more that she hasn&#39;t even told me <br/>
I&#39;m sure. Right now I hold him, she dumps them into his mouth and <br/>
holds it shut until she thinks it&#39;s been in long enough, then we let <br/>
him go and he spits them out. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever asked him why he spits it out? There&#39;s cases when people fear they&#39;re being poisoned (and that&#39;s a rubric for the homeopath), but he may have other reasons. I won&#39;t say anymore. I was personally (privately)  asked not to talk about homeopathy on these lists.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think that there is really a difference between trusting them <br/>
to know what&#39;s good for them physically and what&#39;s good for them <br/>
morally/emotionally. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where I have my doubts. Not because I don&#39;t *trust* but because I know how impressonable we humans are. Perhaps it&#39;s just a question of good timing, and as they grow up they get more and more exposure to things (just like more choices, responsibilities, etc.). <br/>
       <br/>
&lt;&lt; Even if porn doesn&#39;t become an obsession, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s good to <br/>
watch porn even occasionally.  Beyond that possible first time seeing <br/>

a good moral thing for anyone to watch.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a big one for me too. I think it&#39;s very polluting for one&#39;s mind.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because Yol said her daughter is very young. The kids we were talking about<br/>
were much older and asking for Grand Theft Auto. A young child wouldn&#39;t ask<br/>
to see porn or political agendas or the other stuff Yol listed.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s eyes glaze over when there&#39;s even kissing and she&#39;s 11. To a<br/>
young child movies with sexual content would look like a bunch of adults<br/>
doing pointlessly boring stuff. My daughter has had free use of the TV<br/>
remote since forever. Occasionally she&#39;ll stay up all night watching TV<br/>
where I would suppose there are adult themed shows and movies on regular<br/>
cable. But she doesn&#39;t even pause at anything that doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s<br/>
for kids because adult shows don&#39;t have the look that appeals to kids.<br/>
<br/>
They *will* stumble over ideas like racism before it would seem useful to<br/>
introduce it to them, but they&#39;re not going to ask to see it before they&#39;re<br/>
ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1639026602">Of course I would never make my son go to a homeopath just because he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like jeans.  I took him because he cried because he couldn&#39;t <br/>
have ice cream like the other kids.  I took him because my heart <br/>
almost stopped when he accidentally ate a dairy ingredient and his <br/>
throat swelled shut so bad he could hardly breathe.  Now he eats what <br/>
he wants.  But there are lots of remedies that can be used to help <br/>
someone with a food allergy.  Knowing that someone doesn&#39;t like jeans <br/>
and is sensitive to smells can help a homeopath determine which <br/>
remedy she needs to give that particular individual.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my homeopath is trying to cure him of wearing <br/>
sweatpants too much. &lt;grin&gt;  But if there is something <br/>
physiologically off balance that is making it so that he is bothered <br/>
by anything tight around his waist, and if that physiological thing <br/>
can be brought back into balance, then I would like to see him <br/>
balanced.  <br/>
<br/>
Your personal preferences are part of who you are and a homeopath had <br/>
to take them into account when determining a remedy. <br/>

I asked a similar question about watching/playing GTA, and it didn&#39;t<br/>

<br/>
I think the question was &quot;Do you actually have a child who is wanting to <br/>
watch <br/>
&lt;&lt;racism... the demeaning portrayal of women... porno... spanking<br/>
kids... abuse of animals... political agendas...&gt;&gt;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When/if you asked why people would want to play GTA, the answers were given.  <br/>
And there ARE people who want to play it.  And their characterization of the <br/>
game wasn&#39;t the same as yours.  So those who HAVE played it (I&#39;m assuming you <br/>
have not) had a different view of it than those who had learned of it from <br/>
critical essays somewhere out there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864034924">Any of you who know more about homeopathy want to hazard a suggestion for a<br/>
remedy that would help my granddaughter handle disappointment a little<br/>
better.  She reacts very strongly to any disappointment.  Like she just got<br/>
sick and will have to miss at least a couple of the classes she loves.  Most<br/>
kids would be disappointed, might even cry, but Skye will be inconsolable.<br/>
<br/>
While we&#39;re at it, my daughter remembers hearing about a remedy that helps<br/>
with small kids tending to be violent.  Kaelin has been hitting, scratching,<br/>
etc for the last little while, often with no provocation at all.  It&#39;s<br/>
likely just a stage, but if there&#39;s a remedy that will help his mother<br/>
through it . . .<br/>
