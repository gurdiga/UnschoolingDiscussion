<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940624634">Well the dreaded snaggle tooth that Sierra was harboring finally fell out. All on it&#39;s own. She discovered it this morning and found it on the floor by her bed. Sierra made a point to tell me she wants all her teeth to just fall out like that!! So I learned that indeed they will even if no one pulls them!<br/>
<br/>
At least Tara and I don&#39;t have to look at that thing hanging there anymore. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
