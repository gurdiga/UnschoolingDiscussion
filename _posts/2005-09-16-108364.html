<div id="ygrps-yiv-235192911">My son just turned 7 and we are having a family party for him on Sunday.  A few weeks ago we mailed out invitations to family and a few of his kid friends.<br/>
<br/>
SIL calls and leaves a message on the machine.  It both saddened me and angered me at the same time.  I&#39;ve posted about this SIL in the past -- she was a die-hard school at homer (who claimed to be &#39;relaxed&#39; but was anything but) who feels obedience is the word of the day -- parents dictate and kids obey.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she has 2 kids, ages 14 & 15.  My son wanted to invite their whole family, and the invitation was addressed as such.  They recently moved here from out of state.<br/>
<br/>
Her message stated:  Sorry we won&#39;t be able to attend the party.  H & C both have extracurricular activities on Sat.  I know the party is Sunday, but I don&#39;t think they are really interested in attending a 7-yr-old&#39;s party and that they would be bored.  I think maybe the younger cousins would have a better time there.  Thanks for asking.<br/>
<br/>
What the....???  Since when does AGE matter with family??  I was so stunned I didn&#39;t even reply.<br/>
<br/>
That said, my son&#39;s best friend is 12, and he&#39;s 7.  What does age have to do with anything??<br/>
<br/>
Call me flabberghasted....<br/>

<br/>
If so, or even if not, my guess is she has told her kids things to control <br/>
them and some of those things would be compromised by fraternizing with your <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she never let her kids invite big groups to their birthday parties.<br/>

Yes, her kids are in a private high school now (Christian).  Yes, she is very controlling.  My guess is that she didn&#39;t even extend the invitation to them, just answered for them.<br/>
<br/>
I just found it sad that some people are so entrenched in &#39;same age&#39; stuff that they would discount family functions based on it.<br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t understand her reasoning, either.<br/>
