You&#39;ve gotten lots of good advice.  I saw your post that you&#39;d decided to<br/>
not take the kids, and that sounds like a good decision for you.  Perhaps<br/>
you can help out your friend with backup care.  Childcare is reasonably<br/>
readily available, but knowing that you&#39;ll back up his regular arrangement<br/>
might give him some peace of mind.  It will save him taking days off work<br/>
when the children are not sick but were within the last 24 hours so they<br/>
can&#39;t go to daycare, or when the daycare provider is sick.  I do that for a<br/>
couple friends, and like feeling that I can help, but I don&#39;t burn out.<br/>
