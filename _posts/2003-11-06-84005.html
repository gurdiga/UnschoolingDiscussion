<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475838624"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Next time around -- No driver&#39;s ed course required in SC -- <br/>
 </span></blockquote>autodidacts simply pass the written test, which includes some of the <br/>
drug & alcohol awareness info, and receive a learner&#39;s permit -- <br/>
then, proceed to learn to drive on the road under an adult, licensed <br/>
driver&#39;s supervision (you know, like the old days when your parents <br/>
sat by your side and took part in the process as a matter of course -<br/>
- white knuckles notwithstanding.) Common sense and a lot of love <br/>
kept them in the passenger&#39;s seat till they were confident in our <br/>
ability to steer clear of trouble. Those were the days, my friend...&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those days are over. New law: every child in SC WILL take a $250 class----ten <br/>
hours in a classroom and six on the road.<br/>
<br/>
Stupid and expensive. I have a new &quot;graduate&quot;. It was useless and pointless <br/>
for us. But the driving instructors are making a KILLING!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yuck! Here I think the kids get something for taking the class, either a <br/>
reduction on insurance or less time in one of the graduated driving <br/>
categories. They just tightened those up though. Lars got caught in the new <br/>
regs by 8 days. Bummer. Now he has to have his learners for a year and <br/>
novice for two, instead of .5 and 1.5. And during novice he can only have <br/>
one passenger under 25.<br/>
<br/>
He got his learners this week and has been driving up a storm with me. All <br/>
those years of letting him steer while I kept my hand ready to guide the <br/>
wheel if necessary have paid off. It&#39;s one less variable that&#39;s completely <br/>
new to him, and he&#39;s doing fine. He wasn&#39;t too happy last night when he had <br/>
convinced me to let him drive his girlfriend home ( with me of course) and <br/>
I had to change my mind when I realized it was cold enough that the roads <br/>
might have been icy. Driving in the dark *and* possible ice was too much <br/>
for me. He got over it though.<br/>

Driving rules for teens just keep getting worse and worse.  When my youngest <br/>
is old enough, I think he and I will look for the least restrictive state and <br/>
mooch off the unschoolers I probably know there until he gets his license.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me started on the recent change in TN law that requires car seats <br/>
for the under-9 set!  @@<br/>
