<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657007169">I may be the only one who feels this way (and please speak up if that&#39;s the <br/>
case), but I am finding this whole conversation about rank really divisve and <br/>
damagaing to the list. No one seems to really be hearing anyone, and it just <br/>
seems so silly.<br/>
<br/>
Can we possibly stop? I know I can just delete it, but it seeps into other <br/>
threads, and it has gotten to a point where ...well....it seems to have no <br/>
point.<br/>
