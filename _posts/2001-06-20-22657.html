<div id="ygrps-yiv-880249678">I am wondering if any of you have digital cameras and would like to give<br/>
me a critic on yours?<br/>
I have to have a serial port connection and would like at least a 1.5<br/>
megapixel but past that I&#39;m not sure.  There are SO many out there!!<br/>
Thanks for any guidance.<br/>
Ann</div>
