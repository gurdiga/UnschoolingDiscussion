<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522910691">This is an interesting article on Pokemon. I know everyone has their own <br/>
POV so I&#39;m not trying to start a discussion on this. We have had to ban <br/>
Pokemon from our home as it was causing real problems. They are allowed to <br/>
keep what they have but no more buying. This is to save our sanity. I was <br/>
glad to see we aren&#39;t the only ones who felt this way.<br/>
