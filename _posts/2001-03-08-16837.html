<div id="ygrps-yiv-577547026">Hi Kerry - I&#39;ve been staring at your message for a few minutes trying to<br/>
think of exactly what to say.  How do you teach homosexuality?  Are you<br/>
saying that they are teaching how to be homosexual?  Or acceptance of people<br/>
who are homosexual?  Or to accept themselves if they are homosexual?  I<br/>
don&#39;t feel any desire to defend the public schools.  Obviously I don&#39;t think<br/>
they should be teaching my kids anything.  But I do feel the need to defend<br/>
the gay people in my life by saying that, yes, they are ok.<br/>
<br/>
We have spoken before, so I hope you know that I am truly curious to<br/>
understand what you are saying, and not just attacking what you said.<br/>
<br/>
-Rue<br/>

Subject: RE: [Unschooling-dotcom] &quot;teaching&quot; homosexuality&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi Rue! First, let me say that I have no issues with<br/>
homosexuality at all. NONE. Honest! The MA schools<br/>
have a program that is geared to &quot;acceptance&quot;, but<br/>
having seen some of the worksheets and such, I can<br/>
tell you it is geared to confuse small children. ALL<br/>
kids have attractions to the same sex at some point,<br/>
and the program seems to capitalize on these feelings<br/>
and encourage a child to think that those fleeting<br/>
thoughts are signs that they are gay. My<br/>
kindergartener came home and told me he thought he was<br/>
gay because he thinks boys are cute sometimes. Well,<br/>
heck! I was ripped! I hadn&#39;t even beeen aware of the<br/>
program they were using. To tell a kindergartener that<br/>
becasue he may &quot;like&quot; other boys he might be gay and<br/>
thats ok, was NOT OK WITH ME! It was a very confusing<br/>
thing for him and I suspect it brought on more<br/>
problems that other parents were not even made aware<br/>
of until they&#39;re child anounced his sexual preference<br/>
at the young age of 5~!<br/>
Hope this explains my statement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253422948">There are many many issues with the public schools<br/>

perpetuate this decline. I want my kids to learn<br/>
things (social issues, homosexuality, abortion, etc.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1067283458">*I think that&#39;s perhaps a path that is better not<br/>
taken on this list.  It is<br/>
okay to be gay, whether that needs to be brought up in<br/>
pre-k is another<br/>
matter.<br/>

<br/>
For you to think your opinion is welcome and not<br/>
anyone elses is foolish. You say we shouldnt go down a<br/>
path, but then clearly voice your own opinion. We<br/>
werent even actually discussing whether or not<br/>
homosexuality is ok, just that its not a school<br/>
subject.<br/>

What are you doing about preschool for your daughter?  I&#39;ve been planning to <br/>
send the boys to preschool even though I don&#39;t intend to send them to school. <br/>
 The learning to follow group directions a bit, other&#39;s routines, etc. seems <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962518493">We did have Mac in preschool, but to be honest, with all of the activities <br/>
that they are involved in (she takes 2 dance classes and gymnastics, he <br/>
takes fencing, 2 dance and gymnastics) I can&#39;t afford preschool!  She gets <br/>
some classroom time at Sunday school though and seems to be content doing <br/>
sit-down type work anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The group that meets on Monday also has an email group call <br/>
CentralNJHomeschoolers or something to that effect.  I&#39;m also on that list <br/>
so it&#39;s something you might want to look into.  They are also on yahoogroups <br/>
so if you searched for NJ and homeschooling, I&#39;m sure you could find it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we&#39;ll meet sometime soon.<br/>
