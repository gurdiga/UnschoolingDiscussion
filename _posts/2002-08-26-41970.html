<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808298674">There&#39;s a lot of talk about what to talk about lately.<br/>
<br/>
When was the last time anyone posted something here that was actually about<br/>
UNschooling? I can&#39;t remember it. Our list owners and managers and wanna-be<br/>
managers keep asking us to talk about unschooling, and stop talking about<br/>
other things, and those &quot;other things&quot; seem to depend on the whims of those<br/>
managers. My two or three months here should be enough for me to get an idea<br/>
what is acceptable, but I still have no idea, because the managers keep<br/>
moving and removing the goalposts.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that UNschooling starts with &quot;un.&quot;  Unschooling is not<br/>
something that we DO; it&#39;s something that we DON&quot;T DO, and it inevitably<br/>
involves WHY we don&#39;t do it. School is the elephant in the middle of our<br/>
room, andaccording to the managers, we&#39;re not supposed to talk about it.<br/>
Hmmm<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t do school because we believe it is bad for our kids, and because we<br/>
believe we can give them a better experience than the schools can. But now,<br/>
to talk about WHY that is true is not acceptable because it just might<br/>
involve comparisons between what we do and what schools do to children, and<br/>
we are admonished from hurting anyone&#39;s feelings or pointing out how school<br/>
people, even though some are well-meaning, are damaging children every day<br/>
of their working lives while telling us that what they do is &quot;for the<br/>
children.&quot; It seems obvious to me that if they really wanted to do something<br/>
for the children, they would change the schools or quit working for them.<br/>
But they do not.<br/>
<br/>
So we have a problem here. Ours is a &quot;negative practice.&quot; It&#39;s NOT-<br/>
schooling. So how does one talk about NOT-schooling without mentioning<br/>
schooling? Lately, many posts, from the list managers in particular, have<br/>
complained that the conversation is NOT about unschooling, but even they<br/>
have not contributed examples of what they want us to talk about. The reason<br/>
is that there is really not much we can talk about because of that &quot;UN.&quot; If<br/>
all this list is about is talking about what we did today as parents, we<br/>
might as well change the name to Parenting.com  and leave it at that.<br/>
<br/>
I even got blasted because someone thought I called this a &quot;support group&quot;<br/>
even when I didn&#39;t. &quot;It&#39;s a discussion group,&quot; she said.  I have to ask,<br/>
What do support groups do? They discuss issues relevant to an activity. That<br/>
makes this a support group, doesn&#39;t it? Today, one poster even said that she<br/>
gets &quot;support&quot; from this list. Is there anyone who doesn&#39;t? So why the<br/>
hassle about calling it what it is - a support group?<br/>
<br/>
Is this really &quot;School-anon.&quot;? Is it for school rehab...a place for people<br/>
who are trying to kick school to come for ideas about NOT-schooling. Is this<br/>
a list for newbies to come to have their hand held by experienced<br/>
school-anoners to help them get through another day? Or is it a focus group<br/>
of some kind, considering the pros and cons of various degrees of schooling?<br/>
<br/>
 Can that exist as a discussion group without some discussion about how to<br/>
keep and maintain the right to do it? We hear from unschoolers every day,<br/>
yes on this list, who are hassled by their local school district. Are we not<br/>
to talk about that? Are we not supposed to offer them suggestions about<br/>
dealing with corrupt and dishonest superintendents and principals? Those<br/>
situations are part of why we are all here...we are in the process of<br/>
escaping from them and hoping that we can create a world in which our<br/>
children will not be required to fight so hard for their own rights in<br/>
raising their kids in peace.<br/>
<br/>
When we remove the one thing -- school -- that was, for virtually all of us,<br/>
the central focus of our lives (outside of home) as we grew up, most of us<br/>
feel a huge void. If we can&#39;t talk about the school we left behind and why<br/>
we reject it, we can&#39;t talk about much. Unschooling doesn&#39;t give us much to<br/>
talk about other than trying to raise our kids one day at a time. The idea<br/>
is NOT to do to our kids what the school system did to us -- waste a lot of<br/>
our youths.<br/>
<br/>
We have trouble imagining our lives without having gone to school all those<br/>
twenty thousand hours and being preoccupied with it for most of the rest of<br/>
our youths. And we can&#39;t talk about unschooling outside the context of our<br/>
own school experiences. It will take another generation to be free of the<br/>
monkey on our backs. Our kids will take the baton from us and talk<br/>
coherently about unschooling because they will not be schooled half to<br/>
death, as we have been. They will know the freedom. We cannot.<br/>
<br/>
We can only try to imagine it.<br/>
<br/>
Try an analogy: If this were a group devoted to UNreligion, could we talk<br/>
about being unreligious without the context of religion? I believe it is the<br/>
same with schooling. Can we imagine asking a minister for permission to<br/>
become unreligious? Could we talk about not having a god without discussing<br/>
what that is?<br/>
<br/>
Even though the homeschooling revival has been going strong for over twenty<br/>
years, most people engaged in it are &quot;new&quot; to it, and most of them, like I<br/>
did at first, feel as though they are pioneering, going against a flood,<br/>
surely breaking some law even if they can&#39;t find one.<br/>
<br/>
There are calls to &quot;move on&quot; but to what? Will they tell us? My own grief<br/>
for my kids damaged by school has made me devote myself to helping others<br/>
escape that same damage. Yes, my kids were hurt twenty years ago, but the<br/>
schools are just as terrible today, if not worse, so how are we supposed to<br/>
&quot;move on&quot;? Some people here seem terrified by the schools they have just<br/>
escaped. Are they supposed to simply &quot;move on&quot;? How do you mean that?<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Talk about UNschooling !&quot; comes the demand. There is little about<br/>
unschooling that can be talked about in the strict confines of the request.<br/>
Everyone in the practice of unschooling deals with the restrictions placed<br/>
on us by the school system, the state, the &quot;children and families&quot; agencies,<br/>
even pressures from neighbors and relatives. Those are the subjects that a<br/>
list like this rightly addresses, and until homeschooling stands on firmer<br/>
legal ground, and  unschooling is much better understood and accepted, the<br/>
members will be plagued by those forces, and yes, they damned well need this<br/>
to be their support group.<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s hear from the leaders...Talk about Unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563143416">Oh Ned, Be quiet.<br/>
Listen to this list for a while, let the current discussions move on and<br/>
*really listen* to the ones that spring up in their place. Hear the voice of<br/>
unschooling-dotcom.<br/>
Stop trying to tell us what we should be talking about and listen to what we<br/>
ARE talking about.<br/>
If you don&#39;t like it, then find another list. You&#39;re on so many already,<br/>
what is this one piddly little (in a manner of speaking) list to you? Why is<br/>
it so important that we all do it your way?<br/>

Joyfully.  Frequently!  Lovingly.  Positively.  Encouragingly.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t tell us no posts have been about unschooling unless you&#39;re admitting <br/>
you don&#39;t know what unschooling is.<br/>

<br/>
If all this list is about is talking about what we did today as unschooling <br/>
parents, then it is serving a REALLY useful purpose, and should be called <br/>
unschooling-dotcom as it has been since the day it was founded.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We hear from unschoolers every day,<br/>

<br/>
Not every day.<br/>
Not hassled.<br/>
<br/>
We have people asking how to deal with some state&#39;s requirements.  <br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t for discussing local school districts.  Local lists are for <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are we not supposed to offer them suggestions about<br/>
dealing with corrupt and dishonest superintendents and principals? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No.  We&#39;re not.  We&#39;re supposed to help them be with their children <br/>
peacefully and to find natural learning in their everyday lives.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t even write about schools without adding &quot;corrupt and dishonest&quot; (or <br/>
worse) and so you&#39;re not helping people learn to be with their children <br/>
peacefully and to find natural learning in their everyday lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When we remove the one thing -- school -- that was, for virtually all of <br/>
us,<br/>
the central focus of our lives (outside of home) as we grew up, most of us<br/>
feel a huge void. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ned, mothers with kids at home do NOT have a huge void in their lives.  <br/>
Mothers with children in school have a huge void.  When the kids are home <br/>
their lives are FILLED with life and love and busy activities and worries and <br/>
problems and solutions and songs and most of them don&#39;t have time to think <br/>
about school, and it wouldn&#39;t help them if they did.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If we can&#39;t talk about the school we left behind and why<br/>

<br/>
It seems you&#39;re saying &quot;we&quot; when you mean to say &quot;If I can&#39;t talk about the <br/>
school I left behind I can&#39;t talk about much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The rest of us were doing fine before you came ranting about schools.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Unschooling doesn&#39;t give us much to<br/>
talk about other than trying to raise our kids one day at a time. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all we need to do, those of us with children, is to find good ways to <br/>
find trust and contentment and peace with our children one moment at a time.  <br/>
Taking part of that energy from our children and aiming it toward the schools <br/>
we left does not help unschoolers in their daily lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The idea is NOT to do to our kids what the school system did to us -- w<br/>
aste a lot of our youths.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  We&#39;re not wasting their youths.  We shouldn&#39;t waste our energy going to <br/>
school board meetings and nursing outrage either.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And we can&#39;t talk about unschooling outside the context of our<br/>
own school experiences. It will take another generation to be free of the<br/>
monkey on our backs.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Or you can just say &quot;monkey, I rebuke thee,&quot; and go about your life without <br/>
talking about school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They will know the freedom. We cannot.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We can only try to imagine it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ned.  You&#39;re speaking for over 800 people here, and you&#39;re speaking falsely.<br/>
You can be free when you decide to be free.  You can stop obsessing about <br/>
school right after you stop obsessing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some people here seem terrified by the schools they have just<br/>
escaped. Are they supposed to simply &quot;move on&quot;? How do you mean that?-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been offering suggestions every day, but because it just seems like <br/>
parenting to you, you ignore it.  They move on by being with their children, <br/>
REALLY with their children, in the moment, now.  And since they are not NOW <br/>
in school, school is not part of their now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Everyone in the practice of unschooling deals with the restrictions placed<br/>
on us by the school system, the state, the &quot;children and families&quot; <br/>
agencies,-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is as wrong as flying dog shit.<br/>

It&#39;s very sad.  There is also a lot of coercion involved, something <br/>

our kids are parents and posting on them.  Well, unless the laws <br/>

blissfully pretending that the corrupt, dishonest schools don&#39;t <br/>
affect us?  That people aren&#39;t being reported to children and youth <br/>
because their kids are never in school?  (And yes, this does happen.  <br/>
This just happened to a friend of mine, this weekend.)<br/>
<br/>
I think peace means looking at all the bad and all the good, knowing <br/>
that we are ok with the choices we have made, but still being willing <br/>
to hope for more of the bad to be made good.  It means looking at the <br/>
very bad and being glad that we have the very good. For us, that <br/>
means  being very ok with our decision to unschool but being willing <br/>
to hope that school, the antithesis of unschool, will some day go <br/>
away.  It means looking at the very bad (school) and being glad that <br/>
we have the very good (unschool).  <br/>

&gt; children <br/>
&gt; &gt; peacefully and to find natural learning in their everyday lives.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suppose that depends on how you define &quot;peace&quot;.  Is peace just <br/>
&gt; blissfully pretending that the corrupt, dishonest schools don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; affect us?  That people aren&#39;t being reported to children and youth <br/>
&gt; because their kids are never in school?  (And yes, this does happen.  <br/>
&gt; This just happened to a friend of mine, this weekend.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think peace means looking at all the bad and all the good, knowing <br/>
&gt; that we are ok with the choices we have made, but still being willing <br/>
&gt; to hope for more of the bad to be made good.  It means looking at the <br/>
&gt; very bad and being glad that we have the very good. For us, that <br/>
&gt; means  being very ok with our decision to unschool but being willing <br/>
&gt; to hope that school, the antithesis of unschool, will some day go <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It does get discussed here. Very recently I think. Or maybe it was another<br/>
list or the message board. But regardless it would be perfectly okay to<br/>
discuss here.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has a personal problem that revolves around unschooling or<br/>
homeschooling it is often brought up here. People share similar problems<br/>
they&#39;ve had. They suggest ideas on how to deal with it. They suggest other<br/>
places to seek information.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is off topic.<br/>
<br/>
Everything can be discussed here.<br/>
<br/>
What is &quot;off topic&quot; is for someone to *repeatedly* behave in such a way that<br/>
the list can&#39;t meet its purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Ned dishes out emotionally charge misinformation that I personally don&#39;t<br/>
think should be left without someone questioning it. (Which is why I find it<br/>
difficult to ignore his posts.)<br/>
<br/>
Ned turns *every* topic to how bad schools are. That&#39;s harmful to those<br/>
trying to move on. It&#39;s harmful to those who now fear they can&#39;t discuss<br/>
what the schools did to their child and why they want to unschool. (That&#39;s<br/>
an especially sad consequence of Ned&#39;s antics.)<br/>

in real time. This is a discussion group and it works quite <br/>
differently. For example - you wrote what you wrote two days ago, but <br/>
I&#39;m just now finding time to read and reply to it.<br/>
<br/>
I recognize that many people don&#39;t belong to real life support groups <br/>
for one reason or another - I&#39;m one of those people - and in some <br/>
ways, this list (and others) serves as a form of support. But that <br/>
does not make this list a support group.<br/>
