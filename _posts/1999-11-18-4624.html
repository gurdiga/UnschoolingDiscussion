<div id="ygrps-yiv-655753663">I am not asking for a passionate discussion of the pros and cons of <br/>
vaccinations--we all have our own points of view. I do, however, have a <br/>
question. My 11 yo equestrian dd spends a lot of time in the barn. I am <br/>
concerned about tetanus. Does anyone know of alternatives to the tetanus <br/>
vaccine? Is there a tetanus-only vaccine availabe?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As always, taking into consideration the risk of exposure is an important<br/>
part of any immunization decision.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does anyone know of alternatives to the tetanus<br/>
&gt; vaccine?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a tetanus toxoid shot that can be given after exposure- but you&#39;d<br/>
have to know that she had been exposed.  If you&#39;re sure that she will stay<br/>
aware of any possible risk of exposure (any cuts, etc), then this might be<br/>
the way to go.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there a tetanus-only vaccine availabe?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, there is.  Your doctor may have to special order it, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336772579">As a horsey kinda person (owned, showed and raised them for 40+ years), I<br/>
would advise tetanus.  And, yes there is a tetanus only shot.  You can&#39;t<br/>
keep kids from stepping on nails sooner or later around horses or getting a<br/>
puncture wound from barbed wire or a horse shoe nail.<br/>
