<div id="ygrps-yiv-947794638">So, we&#39;re kinda settled in.  I&#39;m just reading messages on the website <br/>
- I don&#39;t have time to get everything yet.<br/>
<br/>
NEwayz, my son and I are going to try to make soap.  But, I do not <br/>
have access to any books on soap making (I can&#39;t read Japanese very <br/>
well - and they don&#39;t have any soap making books in English at the <br/>
library), and we can&#39;t order anything on the web without paying $50+- <br/>
for shipping - which takes about a month anywayz.  SO, I know the <br/>
basics - like add lye to heated vegetable oil (I think I&#39;ll use <br/>
grapeseed) and when it starts to thicken, add fragrance (I&#39;m going to <br/>
use a few essential oils), but I don&#39;t know how much to add, and hear <br/>
that could be dangerous.  So, if anyone knows the details - have <br/>
experience with adding essential oils, etc. please e-mail me.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029723080">Hi Melanie,<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of lists with onelist for all sorts of things and soap-<br/>
making<br/>
 is one of them, they have recipies, discuss different ingredients <br/>
and their <br/>
uses etc, I&#39;m on one called &quot;brandeys&quot; and have found it to be very <br/>
informative. <br/>
