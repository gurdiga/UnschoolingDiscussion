<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551005121">Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just had to share that my 9ds learned about depreciation on Grand Turismo 3 last night.    Let&#39;s see I don&#39;t think I had heard of depreciation until I was in, uh, maybe,  college, studying Accounting and Economics!   Not too bad for a 9 year old who isn&#39;t in school.  Love it! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And what&#39;s even better is that it was my husband that came to me with this news.   Usually its me pointing out how much he learns on these things,  aha, I&#39;ve got him now!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>
<br/>
