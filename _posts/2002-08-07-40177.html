&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here&#39;s the thing.....Home Depot sells the piece that they leave anywhere from <br/>
&gt;$.91-$2.91.<br/>
&gt;There 2 sides I guess....... you can get some good deals, but Home Depot is <br/>
&gt;double profiting....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nah, why would anyone intentionally leave a piece that they paid for. <br/>
 Lots of that wood is sold by the linear foot, so the person who bought <br/>
it and had it cut didn&#39;t pay for the leftovers.  If you buy one that&#39;s <br/>
&quot;by the piece&quot; you should take the whole thing home.<br/>
