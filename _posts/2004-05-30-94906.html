If you want to invite people to another discussion list about something <br/>
(yahoogroups are EASY to set up, maybe you should make one!) that&#39;s fine, but to <br/>
commandeer this list for a post that&#39;s nearly 4000 words long is not cool.  <br/>
Besides being at the main yahoogroups page, <br/>
List policies are here: <br/>

Very sorry about having sent a blank, and I HOPE it was launched empty and <br/>
not with that whole long post attached.<br/>

I apologize for continuing the discussion in a non-unschooling frame. <br/>
To be more on-subject, I will mention though that biodiesel is a way-<br/>
fun unschooling family project. Nothing like real chemistry that you <br/>
can run in a real car! Also, the by-product from biodiesel production <br/>
is glycerin, which is what my kids are planning on using in their <br/>
soap-making business I was talking about in another post. They also <br/>
had a blast building our bio-shed.<br/>
<br/>
So, if anyone is interested in creating biodiesel, either to save the <br/>
whales &lt;grin&gt; or because it&#39;s a fun, cool, real-life unschooling <br/>
science project, you can email me for details.<br/>
