Have you tried telling the older one that you wish you could give him<br/>
those years back and that you are sorry that school stole them from him?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s often hard for siblings to see the other get good stuff that they<br/>
didn&#39;t get to have.<br/>

Do we have any Psych majors on the list?  I know that I learned (in a<br/>
management class) that there is a name for the feeling that if something<br/>
was difficult it MUST have been worth it.  This concept may be the<br/>
reason that fraternities have hazing, because it makes their members<br/>
value their group identity more.  It keeps bugging me that I can&#39;t<br/>
remember what this concept is called!<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else heard of this?  (Except from seeing me post about it without<br/>
knowing the name last year.)<br/>

I don&#39;t know the name, but one way they prove a related principle is getting <br/>
people to review movies.  Those who pay full price review one way (that <br/>
wasn&#39;t the test factor so it didn&#39;t count &lt;g&gt;).  Those who get in absolutely <br/>
free give the worst reviews.  Those who are asked to review but are required <br/>
to pay part of the admission price give better reviews than those who get in <br/>
free.<br/>
<br/>
Another related applied-psychology situation was instant cake mixes and <br/>
instant pancakes and such.    When they first came out (in the 50&#39;s, I think) <br/>
people didn&#39;t want to use them.  They felt lazy and it didn&#39;t seem right.   <br/>
When  a mix requires you to add more than just water, though, all the virtue <br/>
floods back into the activity.  So they have you add eggs and oil and water.  <br/>
All better!  Now you&#39;re cooking!<br/>

I must be perverse!  (But you guys already had a clue about that.)  I&#39;m<br/>
usually MOST enthusiastic and likely to rave about things that I got<br/>
really cheap, because there is greater &quot;bang for the buck&quot;.  Some of the<br/>
things that I come on list and recommend might not really be worth $20,<br/>
but are very satisfying when found at the library sale for a single dollar.<br/>
<br/>
I usually find movies that are raved about disappointing and movies that<br/>
got panned, that interest me, better than I expected.  Again, perverse.<br/>

I remember reading that.  When my son was an infant I made the Krusteaz<br/>
muffin mixes, because they are add water only.  I was always holding him<br/>
and  didn&#39;t have the dexterity to crack eggs with just one hand.<br/>
