<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073884558">Hi Melissa! <br/>
  Just to let you know, I too was a curriculum user. However, after<br/>
seeking treatment (via many hours of research) I discovered how to relax<br/>
with my kids and trust their curiousity.<br/>
We find a lot of good material at the library  (even though it&#39;s a<br/>
lil&#39;behind the rest of the world). Ds loves fantasy games, science, and <br/>
even math (for the moment). Dd hates math, but loves animal based<br/>
science, experiments, cooking, and is stuck on Explorers. Well, enough<br/>
rambling, Welcome!! Aleasa in MS</div>
