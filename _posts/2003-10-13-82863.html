<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142500262">&lt;&lt; I ran across a little instrument at the music store today called a<br/>
Music<br/>
Maker. It looks a little like a little harp that you hold in your lap and<br/>
pluck. It comes with sheets of music that slide under the strings and<br/>
show you<br/>
where to pluck. I also found them online as &quot;lap harps.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have one of these and love it!  The sound is so magical, and it is<br/>
built so well that I think it can&#39;t be broken. (at least not without<br/>
real effort) <br/>
<br/>
The sheet music is coded so anyone can play the tunes wether you read<br/>
music or not...instant gratification!<br/>
<br/>
I play it more than the kids do at this point. A few months ago, I got<br/>
a bit fancy and tried putting a left-hand accompanyment to Minuet in<br/>
G...it has a good enough range (2 octaves) that one can play it with<br/>
two hands like a piano for some pieces. Again...the harp sounds so<br/>
awesome!<br/>
<br/>
My kids have discovered how hitting the strings with a spoon or mallet<br/>
that they can also play it like a xylophone.</div>

Ooooh yeah!  That is just what it sounds like!  THanks for the more<br/>
accurate comparison.<br/>
<br/>
Such a versitile instrument , this is!<br/>
<br/>
One also might go around with it pretending it is a lyre (with lots of<br/>
extra strings)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492845938">Announcement –<br/>
<br/>
Kate Jennings, an eight-year veteran homeschooler, is <br/>
compiling writings about homeschooling that will show the world just <br/>
how talented our homeschoolers are!  She is accepting (very) short <br/>
stories, essays/paragraphs (creative or instructive), diary entries, <br/>
poems, letters to and from family or friends, etc.  She says, “I plan <br/>
for the book to be informative, humorous, and creative.   Photos and <br/>
drawings that tie in with the writing would be great -- really, really <br/>
great.” <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The forerunner to a hammered dulcimer is an ancient Persian instrument <br/>
(also in other mideast countries) called the &quot;santour.&quot;  I love it. If <br/>
you want to hear a bit of it - go to this website and click on one of <br/>
the songs in the list at the left. You need Windows Media Player - free <br/>
download if you don&#39;t already have it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215201082">I just called to get replacement strings and a case for our Music Maker, <br/>
which I bought used (it only has one broken string, but for a couple of years it <br/>
worked really well).<br/>
<br/>
In the course of looking for a good place to buy this stuff, I found <br/>
www.childrens-musical-instruments.com<br/>
<br/>
And if you go through their menu to Music Maker (through harps maybe?)<br/>
and then to harp supplies and Music Maker supplies, they have a LOT of <br/>
song-packs.  BEAUTIFUL selections.<br/>
<br/>
I would recommend not getting things you don&#39;t already know the tune for, <br/>
because there&#39;s an element of this that&#39;s playing by ear--you need to know the <br/>
rhythm and tempo in your head already, and then you can follow their notes way <br/>
more easily.<br/>

There&#39;s the direct link to the music pages.<br/>
<br/>
Our little harp has languished for three years.  I&#39;m a bad music-mom.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I need to find a place to sell me steel strings for a little harp someone <br/>
made me, or I need to find out if it can use nylon.  Next musical reclamation <br/>
project.<br/>

<br/>
From what I just saw, $30 is a good price!!<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;d regret paying that much.<br/>
<br/>
They go on up to $50 with a packet of music and an extra string.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t advertise looking for one.  Then people will jack the price up.  <br/>
I&#39;d just check e-bay sometimes.<br/>
