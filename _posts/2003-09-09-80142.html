<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280444806">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to give myself an attitude adjustment.  I need a web page or something that I can just click into each day and get a new kick up the arse.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling resentful.  First it was secretly resentful, then it went to &#39;just get on with it and smile&#39; resentful, now it&#39;s sneaking out of my mouth resentful.  *sigh*  I know that I&#39;m doing it.  I know that it&#39;s dragging me down (honestly don&#39;t think the kids take that much notice because I go through cycles like this).  I don&#39;t want to be the person that I&#39;m being.  I&#39;m tired on top of it too so that&#39;s not helping and is maybe the cause of it a bit too.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing that makes me feel the worst is that it&#39;s ALL MY DOING.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;yes, you can come in the house tiny feral kitten&quot; <br/>
I said &quot;yes let&#39;s get two goats that I&#39;ll have to bottle feed three times a day&quot;<br/>
I said (last Saturday) &quot;oh look at these poor pathetic defenceless fluffy puppies, yes we&#39;ll bring them home so they can poo and pee everywhere and need lots of attention and eat enormous amounts of food and grow into high energy border collie/labradors&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never wanted pets.  I always said I didn&#39;t want pets.  So what the hell is wrong with me that I went from no pets to 5 pets in just 9 months??!!  It was all my decisions too!  I didn&#39;t have kids nagging me for these animals.  They didn&#39;t even know about the goats and the puppies!!!  Oh bugger.<br/>
<br/>
I knew how much responsibility I&#39;d be taking on.  Yeah, I was hopeful that the kids would be soooooo happy to have the pets that they&#39;d joyfully help me with looking after them and they do help a bit.  <br/>
<br/>
I just need a big hoooooge kick up the bum.  So kick me people!  My head voices just aren&#39;t doing the job.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be excited and happy to go and feed the goats and the puppys.  I am for the morning feed but then my tiredness catches up and I&#39;m a grumpy bitch for the rest of the day.  Aaarrgh.<br/>
<br/>
I want to smile at the kids and go outside and play with the puppies and the kids together all at the same time but then I go into freak out mode and I&#39;m trying to watch everyone all at the same time and I give orders and I feel like I&#39;m making everyone miserable.  And I worry that I&#39;m not gonna get anything done inside that I need to do to have a reasonably sane household.<br/>
<br/>
I could rave on for hours.  I think I&#39;d better right all this down in a book somewhere so I can get it out of my head.  <br/>
<br/>
I know that unschooling is about life.  It is life.  It&#39;s my life.  I just want to be better at it and let go of the resentment (which is mostly resentment at myself I think).  I need tools for that.  I need to move toward the joy.  It has to come from within.  I know that.  I need help with it.  Help me.  I&#39;m ready.  Okay, time for me to go and breathe - I can feel the hysterical laughter starting up and I need to nip it in the bud or I&#39;ll really freak everyone out LOL<br/>

Sounds like you aren&#39;t getting enough sleep. I suppose there isn&#39;t some<br/>
local teenager who could be paid a small fee to take on the afternoon<br/>
feed of the goats and puppies, while you catch an afternoon nap or a<br/>
cuppa. My stepfather&#39;s brother keeps two adult goats which are great at<br/>
keeping down the weeds and very easy to look after (ie ignore a lot of<br/>
the time) apparently, so I guess time will help with them. At least<br/>
border collie/Labradors are a sweet and intelligent mix - I bet they<br/>
would be able to be placed somewhere where they need working dogs - what<br/>
about the Guide Dogs for the Blind? <br/>

My husband has pets - Sea Monkeys - the easiest pet in the world that is<br/>
actually living.<br/>

It sounds like you really need a huge vent! Then maybe a vacation! :o) <br/>
I would suggest placing the dogs, and if you really (REALLY) want to keep <br/>
one, keep just one and remember these days. Goats? Do you want them? Is there a <br/>
nice farm they can go to? The kids are yours, you are going to have to keep <br/>
them though! ;o) Good luck! And tomorrow when someone asks if you want to raise <br/>
the orphaned bunny they found, take a deep breath, count to ten and say NO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303813892">Sheesh, definately not a good day. What exactly are you resentful about? Is<br/>
it that you hzve done all these wonderful and selfless things and no-body is<br/>
saying thankyou,or you are wonderful? None of that was meant sarcastically!<br/>
Were you not allowed pets as a child and you think your kids should be extra<br/>
grateful, and, well, actually help? Sounds like the helping a bit needs to<br/>
become helping a lot. I&#39;m sure unschooling doesn&#39;t mean doing what the heck<br/>
you like and ignoring the basic needs of life, such as feeding the animals,<br/>
throwing a hoover round, dusting the cat.<br/>
Sounds like there&#39;s something else going on and you&#39;re venting it on the<br/>
pets situation. Any chance of a break and some time out (away from family<br/>
and home, or you home and family somewhere else!).<br/>
Any time you feel like a rant....<br/>
Carolyn<br/>
<br/>
PS I think everyone feels that way at some point in their lives (and<br/>
probably more than just one point!).<br/>

<br/>
Although I don&#39;t have the same animal issue you currently have, I can <br/>
completely identify with your frustration right now. I am a people pleaser. I say <br/>
yes, even when I know damn good and well I should say no. I often then feel <br/>
resentful because I&#39;m stuck in the yes, that I really wanted to be no, but didn&#39;t <br/>
want to &quot;hurt&quot; anyone. But then who ends up &quot;hurt&quot;...me and everyone in my path <br/>
while I am resentful. I am working hard on not jumping to rescuing the world, <br/>
volunteeering for crap I don&#39;t want to do and fixing everyone around me. And <br/>
in working on this, I have found I do some of it so that I don&#39;t have to deal <br/>
with certain parts of myself and the flip side that wants to be the <br/>
martyr/rescuer. I have plenty of my own crap to work on, but it&#39;s easy to ignore when <br/>
I&#39;m helping or taking care of everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
So although I won&#39;t kick you, I will say, you are not the only one and <br/>
sometimes knowing that can help immensely. I have one friend who happily kicks me <br/>
when she sees me running on empty and will thwap me in the head when she sees or <br/>
feels me readying up to take on more. I have to say, I really appreciate it <br/>
when she does that though. It&#39;s more comforting than anything else because she <br/>
knows how I operate and can really get me to stop and question my own motives.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you and feel free to vent anytime!!!<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; I&#39;ve been trying to give myself an attitude adjustment.  I need a web <br/>

or something that I can just click into each day and get a new kick up the<br/>

There MUST be quote-a-day, daily affirmations webpages.<br/>
Maybe we should make one for unschoolers!!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&gt; I&#39;m feeling resentful.  First it was secretly resentful, then it went to<br/>
<br/>
&#39;just get on with it and smile&#39; resentful, now it&#39;s sneaking out of my mouth<br/>
<br/>
resentful.  *sigh*  I know that I&#39;m doing it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Shot in the dark, but if the resentment has ANYTHING even vaguely to do with <br/>
unresolved issues of your own childhood and IF (just if) one of your parents <br/>
was an acoholic, I KNOW there are daily affirmations to get over some of those <br/>
feelings that can linger for a whole life and make it hard for people to <br/>
respond openly and freely to others without resentment.<br/>
<br/>
If that didn&#39;t apply, WONDERFUL.  Better if it doesn&#39;t.  But for me, if I <br/>
hadn&#39;t worked hard on those adult-child-of-alcoholic issues, I&#39;d never be the mom <br/>
I am now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; I want to be excited and happy to go and feed the goats and the puppys.  <br/>
I<br/>
<br/>
am for the morning feed but then my tiredness catches up and I&#39;m a grumpy<br/>
<br/>
bitch for the rest of the day.  Aaarrgh.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts are real, and if your day is full of grumpy thoughts and tired <br/>
thoughts, changing thoughts will make a difference.  Would you rather have a happy, <br/>
fed puppy or a turning-mean, hungry puppy?  See it as a positive thing for <br/>
the puppy&#39;s whole future, and your future with the puppy.<br/>
<br/>
I could get really resentful that in the same week I&#39;m checking mousetraps, <br/>
I&#39;m feeding cats.  But they DO catch mice when they can, there&#39;s just one <br/>
cunning mouse they haven&#39;t found.  They&#39;re not lazy cats, or criminal cats.  This <br/>
mouse is too smart for them, and maybe for me!  So instead of seeing our house <br/>
as ruined by the presence of a mouse, we see it as our having a courageous, <br/>
smart mouse who will be out even when people are in the room, who is too smart <br/>
for cats.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a healthier attitude and more interesting than for me to think that I am <br/>
dumb, and the cats are dumb, because we have a DUMB mouse.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a mouse.  But the &quot;DUMB&quot; load of DUMBNESS would not be good for me, <br/>
the house, the kids, the cats...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Okay, time for me to go and breathe -&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And that too!  <br/>
Best first move.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s today&#39;s affirmation from the page listed right below it:<br/>
<br/>
I am grateful for the new experiences in my life. My open mind and open heart <br/>
reap many rewards.  <br/>

<br/>
This reminds me of a situation just last month with my oldest son (who <br/>
doesn&#39;t live at home).<br/>
<br/>
He kept telling me about this mouse that would just come out and stare at <br/>
them, didn&#39;t matter if there was company or not.  Matthew also has a BIG tom cat <br/>
that is into things like catching mice and such.  Cat did not catch this mouse <br/>
though they thought it had a time or two.<br/>
<br/>
The smart mouse would linger on the stairs just long enough to get some one <br/>
to give chase with a book or some other object they were SURE would be the <br/>
undoing of the mouse.<br/>
<br/>
Finally Matthew catches the mouse in a trap, a glue type trap.  He finds it <br/>
and the mouse is alive.  It has a chunk of ear missing that has healed, <br/>
probably from the cat, he looks at the mouse, proud that he&#39;s finally outsmarted this <br/>
creature, then he takes him outside and turns him loose beside his front <br/>
porch.<br/>
<br/>
He said he felt bad doing anything else.  He said it sorta felt like they had <br/>
been playing games with this mouse for months and it turned from a rodent <br/>
into something else.  Something he couldn&#39;t destroy.  I&#39;m sure that mouse will <br/>
probably be back, probably already is.<br/>

COURTESY OPENS ALL DOORS.<br/>
-----------------------------------------------<br/>
There is no investment you&#39;ll ever make that will pay you so well<br/>
as the effort to scatter sunshine and good cheer where ever you are.<br/>
<br/>
The deepest principal in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.<br/>
If you treat an individual as if they were what they ought to be and could <br/>
be,<br/>
they will become what they ought to be and could be.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone thrives on being appreciated, loved and needed.<br/>
There is no stimulus like that which comes<br/>
from the consciousness of knowing that others believe in you.<br/>
<br/>
Applaud others when they run.<br/>
Console them when they fail.<br/>
And cheer them when they recover.<br/>
<br/>
As water is to a flower,<br/>
so is praise to the heart of another.<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] attitude adjustment - totally self<br/>
indulgent<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to give myself an attitude adjustment.� I need a web page<br/>
or something that I can just click into each day and get a new kick up the<br/>
arse.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling resentful.� First it was secretly resentful, then it went to<br/>
&#39;just get on with it and smile&#39; resentful, now it&#39;s sneaking out of my mouth<br/>
resentful.� *sigh*� I know that I&#39;m doing it.� I know that it&#39;s dragging me<br/>
down (honestly don&#39;t think the kids take that much notice because I go<br/>
through cycles like this).� I don&#39;t want to be the person that I&#39;m being.�<br/>
I&#39;m tired on top of it too so that&#39;s not helping and is maybe the cause of<br/>
it a bit too.<br/>
<br/>
I think the thing that makes me feel the worst is that it&#39;s ALL MY DOING.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;yes, you can come in the house tiny feral kitten&quot;<br/>
I said &quot;yes let&#39;s get two goats that I&#39;ll have to bottle feed three times a<br/>
day&quot;<br/>
I said (last Saturday) &quot;oh look at these poor pathetic defenceless fluffy<br/>
puppies, yes we&#39;ll bring them home so they can poo and pee everywhere and<br/>
need lots of attention and eat enormous amounts of food and grow into high<br/>
energy border collie/labradors&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I never wanted pets.� I always said I didn&#39;t want pets.� So what the hell is<br/>
wrong with me that I went from no pets to 5 pets in just 9 months??!!� It<br/>
was all my decisions too!� I didn&#39;t have kids nagging me for these animals.�<br/>
They didn&#39;t even know about the goats and the puppies!!!� Oh bugger.<br/>
<br/>
I knew how much responsibility I&#39;d be taking on.� Yeah, I was hopeful that<br/>
the kids would be soooooo happy to have the pets that they&#39;d joyfully help<br/>
me with looking after them and they do help a bit.�<br/>
<br/>
I just need a big hoooooge kick up the bum.� So kick me people!� My head<br/>
voices just aren&#39;t doing the job.<br/>
<br/>
I want to be excited and happy to go and feed the goats and the puppys.� I<br/>
am for the morning feed but then my tiredness catches up and I&#39;m a grumpy<br/>
bitch for the rest of the day.� Aaarrgh.<br/>
<br/>
I want to smile at the kids and go outside and play with the puppies and the<br/>
kids together all at the same time but then I go into freak out mode and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to watch everyone all at the same time and I give orders and I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m making everyone miserable.� And I worry that I&#39;m not gonna get<br/>
anything done inside that I need to do to have a reasonably sane household.<br/>
<br/>
I could rave on for hours.� I think I&#39;d better right all this down in a book<br/>
somewhere so I can get it out of my head.�<br/>
<br/>
I know that unschooling is about life.� It is life.� It&#39;s my life.� I just<br/>
want to be better at it and let go of the resentment (which is mostly<br/>
resentment at myself I think).� I need tools for that.� I need to move<br/>
toward the joy.� It has to come from within.� I know that.� I need help with<br/>
it.� Help me.� I&#39;m ready.� Okay, time for me to go and breathe - I can feel<br/>
the hysterical laughter starting up and I need to nip it in the bud or I&#39;ll<br/>
really freak everyone out LOL<br/>

Shot in the dark, but if the resentment has ANYTHING even vaguely to do with <br/>
unresolved issues of your own childhood and IF (just if) one of your parents <br/>
was an acoholic, I KNOW there are daily affirmations to get over some of those <br/>
feelings that can linger for a whole life and make it hard for people to <br/>
respond openly and freely to others without resentment.<br/>
<br/>
If that didn&#39;t apply, WONDERFUL.  Better if it doesn&#39;t.  But for me, if I <br/>
hadn&#39;t worked hard on those adult-child-of-alcoholic issues, I&#39;d never be the mom <br/>
I am now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
O.K.  This really hit a nerve with me.  I have resisted going to ACA meetings, etc. because my alcoholic father wanted me to.  Talk about resentment! What book would you reccomend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245247767">This is a bit long and rambly again - sorry....<br/>
<br/>
Okay,  these are the exact responses that I was looking for and desperately needing.  Thanks for the web sites, too!  I could have googled them I know but really, yesterday I was too busy goggling to google &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday afternoon I cleaned out a big old dog kennel for the goats.  It was left by the previous owner and was full of nasty old sheep bones.  It&#39;s in a pen with a wattle tree and some nice long grass.  The goats like it in there.  I think that relieved a little of my &#39;stuff&#39; that I&#39;m feeling right now.  I was worried about the goats not having anything to graze on and nibble.  Now I don&#39;t have to walk them unless I really want to have fun with them.  That&#39;s one thing off my mind.  I think the getting out in the fresh air and working my butt off helped a lot too.  The endorphins were flowing and I felt good when I&#39;d finished and the goats were in there munching the tree.<br/>
<br/>
The puppies - now that the goats have a new day home, I&#39;ve moved the puppies into the goats old day home which is just outside the loungeroom window.  I can see what they&#39;re doing, we can all interact casually with them when we go outside on little errands to the bin or whatever.  I don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re just stuck in the cat enclosure being miserable.  At night they can go into the cat enclosure because it&#39;s more secure.  That frees up the shed (which we used to live in) so that I can clean up the floor (disinfect from the puppy doings lol) and set it up as my craft room/visitors overnighter/party room(for Emma - she&#39;s a party girl).  <br/>
<br/>
This morning I got the animals feed ready and went to wake up Emma.  &quot;Are you coming to help with the animals, honey?&quot;  &quot;Can you do it alone this morning mum?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I want to be able to say &quot;yeah, sure, not a problem, honey&quot; and really mean it and smile and tuck her quilt around her snugly so she doesn&#39;t get cold.  Instead I said &quot;yeah, sure&quot; with a half smiling voice but inside my guts had started churning.  I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s because I&#39;m disappointed with my own attitude and not really disappointed with the kids attitudes.  They&#39;re kids.  They have a lot of years to sort out their feelings.  Me dumping guilt on them isn&#39;t going to make the sorting easier for them.  I&#39;d be doing this stuff if I didn&#39;t have kids and I&#39;d be doing it because I wanted to do it.  I want to do it now.  I like the animals.  I like talking to them and being cuddled by them (even the goats cuddle lol)<br/>
<br/>
I do have lots of issues to deal with.  I don&#39;t think any are really from my childhood.  It&#39;s mostly adult stuff - oh I don&#39;t know maybe it&#39;s all childhood but didn&#39;t come out til I was an adult.  Anyway it&#39;s all there and it doesn&#39;t go away.  None of it to do with alcoholic parent/parents thank goddish.  I feel alone.  I hate that.  Like there&#39;s someone missing that I need.  I&#39;m in a house full of kids and animals and I feel alone.  Now I&#39;m getting somewhere.  Thanks guys, I need to let myself feel sad about something.  I can feel it happening now and I need to go somewhere quiet and let it happen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for clogging the list with my crap.  I thought it was about unschooling but it&#39;s about me.  I appreciate the help and insight that you&#39;ve given me - thankyou.<br/>

Lee-Ann,<br/>
I struggle with that one...not about animals,  but about other<br/>
&quot;things&quot;....Meaning,  I want to say,  &quot;yeah,  sure,  I&#39;ll go ahead and<br/>
do it.&quot;  I still sometimes hear the guilt trip coming out of my mouth<br/>
before I can stop it!  And then I wonder how to repair that, if it&#39;s<br/>
possible.  I know it happens when feeling overwhelmed and pulled in too<br/>
many directions at once;  when I can&#39;t seem to accomplish any of my own<br/>
goals.  I am the one not enjoying my life,  then I look around and see<br/>
happy children doing what they want;  and resentment jumps in - then,<br/>
unfortunately at times,  it jumps out of my mouth to attack them in the<br/>
form of a guilt trip. <br/>
<br/>
I look at myself overall and believe these instances occur less<br/>
frequently than they used to.  I&#39;ll probably never be perfect,  but my<br/>
goal is to recognize it coming...maybe at that early frustration level<br/>
(which is always magnified during certain hormonal phases and when I&#39;m<br/>
very tired).  And to evaluate our current life to see if there&#39;s a way<br/>
to build in &quot;preventative maintenance&quot;.  For me,  it&#39;s four children and<br/>
a hubby who works 12-14 hrs most days.  There are no &quot;Mom&#39;s helpers&quot;<br/>
around....though I&#39;m looking.  I think I need to pay a sitter once<br/>
weekly or occasionally,  but the budget is tight,  it&#39;s hard to justify.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  sorry for the ramble!<br/>
<br/>
Susan....also noticed you&#39;re in Australia....maybe the weather&#39;s a<br/>
factor for you, too?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646755951">thanks susan,<br/>
<br/>
hmmm hadn&#39;t thought about my hormones kicking in.  I&#39;m probably pre menstrual and I&#39;m not used to having such a hard line drawn between my pms times and me being normal.  I think that&#39;s a good thing, that there is actually a marked difference now instead of me being a grumpy bitch all month lol.<br/>
<br/>
yeah, I can relate to your email a lot.  I&#39;m trying to count to 10 before I say anything to anyone at all.  I want to be way more mindful about everything that comes out of my mouth.  I hope I remember this in the morning though lol.<br/>
<br/>
The weather here in australia is finally getting &#39;springish&#39;.  It&#39;s raining buckets right now but generally the air is feeling slightly warmer.  I just need to get my insides right.  do some soul work &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway it&#39;s way late here.  I&#39;ve been chatting to a quilting group and that has renewed me heaps.<br/>
<br/>
Going to bed now<br/>

Counting to ten only works if you&#39;re breathing slowly and deeply and looking <br/>
at (or thinking of) the sky or something else airy and big and peaceful.   If <br/>
you count to ten holding your breath, holding your frustration, with a roaring <br/>
anger in your ears, the adrenaline isn&#39;t dissipating (the purpose of counting <br/>
to ten, to let the adrenaline pass, and hopefully to think of some good <br/>
options from which you can choose), it&#39;s just being focussed into a beam of <br/>
extraordinarily dangerous power.<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re breathing, you could think &quot;I love these people,&quot; or &quot;whatever I <br/>
say could last forever.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(You probably knew that, but maybe somewhere on this list there&#39;s someone who <br/>
hadn&#39;t considered it. &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>

If you wanted them, I wouldn&#39;t even ask her to feed them, or I&#39;d pay her to do <br/>
it (I pay our son to feed the sheep and goats and help with their care.)  If <br/>
the pets are theirs, I would nicely tell them (not ask, tell) &quot;The animals are <br/>
really hungry, hon.  It&#39;s time to feed them.&quot;  I don&#39;t make my kids do <br/>
anything.  I ask them for help with things, and out of kindness and consideration, <br/>
they help which I REALLY appreciate.  I try to never deny them help or something <br/>
they want when they need it either. <br/>
<br/>
 But I remind them of something that was their choice in the first place or <br/>
their responsibility.  Feeding and taking care of a &quot;being&quot; that depends on <br/>
them, to me, is a necessity.<br/>

We too use those no-kill traps.  One time my husband went out into the woods <br/>
and there was a hawk sitting in the tree above him, the hawk watched very <br/>
carefully as the mouse was released and then swooped down and got it almost <br/>
immediately.  The hawk did not seem at all perturbed by husband&#39;s presence!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1407096802">Good point Sandra &lt;g&gt;  I was thinking more along the lines of any sort of speaking at all.  I tend to say things that don&#39;t need to be said to the kids.  You know kind of &#39;manage&#39; them a bit.  I hate that.  It&#39;s like I&#39;ll say &quot;don&#39;t forget to put the cereal away&quot;.  If someone did that to me I&#39;d probably leave it out just because thankyou very much!!  It&#39;s not a snarky voice - quite often it&#39;s a loving mummy voice - but it&#39;s still the wrong thing coming out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to dive into the archives at unschooling.com later today and immerse myself.  I need heaps of reinforcement at this stage.  You know I&#39;d even forgotten my count to ten idea until I started reading the responses.  *sigh*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642700809">Yeah Nancy, you must have missed the original post &lt;g&gt;  It happens a lot lately.  <br/>
<br/>
I always said I didn&#39;t want pets but then for some bizarre reason known only to my subconscious I &#39;saved&#39; a feral kitten (that probably didn&#39;t need saving at all), said yes to two goatlets which were offered to us and which the kids knew nothing about, and then just had to &#39;rescue&#39; two border collie/labrador pups from the vicious puppy from hell that was sharing their pen in the feed shop (which the kids also knew nothing about).  All this in 9 months lol.  So as you can see it&#39;s all my doing.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I asked Emma if she wanted to help is because she asked me to wake her up to help me &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m doing much better now with the whole animal thing.  In just the couple of days since I posted to this list I&#39;ve had so many good thoughts coming from you all and it really has helped me.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering exactly what is happening with my life - you know the big philosophical questions - and I figured, well, I don&#39;t know exactly why I&#39;m here but I&#39;m gonna make the most of it and be as happy as is hoooomanly possible and hope that my happiness inspires others to be happy also.  It&#39;s difficult for me to do that - especially when I don&#39;t remember these things from hour to hour and I&#39;ve been secretly and not so secretly miserable and sour for such a long time.  One of my brothers friends once asked me if I had my period all year because I was such a grouch.  That was when I was 14.  Maybe he caught me on a bad day and the label stuck with me.  sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re basically still in a deschooling/de-stressing phase here.  It&#39;s been 18 months since the kids left school but not quite that long since I&#39;ve made a conscious effort to quit trying to control every little thing.  I have a long way to go and I hope the kids don&#39;t get jerked around by me too much.  I guess they can&#39;t get jerked if I make the leash long enough can they???<br/>
<br/>
Anyway I&#39;ve rambled again.<br/>
