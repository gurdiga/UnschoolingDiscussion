felt weighed and measured.   Maybe bigger kids need more food than smaller <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-862068985">Alright, I&#39;m frustrated tonight - my kids were at each other all day and particularly two of them are at each other all of the time.  I&#39;m at my wits end.  I read these &quot;unschooling&quot; discussions but all I hear is what I shouldn&#39;t do as a good &quot;unschooling&quot; parent which seems like a whole lot.  But, what can I do to guide these little ones who are saying and doing things that I don&#39;t like &quot;I hate you, you aren&#39;t my brother anymore, etc, etc&quot;.  Do I just stand by and watch them kill themselves and each other??  Am I totally on the wrong track?  What can I do?  I try to be tolerant, listen, reason with them about their feelings etc, but nothing seems to work.  Then, I end up resorting to time outs and I&#39;m still not getting anywhere.  Ahhhh!!   <br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I&#39;m new to the discussion group.  I homeschool four - Aria, 7, Siena, 6, Cosimo, 5, and Lorenzo 3.  It&#39;s mostly Aria and Cosimo that are at it all the time.  Siena is a blessing and easy to say the least.  I don&#39;t show favoritism.  Aria and Cosimo seem to have &quot;controlling&quot; personalities and when one looses control all chaos breaks loose.  How can I get these two to include each other in play and stop fighting so much??  Any help and suggestions would be most appreciated?  Lorenzo, who is adopted, is picking up horrible things from his brother, Cosimo, who is giving me a very hard time right now.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for any help,<br/>

Hi Elisa,<br/>
<br/>
Does the arguing seem to erupt at certain times (lunch time, late <br/>
afternoon, early evening), or during certain games?  Distraction <br/>
often works.  If a storm is brewing (an emotional storm, that is <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), suggest a family walk or game outside.  If that isn&#39;t <br/>
possible, perhaps you could suggest a bubble bath?  My kids were <br/>
delighted with a bubble bath in the middle of the afternoon.  Try to <br/>
avoid games that depend on outright competition.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say anything like, &quot;Okay, since you can&#39;t play nicely <br/>
with each other, you can&#39;t play this game.&quot;  You&#39;re setting them up <br/>
for another argument, because then they&#39;ll attack each other <br/>
saying, &quot;It&#39;s your fault we can&#39;t play this game anymore!&quot;  An <br/>
escalation in hurt feelings in inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could calmly turn on some quiet music and set out some <br/>
art supplies like soft dough or stuff for collage work?  Clay or <br/>
soft dough is great for these turbulent episodes.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to reason with a person while he/she is angry doesn&#39;t work.  <br/>
Anger clouds reason.  The anger has to dissipate before reasoning <br/>
can occur.  This is true in adults, and even more so in children.<br/>

<br/>
Pam&#39;s suggestion is important.  Get those books quickly and use them.  It <br/>
will save you a lot of grief and undoing.   They&#39;re easily available, but if you <br/>
can&#39;t get out to a bookstore get them used from amazon.  And maybe while <br/>
you&#39;re out there looking for them online, read reviews and summaries and you might <br/>
be able to pick up a few good hints that way.<br/>
<br/>
The quotation marks on &quot;unschooling&quot; make me think you&#39;re not too sold on <br/>
unschooling.  That&#39;s okay, but don&#39;t undo things until you have something to <br/>
replace them with.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I try to be tolerant, listen, reason with them about their feelings etc, <br/>

<br/>
What did Yoda say about trying?<br/>
&quot;Try to be tolerant&quot; is faking.  You&#39;re either tolerant or you&#39;re not.  But <br/>
&quot;tolerant&quot; isn&#39;t what you want here.  Understanding and compassion are what you <br/>
want.   You try to reason with them about their feelings.   FEEL with them <br/>
about their feelings.  Hear them out.  Hold them and rock them and touch their <br/>
hair.  SMELL their hair.  That&#39;s helpful.  Look at baby pictures when they&#39;re <br/>
not around.  Envision the peace you want in your home and when you have a <br/>
decision to make, make the more peaceful choice.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you need to separate kids, pick one up and hold him while talking nicely <br/>
to the other one.  You&#39;re are still little and you can do that with some of <br/>
them.   <br/>
<br/>
Here are some of the methods I used with boys two and a half years apart <br/>
(still do someti when one looses control all chaos breaks loose.  How can I get <br/>
these two to include each other in play and stop fighting so much?? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you have enough room and stuff that they can play separately?  Playing <br/>
together shouldn&#39;t be a requirement for them.   Try to give your kids <br/>
opportunities to do what they would do if they didn&#39;t have all those other siblings.  <br/>
Give them things they can control, give them opportunities to make decisions <br/>
about meals and food and outings and  where things are in the house, maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- Lorenzo, who is adopted, is picking up horrible things from his brother, <br/>
Cosimo, who is giving me a very hard time right now.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would speak gently and quietly with Cosimo sometime when no one else is <br/>
around and tell him you&#39;re worried, and that Lorenzo wants to be more like him so <br/>
could Cosimo show Lorenzo some really sweet ways to be.  It might make no <br/>
discernable difference right now, but it will stay in him for a while and help <br/>
give him a basis for decisionmaking too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665357574">Thank you all.  I&#39;ve ordered the suggested books and will read them ASAP.  Thanks for the other suggestions too.  I&#39;m listening.<br/>
<br/>
Playing together isn&#39;t a requirement for them and they do have enough room and enough of their own space to go where they please.<br/>

I try taking them out one on one quite a bit also so they get alone time with Mom and Dad.<br/>
