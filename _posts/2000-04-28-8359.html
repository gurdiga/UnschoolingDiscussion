<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759803702">Olivia, I found a great one at Barnes and Noble but I<br/>
can not remember the name. We are going this weekend<br/>
so I will write down the name and phone number for<br/>
you. I do remember it was a cool mag. my 8 yr. old<br/>
seemed to like it! She loves Ranger Rick and The Big<br/>
Backyard. Also we all LOVE Kids Discover. Each issue<br/>
is one subject,like hurricanes or Thomas Edison<br/>
