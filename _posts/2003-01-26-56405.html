<h4>Q</h4>
<p><small><time>26 Jan 2003, at  9:19am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743097000">I&#39;d really like some feedback on a situation with my son. Satori, who just<br/>
turned three last Sunday,  has acquired the lovely habit of hitting me and<br/>
telling me to &quot;Shut up&quot;. It happened again today and I&#39;m ashamed to admit it<br/>
was all I could do to keep myself from hauling off and belting him! I really<br/>
am working on parenting consciously, and luckily I was able to control the<br/>
impulse.  But If I had ever hit my mother I doubt I&#39;d have lived to see my<br/>
next birthday and it is hard to overcome that early training,  I really do<br/>
want to raise him in a loving way, without fear and violence. I do not think<br/>
it is OK to hit a child.<br/>
However, he does need to know that this behavior is unacceptable.<br/>
<br/>
 On a purely practical level, this kid is going to be bigger than me one day<br/>
and I really think it makes sense that he knows NOW that it is not OK to hit<br/>
people smaller than ourselves.<br/>
We don&#39;t have guns here in Japan but there are way too many stories in the<br/>
news of teenage boys going after their parents with knives or baseball bats.<br/>
<br/>
The way I have dealt with it so far is, if we&#39;re at home I have him  sit in<br/>
his chair until we both cool off. He sits in the chair willingly, I think he<br/>
realizes that we both need to take a moment, maybe more me than him. If we<br/>
are out (which is when it happens more often, BTW) he gets one warning along<br/>
the lines of &quot;It is not OK to hit/say &quot;shut up&quot;. If he does it again, we<br/>
leave immediately and go home.<br/>
I&#39;m frustrated, it seems to keep happening in spite of my efforts....I&#39;ve<br/>
had the suggestion from several people that I should not give him a warning,<br/>
but go home immediately the first time he does it. That seems very coercive<br/>
to me, and I&#39;m really interested to see how this can be dealt with from an<br/>
unschooling point of view.<br/>
grrrr...he doesn&#39;t hit other kids or his father, just me. Gee I am soooo<br/>
lucky that I&#39;m the one he can express his negative feelings to. This is not<br/>
fun. I am making an big effort not to hit him (please don&#39;t slam me for<br/>
admitting that it is an effort) and here I am getting pummeled.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else dealt with this problem and what did you do about it? Is<br/>
this perhaps a situation where I do need to &quot;control&quot; him?<br/>

hurt---which is not too hard, because it really does hurt. Usually empathy <br/>
will set in, and you can talk about how much his hitting HURTS.<br/>

know:  It&#39;s what you do with your impulses that matter, not whether you <br/>
have them or not.  Believe it or not, your ability to move through your <br/>
(understandable) impulse to lash out at your son when he lashes out at you <br/>
it giving him the gift of seeing a person *not* hit and be mean when that&#39;s <br/>
what they feel like doing.  At least that&#39;s my take on this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Has anyone else dealt with this problem and what did you do about it? Is <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You cannot control him.  The only person in the world you can control is <br/>
yourself.  Period.<br/>
<br/>
When you start seeing things from that point of view, you will see how <br/>
great it is that you are not hitting him back.  When my son says or does <br/>
things that really bug me, I tell him how I feel.  I don&#39;t belittle him but <br/>
I say things like, &quot;I don&#39;t like that.&quot;  I try to find out what&#39;s going on <br/>
with him, but I also let him know that I&#39;m glad he lets me in on his <br/>
feelings.  I treat him with compassion.  If I&#39;m too angry about what he&#39;s <br/>
said or done, I tell him that now is not a good time for us to be together <br/>
and I leave the room with the promise that when we are more calm we can <br/>
talk about the problem.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 8 years old now.  He&#39;s a compassionate and gentle person, and he cares <br/>
about how I feel.  When he&#39;s made at me, he lets me know it and he will <br/>
sometimes say hurtful things, but we&#39;re together all the time, and when <br/>
people are together all the time they are bound to bump heads.  It&#39;s <br/>
okay.  When he used to hit me, I reminded him that I don&#39;t hit him and he <br/>
can always tell me what his problem with me is.  I also follow through by <br/>
working with him to resolve the problem.  If the problem can&#39;t be resolved, <br/>
then I am sad with him.<br/>
<br/>
The only other thing I can think of to say right now is that three years <br/>
old is really young to process strong emotions.  He may need more help from <br/>
you in getting at his real feelings.  You can say something like, &quot;I can <br/>
see that you&#39;re really _____ right now.&quot;  And fill in the blank with some <br/>
emotion that he may not be able to articulate so well.  It&#39;ll show that <br/>
you&#39;re compassionate enough to help him rale at you.  :-)  But, because not <br/>
to add &quot;but...&quot; after you finish that sentence and tell him how <br/>
inappropriate his expression was.  He knows it.  Just trust that he&#39;ll be <br/>
happy to replace the old tools that did not work with the new tools that do.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably get a whole lot of better answers than this, but I really <br/>
wanted to let you know that I admire you very, very much for not acting on <br/>
the impulse to hit.  Hooray for you!<br/>
<br/>
Kind wishes,<br/>

 <br/>
My son used to do that too,  usually during a meltdown of sorts.  What worked for us was to hold him close to me.   Giving him love.   Talking with a calm voice.   With me it was usually when I would try and get him to do something that he wasn&#39;t ready to do.    Like napping,  I would now do that alot differently, I&#39;ve learned.  What helped to avoid those tantrums was giving him little warnings like,  we are going to go in 10 minutes  and then in 5, same thing.   So he could warm up to the change.<br/>
 <br/>
I would also tell him that &quot;hitting isn&#39;t an option&quot;,  or &quot;we don&#39;t hit&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think the punishment thing works,  taking him away from the play group or what-ever.    It doesn&#39;t really explain why the hitting is wrong behavior.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps,   I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have tons of other advice also!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  But If I had ever hit my mother I doubt I&#39;d have lived to see my<br/>
next birthday and it is hard to overcome that early training,  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand that.  Earlier years with my kids, sometimes I would just calmly <br/>
say &quot;My mom would have hit me HARD if I had done that.&quot;   And that got my <br/>
urge to connect with that AND to separate from it out, and helped my kids see <br/>
that I was struggling with the experiment of what ELSE to do.<br/>
<br/>
-=- hitting me and<br/>
telling me to &quot;Shut up&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Who has taught him the phrase &quot;shut up&quot;?<br/>
If he&#39;s been told to shut up by ANYONE, maybe you should apologize to him and <br/>
hug him for the sad fact that someone has told him, at such a very young age, <br/>
&quot;shut up&quot; and tell him that it&#39;s not a nice thing for anyone to say to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
[I&#39;m not saying I would or never will say it, but by the time I get to the <br/>
&quot;shut up&quot; stage with someone, it&#39;s probably going to be &quot;shut the f*** up <br/>
before I call the police&quot; or it will be &quot;Shut up about that, I TOLD you I <br/>
don&#39;t want my kids hearing that kind of nonsense.&quot;]<br/>
<br/>
I was told to shut up many times by my mom, and when I my mind wanders over <br/>
my whole history with her, I don&#39;t feel bad that I don&#39;t talk to her much <br/>
anymore.  She had her chance when I truly wanted to talk to her.  <br/>
<br/>
But back to the immediate problem...<br/>
<br/>
The hitting comes after something or because of something.  What?<br/>
<br/>
If you hold him with his back to you and you hold his arms gently but pinned <br/>
and rock him back and forth, does he calm down?<br/>
<br/>
You could pretend to cry and tell him that hurts your feelings.  That&#39;s a <br/>
dramatic possibility I wouldln&#39;t use with anyone much older than two or <br/>
three, but it might help.  You could YOURSELF hug yourself and rock back and <br/>
forth (if you don&#39;t want to pretend to cry) and when he questions what&#39;s up <br/>
you could say you need people to be gentle and nice with you and if he won&#39;t <br/>
hug you you&#39;ll have to hug yourself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really do<br/>
want to raise him in a loving way, without fear and violence. I do not think<br/>
it is OK to hit a child.<br/>
However, he does need to know that this behavior is unacceptable.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s old enough to have heard and repeated &quot;shut up&quot; he&#39;s old enough to <br/>
hear some peaceful messages in words.<br/>

like &quot;Do you want me to shut up or do you really just want to get to go <br/>
swimming?&quot; or whatever it was.   &quot;If I could say yes to this, would you still <br/>
want me to shut up?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But that said, I think there  are lots of ways to say yes.  &quot;I want to go <br/>
swimming&quot; can be &quot;Yes, on Friday we&#39;ll go,&quot; or &quot;Yes, first chance I get to <br/>
get Guin to take you again,&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes&quot; doesn&#39;t always mean RIGHT NOW.<br/>
<br/>
And a little child might only be able to hear &quot;NO&quot; so many times before <br/>
feeling unheard or trapped, so &quot;No, not until Friday&quot; is WAY worse than &quot;Yes, <br/>
on Friday.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
There are very few kids who are even 99% reliabel in responding <br/>
to verbal commands, even the ones who are supposedly <br/>
obedient. I always think it&#39;s a mother&#39;s job to be within hand <br/>
reaching distance of any small child near a road or danger.<br/>
<br/>
Physical prevention is 100%. Verbal commands can never be.<br/>
<br/>
The test case mentioned above is the most common fear tactic <br/>
used by the &quot;obey on command&quot; crowd to justify spanking, <br/>
ironically!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1411546281">I haven&#39;t read all the responses yet but I&#39;m wondering what exactly is going <br/>
on with your son right before he gets upset and hits you? That&#39;s what I <br/>
think you have to look at first before you can figure out exactly what to <br/>
do. Seeing that it&#39;s coming and heading it off before time is important. Not <br/>
sure if he&#39;s frustrated, angry or what. Pay  close attention to what sets <br/>
him off. Sometimes that&#39;s very hard to do, especially when you are out and <br/>
not aware of what&#39;s going on for him every minute.<br/>

<br/>
Have you asked Satori why he wants to hit you?  Does he have enough <br/>
language skills to explain why he wants to hit you?<br/>
<br/>
None of my kids tried to hit me, although one tried to bite me once.  <br/>
I pulled back from her lunging teeth, and acted shocked.  (It wasn&#39;t <br/>
much of an act...I really was shocked! &lt;g&gt;)  She was four years old <br/>
at the time.  I asked her why she wanted to bite me, and she said <br/>
that she was mad at me.  I told her that I get mad at her, too, <br/>
sometimes but I don&#39;t bite her.  Then I asked her why she was mad at <br/>
me, she explained, and that seemed to diffuse her anger.<br/>
<br/>
It seems rather simplistic, but maybe you could find out why he wants <br/>
to hit you.  Perhaps he&#39;s overtired, or frustrated, or feels that HE <br/>
has no control.<br/>
  <br/>
I haven&#39;t read through the responses yet, so perhaps this has already <br/>
been suggested.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a side conversation with someone on this thread, I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Both Joyce and I (and maybe others, I don&#39;t remember) are trying calmly <br/>
and patiently to explain  (and the other 1000+ members of the list) what our <br/>
real children are really doing with the freedom they have.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-If you tell your children what to do, and what they shouldn&#39;t do, and you <br/>
have a bunch of rules, they will probably break rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If they do NOT have a bunch of rules, all they can do is violate <br/>
principles.  That&#39;s a whole different deal.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Within the past hour I spoke to Marty and his eight or so teen guests (I&#39;m <br/>
not counting them).  I said it was not good that before they left to go to <br/>
the park (they had just returned) that they had left foil candy wrappers <br/>
wadded up on the table and on the floor, and the empty bag there too.  I said <br/>
it&#39;s happened before and they shouldn&#39;t leave their trash around.  I&#39;d picked <br/>
it up for them.<br/>
<br/>
The one who bought the candy apologized because he brought the candy.  I said <br/>
that was fine, they just needed to put wrappers in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t angry, they weren&#39;t shamed, it was just matter-of-fact information.  <br/>
I earned the right to my speech because I cleaned up their mess.<br/>
<br/>
They violated the principle of being considerate.   They didn&#39;t break a rule. <br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;ll be more careful next time, for a real reason.  Not because they&#39;re <br/>
afraid of me or because I said NO.  Because I&#39;ve cleaned up after them and <br/>
they&#39;ve cleaned up after me and we LIKE each other.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve listened to me all their lives, because I&#39;ve listened to them all <br/>
their lives.<br/>
<br/>
It might not be as easy to start with older kids, but it&#39;s better to start <br/>
late than never, I think.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to describe the difference between having rules that kids can break <br/>
and creating a safe environment for kids--babies or toddlers or children or <br/>
teens--in which they can have freedom of movement and choice.  But there&#39;s a <br/>
difference, and the rules which operate within one don&#39;t apply to another.<br/>
<br/>
It takes some time to change parameters and expectations, but lots of <br/>
families have done it.<br/>
<br/>
So when someone says &quot;ALL children will test boundaries,&quot; it might be true in <br/>
a rule-bound (bound and boundaries being related) situation, like day care, <br/>
but it&#39;s not true where principles are in place instead of rules and every <br/>
decision is new and separate.<br/>
<br/>
If someone can explain this more clearly, please help!<br/>

oblivious to the danger, that is why you must be always within grabbing <br/>
distance if you want them to have a joyful journey. My older two boys would <br/>
respond to a yelp from mom, but my youngest was/is reckless.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the others who said to find out why your son is hitting.  I <br/>
won&#39;t say that I always respond as well as I think I should when my boys <br/>
hit me. I think my best response is an &quot;Ouch, that hurt,&quot; and then an <br/>
example of what our hands are for, a hug that comforts (and restrains, if <br/>
necessary, to keep him from hitting again.)<br/>
<br/>
I am guessing that Shut Up is not something you say to your son.  I know <br/>
that some people like to look reprovingly at the mother while saying or <br/>
thinking, &quot;Well, I wonder where he learned that?!&quot; I am not one of those <br/>
:-) I have a friend who says shut up to her dog, and my three-year-old is <br/>
quick to pick up on any new and delightful phrase he hears, to try it out <br/>
and see what reaction he will get.  Little reaction (i.e. me saying calmly <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t like when you say that&quot;) means he will stop saying it eventually. <br/>
Of course, while I am waiting for him to get tired of it he may say it to <br/>
everyone he meets.<br/>
