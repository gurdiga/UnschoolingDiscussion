<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317300649">***There are several who consider judicious application to be &#39;creepy&#39;<br/>
was that <br/>
the phrase used?***<br/>
<br/>
I used the word creepy because I was afraid you&#39;d think &quot;deranged&quot; was<br/>
too ostentatious. <br/>
But, I said blaming a child for a parent&#39;s loss of control was creepy.  <br/>
To be fair though, I also find the &quot;judicious application&quot; of corporal<br/>
punishment (translation: Premeditated assault) creepy, as well.<br/>
<br/>
***I would rather apply a thought out punishment for unacceptable<br/>
behavior than <br/>
be given to flights of animal rage...***<br/>
<br/>
And there are more choices than either of those.   There is the highly<br/>
evolved choice to not hit at all, ever.  Not in anger, and not in cold<br/>
blood.   <br/>
<br/>
***You (again meaning the listers who have responded) don&#39;t seem to<br/>
understand <br/>
that as adults we have hopefully already been trained and don&#39;t need<br/>
physical <br/>
reminders ...***<br/>
<br/>
And you (meaning you) don&#39;t seem to understand that some of us have given<br/>
a great deal of thought to living peacefully and respectfully with<br/>
children and have rejected the commonly held notion children need to be<br/>
trained like lab rats. <br/>
<br/>
We do understand unschooling.  We understand hitting.  We understand<br/>
human nature. Some of us even read that same biology book of yours.  We<br/>
also understand that everyday we can do better. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m forty.  I know stuff even if I use the word &quot;creepy.&quot;  Somewhere in<br/>
my boxes of Tick toys and wind up bouncing cats I have a little piece of<br/>
paper says I&#39;m half smart.  Does that matter?  Not if I can&#39;t think of<br/>
ways to live with my kid without hurting him.<br/>
<br/>
I have a child who is eleven, who has never been to school, and who has<br/>
never been hit.  He&#39;s nice.  People like him.  They never say he can&#39;t<br/>
come over, they never say he&#39;s an animal, they say he&#39;s the nicest friend<br/>
their kids have.   Two people on my block have given him keys to their<br/>
houses so he can take care of pets while they&#39;re away.    Does that<br/>
matter?   In a profoundly world changing way.  <br/>
<br/>
Does it matter that you&#39;ve typed twice the words as you needed to in the<br/>
hope of  impressing us with your intelligence so your defense of spanking<br/>
would sound well thought out?   We&#39;ve heard that stuff here before. <br/>
We&#39;ve heard most every argument and most every excuse and spanking is<br/>
still a big person hitting a little one.   <br/>

Thank you for trusting this list with personal information like that.<br/>
It helps me understand you better, and to have more confidence in your advice.<br/>
<br/>
If a thousand people give a thousand pieces of advice, I DO want to know <br/>
which of them live in happy homes where people are smiling and laughing and <br/>
playing with Tick Action Figures (or whatever they have that&#39;s fun), and which ones <br/>
are twitchy, paranoid people whose kids blow them off (or whatever they have <br/>
that&#39;s evidence that they didn&#39;t have any special ideas or convictions this <br/>
time around).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a policy that people have to introduce themselves before they <br/>
post, and on a list with this many people coming and going, it&#39;s FINE that people <br/>
come and lurk, or give short answers without credentials, or long happy <br/>
answers without credentials, but when someone comes raging in being merrily <br/>
disruptive, it&#39;s good to know why they think they have the right to tell us we <br/>
probably just haven&#39;t thought too much.  Of all the groups of people who have <br/>
thought, this group has thought more than its fair share, on average, and that&#39;s <br/>
what makes it so great.  Lots of people thinking lots of thoughts and sharing <br/>
their real lives.<br/>

<br/>
Anyone can come to my house and meet my kid and talk to him about<br/>
unschooling.   Anyone can see my extensive dust collection, my stupid<br/>
dog, my hideous, pinching pigeon.  That&#39;s all stuff I&#39;ve talked about<br/>
here.  I&#39;m a real person, with a real kid.  If I could make my scanner<br/>
work I&#39;d put his picture up.   <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how I could help anyone thinking about unschooling if they<br/>
couldn&#39;t see into my life and as much as it&#39;s possible from an e-mail<br/>
list,  see that the words I type are lived out here first, with a genuine<br/>
kid. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in Deer Lodge, Montana.   Anyone can come and visit.  <br/>
<br/>
We played at the river yesterday.   We threw rocks at floating ice chunks<br/>
until we couldn&#39;t feel our fingers any more.  We had a snowball fight. <br/>
We went sledding.  We watched &quot;Attack of the Crab Monsters&quot; and read<br/>
about dinosaurs.  We played Master Labyrinth and chess.  We stood on our<br/>
heads.  We made peanut butter and bird seed surprise for the Flickers.  <br/>
<br/>
Today we&#39;re going to Grandma&#39;s house.  She&#39;s making fresh tortillas and<br/>
we&#39;ll visit with Dylan&#39;s uncle because he&#39;s flying back to Anchorage on<br/>
Monday.  We&#39;ll probably watch a movie there, too.  I&#39;ll make a pan of<br/>
fudge to take along.<br/>
<br/>
My real and happy kid says a lot more about unschooling than I could ever<br/>
convey by analyzing human nature.   If I&#39;m afraid to talk about my real<br/>
unschooling life, how will I single-handedly change the world for the<br/>
better? &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ve printed out my super hero license and I&#39;ve sewn my Tick<br/>
suit.  Now, Evildoers, Eat My Justice!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, I will take the opportunity to come out of lurkdom to say hi, <br/>
since I posted 3 times yesterday :-)  I have so much to learn from <br/>
everyone here that usually I would rather read and think than post, <br/>
but the questions about spanking really tore at my heart and I wanted <br/>
to comment.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Susan, I live in Virginia, and I have 3 children, ages 14, 12, <br/>
and 5.  I have been married for 17 years as of next month.  <br/>
<br/>
My computer room is wallpapered in coca-cola advertisement wallpaper, <br/>
I have a coca-cola mousepad and a bright red rug in here, and I am <br/>
drinking a coke right now.  I have Johnny Depp&#39;s picture as a <br/>
screensaver on the computer, and I have seen Pirates of the Caribbean <br/>
13 times and the Lord of the Rings movies at least 8 times each in <br/>
theaters.  <br/>
<br/>
I love rocking chairs.  <br/>
<br/>
I am the most unusual person my friends know since I am a christian <br/>
who unschools, most of my family is vegetarian except for the 12yo <br/>
boy who is a carnivore to the max, I wear tye-dye t-shirts and jeans <br/>
and go barefoot most of the year, love all types of music including <br/>
country and classical, practice attachment parenting and no spanking <br/>
and am working on no coercive punishment threats (hard habits to <br/>
break, and sometimes the threat slips out of my mouth before I can <br/>
shut it).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve only been really unschooling since Fall 2002.  Before that we <br/>
were relaxed/unit study type homeschoolers, so we have been <br/>
homeschooling for 14 years now.  The 5yo has never been &quot;schooled&quot;, <br/>
and won&#39;t be unless by his choice.  My husband doesn&#39;t understand <br/>
unschooling, but he doesn&#39;t put much effort into making the kids do <br/>
school work, so he seems happy too.  He says, &quot;as long as they are <br/>
learning something...&quot;, well, that gives me a ton of leeway, doesn&#39;t <br/>
it!?  DH jokingly tells people I can make cleaning toilets sound <br/>
educational :-)<br/>
<br/>
We live in a very happy home, I think, anyway.  Right now my 14yo is <br/>
upstairs resting because she might have mono, my 12yo is out gaming <br/>
with some of his older friends, and my 5yo is in his own little world <br/>
in the living room with hot wheels cars spread all over the room in <br/>
every nook and cranny.<br/>
<br/>
We have two new little puppies who are 13 weeks old tomorrow, and I <br/>
am wondering if unschooling works for puppies as well as children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually been on the list for a while.  The first time I came in <br/>
here thinking I already knew all about unschooling, didn&#39;t take the <br/>
time to read for a while, and proceeded to get huffy and offended <br/>
when I was put in my place (and rightly so), so I left.  I later <br/>
found out how wrong I really was, and that Sandra had been right, so <br/>
I came back and lurked a little more humbly and took time to read and <br/>
think.  When I disagreed I took more time to think.  Had to sign off <br/>
again for a while when family was too busy, but now have returned <br/>
since life has slowed a bit for winter, and am enjoying reading and <br/>
thinking here.<br/>
<br/>
This past summer, after spending lots of time at the pool with a <br/>
school-at-home family, the older kids thought they were tired of <br/>
unschooling and wanted to return to &quot;curriculum&quot; again this year, so <br/>
we sat down and picked some out, but after about 2.5 months, realized <br/>
that it was getting in the way of the important things they wanted to <br/>
do and enjoyed, so they asked to return to unschooling.  I think that <br/>
was the hardest time for me, knowing that we would all be miserable <br/>
and letting them make that choice anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, who plays sports for a nearby private christian school, <br/>
was toying with the idea of actually going there next year, but went <br/>
to a party where some of her &quot;friends&quot; were, and they laughed in her <br/>
face when she told them.  They told her that she would never be able <br/>
to keep to a schedule or stick to the dress code, that she could <br/>
never learn latin, and that she would be &quot;murdered&quot; within 2 weeks by <br/>
the workload.  <br/>
<br/>
She came home and said she would not want to turn into the snobbish <br/>
jerks her friends were, and that she didn&#39;t want to give up her <br/>
freedom to have metallic green hair, sleep late, volunteer for the <br/>
Red Cross, and paint whenever she wanted to.  In my heart, all I <br/>
could think was, &quot;WHEW!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think I have so many questions to ask everyone, but <br/>
usually if I just lurk long enough, they get answered. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, with no restrictions on food...my children are allergic <br/>
to artificial coloring so I feel I do have to restrict that, to keep <br/>
them safe...at least for the 5yo who can&#39;t understand that this stuff <br/>
makes him a very angry person and hyperactive.  The older two <br/>
children must make their own decision as to whether or not they want <br/>
to eat that type of food and suffer the migraine headaches and <br/>
shortened attention span that comes during a reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this list, we&#39;ve almost successfully eliminated all <br/>
restrictions on gameboy, nintendo, food, the 5yo&#39;s pacifier, and tv <br/>
and bedtimes.  (DH still gets twitchy about bedtimes and too <br/>
much &quot;noise&quot; from the tv.)  I&#39;ve stopped seeing my children&#39;s <br/>
interests as &quot;just playing&quot; and &quot;hobbies&quot;, and realized that they are <br/>
the avenues by which they are learning important things, and have <br/>
stopped trying to limit the $$ and time spent pursuing them.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Sandra, about rules vs. principles, I love the line from Pirates <br/>
of the Caribbean when the girl says to Captain Barbosa that he must <br/>
stick to the Pirates&#39; Code, and he says, &quot;they&#39;re more like <br/>
guidelines, really...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, enough, the flood gates are closing again.  Back to reading and <br/>
thinking for me.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
There have been several discussions about this, and you can find them by <br/>
going to the archives for this list at yahoogroups and doing a search <br/>
for &quot;bedtime&quot; (if you want to).<br/>
<br/>
My husband has an early and inflexible job start time and has a hard <br/>
time falling asleep, so I do &quot;push&quot; my son, as nicely as I can, to be in <br/>
bed by 10.  And I did post here and discuss that I am a bit bossy about <br/>
bedtime at my house.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has also posted a few times about being considerate about noise, <br/>
which is a consideration extended to any sleeping person at her house. <br/>
I think you can find stuff in the archives about this that will be <br/>
useful to you.  Even food allergies have been discussed, I think.<br/>
