Pam,<br/>
I have a question ( a little bit OT) for ya.<br/>
There is a lady at work that I like a lot and she is having a horrible time <br/>
with college level algebra, a required course for her choice of degree <br/>
(hospitality management).<br/>
I told her there are some great books that would help her get the concepts <br/>
down first, and that may make the course doable for her.<br/>
She&#39;s already dropped the class but will have to do it again next semester.<br/>
What books should I tell her about? I wrote down the Algebra Unplugged.<br/>
I really value your math wisdom and I know it could make a big difference for <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll have the info. should any of my children need it one day....or I <br/>
could work on ME!! Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1367331157">Yes - Algebra Unplugged is the best there is for her purposes. It isn&#39;t <br/>
perfect - I love the first half and then I start wanting to do some <br/>
rewriting when I get into later parts of it. But it is the best there <br/>
is out there for algebra concepts described in words as opposed to just <br/>
a textbook that teaches how to do it.<br/>
<br/>
She might also try going to a therapist - believe it or not a LOT of <br/>
the reason people have so much trouble learning is that they have <br/>
mental blocks resulting from extreme anxiety. It causes them to not be <br/>
able to concentrate when math is involved. A therapist can, in 2 or 3 <br/>
sessions, teach her a number of clever techniques for getting past that <br/>
anxiety when she needs to be able to concentrate to learn.<br/>

<br/>
Wow. Maybe I should do this too. <br/>
I&#39;ll let her know, she&#39;ll really appreciate this info.<br/>
Thanks again, you are really quite a wonderful source of math help!!<br/>
