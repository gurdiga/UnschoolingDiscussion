&gt; How do you decide what they have to buy themselves and what you buy<br/>
&gt; for them?  What I sometimes run into is my daughter will spend her<br/>
&gt; money on something--usually yet another stuffed animal.  Then we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; run across something else she wants--something that I also think it<br/>
&gt; would be neat for her to have--and sometimes I end up buying it for<br/>
&gt; her anyway.  Then I end up thinking what&#39;s the point of giving her a<br/>
&gt; set amount in the first place?<br/>

You&#39;re trying to teach your kid to think about how to spend a certain<br/>
amount, and to live within a budget -- an allowance. Today, in our wussy,<br/>
tolerant, child-worship society (I&#39;m guilty, too) we have a hard time with<br/>
such limitations. We have credit cards (debt) that stretches our finances<br/>
out in time, and therefore keeps things, such as kids&#39; allowances,<br/>
&quot;flexible&quot; instead of limited. In other words, they learn that our words<br/>
don&#39;t mean what they say.  ( Hmmmm -- some will say that I&#39;m calling us all<br/>
liars in our dealings with our kids. SWSWSW  )<br/>
<br/>
Something that might help is telling your kid exactly how much money  you<br/>
earn and how it all gets spent, or saved, or given away to the needy...<br/>
<br/>
Make a simple balance sheet and show it to them  -- the facts.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s unschooling, that&#39;s letting your kids get involved in reality.<br/>
That&#39;s an example of trusting, and respecting the kids as equal members of<br/>
the family.   They can handle it.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t do that, you can be true to your idea of allowance by<br/>
saying -- about that &quot;other thing&quot; that the kid wants after she spends this<br/>
week&#39;s allowance on a furry animal -- &quot;OOOOO, I like it too, but the money<br/>
is already spent, so let&#39;s keep this thing in mind for how to spend NEXT<br/>
WEEK&#39;S allowance.&quot;      No explanation needed.<br/>
<br/>
There is a huge benefit in anticipating the joy of having something.<br/>
Often it&#39;s better than having it.<br/>

Ned, what do you not hate.<br/>
<br/>
Is there ANYTHING that doesn&#39;t earn your vitriol?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really tired of it.<br/>

&quot;Wussy&quot; is an insult to women, and you might want to stop insulting women.</div>
