 </span></blockquote>I saw some of these at our local Sam&#39;s Club Warehouse.  There was also some<br/>
GED prep software available. Your local library should also have some GED<br/>
prep books that can be checked out for free.  You also might check into what<br/>
opportunities exist for him with the Civil Air Patrol....<br/>

Enjoy your day,<br/>
