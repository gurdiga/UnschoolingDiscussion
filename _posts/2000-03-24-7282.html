<div id="ygrps-yiv-468437795">Hi all,<br/>
I&#39;m Joy, unschooling mom to a 13yos and 11yod.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling<br/>
for 7 years and have had our share of different curriculum and methods. <br/>
I&#39;ve been moving towards unschooling for several years basically to keep<br/>
the kids (and myself) from being bored to tears with texts and workbooks<br/>
(guess it&#39;s not our thing).  I live in Missouri and have to keep a<br/>
running tab of what we do and how many hours we do it.  Atleast we get<br/>
in some creative writing while making out our daily logs. :-)<br/>
<br/>
About the gas out...<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this has been covered and I&#39;m certainly not trying to<br/>
start a ruckus but for some interesting reading on why the gas out might<br/>
*not* work you might want to try:<br/>

I love the creative writing reference regarding the record keeping! When I <br/>
submit my quarterly reports, I need a couple of hours of quiet to fashion <br/>
those works of fiction in school-ese!<br/>
