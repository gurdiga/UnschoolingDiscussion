My husbands Grandmother owns 35 acres , at one time it (the barn) was mostly <br/>
used for race horses, there are still a few at the barn but mostly the horses <br/>
are used for &quot;pleasure riding&quot; My aunt has just baught the property to avoid <br/>
inheritance taxes . She invited my hubby and I to take one of the trailers <br/>
that are on the property. I spend so much time there , this will make my life <br/>
much easier . Finally I will be able to cook a meal at home instead of <br/>
running around at supper time to feed my animals. Its tuff being the animal <br/>
lover. I think all of my life I have been getting the rolled eyes when I <br/>
bring a new injured or lost animal home. Even my daughter says &quot; now mom, you <br/>
know daddy isnt gonna let you keep it.&quot;  LOL even the kids yell at me. Anyway <br/>
I cant wait. Hubby is happy too as now he will be able to find me. I am <br/>
always on the go.<br/>
