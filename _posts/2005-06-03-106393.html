<div id="ygrps-yiv-146583627">Hi list,<br/>
<br/>
(Sorry, I&#39;m not a native english speaker, so my english isn&#39;t perfect<br/>
.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all new to unschooling. I have read half of Grace Llewellyn&#39;s <br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook and must admit that the thought of <br/>
unschooling highschool and maybe college attracts me.<br/>
<br/>
But I just now realised that I&#39;m not the only one who could avoid <br/>
wasting (more) years in school. My brother has a three year old son, <br/>
and I want to at least introduce my brother to the idea that kids <br/>
learn on their own and that schools oppose this. <br/>
<br/>
If I suggest him a book, I think there&#39;s a fairly good chance that he <br/>
will read it. So, I would like to hear which book you think I should <br/>
introduce him to?<br/>
<br/>
I have looked at Amazon and have come up with John Holt&#39;s How Children <br/>
Learn, but I&#39;m all open to your ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>
