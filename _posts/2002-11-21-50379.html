  <br/>
I&#39;ve learned on lists like this that if I can step back from the defensiveness and insult welling up in me when someone disputes something I&#39;ve said, I may just find myself agreeing with them and making a very important paradigm shift.  I know it&#39;s difficult, but it&#39;s very worth it. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I already answered this:  Did I say ALL the time?  Did I say that she <br/>
could ONLY do these three things with me ALWAYS checking her <br/>
spelling?  No.  I was referring to one specific very brief period in <br/>
her life, our lives, when she did this, for a few months at age 8 <br/>
more than 7 years ago.  She was only allowed to use ICQ and IM <br/>
transmissions with supervision.  <br/>
<br/>
The one she used the most often and the one I supervised most closely <br/>
was a chess site that she liked because she was getting very good at <br/>
chess.  And it had accompanying chat/IMing.  I had already discovered <br/>
that some of the boys, claiming to be 12-13, used very sophisticated <br/>
langauge patterns and vocabulary and spelled meticulously, usually a <br/>
sign of someone much older than 12-13.  And I soon found that the <br/>
messaging on this site was deteriorating into vulgarity and sexual <br/>
innuendo, so we discussed it and she determined that it was no longer <br/>
a fun site.  <br/>
<br/>
She left that site but she continued some ICQ and IM messaging.  But <br/>
since anyone can be faking it on these kinds of transmissions I <br/>
monitored them.  Not so for e-mail, actually, though I would help her <br/>
with spelling if she asked, which she often did.  Which is how this <br/>
all got started in the first place, because she asked for help, <br/>
wanted to spell correctly.  She became very adept at using spellcheck <br/>
and various dictionaries and soon no longer needed any help from me.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t checked her spelling in years now.  The brief period when I <br/>
did this was also when I was running my business with my computer, my <br/>
only computer then, and so I also monitored to make sure that nothing <br/>
happened to my system, which was very important.  <br/>
   <br/>
&lt;&gt;Checking emails for safety reasons is a totally different issue <br/>
from checking emails because correct spelling is &quot;important for your <br/>
child&#39;s future.&quot;&lt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
My statement about spelling being important for your child&#39;s future <br/>
came after I had clearly stated that I felt that the convention of <br/>
spelling, along with other grammar and punctuation conventions should <br/>
not be pushed because they are not indicators of intelligence, which <br/>
related to a comment someone else had made, slurring folks who did <br/>
not spell correctly on message boards.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&gt;The former would probably strike many people as reasonable but not <br/>
so much the latter.  And you were specifically talking about <br/>
spelling, not about safety.  If you had said something vague like &quot;I <br/>
think it&#39;s very important to check my young daughter&#39;s emails before <br/>
she sends them&quot; that would be open to the question &quot;oh, why do you do <br/>
that?&quot;  But when the topic is spelling, and you say clearly that you <br/>
insist on proofreading because spelling&#39;s an important convention, <br/>
then there&#39;s no assuming going on... just responding.&lt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing goes back to a post that apparently everyone has long <br/>
forgotten, though it was only yesterday.  Time flies when you are <br/>
being attacked!  It is possible, of course, that the person who came <br/>
after me on this was only trying to deflect from my comments about <br/>
class and spelling and labeling people as stupid or lacking in <br/>
intelligence because they could not spell.  <br/>
<br/>
I still want to know why we are supposed to allow our children to do <br/>
what they want when they want, but we have different rules completely <br/>
for adults here?  And there&#39;s still this underlying assumption that <br/>
somehow, by osmosis, or by plowing through thousands of posts, all <br/>
new members are supposed to know exactly what the list moderator and <br/>
owner mean by their specific version of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I admit to being a little bit forewarned about the incongruity on <br/>
this list when I read, &quot;As discussed on this list and at the <br/>
Unschooling.com website, unschooling is *not* defined as the free <br/>
learning kids do outside of parent-directed learning, nor is it done <br/>
on a part-time basis.&quot;  This told me some things that unschooling was <br/>
NOT, but did not begin to define what it was.  And, gee, I thought <br/>
what my daughter was doing with spelling was just that:  parent-<br/>
directed learning while she was engaged in a learning activity of her <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
The other statement that telescoped subtle incongruity was:  &quot;An <br/>
unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and how of <br/>
their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>
Squarepants!&quot;   As I said, I&#39;m coming to your house for the throwing <br/>
rocks through windows phase of learning, or the melting candles on <br/>
carpet phase, or any of the other expensive and dangerous phases.  <br/>
<br/>
No child under the care of loving and responsible parents is totally <br/>
free to choose the what, when, where and how of their learning.  For <br/>
some things they might choose could also get the parents thrown in <br/>
jail, or will cost a lot to repair the damage done while choosing <br/>
some less constructive learning paths.  Maybe rich people&#39;s kids get <br/>
that kind of total freedom, but I&#39;m not rich.       <br/>

<br/>
Yes you did.  By the tense you used and the fact that the satement was <br/>
unqualified you said you did it, period.  No exceptions were noted.<br/>
<br/>
BECAUSE you used to teach you<br/>
UNDERSTAND the importance of spelling<br/>
THUS you allowed her...<br/>
AS LONG AS (which mean &quot;if and only if&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s clear grammatically and mathematically.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve defended it saying you mean to keep her safe.  <br/>
If you think better spellers are safer online than poor spellers, then <br/>
there&#39;s that prejudice about spelling again! &lt;g&gt;  (Prejudice about spelling <br/>
is understandable, as some said, which is one of the things that started all <br/>
this.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I still want to know why we are supposed to allow our children to do <br/>
what they want when they want, but we have different rules completely <br/>
for adults here? -=-<br/>
<br/>
My children are considerate and generous with their time and attention.<br/>
If they&#39;re being rude I ask them not to be.  If they say they&#39;re going to do <br/>
something which seems unsafe or not right for the circumstances, I question <br/>
them. (Their friends, too.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-And there&#39;s still this underlying assumption that <br/>

new members are supposed to know exactly what the list moderator and <br/>
owner mean by their specific version of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  =-<br/>
<br/>
By reading the description at yahoogroups, or at www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
How did you come to this list if not from one of those two gates?  If you <br/>
were passed the address by a friend, your friend could have clued you as to <br/>
where the description of the list was.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And, gee, I thought <br/>
what my daughter was doing with spelling was just that:  parent-<br/>
directed learning while she was engaged in a learning activity of her <br/>
choice.-=-<br/>
<br/>
So you DID see the description?  Before you joined the list or when it was <br/>
posted here?<br/>
<br/>
Parent directed learning is not unschooling.<br/>
What the description meant was that if a child&#39;s homeschooling is parent <br/>
directed but the parent says &quot;and in their spare time we unschool,&quot; that&#39;s <br/>
not the unschooling we&#39;re talking about.  There are people who use ABeka but <br/>
then claim &quot;but in the summer and on weekends we unschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The other statement that telescoped subtle incongruity was:  &quot;An <br/>
unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and how of <br/>
their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>
Squarepants!&quot;   As I said, I&#39;m coming to your house for the throwing <br/>
rocks through windows phase of learning, or the melting candles on <br/>
carpet phase, or any of the other expensive and dangerous phases.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re assuming and suggesting neglect and stupidity.<br/>
If you would read more than you post, you would see hundreds of examples of <br/>
learning which don&#39;t involve any rocks through windows or wax on carpet.  <br/>
YOUR definition of unschooling seems to involve those things.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
seen them done on purpose.  There is some wax on the carpet in my bedroom in <br/>
one place, but the kids didn&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-No child under the care of loving and responsible parents is totally <br/>
free to choose the what, when, where and how of their learning.  For <br/>
some things they might choose could also get the parents thrown in <br/>
jail, or will cost a lot to repair the damage done while choosing <br/>
some less constructive learning paths.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Your imagination and your ill wishes are not as valuable in informational <br/>
terms here as the REAL accounts of experiences of unschoolers with teenagers <br/>
who have never been in trouble, who have never damaged anything, who are <br/>
happy and well adjusted teenagers who are already making very responsible <br/>
decisions about their lives.<br/>
<br/>
IF your daughter has never broken anything valuable or been in jail, do you <br/>
believe that is only because you controlled her?  If not, what are you <br/>
implying?  That if you hadn&#39;t controlled her she would have been in jail?<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it.  But if you believe that, as you seem to from your unflattering <br/>
suggestions that our kids will or must be, then I don&#39;t think you are seeing <br/>
the unschooling we&#39;re talking about at all.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s okay.  I&#39;ve been helping people find other unschoolers and share their <br/>
experiences since my oldest was little, because I had so needed that kind of <br/>
input, and waited two months for the next issue of Growing Without Schooling <br/>
to learn more about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Now as much information as was in an issue of that magazine is written online <br/>
every single day.<br/>
There are others on this list, too, who have been doing this and writing <br/>
about it for five, ten years.  And they&#39;re not doing it to hurt you, or <br/>
anyone.  They&#39;re doing it to help children and families have more peaceful <br/>
and productive unschooling lives.<br/>

we had a field trip to the Hindu temple the other day. very cool. the <br/>
man who was our host told us we had to leave our shoes outside of the <br/>

be kept clean. but more importantly, because it was symbolic of leaving <br/>

<br/>
Children have the freedom to choose what they want to do. If my daughter<br/>
decides to take an art class, she signs up because she wants to do art, not<br/>
because she wants to do whatever.<br/>
<br/>
People who join a list about a specific topic are presumably coming to<br/>
discuss or read about that topic.<br/>
<br/>
This list happens to be about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And there&#39;s still this underlying assumption that<br/>
&gt; somehow, by osmosis, or by plowing through thousands of posts, all<br/>
&gt; new members are supposed to know exactly what the list moderator and<br/>
&gt; owner mean by their specific version of &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I like defining unschooling as natural learning. It&#39;s the way kids learned<br/>
from the moment they were born. Some people define unschooling as not doing<br/>
school. Some people define it as child-led learning. I find the defintions a<br/>
lot more useful to people who already understand unschooling. They are<br/>
shorthand ways of saying things we already understand but they are<br/>
misleading and leave out a huge amount of information for those who don&#39;t<br/>
already understand. For instance people will hear not doing school and<br/>
conclude they can&#39;t let their kids do workbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Some people also want to stretch unschooling into parenting so figuring out<br/>
how to be our children&#39;s partners in life as well as learning also gets<br/>
discussed. (Unschoolers who don&#39;t want to stretch unschooling into parenting<br/>
can find standard parenting discussed oodles of places on the internet.<br/>
There are very few places where &quot;unschooling parenting&quot; gets discussed and<br/>
this happens to be one of them.)<br/>
<br/>
Learning the definition of unschooling by reading about unschooling is like<br/>
a toddler learning English. Kids pick up the rules of word order just by<br/>
listening and using English. And it works a whole lot better than being<br/>
taught the rules of English.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This told me some things that unschooling was<br/>
&gt; NOT, but did not begin to define what it was.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The first paragraph of the introduction tries to give a flavor of how<br/>
unschooling gets discussed here. If it doesn&#39;t make sense to you then it&#39;s<br/>
probably a pretty good indicator that your defintion is very different. And<br/>
the last line of the first paragraph is:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>
&gt; find out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>
&gt; learning, come join us!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So does a place that advertises:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they<br/>
&gt; need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a<br/>
&gt; facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and<br/>
&gt; enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and<br/>
&gt; how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob<br/>
&gt; Squarepants!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>sound like a place you&#39;d like to hang out in?<br/>
<br/>
The second paragraph is intended to help people who arrive with some of the<br/>
common other definitions of unschooling that are popping up in the general<br/>
population. It was to help people figure out if this list would be useful to<br/>
them. The misunderstandings have gone way down since the description was put<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And, gee, I thought<br/>
&gt; what my daughter was doing with spelling was just that:  parent-<br/>
&gt; directed learning while she was engaged in a learning activity of her<br/>
&gt; choice.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As someone pointed out, parent-directed learning isn&#39;t part of the scope of<br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; No child under the care of loving and responsible parents is totally<br/>
&gt; free to choose the what, when, where and how of their learning.  For<br/>
&gt; some things they might choose could also get the parents thrown in<br/>
&gt; jail, or will cost a lot to repair the damage done while choosing<br/>
&gt; some less constructive learning paths.  Maybe rich people&#39;s kids get<br/>
&gt; that kind of total freedom, but I&#39;m not rich.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then your imagination is leading you to conclude that being free to choose<br/>
means choosing to stop thinking and stop caring and being free from<br/>
information and other people&#39;s feelings.<br/>
<br/>
We have families here whose children are free to choose and whose children<br/>
do take decision making seriously. My daughter could drip wax onto the<br/>
carpet or throw rocks through windows but she chooses not to because she&#39;d<br/>
see what would be gained by it (the result) wouldn&#39;t balance out what would<br/>
be lost (things ruined).<br/>
<br/>
Lots of kids who have been controlled get destructive when control is<br/>
released. But that&#39;s a response to the control not to the freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Children having free choice doesn&#39;t make much sense in our society.<br/>
Decisions of when to control children are based on what we&#39;re certain will<br/>
happen rather than anyone&#39;s real experience with what will happen. For<br/>
example it&#39;s easy to conclude that kids won&#39;t learn unless they&#39;re forced<br/>
because most (schooled) kids avoid anything that looks like learning when<br/>
they aren&#39;t in school. But the conclusion is based on the assumption that<br/>
having to go to school has no effect on kids behavior. That how schooled<br/>
kids behave is how kids behave. Obviously unschoolers know differently.<br/>
<br/>
And parents who have raised their children with the freedom to choose in<br/>
their lives also know differently: that control does alter people&#39;s natural<br/>
behavior and assumptions based on the behavior of controlled children (which<br/>
is most children!) doesn&#39;t apply to children without those controls.<br/>

<br/>
The wildest kids I&#39;ve evern personally experienced, as a kid and as an adult <br/>
dealing with other people&#39;s kids have been those who were also the most <br/>
controlled.  <br/>
<br/>
Too many families father-train their kids.  &quot;You better not let your dad <br/>
catch you doing that.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;If *I* ever see you doing that...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t give them easily understandable and real reason for behavior.  <br/>
They give them sets of rules all topped off with &quot;When I&#39;m there, you must <br/>
behave this way.&quot;  The counter argument to that is &quot;When I&#39;m not there, do <br/>
the opposite if you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When kids&#39; behavior is based on their own consciences and their own real <br/>
understandings of why it&#39;s politer or safer or kinder to do this or that, <br/>
there IS no counter argument.  There is no downtime.<br/>
