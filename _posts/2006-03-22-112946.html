<div id="ygrps-yiv-936248798">Dear People,<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was telling my husband this:  My 4yo daughter asked my why <br/>
children go to English school if they already know English - what do they do <br/>
there?  I told her they learn their numbers and letters, do drawing, play <br/>
dress ups, read stories etc.  She said, but we can do all that at home!  I&#39;m <br/>
glad I don&#39;t have to go to school, I like it here at home!  I was very <br/>
proud.<br/>
<br/>
But my husband&#39;s reaction was less than positive.  He said he doesn&#39;t want <br/>
me to &quot;put bad ideas&quot; in her mind about school in case she does go to school <br/>
later on.  He had a very positive school experience in an excellent small <br/>
village school (in England) of very high calibre and believes that if we can <br/>
find the same for Zoe, then she should go too.  From my reading, I don&#39;t <br/>
think I want her to go at all.  I told him that she can&#39;t help hearing me <br/>
tell people what I don&#39;t like about school in general and the schools <br/>
available here (in Hong Kong) in particular (which he seems to begrudgingly <br/>
agree with) and he told me he thought I should be more careful about what <br/>
she hears in case when it is time for her to go to school, she won&#39;t want to <br/>
as a result of what she has heard me say.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone else have differences of opinion with their spouses/partners on <br/>
the homeschooling/unschooling issue?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think he&#39;s right in that.  Something beyond your control could  <br/>
cause her to be in school and you don&#39;t want your voice in her head  <br/>
scaring her if she does end up in school someday somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of making home seem better than evil dark school, make home  <br/>
so cool that it&#39;s better than neutral, light school.<br/>
<br/>
Something that affected my thinking about school, before I had  <br/>
considered homeschooling, when Kirby was four, was another mom saying  <br/>
she would NEVER put her two girls in school.  I said &quot;I really liked  <br/>
school.  What if they would like it as much as I did?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;I hated school.  What if Kirby hates it as much as I did?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At that point, we were even, but she added this:  &quot;What are the odds?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Although I liked school myself, the vast majority of my schoolmates  <br/>
really hated it.  Some hated it because their homelife was good.   <br/>
Some hated it because they couldn&#39;t possibly succeed there.  Some  <br/>
were ignored or tormented by other kids day after day.  Before I was  <br/>
out of Jr. High, two had killed themselves.  They were &quot;good kids,&quot;  <br/>
tooâ€”kids in band and in the top 20% or so academically.  One had an  <br/>
embarrassing homelife, but the other was the son of our long-favorite  <br/>
art teacher and his home and family were nice.<br/>
<br/>
Odds were that Kirby was not going to enjoy school as I had.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby never went to school.  That other mom&#39;s two did.  She ended up  <br/>
having them out a couple of times kind of experimentally, but they  <br/>
wanted to go back because she didn&#39;t figure out how to make it fun  <br/>
and large.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668874685">I do. My husband doesn&#39;t agree with homeschooling period. He won&#39;t even give it a chance even though the public schools out here are so bad. I&#39;m in Oregon in the united states, near Portland to be exact, and their thinking about shutting down 11 elementary schools because there is no money for them. I mean come on! Anyways, i kinda understand where your coming from. My children would rather be home schooled, since their above public school grade level, but he just thinks it&#39;s my influence. I&#39;ve just kinda given in to a compromise that they can go to public school if he gets them into a better one. We&#39;ll have to see. Hope things go better for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008623891">Through this discussion, I&#39;ve considered myself lucky.<br/>
My husband and I used to disagree about homeschooling<br/>
our son. But after MUCH talk, not just my point of<br/>
view, but a few of our friends, that have kids in our<br/>
public school system, he came around to my side. I<br/>
supported my case to him with a lot of research. I<br/>
think if homeschooling is that important to you, than<br/>
you should be able to come up with some kind of<br/>
compromise. Most important, you should consider your<br/>
child&#39;s needs. We agree that public school would ruin<br/>
our child, at least for now. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152160323">Wow.  It&#39;s interesting the lady with the 2 girls asked all the right<br/>
questions.  Her answers illustrate the point you&#39;ve made in the past<br/>
about choices.  Two similarly good choices would have been happier<br/>
than the two drastically different choices selected from (&quot;no way&quot; to<br/>
school and sending them to school).  <br/>
<br/>
On that note, I enjoyed reading the &quot;balance&quot; article again: <br/>
