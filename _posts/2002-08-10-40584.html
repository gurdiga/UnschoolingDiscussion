<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004377787">I am coming late into the cartoon discussion thanks to my wacked-out <br/>
email account. I think I have mentioned before how much I love <br/>
cartoons and comics --my alter ego is TOON MAMA. So much so that one <br/>
of my toon ruminations have been about homeschooling and unschooling <br/>
&quot;awards&quot; to cartoon children.<br/>
<br/>
Here are my nominations:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The cartoon children most likely to benefit from unschooling.<br/>
CALVIN from CALVIN  & HOBBES<br/>
PEPPERMINT PATTY of PEANUTS<br/>
CARL and HOODZIE of AS TOLD BY GINGER<br/>
BUSTER BUNNY from ARTHUR<br/>
BART from THE SIMPSONS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most likely Christian homeschoolers.<br/>
LINUS from PEANUTS<br/>
all the kids from FAMILY CIRCUS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The most likely gifted homeschoolers<br/>
SCHROEDER from PEANUTS<br/>
LISA from THE SIMPSONS<br/>
and the kid from CHALK ZONE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate cartoon unschoolers<br/>
ELIZA & DEBBIE from THE WILD THORNBERRIES<br/>
<br/>
[For the record, because they travel so much, they have regulations <br/>
to comply with education laws. Even though their parents make them <br/>
write &#39;book&#39; reports, they are usually of their choosing AND usually <br/>
it involves one of their adventures. There are two episodes around <br/>
book reports that the kids end up writing on their own terms AND even <br/>
Eliza &#39;converted&#39; a tutor that the parents had brought in to help her <br/>
do her papers. There is also an episode about Debbie (the oldest) <br/>
wanting to go the school and the family being appalled yet supportive <br/>
--after all, they are unschoolers in practice].<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Who else would you nominate?<br/>
<br/>
Liza, aka TOON MAMA!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Who else would you nominate?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would nominate all the kids on Rocket Power, I don&#39;t think I have seen one <br/>
episode about school yet. Those kids are all over the place, playing various <br/>
sports, cleaning up the beach, building forts, helping Dad run the hamburger <br/>
stand, having their own enterprises. If they aren&#39;t hsers, they should be!<br/>
 <br/>
Zim from Invader Zim. Even though he is an alien sent to take over the earth, <br/>
and he goes to school to do this, he would make a great unschooler. He has <br/>
made his own home, he even made his own Ward-and-June-like parents/robots. <br/>
Also Dib from Invader Zim, he is the kid who *thinks* he knows that Zim is an <br/>
alien and is always out to prove it. This child is constantly learning. He <br/>
uses all the science things around his house. (His Dad is a scientist, who is <br/>
always at work, the kids don&#39;t see him much.) I nominate him for gifted <br/>
homeschooler, he would be the one we read about, in the paper, as the local <br/>
boy who won the National Spelling Bee, or the Science Fair. <br/>
<br/>
Timmy from Fairly Odd Parents, would really benefit from unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Most likely to be Christian Homeschoolers?<br/>
Bobby Hill from King of the Hill<br/>
Ned Flanders kids from The Simpsons<br/>
<br/>
Most likely to benefit from Unschooling?<br/>
Bobby Hill from King of the Hill<br/>
Hank Hill from King of the Hill <br/>
<br/>
~Nancy<br/>
