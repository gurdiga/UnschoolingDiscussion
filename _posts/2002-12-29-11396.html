&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, there are a lot of photos. I hadn&#39;t checked for a while... cool. <br/>
<br/>
I named my daughter Acacia and called her Cacie for 9 years; she named<br/>
herself Rain last summer and it seems to have stuck...<br/>
<br/>
And Samantha and Emily really look alike in that photo, Peggy! No doubts<br/>
about which two are related... I didn&#39;t notice so much in person, but in<br/>
the photo Em looks so much older all of the sudden.<br/>

Yes, it is uncommon in America. My dh is from England, it is a very English name. :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dh&#39;s great-grandfather was a Wotton; he changed the spelling to Wooton<br/>
after getting fed up with Americans rhyming it with &quot;cotton.&quot;  The only<br/>
person I&#39;ve heard pronounce it correctly was from Texas; we don&#39;t even try<br/>
to say it right, as the spelling is tough enough already.  We&#39;ve been<br/>
consoling our children, who now receive mail on occasion, with &quot;Get used to<br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nancy, who used to be a Smith!<br/>
<br/>
(btw, to pronounce it correctly, rhyme the first syllable with &quot;good&quot; or<br/>
&quot;wood&quot; - southerners say &quot;root&quot; this way - then kind of swallow the second<br/>
syllable.  &quot;WHUT&#39;n&quot; is close, I guess...  We just say WOO-tun :-)<br/>

Happy New Year from San Diego, where it&#39;s half-past 12 and almost all past<br/>
