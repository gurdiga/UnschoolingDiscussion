<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987374771">I&#39;ll try to keep this as short as possible. <br/>
<br/>
This weekend my dd 10 and I went to Chicago for a cheerleading event<br/>
she was in.  Hubby and ds 8 stayed home.  We left on Thursday so I<br/>
made arrangements for ds to stay at my MIL&#39;s house while hubby was at<br/>
work.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had issues w/ MIL before calling my hubby and saying things<br/>
about homeschooling but I always assumed she would not say or do<br/>
anything to the children.  I know, my mistake.<br/>
<br/>
DS 8 is not reading yet, and apparently she was having him write and<br/>
drilling him on his ABC&#39;s.  He went along with this because I am sure<br/>
he was trying to make his grandparents happy. MIL called my hubby the<br/>
next day and told him how concerned she was and that he can&#39;t even<br/>
write his last name and that maybe he&#39;s dyslexic.  Hubby pretty much<br/>
just heard her out and told her we weren&#39;t worried and hung up (that<br/>
pretty much sums up hubby and her relationship).<br/>
<br/>
I had also bought tickets to a play for the 3 of them (ds, mil and<br/>
fil) but they decided not to take him.  I had asked if they would take<br/>
him at least a month a go and would have made other arrangements if<br/>
they didn&#39;t want to.  She&#39;s a control freak and again, it was my<br/>
mistake for leaving him there.<br/>
<br/>
What my question is for this list, is what would you say to ds??  I<br/>
told him that I was sorry they did that and I would not leave him<br/>
there w/out one of us again.  I told him that people read at different<br/>
times and that he is starting to read and that it will just click.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t want him to feel like he&#39;s not smart (I don&#39;t know if he<br/>
does feel like this).  But hubby said he was spent Thursday night,<br/>
crying at his b-ball game saying it was cause he missed me (this isn&#39;t<br/>
how he would normally react).<br/>
<br/>
Today MIL sent me an email telling me how wonderful ds is and how good<br/>
he makes her feel.  I&#39;d like to respond how glad I am for her and does<br/>
she know she makes him feel like crap??  Of course she didn&#39;t mention<br/>
her &quot;concerns&quot; to me, but then again she never does.<br/>
<br/>
Also this did place a twing of doubt in hubby&#39;s mind, for the reason<br/>
that he doesn&#39;t want ds to feel less than because he&#39;s not reading.  I<br/>
think I&#39;ve smoothed that out, but I tried to click on a link Sandra<br/>
had posted on multiple intelligences but it didn&#39;t work.  I&#39;d like to<br/>
try that again!<br/>
<br/>
Mainly my concern is saying/doing the right thing for my son.  I will<br/>
never leave ds with them again, and I know I probably can&#39;t change<br/>
them.  So, should I even bother saying anything to her?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for the advice,<br/>
amy in iowa</div>

I would have a conversation and ask him if he knows why grandma would  <br/>

<br/>
Partly, you&#39;re rejecting the way she raised your husband.  She can&#39;t  <br/>
help but feel that IF you&#39;re right she wasted time and wasn&#39;t as nice  <br/>
as she might have been to her own son.  It would be easier and more  <br/>
comfortable for her if you would do as she did.<br/>
<br/>
Partly, she&#39;s honestly worried because she believes that once off the  <br/>
assembly line, one will never catch up.  That does happen at school,  <br/>
because school is all about sorting and grading and separating.   She  <br/>
can&#39;t really understand unschooling yet and maybe she never will.<br/>
<br/>
This is the most disturbing thing, and I would address it in writing  <br/>
if it were me:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I had also bought tickets to a play for the 3 of them (ds, mil and<br/>

they didn&#39;t want to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Several things:  Loss of opportunity for your son, loss of faith in  <br/>
his mother&#39;s assurance that she has arranged something for him, loss  <br/>
of faith in the grandparents keeping their word, and waste of the  <br/>
price of three tickets.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not cool for ANYBODY to do.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not a bad idea to append to the questions about the play.  I  <br/>
might say something like that I think my son&#39;s great too, and I hope  <br/>
the next time he visits her she&#39;ll be kinder to him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had problems with my in-laws.  They&#39;ve been better in the past  <br/>
few years, but that&#39;s a few years out of 30.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271787191">One of the things that I have found useful in the course of reviewing a <br/>
problematic situtation is to ask Jayn if she wants me to &quot;say something&quot; to <br/>
the people who have bothered her. Sometimes she does and she has a good <br/>
suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra about the failure to fulfil an obligation that they <br/>
apparently had agreed to, being an issue worth mentioning. I wonder if it <br/>
would be better coming from your dh than from you. We have a kind of <br/>
unspoken agreement here, he speaks to his mom when she questions  our <br/>
unschooling, and I deal with misunderstandings on the part of my stepfather <br/>
(who knows zip about children since I was 18 when he married my mother.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a while since I wrote about this, but I just remembered and it <br/>
might be useful to you.<br/>
<br/>
When my mother was alive, she was pretty vocal in her massive ignorance <br/>
about just about everything to do with attachment parenting, breast feeding <br/>
and education. It was tempting to send her everything I could find for her <br/>
to read. However I found what was useful was to send her information from <br/>
the kind of conservative sources that she was more likely to respect. For <br/>
example an article by Dr. Brazelton was much more likely to be read and <br/>
accepted by her than the *very same information* written up in Mothering <br/>
Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you MIL would respect information from reputable (in her eyes) <br/>
academic sources about multiple intelligences, child development, and <br/>
alternative education including deliberately delaying academics. I am <br/>
thinking of some carefully chosen snippets by writers familiar to mainstream <br/>
audiences such as Piaget or even Montessori.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is GREAT...thank you.  I would have never thought of doing this<br/>
because I am normally so irritated with her.  She&#39;s tried to manipulate<br/>
us since I met her 16 years ago.  I should say, she tries to manipulate<br/>
me because dh has not any real communication with her since he was 4 or<br/>
5...really.  He learned her tactics very early on, and he just shuts<br/>
down on her.   But I honestly believe(d) she was trying to better with<br/>
her grandkids.  I do know that she really does love them and is really<br/>
trying.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will do this, and I appreciate the advice.  I thought maybe I was<br/>
making a bigger deal out of it than I should because I sometimes think<br/>
with our history that I have a knee jerk reaction.   I realize this is<br/>
just her way to control things.<br/>
<br/>
I also realize that a conversation with her won&#39;t change her but it is<br/>
really about protecting my children and letting her know that I won&#39;t<br/>
stand by and let her try to manipulate them.<br/>

DH probably should have said something when she called him to tell him<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I took in audible gaspy breath  I  nearly choked on the grabbing his  <br/>
face thing.<br/>
<br/>
Partly, I think, because I have the relapse of a flu that causes  <br/>
weird dreams. In my whole life I&#39;ve never had a flu that caused  <br/>
dreams.  Fevers that caused dreams, yes, but this is interesting.   I  <br/>
called my husband this morning already to tell him.  I dreamed I  <br/>
slapped someone who&#39;s been ragging on me for most of 30 years.  Not  <br/>
my mother-in-law. &lt;g&gt;  A female former friend who&#39;s still in and  <br/>
around  my life and still occasionally makes a snarky comment.  I  <br/>
dreamed she came up to me, grabbed my arm to turn me around to face   <br/>
her (instead of speaking so I would know she was there) and that I  <br/>
slapped her.  I was holding something in my right hand and I slapped  <br/>
her with the left, and part of the dream was about feeling awful that  <br/>
I had done it, but thinking if I was going to slap her I should&#39;ve  <br/>
done it better, and thinking maybe backhanding her would&#39;ve been more  <br/>
efficient.<br/>
<br/>
WEIRD dream, for me.  I&#39;ve hardly ever slapped anyone even  jokingly  <br/>
(so I&#39;m not very good at it, which is probably best for everyone).<br/>
<br/>
When I read the top paragraph in Amy&#39;s post, I was thinking of Keith  <br/>
and his mom.  I feel exactly this way:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, I am rejecting the way she raised my<br/>
hubby (heck, I&#39;m angry about it...cause he is just wonderful!!)!! -=-<br/>
<br/>
Keith is THE BEST of his three brothers, but he was always treated  <br/>
like a baby, like a bad boy, disparaged.  When he wanted to go to  <br/>
medical school when he was 30 his mom laughed at him, so he didn&#39;t  <br/>
even apply.   He&#39;s responsible, kind, a great dad, and they don&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
Then with the vision of Keith and his mom in my mind I saw the bit  <br/>
about grabbing his face.  Eeek!  Keith&#39;s mom&#39;s about 5&#39;1 and Keith&#39;s  <br/>
6&#39;1&quot; and has a big beard.    Just the vision made me think of  <br/>
slapping someone AGAIN!  That thought twice in one day!?  I better  <br/>
stay home today and breathe. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

You might add that to your letter to her.  I would do an in-writing,  <br/>
printed out (or photocopy if you hand write it) paper letter.  KEEP A  <br/>
COPY,  maybe more than one.  Put them in your kids&#39; souvenir boxes. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The advantages of a copy are (at least) that you can review it to see  <br/>
if there&#39;s been progress over a few years, that you can&#39;t be  <br/>
misquoted without being able to defend yourself (like if another  <br/>
relative says &quot;I heard you said X,&quot; you can send them a copy), and  <br/>
she can read it twice, and again next year.<br/>

Mark (hubby) is also the BEST of 3 boys!!  Middle boy.  He is the<br/>
sweetest dad and hubby too and has always been very self reliant. <br/>
Started working as soon as he could so he could have freedom. I often<br/>
wonder if she resented that he never &quot;needed&quot; her.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling our kids has been such a refreshing way of life for<br/>
hubby.  I don&#39;t think he realized that a parent/child relationship could<br/>
be one of such love and respect.  Verses a life of control.<br/>

&gt; my mother-in-law. &lt;g&gt;  A female former friend who&#39;s still in and<br/>
&gt; around  my life and still occasionally makes a snarky comment.  I<br/>
&gt; dreamed she came up to me, grabbed my arm to turn me around to face<br/>
&gt; her (instead of speaking so I would know she was there) and that I<br/>
&gt; slapped her.  I was holding something in my right hand and I slapped<br/>
&gt; her with the left, and part of the dream was about feeling awful that<br/>
&gt; I had done it, but thinking if I was going to slap her I should&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; done it better, and thinking maybe backhanding her would&#39;ve been more<br/>
&gt; efficient.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WEIRD dream, for me.  I&#39;ve hardly ever slapped anyone even  jokingly<br/>
&gt; (so I&#39;m not very good at it, which is probably best for everyone).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I read the top paragraph in Amy&#39;s post, I was thinking of Keith<br/>
&gt; and his mom.  I feel exactly this way:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-Yes, I am rejecting the way she raised my<br/>
&gt; hubby (heck, I&#39;m angry about it...cause he is just wonderful!!)!! -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Then with the vision of Keith and his mom in my mind I saw the bit<br/>
&gt; about grabbing his face.  Eeek!  Keith&#39;s mom&#39;s about 5&#39;1 and Keith&#39;s<br/>
&gt; 6&#39;1&quot; and has a big beard.    Just the vision made me think of<br/>
&gt; slapping someone AGAIN!  That thought twice in one day!?  I better<br/>
&gt; stay home today and breathe. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-193976985">-=-But<br/>
in my dreams I&#39;m usually protecting myself or a loved one and I never<br/>
have the strength to even lift my arm up or actually swing. It probably<br/>
means something subconscious like I feel I&#39;m losing control or<br/>
something?????-=-<br/>
<br/>
In mine, the feeling was I shouldn&#39;t have done it at all, with a long  <br/>
overlying analysis through the rest of the dream that if I had done  <br/>
it at all I wish it had been a BIG one.<br/>
<br/>
The feeling was that I wish I had taken an extra part of a second to  <br/>
either plan a great slap (I&#39;m  not a very physical person) or to  <br/>
decide not to slap her at all.<br/>
