&gt;  I&#39;d like to know from people who began as homeschoolers and &quot;morphed&quot; into<br/>
&gt;  unschoolers: what was the toughest thing about changing?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Relaxing enough to trust that we will learn &#39;enough&#39;!  I&#39;m figuring out that <br/>
&quot;IT&quot; doesn&#39;t all have to be learned in 8 years or 12 years or 20 years.  <br/>
Whatever we don&#39;t cover while my children are in my care, they will learn on <br/>
their own in years to come.  I&#39;m still learning about the world around me and <br/>
have every reason to expect they will do the same.<br/>
<br/>
You said it yourself...the lessons your son remembers best involve his asking <br/>
lots of questions and getting lots of answers.  If you didn&#39;t know the <br/>
answer, you looked for them together.  Sounds perfect.<br/>
<br/>
The only basics I want to make certain we cover are reading and math.  <br/>
Especially the reading.  If he has the ability and desire to read, he can <br/>
find a resource and learn about anything that interests him.  I figure if he <br/>
has a good foundation in these two areas, he can find out anything else he <br/>
needs to learn when he needs it.  <br/>
<br/>
Math also stimulates music, logic, science, art and general thought processes <br/>
in addition to helping him figure out taxes, change at the store, or whatever <br/>
other math/numbers solutions he&#39;ll need in life.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as I&#39;m concerned, even more important than these &#39;disciplines&#39; are the <br/>
abilities to be compassionate, polite and considerate to other people while <br/>
being true to his own ideals.  My job is to help him find those ideals and <br/>
learn to put them into honest practice in his own life.<br/>
<br/>
The longer I practice at unschooling, the more excited I become about the <br/>
process!  It truly amazes me the things we discuss and learn when &#39;nothing&#39; <br/>
is going on.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, my unschooling experiences started with a stubborn teenager who refused <br/>
to cooperate with any formal schooling...at home or in a ps setting.  At that <br/>
point I figured my choices were to protect our relationship and wait for him <br/>
to become &#39;human&#39; again, while giving him opportunities to read, read, read <br/>
and explore areas that interested him, or I could beat the living daylights <br/>
out of him and &#39;force him to learn&#39;.  Let&#39;s just say it quickly became <br/>
obvious that &#39;forced learning&#39; was going to get us no where!  (and, just for <br/>
the record, I never did get around to the beatings!)  <br/>
<br/>
That started when he would have been in 9th grade (we removed him from ps <br/>
mid-8th grade because he had figured out how to be lazy and use the <br/>
system...wait until mom got a failing notice at mid-term, turn in all <br/>
homework, getting straight &#39;A&#39;s on everything for 3 weeks and never turn in <br/>
any work again  would get him a &#39;C&#39; grade.  He was satisfied with that.  It <br/>
meant he didn&#39;t have to repeat the class and that&#39;s all he cared about.  He <br/>
saw no reason to prove to the teacher that he knew the material nor any <br/>
reason to wait around for the rest of the class to catch up to information he <br/>
had down already.  <br/>
<br/>
I did not want to encourage a beat-the-system attitude, so we withdrew him <br/>
from school.  Well, that coupled with the fact that the school district and I <br/>
didn&#39;t see eye to eye on appropriate reasons for him to miss school...ie his <br/>
father worked out of town all week, home every other weekend and I wanted to <br/>
take the children to visit for a 3 day weekend.  The school disapproved and <br/>
refused to &#39;allow&#39; the absence which meant automatic failing marks on any <br/>
missed work and no opportunity to make it up or do it in advance.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think it&#39;s the school principal&#39;s place to decide my family&#39;s lifestyle or <br/>
what the needs of my children are.<br/>
<br/>
So, for several years, he read, asked questions and explored the world while <br/>
I felt I was neglecting his education but could find no way to convince him <br/>
that studying would be a good idea.  We tried to enroll him in the local <br/>
community college at age 16...he was excited and ready.  But, the cc insisted <br/>
we had to have a letter from the school district stating that he was released <br/>
from their education jurisdiction.  The school district refused to do any <br/>
such thing since he had never been under their umbrella.  So, we waited until <br/>
he was 18 and he enrolled in community classes, passing all the required <br/>
entrance/placement exams with no problems.  He took a couple of classes, just <br/>
for the heck of it, but still had some authority issues to work out.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, (age 19) he decided it was time to get married and he wanted to <br/>
be an electrician&#39;s apprentice.  That meant he had to get a GED.  Other than <br/>
the college classes where he would not crack a book, but would listen to the <br/>
lectures, he had done no formal training for several years...5, or so, I <br/>
think.  I strongly suggested he study before taking the GED test so he would <br/>
be prepared.  Again, he was not interested.  The end result...the stinker <br/>
passed with flying colors the first try with no advance preparation!<br/>
<br/>
That started me feeling a little more confident that unschooling would work.  <br/>
so, with our second child (10 years younger), I&#39;ve been much more relaxed and <br/>
he finds his way to subjects when he&#39;s ready or has a need.  Some areas it <br/>
would seem he is &#39;behind&#39; peers his age.  For instance, today was the first <br/>
day he felt confident to declare he was going to go ride his 2 wheel bike on <br/>
his own...he&#39;s 11 1/2.  Works for me.  He decided he was ready and set about <br/>
the struggle to get the job done.  Not at all coordinated about it yet, but <br/>
very pleased with himself.  I strongly suspect he&#39;ll be using his bike quite <br/>
a bit in the next few weeks and who knows what will happen from there. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH he has an inate ability to figure out math, science and logic without my <br/>
presenting the information to him in a formal way.  Out of the blue he will <br/>
tell me he has figured out such and so...After listening to some of his <br/>
theories and what led to his conclusions, I may give him the formal name of <br/>
what it is he&#39;s telling me and we talk about it, learning as we go.  It is <br/>
usually on the algebra, geography, physics or science level.  Sometimes he&#39;s <br/>
on the right track, sometimes not.  But by listening to his theories first, <br/>
he&#39;s ready to listen to what I have to say.  When I point out that we are <br/>
discussing subjects that I didn&#39;t learn about until college, he feels quite <br/>
pleased with himself.  It is very stimulating to both of us.<br/>
<br/>
Another big factor to our using an unschooling approach (and another reason <br/>
for us to avoid ps) is my health.  I have a rather dibilating case of <br/>
fibromyalgia.  Many days are pretty bad.  It&#39;s not like I need him to take <br/>
care of me, but if I had to stick to a ps schedule and their requirements, it <br/>
would be very bad on my health.  I simply do not know from day to day how I <br/>
will be feeling.  It is VERY difficult for me to make a commitment to an <br/>
appointment and be confident I can keep it.  Takes days of advance planning <br/>
and reserving my energy when I know I have something coming up that I MUST <br/>
do.  So, on good days we do things together, on poor days I help him <br/>
self-direct his energies.  We couldn&#39;t do that with a ps experience.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a bit of my experiences.  Hope it helps a little.  As I see it each <br/>
family has a different path and different things work for them.   There are <br/>
lots of inspiring stories of families out and about doing things every day or <br/>
several times a week, learning as they go.  I&#39;m jealous of the $$, time and <br/>
energy they have to be able to do that.  But, no sense dwelling on what <br/>
someone else is doing.  This is working very well for us.  The hard part can <br/>
be trying to explain it to others who are really wary or concerned that I&#39;m <br/>
neglecting his education.  Especially my SIL who is a city cop AND on the <br/>
school board.  Basically I simply tell them we evaluate him on a regular <br/>
basis and he is making satisfactory/excellent progress.  That sort of phrase <br/>
seems to be enough of a techno-phrase to satisfy most people.  (except my <br/>
mother, but that&#39;s another story!)  <br/>
<br/>
He always has a thick book in his hand and his nose in it; doesn&#39;t sit still <br/>
and do nothing for any length of time at all.  He may be watching TV or <br/>
playing &#39;tendo or &#39;playing&#39; &#39;puter games, or jumping ont he trampoline or <br/>
wrestling with his dad or cousins, but then there is lots of discussion about <br/>
what has happened.  (he&#39;s very verbal!)  Which leads to more discussion.  <br/>
He&#39;s learning to train the dogs, which leads to learning about pack behavior <br/>
and other animal charactistics which leads to environmental awareness, <br/>
ecogoly, weather patterns/systems, astronomy, you name it.  It&#39;s a cycle we <br/>
simply cannot avoid.  Good thing, I suppose...BG  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I try to do is keep up with what he is reading.  He reads on a <br/>
college level, which sometimes leaves him interested in books I don&#39;t think <br/>
he&#39;s quite ready for.  OTOH sometimes he is reading adult level books I can&#39;t <br/>
comprehend and he understands profoundly!  LOL  I learn along the way and it <br/>
helps me stay in touch with his interests as well.<br/>
<br/>

This is my whole schtick with my husband.  He gets nervous about our 7 yob<br/>
not doing busy work.  He likes to see proof, but just the other day I heard<br/>
him talking to his mom (she&#39;s been against us from the start but is too<br/>
polite to lecture us. She hides her disagreement in the form of questions<br/>
&quot;So, how&#39;s Seamus doing? What did he do today? Have you started _______(fill<br/>
in blank)yet?&quot;) My husband told his mom &quot;Oh we&#39;re going to teach him the<br/>
basics, and he&#39;ll have the tools he needs to learn independently. Then we&#39;ll<br/>
just encourage him when he needs it.&quot;. I felt really happy to hear my<br/>
husband &quot;preaching&quot; about this. Pretty cool. :-)<br/>

<br/>
This is so true.  Children are being sent to school at younger and younger<br/>
ages, before they even know what family means, before they even know who<br/>
they are.  If I could change only one thing about compulsory education, I<br/>
would change the age children are required to begin school from 6 or 7 to 12<br/>
or 13. Then they would have a better chance at figuring out who *they are*<br/>
before the system decides for them.<br/>

<br/>
Agreed-this is a huge motivator for me. I love that feeling I get when my<br/>
son, Seamus, and I are talking about a subject (we don&#39;t even discuss-we<br/>
just gab ;-) and I see that little lightbulb click on over his head-then he<br/>
starts yakking nonstop about it and I am quickly overwhelmed. I can<br/>
practically see the grey matter in his head making new folds-the neuro<br/>
transmitters lighting up like holiday lights or the 4th of July.<br/>
<br/>
When you shared this about your son:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;...we removed him from ps mid-8th grade because he had figured out how to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>be lazy and use the<br/>

<br/>
--I knew you have sharp witted and insightful young man on your hands.<br/>
Learning to consciously &quot;work the system&quot; at this early age is a great<br/>
indicator of a depth of intelligence and personality.  A lot of folks don&#39;t<br/>
learn this useful skill until they are forced to due to misfortune. Don&#39;t<br/>
worry about encouraging the &quot;beat-the-system&quot; attitude-it&#39;s a necessity of<br/>
life to know how to get what you need when you need it.  Having this skill<br/>
before being faced with a crisis is invaluable.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for telling us about your experiences-it does really help. My 3 month<br/>
old is HUNGRY, or I would swap stories right now. What you wrote is very<br/>
encouraging. Thanks!<br/>
