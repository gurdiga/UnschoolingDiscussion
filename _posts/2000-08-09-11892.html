<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254416198">Tamie, <br/>
Don&#39;t beat yourself up. I quit for 25 months, and I thought I was doing<br/>
great.  Then the many stresses got to me and I started again.<br/>
Gum is good, but so is staying busy. Go to places where smoking is not<br/>
allowed. Throw out all the ashtrays and lighters, they just remind you<br/>
of smoking, and ban smoking from your house, car, etc.  Make it really<br/>
hard for you to enjoy smoking during your last days until your quit day.<br/>
Best of luck to ya,  Susan</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034792732">That&#39;s a tough one for me, Jennifer.  I grew up around smoking all my life<br/>
and I would venture to guess that about 1/3 of the kids that grew up with me<br/>
did start smoking at some point.  I would venture to say that it may be a an<br/>
dependency issue, after the initial &quot;being cool&quot; thing.  Maybe similar to<br/>
one&#39;s dependency on aspirin, anti-depressants, curricula, etc...  I haven&#39;t<br/>
done much research on it so I&#39;m just putting out random thoughts here. <br/>
Maybe help them see it in the perspective of a person being dependent on an<br/>
external something that becomes such a part of a person&#39;s life that it is<br/>
hard to see anything different, until the person has positive internal<br/>
reasons to change.  Some people I know tell their kids that people who smoke<br/>
are bad.  From what I&#39;ve seen it throws guilt and shame out there so much to<br/>
the point it impossible for a person to have the desire to quit.  Kinda like<br/>
forcing anything on anybody who is not ready...it makes it impossible.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was good (to give yourself time, I mean)!<br/>
<br/>
As far as what to do about it, I think you really have to be honest with <br/>
them and speak to them as you might someone who is not aware of something <br/>
but who needs your help to see all sides of the issue.  You can tell them <br/>
exactly why smoking is a poor choice to make, and that their dad made a <br/>
real poor choice.  You can tell them that cigarettes are manufactured by <br/>
corporations that profit greatly from people getting addicted to cigarettes <br/>
and then find themselves unable to stop, and that the corporations know <br/>
about it and don&#39;t care.  You can also tell them that many people (maybe <br/>
most?) start smoking when they&#39;re young and impressionable because there is <br/>
this &#39;coolness&#39; attached to smoking in our pop culture, but they soon grow <br/>
to regret it when they try to quit but are not able to.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would also tell my son that there are certain things that he may <br/>
do that I might not want him to do, and that I really cannot stop <br/>
him.  But, I would tell him (and I have told him, in fact) that he is the <br/>
one to make choices for himself and for his own reasons, and I will not <br/>
judge him on this. We all make our own choices for ourselves.  I would hope <br/>
that he would base his choices on what *he* wants for himself as opposed to <br/>
pressure exerted on him from others, but he should know that I will be open <br/>
to him and ready to help him, if he needs me to, in whatever way he wants <br/>
me to.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s because my greatest concern is not that he&#39;ll try different <br/>
things, but that he&#39;ll go underground about it and then I won&#39;t be able to <br/>
help him if he would need it.  He may want to try smoking (but I doubt it <br/>
&#39;cause I&#39;ve given him a lot of bad press about it, and he&#39;s not at all <br/>
impressed with people who smoke), and then he may decide that it&#39;s <br/>
disgusting and stop.  But, I told him my story, which was that I started <br/>
smoking at the age of 13 because all my friends smoked and I wanted to be <br/>
cool and included.  I told him how I had to smoke a whole pack of <br/>
cigarettes one night to get past the dizziness and nausea and that it was <br/>
really disgusting.  And then, I told him that I got addicted and had a real <br/>
hard time quitting.  But, I was able to quit because I had a real good <br/>
reason to.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the thing I&#39;m trying to bring out in this is that I think it&#39;s <br/>
important that you be completely honest with your kids about this. If you <br/>
are speaking your truth, *that* will be your peaceful solution.  I believe <br/>
they will respond to it because it will come from that powerful place that <br/>
is not manipulative but forthright.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mamma&#39;s Day. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  One of the things I do to give smoking bad press is to point out <br/>
stuff when I see it.  For instance, we have a friend who is a heavy smoker <br/>
(a few, in fact), and he has that unfortunate smoker&#39;s cough/laugh, if you <br/>
know what I mean. It always breaks my heart when I hear that, but Liam <br/>
knows what that is and why. <br/>

smoke are bad people.  I think that&#39;s a bit over the top.  I can agree that <br/>
it&#39;s a bad habit...and yes, I think it does start out as a curiosity, cool <br/>
thing to try, something to impress your friends, etc. but it becomes a habit <br/>
so easily.  If this were drugs, it would be so much easier for me to talk <br/>
with them about it.  I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good or bad thing!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I cringe now when I think about how my christian school <br/>
upbringing caused me at age 5 to tell my grandfather repeatedly that <br/>
he was going to go to hell for smoking cigarettes.  What actually <br/>
bothers me more is that my mom never stepped in to knock some sense <br/>
into me.<br/>
<br/>
What I have told my daughter about the whole smoking issue (she is <br/>
six, and we had these discussions over a year ago) is that smoking is <br/>
similar to many other things in life in that too much of it is bad <br/>
for you.  (Now don&#39;t attack me here, I know even a little smoking is <br/>
bad for your lungs, but my goal is to de-mystify it.)  Too much <br/>
sugary food is not good, too many carrots or too much water can make <br/>
you seriously ill.  I am trying to get her to understand moderation.  <br/>
It is kind of like lifting restrictions on food and not <br/>
placing &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; labels on things.  <br/>
<br/>
She spent several weeks questioning me off an on about smoking, and <br/>
at first she thought only men smoke.  (Not many people in our lives <br/>
smoke...not by choice, just by chance, but the ones who do are men.)  <br/>
So I started pointing out women who smoke.  I just want her to see <br/>
life as it really is.  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, one day she told me that when she grows up, she wants to <br/>
drive a motorcycle and smoke one cigarette a day.  I said, &quot;Sounds <br/>
cool.  Will you take me for a ride on your motorcycle?&quot;  She <br/>
said, &quot;Sure!&quot;  I have heard no mention of cigarettes since. :-)<br/>

<br/>
See, this really hits home with me.  I&#39;m very torn as to how I feel about <br/>
fully allowing them the freedom to make their own choices and standing <br/>
behind their decisions.  That sounds awful, I know.  It&#39;s so much easier <br/>
when they are young and dangerous things aren&#39;t so much of an <br/>
issue...smoking, drugs, std&#39;s, just to rattle off a few.  Now, if they were <br/>
16, maybe I might be more inclined to want them to make their own decisions. <br/>
  It just seems like these things are more difficult for them to understand. <br/>
  (I hope I&#39;m getting this across as I intend.)<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of giving them information.  Insight and examples of *why* <br/>
smoking is harmful, explore their reasons as to why they wanted to try it <br/>
and then talk about other things they could have done to satisfy those <br/>
reasons, *without* smoking.  Don&#39;t get me wrong, they weren&#39;t sitting around <br/>
puffing away like chimney&#39;s or anything.  As far as I know, they all just <br/>
tried one puff or so.  I don&#39;t want to make it a huge to-do but I don&#39;t want <br/>
it to pass by unnoticed either.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m working on it.  Trying to sort out all the crap in my head about <br/>
kids being too young to make well informed decisions, etc.  It seems easier <br/>
with my 12 year old, but my 6 yr old is the one I&#39;m really struggling with.  <br/>
I&#39;m actually glad this happened late in the evening, so it didn&#39;t have to <br/>
loom over us like a black cloud all day.  LOL...just caught the pun in that. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wish I&#39;d had all this worked out BEFORE it happened! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

Don&#39;t you wish everything were that easy!  Sounds like you handled it <br/>
beautifully!  Now to turn the tables....<br/>
<br/>
What if she had said, &quot;I want to smoke one cigarette a day, NOW, at 6??&quot;  <br/>
What would you say to that??  Nicholette is 6 and knowing her, she&#39;d focus <br/>
on the moderation so much that she&#39;d think I was giving her permission to <br/>
smoke now!  Ugh!  It&#39;s easier with Haleigh.  She has asthma, so the reality <br/>
of the damage smoking would cause her is much more vivid and real.  But that <br/>
Nicholette is one tough cookie.  She challenges everything I say!  So, I&#39;m <br/>
going to have to come up with something very convincing for her.  I&#39;m not <br/>
trying to turn this into a bunch of what-ifs, I&#39;m just really nervous and <br/>
unsure how to approach this with Nic.  I&#39;d love to hear what you think!<br/>

I would stress the fact that you&#39;re very glad they were honest with you<br/>
about it (albeit after the fact).  When things like this happen I want my<br/>
kids to leave our conversation knowing that our relationship is more<br/>
important to me than any &#39;thing&#39; they do, and that being truthful with each<br/>
other is the only way for us to really know and love each other.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As for what else to say, I&#39;d just tell them truthfully how you feel about<br/>
smoking, and why.  I would talk to them individually, since the situation is<br/>
different for each one of them.  I&#39;d also talk to them about what they could<br/>
do next time they find themselves in a similar situation.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to point out the message of &quot;catch&quot;! (Even though you <br/>
didn&#39;t say it. &lt;yeay&gt;) When &quot;catch&quot; is used, it&#39;s a totally different message <br/>
than &quot;don&#39;t do it&quot; (neither is a good choice BTW). &quot;Catch&quot; moves away from <br/>
the actual issues, and is almost saying it&#39;s ok to do it so long as you&#39;re <br/>
not caught. (That&#39;s not the case, right?) It also means &quot;hide things from me <br/>
that you know I don&#39;t like&quot;. (That&#39;s also not the case right?) Therefore, <br/>
closing the door on it, while they&#39;re possibility off doing it, and keeping <br/>
it hidden from you as instructed. &quot;Don&#39;t do it&quot;, though by itself is not a <br/>
good choice either, it at least is about the issue, and you can keep talking <br/>
about it from there. Does that make sense? <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it seems like you handled it fine. I&#39;d just echo the other posts, in <br/>
that don&#39;t hold back with the info. I have not with my kids, and in fact have <br/>
treated cigarettes no different from other drugs when talking about it with <br/>
them. Is does make it hard to say it all, and then your dh still smokes! <br/>
(Partly why I quit!) Maybe it&#39;s a good lesson to them on the hold (addiction) <br/>
that it has. I think what HE says to them might be even more important then <br/>
you, since he&#39;s the one smoking! (As in he can say it&#39;s bad and why, and also <br/>
say why he still does it anyway.)    Lara.......</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well I guess I am lucky because my daughter (very much UNlike me) is <br/>
a rule follower.  She wants to know what the rules are, and once she <br/>
knows, she is cool with it.  So if she were to ask to smoke NOW, I <br/>
would tell her that it is against the law to smoke until you are 18.  <br/>
(Or maybe the law is actually that you just can&#39;t BUY them until you <br/>
are 18, but for now, it is close enough to reality for her.)  So she <br/>
would probably just settle it in her mind that she will think about <br/>
it again when she is 18.<br/>
<br/>
But that would not have been how I would have reacted as a kid.  But <br/>
in fact, for as wrong as I was led to believe smoking was, I still <br/>
jumped at the chance to do it when I was about 12 or 13.  (But much <br/>
rebellion had occured during those years, mainly due to my <br/>
realization that I had been taught a bunch of crap from a bunch of <br/>
hypocrites, and that I wanted to be nothing like them.  If smoking is <br/>
bad, then by golly that is what I am going to do.)<br/>
<br/>
But I digress...I guess if she were truly hell-bent on smoking at 6, <br/>
even if I told her about the law, hmm....would I just let her smoke <br/>
one?  Not a puff, the whole thing?  Is that horrible?  I don&#39;t really <br/>
think she would like it.  I have let her try my alcoholic drinks <br/>
before, and she really doesn&#39;t much like them except the dacquari&#39;s, <br/>
but only the ones that have so little alcohol they really couldn&#39;t do <br/>
much to her.  For as much as I know smoking is bad for you, I also <br/>
know that the &quot;coolness&quot; of the forbidden fruit can lead to much <br/>
worse.  <br/>
<br/>
So really, that is probably what I would do.  Let her smoke one a <br/>
day, and count on the fact that it would not last long.  But of <br/>
course, I would teach her HOW to smoke it the RIGHT way...you know, <br/>
really inhaling, not just suck in--blow out. (Cough, hack, cough, <br/>
gasp.)  I just can&#39;t believe she would think it was that great.  And <br/>
I would think at the younger age, she would be less inclined to <br/>
disregard the bad (cough hack) for the &quot;good&quot; (coolness.)<br/>
<br/>
But I also don&#39;t have an older child to worry about.  But the thing <br/>
is, all you can do (or should do, if they are anything like I was) is <br/>
tell them the truth about what it does to you and why you wish they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t do it.  If Haleigh is determined to do it, the more <br/>
negativity from you, the more she will just be inclined to do it away <br/>
from home, or at least not let the younger ones in on it.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to even post this, because I am certainly not telling you <br/>
that you ought to do what I THINK I would do in the situation.  These <br/>
are just my first thoughts, and my first inclinations as to what I <br/>
would do based on my knowledge of my daughter.  Sorry to have <br/>
rambled.  This is just a pretty tough one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-176089167">I want to add to my previous post another reason I feel like I would <br/>
go in the direction I said.  As mentioned, I started smoking when I <br/>
was 12 or 13, just one or two here and there when someone offered <br/>
them.  On through junior high I would smoke one or two a morning <br/>
before school.  Once in high school, I just didn&#39;t really smoke much <br/>
even though I hung out with people who did.  <br/>
<br/>
As an adult, I started smoking at a job that I had, mainly to pass <br/>
time.  (It was in a bar, so I could smoke all night.)  Plus I liked <br/>
the little buzz I got because I didn&#39;t smoke them regularly.  But <br/>
once it got to where I was smoking 4 a night (during a 5 or 6 hour <br/>
time-span) I decided that I didn&#39;t want it to become a habit, so I <br/>
just stopped.  Once in a while I will smoke again, but only maybe 4 a <br/>
week at most.  (I don&#39;t do it in front of my daughter, strangely <br/>
enough not so much because I am worried about her seeing me, but more <br/>
worried that she would mention it in passing to my <br/>
parents...hmmm...still some issues there, huh?)<br/>
<br/>
So I have never had a problem with addiction (to cigarettes or any of <br/>
the drugs I have messed around with in the past.)  If I had, then I <br/>
would most likely have a stronger desire to keep her from doing it.  <br/>

Funny you mention it because I did ask if it made them cough.  Guess they <br/>
didn;t inhale because all the smoke was getting in their eyes and coming out <br/>
their noses.  (Don&#39;t you wish you could be there for moments like that?)  I <br/>
hadn&#39;t even thought of the law thing...DUH!  Strangly enough, I think that <br/>
alone would deter Nicholette from doing it.  (I once got pulled over for a <br/>
ticket I fogot about and took a not so nice little trip to jail.  Scared the <br/>
hell out of her.)<br/>
<br/>
I was a little hesitant to post on this because of my internal conflicts.  <br/>
What I initially think is rarely ever what I do because I still haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten over what I hear my family saying in my head.  I did *catch* that in <br/>
my head talk earlier.  That&#39;s where I was headed by saying that here.  That <br/>
I do have those conflicts.  One on my shoulder telling me to do what <br/>
&#39;everyone&#39; else would do (mainstreamish stuff), and one on the other <br/>
shoulder telling me I know there has to be a better way.<br/>

Jayn (3) told us that she wanted to be grown up so she could smoke like<br/>
our neighbor, who she loves. Uggh! Not that the neighbor smokes while<br/>
Jayn is visiting with her, but she has seen her smoking. We told Jayn<br/>
that Jackie wants to stop because it is making her sick (she is trying<br/>

I really have no good advice.  One thought I did have was when <br/>
someone mentioned discussing the companies who make all the money off <br/>
this stuff.  Rent &quot;The Insider&quot; with Russel Crowe (a movie about the <br/>
man who testified agaist the drug companies) for you and your oldest <br/>
and maybe hubby??  Pretty scary stuff in terms of control and such.  <br/>
It might change her perspective and maybe that will trickle down to <br/>
Nicolette.  That way you are not saying it is bad as much as showing <br/>
them the behind the scenes information about cigarettes, the <br/>
unglamourous side.  Good luck!<br/>

My Aunt once gave her daughter a pack and had her sit there and smoke them. <br/>
This was like 20 years ago.  She got through the first 2 and threw up, she<br/>
never touched another cigarette.. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you should do that..lol.  She may not try it anymore now, she<br/>
may.  Maybe you could say well, I wouldn&#39;t let you eat dog poop and get sick<br/>
 why would I let you smoke a cigarette and get sick...<br/>
<br/>
Nic sounds alot like my Kayla.  She used to challenge everything.. now she&#39;s<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;So anyway, one day she told me that when she grows up, she wants to<br/>
drive a motorcycle and smoke one cigarette a day. I said, &quot;Sounds<br/>
cool. Will you take me for a ride on your motorcycle?&quot; She<br/>
said, &quot;Sure!&quot; I have heard no mention of cigarettes since. :-)&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Tory,<br/>
 <br/>
Don&#39;t you wish everything were that easy! Sounds like you handled it <br/>
beautifully! Now to turn the tables....<br/>
 <br/>
What if she had said, &quot;I want to smoke one cigarette a day, NOW, at 6??&quot; <br/>
What would you say to that?? Nicholette is 6 and knowing her, she&#39;d focus <br/>
on the moderation so much that she&#39;d think I was giving her permission to <br/>
smoke now! Ugh! It&#39;s easier with Haleigh. She has asthma, so the reality <br/>
of the damage smoking would cause her is much more vivid and real. But that <br/>
Nicholette is one tough cookie. She challenges everything I say! So, I&#39;m <br/>
going to have to come up with something very convincing for her. I&#39;m not <br/>
trying to turn this into a bunch of what-ifs, I&#39;m just really nervous and <br/>
unsure how to approach this with Nic. I&#39;d love to hear what you think!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333875546">Interesting when our philosophies are tested sometimes, huh?  As far as the smoking, do you<br/>
really think that your 6 yo would really like smoking? I can&#39;t really imagine that. I was<br/>
a social smoker in college (only occasionally when I had been drinking...we smoked menthols<br/>
LOL!) Part of the appeal was doing something &quot;bad&quot;. I have to say that I did not like waking<br/>
up with smoke breath in the morning. I just can not see what a 6 yo would see as appealing<br/>
in smoking...it tastes yucky, makes you cough and smell bad. Kind of scary to think about<br/>
trying out that theory though, huh? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about something similar. My 6 yo seems occasionally curious about <br/>
alcohol. It has been mentioned in some books we have read and we do occasionally have<br/>
a drink with dinner or in the evening. We have had talks about how it makes people <br/>
act different and affects your judgment but that some people like to use it to relax. <br/>
He has had sips of beer and did not like it. But he did try some of my Mike&#39;s Hard <br/>
Lemonade and loved it. Asked for some the next day (we did not have any so I did not <br/>
have to figure out what to say). But it got me thinking...would I really let my 6 yo <br/>
drink a whole bottle? Would I let him get drunk? I would be comfortable letting older <br/>
kids (maybe older then 10 not sure why that age, but that is what comes to mind??) have <br/>
some, but 6? But then I would worry about making it too attractive by saying no.<br/>
Would a 6 yo like getting drunk? Would it be ok if he did? Or would it scare him? Still <br/>
working on this one. For now, I just don&#39;t drink Mike&#39;s around him. It is not like <br/>
we drink that much even so it is not a big deal, but still interesting to ponder. Of course <br/>
my 3 yo really liked his sip of beer (and really likes his rescue remedy (which has an <br/>
alcohol base)) so we will have to see where that one goes!<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing is that a month or so ago, Jason found shockwave.com. They have<br/>
some really neat games there, but they also have some realistic shooting games. This<br/>
was his first intro to these type of games. He found one that I really did not like<br/>
but I did not say no. In fact I was getting ready to post a question here about how<br/>
to approach it (I was not going to say he could not play it but wanted to try to <br/>
figure out how to explain to him what I did not like about it - it was one of those<br/>
games where you are behind the gun and go around shooting people who start spurting<br/>
blood). But before I could post, I realized that he had stopped playing it. I think<br/>
that he only played it a couple of times and has not been interested since....makes<br/>
you think....<br/>

YES!!  That&#39;s the thing!  She tried it and wants to do it again.  No, I <br/>
don&#39;t particulary think she would like it, but I don&#39;t feel confident that <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t want to continue for all the glorious (hack hack) <br/>

make points here and there but because *I* still haven&#39;t figured out my <br/>

<br/>
What if it were sex at say 8?<br/>
<br/>
I remember my oldest daughter having an intrigue for cigarettes when she was <br/>
five/six.  My DH, nor I smoked but her Aunts, Uncles and Grandparents did.  <br/>
We did discuss how they smell bad, cost a lot of money, and make people sick <br/>
and sometimes even die from it.<br/>
<br/>
When she asked me if she could smoke, I told her &quot;not today, maybe tomorrow&quot;, <br/>
when she would ask the next day &quot;is it tomorrow yet? can I smoke now?&quot;  I <br/>
would just tell her it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your smoking tomorrow.  She <br/>
soon grew tired of that conversation and took to &quot;smoking&quot; crayons.  Of <br/>
course it was awkward sometimes for her to reach in her little purse and pull <br/>
out a crayon and start puffing on it and tapping off the &quot;ashes&quot;.  But that <br/>
got us through.<br/>
<br/>
I also have to add that we were not homeschooling at the time so this is from <br/>
the perspective of a schooled child, but a child interested in smoking.<br/>
<br/>
This child is now 23, doesn&#39;t smoke, says she did smoke a couple times in <br/>
college but she can&#39;t stand the smell and she doesn&#39;t allow smoking in her <br/>
home, they have to go outside!<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck with your daughter, sometimes we just feel our way through it.<br/>

Do you know of any 8 year olds who want to have sex?<br/>
There are adults who want to have sex with 8 year olds.  THAT is &quot;a grown up <br/>

A teenager is grown in many ways.  Some people in their 40s aren&#39;t &quot;grown&quot; in <br/>
many ways.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be 18 or 21 that was time for someone to decide to smoke?<br/>
<br/>
The problem with saying &quot;It&#39;s a grown up thing&quot; is this:  If a child is <br/>
waiting impatiently to be grown and some things are declared &quot;only for <br/>
grownups,&quot; then the child will WANT them and count the years, the months, <br/>
until he says &quot;To hell with it,&quot; and adopts them all to prove he&#39;s grown.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re described as things only weak-willed people do, or wastes of <br/>
money, energy and health used as psychological crutches by some people, or as <br/>
things some people do to try to prove they&#39;re grown instead of just being <br/>
mature, then they won&#39;t be as desirable as they might be if they&#39;re called <br/>
&quot;grown up things.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
&lt;That would irritate the heck out of me.  Wouldn&#39;t it you?&gt;<br/>
If it would have bothered her I would have thought of something else.  Every <br/>
time she asked and I said, &quot;well maybe tomorrow&quot;, she seemed perfectly <br/>
satisfied with that answer.  Never once showed any frustration or being at <br/>
all bothered by it, just shrugged and decided to play something else.  Not <br/>
having any cigarettes around probably made it less appealing or at least in <br/>
her thoughts less, until she went to her grandparents anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;The problem with saying &quot;It&#39;s a grown up thing&quot; is this:  If a child is <br/>

until he says &quot;To hell with it,&quot; and adopts them all to prove he&#39;s grown.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That probably would have been true if this were an issue that carried over <br/>
for months or years but it was a passing thing and after I guess a week or <br/>
two she no longer asked if she could smoke and she probably forgot all about <br/>
it and the allure of waiting to be &quot;grown&quot; to smoke.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;If they&#39;re described as things only weak-willed people do, or wastes of <br/>
money, energy and health used as psychological crutches by some people, or as <br/>
<br/>
things some people do to try to prove they&#39;re grown instead of just being <br/>
mature, then they won&#39;t be as desirable as they might be if they&#39;re called <br/>
&quot;grown up things.&quot;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I told her how smelly they were, how expensive they were (wouldn&#39;t she rather <br/>
have candy or something fun?) and how they made people sick and sometimes <br/>
die.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess it how we handled it was successful, she didn&#39;t smoke as a teen, <br/>
never asked, but then my kids didn&#39;t really ask permission to do things, we <br/>
just talked about their plans, doesn&#39;t smoke now as an adult in her own <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
If it was something that was really really important to her that she kept <br/>
asking about for a very long time, I think it would probably have had to be <br/>
looked at differently but it was just a passing thought for a minute of time <br/>
for her.<br/>

Certainly not in any kind of defense or anything, but quite a few school<br/>
children are having sex of some sort in the 4th and 5th grade. By 6th grade,<br/>
quite a few have had sex already. I tend to think that not all those kids<br/>
have been sexually abused. I know a girl now that is pregnant. She&#39;s 12. I<br/>
know this has nothing to do with unschooling and how we parent our children,<br/>
and totally different circumstances, but not all sexual abuse either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398084528">**Is there anything wrong with designating something&#39;s as &quot;grown up&quot; things <br/>
and<br/>
telling them when they are grown up they are free to make those <br/>
decisions?***<br/>
<br/>
You know, I&#39;ve atually been having a bit of an internal struggle with this.  <br/>
Especially after reading other people&#39;s comments.  The topic hasn&#39;t come up <br/>
again, but my husband and I were talking about it and decided neither of us <br/>
are comfortable allowing our kids to smoke.  We&#39;re just trying to find a way <br/>
to talk about it without making it a &#39;forbidden fruit&#39;.  Hopefully, we can <br/>
figure it out befor it comes up again. :)<br/>
<br/>
***What if it were sex at say 8?***<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we have already been through this, sort of.  None of the kids have <br/>
mentioned an interest in sex, as far as actually having it anyway, but we <br/>
have always talked about sex in our home.  From the beginning, we explained <br/>
it as a loving act between adults that love, respect and consent to one <br/>
another, although not in such stuffy language. ;)  Nicholette is my only <br/>
child that ever brings it up but she does tell me she can&#39;t wait to be a <br/>
grown up so she can have sex and get a baby girl in her tummy with pink <br/>
ribbons in her hair. LOL  We smile and tell her somehwere, there is a little <br/>
boy growing up just like her who wants to be her babies&#39; Daddy when HE&#39;S <br/>
grown up and we can&#39;t wait to meet him.  (She loves that one. &lt;bg&gt;)  So <br/>
that&#39;s actually been pretty simple.<br/>
<br/>
***When she asked me if she could smoke, I told her &quot;not today, maybe <br/>
tomorrow&quot;,<br/>
when she would ask the next day &quot;is it tomorrow yet? can I smoke now?&quot;  I<br/>
would just tell her it&#39;s today, we&#39;ll talk about your smoking tomorrow.  She<br/>
soon grew tired of that conversation and took to &quot;smoking&quot; crayons. <br/>
&lt;snip&gt;***<br/>
<br/>
The only problem with this, for me, would be that my kids would be very mad <br/>
at me for lying to them and I wouln&#39;t blame them.  They are aware of what <br/>
tomorrow means and I wouldn&#39;t want to do anything to break the trust we <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
***Best of luck with your daughter, sometimes we just feel our way through <br/>
it.***<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, I think I made it a much bigger deal than it really was.  I said my <br/>
little bit of calm peace and it went away.  I think that worked out to be <br/>
the best for us.  I&#39; sure a lot of it had to do with the fact that I told <br/>
them I&#39;d needed time to think about it and we would talk tomorrow.  (The day <br/>
after it happened.)  My kids are very in tune with me and know that I&#39;m very <br/>
serious if I say that.  I think that got the point across more than anything <br/>
else I said.<br/>

grade will certainly make you glad you homeschool/unschool your child for yet <br/>
another reason.<br/>
<br/>
Some children are abused no doubt but there are some that come to sexuality <br/>
early too.  Maybe that is a form of abuse in of itself?  From neglect?  <br/>
Exposure to things?  I&#39;m not certain but I do know that it&#39;s very sad that <br/>
such very young children try to incorporate such very complex things into <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s probably a combination and also other stuff too. Low self<br/>
esteem, emormous pressure from peers and also society to hurry and grow up.<br/>
Neglect from parents, not meaning food and shelter type but lack of respect<br/>
and even interest.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I do notice quite often is how much homeschoolers seem to act like<br/>
kids more than school kids do. They seem to not be in such of a hurry to<br/>
grow up and enjoy being younger. I have also noticed that homeschool kids<br/>
that do hang around with mostly school kids don&#39;t have this quality as much.<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about seeming older and more respectful, I&#39;m speaking of<br/>
just having fun doing kid stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who homeschools and now wants to unschool because she thinks<br/>
it just means she doesn&#39;t have to do anything. She doesn&#39;t do anything with<br/>
homeschool groups with her kids. Her children mostly spend all their days<br/>
with school children running around the neighborhood. As much as you can<br/>
usually pick out homeschool children, you would think hers were public<br/>
school kids in a heartbeat.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
My kids mostly hang out with public schooled kids.  And yes, they resemble public school kids in the sense that they dress and talk like public schooled kids do. <br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of homeschool groups out here...its a strong homeschool area.  But of all those homeschoolers, very few of them make themselves available just to &quot;hang out&quot;.  There always too busy doing &quot;schoolwork&quot; or being punished because they &quot;didin&#39;t get their schoolwork done&quot; or whatever the kids do togehter had to be worthy enough to be &quot;counted as school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were feeling bored and lonely because there was nobody to hang out with when I was leary about the ps kids.  And when we did hang out with hsers, we always had to be &quot;careful&quot; what we said and how we acted, even in our own home.<br/>
<br/>
Well, since we&#39;ve given up on the homeschoolers and hang out with the psers, my kids are VERY happy and so am I.  My house is overrun with kids, rough language and all, but they are here, they are having fun and I enjoy their company.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree that they don&#39;t like to do fun stuff.  They like to do &quot;cool&quot; stuff.  What &quot;fun&quot; stuff are you referring to?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496128093">Oh I see what you are talking about. I guess that just hasn&#39;t been my experience.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if its not necessarily the schools, but whether they feel safe to *be* kids wherever they happen to be.<br/>
<br/>
I have to confess that my 7-8 year old LOVES to play house and plays babies.  And she will play barbies sometimes, but she prefers brat dolls instead.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old definitely does look and act older than she is but she also has her moments of cuddle time with mom, and just talking and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
They *all* (psers too) play tag in the yard...and this is a cute one:  they all got the old play kitchen out last summer and ALL of them played restaurant, even those who were 13 and 14 at the time.<br/>
<br/>
So, maybe its not so much the kids or the schools, but the environment they are in at the moment, or the example of the adults in the environment.  I know my best friend runs a rec program in a nearby town, and almost all of the kids are psers.  But they all come voluntarily to this program, and suddenly all cliques from school disappear and they play ball, and make crafts, and mix crowds.  VERY often the kids tell her that although they really *like* a certain friend, it is not possible for them to be friends outside of the rec program, (in school).<br/>
<br/>
My house has evolved into a kind of rec program like that.  Everyone comes over and they play games or play on the computer or watch tv or whatever.  The ps friends ask me to play chess with them.  And they go outside at night and they all play &quot;flashlight&quot; hide and seek in the summers.  Everyone sleds here too, or builds snow stuff.<br/>
<br/>
And I know *my* kids are happy to be homeschooling if only because they can be friends with anyone they want and not worry about what others think on the playground.<br/>
