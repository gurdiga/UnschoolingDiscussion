<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237240580">This personal attack stuff is getting old. Please stop the negative <br/>
personal comments. It&#39;s annoying to see the same old stuff over and <br/>
over.<br/>
<br/>
If you want unschooling topics then bring one up. If you think <br/>
someone&#39;s picking on you, then you could ask them privately to not use <br/>
the list as the forum, or just let it go. They are not the authorities, <br/>
the end all be all, the ruler of your emotions. In other words, those <br/>
who respect your posts will, and those who don&#39;t don&#39;t, their name <br/>
calling will only make them look bad, not you. <br/>
<br/>
It keeps coming back to people taking sides, and getting offended <br/>
whenever a private negative opinion of someone is paraded on the list. <br/>
Maybe the folks who post negative personal comments want others to join <br/>
in and gang up on the supposed offender. No thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want any &quot;I agree&quot;, &quot;You&#39;re wrong&quot; posts about this to the <br/>
whole list, because that would defeat the purpose of this post. I am <br/>
not posting this off list because it is an old problem with a few <br/>
offenders. I hope they will see themselves personally and not just <br/>
defer the problem as someone else&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
Please stop the public personal name calling, sniping, being personally <br/>
offended, and attacking people. If that sentence makes you mad, then <br/>
maybe you are a committing the offenses listed and need to stop.<br/>
<br/>
Remember we are all on the same side. We all want our freedom, we all <br/>
love to learn. We all have things we feel very strongly about. We need <br/>
to remember that beating someone over the head with our viewpoint will <br/>
not change their mind, but polite discourse can do wonders to open <br/>
minds.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; minds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am not calling for anyone to leave (very dramatic by the way, <br/>
dividing into sides, calling others bullies, not productive at all), <br/>
nor am I asking for watered down politically correct mumbo mush. <br/>
<br/>
Useful and controversial stuff can be excitedly expressed without <br/>
calling names, or being personally offended and striking back. It is <br/>
not all or nothing, it&#39;s just that some folks say things online they <br/>
would never say to someone&#39;s face (of course maybe a few folks will say <br/>
anything to anyone, face or list matters not).<br/>
<br/>
Please stop dividing into camps and remember we are all on this list <br/>
with obvious common goals.<br/>
