I think that is wonderful that Meera wants to do this!  Purely for her own enjoyment and for the pleasure of helping others.<br/>
What more could we hope for from our children?<br/>
<br/>
Well done!<br/>
<br/>
I wish that I could be there with my brood.....we would fill up 7 seats, but unfortunately we live in Florida.<br/>
<br/>
Please keep us informed as to how this all turns out.<br/>
<br/>
Peace~<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ll carry your books, I&#39;ll carry a tune,<br/>
I&#39;ll carry on, carry over, carry forward,<br/>
Cary Grant, cash & carry, Carry Me Back To Old Virginia,<br/>
I&#39;ll even Hara Kari if you show me how,<br/>
but I will *not* carry a gun.<br/>

stepped forward to do her hair for her (and is already thinking about<br/>
where she is going for her post-recital dinner!) I&#39;m just sitting back<br/>
and trying (hard) to keep my mouth shut -- don&#39;t want to ruin it.</div>
