<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539937593">Thanks to all who offered advice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be calling the vet tomorrow for a snipping appointment (and <br/>
shots).  I&#39;m just not that handy with tools so the pliers are out!  I <br/>
can&#39;t believe my SIL had this dog for 6 months and never got him any <br/>
vacs.<br/>
<br/>
He is already settling in a little bit.  He is sitting peacefully <br/>
next to me as I write this.  We put up a 50&#39; run in the back yard <br/>
this morning and he has been out there for 4 hours.  He is going <br/>
through chew toys like there is no tomorrow.  If we give them to him <br/>
outside, he hides them!  Inside, he chewed one to bits in about a <br/>
half hour.  <br/>
<br/>
He seems house trained even though my SIL said he wasn&#39;t.  He waits <br/>
until he&#39;s outside to go - maybe she just expected him to wait all <br/>
day?  Now, if we can get him to realize that this is permanent, I <br/>
think we&#39;ll be okay.  He is so used to only having small amounts of <br/>
time out of the cage that he was over stimulated at first I think.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we are off to give him a flea bath, wish us luck!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BIG  rawhide can be very attractive but be careful because he may just turn it<br/>
into a gooey mess and EAT  the WHOLE thing.......not great for the digestive<br/>
tract.   Look at it as candy and limit him.  One thing I have found useful both<br/>
for entertainment and to last more than one day for a heavy chewer is the BIG<br/>
basted cowleg bones.  They may call them dinosaur bones or other cutesy names<br/>
but we are able to find them in our local superstore.   About $10-12 for one but<br/>
they last longer than regular chewtoys or  tied rawhide.    Don&#39;t let the size<br/>
put you off.........you&#39;ll be surprised how much he can drag it around.<br/>
<br/>
Yes,  if put is 7 months old with no shots...........he is at the prime age for<br/>
developing distemper.  Get those shots  ASAP!!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know where you are located and if Parvo or Rabies immunizations are<br/>
something you need to be concerned about.  Or Heartworm preventative.    If you<br/>
are geographically in epidemic and endemic areas,   then don&#39;t delay.<br/>
<br/>
One other tidbit if husky traits are showing through.    ALL  our huskies  as<br/>
youngsters liked to chew electric wires and phone cords.   Not just put little<br/>
teeth marks in them but snip them into a little pile of 1 inch pieces.    Hard<br/>
to watch every moment..........need to toddler proof!.   The wires to video game<br/>
controllers also seemed to be very attractive........boys learned not to leave<br/>
them lying around on the floor when not playing!.    Action figures also seemed<br/>
to be viewed as chewtoys even into adulthood!.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327033172">Living in the city, we do rabies and distemper.  When we lived in the<br/>
country we only did rabies.<br/>
<br/>
In this area there are simply too many rabies carriers that come right up<br/>
into your yards.  And there are too many strays wandering around that appear<br/>
to have distemper.<br/>
<br/>
As to all the rest of them, well I think most are just $$ makers for<br/>
pharmaceutical companies.<br/>
