<div id="ygrps-yiv-189382030"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; And when <br/>
&gt; I wanted to use infertility drugs, the insurance wouldn&#39;t pay for it<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, this one makes the steam start curling out my ears.  We fought our<br/>
health insurance to pay for birth control, and then later for the more<br/>
&quot;permanent&quot; version of such.  They didn&#39;t want to....but they&#39;d be happy to<br/>
pay for 9 more babies if I wanted to have them!  Well, duh!  Babies are a<br/>
lot pricier than birth control!<br/>
<br/>
As far as health insurance for a 20 year old, a couple ideas.  First, can<br/>
you &quot;create&quot; a homeschool and enroll him fulltime for the insurance<br/>
company&#39;s benefit?  Probably a stretch, tho.  Also, check with your regular<br/>
insurance carrier (car, home, etc.) about short-term health insurance<br/>
policies.  They&#39;re generally a bit pricey, but designed for the between jobs<br/>
or between school and jobs sort.  I had one a few years ago and even used<br/>
it, and it was decent coverage.  I think mine was through Thrivant, but most<br/>
insurance agents could probably steer you in the right direction.<br/>
