<div id="ygrps-yiv-933296350"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So, how does one recover? How does a person heal the wounds of religious <br/>
&gt;&gt;abuse? Hopefully, within a caring and understanding new social setting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have found a lot of peace in some books, a lot of healing....<br/>
One is Deepak Chopra&#39;s &quot;The Path to Love&quot; I like a lot of what he says and he <br/>
seems to blend and embrace a lot of different religious beliefs (the good <br/>
parts of them) and prophets in his writings.<br/>
Also Sarah Ban Breathneck&#39;s &quot;Simple Abundance&quot; and her follow up book <br/>
&quot;Excavating your Authentic Self&quot;.<br/>
Get those, I can&#39;t tell you the healing I&#39;ve experienced through these books.<br/>
