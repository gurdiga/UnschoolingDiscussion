<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801988967">So I can&#39;t help but notice how spare the conversation has become here.  I&#39;ve<br/>
talked with Jocelyn and Pam who tell me that discussions have increased on<br/>
the Unschoolingdotcom list.  I do miss the conversation here on<br/>
AlwaysLearning but I&#39;m not interested in spending my time wading through the<br/>
contention and personal attacks that were so common on the Unschoolingdotcom<br/>
list last year when I quit it, at the time Sandra started this list.<br/>
Jocelyn tells me that the Unschoolingdotcom list is not nearly so bad as it<br/>
was last year, but is still far from the friendly atmosphere of this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The time I can spend on e-mail lists is limited and fluctuates wildly in<br/>
relation to my work schedule.  I hope what I have to say is of benefit to<br/>
the unschooling community.  But more importantly what everyone, and<br/>
especially the core posting people on this list have to say benefits me.<br/>
These postings have fallen to a minimum.  I can only assume that people&#39;s<br/>
energies are being spent at Unschoolingdotcom or elsewhere. Good and/or<br/>
friendly doesn&#39;t much matter if there is little conversation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I have a few questions:<br/>
<br/>
Are the core posters from this list now posting at Unschoolingdotcom?<br/>
<br/>
What is your (collective) opinion on the environment at Unschoolingdotcom?<br/>
<br/>
If it is becoming a better place to be than it was, and writings there have<br/>
a greater exposure to more people, what do you think is going to become of<br/>
AlwaysLearning?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do long for those first 2 or 3 weeks of this list. It felt so alive and to<br/>
the point. I felt like I was in school again taking a graduate seminar in<br/>
unschooling. It was a honeymoon I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Is it time for me to resubscribe to unschoolingdotcom?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to be pushy, but it&#39;s getting lonely over here at<br/>
AlwaysLearning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547558732">I think it&#39;s more of a momentary lull than a bail out.  <br/>
Things have slowed down form time to time as people catch up with their<br/>
real lives but it always seems to bounce back when some interesting topic<br/>
comes up.  <br/>
<br/>
I left unschooling-dotcom too, when things got nasty and haven&#39;t been<br/>
interested in going back for more.   Maybe things are better there.  I<br/>
don&#39;t care much about finding out.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the honeymoon&#39;s over.  The last few posts of Sandra&#39;s, Pam<br/>
S, Pam H and others have been among the best ever.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you just need some ice cream, or something. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I just saw there are 219 people on this list now.   You may be sorry if<br/>
everyone starts posting!<br/>

Yeah a few of them are.<br/>

Much better with Joyce moderating. <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
I think its just a lull. Unschoolingdotcom has lulls, they all do.  I think <br/>
Always<br/>
Learning is a different kind of list, even though it has some of the same <br/>
posters, and that could be because many of us came to this list knowing that<br/>
it was Sandra&#39;s list.  So lots of us are on the same page so to speak. <br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;&lt; Is it time for me to resubscribe to unschoolingdotcom?&gt;&gt;<br/>

Up to you : )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, <br/>
<br/>
I have been struggling with this situation for a while now.<br/>
<br/>
An interest of my son&#39;s, as well as my own, has been robotics. We have been<br/>
attending the meetings of a robotics club for about three years now.  It is<br/>
very enjoyable.  I particularly like the brain power in the room.  Most of<br/>
the members are retired aerospace and defense engineers.  We both learned a<br/>
great deal from them. The meetings get me thinking in ways I don&#39;t normally<br/>
do. There is usually a kind of class about the basics of robotics before the<br/>
regular monthly meeting.  During these classes we&#39;ve learned about basic<br/>
electronics, programming, structure, robotic theory, and hardware<br/>
development.  For about a year-and-a-half these class&#39;s were led by a<br/>
middle-aged, and non retired guy.  Very sharp.  He always took an interest<br/>
in what we were doing and gave us useful tutoring.  He maintains a web site<br/>
on robotics as part of his personal Web site.  It has lots of good<br/>
information.  Then one day I was clicking around on his site and came across<br/>
the heading &quot; things that interest me.&quot; He is a smart, interesting guy, I<br/>
clicked on it.      There were links to engineering sites, science-fiction<br/>
fantasy sites among othres, and there it was.<br/>
<br/>
A link to a white supremacists site.<br/>
<br/>
I was in shock.  <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to scream.<br/>
<br/>
Never once did the subject ever come up. I would have *never* guessed he had<br/>
to such interests. I never felt he had a hidden agenda or that he was<br/>
promoting such ideas.  It was just a link.  A link outside of the robotics<br/>
area. <br/>
<br/>
My question is: What would you do in this situation?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking a political or racial question here, I&#39;m asking an<br/>
educational one.<br/>
<br/>
What is the  &quot;AlwaysLearning&quot; situation here? What would you tell your 10<br/>
year-old son? What kind of future interaction which you have with this<br/>
person? Does it affect your relationship to the club?  ?  ?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My question is: What would you do in this situation?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d ignore it. Unless it becomes an issue.<br/>
<br/>
(I assume it was clear that he was deliberately linking to it? It wasn&#39;t<br/>
just a typo?)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it seems like being friendly with him is the same as supporting his<br/>
beliefs?<br/>
<br/>
Are people supporting or validating Unitarian Universalist beliefs by being<br/>
friendly with me? Unschooling? Star Trek?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it feels satisfying to cut off someone who holds racist beliefs. But<br/>
does that stop racism? I don&#39;t even think it nicks it. He won&#39;t change his<br/>
beliefs because someone shuns him. It&#39;s possible that you could influence<br/>
him by being friendly. (Though I wouldn&#39;t be friendly just because of that.)<br/>
<br/>
Someone said that intolerance of intolerance is also intolerance. Sometimes<br/>
I get a glimmer of sense out of that. (Sometimes I don&#39;t. ;-) There&#39;s a<br/>
difference between acknowledging someone&#39;s right to hold the beliefs they do<br/>
and accepting those beliefs as valid. Everyone has a reason for the choices<br/>
they&#39;ve made in life. We can&#39;t know what in his life led him to the<br/>
conclusions he has. What is it that he fears so much that he would hate<br/>
anyone so much?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the causes that lead people to become white supremacists where<br/>
the fight belongs, not in shunning the people who are products of it.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t tell him.<br/>
<br/>
If the man were black and had a link to a Black power site with instructions <br/>
for bomb building (not his site, just a link), would you worry?<br/>
<br/>
If it were a woman and she had a link to some dangerous lesbian site selling <br/>
K.D. Lang and Indigo Girls CDs would you think she was no longer suited to <br/>
discuss robotics?<br/>
<br/>
But your teacher would probably be the first to tell you a lesbian or a Black <br/>
man wouldn&#39;t no diddly about robotics anyway, so it&#39;s all hypothetical!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
[ducking and covering, and then remembering how far away I am from the rest <br/>
of you! &lt;g&gt;]<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I particularly like the brain power in the room.  Most of<br/>
the members are retired aerospace and defense engineers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My uncle is in the VA hospital.  He was up and about from Tuesday to Saturday <br/>
morning, and I visited him several times.  He was sharing a room with an <br/>
elderly, blind Black man named John Amos who introduced himself to me as <br/>
&quot;Amos and Andy,&quot; and asked me if I knew about Amos and Andy.<br/>
<br/>
Those guys were in the military when it was pretty thoroughly segregated.  <br/>
Their lives were not our lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Your teacher-guy isn&#39;t one of the oldest of them there, right?  But &quot;retired&quot; <br/>
in the military can mean 38 years old.  The military isn&#39;t the cutting edge <br/>
of social change--neither is the engineering establishment.<br/>
<br/>
One of my brightest friends has links on his site, and some bug the heck out <br/>
of me.  It doesn&#39;t make him *him* that &quot;Goth Chick of the Month&quot; is right <br/>
there with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the SCA.<br/>
<br/>
Do you reject freely-offered knowledge because of unrelated political belief? <br/>
 Is that as prejudiced as rejecting medical assistance because of the <br/>
doctor&#39;s accent or skin color?   People can&#39;t help their origins, but they <br/>
can help their chosen politics, MAYBE.   <br/>
<br/>
Interesting situation, Dan.  While I would put out extra sensors for comment <br/>
or action which could be disturbing, I wouldn&#39;t volunteer this information to <br/>
Matthew.  Someday, when he&#39;s learned all he wanted to, maybe.  Later.<br/>
<br/>
But then here&#39;s me:  I really like and care about music.  I think Michael <br/>
Jackson is a really, really good songwriter and singer.  I like to watch him <br/>
dance.  I have never since the 1960&#39;s wavered from holding that he was <br/>
super-talented, and when various musical fads came and went and my friends <br/>
said this or that is &quot;stupid,&quot; and disco is dead, and punk sucks, and <br/>
whatever all else, I continued to decide what I liked by what I liked.  <br/>
<br/>
So some people say &quot;He&#39;s a pedophile, and so therefor his music sucks,&quot; I <br/>
think that just proves they care more about fan-magazine crap than they do <br/>
about music itself.  When I listen to him sing, I&#39;m not fantasizing about <br/>
sexual relations. I&#39;m listening to music.<br/>
<br/>
If there were another robotics group and the teacher had a link to a Rainbow <br/>
Coalition site, and you went to that other group even though Matthew wasn&#39;t <br/>
learning as much, THAT would be a political decision.<br/>
<br/>
If you had to pay substantial fees to the white supremecy group to learn <br/>
robotics, that&#39;s a different deal.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m a core poster or not, but I&#39;ve been set to &quot;no mail&quot; on <br/>
this list for over a month. I was on vacation and am now just getting back <br/>
to it. It&#39;s good to be back!<br/>
<br/>
I *am* posting at unschoolingdotcom too, though. And it has definitely been <br/>
getting more of my attention than other places to post for awhile. It just <br/>
felt so needy over there and I hated the idea that people at the message <br/>
boards were being directed to a dysfunctional, hostile list.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What is your (collective) opinion on the environment at <br/>
&gt;&gt;Unschoolingdotcom?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right now I think there are some interesting conversations going on. There <br/>
are lots of newbies and the atmosphere is helpful. Joyce is moderating and <br/>
doing a fantastic job! The snarky emails are becoming fewer and fewer as <br/>
everyone learns to let them slide and not comment. Every now and then one <br/>
particular poster who shall remain nameless tries to stir things up, but I <br/>
guess she&#39;s getting ignored or moderated. People seem beter able to debate <br/>
and understand the difference betwen personal attacks and pointed <br/>
discussion. For now. We&#39;ll see how it goes. I was ready to bail on the list <br/>
a month ago before the tone seemed to shift. I&#39;m not ready to say the tone <br/>
will never shift to the dark side again. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If it is becoming a better place to be than it was, and writings there <br/>
&gt;&gt;have a greater exposure to more people, what do you think is going to <br/>
&gt;&gt;become of AlwaysLearning?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Personally, I feel freer here than at the other list. I ask more questions <br/>
here and answer more questions there. You all feel more like friends and I <br/>
have definitely NOT gotten to that place over there yet.<br/>
I&#39;d like this list to continue as it has been. A wonderful inviting place <br/>
for people who (for the most part) are already unschooling. A place to <br/>
bounce around ideas and conversations and to go into it all a little more in <br/>
depth. Obviously, though, that&#39;s totally MY feel for this list. Others may <br/>
have different ideas about what this list is for and about.<br/>
<br/>

Could it be that it &quot;interested him&quot; because those guys are real whackos? (I <br/>
say that hopefully, but not really in a believing sort of way. :-/)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My question is: What would you do in this situation?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As long as I was ALWAYS there with my son, and sure that there was no <br/>
opportunity for this guy to influence my kid in this area, I think I&#39;d keep <br/>
going. For the robotics, science and such. If the guy branched off at all, <br/>
I&#39;d stop the conversation and explain to everyone why.<br/>
<br/>
Although I must admit, the thought of being in the same room with the guy <br/>
would probably start bothering me immensely.<br/>
<br/>
We had something similar, but not really, come up with Casey&#39;s Brownie <br/>
meetings. I was a leader and it turns out the other leader&#39;s dh was a WWII <br/>
buff. Big time. Obsessively. We had a meeting in her house and there they <br/>
were. Huge, authentic Nazi flags hanging up there with all the other WWII <br/>
memoribilia.<br/>
<br/>
It bothered the other parents to have Nazi flags hanging there, seemingly to <br/>
be admired. We never had another meeting there and told the Mom why. <br/>
Hmmm....come to think of it, if the Dad had been a white supremacist, I <br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t have anything to do with them. But he wasn&#39;t. He was just <br/>
an idiot with nothing too valuable to offer my kids. It was easy to stay <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
Again, more questions than answers today. :-/<br/>

really two questions, whether I would want to be involved with someone<br/>
like this, and whether my kid would, and I wouldn&#39;t assume that the<br/>
answer would be the same. <br/>
<br/>
If my kid did decide she wanted to be involved, I&#39;d rather she be aware<br/>
of this guy&#39;s beliefs. I don&#39;t see any difference between this and a link<br/>
to a NAMBLA site - both are offensive to me, both are morally wrong in my<br/>
mind. Since my kid is a white girl, neither would affect her directly.<br/>
Still, I&#39;d want her to be aware of the ideas this guy might start<br/>
spouting, I&#39;d want her to be prepared. I wouldn&#39;t prevent her from going.<br/>
I don&#39;t prevent her from seeing her father, who has, or had, ties to the<br/>
AB... and I&#39;ve heard her call him on racist talk, she&#39;s strong enough in<br/>
her beliefs that his don&#39;t influence her... maybe hers will influence<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Are all the people in the class white? I&#39;m assuming you and your son<br/>
are...?<br/>
<br/>
If one or both of us decided to stay with the class, one thing I&#39;d do is<br/>
talk to the guy directly, privately, and just tell him what I found and<br/>
what my concerns were - not in a confrontational way, but just to let him<br/>
know where I stood. Assuming he&#39;s an otherwise decent guy with a few<br/>
loose connections in this area, it might at least prevent awkward<br/>
situations  in future, so he won&#39;t assume you share his beliefs at all.<br/>
At best, maybe it will set him on a path of reexamining his own beliefs.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s still open to learning...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are people in my life who hold beliefs that I find<br/>
offensive, and I know nothing about it. <br/>

Could it be that it &quot;interested him&quot; because those guys are real whackos? (I <br/>
say that hopefully, but not really in a believing sort of way. :-/) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine followed the Flat Earth Society for years because it <br/>
fascinated her like a trainwreck, not because she agreed with them.<br/>
<br/>
I used to work for a friend who prints books and cats reproduction medieval <br/>
jewelry.  He had three Thor&#39;s Hammers in the catalog.  I was doing mail <br/>
order, and one day we got a really friendly letter from The Aryan Nation.  <br/>
They were thrilled that we had such great Norse stuff of such high quality <br/>
for so little money, and they ordered several.  And they had enclosed, in <br/>
case we were interested, flyers for their latest project, and application <br/>
forms.<br/>
<br/>
From their point of view, we produced something which was a trigger for them. <br/>
 It would be like someone assuming you&#39;d care about wiccan ceremonies because <br/>
you were selling window stickers with fairies and pentagrams on them, or some <br/>
such.  So we made copies of these forms for everyone in the shop.<br/>
<br/>
The shop consisted of all longtime friends.  Two women, three men.  We were <br/>
all (in local parlance) Anglo.  That means (in New Mexico) we weren&#39;t <br/>
Hispanic or Indian, and we were native English speakers.  The term &quot;white&quot; <br/>
isn&#39;t used in any polite company in New Mexico.   Our last names were:  <br/>
Moseley, Stinebaugh, McHarney, Adams, and Lesnik.  All of us had some <br/>
blue-eyed ancestors, but it looked like from this form that we could fail to <br/>
qualify if we had BROWN eyed grandparents.  Bummer. We all were off the list.<br/>
<br/>
BUT they were collecting memberships in the form of money to buy an island <br/>
somewhere in the Pacific so their members could live in a physically <br/>
all-white land.  <br/>
<br/>
Yeah!  Good thing the Thor&#39;s hammers were all under $12 because I don&#39;t think <br/>
they were going to actually make enough money.<br/>
<br/>
AND they had sent a little newsletter, with an article on &quot;Norse Martial <br/>
Arts.&quot;  No kidding, they had done up some sort of karate-style weapons kata <br/>
with an axe or something, and they would practice it together to build strong <br/>
minds and bodies.  Uh huh!!!<br/>
<br/>
They were goofy.  They were nuts.  We had a BLAST with their stuff, poking <br/>
fun and teasing each other, and wondering how bad it would be if our friends <br/>
came in and found us all with this &quot;literature.&quot;  And I wrote back on behalf <br/>
of the shop and said we weren&#39;t really interested in their politics, but I <br/>
was glad they liked the Thor&#39;s Hammers.  <br/>

One way for him to prevent awkward situations in the future would be to <br/>
remove that link.  So here&#39;s a guy who has a link.  Maybe because he agrees, <br/>
maybe because he thinks it&#39;s weird and interesting.   If Dan mentions it, he <br/>
might remove the link.  Tadaaa!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
THEN you&#39;ll have to wonder about everyone whose website does NOT have a link. <br/>
 Did they have one and just remove it to avoid offending students?<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm?????<br/>
<br/>
If he were teaching a class on WWII or the history of slavery, I&#39;d be really <br/>
concerned.  But he&#39;s teaching robotics.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But potential future awkward situations, like the ones I was referring to<br/>
in both posts, certainly could. Removing the link wouldn&#39;t resolve what I<br/>
see as the real issue - doing an activity with someone whose beliefs<br/>
offend you. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you find out through a link, or<br/>
through some other method. What I think is important is making it clear<br/>
to others what my beliefs are, so no assumptions to the opposite are<br/>
made. Maybe in this case they won&#39;t be, I don&#39;t know, but I think it&#39;s at<br/>
least a possibility. I&#39;m assuming that since Dan is making sure he&#39;s with<br/>
his son whenever his son talks to this guy, that Dan also thinks that the<br/>
guy might bring up these beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
And I see a difference between chosing not to associate with someone<br/>
because he&#39;s Asian and chosing not to associate with someone because he<br/>
believes that non-white people are inferior to white people and should be<br/>
forced to leave this country, or little boys should have sexual<br/>
experience with adult men before they&#39;re 8, or children should be hit<br/>
with belts. By my value system, these are evil beliefs that people are on<br/>
some level chosing to hold, and by ignoring them and continuing to be<br/>
friendly with people who hold them, I condone them. This is why we<br/>
boycott Ne$tle - not because there&#39;s anything wrong with their food, but<br/>
because we don&#39;t agree with their beliefs around the marketing of<br/>
artificial baby milks. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone has to draw their own line. There are things I think are wrong,<br/>
but not so wrong that I would not associate with someone I knew favored<br/>
it - I would quickly run out of friends it I were this judgemental. OTOH,<br/>
I&#39;m not a governement agency, I&#39;m allowed to judge people based on their<br/>

<br/>
Oh.  Got it.<br/>
<br/>
But for instance, in this forum...<br/>
If you have one particular hobby or vice or secret, should it matter one way <br/>
or the other if it doesn&#39;t affect your ideas and anecdotes and suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re talking about unschooling do we really  need to declare which of us <br/>
have had abortions or assisted in abortions or haven&#39;t had abortions but <br/>
would if we felt the need, or those who have refused abortions even though <br/>
they had to put a baby up for adoption?  (I&#39;m purposely using a big emotional <br/>
example, and one which sometimes  HAS affected otherwise friendly <br/>
homeschooling exchanges.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not making assumptions about people&#39;s feelings about reproduction here.  <br/>
I was surprised the other day when I showed a photo of Lori Odhner&#39;s family <br/>
to a local (childless) friend.  Or rather she saw the photo of the whole <br/>
family in matching pants (a Christmas tradition with them is Lori sews <br/>
clothes out of the same material for everyone in the family--they&#39;ve done it <br/>
since the kids were babies, and the dad would get a garment too--and last <br/>
year it was pants of a brown print), and the photo of the new twins.  My <br/>
friend said something really mean about people who have more children than <br/>
anyone should.  (The Odhners have nine, with the new twins.)   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not assuming about infant care or circumcision or family bed--it doesn&#39;t <br/>
matter.  Some people came to unschooling from that angle, and some went <br/>
through ten years of traditional school before popping out of the system.<br/>
<br/>
If one of you was once involved in the bombing of a bridge, or belonged to a <br/>
church that shunned a member out to the point that she killed herself, or <br/>
once got in a bar fight over a karaoke-related insult, it doesn&#39;t matter to <br/>
me.  If you hope to do it again, is that worse?<br/>
<br/>
Should it matter more if you have a link to that stuff on a website?<br/>

&gt; beliefs and that while you respect him as an<br/>
&gt; expert on Robots you do not share his beliefs<br/>
&gt; and that you wish for him to make an effort<br/>
&gt; to not share those beliefs with the child?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey Joylyn - not to detract from your post and all it says - because it was <br/>
significant and useful to read and I really appreciate it (I ALSO have had <br/>
those supermarket comments about my kids - people ask me whether they had the <br/>
same father or whether one was adopted - rude and hurtful especially to the <br/>
child who looks so different from her sisters and from me - I tell them she <br/>
looks like her dad on the outside and JUST like me, her mommy, on the <br/>
inside), but I&#39;d be really interested to know what you thought about the <br/>
actual situation about which Dan was asking.<br/>
<br/>
This is a once-a-month get-together where Matthew is the ONLY kid and the <br/>
group is largely composed of lots of retired guys who are interested in <br/>
robotics. There is a presentation and some discussion. The guy Dan is <br/>
concerned with is not a &quot;teacher.&quot; Matthew is not being directly instructed <br/>
by him, but may be part of or listening to conversations that involve him.  <br/>
The guy has never given any indication of racism at the monthly meetings. Dan <br/>
went looking at the guy&#39;s personal website and discovered a link that went to <br/>
a white supremist site.<br/>
<br/>
So - should they quit going to the Robotics Association meetings? If so, <br/>
should they just leave quietly or should they say they&#39;re leaving because of <br/>
the link on this guy&#39;s website? Or should they keep going? Should he talk to <br/>
Matthew about what he discovered about this guy?<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Dan, after thinking this over for a few days, I think you ought <br/>
to tell Matthew about it - I think he&#39;s perfectly capable of starting to <br/>
grasp that evil can come in the form of a very congenial and seemingly <br/>
intelligent person. I think the idea is not too horrible or ugly to introduce <br/>
to him at his age - it is reality and as much as we&#39;d sure like to keep our <br/>
kids from ever experiencing the negative aspects of the world, I don&#39;t think <br/>
we do them any favors not to clue them in, slowly and in exactly these kinds <br/>
of ways where it comes up even in their very-sheltered lives. After all, when <br/>
people accuse us of sheltering our kids, we always reply that they are NOT <br/>
sheltered, they are out experiencing the real-world. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just do it in a natural way - while looking at his website you might have <br/>
said, &quot;Whoa - I can&#39;t believe this.&quot; &quot;What, dad?&quot; &quot;YUCK - Mr. X - you know <br/>
that guy at robotics - he has a link to a white supremist site on his <br/>
personal webpage.&quot; &quot;What is a white supremist?&quot; &quot;People who think white <br/>
people are superior to other races.&quot; And so on - just keeping the whole <br/>
conversation on the level that Matthew determines.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of the simple answer equivalent to the same approach to answering sex <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
It will make Matthew uncomfortable with that guy at Robotics. AS WELL IT <br/>
SHOULD!!! He&#39;ll be learning a lot more than robotics there, but he can still <br/>
learn that too.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t take this opportunity to talk about this kind of stuff, <br/>
you&#39;ll have other opportunities, unfortunately. Protecting innocence can <br/>
become protecting ignorance - that seems like one big aspect of what you were <br/>
asking about - when does protecting our children&#39;s innocence go so far as to <br/>
be keeping them ignorant.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is central to my struggle.  Keep in mind that I have been stewing about<br/>
this for two years. Matthew and I were pretty close to of this guy in our<br/>
interest of robotics.  Nothing else. In no other way did we interact. My<br/>
discovery had shook me up pretty badly.  I had a very difficult time, at 42,<br/>
trying to figure out what to do.  I couldn&#39;t imagine my 10 year-old being<br/>
any less shocked.  That protection instinct kicked in.  So, now at 12 years<br/>
old he&#39;s 20 percent older and probably better equipped to deal with the<br/>
concept.  What I don&#39;t want to happen is to have robotics and white<br/>
supremacy linked together in Matthew&#39;s mind, like it now is in mine.  Would<br/>
you feel the same way if this person was Rosie&#39;s riding instructor? Or one<br/>
of the ceramic artists that Roya is studying under? Matthew and I have had<br/>
discussions about bigotry and racism and white supremacy. I think he<br/>
understands the repugnant concept.<br/>
<br/>
The closeness of it is what bothers me. And maybe that&#39;s why I should do<br/>
what you suggest.  I have understood the concept for many years.  But when<br/>
it hits close to home it&#39;s exponentially more painful.  A while back Joylyn<br/>
talked about her children, children I&#39;ve enjoyed company of at many a park<br/>
day, being refused service by some *sshole at Denny&#39;s while traveling. I had<br/>
read the news stories and the court case about this very subject and may<br/>
have even discussed it with Matthew. But now the ugly concept hits my home<br/>
(or at least my park day group) and I begin to lose rational thought about<br/>
her kids, Denny&#39;s, and being hungry while on the road.  My reaction is to<br/>
protect my son from this kind of confusion and pain.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s only *my* problem?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet Joylyn feels differently.<br/>

with the boys and me (she lived with us off and on)<br/>
some people assumed she was their mother due to the<br/>
resemblance in coloring. Black hair (well, she had red<br/>
hair), lovely light golden-brown skin, beautiful thick<br/>

beautiful straight white teeth. Other times I was<br/>
asked if I had adopted.<br/>

You know here and also in Africa, it isn&#39;t racism but tribalism that&#39;s a<br/>
problem. Wonder why &quot;isms&quot; are such a part of human nature.<br/>
