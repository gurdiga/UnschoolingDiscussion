<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940987496">Hello friends and listmembers!<br/>

now Unschooling-Discussion, and the new lists are:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-622325109">Question????<br/>
<br/>
So if we want to talk about what we did today or some new resource we found <br/>
should we subscribe to the other lists that are specifically for that and post <br/>
there?  Kind of like a message board with different topics?  Or do we continue <br/>
to use this list like we have been...for discussing things unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290713436">I&#39;m afraid responses to posts will bounce back now, if they came from the <br/>
other address, and most of my morning&#39;s mail was from that other list.  After a <br/>
few days I guess that will be done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For those people who complained about this list and specifically named me (I <br/>
know there were at least two), I won&#39;t go to the cafe list. 101, politics or <br/>
creatively, so there&#39;s where you can go if your goal is to be on a list where <br/>
I&#39;m not.   The &quot;days&quot; list kind of appeals to me since I have a collection, but <br/>
I don&#39;t know how well it will work to have it separate from the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I would also like to say for the record that there are a few people here who <br/>
are more radical about unschooling than I am, but they haven&#39;t been complained <br/>
about.  I wrote to a small group of them a month or two ago and said I <br/>
thought they were going too far (for my comfort), farther than I would and I was <br/>
used to being the radical fringe!<br/>
<br/>
La Leche League has the same double-level situation unschooling has.   IS it <br/>
just about nursing babies?  It is and it isn&#39;t.  If people want to nurse <br/>
babies on a schedule, it&#39;s not going to work.   If people want to nurse babies and <br/>
still see them as sinful, manipulative creatures, it&#39;s not going to work.   So <br/>
La Leche League ends up involving itself in &quot;loving discipline&quot; and what <br/>
foods to go to as babies are weaning, and family bed, and sibling relations.     <br/>
Not all of it is breastfeeding.  Some women want to come JUST for breastfeeding <br/>
help.  Thing is, they have no idea of what all will HINDER breastfeeding.  <br/>
<br/>
And so with this.  Someone can be breastfeeding who is also leaving a baby to <br/>
cry himself to sleep and swatting kids for not doing what the mom says fast <br/>
enough.  It won&#39;t change whether they&#39;re breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
And so I know someone can be unschooling while still requiring kids to meet <br/>
schoolish goals, and without trusting the kids with other aspects of their <br/>
lives, and not having it change the parents&#39; lives or beliefs.  It&#39;s not the kind <br/>
of unschooling that will work well for years, though.  It is, in my <br/>
experience, the kind of unschooling that leads to buying a curriculum or putting kids <br/>
back in school as failures to thrive at unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know too many volunteers at La Leche League who would spend much of <br/>
their volunteer time saying &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter how you treat your child when <br/>
he&#39;s not nursing, just so you nurse him.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m a volunteer.<br/>
<br/>
And I won&#39;t say what people want to hear just to give them a moment of <br/>
relative happiness.  I&#39;d rather say what I think their children need their mom to <br/>
hear to give them YEARS of greater happiness.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m staying here.<br/>

I could have a whole lot to say about this post but sometimes short and<br/>
sweet is the best. And before I use the short and sweet  I want to clarify<br/>
since I seem to be so hard to understand lately. This is meant as a good<br/>
thing and not a glad you aren&#39;t going elsewhere thing. I hope that&#39;s clear.<br/>

  The first list I joined was MontanaUnschoolers.  And, I joined because of their description.... for those who are unschooling and homeschooling for non-traditional reasons.  I had no idea what UNschooling was.  NONE!  I thought the people on the list had way out ideas, but they were mostly very loving and they were not judgmental nor jumping down my throat each time I thought something was scary, crazy, or anything else.  They helped me out, they held my hand and showed me, not just told me, how unschooling is better for children.  I was warned about THIS list, the unschooling-dotcom@yahoogroups list, because it was not for the timid, not a support group, they say what they think without a sugar coating.  So, when I joined the unschooling-dotcom list I did just hang out in the background and read.  I learned a few things, but skipped the majority of the posts.  One time I posted something about which I wanted seriously honest opinions and it was about my daughter leaving the yard without permission and the situation that followed.  Many people on this list responded.  Most apologized for what they were going to say before they said it.  I was not offended by any of it, but had it been earlier in my research about unschooling, I may have been and those responses may have encouraged me change my mind about unschooling toward curriculum home based education.  <br/>
<br/>
  So, I think Homeschool 101 should be for those very compassionate, kind, experienced and patient unschoolers who can help with encouragement and such.  I think people need to be shown and not told, when they are beginners.  And, if people are going to be posting on both lists, they will have to change their mindset, and I hope they will.<br/>

***I&#39;m all those things.***<br/>
<br/>
And how!   And patient in things I could never be patient in.  More than<br/>
once I&#39;ve complimented Sandra on her patience over some poster or other I<br/>
would have throttled if I&#39;d been near enough.<br/>
<br/>
I used to strive to be as patient as Sandra but I&#39;ve come to realize I<br/>
don&#39;t have that wonderful ability.<br/>
I&#39;m afraid to join the other lists because I couldn&#39;t bear it if an<br/>
unschooling list turned into a &quot;there, there dear&quot; kind of list where<br/>
hand holding and cooing was more important than telling the truth. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, yes, Sandra is patient, compassionate, kind and experienced. <br/>
She&#39;s also smart and funny and honest.  She&#39;s cute, too.  Dang!  Some<br/>
people have it all.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Further, I wasn&#39;t accusing anyone on this list of being f*ck&#39;d up to people.  I remember Sandra being very nice, and direct with my problem, and you, too, but then I felt like a few people did take some sucker punches that I thought were uncalled for.  I ignored their posts.  I was clear in my post that I didn&#39;t know if I did the right thing and wanted people&#39;s honest opinions.<br/>
<br/>
I see I have pressed some buttons, though.  Didn&#39;t mean to.  Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
If I had joined MontanaUnschoolers and got a bunch of lashing out women jumping down my throat, I think I&#39;d still be trying to figure out how to make printing practice more enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not patient and nobody will ever accuse me of being patient.  I think the people on my own Baha&#39;i Unschoolers list would kick me off if they could.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even on this list I was extremely annoyed with the whole (not to open a can of worms) mannerliness/rankiness (rank i ness, guh!!!), and I think I was ignored for showing that.  Telling people they needed to research, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m off on a tangent and I&#39;ve lost focus.  haha  Um....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway... Sorry for offending.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m outta here.... for now.<br/>

<br/>
No you didn&#39;t.  This is a discussion list.  That &lt;g&gt; (grin) after my<br/>
comment meant I was being funny.  You missed it I guess, but you&#39;d be one<br/>
of many. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t offend anyone.  You stated your opinion on a discussion list<br/>
and had some replies to your post, that&#39;s all.  What&#39;s a discussion list<br/>
for?  <br/>
<br/>
I know there are people who don&#39;t want to hear the straight poop.   They<br/>
need to hear all the niceties and be validated for being a caring mother,<br/>
etc.   I hope some of the other lists can do that for them and stay<br/>
focused on good unschooling advice and information, but I think a lot of<br/>
that kind of handling with kid gloves turns a list into a sympathy party<br/>
and not a good exchange of information.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people get jumped on here -- that&#39;s my opinion--- I think<br/>
they &quot;feel&quot; jumped on for various (personal, emotional, psychological)<br/>
reasons.    That&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing, but it&#39;s difficult on a<br/>
discussion list.   <br/>
It&#39;s difficult to have a discussion with someone who takes the discussion<br/>
of ideas personally.  Saying &quot;you could have made a better choice&quot; is not<br/>
the same as saying &quot;you&#39;re a bad mother&quot; or &quot;you&#39;re a booger head.&quot; <br/>
Some people don&#39;t seem to be able to see the difference.   <br/>

Sandra, this a.m. I checked in quickly before a full day with my <br/>
kids. My first comment was going to be &quot;I&#39;ll be on any list Sandra <br/>

<br/>
Your advice has been the most helpful to me of all. I&#39;ve enjoyed <br/>
tons of contributions, but your real life examples that you so <br/>
generously offer us (sharing your kids&#39; lives) has given me the <br/>
clearest picture of unschooling as a lifestyle, not just a way to <br/>
educate kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; La Leche League has the same double-level situation <br/>

 </span></blockquote>nurse <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; babies on a schedule, it&#39;s not going to work.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great analogy and one I return a lot as I think and talk about it <br/>
with friends. As a leader, I can tell you that when moms would <br/>
ask how they can coordinate breastfeeding with working <br/>
full-time, I&#39;d offer the advice with the caveat: It won&#39;t be the same <br/>
as nursing at home with your baby and here are the problems <br/>
you&#39;ll encounter. But if you will work and breastfeed, talk to these <br/>
people who can help you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have the experience or the heart to spend a lot of time <br/>
learning about working and breast feeding. Some women did. it <br/>
just wasn&#39;t where I felt I could put my energy best and feel good <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
So I really udnerstand what you&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933923625">&lt;&lt;Deb L, who thinks there should be a &quot;No stinking whiners!&quot; list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have appreciated this list, all of it&#39;s help, and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
experience but to deny there has not been a bit of uncalled for <br/>
harshness is not telling the truth. No one is perfect, not you, not <br/>
Sandra, not myself. <br/>
<br/>
Many at one time or another spoke in a way that did not show<br/>
maturity. <br/>
Me saying something tacky because I had a hard day, people being told <br/>
not to post, people being told to be quiet and criticizing the people <br/>
on the list for the way they feel is wrong. I don&#39;t think all were <br/>
asking to have their hand held. <br/>
<br/>
While some on the list may be more experienced with unschooling, <br/>
history, speaking, writing, whatever, they still don&#39;t know it all<br/>
and <br/>
don&#39;t own the list. I&#39;ve seen it happen with some on this list <br/>
including myself, say something wrong and watch out BUT they will <br/>
e-mail you off list and play the ever so nice person. You say this <br/>
list is truthful, I believe for the most part it is but I believe <br/>
there are some that are not. <br/>
<br/>
Either way, I&#39;m here and on all the other lists, free to post and <br/>
discuss what I wish in reagrd to unschooling, just like everyone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801326">Helen here. Listowner. Just thought I&#39;d take a moment to share some <br/>
thoughts about this new change in direction for the old <br/>
Unschooling-dotcom list.<br/>
<br/>
When we started this list in 1999 we envisioned a place where people <br/>
interested in unschooling could exchange ideas and experiences, ask <br/>
questions and get answers, share their joys and frustrations, and get <br/>
to know other people interested in how children (and adults) learn <br/>
and grow and learn some more. It has been tremendously satisfying to <br/>
watch this list become all that and even more, and to grow to become <br/>
the largest unschooling-related list at the largest list managing <br/>
service on the web, and far and away the largest list we at HEM <br/>
sponsor!<br/>
<br/>
The success of this list is due in very large part due to our <br/>
wonderful moderator, Joyce. Her fierce dedication and hard work have <br/>
made this list what it is today, and her clear-eyed vision and <br/>
seemingly endless patience will continue to make it a wonderful place <br/>
for anyone interested in unschooling for years to come.<br/>
<br/>
By changing the name of this list we hoped only to clarify the <br/>
intent, which is simply to discuss all aspects of unschooling, just <br/>
as the list has been doing since 1999. The new lists are for those <br/>
who want to explore a specific aspect of unschooling (like resources <br/>
or creativity), or to examine an issue in depth from an unschooling <br/>
perspective (like politics or how one lives day-to-day). Anyone is <br/>
welcome to discuss those same things on this list as well, and we do <br/>
not plan to tell people to, as an example, take their excitement over <br/>
a new book over to the Unschooling-Resources list. We might suggest <br/>
we share the resource with that list, but nothing related to <br/>
unschooling will be inappropriate for this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a frequent contributor to this list in the past, and at <br/>
some point I probably will be again. But right now I&#39;m spending the <br/>
summer travelling and I won&#39;t be reading or participating nearly as <br/>
much as I&#39;d like to. I&#39;ll be around, though. I&#39;ll read great bunches <br/>
of posts at a time when I can, and every once in a while I might even <br/>
venture to post a reply or a comment. For the most part though, I&#39;ll <br/>
limit my posting to the new Unschooling-Politics list (political <br/>
action being my primary interest), and maybe the less-busy <br/>
Unschooling-Cafe list. On this list or another one, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll see <br/>
you around.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to *everyone* for your patience during this transition.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Helen<br/>

need moderators at some point down the road, but for the time being I <br/>

lots of listnames through YahooGroups without losing either messages <br/>
or replies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And so with this.  Someone can be breastfeeding who is also leaving a baby to<br/>
&gt;cry himself to sleep and swatting kids for not doing what the mom says fast<br/>
&gt;enough.  It won&#39;t change whether they&#39;re breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sandra, as much as I&#39;ve always appreciated your advice and enthusiasm <br/>
for this list and unschooling, I have to say again here and now that <br/>
your sweeping across-the-board pronouncements about what is or isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling are one of the reasons I quit trying to keep up with this <br/>
list. You all too often don&#39;t give people any room to think they can <br/>
grow or learn from their mistakes - as in the example above: I&#39;ve <br/>
struggled with letting my kids cry themselves to sleep, and I&#39;ve <br/>
swatted their butts for not moving when I thought they should. But I <br/>
learned, and changed, and others can too. Meet people where they are, <br/>
and not where you think they should already be.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And so I know someone can be unschooling while still requiring kids to meet<br/>
&gt;schoolish goals, and without trusting the kids with other aspects of their<br/>
&gt;lives, and not having it change the parents&#39; lives or beliefs.  It&#39;s <br/>
&gt;not the kind<br/>
&gt;of unschooling that will work well for years, though.  It is, in my<br/>
&gt;experience, the kind of unschooling that leads to buying a <br/>
&gt;curriculum or putting kids<br/>
&gt;back in school as failures to thrive at unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Once again, a sweeping pronouncement that didn&#39;t turn out to be true <br/>
in my case, or in many, many others. I&#39;m a second-generation <br/>
unschooler, so I was *much* better prepared than 99% of the people <br/>
doing it today. Unschooling is so totally foreign to what most people <br/>
have experienced in their lives that it takes time and a few mistakes <br/>
to figure out what to do and how to do it. Even with my <br/>
having-been-unschooled background I blew it more often than I like to <br/>
think about when I was starting out with my kids. I was sure that <br/>
expecting them to buckle down and do bookwork was good for them, was <br/>
what I was *supposed* to be doing. And even today I wonder if one kid <br/>
would be a better speller if I&#39;d *made* him put more effort into <br/>
it... for more about my doubts see my May/June HEM editorial:<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And I won&#39;t say what people want to hear just to give them a moment of<br/>
&gt;relative happiness.  I&#39;d rather say what I think their children need <br/>
&gt;their mom to<br/>
&gt;hear to give them YEARS of greater happiness.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about saying what they need to hear followed by why you think <br/>
their children need for them to hear something different?<br/>
<br/>
If people quit listening to you because you deny their needs, how are <br/>
you helping their children?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;So I&#39;m staying here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good. I&#39;m glad you&#39;re staying, because this list wouldn&#39;t be what it <br/>
is without you. But please try to understand why so many people have <br/>
so much trouble accepting your good advice about unschooling. When <br/>
you hold up nine people who &quot;got it&quot; as examples of your success, <br/>
don&#39;t ignore that one person who didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; or write her off as <br/>
just being too difficult or hard-headed or whatever. Work on trying <br/>
to take your message to a level that even she can understand, and the <br/>
next ten people to come along will probably *all* benefit from your <br/>
effort.<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of a question I&#39;ve been meaning to ask here for some <br/>
time now (if it&#39;s already been answered just point me back to the <br/>
archives and I&#39;ll hunt down the post): With all your teaching of <br/>
others how to unschool - or however you want to phrase what you do <br/>
here and through other means - what are you, yourself, learning about <br/>
unschooling and learning and helping other people and such?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see that at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think letting a person know there are better, happier ways to live with<br/>
children shows the utmost faith that person is a growing, thinking,<br/>
learning individual.   If she didn&#39;t think they could grow and learn why<br/>
bother at all to give them information they may have never heard before? <br/>
 I don&#39;t think anyone would spend years giving advice and information and<br/>
examples of unschooling if she didn&#39;t believe with her whole heart that<br/>
people could learn better ways to parent. <br/>

She writes with loving respect about her own children and her wonder and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As someone that hasn&#39;t been a member of this list long, I really hesitate to <br/>
give my opinion...but....<br/>
<br/>
It seems like this list (Discussion), Creatively, Cafe, Days and maybe even <br/>
Politics (but for certain the first 3) are too much the same.  Not complaining, <br/>
but I think I&#39;ll just stick with this list because I&#39;ve seen message boards <br/>
divided, subdivided, and splintered only to end up with one folder that is so <br/>
busy and lively everyone goes there, and a bunch of others that are barely <br/>
visited.  I would almost bet that&#39;s what will happen on these lists.  Maybe not <br/>
:o)<br/>
<br/>
101 could be a good thing, but will probably end up with the same questions <br/>
being answered over and over and over again...&quot;What exactly is unschooling?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Do you use a curriculum?&quot;  I honestly feel the best thing newbies can be told <br/>
is to refer to the unschooling.com site to read, read, and read some more.  <br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;resources&quot; will be helpful, and if I, personally, join any others it <br/>
will probably be that one.  <br/>
<br/>
I vaguely remember questions about what people want from an email list, and I <br/>
must have missed that this list was going to be divided.  Which list do you <br/>
think will cover &quot;parenting&quot; the most?  <br/>
<br/>
Truly not complaining, just offering some input.  OK, I am a little sad that <br/>
things will be all divided up now :o(  People will probably refer to <br/>
discussions at other lists, and unless we are subscribed to all of them (which I just <br/>
physically, mentally, and time wise, cannot do) the discussions will be <br/>
disconnected.  <br/>
<br/>
I do know that all this was done with good intentions, though, and I&#39;m sure <br/>
it will work out for some people.  I&#39;m happy for them...*sniff sniff* *wimper*<br/>
