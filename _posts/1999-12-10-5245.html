&lt;&lt;  I think this is an abuse of <br/>
 power.<br/>
 Laura &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I wholeheartedly agree.  I haven&#39;t been around much lately...just got <br/>
back from out of town and the whole court situation with my nephew.  We went <br/>
to court on Monday morning, sat in the waiting area for a little over two <br/>
hours, then went in to see the judge.  The probation officer had asked for a <br/>
continuance because my nephew&#39;s mother hadn&#39;t gotten in touch with him soon <br/>
enough for him to do his evaluation.  The judge was mad and said that if this <br/>
happened again, the probation officer would be talking to my nephew behind <br/>
bars.  So he goes back on Dec. 27.  The probation officer says he will be on <br/>
informal probation for six monthes to a year.  He says they don&#39;t like <br/>
independent study so I don&#39;t know if they will make him go back to public <br/>
school.  I don&#39;t understand why when he&#39;s doing better this way and when we <br/>
have complied with California&#39;s compulsory education laws.  The probation <br/>
officer said to me that kids need to be in some kind of school unless they&#39;re <br/>
little Einsteins, that our public schools need money, etc.  It really bothers <br/>
me that he will let his personal and political views influence what he does <br/>
in this capacity. <br/>
     He asked me to write a statement, so I did.  I gave my views on how <br/>
Ricky is doing, how his learning is going, why I believe it is important for <br/>
him to continue as he is, etc.   I hope it does some good.  <br/>
     Right now, I feel kind of discouraged.  I don&#39;t know how to fight their <br/>
system.  I sat in that waiting area and talked to other parents in there <br/>
about what their kids were in there for and I was totally disgusted.  One <br/>
woman had a boy who was 12 or 13 and had gotten in a fight with a kid at <br/>
school.  He said the kid slapped him so he hit him and they fought.  On the <br/>
one hand, I don&#39;t at all think this is the right way to handle it.  On the <br/>
other, I know that kids get in fights and have done so for many years and <br/>
there are better ways of handling it than to call the police and put him in <br/>
the court system.  I&#39;m not talking about weapons or injuries, just a typical <br/>
fight.  Is it actually supposed to do some good to put the kid on probation <br/>
with the threat of juvenile hall if they have any problems at all?  One woman <br/>
said that her friend&#39;s son was on probation and then got a ticket for <br/>
jaywalking so they put him in juvenile hall for a week.  <br/>
     They can&#39;t even guarantee the safety of the kids in juvenile hall.  They <br/>
act like it&#39;s just a little lesson for them to learn being in there.  And I <br/>
guess if once in a while one gets gang-raped, well, that&#39;s what you get for <br/>
getting in a fight at school...  I guess I shouldn&#39;t even keep writing about <br/>
this right now because at the moment I feel angry and bitter about what <br/>
they&#39;re doing in that town and it&#39;s not even a constructive anger.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know what to do to fight it.  I have written to various organizations but <br/>
never heard back.  I know they get thousands of letters all the time so I <br/>
guess it&#39;s against the odds to catch anyone&#39;s attention.  I have to think <br/>
about this and figure out how to regroup...<br/>

<br/>
Do you think some of these kids just don&#39;t have anything they really care<br/>
about?  A kid in my neighborhood was caught breaking into houses (back in<br/>
the 70&quot;s).  His mom didn&#39;t know about it until he was caught.  His<br/>
punishment was minor, but then he discovered wrestling for the school<br/>
team, did really great, and ended up with a college scholarship.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that a kid who is really excited about something and<br/>
has the opportunity to pursue it, will be less likely to spend time<br/>
getting into trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry things are so tough for you right now.  Hang in there!<br/>

What kind of ISP is he in?  Is it one run by the local school district?  If<br/>
it is, you need to explain to the p.o. that the district gets just as much<br/>
money for your nephew as they would if he was in regular kiddy jail, oops,<br/>
ps.<br/>
<br/>
If he isn&#39;t in one run by a school district, you might see if you can<br/>
negotiate so that he can use the ps ISP program.<br/>

    Mary Ellen,<br/>
    Very true!  I think this is the main reason I unschool, so that my kids <br/>
have the opportunities to find the things they&#39;re excited about.  I guess <br/>
what bothers me so much about the kids in the Lancaster area juvenile justice <br/>
system is that those in charge aren&#39;t trying at all to solve the problems; <br/>
it&#39;s strictly a punishment mentality.  Also, some of the things the kids do <br/>
aren&#39;t major issues; they&#39;re just foolish kid things.  In most schools, the <br/>
justice system would not be involved at all.  I think the schools and courts <br/>
are just making it so much worse there.  They put kids in potentially <br/>
dangerous situations when they send them to juvenile hall for a week or two <br/>
and then who is going to undo the damage if the kid has something really bad <br/>
happen to him while he&#39;s in there?  <br/>
     Anyway, thanks for your thoughts.  I am really bothered by this and yet <br/>
there&#39;s a part of me that feels guilty because when it comes down to it, it&#39;s <br/>
not MY child who may be hauled off to juvenile hall, so how bad can things <br/>
really be for me?  Does that make any sense?  It&#39;s Ricky who&#39;s really at risk <br/>
here.  His parents aren&#39;t handling the situation very responsibly, either, <br/>
and it bothers me so much that he&#39;s the one who will have to pay for their <br/>
mistakes.  <br/>
    I guess it&#39;s just really frustrating to want so much to really do <br/>
something that MATTERS and then to feel so ineffective at times.  <br/>

     He is in an independent study program through a private school.  I <br/>
talked to the school district and they said that they would not allow him to <br/>
go on theirs, that if he returns to their district, he absolutely has to <br/>
serve 120 days at the county alternative school.  (This is not associated <br/>
with the 120 days at camp we were worried about before; that was the juvenile <br/>
justice system and this is the school district.)  I explained to them that <br/>
this would be a way for them to receive funding for him still but they said <br/>
it was not an option.  <br/>
     I have written a statement to the probation officer, as he asked for, <br/>
and Ricky has met with him and he seems to be a very caring, reasonable <br/>
person.  He said he will recommend 6 monthes of informal probation and that <br/>
he will consider leaving him in this independent study program although he <br/>
normally doesn&#39;t like independent study.  He said the cases he works with <br/>
normally put their kids on independent study, work all day and leave them <br/>
alone, and then the kids get into trouble with no supervision and don&#39;t seem <br/>
to learn anything.  Ricky&#39;s mom doesn&#39;t work and I tried to explain as best <br/>
as I could why I feel it is important to leave him on this program so it may <br/>
work.  The probation officer also said that he feels this is a minor offense <br/>
and that he does feel the schools are going overboard in their ways of <br/>
handling some of these things, so that was kind of heartening.<br/>
     Thanks for the ideas.  Sorry to everyone if I sounded so negative in my <br/>
last post.  I&#39;m feeling better now and things look more hopeful for my nephew <br/>
so maybe the effort will have been worthwhile.<br/>

     Thanks for your kind words.  I agree with your observation above.   I <br/>
think much of public school is a merry-go-round of one sort or another.  I <br/>
hope they let him just stay with what he&#39;s doing.  I think homeschooling is <br/>
the best way to get off the ride.<br/>
