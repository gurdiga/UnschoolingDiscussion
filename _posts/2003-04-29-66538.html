&gt; subject, cost more than $600, ten years ago. More than $600 for a <br/>

&gt; was a bunch of malarky.*********<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Geesh..you are absolutely on the mark there...we tried Alpha Omega too, the<br/>

child. I anticipate that 83.47% of Unschoolers will choose to use this <br/>
curriculum, which consists of newsprint workbooks -- of blank pages.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know how many you want to order.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nah.  Too many unschooling kids are doers rather than readers and writers.<br/>
&gt; My estimate would be closer to 71.635%<br/>
&gt; <br/>

learners package.... It will be a bit more expensive, as it includes a jump <br/>
rope.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87907117">As a vendor who was at the Unschooling Conference in South Carolina <br/>
last year, I had to change the subject line to match the question and <br/>
comments people have been making.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Vendors&quot; can definitely have a place at an unschooling conference. <br/>
Pre-packaged &quot;curriculum vendors&quot; are another matter, and aren&#39;t as <br/>
likely to receive a warm welcome from most unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We prefer to think of ourselves as a resource vendor and definitely <br/>
not a curriculum vendor.<br/>
