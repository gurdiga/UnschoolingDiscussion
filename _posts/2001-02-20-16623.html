<br/>
I need advice on hand held electronic games.  My son needs one for a<br/>
long trip to South Dakota with grandparents this summer.  I looked at a<br/>
Game Boy, but wasn&#39;t happy with games I saw.  Any ideas?<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Karen&#39;s post reminded me :-)&nbsp; We have 
electronic Yahtzee, Uno, Poker, Solitaire, Wheel of Fortune, used to have chess 
and GIn Rummy, don&#39;t know what happened to them.&nbsp; My mother lives in 
Illinois and when she comes to visit she has a new game for her long flight 
which the kids pinch.&nbsp; She goes home with some nice magazines to read!  
Some of them you can play with other people which is nice but the best thing 
about all of them is the Sound Off button. :-)</font></div>

more) aren&#39;t a good use of funds when you can get a gameboy with modular <br/>
games.</div>

I agree with Sandra that a unit with modular games is more cost <br/>
effective.  I have GameBoys for my children, and they&#39;re only allowed <br/>
to use them when we&#39;re in the car.  We have Monopoly, Chessmaster, <br/>
Elmo&#39;s ABCs and Elmo&#39;s 123 for the more educational games, but there <br/>
are a lot of interesting strategy games out there as well.  I don&#39;t <br/>
allow anything with violence, so the other games they have are Super <br/>
Breakout (which is like the old Pong), Mickey&#39;s Racing Game (Mickey <br/>
and friends race through Walt Disney World), Wild Thornberries (I <br/>
love their homeschooling, traveling, animal adventures, although I&#39;d <br/>
like to see them leave Debbie and her bad attitude at home), Matchbox <br/>
Construction Zone, Pokemon PacMan (I hate Pokemon, but it&#39;s just a <br/>
different version of PacMan), and Super Mario Brothers.<br/>
<br/>
You can also get previously owned games at www.half.com and other <br/>
websites, which make them even cheaper!  New games are as much as $30 <br/>
each, but you can get them on sale for $20, and used ones at flea <br/>
markets for $5-10 or online for the same plus shipping and handling.<br/>
