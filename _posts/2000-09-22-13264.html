<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680640969">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I was just reading a book about the controversy over compulsory<br/>
vaccination for children - &quot;The Vaccine Guide, Making An Informed<br/>
Choice&quot; by Randall Neustaedter OMD. Was wondering what this group thinks<br/>
of the issue. <br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to post this question, because it is a controversial topic,<br/>
but well, so is unschooling... anyway if this has been hashed out before<br/>
and decided to be off-topic, please let me know and I&#39;ll look in the<br/>
archives. <br/>
<br/>
I figured that it IS on topic, because the main reason vaccination is<br/>
&quot;compulsory&quot; is because it is required (usually) for admission to public<br/>
schools. So, without that particular hassle, do you decide to vaccinate<br/>
your children anyway? If so, is it an &quot;informed&quot; decision or have you<br/>
even thought about it? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even quite sure what I&#39;m trying to ask here... I guess just that<br/>
if you have an opinion, I&#39;m curious to know what it is, and why. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Yes it is controversial.  HS does remove the &quot;problem&quot; of dealing with <br/>
questions from schools.  Here in Canada, vax is not required by law, or to <br/>
attend a school.  Our son only had the tetanus when he was older.  This is a <br/>
less- reactive vaccine.  Terrible though, making him get a needle at almost <br/>
3.  I&#39;ll never do that again!<br/>

<br/>
We also are leery of vaccinations.  Our son has only had tetanus shots.  I<br/>
was concerned because of my history of autoimmune problems which began at 18<br/>
months.  As it turns out my son is affected by a genetic disorder, but is<br/>
much healthier than I was at his age.  It&#39;s one of those things we&#39;ll never<br/>
know- would he have fared worse w/ the vaccines or would there be no<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>
My son has a speech delay and many of the parents I&#39;ve encountered have<br/>
concerns with the MMR shot and its relation to PDD &/or autism.  My son does<br/>
not have this dx, but many with speech delays do.<br/>
<br/>
Our biggest problem has been finding Drs. that accept our decision.  We went<br/>
to a MD who practiced Homeopathy for a while, but found the quality of care<br/>
overall lacking.  Now we have a Ped. who is ok with us, but she&#39;s no longer<br/>
on our insurance plan and we fear looking for a new Dr.  In Missouri we can<br/>
declare a religious exemption for the schools, so that&#39;s not what brings us<br/>
to homeschooling- just our unorthodox attitude in general.<br/>
<br/>
BTW- this is one of those issues where I can understand both sides, I never<br/>
try to change anyone else&#39;s opinion, and I am quite wary of discussing this<br/>
topic with most people.  Shortly before I became pregnant my new kitten<br/>
almost died from a vaccine reaction, this caused me to begin my research and<br/>
ultimately led us to the decision we&#39;ve made.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764530509">I can tell you about Hep A & B which I wouldn&#39;t touch with a ten foot pole.<br/>
 They were tested without the knowledge of the parents on Native American<br/>
children and Alaskan Native children.  Both these groups are experiencing<br/>
neurological problems that have never been seen in either of these groups<br/>
before.  Also, they have absolutely no idea how long these vaccines last.<br/>
<br/>
Further, CDC&#39;s own guidelines for Hep B are contradictory to the all out<br/>
push to vaccinate every child in the U.S.  And, it is interesting that more<br/>
children have died from the vaccine than died from Hep B.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988885364">Some yes, some no.  I won&#39;t vaccinate for social reasons, i.e., &#39;let&#39;s <br/>
vaccinate for diseases they&#39;ll be exposed to as a teenager, because all teens <br/>
have sex and we want to be sure and get everyone, so we&#39;ll start when they <br/>
are babies&#39;.  Nope, not in our family.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond that, we look at the likelihood of actually being exposed to a <br/>
particular disease, the risks to the child from the vaccine vs risks from <br/>
disease and go from there.  For example ds is 12.  As an infant he was <br/>
vaccinated for MMR (before I even thought to argue about it).  The risk of <br/>
bad results from catching any of these diseases increases pretty <br/>
significantly for older children/adults, so we will continue that series.<br/>
<br/>
I always keep vaccinations up to date for tetanus.  It is a disease that is <br/>
around today, with real potential to exposure.  Also, the disease itself has <br/>
a high incidence of death or paralysis.  Compared to the risks of the <br/>
immunization, it makes sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
To continue polio vaccines makes no sense to me.  I realize polio vaccine was <br/>
quite a breakthrough and the original development of this vaccine spared lots <br/>
of people their lives or life long disability.  In fact, my SIL had polio and <br/>
still has some residual effects of the disease.  However, polio is not a <br/>
disease we are likely to be exposed to, so the vaccine risk is too high.  <br/>
Were there a major epidemic, I would look again at this decision.  <br/>
(unfortunately, ds has already received this one, too...way back when...)<br/>
<br/>
The biggest reason I don&#39;t vaccinate is a personal belief that all these <br/>
vaccinations are harming the individual and society.  I believe the process <br/>
of vaccinations actually disable the immune system, leaving the body more <br/>
disease prone either from contagious illness or injury from the vaccine.  <br/>
It&#39;s a gut level reaction.  I&#39;ve seen some studies and articles on the <br/>
subject which explained it much better than that but for me it came down to a <br/>
gut reaction.  When I have researched the subject or read articles pro or <br/>
con, I come away consistently feeling it is not right for me or my children.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting side note is that I&#39;m having major health problems.  It <br/>
appears that I have an auto-immune dysfunction which is hereditary and <br/>
metabolic.  The metabolic part effects how my body processes everything, <br/>
including vaccines or medications.  My children appear to have inherited this <br/>
disease from me.  I am convinced we would be in even worse shape if we had <br/>
all the recommended vaccinations.  <br/>
<br/>
My church does not have a stand against vaccinations, but, because it is a <br/>
&#39;gut&#39; reaction for me, I have never hesitated to declare exemption due to <br/>
religious reasons.  <br/>
<br/>

Hi Nicle,<br/>
Our family has chosen to vaccinate against everything but varicella for dd<br/>
#3 (we didn&#39;t need to for dds 1 & 2 because they had chicken pox naturally).<br/>
IMO, I think it&#39;s too risky to not vaccinate against more serious diseases.<br/>
YMMV. Good luck in your decision making.<br/>

&gt; thinks of the issue. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dh and I are pretty much pro-vaccination.  *However* we have <br/>
delayed the vaccinations with our children until they are at a point <br/>
where we feel their immune systems can build and so that we can <br/>
know if they have any allergens that may put them in a risk factor <br/>
for certain vaccines.  Part of our reasoning is based on personal <br/>
family experience.  My grandmother lost 2 children to diptheria.  <br/>
My MIL and an aunt both were severely handicapped by polio.  <br/>
When we do start vaccinations we do it on *our* terms.  We have <br/>
our child get *one* vaccination at a time (none of this 3 or 4 <br/>
different things to fight off at the same time) and we wait at least a <br/>
month between vaccinations.  Our son has some developmental <br/>
delays and so we have decided to forgo the MMR until he has <br/>
shown more progess in his speech and motor skills.  Following this <br/>
method our children have been completely vaccinated by the time <br/>
they are 5.  The only vaccination we haven&#39;t done yet is the Hep. B. <br/>
 We figure that our children aren&#39;t at a risk factor for this disease <br/>
yet and our doctor agrees and doesn&#39;t recommend the full series <br/>
until children are teens.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people think that we are torturing our children by having <br/>
them at the doctor&#39;s so much to be &quot;poked&quot; but they have no ill-<br/>
feelings about going to the doctor.  They are only in pain for a little <br/>
while (we use homeopathic remedy to help eliminate the injection <br/>
pain quickly) and we figure the little bit of time that they are in pain <br/>
is worth the benefit of helping to ward off these diseases that are <br/>
so horrible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was 14 I got Chicken Pox for the first time.  We had all thought I had it before when I was 3, but apparently that was just really bad measles.  I have always had a weakened immune system from depression, stress and other physical factors, and I was always a sickly kid.  But getting the Chicken Pox when I was 14 was one of the worst times I have ever been sick in my life.  It&#39;s a wonder I am not horribly scarred, as every doctor we saw said it was the worst case they had ever seen, and I had those blisters EVERYWHERE!  In my ears, bottoms of my feet, under my hair, everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I very nearly died.  I have been that sick before a few times and been hospitalized for it, and very nearly died before, but what made this the worst was that I was sick for 10 whole weeks solid.  It took 8 weeks before I began to show any signs of recovery, and another two weeks for me to get back enough strength to move around, walk, and begin to function again and put back some of the weight and muscle tissue I had lost.<br/>
<br/>
What has this got to do with vaccinations?  Well I had my Chicken Pox vaccination, and it didn&#39;t do me a damn bit of good.<br/>

Whoa Nanci, how long ago was this that you were vaccinated? Has the vaccine<br/>
been around that long? Was it given to you because of your weakened immune<br/>
system?<br/>
<br/>
When my two older daughters and their cousins had chickenpox, it was really<br/>
something. They had it _everywhere_: in their ear canals, in their noses,<br/>
down their throat, in their private parts, even one on an eyeball. Since<br/>
they were so young, between 1 and 5, there wasn&#39;t any permanent scarring. It<br/>
was a really tough couple of weeks, though.<br/>

arguments, read the articles, discussed it with many people including health <br/>
professionals and families who choose a different course, and we have chosen <br/>
to continue vaccinating our children.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;m concerned about is that the more people choose not to <br/>
vaccinate, the risk to the unvaccinated children (and adults) goes up.  If <br/>
90% of people vaccinate, the risk of the disease exposure is small.  If 75% <br/>
of people vaccinate, the risk is greater.  <br/>
<br/>
If everyone decided not to vaccinate, would we be taking our children to the <br/>
doctor for polio treatments instead of innoculations?  As things stand now, <br/>
it seems that unvaccinated people are protected from disease only because <br/>
most of their neighbors are vaccinated.  When I was a kid (40 years ago), my <br/>
mom never had me vaccinated for smallpox, which we don&#39;t even do now, anyway. <br/>
 But at that time, smallpox was a real threat.  She kept promising the school <br/>
officials she&#39;d have it done, but she never did.  Her reasoning was that I <br/>
didn&#39;t need it because everyone else had one, so the risk of contracting <br/>
smallpox from the vaccination was greater than the risk from exposure.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, there are people who have serious reactions to these vaccintations <br/>
and thank goodness they have the freedom to forego them.  But no one in our <br/>
family has ever had a reaction, thank goodness.  I&#39;m sure that colors my <br/>
reasoning.  But I will continue to vaccinate to protect my children from what <br/>
could very well be devestating diseases.  <br/>

Anyway, i was aware of my mistake almost immediately after I hit the send button.  Damned cyber delays...(mutter mutter)<br/>
<br/>
But I did have previous exposure to it for sure, from my brother and others.  It didn&#39;t save me from having an almost fatal case of Chicken Pox. Would the vaccine have offered more exposure, or &quot;better&quot; exposure, and would it have been sufficient to save me from the pain and suffering?  Who knows...?<br/>

topic).  It just causes me deep down distrust.<br/>
<br/>
Because of that distrust, I&#39;ll only get the vaccinations I feel comfortable <br/>
about.  I wish I had a more scientific method.  It sometimes leaves me <br/>
feeling unsettled to examine my motives/reasons.  Fortunately (maybe <br/>
unfortunately...?  &lt;bg&gt;),  my gut reactions have proven pretty good many more <br/>
times than not.<br/>
<br/>
I join you in appreciation for the freedom to make the choice that is right <br/>
for the individual.  We have different needs even within our family.  DH has <br/>
been vaccinated for everything and then some.  Eight years in the military on <br/>
mobility assignments and then a civilian job overseas saw to that.  His <br/>
health is strong and it doesn&#39;t seem to have hurt him any.  OTOH, I&#39;ll bet if <br/>
I had the same vaccinations, I&#39;d be even sicker than I am now.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I will do is fight for the right of the individual to make the <br/>
choice.  Freedom is messy.  With it comes responsibility.  That includes the <br/>
impact my choices have on the people around me and vice versa.  Mandating or <br/>
legislating some things simply should not be done.  IMO, vaccines are one of <br/>
those things.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I really am appreciating this discussion.  It can be a heated topic.  <br/>
I&#39;m learning more from it.  Thanks to all that are participating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632695697">It has been around a while, they wanted to give it to son #4 and I said no.<br/>
 He&#39;s almost 17 now and he was about 2 then.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as to NA&#39;s needing to have the vaccines, well, that was then and this<br/>
is now.  Yes, no one had any immunities to the disease when it was first<br/>
brought over, but it has been here for a few hundred years now and once<br/>
someone/groups is exposed and some survive the disease and the have<br/>
children, the body adjusts.<br/>
<br/>
I am NA, my relatives, grand&#39;s, great&#39;s etc. all were and they all survived<br/>
CP as did I.  I have one scar on my forehead.  The kidlets all got them and<br/>
measles and roseola and mumps.  One child got one scar but that was from<br/>
measles.<br/>
<br/>
The other difference between now and then and other countries is sanitation<br/>
and knowledge.  We know a lot more about these things, have better<br/>
antiseptic methods and know more about what to do and expect.<br/>

Also our &#39;freedom&#39; to choose in this case is not very strong in many states.<br/>

to really make changes, such as replacing mercury & other toxic contaminants<br/>
that are now part of many vaccines.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are the theories that disease has some role to play in the world,<br/>
and as we eradicate one, another shows up to replace.  Epidemics come and go<br/>
throughout history and there is some evidence that the  polio epidemic was<br/>
dying out on its own at time the vaccine for it was introduced.  I&#39;m just<br/>
throwing out some of the concerns I have read over the years.  Unfortunately<br/>
it&#39;s difficult to find information that is not on one extreme of the issue<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t quite grasp your argument.  Living in a society means that at times, <br/>
the group takes precedence over an individual&#39;s needs.  But I don&#39;t think <br/>
that is the case here.  In my state, children are only required to be <br/>
vaccinated when they enroll in public school.  If parents choose not to <br/>
vaccinate, there are other options.  Like private school, religious <br/>
exemptions, medical exemptions, homeschooling.  And, I&#39;ve known a number of <br/>
families who chose those options.  My freedom to homeschool is not affected, <br/>
as far as I can tell, because I chose to vaccinate my children.<br/>
<br/>
I did choose to vaccinate my children because I choose to live in this <br/>
society.   I believe that until certain diseases are erradicated (and maybe <br/>
not even then), my children are at risk of contracting those diseases.  For <br/>
our family, the risk of the diseases is worse than the risks associated with <br/>
the vaccines.  I also recognize that when we vaccinate our children, we help <br/>
protect those who are unvaccinated, which is fine by us.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess when it comes down to it, the hype put out by the medical community, <br/>
including the pharmeceutical companies, makes more sense to me than the hype <br/>
put out by the anti-vaccination contingent.  On a more personal level, I also <br/>
trust my pediatrician and my nurse-practitioner.  They&#39;ve done well by us for <br/>
8 years.<br/>

Why?  Because it has been shown before, it&#39;s not possible to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100822392">What she said was the same arguments are used against homeschooling as are<br/>
used by folks who are against not vaccinating not that vaccinations and<br/>
homeschooling had anything to do with each other.<br/>
<br/>
Having worked in the medical field for more years than I care to count, I<br/>
can tell you first hand that most doctors/DO&#39;s/FNPs/PAs, etc. do NOT look<br/>
further than what they are given by the drug companies.  The few that<br/>
investigate and look to see what is really going on are labeled as &quot;nuts,&quot;<br/>
or &quot;fanatics.&quot;  So to &quot;trust&quot; in what you are being told by the average FNP<br/>
is to take the drug companies as gospel.<br/>
<br/>
And, please remember, these are the same companies that said that using<br/>
sheep infected with scrapie wouldn&#39;t cause BSE in cattle.  Yeah right and<br/>
now all of Europe is under seige because of mad cow disease!  Now these<br/>
same companies are saying &quot;but it shouldn&#39;t have crossed the species<br/>
barrier.&quot;<br/>

say that it didn&#39;t have anything to do with the schools, and it didn&#39;t at <br/>
that time.  We were homeschooling because our son couldn&#39;t function in a <br/>
classroom with his sensory integration problems.  I didn&#39;t want people to <br/>
think that I was dissing public schools.  But after so many years, now, and <br/>
lots of consideration, and reading, I have come to believe that the public <br/>
school system, and really any school system, is fundamentally flawed.  I <br/>
really want to say this to a few people I know whose kids are  just starting <br/>
in the school system, but I&#39;m too chicken.  I pray that we will never be <br/>
forced to put our children in anything more organized than ice skating <br/>
lessons or co-op classes.<br/>
<br/>
Now, it will be just my luck that my kids will WANT to go to school.  <br/>
