<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081629076">We decided this year to join a local children&#39;s museum that participates in <br/>
the Association of Children&#39;s Musuems and the ASTC (Science and technology <br/>
centers I think it stands for) reciprocal membership programs.  For $100 at the <br/>
one museum, we get to go to tons of museums all over the nation for the next <br/>
year.  Although we won&#39;t be travelling all over the nation this year, we will <br/>
find our way to quite a few in our state and neighboring states.  Now if they <br/>
only had a reciprocal membership program to the zoos and aquariums near us as <br/>
well...  Both programs have web sites which list all participating museums!  <br/>
Worth checking out as so many museum admissions are at least $5 per person!<br/>

Every year we get a family membership from a small children&#39;s museum <br/>
more than 50 miles from our home for $40 and use it at tons of other <br/>
science centers/museums.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248302728">Thanks for posting this.  It says that the deal excludes museums <br/>
within 90 miles of the one you become a member at unless they <br/>
mutually agree to lift the restrictions. I&#39;m waiting for the museums <br/>
in my area to open and answer the phone so I can ask them about their <br/>
local restrictions and whether or not they have been lifted. This is <br/>
a great way to use some of the money that we received for Christmas :)<br/>
<br/>
We usually just go to the museums around here on their free admission <br/>
day once a month. Sometimes our other plans conflict though, and it <br/>
would be great to be able to go whenever we want to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494310196">Thanks for helping me think outside of the box Tracy. After I called <br/>
the three museums in my local area and found that they didn&#39;t <br/>
reciprocate with one another at all, or only offered disounted <br/>
admission, I read this post again and realized that I should just buy <br/>
one at a museum farther away! I called the Reuben H. Fleet Museum in <br/>
San Diego and they reciprocate with all of my local museums since <br/>
they are more than 90 miles away...one of them only by .02 miles <br/>
according to Mapquest...lol. I&#39;m so excited!!! Thanks again :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474568052">Exactly!  :)  I ended up choosing to support a tiny children&#39;s museum <br/>
in a lower income town with our yearly membership, but it&#39;s not likely <br/>
we&#39;ll make it over there for a visit to that particular one.<br/>

<br/>
Shop your memberships.  Go online and order a membership in a museum in the <br/>
ATSC in another city that costs less.  (The Pink Palace Museum in Memphis costs <br/>
$65/year.  Kennedy Space & Rocket center cost us $100.)  Then you can use <br/>
your membership card at your nearby museum as if you were a member.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer to support my local museum, but if money is an issue, <br/>
memberships can be had more cheaply.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000570517">Also lots of memberships are almost completely tax deductable. I <br/>
just purchased a family membership to the Monteray Aquarium. It was <br/>
85. , 75. of that being tax deductable.<br/>
