But you know the old saying &quot;you can lead a horse to water but you can&#39;t<br/>
make<br/>
him drink.&quot;  I guess you could change that and say &quot;you can lead a child to<br/>
school but you can&#39;t make him think.&quot;<br/>

Hey, that&#39;s cool! Can I quote that on my unschooling page?? ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781744053">Just found a great quote from the HEM newsletter and wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I suppose it is because nearly all children go to school nowadays and have <br/>
things arranged for them that they seem so forlornly unable to produce their <br/>
own ideas.&quot;<br/>

and it&#39;s knowing how to use the information you get.&quot;<br/>
