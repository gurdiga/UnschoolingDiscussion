<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115592343">My son is interested in making simple computer programs - mazes, <br/>
movable guys, games, stuff like that.  I am TOTALLY ignorant in this <br/>
field and need help finding an easy-to-understand type book or cdrom <br/>
(or both) that I could get for him.  (beginners guide?)  He does not <br/>
like to read too much, but will read a lot when it comes to things <br/>
he is really interested in.  He is only 11 but really understands <br/>
computers; knows how to take them apart, identify the parts, fix <br/>
smaller problems, etc.  It&#39;s really quite scary :o)<br/>
Any ideas, tips, advice, books, cdroms, kids websites, etc. that you <br/>
all can share with me?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!!!<br/>

I think it&#39;s $50. I&#39;ve also seen it occasionally in the Scholastic catalog.<br/>
(There&#39;s actually a link on the website to Scholastic.) (It&#39;s available for<br/>
the Mac and that other machine too ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very easy to use and has some excellent tutorials that will walk him<br/>
through the basics right up to some fairly advanced stuff.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also used Multimedia Fusion which I think she said she liked better<br/>
but it&#39;s only for the PC. And I don&#39;t know if they have any tutorials.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard many people mention DarkBasic and I think there&#39;s a fair amount<br/>
of support out there for it so if he runs into problems he might be able to<br/>
find others who can help.<br/>

But I think it&#39;s a lot more powerful and might be a good next step if he<br/>
likes one of the above.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505667060">Thanks Joyce, that gives us a great start, Tylor is so excited. <br/>
Stagecast seems a little easy for him, the demos were not to <br/>
impressive in his eyes .. do you know if a programming language is <br/>
used?  Or, can you tell me a little more about the process of making <br/>
something simple? It seemed like DarkBasic would be more his style, <br/>
it has the actual Basic programming language in it. Although he is <br/>
only 11, I know he is quite capable of learning this stuff, it&#39;s me <br/>
who does not understand.  :o)<br/>
Does anyone else have experience with DarkBasic?<br/>
Thanks again!!<br/>
Joanne<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. The cleverness of the program is that you can write programs entirely<br/>
by moving objects around and then writing some rules for behavior. Or you<br/>
can mess around with the list of rules which is sort of programming lite. Or<br/>
you can get deep into it and modify the code it&#39;s written or write code<br/>
yourself which has actual if-then statements and variables.<br/>
<br/>
There might still be a free demo download for Stagecast. The one we<br/>
downloaded ages ago limited you to three objects.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn said she didn&#39;t see a programming language for the Fusion software.<br/>
She just moved things around and it wrote &quot;pictures&quot; like<br/>
object-arrow-object to show moving something from one place to another. But<br/>
she said maybe you could get beneath that layer and there was a language<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
But both Stagecast and Multimedia Fusion design 2D environment and DarkBasic<br/>
will design 3D environments. The DarkBasic looks way cooler :-) but of<br/>
course way cooler usually translates into more complex. But if he&#39;s really<br/>
motivated that won&#39;t be a deterrent.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there&#39;s a demon for DarkBasic?<br/>
