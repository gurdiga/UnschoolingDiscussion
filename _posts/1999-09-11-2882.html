&gt; Teresa,�<br/>
&gt; We live in central GA, way back in the country.� We are surrounded on 3<br/>
&gt; sides by wooded areas and the other by a large open field.� My son can get<br/>
&gt; out and play, whoop and holler all he wants and no one but his parents know<br/>
&gt; or care.� We have 3 dogs, several chickens and we raise quail.� We all love<br/>
&gt; the country life.� Just walking to our mail box and back is a nature walk.<br/>
&gt; God Bless You�<br/>

I live in between Scott and Adrian.  The nearest larger towns are Dublin<br/>
and Swainsboro.  I am about an equal distance for both.  I am about an 65<br/>
miles or so southeast of Macon. How far south of Atlanta are you?<br/>
