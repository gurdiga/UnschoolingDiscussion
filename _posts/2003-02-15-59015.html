<div id="ygrps-yiv-553918719"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;So basically there are no legitimate reasons why someone might have trouble<br/>
&gt;unschooling to the degree that you do?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What legitimate reasons are  you thinking of? It&#39;s always easier to talk <br/>
about real situations. Do you have a situation that makes you believe you <br/>
are unable to unschool with your kids?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe I just don&#39;t get this all perfect or nothing sense... maybe I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt;too new at it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think it has to do with perfect. Geez, I&#39;d never be able to do it <br/>
then. ;-) But there is a great amount of letting go of preconceived <br/>
notions-the ones we don&#39;t even realize we have-that makes unschooling much <br/>
more accessable than people would like to think. So each time someone  posts <br/>
with a &quot;but what about...&quot; we go in and explore (sometimes uncomfortably) <br/>
those notions.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not smugness. It&#39;s not my way or the highway. It&#39;s more of a &quot; been <br/>
through that, overcame that.&quot; You can disagree or be uncomfortable with what <br/>
some of us are saying, but it doesn&#39;t change the results we see in ourselves <br/>
and our families.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
