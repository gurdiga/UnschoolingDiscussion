<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725335217">Today I have not left our property.  I&#39;ve watered the yard, worked on  <br/>
webpages (SCA and unschooling both), done a bunch of laundry, cooked,  <br/>
talked to my dad&#39;s cousin in Odessa, Texas where it&#39;s 104 degrees and  <br/>
a backhoe that was supposed to dig a 14&quot; trench just tore out her  <br/>
sewer line that&#39;s 30&quot; down...  It&#39;s a drain line from a septic tank.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah!  The story is of how much I know about what others are doing  <br/>
today without having left my house.<br/>
<br/>
Keith is watching a movie in back, which probably  means Keith is  <br/>
asleep (he had fighter practice and then went to a friend&#39;s swimming  <br/>
party and cook-out, so lots of exercise and sun and heat).<br/>
<br/>
Holly JUST called, as I was typing about Keith.  She and her  <br/>
boyfriend are going to house-sit another place tonight, where there&#39;s  <br/>
a dog that can&#39;t be kenneled because it&#39;s lacking a shot.  She called  <br/>
to see where Marty is.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is with Brett Henry, at some other party after fighter practice  <br/>
(where he was with Keith until two-ish).  What Holly really wanted to  <br/>
know is whether Marty was at work, to help them decide whether to eat  <br/>
there on the way to Placitas where they&#39;re staying.  I said no,  <br/>
Marty&#39;s not at work, but Sadie is working tonight (same restaurant,  <br/>
and Sadie is someone else Holly has recently watched dogs and house  <br/>
for).<br/>
<br/>
The reason I know Sadie is at work is she went to the party where  <br/>
Keith was instead of going with Marty and Brett, because she needed  <br/>
to go to work and thought a swim would be good.<br/>
<br/>
So there.<br/>
<br/>
Without going anywhere, I did a whole lot, and I know the general  <br/>
details of what seven other people have done today and are doing.  I  <br/>
haven&#39;t heard from Kirby, but he&#39;s working today, and it&#39;s about the  <br/>
time of his second break.<br/>
<br/>
I feel kinda like part of the borg.<br/>
<br/>

a connection with someone here if i am not mistaken  :-)<br/>

-i did 3 loads of washing and hung it in garden<br/>
-weeded and put compost on veg patch.  and watered.<br/>
-had 3 friends of children over to play<br/>
-dd (7)read brownie book over phone to friend and ds(4) made numbers<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-89627752"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -hoovered<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you really hoover with a &quot;Hoover&quot; or did you just use that phrase?  It reminded me of how <br/>
my grandmother always called the refrigerator the &quot;Fridgidaire.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -we have to be up for a ceildah in the morning <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is a ceilidah a dance, or is there singing, etc.?  I googled the word, and it seems like one of <br/>
those events that may be different depending on whether it is in Scotland or the United <br/>
States.<br/>
 <br/>

Albuquerque is portrayed by Utah in those movies.  &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s still  <br/>
fun, the thought...<br/>
