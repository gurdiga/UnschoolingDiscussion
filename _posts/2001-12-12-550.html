<div id="ygrps-yiv-498157446">Odd subject for this list, I know. <br/>
<br/>
My homeschool group is actively talking about this subject a lot these days. <br/>
I think Zoe, 12, is interested in taking some kind of test. She has a good <br/>
friend who is doing accelerated work in many areas and has already taken a <br/>
bunch of tests. I am totally uninterested in her taking any sort of test <br/>
ever. But if she really wants to? And if I know she&#39;s thinking about it, is <br/>
it wise to give her the info about these tests?  We&#39;ve talked about it some - <br/>
I stress how the tests are limited sources of information. <br/>
<br/>
I want to do what she wants, but I fear that having a numerical score will <br/>
leave an indelible &quot;feeling&quot; in her about her intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Whaddya think?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are some tests given to teachers to demonstrate that tests don&#39;t do <br/>
what they purport to do.  One is a reading test where the letters aren&#39;t real <br/>
letters.  (That one&#39;s more about reading and decoding.)  One is an oldie but <br/>
maybe still available, about cultural literacy--questions which WON&#39;T be on <br/>
the test, but could have been--about Midwestern farming, and inner-city <br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I remember there being a section on a test once about subway schedules or <br/>
some such.  I lived in a town without even a taxi, let alone a bus or train.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to find them, but would start with google.com and maybe <br/>
enter something like tests about testing and see what pops up.<br/>
<br/>
If you discuss some of the arguments against it, and maybe show her the worst <br/>

gifted class, or Mensa folk who will only marry within &quot;their IQ&quot; and believe <br/>
anything not tested on the SAT isn&#39;t real) it will help keep her from taking <br/>
it as seriously as some do.<br/>

to-do list.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want her to think that I didn&#39;t want her to take it because I <br/>
thought she might not do well, though, because that would make her think that <br/>
it actually MEANT something to me. So I&#39;d try to be casual (and forgetful) <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
FairTest.org is a great place to get good info about the problems with <br/>
standardized testing.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I&#39;d try buying the test myself and just let her take it - not send it <br/>
out to be graded, etc. There are some books in the regular bookstores that <br/>
have tests - just buy one of those since it has the grading key in it. <br/>
They&#39;re usually in the study skills section of the bookstore but I noticed <br/>
that here in California they&#39;ve moved the SAT9 (CA&#39;s statewide standardized <br/>
test) stuff into the children&#39;s section. So - you could just let her use a <br/>
sample test. It might satisfy her curiousity.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two things.  Alex took some online test which rated his grade level as<br/>
&quot;third grade.&quot;  He&#39;s 11, and should be in 5th, right?  He was very upset.<br/>
He&#39;s talked a lot about doing school at home, and I&#39;ve left it up to him to<br/>
figure out the curriculum :-)<br/>
<br/>
The other has to do with IQ testing.  When I was very young, our next door<br/>
neighbor was a psych major.  As part of a project, he tested me, my sister<br/>
and brother, and my mom and dad.  My mom would never say *exactly* what our<br/>
scores were, just that dad was lowest and she and the kids were all above<br/>
145.  She liked that.  (Dad was soon out of the picture, btw.)  I lived in<br/>
the shadow of that number all my life; I got the &quot;she&#39;s not working up to<br/>
her potential&quot; comment on my report cards.  I never understood why school<br/>
wasn&#39;t easy for me if I was so smart.<br/>
<br/>
I took an online IQ test the other day (the Internet is a *dangerous*<br/>
thing!).  My score was 113.  I&#39;m very happy with that, because now I&#39;m<br/>
working WAY above my potential &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also quickly realized how those kinds of tests fail.  A young child is<br/>
given a different type of test, right?  Not &quot;answer these written questions<br/>
in 22 seconds each.&quot;  As an adult, I have years of conditioning behind me.<br/>
I blanch at tests, particularly timed ones.  I have years of terror, brought<br/>
on by math word problems, or those logic problems about who is taller if<br/>
Roger is shortest and his brother is taller than George, you know? And those<br/>
ones that want you to figure out what goes next in a sequence -- I can<br/>
always find other things but never the one they want.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been schooled into stupidity.  School lowered my IQ.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
What about just getting something like an SAT test prep book and messing<br/>
with the tests in there?  Even though the age level isn&#39;t right, I might<br/>
prefer messing around to formally administering a test.  But I&#39;m<br/>
assumingher purpose is just curiousity about standardized tests.  If<br/>
your daughter really, really wants to &quot;measure&quot; herself, then I don&#39;t<br/>
know what to suggest.<br/>
<br/>
There was a book written last year (I think) about the reasons the SAT<br/>
test was created and popularized.  There was a flurry of magazine<br/>
articles on the topic as well.  You and your daughter could find it<br/>
interesting to know more about this topic.  I think it would help see<br/>
the whole thing as more strange than scientific.<br/>

<br/>
Sadly, this is what she wants. <br/>
<br/>
I like Pam&#39;s suggestion about being forgetful, which is what I am anyway <br/>
&lt;gg&gt;. The reason I bring it up now is that my group may administer a test to <br/>
a bunch of kids at once. So she&#39;s going to hear about this from other kids <br/>
and may want to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Zoe is very linear. She likes to do every page in workbooks, and she likes <br/>
textbooks. She loves to take classes and would fill every day up to the brim <br/>
if we had the time and money. She wants to go to college ASAP and plans on <br/>
taking community college classes as soon as she is able. (Luckily, Quinn is <br/>
the complete opposite or I might think that old schooliness was rubbing off <br/>
from me &lt;g&gt;.) She&#39;s the kid we homeschool because she would be such a &quot;good <br/>
girl&quot; in school.<br/>
<br/>
Think I will get a practice test and see if that satisfies her somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all.<br/>

are the first easy targets for in depth discussion on there motivations, how<br/>
they are feed information, and what they do with your &quot;data.&quot;     How is it<br/>
used? By you? Your child? A boss? An administrator? A Lazy administrator?<br/>

made up these tests and why?     I would think that a look at the<br/>
credentials of the people who put together whatever test your child wants to<br/>
take would show a mindset and pedagogy vastly different from you and your<br/>
daughter or son. I would also discuss how committees function and how<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What is that quote? -A camel is a horse designed by committee-<br/>
<br/>
The concept is that in order to get a committee, a group, to agree on nearly<br/>
anything there must be compromise by at least some of its members. So no<br/>
matter how good or noble or fair or insightful each member of the committee<br/>
is, their individual strength or vision will be weakened in some manner in<br/>
order to facilitate agreement. The final product is rarely as strong or<br/>
economical as the original idea.<br/>
<br/>
For years I sat on the curriculum committee for a large university. With<br/>
each meeting I was amazed with how nearly every proposal got twisted and<br/>
changed to meet each members&#39; concerns. On occasion the changes were so<br/>
great or subtly odd, the person initiating the proposal withdrew it because<br/>
they didn&#39;t recognize it any longer.  Many of the changes were to make them<br/>
fit with the policies of the rest of the university. Others seemed to have<br/>
no logical basis and were often politically motivated. What ever the reason,<br/>
the committee seldom made the original idea more efficient and accurate.<br/>
<br/>
These interactions are present in groups of all sizes.  It should be easy to<br/>
illustrate this with your support or park day group. Where does the group of<br/>
adults sit? I&#39;m sure everyone has some opinion on the sun or shade or<br/>
benches or chairs, the view of the park or distance the play equipment.  How<br/>
does a group of your friends decide where to eat?    Or how about any number<br/>
of daily decisions you and your spouse make for the family or each other.<br/>
