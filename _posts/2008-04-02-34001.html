<div id="ygrps-yiv-1286383892">March was exceptionally busy on this list.  We had lots of new  <br/>
members, too.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t post &quot;Good idea!&quot; or &quot;Me too&quot; or &quot;Making a check list  <br/>
sounds like a good idea.Think i might<br/>
give it a try. &quot;  and then append a thousand words of someone else&#39;s  <br/>
writing (a whole post, or more).<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t thank anyone for anything, but if that&#39;s  <br/>
the ONLY thing you have to say, don&#39;t send it to the list.<br/>
<br/>
People on the list assume others will think their ideas are good and  <br/>
will try the things out.  So none of that needs to be written.<br/>
<br/>
IF YOU HAVE TO thank someone, then write more--write how and why it&#39;s  <br/>
going to be specifically helpful to you.  Tell us a story.  Each post  <br/>
that goes to the list (except this one) should ideally help many  <br/>
other people&#39;s unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The list won&#39;t always be so busy,   It settles down and wells up, and  <br/>
last month was an overflowing month.  Don&#39;t worry if it gets quiet.   <br/>
It will still be here.<br/>
