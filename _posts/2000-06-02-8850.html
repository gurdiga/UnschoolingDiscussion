<div id="ygrps-yiv-8937444">Todau, I was interviewd on Glenn Busby&#39;s NPR show &quot;The Best of Our Knowledge&quot; (Glenn is based in Albany, New York).  Don&#39;t know when it will be aired, though.<br/>
<br/>
Also, on Tuesday, Dan Skinner interviewed me live on WBAA, the NPR affiliate in Indiana -- did anyone hear it?  (I&#39;m wondering how it came over?)<br/>
