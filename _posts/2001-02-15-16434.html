<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157093368">heeh...tell her I think she&#39;s cool.<br/>
maybe she&#39;ll grow up to be a haute couture fashion<br/>
designer in paris....you never know.<br/>
that was my dream when I was younger...I&#39;d try and<br/>
work it so I could watch the &quot;fashion shows&quot; (couture)<br/>
AND cartoons on saturday mornings...usually had to<br/>
sacrifice one of them...sigh...at 12 my very &quot;hip&quot;<br/>
trendy friend who had to look just right usually was<br/>
frequently embarrassed by my coveralls with a beret or<br/>
cutting off one of my gauze pant legs and leaving the<br/>
other one long...so people could see my lace tights on<br/>
one side only...with black canvas shoes with no laces<br/>
and mismatched socks....<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on...&lt;BG&gt;...but I won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
At least she knows what she wants. :) That&#39;s gotta be<br/>
a good trait. <br/>
My mom was/is VERY conservative. hugely. We had our<br/>
share of &quot;disagreements&quot; when I was younger about my<br/>
slightly questionable attire.... in her mind she was<br/>
trying to save me embarrassment cuz she knew people<br/>
would say rude things and what not, even if I didn&#39;t<br/>
hear them...and well, we all want our kids to like the<br/>
things we like..it&#39;s heartwarming when you see it and<br/>
go &quot;aw. how sweet. she got that from me.&quot;... but<br/>
alas... my mom and I&#39;s fashion sense are on opposite<br/>
sides of the spectrum. She actually tells me she LIKES<br/>
some of my more toned down outfits now and otherwise<br/>
tries to quietly, quickly, and gently express her<br/>
opinions if she thinks maybe just maybe my lace<br/>
camisole &quot;isn&#39;t supposed to be showing like that&quot;....<br/>
I say &quot;yeah it is. I put it there. thanks, though.&quot;<br/>
and she laughs and if my dad were still around he<br/>
would say &quot;that&#39;s my wierd daughter. but I love her.&quot;<br/>

Problem with food colouring is that when it rains, out it comes! I bleach
my hair first to a white blonde and then use crazy colours. This is, however,
a bit permanent.
<br>Just bought some brown hair dye so I look &#39;normal&#39; for the US embassy.
Once I get my visa I shall dye my hair, skip back and grin at them :)
