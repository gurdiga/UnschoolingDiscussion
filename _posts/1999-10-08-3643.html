      Here is one quote that I pointedly remember, and it is what I was <br/>
talking about when I said that you didn&#39;t seem to think that Conservative <br/>
Christians could use Attachment Parenting.  After this quote you use it to <br/>
bring home your point of corporal punishment.  To me, that stresses that you <br/>
think corporal punishment is the only way Conservative Christians raise their <br/>
children, so as a Conservative Christian myself, I had to point out that it <br/>
was not true, as we use Attachment Parenting.<br/>
      However in your last answer to my post, you say that you have never <br/>
suggested such a thing.  This is just one of many quotes from you that do <br/>
suggest that very same thing.  If I went through my deleted mail, I could <br/>
find many more.  Anyway, I just wanted to clarify my reason for standing up <br/>
for those Christians who do us AP.<br/>
