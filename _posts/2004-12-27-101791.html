<div id="ygrps-yiv-901896346">Thanks for the fabulous links, Sandra -- yes, those were just what I <br/>
was asking for (forgot about the truck) and more! Thanks also for <br/>
clarifying the take on dysfunctional aftermath with the reference to <br/>
Al-Anon.  I wholeheartedly agree that it&#39;s important to find a <br/>
resource which can help one get to a place where they can see <br/>
themselves as empowered individuals and not victims.  Your voice of <br/>
reason seemed to be one crying in the wilderness for a moment there, <br/>
but I&#39;m thrilled to see Steph felt comfortable enough to join in the <br/>
discussion and confirm that she hasn&#39;t fallen prey to a victim <br/>
mentality.<br/>
<br/>
Retrouvaille sounds awesome (take the extra underscore out of the <br/>
address line if you click the link in the original message,) but if <br/>
Steph&#39;s husband is anything like mine -- getting him to a retreat <br/>
(especially one sponsored as a ministry) would be nigh impossible.  <br/>
I&#39;m also tandem nursing two toddlers, so even if I had someone to <br/>
take the other kids for the weekend, there would be no way to manage <br/>
it for us.  <br/>
<br/>
DH is also skeptical about communication &quot;techniques,&quot; although we <br/>
did have some success with the materials from the Stepfamily <br/>
Association in getting us over one particular rough spot with the <br/>
ex.  She promised to play along, but didn&#39;t, so we were only able to <br/>
improve communication with our son when he was with us (and he <br/>
eventually ended splitting time between us more frequently to avoid <br/>
dealing with the problems.)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that impressed me the most about CS and NVC is the fact <br/>
that both can be practiced with or without cooperation from others <br/>
(including dear hubby.)  In some ways they are similar to Al-Anon <br/>
and other programs focusing on various forms of self-reliance in <br/>
that they teach ways to see others&#39; problems separate from our own <br/>
and work from that mindset.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, CS & NVC show how to work from the standpoint of unity of <br/>
purpose and need with the idea that we are basically caring <br/>
individuals who have been educated away from a true understanding of <br/>
our Being.  It is possible to get back to that place and on our way <br/>
there, bring others along.  Bottom line is that healing takes place <br/>
within and radiates to touch others&#39; lives without. <br/>
<br/>
These two methods also hold great appeal to me in that they are <br/>
geared to the self-taught individual -- the online resources are <br/>
extensive, powerful, and effective for those who are ready and <br/>
willing to put in the effort to make it happen.  Here are the links <br/>
again for Steph and anyone else who might want to check it out:<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve been at this marriage & family business for the past twenty <br/>
years ourselves -- me helping raise my stepson from the age of three <br/>
and unschooling with him (part-time in the pre/teen years) and eight <br/>
of his siblings, the oldest of which is nearly nineteen now.  She <br/>
got up in the wee hours on Christmas morn to help me wrap presents <br/>
for one of the kids who had bemoaned the fact that we stopped <br/>
playing the holiday game years ago.  So, to change the subject...<br/>
<br/>
Dad picked up an artificial tree and we decorated it all month with <br/>
origami and other homemade ornaments, strung popcorn, etc.  I picked <br/>
up some wrapping paper and bows, and we broke out a big bin of <br/>
stored toys that hadn&#39;t been played with in a long while.  The <br/>
younger kids had never seen most of the stuff, and the older kids <br/>
got a kick out of unwrapping their old toys to show off to the <br/>
younger ones.  Ear to ear grins all around.  <br/>
<br/>
DH had picked up a chuck roast, potatoes, and carrots, so I got to <br/>
try out the new stoneware bowl for Christmas dinner.  He marinated <br/>
it the night before, so all I did was plop it in the bowl along with <br/>
the veggies, cover it with the baker and let it roast.  Rave reviews <br/>
from my often hard-to-please hubby (second time this week that I&#39;ve <br/>
received a compliment on my cooking -- I&#39;m now officially hooked on <br/>
stoneware -- those of you who are planning on roast next year are <br/>
invited to visit our PC site* and check it out!)<br/>
<br/>
No friends or relatives, just the family.  Grandma always sends <br/>
money in their birthday and Christmas cards (we&#39;ve been long-<br/>
distance from relatives who don&#39;t travel our way for most of our <br/>
married life,) so they pick up things throughout the year if they <br/>
want something special or there&#39;s a good sale going on.  We started <br/>
taking &quot;field trips&quot; and going out for a nice meal on special <br/>
occasions in lieu of stockpiling for the sake of gift-giving years <br/>
ago.  <br/>
<br/>
The kids make each other happies or present something of their own <br/>
that someone has admired, and seem genuinely happy with the way <br/>
things work for now.  That is, until the kid who had just about <br/>
decided we must be related to the Grinch came along.  When we <br/>
finally hit the hay that night, he whispered a sigh of thanks to us <br/>
for making a big fuss over Christmas, and I told him I was a little <br/>
worried that hand-me-down gifts might be a disappointment.  He <br/>
blithely commented that most of it was all new to him anyway, and <br/>
all-in-all, it was a really nice surprise.  I love the way <br/>
unschooling has given us the gift of flexibility and freedom to <br/>
think out of the box (pun intended :o)  <br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year, Everyone!<br/>
