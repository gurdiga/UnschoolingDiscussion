 </span></blockquote>Liam&#39;s GREAT!!!!  We were just talking &#39;bout you guys, ya know!  We <br/>
just got in from a gig.  I didn&#39;t fall *completely* off the face of <br/>
earth -- but, we&#39;ve been keeping our world pretty small.  I thought <br/>
we&#39;d be able to go to St. Louis last year, but we had some major <br/>
setbacks (like losing both old cars at the same time) and stuff like <br/>
that, and ... well... life goes on.  We&#39;re really doin&#39; okay now, and <br/>
looking to move a little further north.  Liam&#39;s yu-gi-oh-ing and <br/>
magic-ing and is just a glorious, brilliant person who I can&#39;t get enough of!<br/>
<br/>
If we can swing it, we&#39;re going to try to come to Peabody in May.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, I&#39;m finally able to start reading the list again.  It&#39;s been <br/>
*very* refreshing!<br/>
<br/>
Sending lots of love,<br/>
Marji<br/>
