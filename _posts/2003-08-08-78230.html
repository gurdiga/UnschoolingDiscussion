<div id="ygrps-yiv-501808947">I&#39;m feeling a little overwhelmed right now.  The public school week starts <br/>
in about 3 weeks in our state.  Last year, I homeschooled (schooled at home) <br/>
only my 15 yo son, and everyone else was in public school.  I pretty much just <br/>
got permission from the caseworker to homeschool our foster sons, I&#39;m pulling <br/>
our adopted son out of school, and my two daughters will be leaving public <br/>
school also.  We are to the point that everyone is OK with it.  Honestly, I think <br/>
they&#39;re all just glad they won&#39;t have to get up at 6:00 am and ride the bus <br/>
for an hour again. :o)  I have to send the letter of intent in before school <br/>
starts.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, I&#39;m finding myself looking at catalogs, Internet sites, garage sales, <br/>
wondering what to buy.  Because we have always been a school at home family, <br/>
we don&#39;t have many games other than the regular &quot;milton bradley type&quot; board <br/>
games.  I don&#39;t want to blow a bunch of money on stuff that will just sit.  I <br/>
also don&#39;t want to fall into buying a bunch of curriculum.  I REALLY want to do <br/>
this right.  If you were just beginning to unschool, knowing what you know <br/>
now, and you had some money to spend of fun, cool stuff, what would you buy?  <br/>
<br/>
Also, what would you do for a while?  Would you take a good while and see <br/>
what everyone wants to do?  Am I getting ready to be pulled like taffy into 6 <br/>
different directions? :oO  <br/>
<br/>
2 of my boys can barely read, and it means a LOT to them to be able to.  If <br/>
learning to read is what a child REALLY wants, would any of you get some sort <br/>
of aides or maybe computer games to help them with this?  Would you just read a <br/>
lot to them?<br/>
<br/>
Much appreciation in advance.  <br/>

copies at the conference for sale, so you can pick y&#39;all can pick one up <br/>
here! Thanks, Valerie!). I&#39;d also come to the conference---you can&#39;t buy that kind <br/>
of unschooling-learning/support/joy in any store! A lot of paper---lots and <br/>
lots of paper. Some really good, high-quality art supplies. A couple of hundred <br/>
dollars of Blockbuster gift certificates. Zoombini&#39;s computer games---one and <br/>
three (two&#39;s not as good!). A few new ethnic cookbooks. Some cool board <br/>
games---Anne had a cool one at her river house---I&#39;ll have to ask her the name!<br/>

nothing in particular. Let each day plan itself for a while---or go on a <br/>
vacation. Watch unschool-y movies and draw and play with clay and cook new foods. <br/>
Play like you&#39;re all five again---see the world through five-year-old eyes <br/>
again!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t spend a big wad, because I&#39;m guessing that as you all get more<br/>
comfortable unschooling, there will be a lot of things that people<br/>
discover that they do want. OTOH, it would help to have some cool stuff<br/>
around, to get to that place. What sounds fun to you? Have you always<br/>
wanted to tie dye, or be able to identify stars and planets in the sky,<br/>
or know the words to all the songs from My Fair Lady? Get stuff for<br/>
that... and think about your kids, and maybe get a few things that seem<br/>
like they would be interested in. There are some little science kits in<br/>
the Rainbow Resource catalog for like $2 each, and at one point I bought<br/>
a bunch and about half of them seemed interesting at some point and got<br/>
done, in some fashion - the rest are still on a shelf. OTOH, some of them<br/>
led to other things. I wouldn&#39;t spend a lot of money on any one thing,<br/>
but get stuff that is more of a first step, if that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Your boys who can&#39;t read well have been in the system, right? So they&#39;ve<br/>
been dealing with the messages that:<br/>
1. They *should* know how to read by now<br/>
2. Because they aren&#39;t reading, they&#39;re defective<br/>
3. Reading is a Very Important Thing.<br/>
<br/>
I would focus a lot more on undoing those three wrong messages than on<br/>
any sort of reading aids. If they say they want to read, maybe you could<br/>
get a stack of comic-type books (both comic books and books of comics,<br/>
like The Far Side, and Calvin and Hobbes and Foxtrot) and just leave them<br/>
around, they&#39;re pretty enjoyable even if you can&#39;t read them, or can&#39;t<br/>
read all of the words. I know one kid who learned to read by turning the<br/>
close captioning on on his TV, without ever consciously working at it.<br/>
<br/>
Or if they like computer games, you could just get regular computer<br/>
games, like Age of Empires maybe, or Sims, and there&#39;s reading in those<br/>
games, too... it&#39;s just not drill-stuff, it&#39;s real.<br/>

whatever. Unschooling means, to me, that you are doing what the kids <br/>
want to do, following their lead.  Janene is using a phonix reading <br/>
workbook, her choice.  <br/>
<br/>
What do they think will help them to learn to read better?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Magnets<br/>
<br/>
Lego or K&#39;nex or something like that<br/>
<br/>
Used books like DK or Usborne or some of the European books of that sort.  <br/>
They&#39;re picture books, but they have things even experts in the fields don&#39;t <br/>
know, and lots have great photos.  You can&#39;t help but learn from those even if <br/>
you just open one page one time.<br/>
<br/>
Videos, or a membership in Netflix (or both)<br/>
<br/>
Another computer if you don&#39;t have two?<br/>
<br/>
Computer games (used, probably, to be cheap!)<br/>
<br/>
good art supplies if they&#39;re interested<br/>
<br/>
yard stuff?  bikes? pogo stick? swings? depends on the kids</div>

complained to Lexie a few years ago she said something like &quot;it helped <br/>
me learn to read, and it helps me to build my vocabulary, I like it.&quot;  I <br/>
have heard nothing negative about it from my dad again.  I like it too, <br/>
it helps me to watch shows on mute.<br/>

&quot;Teach your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons.&quot;  I used it for 3 of my 4 bio kids, <br/>
and with our adopted son.  All 4 loved it and all 4 read really well.  <br/>
Definately not hard for the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I do know, though, that the boys love computer stuff.  Saw a program called <br/>
&quot;Phonics Tutor&quot; that is pretty pricy (90.00) but says it&#39;s a simple program <br/>
designed especially for kids who have had a lot of reading difficulties in the <br/>
past.  Still, might be too plain for them after playing Nintendo and <br/>
Playstation.  I hate to buy it and lose 90.00 *sigh*  Maybe we&#39;ll try the book first and <br/>
see how it goes.<br/>

sale stuff.  I Picked up a few games today at sales and a bunch of fisher-price <br/>
little people type toys...LOL!  Also, a big, huge box of play dishes and food. <br/>
 I know, the youngest is 9, but they didn&#39;t get a lot of that type of play <br/>
when they were little.  <br/>
<br/>
We also got a big, fat, heavy oak old kindergarten table at a yard sale <br/>
(probably twice the size of most coffee tables) to put in the living room instead <br/>
of the coffee table.  The top of it is worn and scratched anyhow, so it&#39;ll be <br/>
great for lots of fun stuff.  Also got a kids pottery wheel...might be a little <br/>
cheesy but what the heck..they&#39;ll have fun with it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to EVERYONE for all these great ideas...xoxoxoxoxo<br/>

I enjoyed it, and was glad to see an unschooling book get such high praise.<br/>
<br/>
And a Newbery questions, too.  Tim just read the 1952 Newbery winner (Ginger<br/>
Pye) and wanted to know what the winning author gets besides a medal.  Like<br/>
money or anything?  I didn&#39;t find the answer at the Newbery site.  We<br/>
wondered if maybe it is just an award that&#39;s a major honor, garners the<br/>
author great publicity for the book, and guarantees bigger sales and hence<br/>
more $$ that way.  Anybody know?<br/>

flavorings that smell good - peppermint or pineapple or chocolate or <br/>
whatever. And you can add things like oatmeal to make different <br/>
textures.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a playdough recipe from a Klutz book - I&#39;d triple it at least - <br/>
its no fun to have just a tiny bit of playdough.<br/>
<br/>
Ingredients:<br/>
1 cup flour<br/>
1/4 cup salt<br/>
2  T cream of tartar<br/>
2  Tsp food coloring<br/>
1Tvegetable oil<br/>
1cup water<br/>
<br/>
Directions:<br/>
1)  Mix the flour, salt, and cream of tarter in a medium pot<br/>
2)  Add water, food coloring and oil<br/>
3)  Stir over medium heat for 3-5 minutes. Don&#39;t worry if the mixture <br/>
looks like a  lumpy mess; it&#39;s turn into dough<br/>
4)  When the mixture forms a ball in the center of the pot, turn off <br/>
the stove and  let it cool. Then take it out of the pot and put it onto <br/>
a floured surface. Knead  it several times.<br/>
5)  Store in the Ziploc bag or airtight container in the fridge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-773778687">&lt;&lt; I think one can get a lot of mileage out of buying kids things that<br/>
they already love.&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Boy you sure are right about that. We only buy Jayn toys she expresses a<br/>
desire for, from spotting them in the stores, online or more rarely at<br/>
someone else&#39;s house. We don&#39;t have any surprises I guess - she has<br/>
already planned her present for her 4th birthday in October - but she<br/>
loves all her things, rotates them around and combines them in different<br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
We are fortunate because we live near the Mattel/Fisher-Price Warehouse<br/>
outlet that has huge discounts, and sometimes fun stuff like the same<br/>
toys in Japanese packaging. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn has also got a lot of mileage out of toys that come with fast food<br/>
meals. Sometimes they are remarkable.<br/>
<br/>
One place to possibly spend some money is on high speed or broadband<br/>
internet access rather than standard dial up. Also a satellite dish or<br/>
Tivo system that allows recording on to the disc. <br/>

YOU GOT PERMISSION TO HOME EDUCATE YOUR FOSTER CHILDREN??? WOW I AM SO<br/>
IMPRESSED. Our caseworker said no when we had foster kids so we don&#39;t foster<br/>
anymore. We will adopt older in a couple of years.<br/>
<br/>
Ok.. to answer your question, and bear in mind I have a lot of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We have memberships to both Mentura and Netflix for movies (Mentura is for<br/>
educational movies). We also have a membership to the Hands on Museum here<br/>
in Ann Arbor. I buy books at garage sales and I am not married to buying<br/>
books they are interested in. I get books that look like they might be<br/>
interesting to someone in the future etc. We purchased the complete set of<br/>
National Geographic magazines on CD ROM along with all the maps. I have<br/>
workbooks because I break down sometimes and want to &quot;prove&quot; things to<br/>
myself (This is completely my failing but I learned that sometimes I need to<br/>
satisfy my inner Professor). My kids will sometimes pick them up because<br/>
they are interesting (we have some unusual ones, like Geography and<br/>
Astronomy which combine reading and other skills so it is interesting for<br/>
them).<br/>
<br/>
We buy software that looks interesting all the time too, usually used if we<br/>
can find it. We have counting bears for my middle son to play with (he<br/>
adores them) and board games they like, playing cards for games of War (very<br/>
popular here) and go fish and more advanced games. I have several books on<br/>
nature projects in case anyone gets interested in doing an experiment. Some<br/>
days they will suggest it and some days I will ask if anyone is interested<br/>
in taking a walk and then doing something with what they find. Usually it is<br/>
a yes to the walk idea. I also have a lot of cookbooks and if I start<br/>
cooking someone might come in the kitchen and cook too. I have books on<br/>
craft ideas but favorite crafts are pretty adult projects around here. I<br/>
spin and weave and both older boys have asked to learn this winter when I<br/>
pull the yarn out again. My oldest son really wants to learn karate and I am<br/>
looking for a good local class. The class I recently found is so regimented<br/>
that all the fun seems to have leeched out of it.<br/>
<br/>
I have art supplies and old Paper Towel Rolls as well as the dog to play<br/>
with and brushes ready to go for them. So far I just try to keep stuff out<br/>
that might interest someone at some time.<br/>

 Same with the science museum passes.  Going to get one soon.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is because we are in the middle of adopting them.  The caseworker was <br/>
really rushing it to push it through, but it looks like it may be a few more <br/>
months.  <br/>
<br/>
We work for a private agency, and the worker there said that since they <br/>
aren&#39;t adopted yet, we may be able to get around it because the law reads that all <br/>
foster children are entitled to a public education.  I think that could be <br/>
interpreted in a few ways.  So she is going to get with the state worker and see <br/>
what they can do, and said she is pretty sure we can keep them home.  So we&#39;re <br/>
planning like they will be here.  If not, we&#39;ll just pull them as soon as the <br/>
adoption is over.<br/>
<br/>
Since all mine will be home now, I think we may continue fostering when ours <br/>
get older, but I think I&#39;ll stipulate we&#39;ll only take kids not in school yet, <br/>
or we&#39;ll only take them if they&#39;ll let us homeschool them.  I don&#39;t want all <br/>
the hassle of dealing with the schools.  It was awful last year.<br/>
