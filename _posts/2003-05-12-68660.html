<div id="ygrps-yiv-1092437093">I have a neighbor who has a dd in 4th gr and twins in K.  I met her about 2 years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh and I took our kids out of school last year, and she has been very supportive to me.  She calls<br/>
and e-mails with questions about what we do.  She has brought the kids over to play with mine<br/>
on their days off.  HOWEVER....it is like we have this underground friendship.  She has <br/>
invited me to one of those &quot;all come over and bring your checkbook&quot; parties...Southern Living?  All<br/>
of the p.s. moms I used to be acquainted with were there.  She had a Holt and a Gatto book<br/>
that I had lent to her...which she had told me she loved....and in fact, was going to get for herself.<br/>
She wanted to return them to me at the party.  She had them double wrapped in opaque plastic<br/>
bags, and waited until almost everyone left before bringing them out.<br/>
<br/>
During the party I listened to story after story about unhappy kids, guidance counselors<br/>
overstepping their bounds, homework taking them into bedtime hours, and parents literally<br/>
afraid to rock the boat and do anything about it.  (I don&#39;t know if I am being hypocritical...as<br/>
I didn&#39;t do much about it when my kids were in either...other than accept my duty as the Royal <br/>
Pain in the Teacher&#39;s Bottom, which really had no positive effect to speak of).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...it was weird.  One mom, who had a child in my son&#39;s K class last year, went on<br/>
and on about the reading assessments, and the math assessments, and the color code punishment<br/>
system:  every classroom now has a chart up front, the kids get moved from green, to yellow, to <br/>
orange, to red....if they misbehave.  If they make it to purple, down to the principal.  The teachers<br/>
are spending more time at that chart....constantly threatening to &quot;move someone to yellow&quot;...etc.<br/>
Can you imagine this for any age?  I finally spoke up and asked why the parents allow this in<br/>
the classroom.  How on earth does the teacher have any time to help the children with all of this<br/>
nonsense going on?  They looked at me like I had just lifted my leg and peed on the carpet.<br/>
<br/>
They just ignored me after that.  One continued the thread with a story of how one of<br/>
the 4th grade teachers who hates band kids, put a whole table full of them on yellow for making<br/>
too many disruptions as they were trying to leave in the middle of class to go to band practice.  <br/>
Since they were on yellow, she held them back in the class for 20 minutes, not letting them leave.<br/>
When they finally did get to band, the band director put them on yellow for being late.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what exactly happened after that...but whenever the kids get put on something other than green,<br/>
some sort of punishment is assigned.   <br/>
(We experienced things like this when my oldest was in 4th...but they didn&#39;t have the color code<br/>
system, yet....he would raise his hand to leave class, and the teacher would tell him not to <br/>
interrupt, just get up and leave.  The next time, when he just got up to leave, she would yell at him<br/>
for getting up in the middle of class).<br/>
<br/>
Back to the original topic.....there have defininately been changes with my old friends, and family<br/>
members who I used to be very close to.  I know people in all of the situations I have been reading<br/>
about here....women who have to work because their families have become dependent on their incomes <br/>
through large home and fancy car purchases ...women who claim that they have to work, because they<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand being around their kids all day...(some who take their kids to daycare, even when they<br/>
have the day off) and women who are sahm&#39;s, and feel that finally being able to send their last child to <br/>
full-time school is the reward for all of their &quot;hard work.&quot;  I tend to get frustrated and depressed when<br/>
I think too much about not knowing how to get through to this many people...but I do agree with the <br/>
&quot;shout it from the rooftops&quot; philosophy.  <br/>
<br/>
We have another daycare popping up here....that makes 3 large full-time centers within a 3 mile <br/>
stretch.  (And we&#39;re in a pretty rural area).  The latest one is literally one parking lot away from another.  <br/>
When the last one was built, right along a major thoroughfare...my husband joked, and said &quot;Can&#39;t you <br/>
just feel the excitement...parents won&#39;t even have to stop...they can just toss them out the door as they <br/>
drive by.&quot;  One has a huge banner they posted across the front....&quot;OPEN 6 AM until 7 PM ! ! !&quot;  I just <br/>
feel ill every time I drive by, and see those plastic playgrounds with cold concrete or pebble floors...mobbed <br/>
with kids, all fenced in and climbing on top of one another.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, too depressing for a Monday morning.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe these are the rooftops we should start with...<br/>
I&#39;m thinking megaphones...and cans of creamed corn!  (I loved that comment, by the way!)<br/>
What&#39;s the worst that could happen, they&#39;d think we&#39;re weird?<br/>
<br/>
I stop being depressed about alienation, when I consider what I am missing with these moms...<br/>
merely the opportunity to complain about everything.  That&#39;s really all we did before I left ps....<br/>
commiserate to one another.  I don&#39;t have too much to complain about anymore....and that&#39;s a <br/>
tremendously beautiful thing. <br/>
<br/>
You are right, Mary....life is GOOD!<br/>

THIS is horrible.<br/>
<br/>
But school stories are always horrible once we get far enough away from the <br/>
shadow of the school to see things in normal light, don&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
My  column for the next issue of Home Education Magazine is in part about the <br/>
value of band to schoolkids--you get out of other classes!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-Back to the original topic.....there have defininately been changes with <br/>
my old friends, and family<br/>
members who I used to be very close to. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This weekend Kirby and I stayed with another family, whose teenaged daughter <br/>
(high school senior) had invited Kirby to go to the prom with her in Los <br/>
Alamos.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known both parents a long time, separately.  They married just a few <br/>
years ago, he had one daughter she had two sons.  <br/>
<br/>
Although we had good conversations about board games and non-spanking (they <br/>
definitely don&#39;t spank) there were a dozen tense moments in which I could <br/>
have gotten through them by agreeing with something I didn&#39;t agree with, or <br/>
saying nothing when I had the strong urge to defend a child.   <br/>
<br/>
They wanted me to tell Kirby what to do and when, because they wanted to tell <br/>
their daughter wha to do and when.  The dad was advising the girls who had <br/>
gathered to meet the prom dates (Kirby was separated from either group, he <br/>
was with us--six couples plus singles were separated) that they should go on <br/>
to the restaurant and leave a message for the boys to meet them there.  They <br/>
would have taken Kirby too.  I said it wasn&#39;t much of a date if they didn&#39;t <br/>
go together, and maybe the boys had had car trouble, or something legitimate. <br/>
 I said I could take Kirby to meet them (I know the town).  The justification <br/>
for this pressure was that the spaghetti was about ready to put on the table.<br/>
<br/>
Someone I like and respect was willing to mess up the prom date of half a <br/>
dozen couples to keep from eating late.  What he had said was if that food <br/>
got put on the table, he was NOT going to leave to take Kirby if they called.<br/>
<br/>
I said I thought we should just take Kirby where the girls were then, and let <br/>
him wait with them, and we did that.<br/>
<br/>
The mom said at some point in this discussion, &quot;Well what do you expect?  <br/>
They&#39;re teenaged boys.  They&#39;re ALL irresponsible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said mine weren&#39;t, and that we had gone up there so Kirby could go to the <br/>
prom, not so I could eat spaghetti, so the prom definitely was more important.<br/>
<br/>
That was NOT their main answer, because their priority is the family eats <br/>
together every night.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a tiny difference of priority like that can just about make or break a <br/>
friendship.  I think the kids&#39; happiness is more important than my personal <br/>
inconvenience or preference, especially at a once-in-a-lifetime moment.  <br/>
<br/>
When it was getting time to go, I said I figured Holly was starting to look <br/>
for me to come home, and it was a two hour drive, so we should probably get <br/>
going.  I said I would check and see if Kirby was ready to go.  The response <br/>
(which COULD have just been &quot;Okay, glad you came, can we help you get your <br/>
stuff?&quot;) was &quot;Too bad if he&#39;s not ready, if it&#39;s time, just tell him it&#39;s <br/>
time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, it was KIRBY&#39;s trip to Los Alamos.  Though I could nudge him, I wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to command him to get in the car.  And it turned out their daughter was <br/>
talking about things to him that she really wanted to talk about, and he <br/>
knows more of the people involved (her real mom, some other parents) than her <br/>
friends up there know, and she was benefiting greatly from Kirby&#39;s counsel.  <br/>
(He honestly is a good counsellor and has been since he was a kid solving <br/>
other kids&#39; spats.)<br/>
<br/>
It would have been easier for them had I just treated Kirby like they treat <br/>
their kids while we were there.  But I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My only more-protective-than-they-were moment was when I expressed surprise <br/>
and concern that they were going to Santa Fe to eat instead of eating in Los <br/>
Alamos.  LOTS of kids in just two or three cars (a car and a van, or maybe <br/>
van and two cars) and I knew NONE of the drivers, and didn&#39;t know if they <br/>
knew where they were going in Santa Fe, and how much party atmosphere there <br/>
might be, and I just hadn&#39;t known that part of the plan.  So the best driver <br/>
was assigned to take Kirby and his date in her car to make me feel better.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t horrible, it was just a good example of the awkward differences <br/>
putting respect for children high on the list can cause, even with another <br/>
liberal, child-loving family.  I can no longer abide the attitude, &quot;It <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter what he wants, he&#39;s a kid.&quot;<br/>
