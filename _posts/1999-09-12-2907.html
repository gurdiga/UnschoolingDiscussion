&lt;&lt; To <br/>
  me organized religion and public school go hand in hand! As far as a <br/>
 personal <br/>
  relationship with God, biblical-based, spiritual type-Christianity  goes, I <br/>
  think there are no conflicts with unschooling. Once you get into a doctrine <br/>
  that attempts to take control and create a lot of extra rules instead of <br/>
  offering worship and fellowship; therein lies the discrepency. And there <br/>
you <br/>
  have my humble opinion, Lori in TX &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This CAN be true but I tend to look at OR&#39;s as the &quot;one size does NOT fit <br/>
all&quot;.  Some folks NEED this kind of structure.  Some folks, like myself, can <br/>
dance pretty freely amongst those who do need more definition.  I guess I <br/>
think outside the box, choose to do my innermost living and thinking outside <br/>
the box but visit those IN the box.  I like to think it offers more contact <br/>
with people and an understanding of how those &quot;inside&quot; think.  I also get <br/>
better and better and gently deflecting their attempts to rein me in.  I even <br/>
manage to help them get a glimpse of the dance floor just outside.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Just for the record, I know quite a few &quot;conservative Christians&quot; who are <br/>
fairly radical unschoolers.<br/>
