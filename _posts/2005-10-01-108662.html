<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050627761">I came across this looking for something this morning and it ties in to a <br/>
couple of recent discussions.   I don&#39;t know where it originally was, but pobably <br/>
at unschooling.com (for having my whole name):<br/>

[quoting someone, doesn&#39;t matter who, I don&#39;t remember]<br/>
-=-My fear (well one of them) is the example of a <br/>
close friend of mine. She unschooled all four of <br/>
her kids although the oldest girl did go to p.s. <br/>
starting in 8th grade through 12. But, out of all <br/>
four of her kids, three are depressed, no job, or <br/>
a low paying job, and the 20 yr old is pregnant by <br/>
a deadbeat who is on drugs, sleeping around with a <br/>
17 year old, already fathered another child <br/>
previously, etc, etc. -=- <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s better, still, than if they had gone <br/>
to school! (I&#39;m serious. It sounds stupid, but <br/>
some kids at school get dead, or in trouble with <br/>
the law, and school is certainly no charm against <br/>
pregnancy, and by 20 school wouldn&#39;t have been a <br/>
factor. Fourteen year olds get pregnant from kids <br/>
they meet at school. <br/>
<br/>
-=-My friend was/is the most layed back mom <br/>
around. Never (I mean never) hit her kids, <br/>
attachment parenting, extended breastfeeding, <br/>
family bed, very few rules . . . and they are <br/>
depressed kids. So, that&#39;s my fear. -=- <br/>
<br/>
So that lists what she didn&#39;t do (hit, make a <br/>
bunch of rules) but what DID she do to make their <br/>
lives richer and full of ideas and exposure to <br/>
everything in the whole wide world? Maybe the <br/>
mom&#39;s depressed too. Maybe it&#39;s genetic. I don&#39;t <br/>
know, but if you want unschooling to work just <br/>
because you stick the curriculum under the couch, <br/>
it won&#39;t! Get the world swirling around you <br/>
(first) and your children (second) so there are <br/>
sounds, sights, smells, tastes and textures for <br/>
them to process and build their internal model of <br/>
the universe from. GET MOVING, mentally and <br/>
physically. <br/>

====================================<br/>
<br/>
Here it seemed someone was blaming unschooling for depressing, and for <br/>
pregnancy (but in a 20 year old!)    When kids are in school, is school often blamed <br/>
for depression or pregnancy?   I don&#39;t think so.   Parents are blamed.   LACK <br/>
of attention to school is blamed.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s interesting and worth a look.<br/>
