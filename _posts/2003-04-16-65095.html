Excellent point. I&#39;ts written right in my divorce agreement that Tara&#39;s dad<br/>
and I have to &quot;consult one another on questions of religion, discipline,<br/>
financial, moral, social, recreational and legal matters, school and<br/>
educational programs, changes in social environment, and non emergency<br/>
health care, both dental and medical.&quot;<br/>
Luckily for me he never really questioned anything but when I wanted to pull<br/>
her from school to homeschool her, he balked at that big time. Being that I<br/>
had such a rough time in court before regarding Tara, I wasn&#39;t willing to<br/>
chance doing it again for homeschooling. But like you saidm this came after<br/>
the divorce and from what I was told, did make a difference. If she was<br/>
homeschooling before the divorce, I would have had a much better chance<br/>
keeping things that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-234598211">From: &quot; Ann Slaughter&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:annabell1972@...">annabell1972@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I was awarded &quot;custody&quot;. I says &quot; Ann has the right  and responsibility<br/>
regarding the rearing and overall well-being of the childrens growth and<br/>
development, including but not limited to, choice of school, course of<br/>
study, extensive travel away from home,...&quot;blah blah blah...  &quot;Ann Shall not<br/>
be required  to consult with Jason as to decision making on a day-to-day<br/>
basis.&quot;...It also states that each of us is intitled to two weeks of<br/>
uninterrupted vistitation. It states nothing about summers. It also states<br/>
that he is allowed a min. of 2 weekends of month and that modification of<br/>
increased visits is up to me.I know he would fight me on anything else&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well that all sounds very much in your favor on a lot of counts. I would do<br/>
some more checking possibly about the court systems there and the judges and<br/>
homeschooling. Ask around. Talk to someone in the system. Ask an attorney.<br/>
Just in case. If what you hear is favorable, I would do as you wish.<br/>
