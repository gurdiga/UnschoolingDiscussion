<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291331743">We celebrated our first anniversary of moving house last night, with a<br/>
bottle of bubbly, Spanish Cava to be precise.  Just before the New Year<br/>
there was a programme on the telly with loads of tips for parties from<br/>
butlers and professional party organisers.  One tip was that if you have a<br/>
bottle of sparkling wine open, a teaspoon stuck in the top, handle down,<br/>
will stop it from going flat.  We tried it and it works, but does anyone<br/>
know why?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and yesterday, while I was at a LLL Spring Workshop, dd1 asked dh the<br/>
same question a few times, so he said, &#39;I really like answering your<br/>
questions, but it gets boring when it&#39;s the same one all the time, can you<br/>
vary it a bit?&#39;  She thought for a while, and asked the same question again,<br/>
so he reminded her that he&#39;d asked her to ask something different.  She<br/>
said, &#39;I did ask it differently!&#39; which she had, the same question, but<br/>
differently.  He couldn&#39;t argue with that!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Mothering Sunday everyone!<br/>

Oh gosh, Tracy, now you&#39;ve opened up a whole new vision of yourself for
me. &lt;g&gt;

<p>So many images to chose from! So if you aren&#39;t the blonde on a bicycle,
well, are you a Norah Batty look alike? &lt;ducking and running&gt;
