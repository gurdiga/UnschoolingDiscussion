So -- now you&#39;ve got some &quot;infinity&quot; conversation going -- what you want is <br/>
for him NOT to get the idea that infinity is some kind of really really big <br/>
number.<br/>
<br/>
You can ask him what happens when you keep dividing something in half, over <br/>
and over, now. Then you can talk about what happens if you divide nothing <br/>
in half &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
These are MUCH more fun things to do with a 6 yo than to worry about <br/>
carrying and borrowing &lt;G&gt;. He&#39;ll get there -- don&#39;t worry - keep having <br/>
fun with ideas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685027640">Our 6 y.o. adores google - the concept, not the search engine<br/>
(she&#39;s keen on the search engine come to think of it, but that&#39;s<br/>
a different issue).  She can explain how operations for which she<br/>
has no name have to operate using google, but the mechanics of<br/>
cubing a &quot;real&quot; number stop her from explaining exponents nearly<br/>
as well as she can when it is a kewl place holder like google.<br/>
...and, no, I have no idea where she learned that google even<br/>
existed as a concept....<br/>
