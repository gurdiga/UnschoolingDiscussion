boy.<br/>
<br/>
Julian LOOKS very mature, and emotionally he is. Socially, he&#39;s really not. <br/>
Now, you&#39;ve met this kid and I haven&#39;t, but in my experience with teenagers, <br/>
most girls DO mature much faster than most boys. In most cases a 12 year old <br/>
girl and a 14 year old boy are kind of on par as far as social maturity goes. <br/>
(Clearly there are exceptions, and I really don&#39;t blame you for being concerned.)<br/>
<br/>
There are MAJOR advantages to have a &quot;romance&quot; with someone who lives far <br/>
away when you&#39;re very young. You get the warm squishy feelings without all the <br/>
pressure. You can talk on the phone and giggle and think about how cute the <br/>
other person is, but you don&#39;t actually have to deal with them on a day-to-day <br/>
basis.<br/>
