<div id="ygrps-yiv-1895103150">Yesterday I was reading the documents pertaining the Gentle Spirit court<br/>
case. I came to the part of Mary Pride&#39;s testimony where she talks about the<br/>
cost of advertising in her card deck.  My 5, 7 and 9 year olds were all<br/>
sitting in by me and when I started talking to the computer my 9 year old<br/>
asked what was up. So I explained what I was reading and about the cost. We<br/>
had recieved a coupon pak in the mail yesterday so I had a visual aid handy.<br/>
&lt;G&gt;  We talked about how Papa John&#39;s pizza wouldn&#39;t want to be in a<br/>
homeschooling deck.  I was explaining about being able to target your<br/>
audience and how Mary Pride got the addresses of so many homeschoolers.  I<br/>
was still shocked that it was a $6000 commitment to have a card in that card<br/>
deck.  My 5.5 year old, from about 8 feet away with her hand on the<br/>
refridgerator said....&quot;it depends on how many homeschooers there are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
After I picked up my jaw, I just sort of stared at my own child.  She had<br/>
been listening and taking it all in, which isn&#39;t surprising.  She had also<br/>
understood everything, she saw the big picture within moments.  She was<br/>
unfrettered in any way about thinking and joining the conversation.  She was<br/>
also thinking faster and with more clarity than her 9 year old brother.<br/>
<br/>
I saw myself within her.  I saw years of getting things, of seeing the big<br/>
picture within moments of exploring a topic.  My stomach knotted, for I also<br/>
saw what had been done to me.  When I was 5 I was not asked to join the<br/>
conversation. I was not thought well of for being able to think with clarity<br/>
and speed. I saw years of retraining where I sat mute, trying to stay out of<br/>
trouble and never quite making it.<br/>
<br/>
She smiled at me and our conversation went on.  We spent a few more minutes<br/>
talking about the price of paper and who designs the artwork on those cards<br/>
in the card pack.  I, however, found a quiet spot and rejoiced that this<br/>
child, my child, would grow up whole.  How very powerful she will be.<br/>
