 </span></blockquote>True. I am one of those odd people that enjoys cleaning. I really get into <br/>
it, break a sweat, and feel so good when it&#39;s done. I think my example has <br/>
shown my son that you can get a sense of accomplishment from just about <br/>
anything. My house is not often *tidy*, but it is always *clean*. Last week <br/>
I was resting on the couch (I am 9 months pregnant - due any day) and my <br/>
son (who will be 6 in November) decided he wanted to clean the house. I got <br/>
him some paper towels, windex, a mop and the dustbuster. He proceeded to <br/>
clean the whole house, giving me updates as he went from room to room. He <br/>
was so proud of himself. I paid him $2 - he didn&#39;t ask for any money and we <br/>
don&#39;t give him an allowance yet, so he was stunned. I was nervous that he <br/>
might start *asking* for money when doing future household activities, but <br/>
so far he has not ever mentioned the money again, and still helps me clean <br/>
and do dishes regularly.<br/>
