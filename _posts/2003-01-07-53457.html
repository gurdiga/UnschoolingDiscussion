<div id="ygrps-yiv-787835822">Sandra asked how people sanded wood before sandpaper was invented...<br/>
Here&#39;s what my search turned up, very interesting stuff.  This is a small <br/>
segment of an ongoing conversation about different materials used.....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I recall references to colonial cabinetmakers using sharkskin and a<br/>
particular variety of grass (it has a very high silica content) for<br/>
smoothing.  No idea how old the technique is, and all my references are<br/>
packed away right now.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to make your own glasspaper, I would use a thin layer of<br/>
hide glue to adhere a freshly crushed and screened frit (crushed/ground<br/>
glass.)<br/>

I am not certain why Iím posting this, but I figured some of you would<br/>
find this useful or at least interesting.<br/>
<br/>
The Horse Tail reed is also known as Dutch Reed, Turners Reed, and<br/>
Scouring Rushes.  This is a very primitive plant which isolates silica<br/>
in crystaline form within its structure.  It is somewhat friable in use,<br/>
but easily replaced.  It grows in shady marshy ground, and looks like a<br/>
bunch (sometimes a WHOLE buch) of green straws sticking out of the<br/>
ground<br/>
<br/>
My rather unscientific tests indicate that The samples I have are<br/>
approximately equivalent to 600-800 grit (at least American) sandpaper.<br/>
<br/>
Another nifty polish I have used is wood ash, combined on a rag with<br/>
water.  John Leader did extensive work on bone ash polishes, but I<br/>
havent read his work yet.<br/>
<br/>
For the ardent recreationists among you, try polishing some brass with<br/>
wood ash some time, it gives a lovely satin finish.<br/>
<br/>
Also for the SCAdians among us, Coopers Lake Campground in Pennsylvania<br/>
USA (home of Pennsic War) has several acres of equicitum- I cut some from<br/>
the roadside, and have not used it all yet.  It dries, and  can be<br/>
reconstituted by soaking.  However DO NOT allow your animals to get<br/>
ahold of it, as equicitum also produces a plant toxin I canít name right<br/>
this minute but I believe to be in the family of aconitic acids, and<br/>
which is known to have produced sickness and or death in cattle who ate<br/>
it in their fodder. <br/>
<br/>
It has been used since time immemorial as sandpaper, and for (oddly<br/>
enough, given the one name above) scouring dishes.<br/>

<br/>
OH!  I had heard of &quot;scouring rushes&quot; before but never thought that it might <br/>
mean people scour with them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for finding that stuff!  I feel much better.<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested wood against wood, with sand, and that&#39;s probably the <br/>
&quot;sanding block&quot; of ancient memory although now sanding blocks have sandpaper <br/>
fastened onto them.  It would work if you just kinda had a sand base (in a <br/>
box or on the ground) and put sand on the wood, and rub it around with <br/>
another piece of wood.<br/>

Yes, I agree!! I love questions that get me thinking....<br/>
I never would have thought of the sharkskin thing!<br/>
