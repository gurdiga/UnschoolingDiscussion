-=- Responding and being there has been hard for her but she is  <br/>
getting it  little by little that is not being permissive and absent  <br/>
instead of controlling and punitive.<br/>
But a lot of people see one or the other. It is hard for them to see  <br/>
what unschooling families that have been doing for a while and are  <br/>
mindfully parenting do.<br/>
  -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is what I used to be criticized for on Home Education Magazine  <br/>
discussions, for saying that unschooling is something besides &quot;just  <br/>
take them out of school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, in the days before unschooling.com was created to give me a  <br/>
forum to talk about unschooling in depth (to get me off the regular  <br/>
HEM boards, honestly), people would cut me off and say &quot;Just take them  <br/>
out of school and learning will follow.  It will be fun!  Ignore  <br/>
Sandra.&quot;    Not in so few words. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The idea that there was nothing to it was all around, often put out  <br/>
there by people who wouldn&#39;t talk about their own unschooling because  <br/>
there wasn&#39;t much good to tell.  Some, I think, were controlling moms  <br/>
who didn&#39;t want to mess with the administration of the schools so  <br/>
brought their kids home and said &quot;You can do what you want to.  Make  <br/>
it something good.&quot;   I&#39;ve seen a few families seem to make something  <br/>
like that work, because the kid was older and glad to be sprung, and  <br/>
could figure out how to keep the momentum of &quot;headed toward college&quot;  <br/>
keep going on his own.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something that can be generalized to other families.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, getting a child out of school is important.  Unschooling isn&#39;t  <br/>
going to take hold while school is still in the middle of the  <br/>
family.   But taking them out of school isn&#39;t enough.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So what DO unschoolers do?  Can we make a list and edit it down to key  <br/>
elements?  Maybe we can&#39;t, but can we try?<br/>
<br/>
And if there are already lists like this available to send people to,  <br/>
could people bring those links too, please?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll start, but feel free to rephrase my stuff to make it more general  <br/>
or clearer if you can.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents spend lots of time with their children.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents support their children&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents respond to their children&#39;s curiosity and questions.<br/>
<br/>
There must be many more, but how many things can a new unschooler  <br/>
incorporate at once?<br/>

Unschoolers support and encourage their children&#39;s innate self-awareness.  <br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m thinking of self-awareness in regards to their self-knowledge of their own physical <br/>
and emotional needs, etc.--having trouble stating this in a simple, concise manner!)<br/>

<br/>
This idea resonates with me, I saw it on a response today. To me it <br/>
shows respect for the innate nature of human beings to seek <br/>
autonomy,  to define self.<br/>
<br/>
 Having followed the conversations about autonomy,  limits/controls, <br/>
influence,  partnership...<br/>
<br/>
 I am experiencing/interpreting contradictions,  what follows are <br/>
questions<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t seeking Autonomy part of human nature?  Isn&#39;t life about <br/>
defining/redefining, inventing who we are,   about discovering <br/>
ourselves?  Isn&#39;t discovering who we are really a never ending <br/>
process? <br/>
<br/>
 Isn&#39;t seeking a level of autonomy healthy? <br/>
<br/>
 So then I ask is the issue behind the issue of autonomy about <br/>
balance?   and in seeking balance we consider how we are affected by <br/>
the influences in our lives.<br/>
<br/>
based on how we are influenced/what we come to believe, we reject or <br/>
accept what others are saying and doing...by how these experiences <br/>
make us feel.<br/>
<br/>
Do Unschoolers wish to be autonomous from the greater society?  <br/>
<br/>
 Do they want to balance their way of life with that of the larger <br/>
society, do they see themselves as separate, as a sub group?<br/>
<br/>
 as  another aspect of the larger group?  <br/>
<br/>
 Are they a group that looks/has a goal to: balance the greater <br/>
society?  <br/>
<br/>
 Are unschoolers concerned with how the larger society views and <br/>
understands them?<br/>
<br/>
 I ask these questions because in my particular case I have a 13 year <br/>
old,  who I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; is ready/mature/knowledgeable enough to <br/>
be as autonomous as he is seeking to be. In my case I have a child <br/>
who <br/>
<br/>
wants to have all controls/responsibility removed.  I don&#39;t see this <br/>
as odd, but quite appropriate for a teenager...  The school he <br/>
attends though has disregarded this desire in him altogether, and now <br/>
we are at an imbalance.  I am searching for a way to bring this <br/>
experience back into balance.<br/>
<br/>
 Are my beliefs justifiable  (him not being <br/>
ready/mature/knowledgeable) is that not the right/best/appropriate <br/>
way to look at it?      Are there other ways to &quot;see&quot; my son?<br/>
<br/>
by justifiable I mean, that in the greater society we tend to think <br/>
that children need guidance and structure, protection, limits, <br/>
sheilded from certain language and activities that adults engage in, <br/>
that many things should be decided for them until certain ages...<br/>
<br/>
I can see here that some are going to question whether or not I <br/>
really Know my son that I am asking our my beliefs justifiable... I <br/>
do know my son, on an intuitive level I do not think he is mature <br/>
enough, but then I have to wonder do I need to look at a bias in my <br/>
belief?  What is it about the larger society that has influenced me <br/>
to believe the things I believe.<br/>
<br/>
And here is where Unschooling is confusing to me.... because at one <br/>
level I am understanding or misunderstanding the ideas about limits, <br/>
I am understanding that lightening up on limits is a way to allow for <br/>
autonomy, is a way to allow for the child to understand himself, to <br/>
learn by the experiences he chooses (remember also I am dealing with <br/>
a teen not a 2 year old.)....not by the experiences he is forced into <br/>
having.<br/>
<br/>
This is very hard to articulate and I do fear being misunderstood <br/>
here... just keep in mind, I&#39;m looking for clarification on <br/>
philosophy of Unschooling,... so I can take it and apply it (or not) <br/>
to my situation... <br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m just putting out there thoughts, not necessarily personal <br/>
feelings, ideas, beliefs.....I&quot;m trying to understand  a deeper <br/>
understanding of unschooling.  of the philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
 If anyone wants to write personal realizations, stories, experiences <br/>
without taking up the time and space in the forum I would love to <br/>
receive personal emails.   I know it&#39;s easy to send me a link to <br/>
another site, but more I&#39;m looking for communion, personal <br/>
interaction, feelings,<br/>
<br/>
 Would you say that those that choose unschooling have certain <br/>
personality types?  <br/>
<br/>
 Do unschoolers have fears of how they are judged perceived by <br/>
greater society?  If so what are the fears?  How have any of them <br/>
been dealt with or overcome?<br/>
<br/>
 In asking these questions I do not mean to be coming from any place <br/>
of judgment, preconceived notions, only looking for understanding,  <br/>
only looking to have a clearer perception.<br/>

<br/>
Attentive and alert.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did some serious thinking about this.  There might be people here  <br/>
with experience in something that might directly apply:  bodyguard,  <br/>
secret service, intensive care or emergency room nurse.<br/>
<br/>
The context in which I was doing my philosophizing a few years ago was  <br/>
in writing directions and guidelines for a situation within the SCA, a  <br/>
medieval studies group our whole family has been in, Marty&#39;s heavily  <br/>
in, Holly&#39;s hardly in, Keith just got back from five nights camping at  <br/>
&quot;a war...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But the season in which I thought about &quot;attentive and alert&quot; was when  <br/>
I was describing my vision as the steward of the royal household, for  <br/>
what I wanted the ladies in waiting and the guardsmen to do--how I  <br/>
wanted them to see themselves within the situation.<br/>
<br/>
We were &quot;just playing,&quot; except for the fact that real, live people  <br/>
would drive hundreds of miles to play.    Anyway, this is what I came  <br/>
up with, and you might see why it reminds me of the mother of two  <br/>
video gamers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
==============================<br/>
AT BECK AND CALL<br/>
<br/>
Attendants should be at the Queen’s beck and call. Literally, “at beck  <br/>
and call” means close enough and attentive enough that if the Queen  <br/>
needs us she only has to gesture or speak a word and we are there. We  <br/>
don’t need to stand within arm’s length—in fact, we need NOT to do  <br/>
that all the time—but to stand ready to run an errand, to adjust  <br/>
furniture, furnish a drink, or whatever it might be.<br/>
<br/>
===========================<br/>
<br/>
These days, &quot;beck and call&quot; is only part of insults.  &quot;He expected me  <br/>
to be at his beck and call.&quot;  But look at it straight on:  &quot;Beck&quot; is  <br/>
related to &quot;beckon.&quot;  To beckon means to somehow get someone to come  <br/>
closer to you.   Apparently it means to get someone to come closer to  <br/>
you without actually calling them. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone is curious about that part of my weird hobby, here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/artan/policies">http://sandradodd.com/artan/policies</a><br/>
<br/>
I know some of the readers here either are or have been in the SCA  <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a stupid club, but just because something can objectively  <br/>
be seen as stupid doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not fun.  It&#39;s probably stupid  <br/>
that I collect cardboard boxes.  Still, when someone needs a cardboard  <br/>
box of a certain size and strength, they know I&#39;ll probably have one.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s stupid that I really want me and Keith to stay in this big  <br/>
house even when the kids are gone, but my STUFF is here, and there&#39;s  <br/>
room for visitors.<br/>
<br/>
I could do search-and-replace of the paragraph above and excise the  <br/>
word &quot;stupid.&quot;   What could I replace it with that would make the same  <br/>
point?<br/>

the idea that unschoolers support/encourage/acknowledge the inborn self-knowlege of <br/>
their children.  Sheesh--being clear can be tough!<br/>

That&#39;s a lot of words, but a child isn&#39;t born with a connection to  <br/>
himself.  He is born whole.<br/>
<br/>
The word for all of that, I think is &quot;wholeness.&quot;<br/>

And as whole as he might be, what he needs at the moment of birth is  <br/>
to continue to be with his mother.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, and because John Holt said taking them out of school and leaving <br/>
them alone would be better than school (somebody can maybe find that <br/>
quote - I&#39;m sure this is a pretty close paraphrase). So people took that <br/>
to heart.<br/>
<br/>
But back in those days, it was very very open-ended and vague what was <br/>
meant by unschooling. John Holt was very very patient with people - he <br/>
seemed happy to see them just get kids out of school and hoped that <br/>
they&#39;d come to realize that they didn&#39;t need to do school at home, <br/>
either. That seemed obvious to him and he warned against creating a <br/>
miniature schoolroom in the home, but he used the term unschooling to <br/>
include whatever people might be doing outside of physical schools - <br/>
school-at-home to nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more and more often wishing we had another term - a term for this <br/>
style of parenting - sort of an extended attachment parenting plus for <br/>
the way our kids are supporting in their learning lives (which is a <br/>
natural result of this type of parenting).<br/>
<br/>
The parenting stuff - even parents of young children would be seen as <br/>
practicing that up until they sent their kids to school.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads me to Alfie Kohn - seems to me he is a move in the direction <br/>
of the type of parenting we&#39;re talking about - he calls it <br/>
&quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; and I have issues with the name, but not with <br/>
what he promotes, in practice. BUT, seems to me that the logical <br/>
conclusion to his parenting style would be to not make the kids go to <br/>
school or do schoolwork - and he doesn&#39;t take it that far.<br/>
<br/>
In my own head, I think of what I do as &quot;Relationship Parenting&quot; - a <br/>
strong and happy and supportive relationship is what I aim for. It is <br/>
how I decide what to do or say when I&#39;m not sure. I ask myself whether <br/>
this is relationship building or destructive. I mean, that seems to be <br/>
at the core of what matters most - if our relationship is good, then I <br/>
AM respecting my children&#39;s autonomy (in the sense that I&#39;m recognizing <br/>
they are a real and separate person who has their own brain and body and <br/>
their own strengths and weaknesses and are not simply a sort of parental <br/>
prosthetic) and dependence and everything else.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, just saying I put our relationship first and foremost isn&#39;t <br/>
really that helpful to others, since they might think the appropriate <br/>
relationship between parent and child is that of owner and slave or that <br/>
they are &quot;equal&quot; in every way or something else altogether. I know what <br/>
it means to me - but it isn&#39;t necessarily going to be useful to others <br/>
to put it this way.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL!  I guess it would depend on the situation--I&#39;d think it could be some sort of <br/>
expression of anger/upset/frustration, not being paid attention to, not feeling validated, <br/>
maybe something stemming from boredom or curiosity, some gross motor sensory needs <br/>
not being met, etc...It would probably be very specific to the situation.  I don&#39;t think that <br/>
stepping on the cat would actually work to *meet* the child&#39;s underlying need either, but <br/>
that this behavior/action was communicating something, something that the child might <br/>
need or be lacking.  Maybe a need for connection with someone else?  Even a need to be <br/>
supported by his parents while learning to navigate the world.  (ie, parent says, &quot;Ouch--<br/>
that hurts the kitty, if you want to touch her, pet her (taking child or cat away if child <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768589168">I&#39;m more and more often wishing we had another term - a term for this <br/>
style of parenting - sort of an extended attachment parenting plus for <br/>
the way our kids are supporting in their learning lives (which is a <br/>
natural result of this type of parenting).<br/>
<br/>
The parenting stuff - even parents of young children would be seen as <br/>
practicing that up until they sent their kids to school.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads me to Alfie Kohn - seems to me he is a move in the direction <br/>
of the type of parenting we&#39;re talking about - he calls it <br/>
&quot;Unconditional Parenting&quot; and I have issues with the name, but not with <br/>
what he promotes, in practice. BUT, seems to me that the logical <br/>
conclusion to his parenting style would be to not make the kids go to <br/>
school or do schoolwork - and he doesn&#39;t take it that far.<br/>
<br/>
In my own head, I think of what I do as &quot;Relationship Parenting&quot; - a <br/>
strong and happy and supportive relationship is what I aim for. It is <br/>
how I decide what to do or say when I&#39;m not sure. I ask myself whether <br/>
this is relationship building or destructive. I mean, that seems to be <br/>
at the core of what matters most - if our relationship is good, then I <br/>
AM respecting my children&#39;s autonomy (in the sense that I&#39;m recognizing <br/>
they are a real and separate person who has their own brain and body and <br/>
their own strengths and weaknesses and are not simply a sort of parental <br/>
prosthetic) and dependence and everything else.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is another, emerging term for this - called &quot;connection parenting&quot; or &quot;connected parenting&quot;<br/>
<br/>
pam leo is probably the premier author talking about connection based parenting, and i am not sure she takes it as far as getting kids out of school either...there are lots of authors that talk about connection baesd parenting in the context of unschooling - perhaps without calling it that - naomi aldort comes to mind....<br/>
<br/>
below i have pated the &quot;definition&quot; of connected parenting that we use to describe our &quot;class&quot; on the topic - it needs updating though, to list pam leo, as well as a few other inspirations.  wee end up talking a LOT about educational options and norms as well (as in debunking the myth that school is necessary or even desireable) and many parents who are not already unschooling when they come to our class end up going in that direction.  <br/>
<br/>
we talk about asking the same exact question as you say above, essentially, in all interactions with our kids - &quot;will this connect or disconnect me from my child in this moment?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
i think SO many people are coming from a paradigm of punishments, rewards, &quot;consequences&quot;, etc. - and THAT is the paradigm that needs to shift before anything can shift on an educational level, or in terms of a more RU approach to housework, electronics, money, food, sleep....<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This class focuses on the primacy of connection in parenting children of all ages, and on parenting without punishments or rewards.   Look deeply past difficult behaviors to discover the underlying needs of our children (and ourselves), and begin to use concrete tools to respond effectively to parenting challenges.  <br/>
<br/>
Our interactive class covers respectful limit setting, developmental norms, listening to feelings and many practical ideas about what to do instead of being either an authoritarian or a permissive parent.   <br/>
<br/>
Incorporates concepts from the work of Alfie Kohn (Unconditional Parenting), Dr. Gordon Neufeld (Hold on to Your Kids), Lawrence J. Cohen (Playful Parenting) and Marshall Rosenburg (NVC), as well as the professional and personal experience of Lyla and Emily. <br/>

 Unachooling parents are in tune with their child.<br/>

I think I want to say something like: being in tune means offering food and drinks to your child through the day,<br/>

give the child tools and better options for dealing with those emotions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366063546">I liked these questions.  I&#39;m going to answer them as if they had been  <br/>
a meme on Facebook or something. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Isn&#39;t seeking Autonomy part of human nature? Isn&#39;t life about<br/>
defining/redefining, inventing who we are, about discovering<br/>
ourselves? Isn&#39;t discovering who we are really a never ending<br/>
process? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, we should never have to &quot;discover&quot; ourselves.  We should BE  <br/>
ourselves.<br/>
I don&#39;t want my kids inventing who they are.  I have worked for years  <br/>
to help them be strong and thoughtful and kind who-they-ares.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Isn&#39;t seeking a level of autonomy healthy?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Should a nursing baby seek to wean?<br/>
Weaning is healthy.   Unfortunately, &quot;weaning&quot; is often used as  <br/>
something someone does to another person.<br/>
In La Leche League, they use the term &quot;self-led weaning.&quot;  It means  <br/>
saying yes and not no, as much as possible, to a baby who indicates he  <br/>
wants to nurse.<br/>
Forcing a baby to wean is not as good as letting him taper off as his  <br/>
own interest in other foods and sources of nourishment are larger.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So then I ask is the issue behind the issue of autonomy about<br/>
balance? and in seeking balance we consider how we are affected by<br/>
the influences in our lives.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Balance of what where?<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/balance">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a><br/>
I don&#39;t see any balance in &quot;autonomy.&quot;  I see separation, and even a  <br/>
degree of rejection.  I see assumption that the autonomous other being  <br/>
will take care of his own needs and if he needs something, he&#39;ll ask;  <br/>
see ya later, I&#39;ll be over here in my own autonomous self.<br/>
<br/>
-=-based on how we are influenced/what we come to believe, we reject or<br/>
accept what others are saying and doing...by how these experiences<br/>
make us feel.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you  mean is the argument being reactionary?<br/>
All of human action is reactionary at some level.  All of biological  <br/>
life is reactionary at some level.<br/>
Could you rephrase the question?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do Unschoolers wish to be autonomous from the greater society? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers have no system of government, nor even a syndicate, and  <br/>
nobody knows what unschoolers as a group might want.<br/>
<br/>
In my family, unschooling works because my children live in the real,  <br/>
whole world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do they want to balance their way of life with that of the larger<br/>
society, do they see themselves as separate, as a sub group?<br/>
as another aspect of the larger group? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you want us to take a vote.  I think you&#39;re trying to  <br/>
figure out how you might end up seeing yourself if you become more  <br/>
involved in unschooling.  And that would depend on you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are they a group that looks/has a goal to: balance the greater<br/>
society? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes an unschooler will become enthusiastic and go off in a burst  <br/>
of expression, saying that EVERYONE should be an unschooler!  But  <br/>
that&#39;s the fervor of new love.  It&#39;s not feasible reality.   Who would  <br/>
hold the greater society still long enough for us to figure out how  <br/>
much unschooling it would take to balance them?  (I&#39;m thinking teeter- <br/>
totter.)<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;balance&quot; were you thinking &quot;compensate for&quot;?  &quot;Serve as field-to- <br/>
object?  (contrast?)&quot;  &quot;Set an example for?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Had we tried to prepare Kirby for jobs that were available when he was  <br/>
young, we would have been aiming for 1990, but he became an adult in  <br/>
the middle of the first decade of the 21st century.  We had no real  <br/>
way to prepare him for that.  What we prepared him for was to be  <br/>
comfortable as a six year old, and as a seven year old.  We helped  <br/>
make him a happy, healthy eight year old.  Time passed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are unschoolers concerned with how the larger society views and  <br/>
understands them?-=-<br/>
<br/>
To what end?  Because many of us have been interviewed by print media,  <br/>
radio, TV.  It&#39;s usually low-level fluff and nonsense.<br/>
If what we&#39;re doing is responsible and legal, the larger society only  <br/>
needs to know it&#39;s legal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I ask these questions because in my particular case I have a 13 year<br/>
old, who I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; is ready/mature/knowledgeable enough to<br/>
be as autonomous as he is seeking to be. In my case I have a child<br/>
who wants to have all controls/responsibility removed. I don&#39;t see this<br/>
as odd, but quite appropriate for a teenager... The school he<br/>
attends though has disregarded this desire in him altogether, and now<br/>
we are at an imbalance. I am searching for a way to bring this<br/>
experience back into balance.-=-<br/>
<br/>
As long as he&#39;s attending school, your options are much more limited.<br/>
If he&#39;s homeschooled, you can give him LOTS of leeway.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the job of any school to regard a child&#39;s desire to be in  <br/>
control and responsible for himself.  Not even the most radical school  <br/>
can forgo responsibility for knowing whether the child is safe and  <br/>
where he is.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729889794">I would argue that it isn&#39;t a part of human nature to be autonomous. Humans are incredibly social animals. We seek out other people and make choices based on things that will help us to get along with them, to fit in a group. David did an interesting study with pictures of people. He digitally manipulated pictures of men who had been rated as less attractive so that they were partnered with pictures of women who were rated as attractive or more attractive than the man. Anyhow female raters would rate men with more attractive women as more attractive then when they were alone or with less attractive women. It&#39;s called mate choice copying. <br/>
<br/>
I am not autonomous in my life. At some level I choose that, but there is a lot that is outside of much of my conscious decision making. I make choices based not only on my immediate biological environment (hormones, bio-rhythm, stress, genetics, etc...) but also based on thing in my physical environment. I also make a lot of choices based on the care I want to give to my family. A family who I completely do not want to be autonomous from. <br/>
<br/>
Over at Run.ning Meredith posted links to a couple of pieces on autonomy (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/nature-of-autonomy?id=2184370%3ATopic%3A52415&page=2#comments)">http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/nature-of-autonomy?id=2184370%3ATopic%3A52415&page=2#comments)</a>. I couldn&#39;t read them. I tried and it was beyond me. But in my skimming through one of the papers I read that some researcher said that they didn&#39;t believe in that anyone could truly be autonomous because they can never be outside of their environment. I think that&#39;s where I go whenever I think about autonomy.  I went and found it: Bandura (1989), for example,<br/>
defined autonomy as action that is ‘‘entirely independent’’ of the<br/>
environment (p. 1175). He then argued that because virtually all actions<br/>
are affected by one’s environment, there can be no meaningful<br/>
concept of autonomy.<br/>
<br/>
The authors of the paper dismiss his argument by saying that this idea is covered within their paradigm of Self Determination Theory and as such is not distinct from an autonomous action. I must admit I get bogged down with the number of things that weigh in on any decision I make, no matter how quickly I make it. And I think I fall in Bandura&#39;s camp. I think that I don&#39;t believe there is a meaningful concept of autonomy. <br/>

Separation, though; there&#39;s some of that.  Marty has a girlfriend.   <br/>
Holly has a boyfriend.  It&#39;s natural and desirable (even to me) that  <br/>
they will find someone else to partner up with.  Yet... it&#39;s  <br/>
separation and not autonomy, isn&#39;t it?  From my motherly point of  <br/>
view, they&#39;re &quot;becoming autonomous&quot; but from the point of view of the  <br/>

Pam, your writing is long sometimes but it has decent paragraph<br/>
breaks.  Some people don&#39;t use many breaks and a few write in long<br/>
posts with absolutely no paragraph breaks.  And that&#39;s what makes a<br/>
post harder for me to read through.<br/>

When there&#39;s a lot going on here at home (and it&#39;s rare it isn&#39;t) then<br/>
those lllloooonnnngggg paragraphs look endless.  Once I&#39;ve read the<br/>

now and could really use a good friend to hang out with.  Her answer was<br/>
to push her more, make her do stuff.  It was sooooo NOT what I needed to<br/>
hear.<br/>
<br/>
When I was thinking about what I COULD do, what was in my realm of<br/>
possibility, and what she WAS interested in, I was able to come up with<br/>
some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
She really wants to learn how to cut hair, but she&#39;s too young for the<br/>
schools around here, so I was thinking about what she could do until<br/>
then and maybe it will satisfy her desire to learn about hair care and<br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
One idea I came up with was to buy hair care products to try.  I got the<br/>
idea from her, not that she told me she wanted to do that, but she was<br/>
giving me an indepth description of some hair products that she&#39;s used<br/>
and seen the effects of and some of them, she&#39;s even research the<br/>
companies ethics, especially wether they test on animals or not.  That&#39;s<br/>
what gave me the idea, that right now, what I can do to support her<br/>
interest is to buy more hair products, more variety to play with.  All<br/>
of that will build on her knowledge of hair care products.  Personally,<br/>
I don&#39;t like going to hair dressers that have no working knowledge of<br/>
various hair care products, and I&#39;ve met many like that, some don&#39;t even<br/>
know a thing about the products they actually sell in their shops.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem like a small thing to do, buy hair care products.  However,<br/>
she&#39;s not interested in tons of other things right now, and waiting and<br/>
waiting around until she&#39;s old enough to study it in a class setting<br/>
with the idea of getting a license to cut hair, is really hard for a kid<br/>
that wants to do it NOW!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a small step in what I can do to keep her interested and learning<br/>
and expanding her knowledge in something that she loves.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;d say, unschoolers support their kids no matter how large or<br/>
small, in whatever way they can and that the way to know how and what to<br/>
support them in, is to really listen to them, and really SEE what they<br/>
like and want to explore.</div>

When Holly was too young to cut her own hair, she designed a couple of  <br/>
haircuts, drew pictures, and had me do them.<br/>
<br/>
Now that she&#39;s older, she has cut her own hair and colored it and done  <br/>
various things with it.<br/>
<br/>
What about finding times to watch people cutting hair?   Lots of  <br/>
hairdressers have big windows, or waiting rooms.   There are books and  <br/>
magazines about hairstyling.  Website, probably.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could find wigs at thrift stores and a couple of styrofoam  <br/>
wigheads or something and let her play with those.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a family you know that might let her play with their hair or  <br/>
even cut it?  Maybe someone who&#39;s going to get a haircut soon anyway  <br/>
would let her mess with the longer hair before they go in.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has found a crimper and a straightener at thrift stores.<br/>
<br/>
There are some holly-hair photos here:<br/>

what and how I actually feel.  Most of the posts I&#39;ve written on any lists probably helped <br/>
me more than anyone else--I think it&#39;s the way I most effectively work out my own *stuff*!<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The word for all of that, I think is &quot;wholeness.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; YES YES YES!  I probably think of it as a connection because I feel I was disconnected from <br/>
&gt; my self, my needs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a real gem of a thread, for me.  I have always thought of it in these terms as well--a <br/>
connection to self that children have.  I LOVE changing that idea to one of wholeness instead <br/>
(just like I really like the feeling of taking the word autonomy out of the picture).  If they stay <br/>
whole to begin with, there&#39;s no reason to &quot;establish a connection with themselves&quot;, and I, with <br/>
all of my good intentions, can actually encourage a rift.  <br/>
<br/>
I love these little realizations that shift me in subtle yet powerful ways.  They make me giddy!<br/>

OH!<br/>
I just got back from finishing a blog post in which I used the  <br/>
excellent word &quot;giddy&quot; and then found it here too!<br/>
<br/>
Giddy can be very good!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802995768"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  I ask these questions because in my particular case I have a 13 year <br/>
&gt; old,  who I don&#39;t &quot;believe&quot; is ready/mature/knowledgeable enough to <br/>
&gt; be as autonomous as he is seeking to be. In my case I have a child <br/>
&gt; who <br/>
&gt; wants to have all controls/responsibility removed.  I don&#39;t see this <br/>
&gt; as odd, but quite appropriate for a teenager...  The school he <br/>
&gt; attends though has disregarded this desire in him altogether, and now <br/>
&gt; we are at an imbalance.  I am searching for a way to bring this <br/>
&gt; experience back into balance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that your impulse to seek balance for your son is right on the money.  His behavior <br/>
is primarily a reaction--which is why it looks normal for a 13 year old to be starting a <br/>
&quot;rebellious&quot; phase.  What if there were nothing to rebel against?  What if there hadn&#39;t been <br/>
influences pushing and shaping him for the past 9 or so years--would he have to push <br/>
back?  <br/>
<br/>
I do agree with you that schooled children are looking to be more grown up than they are <br/>
really ready for, but unschooled teens usually looks so very different.  If you follow this <br/>
path, you don&#39;t really know what you&#39;ll find in six months as you and your son connect <br/>
more deeply--you can only extrapolate from the experiences of those on this list and <br/>
other unschoolers, but since your son and your family will have your own unique <br/>
experience you won&#39;t really know.  This is one of the vast differences between this <br/>
approach and school.  School pushes toward conformity and unschooling is pretty much <br/>
the opposite.  Each child is valued for who they are, in the positive, and people thrive by <br/>
having the positives recognized.<br/>
<br/>
What I see in my 13 year old son is a boy who is very relaxed to be at the age he&#39;s at.  He&#39;s <br/>
happily exploring life with me, and he shares everything with me.  I consciously made <br/>
choices when he was much younger with the teen years in mind, and they are paying off <br/>
with a kid who is perfectly comfortable with adults and tells me he feels sad when his <br/>
friends don&#39;t have good relationships with their parents.<br/>
<br/>
I know things can turn around positively for your son.<br/>
