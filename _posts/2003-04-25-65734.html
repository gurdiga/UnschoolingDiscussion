yesterday.Tuck&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
OH NOOOO!  Oh, this has me in stitches!  My cheeks are burning now from <br/>
laughing so hard!  This will be my Ethan.  He&#39;s still young, three next <br/>
month, but he is in LOVE with his &#39;dinky&#39;.  Calls it a teepee though, which <br/>
I find so amusingly cute!  He&#39;s also my streaker, so I imagine he will be <br/>
proud to show it off for quite some time to come.  Grosses his big sister <br/>
out beyond belief!  HAHAHAHA!  OUCH, this hurts!<br/>
<br/>
Jennifer, thanking Tuck for the great laugh...I needed it!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 18 yo said it was no longer DINKY in the span of about a week.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
ask him at what age.  <br/>
<br/>
I did ask him if he *measured*.  All men do, at some point.  I really hope <br/>
most of them are still in puberty when they do!  Yes, he did measure, and no, <br/>
I&#39;m not going to give the numbers.  ;)<br/>
