If we end up doing one in New Mexico, I can probably get Ramona King.   She <br/>
charges a fair amount, but she&#39;s also a homeschooling mom and she likes me.<br/>
<br/>
Her daughter, Tam, won a national storytelling competition (for kids) this <br/>
spring!  Very cool.  (Tamarind King, in case you ever hear her name.  <br/>
Homeschoolers, used to live in Houston, moved here nearly two years ago.)<br/>
