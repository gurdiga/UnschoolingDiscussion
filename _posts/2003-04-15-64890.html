&lt;&lt; Whats wrong with a skin-head rally? I went to one at 17 and had a blast<br/>

<br/>
Are we talking about different skinheads like we were about christians???<br/>
The ones I&#39;m familiar with, skinheads that is, are anti just about<br/>
everything but heterosexual white people. And they are rather on the violent<br/>
side. Now THAT&#39;S something I wouldn&#39;t want my kids being a part of.<br/>

I believe probably what you&#39;re thinking of as a skin-head rally in England <br/>
and what it would be considered in the U.S. are two way different things.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to a drunken pot party early-rave of punks, that&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
Here, you&#39;d be going to a neo-Nazi white-power thing and be given Ku Klux <br/>
Klan literature at a little booth on the side.<br/>
<br/>
I think Marty, with his shaved head and camo pants, might not want to be <br/>
photographed there and put in the paper, personally.<br/>

Yeah there are different types of skinheads. The skinhead movement is most associated with white supremacy but there are also anti-racists skinheads.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282994249">The only skin head thing that I ever went to (by accident) was a group of extremely angry young white boys in Providence RI where I got to watch three skin heads beat the crap out of a black boy that we were with. Those are the skin heads I know of and let me tell you at the formidable age of 16, this was not a good experience for me. I wouldn&#39;t let my child go, for safety sake. Peace, Kelli<br/>
