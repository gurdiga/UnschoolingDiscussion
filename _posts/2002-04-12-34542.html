<div id="ygrps-yiv-912717954">Here&#39;s what we came up with for the Welcome message and description of the<br/>
list at Yahoo.<br/>
<br/>
(And if anyone finds this type of discussion tedious or irritating, *please*<br/>
feel free to delete all messages with the &quot;New Welcome message&quot; title and<br/>
continue discussing the topics on the list that do interest you. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions on how it can be more clear are more than welcome :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be the first to admit it isn&#39;t perfect or elegant. Its purpose isn&#39;t so<br/>
much to describe the philosophy of unschooling but to help people who are<br/>
considering the list figure out if it&#39;s the right list for them. It needs to<br/>
be both welcoming and informative.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps read it from the point of view of an unschooler who will feel<br/>
comfortable with how unschooling is discussed here to see if it&#39;s clear<br/>
enough to them.<br/>
<br/>
And also read it from the point of view of someone who may think unschooling<br/>
is:<br/>
<br/>
- homeschooling, or<br/>
- what the kids do for the rest of the day after their morning lessons, or<br/>
- finding fun ways to move the kids towards a parent defined goal (like<br/>
college prep or a &quot;good&quot; education or &quot;the basics&quot;),<br/>
<br/>
or any other misdefinition you&#39;ve heard.<br/>
<br/>
It would be great if they could say after reading it &quot;That sounds<br/>
intriguing!&quot; :-) but it&#39;s even more important in terms of not wasting their<br/>
time and helping them avoid facing &quot;That&#39;s not unschooling!&quot; that they be<br/>
able to come to the conclusion &quot;Hmm, they define unschooling differently<br/>
than I do&quot; before they join the list.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what<br/>
they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent<br/>
is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with<br/>

*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning nor is it done on a part time basis. We advise reading for a week<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-796856064">Well, I like it.  But I think we are still going to have the problem <br/>

are questioning unschooling.  It&#39;s usually the attitude of the <br/>
parents that is getting questioned.  To help them think deeper about <br/>
the trust issue.  To also think deeper about the respect your <br/>
children deserve.  I don&#39;t claim to be a non coercive parent, but I&#39;m <br/>
certainly not going to come to a message board and try to defend my <br/>
lack a patience, or lack of  insight, when it come to requiring my <br/>
kids to do chores or when I yell at or punish them for....whatever.<br/>
I can feel comfortable doing things a certain way, even if i know <br/>
they are not the best way to be doing them, and all the while, <br/>
stretching myself to be better each day.<br/>
I guess I just recognize the room for growth(no matter how difficult <br/>
it can be at times).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I realize the &quot;You&#39;re not unschooling&quot; is a major hot button for many.<br/>
But the new Welcome message can&#39;t address the saying or not saying of that<br/>
specifically. And let&#39;s just work on *one* step at a time! (It took us long<br/>
enough to do that ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Helen&#39;s clear that she is *not* in favor of censoring. And taking away<br/>
people&#39;s ability to say that phrase would be censoring.<br/>
<br/>
But just because we can&#39;t (and I don&#39;t personally believe we should) ban the<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re not unschooling&quot; phrase that doesn&#39;t mean there are no solutions.<br/>
The new Welcome message *is* directed at that problem. Its purpose is to<br/>
help people realize their use of unschooling doesn&#39;t match the list&#39;s use.<br/>
(It won&#39;t eliminate all of them. And if it does we&#39;re probably defining<br/>
unschooling way too narrowly. But it&#39;s a beginning.)<br/>
<br/>
Do you see anything in the wording that would help people avoid putting<br/>
themselves in the position of being told they aren&#39;t unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I think we (the list) should feel a sense of responsibilty for the message<br/>
that&#39;s hanging outside the list we&#39;re creating. (Obviously Helen has the<br/>
final say.)  If people whose definition of unschooling departs from the<br/>
philosophy discussed here continue to join the list I think we should feel a<br/>
sense of responsibility to inform them better and look at how the list<br/>
description is worded.<br/>

It may and it may not. For me, at least, I have my beliefs but they are mine and no one else&#39;s. I will ALWAYS ask questions, and have heated passionate debates. To me debates help me grow and learn, it does not mean I am saying what the other is doing is &quot;not the right way&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot;... it&#39;s just that I want to know more. As well I also will give my opinions :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279447534">Boring stuff, but just to keep everyone informed ;-), here&#39;s the &quot;final&quot; (as<br/>
in what will go out and up but it&#39;s easy to change if anyone else has some<br/>
good suggestion on making it clearer) version.<br/>
<br/>
1) I added Shakespeare<br/>
<br/>
2) I removed &quot;moderators&quot; rather than trying to describe what they were!<br/>
<br/>
3) I kept video games. Though games may be more encompassing, I think saying<br/>
that video games can be considered educational on the list is either up<br/>
someone&#39;s alley, intriging, or a tip off that the ideas might be too radical<br/>
for their comfort.<br/>
<br/>
4) I added after the suggestion of reading for a week or two &quot;since<br/>
many listmembers love a lively debate and questioning beliefs to their<br/>
foundations&quot; to give potential new members a heads up on the fact that<br/>
debates do happen here.<br/>

======== New(est) Welcome message ========<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to the Unschooling.com Email Group,<br/>
<br/>
Please take a few minutes to go over the following message:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what<br/>
they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent<br/>
is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with<br/>
curiosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what,<br/>
when, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to<br/>
Spongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>
find out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>
learning, come join us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is<br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning nor is it done on a part time basis. We advise reading for a week<br/>
or two before posting to get a &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since<br/>
many listmembers love a lively debate and questioning beliefs to their<br/>
foundations. If you have questions about this list please feel free to<br/>
