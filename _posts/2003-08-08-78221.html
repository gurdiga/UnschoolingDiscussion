<div id="ygrps-yiv-621352855">Ok, I have some questions here.  I have been reading here and at RUL, and I have been gathering lots of great information..... My name is Stepheny, I live in N. Fl, have 7 children.  Started hsing when my now 17 y ds was 8.  Took him out of PS started 2nd gr., very relaxed, lots of reading, some forced schooling, until he balked too much.  His sisters and younger brothers never saw the inside of a school which is fine by me.  <br/>
<br/>
Now he really fought me over schooling so much that we just put it all down and said forget it, that was about 4 years ago, funny he still listens when I read aloud, and I only know this by the comments he makes as I&#39;m reading to the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Heres the questions: I notice Sandra, that you said something about Kirby taking the GED cold, are you or could you make him a diploma? From the great unschooling high school of your choice? <br/>
<br/>
Now for some more.  I noticed a post on brushing teeth how one child decided he didn&#39;t want to do it at all, (an episode of Ren and Stimpy took care of that here) but do any of you push bath time, or suggest that it may be time to take a bath?  I know that sounds stupid, but I am learning a totally new thing here.  If you ask them to do something and they say no, do you just say ok?  I can see where I am inconsistent in some things, making them do some things by force, other times I let it go, it would probably be better to wait until they just do it on their own.  No mixed messages.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if they don&#39;t want to eat dinner the moment you have it ready, they don&#39;t have to eat right then?  If they decide to eat candy from the neighborhood children instead then they just do?  I mean that is what mine are doing LOL, so just throwing this out.  <br/>
<br/>
When I say you I don&#39;t mean any particular you, please don&#39;t be offended.  <br/>
<br/>
The childrens ages are 17, he&#39;s working and paying restitution for a burglary he did, drinking some with some friends, maybe some other things... I&#39;m not pleased, any suggestions for this?<br/>
The 14 ydd is only interested in finding all she can about eminem.  Anyone have anything on that, that I can direct her in. <br/>
The 12 ydd is going to do alright with this as she is pretty self directed already... has an iguana, and is generally enjoying life right now.<br/>
The 10 y dd is following the 12, likes to crochet, reverses some letters and words in her reading, loves books with tapes so she can read along or just listen.<br/>
The 9 y ds loves games of all kinds, cartoons, cartoons, games, plays well on the computer, does not enjoy reading but does like being read to.<br/>
All are doing some math, but since I am not going to force them anymore I don&#39;t know where that will go.  I know not to worry as you all have said in posts I have read.  Do I just throw some workbooks on the table and leave them there for them to do if they want to?  When they were younger we did no school type activities and I heard them talking and they were saying they thought I was trying to keep them dumb LOL, so we picked back up.  Just some thoughts anyway.  <br/>
                                  Thanks, Stepheny<br/>

**Hi Stepheny - We ask the kids if they want to take a shower (because they<br/>

ok.  Sometimes they decide without our bringing it up that they want to take<br/>
one.<br/>

**We have some workbooks that people have given us or the kids have picked<br/>
up, and they&#39;re just mixed in with the coloring books.  Workbooks are not<br/>

<br/>
There are no stupid questions. it takes hundreds of exposures to <br/>
change thinking and then to conceive of how to put that new <br/>
thinking into actual practice. One thing that helped me right away <br/>
was to stop asking hypothetical questions and to deal directly <br/>
with the real issues my children were offering me.<br/>
<br/>
when I think aobut brushing teeth or bath times, in our house <br/>
they just aren&#39;t grounds for battles. I do say &quot;Time to brush our <br/>
teeth&quot; to the younger ones (6 and 8) but the older three (11, 14, <br/>
16) I never mention it to. We don&#39;t have powr struggles here <br/>
because the power struggles in our relationship are mostly gone <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
These little areas become battle fields, in my experience, when <br/>
parents control all different aspects of their children&#39;s lives. Then <br/>
arguing over bath taking is just one more front for the battle.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, it took me awhile to just let go of my <br/>
expectations for all aspects of life. I had to step back and watch <br/>
for awhile without suggesting toothbrushing, bath time or math. It <br/>
was time to learn what my kids did or didn&#39;t do naturally without <br/>
all my cajoling, controlling and prompting.<br/>
<br/>
After several months they&#39;ve grown convinced that I&#39;m not out to <br/>
control them and they receive suggestions to me in the same <br/>
spirit I receive them from them. We are in a cooperative effort to <br/>
help each other. So far, I help them a lot more than they help me <br/>
but that makes sense too since I&#39;m the adult with more <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you ask them to do something and they say no, do you just <br/>
 </span></blockquote>say ok?  <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s turn this around. How about asking them to do something <br/>
because you genuinely care about their answer. If you assume <br/>
that when you ask them the answer should be yes, then it wasn&#39;t <br/>
a question. It was a command veiled in a question format.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So if they don&#39;t want to eat dinner the moment you have it ready, <br/>

the neighborhood children instead then they just do?  I mean <br/>

<br/>
I guess what it sounds like to me is that your home has a lot of <br/>
detox going on. Your kids are wanting to have more say in their <br/>
lives because they haven&#39;t had it for so long. So right now they <br/>
are finding out if what they see starting to happen is actually real, <br/>
not just a facade.<br/>
<br/>
Usually after several months, kids settle down into the routines <br/>
of the family (or not) and then it won&#39;t feel as chaotic.<br/>
 <br/>

I wouldn&#39;t be pleased either. Is he getting some help? <br/>
Counseling? I&#39;m reading a fabulous book right now called &quot;Yes <br/>
Your Teen is Crazy&quot; (the title is based on new brain research that <br/>
shows that teen brains are still developping hence the title--it&#39;s <br/>
tongue in cheek) by Dr, Michael Bradley. He has great advice for <br/>
families with teens who are going through some of what you <br/>

<br/>
I have to admit: I&#39;m a closet eminem fan. I don&#39;t always love all <br/>
his songs, but I find him to be a really relevant artist and his <br/>
songs are not just catchy but insightful. The movie 8 Mile is a <br/>
terrific look at how rap is a non-violent release valve for kids who <br/>
would otherwise have every reason to act out violently and <br/>
criminally. I learned a lot watching that movie and I came to <br/>
appreciate rap in a new way.<br/>

<br/>
There are some great threads on unschooling math in the <br/>
archives. I hope you can find them. The idea isn&#39;t so much to <br/>
throw workbooks on the table as it is to allow math to be a <br/>
meaningful part of all your lives. One of my sons is running a <br/>
cookie business. He&#39;s learned a ton about math through the <br/>
cooking, pricing, purchasing, accounting and using a bank <br/>
account that goes with it. Another one uses math in his <br/>
obessession with yu-gi-oh card games. My oldest uses math in <br/>
his computer programming.<br/>
<br/>
Math is a normal part of life. Change how you see it before you try <br/>
to figure out how to &quot;get it to your kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of that was helpful.<br/>

Also, you might want to consider attending the Live & Learn UNschooling <br/>
Conference in Columbia, SC 22-24 August---just two weeks away. It&#39;s not very far <br/>
from you, right? Northern FL? <br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian will be speaking on math for young children as well as for <br/>
teens. I&#39;m VERY excited about those two presentations! Not to mention all the <br/>
other cool things going on during the weekend! <br/>
<br/>
I feel that I&#39;ve been plugging the conference CONSTANTLY for MONTHS. But if <br/>
you&#39;re new, you may have missed me! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;re really TOO close to miss this! <br/>
And you will be FILLED with unschooling joy and wisdom when you leave---what a <br/>
great way to begin an unschooling life!<br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;ll join us!<br/>

  **All are doing some math, but since I am not going to force them anymore I don&#39;t know where that will go. **<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  It will probably allow them to keep doing math in their lives.   They won&#39;t see it as separate from their lives.  It&#39;s everywhere you go, you can&#39;t escape it!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  **Do I just throw some workbooks on the table and leave them there for them to do if they want to?**<br/>
<br/>
  If they ask for workbooks,  sure.   Mine haven&#39;t.   They would much rather do fun things like what you listed your kids like to do;  listen to music, do crafts, read, play on the computer, play with our snake.   <br/>
<br/>
  Just keep letting them follow their interests.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I was just reminded of a quote of John Holt&#39;s that can help when we are wondering about what to do with kids and learning.  This is from How Children Learn,<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Birds fly, fish swim, man thinks and learns.  Therefore, we do not need to motivate children into learning by wheedling, bribing or bullying.  We do not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning.  What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as we can into their lives.  Give children as much help and guidance as they ask for; listen respectfully when they feel like talking; and then get out of the way.  We can trust them to do the rest.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  This was brought back to me again in Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s new book  _The Unprocessed Child_<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Stepheny, this is a great book for getting a look into an unschooling life and addresses a lot of what you asked about in your post.  Here&#39;s the link:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ubpub.com/unprocessedchild.html">http://www.ubpub.com/unprocessedchild.html</a><br/>

eat one meal a day.  They rarely eat breakfast, I generally like the <br/>
idea that people need to eat when hungry and not eat when they aren&#39;t <br/>
hungry, and not look at the clock much.  And we never say finish your <br/>
food or one more bite or any of that.  We totally unfood, and my kids do <br/>
very well.  Are very healthy.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;If they decide to eat candy from the neighborhood children instead then<br/>

candy from our own home.  ;-)  No really, I don&#39;t think my kids have <br/>
ever chosen to eat nothing but candy.  They might eat candy before <br/>
dinner instead of after.  <br/>
<br/>
To be honest, my kids don&#39;t really see foods in categories like good <br/>
food/bad food.  They usually get a treat when we go shopping.  Janene&#39;s <br/>
favorite treats are grape tomatoes, blueberries, and chocolate.  Lexie <br/>
usually goes for broccoli , olives (she likes to try gormet, different <br/>
flavors, etc.), and chocolate.  I&#39;m glad about the chocolate, that&#39;s <br/>
usually my treat.<br/>

<br/>
no really, why workbooks?  One really needs workbooks to learn?  I don&#39;t <br/>
think so.  My father recently had a conversation with Lexie, 8, about <br/>
how Romans had toilets and indoor plumbing and hot water and baths, etc. <br/>
so what happened to them?  I was not only amazed at how much she knew <br/>
about history but that she was an equal in the conversation, not a kid <br/>
being taught.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly we read, go do things, go to museums, have LOTS of conversation <br/>
about lots of different things, read, watch tv, and read.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup. I do. When she starts to smell, anyway. I consider it a kindness,<br/>
really, and sometimes I ask her if I&#39;m stinky, when I&#39;m trying to figure<br/>
out if I really need to fit a shower into a busy morning or I can wait<br/>
until evening.<br/>
<br/>
Just because I tell her she&#39;s getting stinky doesn&#39;t mean she *has* to<br/>
shower, although she generally does. She doesn&#39;t want to walk around with<br/>
offensive BO. When she was little, she always loved baths but didn&#39;t like<br/>
hairwashes, so we did various things with weird shampoos and hairwashing<br/>
in the sink with a sprayer and just eaving it dirty sometimes. She likes<br/>
to have it braided but after a week or so it was too knotted to braid, so<br/>
we had to wash and condition it so I could get a comb through it to braid<br/>
it...<br/>

not. If I&#39;m planning something involved (which doesn&#39;t happen very often)<br/>
and I&#39;ve talked to her about it and she&#39;s agreed, then I generally expect<br/>
her to make at least a token appearance... it seems rude not to.<br/>
Generally, though, she makes her own meals at least half the time.<br/>
Sometimes they&#39;re candy, but generally not - actually we have 3<br/>
half-eaten bags with candy in the refrigerator right now, some from<br/>
Easter (we keep it there so the ants won&#39;t attack).<br/>

The first thing I&#39;d do, if I was you, is quickly get my hands on a copy <br/>
of &quot;The Parent-Teen Breakthrough: the Relationship Approach&quot; by Mira <br/>
Kirchenbaum. Really helps you think through your priorities and get a <br/>

Bathing - ahhhh - I SO miss those days when I even thought about my <br/>
kids and bathing.  I didn&#39;t worry about it much - just did it in a fun <br/>
way. I&#39;d line up all three little girls in the back yard sometimes and <br/>
wash their hair, one after the other, with the hose (on very hot days, <br/>
obviously).  Sometimes they played with instant pudding in the tub for <br/>
a while, like fingerpaint, and then washed out the tub and themselves. <br/>
Lots of tub toys and kitchen utensils in the tub. And so on.<br/>

<br/>
  **Hi Stepheny - We ask the kids if they want to take a shower (because they<br/>
  like us to help them &#39;set up&#39;) every couple of days.  If they say no, we say<br/>
  ok.  Sometimes they decide without our bringing it up that they want to take<br/>
  one.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;So if they don&#39;t want to eat dinner the moment you have it ready, they<br/>
  don&#39;t have to eat right then?<br/>
<br/>
  **Right.  I offer it, and they decide if they&#39;re hungry/interested in what<br/>
  I&#39;ve made.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;If they decide to eat candy from the neighborhood children instead then<br/>
  they just do?<br/>
<br/>
  **They eat what they want when they want to.  I can&#39;t remember them choosing<br/>
  candy for dinner, but they have had ice cream for dinner (so have I :0)).<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Do I just throw some workbooks on the table and leave them there for them<br/>
  to do if they want to?<br/>
<br/>
  **We have some workbooks that people have given us or the kids have picked<br/>
  up, and they&#39;re just mixed in with the coloring books.  Workbooks are not<br/>
  the only (or best) way to learn something.  I wouldn&#39;t worry about providing<br/>
  workbooks.  Live an interesting, interested life, and include your children<br/>
  in it.  ~Rue<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; Now for some more.  I noticed a post on brushing teeth how <br/>

  Ren and Stimpy took care of that here) but do any of you push <br/>
  bath time, or suggest that it may be time to take a bath?  I know <br/>
  that sounds stupid, but I am learning a totally new thing here. <br/>
<br/>
  There are no stupid questions. it takes hundreds of exposures to <br/>
  change thinking and then to conceive of how to put that new <br/>
  thinking into actual practice. One thing that helped me right away <br/>
  was to stop asking hypothetical questions and to deal directly <br/>
  with the real issues my children were offering me.<br/>
<br/>
  when I think aobut brushing teeth or bath times, in our house <br/>
  they just aren&#39;t grounds for battles. I do say &quot;Time to brush our <br/>
  teeth&quot; to the younger ones (6 and 8) but the older three (11, 14, <br/>
  16) I never mention it to. We don&#39;t have powr struggles here <br/>
  because the power struggles in our relationship are mostly gone <br/>
  now.<br/>
<br/>
  These little areas become battle fields, in my experience, when <br/>
  parents control all different aspects of their children&#39;s lives. Then <br/>
  arguing over bath taking is just one more front for the battle.<br/>
<br/>
  With unschooling, it took me awhile to just let go of my <br/>
  expectations for all aspects of life. I had to step back and watch <br/>
  for awhile without suggesting toothbrushing, bath time or math. It <br/>
  was time to learn what my kids did or didn&#39;t do naturally without <br/>
  all my cajoling, controlling and prompting.<br/>
<br/>
  After several months they&#39;ve grown convinced that I&#39;m not out to <br/>
  control them and they receive suggestions to me in the same <br/>
  spirit I receive them from them. We are in a cooperative effort to <br/>
  help each other. So far, I help them a lot more than they help me <br/>
  but that makes sense too since I&#39;m the adult with more <br/>
  experience.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;If you ask them to do something and they say no, do you just <br/>

  the neighborhood children instead then they just do?  I mean <br/>
  that is what mine are doing LOL, so just throwing this out. <br/>
<br/>
  I guess what it sounds like to me is that your home has a lot of <br/>
  detox going on. Your kids are wanting to have more say in their <br/>
  lives because they haven&#39;t had it for so long. So right now they <br/>
  are finding out if what they see starting to happen is actually real, <br/>
  not just a facade.<br/>
<br/>
  Usually after several months, kids settle down into the routines <br/>
  of the family (or not) and then it won&#39;t feel as chaotic.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  I wouldn&#39;t be pleased either. Is he getting some help? <br/>
  Counseling? I&#39;m reading a fabulous book right now called &quot;Yes <br/>
  Your Teen is Crazy&quot; (the title is based on new brain research that <br/>
  shows that teen brains are still developping hence the title--it&#39;s <br/>
  tongue in cheek) by Dr, Michael Bradley. He has great advice for <br/>
  families with teens who are going through some of what you <br/>
  shared here.<br/>

<br/>
  I have to admit: I&#39;m a closet eminem fan. I don&#39;t always love all <br/>
  his songs, but I find him to be a really relevant artist and his <br/>
  songs are not just catchy but insightful. The movie 8 Mile is a <br/>
  terrific look at how rap is a non-violent release valve for kids who <br/>
  would otherwise have every reason to act out violently and <br/>
  criminally. I learned a lot watching that movie and I came to <br/>
  appreciate rap in a new way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;Do I just throw some workbooks on the table and leave them <br/>

  did no school type activities and I heard them talking and they <br/>
  were saying they thought I was trying to keep them dumb LOL, <br/>
  so we picked back up.  <br/>
<br/>
  There are some great threads on unschooling math in the <br/>
  archives. I hope you can find them. The idea isn&#39;t so much to <br/>
  throw workbooks on the table as it is to allow math to be a <br/>
  meaningful part of all your lives. One of my sons is running a <br/>
  cookie business. He&#39;s learned a ton about math through the <br/>
  cooking, pricing, purchasing, accounting and using a bank <br/>
  account that goes with it. Another one uses math in his <br/>
  obessession with yu-gi-oh card games. My oldest uses math in <br/>
  his computer programming.<br/>
<br/>
  Math is a normal part of life. Change how you see it before you try <br/>
  to figure out how to &quot;get it to your kids.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Hope some of that was helpful.<br/>

Hi Stephany,<br/>
<br/>
Instead of workbooks, why not get some puzzles and games and have them on<br/>
the table. I put out different craft stuff every week and a new game or<br/>
puzzle too. I also bought a tub of pattern blocks (having heard about them<br/>
from this list) and they sit on the table all the time, though mostly I&#39;m<br/>
the one who plays with them.&lt;g&gt;  My 4yod loves to play with the Cuisinare<br/>
rods and builds with them, She made a computer with them last week.<br/>
<br/>
 Tape measures are great too. I haven&#39;t met a kid yet who didn&#39;t love<br/>
playing with them. Games; puzzles,  chess, monopoly, trisolitaire, dominoes,<br/>
computer and video games, there is no end to them! My son has struggled<br/>
through workbooks and hasn&#39;t been able to grasp numbers until we stopped<br/>
using them and just played games.<br/>

  Pam Sorooshian will be speaking on math for young children as well as for <br/>

<br/>

  you&#39;re new, you may have missed me! &lt;G&gt; You&#39;re really TOO close to miss this! <br/>
  And you will be FILLED with unschooling joy and wisdom when you leave---what a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31696908">Good to know they won&#39;t starve!  I have been pretty free with the snacks, they go with dad to the store everyone has a candy bar, special things at the grocery, and they have a little money of their own to buy with.Last week Caitlin dd10 would have spent her 5 dollars on candy, but my mom made me aware of it, and then it suddenly didn&#39;t look right.  UGH!! Now I wish I had shrugged and let her do it.  And the dinner thing, yeesh, and I asked them, I miss dinner together I guess, but they wish to stay out and not break from playing. Sooo Caitlin says well I guess we don&#39;t have any choice *BG* but they do now.  Maybe I will just make dinner later... like 8 or 9    we stay up till all hours anyway, it couldn&#39;t hurt.

  &gt; &gt;&gt;but do any of you push bath time, or suggest that it may be time to <br/>
  &gt; take a<br/>
  &gt; bath?<br/>
<br/>
  my kids love to take baths.  Lots of fun water play.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;So if they don&#39;t want to eat dinner the moment you have it ready, they<br/>
  &gt; don&#39;t have to eat right then?<br/>
<br/>
  nope, why would I make them eat if they weren&#39;t hungry.  Sometimes they <br/>
  eat one meal a day.  They rarely eat breakfast, I generally like the <br/>
  idea that people need to eat when hungry and not eat when they aren&#39;t <br/>
  hungry, and not look at the clock much.  And we never say finish your <br/>
  food or one more bite or any of that.  We totally unfood, and my kids do <br/>
  very well.  Are very healthy.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;If they decide to eat candy from the neighborhood children instead then<br/>
  &gt; they just do?<br/>
<br/>
  They don&#39;t usually eat candy from the neighborhood children, they eat <br/>
  candy from our own home.  ;-)  No really, I don&#39;t think my kids have <br/>
  ever chosen to eat nothing but candy.  They might eat candy before <br/>
  dinner instead of after.  <br/>
<br/>
  To be honest, my kids don&#39;t really see foods in categories like good <br/>
  food/bad food.  They usually get a treat when we go shopping.  Janene&#39;s <br/>
  favorite treats are grape tomatoes, blueberries, and chocolate.  Lexie <br/>
  usually goes for broccoli , olives (she likes to try gormet, different <br/>
  flavors, etc.), and chocolate.  I&#39;m glad about the chocolate, that&#39;s <br/>
  usually my treat.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; &gt;&gt;Do I just throw some workbooks on the table and leave them there for <br/>
  &gt; them<br/>
  &gt; to do if they want to?<br/>
<br/>
  Workbooks, what are those?<br/>
<br/>
  no really, why workbooks?  One really needs workbooks to learn?  I don&#39;t <br/>
  think so.  My father recently had a conversation with Lexie, 8, about <br/>
  how Romans had toilets and indoor plumbing and hot water and baths, etc. <br/>
  so what happened to them?  I was not only amazed at how much she knew <br/>
  about history but that she was an equal in the conversation, not a kid <br/>
  being taught.<br/>
<br/>
  Mostly we read, go do things, go to museums, have LOTS of conversation <br/>
  about lots of different things, read, watch tv, and read.  <br/>

  And here&#39;s a gratuitious Vonnegut quote I found when looking for that other <br/>
  one:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds <br/>
  himself no wiser than before...He is full of murderous resentment of people who <br/>
  are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way.&quot;<br/>
  -Kurt Vonnegut, Cat&#39;s Cradle <br/>
<br/>
  Interesting Sandra, I&#39;ve often thought of Neal ds 17 and how we&#39;ve schooled and how he unschooled himself so rebelliously. Full of resentment, he is, and I have apologized to him, telling him I didn&#39;t know better.  I&#39;m glad we talk, and even after we went through the police thing, he put his head on my lap as if he were 4 again.  We are learning together.  Stepheny<br/>

Like I said in one of my posts, we talk, we are close, I have apologized to him, first one hs&#39;ed yada, yada, he says he knows, he forgives.  We joke together, I don&#39;t chase him around saying anything about the drinking, except I wish he would reconsider his decisions... Not sure if thats right either.

  The first thing I&#39;d do, if I was you, is quickly get my hands on a copy <br/>
  of &quot;The Parent-Teen Breakthrough: the Relationship Approach&quot; by Mira <br/>
  Kirchenbaum. Really helps you think through your priorities and get a <br/>
  focus on the long-term - which is, as I&#39;m sure you know, critical when <br/>
  parenting teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
  Also - what you do about high school graduation, diplomas, and all that <br/>
  depends on what your son wants to do with himself and what the laws are <br/>
  in your state.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a tent that I would be happy to bring along, if you&#39;d like!<br/>
<br/>
Also, you could see (even at this late date) if anyone would be into <br/>
sharing a room with you.  That&#39;s what we did last year and we&#39;re doing it <br/>
again this year and not only does it make it more affordable, but it&#39;s <br/>
really cool to be in close proximity with another unschooling family.  Last <br/>
year, we were the only unschoolers we knew. It was great for Liam (my son) <br/>
and for me to see other unschoolers in action, doing the same or similar <br/>
things we do.<br/>
<br/>
Going to the conference is one of the best possible things you can do for <br/>
your unschooling, and you shouldn&#39;t let a goofy thing like money stop you!<br/>
<br/>
Marji, who is REALLY looking forward!!! <br/>
