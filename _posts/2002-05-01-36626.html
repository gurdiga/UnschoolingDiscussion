<div id="ygrps-yiv-732494061">*How to Read a French Fry * is a great book about why certain<br/>
cooking techniques work.  Given the current preoccupation with<br/>
Ice Cream, Doughnuts, and Dead Kine, folks might like to strew it<br/>
among their own cookbook section.  I know that I am a serious<br/>
enough cook to benefit from it - and that I have learned a hell<br/>
of a lot more chemistry in the kitchen than in somebody else&#39;s<br/>
lab.<br/>
