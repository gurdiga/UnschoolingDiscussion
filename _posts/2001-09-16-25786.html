&lt;&lt; I&#39;m struggling right now with fine-tuning my philosophy of <br/>
 education.  It would be tremendously helpful if anyone is willing to <br/>
 share why they believe unschooling is the best way to go.  Why not <br/>
 the Charlotte Mason approach?  Or the Moore Formula?  Why do you <br/>
 believe what you believe?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The short answer?  For me?  It feels right.  It&#39;s following my instincts,<br/>
and this is where they have led me and following instincts is how<br/>
I live my life.  Its really that simple for me.  Just like I knew that <br/>
homebirth<br/>
was the way my children would be born, long before I have even researched<br/>
it and found out how safe it was and wonderful and natural.  Had there been<br/>
no books to read, I would have still known in my heart it was the right<br/>
thing for us to do.<br/>
<br/>
The long answer?  I don&#39;t know much about the other methods, but that<br/>
is what they are, to me, is methods, whereas unschooling is a lifestyle.<br/>
I almost wish we could come up with another name for what we do, <br/>
because its not just about school or un or education, but about living<br/>
and lives and being curious human beings. <br/>
<br/>
The Moore&#39;s from what I <br/>
understand have done intensive research which has shown <br/>
children are better left to play and not ready to learn academics until<br/>
8-10-12 yrs old.  This fits in well with unschooling, at least in the early<br/>
years and from what I know it is solid research supporting this.<br/>
<br/>
A friend just loaned me her Charlotte Mason book. She is putting together<br/>
a once a month CM night to discuss the book by chapters and she is<br/>
really hoping I will attend to give the unschooling view of CM.  I have yet<br/>
to crack the book so I don&#39;t know if its something I&#39;ll even be able to do.<br/>
Will it &quot;offend&quot; my pure unschooling sensibilities, or will I say hey that<br/>
sounds like a great idea, I might offer this to my children? &lt;shrugging<br/>
shoulders&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The only thing I have heard about CM is the nature notebook idea.<br/>
I thought that sounded cool as we camp alot and it seemed like<br/>
something they would like to do. I got the kids (and myself cos its<br/>
something I thought would be fun too) nice notebooks and colored <br/>
pencils for drawing plants etc.  But what I dont&#39; do is insist<br/>
that this book is &quot;only&quot; for our nature notebooks. If I had done that then<br/>
the self portraits that my children drew wouldn&#39;t have been included, <br/>
including the one done by a friend they met on one trip.  It wouldn&#39;t include<br/>
the couple of pages used at park day for my dd and her friend to play<br/>
writing games or math games (they each wrote a line of numbers and<br/>
had the mommys add them up to see who &quot;won&quot; &lt;g&gt;).  I could have<br/>
ruined some great moments/ideas had I said no you can&#39;t use your<br/>
nature notebooks for that.  And no, I <br/>
don&#39;t go home looking up the trees and flowers we find. I have good<br/>
intentions but they are not real interested in that right now. I am <br/>
thinking though that I might become more interested myself soon<br/>
as I am purchasing a book on plant allergies and since I have recently<br/>
developed allergies in the past few years, it is of more concern to<br/>
me now.  Anyhow, this has sort of rambled off onto a how we <br/>
unschool or how it relates to our life and I suppose its all connected<br/>
to why we believe in the philosophy of unschooling, somehow in<br/>
my disjointed writing style this evening! <br/>
<br/>
I know this has been said several times before, but go to the <br/>
unschooling.com website. There are some wonderful essays on<br/>
peoples thoughts and feelings about unschooling. I have read them<br/>
and each time I sit and nod my head in agreement and I just want<br/>
to say ditto!<br/>
<br/>
Hope I have helped you some!<br/>

that they are going to learn X now (truly learn, absorb, understand -- not <br/>
just pass the quiz) just isn&#39;t right for us.  I tried -- I got the state <br/>
standards and checked them off (I was not one of the lucky ones who knew <br/>
about this at the beginning) -- they were ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the other methods you mention may have bits and pieces that are <br/>
helpful if something comes up.  I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
<br/>
I just feel like the answers are pretty easy -- if my son asks me about the <br/>
time it takes for light to travel from a star and as he is standing in the <br/>
backyard with a flashlight how long it would be before that light reaches the <br/>
star -- that&#39;s whatever subject you want to call it but it&#39;s also looking <br/>
stuff up -- I don&#39;t know all that off the top of my head -- and it&#39;s him <br/>
learning how to look stuff up -- and it&#39;s him thinking beyond our backyard.  <br/>
That last bit is very important to me.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if they would be covering that in his 3rd grade class if he were <br/>
in school.  It might not &quot;fit.&quot;  It might not fit in any set plan or <br/>
curriculum.  But we like it.  And it fits him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why.  Not clear probably but that&#39;s why.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857772762">&lt;&lt; I&#39;m struggling right now with fine-tuning my philosophy of <br/>
education.  It would be tremendously helpful if anyone is willing to <br/>
share why they believe unschooling is the best way to go.  Why not <br/>
the Charlotte Mason approach?  Or the Moore Formula?  Why do you <br/>
believe what you believe?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about Charlotte Mason or the Moores when I started <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of aspects of my life came together to make me a confident advocate of <br/>
unschooling.  Part of it was the things I learned on my own because I wanted <br/>
to, when I was a kid.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to sew without home-ec, starting at 13.  A friend of mine loaned me <br/>
an A-line skirt pattern, unfolded it, told me what the notches and lines <br/>
were, and I went home and made a skirt.  My grandmother, who had been a <br/>
professional tailor for a while (doing Western suits with those little <br/>
arrow-point slit pockets and all fancy stuff) helped me with a harder skirt <br/>
later, and it was a terrible experience--she was super picky and I cried.  <br/>
Then I started sewing without patterns, and have designed stuff and done lots <br/>
of costumes.  That, though, was done because I wanted to, and I&#39;ve seen lots, <br/>
dozens, of friends start as adults knowing zip about sewing and get to the <br/>
point that they could do Elizabethan costuming (which I don&#39;t do) without <br/>
having taken any formal lessons, workshops, zip--jut watching other people, <br/>
reading, experimenting, and having the desire.<br/>
<br/>
I learned to play guitar between my first lesson (I was barely 15, the age <br/>
Kirby my oldest is now) and waiting for another one (which was never needed.  <br/>
I really liked English and Scottish ballads (and American version of them), <br/>
and wanted to play guitar while I sang, so I worked on that for a few years.  <br/>
I still make use of that most months at folksinging parties at a friend&#39;s <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
For recorder, free classes were advertised when I was 17.  I called the <br/>
instructor (John Truitt, who became a good friend of mine) that morning and <br/>
asked what the difference between beginning and intermediate was.  He said <br/>
beginning class they didn&#39;t know how to read music, and didn&#39;t know the <br/>
fingerings.   I learned the fingerings, went to both classes, stayed in the <br/>
intermediate, and was in a Renaissance performance group with John within a <br/>
year.  I used to tell people he taught me to play recorder, and he would say <br/>
he did not.  Because I liked it, I learned it.  Because there was a real <br/>
reason to get better and it was fascinating, I learned it quickly.<br/>
<br/>
By the time most of that was in process, I was in college and taking <br/>
education courses to get a teaching certificate.  It was the early 70&#39;s and <br/>
the University of New Mexico was a hippie hotbed of school reform and the <br/>
open classroom theories and practices.  They had us read John Holt and other <br/>
radicals of the day.  They told me (I still have the notebooks I wrote it in) <br/>
that teaching didn&#39;t exist; only learning really existed.  The best we could <br/>
do was to be the facilitators of other people&#39;s learning, and that kids in <br/>
school would learn willingly if they were respected, encouraged and given <br/>
interesting experiences.  There were studies at the time they were having us <br/>
read (many from library sources or bad old photocopies I don&#39;t have anymore; <br/>
I wish I did!) about the successes of open classroom situation in schools in <br/>
alternative schools and at lab schools at universities.  They advocated <br/>
mixed-age classes and multi-level flexibility (ungraded classrooms--one could <br/>
be doing advanced math while being a beginning reader, or vice versa, in <br/>
different combinations).  I had no reason not to believe them and much reason <br/>
TO believe them.<br/>
<br/>
In practice it wasn&#39;t working as well as it was supposed to have worked, and <br/>
over the years I had much opportunity to figure out some of the reasons why.<br/>
<br/>
By the time I quit teaching I was hugely involved in the Society for Creative <br/>
Anachronism, where people learn freely, quickly or slowly, joyfully and <br/>
effectively all kinds of things from soap making to calligraphy, armoring to <br/>
woodwork, because they have a real reason to want to.  They learn from each <br/>
other and from historical sources and modern instructions based on historical <br/>
armor, costume, jewelry, recipes--whatever.  There I had thousands of real <br/>
life examples, having been a corporate officer several times, twice the top <br/>
officer, and having been surrounded by that HUGE learning lab for 24 years <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
When I had children I went to La Leche League for years, from which I got the <br/>
attachment parenting model.  I came again upon John Holt&#39;s writings, through <br/>
Chop Wood, Carry Water (in which he&#39;s quoted and footnoted), The Continuum <br/>
Concept (which he wrote the attestation for), which are two books he didn&#39;t <br/>
write but were written by people who had read his stuff.  I bought some of <br/>
his newer books, written since I&#39;d been out of school, which now said that <br/>
school reform didn&#39;t work and the best thing people really interested in how <br/>
people learn could do would be to take their kids out of school (or never <br/>
send them). I subscribed to Growing Without Schooling, and bought a bunch of <br/>
back issues, and read every single word.<br/>
<br/>
I was in a La Leche League-based (all the families met in LLL) babysitting <br/>
co-op with four homeschooling families, two structured and two unschooling.  <br/>
The unschooling families were much warmer and happier with each other than <br/>
the structured families were.  One structured family, the mom spanked the <br/>
toddler.  That was sad.  The other one had homework, grounding, punishments, <br/>
shaming.  The two unschooling families (Carol Rice and Lori Odhner&#39;s <br/>
families) were also the families of my first two LLL leaders, and I was <br/>
altogether impressed with their patience and the kids&#39; sweetness and the <br/>
obvious love between parents and children.<br/>
<br/>
That was enough to sell me on it already, but since then I&#39;ve had three <br/>
children not go to school, learn to read, learn math, ask wonderful questions <br/>
about history and science, make wonderful observations on interpersonal <br/>
relations and music and art, and have had no cause for doubt.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been afraid to share the details of the interactions between me <br/>
and my kids even when I was frustrated and yucky with them sometimes, even <br/>
when I was afraid something wasn&#39;t going to happen.  I had two and a half <br/>
reading lessons with Kirby when he was seven, and the half was because I <br/>
realized what a horrible thing I was doing and stopped halfway throught he <br/>
third one because he was crying and I was crying and there has never been <br/>
another lesson since, but he reads as well as anyone his age and better than <br/>
many, which I know because I&#39;ve taught kids his age before and I remember how <br/>
some of them struggled.<br/>
<br/>
I know firsthand what teachers go through when they really want to help <br/>
reform a system that is bigger than all the reformers put together will ever <br/>
be.  I have vivid memories of being a kid.  I remember where I sat, every <br/>
year since first grade (I didn&#39;t go to kindergarten).  I remember the books <br/>
we used.  I remember the songs we sang.  I taught in the same buildings I had <br/>
gone to school in, 7th grade in the school where I had gone from 2nd to 9th, <br/>
and 9th grade in the building in which I had gone to high school.  that was <br/>
another bigtime lab, teaching alongside many of the people who had been my <br/>
teachers.  I&#39;ve spent lots of time with kids who wanted school to be <br/>
different, kids who had given up, kids who managed to make the most of it, <br/>
kids who learned more from the books they were hiding under their texbooks <br/>
than from all of school (and I had been one of them myself, so I never got <br/>
grumpy if they were reading another book during lessons).  I&#39;ve talked to <br/>
their parents, to their other teachers, I know some of their children now <br/>
(mostly in school, but one homeschooling family I know, the mom was in my <br/>
class, and her sister-in-law was too; not her husband though).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been active in online homeschooling stuff since *Prodigy&#39;s homeschooling <br/>
forum in 1991 or so, through AOL&#39;s glory days, and the beginnings of <br/>
unschooling.com to now, so I&#39;ve gotten to read and become acquainted with <br/>
(sometimes in person, once from my husband driving me and the whole family to <br/>
Indiana) lots of unschooling families I&#39;ve stayed in touch with, so I&#39;ve seen <br/>
their kids growing and grown (in some cases).<br/>
<br/>
There are other stories, but that&#39;s lots, and that&#39;s probably enough.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no doubts.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Moore&#39;s &quot;forumla&quot;  is basically unschooling until the age of 12 or so<br/>
and then a move toward academics for high school.  Most children will do<br/>
this on their own. It&#39;s sort of a natural progression, since those 12 year<br/>
olds really do want to join the adults in making a living and being<br/>
independent.  The Moore&#39;s just move into *bookwork* mode, but acknowledge<br/>
that not every child will want or need the same thing. A hands on learner<br/>
will stil lbe a hands on learner, so things should be geared to the child.<br/>
If you can read between the language used, you&#39;ll find that it&#39;s not a lack<br/>
of trust in the children, but rather an expectation that *education* means<br/>
standard school fare for the Moore&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte Mason sort of confuses me.  Narration of a story? Why make that<br/>
some formal exercise, don&#39;t you talk about the books you read anyway?  Same<br/>
thing with a nature journal.... why make it so formal? We draw and talk<br/>
about the world around us all the time.  Read real books instead of twaddle,<br/>
why of course!  I&#39;ve used the material on Charlotte Mason&#39;s ideas just like<br/>
I have used Holt&#39;s and The Moore&#39;s,  I&#39;ve gleaned ideas, used what worked<br/>
and left the rest behind.<br/>
<br/>
I believe what I believe about education simply because it rings that truth<br/>
bell inside of me.  I know how my own educaiton has progressed during my<br/>
life and I&#39;ve watched my four children over the last decade.  Trusting them<br/>
to grow and learn has been a joy.</div>
