<div id="ygrps-yiv-752608560">I have two boys...so I have divided up chores and the use of the computer and <br/>
tv and the nintendo...based on odd and even days....<br/>
<br/>
My older son was born in an even month...this way I don&#39;t have to think about <br/>
it to much...whose day it is...<br/>
<br/>
Once they get chores done, whatever projects we are doing done...etc...then <br/>
they have free reighn on the tv, nintendo, or pc...cuz I only have one <br/>
tv...as long as I don&#39;t have anything that I want to watch...the tv and <br/>
nintendo are paired up...so if it is say Scotti&#39;s day for nintendo...but <br/>
Kevyn wants to watch tv...Kevyn has to wait until his day for the tv...the pc <br/>
and nintendo are on opposite days...so that one can be on each of them...<br/>
<br/>
Once I set this down as rules...everything got much saner...and I don&#39;t have <br/>
a problem letting them know that they have got to stop the pc or nintendo <br/>
when there is something to do...or dinner to eat...or whatever...<br/>
