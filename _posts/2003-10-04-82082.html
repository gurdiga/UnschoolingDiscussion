<div id="ygrps-yiv-9300123">Dear all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on this list a while now and thought it was about time I said hello.  I&#39;m Emma, mum to Chloe (5) and Ethan (16 months), my partner is Paul a web designer.  We are in the UK, a few miles north of London and have recently taken the plunge into home education.  Unschooling (or autonomous learning as it&#39;s called here) is the area of home ed that I&#39;m very much drawn to.  When my daughter came out of school (she was there for 6 months) she said she was happy to be in &#39;mummy school&#39;..just recently she came out with &#39; I don&#39;t want to be in any school, not even mummy school - I just want to be me.&#39; :)<br/>
<br/>
She enjoys drawing and maths and loves being out doors so we do a lot of this whenever she wants - my younger one is very easy going and is happy to be involved in whatever we are doing or else entertain himself.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say how I&#39;ve enjoyed reading all the posts and I look forward to learning a lot<br/>
<br/>
warm wishes<br/>
Emma<br/>
