As I&#39;ve said before, <br/>
<br/>
before unschooling I would never have considered letting my children watch unlimited TV, maybe PBS, but not even that!<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Well, this morning Kyra, 5dd, was watching Cartoon Network (this was really a channel that I didn&#39;t think could be educational before unschooling).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On Sylvester and Tweety,  they talked and showed how an orchestra/band is recorded for a CD;   showed the control room with the workers and how they could turn up different instruments parts and all the mechanics behind it.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was in shock!<br/>
