opposites attract!  even tho it may be discouraging that you are finding <br/>
things out after 19yrs of marriage, dont panic.  there is beauty in your <br/>
blend, and with that in mind you will come to your answers....<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think all four of my kids <br/>
have thrived by unschooling, but my husband is very, very worried (and so our <br/>
my parents, and I have to admit that at times, they can even get me worried <br/>
when they keep going on and on about it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
worry and stress make me grouchy, too!  i would guess the whole &quot;unsatisfied <br/>
w/the progress&quot; thing has a lot to do with it...  your letter brings up a lot <br/>
of issues because i dont think i will be able to be very trusting if my kids <br/>
are verrrry unmotivated teenagers!!!  i can tell that it would frustrate me, <br/>
so i am thinking ahead about things i may have to face in the future.<br/>
<br/>
as a sidenote, your son may enjoy the book by steven covey, 7 habits of <br/>
highly effective people as an antidote to non-motivation...  it reminds them <br/>
that they have choices about how they are spending their time. and helps them <br/>
ask themselves what is important to them...<br/>
<br/>
altho it sounds like your son has some great things going with scouts and <br/>
church...  and, like you i dont expect children at age 18 to know what they <br/>
want to do with their lives!  (i certainly did not!) <br/>

I wanted to say that I was one of those unmotivating thoroughly fruistrating <br/>
teenagers, and the trick was travel.  Once I traveled I realized how much I <br/>
hadnt done yet.  Out local college ahs stuff that give kids opportunities to <br/>
go almost everywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
Thought I would put in my 2 cents!<br/>

    LOL   I am just learning what I want to do with my life now!!  And I am <br/>
39!<br/>
I guess we are silly expecting more out of 17 or 18 year olds than we do <br/>
ourselves!<br/>

It&#39;s not just you.  I notice other people doing this as well.  People who are <br/>
in their 30s, who are unsatisfied with their careers, seem to kick themselves <br/>
and wish they had worked harder in school and in their early career years.  <br/>
Then they look at their teens and don&#39;t understand why they can&#39;t zap their <br/>
world-weary maturity straight into the heads of their teens.  It&#39;s just not <br/>
possible for a teen to instantly leap forwards 20 years in maturity, no <br/>
matter how much their parents want them to.<br/>
<br/>
(This is not aimed at your family -- just a tangent inspired by your smart <br/>
observation.)<br/>
