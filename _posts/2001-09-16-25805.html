I personally believe this:  Nobody&#39;s &#39;approach&#39;  is right for my family<br/>
except ours.  We run pretty much as a democracy with a few exceptions. <br/>
This description is all general and subject to fluidity on any given day.<br/>
 My personal input into the family is as organizer.  I keep us all on<br/>
track and moving.  The kids each have different jobs.  Rachel is in<br/>
charge of outside stuff for the most part although some of the gardens<br/>
are mine.  Jenni is in charge of books (becasue she has read them all)<br/>
and a lot of inside stuff.  Wyndham is in charge of making Wyndham grow<br/>
up.  When the girls were his age they went through similar albeit less<br/>
troublesome phases.  We have a job list and some basic guidelines for<br/>
getting the housework done fairly.  But none of that has anything to do<br/>
with &#39;education&#39;.  As for learning and schoolwork, our lifestyle is a<br/>
little less easy to explain.  I do require that my girls be doing<br/>
something.  I have some basic suggestions loosely attached to the<br/>
jobslist but they can and often do fly out the window.  Rachel has a<br/>
violin she is learning to play and if she is doing that, I&#39;m happy with<br/>
it.  If she were vegging out and not doing ANYTHING for a prolonged<br/>
period of time, I would worry and check into her allergy and depression<br/>
levels.  So the list and the requirement for &#39;something&#39; is more a<br/>
medical watch thing than it is about school work.  <br/>
But then the dynamics here are a bit odd too.  Rachel and Wyndham (oldest<br/>
and youngest) have most of the medical problems and are most physically<br/>
active.  The middle one, Jenni, often ends up holding things together and<br/>
helping me the most but for anyone looking in from the outside it appears<br/>
she is not doing much.  <br/>
The so called basic school stuff, math, history, english, etc. are so<br/>
meshed into our lives that I can&#39;t even say this is what we do to teach<br/>
that.  I just know that my uncle was astounded at Rachel&#39;s knowledge of<br/>
history and politics a week or so ago.  I didn&#39;t &#39;teach&#39; her that.  She<br/>
just &#39;is&#39; that.<br/>
<br/>
So my best advice is to figure out what works for you.  Don&#39;t try to<br/>
assign names to it (because someone somewhere will try to tell you that<br/>
that isn&#39;t what you are doing) and just do it and don&#39;t look back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-899654429">Growth is indeed gradual, but I think it&#39;s also easy to forget that it&#39;s not a<br/>
smooth, steady slope. It&#39;s often a sudden spurt followed by a slide, followed by<br/>
a plateau, followed by a spurt in another area entirely. (This may be totally<br/>
off-topic here, but I got off on the gradual growth tangent.)<br/>
<br/>
Somehow the inlaws (or whomever) see only the slide, plateau, and change in<br/>
direction.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10401202">&lt;&lt; Just curious but what topic exactly do you feel is unschooling? IMO any <br/>
and <br/>
all is educational, knowing other&#39;s views and ideas, whether we share those <br/>
same beliefs or not. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to run new unschoolers off.  I know I responded the same way.<br/>
<br/>
Newer homeschoolers/unschoolers often have a vision of schoolwork in their <br/>
heads, and they&#39;re hoping for an alternate way to get that small set of <br/>
knowledge (which probably seems big from their point of view, at first) into <br/>
their kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Older homechoolers realize that the &quot;set of knowledge&quot; is as much as can be <br/>
gathered from interaction, experience and discussion in the whole world, for <br/>
the rest of one&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
So to the newer people here, since we&#39;re not talking about children and <br/>
math/English/science/history, we&#39;re not talking about unschooling.  But we <br/>
ARE talking about history.  Don&#39;t you expect people born in 1930 to be able <br/>
to tell you something about WWII?  Our kids will be called on by their <br/>
grandkids to tell them what they remember about the war that began in their <br/>
childhoods.  It won&#39;t be, I hope, &quot;I don&#39;t remember anything except people <br/>
put flags on their cars and my mom kept singing &#39;God Bless America.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And we ARE talking English, and political science.  How is a nation informed <br/>
and made supportive of a war?  Why will soldiers happily go to war?  Why will <br/>
the families back home happily accept it?  There are motivations in <br/>
historical movements.   &quot;Why?&quot; will lead to why when the kids are coming <br/>
across the history of Poland, of South Africa, of the Moors in medieval <br/>
Spain, of the Roman Empire.<br/>
<br/>
The sooner a family cuts loose from the school model where kids learn certain <br/>
things and parents consider they are &quot;through with school&quot; and don&#39;t have to <br/>
learn, the sooner unschooling will actually work instead of just being a <br/>
model which isn&#39;t quite fitting the family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159064851">Hi List!<br/>
<br/>
  I have been enjoying your posts for a while now since rejoining the list.  My name is Bronwen and my husband and I have three children, dd 13, ds 9, ds 16 months. I wanted to comment on the baby feeding analogy:<br/>
<br/>
  Shelly wrote~~<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt; I am starting to see homeschooling/unschooling like feeding a baby. (I know<br/>
  &gt; strange but stick with me for a minute here) We either breast fed totally,<br/>
  &gt; bottle-fed totally  or did a little of both.  I am sure we have all seen heated<br/>
  &gt; arguments about this online and maybe even in a play group. But  the most<br/>
  &gt; important thing was to get the child fed right? Be it by bottle or breast. Well<br/>
  &gt; I see it the same way. All I want is my children to be happy and and that hunger<br/>
  &gt; to learn fed. Be it by a small amount of structure like my 9 year old needs or<br/>
  &gt; total freedom like my 10  and 7 year olds thrive well in or a tad of both like<br/>
  &gt; my 13 year old.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  AH!  I agree with you- but not the analogy.   To me, a better analogy would be-<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Unschooling&quot; is like feeding a baby-  when the BABY needs, how much the BABY needs- <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;Schooling&quot; is like feeding a baby- when the MOTHER wants to, how much the MOTHER wants<br/>
<br/>
  The difference lies in the locus of control- with unschooling, we give back our children something our society and culture  steals-  the right to govern one&#39;s self.   The right to be one&#39;s self, to know one&#39;s self.   With unschooling, we tell our children we trust them, we believe them-  <br/>
<br/>
  We believe THEY know when they are hungry and full (weather it is for food, knowledge, affection, or anything) <br/>
<br/>
  Love,<br/>
  Bronwen <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779091894">You know maybe I should have stated it that way.  Oh well such is life. I was unable to fully breastfeed my first and had to give a bottle ,my other children all nursed to when they decided to wean (so I have been on both sides of the fence)  and I have seen far to many women attacked on<br/>
this issue but it seems from the posts I am reading we attack each other on our methods of homeschooling and mothering.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I as a woman, mother and wife am sick and tired of watching and listening to women attack each other on thier choices. I am tired of the close mindness. It is one thing to debate an issue you feel strongly in but to attack is just something I can&#39;t take. I know that I personally<br/>
would rather see women unite in their differences.  We as the nurtures of society need to come together and support  each other even if we don&#39;t agree. It doesnt mean life is all roses and peaches. But what I am seeing and feeling just doesnt work for a women who belives strongly in heart of<br/>
peace and unity in differences.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for allowing me to be part of this list but logging on to find email after email with people expressing hurt feelings and then seeing more unsupportive comments leads me to belive this is not the list for me. I will now unsubscribe.<br/>

If you ever have the time, you might want to go back into these archives and you&#39;ll see for yourself that a few of us have tried over the last month or so to keep this list interesting yet not in attack mode. It worked for awhile but alas, some of the old list members have decided things need &#39;livening up&#39; here. (we lack substance!)<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt; I hope you will come back again or maybe change your mind and stick around... this will all blow over soon if we ignore the ugliness and not respond to it. (as I have been doing :(<br/>

<br/>
Q: What is unschooling? <br/>
A: When the writer John Holt first used the word unschooling over twenty <br/>
years ago, he was simply using it as a synonym for what we now call <br/>
homeschooling -- that is, children learning at home rather than in <br/>
school. Back in those early days, there was no one word to describe the <br/>
phenomenon of children learning at home, and people spoke about it with a <br/>
variety of words and phrases.<br/>
<br/>
Over time, the word unschooling has come to be associated with the <br/>
approach to homeschooling that John Holt wrote about: homeschooling <br/>
without following a packaged curriculum, homeschooling that follows the <br/>
child&#39;s interests, homeschooling with an emphasis on real-life activities <br/>
rather than worksheets, homeschooling in a way that doesn&#39;t make rigid <br/>
distinctions between schoolwork and the rest of life.<br/>
<br/>
At Growing Without Schooling magazine, we don&#39;t see unschooling as a <br/>
rigidly defined concept or approach. It&#39;s certainly not something you <br/>
have to think of as a package. Our advice to anyone reading these <br/>
questions is that you don&#39;t have to think in terms of &quot;being unschoolers&quot; <br/>
or &quot;doing unschooling.&quot; If any of the approaches described here appeal to <br/>
you, then by all means take the time to find out more, and adapt what you <br/>
read about so that it fits your family. <br/>

require anything of your children, then you are not unschooling, <br/>
including chores.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose the burden of proof is to show where Holt suggested that people <br/>
should not require kids to do chores. Holt was never a parent, and <br/>
therefore this whole issue becomes quite a task to discuss.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes Elissa! that was one of them.. and correct me if I&#39;m wrong, Helen <br/>
also wrote her thoughts about what we require of our children. Which then <br/>
brought up the subject of chores, foods etc. This whole subject became a <br/>
wonderful work in progess as the ideas run rampart.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all thinking out loud about how we feel, some are putting them to <br/>
print for the first time and therefore solidifying their thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
/highlight: Are we going to all agree that acadamia agenda falls under <br/>
unschooling? The agenda should be led by the child, and nobody else.  <br/>
/end highlight<br/>
<br/>
And what of anything beyond that? And what of chores, of food choices, of <br/>
vaccinations/anti-biotics, of TV, of sleeping arrangements? Are these <br/>
crossing lines?<br/>
<br/>
Outside the realm of acadamia, becomes hazy.. and anyone that mentions <br/>
one things.. such as chores.. then another can expound upon that into <br/>
something else.. such as food choices.. which another can expound into <br/>
vaccinations.. You see how this can unraval into an ongoing saga?<br/>
<br/>
There is enough research and proof on how bad vaccinations are for <br/>
children. The integrity of the components of the vaccinations themselves <br/>
(like thirmasol, formaldehyde etc). Can we say that the only person <br/>
requiring them is the parent? The child doesn&#39;t request this. And it <br/>
certainly isn&#39;t on their agenda. Their agenda is to be close to their <br/>
mother, breastfeed, sleep near their mother until they start branching <br/>
off into coming into themselves. Their agenda widens and <br/>
unschooling/unparenting parents follow along in support of their agendas.<br/>
<br/>
Let me go out on a limb here and tell you more about how my son&#39;s body <br/>
decides what is best for him in the medical realm BEFORE a remedy is even <br/>
ingested. If his body agrees, then we use it. If not, we don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I do not make these choices. His body does. We use &#39;Functional Medicine&#39; <br/>
by Helmut Schimmel. Here is a snippet to give you an idea:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oirf.com/refmat/funcmed.html">http://www.oirf.com/refmat/funcmed.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is Functional Medicine? Functional medicine is best explained by <br/>
contrasting it with conventional, clinical medicine. Conventional <br/>
medicine is preoccupied primarily with the morphologic changes in the <br/>
organs and tissues. These changes are assessed with appropriate <br/>
methodology leading to the diagnostic determination.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In contrast, Functional Medicine endeavors to detect and recognize <br/>
energetic and regulatory disturbances that in medical terminology can <br/>
justly be labeled functional. Functional disturbances occur when a living <br/>
organism can no longer adequately compensate in response to irritants. A <br/>
functional, regulatory disturbance takes place. Functional disorders can <br/>
be detected early, from the very beginning of the pathological  <br/>
processes. Such disturbances can also be evaluated later on, when the <br/>
morphological changes also manifest the disease as well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oirf.com/vega/vega.html">http://www.oirf.com/vega/vega.html</a><br/>
<br/>
In 1978, Dr. Helmut Schimmel of West Germany originated the third major <br/>
system that was called the &quot;VEGATEST-Method&quot; or VRT (Vegetative Reflex <br/>
Test). Dr. Schimmel (widely known as the formulator of the &#39;Pascoe Nosode <br/>
Complexes&#39;) after working eight years within the limitations of BFD had <br/>
the ideal combination of qualifications for this task, being both a <br/>
medical and dental physician, as well as a true clinician-researcher. As <br/>
you know, BFD arose out of dissatisfaction with EAV, and so one could say <br/>
that the VEGATEST-Method is the culmination of some thirty years of <br/>
German Electro-Acupuncture development. Besides Germany itself, the <br/>
VEGATEST-Method has already caught on like wildfire in England and <br/>
Australia, and is now well established right here in North America.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;By placing samples of various substances a practitioner works with, <br/>
one-by-one into a special holder [honeycomb] connected to the diagnostic <br/>
instrument, the practitioner can evaluate which of the remedies will be <br/>
most effective for the patient - before their administration, and before <br/>
the patient leaves the office. Singularly or in combination, medications <br/>
can be tested not only for effectiveness, but also for tolerance, to <br/>
eliminate adverse side effects. This is termed medication testing. The <br/>
ability to test the biocompatibility of remedies prior to taking them, <br/>
plus its potential in food and allergy testing is, as one can well <br/>
imagine, what has primarily stirred up so much interest in German <br/>
Electro-Acupuncture techniques.&quot;<br/>

not differentiate learning in life from learning in general (please forgive the wording,<br/>
but I hope you know what I mean). We say that we want our children to learn in a natural<br/>
setting and environment -- learning as part of life.  BUT if we also say that part of<br/>
unschooling is that we DO NOT require our children to do anything academic unless they<br/>
want to (thus child centered learning), BUT we also say that in non-academic realms<br/>
requirement is okay (i.e. chores, food, medical care), are the then not separating life<br/>
and learning?<br/>

And is the purpose of lessons to progress or have a positive experience with<br/>
an instrument?<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if a child is skipping lessons a lot but still doesn&#39;t want to quit<br/>
you could set up a deal where you drop in for lessons when he feels like he<br/>
needs one and whenever the teacher has some free time.<br/>

In my home, it isn&#39;t separated, requirements are requirements, and they<br/>
don&#39;t have place in our lives. This is not something we have done always,<br/>

I think every experience is a valuable learning opportunity. So when Conor <br/>
wanted to take piano, I found a means for him to do so. When he started to <br/>
tire of it, I let him drop it. I didn&#39;t consider the money wasted. He got <br/>
out of the classes what he needed/wanted at the time and decided to move on. <br/>
I never really thought about in terms of piano lessons = he will absolutely <br/>
learn to play the piano. I viewed it more as an exploration. And since I <br/>
didn&#39;t sour the experience for him, I quite often find him at the keyboards <br/>
playing around with music.<br/>

IT is a learning experience ... the person can&#39;t possibly know if they are going to enjoy something until they&#39;ve tried it...I do not think they should be punished (coerced into going when they no longer want to) after deciding something is not for them.  What do you mean by *obligation?*  Perhaps the person didn&#39;t really want *lessons* and just wanted to have an instrument, be with others, who knows?  Now the lessons are no longer meeting the need.  Talk to the person and find out what they want to do or not do...<br/>

  How far do we push not requiring before we consider ourselves unschoolers? It is a much<br/>
  easier issue for parents of wee ones than it is for those of us who have older children.<br/>
  For example, if an older child decided to take music lessons, which we pay for.  What if<br/>
  this child does not want to go consistently? Do we let them skip lessons or do we<br/>
  &quot;require&quot; that they meet this obligation of theirs?<br/>

&gt;I think every experience is a valuable learning opportunity. So when Conor<br/>
&gt;wanted to take piano, I found a means for him to do so. When he started to<br/>
&gt;tire of it, I let him drop it. I didn&#39;t consider the money wasted. He got<br/>
&gt;out of the classes what he needed/wanted at the time and decided to move on.<br/>
&gt;I never really thought about in terms of piano lessons = he will absolutely<br/>
&gt;learn to play the piano. I viewed it more as an exploration. And since I<br/>
&gt;didn&#39;t sour the experience for him, I quite often find him at the keyboards<br/>
&gt;playing around with music.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the question was more about the child missing lessons rather than <br/>
about quitting.  I certainly understand not wanting to pay for something <br/>
that isn&#39;t being utilized, like the lessons.  I think I might talk with the <br/>
teacher about ways the lessons could change to accomodate the child&#39;s <br/>
learning style, which *might* make the lessons more fun.  If that didn&#39;t <br/>
help, I might try the &quot;drop-in&quot; idea.  Or I might want the child to make <br/>
some contribution to the lessons, so that missed lessons will be costing <br/>
the child as well as me.  Of course if the child wanted to quit the <br/>
lessons, I&#39;d go along with that.<br/>

I believe you said &quot;if you require X&quot; (X = anything) that we&#39;re not<br/>
unschooling. You did not specify what &quot;X&quot; was, the assumption would be that<br/>
you were speaking of the chores required. In addition to that there was the<br/>
situation of different people applying different definitions to the same<br/>
word (i.e. &quot;require&quot;, unschooling and so on). It just became a little<br/>
bickerfest over semantics and some new people to the list just want to do<br/>
is leave because it&#39;s a waste of time and energy.<br/>

requirements,<br/>
&gt; specifially journal writing being required. I never went on to say that<br/>
&gt; people who require chores are not unschooling. (If I am remembering<br/>

Okay, as the reigning Queen of Emoticonia ;-) I would have to agree with <br/>
this sentiment wholeheartedly. :-) I would also add the suggestion of trying <br/>
to respond to ideas rather than specific posters. :-o It&#39;s hard not to take <br/>
something personally when your name is right there. :-P Just a thought. :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It takes a truly enlightened person to not get offended from what I&#39;ve<br/>
seen posted here at times.  The &quot;but you&#39;re not an unschooler because you <br/>
_fill_in_the_blank_&quot; posts are hard to shrug off - I know I&#39;ve been<br/>
there since I &lt;gasp!&gt; use a charter school.  Sometimes I can walk away<br/>
and other times I can&#39;t.  One day early in my homeschooling days I was<br/>
called a homeschooling wannabe by someone listed as a resource for <br/>
homeschooling young children - I don&#39;t want to be around that woman <br/>
to this day 4 years later.  If she hadn&#39;t volunteered to be a resource <br/>
it would have been rude - but to volunteer for a group as a resource for <br/>
younger children and then to be that way is inexcusably rude!  (From my <br/>
early days on-line - back before the WWW stuff - wannabe was a very <br/>
derogatory term.)  What you write and what you say make lasting impressions.  <br/>
<br/>
I think the best we can hope for is a reasoned, considered response when <br/>
someone gets offended.<br/>
