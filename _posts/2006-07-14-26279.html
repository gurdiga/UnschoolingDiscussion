<div id="ygrps-yiv-830274348">I&#39;m trying to finalize the website and get all my ducks in a row.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still waiting on some funshop info. If we&#39;ve talked about your <br/>
hosting a funshop, now&#39;s the time to have that info to me.<br/>
<br/>
I need a title and description of your funshop, a photo and 4-5 line <br/>
bio.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>

  School&#39;s goal is to prepare them to be anything they want. But the  <br/>
process is so dullifying and kids haven&#39;t explored the possibilities  <br/>
of what they could be that many set their sites as low as possible.  <br/>
They go to college to get a job to buy stuff. ~Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
