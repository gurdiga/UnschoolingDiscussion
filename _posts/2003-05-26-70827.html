 </span></blockquote>Disclaimer:  My son sits up front because of safety issues.  He can unbuckle <br/>
his belt and unlock the door or crawl out the window too fast for me to catch <br/>
him.  He&#39;s almost seven, VERY impulsive.  That said, here&#39;s my story:<br/>
<br/>
I was driving along, using my left hand; my right hand was just resting on my <br/>
seat.  My son reached over and picked it up.  I burst into a smile, my heart <br/>
swelled.  Without a word, he gently placed my right hand on the steering <br/>
wheel.<br/>
