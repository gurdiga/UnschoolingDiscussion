<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770572655">Hey<br/>
<br/>
We went skiing yesterday. First of all, did you know, it uses ARMPIT <br/>
MUSCLES to ski? LOL As my aching body is reminding me today, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Well, my kids all fell down more than they skied, and my friend and <br/>
her husband, who met us at Jackson Hole, were intent on giving them <br/>
instructions how to stand back up on skis: Parallel feet, <br/>
perpendicular to the slope...and everyone was getting frustrated with <br/>
Robby, because he couldn&#39;t get his skis right. Kept on saying &quot;I know!<br/>
I know!&quot; and sitting there with his ski tips crossed, or his legs <br/>
splayed, skis pointing opposite directions.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when Katie plowed into me and knocked me over, I decided to <br/>
let my friends (more experienced skiers BY FAR) help my kids, and <br/>
went on a little ways to wait for my kids. By the time they caught up <br/>
with me, Katie&#39;s skis were off, and Robby was good at getting back <br/>
up, but tired of falling all the time, so he took his skis off, too. <br/>
We ended the day with my kids dinking around in the bunny hill area, <br/>
and I got a few more runs in.<br/>
<br/>
I could post my own frustrations about the ineptitude of the Jackson <br/>
employees who told me to take the kids on the slope for their very <br/>
first ski experience. But I won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, talking to my friend on the phone, I could hear her <br/>
frustration, because my kids weren&#39;t listening to her or her hubby. I <br/>
shook my head in dismal agreement. Too bad they didn&#39;t listen. It <br/>
made me feel bad that my friends were so frustrated about my kids&#39; <br/>
unteachability. EVen the ski instructor who tried to help at one <br/>
point, shook his head and skied away. <br/>
<br/>
So, I began to think of ways to help Robby, especially, see the <br/>
importance of listening when someone is trying to tell him how to do <br/>
something. I thought I&#39;d make the ski day into a lesson on Following <br/>
Instructions, so I asked him about it. first of all, I was aware that <br/>
he had finally &quot;gotten it&quot; how to stand back up, so I asked him to <br/>
demonstrate the technique.<br/>
<br/>
he showed me perfect form: parallel skis, squat, stand. So I <br/>
said &quot;That&#39;s exactly what they were telling you to do! Were you <br/>
listening to them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah, but I wanted to do it myself.&quot; hmmm. When I asked if their <br/>
instructions were helping or frustrating him, he said &quot;frustrating. I <br/>
figured it out okay.&quot; Everyone was frustrated: some, for having <br/>
instructions that they didn&#39;t think they needed, and some, for having <br/>
their instructions not followed.<br/>
<br/>
Next time, it&#39;ll be bunny hill for the first hour, to learn <br/>
snowplowing and turning...and then maybe, the slope. And let him get <br/>
his butt off the snow his own self! And maybe we can still have that <br/>
talk about letting himself receive instruction from people who know <br/>
what they&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
my main lesson: Robby will figure it out for himself, just let him.<br/>
<br/>
peace, Heidi</div>
