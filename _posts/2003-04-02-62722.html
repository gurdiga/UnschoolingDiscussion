&lt;&lt; Oh,  and Kelly,       is the conference being held at the hotel?    Just  <br/>
wondering,  or my dh was wondering.     And if the kids come with,,,would <br/>
there be things for them to do?       What do you think?    Or do they just <br/>
hang out with the adults?<br/>
 Thanks. &gt;&gt;<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
