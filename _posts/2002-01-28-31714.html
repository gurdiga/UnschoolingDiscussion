<div id="ygrps-yiv-654165715">&lt;&lt;are you feeling better, Julie?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking of you and Roy yesterday and how much fun we had meeting<br/>
you guys.  I am feeling better, changed my diet and now have so much energy,<br/>
I&#39;m on the &#39;net at midnight.  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think karate is its own reward.  You can ONLY get better at it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I feel that way about most things.  I have been studying Marxism for about 3<br/>
years off and on and now am learning economic theory to flesh out my<br/>
understanding.  My dh thinks I&#39;m nuts but I spend &quot;bathroom time&quot; reading<br/>
this stuff.  I am getting better at it, still don&#39;t know what I&#39;m supposed<br/>
to do with it, but I am better at it  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827091012">&lt;&lt;thoughts please&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you Kolleen.  Whether it is taking out the trash or turning off<br/>
the tv it is control if the parent decides.  But I think there can be some<br/>
type of middle ground.<br/>
<br/>
Example:  We have 5 kids (11, 8, 5, 3, 2).  With the kids working on their<br/>
projects, making their snacks, playing, things can get very messy very<br/>
quickly here.  I can spend all my time cleaning up but I would be a grump.<br/>
We work more on the basis of commitment to the group or family.  If what you<br/>
are doing only effects you, fine no problem.  If it effects others, then<br/>
agreements need to be made.  Adriane has a room to herself so she cleans up<br/>
as she sees fit.  Zach and Danny share and Zach is the ultimate slob, a very<br/>
cool slob but slob none the less.  It gets to where Danny can&#39;t even find<br/>
his toys under Zach&#39;s dirty underwear.  I suggested that when we can no<br/>
longer see the floor, Zach pick up his stuff and he agreed.  Zach and Marsie<br/>
love &quot;midnight snacks&quot; but were leaving crumbs and dirty dishes all over the<br/>
table.  I asked them to clean up after themselves and they said fine and do<br/>
a really good job.  Use of the home and cleaning of the home often effect<br/>
more than just the individual, watching television usually doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Respect is a 2 way street and unless living alone, it is pretty much<br/>
required for a happy home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071160910">&lt;&lt;I&#39;m unschooling as best I can&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn&#39;t with what people choose to do in their homes.  They truly<br/>
should do what they feel is best for their families.  Isn&#39;t that what good<br/>
parents do?<br/>
<br/>
The problem is when people say &quot;I unschool except for this&quot; or &quot;I make the<br/>
kids turn off the tv and we unschool until 3:00&quot; and use their<br/>
exceptions-to-unschool as advice for others who come to this forum to learn<br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I was one of the people who got a whack upside the head (I thank God &lt;and<br/>
Sandra&gt; daily for it).  It wasn&#39;t ugly and it wasn&#39;t abusive.  It was<br/>
turning a very bright light on in my mind so I could see into all the little<br/>
nooks and crannies and I didn&#39;t really like what I saw there.  It was an &quot;Oh<br/>
my God&quot; moment that changed my life.  The &quot;whack&quot; was actually self-imposed,<br/>
a palm striking the middle of my forehead.<br/>
<br/>
Because when I finally got unschooling in all its glory it was truly a<br/>
defining moment in life, I feel very strongly that others have the chance to<br/>
experience that as well.<br/>
<br/>
I worked as a therapist for years.  People came to me wanting help learning<br/>
to be happy.  I was often very kind to them, but  I also shot straight from<br/>
the hip with them.  I questioned their motives, their decisions, their word<br/>
choices.  Sometimes they got very angry with me, sometimes they fell in love<br/>
with me, sometimes they got better and sometimes they didn&#39;t.  But I<br/>
couldn&#39;t have helped anyone if I was simply the hand-holder and cheerleader<br/>
on all occasions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371569119">&lt;&lt;suggestions&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What I finally noticed is that my kids are always asking to do things and I<br/>
found myself always telling them &quot;no&quot;.  They want to help paint or the<br/>
little kids want to help do the laundry or wash dishes.  Because it was<br/>
easier and faster FOR ME, I would send them on their way.  Now I work harder<br/>
to include them as much as they want to be included and they are much more<br/>
agreeable to helping out in ways that maybe aren&#39;t as much fun for them.<br/>
<br/>
My dh also is a neat nut.  I&#39;m just this side of slob and by the end of the<br/>
day the house is a wreck.  Because it pleases their father who they love<br/>
dearly, the kids are willing to help as WE ALL TOGETHER make a run through<br/>
the house and pick up.  Dad is less stressed by feeling claustrophobic and<br/>
more ready for play.  Works for us.<br/>

not I unschool Wyndham.  I have been very careful since to point out <br/>
that he has limits, the girls don&#39;t and that I think MOST kids don&#39;t <br/>
need them.  <br/>
Others have come here and are in the process of learning to let go of <br/>
this stuff and discussing limits from that standpoint.  And <br/>
discussing ways to help their children take responsibility for their <br/>
own viewing habits.  All in all I think that has been a very <br/>

discussions.  I mostly caught the tail end of things, but didnt get <br/>
involved.<br/>
The problem I have with some of the things I&#39;m hearing you say now, <br/>
is that you seem to be giving  the impression that children with any <br/>
type of &quot;disorder&quot;, might not be able to unschool.  You&#39;ve given up <br/>
on it, for one of your children, because it wasn&#39;t &quot;working&quot; for him.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem with your feelings about that.  I do have a <br/>
problem, that because of YOUR judgement about the situation, you&#39;ve <br/>
come to a conclusion, that many may not have.  You don&#39;t want to say <br/>
that unschooling didn&#39;t work for ME, because I couldn&#39;t accept the <br/>
choices this child was making, and couldn&#39;t see beyond having to now <br/>
control the situation myself.  You want to say it didn&#39;t work for <br/>
HIM.  That, to me, isn&#39;t seeing unschooling in a clear light.<br/>
I&#39;m not attacking you here.  I&#39;m discussing unschooling as I see it, <br/>
using the situation that you have brought to this list.<br/>

<br/>
But that is not what I said.  I said that the ultimate goal with <br/>
Wyndham is to help him get to the point where unschooling WILL work <br/>
for him.  But because of his problems that takes time and effort and <br/>
a different approach.<br/>
Unschooling *AS DEFINED HERE PREVIOUSLY* will not work for him.  That <br/>
is different than saying I don&#39;t think he can ever take control for <br/>
himself and unschool.  <br/>
But see the problem is that *AS DEFINE HERE PREVIOUSLY* part and the <br/>
assumption by some that besause I have said that this is what I have <br/>
to do now with him I believe he will never change or grow or become <br/>
independent enough to make his own decisions.  I should hope that if <br/>
others with children like him come to this list, they can take heart <br/>
in knowing that they are not alone and that there are ways to make <br/>
progress toward unschooling with a child like him.<br/>

That sounds like you have certain ideas about how unschooling should <br/>
look(like the way your daughters have lived.  Different from each <br/>
other, but still acceptable to you.)<br/>
To me, it seems that you have judge your child, and decided some of <br/>
his choices are wrong, and you will steer him in the &quot;right&quot; <br/>
direction.  YOUR direction.  That&#39;s fine.  You&#39;re his mom.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound like you are heading towards unschooling though.<br/>
You&#39;re trying to lead him to more independence.  That&#39;s what lots of <br/>
parents do.  They don&#39;t call that unschooling, though.  They call <br/>
that teaching.<br/>

If you are really interested you can go read in the archives what <br/>
I&#39;ve said before.  Yes, I have to set limits for him now, while he is <br/>
learning about himself.  Once he has figured out where his problems <br/>
lie, he can take control for himself.  In the meantime, if you don&#39;t <br/>
want to consider me heading toward unschooling with him because I <br/>
think he should not pick his skin open on a regular basis or that he <br/>
should not be becoming obese or that he should try to keep his gums <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741794039">Youngest kidlet has no conception of any limits.  She stays up until she<br/>
gets physically sick she is soooo tired.  We&#39;ve talked about it and seem to<br/>
reach a conclusion that she understands but it is out the window the minute<br/>
the talking is done.  Not having bedtimes set for her is physically harming.<br/>
And yes, we have tried it for more than just one night.  After a week she<br/>
looked like a 30 yo who had been on a binge (bags under her eyes, real red<br/>
eyes, saggy face, dragging all day).<br/>
<br/>
When she ended up in bed with flu like symptoms, we called a halt to her<br/>
being the one deciding bedtimes.  I&#39;ve come to recognize the signs of when<br/>
she is a step or two away from the &quot;sick&quot; stage and tell her to head for<br/>
bed.  With my comments about bedtime, she then seems to recognize it herself<br/>
and usually says, &quot;Yep, you&#39;re right&quot; and gives everyone hugs and kisses and<br/>
heads off to bed.  Once in a while she makes the choices and asks to stay up<br/>
later for whatever reason and we discuss it.  If it is simply because she<br/>
wants to see something on television, then we tape it and she watches it in<br/>
the morning.  If it is a family thing, she usually stays up a little longer.<br/>
