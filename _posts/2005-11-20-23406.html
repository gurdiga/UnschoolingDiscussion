<div id="ygrps-yiv-829907733">Hi Tracy,<br/>
<br/>
Always Learning is a great list, but geared more for those that <br/>
already live the unschooling lifestyle.  Sandra mentioned <br/>
unschoolingbasics, a list that Kelly Lovejoy and I run for newbies.  <br/>
Here&#39;s a direct link:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a place to get started, question the philosophies and hear from <br/>
both experienced unschoolers and those just learning about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend reading here and posting the &quot;getting started&quot; questions <br/>
over there. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121023400">Hi. I&#39;m Jo. I have a 13 yr old daughter and we live downunder in New <br/>
Zealand. My daughter did go to school until she was 10, but has been <br/>
out for 2.5 or so years now.<br/>
<br/>
I had always parented in a way that fits RU, thanks to attachment <br/>
parenting ideas and finding Polly Berrien Berends _Whole Child, Whole <br/>
Parent_ when my daughter was very young, so that we already had the <br/>
food/relationship/no arbitrary limits on tv, computer etc, side of <br/>
things sorted. Deschooling still took a little while for her, but she <br/>
got there and we are very happy for it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been dipping randomly into the archives the last couple of days, <br/>
and am really enjoying the feeling of this group.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freewebs.com/having-a-cow/">http://www.freewebs.com/having-a-cow/</a> which might <br/>
look to have something of a split personality seeing as I use it <br/>
partly to remind me of things the governmental body which oversees <br/>
Home Educators in NZ might find to their taste. <br/>
<br/>
Jo R, who, upon skimming my site&#39;s writings for questionable things <br/>
just now, remembered that I&#39;ve been meaning to go and eliminate the <br/>
word screentime from the misc. musings page</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195706246">Hi back atcha, Cally!<br/>
<br/>
You know, I&#39;ve been having a really good feeling of deep contentment <br/>
around my/our unschooling experience lately, though I have been <br/>
checking round the edges of that for any complacency or whiff of <br/>
stale, just in case. : )<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that unsubbing from all the local Home Ed lists was <br/>
helpful, despite the couple of strong voices (including yours, Cally) <br/>
for RU that I will miss, there really wasn&#39;t much there of value to <br/>
me nor much opportunity, I felt, for me to give in a meaningful way. <br/>

and have got me thinking, checking in with myself about many things.<br/>
