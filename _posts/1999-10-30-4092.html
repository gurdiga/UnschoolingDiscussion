<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;     Thankyou so much. I have to tell you that just being on this list<br/>
&gt; has<br/>
&gt; helped so much. I would have never even thought to question any of<br/>
&gt; this.<br/>
&gt;     I&#39;ve talked twice with this particular woman and she seems very<br/>
&gt; knowledgeable but she requires an assessment of the child (she does<br/>
&gt; this,<br/>
&gt; talks to them, etc.)<br/>
&gt; that takes about 45 min and will cost me $40. She would also like paid<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; upfront for the whole month, because according to her, her ADD may<br/>
&gt; allow her<br/>
&gt; to forget. After thinking about it a bit I thought, what if we don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt; her?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My younger daughter, an extremely gifted pianist (now 9 -- and she plays<br/>
Mozart, Bach, and Gershwin fluently and can sightread anything!), would<br/>
probably be diagnosed as ADHD if she were ever in school.  She is<br/>
absolutely always in motion, almost never opens a book, is terrific at<br/>
math provided she doesn&#39;t have to spend more than 15 minutes at it at a<br/>
time.  Put her at the piano and she sits still (other than the hands!)<br/>
for an hour!  Put her in the gym and she never gets distracted.  In my<br/>
experience, ADD (if it really exists at all), is highly environmentally<br/>
and situationally specific  -- if it were me, I wouldn&#39;t assume that<br/>
your child&#39;s ADD will have any effect at all on ability to learn music<br/>
well  -- and I might (without knowing him/her) suggest that looking for<br/>
approaches to cope with her/his weaknesses rather than maximize his/her<br/>
strengths (the urge to learn music) might not be the wisest way to go.<br/>
<br/>
There are teachers who charge by the month rather than the lesson<br/>
because they are booked up and don&#39;t have flexible schedules, and can&#39;t<br/>
deal with rescheduling cancelled lessons (or afford to lose the<br/>
income.)  This is not necessarily unreasonable in and of itself, though<br/>
if it were me, I&#39;d insist on several trial lessons (for which you pay,<br/>
of course), before going on to a monthly system.<br/>
