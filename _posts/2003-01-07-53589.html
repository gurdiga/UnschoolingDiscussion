We&#39;re father apart, hmmmm.  I wonder who moved.  Did the other person move,<br/>
or did I?  <br/>

Nobody can really answer that but you, Tia, but I can say from my own<br/>
experience that I&#39;m often the one who&#39;s moved.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When we got farther apart it was both of us, me in reaction to him.  This<br/>
time I think maybe it&#39;s the other way.  I&#39;ve moved in a little closer in<br/>
ways that he can handle.  That lets him move in a little closer too.  And .<br/>
. . I think he&#39;s getting easier with all the changes he&#39;s been going<br/>
through, easier with being &quot;different&quot;.<br/>
