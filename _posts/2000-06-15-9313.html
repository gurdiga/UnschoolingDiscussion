Subject: Backyard Scientist<br/>
<br/>
I received this from a friend of mine and wanted to pass it on. I am <br/>
sending this to multiple lists and apologize if anyone receives more <br/>
than once.  I also apologize if this has already been around the <br/>
lists and I&#39;ve missed it due to the fact I&#39;m only two weeks behind in <br/>
reading emails.  I confess I am not aware of all the facts <br/>
surrounding this issue, but am willing to help out a fellow <br/>
homeschooler whose books have been of great value to me.  TYIA for <br/>
your help to Mrs. Hoffman.<br/>

**************************<br/>
You may be aware of the books and products written by Jane Hoffman, <br/>
called Backyard Scientist.  I received a call from Mrs. Hoffman this <br/>
morning that asked that we spread the following news as fast as <br/>
possible.  In January a large publishing company took the logo for <br/>
her books and products.  It is a case of a large company against one <br/>
individual.  She is asking that we as home schoolers pass the word <br/>
that she needs us to e-mail, or fax letters to her to take to a <br/>
meeting that will be held on June 19th (Next Monday!)  It is <br/>
extremely important that these faxes and letters reach her by Monday <br/>
June 19th so that she can show support for her materials.<br/>
She asked that we be honest.  If we have used the products, liked the <br/>
products, and equate the product name with the author&#39;s name please <br/>
write!  Explain how your family liked or used her books, if you <br/>
continue to use them, and if another product by the same name would <br/>
confuse your choice of science materials.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples you can use in writing your letter are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
I associate the name Backyard Scientist in any product or <br/>
advertisement with Mrs. Jane Hoffman and the quality books and <br/>
products that she has produced in the 10 or more years that she has <br/>
offered her books for sale.  Any other books or products allowed to <br/>
use this name would create confusion as well as become very damaging <br/>
to Mrs. Hoffman.<br/>
<br/>
I respect the hours and hard work Jane Hoffman put into her logo and <br/>
her products.  The use of the logo Backyard Scientist by any other <br/>
company or individual would definitely be very confusing to me as <br/>
well as damaging to the original author of  the Backyard Scientist <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
I have used the books, Backyard Scientist, with my children since we <br/>
began homeschooling in 19__.  I have equated this name with a high <br/>
quality material that is easy to use in the education of our children <br/>
in the area of science.  Mrs. Hoffman&#39;s books have provided many <br/>
hours of enjoyment for our family.  To allow another company to come <br/>
in and blatantly use the name Backyard Scientist would be a violation <br/>
of the time Mrs. Hoffman and her family spent developing these books <br/>
for use by families who wish to turn their children onto science.  It <br/>
would confuse many families who are looking for these particular <br/>
books and products as in the home school market, advertising often <br/>
spreads by word of mouth. <br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Hoffman&#39;s e-mail address is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:backyrdsci@...">backyrdsci@...</a><br/>
You can also fax your letters to (949) 552-5351<br/>
Please write as soon as possible to show your support for Jane <br/>
Hoffman and her Backyard Scientist series. Also, please pass this <br/>
onto any other home schoolers that you know.  <br/>
Thanks and God Bless.<br/>
