<div id="ygrps-yiv-409774358"><p><font color="palevioletred" face="Comic Sans MS">Hello!</font></p>
<p><font color="#db7093" face="Comic Sans MS">My family is currently researching the un-schooling approach (and we are pleased so far) and I wanted to come out of lurkdom and ask if their was anyone by chance on this list that is a part-time aerobics instructor and homeschools as well???&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&#39;m finding that this is one thing that I cannot do with my children (13 &amp; 7) there, even though it is an hour a day, twice a week that I teach, I find it hard to have the time to prepare for my classes.&nbsp; I&#39;m beginning to think that I cannot have my own interests out of the house and homeschool at the same time.....anyone been through something similar?&nbsp; I must make my priorities straight, I know....</font></p><br><br><b>Udderly,
