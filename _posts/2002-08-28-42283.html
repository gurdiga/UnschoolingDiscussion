<div id="ygrps-yiv-573718559">**She&#39;s always loved Shakespeare - she spent her own money at a garage<br/>
sale to buy a full set of little volumes of all of Shakespeare&#39;s works.<br/>
They were <br/>
selling them for $50, but she misread it as $5. When they seller saw the <br/>
heartbroken look on her face, he sold them to her for the $5 and loaded<br/>
them <br/>
into our car and could not stop grinning at her - as they chatted about <br/>
various plays. Called his wife out of the house to meet her.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if anyone in your family has ever read a book by Pamela Dean<br/>
titled something like Juniper, Gentian and Rosemary?  It&#39;s about a<br/>
family, with three girls, that read Shakespeare together.  And the girls<br/>
attend an alternative school that allows them to cut class a lot. <br/>
Pretty cool.<br/>

EVERYTHING by Pamela Dean is beyond wonderful. Juniper, <br/>
Gentian and Rosemary. Her Secret Country Trilogy (The Secret <br/>
Country, The Hidden Land, The Whim of the Dragon). Dubious <br/>
Hills. Tam Lin. My only complaint is that she is not prolific.<br/>
<br/>
She really has unschoolish children down, though she doesn&#39;t <br/>
realize it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

What better fantasy for children, and maybe adults, than being unschooled?<br/>
<br/>
Although Tam Lin was so seductive it almost made me want to go back to<br/>
college (... and major in something more fun).<br/>
