<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165861497">&lt;&lt;My oldest being born on the even month gets to have control of the TV remote and control of the nintendo on even days..&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been doing this for years with our two daughters in the car. (Not by birthdays, since they&#39;re both born in an even month.)  If it&#39;s the second of the month, the youngest daughter gets the front seat.  If it&#39;s the third, the oldest daughters gets it. It worked beautifully and is even used now--youngest is 17 and oldest is 20!<br/>
