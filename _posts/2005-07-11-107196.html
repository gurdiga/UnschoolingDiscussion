<div id="ygrps-yiv-591572748">I&#39;m posting this publicly in case anyone else is interested in the <br/>
answer ... Sandra, I&#39;ve wondered if you&#39;ve ever considered writing a <br/>
book, or have in fact already written one?<br/>
<br/>
I know I would love to read something that chronicles your families <br/>
journey through unschooling, filled with anecdotes, early experiences, <br/>
etc. I&#39;m also one of those people who prefers a paperback to a <br/>
computer screen! :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wondering if anything like that may ever be in the works. <br/>
Thanks for all you do!<br/>

Procrastinate for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the encouragement.   <br/>
<br/>
I like the essays better than the play by play, but every essay has at least <br/>
one story about what my kids are doing, and often two or three stories.<br/>
<br/>
I have a plan, but I&#39;m a perfectionist procrastinator.   Sorry about that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183396067">How about �The Collected Essays of Sandra Dodd�?  Never mind the play by<br/>
play.  Not that it wouldn�t be valuable or desirable, but something would be<br/>

<br/>
Also, there is something really beautiful here you have not realized <br/>
here, but you have the ears of thousands ... have you ever considered <br/>
self-publishing. Some of the most successful books out there were <br/>
self-published and when the demand grew over a certain threshold (let&#39;s <br/>
say, 100, 000) then came in the big publisher to feed off the frenzy. I <br/>
am sure there is more than one graphic designer here in the list and I <br/>
am an online pusblishing consultant. We can help you do this one by <br/>
yourself. Just as an experiment. And see what happens. Barnes and <br/>
Noble, actually, had a service like that --I&#39;ll check for you or just <br/>
go over to their site.<br/>

but it is ALL about unschooling. Meaning it&#39;s not a title for a target <br/>
audience. It&#39;s a title that speaks wisdom and opens up to more than <br/>
people who want to read a &quot;how-to&quot; unschool book.<br/>

I was thinking the same thing. I&#39;m also one of those people who&#39;d rather sit in bed or on the couch with a book rather than reading at the computer, so selfishly I&#39;ve always wished all Sandra&#39;s essays were in book form. I *could* print them off as I come across them, but I&#39;m lazy that way and would rather have someone else put them in book form for me &lt;bwg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Conferences would be a great place to sell many copies. But I think word of mouth would go a long way as well.<br/>
&quot;Moving a Puddle&quot; -- great title!<br/>

<br/>
&quot;... for the previously published essays, I was thinking Moving a <br/>

<br/>
---That sounds like a great title!--- <br/>

<br/>
<br/>

didn&#39;t like the idea of a collection of essays, and essays are what <br/>

<br/>
---Phew, another perfect reason to procrastinate! It sounded like <br/>
you were getting a little too close to actually doing it Sandra! I <br/>
mean, having a title in mind, a publisher, and the intention to even <br/>
do it.  (I hope you&#39;re not offended by my comments. I mean it in <br/>
good humor, and only because I have done similar things.) <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I really like &quot;Moving a Puddle.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
---So do I. So will soooo many others, if you will share it with <br/>
them. You have so much IMPORTANT information and insight to share, <br/>
and you have been generous with many of us in the unschooling <br/>
community. But I&#39;m sure you must have considered how many more <br/>
people you could reach with a book. I know you want kids to have <br/>
better lives, to be treated with the dignity and respect they <br/>
deserve. Your book on the shelves of Barnes & Noble could make that <br/>
happen. Your words show some people the possibilities that they do <br/>
not even know exist, and how rewarding it can be to explore all <br/>
those possibilities rather than just following the mainstream. I <br/>
also wanted to remind you how &quot;pushy&quot; you&#39;ve been accused of being <br/>
in your attempts to get people to see how they need to stop ruining <br/>
their kids&#39; lives, and their relationships with their kids. You <br/>
emphasize that you want people to &quot;get it&quot; ASAP, before it&#39;s too <br/>
late for the kid. Well, can you use that same desire to help kids <br/>
you don&#39;t know, NOW, before it&#39;s too late for them? Will you share <br/>
yourself with a more general audience through a book to do it? Even <br/>
if your FIRST book was a collection of prior essays, and nothing <br/>
else new, it would be a goldmine to many of us already unschooling, <br/>
but it could be even more to someone who hasn&#39;t even considered it <br/>
yet.---<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I write essays and I move puddles.&quot;<br/>
 Sandra<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---You do so much more than that and I, for one, love reading all <br/>
about it. Some of it I read several times to let it really sink in, <br/>
or because there&#39;s so much to absorb I can&#39;t catch it all in one <br/>
reading, and sometimes it&#39;s just for fun! Anyway, a book would save <br/>
me some on computer paper, ink, and allow others in my family more <br/>
computer time.&lt;g&gt; We&#39;re still managing with one computer in a family <br/>
of 5, believe it or not. Well, when I come up with more reasons you <br/>
should do the book NOW, I&#39;ll post them (if I don&#39;t get kicked off <br/>
this list).---<br/>

<br/>
Hard as it is to publish something someone already has written, it&#39;s even <br/>
harder to put the brakes on one&#39;s life and change directions with all the <br/>
relatives squawking &quot;What are you doing?   You get right back here, missy, and do <br/>
what WE did, right now.   Who do you think you are?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no getting around the unschooling subplot of everything I write, and <br/>
so those who want reasons to procrastinate about changing their lives, or who <br/>
want further justification to go to their unhappy graves with lives unchanged <br/>
will see that and slam it shut.   (If they even ever saw that.)<br/>
<br/>
I used to want to stall until I had a teen, because I&#39;d gotten criticism in <br/>
years past (not criticism, dismissal) for my oldest &quot;only being... (9, 10, <br/>
11...)    Then when the kids were teens they weren&#39;t doing anything earthforming, <br/>
so it seemed I should wait until I had one grown.   But what if he grows up to <br/>
kill the president?   A book by me would be bad for unschooling.   When I <br/>
figured out they weren&#39;t even likely to kill the mayor, I was irritated with a <br/>
local reporter who assured me she was TOO sending a photographer to spend the <br/>
day with us, on one of the worst weeks for a year, as though I had no right to <br/>
say no (or as though she had the city&#39;s attention and it would be unwise for me <br/>
to refuse her).    I had never before felt the nasty side of public exposure <br/>
as I did that week, and the disdain she seemed to have for me for being a mom <br/>
at home, as when she disregarded my list of where my   kids actually WERE <br/>
going to be that week ( two different gaming shops, a public park), actually doing <br/>
cool things, and insisted it was to be at our house (to which I said no, it <br/>
absolutely   is not).<br/>
<br/>
So the article came out, I was quoted most but other moms were photographed <br/>
reading to kids and having them sitting in front of textbooks with pencils <br/>
touching notebooks.    And the editor of the supplement quoted me too, and <br/>
paraphrased me, and generally acted like my ideas were her ideas &lt;g&gt;, and that was <br/>
fine.    <br/>
<br/>
And then I thought that if I wrote a book that flopped, that would be <br/>
embarrassing.   I don&#39;t want to be on remainder tables or dumpsters.   And if I wrote <br/>
a book that satisfied a publisher and was not a flop, I would be getting <br/>
calls from pusher people than a local newspaper supplement, and people would spy <br/>
on my kids and &quot;test them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And for a procrastinator and perfectionist, that was overwhelming reason.<br/>
<br/>
But now there&#39;s all this self-publishing stuff, with computer/copier/binder <br/>
combos that can make a single book   And that makes things different.   And <br/>
there are more unschoolers than their used to be, and some want to have something <br/>
they can give a sister in law or neighbor, and ALL my kids are teens now, and <br/>
even the youngest of them would have something to say to someone who caughter <br/>
her in an unexpected light.<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s a series of thought processes laid out for those who wonder what <br/>
the heck is my problem.<br/>

LOL! I don&#39;t post alot, but have read every day for more than a year. Like one of my dear friends once told me, it&#39;s not about YOU, it&#39;s about the INFORMATION. The information that you- and many others- share is very important and should not be undervalued. Don&#39;t let fear get in the way of having this life changing information out there in paperback form. It is almost like it&#39;s your responsibility, now that you have all of this experience and information, to share it with others in ways that you can. (okay, that&#39;s a little guilt inducing there, hehe..)<br/>

Follow your heart!!<br/>

Yes! Think of the income and experience you could gain from a book and maybe doing some workshops around the country. You could bring your kids along and have a grand adventure!

<div id="ygrps-yiv-872813261"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I used to want to stall until I had a teen, because I&#39;d gotten <br/>
&gt; criticism in<br/>
&gt; years past (not criticism, dismissal) for my oldest &quot;only being... (9, <br/>
&gt; 10,<br/>
&gt; 11...)    Then when the kids were teens they weren&#39;t doing anything <br/>
&gt; earthforming,<br/>
&gt; so it seemed I should wait until I had one grown.   But what if he <br/>
&gt; grows up to<br/>
&gt; kill the president?   A book by me would be bad for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes, I can relate to this - quite a few people here have also said I <br/>
should write a book because they would like to see something written by <br/>
a New Zealander - virtually all of the books out there about <br/>
homeschooling of any kind are american with a few british ones thrown <br/>
in. I have always worried about all the &#39;what ifs&#39;, and as well about <br/>
how the kids would feel about it. Even when I have written in our local <br/>
newsletter, I have sometimes felt that the kids felt pressure. So when <br/>
do I write the book that it won&#39;t either refect badly on unschooling <br/>
(especially to people that aren&#39;t &#39;there&#39; yet), or be embarrassing to my <br/>
boys!.......<br/>
<br/>
Yes! My 17yo (who has never been able to learn to write and spell to <br/>
school standards) went out and got himself a job!<br/>
No! he moved out of home in anger!<br/>
Oh my gosh, at 19 he&#39;s getting married to a 16yo.<br/>
Oh my gosh and more! He&#39;s become a father at 20yo.<br/>
No! His wife has left him.<br/>
Yes! They are back together and working things out.<br/>
Yes! He has a new, and very good job and they are moving a long way away <br/>
to become independent, away from the pressures of particular friends and <br/>
family.<br/>
No! She&#39;s left him again.<br/>
Yes, they are back together again......<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the second son (anger management problems etc etc).....<br/>
And the third (depression etc etc)......<br/>
And the fourth....<br/>
<br/>
I doubt I will ever do it - but on the other hand, I am neither as <br/>
erudite nor as well known nor as insightful as you, Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And then I thought that if I wrote a book that flopped, that would be<br/>
&gt; embarrassing.   I don&#39;t want to be on remainder tables or dumpsters.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&#39;The Book of My Enemy has Been Remaindered&#39; by Clive James<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ug.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/poetry/bookofmyenemy.html">http://ug.cs.dal.ca/~johnston/poetry/bookofmyenemy.html</a><br/>
enjoy<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;    And if I wrote<br/>
&gt; a book that satisfied a publisher and was not a flop, I would be getting<br/>
&gt; calls from pusher people than a local newspaper supplement, and people <br/>
&gt; would spy<br/>
&gt; on my kids and &quot;test them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that is scary. But you know what? I&#39;ve had my kids say, well, so <br/>
what? we don&#39;t care about people like that. They are so secure in their <br/>
own selves after being raised in a way less unschooling way than yours, <br/>
Sandra. I think you should talk to your kids about your fears, and you <br/>
may find that they aren&#39;t bothered. My #2 son (21) was just talking <br/>
yesterday about how the people he works with are &#39;not dumb, they have <br/>
just never had the chance to learn how to think for themselves&#39; and  it <br/>
seems that rather than feel put down by them, he feels sorry for them <br/>
for being so stuck in a thoughtless world! Despite all the mistakes I <br/>
have made with my kids, they are really cool people: it&#39;s my own <br/>
insecurities that are the real barrier - it&#39;s just easier to use the <br/>
excuse of the effect on them! What a wonderful person I am to put my <br/>
aspirations to become a world famous author and education guru to one <br/>
side for the sake of my beloved fragile babies.  That sounds so much <br/>
better than, &#39;I&#39;m scared! whinge, whine...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
But you know what, Sandra? If you had come before me timewise, and had <br/>
written an unschooling book that I had read before I started on this <br/>
path, then my life and the life of all four of my children - but <br/>
especially my eldest son - would have been even better. It&#39;s not your <br/>
job, or mine, to raise the world&#39;s children, but IF you have the time, <br/>
IF you have the energy, then talk to your family, let them choose if the <br/>
risks to them are too great, and then if they agree, go for it because <br/>
what you have to offer, is so very much needed in this world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448021101">Being a rather abrasive, hotheaded, foot-in-mouth<br/>
person, I am requesting input from saner heads before<br/>
I alienate yet another &#39;regular&#39; kid/parent.<br/>
<br/>
Ellis has a friend who lives down the street.  The<br/>
short version of the story is that her mother works in<br/>
the same department as me, is getting divorced, really<br/>
REALLY likes my husband and enjoys using him/us as a<br/>
way to entertain her daughter (and frequently her dog,<br/>
too).<br/>
<br/>
All that aside, her daughter is a lot more ...<br/>
unfocused than Ellis, rarely spending more than 2<br/>
minutes on any topic or activity.  One day, 6 year-old<br/>
Ellis told his daddy &quot;I like Zoe but sometimes she&#39;s<br/>
(pause) difficult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
On a recent visit/dumping of the kid, the plan turned<br/>
into a trip to the park across the street.  Ellis was<br/>
chatting about various things when suddenly Zoe&#39;s mom<br/>
snapped her fingers at him and barked, &quot;Shoes!  Get<br/>
your shoes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I was in shock because I might have<br/>
otherwise thrown her out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
Zoe is probably going to be here again this afternoon.<br/>
 I ask you - how would you handle this or a similar<br/>
situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your brains!<br/>

are part of LIFE as human beings. With the one HUGE difference that their <br/>
mom trusts in, believes in, and totally supports them and their choices in <br/>
life and allows them to have fun and be happy, unconditionally. This is the <br/>

I&#39;m glad you&#39;re writing everyday on the lists and message board.  You<br/>
once said you thought the lists were important places for information<br/>
exchange and if you were busy writing a book you wouldn&#39;t have the time<br/>
to write to the lists.  I&#39;m sure there are a lot of people who found just<br/>
the inspiration/help they needed because of your writing on these forums.<br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
***and some want to have something they can give a sister in law***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s me.   All the other things I&#39;ve been thinking I&#39;d like to give her<br/>
would get me arrested. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re a writer, you&#39;ll write a book, or ten.   And I&#39;m no Baptist but<br/>
I&#39;d appreciate it if you could get around to it before I go to jail. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I think I like online lists and forums better than books.  (maybe because I don&#39;t have to share my computer with anyone)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to be a huge book lover, but now books seem so cluttery and outdated <br/>
sometimes compared to the newest news.   And especially, I think, because I&#39;ve <br/>
always loved and hoarded non-fiction.   Almanacs are no good now except for <br/>
bathroom reading and maps and trivia.   If I want information, google&#39;s better.  <br/>
  I used to buy video guides (really heavy books to look up cast and all)   <br/>
but IMBD is WORLDS better, has photos and links and cross references and <br/>
obscure credits.    Folk music, I have a GREAT collection of books, but new versions <br/>
have been found of lots of things, and online you can get to recordings or at <br/>
least midis of tunes, and cross references.   <br/>
<br/>
And some of the essays I&#39;ve written and put on line will be no uglier in book <br/>
form, but like this one:<br/>

in black on white, it&#39;s going to lose a lot.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
YES I KNOW, I&#39;m procrastinating and whining.   <br/>
<br/>
I also knew after Pam showed me lulu.com that I would need a scanner and a <br/>
better computer, a Mac that could get on the wireless network so I could upload <br/>
a lengthy Word file, because my old Mac was on dialup.    And so here I am <br/>
with a new computer and the $50-after-rebate scanner that I got with it.   <br/>
<br/>
Progress.<br/>

Since you are publishing this book yourself, why can&#39;t you make the pages as<br/>
fancy as you want?  Besides, that is one of the things that would make this<br/>
book stand out from others.  doncha think?<br/>
