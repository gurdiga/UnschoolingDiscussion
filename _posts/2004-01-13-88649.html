<div id="ygrps-yiv-873461847">This is an edited version of post I sent to another list where the list <br/>
owner had posted the following:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; However, unschooling, as a see it practiced by many, consists<br/>
 &gt; of leaving kids to their own devices<br/>
 &gt; until they show an interest in learning a given subject, and then<br/>
 &gt; facilitating their learning of that<br/>
 &gt; subject or skill. The fatal flaw in this is that interest in a given<br/>
 &gt; subject (for children and adults<br/>
 &gt; alike) does not arise out of nothing. We only discover our interest in<br/>
 &gt; a given subject (or decide we are<br/>
 &gt; distinctly not interested) as we are exposed and immersed in it to a<br/>
 &gt; greater or lesser extent.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Unschoolers do not expect interests to arise out of nothing.<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooling parent I offer ideas,<br/>
information, activities, starting points, and material to my<br/>
children as opportune moments arise, not out of nothing, but out of the<br/>
experiences that are created by mindful living in the world - walking<br/>
in the woods, visiting museums, watching movies, reading books, going<br/>
to the theater, swimming in the ocean. Every moment in life offers<br/>
opportunities for learning and investigation.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the Rose Parade and my 12 yo daughter wondered aloud why it<br/>
doesn&#39;t smell like roses even when you&#39;re right up close to the floats.<br/>
There was a great opportunity to talk about plants being grown for<br/>
various purposes - and how that is done - tomatoes raised for<br/>
transportability rather than taste, flowers for longlastingness rather<br/>
than aroma.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling families live in a learning world - no division<br/>
of life into school time and not-school time.<br/>
<br/>
We had an earthquake here last week (California) and we spent<br/>
considerable time watching the news about it and reading and<br/>
understanding what causes earthquakes and how their magnitude is<br/>
measured and also how buildings are constructed to be more safe in<br/>
earthquakes. Then the earthquake in Bam, Iran, struck. It was the same<br/>
magnitude as the one we&#39;d just experienced. My husband is Iranian, so<br/>
this adds to our focused interest there. We read about Bam itself, a<br/>
city whose buildings were thousands of years old and absolutely<br/>
gorgeous - all gone now. We found a website with fantastic pictures of<br/>
it taken just a few months ago. This whole last week we&#39;ve been<br/>
immersed in ancient history, geography, geology, and architecture. We<br/>
wanted to make a donation to the Red Cross for helping the people of<br/>
Bam, and that brought up the question of why there is the Red Crescent<br/>
in Iran, not a Red Cross. A little cultural geography thrown into the<br/>
mix. We also, by chance, watched a movie, called &quot;Cup Final,&quot; the other<br/>
night, which was about an Israeli soldier being held captive by a PLO<br/>
guerrilla group. Again, that tied in with us spending time talking<br/>
about the middle east and religions there and the long history.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers do not preplan a curriculum and we don&#39;t have predetermined<br/>
lesson plans. What we have instead is an extremely rich environment for<br/>
learning in which, for example, the globe sits on the living room<br/>
coffee table and is regularly handled and part of our everyday life<br/>
(not pulled out for a specific lesson). Learning is valued and<br/>
constant. Connections are looked for everywhere and the whole family is<br/>
involved and loves to explore ideas and gain new information and<br/>
knowledge. Learning happens inside the learner&#39;s own head and is not<br/>
always apparent to outside observers, but the proof, for me, is in the<br/>
pudding &lt;G&gt;. My kids think learning is what life is for. And I agree <br/>
with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244657475">I also will say &quot;Thank you Pam!&quot; for taking the time to write this.<br/>
<br/>
So often I have wanted to write something like this but just havn&#39;t had the sit down time to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a &quot;printer&quot;!    (In other words, one that I&#39;ll be printing out.)<br/>
<br/>
Is it OK if I forward it to my state unschooling list?<br/>

I used this for my local unschooling list. (I hope you don&#39;t mind)<br/>
I gave you all the credit.<br/>

<br/>
Good!<br/>
<br/>
I thought about you really hard yesterday afternoon, Joanna. Maybe because <br/>
you were reading the list and thinking &quot;I wonder if they know I&#39;m still around?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And maybe it was because of the questions about the Boston conference, and <br/>
those visions.<br/>
<br/>
I just went to check to see whether it&#39;s the anniversary of your son Sam&#39;s <br/>
death, and it isn&#39;t yet, but nearly.  January 19, a week away.   {{{{Joanna}}}}<br/>
<br/>
For those who don&#39;t know and especially those who might be in Boston (where I <br/>
hope and trust Joanna&#39;s family will be), Joanna&#39;s eight year old son Sam fell <br/>
through ice playing last winter, and Joanna sent this to another list about a <br/>
month later:  &quot;I keep <br/>
coming to the thought of trying to find a way to help parents really <br/>
understand how precious every minute is with their children.  <br/>
Appreciating the here and now.  Death comes when it will, so take <br/>
advantage of the now. <br/>
I have 3 other children and life is moving forward. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If any of you just can&#39;t go to the conference at all but would like to make a <br/>
contribution, there is a scholarship fund in Sam Wilkinson&#39;s name to which <br/>
you could contribute if you want to help someone else who&#39;s nearer and needy <br/>
attend.   <br/>
<br/>
Joanna is adamant that unschooling helped Sam and their family immensely, and <br/>
so one of the best ways to remember Sam is to help other people unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t intend to go toward all that, just to tell you, Joanna, that <br/>
yesterday you popped whole and in color into my head.<br/>

I&#39;d been thinking about Joanna and her beautiful family a lot lately...now I know my subconscious must have been remembering it was the time of year when it happened.<br/>
I was just telling Markus how I hoped the Wilkinson family would come to the 2005 unschooling beach party here, so he and Bob could lead us in a sing-a-long with the guitars.:)<br/>
I SO enjoyed seeing the pictures of Sam and knowing a little bit about the things he loved (I can see that disarming smile in a soccer uniform still). ((((((((((Joanna)))))))))))))))<br/>

When I posted, I hoped I&#39;d get some reply&#39;s of Hi back, but that was <br/>
really cool of you.<br/>
Sam thought the world was beautiful and fascinating.  His enthusiasm <br/>
was contagious and his spirit was a wonder to behold.  His short time <br/>
here was definitely blessed by unschooling.<br/>
He taught me so many lessons, and he&#39;s keeping right on with it.<br/>
My husband and I have a thing that when we find a penny, we say it&#39;s <br/>
from Sam.  Like a little sign from him.  I thought it was a nice <br/>
little thing to do, for a way to keep him with us.  But it turned out <br/>
to be more than that.  Bob has found pennies in the wierdest places.  <br/>
He says almost everytime he finds one in a wierd spot, it&#39;s when he&#39;s <br/>
having a bad moment and one will just show up.  We have some wierd <br/>
unexplainable things happen.  I&#39;ve noticed a pattern in my penny <br/>
finding.  It&#39;s every time I&#39;m getting short  or unreasonable and a <br/>
grump.  Right before I say something I&#39;m going to regret, I look down <br/>
and see it.  To me, the penny is Sam saying to me, &quot;chill out mom&quot;.<br/>
He used to laugh at me when I would get like that.  I&#39;d be freaking <br/>
out and he would just start laughing at me and make me realize how <br/>
ridiculous I was being.  He was usually the one to get me in that <br/>
state in the first place with all his energy.  <br/>
I really miss that energy.<br/>
Well, that all just spilled out.  <br/>
I&#39;ll prbably save this and print it.  But I&#39;ll share it with you all <br/>
too.<br/>
