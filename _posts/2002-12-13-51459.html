&lt;&lt; That&#39;s your choice, but there&#39;s no need to give us your cheap <br/>
psychoanalysis here. And I&#39;d suggest you &quot;bet your life&quot; on things you really <br/>
know for sure, instead of other people&#39;s personalities and &quot;hidden&quot; <br/>
motivations. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know Yol, Deb had been posting here quite a while, same with Sandra and <br/>
others that I&#39;ve gotten so much from<br/>
It pains me to read stuff like what you&#39;ve written above about Deb.<br/>
She&#39;s one of the truly great writers here and has shared so many personal, <br/>
intimate glimpses into her life of unschooling. It&#39;s profound. And it&#39;s <br/>
helped a lot of people.<br/>
Maybe instead of jumping all over anyone that questions why certain things do <br/>
or don&#39;t match up with unschooling, there could be a pause for reflection and <br/>
self analysis.<br/>

That was really sweet of you but I wasn&#39;t hurt. <br/>
<br/>
***has shared so many personal, <br/>

We have been so busy lately and I feel like I can&#39;t keep up at all.   So<br/>
many great topics go by and so many cool things happen around here I want<br/>
to share, but I don&#39;t always find time to post. <br/>
<br/>
We have been making our Christmas gifts this year and you would not<br/>
believe what the house looks like.   Dylan made bird and bat houses this<br/>
year for friends and they are lining the stairs and under the table and<br/>
on the table.   He&#39;s painted them in interesting ways, the one he&#39;s<br/>
painting this morning looks like a house, with shingles on the roof and a<br/>
little red chimney and windows and doors.   He painted one to look like a<br/>
cat (don&#39;t know what kind of crazy bird would live in there) one with<br/>
zebra stripes, one&#39;s psychedelic, (looks like a bad acid trip)   some are<br/>
plain, for the more conservative bird, and the bat houses all have bats<br/>
on them, of course (baseball bats).    We made some bird houses out of<br/>
gourds.   I hadn&#39;t done that before, but it was fun.   <br/>
David and Dylan are building a prototype trebuchet.   It is still on the<br/>
kitchen table, they are having problems adjusting the weights and there<br/>
is a list on the fridge of things they intend to fling when it&#39;s finally<br/>
in working order. (Well, it works, but it&#39;s hurling everything backwards)<br/>
 On the list, mashed potatoes, paint balls, jello, left over Halloween<br/>
candy, and Spiderman.  Poor Spidey.<br/>
I have made braided rugs and scarves and one afghan and peanut brittle<br/>
and almond roca and today, fudge.  <br/>
Today some friends are coming to help decorate a tree on our front porch,<br/>
which we put up each year in memory of my Dad who died in 2000. (bone<br/>
cancer)  He loved blue Christmas trees so some of his friends come and my<br/>
brother, and we eat and decorate and tell mean stories about my pop. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow we&#39;re having early Christmas with my mother in law, who will be<br/>
in Alaska with her other son on the real day, and Dylan has a sparing<br/>
clinic at his dojo, with Master Kim Sol, a big deal, and he gets in free<br/>
because he helped organize a raffle and bake sale for the club which made<br/>
$600. dollars!   I told him from now on you can only raise money for ME!<br/>
<br/>
So, if I don&#39;t get busy now, I&#39;ll be even more behind.  But I appreciate<br/>
your kind words and by the way, the feeling is mutual.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
