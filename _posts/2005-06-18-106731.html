Stanford Report, June 14, 2005<br/>
&#39;You&#39;ve got to find what you love,&#39; Jobs says<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the text of the Commencement address by Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple Computer and of Pixar <br/>
Animation Studios, delivered on June 12, 2005.<br/>
<br/>
I am honored to be with you today at your commencement from one of the finest universities in the <br/>
world. I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I&#39;ve ever gotten to a college <br/>
graduation. Today I want to tell you three stories from my life. That&#39;s it. No big deal. Just three stories.<br/>
<br/>
The first story is about connecting the dots...</div>
