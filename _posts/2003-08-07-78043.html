<div id="ygrps-yiv-814571867">&quot;We met online - she shook <br/>
me up and my life has never been the same.  I pay her back by doing my <br/>
own work - speaking, writing, and helping other parents give their <br/>
children the gifts that unschooling can bring.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same here. My life took a drastic change mid-course and I am eternally grateful. <br/>
AMEN PAM!!!<br/>
