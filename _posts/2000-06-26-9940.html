<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115815569">I wrote the message you quoted from and I stand by my statement.  Most<br/>
mothers *do* work to fulfill their own desires, or the desires of their<br/>
husbands.  Desires for bigger houses, newer cars, vacations, material things<br/>
that are not needed, but wanted.  Maybe they dug a debt hole before they had<br/>
kids, and now they &quot;have&quot; to work in order to meet the payments, but the<br/>
premise is the same.  They are working for wants, not needs.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I do think that we are all deprived by the loss of the extended<br/>
family relationships that once were so common.  My mother grew up with most<br/>
of her extended family around, and that is very different than what I grew<br/>
up with. I am not sure what you menat by &quot;hunter-gatherers&quot;.  Are you<br/>
implying that extended families have not lived within close proximity of<br/>
each other for thousands of years???<br/>
<br/>
As for saying that everyone has different standards of what is neccessary,<br/>
that is pure foolishness.  What is neccessary is shelter, water, nutritious<br/>
food, and clothing.  Pop-Tarts and Nike are not basic needs, they are wants.<br/>
Oatmeal and Wal-Mart  shoes would suffice.  Our society has taught us that<br/>
we &quot;need&quot; more than the basics though, and many people have been very apt<br/>
pupils.</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;food, and clothing.  Pop-Tarts and Nike are not basic needs, they are <br/>
&gt;wants.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  OK first -shelter- Yes what is necessary may vary- We have a very <br/>
inexpensive home BUT, we live in a high crime area. That would not be <br/>
acceptable to some. Also though  the specific block we live in is fairly <br/>
nice, the area around is often unkempt, littered with beer bottles etc. To <br/>
move to another part of town , the cheapest rent we have found is twice what <br/>
we pay now, and we HAVE looked extensively. We have chosen to stay for many <br/>
reasons , but if someone would rather have a safer , cleaner environment for <br/>
their family, would you blame them?<br/>
  second water-We live in an area where the water is very nasty-it tastes <br/>
bad and it is polluted if you&#39;re ok with your children drinking it fine, I <br/>
am not. Bottled water/or filters are not that costly however, but the point <br/>
is the cost can vary depending on your circumstances<br/>
   Third -you said NUTRITIOUS food- what constitutes nutritious to you may <br/>
not be the same to someone with food allergies or diabetes for instance. <br/>
There are many things that can complicate this cost.<br/>
<br/>
and four-Clothing- I cannot buy bargain clothing for my son. It never fits. <br/>
Thrift stores NEVER have clothing in his size ( I buy almost all MY clothes <br/>
there) He is not obese but has a fat belly and he is only average height if <br/>
I buy jeans at Walmart, if they fit around his middle they are 15 inches too <br/>
long, yes I can cut them off but they are not proportioned right. I&#39;m sure <br/>
I&#39;m not the only one who has this problem. Also some people have gentle, <br/>
quiet children, and some people have wild ,free , rambunctious children who <br/>
go through a new set of clothes every week ! :)(that&#39;s me!) :) so this <br/>
neccesity can vary too.<br/>
I know I&#39;m not going to change your mind and realy thats not my goal. I also <br/>
think that daycare is way overused, and I would sacrafice almost anything to <br/>
stay home with my son.&gt;But I wish you would not judge everyone else by your <br/>
standards. Each and every story is different.<br/>
Just my $.02.                Trisha<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240966898"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;   OK first -shelter- Yes what is necessary may vary&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, shelter is shelter, and we Americans have very superior shelter compared<br/>
to the rest of the world.  What is necessary does not vary, what the<br/>
perceived need is varies.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;, but if someone would rather have a safer , cleaner environment for<br/>
&gt; their family, would you blame them?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Blame?  I have not &quot;blamed&quot; anyone.  Nor have I called anyone a &quot;bad<br/>
parent&quot;.  Those terms are coming from people who seem to think that holding<br/>
an unpopular opinion is judgemental.  That aside, I think I know what you<br/>
mean.  Maybe.  My position is:  Parenting is the most important job in the<br/>
world.  There is nothing that I will do that will have such lasting impact<br/>
on the world in which I live.  Because it is such an important job, it<br/>
should not be left to others to do for me.  Someone else is capable of<br/>
answering phones, running a store, or writing reports.  There is *NO OTHER<br/>
PERSON* on this earth who is as capable of raising my children as I (and my<br/>
hsband) am.  Still with me?  Okay, given those beliefs I then must say that<br/>
leaving the most important job (raising my children) to someone else so that<br/>
I can go do another job is a wrong choice.  How can you see it any other<br/>
way?  It is very easy to see it another way if you believe that parenting is<br/>
a no-brainer that any one could do, but I don&#39;t see it that way.  Parenting,<br/>
especially mothering, has become such a lowly postion that it is no wonder<br/>
that so many mothers have left their primary job for something that is more<br/>
highly regarded!<br/>
<br/>
I have not said that women should never work, I am saying that women need to<br/>
make a choice between working or raising their children.  They can both be<br/>
done, just not at the same time.  Perhaps a woman wants to work first and<br/>
then have children, or maybe she chooses to have children first and work<br/>
after they are grown.  But one must choose which to do first, because when<br/>
they are done simultaneously then the children are the ones to suffer.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is the cost can vary depending on your circumstances<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We used to live in San Diego.  Very nasty water.  We bought bottled water<br/>
for drinking and used tap water for everything else.  There are very few<br/>
places where the water is completely undrinkable.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would allergies or diabetes complicate the issue?  We deal with<br/>
allergies, as do many of our friends, and it does not cost more.  As a<br/>
matter of fact, the allergies pretty much force us to cook from scratch<br/>
instead of relying on convenience foods. Medicine for an insulin dependent<br/>
diabetic can be expensive, but what does that have to do with food?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; go through a new set of clothes every week ! :)(that&#39;s me!) :) so this<br/>
&gt; neccesity can vary too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have a hard to fit child, and two boys who can rip holes in brand new<br/>
clothes far too quickly.  They have one pair of &quot;good&quot; jeans and the others<br/>
have thin knees or holes, which are fine for wearing around the house.  I<br/>
have found that elastic waist or drawstring waist pants are easier to fit on<br/>
the hard to fit child than jeans.  I also learned to sew!  Again, it is<br/>
choices.  Am I going to go to work to provide a new set of clothes for my<br/>
children or am I going to work with what I have so I can be home with them?<br/>
I think in the long run my being home is more important than lots of<br/>
clothes.<br/>
<br/>
.&gt;But I wish you would not judge everyone else by your<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; standards.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have not, and am not judging everyone by my standards.  I have offered our<br/>
scenario as an option.  I am trying to show that it is possible to live on<br/>
one income.  I do not expect everyone  to live as I do.  It would be far too<br/>
crowded out here in the country if they did!  We need to look at<br/>
alternatives though if we want to live within our means.  I learned to look<br/>
at needs very differently, and have become very creative at stretching and<br/>
re-using.  Our society has been pushing consumerism for far too long, and we<br/>
have been willing consumers.  It is past the time to get off the fast track<br/>
to debt and put our kids before things.<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t see what this whole thing has to do with hunter-gatherers.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dia if I interpret Trisha&#39;s  comments correctly, it may be a case of<br/>
canned fruit and other prepared foods etc sometimes being cheaper than<br/>
fresh but loaded with sugar. Diabetics have to control sugar and fat (to<br/>
keep caloric intake down ) in order to get adequate nutrition without<br/>
overloading their systems with refined sugars and risking diabetic<br/>
blackouts/comas.<br/>

Dia,<br/>
     Wal-Mart also pays its employees horrible wages and is tolerant about <br/>
family issues with its employees.  I have another aunt who works for them.  <br/>
Does this mean that you&#39;ll stop shopping there?  If you are aware of this and <br/>
continue to buy from them, does this mean I should judge you as hypocritical <br/>
or uncaring?  No, because you may not draw the same conclusions I do or you <br/>
may decide that it is the lesser of two evils (the other being needing <br/>
another income to support more expensive shoes, etc.).<br/>
