<div id="ygrps-yiv-656768713">Hi, <br/>
I&#39;ve just found and joined this group.  I have a 19 month old boy and am due with a second baby boy next month.  I am a full time stay at home mum and intend to be that way for the foreseeable future.  I am also single.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been very interested in all types of alternative child raising stuff and now landed in the world of unschooling while looking at education options here in the UK (knowing I dont want my kids to go to a mainstream school or nursery).<br/>
<br/>
My questions are with unschooling, or any form of homeschooling, how do you find &#39;me time&#39; or get a break?  Maybe its where I am in my parenting journey, (I&#39;m still cosleeping, with night wakings through the night).  Also, I dont leave my little one with anyone at the moment as he still has stranger anxiety!  I&#39;m sure it will get easier as he and the next one get older.  But for the early years, I really want to give them everything I can but sometimes / days its really hard to have the energy to be creative / take them out for activities / give the attention they want etc.<br/>
How has everyone else coped with this?  Are there any other single unschooling mums / dads out there?  And also to juggle working at home too?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice or links to articles / books etc would be apprieciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks</div>

There are links to UK groups and discussions here:<br/>

There will be a conference in London in late June (details not known yet), and if you want I could add you to the e-mail list to receive announcements of that.  There will be another gathering in Edinburgh in late May.  I&#39;ll be at both of those, which is why I know.  <br/>
<br/>
HesFes is a large campout gathering you might already know about, and that might be a place to meet people who have ideas for your specific situation.  You can find it at hesfes.co.uk<br/>

Unschooling considerations don&#39;t all transfer to other forms of homeschooling, because unschooling ends up being a full time way of life.  Here are some ideas:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends on your finances and the ages of the kids. Yours are little <br/>
babies - so I wouldn&#39;t even try to get much time away from them, they <br/>
need you to be with them most of the time. Embrace that fact. The time <br/>
that they are SO dependent on you won&#39;t last forever - enjoy it. But if <br/>
you can find a friend to trade off with, once a week for an hour or two, <br/>
knowing you have a couple of hours of alone time to look forward to <br/>
might be nice. Even better, get a mother&#39;s helper to come in and play <br/>
with the little ones while you take take a shower. My daughter sometimes <br/>
gets hired to do this, and the moms sometimes just go in the kitchen and <br/>
cook or get on the phone for a long, relatively uninterrupted, <br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
When the kids get older, one thing to remember is that having other kids <br/>
over to play at your house often gives mom more free time. This seems <br/>
counter-intuitive to some people who think having extra kids means extra <br/>
work, but, with the right kids, it can mean the kids are happy and busy <br/>
and mom can get some other stuff done.<br/>
