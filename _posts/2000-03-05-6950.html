We do not live in oklahoma now, but we did for 5 years, my husband is<br/>
from there and I miss it terribly, and want to go back. We have only been<br/>
homeschooling for this year, but the difference it has made is<br/>
unbelievable, I to, have had a problem admiting we are unschooling as<br/>
people get so weird when you try to explain that your children are<br/>
learning and are not neglected, but I have reached the point where what<br/>
is good for my kids makes it easier for me to deal with disapproval. I am<br/>
lucky to have the support of my mom and mil, my sister in law has hsed<br/>
for 16 years, so she laid the path for the rest of us. As a family (I<br/>
have 8 childre) we have made a commitment to continue the wonder of<br/>
teaching our children ourselves. btw I had my first child a month after I<br/>
turned 17 and my last 2 months before I turned 36, I play as much with<br/>
him as I did with her, I think it really is about how you feel about<br/>
yourself and life inside.<br/>

In 100 years it will not matter what kind of car I drove,<br/>
where I lived or how much money I had, but<br/>
The world may be better because I made the difference in the life of a<br/>
child!<br/>
