Hi Susan,<br/>
I&#39;m closer to you, Chugiak :-)  I&#39;ve been meaning to post<br/>
an intro but I&#39;m in my garden so much I hardly get to the<br/>
puter!<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9yo daughter and 5 yo son.  We have been home schooling/<br/>
unschooling for 4 years.  My children would love to get<br/>
together with other unschooler&#39;s...in fact I have been<br/>
thinking of starting a group for Eagle River/Chugiak.<br/>
The valley is so close, maybe we could even start<br/>
a group that includes Palmer/Wasilla?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really motivated to start a new group but haven&#39;t<br/>
a clue how to do that.  Any of you more experienced,<br/>
organized Mom&#39;s and Dad&#39;s have some tip&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
Thank&#39;s for any tip&#39;s on organizing a group!<br/>
