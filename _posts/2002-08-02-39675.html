<div id="ygrps-yiv-36156897"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;did anyone every hear their kids spell tree ~CHREE!???&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;Casey did this! But she did it all the way. She also spelled trip as<br/>
chrip, <br/>
etc.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose 9 year old who couldn&#39;t read was amazed to find<br/>
out that &quot;dress&quot; was spelled with a &quot;d&quot; instead of a j or g because she<br/>
pronounced it &quot;jress&quot;. IT is hard to tell the difference unless you<br/>
listen close to her. She was also amazed to find out the &quot;leg&quot; spells<br/>
leg and &quot;egg&quot; because she always pronounced them &quot;aig&quot; and laig&quot;. SHe is<br/>
starting to read a little now with some encouragement as it is very<br/>
embarassing to her. I read to her and her 3 siblings (ages 11 - 15) out<br/>
loud great stories, some short some long. And help her read a few words.<br/>
She actually said she wants to read now! Before it was always &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
want to read, it&#39;s too hard.&quot; When ever she said that I would pick up a<br/>
good book and read to her so she would not miss the flow of beautiful<br/>
language and great stories.<br/>
<br/>
My own daughter spoke very early and always clearly. One midwife told me<br/>
that kids who are not breast-fed don&#39;t develop their tongue muscles as<br/>
much and have a harder time forming the sounds of the language. Don&#39;t<br/>
know if this is the only reason in all cases, but it may have some<br/>
effect. Yes, Natural does it better again!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. Casey did this too. She did it mostly before she was reading. I&#39;m <br/>
amazed at how her spelling has become more conventional the more she just <br/>
reads.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Casey always described reading as &quot;too hard&quot; until she was ready to do it. <br/>
But the beautiful language and complex stories I read her seemed to go to <br/>
some writing part of her brain. Way before she could read she was writing <br/>
stories with many characters, lots of dialogue and beautiful phrasing. I&#39;m <br/>
glad I never gave her a writing lesson, it probably would have spoiled it <br/>
all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, not to screw up any pro-breastfeeding stories, but both my kids were <br/>
nursed. Conor had poor articulation and Casey&#39;s was always very good. She <br/>
just heard &quot;J&quot; in dress. :o)<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
