 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a single mom and I&#39;ve never gotten any money from Cacie&#39;s dad or<br/>
anyone else (which is fine with me) so I&#39;ve had to work. For me, though,<br/>
the most important part is to live frugally enough that I don&#39;t need to<br/>
earn a lot of money. *That* is actually something I&#39;m very good at, and<br/>
that&#39;s how I ended up having lots of money in the bank even though in the<br/>
past 4 years I&#39;ve never made enough to owe any state income tax. I don&#39;t<br/>
feel deprived, and somehow we can afford things that our technically<br/>
better-off friends can&#39;t, like riding lessons and theater camps... but <br/>
we don&#39;t buy a lot of stuff we don&#39;t need, we don&#39;t buy a lot of<br/>
pre-packaged food, we stock up during sales, we don&#39;t eat much meat, we<br/>
accept all hand-me-downs and shop thrift stores, and we use libraries a<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
I worked for two years as an indpependent study teacher for a charter<br/>
school, and for part of that I was regional coordinator. The job required<br/>
meeting with about 15 families once a month, usually in their home, one<br/>
or two monthly meetings, and lots of paperwork at home. Most of the<br/>
families had kids Cacie liked, so she would come with me - if she didn&#39;t<br/>
want to come, I left her with a friend. I did a lot of paperwork while we<br/>
watched tv in the evenings, or sometimes when she was asleep or visiting<br/>
a friend or had a friend over here. It helped that she had an active<br/>
social life ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For the past 6 months or so, I&#39;ve been making some money through selling<br/>
things on ebay and other places online. Cacie helps by spotting stuff at<br/>
thift stores and yard sales - I give her half the profit on stuff she<br/>
finds - and by doing some of the photography for ebay. Other times,<br/>
again, she plays with friends, or reads, or does something that doesn&#39;t<br/>
require much of my attention - although with everything I&#39;ve done, I can<br/>
stop right away in an emergency, and if she has a question like &quot;Where is<br/>
the cream of tartar?&quot; I can usually come to a good stopping place in a<br/>
few minutes. I guess, basically, she has her stuff she&#39;s doing, and I<br/>
have my stuff, and sometimes we do stuff together... and mostly what I do<br/>
for $ is just my stuff.<br/>
<br/>
On a typical day, I wake up an hour or two earlier than she does (she<br/>
often goes to bed later than I do, usually reading). I drink coffee and<br/>
read email, and that&#39;s a good time to get work done. During the day we<br/>
usually have stuff going on, but she often  likes to relax and read or do<br/>
things by herself in the evening, so I can do my stuff, or else she&#39;ll go<br/>
visit the neighbors. If I know I have a lot to do in a short period of<br/>
time, I&#39;ll sometimes try to arrange for her to visit a friend, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t come up much. <br/>
