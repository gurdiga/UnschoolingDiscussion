 </span></blockquote>cooking (or doing whatever) because we enjoy it.  And if we<br/>
choose to not do it, that&#39;s fine too.   It sounds like she<br/>
cooks when she is inspired to do so, but maybe that isn&#39;t<br/>
that often :-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that she doesn&#39;t cook because she doesn&#39;t enjoy it. She was never <br/>
allowed in the kitchen and is almost afraid of it. When we were young she was <br/>
fascinated about how cooking &quot;happened&quot;, but still wasn&#39;t &quot;allowed&quot; as a <br/>
child/teen. As an adult, I don&#39;t know why she hasn&#39;t learned (I&#39;ll ask this <br/>
Thursday! &lt;g&gt;). Maybe she likes to eat out every meal. I guess some do.<br/>
<br/>
The original point was that her mother&#39;s kitchen was off-limits. She was not <br/>
ALLOWED to play and experiment---and that&#39;s sad.<br/>

Kelly, I really did understand what you were saying and I agree.  The<br/>
last sentence just tickled my funny bone and I had to chime in a bit.  I<br/>
love to cook too and your post reminded me that I need to let the kids be<br/>
involved in that with me more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793344182">I&#39;m the one who misunderstood the post. :-{  Ididn&#39;t realize<br/>
she was talking about two different people.  Sorry for the<br/>
confusion.   I stand by my point (whether or not it was<br/>
supported by the email I was responding to) that it&#39;s a good<br/>
idea to do things that we WANT to do and find other ways to<br/>
get done what we DON&#39;T WANT to do.  :-)   And I don&#39;t mean<br/>
making our kids do them either but rather to be willing to<br/>
think outside the box to come up with solutions to our<br/>
&quot;problems.&quot;   So I guess I&#39;ll find a way to say that even if<br/>
it has nothing to do with the thread. LOL.<br/>
