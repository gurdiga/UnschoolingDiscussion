said &quot;certain phrases don&#39;t exist outside of situations meant to put<br/>
children in their place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The implications of that are that you are a mean mom if you say them.  All I<br/>
have ever said is that I think the phrases aren&#39;t limited to just putting<br/>
kids in their place.  I was arguing against the black and white of it.  That<br/>
is all.  I am not defending the phrase (its not one I have ever even used, I<br/>
don&#39;t think)  I just think the &quot;either-or&quot; is simplistic.  Thats all.<br/>
<br/>
I was not the one wanting to limit ideas.  I was the one posting just the<br/>
opposite.  I was the one posting that people may have different connotations<br/>
associated with phrases based on their history....like if a dog gets shocked<br/>
by an electric fence he will give it a wide berth, whether or not there is<br/>
any electricity behind it.  Another dog will play and play near and over the<br/>
fence if he has never felt the electricity.<br/>
<br/>
If you have not experienced phrases as a put down to children, you may well<br/>
use them without the pain others might associate with them.  Basic<br/>
psychology.<br/>
<br/>
Again, obviously a difference of opinion.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; But to say, &quot;I am NOT a short-order cook,&quot; implies that the person<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; asking is being unreasonable. It implies that they are trying to take<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; advantage of you.  It makes the child &quot;wrong&quot; in asking.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Guess I just have much thicker skin.  Differences of opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But how does your inability to hear it as negative or inexperience with<br/>
&gt; &quot;short-order cook&quot; being negative help others unschool or become more<br/>
aware<br/>
&gt; parents?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s like pointing out during a discussion meant to help people get past<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; barriers that using the word teach can throw in front of their path to<br/>
&gt; unschooling, &quot;Well, I don&#39;t have a problem with the word teach.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not everyone will have the same problems so some techniques won&#39;t apply.<br/>
No<br/>
&gt; one technique will work for everyone who has a particular problem. But<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; good for the ideas to be out there swirling around because they might help<br/>
&gt; someone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; in a joking<br/>
&gt; &gt; manner after spending time cooking breakfast while his mom was sleeping<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; her wanting something just as he was starting to clean up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Even if he was joking, it was coming from a place of &quot;You&#39;re asking too<br/>
&gt; much,&quot; even if he then felt it was okay to do as much as was being asked.<br/>
&gt; How was his mother to know all the energy he&#39;d been spending while she was<br/>
&gt; asleep? It&#39;s a way of saying &quot;You should just be able to know what a<br/>
drained<br/>
&gt; state I&#39;m in and not even bother to ask.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; His mother probably got what he meant since she&#39;s an adult and has<br/>
&gt; undoubtedly ended up in similar situations. But a child doesn&#39;t have that<br/>
&gt; understanding and can&#39;t have it until she&#39;s grown and has spent all<br/>
morning<br/>
&gt; cooking or doing things for others. The child is just suddenly in a<br/>
&gt; situation where she&#39;s expressed what she needs as she usually does and for<br/>
&gt; some mysterious reason the person she&#39;s asking gives her a reply that<br/>
&gt; implies she shouldn&#39;t have asked and she should have realized she<br/>
shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have asked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For a child to not hear that as a rebuke or to understand that &quot;not a<br/>
short<br/>
&gt; order cook&quot; is just code for &quot;I&#39;m exhausted,&quot; they need an atmosphere of<br/>
&gt; hearing people express their real feelings and offering alternatives. They<br/>
&gt; need to hear things like &quot;I&#39;m really tired. Could I get you something<br/>
&gt; simpler?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How to create that atmosphere would be more useful than &quot;That doesn&#39;t<br/>
bother<br/>
&gt; me.&quot; Because if it doesn&#39;t bother you, it probably came out of an<br/>
atmosphere<br/>
&gt; of people being honest with their feelings. And it would be useful for<br/>
&gt; people to see how that atmosphere gets created.<br/>

but I am not a mean mom. I said a thing that has a meanspirited <br/>
connotation but still..... takes more than that to make somebody a <br/>
&quot;mean mom.&quot; Wonderfully nice moms sometimes blow it!! Especially when <br/>
they go on automatic-pilot and use the kinds of phrases that are <br/>
typically used to belittle (gently or harshly) children.<br/>

<br/>
Right.<br/>
<br/>
Because meanness is NOT in the intent.  It&#39;s in the perception.<br/>
<br/>
Electricity shocks people whether the person who wired the fence up meant for <br/>
them to touch it or not.   <br/>
<br/>
A harmful thing is a harmful thing regardless of the known feelings of the <br/>
perpetrator/user.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking all day of how to explain the way my son and I sometimes<br/>
sound.  We name call and are totally obnoxious to each other.  It&#39;s a game<br/>
and it&#39;s based on the realization that we can say anything and it&#39;s ok.  But<br/>
I couldn&#39;t get across, any time I thought about it, the idea that there has<br/>
to be that trust and honesty to make those jokes ok.<br/>
<br/>
We are still on the path, as it were, and recently had a HUGE fight.  His<br/>
wants and my wants got in the way of each other and I got angry and he got<br/>
stubborn and frankly, he was right.  -sigh-<br/>
<br/>
Later I asked him if maybe we shouldn&#39;t be at home together, if maybe it<br/>
wasn&#39;t working.  I was feeling defeated at the &#39;backsliding&quot; as it were.<br/>
But he said no, even our worst days were better than school and the way<br/>
things were.  And he meant it.<br/>
<br/>
So I may still f-up sometimes, but we are getting there.<br/>
