&quot;Okay, if this works for you then go for it!  Just don&#39;t drag the kids who&#39;d<br/>
rather ride one ride over and over and over for the moment with you.<br/>

I love this!  I may cross-stitch it and frame it - Nah - I&#39;d never get it<br/>
finished - I&#39;ll just print it out and hang it on the fridge!<br/>
