<div id="ygrps-yiv-585656327">My kids love &quot;The Cartoon History of the World&quot; (read first two books, want <br/>
me to order the third) and today when I was looking him up on Amazon I noticed <br/>
a lot of other books by him.  Cartoon Guide to Physics, Chemistry, Genetics, <br/>
Environmentalism, Sex, etc.  Does anyone have any of these and do you (and your <br/>
kids) like them?  <br/>
<br/>
What other non-textbook fun type books do you have and like?  I&#39;m thinking of <br/>
stuff like the Dummies Guides, or the &quot;I Hate Mathematics&quot; book.  My kids <br/>
love these type of things and I&#39;d love to make a lot of them available this year.<br/>

 I like them.  Got both Physics and Genetics at garage  sales.  No one else <br/>
here has picked them up.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a computer-game version of this book available, or there was.  <br/>
(We have it, but I don&#39;t remember my son playing it.)<br/>

<br/>
I have physics, and read part of genetics at someone else&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
My kids haven&#39;t discovered them.  If someone needed to study physics I&#39;d <br/>
surely point it out to him or her.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about the other two, and might look through them at a store <br/>
sometime.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cartoon Guide to Statistics has the same content as a statistics <br/>
textbook would have - it is high level stuff - college level. Good book <br/>
- I like it and recommend it for statistics.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a whole series of &quot;Brown Paper School&quot; books -- Marilyn Burns <br/>
wrote some of them and worked with a group of authors who wrote others. <br/>
I like all of them - we&#39;ve had fun with most over the years:<br/>
Marilyn Burns: The I Hate Mathematics Book, The Book of Think or How to <br/>
Solve a Problem Twice Your Size, Good for Me, This Book is About Time.<br/>
Jamie Jobb: The Night Sky Book.<br/>
Linda Allison: The Reason for the Seasons: The Great Cosmic <br/>
Megagalactic Trip Without Moving from your Chair, Blood and Guts: A <br/>
Working Guide to Your Own Insides.<br/>
David Weitzman: My Backyard History Book<br/>
Tom Walther: Make Mine Music.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We all also really really liked the &quot;Horrible History&quot; series of books <br/>
- the ones by Terry Deary - &quot;The Vile Victorians&quot; and so on.<br/>
