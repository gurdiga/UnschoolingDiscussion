Oooh,  <br/>
<br/>
When I was little, we had a bar that we could screw/tighten right into the door frame.<br/>
<br/>
On either side of the bar there was rubber that would grip the wood of the frame.  Turning the bar would tighten/loosen it.   I loved that bar,  hanging by one leg and swinging around and around it  :)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there are any of these around anymore?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32148879">Wow!  What a cool item -- thank you soooo much for passing this on!  My <br/>
kids are very active and are bored silly.  We&#39;ve been housebound due to <br/>
all the snow and temps in the teens and this would be *perfect* to have <br/>
for them!  If only it was rated for more weight -- I wanna use it too!  <br/>
LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040052807">Funny to see this topic come up because as I read/write, dh is in the living<br/>
room installing 2 swings side-by-side to our 15 foot high beams. It&#39;s great<br/>
because you can swing *really* far! We&#39;ll put hooks on the wall so you can<br/>
hook them up out of the way when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I bought these, as well as a set of rings and a trapeze, at IKEA.<br/>
(www.ikea.com or www.ikea.ca or wherever you happen to live). They&#39;re called<br/>
EKORRE. For $15 Canadian (so they&#39;re likely cheaper in the US), you get a<br/>
lovely nice sized wooden swing with ropes, etc. Special hooks to install are<br/>
$5, though we&#39;re using something else we had in the workshop. The wooden<br/>
trapeze with rope/hardware was only $9.99. They should work well in a<br/>
doorway as well, or outside, on the ceiling, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
A nice and very much cheaper option then the onestepahead combo, though it&#39;s<br/>
maybe a touch trickier to switch the swing with the trapeze or rings--we&#39;ll<br/>
probably hang each one in it&#39;s own spot.<br/>
