<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139570110">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I just recently joined this group in hopes of seeking support. This includes<br/>
my relearning or rethinking what society has brainwashed me with as being<br/>
&quot;normal or ok&quot; and though I&#39;ll get flamed by the obvious monopoly, I feel I<br/>
must say something as the posts below really upset me.<br/>
<br/>
It one thing to disagree with someone, but to do so in such a disrespectful<br/>
and undignified way is really upsetting to me. Where is the peace in this<br/>
type of reply? Where is the love & understanding. Intolerance and impatience<br/>
aren&#39;t tools for teaching and I am here to learn.I will make mistakes in my<br/>
parenting path and I will disagree with people here as we are all not alike<br/>
nor are our styles of &quot;parenting&quot; and that should all be ok.<br/>
<br/>
I shouldn&#39;t feel afraid to post in fear I&#39;ll get slammed by certain members<br/>
like Oom. I didn&#39;t feel she was accusing or labeling anyone in particular,<br/>
just sharing an opinion. So why attack? I&#39;m positive, I too, will get a heap<br/>
of flaming, but I find this terribly uncomfortable and unfair. I&#39;d be much<br/>
more willing to listen to a non-reactionary gentle reply. It&#39;s a bit like<br/>
the pot calling the kettle black to accuse of attack and then retaliate by<br/>
attacking back as well. Non-reaction is an emotionally adult way to handle<br/>
such things, not more insults and accusations or assumptions. Give the topic<br/>
up Oom, you don&#39;t have a chance. You&#39;ve already been hung before tried. I&#39;ve<br/>
seen it happen before.<br/>
<br/>
This is the 5th time I&#39;ve been too intimidated to post because of this type<br/>
of reaction. I honestly don&#39;t think Oom was name calling, etc... She is on<br/>
another list that I have been on and appears to be a gentle soul.<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t we agree to disagree on certain subject, treat each other with respect<br/>
and dignity?<br/>
<br/>
I wish you all well. I doubt I&#39;ll post after this out of fear. I feel<br/>
terrible about this as I still have many many questions and came seeking<br/>
help on many issues as I feel very alone in our unschooling journey. It&#39;s a<br/>
shame a few ruin it for the many. :(<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to all and PEACE,<br/>
Jeva<br/>
<br/>
*********************************************<br/>
Since you know SO much and seem to dislike this list SO much, what&#39;s the<br/>
deal?<br/>
<br/>
If your way is working great for you, just go do it!  Because your<br/>
commentary<br/>
and advice aren&#39;t adding to unschooling peace and prosperity.<br/>

I think it would be disrespectful to assume a poster is too shallow or<br/>

say spanking is ok when it isn&#39;t.  I think it&#39;s disrespectful to children<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960877693">I feel that we can convey honesty, no matter how blatant with <br/>
respect. When comments are made with sarcasm, instead of showing <br/>
someone there is a better way, it generally turns the listener off. <br/>
What good is that? <br/>
<br/>
By using sarcasm and shame, you are no better than the person <br/>
spanking and shaming their children in front of a crowds of people. <br/>
You lose the the audience. Certainly a more mature response would <br/>
have a better chance of helping this person to see the assumed error <br/>
instead of abuse and verbal lashing. Not much sense in being an <br/>
advocate for non-violence only to lash out, accuse, and be hateful.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I&#39;d sooner respect the opinion of a mature individual who <br/>
makes clear statements, not personal attacks. It&#39;s how the message is <br/>
conveyed. Do you teach your children with such reactions? Or do you <br/>
help them with patient guidance. Yes, we are supposed to be adults <br/>
here and we don&#39;t have to sugar coat everything, but no one gets <br/>
anywhere with shame and sarcastic insulting attacks.<br/>
<br/>
After posting I&#39;ve gotten quite a few responses privately from others <br/>
who never post out of fear of harsh judgement and attacks. That&#39;s <br/>
pretty sad. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m at all surprised though at this point.<br/>

<br/>
What was disrespectful?  What was more disrespectful than making sexist<br/>
comments about children and their level of intelligence and proudly<br/>
bringing up the subject of spanking and insisting it&#39;s fine and a good<br/>
choice on a list where thoughtful parents strive everyday to be<br/>
respectful of their children?<br/>
<br/>
Why do you feel such a need to defend this poster? <br/>
Are you defending insulting and hitting children?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think the poster is right?<br/>
<br/>
You could have chosen to give her intelligent well thought out support. <br/>
Instead you accuse people of being hateful because they posted in defense<br/>
of children. <br/>
<br/>
If you have a clear argument to support spanking, shaming and insulting<br/>
children, please express it here in support of the original poster.   If<br/>
you only want to insult those who took the time to create thoughtful<br/>
responses, you&#39;re wasting our time. <br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t think insulting and hitting children is a good choice why<br/>
are you so angry at those expressing disagreement with a poster who came<br/>
here of her own free will and brought the subject up herself?<br/>
<br/>
***After posting I&#39;ve gotten quite a few responses privately from others <br/>
who never post out of fear of harsh judgement and attacks.***<br/>
<br/>
Yes and it&#39;s just possible they cannot defend their positions and so must<br/>
take that less mature road in the hope of gaining secret support from<br/>
others.   <br/>
<br/>
While you have objected strongly now in two posts to the kind of<br/>
responses the poster received we have not seen your loving, understanding<br/>
response to her claims boys are retarded and spanking is a useful<br/>
parenting tool that does no harm to children. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-280083363">That&#39;s the whole point. Why should we have to defend ourselves. Is <br/>
this a war or a discussion list? Also, my post wasn&#39;t directed at <br/>
you. Why do you feel the need to defend other people? Probably the <br/>
same reason I do.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s NOT the disagreement I have a problem with. It is the way the <br/>
message is being conveyed. You can try to justify violence with <br/>
retaliating with more violence, but it&#39;s a dead end road. <br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve said now twice, I don&#39;t need to defend anyone or myself. It&#39;s <br/>
simply too bad that people are to intimidated to post or ask <br/>
questions for fear of a lashing. <br/>
<br/>
I would think it much more constructive to offer to show people a <br/>
better way than react negatively.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of being so preoccupied with one upping one assault with <br/>
another, why not attempt to make change or simple agree to not agree <br/>
without verbal lashings. Just like the point of my first <br/>
point...completely ignored. <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t advocate spanking, but feel it&#39;s perfectly ok to react to <br/>
another&#39;s violence with more of the same?<br/>
<br/>
Does it get us anywhere? Does it show the person who spanks a better <br/>
way? No, it just intimidates people and all is unresolved.<br/>

I agree with Deb.<br/>
<br/>
When people whine here that their &quot;needs&quot; weren&#39;t taken seriously or they <br/>
weren&#39;t receiving affirmation, etc., it seems to me that it&#39;s almost always those <br/>
very moms who came here to TRY to get more experienced unschoolers to tell <br/>
them that what they&#39;re doing is just as good as anything, that their children <br/>
will not be harmed by their continuing meanness, and that they&#39;re Good Moms.<br/>
<br/>
What if I came new to this list and said &quot;Okay, my kids are lazy brats  and <br/>
IF they stop talking back to me and stop being sneaky, THEN I&#39;ll start being <br/>
nice to them, but if they haven&#39;t shaped up and started doing some schoolwork, <br/>
I&#39;m going to ground them, spank them, and send them to school without any <br/>
breakfast.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I  would HOPE you all would care more about my children&#39;s tender feelings and <br/>
tender butts and tender futures than you would care about my right to <br/>
continue to be a dope.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181376569">***Why should we have to defend ourselves.***<br/>
<br/>
If a person comes freely to a discussion list about unschooling and posts<br/>
numerous ideas and attitudes which are harmful to children and to parent<br/>
/ child relations that person should be able to explain why insulting<br/>
children and hitting them makes better sense than  mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
The poster didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t do that. <br/>
<br/>
If a person holds a conviction, lives by a philosophy and participates<br/>
willingly in a discussion, that person should be able to support her<br/>
convictions and philosophies.   No one has been forced to come to this<br/>
discussion list and participate. <br/>
<br/>
***Also, my post wasn&#39;t directed at <br/>
you. Why do you feel the need to defend other people? ***<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re post was sent to the entire list and I&#39;m here because I feel<br/>
children need advocates in a world where the people who are supposed to<br/>
love them and care for them make excuses for hitting  and insulting them<br/>
instead. <br/>
<br/>
 ***You can try to justify violence with <br/>
retaliating with more violence,***<br/>
<br/>
I do not consider thoughtful discussion violence.   Some people find any<br/>
kind of disagreement distasteful but that&#39;s not the same as violence. <br/>
How do you want people to type when they disagree with a poster?  What<br/>
should we sound like when we say children should never be hit?   Where is<br/>
the violence in saying everyone can stop making bad choices and make<br/>
better ones? <br/>
<br/>
***I would think it much more constructive to offer to show people a <br/>
better way than react negatively.***<br/>
<br/>
Then do that.   You&#39;re posts have been all about trying to teach posters<br/>
to this discussion a lesson.  If you think there is a better way to end<br/>
spankings and verbal insults to children be the example and post those<br/>
better, more constructive ideas yourself. <br/>
<br/>
If you only want to complain about the way others post here, perhaps you<br/>
can e-mail the moderator directly for help and ideas.  <br/>

It&#39;s a discussion list.<br/>
If you want to make points you can&#39;t defend, it&#39;s a very lame discussion list <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
People can&#39;t discuss things without saying what they do, what they&#39;ve seen, <br/>
or what they believe.  If all you&#39;re doing and seeing has to do with this list, <br/>
the contributions aren&#39;t very helpful to people wanting ideas and information <br/>
about unschooling and living with their children peacefully as unschooling <br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of telling us about your home, yourself and your children, you told <br/>
us what you think about this list.   Maybe we need another list on the side to <br/>
discuss this list.  THIS list is for discussing unschooling-related issues, <br/>
and respect for children and gentle treatment of children are both better for <br/>
unschooling than antagonism and spanking are.<br/>

Jeva, if you can do this better, do it.  If you can gently convince someone <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The kids didn&#39;t voluntarily sign onto a discussion list.<br/>
<br/>
Jeva -- the list gets pretty hot and heavy on this particular topic and <br/>
some others.<br/>
<br/>
The list description warns people (or at least it did until recently <br/>
when it was changed).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to give you some unsolicited advice &lt;G&gt; - if you&#39;re willing to <br/>
listen.  After many years of intensive involvement with online email <br/>
discussions, I&#39;ve realized that it ALWAYS blows things up further if <br/>
someone comments on other people&#39;s posting styles and it NEVER once has <br/>
resulted in a person changing their style. Instead, people defend and <br/>
people attack and the list gets totally sidetracked from its purpose.<br/>
<br/>
Please let it go - if you are so offended that you can&#39;t get enough <br/>
useful from the list, then there are a number of other lists available. <br/>
If you can overlook the posts that seem offensive to you, you might <br/>
just find a whole lot of value here. (And some people even discover, <br/>
eventually, that those posters they thought were rude and mean turn out <br/>
to be offering some of the most valuable stuff.)<br/>

their &quot;tones&quot;, etc., is NEVER ever ever ever helpful in the way you are <br/>
wishing it would be. I know you just wish you could point it out and <br/>
the people whose posts bother you would recognize themselves and change <br/>
and that then the list would be the peaceful place you imagine it could <br/>
be. But it won&#39;t work. It won&#39;t. You&#39;ll only make things worse if you <br/>
continue this line of posting.<br/>
<br/>
The only solution would be to kick people OFF the list if they were <br/>
perceived as being rude by a given percentage of people. We could all <br/>
vote on who is &quot;in&quot; and who is &quot;out.&quot;  Make membership contingent on a <br/>
popularity contest.<br/>

online.  But if there&#39;s something I feel strongly about, I am gonna post, but <br/>
I can&#39;t control other people&#39;s responses.  <br/>
        I had to get used to the idea that I am, indeed, going to get <br/>
responses that I don&#39;t like.  And the one thing I have learned, is, don&#39;t take it <br/>
personally, and don&#39;t make it personal, and you&#39;ll be able to have very <br/>
interesting debates.<br/>
         I forget that sometimes, for example, not so long ago, on this list, <br/>
and the convo went nowhere fast.  That was my fault for not following my own <br/>
rule!  <br/>
       No need to fear a lashing, if someone does that, and you don&#39;t want to <br/>
play, simply don&#39;t respond.  But you can&#39;t control other people&#39;s <br/>
personality, or responses, and on lists where there is what I call an &quot;overmoderator&quot;, <br/>
the list gets stifled and dies. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No, it just intimidates people and all is unresolved. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I understand, but if a person is intimidated,  I think it&#39;s best if that <br/>
person takes responsibility for feeling that way, not blame others for &quot;making&quot; <br/>
them feel that way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471119802">No, a few ruin the list for the many by being so nasty.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Because of your hostile attitude, you&#39;ve missed the message. <br/>
<br/>
The message is if you want to put a stop to violence, you do so <br/>
maturely, and not in a verbally abusive and sarcastic assault.<br/>
<br/>
I never said I agreed with spanking. What I did say was that you get <br/>
no where with sarcasm, assumptions, and insults. Violence breeds <br/>
violence. I also never said I agreed with Oom at all. I&#39;m simply <br/>
saying that you&#39;ll get no where with sarcasm. I also didn&#39;t comment <br/>
on most all you mentioned below and it appears you like to make <br/>
assumptions about people you don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
Also because of such disrespect and lack of patience people who could <br/>
possibly learn about gentle guidance for children or how to deal with <br/>
their situations in a positive manner are too afraid to post fearing <br/>
being chewed out.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s terrible.<br/>
<br/>
No one is going to listen to a snotty nasty reply. You&#39;d get further <br/>
with a little patience and guidance instead of reacting with anger. <br/>
It just breeds more anger, you&#39;ve lost the audience, and the child <br/>
will probably go on being spanked which is a shame. <br/>
<br/>
This obviously isn&#39;t the first time this has occurred on this list <br/>
now that I&#39;m reading past posts. It appears to be an on going <br/>
difficulty involving the same people.<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t get anywhere attacking people. I&#39;m sure Oom and others <br/>
would be much more willing to listen to a mature calm wise reply that <br/>
is helpful and maight cause her or others to rethink their actions <br/>
instead of a reactionary rant full of sarcasm and nasty comments on <br/>
how horrible and wrong she is. <br/>
<br/>
Ruin the chance to help this mother find gentle discipline? <br/>

Yes, you are.<br/>

I&#39;ve been reading doesn&#39;t resemble what you&#39;ve described.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve seen is a lot of hours patiently and peacefully put in over the<br/>
past couple of days offering arguments and evidence why big people hitting<br/>
little people is a bad idea. And what I&#39;ve read in response is opinions,<br/>
weak support and a refusal to consider that what has been said has any<br/>
merit.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a bad formula for discussion and a good formula for frustration. And<br/>
frustration is what I&#39;m reading today.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s true that nastiness is not a good learning tool, neither is<br/>
refusal to try to understand the philosophy that&#39;s discussed on this list.<br/>
<br/>
The discussion of the list and the &quot;discussion&quot; of spanking -- which<br/>
apparently never got to that level -- needs to stop so the list can be used<br/>
for more useful purposes.<br/>

You&#39;re right, I should have posted and suggested some other gentle <br/>

<br/>
Oom, if you haven&#39;t unsubbed yet, please feel free to contact me on <br/>
or off the list if you wish to discuss other more gentle ways of <br/>
guiding and helping  your child instead of spanking. <br/>
<br/>
I apologise for not posting to you sooner, but I was fairly shocked <br/>
by the replies you have gotten. I hope you&#39;ll stay or join another <br/>
list where people are not so apt to attack you, but perhaps help in a <br/>
friendly gentle manner. <br/>
<br/>
There are easier more positive ways to work with your child instead <br/>
of using physical force that would be much better for both you and <br/>
your child. I&#39;m certainly open to helping if I can.<br/>

Discussing unschooling and mindful, peaceful parenting is what this list <br/>
DOES. If you (general you) want to advocate spanking, you have to realize that <br/>
nobody here will just let it lie. It WILL get discussed until the advocate backs <br/>

<br/>
Not so much offended as sad that people would be so violent when <br/>
addressing such a topic as spanking and how wrong it is! Replying to <br/>
a woman who obviously needs help to stop violence with more violence <br/>
is pretty sad. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree that at times, even the most hostile have something to say <br/>
that is positive. It helps if you agree with them. lol!You are <br/>
correct though, and I&#39;ll head back to lurkdom. From reading the <br/>
archives, not much changes in this area. <br/>
<br/>
Two quotes that I love:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Human kind has to get out of violence only through nonviolence. <br/>
Hatred can be overcome only by love. Counter-hatred only increases <br/>
the surface as well as the depth of hatred.&quot; - Mahatma Gandhi <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nonviolence means avoiding not only external physical violence but <br/>
also internal violence of spirit. You not only refuse to shoot a man, <br/>
but you refuse to hate him.&quot; - Martin Luther King, Jr. <br/>

Thought it was right and good and deserved.<br/>

It&#39;s a whole different ballgame when someone *asks* for help.<br/>
<br/>
And NOBODY was spanking Chris. Not one OUNCE of violence here. STRENUOUS <br/>
objections---and no different than anyone of us would do with out own children if <br/>
they decided to spank as parents.<br/>

there on the street corner and the fact that people on the corner <br/>

Arguements about who posts how, in my opinion, are totally worthless.  I could start a list for &#39;pissed off subscribers to unschooling-discussion&#39; if it would help, but I sure as hell (now there&#39;s an interesting phrase lol) won&#39;t be posting to it.<br/>
