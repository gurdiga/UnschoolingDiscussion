&lt;&lt; How in the world did this subject end up here?  Anyone know how the <br/>
post was allowed?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same way yours got here.  Yahoo groups can be joined by anyone, and this list <br/>
isn&#39;t set to moderation (which means the listowner has to read each post and <br/>
say &quot;okay&quot; or &quot;not&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Just let it go by.  If we all discuss every piece of spam then THAT jams up <br/>
the list.  Ignore the tacky junk.  That&#39;s less work than being on a moderated <br/>
list and waiting a day or two for a post to show up because it was approved.  <br/>
Nobody wants to read hundreds of posts in advance to save us from one <br/>
occasional spam croquette.<br/>
