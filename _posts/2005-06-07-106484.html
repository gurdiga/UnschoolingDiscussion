<div id="ygrps-yiv-876919511">a few years ago I experienced, within the same year:<br/>
death of father, loss of lover, fired from job, death<br/>
of old best girlfriend, unexpected pregnancy, and<br/>
abortion. at this time my son was still in school.<br/>
I got on Prozac because I felt I was functionally<br/>
unfit to mother at that time. About a year later I<br/>
realized that my son would be better off unschooling.<br/>
It was all a tough transition.<br/>
He is better off unschooling, and I am better off on<br/>
Prozac.<br/>
Sometimes we have too much grief to deal with all at<br/>
once, and our children will act it out.<br/>
Maybe if you just share this post with this woman,<br/>
that will help.<br/>
Good luck<br/>
Anna<br/>
