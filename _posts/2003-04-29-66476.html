EVER again.<br/>
<br/>
Now, do you really think that unless they ASK you to do anything you&#39;re <br/>
pushing something on them?  Even the daily things that are expected like <br/>
meals and such?  That&#39;s a much bigger hurdle for me than the math to figure <br/>
out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108731026">Now, do you really think that unless they ASK you to do anything you&#39;re <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
The correct analogy would be that your child wasn&#39;t hungry but you decided that she *has* to be hungry since she hasn&#39;t eaten all day. Even so, you let her decide when she wants to eat. (After all, at some point, she will HAVE to eat SOMETHIN!), <br/>
<br/>
And since you love her SO much, you decide you&#39;ll make her favorite meal for her, complete with all the trappings.<br/>
<br/>
So you cooked her favorite meal and spent all day preparing it so she would LOVE it when she decided she was finally hungry.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t you see how in doing so, you would have missed that all she really wanted was ice cream?<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t you see that cooking her favorite meal was something you did so that you could achieve your own goal of being &#39;the good mother&#39;?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-891914488">Your daughter loves logic games and you see a new one at the store and<br/>
buy it and leave it on the table for her to take up or not,<br/>
<br/>
is different from,<br/>
<br/>
You thinking it would be good for your daughter to write more and buying<br/>
her a journal and leaving it on the table for her to take up or not. <br/>
<br/>
The difference is YOUR expectation. <br/>
<br/>
Your daughter loves to read Dean Koontz so you take her to the book store<br/>
to look for the latest one in paperback, <br/>
<br/>
is different from <br/>
<br/>
You thinking you&#39;re daughter should be reading more Shakespeare so you<br/>
buy the complete works and give it to her as a present. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that hard a concept to understand.   What does she love and how<br/>
can you help her do it?   Not what do you wish she would do, NOT what you<br/>
think she might need to do.   <br/>
<br/>
I get the feeling you are looking for a step by step curriculum for<br/>
yourself.   <br/>
You have to move on, deschool, embrace unschooling and be calm.<br/>

<br/>
Saying something a bunch of times isn&#39;t the same as understanding it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  No talking about anything unless THEY ASK.  Got it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, that&#39;s not what people have said.<br/>
<br/>
Posting falsely on the list is a disservice to people who come here to read.<br/>
If you don&#39;t understand, sit and hush instead of getting up in the midst of <br/>
everybody and making half the noise.  Seriously, I know some of the newer <br/>
people here must thing this poor poster is being bullied, but it&#39;s more a <br/>
case of list disruption and littering.   <br/>
<br/>
Asking questions isn&#39;t a bad thing, but veiling insults as questions doesn&#39;t <br/>
make them good and honest questions.   If I say &quot;OH FINE, since you people <br/>
all obviously believe and keep on saying three times three is twelve, no <br/>
WONDER I can&#39;t get math.  Thank you to the people who wrote to say maybe <br/>
three times three isn&#39;t twelve, but obviously it must be.  I get it. I get <br/>
it...&quot;  then someone is going to say &quot;We said twelve can be grouped lots of <br/>
ways.  There are lots of way to get twelve.  Just because there are several <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean three times three is one of them; it&#39;s not.  And nobody here <br/>
said three times three was twelve.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OBviously I don&#39;t understand math, but if I don&#39;t ask and talk through what <br/>
I believe about twelve, then how will I learn?  And aren&#39;t we all just trying <br/>
to get to twelve?  And if I say I believe three times three is twelve, how <br/>
can  others say that&#39;s wrong?&quot;<br/>

I get the feeling that this is *the* major issue here.  It&#39;s awfully easy<br/>
these days for stay at home mothers to feel that they have to justify it by<br/>
being the perfect parent.  That&#39;s what I&#39;m seeing here.  The only problem is<br/>
that it&#39;s an impossible goal.  We do the best we can.  Best not to fret too<br/>
much about it.<br/>
