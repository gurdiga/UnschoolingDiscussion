<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145860693">I am going to delurk on this.  We have a 4 year old, a 2 1/2 year old and an <br/>
8 month old.  All boys.  We just bought more software for the boys tonight.  <br/>
We allow them to play with their software anytime we&#39;re not on and we&#39;re <br/>
available to supervise.  Than, our four year old, is getting to the point <br/>
where he can play some of his games by himself.  Almost all the software we <br/>
have is educational, but I&#39;ll have to say the only games that I really would <br/>
object to would be killing games.<br/>
<br/>
I think having a computer is an advantage when HS/US, as it&#39;s easier on me to <br/>
&quot;teach&quot; certain things.  Than is very independent and learns things easier on <br/>
his own.  The computer provides a wide range of knowledge, right at our <br/>
finger tips.  <br/>
<br/>
We went to the zoo on Ground Hog&#39;s Day.  Our local zoo has free admission in <br/>
Feb. but I didn&#39;t know this, so we took the money that we would have spent on <br/>
admission and went to the gift shop.  The boys picked out some toy dolphins <br/>
and elephants.  While playing with them at home, they asked me what sounds <br/>
they made.  We looked at our video collection first, but alas no videos had <br/>
dolphins or elephants on them, so we decided we would have to wait to go to <br/>
the library.  But then I remembered the internet!!  So we looked up dolphin <br/>
and elephant sounds and lo and behold we found some sound waves.  The boys <br/>
were thrilled with them!  When we went to the library, they remembered that <br/>
we wanted to get books and videos on elephants and dolphins.  So we had <br/>
several learning moments!!<br/>
<br/>
Also wanted to add about support groups.  I felt very weird about joining an <br/>
unschooling with all my kids under the &quot;norm&quot; schooling age.  But I felt I <br/>
needed the support and also I wanted to feel the waters while I could still <br/>
gracefully back out if I changed my mind.  I also wanted to give my husband <br/>
two years to get used to the idea of not only hsing but unsing!  Than turns <br/>
five after the 1st of Sep. which is the deadline here.  So this gives gives <br/>
us time to try out the water without a lot of comments from friends and <br/>
family.  <br/>
<br/>
We have one cat who is spitting up food.  It&#39;s not vomit (sorry to be <br/>
explicit) it&#39;s barely digested food.  We feed them quality dry food free <br/>
choice and free access to fresh water.  We just got them from a friend in <br/>
Nov.  She says that he has always had a tendency to spit up if he gulps his <br/>
food.  But with free choice and a secluded room (it&#39;s our dressing room, we <br/>
have all our dressers and shelves in their with everyone&#39;s clothes and we&#39;re <br/>
in it in the morning to dress and at night to change for bed.) he shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have any reason to gulp his food.  Also there doesn&#39;t seem to be a pattern, <br/>
sometimes he&#39;ll go a week with no spit up and then he&#39;ll spit up several days <br/>
in a row.  Last week it got so bad and frequent that he spit up once in the <br/>
bowl.  But then I switched to Purina Deli Cat to see if he&#39;d like that <br/>
better, well he went a whole week and then this morning he first spit up and <br/>
then actually vomited twice with in a half hour.  So now we&#39;re back to the <br/>
high quality food (I think it&#39;s Hills, but my friend supplies the food and I <br/>
can&#39;t remember specifically, it might be Science Diet.)  Any ideas?  <br/>
<br/>
TIA!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1348173125">Oops, sent my last reply before I was finished. Has this cat been examined<br/>
by a vet for a congenital malformation of his esophagus? I&#39;ve known of dogs<br/>
with this condition who were doing exactly what you have described with your<br/>
cat.<br/>
