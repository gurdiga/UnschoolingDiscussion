Something that requires rental cars might be more expensive than hotel rooms, <br/>

overall.  And not just overall, but for individuals who might come from far <br/>
away.<br/>
Then again, you could try to just do something for driving families and not <br/>
those who would have to fly.  That&#39;s no more &quot;unfair&quot; than an airport hotel <br/>
would be to a family just a few miles away who wanted to drive and camp. <br/>
<br/>
True...Frankly, ALL of New England ain&#39;t that big, and anyone coming WOULD <br/>
drive or something. And if we got any speakers from away, we could certainly <br/>
pick them up. <br/>
