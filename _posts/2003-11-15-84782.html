Cool.<br/>
And the really funny thing? His younger sister (6) has been mucking about with words and reading simple stuff for over a year. He&#39;s reading harder stuff than she is already.

That is wonderful for your son.  Zach is 10 and has never been interested in<br/>
reading until he found &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh&quot; cards about 3 weeks ago and a new friend<br/>
who is very interested in them.  All of the sudden, Zach is reading entire<br/>
sentences as well.<br/>
<br/>
As my uncle would say &quot;Well, drop my drawers!!&quot;<br/>
