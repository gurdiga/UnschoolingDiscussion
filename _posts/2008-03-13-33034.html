&quot;1. How do I help ds11 earn money from outside our family? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
You could honestly tell your son that you don&#39;t know how to make money and refer him to the &#39;experts&#39; who have written books about it or who have websites or anything.    There&#39;s the movie &quot;The Secret&quot;, too.   I&#39;ve seen books at the library about earning money for kids....<br/>
<br/>
Once I was in a store with a kid (about 7yo) and he stood there in front of the candy counter with the following dilemma:  &quot;I want to keep my dollar bill but I want some candy.&quot;  I thought to myself, &quot;bummer, there&#39;s no way!&quot;  I didn&#39;t have any money with me at all... I had walked him to the store bec. HE wanted to buy something.....I turned to a man in line and repeated the boy&#39;s dilemma and he said, &quot;well, here&#39;s 4 quarters, you can get something with that.&quot;    I became a &#39;believer&#39; after that in POSSIBILITIES.  Just when you think nothing will work... along comes a solution from nowhere!<br/>
<br/>
My kids (9,11, and 13yo) have earned money selling flowers through Dutch Mill Bulbs .... (dutchmillbulbs.com)  sell the flowers for $5 and keep $2.50....   we used to do it as a fundraiser for charities but I&#39;ve more recently decided that they should keep some of the money as commission.   They hadn&#39;t thought of that!  So, they keep some of the money and some of it goes to charities (one is our non-profit &#39;homeschool&#39; group) and they&#39;ll choose another.  They say that the flowers will sell better with a charity however, I suggested that telling people that you had a horse to support might be a selling point, too... whatever.... I have it going for all the kids in our &#39;group&#39; and am hopeful that they will sell a lot of flowers and make a lot of money for themselves.   I hope, too, that they will feel more empowered about getting money and whatever they want with that money....<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have the energy, inclination, or whatever to earn money, then he can be pointed into directions where he can earn money or get his &#39;stuff&#39; without money.  <br/>
<br/>
To me, it comes down to identifying a problem (wanting money) and brainstorming solutions.... and there&#39;s always the internet and library for ideas....<br/>
<br/>
Also, I had to get out of their way... one of my kids is starting a pet-sitting business out here in the country and I think I sometimes have my stuff show up in how I talk to her.... I have to remember that her starting this business is HER business - whether she makes a ton or not... I&#39;m just here to support her... the mistakes and successes are hers to make.....  <br/>
<br/>
IMO, there&#39;s great power in identifying one&#39;s &#39;problem&#39; and working towards it - whether one is successful or &#39;not&#39;... and those &#39;nots&#39; fall under Einstein&#39;s comment about knowing what doesn&#39;t work and thus is not an unsuccessful endeavor.... <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not your job to give him money neccessarily.... but you can support him in getting his own.....<br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t know if I&#39;m making sense here but it&#39;s a beautiful evening so I&#39;m going out to walk with the dogs before we go bowling with friends at &#39;buck fifty&#39; night at 930pm...<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all for now...<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Can you drive manure around and offer to sell it to people doing  <br/>
spring gardening?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s an unschooling parent&#39;s job to provide access to the  <br/>
world, and that always costs some money.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to me that it&#39;s productive to tell an unschooled kid  <br/>
&quot;If you want something, get a job,&quot; or &quot;If you want money, make your  <br/>
own.&quot;  I&#39;m not just pulling this idea out of my ass, either.  My boys  <br/>
have had thousands of dollars in savings from money they earned.   <br/>
Holly worked babysitting, making a little over $100 a week.  She  <br/>
bought a ticket to Rhode Island to visit her friend Quinn, and took  <br/>
$300 or so with her to spend.  I offered to help with the ticket but  <br/>
she wanted to do it herself.<br/>
<br/>
None of them had a job because they had to.  The advantage of that is  <br/>
that they&#39;re working out of the joy and desire to be there, not out  <br/>
of fear of quitting.  Even now, Kirby doesn&#39;t have to be afraid to  <br/>
quit his job.  He has no car payments (inherited a car when his uncle  <br/>
died) and we&#39;d be glad to have him move back here.  So he&#39;s working  <br/>
because he wants to.  He LIKES his job.<br/>
<br/>
Until a child decides to want to work, pressing him to do it seems  <br/>
like pressing a child to read or &quot;do math,&quot; instead of waiting for it  <br/>
to come naturally.<br/>
<br/>
People who think the desire to work won&#39;t come naturally haven&#39;t seen  <br/>
many unschooled teens, I think.<br/>
