<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003027092">I am looking for a little broader acceptance of unschooling.   Not in <br/>
the &quot;we unschool except for math, etc&quot; sense, but more of a <br/>
seperation from strictly AP methods only being accepted <br/>
as &quot;unschooling&quot;.     To me, this list does not want to accept that <br/>
some folks DO unschool, they do trust thier children to learn, they <br/>
do not use curriculum, but they still have some traditional parenting <br/>
ideals too.   All of the no chores, bedtimes, &quot;rules&quot;, stuff.    Some <br/>
parents are not comfortable with not restricting TV, video games, <br/>
foods, etc.   Personally, I have very VERY few restrictions on what <br/>
my kids watch, eat and play.  But, I have a tolerance level.  If I <br/>
need to go run an errand and the kid wants to sit home and watch TV <br/>
or play a game.. I have to insist they turn the TV off and get in the <br/>
car.   If I buy chocolate chips to make a special birthday cake, I <br/>
have to &quot;not&quot; let someone eat it all before I make the cake.   If my <br/>
kids will not quiet down and my husband desperately needs to go to <br/>
sleep, I &quot;make&quot; them go to bed.. ( turn off the light and quiet <br/>
down)   If they continue to fight over a video game, I turn it off <br/>
and direct them to find something else to play.  <br/>
<br/>
  There is a HUGE difference in being an adult with years of <br/>
knowlege, experience, and impulse control whom lovingly and carefully <br/>
guides thier children toward making good decisions and some <br/>
authoritarian, abusive, controlling parent who lives by arbitrary <br/>
rules and restrictions.   Some folks on this group want to make it <br/>
seem like it is an &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; standpoint.    Either you unschool <br/>
by AP, no rules, no bedtimes, no chores, no restrictions.. OR you are <br/>
NOT an unschooler.   I do not believe that.  That to me is the same <br/>
type of  discrimination as &quot;Christians&quot; saying you are not a <br/>
Christian because you ______________( don&#39;t go to my church, wear <br/>
pants, watch rated R movies, like to read Harry Potter, have gay <br/>
friends,  etc etc)<br/>
<br/>
Folks on this group openly admit they have an arbitrary set <br/>
of &quot;guidelines&quot; that define unschooling and unless you adhere to them <br/>
100%, you do not belong here.  <br/>
<br/>
How about a group that is a little more acceptance of diversity and <br/>
the sheer fact that  all families are uniquely comprised of <br/>
individuals for whom XYZ does not always work.?  <br/>
<br/>
How about an unschooling group that does not discriminate based on <br/>
rank?<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy just talking and reading about what is going on in <br/>
each others unschooling lives.. What works for you.. what was fun.. <br/>
what was learned ( incidentally, not intentionally)???  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a kinder gentler unschooling list.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I fall into that category---no rules, no restrictions, no chores, etc. <br/>
<br/>
But what you just described is simply kindness to and consideration of and <br/>
respect of ONE ANOTHER. THAT&#39;s what this list DOES promote. It&#39;s NOT about <br/>
chidren gone wild. It&#39;s about respect for each other. Children can&#39;t BE respectful <br/>
unless they are treated respectfully. That doesn&#39;t mean letting them run me <br/>
over. That would be disrespectful of ME. My boys would no sooner think to do <br/>
that than jump off a cliff (well, Cameorn might jump off the cliff first!&lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I think some folks come here, read a little while, and then think that, <br/>
because we have no rules, the children rule the roost. It&#39;s not like that. It&#39;s a <br/>
case of mutual respect and trust. The &quot;education&quot; part of unschooling runs into <br/>
the &quot;manners&quot; part of life. And since &quot;Living is learning is unschooling&quot;, <br/>
it&#39;s all the same.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t see having another list that would say: &quot;Come here to talk about <br/>
unschooling and show no respect your children.&quot; That would be the antithesis of <br/>
unschooling. I doubt Helen would even go for that.<br/>

KNOW that the folks on this group do not let thier kids walk all over <br/>

know that because I have read what the ranks of this group writes <br/>
about thier daily lives. .  It is so subtle, so non pervasive, but <br/>
it&#39;s there.   I think the majority of this group attack new comers <br/>

Joyce asked what we would like to see in other unschooling groups.  I <br/>

&lt;&lt; The veteran <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t see how you can have read here for a year and still cling to the <br/>
&quot;rule the roost&quot; and &quot;cowtowing&quot; stereotypes.  (Unless you like being cowtowed to <br/>
and ruling your roost, maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
If someone has never EVER considered there might be an advantage to giving <br/>
kids more freedom over their lives, how is it &quot;flying in hard and fast&quot; to share <br/>
that there are options?    Where else will they find out if everyone says <br/>
&quot;Cool&quot; to whatever someone writes no matter how much harder it might make their <br/>
path to natural learning?   Grounding kids and spanking them, for instance, <br/>
doesn&#39;t make them love natural learning (nor make them love their parents more, <br/>
except in an increasingly unhealthy way).  So if someone comes here and says <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m unschooling, but my kids follow all my rules or else I spank them,&quot; someone <br/>
will probably point out to them the advantages of considering a change.<br/>
<br/>
WHY?<br/>
<br/>
Why would people here do that?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think they&#39;re being mean?  Do you think we make $15 everytime someone <br/>
stops spanking or grounding or turning shows off halfway through?<br/>
<br/>
No.   It&#39;s done because some people (not most, but several) remember what it <br/>
felt like to be treated that way, and they&#39;re hoping to make yet another <br/>
child&#39;s life stronger and more peaceful and more loving by helping their parents <br/>
see how little effort it takes to go from controlling to accepting and guiding.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think the majority of this group attack new comers <br/>
<br/>
and brow beat them &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re defending parents who attack and browbeat children.<br/>
<br/>
The whole set of phrases you&#39;ve used are not things unschoolers use to talk <br/>
about parenting.<br/>
<br/>
brow beat<br/>
attack<br/>
fly fast and hard<br/>
rule the roost<br/>
cowtow<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It is automatically set up to be a conflict, laced <br/>
<br/>
with confusion and berating attitudes.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see not a speck of truth here.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;IF a new group like this was formed, <br/>
<br/>
would it somehow &quot;hinder&quot; this group?   Helen has seen that there is <br/>
<br/>
a need for alternatives to this list.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of unschooling lists.  There are several lists at the HEM <br/>
site, and one is another unschooling list.    It&#39;s nice sometimes, and then goes a <br/>
week without a single post.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought that&#39;s what I wanted when I first came to this list too. But <br/>
honestly, I had unschooled off and on unsuccessfully for years <br/>
and couldn&#39;t figure out why my family wasn&#39;t having the kind of <br/>
success I read about. I have never been an authoritarian, <br/>
controlling parent or person. But I definitely fell into the category <br/>
of seeing myself as having the right ideas about how to live, eat, <br/>
sleep and TV view and felt it was my responsiblity to make sure <br/>
my kids learned my views.<br/>
<br/>
 To me, this list does not want to accept that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; some folks DO unschool, they do trust thier children to learn, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; do not use curriculum, but they still have some traditional <br/>
 </span></blockquote>parenting <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ideals too.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not using curriculum isn&#39;t the definition of unschooling (though I <br/>
thought it was for years.)<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;d unschool, we&#39;d begin well (no curricula, lots of <br/>
interest led activities and days), but my position of superior <br/>
experience, intelligence and wisdom gleaned through the years <br/>
would slowly undermine my trust that they would indeed learn <br/>
what they needed. This happened the most when they&#39;d look like <br/>
they weren&#39;t doing anything I valued. (lots of time on the <br/>
skateboard, or lying around on the floor, or listening to music all <br/>
day). So I&#39;d add math back in, and then a little reading and then <br/>
some writing. Pretty soon I was &quot;just adding those things they <br/>
need and can&#39;t see that they need&quot; and Poof! Unschooling was <br/>
gone!<br/>
<br/>
  If I <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; need to go run an errand and the kid wants to sit home and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>watch TV <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or play a game.. I have to insist they turn the TV off and get in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; car.   If I buy chocolate chips to make a special birthday cake, I <br/>
&gt; have to &quot;not&quot; let someone eat it all before I make the cake.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t see why. Couldn&#39;t you warn your children that you need to <br/>
run an errand and find out what time would work for all of you? <br/>
You&#39;re assuming that kids mean to undermine your goals. Can&#39;t <br/>
you mark a bag of choclate chips and remind them that the cake <br/>
needs them so to leave them be? My kids would respond to that.<br/>
<br/>
This is my point. You&#39;re starting from a different idea of who <br/>
children are and it will influence your unschooling at some point. <br/>
What will you do if your kids just aren&#39;t interested in prparing for <br/>
college and you see ahead and believe that it&#39;s vital to their <br/>
futures? Will you then set a limit and say &quot;You must take these <br/>
courses?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This list showed me that for my unschooling life to take off, I had <br/>
to start from a completely different set of assumptions. The <br/>
questions you&#39;re asking no longer sound to me like they come <br/>
from the worldview of unschooling. I predict that while you are a <br/>
kind and conscientious mother, and while you believe in interest <br/>
led learning, the fact that you see yourself in the position of  <br/>
having more meaningful experience and the power to make <br/>
decisions for your kids will translate into doubts and anxiety as <br/>
you watch them unschool, especially if unschooling for your kids <br/>
means studying cartoons by watching cartoon network all day <br/>
every day.<br/>
<br/>
Would that be okay with you? Or would you want to &quot;guide them&quot; <br/>
into some other activity that is more &quot;unschooling&quot; as you <br/>
envision it?<br/>
<br/>
This was the crux of it for me. If I truly believe that children are <br/>
rational, capable, complete human beings (who simply lack <br/>
experience and resources), then I can allow them room for all <br/>
kinds of things including how they learn as well as what they eat, <br/>
how they spend their time, what they view.<br/>
<br/>
If I see myself as the dispenser of wisdom and schedules, I will <br/>
override my children when I find them in disagreement with my <br/>
value system.<br/>
<br/>
So are you unschooling by the definition here? Does it matter? It <br/>
sounds like what matters to you is that you are a part of a context <br/>
that reassures you that you are unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s your definition of unschooling?<br/>

defend what I would like to see.  I will copy and paste several <br/>
different defintions of unschooling, including the one on this groups <br/>
home page. <br/>
<br/>
  My post brought about the exact kinds of accusations and <br/>
misunderstandings that get so tiresome on this list. Not specifically <br/>
from you, but from several members.  I do not brow  beat my <br/>
children.  I do not spank them.  I do not control them.  I do not <br/>
restrict them.  But, if I say (ok, &#39;admit&quot;) on this group that <br/>
sometimes I do take an authoritarian role, that gets misconstrued.  <br/>
<br/>
Let me just ask this, plain and simple.  Did Helen want to know what <br/>
folks want from an unschooling list or not?   Sandra implied that I <br/>
should start my own list.. well,, DUHH that is what I was referring <br/>
to .. A DIFFERENT LIST.   Not changing this one.   Obviously, there <br/>
has been some consideration from Helen that this list does not meet <br/>
all the needs of the members, otherwise, why ask for suggestions for <br/>
another list??  I do not think she intended the suggestions for <br/>
debate over THIS list.   <br/>

Attacking newcomers?  I was not attacked when I first started posting, and<br/>
I&#39;ve seen dozens of other people join and start posting without being<br/>
attacked.  Somebody just yesterday (I think) posted about limiting TV.  I<br/>
saw some &quot;uh ohs&quot; and a few &quot;you might want to think about that&quot; kinds of<br/>
posts.  That&#39;s all.  Now if that person comes back and vigorously defends<br/>
her TV position, I expect there will be some people vigorously disagreeing.<br/>
Anybody who has read this list for a while would know not to take a position<br/>
that they can&#39;t back up.  It&#39;s the new people who don&#39;t bother to read for a<br/>
while who will defend their position and get all upset when someone<br/>
disagrees.  And the last thing I would have thought about the more prolific<br/>
posters here is that their kids rule the roost.  What I&#39;ve learned from<br/>
these people is how to respond to kids&#39; needs in a way that gets everyone&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933324157">Personally, I have very VERY few restrictions on what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; my kids watch, eat and play.  But, I have a tolerance level.  If I<br/>
&gt; need to go run an errand and the kid wants to sit home and watch TV<br/>
&gt; or play a game.. I have to insist they turn the TV off and get in the<br/>
&gt; car.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This example has nothing to do with TV restrictions and everything to do<br/>
with the respect that family members show each other.<br/>
<br/>
If I buy chocolate chips to make a special birthday cake, I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have to &quot;not&quot; let someone eat it all before I make the cake.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has nothing to do with letting kids choose the foods they eat, and<br/>
everything to do with the respect that family members show each other.<br/>
<br/>
If my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; kids will not quiet down and my husband desperately needs to go to<br/>
&gt; sleep, I &quot;make&quot; them go to bed.. ( turn off the light and quiet<br/>
&gt; down)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has little to do with children choosing when to sleep and everything to<br/>
do with the respect that family members show each other.  Would you not be<br/>
quiet if one of your children desperately needed to sleep for some reason?<br/>
<br/>
If they continue to fight over a video game, I turn it off<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and direct them to find something else to play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has nothing to do with video game restrictions and everything to do<br/>
with how we help our kids resolve conflicts.  (And turning it off doesn&#39;t<br/>
help them learn that.)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some folks on this group want to make it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; seem like it is an &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; standpoint.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting.  I see an &quot;us&quot; vs &quot;them&quot; standpoint, but it usually comes from<br/>
the people who are complaining rather than &quot;the regulars&quot; (for want of a<br/>
better term) setting themselves up as &quot;us&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Either you unschool<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by AP, no rules, no bedtimes, no chores, no restrictions.. OR you are<br/>
&gt; NOT an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ve been reading here for a year and you haven&#39;t seen many, many posts<br/>
saying that you don&#39;t have to be an AP parent with no rules, etc, but that<br/>
you might want to consider it because it would make unschooling work better<br/>
for your family?  I&#39;ve seen many posts like that.  What I haven&#39;t seen is<br/>
anyone saying that you aren&#39;t an unschooler if you have any rules.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Folks on this group openly admit they have an arbitrary set<br/>
&gt; of &quot;guidelines&quot; that define unschooling and unless you adhere to them<br/>
&gt; 100%, you do not belong here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, I&#39;ve seen people say that someone who unschools except for math or<br/>
whatever might be happier somewhere else, but I haven&#39;t seen anyone say that<br/>
that person doesn&#39;t belong here.  Can you see the difference?  If what<br/>
people are saying here upsets you (generic you) and that distress isn&#39;t<br/>
causing you to rethink some of your beliefs (which could be valuable) why on<br/>
earth stay?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; How about a group that is a little more acceptance of diversity and<br/>
&gt; the sheer fact that  all families are uniquely comprised of<br/>
&gt; individuals for whom XYZ does not always work.?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about a La Leche League group that supports mothers who use bottles<br/>
because breastfeeding doesn&#39;t work for them?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; How about an unschooling group that does not discriminate based on<br/>
&gt; rank?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure you can find a list someplace where no one will ever be challenged<br/>
when they say something that isn&#39;t true or isn&#39;t logical.  That isn&#39;t a list<br/>
I&#39;d want to spend time on.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I really enjoy just talking and reading about what is going on in<br/>
&gt; each others unschooling lives.. What works for you.. what was fun..<br/>
&gt; what was learned ( incidentally, not intentionally)???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gee, I thought that&#39;s what we do here.  At least I see those kinds of posts<br/>
lots.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe a kinder gentler unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots of those out there.<br/>

<br/>
So why if you&#39;re unschooling except for parenting, are you upset that we<br/>
never discuss how to apply traditional parenting methods?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To me, this list does not want to accept that<br/>
&gt; some folks DO unschool, they do trust thier children to learn, they<br/>
&gt; do not use curriculum, but they still have some traditional parenting<br/>
&gt; ideals too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It has been stated many times that some unschoolers do use traditional<br/>
parenting methods.<br/>
<br/>
People can take unschooling as far as they want to. They can confine it to<br/>
&quot;academics&quot;. They can extend it into parenting. They can even unschool<br/>
&quot;except for math&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But in terms of advice and ideas, the list needs to stick to unschooling<br/>
advice and ideas. It&#39;s what the list is called after all! ;-) Traditional<br/>
parenting isn&#39;t unschooling -- even if unschooling parents use it. Mindful<br/>
parenting is extending the ideas of unschooling into family life so mindful<br/>
parenting is an appropriate topic.<br/>
<br/>
The need to stick to unschooling advice and ideas makes it *seem* like<br/>
people are saying to be an unschooler means you need to be an attachment<br/>
parent. But that isn&#39;t it. What is &quot;it&quot; is that if you&#39;re asking for advice<br/>
on an unschooling list, you&#39;re going to get unschooling advice. Attachment<br/>
parenting is unschooling philosophy extended to parenting. Traditional<br/>
parenting is not unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
The difference -- and this could cause one of those &quot;rank&quot; discussions again<br/>
if someone doesn&#39;t try to understand my point -- is that the list sticks to<br/>
unschooling advice not advice from unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some <br/>
&gt; parents are not comfortable with not restricting TV, video games,<br/>
&gt; foods, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if to them the benefits of not restricting don&#39;t seem to outweigh the<br/>
difficulty of adopting a new parenting philsophy then they shouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but they still have some traditional parenting ideals too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect our parenting *ideals* are much the same: decent human beings. But<br/>
our ideas (and methods) for acheiving those ideals are very different.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, I have a tolerance level.  If I<br/>
&gt; need to go run an errand and the kid wants to sit home and watch TV<br/>
&gt; or play a game.. I have to insist they turn the TV off and get in the<br/>
&gt; car.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You don&#39;t *have to* insist. You *choose* to insist.<br/>
<br/>
What we discuss here are the alternatives so parents *don&#39;t* feel they have<br/>
to insist, so they know they have alternatives. Then they can *choose* what<br/>
suits them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure we don&#39;t need to tell people that one of their options is making<br/>
their kids do something. (And that wouldn&#39;t be unschooling philosophy<br/>
anyway.) That message is pervasive in society! But people do need to know<br/>
there are other options and how those options work in real families.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Folks on this group openly admit they have an arbitrary set<br/>
&gt; of &quot;guidelines&quot; that define unschooling and unless you adhere to them<br/>
&gt; 100%, you do not belong here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No arbitrary set of guidelines. We discuss here the philosophy of<br/>
unschooling, why it works, how it looks in real families.<br/>
<br/>
How it looks in each family is different, based on each families needs. It&#39;s<br/>
not arbitrary. But the philosophy is the same.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And before people start nodding, I&#39;ll ask this:<br/>
<br/>
Is discussing how to restrict children&#39;s access to something they want part<br/>
of the unschooling philosophy?<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean an unschooling family can&#39;t be organic vegans without TV<br/>
who wear only purple cowboy boots. But those are other philosophies pasted<br/>
on top of unschooling. Those are, in fact, limiting the unschooling<br/>
philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers can limit unschooling however they want. But asking the whole<br/>
philosophy for guidance in limiting the philosophy in ways that are counter<br/>
to the philosophy is to water the philosophy down.<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly that&#39;s getting read as &quot;this is unschooling&quot; and &quot;that isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling&quot; and people are thinking &quot;Who are you to say who is an<br/>
unschooler and who isn&#39;t and what unschoolers can and can&#39;t do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not saying that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about the *philosophy*, the *ideal*, the *idea*, the *concept*<br/>
of unschooling. The *thing* people look to to help them decide what course<br/>
is right for them.<br/>
<br/>
A life philosophy might be &quot;love one another as we love ourselves&quot;. Against<br/>
that we will weigh the decisions we make in life. Those who adhere to the<br/>
philosophy strictly will try to find a way to &quot;love&quot; a child abuser (eg,<br/>
love the innocent child that was damaged to create the abuser without<br/>
condoning their current actions or something like that). Those who don&#39;t<br/>
adhere strictly to the philosophy can still use it as a guiding principle<br/>
and adapt it when they feel necessary.<br/>
<br/>
But, if the philosophy is altered in order to allow something that&#39;s counter<br/>
to it&#39;s central issue, then discussion of it is only useful to those who<br/>
water it down the same way and useless to those who want the strict version.<br/>
<br/>
Love everyone except those who are trying to hurt us is not the same<br/>
philosophy at all. It&#39;s fundamentally changed in profound ways. The<br/>
philosophy&#39;s founders *knew* it was hard to love your enemies. They didn&#39;t<br/>
include &quot;except for enemies&quot; for a reason.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about a child having confidence to learn what they need to<br/>
learn from whatever interests them. It doesn&#39;t mean &quot;whatever interests<br/>
them, except for things mom doesn&#39;t like.&quot; Moms don&#39;t like lots of things.<br/>
Why couldn&#39;t it be Unschooling without going into cities? Or Unschooling<br/>
without plastic? Or Unschooling without unnatural foods?<br/>
<br/>
It *is* hard to unschool with TV or all terrain vehicles or pop culture if<br/>
those are counter to a parent&#39;s personal philosophy. But we shouldn&#39;t warp<br/>
the philosophy of unschooling so parents can feel comfortable practicing two<br/>
philosophies that conflict. Those conflicts are their responsibility to work<br/>
out, not the responsibility of the two (or three or more) philosophies.<br/>
