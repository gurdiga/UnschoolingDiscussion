<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Right now my oldest just wants to read his Garfield comic books or watch TV<br/>
&gt; or listen to the radio or play on the computer or go sledding.  ANYTHING,<br/>
&gt; but &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No workbooks unless your kids choose them out of the pile of workbooks,<br/>
sticker books, coloring books, etc.  Their choice, no rules about having to<br/>
do them or having to spend X minutes doing &quot;seatwork&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;ve told us to far is that your child is capable of reading, because<br/>
he can read Garfield.  He&#39;s choosing to learn things visually and orally<br/>
from radio and TV.  He is computer literate, and likes physical activity.<br/>
Toss our the concept of &quot;school&quot;, and you&#39;ll be unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
As far as what WE did today, let&#39;s see:<br/>
<br/>
My son is 6.  He played PacMan on his gameboy and beat the entire game on<br/>
the &quot;normal&quot; setting.  Very exciting for him.  I read email during that.<br/>
<br/>
We made breakfast together.  (Instant grits.  Not THAT exciting!)<br/>
<br/>
Tim had a l-o-n-g bath, I had a shower, and we got dressed.  He played with<br/>
his cars, and we repaired the broken one.  We spent some time working on his<br/>
new piano pieces, and he was thrilled to be able to play all the way through<br/>
a song using 2 hands together.  He read Calvin and Hobbs while I returned<br/>
phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
I made lunch, and we gulped it down and ran out the door.  (We had too much<br/>
fun this moring and were running late!)<br/>
<br/>
Ran 3 errands, including picking up our mail on post (we&#39;re military), and<br/>
HOORAY! our box finally came (29 days!) from BarnesandNoble.com.  A new<br/>
Calvin book, and 2 more Garfield.  Had to drive 45 miles to buy new tap<br/>
dancing shoes, so Tim read parts of his new books on the way.<br/>
<br/>
Bought the shoes, went to the ATM, went to the Pharmacy, went to get some<br/>
fried rice because Tim was &quot;starving&quot; again, and then to a friend&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
I taught my friend&#39;s son his cello lesson, and Tim read his current novel<br/>
(From the Mixed Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler), and then we stayed<br/>
for dinner, so the boys attempted to kill each other while my friend and I<br/>
cooked.  I think they called it wrestling, and everyone involved was<br/>
giggling.  We got regular reports from her little girl, so I stayed out of<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I went to church choir, and Tim stayed on there.  I&#39;m told he spent most of<br/>
the evening watching the other boy play a gameboy game.<br/>
<br/>
Typical day?  Well, usually we spend more time at home and less time running<br/>
errands.  But that&#39;s pretty typical.  Books, comics, gameboy, music,<br/>
something physical, toys, maybe a movie or something, some cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Does that help?<br/>
