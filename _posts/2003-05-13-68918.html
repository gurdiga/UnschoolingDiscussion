<div id="ygrps-yiv-1138885069">WARNING: This is a long one.....I need to vent. So far I&#39;ve been<br/>
pretty lucky when I tell people that we are homeschooling my DD Karen<br/>
(2 years). Of course, the only people I&#39;ve told have been family and<br/>
most of them totally agree with DH and myself. That all changed<br/>
today. :)<br/>
<br/>
My dd and I are part of a play group that meets every other week at<br/>
different parks in the area. I had mentioned a while back that we<br/>
were considering homeschooling Karen to one of the other mothers and<br/>
she seemed supportive, even offered to get me an email address of a<br/>
relative who is homeschooling. Today, she asked me if we had decided<br/>
for sure and, when I told her that we were going to be homeschooling,<br/>
she got sort of hostile. I couldn&#39;t believe it. I&#39;ve read about the<br/>
hostility that others have faced but, I guess I just didn&#39;t expect it<br/>
to come from anyone that I know personally.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s was a public school teacher before having her baby 2 years ago,<br/>
by the way. She started out asking me general questions about why we<br/>
didn&#39;t want to send Karen to public school and wanted to know how it<br/>
all work legally. Then, she started trying to convince me how great<br/>
the school district is that I live in and how her cousin really likes<br/>
the Elementary School that&#39;s just down the street from my house. When<br/>
I told her that, in California, you can be listed as a private school<br/>
and not have to report to the state and pretty much do you own thing.<br/>
That&#39;s when I could tell she got really hostile. She tried telling<br/>
me that I didn&#39;t know what I was talking about and that, even if that<br/>
was the case, I should still report in weekly with a district person<br/>
and have Karen tested periodically since I didn&#39;t want to deprive her<br/>
of learning and making sure she&#39;s on course! Excuse me?! THEN, she<br/>
started talking about the social aspect of not going to school. And,<br/>
I would want to be connected with a school, just in case Karen decided<br/>
that she wanted to join afterschool activities.<br/>
<br/>
When I told her that I was part of a homeschooling group here in town<br/>
that meets once a week, she started saying how they are probably all<br/>
&quot;hippie&quot; types who grow and eat their own food and &quot;that type of<br/>
thing.&quot; Even if they WERE all like that, which they aren&#39;t, what in<br/>
the hell is wrong with growing and eating your own fruits and<br/>
veggies?! That alone teaches kids a heck of a lot. I didn&#39;t even<br/>
tell her that we were planning on unschooling....can&#39;t imagine what<br/>
she would have said to that!<br/>
<br/>
The only nice thing she said about homeschooling was about her cousin,<br/>
the one who homeschools her kids. But, from what she said, that woman<br/>
has a school at home type setup which it totally the opposite of what<br/>
we&#39;re going to be doing. I guess I&#39;m so upset because this is a woman<br/>
that I really like and have been &quot;friends&quot; with for a while. I just<br/>
didn&#39;t expect it from her.<br/>
<br/>
Grrrrr,<br/>

she is a teacher.  Her anger comes from her own personal issues.<br/>

<br/>
I swear, some of these people who are suppose to the trained to deal with<br/>
kids know nothing.  A few weeks ago we had a Child protective worker tell us<br/>
all young kids need to attend school so that their learning habits can be<br/>
established in a correct manner.  She said by my pulling out my  8 and 6 yr<br/>
old from school due to the undo pressure they where both having put on them<br/>
to learn to read was &quot;giving&quot; up on my son.  I informed her I was not giving<br/>
up on him but saving his life from people like her who try to put all kids<br/>
in this little box with expectations that not all kids can or want to meet.<br/>
I also informed her all the &quot;special&quot; services she said the school had, had<br/>
been utilized and my son was behind &quot;when&quot; he left school, so obviously<br/>
their special programs did not work either.  The CPS worker was not<br/>
concerned about my older kids since their learning habits where already<br/>
there...like there was no hope for them now if they were behind type of<br/>
attitude.<br/>
<br/>
I will say my kids have never been happier since coming home and not needing<br/>
to do something they do not want or are not ready to do.<br/>

Take a deep breath Melissa and then let it all out. This is the first <br/>
negative homeschooling encounter you&#39;ve had, but it probably won&#39;t be <br/>
the last unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
Think of your &quot;friend&quot; like a mama bear protecting her young. In this <br/>

up her young. You CAN&#39;T be right in your choice, because then she <br/>

Let it go. It&#39;s not worth the negative energy to hold onto it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511130863">Mary, <br/>
You are absolutly right and, as soon as I had vented in this post, I<br/>
felt a lot better.  Especially once I realized that by attacking my<br/>
choice, she validated hers.  But, I KNOW that my DH and I are doing<br/>
what is right and best for us and have no doubts about homeschooling.<br/>
 I just wish that others would realize that, my saying I&#39;m<br/>
homeschooling, does not mean that I&#39;m saying they are bad parents for<br/>
sending their kids to public schools.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, you are right and I do not need or want that negative energy<br/>
around me and my family and have let it go.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722992074">Florida has the same sort of program.  I can&#39;t remember the exact <br/>
name..something before 5.  I worked extensively with preschools and I <br/>
can honestly say most of them just plain SUCK.  It was horrible.  I <br/>
used to go in and help train preschool teachers, moniter schools so <br/>
they could get approved for subsidized kids, etc.   Really, what sort <br/>
of quality do you expect for $6 and hour??  What amazed me the most <br/>
was how dirty and cramped and closed in these schools were and yet <br/>
their enrollment was full.  These schools were in no was supplying <br/>
the information that all these government programs are *hoping* they <br/>
do.  Seeing all that made me certain my kids would not sit in <br/>
preschool all day.  In fact, I used to be amazed at the *affluent* <br/>
parents who thought if they sent their kids to the *affluent* school <br/>
in town they were guarenteed success.  I have been inside them and <br/>
they spend more money on their playgrounds and flooring then their <br/>
teachers.<br/>
<br/>
I know in FLorida, they are discussing making preschool mandatory so <br/>
every child has that *learning experience*!  I am not sure if this is <br/>
nation wide because of is really late and my son is sick and I cannot <br/>
remember! LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-122397465">My understanding of the very first Head Start program is that they enrolled<br/>
the parents in classes to teach them basic nutrition, money management, job<br/>
skills, parenting skills.  The kids did perform better, because the program<br/>
improved their family life, not because they learned the alphabet earlier.<br/>
These were families that really did need help.  They were not middle income<br/>
families in the suburbs.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, the success of that program has been twisted to push for early<br/>
preschool for all kids.  Most families are quite capable of providing young<br/>
children what they really need - a loving, nurturing, interesting<br/>
environment.<br/>

whether the Head Start<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah---and they desperately need to make jobs for all those early childhood <br/>
ed graduates they are pushing through system!<br/>
<br/>
When we were kids, they didn&#39;t even HAVE early childhood education classes, <br/>
did they? Wasn&#39;t that just the M.O.M. degree?<br/>

&lt;&lt; My understanding of the very first Head Start program is that they enrolled<br/>
<br/>
the parents in classes to teach them basic nutrition, money management, job<br/>
<br/>
skills, parenting skills.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Head Start was one of the &quot;Title Programs,&quot; federal funding programs for <br/>
education called things like &quot;Title IX&quot; and I used to know what several of <br/>
them were but have closed off that part of trivia retrieval these days.<br/>
<br/>
In the 60s, few states required kindergarten.  It was optional and usually <br/>
not free.  So it was something families with money provided kids as an intro <br/>
to school before the required first grade.<br/>
<br/>
Head start was kindergarten for poor families.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of states started making kindergarten mandatory, part of compulsory <br/>
education, and providing it in and at elementary schools.    <br/>
<br/>
In those places,  head start backed up to four year olds, to get them ready <br/>
for kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
There might have been an  accompanying program for parents, but Head Start <br/>
itself had to do with programs for &quot;underprivilieged&quot; kids in the year before <br/>
compulsory education.<br/>

such as *Early Childhood* and *Head Start* (I was in our city&#39;s pilot <br/>
programs by age 2) simply because they removed me from my home and exposed me <br/>
to normal childhood stuff in a safe and clean environment.  I succeeded <br/>
because I was allowed to.  I&#39;m glad it&#39;s there for the kids who need it & I&#39;m <br/>

Maybe I&#39;m getting my First Ladies mixed up here, but I thought it was <br/>
Mrs. Nixon who created/started Head Start, as her Pet Project when <br/>
she was first lady. Richard Nixon was Pres. in 1970-1973 (the year he <br/>
resigned, right?) which would put the Head Start program in late <br/>
60&#39;s. Unless it already existed, and Pat (?) Nixon was the one who <br/>
pushed it back to the pre-K age. <br/>
<br/>
I started Kindergarten in 1966 and it was offered free in Utah. Well <br/>
established, everyone-goes-to-K-when-they-are-five offered. May even <br/>
have been mandatory in UT by &#39;66.<br/>
