<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know, the false idea that &quot;unschoolers have no bedtimes&quot;  <br/>
came from things I wrote years ago when we were sharing one computer  <br/>
and one dial-up internet connection, and I didn&#39;t mind Kirby staying  <br/>
up late to be on the internet, and Keith and I, as a part of our  <br/>
hobby (SCA) very often had our children with us late at night, doing  <br/>
cool things.<br/>
<br/>
And when we were home, instead of &quot;having a bedtime,&quot; I would nurse  <br/>
the baby to sleep at some point, and the older child wold fall asleep  <br/>
in Keith&#39;s lap, or lying next to me on the couch, or something.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby didn&#39;t sleep as much as the others, when he was little, and  <br/>
sometimes (even pre-computer) I would get up with him and set him up  <br/>
with a long video tape and some food, go back to sleep.  Our house  <br/>
was very small, and he would be quiet because the others were sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
When people asked questions about the problems the were having with  <br/>
bedtimes, I would tell those stories as possible options.  Years  <br/>
passed, and it seemed to become &quot;part of unschooling.&quot;     I think of  <br/>
it more as respect for children and a lack of arbitrary rules.<br/>
<br/>
If sleep has a purpose, that should be the focus.  Safety, comfort  <br/>
and rest, not control and schedules.  From La Leche Leagues&#39;s  <br/>
recommendation of letting childen sleep with parents, we had children  <br/>
who liked to sleep.  Sleeping was good, and fun, and desireable.   <br/>
They were never put in a room along and commanded to be quiet and sleep.<br/>
<br/>
So for a family that has been doing that (&quot;go to sleep; it&#39;s 8:00&quot;),  <br/>
it&#39;s worth them thinking about why and whether there are options.   <br/>
And lately I hear more often of people saying things like &quot;I told my  <br/>
kids we were unschooling and now there are no bedtimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are principles at work here.  Children should feel safe and  <br/>
make choices.  Parents should do things for good and sensible  <br/>
reasons, not for arbitrary or kneejerk reasons.<br/>
<br/>
If children are made to eat when they&#39;re not hungry, and forbidden to  <br/>
eat when they are hungry, that&#39;s either arbitrary or cruel.  Trying  <br/>
to &quot;put children on a schedule&quot; with eating makes sense in a culture  <br/>
in which meals are formal and there&#39;s no real way to get food between  <br/>
meals, or in a culture in which children are to learn they&#39;re small  <br/>
and unimportant.<br/>
<br/>
The same thoughts can be put onto sleep.  There are situations in  <br/>
which sleeping at certain times are necessary for safety (war zones,  <br/>
jungles, dormitories where several people share a room...)  but when  <br/>
there are locked houses with electric lights and safe things to do,  <br/>
and when it&#39;s possible for a child to sleep safely and comfortably  <br/>
even when the sun is up, then there might be other considerations.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People of any age can learn to listen to their bodies about hunger,  <br/>
thirst, needs for rest, etc.  But they can&#39;t listen if someone else  <br/>
is telling them whether they are or should be eating, drinking,  <br/>
sleeping, or not.  Learning to know ourselves is useful for other  <br/>
learning, but it is not in and of itself &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a simple subject, and it&#39;s one I&#39;m not personally clear  <br/>
on.  It&#39;s hard to explain how it ties in with unschooling.  I know  <br/>
how our kids have grown and how good they are now at getting up when  <br/>
they need to and sleeping when they need to (Holly got herself up  <br/>
this morning at 7:30 to take me to a dentist&#39;s appointment involving  <br/>
sedation--she drove and waited and brought me home).<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s not clear is how and whether other families can or should move  <br/>
in that direction.  All of a sudden is not the way, though.  And &quot;a  <br/>
rule&quot; that there can be no bedtime is the extreme opposite that there  <br/>
Must be a certain by-the-clock bedtime.  It&#39;s just replacing one rule  <br/>
with another rule instead of examining particular ideas and exceptions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-678870028">One of the biggest conflicts surrounding bedtimes here is brainstorming for<br/>
ideas of how to fit family time around Brian&#39;s hectic work schedule.  He is<br/>
off on a different day each week and every 4 or 5 weeks he gets 4 days off<br/>
in a row.  The rest of the time he is off to work in the wee hours and back<br/>
home about 7 or 7:30, at which point he may collapse for a nap or go to bed<br/>
early (depending on how tired he is).  It&#39;s an awful schedule and not one<br/>
that can be changed easily without also changing jobs.  He&#39;s been at this<br/>
job for several years now... close to 10.  Sometimes I feel like it&#39;s just<br/>
impossible to have time together and we all need it.  Brian seems to think<br/>
if I make Karl have an earlier bedtime like 8 or 9 or so, then it would all<br/>
be much better for family time.  He may be right.<br/>
<br/>
I would like any suggestions that people can dream up.<br/>

===============================================<br/>
Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I read something you posted last night about sleep and started to  <br/>
respond.  I decided to sit on those thoughts and to read my words  <br/>
again in the morning before posting.  I was surprised to see this  <br/>
morning that you words had changed.   It appears that you rethought  <br/>
what you wrote and edited your post?  I suppose you�re able to do  <br/>
that as the group administrator.  That seems dishonest to me,  <br/>
especially since I have read many of your posts telling others to  <br/>
consider their words before hitting send.  I guess it just changes my  <br/>
view of you as *always* eloquent and certain of your words and lowers  <br/>
you to human status. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you will discuss with me some of your original comments,  <br/>
because I found them thought provoking.  You may bring this back to  <br/>
the list and quote me (within context, of course) if you choose.  I  <br/>
just didn�t want to call you out on the word changes publicly.<br/>

started to cut and paste pieces of what you wrote, and I�m not sure  <br/>
how it goes back together.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; What&#39;s not clear is how and whether other families can or should move<br/>
 &gt; in that direction.  All of a sudden is not the way, though.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If a family was moving towards unschooling and had previously limited  <br/>
or otherwise controlled food, would you suggest that they ease out of  <br/>
controlling food rather than stop controlling all of a sudden?  Just  <br/>
curious. I don�t think it would necessarily be harmful to suddenly  <br/>
stop the control or scheduling (of food or sleep or anything else) as  <br/>
long as the parents provided some guidance rather than left children  <br/>
floundering and confused.<br/>
<br/>
  And &quot;a<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m having trouble understanding that first sentence, because it  <br/>
seems to me that any bed*time* is a by-the-clock bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
I see tiredness as similar to hunger or thirst, therefore attempting  <br/>
to control someone&#39;s sleep would be similar to attempting to control  <br/>
someone&#39;s eating or drinking. That control doesn�t seem to fit with  <br/>
the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I provide some guidance to Quinn regarding her food intake and  <br/>
sleep.  I try to supply a variety of foods including proteins for her  <br/>
throughout the day. If she has been too busy playing to eat and  <br/>
starts getting cranky, I&#39;ll suggest that a snack might help her feel  <br/>
better.  If we&#39;re planning to meet friends in the morning and it&#39;s  <br/>
getting late, I&#39;ll suggest going to sleep to be well rested for play  <br/>
the next day.  She is 3 years old and so far she&#39;s a fairly picky  <br/>
eater and a night owl. &lt;g&gt;  Thus far it has not worked out that Quinn  <br/>
likes sleep even though we have always co-slept and continue to  <br/>
nurse.  She does take naps and goes to sleep at night as she gets  <br/>
tired sometimes.  More often she seems to like play more than sleep.   <br/>
She often seems to will herself awake playing while her eyes are  <br/>
almost closing.  She stays up until the wee hours of the morning  <br/>
fairly regularly even though we have some relaxed getting ready for  <br/>
bed routines, make the house quiet, and turn the lights low or  <br/>
sometimes play hard to burn off some energy.  I trust as she gets  <br/>
older she will be better able to recognize her body&#39;s cues.  Perhaps  <br/>
she will choose to be well nourished and rested and/or she might  <br/>
choose to delay sleeping or eating to enjoy a video game, a good  <br/>
book, a lover, or anything else she chooses.  The engaged trust and  <br/>
respect for her autonomy are how I see this fitting into  <br/>
unschooling.  It�s the non-coercive/ consensual living/ attentive  <br/>
parenting piece of the radical/whole life unschooling philosophy.   <br/>
Would you agree?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your time, work, and dedication to unschooling.  I have  <br/>
learned and continue to learn so much from your list and website!   <br/>
They both have helped me move closer to being the parent I want to be.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m not the person who wrote that email but I have certainly dreamed things<br/>

that a list owner could edit their posts.  In some forums other than Yahoo<br/>
you *can* do that.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the SEND button is forever, sometimes it&#39;s not.  In RUN you have a<br/>
15 minute delay to edit your discussion posts which is perfect for catching<br/>
those &quot;oh darn&quot; spellos and such.  I&#39;ve noticed that comments and discussion<br/>
posts can be altogether deleted.  You can delete posts in Yahoo but people<br/>
like me who get posts sent to my inbox will have gotten a copy, yeh... so<br/>
lots of people will have seen whatever comes out of the infamous SEND<br/>
button.<br/>

  kids here too.<br/>
<br/>
  It is a pretty awesome game and they seem to have a lot of fun but the old<br/>
  voices are creeping into my head and I wonder how long this will last? Even<br/>
  if I could get a turn, the game is just beyond me, but I try. I must be<br/>
  getting realllllly old cause im finding it hard to keep up with technology<br/>
  lately. im just putting food within their reach and hangin back.<br/>

Oh yeah.<br/>
<br/>
And yesterday I had an early morning dentist&#39;s appointment involving  <br/>
stupifying drugs, and came home and slept for hours, until Holly woke  <br/>
me up to take her to a consultation for having her wisdom teeth out.   <br/>
We went to lunch, Marty and Brett came to meet us, and I ended up  <br/>
having words with Holly and refusing her company.  I drove myself  <br/>
home (probably shouldn&#39;t have), and went to sleep until 8:30 or so,  <br/>
did stuff, checked e-mail, was still sleepy and went back to bed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad I did no worse than posting something I should&#39;ve deleted.   <br/>
I HOPE I did no worse.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I took such drugs, I was working on a post when they kicked  <br/>
in and wrote some gibberish.  I spelled beautiful &quot;beaufle&quot; or some  <br/>
such.<br/>

Sorry to all, again.<br/>

Kirby played it a LOT and now works for the company that owns it,  <br/>
which is also now owned by the company that does Guitar Hero.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a boyfriend who is the head of a guild that raids four  <br/>
times a week (this is some high-level play) and he works his schedule  <br/>
around those sessions, which range from two to five hours long  <br/>
(Sunday there&#39;s an officers meeting after the raid).  He told me  <br/>
today that Holly&#39;s the first person in his life who&#39;s been accepting  <br/>
and supportive of his WoW activity.  I told him she goes around the  <br/>
house telling us not to download, not to watch videos, to be quiet. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Up until a few weeks ago, he used to go to the house where he lived  <br/>
with other friends to play WoW, but now he&#39;s moved his computer over  <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things contribute to our acceptance of a hobby like that:<br/>
<br/>
1) our experience with Kirby<br/>
<br/>
2) the fact that Keith has played SCA for thirty two years or so, and  <br/>
that takes WAY more time and money than World of Warcraft, involves  <br/>
driving to other states and camping and getting physically hurt.   <br/>
There are pros to SCA activity (exercise, music, food), but we do  <br/>
understand obsession with projects, and the joy of leading groups  <br/>
(whether in melees or wars or feast preparation or madrigal singing).<br/>

while she was up alone were when she was next to me on the couch while<br/>
we&#39;re watching television.  I&#39;m only comfortable doing that when I<br/>
know she is very tired and because I&#39;m a light sleeper.  Watching a<br/>
movie does work for us sometimes when she wants to watch television. <br/>
I find The Documentary Channel works well for inducing sleep in Quinn<br/>
if she&#39;s too tired to care what we&#39;re watching. <br/>

Yes it is a very in depth game.  Lots of fun stuff to do and figure out :)   You and your kids may love it or you may not.  We&#39;ve had friends who have played and loved it and we&#39;ve also had some friends who just dabble in it a bit and then move onto something else.<br/>
<br/>
Our family still plays, mostly my son who is in a raiding guild, which means he gets together with his guild usually about 4 nights a week and does group instances.  Like what Sandra said Holly&#39;s boyfriend does.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to give a head&#39;s up to people who are interested in playing or checking it out.  Right now they&#39;re having a referral special,  I believe you can get a 10 day free trial, from someone who is already playing.  They have some nice bonuses for the beginner and for the person who did the referral.  Details are here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml">https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/index.xml</a><br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I bought a PMP (portable media player) for our son about a year ago.  It&#39;s a<br/>
Cowon A2, similar to a video ipod but more functionality, and I convert all<br/>
of his favorite TiVo recordings and DVD&#39;s to avi files and have it loaded up<br/>
with them.  It&#39;s awesome for car and plane rides (no hassling with discs,<br/>
10+ hours of battery for video).  He&#39;s 3.5 y/o now, and we all cosleep, and<br/>
at least a couple nights a week he takes it to bed with him.  There&#39;s a<br/>
Sleep Timer on it that I can set for 60 minutes, since he&#39;s usually asleep<br/>
before that, and the device shuts itself off.  It takes a little time (30<br/>
mins of elapsed converting time on the computer, not 30 mins of effort) to<br/>
put a new show on the player, so we still have the occasional brand new TiVo<br/>
recording that&#39;s not yet on his player and he wants to stay up late to watch<br/>
it, but that&#39;s pretty rare.  And when it happens, usually I&#39;ll just cuddle<br/>
up on a chaise with him and watch it too, or have my laptop handy and do<br/>
something else while he watches.  Recently he started preferring to use<br/>
headphones so the sound from the PMP in bed doesn&#39;t bother us at all (even<br/>
without the headphones, he&#39;s happy with very low volume in a dark/quiet<br/>
bedroom).<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never had an imposed bedtime in our house, trusting since his birth<br/>
that he&#39;ll simply sleep when he&#39;s sleepy.  Yes we have to nudge him<br/>
sometimes when he&#39;s yawning and tired and a little cranky but wanting to do<br/>
One More Thing.  We just say we&#39;re tired and start moving toward<br/>
tooth-brushing and other nightly routines, and he&#39;ll start gathering up his<br/>
favorite toys (and PMP, just in case) to take to bed with him.  Usually he<br/>
wants to carry more toys to bed than his arms will hold, so asks us for help<br/>
since he doesn&#39;t want to make multiple trips down the hall.  So part of<br/>
pre-bed routine is me spreading out a towel on the living room floor for him<br/>
to load the toys so I can make an easy-to-carry bundle.<br/>
<br/>
Bedtimes also look different in our house Mon-Wed than the rest of the week,<br/>
since I&#39;m often out of town on those nights for business.  He and mom<br/>
usually go to bed about 9pm (especially recently since she&#39;s 8 months<br/>
pregnant).  Thurs-Sun (and other nights if I&#39;m home) she goes to bed around<br/>
9 or 10, but I&#39;m up until midnight or 1.  And he makes his own decision,<br/>
which usually involves settling in with mom but then coming out a half hour<br/>
later to see if I&#39;m doing anything interesting, then back to bed with her.<br/>
And sometimes he falls asleep in the office or living room with me, and<br/>
other times stays up with me super-late.  When we have to get up super-early<br/>
for something, it usually involves a car ride so if he hasn&#39;t slept enough<br/>
he&#39;ll just nap in the car.  And if he slept less than 9 or 10 hours the<br/>
night before, he&#39;ll usually take a 2-hour nap mid-day.  We sometimes<br/>
encourage a nap by settling him on the couch with a video and snack, but<br/>
usually we just notice a sudden calm in the house and will find him asleep<br/>
on the floor in the hall or living room.  There&#39;s no drama about sleep in<br/>
our house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399302989">Brad&#39;s ideas are GREAT, and of course modern technology beats the  <br/>
heck out of what I had in the late 80&#39;s when Kirby was little.<br/>
<br/>
Holly could listen to a CD in the bed and that was good.  Marty used  <br/>
to listen to one certain cassette tape, intended for drawing pictures  <br/>
of circus scenes.  He wouldn&#39;t last ten minutes.  But the bad thing  <br/>
about cassette players is they&#39;re noisy when they turn off.<br/>
<br/>
We drove Kirby to sleep many times.  And both Kirby and Marty have  <br/>
often fallen asleep on the floor next to where I was working on the  <br/>
computer, just to be near me.  When Holly was a baby I had a job at  <br/>
home that involved phone calls and lots of writing, and it was nice  <br/>
that they could still be leaning on me or touching me or playing  <br/>
where I was.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chamille had a cassette tape that we&#39;d put on auto flip, so that it<br/>
would go indefinitely until we went and turned it off.  It was always<br/>
the same cassette, or usually the same one.  There were 3 that she would<br/>
fall asleep to, one was called Slumber Land, one was called Sidewalk<br/>
Stories, which had some lively parts so wasn&#39;t something that worked all<br/>
the time, and one was a tape by Penguin Cafe Orchestra, which worked<br/>
best for naps rather than night time.<br/>
<br/>
Sleep patterns are so fleeting though.  It seems they change all the<br/>
time.  In my experience, once we establish some sort of sleep pattern,<br/>
it changes because life changes.  Chamille was an awesome sleeper when<br/>
she was little, there was never any trouble with her falling asleep, now<br/>
she will stay up all night sometimes and sleep all day.  Margaux has<br/>
always been difficult with sleep, even as a tiny baby.  She never took<br/>
naps except for the occasional falling asleep while nursing, she almost<br/>
never fell asleep in the car, nor would she stay asleep if she was moved<br/>
either out of my nursing arms or out of her car seat, etc.  She has<br/>
always gravitated to having her sleep pattern be what others in the<br/>
house are, so if I stay up late, she will, if I go to bed early she will<br/>
do what is lively with the other members of our family.  Sleep seems to<br/>
be low on her priority, and she doesn&#39;t seem to need as much as most<br/>
kids her age (6).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something that we are ever trying to work with.  It can be hard to<br/>
never ever have a time when I or my husband are not on call as a parent,<br/>
but it is what it is, so we try to make it as fun and joyful as<br/>
possible.  It would be great if Margaux would just go to sleep<br/>
sometimes!  We try to have a bedtime routine, but sometimes that doesn&#39;t<br/>
happen until after midnight because to do it before that would be met<br/>
with conflict.  We use movies a LOT to help her fall asleep, because it<br/>
allows her to stay awake as long as she wants, but in a sleep conducive<br/>
atmoshpere.  She will almost always watch the whole movie and want<br/>
another.    I often fall asleep before her.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92170732">Though we&#39;re new to unschooling philosophy (short of 3 years), this<br/>
idea of sleep as some thing to control is foreign to us.  I think that<br/>
like sandra, it must sort of flow naturally from the cosleeping<br/>
aspect...I had read The Continuum Concept, but I dont recall anything<br/>
specific about &quot;no sleep rules&quot; there.<br/>
<br/>
The rare occations that a small child wants to be up later than the<br/>
rest of us, I usually keep him company--we go outside to see what it<br/>
is like, we get a drink of milk andor a bite to eat.  Last night<br/>
Gioele my 2.75yo fell asleep early-6pmish and wanted to eat at<br/>
midnight: in the end milk was enough for him but we piggybacked out of<br/>
bed, and had the snack irregardless of the hour.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly we go to sleep at a regular 10:30ish time, and we all spend<br/>
some time together after eating talking, watching a video or I will<br/>
read a story out loud: my 10 year old Raffi will still beg me to read<br/>
rather than watch a video, and my 14yo Matteo still will join in to<br/>
listen on our bed...Naps too, they just happen when they happen, not<br/>
when I decide they are needed. I tend to nap every afternoon, but not<br/>
always my children do: they are very careful to be quiet, though at<br/>
times they do forget in their excitement.  And sometimes my children<br/>
nap and I do not...and I am just as careful to be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
I dont know, its all a rather natural flowing sort of thing. <br/>
<br/>
I guess it is much like strewing or the concept of unschooling--forced<br/>
learning is not *really* learning- it is a travesty of learning, for<br/>
the children end up &quot;doing the learning&quot; for the wrong reasons (fear<br/>
of punishment, or desire for the carrot)--<br/>
<br/>
forced sleeping just doesnt make sense: it isnt really sleeping I<br/>
would think--okay Im babbling, so im off for now!<br/>

can see that with some of her friends and families, things are more<br/>
mellow and focused on older kid activities with less direct involvement<br/>
from the parents.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really strive for less direct involvment.  However it would be<br/>
nice, and I think about the future days when I don&#39;t have to accompany<br/>
my younger child to the bathroom.  I will probably miss all the hubbub<br/>
once she&#39;s older though!<br/>
<br/>
That is why I breathe deep and put a smile on my face and just do for<br/>
her because it doesn&#39;t last forever.  The little act changes my focus to<br/>
being attentive lovingly.  If I forget, I go with a grudge sometimes and<br/>
that&#39;s no good for anyone!<br/>

I don&#39;t need to drive my kids anywhere anymore.  Yesterday I was  <br/>
going to drive.  Holly and I were going shopping for (brace  <br/>
yourselves) a strapless bra for her to wear to a wedding.  And I  <br/>
needed to send some copies of Moving a Puddle... it was post office  <br/>
day.  I was going to drive because our car was in front of another  <br/>
car and it took a tricky maneuver.<br/>
<br/>
Tricky maneuver failed.  The car wouldn&#39;t start at all.  So Holly  <br/>
went to ask if she could borrow her boyfriend&#39;s car which is a climb- <br/>
up-into-it SUV, and so she drove and I rode.<br/>
<br/>
And I used to change her diapers and carry her around and wipe her  <br/>
face and tie her shoes.<br/>
<br/>
I miss those days.  I will miss these days someday.<br/>
