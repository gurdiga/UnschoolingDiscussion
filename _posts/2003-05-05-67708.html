<div id="ygrps-yiv-555020185">Thanks to those that suggested I go back to Dreher Park Zoo. We spent 5 hours there today and the kids had a blast. That fountain was great. Alyssa didn&#39;t venture in but was happy to eat and watch everyone else. Joseph and Sierra had tons of fun. We did the zoo twice, once before they were wet and once after to dry off. It was a great day. We&#39;re getting a family membership.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1426802164">Hey Mary,<br/>
<br/>
If you can ever get over there early &lt;g&gt;, let me know and we will <br/>
meet you.  I just can&#39;t handle the drive home close to rush hour.  I <br/>
like to be home by 2 or so.  Maybe we can meet halfway through, <br/>
around 11:30 or so, and we can do part of the zoo?<br/>
<br/>
Also, can you give me some information on who you are registered with <br/>
for homschooling??  We don&#39;t have t register til next year but I <br/>
figure that gives me this time to figure everything out!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
Olga :)<br/>
