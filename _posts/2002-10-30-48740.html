<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923946523"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;It is tempting to think of unschooling as turning everyday life into a <br/>

<br/>
  and<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;A corollary is that <br/>
 </span></blockquote>  everything counts - you can facilitate learning in any direction they want <br/>
  to go, learning anything and everything in any way, and one thing leads to <br/>
  another and over years of living a life filled with that kind of support, <br/>
  they will learn what they need to learn to live the life they want to live.<br/>
  I&#39;m not quite sure how one facilitates learning without creating a teachable moment??<br/>
<br/>
  For example when I cook, I ask if my five and two year old wants to help, I then cook out loud. That is certainly creating  a teachable moment and you&#39;r saying that is not unschooling??<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m wondering about Africa. A group of children that were never taught, and they can&#39;t read or write?? Off course they can do other things, which they learned from their parents. But I need my children to at least learn to read and write, well actually a lot more than that. Will they learn that, without me creating teachable moments, just because their parents do that and they would want to do it too??<br/>

<br/>
Do you &quot;cook out loud&quot; in a teacherish voice, asking them questions to see<br/>
what they&#39;ve learned?  Or do you just talk about what you&#39;re doing and<br/>
whatever they seem interested in at the time?  The first one isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling.  The second one is.<br/>

<br/>
If you live way out in the bush somewhere, and they never see books, and you<br/>
don&#39;t have any around, and you don&#39;t ever read, they probably won&#39;t learn to<br/>
read.  Otherwise, they will.  The timing might surprise you, but they&#39;ll<br/>
learn.<br/>
