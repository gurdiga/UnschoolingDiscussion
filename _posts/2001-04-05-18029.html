<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410907037"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;My sister, who arranged to have playground duty <br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
that we could stay through recess, finally told me<br/>
that she was very <br/>
much in<br/>
favor of schooling your children at home, whether you<br/>
home or <br/>
un-school.<br/>
This is coming from a public school teacher! &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was a public high school teacher for 11 years.<br/>
*MANY* teachers approve of homeschooling (and in fact<br/>
plan to do it when they have kids) because they are<br/>
there in the trenches, they see what&#39;s going on, they<br/>
know more than anyone wants to know about how most<br/>
kids suffer in school.How much time is wasted. How the<br/>
beauracracy of it all is nonsensical. How litte<br/>
learning goes on. How frustrating it feels to be an<br/>
underpaid babysitter of far too many kids at a time.<br/>
<br/>
See, when you decide to become a teacher, you&#39;re<br/>
usually very idealistic. You want to help youth. You<br/>
usually have an altruistic, nurturing spirit. You know<br/>
that you&#39;ll be the best teacher ever. Then you get<br/>
there, and you see the sadness of the<br/>
abused/neglected/traumatized kids, you see how the<br/>
system doesn&#39;t work for any of them, you learn that<br/>
life in a public school is like one giant Dilbert<br/>
comic. But  many stay. Not because they believe in the<br/>
system. They stay because they STILL love kids, and<br/>
they want to be there for them even though it means<br/>
fighting a losing battle. To leave, for them, would<br/>
mean giving up on those kids they love. They learn to<br/>
come home and cry rather than bang their heads against<br/>
the wall in front of the students.<br/>
<br/>
I could talk about this all day, but I already used<br/>
far more than my fair share of your attention with my<br/>
story about my daughter. <br/>

It is very inspiring and encouraging to be reminded on a regular basis<br/>
why it is we are choosing to home/un-school.  For those days when we may<br/>
be vulnerable to self-doubt, please share some of your stories<br/>
periodically.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
