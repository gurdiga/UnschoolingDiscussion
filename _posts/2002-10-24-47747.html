&lt;&lt; I would be interested too. Where do I send my dollar????  Also, was it<br/>
 taped? If so do you know how I could get a copy and the cost?<br/>
 thanks for sharing this, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want a copy of the handout, just email me your address. I will only <br/>
start charging if a lot of people want it. I can afford to mail a few without <br/>
stress :)<br/>
LeAanne should have our website up and running very soon, I will post the <br/>
link here as soon as it&#39;s ready.<br/>
We will have links to unschooling information, essays and articles, ideas and <br/>
recipes for fun also.<br/>
But the conference workshop handout thingy, is simply a list of ways to use <br/>
things like boxes, newspaper and other common household items to make some <br/>
fun or games.<br/>
