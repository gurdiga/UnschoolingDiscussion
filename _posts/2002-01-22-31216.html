<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937993957">response from a friend about that medical warning I sent earlier:<br/>
(sorry)<br/>
This is true but really old--this hit the airwaves--traditional media <br/>
as well as internet and print-- last summer.  I doubt you&#39;ll find <br/>
anything on the shelves with this ingredient any more!<br/>
