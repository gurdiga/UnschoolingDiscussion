<br/>
There are people who practically make a religion out of wanting to be that <br/>
family.   There&#39;s a homeschooling industy built up around it, and there&#39;s a <br/>
Wilder museum and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
   Little Joe and Charles Ingalls (TV version) have been good models for lots <br/>
of boys becoming men, I think.   I think he did a good job in a lot of ways <br/>
on those characters.   And I think in some ways his portrayal of and vision of <br/>
Little House on the Prairie will have a more lasting benefit than the books <br/>
themselves, so if they&#39;re belt-whipping things, that will fade into being <br/>
archaic and shocking.   Sooner than later, I hope.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348049388">It was &#39;The Loneliest Runner&#39;.  I remember it well and<br/>
could relate on more than a few levels.  I have a<br/>
great fondness and respect for Michael Landon.  When<br/>
he died, I was so very sad.  That movie sticks in my<br/>
head, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479425865">My kids have actually been watching the Michael Landon series, not the new<br/>
one. The comparing-herself-to-Mary thing is actually much stronger in the TV<br/>
series than in the books. It seems largely a color-of-hair issue -- I also<br/>
see it as something very much internally driven. When adults are brought<br/>
into the issue in the book, they talk about liking brown hair just as much.<br/>
I do think that Mary fit in better to the late 1800s version of what a young<br/>
woman should be like -- quiet and self-effacing and a hard, patient worker<br/>
-- Laura was livelier. I would suspect there was some shaming behavior<br/>
happening outside the pages of the book, but I also see in my own children,<br/>
esp. the close-in-age girls, that they compare each other without my<br/>
assistance! For instance, the 7yo has noticed that the 3yo&#39;s hair grows much<br/>
longer and thicker than her own -- and also that the 3yo&#39;s hair seems to be<br/>
darkening much faster than her own.<br/>
<br/>
(I have read a lot about the Ingalls family history because I loved the<br/>
books when I was a child, and it&#39;s interesting to note that by most people&#39;s<br/>
standards, Laura was very pretty while Mary was plain. One biography talks<br/>
about how shocked Ma had been when Pa had wanted her for a wife since he was<br/>
considered a handsome &quot;catch&quot; and she was not.)<br/>
<br/>
The Landon show can show a lot of nastiness between Nellie Oleson and Laura.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did the new show include the scene from the book where Pa beats Laura with a<br/>
&gt; belt? Does the show include the endless misery that Laura feels all through<br/>
&gt; her childhood from constantly being compared to Mary, her lack of self<br/>
&gt; esteem and belief in her own &quot;badness&quot;? Did they show Ma&#39;s rigidity and<br/>
&gt; controlling nature - not to mention racism? What a shock I got when I read<br/>
&gt; the whole series (that I picked up from a vendor last year&#39;s Conference at a<br/>
&gt; great bargain) since it had always been touted as a &quot;wonderful&quot; example of<br/>
&gt; parenting and home schooling. Maybe *in comparison* to the standards of the<br/>
&gt; time. I consider those books to be historical documents giving interesting<br/>
&gt; information about how people lived, and the unremitting physical labor they<br/>
&gt; undertook, but as a treatise on gentle parenting (as I had been told) - no.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it definitely would be shocking if you were expecting contemporary<br/>
&quot;gentle parenting.&quot; My guess is that the family life is rather sweet and<br/>
gentle -- for the 1870s and 1880s or even the first have of the 20th century<br/>
when the books came out. It&#39;s also scary, though, to think about how<br/>
contemporary parents who see this family as gentle are treating their own<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
The racism aspect in the books was something my 9yo and I have discussed<br/>
from a historical perspective as well as regarding what it means in the<br/>
context of how we are to view Ma. Ma is no model of perfection, and that<br/>
both works with his experience with his own parents and is something we talk<br/>
about with regard to other people. We don&#39;t have to like everything someone<br/>
does to like them as people or to love them as family members. Ma definitely<br/>
isn&#39;t perfectly virtuous, esp. by contemporary standards.<br/>
