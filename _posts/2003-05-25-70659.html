LLL actually has some pendants/charms you can order on the site.  Here is a link.  Did you try searching the web?  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen others somewhere if you don&#39;t see something you like here.<br/>

  I don&#39;t suppose you sell, or know where I could get, a charm with some kind of mother/baby thing on it (NOT a baby bottle or pacifier, or baby buggy, which seems to be all I can find). I would like to find something that looks like the LLL logo (mom cradling baby). <br/>
