<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887568267">Jaiden sounds like he is very verbal and smart little boy.  He is obviously<br/>
able to see things clearly as they are, as evidenced by his reply to his<br/>
rude step-grandma&#39;s mean comment.  (Go Jaiden!)<br/>
<br/>
My son Demetrius often holds his own when it comes to an injustice, no<br/>
matter who the adult is.  I think it is a wonderful and necessary thing to<br/>
be able to stick up for yourself, and to have a quick mind that can grasp<br/>
social situations and verbalize discomfort.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, your scenario of an adult family member demeaning a child is<br/>
all too familiar to me.  At some of our extended family dinners (depending<br/>
on the guest list), my son has made appropriate responses to rude adult<br/>
remarks - well, I think they are appropriate!  But if I&#39;m not privy to what<br/>
is happening, he often is chastised by other adults for speaking &quot;back to an<br/>
adult who loves him.&quot;  If I&#39;m in the room I can clarify that he IS<br/>
responding to a remark made TO him and then the dialogue continues along<br/>
more respectful lines, or stops.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
(My husband is not in these conversations - he nearly always is oblivious to<br/>
these situations unless it is pointed out to him.  Probably because the rude<br/>
offenders to children are always from my side of the family - this type of<br/>
rudeness to kids would not naturally occur in his family.  We come from<br/>
totally different backgrounds).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if this sort of thing goes on in other families as regularly<br/>
as it does in mine.  And whether or not it is the result of having<br/>
homeschooled (my extended family members understand homeschool slightly,<br/>
unschooling would be way too radical for them to even WANT to comprehend!)<br/>
kids in an extended family that is more typically mainstreamed?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that basically children are usually not considered &quot;fully<br/>
people&quot; in that part of my family, as in: they don&#39;t have any rights, don&#39;t<br/>
know their own minds, they don&#39;t know what&#39;s good for them, they should not<br/>
be heard or taken seriously.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
WOW! What an eye-opener to write the above! No wonder I find many family<br/>
gatherings so stressful.     <br/>
<br/>

On Sundays we have dinner with my dad, step mom, brother and my brothers<br/>
girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Jaiden(5.5) always gets dressed up(he has a crush on my bro&#39;s g-friend) Last<br/>
week he chose blue camo shorts and a orange, gray and black striped tribal<br/>
shirt. And he spent a few miniutes spiking his hair. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My step mom made a snarky comment to him about his clothes and how maybe I<br/>
should pick them for him. He looked at her and very sweetly told her that he<br/>
was almost 6 and was perfectly capable of picking out his own clothes and<br/>
that if she couldn&#39;t say anything nice to him about his clothes than she<br/>
didn&#39;t need to say anything at all. (the say something nice or nothing at<br/>
all is a point she&#39;s been trying to make with him)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105273511">We&#39;re having a real rash of this lately.  Just the last month or so, it seems, either the boys get along famously (like best-buds) or they&#39;re fighting.  No in-between, just extremes.<br/>
 <br/>
Andy is 8 (next Weds) and Dan is 3+ so maybe it&#39;s just some boy stage, I don&#39;t know. But it&#39;s driving me nuts!  It usually starts when one or the other calls a name.  Right now Andy&#39;s favorite insult is &#39;crybaby&#39; -- odd because Dan is not a crier.  Dan&#39;s favorite reply is &#39;stupidhead.&#39;  When names aren&#39;t enough, i.e. when Andy calls Dan a name after Dan has called Andy stupidhead, Dan hits Andy, whereupon Andy sometimes (tho not always) hits back. And so it goes....<br/>
 <br/>
The newest twist is that Dan hits Andy, who replies with &#39;I didn&#39;t even feel that&#39; prompting Dan to hit harder the next round.  Of course, these incidents only happen when I&#39;m either a) driving or b) on the phone (usually helping a LaLeche Mom -- makes me look great!) <br/>
 <br/>
I always respond by telling them &#39;no hitting&#39; or &#39; no name calling&#39;  and lately I find myself repeating that mantra.  I&#39;ve tried separating them, but since I&#39;m only one person that&#39;s not always possible.<br/>
 <br/>
Any ideas from those who&#39;ve done close siblings?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree totally!  At a recent picnic, my DH&#39;s aunt tried to joke around with<br/>
my son, who is quite the introvert, and doesn&#39;t even know her well enough to<br/>
remember her name.  He was also in a bad mood at the time.  Anyway, he<br/>
didn&#39;t get the joke and just stared at her.  She tried to hug him and ruffle<br/>
his hair (which I knew would be a problem-he&#39;s not a touchy-feely-kid, even<br/>
with people he knows!).  So he tried to pull away and told her to stop it.<br/>
She said he was being rude!  I thought that he could have told her not to<br/>
touch him in a more polite way, but that basically he was in the right.  So<br/>
I said that.  She told me that kids have no rights, they just have to do<br/>
what we (adults) tell them to do.  I very strongly and vocally disagreed<br/>
with her, not that it&#39;ll do any good.  Afterward, my son and I had a talk<br/>
about why people think that way, and why I think they&#39;re wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t understand why some people think kids are less than people.<br/>

<br/>
If it&#39;s not working, change the plan.<br/>
<br/>
When one of my kids did a name-calling stint, I would take that one aside <br/>
without gentleness and say &quot;WHAT are you thinking?  Why do you think it&#39;s okay to <br/>
do that?  It&#39;s NOT.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have said about various things, and about that, something like &quot;If a <br/>
stranger came in here and called you a crybaby, I would throw him out of this house. <br/>
 Marty/Dan/whichever has the right to be safe and at peace in his own house, <br/>
and you will NOT take that away from him.  If you can&#39;t deal with people <br/>
nicely, you need to wait until you&#39;re older to be around people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t say it anything like nice, either.  Force of personality can <br/>
stick with a person, and make them think again if they consider committing the <br/>
offense again.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Any ideas from those who&#39;ve done close siblings?-=-<br/>
<br/>
A sharp &quot;STOP IT&quot; and a following look has worked at least temporarily here, <br/>
and it only takes a series of temporary cessations to give them time to get <br/>
older and more resourceful on their own.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Right now Andy&#39;s favorite insult is &#39;crybaby&#39; -- odd because Dan is not a <br/>
crier.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Has someone called Andy a crybaby?<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t cry, especially, I would get Andy in a face-to-face private <br/>
non-gentle moment and say &quot;When did he cry?  What was he crying about?&quot; and if <br/>
the answer was &quot;nothing&quot; I&#39;d ask goofy-ish analogy questions like &quot;Would you <br/>
call him a skydiver if he never jumped out of an airplane?  Don&#39;t use words you <br/>
don&#39;t mean.  And don&#39;t use words that hurt people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you want a tender, gentle suggestion, sit with him and ask if he remembers <br/>
any times when someone said something mean to him when he was little or <br/>
called him a name he still remembers.  If he comes up with one, discuss being sad <br/>
that it happened, and you wish you could undo it, but those things can&#39;t be <br/>
undone at all.   &quot;No backsies&quot; on names once uttered.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can stir his empathy that way.<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t let it continue.  And I would tell him that if you&#39;re helping <br/>
another mom be more gentle, it&#39;s not going to help AND it&#39;s embarrassing if <br/>
he&#39;s being rough with his brother in the background.  That he could be messing <br/>
with the peace of more than one family, and he needs to either understand it <br/>
now and stop, or stop now and understand it later.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I would do.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby called Marty a retard the other day.  It was somewhat friendly, but I <br/>
commented anyway that maybe that&#39;s one of the things he should save for the <br/>
future when he has his own place and Marty comes to visit, because I&#39;m trying to <br/>
keep Marty safe from that kind of stuff at home.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s the part I haven&#39;t been able to figure out yet.  I think maybe it&#39;s because, at 3, Dan is finally moving into some of Andy&#39;s territory -- finding the same interests, wanting the same toys, etc.  Up until the last few months, they&#39;ve been almost inseparable, then in March we had to put them into separate bedroom because Dan was instigating by &#39;touching&#39; Andy&#39;s things.  I&#39;ve seen evidence that Dan baits Andy, then will run and tattle on Andy. Gary (dh) who is an only child, falls for this almost every time, expecting Andy to be more mature about it.  As an oldest, with a younger sister at the same interval my boys are, I see Dan&#39;s baiting.  I bristle at the idea of expecting Andy to just be mature and stoic -- it feel so unjust to him.  <br/>
<br/>
For me the problem is I remember being told that I was older, and should know not to take the bait.  I watched my little sister set up my brother for years. She would do something guaranteed to bug him, he&#39;d get mad and retaliate, then she&#39;d tattle to our Dad who ALWAYS blamed my brother (my sister could do no wrong with Daddy).  I know it&#39;s a really bad cycle, I just don&#39;t have the tools handy to stop it.  I find myself thinking (thankfully, not yet saying) the same lectures I heard as a kid, tempted to smack them all and send them to their rooms.  I&#39;ve read Sibling Rivalry (and I&#39;m going to stop by the library for it again this weekend) but as I recall, the methods she suggest -- sit down and talk until both are happy -- is something Dan&#39;s just not old enough for at 3.  <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not like they pull this stuff when we&#39;re just sitting around the living room -- it&#39;s usually in the car, or when I&#39;m on the phone.  Really, most of the time they get along great.  Andy has always happily included Dan, so there&#39;s not the tag-along thing I had to endure, and Dan adores Andy wanting to be just like him.  <br/>

I knew I&#39;d get better ideas here -- my toolbox was just empty. All I was hearing in my own head was the same crap I got as a kid when my sister baited us into retaliating, and we got into trouble while she could do no wrong (being the baby and all).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it seems to happen most when YOU are preoccupied, then maybe they are <br/>
trying to regain your attention.  Mine are 6 and 2 and we don&#39;t have the hitting <br/>
or name-calling yet but now that my 2 year old is getting more interested in <br/>
the older&#39;s toys and activities, my older feels like his space is more limited <br/>
now and he has to share things he doesn&#39;t want to.  When it gets to &quot;that&#39;s <br/>
mine&quot; being hollered around the house, I will ususally help them resolve it by <br/>
finding something different and more exciting for the one who has taken <br/>
something from the other and returning the taken object.  This usually stops it all.  <br/>
Redirection helps.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there anything that they can do in the car for trips?  Gameboy, books, <br/>
magnetic toys, etc.?  Every time we leave the house both kids pick something to <br/>
bring, all their own for the trip.  Sometimes they trade but my kids also sit <br/>
in separate rows in a minivan.  2nd and 3rd row.  Is this an option for you?<br/>
<br/>
When you&#39;re on the phone, maybe that&#39;s the time to pop in a great video game <br/>
or movie they both love.  Mine are busy all day UNTIL I&#39;m on the phone.  It&#39;s <br/>
amazing they hunt you down at just that moment.  Could you make a game of it <br/>
by saying whoever is the quietest or whatever until you&#39;re off the phone wins a <br/>
prize or gets a special lunch or whatever intrigues them?  We don&#39;t really do <br/>
special prizes or anything but mine love to compete for &quot;The Winner&quot; title.  <br/>
They do this for when we need to be quiet or eating or getting dressed.  They <br/>
both love to race and amazingly this hasn&#39;t stirred up negative competition <br/>
yet.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hope it helps.<br/>

<br/>
Oh yeah!  When my kids were littler we had a big van, and each had a seat.  I <br/>
had kid-tapes and would put one in right away, even while they were just <br/>
getting into seats/seatbelts, and would set a happy sing-along or story-hearing <br/>
tone as soon as I could so they had options. Look out the windows and ignore the <br/>
tape, listen to the tape, do-whatever along with the tape, and then when we <br/>
got settled and got going, I could easily pause the tape to point something out <br/>
or to listen to a question or a story.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to make car rides kid-focussed and comfortable for them.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband (like lots of adults) has rarely sat in the back seat of a car, <br/>
and he forgets it&#39;s crowded and hot and you can&#39;t see well, and I&#39;ve always <br/>
tried to be an advocate for the back-seaters, having such memories of riding <br/>
backwards in an old stationwagen and getting carsick and suffering cigarette smoke <br/>
and the choice of either dust or stifling heat...  SO, I have WAY too many <br/>
times for my husband&#39;s preferences said &quot;We need rear struts,&quot; or &quot;The back air <br/>
conditioning isn&#39;t working well, take the car in,&quot; or &quot;We need to stop.  Nobody <br/>
else has as much footroom as the driver and we need to stretch out.&quot;   I <br/>
decided years ago not to be comfortable if the kids weren&#39;t comfortable.  I <br/>
averaged us out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Even with our van the back is HOT.  Why don&#39;t they have roll down windows in <br/>
the sliding doors anymore?  I realize the windows are huge but they could come <br/>
half way down at least.  It seems we freeze up front when the A/C is on but <br/>
it&#39;s still a bit warm in back.  If we could all open windows and let some air <br/>
in, that would be great.  The whole &quot;rear climate control&quot; is a crock to me.  <br/>
Not to mention, the windows are VERY tinted so if we point things out for each <br/>
other to see, we better be going snail pace.<br/>

Having mine in separate rows helps them have their space and not so much body <br/>
heat.  But sometimes Andrew (6) asks to sit with Mason (2.5) and they do <br/>
fine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I eventually had it too, with my mom. I miss her EVERY day and am glad <br/>
for what time we DID have as friends.<br/>
<br/>
My 19 yo and I are rapidly becoming friends. It isn&#39;t a steady <br/>
transformation - it is a 2 steps forward, one step backwards change. <br/>
One minute we&#39;re talking like friends, two women, and the next minute <br/>
she seems like my little girl again. Its FINE with me - I&#39;m not in a <br/>
hurry and, in fact, I&#39;m kind of enjoying this time. When she was a <br/>
really wild super active hard-to-keep-up-with toddler, I remember the <br/>
same kind of forward/backward transformation happening as she became <br/>
more independent. But I was tired - I was pregnant the year she was 2 <br/>
and, although I recognized what was happening - how she&#39;d venture <br/>
further and further away from me, for example, but always run back, I <br/>
was TIRED a lot of the time then and she was very fast and impulsive <br/>
and exhausting. This feels a bit the same, emotionally, and this time <br/>
SHE is conscious of it too, so that&#39;s kind of cool, and I&#39;m NOT <br/>
exhausted all the time like I was then, which is nice.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re through the stage of her feeling any need to be rebellious in <br/>
order to make a break and feel adult - we had a bit of that. It is hard <br/>
for these unschooled kids to FIND something to rebel against - when we <br/>
parents don&#39;t have arbitrary rigid rules!! &lt;G&gt; But they do have some <br/>
urges to make things difficult in order to feel better about themselves <br/>
wanting to be separate and independent - so things can get a little <br/>
weird and uncomfortable sometimes. We&#39;re past that - at 19 she&#39;s so <br/>
clearly an adult now and doesn&#39;t feel any need to make that point.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2075911165">thanks, everyone for the ideas and experiences.  <br/>
 <br/>
I sat down with each boy alone, and later together today and explained why that won&#39;t be tolerated anymore, ever.  And, of course, we had some testing of that.  Andy hit Dan (hard) after Dan stole his drinker bottle, so we left the park.  Once more this evening, Andy did some sort of passive-aggressive thing with a toy, that hurt Daniel.  I explained (not very nicely, either) that I would never let one of his friends come in and treat Dan that way, so I can&#39;t let him do it either.  That it stops NOW.  Our job is to protect them, even if that means we have to protect them from each other.  He gave a very sincere apology, and even stopped me later to apologize, so I&#39;m hopeful it made an impact.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306198951">&lt;&lt;Maybe it&#39;s hard to envision properly from just what you wrote, but that <br/>
sounds horrible to me.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I sure didn&#39;t explain it very well - recalling the book, it was more like<br/>
not using the knowledge *against the other child*, which was what the<br/>
tattler had wanted. The examples he was giving were about everyday minutiae<br/>
like &quot;sister left the milk out&quot;, not serious instances of children hitting<br/>
or otherwise hurting each other. I guess he was trying something startling<br/>
to disrupt a negative dynamic that was becoming a habit amongst his several<br/>
children. The whole idea probably doesn&#39;t remotely apply here. For some<br/>
reason it just popped into my mind, when I read the original post about the<br/>
brother baiting and then tattling to his Dad, who wasn&#39;t present for the<br/>
lead up, although Mom was aware of the whole story. It seems like the Dad<br/>
there *was* using incomplete knowledge as a reason to then do whatever it<br/>
was he was doing - speaking sternly to the other brother? That wasn&#39;t clear<br/>
in the phrase &quot;dh rises to the bait&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
It really does happen that siblings try to get the other one into trouble -<br/>
I see it with our neighbors all the time, and sometimes that girl tries to<br/>
get Jayn into trouble with me - a futile endeavor. I have been in public<br/>
places where Jayn has been doing some innocuous thing, like playing at Ikea<br/>
in the kids&#39; section. I&#39;ve heard other children (strangers) noticing that<br/>
she is doing something they would apparently be forbidden to do, and<br/>
debating whether or not they should &quot;tell on her&quot;. Sometimes they say things<br/>
like, &quot;Just let her get into trouble&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Sending kids back to handle their own problems seems coldhearted to me,<br/>
if they&#39;ve come to an adult for help.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They haven&#39;t come to me for help - they have come to me because they expect<br/>
Jayn to get into trouble, as they would from their parents if they did the<br/>
same thing. Or they have come because they are so accustomed to parent&#39;s<br/>
constantly mediating their interactions. I&#39;m talking about Jayn, or someone,<br/>
doing something that is merely annoying, as compared to something that could<br/>
be actually dangerous. I try to encourage Jayn to express herself to other<br/>
kids at the park (eg), especially if they do something that bugs her - again<br/>
I&#39;m not talking about things that could be dangerous.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as I can tell, Jayn never speaks to an adult with the expectation<br/>
that another child will be punished. I know that there are parents who do<br/>
punish with time outs, or privilege removal in our local group. These<br/>
children are more likely to tell tales. I hope I can tell the difference<br/>
between someone who is wanting me to intervene because they need help, and<br/>
someone who is perhaps jealous of Jayn&#39;s greater freedoms. Maybe I can&#39;t and<br/>
I need to be more open to the needs behind the tattling.<br/>

<br/>
I dont&#39; think they are coming to an adult for help.  They are coming to the adult for satisfaction in feeling superior to the other child, by getting the other child in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have done this as well.<br/>
<br/>
Its a lose lose situation.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;d do what the father did, bec. I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to ever second guess whether information they had was &quot;unfair&quot;.  They might not tell me something that I really ought to know in that case.<br/>
<br/>
I think what Robyn suggested is pretty good.  Then I know what is wrong, and can decide if it really warrants my attention or not.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the kids, you can usually figure out whether or not you really need to intervene or not.<br/>
