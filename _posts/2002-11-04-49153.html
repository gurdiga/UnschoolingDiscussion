<div id="ygrps-yiv-266301560"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;He has requested an algebra course. Is there a better way to do this?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
How old is he?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think he&#39;s really interested in a formal algebra study or just <br/>
dabbling in it a little for now?  When kids are interested, then algebra <br/>
can be learned in a variety of different ways. I like the book, Algebra <br/>
Unplugged, as a starting point - it is a math book for &quot;word people&quot; more <br/>
than any other, but even for us number-lovers it is a great introduction to <br/>
all the main ideas of algebra. I&#39;d definitely read through that before <br/>
starting or along with starting any kind of more traditional algebra <br/>
program that involves just mostly learning &quot;how to do&quot; algebra.<br/>
<br/>
Harold Jacobs algebra book is rigorous and good - perfect for pretty mature <br/>
people who enjoy delving into things, really investigating and thinking <br/>
about stuff. There is as much learning in the questions as in the content <br/>
of the text.<br/>
<br/>
The Key to Algebra series is good for just plain old practice - it is &quot;how <br/>
to do&quot; algebra, with almost no information about why you&#39;d ever want to do <br/>
it or why it works. Not very interesting - but friendly practice stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I think getting really good conceptual understanding BEFORE doing the &quot;how <br/>
to do&quot; stuff is a good idea. You could get algebra puzzle stuff from <br/>
Critical Thinking Press and algebra games from other sources.<br/>
<br/>
I personally do not think doing a formal algebra program before the age of <br/>
14 or 15 or even later is a good idea unless the kid is SO self-motivated <br/>
that he just does it himself and clearly loves it.<br/>
<br/>
You might fool with Calculus by and for Kids as an alternative -- there is <br/>
also Calculus for Cats by the same author as Algebra Unplugged.<br/>
<br/>
Also - he could fool with Astro Algebra -- the computer game in the Mighty <br/>
Math series - not a rigorous algebra course, but excellent for developing <br/>
conceptual understanding.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329924185"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I know I just used this analogy the other day, but algebra is taught in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>same way it would be to teach musical notation to someone who neither sang<br/>
nor made music, nor had really heard music.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is why I think 14 or 15 is plenty early enough to even think about <br/>
some kind of formal algebra program. EVEN that only for those kids who want <br/>
to do it for some specific reason - kids who are already highly motivated.<br/>
<br/>
Before that, it is very unlikely that they&#39;ve picked up all the underlying <br/>
concepts and stuff that they should already know BEFORE doing a <br/>
&quot;notational&quot; version of algebra.<br/>
Even those kids who picked up calculations and seem to be able to do it <br/>
STILL have a lot of internalizing of ideas to do during their early or even <br/>
late teen years. And - its more worthwhile to spend time in speculation on <br/>
things like why dividing by zero is not allowed or what happens when you <br/>
keep cutting something in half over and over and over and what does <br/>
&quot;infinity&quot; really mean, etc.  Thinking about stuff like that and playing <br/>
LOTS of games and just being alive and time going by - will get kids READY <br/>
for the kind of thinking that it takes to get through the algebraic <br/>
equivalent of learning the structure of music, the notation, scales, <br/>
chords, etc.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I remember someone&#39;s daughter looking for a Barbie skateboard (Ren? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes. That was my Sierra....she figured the boys would never want to borrow it <br/>
if it had Barbie as decoration!!  We went to Toys-R-Us today and found one <br/>
that is both a scooter and skateboard, only $20.<br/>
Guess what Santa is bringing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info.<br/>
