&gt;  some of you would say I&#39;m not a &quot;true&quot; unschooler due to the fact<br/>
&gt;  that <br/>
&gt;  I just can&#39;t seem to let go of the math and language texts (ABeka).  <br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ve let everything else fall to the wayside, but these are the two <br/>
&gt;  that concern me the most (call me uptight!).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No answers or suggestions...just reassurance that some of us still use bits <br/>
of traditional textbooks!!  I think the real core of unschooling is to follow <br/>
what works best for you and your family rather than never touch a textbook or <br/>
directly address a subject (ie teach).  BG<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more in the rigidity of things.  IMO, at least.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess I do have a suggestion...if there are particular subject that are <br/>
important to you, get a routine set up to cover that part.  ie make sure that <br/>
math/reading/whatever is covered at the same time and place consistently.  <br/>
Then relax about the rest of it.  I would pick the time of day when ds and I <br/>
are most alert and cooperative and establish that as our &#39;textbook&#39; time.  <br/>
Doesn&#39;t have to be every day, but with a child that isn&#39;t self motivated  <br/>
routine is key.  You&#39;re the parent and the one most able to see the needs of <br/>
the child.  Trust your instincts and observations.<br/>
<br/>
I do think it&#39;s important to avoid a power struggle.  There really is no way <br/>
to force learning and bad relationships are hard to repair.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  (and please don&#39;t fall into the trap of feeling like we are all <br/>
cookie cutters and you don&#39;t belong here because you do things your way!  <br/>
Variety is an important spice of life.)<br/>

 <br/>
I too echo this sentiment... Zak is using Madeline Grade 1 and 2 Math on the <br/>
computer right now (he&#39;ll be 5 in August) and he really seems to enjoy it. <br/>
It&#39;s his idea to use this program and I&#39;ve been supplementing it with other <br/>
ways to learn numbers, such as weighing things in the grocery store, looking <br/>
at the prices in the stores we go to.  I even showed him how my calculator <br/>
worked the other day before we went to the grocery store so that he could add <br/>
some simple numbers.  Of course he eventually kept pushing all the buttons to <br/>
see what they did, but that&#39;s kids for you.  I think the more I do this <br/>
unschooling thing the more comfortable I become with him letting me know what <br/>
he wants to learn.  I just have to be open to hearing what he&#39;s saying or <br/>
showing me.  I think de-schooling myself was the first thing I&#39;ve had to do.  <br/>
I still ask him if he wants to do something like yesterday I asked if he <br/>
wanted to read some books when he was building robots with his legos.  I <br/>
think that&#39;s the hardest thing for me is to let everything be child-led and <br/>
each day I learn to do that a bit more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-792823147">Sorry, it may not be what you want to hear, but I say Throw Abeka out the <br/>
window. Who in thier right mind wants to sit around doing drill when they <br/>
could be out experiencing real life. Does your kid know this material? My <br/>
oldest son did the same thing when he went to ps-it would take him hours to <br/>
do homework. It was boring for him, and repetitive. Much like doing dishes, <br/>
come to think of it. Doing math work sheets is probably much like having <br/>
someone make you wash the clean dishes so that you will have plenty of <br/>
practice for washing them when they get dirty. That would really motivate me <br/>
(NOT)  Let him instead think of ways you can earn or save enough money to <br/>
buy a dishwasher-that will solve both your problems! Let him figure out how <br/>
many watts the dryer uses for a load of clothes, versus the sun on the line. <br/>
Then figure how much a watt costs-if you can put those amounts in a can for <br/>
your dishwasher fund, and then add the amounts you put in so you have a <br/>
running total balance. Let him comparison shop for the dishwasher, figure <br/>
out how to plumb for it, theres measuring and a lot of new vocabulary words <br/>
too. I&#39;m sure you can come up with other ways.<br/>
<br/>
We just added a dishwasher to our home, and it is so great! Just the nagging <br/>
that I do not have to do anymore is worth twice the price of that lovely <br/>
appliance. Not only is my kitchen clean, my family is much more peaceful <br/>
without that constant chore. And my kids are learning, without repitition or <br/>
the Saxon Math that we tossed.<br/>

&gt;within a proper time frame.  He will literally take all day to do one<br/>
&gt;lesson in each (and he&#39;s not struggling, either....just extremely<br/>
&gt;unmotivated).  I have definitely noticed this in other areas of his<br/>
&gt;life too.....when told to tidy the kitchen, load/unload the<br/>
&gt;dishwasher, etc. it can literally take him HOURS!  He drives me<br/>
&gt;crazy!<br/>
&gt;The only time he will really hustle is if he knows he&#39;s going to miss<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333263222">Maybe the problem is with the math curriculum, maybe not. I know that once <br/>
upon a time we used bob jones for math (not saying anything is wrong with it <br/>
) this was before we unschooled. The kids hated it. But I kept after them to <br/>
do it. Finally it dawned on me that it wasn&#39;t the kids it was curriculum that <br/>
wasn&#39;t working. Now that we unschool I do not push the kids to do math but I <br/>
do try to lead them. My kids are older, 16, 14, 12, and 10. Only the 12 yr <br/>
old likes math at all. But I have discussed with all the kids how much one <br/>
does need math for many things they may want to do as adults. I bought them <br/>
MathUsee as it just works better for us. I have some computer programs too <br/>
for a practice in facts for the youngest. I also took an idea from another <br/>
loop and made a gameboard that is an incentive to do math. ( it was supposed <br/>
to be for reading but it works for math too) Do so many pages of math and you <br/>
get to roll the die. (example 12) The landing spaces say things like.... a <br/>
serving of ice cream, 1 movie rental, 1 playstation rental, $1, and etc. It <br/>
is mainly to motivate my boys, who have a tendency to get too busy outside to <br/>
come in. They do not have to play the game but considering that we seldom <br/>
have any of the prizes around here they want to. I let my two oldest play too <br/>
as it would be unfair to make them go without ice cream! Some would consider <br/>
this bribery but I consider it just a treat and it works. Also if I want the <br/>
kids to do something chore wise that I know they will drag out forever I put <br/>
a favorite activity after it. Like, please do these dishes and if you finish <br/>
in 15 minutes you can watch your favorite cartoon for a half an hour. ( or <br/>
play with legos when you are done, whatever you wish). I always tell them <br/>
that we have a lot to do here, so if you take forever to do simple tasks it <br/>
is the fun activities that will have to be left out. Everyone always has <br/>
plenty of free time here though, and the work gets done too.<br/>
These are just some suggestions. <br/>
Hang in there <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1259087650">I think it&#39;s really important for me to look at why I&#39;m so attached to <br/>
certain ways of learning if my kids are not interested.  Is it because I&#39;m <br/>
fearful they will be illiterate or have no math skills whatsoever?  Why am I <br/>
so focused on math or english as opposed to making sure they get enough dance <br/>
or music classes.  I don&#39;t see people fretting over whether their daughters <br/>
and sons are dancing enough (LOL)... I really believe it&#39;s about unschooling <br/>
and deschooling myself first because I was institutionalized.<br/>
<br/>
OK so you may say &quot;well you have to have math and english to survive in this <br/>
world&quot;  maybe you ought to tell an actor or ballerina that and let them tell <br/>
you what&#39;s the most important thing to them....<br/>
<br/>
There definately seems to be a tendency to focus so much on academics rather <br/>
than the arts... Why is that?<br/>

Just thoughts that were going through my head and wondered if anyone else had <br/>
some ideas about why as unschooling parents there is a focus on math and <br/>

Dawn,<br/>
I think the reason a ballerina or actor need to have the basics in reading, <br/>
writing and arithmetic, is so they can read a contract, figure out if their <br/>
pay check is right and let the agent know who is boss!  LOL.  I know that is <br/>
why I am so adamant about these things.  I want my kids to be able to stand <br/>
on their own two feet, not get cheated, and be able to communicate in a <br/>
knowledgeable way.  I am all for any other way to do this then the texts, but <br/>
honestly, I haven&#39;t found it yet.  It is easy to find things to use for math <br/>
for younger kids, like cooking, weighing veg. at the store, estimating the <br/>
weight of fruit, or how much the total bill will be.  However, that only goes <br/>
for a period of time, then what?  I am not being ugly, I am serious, cause I <br/>
don&#39;t know, and my guys are 10 and 12, the only thing I know to do is Saxon <br/>
math.  I realize there is more to math then arithmetic, however, in the work <br/>
world, arts or labor, you still have to pay the bills, communicate what you <br/>
want and need, ect.  So...... that is why THIS mom can&#39;t let go.  But I would <br/>
sure welcome ideas, as my 10, actually 91/2 year old doesn&#39;t want to do <br/>
anything, not the computer, not workbooks, nothing.  So I am all ears!  (as <br/>
well as long winded)!<br/>

<br/>
Do you think it is because adults look out at the world and see that it could <br/>
be hard to make a living at dance and art? That would not stop me though from <br/>
encouraging my children to purse such interests if that is what they wanted. <br/>
(Our girls did take dance for around 10 yrs but they decided they liked <br/>
martial arts more. I wanted the boys to try dance but they refused). When I <br/>
sometimes get panicked about my kids possibly not knowing enough (school <br/>
wise) it stems from &quot;what if &quot; they can not handle college or tech school or <br/>
etc. Then I remind myself that I was a ps kid that got fairly good grades and <br/>
have learned more with the kids than I ever learned in public school. Then I <br/>
feel better. We all just want the best for our kids, don&#39;t ya think.  It is <br/>
interesting though. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318669795">Its kinda funny that you ask this now, I am sitting here with my 15 year old <br/>
talking about it. She agrees that she would like to toss all the math books, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I have an answer for this one. When I was in high school I <br/>
didn&#39;t get past intro to algebra. In fact I didn&#39;t even understand <br/>
what it was that they &quot;taught&quot; me in intro to algebra. I took that <br/>
class my sophmore year and was able to get out of taking math the <br/>
remainder of my high school years by taking Cosmotology my Jr and Sr <br/>
years. When I took math in college, about 4 years after I graduated, <br/>
I was placed in the lowest level of math (3 levels below college <br/>
credit algebra). What is interesting is that the whole sememster I <br/>
spent the class doing the assignment that was given at the start of <br/>
class and due the next class. I almost never listened to what was <br/>
said. I just did the math. I think that part of my problem in high <br/>
school is that I wasn&#39;t mature enough to understand what was being <br/>
taught. The equations just didn&#39;t click. I also didn&#39;t understand <br/>
what algebra had to do with me and my life. I wasn&#39;t going to die if <br/>
I didn&#39;t know it and life as I knew it wasn&#39;t going to end without <br/>
this &quot;all important knowledge&quot; that they said I HAD to know. There <br/>
were also other things not related to school that I thought was more <br/>
important. And they were. Anyway, I guess my point is that even <br/>
though it had been close to 6 years since anyone had tried to explain <br/>
to me the algebra, I still passed the class with A&#39;s without <br/>
studying, just doing the homework assignments. I also went on to take <br/>
the next level, still not college credit, and did the same thing in <br/>
that class. The next level, just under college credit, was a <br/>
chalenge. I ended up dropping all my classes that sememster because I <br/>
was working and then became pg. My point is that even though your <br/>
child may not be interested in the higher math now the time will come <br/>
when they will need to know it and they will learn it out of desire <br/>
to move on. Not because they are told they have to or because they <br/>
are told that life will not be the same without it.  Coallyn</div>

Awhile back, someone (I think it was Dave) posted about <br/>
proof that you could <br/>
learn all of k-12 math in 8 weeks when motivated. I <br/>
would really like to <br/>
know more about that. Anyone?<br/>

&lt;&lt; We have talked <br/>
 about taking high school math in college. If she waits and gets to college <br/>
 she will have to pay alot and get no credit for those classes, so it is <br/>
 better to learn it now. &gt;&gt;</div>
