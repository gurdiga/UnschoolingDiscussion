<p><b>Introduction</b></p>
<p>Those who promote state systems of standardized testing claim that these 
systems raise the quality of education and do so in ways that are measurable and 
generalizable. They attribute low test scores to management’s failure to direct 
its &quot;lowest level&quot; employees (i.e., the teachers) to induce achievement in 
students. In Texas, the remedy to this situation has been to create a management 
system that will change behavior, particularly the behavior of teachers, through 
increased accountability. The means of holding teachers and administrators 
accountable is the average scores of each school’s children on the state’s 
standardized test, the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, or &quot;TAAS.&quot; As our 
report will show, this over-reliance on test scores has caused a decline in 
educational quality for those students who have the greatest educational 
need.</p>
<p>Texas, a state with a history of low educational achievement and low 
investment in public education, has put into place an accountability system that 
hinges on the testing of children. The test has high stakes consequences for the 
children: not passing the high school-level test is a bar to graduation 
(regardless of the student’s accomplishments and courses passed); and soon, 
scores on the reading section of the test will determine whether a child can be 
promoted from third to fourth grade.<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note1"><sup>1</sup></a></p></font><a rel="nofollow" name="text1"> The 
scores on the test are also used as the chief means of monitoring the 
performance of teachers, principals, and schools. School-level aggregations of 
children’s scores are used to rate principals, schools, and even 
superintendents.
<p>The rhetoric surrounding this accountability system is that it is raising 
educational quality. Politicians claim that this testing system is &quot;saving&quot; the 
Texas schools. The system is gaining national recognition as an exemplary 
accountability system, because scores on the state test have, in most districts, 
been rising. The system’s popularity is further bolstered by the idea that it 
must be improving the education of Latino and African American children, since, 
in many parts of the state, their test scores are also rising. </p>
<p>Before other states rush to copy the Texas system, it is important to look 
behind the reported numbers. It is necessary to see the effects that the test 
and the testing system are having on the children and on what they are learning. 
It is essential to examine the effects of this system of testing on teachers. 
And it is critical to analyze the effects of this system of testing on 
children’s lives.</p>
<p>We present here our strong assessment that the TAAS system of testing is 
reducing the quality and quantity of education offered to the children of Texas. 
Most damaging are the effects of the TAAS system of testing on poor and minority 
youth. </p>
<p>Our analysis draws on emerging research on high stakes testing and on our 
individual investigations. These include a longitudinal analysis of instruction 
when test-prep materials become the curriculum, a multi-year study of Latino 
children’s high school experiences, investigations of Latino elementary schools, 
and research in urban schools with predominantly Mexican American and African 
American children (McNeil, 1988, 2000; Valenzuela, 1997, 1998, 1999). Our 
investigations have entailed the documentation of the effects of centralized 
testing in Texas beginning with the Perot reforms of the 1980s and on through 
the 1990s, when such tests were increasingly tied to &quot;high stakes&quot; for children 
and school personnel (McNeil, 1987, 2000). Our investigations have included 
interactions over the past ten years with literally hundreds of public school 
teachers, representing all subjects and grades and a wide mix of urban and 
suburban districts, whom we have encountered through research projects and the 
teacher enhancement and school reform programs at the Rice University Center for 
Education. Our research required fieldwork in schools and classrooms and 
frequent interactions with students, teachers, and administrators, whose voices 
and experiences are vital to capture. </p>
<p>In essence, our investigations have permitted us to gather and triangulate 
data from a variety of sources over a multi-year period. From these 
investigations, we understand that there are a wide variety of responses to the 
TAAS. However, those we report are the most characteristic among the many 
schools, teachers, and students included in our research. The effects of the 
TAAS, which we describe herein, represent strong, persistent trends emerging 
from the data. We are not describing isolated or aberrant cases. To the 
contrary, we have unavoidably encountered this evidence in overabundance, and we 
have encountered this evidence even in the course of pursuing other research 
topics. </p>
<p>Our analysis reveals that behind the rhetoric of rising test scores are a 
growing set of classroom practices in which test-prep activities are usurping a 
substantive curriculum. These practices are more widespread in those schools 
where administrator pay is tied to test scores and where test scores have been 
historically low. These are the schools that are typically attended by children 
who are poor and African American or Latino, many non-English-language dominant. 
These are the schools that have historically been under-resourced. In these 
schools, the pressure to raise test scores &quot;by any means necessary&quot; has 
frequently meant that a regular education has been supplanted by activities 
whose sole purpose is to raise test scores on this particular test.</p>
<p>Because teachers’ and administrators’ job rewards under the TAAS system of 
testing are aligned to children’s test scores, the TAAS system fosters an 
artificial curriculum. It is a curriculum aimed primarily at creating higher 
test scores, not a curriculum that will educate these children for productive 
futures. The testing system distances the content of curriculum from the 
knowledge base of teachers and from the cultures and intellectual capacities of 
the children. It is creating an even wider gap between the curriculum offered to 
children in traditionally high-scoring schools (white, middle and upper-middle 
class) and those in typically minority and typically poor schools.</p>
<p>In this paper we present what we are seeing as the direct, negative 
educational consequences of this system of testing, and its harmful effects on 
the quality of education available to disadvantaged Latino and African American 
children. Under the TAAS system of testing, curriculum, instruction, school 
resources, and children are all adversely affected:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The TAAS system of testing reduces the quality and quantity of curriculum. 

  <li>The TAAS system distorts educational expenditures, diverting scarce 
  instructional dollars away from such high quality curricular resources as 
  laboratory supplies and books toward test-prep materials and activities of 
  limited instructional value.</li></ul>
<ul>
  <li>TAAS provokes instruction that is aimed at the lowest level of skills and 
  information, and it crowds out other forms of learning, particularly for poor 
  and minority students. 
  <li>TAAS-based teaching and test-prep violates what is known about how 
  children learn. 
  <li>The TAAS is divorced from children’s experience and culture. 
  <li>The test is imposing exit measures that are particularly inappropriate for 
  LEP (Limited English-Proficient) students. 
  <li>TAAS is widening the gap between the education of children in Texas’ 
  poorest (historically low- performing) schools and that available to more 
  privileged children.</li></ul>
<p>An analysis of the actual effects of the TAAS on children’s educational 
experience is especially important given the publicity that has surrounded both 
the TAAS scores and Texas children’s performance on the National Assessment of 
Educational Progress (NAEP) exams. The latter exams present a mixed picture: 
there are some gains in the early grades, but Texas NAEP gains in the early 
grades do not seem to hold up in later grades. Also, the attention has been more 
on the <i>rate</i> of improvement on NAEP rather than actual improvement. Highly 
touted rates of improved scores (for example, that Texas was described as in the 
top four &quot;most improved states&quot;) mask the fact that even after such &quot;gains,&quot; 
Texas students were still at or below average, registering lower than 21 of 40 
participating states. Hence, neither the TAAS, nor attempts to interpret Texas’s 
NAEP rate gains as support for TAAS, represent the actual status of education 
for youth in Texas.<a rel="nofollow"

<p>The Texas Accountability System and Minority Youth </p></b>
<p>The Texas Assessment of Academic Skills (TAAS) system of testing and 
test-driven curriculum was enacted by the Texas state legislature in the spring 
of 1990 (Texas Education Agency, 1998). It is the most recent in a series of 
centralized, standardizing &quot;reforms&quot; in that state. It differs from earlier test 
systems in being increasingly tied to teacher and principal job security and 
pay. </p>
<p>The policy rhetoric surrounding the TAAS goes like this: By measuring student 
performance on a computer-scored standardized test, inferences can be drawn 
about the quality of teacher and principal performance, as well as the aggregate 
quality of the school. School ratings, periodically published in full-page 
spreads in the state’s newspapers, now serve as barometers for the condition of 
education in the state. </p>
<p>Hence, important judgments about personnel and the quality of schooling now 
revolve around a single indicator. There are clearly serious problems when any 
single indicator is used to assess the quality of so complex an enterprise as 
educating children. This is why the use of a single indicator to assess learning 
or to make decisions about tracking, promotion, and graduation violates the 
ethics of the testing profession (Heubert &amp; Hauser, 1998).</p>
<p>However, in this paper, our focus is not on the technical problems that are 
typically raised for this and other tests (e.g., probable impacts of particular 
questions, cut-off scores for passing, psychometric properties of the test, 
etc.), all of which are quite real. Rather, we want to focus on another 
consequence which is frequently overlooked: the direct, negative impact that 
this accountability system is having on the education of this state’s most 
economically disadvantaged, minority children. <i>What we are seeing is not the 
&quot;misuse&quot; of the TAAS testing system, but the playing out of its inherent logic 
at the expense of our poorest, minority children.</i></p>
<p>These are the children who comprise the preponderance of minority youth in 
large urban school districts. For example, in the Houston Independent School 
District (HISD), 52.5 percent and 34.1 percent of all students are Latino or 
African American, respectively, while 10.6 percent are Anglo. Moreover, 73 
percent of the total are on free or reduced lunch (HISD District and School 
Profiles, 1997-98).</p>
<p>To fully assess the impact that this system of testing is having on the 
education of minority youth, it is essential to understand how this system is 
operationalized in classrooms. One of the misleading features of this testing 
system is the notion that publishing scores disaggregated by the race and 
ethnicity of the children alerts the public to inequities. In reality, these 
scores are misleading and diversionary: The scores loom so large that they 
overshadow discussion of other, more telling indicators of quality of education, 
among these the degree of segregation, the level of poverty, or the number of 
students graduating, taking the SAT, and going to college. Furthermore, the 
scores mask the inequities produced when schools raise test scores at the 
expense of substantive learning.</p>
<p>Drawing on our collective and extensive research, throughout this paper we 
illuminate the ways that this testing system harms the educational quality and 
educational opportunity of minority and economically disadvantaged youth. Our 
critique is organized around very specific and documented harmful effects of the 
TAAS system of testing on the quality of the curriculum, the quality of 
instruction, and on resource allocation for the education of minority youth.<a rel="nofollow"

Because of their dramatically increasing representation in our nation’s largest 
school districts, a section below also addresses in some detail the even greater 
damaging effects of the TAAS test for Limited English Proficient (LEP) youth in 
our schools.<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note4"><sup>4</sup></a><a rel="nofollow"

<p>The Educational Impact of the TAAS</p><i>
<p>In many urban schools, whose students are overwhelmingly poor and African 
American and Latino, the TAAS system of testing reduces the quality and quantity 
of <u>subjects being tested by TAAS</u>.</p></i></b>
<p>The pressure to raise TAAS scores leads teachers to spend class time, often 
several hours each week, drilling students on practice exam materials. This TAAS 
drill takes time from real teaching and learning: Much of the drill time is 
spent learning how to bubble-in answers, how to weed out obviously wrong 
answers, and how to become accustomed to multiple-choice, computer-scored 
formats. In the name of &quot;alignment&quot; between course curricula and test, <i>TAAS 
drills are becoming the curriculum in our poorest schools</i>.</p>
<p>The pressure to raise TAAS scores leads teachers to substitute commercial 
TAAS-prep materials for the substance of the curriculum. Principals, deans of 
instruction, and other building or central office administrators urge or even 
require teachers to set aside the course curriculum and to use the TAAS-prep 
materials in their place. </p>
<p>Although TAAS is supplanting a more substantial curriculum throughout the 
state, the problem emerges unevenly. It is more common in traditionally 
low-performing schools, the schools attended by low-income and non-Anglo 
children. In contrast, middle-class children in white, middle class schools are 
reading literature, learning a variety of forms of writing, and studying 
mathematics aimed at problem-solving and conceptual understanding. In essence, 
these children continue to receive an education appropriate for their age and 
grade level, while poor and minority children are devoting class time to 
practice test materials whose purpose is to help children pass the TAAS. The 
TAAS system of testing thus widens the gap between the public education provided 
for poor and minority children and that of children in traditionally 
higher-scoring (that is, Anglo and wealthier) schools. </p>
<p>Advocates of a state standardized system of testing frequently make the 
argument that &quot;before TAAS, minority children were receiving nothing. Now at 
least, they are getting <i>something</i> (even if it is just exposure to the 
kinds of information that will be tested in the multiple-choice format).&quot;</p>
<p>We have seen no studies that have documented this claim. But what we have 
seen is a reduction in content, even in those schools historically under-served 
and under-resourced, when the TAAS becomes the focus. An experienced Anglo 
English teacher at Seguín High School (a pseudonym),<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note5"><sup>5</sup></a><a rel="nofollow" name="text5"> a 
predominantly Mexican HISD school, underscores this point. She commented that 
she teaches &quot;less&quot; English each year.<a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note6"><sup>6</sup></a><a rel="nofollow" name="text6"></a></a></p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>Less as time goes on. Less as time goes on with the TAAS test thing. Because 
we have to devote so much time to the specific functions of the TAAS test, it’s 
harder and harder [to teach English].</p></dir></dir>
<p>Subjects tested by TAAS (reading, writing, and mathematics) are reduced, in 
the test and in the test-prep materials, to isolated skills and fragments of 
fact. This artificial treatment of subjects into isolated components may enable 
children to recognize those components on a multiple-choice test. However, this 
treatment does not necessarily enable children to use these components in other 
contexts. For example, high school teachers report that although practice tests 
and classroom drills have raised the pass rate for the reading section of the 
TAAS at their school, many of their students are unable to use those same skills 
for actual reading. These students are passing the TAAS reading by being able to 
select among answers given. But they are not able to read assignments, to make 
meaning of literature, to complete reading assignments outside of class, nor to 
connect reading assignments to other parts of the course such as discussion and 
writing.</p>
<p>Middle school teachers report that the TAAS emphasis on reading short 
passages, then selecting among answers given to questions based on those short 
passages, has made it very difficult for students to read a sustained reading 
assignment. After several years in classes where the &quot;reading&quot; assignments were 
increasingly TAAS practice materials, middle school teachers in more than one 
district have reported that children were unable to read a novel even two years 
below grade level.</p>
<p>In writing, students are increasingly being asked to write repetitively in 
only the format of that year’s TAAS writing objective. One African American 
parent, whose first son received an excellent fourth grade education in a Texas 
elementary school a few years ago, reported that when her second son entered 
fourth grade at the school in the fall of 1998, the entire fourth-grade 
curriculum had disappeared. The teachers, facilities, and principal were all the 
same, but the fourth grade curriculum had essentially been replaced by daily 
writing of &quot;the persuasive essay,&quot; according to the strict TAAS format for that 
essay.</p>
<p>The approved format for the TAAS essay, for all children in the state, is the 
&quot;five paragraph essay.&quot; Within this essay format, long discredited by teachers 
of writing, each of five paragraphs contains exactly five sentences. Each 
paragraph begins with a &quot;topic sentence,&quot; followed by three &quot;supporting 
sentences,&quot; and a &quot;concluding sentence,&quot; which essentially recaps the topic 
sentence. Paragraph one serves the essay in the same way the topic sentence 
serves each paragraph; the concluding paragraph essentially plays the role in 
the essay that each concluding sentence plays in its own paragraph. </p>
<p>Teachers of writing who work with their students on developing ideas, on 
finding their voice as writers, and on organizing papers in ways appropriate to 
both the ideas and the paper’s intended audience find themselves in conflict 
with this prescriptive format. The format subordinates ideas to form, sets a 
single form out as &quot;the essay,&quot; and produces, predictably, rote writing. Writing 
as it relates to thinking, to language development and fluency, to understanding 
one’s audience, to enriching one’s vocabulary, to developing ideas, has been 
replaced by TAAS writing to this format. &quot;Writing&quot; as TAAS prep no longer bears 
any resemblance to what research shows to be a developmental activity in 
children’s language competency.</p>
<p>However, the essay is easily scorable in the testing of large populations 
because what counts is the strict format rather than the development of ideas. 
Many teachers describe having to teach this format in terms of its intended 
audience, &quot;Just think of yourself as writing for someone sitting in a cubicle in 
a bureaucracy, counting sentences and indentations.&quot; Others report teaching 
their students that there is &quot;TAAS writing&quot; and &quot;real writing.&quot; Still others say 
that in their school teachers are required to have students do only TAAS 
writing, the five-paragraph essay, weekly or even daily until after the TAAS 
test (in other words, until late spring). </p>
<p>Students also complain about the persuasive essay. For example, an 
intellectually gifted, Mexican American senior male assigned to (i.e., 
misplaced) in Seguín High School’s &quot;regular&quot; track, feels that the school’s 
priorities are misguided. In his view, the school should be preparing students 
for the SAT. On the subject of many of his peers’ academic limitations, he 
provided the following commentary:</p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>I’ve realized that the kids have good arguments here, but they have 
absolutely no argument skills. They probably have persuasive skills for the 
TAAS. Argument skills, none. The only argument they have is probably to curse. 
Say the F-word and that’s it.</p></dir></dir>
<p>Reflecting on a conversation he had on the subject of the college application 
process with his friends, he further places the onus of students’ limitations on 
the school itself:</p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>They [friends] were telling me that they are kind of fed up with that [the 
persuasive essay], because here are kids that are filling out scholarship 
applications and essays. They are writing essays, and they don’t know how to 
write anything else but a persuasive essay for the TAAS. They prepare us for the 
TAAS, and we are not just test takers. I try to explain to people that we are 
not just persons who need to develop critical thinking skills on how to choose 
between five things. How to choose the correct answer out of five. That’s 
nothing!</p></dir></dir>
<p>The required &quot;TAAS objectives&quot; or &quot;TAAS prompts&quot; which are to be drilled each 
day are often presented to teachers as five- to ten-minute exercises. However, 
teachers report that drilling to these prompts, often required by the 
administration if their children are poor and minority (with a history of low 
scores), frequently usurps so much of the class period that little time is left 
for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>It is a myth that TAAS sets the minimum standards and that teachers are 
encouraged to go beyond that. In many schools, it is the best-prepared teachers 
with the richest curriculum who are required to scale back in order to teach to 
the sequence and format of the TAAS.<font face="Times,Times New Roman"
 color="#ff0000"> </font><font face="Times,Times New Roman">In low-performing 
schools, even the most knowledgeable teachers are asked to set aside their 
lesson plans and materials to teach to the TAAS.</font></p>
<p>Whether children were being taught &quot;nothing&quot; before or whether they were 
being given a meaningful curriculum, the pressure to raise TAAS scores shows no 
evidence of opening children’s access to great literature, to conceptual 
understanding in mathematics, to fluency in writing, or to other learning 
experiences that seriously address previous inadequacies in their education. Nor 
does TAAS seem likely to do so. Under the current accountability system based on 
this test, financial rewards go to those schools whose scores go up, not 
necessarily to those in need of serious upgrading of staff and materials. In 
addition, the statewide system of testing has not been accompanied by a parallel 
investment that could reduce inadequacies and inequities in low-performing 
schools. The result is that many very real problems persist, problems which are 
not addressed by more, and more centralized, measurement and testing, or 
problems which testing may exacerbate by its focus on a narrow set of measures 
rather than a comprehensive look at children’s learning.</p><b><i>
<p>The TAAS system of testing reduces the quality and quantity of course content 
in <u>subjects not tested by TAAS,</u> because teachers are encouraged or 
required to substitute TAAS test preparation activities for the curriculum in 
those subjects.</p></i></b>
<p>The study of science, social studies, art, and other subjects that are not 
examined by the TAAS are all undermined by the TAAS system. For example, many 
science teachers in schools with poor and minority children are required by 
their principals to suspend the teaching of science for weeks, and in some cases 
for months, in order to devote science class time to drill and practice on the 
math sections of the TAAS. The first loss, of course, is the chance to learn 
science. The second is the chance to learn to become highly knowledgeable in 
mathematics. Many science teachers have little background in mathematics; the 
&quot;mathematics&quot; they are doing is drill and practice with commercial TAAS-prep 
materials. </p>
<p>The direct loss of both science and mathematics learning is clear. Less 
obvious, but equally important, is the way this TAAS practice widens the gap in 
science learning between children in middle class, higher performing schools, 
who continue to study science, and poor and minority children, whose science 
classes are more frequently sacrificed for TAAS prep.</p>
<p>Social studies is another core subject that is frequently suspended or 
interrupted for TAAS preparation. For instance, all history and social studies 
teachers in one Latino high school were told several months in advance of the 
TAAS to spend twenty minutes a day preparing students for the TAAS. According to 
one of these teachers: </p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>Twenty minutes is just too much. By the time we get to teaching our history 
lesson, most of the time is gone. And then it’s hard to re-capture the rhythm of 
the previous day’s lesson, which was also interrupted by the 
TAAS.</p></dir></dir>
<p>The content of elective subjects is also often set aside to make time for 
TAAS prep. Art teachers report that they are required to drill on the grammar 
sections of TAAS. An ROTC instructor was assigning the five-paragraph essay each 
week, not to link writing to ROTC but to add another drill to the regimen, this 
time in a rote essay.</p><b><i>
<p>The TAAS system distorts educational expenditures, diverting scarce 
instructional dollars away from such high quality curricular resources as 
laboratory supplies and books toward test-prep materials and activities of 
limited instructional value beyond the test. </p></i></b>
<p>Under TAAS, there is a widespread press to spend instructional dollars on 
test-prep materials and activities. These include expenditures on expensive 
materials for &quot;alignment&quot; and &quot;accountability&quot; systems and consultants. It also 
includes diverting dollars from Texas’ classrooms to out-of-state vendors of 
tests, test-prep materials, consultants and related materials. </p>
<p>The press to spend instructional dollars for test prep is felt most 
especially in schools with large populations of poor and minority children, 
which have been historically underfunded. In these schools, scarce instructional 
dollars are being diverted into materials and activities whose only value is to 
increase TAAS scores, not to produce educated children well prepared for college 
or future work. For example, to the extent such schools had fewer sets of 
classroom novels and other reading materials before, the pressure of the TAAS 
test does not lead to such purchases. Rather, it tends to lead to the purchase 
of costly, commercial test-prep materials. These provide practice in answering 
multiple choice, recall questions pertaining to brief passages that are written 
explicitly for test-prep purposes. </p><b><i></i></b>
<p>This diversion of dollars further widens the gap between the quality of 
education offered to poor and minority children and that provided to wealthier 
children. Middle class and wealthy districts either do not spend money on these 
TAAS-related systems or they have the capacity to make up the difference in 
local funding for schools; either way, wealthier districts continue spending 
money on high quality instructional materials, which advance their children’s 
education and place them in the national mainstream of what is considered to be 
a quality education.</p>
<p>Increasingly, expenditures for management and &quot;alignment&quot; systems are 
displacing instructional expenditures, and expenditures for management 
conferences and consulting around increasing compliance with TAAS are displacing 
programs of teacher learning and professional pedagogical development. As the 
state curriculum becomes increasingly test-driven, it becomes difficult to 
disaggregate test-prep from &quot;curricular&quot; expenditures. Administrators argue that 
materials aimed at boosting test scores are in fact instructional expenses. </p>
<p>Parents and taxpayers, however, are often surprised to learn that what may 
appear to be curricular and instructional, in budgets and expenditure lines, do 
not resemble instructional materials in the tradition sense. Software, for 
example, can be a means of providing students with up-to-date scientific or 
historical information, with activities for manipulating geometric figures or 
for learning to conduct information searches. However, in schools dominated by 
TAAS, software often focuses on test-prep drills, little different from 
drill-and-practice worksheets. &quot;Reading&quot; may make the lay person think of books, 
magazines, anthologies of literature, but in TAAS controlled schools, it may 
take the form of purchased practice tests of short reading passages. </p>
<p>The justification for these materials is often that they give students 
practice with the &quot;basics,&quot; which they must master before &quot;going on.&quot; However, 
among the schools we have visited, those where even low-achieving students are 
taught the subjects tend to have students who both learn more and score higher 
on TAAS than those schools where TAAS-prep has displaced the curriculum.</p>
<p>In districts where schools’ TAAS scores are tied to incentive pay for 
teachers or principals, and where TAAS-based performance contracts have replaced 
tenure, there is an even greater tendency for school personnel to shift dollars 
away from instruction and into the expensive TAAS-prep and &quot;alignment&quot; materials 
and consultants. Again, frequently these incentives are applied in schools or 
districts whose populations are poor or minority or both. And, again, because 
such consultants and materials are narrowly focused on boosting test scores, 
they are unlikely to enhance children’s capacity for thinking and learning in 
the many realms beyond the TAAS test.</p>
<p>The inversion of incentives needs to be systematically examined. If only 
those schools whose scores increase receive additional funding (a form of merit 
reward), then the incentive to focus only on TAAS will increase (to the 
detriment of more substantial learning). Likewise, if the neediest schools, 
which are least likely to have adequate resources, are trapped in that need 
<i>until</i> they can raise scores, they will see no compensating investments to 
bring their students opportunities to learn in line with more privileged 
schools. There is no plan to make a massive investment in the neediest schools. 
In fact, much of the public rhetoric is that &quot;low performing schools&quot; do not 
deserve additional public investment. It is as if their poverty is tied in some 
Puritanical sense to lack of virtue, with low scores as their Scarlet Letter of 
guilt.</p><b><i>
<p>The TAAS system of testing emphasizes the lowest level of information and 
skills, crowds out other forms of learning, and disengages students in many 
urban schools, particularly those whose children are poor and 
non-Anglo.</p></i></b>
<p>Teachers report that the pressure to drill for TAAS has caused them to omit 
or severely decrease other forms of learning because of the lack of time or 
because their principals are urging them to devote time only to those activities 
which will be measured by the TAAS. Library research, independent projects, 
science experiments, oral histories, long-term writing assignments, writing 
assignments different from those being tested in a particular year, longer-term 
reading assignments that include related writing and speaking activities – all 
are being reduced, even though they are highly motivating for children. Such 
instructional activities, which engage children in higher-order problem solving 
and thinking, are deleted in those schools (poor, minority) where TAAS scores 
have been low.</p>
<p>The rigor of the academic learning is also sacrificed by courses like &quot;TAAS 
Math&quot; and &quot;TAAS English,&quot; which certain students are required to take to enable 
them to pass the exit exam. The curriculum in these classes is predictably 
fragmented and incoherent, because teachers teach abstracted pieces of the 
curriculum in order to cover the various segments of the exam. Referred to as 
&quot;local credit,&quot; such courses do not count toward the 24 credits that are 
required for high school graduation. Since they are not &quot;real&quot; math and English 
courses, they are not taken very seriously by the students. </p>
<p>Placement in these courses also undermines learning due to wasteful and 
bureaucratic scheduling issues. If a student is enrolled in a fall TAAS course 
and takes and passes the exam in October, he or she will have to wait out the 
rest of the semester in that &quot;non-course&quot; until it is over. An administrator 
from one of the larger, well-integrated HISD schools where such courses are 
offered told us that students start skipping class after they pass the TAAS test 
&quot;since the course doesn’t count toward high school credit anyway.&quot; According to 
this individual, TAAS courses are also wasteful if the students fail the fall 
exam, because they have to sign up a second time in another such course. This 
expands to a whole year the time that students are not in the regular 
curriculum. In addition to the TAAS courses, students must of course meet the 
normal math and English requirements for graduation. Additional requirements 
tend to also translate either into summer school attendance or graduating off 
schedule, if at all.</p>
<p>While Anglo and middle class children in this same HISD school overwhelmingly 
pass the TAAS test within the context of the normal curriculum, an entire 
segment of the school’s population is being subjected to months, if not years, 
of TAAS prep. By treating these students as if they are unteachable, the system 
itself engenders a cumulative deficit in students’ knowledge, encouraging their 
resistance not to education, but to schooling (Valenzuela, 1999). Since the 
content of schooling is already deemed by many regular track (non-honors or 
college-bound) youth to be boring, unrewarding, and irrelevant to their lives, 
we are seeing the TAAS system of testing promote an even greater sense of 
alienation.</p>
<p>Preliminary research is showing that those schools that score higher on TAAS 
(usually wealthier, with fewer minority children) rarely teach directly to the 
TAAS. They teach children; they teach science, math, social studies, literature, 
writing, the arts. They teach the subjects. A tortured logic governs the highly 
prescriptive administration of the TAAS in predominantly minority schools: If 
the scores increase, it is because the school taught more to the test; however, 
if the scores decrease, the school needs to teach more to the test.</p>
<p>Yet, teaching to the test and thereby improving scores does not indicate 
increased learning or improved capacities for complex problem solving. For 
example, one largely Hispanic, traditionally low-performing high school with 
virtually no library, a severe shortage of textbooks, and little laboratory 
equipment for its students, spent $20,000 (almost its entire instructional 
budget) for a set of commercial test-prep materials. Even the school’s best 
teachers were required to set aside their high-quality lessons and replace them 
with the test-prep materials. Scores on some sections of the TAAS did go up, but 
teachers report that students’ actual capacity to read, to handle high school 
level assignments, to engage in serious thought and be able to follow through on 
work actually declined.</p>
<p>This school, touted in the newspapers for increasing the TAAS passing rate on 
reading, is now searching for a way to counter what is seen by the faculty as a 
serious deficiency in the students’ ability to read. It is clear that higher 
scores do not mean that children are learning to a higher level. Such scores may 
mean that nothing is being taught except TAAS-prep.</p><b><i>
<p>The TAAS system of testing goes against what is known in research on 
children’s learning.</p></i></b>
<p>Research on children’s learning shows that learning is not linear, that it 
must build on what children already know and understand, that it must engage 
children’s active thinking, and that it must engage many senses (Gardner, 1991; 
Ohanian, 1999; Sacks, 1999). In striking contrast, the TAAS reinforces one 
particular mode of learning. This cognitive impact of the test has not been 
seriously investigated. Classroom observations and teacher reports, however, 
raise critical questions about the sort of learning that is reinforced, those 
which are subordinated to TAAS formats, and those which are increasingly 
structured out of test-dominated classrooms.</p>
<p>The TAAS mode of learning is to &quot;master&quot; brief, discreet, randomly selected 
pieces of information. The reading comprehension and grammatical sections of the 
writing TAAS, for example, cover isolated skills through very brief written 
passages. These written passages are not intended to build a cumulative 
knowledge base; they are not meant to connect with children’s understanding. The 
isolated skills are presented in fragments, carefully sequenced to match the 
fragmented and isolated skills in the Texas curriculum frameworks. Learning 
fragments of fact and skill out of context is known to be counterproductive to 
understanding and to building cumulative skills which can be applied in an 
unfamiliar setting or to unfamiliar information in the future.</p>
<p>Two features of the TAAS and TAAS-prep materials are especially damaging to 
learning. The first is that under the TAAS system, students are to choose among 
possible answers that are given to them; they rarely have to think on their own, 
puzzle out a problem, come up with a possible answer, or articulate an idea. 
This engenders passivity and a dependent learning style that fails to develop 
many essential cognitive skills. The second is that TAAS presents the child with 
choices, of which all but one are incorrect. To the extent that children, 
especially in poor and minority schools, are taught a curriculum and test drills 
that are in the TAAS format, they are spending three-quarters of their learning 
time considering erroneous, &quot;wrong&quot; material. It is doubtful that there is any 
respectable learning theory that advocates children’s continual exposure to 
incorrect material. </p>
<p>Again, the TAAS system places most at risk the children in schools that 
heavily emphasize raising TAAS scores (usually poor and minority). These 
children not only fail to learn the same rich, complex material that children in 
middle class schools learn, but they are simultaneously required to devote hours 
and hours each week to a de facto worthless curriculum. By keeping children 
focused on these drills and these disembodied facts, the TAAS system of testing 
is denying them access to forms of knowledge and ways of knowing that can lead 
them beyond this minimal level, into higher forms of learning. That is why one 
teacher said that yes, under TAAS, certain students in her school who previously 
were not being taught much math (these were bilingual students, recently 
immigrated), are &quot;getting more math now that we are testing everyone.&quot; But she 
cautioned, &quot;but of course, it’s not real math – it’s not what you would want for 
<i>your</i> children. It’s just TAAS Math.&quot; The opportunity costs of spending 
weeks, months and even years on test drills which narrow learning modes and 
close off complex thought may be one of the costliest effects of the TAAS system 
of testing. It is a cost being borne by the least-well served children in our 
schools.</p><b><i>
<p>The generic curriculum inherent in the TAAS system of testing is divorced 
from children’s experiences, language and cultures</p></i></b>.
<p>The TAAS system of testing is not respectful of, nor does it build on, 
children’s personal experiences, the cultures of their families, nor the 
variations in learning style and interests that span any classroom. 
(&quot;Subtractive schooling&quot; [Valenzuela, 1997, 1998, 1999] is a term that captures 
this problematic, ubiquitous feature of public schooling for U.S. minorities.) 
This use of a generic curriculum is frequently further aggravated by culturally 
and socially distant teachers who teach the exam through traditional, 
teacher-centered, lecture formats.</p>
<p>Important lessons about culture can be learned from the experiences of one 
Latina teacher, Ms. Moreno (a pseudonym), who teaches in one of the larger, 
virtually all-Mexican high schools. Through a rather energetic and lively style 
of teaching that includes &quot;TAAS Pep Rallies&quot; for her students, a majority of 
students in her classes every semester are able to pass the test.</p>
<p>When asked why they were able to learn from Ms. Moreno, students often 
referred to her use of &quot;cariño&quot; (or &quot;affection&quot;) in the classroom. They also 
said that she taught &quot;the Mexican way,&quot; meaning that she used a lot of Spanish 
in the classroom and welcomed a high degree of interaction. An excerpt from an 
LEP student’s written commentary about her heroic teacher appears below (in her 
exact words):</p>
<p></p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>One of the heroes I know is Ms. ____, she is a person that cares about 
people. I have her TAAS class and she is teachers in a way that everybody can 
understand her because, she talks in Spanish, and English. I think she is a 
strong person. Because she spent many hours teaching her students in the 
mornings and afternoons, she is always telling us that we can come to her room 
during our lunch period that she is going to be ready to teaches us. I come 
during my lunch period and she teaches me every problem I don’t understand, and 
I feel very comfortable with her because she treats us like friends not like a 
student. (Written assignment for an English class by a senior female student at 
Seguín dated September 14, 1994)</p></dir></dir>
<p>Ms. Moreno was so committed to helping students pass the test that she, of 
her own accord and without additional pay, held classes five days a week at 
seven o’clock in the morning, to help students pass the TAAS. As one can see 
from her student’s letter, her lunch hours were also dedicated to helping 
children. Through her commitment, cultural sensitivity, and her Mexican brand of 
caring, she was able to help more children pass the test as a single individual 
than most of her colleagues combined. She embodies the ethos that 
Ladson-Billings (1994) identifies as central to culturally relevant pedagogy for 
African American youth. Motivated by a sense of shared fate and shared cultural 
assumptions, effective teachers of African American children see their role as 
one of &quot;giving back to the community.&quot; Ms. Moreno was no different and just as 
effective.</p>
<p>Ms. Moreno attributed her success—and in contrast, the majority of her 
colleagues’ lack of success—to the following: test anxiety and teachers’ 
inability to teach to &quot;this population.&quot; To prepare her students, she used 
typical English as a Second Language (ESL) methodologies, even if her students 
were not in the ESL program (i.e., were Mexican American). She lamented her 
colleagues’ penchant for teaching TAAS Math through standard, teacher-centered 
lecture formats. She viewed manipulatives as particularly essential, because 
they help students visualize relationships and therefore make sense of, and 
retain, information. While she was a firm believer that multi-sensory approaches 
work best for underprivileged youth, Ms. Moreno’s capacity to help her students 
rise to her expectations were also clearly mediated by culturally-relevant 
pedagogy.</p>
<p>The research literature is clear that the learning of abstractions which have 
little connection to children’s lives and cultures, or which present a 
monocultural, technical view of knowledge, yield little in long-term learning 
(e.g., Ladson-Billings, 1994; Valenzuela, 1999). It is unfortunate and of great 
consequence that problems of abstractions and technical, fragmented sorts of 
facts and formulas associated with the TAAS combine with an historic inability 
of non-minority, middle-class teachers to promote widespread academic success 
with minority, low-income youth in segregated settings (DeVillar et al., 1994). 
This Latina teacher’s example strongly suggests how real academic achievement 
among underprivileged youth can be enormously improved through cultural 
awareness, sensitivity, and a commitment to social justice that no commercial 
test-prep materials can possibly package. Attracting and supporting those 
teachers who are knowledgeable about their subjects, about children’s learning, 
and also about children’s cultures is a national need. It is one that will be 
difficult to fill when teachers are asked to bracket off their concern for 
children’s whole development in order to process them through testing systems 
which undermine, rather than foster, these relationships.</p><b><i>
<p>The TAAS exit test is particularly inappropriate for Limited English 
Proficient (LEP) students.</p></i></b>
<p>The TAAS system of testing has many negative effects on teaching, learning, 
and curriculum across the state. And, as we have discussed, many of the most 
harmful effects fall on those students whose education has been historically 
under-resourced and whose academic opportunities have, by race and economic 
circumstance, been severely limited.</p>
<p>Even given these general patterns, there is the need to focus more closely on 
the most rapidly growing student population in Texas: the children who, with 
their families, are recent immigrants. English is not the language of their 
family. </p>
<p>Harris County, Texas helps to put this issue into perspective. The county has 
around 3,000,000 people. The latest census data show that there are 875,000 
Latinos in the county. While many of these are descendants of original Mexican 
families in this region, and others are second- or third- (or more) generation 
citizens, many others are recent arrivals. The schools call them &quot;immediate 
immigrants&quot; -- children who have arrived within the past three months. Several 
suburban counties in Texas show an increase of more than 80% in their Hispanic 
populations within the past five years.</p>
<p>The presence of these children, and their need for a quality education, is no 
longer an issue at the margins – either in Texas or in many other states. How 
they are taught, how they learn, how their educational progress is evaluated are 
of central importance to these children, to their families, and to their 
communities. The failure of the TAAS system of testing to encompass a model of 
education which is appropriate to these children is telling not just because of 
problems the testing system is generating for these children. It is also 
important because it brings to light the ways the test, and the testing system, 
slight the relationship between children’s learning and who they are.</p>
<p>The TAAS exit test results in a gap in student achievement that may be 
directly attributed to the test and not to these students’ abilities. As 
newcomers at the high school level, non-fluent speakers of English are typically 
placed in the English as a Second Language (ESL) curriculum (or &quot;the ESL 
ghetto,&quot; as one scholar refers to it [Valdés, 1998]; Valenzuela [1999] refers to 
this placement practice in her own work as &quot;cultural tracking&quot;). In the ESL 
track, students spend much of their day in courses that focus on English 
vocabulary and English reading without regard to their prior academic training. 
Their remaining subject matter courses are characteristically remedial and 
rarely, if ever, honors or college-bound. Rather than inferring that the 
immigrants’ much needed – though often deficient – school administered language 
support systems should be removed, it is necessary to focus attention on several 
key consequences of &quot;cultural tracking.&quot; These relate directly to LEP students’ 
test performance. </p>
<p>If lucky, LEP students are placed in ESL subject matter courses like 
&quot;ESL-Math&quot; and &quot;ESL-Biology,&quot; which approximate courses offered in the regular, 
mainstream, English-only track. Teachers offering these courses tend to be 
sensitive to issues that face language learners, particularly the sheer amount 
of time – between 5 and 7 years -- that it takes a young adult to gain native 
fluency in a second language. Consequently, teachers offer these subject matter 
courses to keep students from falling behind academically while they learn 
English. As one Seguín ESL teacher phrased it, &quot;It’s unfair to put their 
academics on hold while they (students) take time out to learn the language.&quot; 
Another motivation for teaching these courses is the ESL teachers’ recognition 
of ample academic talent among their immigrant population. These teachers seek 
to capitalize on and nurture immigrant students’ talents in and through ESL 
subject matter courses.</p>
<p>Theory would predict the prevalence of academic talent among many ESL youth, 
especially those schooled in their own country for many years prior to entering 
U.S. schools (Cummins, 1984; Skutnabb-Kangas &amp; Cummins, 1988). That is, the 
more a student is schooled in one’s first language, the greater their conceptual 
grasp of academic subject matter (e.g., punctuation, how to summarize, arrive at 
conclusions, write papers, etc.). The greater their grasp of academic subject 
matter, the easier it is to transfer this knowledge to the second language.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the more common situation in high schools -- even those 
throughout the Southwestern United States -- is a scarcity of ESL subject matter 
courses either because of a lack resources to offer such courses or because of 
philosophical opposition or both (Olsen, 1997; Valdés, 1998). This results in 
ESL-remedial course placements, which in turn stall students’ learning of the 
mainstream curriculum. This process masks how the intellectual abilities and 
potential of so many talented immigrant students get compromised.</p>
<p>To appreciate and understand the magnitude of this waste in talent, one has 
to consider the characteristics of the immigrant population. Research shows that 
Mexican immigrants are a select group with average education levels that are 
higher than the national average for Mexico. They are risk-takers able to delay 
gratification by accumulating capital to effectuate their passage across the 
border (for reviews, see Buriel, 1987, 1994). Studies, including Valenzuela’s 
(1999), further show immigrants and their children possess a progressive 
orientation toward schools and U.S. society, generally. Moreover, since only 15 
percent of the middle-school-aged population attend secondary school in Mexico, 
to come across a critical mass of such students at the high school level is to 
encounter a truly &quot;elite&quot; crowd that their ESL and Spanish language teachers 
readily recognize.</p>
<p>What must also be considered is that Mexico has a challenging national 
curriculum which is publicly subsidized and thus accessible to most through the 
sixth year. By the fourth grade, students know the anatomy of the human body. By 
the sixth grade, students take the equivalent of ninth-grade level geometry in 
the U.S.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most school personnel are not sensitive to these kinds of 
possibilities—either because they cannot read a transcript from Mexico or 
because they simply assume that a good education is not possible there. As a 
result, youth get systematically channeled into the &quot;ESL ghetto.&quot; Even in 
instances when they are allowed to enjoy subject matter courses, immigrant youth 
are systematically denied the opportunity to achieve at an advanced academic 
level since none of these courses are offered at an honors’ level. This 
structure helped Valenzuela to understand immigrant youth who said in interviews 
that they used to know math, or who further reported that they used to be 
smarter. In a word, many were &quot;de-skilled&quot; as a result of having been schooled 
in the U.S.<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/mcneil_valenzuela.html#note7"><sup>7</sup></a><a rel="nofollow"
 name="text7"></a></p>
<p>Even if one considers that some amount of de-skilling is occurring, the 
quantitative part of the Seguín High School study arrived at three significant 
and interrelated findings. First, within the regular, non-honors, track, 
immigrant youth outperform their U.S.-born counterparts. In multivariate 
analysis, these differences were consistently statistically significant, 
suggesting that immigrant youth have an edge, academically speaking. A second 
finding from survey data corroborated the ethnographic evidence that immigrant 
youth experience school significantly more positively than their U.S.-born 
peers. That is, they see teachers as more caring and accessible than their 
U.S.-born counterparts, and they rate the school climate in more positive terms 
as well. They are also much less likely to evade school rules and policies. 
These students’ attitudes contrast markedly with that of their second- and 
third-generation counterparts whose responses in turn are not significantly 
different from one another. Particularly striking is how generational status—and 
not gender or curriculum track placement—influences orientations toward 
schooling. These findings concur with research from numerous other large- and 
small-scale studies (e.g., Matute-Bianchi, 1991; Kao and Tienda, 1995). Third, 
the level of schooling youth attain in Mexico or Latin America and students’ 
grades are significantly correlated. That is, for each year of schooling 
attained in Mexico or Latin America, achievement goes up, even after controlling 
for the quality of education they received (based on a subjective measure of 
school quality).</p>
<p>These three pieces of evidence together suggest that immigrant youth should 
be passing the TAAS test. Since their chances of passing the TAAS test are lower 
than their English-dominant counterparts, it is logical to assume that their 
poor passing rates on the TAAS test suggest more their difficulties with the 
English language nature of the test, than their potential to achieve 
academically at a high level. Their teachers frequently refer to this barrier as 
a chief explanation. In short, children of limited English proficiency are 
especially handicapped in their ability to exhibit their knowledge by the TAAS 
exit test.</p><b>
<p>In conclusion, the TAAS is a ticket to nowhere</p></b>. It is harmful to 
instruction by its rigid format, its artificial treatment of subject matter, its 
embodiment of discredited learning theories, its ignoring of children’s cultures 
and languages, and its emphasis on the accounting of prescribed learning. The 
test itself, and the system of testing and test preparation, have in poor and 
minority schools come to usurp instructional resources and supplant the 
opportunity for high quality, meaningful learning. 
<p>This system of testing is therefore not the benign &quot;reform&quot; its political 
advocates claim. Nor is it the remedy for a malfunctioning bureaucratic system 
that is merely in need of stricter internal management and accountability. The 
TAAS system of testing exerts a direct, negative impact on the curriculum, 
creating new problems outlined herein and exacerbating old ones related to 
historic inequities between rich/majority and poor/minority children. In 
addition, it masks the real problems of inequity that underlie the failure to 
adequately educate children. By shifting funds, public attention, and scarce 
organizational and budgetary resources away from schools and into the coffers of 
the testing industry vendors, the futures of poor and minority children and the 
schools they attend are being compromised.</p>
<p>For the children, successful performance on the TAAS in no way ensures either 
a quality education or a promising future. An education aimed at TAAS scores 
does unequivocally reduce children’s chances for a real education. The pressure 
to raise scores is greatest in our poorest, historically least-well-funded 
schools. To raise scores in those schools -- absent a major investment in 
teacher knowledge, school facilities, and instructional materials -- educators 
are diverting time, energy and dollars away from the kind of instruction 
available in middle class schools and into materials whose only purpose is to 
raise TAAS scores.</p>
<p>We conclude with an episode from Seguín High School that poignantly captures 
the human side of this misdirected and injurious policy:</p>
<dir>
<dir>
<p>I attended Seguín’s high school’s graduation ceremony. In the middle of the 
ceremony after the class song was played, about eight students stood up to chant 
the words scrawled on a large banner they held in their hands: &quot;14 YEARS OF 
SCHOOL. MADE IT THIS FAR. WHY CAN’T WE WALK?&quot; After the students chanted these 
phrases several times, three cops and six ushers approached the crowd to take 
away their banners. The audience booed the cops, including all or most of the 
graduates sitting in their seats. The hundreds of boos, which included parents’, 
brought the ceremony to a halt. Some students were escorted out of the audience 
by the police while others left on their own. I could clearly see how this 
state-level policy of linking the TAAS test to high school graduation was sensed 
by everyone as unjust. It was only too fitting to see how this policy was 
&quot;policed&quot; in a final show of force to the would-be high school grads. 
(Valenzuela’s June 5, 1996 field notes)</p></dir></dir>
<p>Rather than youth failing schools, schools are failing our minority youth 
through the TAAS system of testing. In short, we fail to see how the state’s 
interest is served by a policy that simultaneously diminishes young people’s 
access to a substantive education and closes off their opportunity for a high 
school graduation, especially when this route represents their best hope for a 
socially productive life.</p>
<p>There is a critical need for additional independent research that examines 
the effects of the TAAS system of testing on the curriculum in various school 
subjects, on children’s capacities to learn and their sense of themselves as 
learners, on teachers’ work, and on teacher exit (especially highly educated, 
highly qualified, and effective teachers) from public schools where TAAS is 
aligned with administrative bonuses and &quot;performance contracts.&quot; Virtually none 
of the effects on teaching, curriculum, and children which we summarize here are 
captured by analyses and re-analyses of individual or aggregate test score data. 
</p>
<p>In addition, there is a need for studies that do not rely merely on 
officially reported data on test scores and on tested students. There has been 
much analysis of the test score numbers, including analyses disaggregated by 
race. However, such studies have primarily relied on numbers provided by the 
state education agency and/or school districts. Furthermore, such studies are 
often carried out primarily by analysts employed by, or on contract to, the 
state or employed by organizations with continuing state contracts for such 
studies or for &quot;TAAS implementation,&quot; TAAS consulting, or 
&quot;teacher/administrative training&quot; based on TAAS. </p>
<p>There is also a need for public discourse surrounding the many ways to assess 
children’s learning and evaluate their academic progress. &quot;Alternative 
assessments&quot; in most subject areas are not &quot;alternative&quot; except in the policy 
context. Through such professional organizations as the National Council of 
Teacher of English, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, the 
National Writing Project (and many regional writing projects), the Coalition of 
Essential Schools, and others there is a broad and deep expertise on ways of 
understanding how and whether children are learning. Authentic means of 
documenting children’s learning do not derive from management systems, nor are 
they intended to be tools of management. They are &quot;authentic&quot; to the extent that 
they are premised on a rich and complex view of curriculum subjects, on 
children’s intellectual engagement with learning, and on an understanding of 
learning as developmental. They are &quot;authentic&quot; if they are able to encompass 
the relational part of teaching and learning. Ideally they can encompass 
learning that honors the imagination and the open-ended possibilities that 
substantive learning supports. </p>
<p>Authentic forms of assessment are ways of sharing information among children, 
their teachers, and their parents. They should be means by which adults can 
learn more about how to effectively teach not in a generic sense, but how to 
better teach &quot;this child, these children.&quot; </p>
<p>There is at present an enormous gap in vocabulary and in ideology between 
those who teach and those who set policy. This gap must be addressed if the 
system is ever to be corrected; that is, if what is known about teaching and 
learning are ever going to shape large educational systems rather than be 
compromised by them. Ways of governing and managing schools, even big school 
systems, should not depend on forms of assessing children that undermine the 
very learning schools are intended to foster. </p>
