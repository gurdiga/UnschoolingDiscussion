&gt; and pencil and let him write down all the things he doesn’t know and<br/>
&gt; wants to know more about instead of interrupting you at the time.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps explain it to him as a game of “reporter” the idea being to be<br/>
&gt; as quiet as possible so he doesn’t miss any details… then he will be<br/>
&gt; so busy writing instead of talking….Then you guys could spend some<br/>
&gt; quality time afterwards going over the questions and this would give him<br/>
&gt; what he ultimately wants which is your undivided attention.<br/>

<br/>
One more suggestion...hope it doesn&#39;t sound like I&#39;m overstepping, but just <br/>
to make sure, have you had his hearing checked?  With him asking for <br/>
&quot;repeats&quot; of what people say, asking what it means, etc, it may possibly be <br/>
that he has hearing problems.  I&#39;d check it out just in case.<br/>
