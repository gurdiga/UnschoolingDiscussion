<div id="ygrps-yiv-266222172">I really hope this works out well for you.<br/>
 Putting on  a lot of weight when  physical problems work against  using exercise  is really  agonizing. I have developed severe knee problems along with the foot problems and  the weight is piling on and   it is so frustrating .<br/>
<br/>
Hope your wishes for another child  come  true for you.Thank you for sharing this with us so we could send you hugs and  encouragement.  <br/>
<br/>
