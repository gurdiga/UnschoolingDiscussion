<div id="ygrps-yiv-370091596">It&#39;s my feeling that the posts I read of Ned&#39;s about &#39;schools&#39; a few days<br/>
ago were very ontopic for unschooling but a few people on the list kept<br/>
asking him to be quiet.  I really didn&#39;t get that at all.  I understand many<br/>
didn&#39;t agree and are afraid of what newbies will think but in my experience<br/>
by the time someone finds &#39;unschooling&#39; they have already learned a little<br/>
of what Ned was speaking of (gatto and similar info.) anyway and it&#39;s not a<br/>
big surprise to hear someone here speak of these things.<br/>
<br/>
It took me quite a while to learn to believe and trust in unschooling, I&#39;m a<br/>
stubborn one.  &lt;g&gt;  It took far to long for me to get unschooling I tried<br/>
what seems like almost everything to &#39;school&#39; at home.  It was posts just as<br/>
Ned&#39;s that kept me going and not send my child to school.  I don&#39;t read<br/>
Gatto or even Ned&#39;s posts much anymore but I know without these people I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be here on this list now.<br/>
<br/>
I hope posts like Ned&#39;s help others that might be in the same situation I<br/>
was once.<br/>

I find Ned&#39;s posting to be interesting, thought<br/>
provoking and very much related to the essence of<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
Helen, removing Ned from the list will be very<br/>
undemocratic, unfair and anti unschooling. Why anti<br/>
unschooling?  Because one of the reasons people choose<br/>
to unschool is the belief that there is no<br/>
prescription for learning, life or ideas and each one<br/>
of us as an individual and as a community, create it<br/>
as we go along with an open mind and tolerance to<br/>
others way of being. Removing Ned from the list is<br/>
putting the unschooling ideas into a circle and<br/>
punishing those, whom some of the list members think,<br/>
are crossing the line. Such an action is assuming that<br/>
there are external prescriptions for unschooling. If<br/>
we keep an attitude of plentiful we can be a better<br/>
force for change.<br/>

There&#39;s a company supplying &quot;high interest&quot; books (low reading levels)!<br/>
<br/>
There are others.  If you use google, use &quot;remedial reading high interest&quot; <br/>
and those are the buzz words of the moment.<br/>

I looked around a little, but it was too creepy for me being that deep into <br/>
supplies created for teachers, so I need to go sew and hang out with Holly <br/>

(surprised, Ned?), but this particular dynamic bothers me - what the <br/>
new people must be thinking about all of this. I can take Ned&#39;s rants <br/>
for what they&#39;re worth, and I can advise people to just ignore him <br/>
(he advised the same but I doubt many will), and I can refute his <br/>
obnoxious claims all day long, but to what end? At what point do I, <br/>
as listowner, just say enough, stop this, and unsubscribe him from <br/>
the list? It&#39;s been requested by two people now - two people whose <br/>
opinions I greatly respect. So far I&#39;ve overridden their request in <br/>
favor of letting Ned rant on, but is that right? Mostly puzzling to <br/>
myself here, but any insights would be welcomed.<br/>

Maybe for the same reason I was not one of the people who asked you to unsub <br/>

<br/>
How so?  It&#39;s a list owned by a magazine.  You and I aren&#39;t owners of the <br/>

magazine has a reputation and is a business.  The decisions aren&#39;t ours to <br/>
make.<br/>
<br/>
It would be anti-unschooling for anyone to claim, expect or recommend that <br/>
anyone&#39;s information all come from one source, whether it be one curriculum, <br/>
one teacher, or one e-mail list.<br/>
<br/>
It has been suggested that those who want to hear more about Ned&#39;s politics <br/>
should start a yahoogroups discussion and go there and do that.  Maybe lots <br/>
of people from this list would follow you over there.  People could be on <br/>
both lists.<br/>
<br/>
No one list can or should be everything for everybody.<br/>
<br/>
There are more unschoolers outside this list than in it, because there are a <br/>
WHOLE lot of unschoolers in the world.<br/>

for awhile I would unschool and then slip back into other things.  <br/>
