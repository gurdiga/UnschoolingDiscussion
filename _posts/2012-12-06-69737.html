She got the test back, because they grade them right on the spot, and had an 88.  It&#39;s a pass/fail class, so an 88 is good enough, but she looked and felt two of them were right, so she showed them to the teacher and explained.  She was correct.  The answer sheet was wrong.

I feel good because Holly bothered to do that.  Some people wouldn&#39;t have.  (Marty probably wouldn&#39;t have.  He&#39;s shy to talk to teachers or supervisors.)   I&#39;m glad she did because that could have made the difference between passing and failing for someone.<br/>
<br/>
And I feel good because (sinful as it might be) I can do the little internal happy dance that she got two right that someone being paid to tutor math students missed.   <br/>
<br/>
She said the other six points were for things she didn&#39;t understand well enough to answer.  What she did answer was all correct.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602392452">That is pretty great!<br/>
I loved school and did well in it. But what I see in my kids and hear from stories like these are so different. I do not think I will ever be able to see studying and learning quite like an unschooling person can. <br/>
I find it fascinating observing my kids.<br/>
I think if a parent takes the time to really watch their kids doing things and learning they would also be impressed like I am.<br/>
So take the time. Watch them. Observe. These unschool kids are so different and so amazing !<br/>
