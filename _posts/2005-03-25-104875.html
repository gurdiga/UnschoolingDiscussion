<div id="ygrps-yiv-372710229">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Been very interested in this food choices thread - what issues have you seen/worked through that parent&#39;s may have preventing them from being able to fully &quot;unschool&quot; when it comes to food choices?  <br/>
<br/>
I know that I get very uncomfortable with &quot;eat what you want&quot; since we have had guidelines/rules about food, and the initial &quot;go crazy&quot; phase really triggers me.  I have confidence in my head that the idea of open food choices is sound - (I had a really hard time letting go of controls around video games about a year ago - now it&#39;s truly open season with the video games, and I&#39;m very comfortable with it.  This brings me confidence in ALL open choices, moreso than if I hadn&#39;t lived through the really uncomfortable part to get to a more balanced sense of life with video games.) I seem to react emotionally whenever I&#39;ve even remotely tried open food choices.  Which hasn&#39;t been for very long because I get so triggered that I think I&#39;m easier to be around when I have some control over food.  I know on this list that sounds terrible - but I&#39;m truly trying to figure out what is blocking me, because I&#39;d like to get to the other side.  But, just letting go and jumping right in has not really helped.  I have been saying yes more often - for sure.  And, when babysitters come and I&#39;m not around, they do have open season on all sorts of treats, along with healthy treats.<br/>
<br/>
So, for my own clarity, some rules I have in my home:<br/>
(again - for my clarity, and perhaps to discuss how &quot;controlling&quot; I am, to flash it out for all to see, and perhaps others who are not completely allowing open choices but would like to can identify- all in hopes of breaking through whatever this barrier I have is):<br/>
-no sweet treats before a meal, particularly breakfast.  &quot;healthier food first - ie, oatmeal, toast, eggs, fruit, &quot;<br/>
-often limit amount of dessert/sweet treats eaten (ie -  one bowl of ice cream)- sometimes because I&#39;m triggered, sometimes because I&#39;d like to make the box of ice cream last longer, since the budget is not allowing lots of leeway <br/>
-If one food is requested over and over in one day - will often suggest another food, and point out that they&#39;ve already had 4 bowls of oatmeal - perhaps their body might like something else?  This is likely along the lines of open chioces - after I&#39;ve said that, if they still want oatmeal - I am happy to make it.  If it were to be ice cream - that would be a different story.<br/>
-requests for candy are mostly met with a no if we&#39;re out - we provide them with allowance each week, and they are entitled to purchase whatever they want with it - candy included.  However, I know they often ask if what they&#39;re buying &quot;is okay&quot; - I often say yes.  Once I have truly graduated to the other side, they won&#39;t ask anymore.  That would be great.<br/>
-pop is definitely limited to parties/babysitters in our house, and the times my dh has one.  He likes it, so there is often pop stored in the cold cellar for those occasions.  Any requests by the kids to have pop in between is met with a no.  All the time.  Pop is a big trigger for me.  I can&#39;t seem to get over that coins disintegrate in it, the total lack of nutrition in it, and the large amount of calories/artificial sweeteners.  It will probably be the last thing I&#39;ll let go of.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting, pop was always on the counter as I grew up.  My dad (an alcoholic) always mixed vodka with it.  I think I associated the pop on the counter with him, and never had any interest in the pop on our counter, although would drink it elsewhere as a teen.  As I learned how to treat my body well, I just lost a taste for it.    <br/>
<br/>
Stories/comments on how you transitioned, if you ever had to, from some control over food choices to no controls over food choices would be great.<br/>
<br/>
Thank-you!<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any food rules here.  My dd had a poptart first thing this<br/>
morning.  About half an hour later, she followed it with an apple.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-often limit amount of dessert/sweet treats eaten (ie -  one bowl of ice<br/>
cream)- sometimes because I&#39;m triggered, sometimes because I&#39;d like to make<br/>

leeway&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids never ask for a second bowl of ice cream.  I am the only one who has<br/>
trouble with having a second bowl of ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;-If one food is requested over and over in one day - will often suggest<br/>
another food, and point out that they&#39;ve already had 4 bowls of oatmeal -<br/>
perhaps their body might like something else?  This is likely along the<br/>
lines of open chioces - after I&#39;ve said that, if they still want oatmeal - I<br/>
am happy to make it.  If it were to be ice cream - that would be a different<br/>
story.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If they asked for oatmeal, I wouldn&#39;t suggest something else.  My kids (and<br/>
I) tend to eat in cycles anyway. Sometimes I&#39;ll make fajitas every day for<br/>
lunch for a week. Then I&#39;m sick of them for a month or two.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-requests for candy are mostly met with a no if we&#39;re out - we provide<br/>
them with allowance each week, and they are entitled to purchase whatever<br/>
they want with it - candy included.  However, I know they often ask if what<br/>
they&#39;re buying &quot;is okay&quot; - I often say yes.  Once I have truly graduated to<br/>
the other side, they won&#39;t ask anymore.  That would be great.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Requests for candy don&#39;t happen every day here or even every week, but I do<br/>
try to get them the candy if they really want it and it isn&#39;t going to break<br/>
the budget, which it usually isn&#39;t.  My older dd&#39;s Halloween candy is still<br/>
in the pantry and she could have eaten all of it if she had wanted to on<br/>
Halloween night.  I realize that some kids have a sweeter tooth than my<br/>
older dd because my younger one does, but she still doesn&#39;t eat all her<br/>
candy at once. She makes it last. Same with the poptarts or other treats.<br/>
She wants them to last so she might eat one a day.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-pop is definitely limited to parties/babysitters in our house, and the<br/>
times my dh has one.  He likes it, so there is often pop stored in the cold<br/>
cellar for those occasions.  Any requests by the kids to have pop in between<br/>
is met with a no.  All the time.  Pop is a big trigger for me.  I can&#39;t seem<br/>
to get over that coins disintegrate in it, the total lack of nutrition in<br/>
it, and the large amount of calories/artificial sweeteners.  It will<br/>
probably be the last thing I&#39;ll let go of.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Stomach acid would probably melt coins too.  :-)  My dh keeps soda in the<br/>
house.  I only like soda when we order pizza out.  It just doesn&#39;t quench my<br/>
thirst.  My kids don&#39;t really like the bubbles very much but now at 8 and<br/>
10, they&#39;ll drink a little.  It&#39;s never been off limits and maybe that is<br/>
why it isn&#39;t a big deal to them?  Or maybe they just don&#39;t really like it.<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  I do make cool aid in the summer and we make home-made<br/>
lemonade with lemon juice from a bottle.  I tend to make it with less sugar<br/>
than any store bought sweetened beverage and the kids are generally happy<br/>
with it.  Once in a while they&#39;ll add more sugar to their cup if it isn&#39;t&#39;<br/>
sweet enough.  My kids also drink a lot of water and really like water, esp.<br/>
in hot weather.  Sometimes one will choose lemonade and the other will<br/>
choose milk or water.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Stories/comments on how you transitioned, if you ever had to, from some<br/>
control over food choices to no controls over food choices would be great.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When my kids were smaller, I definitely didn&#39;t bring lots of candy and<br/>
sweets into the house.  What they didn&#39;t know about, they didn&#39;t miss.  I<br/>
bake though and we almost always have something sweet in the house that I<br/>
made.  It wasn&#39;t until I had kids that I tried to make our sweets more on<br/>
the healthy side.  I use whole wheat flour in my cookies and bars, I make<br/>
homemade granola bars with oatmeal and grapenuts in them, pumpkin squares<br/>
with pumpkin in them.  Sutff like that. My kids like the goodies I make so<br/>
they don&#39;t feel deprived of sweets.  I try to keep fresh fruit in the house<br/>
but it&#39;s expensive and so we don&#39;t have as much as I&#39;d like.  I wish it<br/>
lasted longer.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I used to make sure the kids had something healthy before eating sweets, but<br/>
I gradually started saying yes to any request and I realized by watching<br/>
them that in the end it all worked out anyway.  I could have made my dd eat<br/>
an apple before the poptart this morning, but she ate it after anyway.<br/>
What difference does it make?  <br/>
<br/>
My kids are just as excited about getting a box of strawberries as they are<br/>
a bag of Cadbury mini eggs.  They know not all foods are the same<br/>
nutritionally.  We talk about stuff like that, just like we talk about<br/>
everything else in life.  It just doesn&#39;t seem like a big deal what order<br/>
they eat their food in because I know from experience that it&#39;ll all even<br/>
out over the course of a few days.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing my kids do that seems peculiar to some people is eat one food at a<br/>
time, very often.  My younger dd, the one who likes sweets more than the<br/>
other, will often eat a big bowl of frozen cooked peas for lunch.  That is<br/>
what she requests.  Some nights for supper, she&#39;ll request potato and that&#39;s<br/>
it.  Last night she had pulled pork.  Nothing else when we sat down to eat<br/>
together.  Before bed she had French bread.  If you add the bread to the<br/>
meat, it would be like having eaten a pulled pork sandwich for supper.  She<br/>
just didn&#39;t eat them together.  She also had ice cream yesterday, and<br/>
grapes, and carrots, and an apple, and a poptart.  I can&#39;t remember what<br/>
else.  <br/>

season. (I don&#39;t freeze melon, but I just haven&#39;t<br/>
tried it, because it doesn&#39;t last longer than a day<br/>
anyway. lol but I can&#39;t think of any other fruit you<br/>
can&#39;t freeze). <br/>
<br/>
Just wash it, let it dry, lay it on a big cookie sheet<br/>
in a single layer, on parchment paper or foil so it<br/>
doesn&#39;t stick, in the freezer, and then when it&#39;s<br/>
frozen throw it in a plastic bag.  The the rest of the<br/>
year we buy frozen fruit, it&#39;s expensive, but not so<br/>
expensive I can&#39;t buy it. Again, I stock up when it&#39;s<br/>
on sale.  <br/>
<br/>
Alex eats a smoothie almost every day.  Vanilla<br/>
yogurt, frozen strawberries and blueberries, a banana,<br/>
and oj. The other day, getting out the fruit, I saw<br/>
the cheapo vanilla ice cream, and threw a small scoop<br/>
in there, too, it was incredible. :-) <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re gonna try freezing the bananas, heard that&#39;s<br/>
good.  <br/>
<br/>
It has everything in there, calcium, fiber, a little<br/>
fat for absorption of the vitamins, blueberries have<br/>
the lycopenes, or whatever, lol, but we just know how<br/>
it makes us feel, which is very good. ;-)<br/>

 <br/>
I didn&#39;t foresee it happening, but my kids who have had food choices since  <br/>
they were born (nursing on demand and never pressing foods they turned away <br/>
from  as they got older) and who are NOT told &quot;no&quot; to candy requests when we&#39;re <br/>
out  very rarely request candy.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby wants RedVines to take with him to an anime convention once a  year.  <br/>
He hands them out.  They call him &quot;licorice boy.&quot;  Last  year he paid for his <br/>
own, and someone brought him a tub, too, at the site, as a  donation to his <br/>
distribution plan.<br/>
 <br/>
Holly usually has a box of candy in her room and offers it to guests.   She <br/>
has often thrown out the end of it for getting too old.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
But we never say no.  It&#39;s just not a thing they want.<br/>
 <br/>
Joyce wrote something really great about the value of saying yes:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes_">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes)">http://sandradodd.com/joyce/yes)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
The changes it makes are to the core of who a child is, and of who the  <br/>
parent is.  It&#39;s WAY bigger than all the candy in town.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
&quot;No&quot; hurts more than soda pop.<br/>
&quot;No&quot; is &quot;you are small and I am big, but when you are big you can have all  <br/>
the soda you can possibly drink.&quot;   It makes them want to grow up  rather than <br/>
be who they are, where they are.  It&#39;s not  trust-building.<br/>
 <br/>
Trust is bigger than all the soda in the world.<br/>
It can make or break your unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I can&#39;t seem to get over that coins disintegrate in it=-<br/>
 <br/>
You have some soda in the basement at your house right now.  Dissolve  a coin <br/>
in it.  That will convince your kids, won&#39;t it?  Write and tell  us how long <br/>
it took to dissolve, okay?  And tell us why it didn&#39;t dissolve  the can it was <br/>
in, if you still feel like writing.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Stomach acid would probably melt coins too.  :-) -=-<br/>

It doesn&#39;t, or it would be no problem when people or zoo animals swallowed  <br/>
&quot;foreign objects.&quot;  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I did it just like I did the entire shift to unschooling.  I spent  just one <br/>
weekend surrounded by unschooling families at a Live and Learn  Conference and <br/>
I came home and really just did it all on a leap of  faith.  I didn&#39;t imagine <br/>
it could do much harm and  I just knew it my heart that the people I met that <br/>
weekend were on to  something good!<br/>
 <br/>
I just let go of my arbitrary rules and kept reading and  breathing and <br/>
reading some more.  The kids were just fine.  They  stayed up late a lot and <br/>
watched TV and ate lots of stuff that I wasn&#39;t  altogether comfortable with.  I <br/>
occasionally bit my tongue  as they ate cookies for breakfast or cheese and <br/>
crackers all day long. I  let them make their own decisions about what and when they <br/>
ate but I also made  sure we had a good balance of all types of food in the <br/>
house.   <br/>
 <br/>
It was the best transition for us because our home was very rule  oriented.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t even know the terminology of rule vs  principle living but  letting <br/>
go of all our rules at once allowed  me to step back and examine each of them <br/>
and be able to understand and  discover living by principles. <br/>
 <br/>
Our family now is one where each person has the right to make their own  <br/>
choices about what they do, what they eat and when they sleep.  While some  of <br/>
these food choices are similar,(we all love Blue Bell Cookie dough ice  cream and <br/>
have been known to eat it in mass quantities) we each are very  unique in our <br/>
eating habits.<br/>
I&#39;m very sensitive to sugar and feel best if I eat protein with several  <br/>
small meals a day, my daughter is a vegetarian and loves donuts for  breakfast,  <br/>
my husband  sometimes eats pudding with protein  powder for breakfast, and my <br/>
son goes through stages where he eats the  same thing for days.  This week it <br/>
has been pepperoni, mustard and pickle  sandwiches.  All in all, I think we all <br/>
eat a healthy balance of  nutritious food during any given week. <br/>
 <br/>
I try and plan meals that has something each person will like although I  <br/>
very seldom cook any kind of red meat.  My husband orders steaks on his  frequent <br/>
business trips so he doesn&#39;t mind that we eat mostly vegetarian or fish  at <br/>
home. We all eat several small meals a day often at different times but  <br/>
usually have some type of an evening meal together a few times a week.  I  often put <br/>
out plates of fruits, vegies, cheese and crackers.  Sometimes  Logan and I <br/>
will steam an huge bunch of asparagus and eat it for a snack.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids were older (10 and 13) when we  started unschooling.   However, <br/>
learning to make choices that were best for their bodies seemed to be  easy for <br/>
them.  Food is just not an issue at our house any more.  Just  as the kids sleep <br/>
when they are tired, they eat when they are hungry.   Sometimes, they eat <br/>
candy.  Mostly, they eat a bit of everything.<br/>
 <br/>
No one feels guilty about anything they eat except for me....and that&#39;s  <br/>
because growing up someone else told me what I could and could not eat.   Not <br/>
something I ever want my children to experience again.<br/>

Four out of five doctors used to recommend Camel cigarettes, too.   Said they <br/>

Seems if stomach acid could dissolve a quarter it would kill us in our  sleep <br/>

Several years ago, Logan put nails in different containers with coke,  orange <br/>
juice, milk and water.  After a couple of weeks, the one in water  was in the <br/>
worst shape...all covered in rust.<br/>
 <br/>
The one in coke held up just fine.<br/>

And if you leave a McDonald&#39;s cup full of Coke in the cupholder  of your car <br/>
for too long, the bottom of the cup will dissolve and fill up your  cup holder <br/>
and spill over.  Found out the hard way.<br/>

earliest episodes. They did a whole series of Cola myths.<br/>
<br/>
And for those of you who haven&#39;t seen Mythbusters, it&#39;s one of the <br/>
coolest unschooling-est shows on TV. These guys make everything from <br/>
scratch, go out and talk to real people, and use real science to <br/>
test all kinds of crazy myths out. My kids never want to miss it <br/>
(thank heavens for DVR!) For instance, here&#39;s the description of the <br/>
show they&#39;re premiering next week:<br/>
<br/>
Episode 30: Son of a Gun<br/>
It&#39;s survived untried for nearly 150 years: The myth of the Civil <br/>
War soldier who was shot clean through his nether regions and the <br/>
nearby woman who became pregnant when hit by the traveling bullet. <br/>
Good luck, Jamie and Adam! Then the two test just how dangerous it <br/>
is to use the telephone or take a shower during a thunderstorm. <br/>
Finally, Scottie and Kari attempt to re-create the voyage of a <br/>
hapless pair of boating greenhorns who set out to sea without first <br/>
detaching their boat from their car trailer.<br/>
premiere: March 30, 2005 <br/>

her if she&#39;d like me to make her something. If she doesn&#39;t that would <br/>
be okay but so far she&#39;s always said yes. For her, since she can have <br/>
as much as she wants the only thing special about candy is that it&#39;s <br/>
easier than making a bowl of cereal. But if I offer to make the cereal <br/>
then that&#39;s more appealing to her for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
So, without a rule, with the freedom to eat candy for breakfast she <br/>
chooses &quot;healthier food first&quot; just because it&#39;s more appealing to her <br/>
for breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -often limit amount of dessert/sweet treats eaten (ie -  one bowl of <br/>

&gt; allowing lots of leeway<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What you&#39;re saying with this is that your wants are more important than <br/>
their wants. And since you&#39;re bigger and stronger you get to have your <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
What if you really really wanted a bowl of ice cream and nothing felt <br/>
like it would satisfy that craving and your husband said, no you can&#39;t, <br/>
we need to make it last?<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a special event that&#39;s it being saved for they&#39;ll understand <br/>
-- if it isn&#39;t commonly limited. But what better use for ice cream <br/>
could there be than to have happy kids :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -If one food is requested over and over in one day - will often <br/>
&gt; suggest another food, and point out that they&#39;ve already had 4 bowls <br/>
&gt; of oatmeal - perhaps their body might like something else?  This is <br/>
&gt; likely along the lines of open chioces - after I&#39;ve said that, if they <br/>
&gt; still want oatmeal - I am happy to make it.  If it were to be ice <br/>
&gt; cream - that would be a different story.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my husband had a week long business trip I had spaghetti every <br/>
night for dinner. Why should someone have to be an adult to have the <br/>
freedom to do that?<br/>
<br/>
What if you had to live your life asking your husband&#39;s permission and <br/>
help for everything you wanted? Maybe try that for a week! Every time <br/>
you start to do something independently -- even decisions about what to <br/>
buy at the store, what to make for dinner -- imagine having to ask your <br/>
husband if it&#39;s okay, or for him to do it for you. Imagine if his <br/>
priorities were different and he&#39;d often say no because he didn&#39;t like <br/>
the choices you made.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -requests for candy are mostly met with a no if we&#39;re out - we provide <br/>
&gt; them with allowance each week, and they are entitled to purchase <br/>
&gt; whatever they want with it - candy included.  However, I know they <br/>
&gt; often ask if what they&#39;re buying &quot;is okay&quot; - I often say yes.  Once I <br/>
&gt; have truly graduated to the other side, they won&#39;t ask anymore.  That <br/>
&gt; would be great.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s your favorite food? What if the only way you could get out into <br/>
the world and out to where your favorite food (or book or movie) was <br/>
was to go with him? And what if you were out with him and the thing you <br/>
really wanted was right there within reach and he said no?<br/>
<br/>
If we as adults had to live our lives as kids, being dependent on <br/>
someone, asking permission for each thing we wanted, we&#39;d go nuts! <br/>
(And, hey, it might happen! And it might be our kids that we&#39;re saying <br/>
&quot;No, your needs and wants aren&#39;t what I want to do for you. You can <br/>
take what I think you need,&quot; who are taking care of us!) *Life* and <br/>
society so severely restrict kids&#39; freedom to get what they want for <br/>
themselves. We can add to that and be additional controllers in their <br/>
lives. Or we can be their partners and recognize that they don&#39;t have <br/>
the freedoms that we do and compassionately help them get what they <br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
The less needy they are, the less they&#39;ll need. If they know that 75% <br/>
of their requests will be turned down, they have to ask for a lot more <br/>
to get a better chance of getting the things they want.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -pop is definitely limited to parties/babysitters in our house, and <br/>
&gt; the times my dh has one.  He likes it, so there is often pop stored in <br/>
&gt; the cold cellar for those occasions.  Any requests by the kids to have <br/>
&gt; pop in between is met with a no.  All the time.  Pop is a big trigger <br/>
&gt; for me.  I can&#39;t seem to get over that coins disintegrate in it, the <br/>
&gt; total lack of nutrition in it, and the large amount of <br/>
&gt; calories/artificial sweeteners.  It will probably be the last thing <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll let go of.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what you&#39;re doing by making pop for special occasions is making it <br/>
something special to be greatly desired. Is that what you want? I&#39;ve <br/>
got 2 cases of Coke sitting in the closet for anyone to take. It&#39;s rare <br/>
when anyone other than me takes one.<br/>
<br/>
By limiting it you&#39;re creating a desire for it.<br/>

Ben aznd I were out to lunch a few months ago. Across from us sat a <br/>
woman and her very old mother----eighties, at least.<br/>
<br/>
The daughter was telling her mom: &quot;Eat your soup and sandwich FIRST, <br/>
Mama, THEN you can have your dessert. No, drink some tea first. Here, <br/>
use your napkin. Mama, sit DOWN! No dessert until you finish that <br/>
sandwich. Here---have another bite. Just one more. No more sugar in <br/>
your tea; you&#39;ve had enough. Stop now. Here&#39; I&#39;ll put it away. Do you <br/>
want dessert? Mama, stop looking around. Eat your lunch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This went on through the entire meal. The daughter just kept after the <br/>
old woman. It was so sad. I said so to Ben.<br/>
<br/>
Then Ben asked, &quot;I wonder where she learned it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
