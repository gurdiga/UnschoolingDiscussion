<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331300862">We have pretty much unschooled for the year. My son is in ninth grade <br/>
this year my daughter in fourth. For the state we either need to send <br/>
in testing results or an evaluation of their portfolio. What does <br/>
everyone do to satisfy the states need for proof that the children are <br/>
learning? Last year we tested which was fine and they both did great <br/>
but this year with my son being in High Shcool I don&#39;t know if that is <br/>
still an option. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What state you are in would be helpful for providing info. Where we <br/>
are (CT) there is no requirement to do testing or portfolio or any <br/>
evaluation at all at any time, no recordkeeping, nada. So it would <br/>
help if we knew where you are so that folks from that area could point <br/>
you in the proper direction.<br/>

state organization &lt;www.nhhomeschooling&gt;  they can help you find an <br/>
unschooling-friendly evaluator, I bet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696337633">I know an unschooling friendly evaluator in Maine who can do NH portfolios<br/>
too.  Not sure how far away from Maine you are but if you don&#39;t find someone<br/>
close to you, let me know and I&#39;ll give you her name and number off list.<br/>
