<div id="ygrps-yiv-911360238">Well, this was the point in my life where I did not nurse for fear of eating<br/>
the wall again. In a discussion on the topic, I cleverly dangled from the<br/>
wall with my husband&#39;s hand on my throat. My breasts were his, as well as<br/>
all of my body. If I wanted to keep the Da** baby I would feed the F***er<br/>
formula or let it starve. Then again, since I decided not to terminate the<br/>
pregnancy to start, it was another item on his list of my faults. When I<br/>
left, I felt that most of life was my fault, and I was to blame for anything<br/>
that was bad. The cereal fell off a shelf at the store I worked for, and<br/>
amongst tears, I was apologizing to my manager for it being my fault. He was<br/>
more upset over it than I. Since it was my life, and his just happening to<br/>
be there. Does that make sense?<br/>
