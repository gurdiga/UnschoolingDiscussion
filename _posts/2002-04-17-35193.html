<div id="ygrps-yiv-310492312">**I don&#39;t have a clue where to begin to find out what the requirements<br/>
are for a passing grade in California for second grade.  I know I can<br/>
have him tested here, in Oregon, but I&#39;m sure they test for Oregon<br/>
requirements.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great likelihood that he might remain here with us in<br/>
Oregon after the current family crisis is over, but should things<br/>
improve enough that he should return to his mother, I don&#39;t want to<br/>
send him home without the requirements to enter third grade in<br/>
California.**<br/>

Hi, Ruby --<br/>
<br/>
The California State Education Department lists on their website the big<br/>
fancy learning standards that they have adopted for every grade level up<br/>
to 12th.  They are pretty intimidating -- I certainly don&#39;t believe that<br/>
all children in all CA schools are coming close to learning this much.<br/>
However, it will give you a general idea of what his former teacher<br/>
might be ATTEMPTING to teach her second grade students.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t let it make you crazy.  As I&#39;m sure you know, just pouring<br/>
love over your grandson is going to be a lot more important than<br/>
stuffing knowledge in him.<br/>
<br/>

          <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.cde.ca.gov/standards/">http://www.cde.ca.gov/standards/</a><br/>
<br/>
The standards are in PDF documents, arranged by grade.<br/>
