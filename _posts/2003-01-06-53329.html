&lt;&lt; I guess I just lack confidence, not in my children, but in myself.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think this is an important point that shouldn&#39;t be overlooked.<br/>
In fact, I think it&#39;s the KEY to unschooling joyfully. Because what you just <br/>
said there, indicates just  how deep the damage goes in school.<br/>
I believe we are born confident. I believe that until school or parents break <br/>
a child down, they are confident in who they are.<br/>
Sure, there are degrees of confidence genetically. But children don&#39;t have a <br/>
problem with it until someone gives them a reason to not be confident.<br/>
<br/>
I think healing yourself is one of the most important things you can do.<br/>
Think about the things that make you feel joyful, passionate, happy. Were you <br/>
ever attracted to something that seemed hard to learn? Or that another person <br/>
dissuaded you from trying?<br/>
Did painting or singing or hiking or watching birds or astronomy or reading <br/>
Tarot cards or traveling somewhere exotic or eating a strange new food or.....<br/>
Did those things appeal to you at some point in your life?<br/>
I think tapping into your own passions, living exactly the life of your <br/>
choosing, is a HUGE part of healing yourself and giving your children a fine <br/>
example of joyful learning.<br/>
I wrote about this once when someone here asked what we hoped our children <br/>
would get from unschooling...maybe I can find it for you.<br/>
It might be at pensacolaunschoolers.com, but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, sometimes focusing on yourself can be a good way to get unschooling <br/>
off the ground so to speak.<br/>
I love the book &quot;Simple Abundance&quot; for tapping into your inner self better.<br/>
Find the things that you love and DO them, don&#39;t wait for your children to be <br/>
interested...just do it.<br/>
They will pick up your enthusiasm naturally.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a really hard thing to tell new unschoolers, too, who are all <br/>
frightened and anxious.  &quot;Ignore your kids a while, and just do what YOU want <br/>
to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t instil confidence, and makes them think we&#39;re nuts.<br/>
<br/>
When I write about deschooling, though, I try to make it things parents and <br/>
kids do together, hoping that somewhere in there the parents will have <br/>
lightbulb moments while they think they&#39;re doing something to/for their <br/>
child.  And they ARE doing things for their children and with them, but they <br/>
often start off feeling like the responsible adult, &quot;the teacher,&quot; and not <br/>
like just one of two (or three or four) humans experiencing something <br/>
interesting together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>May I add to this? It&#39;s my own pursuit of learning as an adult that <br/>
has caused me to put on the brakes about traditional learning in <br/>
schools. I found myself expecting of my kids what I know doesn&#39;t <br/>
work at all with me. That&#39;s how I got here.<br/>
<br/>
By urging moms to get invested in developing their own <br/>
passions and interests, by expanding their thoughts and <br/>
experiences, we give them a model that comes from inside... <br/>
and it&#39;s that that drove me to this list again.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning, my dh and I took the five out for breakfast and <br/>
talked about our best years of &quot;homeschool.&quot; The kids all quickly <br/>
recalled the years where I was hands-off and where they had <br/>
free reign of their learning (unschooling). I have undulated in <br/>
how  free I&#39;ve been due to lack of support and the encroaching <br/>
fears related to college. But today, both my dh and I felt free from <br/>
those fears.<br/>
<br/>
We shared with the kids that we were going to go back to that <br/>
way of learning only this time without fear. I used my personal <br/>
experience of studying art, U2, Hans Kung and African violet care <br/>
as examples of how my education has blossomed without <br/>
structure or accountability.<br/>
<br/>
Three of the five really caught fire. The other two (my pleasers) <br/>
both immediately felt that the freedom was too great and worry <br/>
that they will not meet requirements if left to themselves. Wow. <br/>
Humbling to think I had already damaged their sense of <br/>
personal responbility and self-trust.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, thank you for all the help yesterday. We&#39;ve jumped. <br/>
And my husband is fully on board. In fact, he kept saying last <br/>
night (into the wee hours) &quot;I don&#39;t want our kids to be brain dead <br/>
like all the freshmen I teach in college.&quot; He has weekly proof that <br/>
just because kids are prepared for college doesn&#39;t mean they <br/>
are learning anything or even want to be there.<br/>
<br/>
Btw, for those who are interested, a friend and I started a website <br/>
for women who want to talk about art, books, movies, and <br/>
anything else they are learning. It started out predominantly with <br/>
Christian homeschoolers, but we&#39;ve broadened some and are <br/>
eager for all kinds of women to join us. The forum is <br/>
non-sectarian and the emphasis is on the humanities not <br/>
religion. We are just over 200 users now.<br/>
