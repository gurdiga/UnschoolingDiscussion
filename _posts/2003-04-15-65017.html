<div id="ygrps-yiv-498991316">My question is mostly geared towards larger families, but I&#39;d love to hear <br/>
anyone&#39;s response.  My children are 12, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, and 6 months.  I find <br/>
it difficult to maintain peace and happiness without some sort of daily <br/>
rhythm.  Our &#39;schedules&#39; are not set in stone, but I came to unschooling <br/>
from a Waldorf perspective and we really enjoy the daily flow of having a <br/>
guiding rhythm.  I say we because I see that my children benefit from <br/>
knowing what to expect in general.  Examples would be, mealtimes, nap/quiet <br/>
times, bedtimes, etc.  We don&#39;t so much have a certain time set by the <br/>
clock, but we do follow an evening ritual of baths, songs, stories, bedtime. <br/>
  This may start at 6 in the evening or 8 in the evening, but we tend to <br/>
follow the same general path every night.  I find when we stray from this, <br/>
if I let them do their own thing and head off to bed whenever, they are all <br/>
quite fussy and we end up with a lot of fights.  (Not between the kids and I <br/>
but between the kids together.)<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter (12) is not so much involved in this process, aside from <br/>
mealtimes, etc.  After three years of listening to me rave about Harry <br/>
Potter, she stayed up all night and read the entire first book till 4 in the <br/>
morning.  (She came to me today and told me she read it but wanted it to be <br/>
a surprise.  She also asked for book 2, lol.) I&#39;ve never said anything more <br/>
than how much I loved it but she was over my shoulder this week reading <br/>
about the video games you all have been discussing.  Guess that sparked her <br/>
interest!<br/>
<br/>
My question is: Is it hindering to have such a daily rhythm?  If so, do you <br/>
have any suggestions in curbing the fighting and unhappiness that result <br/>
when no rhythm is involved?  Perhaps, had we not been doing this for so long <br/>
it might be different, but since we have been doing it for so long, I guess <br/>
it just seems natural to them.  On the rare occasion that I do hear a <br/>
compaint, such as nap/quiet time, I try to offer suggestions for things to <br/>
do, play outside (in this case they can be loud), quietly watch tv, play a <br/>
game, spend time with me cooking, reading, etc., etc.  The one thing I find <br/>
I must insist on is our daily quiet time.  If the older kids are loud in the <br/>
house while the boys and the baby nap, they don&#39;t sleep and end up being <br/>
extremely fussy throughout the rest of the day.  I&#39;m interested particularly <br/>
on any thoughts directly related to this situation.<br/>
<br/>
For us, the situation is working.  I just wonder what it looks like from an <br/>
unschooling perspective.<br/>
<br/>
Warm Wishes,<br/>

PS. Re: Dealing with family<br/>
I decided to write my grandmother the letter Sandra suggested and will send <br/>
it out as soon as it has the flavor I&#39;m looking for.  I&#39;m trying to strike a <br/>
level-headed tone, while making my feelings clear yet avoiding being rude.  <br/>
It is HARD!  We have decided to rent a van Easter weekend (hubby will be <br/>
home- yay!) and head off to Scarborough Faire for their Easter Bash.  Sounds <br/>
like so much fun and I won&#39;t have to deal with the family.  All around a <br/>
great deal!!!  Thanks for all your comments and support!<br/>

what you write.  I, too, wrote a really long and nice and deep letter to<br/>
my ILs when we were having the major problems with them.  I got a one<br/>
line e-mail back: &quot;Grow up!&quot;   I had really put only *I* feelings, etc.<br/>
in it and it was a wonderful wonderful letter telling them how much I<br/>
wanted them in our lives, and how and why we had come to the various<br/>
parenting decisions that we had come to.  The letter made them worse. <br/>
I&#39;m worried for you that you won&#39;t get your desired response.  It hurts<br/>
a lot.  Prepare yourself and I wish with everything in me that no one<br/>
has to deal with relatives that don&#39;t understand ever again.<br/>

quite fussy and we end up with a lot of fights.  (Not between the kids and I <br/>
but between the kids together.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only family I know that bit lately went from seven to nine, with a set of <br/>
twins.  What I&#39;ve seen them do is when babies are asleep other people get <br/>
quiet.  And they used to have (when they lived near enough for me to know) a <br/>
mom-and-dad bed (big enough for four or five &lt;g&gt;) and then a full room of <br/>
&quot;bed&quot;--mattresses all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
I know they&#39;ve ended up with a bigger house.  That was a three bedroom <br/>
apartment, when they had five kids.<br/>
<br/>
In the paragraph quoted up above it sounds like one thing and maybe it wasn&#39;t <br/>
what you really meant.  It sounds like you&#39;re saying if anyone fails to <br/>
follow the routin, everyone will be fussy.  Isn&#39;t it possible to tell the <br/>
older ones they can stay up if they can be extra aware to be kind and patient <br/>
the next day, and if they&#39;re too cranky they need to get more sleep?  That&#39;s <br/>
how we made deals about letting a kid stay up really late when he was little. <br/>
 &quot;Okay, but count back from when you have to get up, and if you are too tired <br/>
tomorrow, be careful not to take it out on other people.  It wasn&#39;t their <br/>
fault you stayed up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The one thing I find <br/>
I must insist on is our daily quiet time.  If the older kids are loud in the <br/>
house while the boys and the baby nap, they don&#39;t sleep and end up being <br/>
extremely fussy throughout the rest of the day.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That makes total sense to me.  <br/>
<br/>
Our quiet time is pretty much from 10:30 at night until noon.   People can <br/>
watch TV if it&#39;s turned down low, or go in and out of the house, but they&#39;re <br/>
reminded to close the door really quietly.  We try not to tell people to call <br/>
us in the morning; we call them instead.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not an absolute silence, it&#39;s a courtesy.  After noon, if someone&#39;s <br/>
still asleep that&#39;s okay, but other don&#39;t have to be as quiet.  <br/>
<br/>
For a while we had a &quot;be in bed before 5:00 a.m. and get up before noon.&quot;  I <br/>
was doing that because it seemed to really bug my husband if a boy was still <br/>
up on the computer when he left for work at 5:30 a.m. (and it varies) and if <br/>
someone was asleep when he came home, sometimes at 1:30 or 2:00.<br/>
<br/>
Then after about a year or more of that &quot;rule,&quot; Marty said something about it <br/>
to Keith who said he didn&#39;t really care.<br/>
<br/>
What changed was Keith saw more and more of how much the boys were learning <br/>
and how well they were getting along.<br/>
<br/>
So it was gradual, even with all that.<br/>
<br/>
But we only have three kids, and they&#39;re fairly closely grouped.  Less than <br/>
five and a half years from #1 to #3.   So my situation&#39;s too easy to compare.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For us, the situation is working.  I just wonder what it looks like from an <br/>
unschooling perspective.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a point where too many rules and too much schedule is a <br/>
hindrance.  When it&#39;s purely arbitrary and the child&#39;s interests and needs <br/>
aren&#39;t considered, I think that&#39;s harmful.<br/>
<br/>
But all the luxury stuff about flexibility and food freedom and all that <br/>
isn&#39;t directly what is or isn&#39;t unschooling.  I think it can be a by-product. <br/>
 With my family, most of that came first (TV freedom, very lax bedtime, food <br/>
not regulated, no dessert-training) and that made unschooling a snap.   And <br/>
some start with unschooling and pick up some oft he other stuff (or rather <br/>
let it fall).  But that&#39;s not what makes or breaks unschooling.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has to deal with relatives that don&#39;t understand ever again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ouch.  You know, it didn&#39;t really cross my mind that I was looking <br/>
for a specific response, but, you know, I AM!  I really though I was <br/>
looking at this as something for HER.  Something to do to get it off <br/>
my chest.  Maybe that sounds the same.  Put this way, the way you <br/>
wrote it, it sounds completely different to me.  It is so hard to <br/>
know what approach to use.  <br/>
<br/>
I now recall a time when we had a disagreement over something <br/>
regarding my oldest daughter (don&#39;t even recall the specifics now, <br/>
something to do with homeschooling, but..)and I told her that these <br/>
were MY decisions to make and that I was doing what I thought was <br/>
best for my daughter and for my family.  Her response was that they <br/>
are NOT my decisions.  That I&#39;m hurting my children every day.  It <br/>
went on and on.  In front of the kids.  It seems like it was only <br/>
days after the birth of my last baby, I&#39;m honestly not sure, <br/>
though.  She just jumped up and left, slamming the door behind her.  <br/>
The kids were all mad at ME because they were supposed to go to her <br/>
house that day.  <br/>
<br/>
Now that I think about all this, I see where my hesitation comes <br/>
in.  When I started this thread, I was trying to include everything <br/>
needed for background type info but didn&#39;t even remember all this.  <br/>
I often feel as though I&#39;m stuck in the middle.  Only in the past <br/>
year or two has my oldest daughter realized what really goes on <br/>
between us. (Gm and me.)  But the little ones see ME as being the <br/>
bad guy.  <br/>
<br/>
She called today and talked to my 6 yr old,  (I was in the shower at <br/>
the time) to invite us over for Easter dinner.  Nic told her we were <br/>
going to have fun that day and told her of our plans.  For me, right <br/>
now, it is easier to have an alternative to seeing her as an excuse <br/>
not to go over.  They just don&#39;t see the problems that are there and <br/>
I usually end up with the bad rap in the end because of it.  I just <br/>
hope I come to a place of comfort in this soon, as we are heading <br/>
into birthday alley (all the kids birthdays start one after another <br/>
until Sept.)and I dread how we will handle the invitation list to <br/>
the parties if I can&#39;t get through to my grandmother before that <br/>
time comes.   I could even deal with an agree to disagree type of <br/>
situation but slapping my child&#39;s hand is not something I can agree <br/>
to disagree with.  We shall see....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your comments.  It is wonderful to have other ideas <br/>
to pour over while dealing with this.  It might not be so bad if I <br/>
actually thought it would all work out, but my fear is that nothing <br/>
will ever change and I will be forced to choose excluding her from <br/>
our lives for the kids safety and my sanity.  You&#39;d think it would <br/>
be a simple matter, but emotionally, for me, it is rocking me to the <br/>
core.<br/>

children over there again.  I agree with that.  How old are your children? In <br/>
your last post you sounded almost like the children are not affected by the <br/>
unschooling/homeschooling comments as much as you are.  Like they were upset <br/>
with you for &quot;spoiling the fun with grandma&quot; so to speak.  I don&#39;t remember <br/>
how old they are but maybe if you addressed the hitting issue with her and <br/>
talked with them about if they want you to address the homeschooling issue or <br/>
not.  Maybe they are willing to put up with a few off the wall comments to <br/>
spend time with her.  As long as they know they have a safe place to come <br/>
vent.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are 12, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, and 6 months.  You are absolutely <br/>
right!  They do get upset with me for &#39;spoiling the fun&quot;.  That is <br/>
exactly what I was trying to say.  My 12 year old does understand <br/>
the homeschooling/unschooling comments and takes them in stride.  <br/>
She believes what we are doing is best for her, so she doesn&#39;t pay <br/>
much attention to what my grandmother says, unless she has a <br/>
wuestion for me about it, which we talk through together.<br/>
<br/>
The other kids (really only my 6 yr old) are only affected by her <br/>
comments of how much fun it would be to go to ps.  Those issues are <br/>
easily dealt with.  Ususally though, they really don&#39;t pay much <br/>
attention to the comments, so they end up upset with me when <br/>
something bad happens...like gramma leaving in a huff or them not <br/>
being able to go to her house.  I do my best to explain to them when <br/>
something bad happens between my grandmother and me but it is <br/>
difficult for thm to understand why they can&#39;t go over there <br/>
anyway.  This sounds bad, but thankfully, she hasn&#39;t wanted to <br/>
invite them over because her dog had surgery, so lately it hasn&#39;t <br/>
been too much of an issue.  Also, in this sense, it actually helps <br/>
to not have a car! There&#39;s just not much of a choice as to whether <br/>
or not we get to go over there.  Hope that makes sense.<br/>

&gt; YIKES!  They really didn&#39;t bite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt; The only family I know that BIG lately went from seven to nine, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>with a set <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of <br/>
&gt; twins.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ROFL!!  That is so funny!  I had to re-read that sentence about a <br/>
million times and it still didn&#39;t quite click for me.  I&#39;ve had a <br/>
biting problem with my boys lately and was wondering if I had posted <br/>
about it without realizing it.  I was just so confused!  Thanks for <br/>
clarifying!<br/>
