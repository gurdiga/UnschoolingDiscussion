&lt;&lt; Hi, sorry i haven&#39;t been around.  my computer BLEW itself up last week.  <br/>
i&#39;m on my brothers computer now, so don&#39;t have time to go into details... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry Tracy.  <br/>
<br/>
Mine had a corrupted font.  And so it wouldn&#39;t work at all.<br/>
Can you imagine &quot;corrupted font&quot; could totally put a computer out of <br/>
commission?  It&#39;s like dying of a hangnail.<br/>
<br/>
So after talking a long time to an Apple tech in Canada, and three calls to <br/>
AOL techs in India (who were way quicker and more patient than any I had ever <br/>
dealt with in Albuquerque or Virginia) for three separate questions of getting <br/>
all THAT hooked up...<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m back but am too busy to BE back because (tadaa!!) Brenda and Tim is <br/>
here and we&#39;re alternately out and about and home being too hot and tired to be <br/>
out and about.<br/>
And Holly wants me to finish some pants I&#39;m making her, and Maybe make her a <br/>
shirt and I need to find something important and secret for Kirby&#39;s birthday, <br/>
so we&#39;re &quot;doing the mall&quot; in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
