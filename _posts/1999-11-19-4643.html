Subject: Immunization question<br/>
&lt;SNIP&gt;  Does anyone know of alternatives to the tetanus vaccine? <br/>
<br/>
	According to a medical text I read, the most important preventive is<br/>
&quot;proper cleansing of the wound.&quot; Tetanus is an anaerobic bacteria, which<br/>
grows in deep wounds that heal from the top down. It cannot grow in an<br/>
open wound--one that is healing from the bottom up. Therefore, proper<br/>
wound care is essential.<br/>
	Make sure any deep- or puncture wounds are cleaned thoroughly, and<br/>
monitor them for any sign of redness, swelling or excessive tenderness.<br/>
If any of those symptoms appear, soak in a hot epsom salt solution. <br/>
	I once had blood poisoning, and no access to medical care. Using only a<br/>
$1 carton of epsom salts, and a lot of hot water, I treated the wound,<br/>
and could see the red line diminish. There were no side-effects,<br/>
after-effects, or medical interventions necessary.<br/>
	In addition, I have had excellent results with a topical application of<br/>
a paste made from cosmetic quality green clay--obtained from a natural<br/>
food store. As the clay dries, it draws out the moisture and toxins from<br/>
the wound. It has prevented the necessity of antibiotics more than once.<br/>
	There is, I believe, a homeopathic remedy for tetanus, also. <br/>
	In my family, we don&#39;t worry about tetanus; we just treat all wounds<br/>
appropriately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203832964">H2O2 i.e. Hydrogen peroxide is useful (diluted 1:1 with water) in cleansing deep<br/>
wounds.  It is anaerobic unfriendly.<br/>
