<br/>
I have a question for you all, but 1st a quick background.<br/>
We are Catholic. So either religious education happens in the parish <br/>
school setting or in religious education classes (Sunday School) for <br/>
kids not in attending a Catholic school. Josh (13) has had First <br/>
Communion and Confirmation so he&#39;s not on anyones radar (He would not go <br/>
anyway because of his whole reading issue) for needing to attend RE, but <br/>
I still think he needs to be catechized.<br/>
What&#39;s the problem?<br/>
Well in the last few years as we have slowly embraced a totally <br/>
unschooling life he has pretty much made it clear that he&#39;s not <br/>
interested in doing anything that has to do with religion or faith: no <br/>
rosary, no saint stories, no daily readings, no prayer time and he <br/>
really, really does not want to go to Mass. This means that for about <br/>
the last year I&#39;ve pretty much stopped everything except Mass attendance <br/>
(and really that&#39;s because his father insists that he goes).<br/>
~gah~<br/>
I&#39;m just in such a quandary. I want to pass on the deposit of Faith, but <br/>
I don&#39;t want to force the issue---it goes against everything I believe <br/>
about being radical unschoolers.<br/>
But I feel like he should know these things so he can make an informed <br/>
choice as he gets older.<br/>
Has anyone else felt this way? How have you worked it out?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s the problem right there.  Deciding what YOU think he needs, <br/>
rather than listening to him telling you clearly that it&#39;s not what <br/>
he needs right now, and is not what he wants right now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want to pass on the deposit of Faith, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The best foundation you can give your children, in my opinion, when <br/>
it comes to faith or religion (not the same things) is to honestly <br/>
share with them (when they ask for it) your own beliefs and <br/>
principles and be an illustration of someone happy and fulfilled in <br/>
their faith in yourself.  There is no way to guarantee that they <br/>
will share your faith as adults, (I wouldn&#39;t want to guarantee that <br/>
anyway even if I could) but the more you make it an issue the less <br/>
likely they are to want to share with you whatever their beliefs <br/>
might end up being.  The best way, again in my opinion and <br/>
experience, to drive a child in the opposite direction of whatever <br/>
your beliefs are is to push your religion down their throats and be <br/>
negative, deragatory and dismissive of their thoughts and <br/>
explorations in areas that are not your faith.<br/>

I was born into a Catholic family (both parents raised Catholic) and baptised at a very young age.  My parents divorced, and we lived with my mother who chose not to attend church.  At around age 10, I started to attend a neighborhood church and was born again.  I went to Bible camp for several summers and was a believer for a number of years.  I never could convince anyone else in the family to attend with me.<br/>
<br/>
I am now at least agnostic, if not athiest.  At any rate, I do not believe in a &quot;father&quot; god.  My younger brother, who did not attend church as a child (except very sporadically) is now an evangelical Christian, highly involved in his church and sending his child to a private Christian school.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that everyone makes their own choice at one point or another.  If you *live* your religious beliefs, that will be enough for your children to decide whether your way is their way, or not.<br/>

My family is Jewish. My kids have always known that I think it&#39;s important<br/>
to know about your heritage, but they&#39;ve had the choice about their own<br/>
lives. Zoe chose to attend religious school all along, become Bat Mitzvah,<br/>
the whole schmear. She&#39;ll even be confirmed and graduate next year. My son,<br/>
Quinn, went to three classes around 4th grade, the teacher was<br/>
condescending, he never went back. Every once and a while, he brings up the<br/>
idea of doing it again, but still has never chosen it.<br/>

at least the basics just by osmosis.  It is no different than kids whose <br/>
parents are farmers know the basics of animal reproduction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree. I was raised Roman Catholic with all the associated &quot;rites of<br/>
passage,&quot; and as an adult I drifted mostly away from the church, and<br/>
once the guilt of doing that left me (Catholics are so good at guilt),<br/>
I stayed away from church altogether for a while. <br/>
<br/>
For the past year and a half my husband, 5-yr-old son and I have<br/>
attended a Unitarian Universalist church. We feel that we are home.<br/>
Love it. Andy is signed up for their first-ever week-long Vacation RE<br/>
Camp in August, which will involve 3 hours each day of singing,<br/>
activities, guest speakers, art, blah blah. He made the choice to sign<br/>
up for it; I&#39;ll take him and hang out there, and he can participate as<br/>
he chooses. And if he changes his mind about going, he won&#39;t go. <br/>
<br/>
This fall he&#39;ll be old enough to attend the RE classes on Sunday<br/>
mornings. I have a feeling he may prefer to stay in the playroom<br/>
instead. I am not going to force him to go to a class, and I will<br/>
offer to go with him if he wants to check it out. <br/>
<br/>
Even if he doesn&#39;t attend any classes, our church regularly discusses<br/>
world religions and different belief systems and encourages tolerance<br/>
and respect. So he&#39;s picking up on that, and already getting a base of<br/>
information about different choices and directions. <br/>
<br/>
We live our beliefs each day, and just by being around people at<br/>
church and talking with them and interacting with them, Andy is<br/>
exposed to them too. If he dispenses with any formality of church in<br/>
the future, it&#39;s the formality going, not the forming of what was and<br/>
is already inside him. <br/>

<br/>
Church is certainly not the only place he can learn about &quot;these<br/>
things&quot; such as faith, spirituality and traditions.  In fact, if he is<br/>
there against his will, church is not even close to the *best* place<br/>
to learn about these things.<br/>
<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t choose to go to church right now, either.  I really<br/>
can&#39;t blame him -- compared to our lives, even our small, welcoming<br/>
church and its friendly, Montessori-based Sunday School is pretty<br/>
restrictive.  Sure, they have a &quot;response time&quot; free time after the<br/>
story, where they can play music or draw or play with the story<br/>
figures, but it&#39;s not like he could whip out his GameBoy or anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So while he sits on the couch playing his GameBoy, we have some great<br/>
discussions.  He asked me a few months ago where &quot;everything&quot; came<br/>
from, so we had a fabulous discussion about different theories and<br/>
beliefs on that.  We&#39;ve talked about stories about Jesus and Buddha<br/>
and, when my friend who is an interfaith minister was over, Rama and<br/>
some of the trickster spirits in Native American faiths, too. <br/>
Sometimes my sonis actively involved in these dialogues, and sometimes<br/>
he&#39;s just nearby, popping in with a question here and there.<br/>
<br/>
From a few casual ideas of mine, he&#39;s created small but elaborate<br/>
little rituals to help himself dream peacefully at night.  When he<br/>
does something kind and giving for someone else, it&#39;s because it is<br/>
his choice, and not a service project dictated to him by others.<br/>
<br/>
I have no doubt that he is gaining the spiritual tools that he needs,<br/>
in the way and at the time that he needs them.<br/>
<br/>
Even my MIL, one of the most religious people I know, did not force<br/>
her son (my husband) to attend church with her when he was an older<br/>
child and a teenager.<br/>
<br/>
She and I agreed that if you force someone to go to church, they will<br/>
only learn to hate what is supposed to a place of love, joy, and<br/>
invitation.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
