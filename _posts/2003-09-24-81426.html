<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094156879">Please help me and my daughter. She is convinced that she <br/>
needs algebra because all her friends are studying it and she <br/>
wants to go to college. I don&#39;t mind her learning it and I don&#39;t <br/>
mind her studying with a text book if that&#39;s her choice. However, <br/>
she has zero interst in math and consequently retains nothing. <br/>
So when she does twelve (no exaggeration) workbooks of <br/>
fractions (pre-unschooling days) and encounters combining <br/>
fractions in her algebra book, she doesn&#39;t remember how to do <br/>
them. When I show her on paper to remind her how they are <br/>
done, she says she gets it and then proceeds to get every single <br/>
problem wrong on the page (30 problems) and doesn&#39;t even ask <br/>
herself if she&#39;s doing them right or not.<br/>
<br/>
My husband said it&#39;s like pouring water into sand. Nothing is <br/>
sticking.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the frustrating part. I don&#39;t give a rip if she does algebra. <br/>
She&#39;s clearly not ready for it and she uses me as a place to pour <br/>
her irritation and resentment about having to study math when I <br/>
offer help. I have no intention of being used as the target for her <br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
I told her that she clearly only cares about &quot;getting through&quot; the <br/>
algebra and that that is no way to learn math. It won&#39;t even work. <br/>
Every part of math builds on retaining the previous part. Like a <br/>
foreign language.<br/>
<br/>
But she won&#39;t give it up. So what do I do? Do I continue to spend <br/>
my time an hour a day going through math that I don&#39;t enjoy with <br/>
someone who isn&#39;t really learning it but thinks she&#39;s getting <br/>
through it? We have the teaching co. videos of algebra I which <br/>
are really good. But I&#39;m the one learning, not her.<br/>
<br/>
Help!<br/>

again but she doesn&#39;t want to hear it. It bugs her that her friends <br/>
are doing algebra and that she isn&#39;t ro wouldn&#39;t be. I also think <br/>
it&#39;s less an issue of &quot;gettingit&quot; and more a lack of genuine <br/>
interest. She is clearly only doing the math for the sake of <br/>
fulfilling requirements. If she were getting it, fine. But since she <br/>
is not, it&#39;s like driving a truck without an accelerator--lots and lots <br/>
of pushing.<br/>
<br/>
I think watching videos is a good idea too (like Sandra said) but <br/>
she doesn&#39;t seem to believe me that that is the same thing as <br/>
taking a course called algebra. Grrr. It irritates me that there are <br/>
these things called college admissions requirements...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m taking a deep breath here before I say anything slightly resembling MATH <br/>
advice (from past experience) but we are going through the same thing here at <br/>
my house.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter says (sometimes very loudly) that she WANTS to learn this.  I <br/>
have no interest in the math as a MATH, I&#39;ve tried, I really have.  I struggled <br/>
through it in HS and College but I hated every second of it, cried often in <br/>
fact because the concepts so made no sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I could GET answers in my head but couldn&#39;t put down the steps on paper which <br/>
is what every single teacher DEMANDED be done.  I guess if you got it right, <br/>
even in front of them, in your HEAD it was cheating somehow.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten some of the computer games some on the list recommended.  She <br/>
likes them, she plays them.  But she wants that BOOK algebra, that big ugly book <br/>
that practically gives me the shakes to think about.<br/>
<br/>
She just thinks I don&#39;t really care about her learning this. <br/>
<br/>
Currently this is my solution, I got one of those very fancy (and expensive) <br/>
calculators.  We looked at the very thick booklet that comes with it.  We had <br/>
to learn how to use the thing, but any algebra problem she can find can be <br/>
solved by the calculator thus far.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, she&#39;s thinking that the calculator is cool, way less stress, the <br/>
same answer and not remembering things that really make no sense to her right <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m really happy that there are not all these moments of <br/>
frustration, anger and tears over something that I can&#39;t help her conquer.  She has <br/>
thought about taking an Algebra class but hasn&#39;t really made up her mind yet if <br/>
that&#39;s a good thing or not.<br/>
<br/>
While the calculator is the only suggestion that I can offer you, I do <br/>
understand how frustrating this is and how unhappy it can make a child that isn&#39;t <br/>
grasping or retaining the concepts.<br/>
<br/>
Cait would look at something we&#39;d worked on and say &quot;YEAH I get it!&quot; and then <br/>
proceed, just like your daughter to get all the problems wrong. <br/>
<br/>
We did order a book from Amazon last week that was recommended here about <br/>
math, but it&#39;s a story type book not figures and such I believe, we haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten it yet.  Maybe if she sees it in a way besides figures she might have some <br/>
awakening that she is looking for.<br/>
<br/>
Best of luck to you, I so understand how you feel.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433045712">Carl and Kat are going through Painless Algebra and they both really like<br/>
her style of writing and the problems. I&#39;ve only seen one problem so far<br/>
that involved fractions. All the rest have been whole numbers so the focus<br/>
is on the patterns and not the arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s also written a Painless Geometry book. (But not the other Painless<br/>
books in the series.)<br/>
<br/>
(BTW, there&#39;s a Painless Fraction book too, but no guarantee that it&#39;s<br/>
written as friendly.)<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t much like the style of Algebra Unplugged since neither of them<br/>
has albegra phobia. Carl said he was doing too much editing reading it to<br/>
Kat to cut out the reassurances that it&#39;s okay to not like math. But that<br/>
might be just what your daughter needs!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-224345368">My 13 yo dd goes through this sometimes too - the &quot;I gotta learn <br/>
algebra&quot; phase - because of a ps friend who is highly gifted in math and <br/>
science.  I got her the type of algebra book she said she wanted, told <br/>
her I&#39;d help if she needed it. After a couple of weeks of frustration - <br/>
not because she couldn&#39;t do it, but because she found it boring - we sat <br/>
down and talked. We discussed why she wanted to do it - and it was <br/>
because of her friend and she felt like she was &quot;behind&quot;. We talked <br/>
about where she wants to go, and how she can get there. She wants to be, <br/>
probably an actress, maybe a cartoonist (animator, creator, writer), or <br/>
television journalist. She probably wants to go to college. I pointed <br/>
out that she could wait until she&#39;s 16, take algebra at the community <br/>
college. Why waste time now, if she has other things to do, and this, <br/>
which she isn&#39;t really interested in, can wait? We also talked about <br/>
using math in everyday life. --- she likes to cook, play board games, <br/>
use the computer, put up websites, art -- she uses plenty of math, is <br/>
comfortable with arithmetic, etc. I&#39;m a former math teacher, and as far <br/>
as I can see, she&#39;s doing fine. Some 13 yo&#39;s are taking a watered down <br/>
algebra in school, most are still slogging through arithmetic and hating <br/>
it. When I taught algebra, the biggest problem was weak arithmetic, not <br/>
the algebra itself. And arithmetic is much better remembered when it&#39;s <br/>
used and it makes sense - when the person understands it and gets it - <br/>
and not from remembering steps without really knowing what you&#39;re doing. <br/>
Arithmetic out of workbooks is a convenient way to teach a roomful of <br/>
kids, but not the best way to learn or understand math... imho.<br/>
<br/>
Getting her to look at what she wants, long term and short term, and <br/>
looking for alternatives to working through a textbook on her own, <br/>
worked for us.<br/>

&lt;&lt;She is convinced that she needs algebra because all her friends are<br/>

<br/>
How long has she been out of school?  This sounds like maybe she needs<br/>
some more deschooling time.  My younger son took to unschooling like a<br/>
duck to water, but my older one was very programmed by school (took him<br/>
out in 5th grade) to think things had to be done a &#39;schoolish&#39; way to<br/>
count.  Took 22 months to get past that--not that anyone was counting<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Might it help to explain that algebra is, in essence, just a method of<br/>
working with variables, and point out how she does that already in real<br/>
life?  <br/>
<br/>
Does she normally learn new things from books, on her own, from watching<br/>
others, computer programs, or other methods?  Providing a resource that<br/>
fits with her normal way of learning might help.  So, if she learns by<br/>
watching others, you can talk about figuring out answers as you do<br/>
things, where you don&#39;t have all the information and a variety of<br/>
possibilities exist.  From your description of what happened with the<br/>
workbooks, I would guess she at least needs her math in real-life<br/>
situations for it to sink in at this stage of her life.<br/>
<br/>
Ask her where she thinks she would need algebra, and together maybe you<br/>
can come up with situations in which she would be personally motivated<br/>
to stick with it until it makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
A pair of books I didn&#39;t see mentioned are _Elementary Algebra_ and<br/>
_Mathematics:  A Human Affair_ by Harold Jacobs.  Both are textbook<br/>
style, but you can do or ignore the exercises of course.  He brings a<br/>
sense of humor and wonderfully creative ways of illustrating the way<br/>
math really works.  Each chapter begins with an illustration from<br/>
classic comics or literature, or something drawn for the book, with a<br/>
reference to the material coming up in that chapter.  It&#39;s really good<br/>
stuff, books we all enjoyed, and I hope my own daughter will dive into<br/>
at some point--but she&#39;s much more inclined toward &#39;unventing&#39; things<br/>
her own way.<br/>
<br/>
What would be the consequences of allowing her to work through this on<br/>
her own?  I can&#39;t see myself sitting down an hour a day to relearn<br/>
algebra that I don&#39;t need and don&#39;t want because my child wants that, if<br/>
it&#39;s not doing any good.  With my own kids, I&#39;d have been inclined to<br/>
provide resources, then be a resource if I knew enough, but not sit down<br/>
with them unless I wanted to work on the same subject matter, but that<br/>
was my situation--I don&#39;t know yours.<br/>
<br/>
Reading and rereading your post, I get the sense that she hasn&#39;t been<br/>
out of school very long (or, possibly, you haven&#39;t been unschooling very<br/>
long), and she hasn&#39;t found her self-learning legs yet.  I wonder, does<br/>
she volunteer or work for money anywhere?  That really helped my kids at<br/>
that age.<br/>
<br/>
Just some random thoughts :)  Maybe you can share some of these posts<br/>
with your daughter and see what she thinks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-128944551">Hi Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if you saw my post earlier. She did all the Key to <br/>
books except Geometry. She&#39;s done the entire Algebra set so <br/>
imagine my shock when she can&#39;t recognize any of the ideas this <br/>
time around!<br/>
<br/>
We were told that the Keys to Algebra just wasn&#39;t enough <br/>
preparation for college admissions testing. I used it to prep her <br/>
so that she&#39;d be ready for a more typical Algebra program, but <br/>
apparently that didn&#39;t work in her case. (She did all the decimal, <br/>
fraction and percent books and measurement!)<br/>
<br/>
Grrr.<br/>
<br/>
Worked great for my sons.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to look for Painless Algebra (thanks Joyce!) to <br/>
supplement the Saxon book and CD we have and take it very <br/>
slowly. We&#39;ll keep listening to the videos by Teaching Co. too. <br/>
One of my math friends here told me to simply do two problems <br/>
at a time and then check to see if she&#39;s getting it. She also <br/>
suggested keeping notecards of any rules she needs as she <br/>
goes so she can always refer back to how to do problems. I like <br/>
that idea a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep you posted.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>

classes at the local high school because she felt gypped that <br/>
she&#39;s never experienced what everyone in the world has. It&#39;s <br/>
been a good experience because she is seeing firsthand just <br/>
how the system works and she is finding out she doesn&#39;t like it!<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like maybe she needs<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; some more deschooling time. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s one of two in our home who freaked when we moved from <br/>
homeschooling to unschooling. She thought we might miss a <br/>
requirement. We have never been &quot;school at home&quot; types (we <br/>
were what I&#39;d call relaxed or eclectic homeschoolers until this <br/>
list). And she loves having control over her life and learning <br/>
(she&#39;s written two novels, has prepared and acted Shakespeare <br/>
scenes for fun, she writes poetry, and she spends a huge <br/>
amount of time and energy on her friendships through email, <br/>
blurtys and IM). She also loves to watch movies over and over. <br/>
And her reading list would shame most college English majors <br/>
(she reads classics, modern, everythingall her own goals and <br/>
choices).<br/>
<br/>
I think what is happening is that her peer group of <br/>
homeschoolers are &quot;school-at-home&quot; types and she compares <br/>
our life to theirs and worries that we aren&#39;t being conscientious. <br/>
She&#39;s beginning to see that this isn&#39;t so, but she is also nervous <br/>
about her weaknesses.<br/>

 My younger son took to unschooling like a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>counting<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

We began radical unschooling last January.<br/>

I wish she could design a survey to see how much math most adults <br/>
remember and compare that to how much math they studied formally.  My <br/>
theory is that most of what her peers are learning is going to evaporate <br/>
out of their brains pretty darn soon.<br/>
<br/>
You could strew her path with some books about the psychology of <br/>
learning.  I&#39;m thinking The Book of Learning and Forgetting and Punished <br/>
by Rewards.  (Just the section in the latter book about Kohn meeting <br/>
Skinner was really fascinating.  And it fits in with our recent <br/>
discussion about whether human beings have free choice.)<br/>

if she REALLY needs a problem solved that is beyond her comfort level, there <br/>
are OTHER ways of getting the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday she was happily using the calculator to solve some algebra problems <br/>
then checking the answers in the back of the book and finding herself RIGHT <br/>
so it did build some confidence that algebra can be approached from different <br/>
directions.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter told Cait of a story of a teacher she had in fourth grade.  <br/>
Sarah was having trouble with the times tables which everyone else seemed to <br/>
know or was whizzing through learning and she was frustrated.  Her very cool <br/>
teacher told her not to worry about it and gave her this chart to tape to her <br/>
desk.  He said he was a teacher and didn&#39;t know all of his YET!  He said it <br/>
wasn&#39;t necessary to just memorize anything for the sake of memorizing, that <br/>
wasn&#39;t learning.<br/>
<br/>
So today, she&#39;s happier or at least not dwelling on what she thinks she CAN&#39;T <br/>
learn and being frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m waiting on some of these books I&#39;ve ordered to come, maybe she&#39;ll enjoy <br/>
something she finds in one of them.<br/>

the same thing also, that it&#39;s not enough for college interest.  My oldest at <br/>

with the guy explaining each section before you do the lesson.  Cool, because <br/>
we can rewind it repeatedly until it sinks in and we understand it (I&#39;m <br/>
trying to follow along too).  If my other kids decide to pursue any higher math <br/>
after the Key To books (if they even decide to finish them), I think I&#39;ll get the <br/>
Algebra I and Geometry from Math U See too. <br/>
