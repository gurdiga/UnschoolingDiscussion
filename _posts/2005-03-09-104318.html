half-assed isn&#39;t good enough. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, can you give a quick list of what you consider &quot;full-assed&quot; unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Every now and again, it helps to read the principles spelled out in a reduced form, if you <br/>
don&#39;t mind. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

-------------------<br/>
 <br/>
No, I can&#39;t.  It&#39;s everything that anyone would come to attempt to do  to <br/>
make unschooling work from the time they hear of it to the time their kids  leave <br/>
home.  You summarize it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My best summary is here:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling_">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling)">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling)</a> <br/>
 <br/>
but you need to read ALL the links.<br/>
