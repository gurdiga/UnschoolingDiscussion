More pertinent factors are probably what state you live in as well as &quot;who&quot;  you<br/>
are and &quot;who&quot;  the intruder is.   In some regions the &quot;law&quot;  even makes a<br/>
distinction as to what time of day (night) it is!<br/>
<br/>
Oft times if someone feels they are honestly defending their life or especially<br/>
the life of their family,  then technicalities of what the &quot;law&quot; says may well<br/>
take a back seat.<br/>

<br/>
I forgot to say that setting a trap with a gun is WAY illegal and you&#39;ll be <br/>
prosecuted quickly for that.  Like setting a gun to go off when a door is <br/>
opened or something is never okay, apparently.  I asked my husband what the <br/>
deal on that is and he said it&#39;s illegal to set a mantrap.  That once a guy <br/>
wired up some bedsprings under a skylight that opened, because he knew <br/>
someone was planning to break in that way.  He electrified the bedsprings, <br/>
the guy came in and died and it was called manslaughter or murder, but for <br/>
mitigating circumstances the guy was just on probation, BUT because of that, <br/>
it changed the laws.  That&#39;s his memory, maybe faulty, and he says he thinks <br/>
it was in Florida.<br/>
<br/>
The joke here is if you kill a guy in the yard, drag him into the house.  It <br/>
might not be a joke if the investigating officers consider it to have been <br/>
totally justifiable and can just state that they found the body in X place.<br/>
<br/>
We have a friend who was a cop, female.  She quit.  But when she was still <br/>
there, a man had been shot and killed by his wife or ex wife.  She killed him <br/>
because he was molesting their daughter.  He had molested  other girls, and <br/>
he knew the wife had a gun, and so the investigators just wrote on their <br/>
paper &quot;suicide&quot; and the mom wasn&#39;t even charged.<br/>

I&#39;ve never heard &quot;responsible force&quot; in any context.  It might be local to <br/>
where Lynda is.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody who has killed another person will just get a warning.   There will be <br/>
an investigation for definite sure.  If you&#39;re in the right, there&#39;s nothing <br/>
to warn you about and it is NOT luck of the draw, it&#39;s the judgment of the <br/>

What law?<br/>
<br/>
Are you in New Mexico?<br/>
There isn&#39;t a federal law, so you need to specify what you&#39;re talking about.<br/>

There&#39;s a deal with policemen locally for their own purposes which is that <br/>
they use the minimum force necessary to insure compliance.  That means if <br/>
holding a guy down would have sufficed, they shouldn&#39;t hit him (and on up the <br/>
line).<br/>
<br/>

tonight who knows lots about firearms laws and says in New Mexico (unlike <br/>
Texas and Arizona which are more complex) if you believe a person means to do <br/>
you harm and he&#39;s coming toward you and you don&#39;t believe you can reasonably <br/>
and safely escape, you can shoot him.  Not just inside your house.  And your <br/>
car is considered real property, he said, so if someone tries to force his <br/>
way into your car, it&#39;s like your house.  Shooting someone in the back would <br/>
be Very Bad, as he&#39;s not approaching, he&#39;s leaving.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is inaccurate information. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
As to my statement about &quot;reasonable force,&quot; you have contradicted yourself<br/>
in that you say your friend told you &quot;reasonably&quot; which is the exact same<br/>
thing I just said.  Is your friend a cop?  I would suggest that you go and<br/>
ask a cop instead of doing a he said/she said thing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have done amicus curea in 47 states and have done ex-offender work<br/>
in 49 states.  I generally keep up on what is what in each state.  NM is one<br/>
of the states I have worked with prisoners and the courts on various issues.<br/>

It is obvious to me you answered this simply for the sake of arguing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668497220">The problem with the law is that while it was set up in the U.S. to be<br/>
&quot;innocent until proven guilty,&quot; it is in all actuality the reverse.<br/>
Generally speaking judges do whatever they please and a good percentage of<br/>
those who draw jury duty shouldn&#39;t be allowed out without a leash.  A lot of<br/>
the lawyers you wouldn&#39;t want to represent you in a $5 parking ticket matter<br/>
let along a capital case.  Lawyers sleep through cases, come to court<br/>
hungover and sometimes drunk.<br/>
<br/>
And juvenile courts are quite frequently the worst of the worst.  Judges cut<br/>
kids loose that should be locked up for life and hand out max sentences<br/>
where even the prosecution thought they didn&#39;t have enough to win the case.<br/>
<br/>
And heaven forbid that we expect them to follow anything that resembles a<br/>
line of logic or reason.  Some of the more current homeschooling cases are<br/>
good examples of that!<br/>
