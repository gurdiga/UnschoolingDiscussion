&gt;I disagree.  Everything IS educational, whether we see the value or<br/>
&gt;not.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the problem stems from the use of the word &quot;educational&quot; to<br/>
&gt;only apply to certain types of things.  We need to break out of that<br/>
&gt;box IMHO.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651099993">Hello Faith,<br/>
glad you found the list... we need more teen parents here :-).<br/>
I have a 15 yr old daughter and there are several others here with teens (boys and girls).<br/>
 I&#39;m not sure of your question, so I&#39;ll restate what you said how I interpreted it.<br/>
You dd is not happy at school & isn&#39;t thriving in that environment.<br/>
You have taken her out but don&#39;t know what to do next.<br/>
Do you know what your local laws are that you would fall under? (do you have to sign up with a charter school? do you have to test her annually?.. .that sort of thing).<br/>
There are plenty of places to gather that type of information and I&#39;m sure some can provide links for you. If you are thinking along the lines of changing your whole outlook on learning and the goals your teen has, this would be the place to hang out and ask questions.<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
