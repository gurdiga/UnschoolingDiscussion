&gt; A Powerful Lobbying Force, Parents<br/>
&gt; Campaign Through Phone, Fax<br/>
&gt; By DANIEL GOLDEN<br/>
&gt; Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL<br/>
&gt; WASHINGTON -- Driving here from their Maryland home one March morning,<br/>
&gt; Tabatha Freivald asked her nine-year-old son, &quot;How does Congress know what<br/>
&gt; we want?&quot;<br/>
&gt; Joshua thought about it, but was stumped. His mother supplied the answer:<br/>
&gt; &quot;Lobbying.&quot;<br/>
&gt; It was no idle question. The Freivalds were headed to the nation&#39;s capital<br/>
&gt; as trainees for a little-known but potent educational lobbying force -- home<br/>
&gt; schoolers. Soon they joined 130 home-school parents and 40 children in a<br/>
&gt; Holiday Inn conference room, praying and singing hymns as they learned such<br/>
&gt; techniques as researching a congressman&#39;s voting record on the Web.<br/>
&gt; &quot;When I started home-schooling, I was worried that we were withdrawing from<br/>
&gt; society,&quot; says another trainee, Jo Hershey of Lancaster, Pa. &quot;But now I feel<br/>
&gt; we have the best of both worlds. We home-school, and we influence<br/>
&gt; educational policy nationwide.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Do they ever. Although often portrayed as an isolated fringe group, parents<br/>
&gt; who teach their children at home have become inside-the-Beltway pros,<br/>
&gt; wielding enough clout to help block a Clinton administration bid for<br/>
&gt; national student testing, launch their own political action committee and<br/>
&gt; push their concerns into the midst of this year&#39;s presidential race.<br/>
&gt; Despite relatively small numbers -- an estimated million to 1.5 million of<br/>
&gt; the nation&#39;s 53 million schoolchildren are taught at home -- their ability<br/>
&gt; to overwhelm Congress and state legislatures with phone calls, faxes,<br/>
&gt; e-mails and visits has won them a unique status as educational conscientious<br/>
&gt; objectors, in the form of exemptions from compulsory attendance laws and<br/>
&gt; state tests.<br/>
&gt; But home schoolers aren&#39;t content to be left alone. Suspicious of any<br/>
&gt; federal intervention in what they consider a family matter, they are<br/>
&gt; rallying resistance to the bipartisan coalition of government, business and<br/>
&gt; academic leaders seeking more accountability and higher standards in K-12<br/>
&gt; education.<br/>
&gt; For instance, in a quiet alliance with publishers McGraw-Hill Cos. and<br/>
&gt; Houghton Mifflin Co., home schoolers are assaulting the National Assessment<br/>
&gt; of Educational Progress, a federal test given to a fraction of<br/>
&gt; schoolchildren that is the preferred tool of policymakers for figuring out<br/>
&gt; whether learning levels are rising or falling.<br/>
&gt; Pennsylvania Congressman Bill Goodling, chairman of the House Committee on<br/>
&gt; Education and the Workforce, calls home schoolers the most effective<br/>
&gt; educational lobby on Capitol Hill. They frequently volunteer in his election<br/>
&gt; campaigns. &quot;They know the issues,&quot; says Rep. Goodling. &quot;And they have an<br/>
&gt; outstanding phone network.&quot;<br/>
&gt; A study last year by two University of North Carolina sociologists concluded<br/>
&gt; that home-schooling families are more likely than public-school families to<br/>
&gt; work for political campaigns, contribute to candidates, participate in<br/>
&gt; protests or boycotts, sign petitions and write letters to the editor. &quot;We&#39;re<br/>
&gt; the activists,&quot; says Michael Farris, president of the 60,000-member Home<br/>
&gt; School Legal Defense Association in Purcellville, Va.<br/>
&gt; That activism often trumps public opinion. Ninety-two percent of Americans<br/>
&gt; believe that home-schooled students should take the same standardized tests<br/>
&gt; that are required of public-school students, says a 1999 Phi Delta<br/>
&gt; Kappa/Gallup poll. Yet home-schooled children, like private-school students,<br/>
&gt; are exempted from these tests, which public-school students in many states<br/>
&gt; must pass to graduate.<br/>
&gt; This exemption has emerged as an issue in the presidential campaign. The<br/>
&gt; presumptive Republican nominee, George W. Bush, rarely misses a chance to<br/>
&gt; espouse accountability in education. As Texas governor, he toughened<br/>
&gt; consequences for students who do poorly on state tests. If elected<br/>
&gt; president, he says, he will boost funding for states with high test scores<br/>
&gt; -- and punish the laggards.<br/>
&gt; Nevertheless, Mr. Bush was among four Republican presidential candidates who<br/>
&gt; addressed the legal-defense association&#39;s convention last September and<br/>
&gt; expressed support for home schooling. And Mr. Bush has made what Mr. Farris,<br/>
&gt; who has endorsed him, calls the &quot;big promise&quot;: to shield home schoolers from<br/>
&gt; all regulation, including testing mandates. Mr. Bush contends that home<br/>
&gt; schoolers don&#39;t need to be held accountable in this way because they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; receive government funding.<br/>
&gt; Mr. Bush&#39;s supporters include some prominent home-school activists: Mr.<br/>
&gt; Farris; Tim Lambert, the Republican national committeeman from Texas and<br/>
&gt; head of the Texas Home School Coalition; and San Antonio hospital-bed<br/>
&gt; magnate James Leininger. Dr. Leininger, whose four children have been taught<br/>
&gt; at home, has given at least $40,000 to Mr. Bush, $50,000 to Texas Lt. Gov.<br/>
&gt; Rick Perry and $300,000 to other Republican committees and candidates since<br/>
&gt; 1996, according to state and federal records.<br/>
&gt; The Democratic National Committee says it is inconsistent for Mr. Bush to<br/>
&gt; exempt home schoolers from tests. More surprisingly, so does Chester Finn<br/>
&gt; Jr., a former assistant U.S. secretary of education whom Mr. Bush identifies<br/>
&gt; as an adviser. &quot;If standards are important for all kids, they&#39;re important<br/>
&gt; for home schoolers too,&quot; Mr. Finn says. &quot;But it&#39;s a kind of accommodation<br/>
&gt; that America frequently makes with strong-willed minorities. They protest<br/>
&gt; loudly, they have very vigorous fax machines and they are capable of<br/>
&gt; mobilizing a very large fraction of their actual numbers.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Kristen Amundsen learned that the hard way. When the Democratic member of<br/>
&gt; the Virginia House of Delegates proposed in February that home-schooled<br/>
&gt; children take the state&#39;s Standards of Learning exams, which public-school<br/>
&gt; students starting with the Class of 2004 must pass to receive diplomas, so<br/>
&gt; many angry calls and e-mail messages poured into the legislature that her<br/>
&gt; bill was scuttled without a vote. Its supporters, she says, were afraid to<br/>
&gt; go on record against the home-school lobby.<br/>
&gt; Fear of similar initiatives on the federal level motivates the 170 people in<br/>
&gt; the hotel conference room who are training to be volunteer lobbyists for the<br/>
&gt; legal-defense association. &quot;Any organization that&#39;s going to stand up and<br/>
&gt; say, &#39;Hands off!&#39; has my support,&quot; says Elizabeth McCormick, a<br/>
&gt; home-schooling mother from Wisconsin.<br/>
&gt; The trainees are taught how to dress (suits for men, skirt and blouse or<br/>
&gt; dress slacks for women), field frequently asked questions (&quot;How are you<br/>
&gt; going to teach calculus and physics?&quot;) and access the association&#39;s online<br/>
&gt; library and Congressional directory.<br/>
&gt; If they pass muster with the association, the volunteers will be expected to<br/>
&gt; spend four or five days a year on Capitol Hill, meeting each day with seven<br/>
&gt; to 10 staffers for 20 minutes each. That includes children. The association<br/>
&gt; encourages them to lobby with their parents so congressional staffers can<br/>
&gt; see that they&#39;re not social misfits.<br/>
&gt; This early introduction to politics breeds the home-school activists of the<br/>
&gt; future. With similar foresight, Mr. Farris, the legal-defense association<br/>
&gt; president, is opening a college in Purcellville for home-schooled students<br/>
&gt; in September. All students at Patrick Henry College will major in<br/>
&gt; government, and as many as possible will be placed in public-sector summer<br/>
&gt; jobs and internships.<br/>
&gt; The association is not popular with secular home schoolers. Many are<br/>
&gt; alienated by its fundamentalist religious bent and three Rs approach to<br/>
&gt; education. But the secularists also tend to be individualists. Their latest<br/>
&gt; stab at a national organization, the National Home Education Network,<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t take positions on issues.<br/>
&gt; Beth Richardson, a home-schooling mother, belongs to a splinter group that<br/>
&gt; left the legal defense association&#39;s Rhode Island affiliate three years ago.<br/>
&gt; The association fosters &quot;groupthink,&quot; she says. &quot;We feel that nobody should<br/>
&gt; really lead, nobody should be in charge.&quot;<br/>
&gt; In practice, such iconoclasm leaves the legal defense association as the<br/>
&gt; home schoolers&#39; voice on Capitol Hill. Founded in 1983, it first worked in<br/>
&gt; courts and legislatures to legalize home schooling, which came to pass in<br/>
&gt; every state by 1993.<br/>
&gt; That year, in response to Bill Clinton&#39;s election, the association set up<br/>
&gt; what one official calls its &quot;one-two punch.&quot; Volunteers from nearby comb the<br/>
&gt; Hill, as more-distant members make their views known by phone, e-mail or<br/>
&gt; fax. Members are organized by Congressional district, with a parent<br/>
&gt; coordinator in each.<br/>
&gt; This system got its first test in February 1994, when George Miller, a<br/>
&gt; Democratic representative from California, offered an amendment to an<br/>
&gt; education bill known as HR6. Mr. Miller says he didn&#39;t intend the amendment,<br/>
&gt; which specified that teachers must be certified in the subjects they teach,<br/>
&gt; to apply to home-schooling parents. But the association, alarmed that the<br/>
&gt; courts might interpret it that way, activated its network, alerting<br/>
&gt; Christian-right radio shows as well.<br/>
&gt; Hundreds of thousands of phone calls deluged Congress and tied up Mr.<br/>
&gt; Miller&#39;s office lines, forcing him to resort to a voice mail recording for<br/>
&gt; five days. The amendment, which had sailed through committee, got only one<br/>
&gt; vote on the House floor -- Mr. Miller&#39;s. Since then, major federal education<br/>
&gt; legislation has contained boilerplate language exempting home schoolers. And<br/>
&gt; Mr. Miller has become a valuable bogeyman for Christian-right fund-raisers,<br/>
&gt; who elicit home-school contributions by warning that, if the Democrats win<br/>
&gt; back the House, he would become the education-committee chairman.<br/>
&gt; Mr. Miller says that the association exaggerates potential dangers to<br/>
&gt; justify collecting $100-a-year dues from members. HR6, he says, &quot;was a<br/>
&gt; tuneup to see whether they could stampede the House. And the evidence is,<br/>
&gt; they can.&quot;<br/>
&gt; As a nonprofit, the legal defense association can&#39;t endorse candidates,<br/>
&gt; because it would lose its tax-exempt status. But the line sometimes gets<br/>
&gt; blurry. Its president, Mr. Farris, is also chairman of the Madison Project,<br/>
&gt; a political action committee that says it funneled about $350,000 in each of<br/>
&gt; the last two Congressional elections to conservative Republican challengers<br/>
&gt; for Democratic-held and open seats.<br/>
&gt; Mr. Farris expects the Madison Project to give between $20,000 and $30,000<br/>
&gt; to each of 20 candidates this year. It is also spinning off a home-school<br/>
&gt; political action committee to focus on key congressional races. One likely<br/>
&gt; target: Kansas Democratic Rep. Dennis Moore. In 1983, when Mr. Moore was<br/>
&gt; district attorney of Johnson County, Kan., he brought -- and won -- a case<br/>
&gt; against two children for truancy because they were home schooled.<br/>
&gt; Legislatively, home schoolers want to shrink the National Assessment of<br/>
&gt; Educational Progress, or NAEP. &quot;This will probably be the first issue you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; be lobbying on,&quot; Christopher Klicka, senior counsel of the association,<br/>
&gt; tells the group at the Holiday Inn. &quot;We noticed what we call &#39;NAEP creep.&#39;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s the back door for another national test attempt.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Two years ago, home schoolers joined a right-left coalition -- also<br/>
&gt; including black and Hispanic Democrats in Congress -- to defeat the Clinton<br/>
&gt; administration&#39;s proposal for a national test for all students. Although<br/>
&gt; participation would have been voluntary, home schoolers predicted the test<br/>
&gt; would spawn a national curriculum.<br/>
&gt; Unlike that proposed test, NAEP doesn&#39;t give results for individual<br/>
&gt; students. It provides state and national scores on various subjects, based<br/>
&gt; on a sample of public, private and parochial school students. (Home<br/>
&gt; schoolers haven&#39;t participated because the survey is limited to schools.)<br/>
&gt; The nonprofit Educational Testing Service in Princeton, N.J., designs NAEP<br/>
&gt; under a five-year, $75 million agreement with the federal government.<br/>
&gt; Now, the Clinton administration and Vice President Al Gore have proposed<br/>
&gt; extra funding for states that do well on NAEP, which is due for<br/>
&gt; congressional reauthorization this year. (Gov. Bush would use NAEP as one of<br/>
&gt; several measures for rewarding states.)<br/>
&gt; Worried that NAEP will morph into a national test, home schoolers linked up<br/>
&gt; with McGraw-Hill and Houghton Mifflin, which fear that an expanded NAEP<br/>
&gt; would give states and local school districts less reason to buy their<br/>
&gt; standardized tests, now used chiefly to measure individual student<br/>
&gt; performance.<br/>
&gt; &quot;I actually was shocked the first time I met with the test publishers,&quot; says<br/>
&gt; Doug Domenech, director of governmental affairs for the home-school<br/>
&gt; association. &quot;I didn&#39;t think they&#39;d buy our changes.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Executives at both CTB/McGraw-Hill, the McGraw-Hill division that sells the<br/>
&gt; Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills, and Houghton Mifflin, which sells the<br/>
&gt; Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, confirm the alliance. Michael Kean, vice<br/>
&gt; president of CTB/McGraw-Hill, describes NAEP as a competitor and says its<br/>
&gt; state results are largely useless. &quot;In terms of networking in Washington,<br/>
&gt; the home schoolers provide some access,&quot; Mr. Kean says. &quot;They carry some<br/>
&gt; people power.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Keith Oakley agrees. As chairman of the Texas House of Representatives&#39;<br/>
&gt; public-safety committee in 1997, he sought to repeal a law that allowed<br/>
&gt; parents to teach their children to drive, in place of certified instructors.<br/>
&gt; Hundreds of home-schooling families packed the legislature in protest. With<br/>
&gt; the help of a state representative whose own son was home-schooled, the bill<br/>
&gt; was trounced.<br/>
&gt; Chastened, Mr. Oakley cites the defeat as part of the reason he didn&#39;t seek<br/>
&gt; re-election in 1998. &quot;I&#39;ve still got their tire tracks on my back,&quot; he says.<br/>
