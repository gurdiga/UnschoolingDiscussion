 </span></blockquote>This is my granola recipe! I can&#39;t remember where I got the original, (so I <br/>
can&#39;t give credit, sorry.) but I have tweaked it over the years to make it my <br/>
own. Hope you like it! My family loves it, I store it in a Tupperware box, <br/>
and we eat it with yogurt or with milk as a cereal.<br/>
<br/>
1 1/4c. uncooked old-fashioned rolled oats<br/>
1/4c. chopped pecans (or walnuts or your favorite)<br/>
3/4c. honey<br/>
2 egg whites<br/>
1tsp. vanilla<br/>
1/2tsp. ground cinnamon<br/>
Dash of salt<br/>
<br/>
Combine oats and pecans in a bowl. Mix together honey, egg whites, vanilla, <br/>
cinnamon and salt in a small bowl until well blended. Add honey mixture to <br/>
oats; stir until well blended. Line 17x11 inch baking sheet with foil; coat <br/>
with butter (or use non-stick cooking spray) Spread oat mixture in even layer <br/>
on baking sheet. Bake at 325* about 18 minutes or until golden brown. Tossing <br/>
mixture 3-4 times during baking. Remove and cool completely (this allows it <br/>
to get crisp and crunchy.) If you like a slightly softer granola, don&#39;t let <br/>
it cool all the way before you remove it from the pan. Sometimes we add <br/>
raisins after we have baked it. (cooked raisins... ewww!) Serve with yogurt, <br/>
berries, milk... makes about 6 servings. Enjoy!<br/>

you can get all the ingredients for making your own granola and you have <br/>
enough to make tons more than 10oz.! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Either, Old-fashioned rolled oats are just those Quaker Oats (or buy the <br/>
generic like we do) You can buy oats either old-fashioned or quick cooking <br/>
(minute oatmeal). The quick cooking ones have been processed so it only takes <br/>
a few minutes to cook rather than the 20 or so minutes it takes with regular <br/>
oats.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, not tons anyway. &lt;g&gt; But enough to sprinkle over your yogurt every <br/>
morning without going bankrupt. <br/>
An aside about the recipe I gave. I have found the amount of honey depends on <br/>
how sweet you like your granola, but there is a minimum you have to have. <br/>
(just under 1/4c. for every 1/3c. oats) it sounds like a lot though. I have <br/>
also tried brown sugar and molasses and neither gets my vote. I know some <br/>
have concerns about honey. We get ours from a great orchard near here. I have <br/>
never had problems with it, and since we cook our granola it doesn&#39;t matter. <br/>
Personally, for anyone over the age of 2 or 3, I think honey is fine. But <br/>
then, I can&#39;t imagine giving crunchy granola to a small child anyway, so <br/>
maybe that point is moot. <br/>
