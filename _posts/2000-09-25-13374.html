<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832957815">I know where you are coming from.  I removed my daughter from school <br/>
6 months ago - we tried school at home but that didnt work.  Like you <br/>
i read all the message boards - and unschooling looked like the way <br/>
to go.  also like you, it is me that needed and still need <br/>
deschooling.<br/>
I am sorry i cant give you any help as all the questions you asked <br/>
are the questions i am still asking - Good Luck<br/>
