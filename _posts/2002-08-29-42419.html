<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303546180">**After careful consideration, I came to the same conclusion, but I just <br/>
can&#39;t seem to get over my distaste for toy guns.  Mary-the-pacifist, do you <br/>
have any thoiughts on this?  Anyone else?**<br/>
<br/>
I had a no guns rule for - hmm, had to stop and think, here - for something <br/>
close to 22 years of parenting. It held up until I finally had a kid who <br/>
persisted and persisted and PERSISTED in being fascinated with guns in spite <br/>
of prohibitions, rules, discussions, pleas, more discussions... He was the <br/>
kid who could make a gun out out of anything, and did! Peanut butter and <br/>
jelly sandwich gun. K&#39;Nex gun (many different versions). Lego gun. Maple twig <br/>
gun. Lilac blossoms gun! Mud pie gun. Origami gun. Plastic dinosaur gun. <br/>
There was gun play nearly every day despite my not allowing guns in the <br/>
house. <br/>
<br/>
He wanted a cap gun desparately. Finally, after YEARS of being worn down, <br/>
when he again begged to be allowed to buy one with his own money I relented, <br/>
subject to a short list of rules. (Most important being No pointing the gun <br/>
at anyone who hasn&#39;t explicitly agreed to be part of the game. Second being, <br/>
no caps fired in the house.) <br/>
<br/>
That was (I think?) two years ago. The first week the gun was outside every <br/>
day. Twice a day. The second week he probably missed a day or two. Soon it <br/>
was every other day, then once a week. Now, I saw him take it out the other <br/>
day for the first time in months. And he hasn&#39;t made a gun in ages, though he <br/>
still makes many other fascinating things.<br/>
<br/>
I should have let him buy it the first time he asked, we&#39;d have been over the <br/>
trauma years earlier! (Maybe. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
