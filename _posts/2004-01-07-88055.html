<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137925876">Hello - I am new to this group, and although I read that I should wait a <br/>
couple weeks to post and to get a feel for the group, I just couldn&#39;t hold <br/>
back as I have a burning question.  Well, it&#39;s burning to me, at least.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the deal.  I believe that I have made food and eating into an issue <br/>
with my two children, ages 3 and 4.  We do try to eat healthy, although I am <br/>
fine with sugar or junk foods at times.  The problem with me is that I worry <br/>
about their health, and want to make sure that they eat enough vegetables <br/>
and fruit (no issues with any other foods).  I started out fine with making <br/>
broccoli into trees or playing silly games so they will eat fruit, and it <br/>
was all fun.  I did this because if I don&#39;t do anything, it seems that they <br/>
just won&#39;t eat fruits and vegetables (or at least very little).  Now though <br/>
they are into icecream sometimes for dessert (a good non-sugary kind), so I <br/>
will say that they cannot have any until they eat all their vegetables, or <br/>
food.  (The games lost their appeal after awhile.)<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short, I feel like everybody gets stressed out now <br/>
around eating.  My question is, what do you guys do when it comes to food?  <br/>
What if my daughter wants to eat nothing but goldfish crackers all day?  <br/>
What if my son refuses to eat dinner, but then wants ice cream.  Or what if <br/>
he refuses dinner but then gets hungry two hours later?  My instinct tells <br/>
me to just forget worrying about any of it and just let them eat whatever <br/>
they want (just keep the options healthy) and after a few weeks they will <br/>
just kind of regain their personal control over eating.  SO, I guess my <br/>
question is, when letting your kids have full control over the food, do they <br/>
eat enough vegetables and the such?  If not, what do you do?  I think you <br/>
are all getting my point here, so I will just stop now...  :)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

I give my children vitamins to help make sure they are getting what they need. But I don&#39;t stress about their eating. I make plenty of healthy options available, and they will eat those. Other than that, I&#39;ve noticed if I am not forcing the issue they will eat healthily most of the time. They know what they like and don&#39;t like, and forcing them to eat something &quot;for their health&quot; only makes us all stressed out. <br/>
<br/>
As long as they are growing physically and are active, let them be! And remember, they have much smaller stomachs than we do and don&#39;t need to eat as much although they need to eat more often. We hardly ever sit down to &quot;meals&quot; together, because they&#39;re all on different &quot;timeclocks.&quot; But when they are hungry, they eat. When I&#39;m hungry, I eat. But I try to sit at the table with them while they are eating, even if I&#39;m not eating so that we are together even if it&#39;s not in a traditional-meal-everyone-at-the-table kind of way. <br/>
<br/>
Every now and again, I like to surprise them with eating icecream before dinner, or even once in awhile I&#39;ve let them have icecream for breakfast. They get a kick out of it, and so do I!<br/>

life is more pleasant..<br/>
<br/>
  I say YES more often. ( sometimes even ice cream for breakfast! &lt;&lt;G&lt;&lt;).<br/>
 I also make sure I have more healthy things in the house to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
  I view it as as long as they have adequate nutrition in a 48 hr period..who <br/>
cares WHEN they eat certain foods. It also gives us a chance to talk about <br/>
heathy and non-healthy foods and proper nutrition for growing bodies &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
  I&#39;ll often offer a plate of veggies and &quot;dip&quot; or cheese and crackers and <br/>
other healthy snacks while they are playing , reading ,watching a video, etc.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Hello - I am new to this group, and although I read that I should wait a <br/>

<br/>
Hi.  I&#39;m a moderator-type. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;ve let the question through, but please go easy on your responses and <br/>
judgment of the feedback you receive until you have read more and longer.  If what <br/>
you read surprises you, just go with that feeling and try not to be defensive, <br/>
please.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The problem with me is that I worry <br/>
about their health, and want to make sure that they eat enough vegetables <br/>
and fruit (no issues with any other foods).  I started out fine with making <br/>
broccoli into trees or playing silly games so they will eat fruit, and it <br/>
was all fun.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a juicer?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Now though <br/>
they are into icecream sometimes for dessert (a good non-sugary kind), so I <br/>
will say that they cannot have any until they eat all their vegetables, or <br/>
food.  (The games lost their appeal after awhile.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Vegetables are being turned to punishment, and ice cream is being turned to <br/>
gold.<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll like the result of that.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;To make a long story short, I feel like everybody gets stressed out now <br/>
around eating. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You were pre-stressed, and you passed it on to them.<br/>
Maybe they&#39;re young enough that if you change directions, they&#39;ll recover.<br/>
If you don&#39;t change, you&#39;re pretty well guaranteed to give them some <br/>
life-long stress and  food issues that will be worse than a lack of some vegetable <br/>
input.<br/>
<br/>
Think of people in natural circumstances, without world-wide re-distribution <br/>
of bananas and potatoes and carrots.  What would grow where you live? How much <br/>
of the year could you get it?  There are few natural environments in which <br/>
people will have fruit and vegetables every day all year unless they&#39;re wealthy, <br/>
and if they were wealthy enough to have them, their servants and farm workers <br/>
wouldn&#39;t always have them.   Nobody in New Mexico ever had a banana before <br/>
there were highways and trucks (or unless they had travelled south and tasted <br/>
one where it lived).<br/>
<br/>
[Just as an aside, I&#39;ve heard that when they did some of the archeological <br/>
digs at the side of the Thames in London a few years ago, they found a banana <br/>
peel from the 16th century (I think; maybe 17th).  That&#39;s pretty remarkable.   I <br/>
bet it didn&#39;t look so good even when it was new, and there was no proof <br/>
anyone ate it. &lt;g&gt;  Four months on a ship, at least?  If anyone here knows more of <br/>
that story, I&#39;m interested.]<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if my daughter wants to eat nothing but goldfish crackers all day? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would let her.  She wouldn&#39;t eat nothing but that for a week.  When she&#39;s <br/>
tired of it she&#39;ll want something else.  But have you ever given a child the <br/>
opportunity to eat freely?   It doesn&#39;t sound like it from your account.  If you <br/>
let her choose her own food, I can&#39;t imagine that she would want just one <br/>
thing all day, unless it was in response to months or years of frustration.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if my son refuses to eat dinner, but then wants ice cream. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What if you gave him the ice cream first?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if my son refuses to eat dinner&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why would you give him food he didn&#39;t want?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or what if <br/>
he refuses dinner but then gets hungry two hours later? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he isn&#39;t hungry and you try to feed him, and then when he&#39;s hungry you <br/>
refuse, it seems you care more about the clock than the child.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My instinct tells <br/>
me to just forget worrying about any of it and just let them eat whatever <br/>
they want (just keep the options healthy) and after a few weeks they will <br/>
just kind of regain their personal control over eating.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good instincts, in my opinion and experience.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;SO, I guess my <br/>
question is, when letting your kids have full control over the food, do they <br/>
eat enough vegetables and the such?  If not, what do you do? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Provide more options, model (there are parents who hate vegetables but still <br/>
try to force their children to eat them), get pizza, make sandwiches, fun <br/>
salads, raw vegetables with ranch dip... stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
And more than that, look with new eyes and don&#39;t worry so much.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the beginning of a collection of things I should really work on some <br/>
more.  I have some good writings saved, but haven&#39;t gotten to this page the way <br/>
I need to:<br/>

Not to be picky, but if you are &quot;letting&quot; them have ice-cream for breakfast as a treat -- are they really getting to make the food choices? <br/>

<br/>
Your children are sooo little.  You still have total<br/>
control over what is available to eat, even if you let<br/>
them choose whatever they want in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
Is the issue that they are eating food that is<br/>
unhealthy, or food that strikes you as strange?  Let<br/>
them have soup for breakfast, pancakes for dinner.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter eats goldfish all day for three days,<br/>
she will get tired of them.  And if she eats them all<br/>
gone, but you aren&#39;t running to the store, she will<br/>
eat something else until you go.<br/>
<br/>
The strewing principle can be applied to the food<br/>
issue as well.<br/>
<br/>
Little kids are much more interested in playing and<br/>
running around and such than fixing themselves<br/>
something, so why not just keep prepared good<br/>
nutritious snacks that they can get to easily?<br/>
<br/>
Leave these things on a &quot;snack shelf&quot; in the fridge<br/>
and pantry:<br/>
<br/>
Celery sticks with peanut butter<br/>
<br/>
Crackers and cheese<br/>
<br/>
string cheese<br/>
<br/>
apple wedges or baby carrot sticks<br/>
<br/>
individual servings of applesauce<br/>
<br/>
fruit leather<br/>
<br/>
juice boxes or capri sun pouches<br/>
<br/>
trail mix or cracker jacks<br/>
<br/>
salsa and chips<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do you sit down and eat with them or are they mostly<br/>
eating alone?  Modelling good eating habits can go a<br/>
long way.  I know when I am really enjoying something,<br/>
that will be when my kids start pirating the food on<br/>
my plate ;-)  Everything tastes better off mom&#39;s<br/>
plate.<br/>
<br/>
Have a picnic with them on the living room floor. <br/>
Pull out a blanket, make cute little sandwiches, some<br/>
fresh fruit already sliced, some cookies, and juice.<br/>
<br/>
Read books like &quot;The Berenstain Bears and Too Much<br/>
Junk Food&quot;.  Great book that isn&#39;t &quot;preachy&quot;.  Worked<br/>
for my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Introduce them to chocolate chip oatmeal cookies, ice<br/>
cream with peanut butter, gooey granola bars, and<br/>
fruit smoothies.<br/>
<br/>
Get them busy helping you fix dinner, if they are<br/>
interested, maybe as a treat for Dad when he gets home<br/>
from work.<br/>
<br/>
When you go to the store, let them choose a favorite<br/>
candy bar or snack.<br/>
<br/>
If they aren&#39;t hungry for dinner, then enjoy a<br/>
candlelit supper with your hubby alone!  Although<br/>
every time I put candles on the table, suddenly<br/>
everyone wants to &quot;dine&quot; there.  <br/>

Yes, if you let them control what they eat, they will eat what they need.   If you feel worried about it - offer them a kids-multi-vitamin every day.  Probably good advice anyway.  We all take multivitamins here (except the baby!) <br/>
<br/>
Remember how little a kid&#39;s stomach holds -- a sensible child may well figure out that if she wants to be able to eat enough ice-cream after dinner, she should skip dinner to leave some room.   Have ice-cream available whenever she wants it and she will stop skipping dinner to have room for the ice-cream during its limited availability. <br/>
<br/>
However, there may be days when they eat nothing but goldfish and you have to be prepared for that.  In my experience, the balance happens over weeks, not days and certainly not meals. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never restricted Lydia&#39;s food, so I have no experience with how long the de-food-controlling stage might last.   While they are figuring out if you are serious, there may be weeks where they eat nothing but goldfish - and you need to be prepared for that.  But eventually if goldfish or candy or whatever are just another food in the house, they should stop having an artificial attraction for your children.  This whole paragraph about what happens if you control food and then stop  is just theory for me, though, so you should pay more attention to anyone who has actually controlled food and then stopped.  <br/>
<br/>
Back to stuff I have personal experience with: <br/>
<br/>
We have an candy shelf filled with whatever Lydia (6) wants to request from the grocery store -- sometimes she eats candy for breakfast and sometimes she doesn&#39;t eat any at all for a week or more.  We keep the shelf locked so her 1 yo brother doesn&#39;t get into the chokeable stuff, but she can work the key and gets what she wants when she wants it.  <br/>
<br/>
Some &quot;what we do&quot; advice:  <br/>
<br/>
Avoid feeling like a short-order cook (this is for your own sanity):  Lydia has 2 things that she will always eat - plain pasta with olive oil and soy sauce, and peas and corn mixed with nutritional yeast (yes, she invented both &quot;recipes&quot; lol).  I make sure we always have those available -- if she doesn&#39;t like what we are having for dinner, she can always have one of those.  She doens&#39;t have to eat dinner with us -- but she almost always chooses to. Also, this isn&#39;t to say that I won&#39;t fix her something other than these if she requests it.  But she chooses these often enough and they are easy enough to fix  that I don&#39;t feel like I am running a restaurant when I want to eat my dinner. <br/>
<br/>
Kids generally come to eat what you eat:  My husband and I both eat a lot of fruit -- Lydia has always wanted to share what we are eating.  She frequently requests fruit when she wants a snack.  Snack on baby carrots or cut-up broccoli yourself -- not making a big deal out of it -- just having a snack for yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
Try vegetables that kids often like:  baked sweet potatoes, oven-baked french fries, corn on the cob, frozen peas (lydia used to like them still frozen!), snow peas, baby corn, <br/>
<br/>
Rather than trying to make food &quot;fun&quot;, try to make it tasty:  I&#39;ve never done the playing with food thing (although I know lots of people who do) -- I do try to make it taste the way she wants it too.  Catsup, dips of various kinds (we love cashew butter mixed with honey as a dip for tart granny smith apples), my nieces like ranch dressing with their vegetable (although Lydia doesnt),  bean dips? not-very-spicy guacamole?   We drink a lot of smoothies and experiment with the different fruit/nut/combinations that we like.  In the summer we freeze the smoothies into popsicles with popsicle molds.  <br/>
<br/>
Keep/Make  stuff available for snacking/grazing throughout the day: <br/>
We keep car snacks in a tupperware in the car -- cheerios, pretzels, dried fruit, nuts and raisin, and a cereal she really likes called &quot;puffins.&quot;   When Lydia is playing I often bring her a small plate of cut-up apples or pears or kiwi or mango, etc., a bowl of nuts and raisins, a bag of baby carrots, a plate of cheese cubes, to be there if she is hungry.  Now (at 6) I usually ask what/if she wants something, but at 3 or 4, I just put some stuff out.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t make food artificially unpleasant:  I have NEVER forced Lydia to try anything.  I know there is tons of advice out there about how children have to try something 50 times to like it (or soemthing like that).  That hasn&#39;t been our experience.  From 0 - 2 1/2, she ate everything,  from 2 1/2 to 5 1/12 she ate almost no variety and didn&#39;t seek to try anything new (although she did have some non-mainstream favorites, like Nori (the seaweed wrapping around sushi) and chard cooked in tomato sauce and garlic).  Now at 6, she generally wants to smell and (if it smells good) try anything that her father or I am eating.  <br/>

dangling from my breasts every 20-30 minutes.  Other times, 1 1/2 would <br/>
go buy and not even a look at my boobies. That&#39;s basically the rule of <br/>
thumb here with food. We make 3 meals but we have no unbreakable <br/>
schedules. If they want snacks, they&#39;ll have them. For every cookie I <br/>
lay out, I also put on the table a fruit alternative like grapes or <br/>
raisins or bananas. Always some cheese, maybe some baby carrots and cut <br/>
peppers. Here, I do the &#39;spread&#39; either during breakfast, lunch or <br/>
dinner. I just put out food, like on a buffet, and leave it there. My <br/>
husband works at home too, so it saves me asking all the time who&#39;s <br/>
hungry. My little one is 3.5 and the big one is 6.5. They go through <br/>
really whacked growth spurts with growing pains and eating huge amounts <br/>
of food --like 2 adult size plates filled with tofu and rice for the <br/>
little one! They want their cookies and candy and what not and they get <br/>
it. I joke that I make sure they have a balanced in-take of sugar and <br/>
fat so they can wash out the tofu, sushi, fruit and vegetables they <br/>
like to eat. Does it drive me crazy that after making a nice meal all <br/>
they want is cereal? Yeah, to put it into perspective, we have food <br/>
allergies and we can&#39;t eat anything with wheat. So we get these full of <br/>
fiber Amaranth, Spelt, Oat, Millet cereals that they wash down with soy <br/>
and/or rice milk because we&#39;re allergic to cow-milk as well. Their <br/>
cereal intake is more a blow to my pride. I know they&#39;re eating OK, <br/>
they&#39;re just not eating my yummy food that day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528644188">My challenge with giving up food power is that we are constantly <br/>
eating and making messes.. It is the messes.. It is my issue. I know <br/>
my kids make fine food choices. I make our three year old and anyone <br/>
else who wants three meals a day.. I love to cook.. So do they. But <br/>
when I have cooked and cleaned up and have my stuff done and that <br/>
second someone heads over to do a PBand J.. Or  PB and honey.. I <br/>
feel like OMG&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I really work on it.. If I do snap.. I appoligize. <br/>
I have asked that they clear there stuff up and put it away.. <br/>
Because I know that is my problem.I own that with them. There are <br/>
six kids and when we stagger our eating the chaos become a lot for <br/>
me. <br/>
I know how I want to feel about them eating when they want.. but it <br/>
is myself getting in the way of always being able to let go and let <br/>
them.. My kids have heard more I am sorrys&#39; from me since I have <br/>
been in process of letting go than ever.. I am always working on <br/>
considering my decision and not saying no, but I need to be careful <br/>
that I do not do that at my expense because that is when I end up <br/>
snapping at them. <br/>

 Speaking of food.My eight year old is sitting at the kitchen table <br/>
with Graham Crackers and Milk. She has broken them into sections and <br/>
is counting them backwards as she eats them. She is in her own world <br/>
really understanding this process on a deep level and it is <br/>
beautiful. She is making small announcements to me. Like mom eight <br/>
small crackers are two big crackers.  Mom I ate one big cracker in <br/>
four pieces  and now I have 16 small crackers left. We have <br/>
not &quot;done&quot; math with her ever. Well her year in PS&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>

This is the hardest concept for people to get! Especially with young kids. Mine are 6, 5 and 3.5, but they are perfectly capable of deciding what they would like to do. Of course, I will often discuss the options with them first, help them to see the pros and cons of each side, but I respect their final decision. The grandparents (and even dh is guilty of this) will always talk about them to me--sometimes I think they&#39;re genuinely running it by me to make sure I&#39;m okay with it, which I appreciate. But I always say, &quot;Ask them.&quot; Half the time they look at me like I&#39;m crazy, or dh will be like, &quot;oh, yeah, okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s grandmother died last week, and my mother in law (fil&#39;s mother, not hers) decided she didn&#39;t want the kids there, so we stayed home. We had already asked them if they wanted to go before we knew mil would make an issue of it, and the girls did want to go. They had gone to my grandfather&#39;s funeral, and my oldest is rather fascinated by the concept of death and burial. But there was no way we were going to drive 5 hours one way so the kids could stay with a baby sitter! Dh went up by himself. I can&#39;t imagine making a decision that involved my kids without consulting them, but this concept is completely foreign to my in-laws. At least my nephew was told what really happened this time around. When he inquired about the other great-grandmother several months ago (she died many years ago), my mil told him that she &quot;moved to Florida.&quot; &lt;shaking my head&gt;<br/>

Sorry, this is one of my pet peeves! <br/>

&lt;&lt;But I don&#39;t stress about their eating. I make plenty of healthy <br/>
options available, and they will eat those. Other than that, I&#39;ve <br/>
noticed if I am not forcing the issue they will eat healthily most <br/>
of the time. They know what they like and don&#39;t like, and forcing <br/>
them to eat something &quot;for their health&quot; only makes us all stressed <br/>
out.  <br/>
<br/>
As long as they are growing physically and are active, let them be! <br/>
And remember, they have much smaller stomachs than we do and don&#39;t <br/>
need to eat as much although they need to eat more often. We hardly <br/>
ever sit down to &quot;meals&quot; together, because they&#39;re all on <br/>
different &quot;timeclocks.&quot; But when they are hungry, they eat. When I&#39;m <br/>
hungry, I eat. But I try to sit at the table with them while they <br/>
are eating, even if I&#39;m not eating so that we are together even if <br/>
it&#39;s not in a traditional-meal-everyone-at-the-table kind of way. <br/>
 <br/>

I told myself that I was going to read all the posts on this one <br/>
before responding but, as usual, I just couldn&#39;t.  This is exactly <br/>
what I have started doing and, you know what?  It works!  <br/>
<br/>
I stressed myself sick over what my DD was (or rather was not) <br/>
eating until we would both end up crying and neither one of us would <br/>
eat.  Now, I simply let her tell me when she&#39;s hungry and what she <br/>
wants.  Sure, sometimes it gold fish crackers but, 9 times out of <br/>
10, it PB and J for lunch with a banana and chicken with carrots for <br/>
dinner.  Ok, not always that same thing but, you get the picture <br/>
that SHE is choosing to eat healthy without my forcing the issue.  <br/>
<br/>
It did take her about a week to make the switch.  By that I mean <br/>
that she was so used to me yelling and tring to force her to eat <br/>
healthy that, once I made my mind up to stop that she decided to <br/>
push and see just how far I would go.  She asked for popciles, <br/>
chips, and soda for lunch and so on.  But, once she realized that I <br/>
was really done with the stress, she calmed down and has pretty much <br/>
eaten healthy on her own.  Wow, how easy was that?  :-)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297196248">One thing that has surprised me in regards to my children&#39;s food choices...nearly every Wednesday night before the service there is a fellowship dinner at our church. They go by themes, such as Italian, &quot;stuffed-stuff&quot; or &quot;Pot Faith.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a traditional buffet set-up, and I just let the kids pick what they want. In general I know there won&#39;t be anything Logan will eat, so either he eats beforehand or I&#39;ll take him a bowl of cereral and some milk - sometimes for Megan as well. <br/>
<br/>
But at times, they will surprise me by wanting to try something I don&#39;t think they&#39;d like. Logan decided he likes kielbasa and sauerkraut. Sarah likes stuffed peppers. Megan normally eats well anyway as long as you don&#39;t offer it to her. If you just put it in front of her, she&#39;ll at least try a bite. She won&#39;t let you feed her anything, or say &quot;Want to try a bite?&quot;<br/>

Same thing here and not just with food as well.  As with the food, <br/>
it took my DD a little while to get used to making her own decisions <br/>
and to see if I would really do what SHE wanted to do and not what I <br/>
THOUGHT she wanted to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, she loves it and really thinks about what she wants to eat or <br/>
where she wants to go.  It&#39;s great to see her little brain working <br/>

 <br/>
Glad to hear it! Food was always a forced issue in my house growing up. And at babysitter&#39;s. I once didn&#39;t eat except for school lunches when we spent a week at a sitter&#39;s. She made Ramen Noodles for dinner, and I can NOT eat them. She served it to me, cold, the next morning for breakfast (after I&#39;d sat at the table til time for bath/bed while everyone else was excused). I didn&#39;t eat. At dinner, it reappeared. The ONLY reason I think that she gave up at the end of the week was because my mother was coming in the morning. But I won..I didn&#39;t have to eat it. <br/>
<br/>
I also swore I&#39;d NEVER do that to one of my children, nor would I not send them to bed hungry or otherwise use or withold food as punishment. It doesn&#39;t take any more effort for me to throw together a PBJ and slice an apple than to thaw out and cook another chicken breast. And sometimes..it&#39;s EASIER to let them have what they want than stand there at the stove frying up another drumstick! Two minutes to put together the sandwich versus however long it takes to fry the stick...!!! <br/>
 <br/>
Once, when Sarah was 3 1/2 we were visiting my mother. Knowing how she is about food, I stopped and bought a gallon of milk and box of Froot Loops for Sarah. Sure enough, later on, Sarah only picked at her dinner. She wasn&#39;t hungry or she didn&#39;t like it, but either way she didn&#39;t eat. My mom kept trying to make an issue of it, and I told Sarah she could be excused if she wanted to but that Grandma liked to have everyone still at the table even if they aren&#39;t eating. Sarah asked to stay. I cleared her plate, got her crayons and paper out, and let her sit. <br/>
 <br/>
Later, while my mother was upstairs in her office, and after her bath Sarah decided she was hungry. I made her a bowl of the cereal with the stuff I&#39;d brought...and my mother had a FIT. Yelling at me that I have to send her to bed hungry if she doesn&#39;t eat rather than being a slave to my child, that I&#39;m too attached to her, and on and on. Sarah couldn&#39;t eat. She asked to be excused, we took care of her dishes and I took her on up to bed. At 1830!! She normally didn&#39;t go to bed until 2300, but this was my mother&#39;s house and her rules. I stayed with her as she cried. She couldn&#39;t understand why Grandma was so mean and why she wanted her to not eat when she was hungry, and eat when she wasn&#39;t hungry. All I could do was tell her I&#39;d watch out for her, and hold her. <br/>
Every night that visit, Sarah was asleep by 1900 because she was scared of her Grandmother. Over FOOD (although there were a couple other issues). <br/>

<br/>
We were never allowed to leave the table until we had eaten <br/>

<br/>
I have gone through bouts of anorexia (not since I have been <br/>

by how big of an issue food was in my house (and my grandmother&#39;s <br/>
house) growing up.  It&#39;s still something that I deal with daily but <br/>
I keep it to myself (at least since I realized that I was doing the <br/>
same thing to my DD that my mother did to me) because food is one <br/>
thing that I REFUSE to have my daughter battle with as she becomes <br/>
older.<br/>

LOL....that&#39;s exactly how I have started looking at it, especially <br/>
when we&#39;re at a restaurant where the portion sizes are WAY out of <br/>
wack!  It also helps me to save anything that we don&#39;t eat, even if <br/>
I know we will probably not eat it again.  That way, a week later, <br/>
when it&#39;s still in the fridge, I can throw it away and tell <br/>
myself &quot;well, at I tried to save it but no one wanted to eat it <br/>
again.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Dh&#39;s grandmother died last week, and my mother in law (fil&#39;s mother, not <br/>

Very strange.  This is one disadvantage of funerals being removed from the <br/>
church.  If it&#39;s a mass or service of the whole church, it&#39;s not up to any <br/>
relative to say who can or can&#39;t attend.   Funerals are generally announced in <br/>
public even if they&#39;re in a funeral home, and the idea that someone outside the <br/>
immediate family could declare whose kids can and can&#39;t go is totally foreign to <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has been to a couple of funerals with me and several weddings, and as <br/>
culture is passed, it&#39;s mostly passed through the females.   I&#39;m really sorry <br/>
your kids missed that.<br/>
<br/>
I went to two relatives&#39; funerals when I was a kid (10/11ish), and that was <br/>
good preparation for when I went to two other teens funerals as a teen.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>BINGO!<br/>
<br/>
Same here with Aidan.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know he would vomit on demand just to repudiate our offering him <br/>
food? It was not the food, it was the &quot;eat it , it&#39;s good&quot;. Evan got so <br/>
freaked out about it that he would get all agitated around eating time <br/>
and say &quot;remember, don&#39;t give him ANYTHING&quot;. So we stopped offering <br/>
him. And he got bored eating the same stuff over and over again. That <br/>
was about 6 months ago or maybe more. Now, I just leave it there.<br/>
<br/>
Aidan :  HMMMM, what&#39;s DAT!<br/>
Us: &#39;Sunflower sprouts&#39;.<br/>
A: HMMMM. OK.<br/>
<br/>
(Pregnant pause while everybody tries not to look at it)<br/>
<br/>
A: Can I try it?<br/>
Us: Sure.<br/>
<br/>
(Do you remember Bugs Bunny eating out a tinsy-weensy piece of carrot? <br/>
That&#39;s Aidan trying out food. All teeth but nary an opening and little <br/>
tongue contact.)<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm. Tastes good (and takes a gulp)<br/>
<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!<br/>
<br/>
And pushes it so far away from him that it either falls off the table <br/>
or it lands on one of our plates.<br/>
<br/>
Evan has a lot of food allergies. He, who cannot eat as much as his <br/>
bro, will try ANYTHING. Aidan, who has the privilege of being a bit <br/>
sensitive to wheat and milk (no real allergies), won&#39;t touch most foods.<br/>
<br/>
Sigh!<br/>
<br/>
Just today we laughed about his food quirks. He did not want the <br/>
traditional soccer sushi we get on Wednesday (given we can&#39;t do the <br/>
pizza the team orders). So he had Chicken Satay (or chicken on a stick <br/>
as he calls it). We shared a Vegan Key Lime cake that was exquisite. He <br/>
also wolfed some almond cookies a friend brought to soccer. I thought <br/>
he was not having dinner. After playing Freedom Force, he gets off the <br/>
computer and announces, &quot;I&#39;m ready for dinner now&quot; So I asked him, what <br/>
do you want?<br/>
<br/>
A: HMMM. (with deep ponderous countenance while tapping his cheek) <br/>
L-e-t me seeeeeeeeeee? Pizza, no pepperoni, lots of cheese.<br/>
Me: Excuse me?<br/>
A: You asked me, dat&#39;s what I want.<br/>
<br/>
So I go ahead, I had to balls of the GF dough I make. Evan already had <br/>
some dinner snacks (sometimes they don&#39;t want dinner, they just want to <br/>
snack), he shared some of Aidan&#39;s pizza but the little dude just wolfed <br/>
everything down. Mark and I looked at each other. Yep, he knows what he <br/>
wants and is very, VERY, specific about it. So specific that in the <br/>
mornings he asks for,  &quot;Toast, untoasted, with no margarine and a bit <br/>
of jelly&quot;  --and that bit has to be either dispensed in front of him or <br/>
left to him to spoon out. I just have to laugh. He&#39;s just 3 years old <br/>
and already has these very specific neurosae. You know I&#39;m a New YAWker <br/>
when I find my kids neurosis cute :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329951817">One question I had to ask myself was what food was available to <br/>
them.  My little one would wake up first and *forage* &lt;g&gt; for chips <br/>
and such in the cupboards.  Recently, I realized that none of us <br/>
really needed that junk around the house.  I would buy Doritos in <br/>
the store because my little one would ask and then we would both eat <br/>
half the bag.  Not good on either end.  I stopped buying junk except <br/>
for a few favorite things like fruit snacks and brownies they eat <br/>
for dessert.  Just by having less junk around, Pierce is eating a <br/>
larger lunch and dinner.  I have also been making better choices and <br/>
he joins me while I am eating a peach or grapes.  <br/>
<br/>
I never restrict my kids when things are available.  At a New Years <br/>
party my 5yo ate one piece of chicken and my 2yo none and lord knows <br/>
how many cookies.  My SIL kept asking if I wanted something for them <br/>
to eat.    They eat pretty well at home so when we go out or are at <br/>
a party, I let them enjoy whatever they want.  Also, if there is <br/>
something very tempting at home, I let them have a good bit.  Not <br/>
every popsicle or bag of fruit snack but plenty to feel satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
We also do not have a dinner time.  My kids eat when they are <br/>
hungry, so do I.  My 5yo is still caught in some of our older <br/>
rules.  He will eat dinner and than dessert.  Sometimes, he only <br/>
eats a little and asks for dessert.  I let him have it.  He may come <br/>
back an hour later and ask me to heat up his mac and cheese.  That&#39;s <br/>
fine.  He is very rule oriented so it should be interesting when he <br/>
realizes he can ask for a brownie before a meal.  My 2yo suffers <br/>
from no such flaws&lt;g&gt; and pretty much grabs what he wants.  Many <br/>
times leaving the brownie and choosing grapes.  I have never placed <br/>
any restrcitions or food demands on him.  Good Luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is my BIL.  He spent years FIGHTING with his son every night at <br/>
the table where everyone had to eat together.  His son was a very <br/>
picky eater, which I can understand as I have one.  He would force <br/>
him to eat or go to bed with nothing.  My SIL told me she wanted to <br/>
hide in the bathroom, it was such a stressful time.  He was so set <br/>
on having that family dinner time that he missed the big picture <br/>
which was he was ruining the precious little time he had with his <br/>
kids.  my BIL HATES NEW FOOD!!  He will not try most of new things, <br/>
no Chinese, no Indian, etc.  How can you force your child to try new <br/>
food when you do not???<br/>
<br/>
That whole situation used to blow my mind.  I have a fussy eater.  <br/>
He lived off peanut butter on wholewheat sliced so the straight side <br/>
of the bread and curved side were on opposite sides for a year.  Now <br/>
it is mac and cheese for lunch and dinner.  Sometimes, it is <br/>
certainly frustrating.  However, it is never worth the arguement.  <br/>
He is happy, he eats and if he wants to try things one day, he has a <br/>
long life to do it.  <br/>
<br/>
People like him (and I love my BIL) love to gloat that their methods <br/>
worked.  So their child eats better now, at what cost?<br/>

We don&#39;t have a dinner time here either.  My husband works nights <br/>
and doesn&#39;t even get up until noon, then leaves for work around 3pm <br/>
so my DD and I are pretty much on our own most days.  I eat when I&#39;m <br/>
hungry and she just lets me know when she is so that I can get her <br/>
something to eat.  The only thing that I do try to do is get her to <br/>
eat dinner around 6pm or so but only because she goes to sleep about <br/>
7:30 or 8pm.  But, if she&#39;s not hungry, she dosen&#39;t eat.  I have put <br/>
food out at 6pm and she refused to eat, yelling at me until I put <br/>
the food away.  Then, she climbed up in my lap and fell asleep.  Of <br/>
course, she ate a great breakfast!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635880029">Thank you everybody for your insight.  I will go with my instinct and let my <br/>

more often, as one of you posted.<br/>

the same category as Berenstain Bears at all, which I do find to be <br/>
extremely preachy and which make the father out to be a total doofus <br/>
and the rhyming little verses (in which the lesson-to-be-learned is <br/>
spelled out in case we didn&#39;t get it from the story) are just awful.<br/>
<br/>
Last week Rosie had the stomach flu - considerable vomiting involved. <br/>
After a pretty awful night, I finally got her out on the living room <br/>
couch and settled down with something in her arms to throw up into, if <br/>
needed, and turned on the tv, hoping to distract her from her misery.<br/>
<br/>
It was Arthur and the episode was called &quot;Vomitorious&quot; - I&#39;m not <br/>
kidding. The whole episode was about Francine repeatedly throwing up in <br/>
front of other people.<br/>
