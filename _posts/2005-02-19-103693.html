<div id="ygrps-yiv-172484301">-=-My son can fight against me and voice out his opinion when I have done something he feels is wrong. That&#39;s great and I welcome it. It means he&#39;s developing into his own man. How much more could a mother ask for? Does that mean I back down? No...-=-<br/>
<br/>
This makes me uncomfortable, on an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
My children don&#39;t fight against me.  They never have. <br/>
<br/>
How can that be?<br/>
<br/>
-=-No... because then he didn&#39;t develop into his own man inspite of someone else opposing him, he developed into someone who doesn&#39;t see that people have their own choices and demands on life as well. He&#39;s developed without challenge and opposition. And life, my friends, as we all very well know, is filled to the hilt with opposition. -=-<br/>
<br/>
My children are 13, 16 and 18.  They are their own people despite the fact that their parents did not oppose them.  They&#39;re good people, too.   They have found opposition outside the family sometimes, but they handle it well.  <br/>
<br/>
Life is filled with oppostion, but in the absence of being forced to go to school, an individual can pretty much avoid the opposition.<br/>
<br/>
Our family life is not filled with opposition. If it were, I wouldn&#39;t be proud of it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He makes his<br/>
own choices every day... and so do I, very independent of each other. We don&#39;t talk about those choices... just live them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is contradicted by things earlier in that same post, and is problematical in light of the many uses of &quot;we believe&quot; and &quot;we agree&quot; in earlier posts.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And as a family, there is compromise and discussion, challenge and even arguements and the agreement to not agree.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are two of you.  It&#39;s conversation.  It&#39;s awareness of one another in the home.  Ideally, it&#39;s loving acceptance of differences.  It sounds more oppositional than it needs to be.<br/>
