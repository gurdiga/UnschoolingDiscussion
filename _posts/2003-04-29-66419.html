<br/>
Late fall seems better as New England is very busy in the early fall. I for <br/>
one don&#39;t care  to camp in the summer, we camp on our property in New <br/>
Hampshire in the summer and it is too hot and the mosquitos are terrible. <br/>
Spring is a much better time. Also another bad thing about camping in the <br/>
Northeast is the tics and Lyme disease. No matter how much we &quot;loaded up&quot; we <br/>
still ended up with Lyme disease all 3 of us. So, in my opinion (only because <br/>
you asked) Camping may not be suitable for all plus there would be the issue <br/>
of transportation for others that were flying in and such. Things can get <br/>
pretty expensive camping compared to staying in a hotel but it is fun. I&#39;m <br/>
open to either as we drive everywhere anyway.<br/>
