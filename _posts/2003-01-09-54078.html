 </span></blockquote>Hummm..really......<br/>
<br/>
Mine have to do their chores or they will have privileges taken away. Failure <br/>
to do that can also be grounds to contract the work out to other siblings and <br/>
they would have to pay them out of their allowance. I learn that one from the <br/>
famiy at timberdoddle.<br/>
They have a chore list or a set of things that they must do everyday.<br/>
We cannot afford for someone to slack off and not pull their weight around <br/>
here.<br/>
There are 9 people in this house and will be 10 in August.<br/>
What they fail not to do affects others in the house.<br/>
Energy does not flow right when things are cluttered.<br/>
Besides, I feel that it would be unfair for my hubby to come home and do <br/>
their jobs after he has been away for 6 days.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Mine have to do their chores<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do they have to? What will happen to your chldren if they don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
Children *have to* breath.  If the consequences were natural you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have to impose them. You don&#39;t need to impose consequences on not breathing<br/>
do you? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
We *choose* to make them do chores.<br/>
<br/>
When we think in terms of forcing children being the only solution to a<br/>
problem then we&#39;ll assume we &quot;have to&quot; or they &quot;have to&quot; because &quot;we have no<br/>
choice&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not true. It&#39;s someting we choose to do.<br/>
<br/>
That does&#39;t mean the other solutions are easy to find in this world where<br/>
making children do things is the norm. But when we value our chldren&#39;s<br/>
feelings above the cleanliness of the house, then we&#39;re motivated to find<br/>
ways that work better.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll admit to being coercive about cleaning when someone is coming to visit.<br/>
At those times my daughter is motivated by doing as little as she can get<br/>
away with. (I don&#39;t blame her!) It also makes her reluctant to help clean<br/>
when I ask her to help.<br/>
<br/>
But now that she&#39;s 11, when I ask (and she can say no and do it when it&#39;s<br/>
convenient for her), and especially when I&#39;m right there with her doing it,<br/>
or when she sees something she feels she&#39;s able to help with, she does. (As<br/>
long as it isn&#39;t about dealing with all the drawing and writing papers she<br/>
generates which even I find overwhelming ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have suggestions for 9 kids but I know Cheryl Seelhoff had at least<br/>
that many (some are now grown) and Kathy/Sofar8 (if anyone remembers her<br/>
from AOL) exceeded her screen name I&#39;m pretty sure ;-) and neither one of<br/>
them was coercive parents. I think the message board for Cheryl&#39;s Gentle<br/>
Spirit magazine is still up. Non-coercive parenting (NCP) is one of the<br/>
things they talk about there.<br/>
