<div id="ygrps-yiv-85855609">Dunno how relevant this, is but my 8-year-old recently asked why girls <br/>
aren&#39;t &quot;juniors&quot; named after their mothers. So I thought about our family <br/>
trees and it&#39;s true that there are no girls with the mom&#39;s full name, though the <br/>
middle name often is either the mom&#39;s maiden name or a grandmother&#39;s first <br/>
name, and the first name often belongs to several people already beloved by that <br/>
family, going back many generations.<br/>
<br/>
       But my parents always told me I wasn&#39;t named for anyone, that they had <br/>
broken from family tradition and given me a name that didn&#39;t refer to anyone <br/>
else, a name especially for me. <br/>
<br/>
       This notion charmed me and probably influenced the fact that 35 years <br/>
later, for our own daughter, we chose a name we just found beautiful and for <br/>
her alone, not naming her &quot;after&quot; anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
       The funny part is now that she&#39;s become such a theatre buff, she tells <br/>
various stories among her fellow performers about the legacy of where her <br/>
first and middle names came from. The latest -- quite plausible -- version she&#39;s <br/>
having fun with is that her first name came from a famous Broadway <br/>
composer-choreographer, while her middle name was given in honor of the Wizard of Oz <br/>
movie. <br/>

anywhere -- maybe someone can persuade me this is a foolish precaution even for a <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been using all our real names for most of my 8 years on line and never<br/>
had a problem. (Though I do usually write &quot;my husband&quot; and &quot;my daughter&quot; in<br/>
posts just because it seems odd to be using their names when responding to<br/>
people who haven&#39;t met them. Their names just don&#39;t &quot;sound&quot; right in my head<br/>
when I read it back.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the only Joyce Fetteroll in the world so even if I never mentioned<br/>
living in Medfield MA I&#39;m easily locatable. None of us have ever had<br/>
problems because of that.<br/>
<br/>
Just like the real world, on the internet there are more risky places to be<br/>
and less risky places to be. Pretty much the only places I communicate with<br/>
people are homeschooling areas and those haven&#39;t generated any problems for<br/>
us at all.<br/>

Not so funny Google story.  I had someone using my social security <br/>
number to file taxes.  They didn&#39;t know my name, so I&#39;m thinking they <br/>
just made up a number and it happened to be mine.  There was a thread <br/>
on a message board I was on about identity theft so I related my <br/>
story along with the names of the people who were using my SS <br/>
number.  About 3 or 4 months later, the husband contacted me!  He was <br/>
getting a divorce and he googled his wife&#39;s name and my post popped <br/>
up!  That was so freaky!  I contacted the police to ask them whether <br/>
or not I should answer the post.  They said there was no reason to <br/>
answer or not to, so to just do what I felt comfortable doing.  So I <br/>
set up a free email and contacted him with questions that he <br/>
answered.  We&#39;ve never spoken since but he gave me the information I <br/>
needed about his wife and I passed the information to the proper <br/>
authorities.  He said he was just as shocked as I was to see his <br/>
wife&#39;s name on Google.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve Googled my own name and there is never a reference to me.  There <br/>
is another Crystal Pina, though, in TX.  And there is Crystal Lite, <br/>
Pina Colada flavor.  But, not much else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726616977">That&#39;s crazy, Glena.  <br/>
<br/>
Pam, I have a bad habit of transposing numbers and I&#39;m always afraid <br/>
I&#39;ll do that with my SS# so I have to double and triple check my <br/>
returns each year just to make sure.  So far I haven&#39;t done it on my <br/>
taxes.<br/>
<br/>
What I found out from this woman&#39;s husband was that she used my SS# <br/>
to file a second tax return and get two refunds.  He said he didn&#39;t <br/>
know she was doing that and that during their divorce he&#39;s finding <br/>
lots of stuff he didn&#39;t know about her.  They are currently living in <br/>
Taiwan (where she&#39;s from--he&#39;s American) and they are in a custody <br/>
battle for their kids.  I&#39;m not sure how much of his story I believe <br/>
but at least she&#39;s out of the country and I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll be <br/>
able to get back in with the charges that have been filed.<br/>

was originally and it got misspelled at Ellis Island. There&#39;s one Fetteroll<br/>
in England and then my father-in-law and his 4 sons. If you type Fetteroll<br/>
into Google it&#39;s just us. As a matter of fact if you do Google Images,<br/>
you&#39;ll get me, Carl, Kat and my father in law. :-)<br/>

I never would have thought of trying that.  Put my name in and you get 6 <br/>
