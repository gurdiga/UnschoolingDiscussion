<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998587901">Re:  Unschooling and homebased businesses<br/>
<br/>
I unschool my 6 year old son and have had a homebased business for over four<br/>
years. I&#39;m with a 15 year old solid, reputable company.  It&#39;s a risk free<br/>
business that I started with $29.  I don&#39;t stock, inventory, ship or deliver.<br/>
It&#39;s a catalog shopping company that I set up accounts for.  I have several new<br/>
families that are shopping with the catalog because the product line makes<br/>
sense.  Feel free to e-mail me directly if you want more info and I&#39;ll give you<br/>
the websight.<br/>

&gt; Everyone on this list seems to understand everyone elses reasons not to put<br/>
&gt; the kids into Public School, so I need some help.   My husband and I are not<br/>
&gt; getting along.  (For about 5 years now) and I want to get out of the<br/>
&gt; marriage.  I took me a long time to come to this conclusion because I really<br/>
&gt; believe that kids need a daddy too.  But I think they would be better off<br/>
&gt; without one in this case.  Anyhow,  I am really worried about their<br/>
&gt; education should I actually make the leap.  I homeschooled Lili for<br/>
&gt; Preschool this year and loved it.  She also did very well and does not like<br/>
&gt; going to school.  (We tried it for a while)<br/>
&gt; I do not want her to go into a public school and a private school is also<br/>
&gt; something I dont want and could not afford anyway.  If I leave him I will<br/>
&gt; have zero support from my family and I will have to work full time to<br/>
&gt; support my two kids.  Does anyone know any stay at home work opportunities<br/>
&gt; that could actually support two kids?  Any help or suggestions would be<br/>
&gt; greatly appreciated.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi everyone:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I like to hear from people who have their own business at home and<br/>
&gt; &gt;unschool.<br/>
&gt; &gt;How does that work for you.  The logistics?  My husband works outside the<br/>
&gt; &gt;home and I have my own business which I work around the kids.  However,<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone who has a business knows, the phone rings when it wants to and<br/>
&gt; &gt;people<br/>
&gt; &gt;want to talk to me when they want to.  Do you schedule everything at night?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Do you work when the other is home and available for the kids?  Do you work<br/>
&gt; &gt;only weekends?   Does it only work if you both work out of the home?  Do<br/>
&gt; &gt;you<br/>
&gt; &gt;involve the kids in the business?  I&#39;ve been thinking that these are also<br/>
&gt; &gt;some concerns I have about how to balance both and not to hurt either.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt;  enough:( I had also sewn 4 dozen newborn size prefolds that stopped<br/>
&gt;  fitting last week....too small for the size wrap he&#39;s in and too small to<br/>
&gt;  be pinned on (they don&#39;t fit across his belly). &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; hello, i&#39;m jeanne... new to the group... i&#39;m 47, married, 2 children, ted 14<br/>
&gt; and abby 11...almost 12... i homeschooled ted in 1st and 2nd grade... and am<br/>
&gt; homeschooling abby next year for 7th grade... so that&#39;s why i joined this<br/>
&gt; list... so far i haven&#39;t really read any home schooling e-mails... not that i<br/>
&gt; mind at all... i know how lists go and i enjoy sidetracks... i just had to<br/>
&gt; respond to the above, cuz i sure know what you mean... ted was 11lb 14oz and<br/>
&gt; 24&quot; long at birth... he never fit in newborn clothes... we had to cut the<br/>
&gt; bottoms out of those cute little terry after bath thingies cuz he was so<br/>
&gt; constricted in them... lol... he was in medium diapers by his 3rd week...<br/>
&gt; thank gad for diaper service... it saved me from having to buy all different<br/>
&gt; sizes... all i ever got was the big ones... always preferred pre-folds...<br/>
&gt; good for you for sewing your own!<br/>

&gt; Oh, Holly what a tough situation!  I just can&#39;t imagine trying to<br/>
&gt; support a family by myself (though on occasion, I guess like most<br/>
&gt; folks, I&#39;ve tried...) We work from home as accountants, but that<br/>
&gt; involves visiting clients, not practical with kids in tow.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; contemplating a nappy laundry and delivery business, but that<br/>
&gt; would mean a lot of time in the car and doing laundry for the kids,<br/>
&gt; if my mum didn&#39;t live down the road and dh work &#39;odd&#39; hours.  I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know where your expertise lies, but I know folk who are<br/>
&gt; writing or running web-businesses from home.  Apart from that, I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what to say, except that whatever happens, it&#39;ll work<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>

&gt; That does seem a horrible situation for you...When I had kids I took<br/>
&gt; everything that I knew how to do and made it into a business.  My suggestion,<br/>
&gt; if you are up for one, is to get something started before you leave so that<br/>
&gt; you can continue to do the other things that are important in your life, such<br/>
&gt; as your unschooling.  Make a list of all the things you are good at and have<br/>
&gt; experience at and love doing and find something that you can apply that too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hope this is helpful.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Dawn,  and welcome...  My oldest will be 6 in Sept.  When he was 4 we<br/>
&gt; tried the preschool route, too.  It lasted from Aug- the end of Nov.  My son<br/>
&gt; began wanting me to be there all of the time, because I often helped out.  On<br/>
&gt; days that I was not going, he did not want to go either.  Also, he did not<br/>
&gt; like the idea of having to conform to the group, and do things like sing and<br/>
&gt; march around the room with al of the other kids.  He just never liked the<br/>
&gt; idea of doing something just because the group was doing it.  They had a<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving program in Nov, where the kids were to wear Pilgrim hats and<br/>
&gt; sing songs.  When the time came, John would NOT have anything to do with it<br/>
&gt; at all.  He absolutely had no interest in taking part.  All the while, I was<br/>
&gt; considering homeschooling for my kids, and this helped confirm the decision<br/>
&gt; to do so.  There was not anything specifically &quot;wrong&quot; with the preschool<br/>
&gt; program;  it just did not match the needs that my child had.  He requires<br/>
&gt; more freedom, and less conformity than traditional schooling offers.  Forcing<br/>
&gt; him to go to school would not be in his best interest.  Who knows down the<br/>
&gt; road how things  will go; but for now, this is the best decision for him.  We<br/>
&gt; have 2 more children that are younger than John, and at this time, we plan to<br/>
&gt; homeschool them, too.  Your question about  would you be neglecting your<br/>
&gt; child if he was not initiating an area of learning...  Your child is always<br/>
&gt; learning, even if it does not look like it.  Unschooling is something that<br/>
&gt; takes a &quot;leap of faith&quot;.  It takes trusting your child.  It takes knowing<br/>
&gt; that your child wants to learn innately, and as you go along, you will find<br/>
&gt; there are highs and lows.  Times of busy, explosive learning, and times where<br/>
&gt; you wonder if your kid is a slug!  Take time to read as muchas you can on<br/>
&gt; home/unschooling.  There are a lot of great books and web sites available.<br/>
&gt; Hope this is not too long!  Take care~Karen in Ind<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is anyone here a practicing Catholic, or know of some resources<br/>
&gt; for Catholic unschoolers?  In addition to taking my son out<br/>
&gt; of school, it looks like he will be unable to return to his<br/>
&gt; religious education class.  Long story.  I definitely believe in<br/>
&gt; philosophy of child led learning, but I also want to raise<br/>
&gt; my child in my faith.  That seems to be a pretty daunting task<br/>
&gt; at the moment with no family help, no religious ed help, and<br/>
&gt; a child with a very skeptical mind.<br/>

&gt; I do not want her to go into a public school and a private school is also<br/>
&gt; something I dont want and could not afford anyway.  If I leave him I will<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks Karen:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This morning I&#39;ve already contacted the Sonoran Desert Homeschoolers which is<br/>
&gt; an organization of about 90 families in Tucson that homeschool and unschool.<br/>
&gt; We seem to be lucky because there is also a group called TELEO as well, that<br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t had time to reach.  There are also several Christian based groups<br/>
&gt; if I had wanted to have religion as a prominent part of our lives.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; talked to a couple of mothers already and feeling a lot better about my<br/>
&gt; decision.  I know logically that it makes sense.  Something one of them told<br/>
&gt; me was that I would probably end up changing all my friends as the ones I<br/>
&gt; have now, who don&#39;t homeschool or unschool, will probably feel threatened by<br/>
&gt; what I&#39;m doing and to expect a backlash.  However she also said there is tons<br/>
&gt; of support for what we want to do as well... We&#39;ve had the same experience<br/>
&gt; with Zak and the preschool.  He always wants us to be there with him all the<br/>
&gt; time and so therefore what would the point be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again.<br/>

&gt; Subject: India House Building Update<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear friends <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please forgive this form letter, but I wanted to communicate with you as<br/>
&gt; quickly as possible.  Some of the families on this list (and others of<br/>
&gt; you as well) have contributed to a small fund I formed with the proceeds<br/>
&gt; from my homeschooling book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;<br/>
&gt; (www.skylarksings.com) to help build 10,000 cyclone-proof houses in the<br/>
&gt; coastal areas of southeast India.  The funds were to be used to purchase<br/>
&gt; two cinder block-making machines.  These houses  which people in the<br/>
&gt; villages are being trained to build themselves  are replacing homes<br/>
&gt; made of mud and straw, with thatched roofs that rot easily, which are<br/>
&gt; wet inside (with children sleeping on the floor) during the entire<br/>
&gt; monsoon season, and which are often destroyed in seasonal flooding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am pleased to report that the machines were purchased in February and<br/>
&gt; building is now under well underway. Each house requires 600 blocks and<br/>
&gt; contains 352 square feet of living space (this can be a little more than<br/>
&gt; double an average poor familys current living space, if you can believe<br/>
&gt; it!), plus a veranda, with space for a kitchen garden and cattle shed at<br/>
&gt; the back.  These villages are made up of 11,000 families whose ancestors<br/>
&gt; had been landless laborers for up to 700 years, but now have regained<br/>
&gt; land peacefully through the efforts of my Indian mothers organization,<br/>
&gt; Land for the Tillers Freedom (LAFTI).  As a result of her work in land<br/>
&gt; reform, she has now been formally nominated for the International Right<br/>
&gt; Livelihood Award, which is the alternative Nobel Prize awarded by the<br/>
&gt; Swedish Parliament, and given to individuals or groups who making a<br/>
&gt; lasting difference in the lives of communities through dedication to<br/>
&gt; human rights, social justice, community development, and environmental<br/>
&gt; restoration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I now have pictures of the blocks being made through a joint effort of<br/>
&gt; men, women, and children, and the pride in the faces of the people is<br/>
&gt; impossible to describe.  I will try to find a way to post the pictures<br/>
&gt; on the web sometime soon.  My mother takes special pleasure in reporting<br/>
&gt; that in her previous housebuilding efforts, trees (which are very scarce<br/>

&gt; Subject: India House Building Update<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dear friends <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please forgive this form letter, but I wanted to communicate with you as<br/>
&gt; quickly as possible.  Some of the families on this list (and others of<br/>
&gt; you as well) have contributed to a small fund I formed with the proceeds<br/>
&gt; from my homeschooling book &quot;And the Skylark Sings with Me&quot;<br/>
&gt; (www.skylarksings.com) to help build 10,000 cyclone-proof houses in the<br/>
&gt; coastal areas of southeast India.  The funds were to be used to purchase<br/>
&gt; two cinder block-making machines.  These houses  which people in the<br/>
&gt; villages are being trained to build themselves  are replacing homes<br/>
&gt; made of mud and straw, with thatched roofs that rot easily, which are<br/>
&gt; wet inside (with children sleeping on the floor) during the entire<br/>
&gt; monsoon season, and which are often destroyed in seasonal flooding.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am pleased to report that the machines were purchased in February and<br/>
&gt; building is now under well underway. Each house requires 600 blocks and<br/>
&gt; contains 352 square feet of living space (this can be a little more than<br/>
&gt; double an average poor familys current living space, if you can believe<br/>
&gt; it!), plus a veranda, with space for a kitchen garden and cattle shed at<br/>
&gt; the back.  These villages are made up of 11,000 families whose ancestors<br/>
&gt; had been landless laborers for up to 700 years, but now have regained<br/>
&gt; land peacefully through the efforts of my Indian mothers organization,<br/>
&gt; Land for the Tillers Freedom (LAFTI).  As a result of her work in land<br/>
&gt; reform, she has now been formally nominated for the International Right<br/>
&gt; Livelihood Award, which is the alternative Nobel Prize awarded by the<br/>
&gt; Swedish Parliament, and given to individuals or groups who making a<br/>
&gt; lasting difference in the lives of communities through dedication to<br/>
&gt; human rights, social justice, community development, and environmental<br/>
&gt; restoration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I now have pictures of the blocks being made through a joint effort of<br/>
&gt; men, women, and children, and the pride in the faces of the people is<br/>
&gt; impossible to describe.  I will try to find a way to post the pictures<br/>
&gt; on the web sometime soon.  My mother takes special pleasure in reporting<br/>
&gt; that in her previous housebuilding efforts, trees (which are very scarce<br/>
&gt; in coastal South India) had to be cut down to fuel the firing of<br/>
&gt; bricks.  Cinder blocks, which provide excellent insulation against the<br/>
&gt; heat, can be made from all locally-available materials and require only<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi Renee-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re practicing Catholics and unschool and none of my kids go to CCD<br/>
&gt; (religious ed.)  We have 7 children...aged 13 down to 6 mos.<br/>
&gt; We use all kind of resources to teach our kids the Faith in our home.  We<br/>
&gt; read lots of stories and the gospels-we go to Mass together.  But, I think<br/>
&gt; the kids are especially open to the rich traditions that the church offers,<br/>
&gt; so we try to implement as many of those as we can in our home...like<br/>
&gt; celebrating feast days, lighting candles, singing songs at home.  I&#39;ve always<br/>
&gt; liked that about the Catholic Faith-that there are so many &quot;tangible,<br/>
&gt; hands-on&quot; ways to celebrate what we believe.<br/>
&gt; And really, those skeptical kids are the fun ones...they really cause you to<br/>
&gt; have to stop and think about what you believe!<br/>
&gt; If you need some catalog resources, let me know.<br/>
&gt; You can e-mail me privately.<br/>

&gt; Subject: Japan&#39;s ODA in the schools<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi again all,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A Japanese newspaper carried this interesting story yesterday about the<br/>
&gt; promotion of &quot;overseas development assistance&quot; in Japanese school<br/>
&gt; curriculums.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sounds nice on the surface, but there is one glaring omission: Japan has<br/>
&gt; come under heavy fire in years past for the way its ODA is &quot;distributed&quot;<br/>
&gt; to so-called underdeveloped nations around the world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; More often than not, the Japanese government grants this ODA to projects<br/>
&gt; that Japanese corporations are involved in overseas. And guess what: Lots<br/>
&gt; of those Japanese corporations working in those poorer countries have<br/>
&gt; contracts directly or indirectly with the Japanese government. Many<br/>
&gt; people in and outside Japan have been blasting the Japanese government<br/>
&gt; for this practice for years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funny how these kinds of facts conveniently get omitted from news stories<br/>
&gt; -- and classroom curriculums as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Japanese Education Ministry&#39;s motivation for pushing ahead with this<br/>
&gt; dubious curriculum in public schools becomes apparent in the last<br/>
&gt; paragraph of the story.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; [Daily Yomiuri - 20 June 2000]<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; MATERIALS TO TEACH KIDS ABOUT NATION&#39;S ODA<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Foreign Ministry has produced educational materials designed to help<br/>
&gt; children better understand the role Japan plays in funding aid programs<br/>
&gt; through official development assistance, and has distributed the<br/>
&gt; materials to 3,000 primary schools nationwide.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Subtitled &quot;To Make Everyone Smile,&quot; the materials are a 22-minute video<br/>
&gt; and a teacher&#39;s booklet, and is designed for sixth-grade students,<br/>
&gt; ministry officials said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The video discusses Japan&#39;s economic recovery after World War II and<br/>
&gt; international assistance given to Japan after the Great Hanshin<br/>
&gt; Earthquake in Kobe. It also focuses on the difficulties facing developing<br/>
&gt; countries, which account for about 80 percent of all the nations of the<br/>
&gt; world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The fact that ODA from Japan, the largest ODA contributor, has been used<br/>
&gt; to build bridges and schools in many countries is also explained in the<br/>
&gt; video.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Following the advice of schoolteachers, the video also contains a number<br/>
&gt; of quizzes. The booklet accompanying the video gives three examples of<br/>
&gt; how to use the material in the classroom, the officials said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With the nation in the grip of a prolonged economic recession, some have<br/>
&gt; criticized the giving of massive amounts of ODA. However, one teacher who<br/>
&gt; used the materials in class said that, by using the material, students<br/>
&gt; came to think of Japan as a good country and could take pride in being<br/>
&gt; Japanese.<br/>
