<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172733384">Hi all,<br/>
    It&#39;s Janice, I wrote awhile back, many of you posted some very <br/>
helpful advice at the Unschooling Message board, when I told about my <br/>
challenge of &#39;trying&#39; to home or un school at the same time.  I put <br/>
it under What&#39;s on Your Mind, and my subject was: Trying to get back <br/>
into the unswing of thing.  Anyway, I wanted to thank you who cared <br/>
enough to help me, and I must say, that I have since taken a lot of <br/>
the advice I received, and have &#39;calmed&#39; down in a sense, so that <br/>
more of our days are relaxed, unpressured, but productive in some <br/>
small way.  I don&#39;t put grades down anymore, but I do check what they <br/>
do in their workbooks, if that&#39;s the case.  We go to the library, and <br/>
they pick out books on subjects they are truly interested in, and <br/>
it&#39;s amazing to see how much they are really loving &#39;learning&#39;.  I <br/>
don&#39;t feel so stressed, and neither do they.  We begin our day with <br/>
prayer, and we talk for about half an hour about what some of our <br/>
goals for the week might be, and then we just do what comes natural.  <br/>
It&#39;s a little hard to feel totally unguilty about this, but I AM <br/>
going to get there! <br/>
<br/>
     My daughter, Heather, will technically be started &quot;high&quot; school <br/>
in September, and while I am not opposed to continuing teaching her <br/>
at home, my husband has some doubts, especially since these years <br/>
lead up to college, and so on and so forth.  I would truly appreciate <br/>
your suggestions, or ideas on what would be a good approach at this <br/>
point, because I really want to do the right thing.  I thank you <br/>
again, and will look forward to hearing from you.   Janice</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-604483556">Hi Janice,<br/>
<br/>
I remember responding to your post at unschooling.com. I&#39;m glad that some of the suggestions there have helped you and that you are starting to relax and calm down about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve probably already heard about or read this book, but just in case, have you or your daugther read<br/>
The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School and Get a Real Life and Education (1998 edition) by Grace Llewellyn? That is one to read especially for teens.<br/>
<br/>
About your husband, it sounds like he is much more hesitant about unschooling than you are. If you are truly unschooling, your daughter should be able to focus learning about things that really interest her. You and your dh should not worry so much about covering the basics so she can get into college. The right approach would be to listen to and allow your daughter to pursue what she loves. At some point she may be able to find a job or volunteer in the area she&#39;s interested in. If SHE really wants to go to college, she can start taking college courses even before she has &quot;graduated&quot; from high school, if that&#39;s something you all agree upon.<br/>
<br/>
I am not talking from experience, however, this is just what I have read about how to handle unschooling high school. In fact, I think there is a recent thread started at unschooling.com about that very subject. But, those teen years will be here before I know it, for my boys, and reading other&#39;s experiences about unschooling high school and entering college/universities is putting my mind at ease for the future.<br/>
<br/>
I believe there are others here with current unschooling highschool experience that will answer your questions more directly.<br/>
<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781394722">Hi Janice,<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m not sure what you are asking.  DO you need help <br/>
convincing your hubby that things are okay?  Or are you insecure in <br/>
continuing now that your daughter is getting older?<br/>
<br/>
Mine are 16, 14 and 10.  I wouldn&#39;t dream of putting them in school <br/>
or even becoming more structured at this point.  They surprise me <br/>
with what they know sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
As for college, if she can read and do basic math, she is well enough <br/>
prepared for most state colleges IMHO.  The people I went to college <br/>
with recently did not seem much more advanced academically than my <br/>
girls were 2 years ago.  I wouldn&#39;t worry if I were you!<br/>

How does Heather feel about her high school years?  Is she content doing<br/>
what she&#39;s doing now or is she wanting a change?  Does she have any<br/>
particular ideas about what she wants to be doing 5 years from now?<br/>
Particular interests?  Has she expressed a desire to go to college?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229666214">Thanks to all of you who posted back to me regarding my daughter <br/>
Heather.  I should further explain that although I don&#39;t plan to send <br/>
her to school at this point, I just wonder if what I&#39;m doing will be <br/>
enough to help her in life getting a job, and unfortunately, <br/>
competing with others who may be &#39;more qualified&#39;, even though that&#39;s <br/>
not true.  She has always expressed an interest in working with <br/>
animals, but is unsure yet as to what particular field she would like <br/>
to go into.  We encourage her to read about the fields themselves, <br/>
and look into internet, and other resources to see what is available <br/>
to her.  In NJ, there are no testing requirements, and according to <br/>
everything I&#39;ve read about the state&#39;s &#39;formalities&#39;, I seem to be <br/>
pretty much on track.  It&#39;s the pressure I put on myself I think, <br/>
that is causing the frustration.  She too, goes to church and hears <br/>
from her friends about how much they are learning, and what they <br/>
might be doing at certain times, and I think she might feel like <br/>
she&#39;s missing out.  I try to explain that they are coming from a <br/>
whole different perspective, having been in a school environment, not <br/>
knowing or getting the benefits of unschooling at home.  It&#39;s just <br/>
something we need to pray about, but I&#39;m glad to have you all to talk <br/>
to, and I appreciate your suggestions, and support.  God bless you!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580543978">It&#39;s unfortunate how much competition has become a part of our lives from <br/>
very early on...my kids&#39; friends seem to want constantly to &quot;show&quot; how much <br/>
more they are learning in school as though to validate to themselves the <br/>
value of their being there!.Having only been out of public school for the <br/>
last two years, my kids found it difficult to listen to initially.  They <br/>
too were very doubtful of quality versus quantity.  Now they are less quick <br/>
to offend, but still ask me how to answer.  I told them that just as adults <br/>
are wise not to discuss politics or religion with friends, so would they be <br/>
wise not to discuss schooling with theirs.<br/>

Punished by Rewards by Alfie Kohn?  No Contest is about the harmful <br/>
aspects of competition. Punished by Rewards is about how rewards such <br/>
as gold stars and grades harms kids. <br/>

 I was surfing last night and came across an unschooled graduate&#39;s <br/>
website. He mentioned a book that caught my eye,The Selfish Gene by <br/>
Richard Dawkins. Has anybody read it?<br/>

read about some pretty complex ideas of evolution and genetics. The Blind<br/>
Watchmaker is another one of his that comes to mind. (Amazon probably has<br/>
some good reviews and descriptions.)<br/>
