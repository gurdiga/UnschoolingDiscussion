<div id="ygrps-yiv-545229790">This conversation reminded me of something Neil Gaiman said a few months <br/>
ago in an interview with the Star Tribune.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The strange thing about &#39;Coraline&#39; is every now and then I run into adults <br/>
who are really disturbed and upset by it,&quot; said Gaiman. &quot;But so far, I have <br/>
yet to run into any kids who saw it as anything other than a roller-coaster <br/>
ride. I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s because kids have a better sense of what is <br/>
reality and what is fantasy than adults, but that&#39;s very true. Kids know <br/>
what is real and what isn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, he said, kids and adults &quot;are reading different genres. Kids are <br/>
reading a book about someone like them who is going up against something <br/>
scary and triumphing. Adults are reading a book about a child in danger. A <br/>
child in danger is a different kind of story; it particularly troubles <br/>
adults. But I think it&#39;s very good for kids to be told that the world is <br/>
not always a safe and hospitable place.&quot;</div>
