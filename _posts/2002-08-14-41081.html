&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think chucking a kid out of the house at a certain age to make it on <br/>
&gt;their own is something like throwing a kid in the water so he&#39;ll learn to swim.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, no one ever said that.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my boys still live at home, and they&#39;re always welcome here, as <br/>
long as they&#39;re working or looking for a job or in college.  Not that <br/>
there&#39;s not an exception to every rule.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same with my youngest, only he started at 12.  But then he has the <br/>
advantage of always having been unschooled.  Our other kids spent all those <br/>
school years following orders and never figuring out what they wanted to <br/>
do.  I think this is the same for the boy in question.<br/>
<br/>
And I still don&#39;t think there&#39;s any magic age for a child to be ready to <br/>
function as an adult.<br/>
