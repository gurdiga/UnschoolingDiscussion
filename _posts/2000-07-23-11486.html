<div id="ygrps-yiv-37127702">Just an interesting tidbit:<br/>
<br/>
My parents adopted my sister when she was a baby. Fifteen years later I was born. Then, when I was 10, my parents took in a foster girl who was 8 months older than I. So, I&#39;m an only and a youngest!<br/>
<br/>
And another (I love this story):<br/>
<br/>
My adopted sister&#39;s biological mother was an identical twin. Both twins were impregnated by the same man within months of each other. The two resulting babies, my sister and her half-sister/cousin, didn&#39;t look especially alike, but despite the fact that they were raised apart, they share so many traits that you can really tell they&#39;re related.<br/>
