<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208813767">Good morning all;<br/>
       First, thank you all for your responses, both public and private to<br/>
my last post. Now that I have decided to keep Chris home, his school<br/>
principal sent DSS to my doorstep bright and early Friday morning. I am<br/>
being &quot;investigated&quot; for abuse and neglect. They state his abscences(four<br/>
doctors visits with notes, a three day suspension at their hands, one day<br/>
where he had a doctors appointment but his doctor was having an emergency<br/>
tonsilectomy and one day he missed the bus), the fact that I could not get<br/>
his meds for a week(thus I was denying him medical attention), and he<br/>
supposedly came to school &quot;dirty&quot; twice as proof or suspicion that I am<br/>
guilty of neglect.<br/>
<br/>
     To make matters worse, they called the investigator in just as soon as<br/>
I left their evaluation meeting on Friday and the investigator &quot;interviewed&quot;<br/>
my son for about an hour. I did not know this until he told me that the<br/>
investigator was his &quot;friend&quot; and upon further questioning Chris told me<br/>
about their interview in glorious detail. He said the man kept asking if I<br/>
spanked him, if Mike spanked him, if anyone had touched him &quot;someplace<br/>
bad&quot;... dolls and puppets included.<br/>
<br/>
     I know that I am within my rights and that I am not guilty of anything,<br/>
but that does not make any of this any easier. The only mention of<br/>
homeschooling during his visit here was to say that he could not tell me who<br/>
had sent him but that the school considers Chris &quot;high risk&quot; because he<br/>
tested behind grade (He could not sit still long enough to finish the tests.<br/>
What he did, he scored a perfect 100...no questions missed), needs<br/>
medication and they feel that I lack the resources to educate him properly.<br/>
Geez... How stupid do I look? He didn&#39;t have to draw me a road map.<br/>
<br/>
   I&#39;m not whining guys. No matter how thrilled I am to have Chris at home,<br/>
I knew in my heart of hearts that this would happen. I have no regrets, I am<br/>
just angry about this. And I am scared, I&#39;ll admit it. Anyone homeschooling<br/>
in SC has at least heard the rumors of it happening to others if it has not<br/>
happened to them. This is harrassment dressed up in the guise of concern for<br/>
my child&#39;s welfare by people who are running scared.<br/>
<br/>
     There was an article in the Goose Creek Gazette this week where the<br/>
head of the department of children at risk, Phyliss Thornwaite, lamented the<br/>
loss of these children into a system that is not well regulated(read: They<br/>
cannot control those of us who pick option number three (accountability<br/>
organizations) I am now a proud member of PACESC as of this weekend. We<br/>
threaten their bottom line.) and they fear that the children cannot be<br/>
properly assessed to return to mainstream schooling. HOW ARROGANT? Why would<br/>
I want to put my child back into such a toxic environment now that I have<br/>
him out of it?<br/>
<br/>
      So I guess there&#39;s not much left to do but wait, get my ducks in a<br/>
row, and enjoy my child despite the enourmous stress that I am under at the<br/>
moment. At least I got to enjoy a short moment of unfettered joy with my<br/>
child before the war started. Xena Warrior Unschooling Goddess signing off<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17875654">Oh Virginia,  my heart goes out to you.  Keep your chin up!  I can&#39;t believe that agencies actually take the time to torment families like this.  It is so ridiculous.  If they could only see that usually the children that are neglected or abused are the ones in school.  IMO<br/>
Can&#39;t they see that people who take their kids out of school are the type of parents who are involved in their childrens education and lives.  <br/>
I will be sending good thoughts to you from up north.<br/>
Love, Kelli T<br/>

I like your approach.  When dealing with DSS, speak softly and carry a<br/>
large sword. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Accountability&quot; is a word that really pisses me off.  It&#39;s<br/>
bureacrat-speak for &quot;meddling interference&quot;.  In California, my choices<br/>
for governor in Novemember are the incumbent, a Democrat with close<br/>
financial ties to the teachers&#39; union or a Republican who says fairly<br/>
nice things about homeschooling but uses the dreaded word<br/>
&quot;accountability&quot;.  Not a very inspiring choice.<br/>
<br/>
I hope everything is resolved in your favor very quickly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>my<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Pam...<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, DSS showed up on my doorstep at 8:30 am. We had all slept in<br/>
as planned. I was on the phone with the social worker who the school sent<br/>
out to &quot;investigate&quot; me a few weeks ago(She called me at 7:30). Mike was<br/>
waking up and Chris had been up about twenty minutes. He was watching<br/>
Nickeloden. When he heard a car drive up, Chris thought it was my sister in<br/>
law. Then he saw the worker, who he already knew. Chris let him in. He was a<br/>
&quot;friend&quot; as far as Chris was concerned because he had spent so much time<br/>
with the guy the day before. The principal told him that the investigator<br/>
was there to &quot;protect&quot; him. Can you believe that? An attorney at that point<br/>
was not exactly an option. As you might imagine, we have had a long talk<br/>
with Chris about opening doors to people.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know anybody - ask your state homeschooling organization<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or you can call the trial lawyers association for your state. Ask your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>state<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; organization for material to provide to your attorney to bring him/her up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; speed on your state&#39;s homeschooling law.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am just now begining to know where to start with all this. I have print<br/>
outs of the law in my state, in case I need them (which I probably will). At<br/>
the moment, a lawyer is out of the realm of my financial abilty. To get a<br/>
pro se lawyer in SC, you have to be on a waiting list and it basically has<br/>
to be an easy case, from what they told me when I called a few weeks ago,<br/>
when the first investigator showed up. But they put me on the waiting list.<br/>
It could be months before I hear back from them. Right now we are waiting to<br/>
exhale. Mike is applying for social security (He was elcectrocuted on the<br/>
job in 1999 by a waffle baker at the Waffle House). If it comes through the<br/>
back pay he is owed will be more than enough to pay for a decent lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
DSS has way too much power - far  beyond we would normally think is<br/>
possible - it is risky to try to face them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; down on your own. You may not need anything except a phone call or a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>letter<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from your lawyer -- but you never know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope all I will need is a phone call or a letter. This is my second trip<br/>
down this road and my want to homeschool my child was just as big a part of<br/>
it then as it is now. I know how risky this is. Unfortunately, so does my<br/>
son. We used to whisper in our house until after 3:30pm everyday. That is<br/>
when DSS stops sending out people to investigate. We spent our weekends<br/>
cleaning house. He had nightmares about being taken away. The school allowed<br/>
him to let DSS interview him on three seperate occasions the last time. I<br/>
did not know that they can&#39;t do that then. Chris had a nightmare last night.<br/>
It will be the last one he has and I really do not care who I have to piss<br/>
off, mow over or knock out of my way to get all of this to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They&#39;ve already interviewed your son without your permission and you&#39;ve<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them at your door. You don&#39;t say if you let them in and talked to them at<br/>
&gt; that time or what they say the next step is going to be<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mike showed them in, answered all their questions in a manner that I would<br/>
call intimidating as hell. Mike is a big guy who looks like Santa Claus<br/>
crossed with a Hell&#39;s Angel. The investigator was this little wet behind the<br/>
ears, just out of school kid who was probably just following orders. I told<br/>
him that I had been through this before and that I KNEW he could only make<br/>
one more &quot;drop in&quot; visit during the next 45 days. I told him I KNEW that,<br/>
when he returned, if he found nothing to substaniate their allegations he<br/>
HAD TO, BY LAW, drop the investigation and I had to be sent a letter giving<br/>
the dispensation of the investigation. I did not know any of this the first<br/>
time. That is how they got away with so much of this BS the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The next step? I mowed my lawn, cleaned my house and washed the rest of the<br/>
clothes (Actually Mike did most of it while I read, wrote emails and worked<br/>
with Chris.) We are not doing anything wrong and all of the things they are<br/>
accusing me are out right lies. Unless DSS in SC honestly wants to be in<br/>
court with me accusing them of harrassment, falsification of records, libel,<br/>
slander (which ever one applies in this case) and anything else I can get a<br/>
righteously indignant lawyer with a heart of gold to come up with, unless<br/>
they honestly want all the local news media splashed with the image of a<br/>
disabled mom and her beautiful, bright, well taken care of child pleading<br/>
for the understanding and sympathy of other parents in the area... I really<br/>
think that if these people are smart enough to trump up charges and make my<br/>
life hell then they have to be smart enough to figure that I will turn the<br/>
tables on them eventually. And God help them if I do because it is going to<br/>
get nasty. I am sick of running scared.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Pam...<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, DSS showed up on my doorstep at 8:30 am. We had all slept in<br/>
as planned. I was on the phone with the social worker who the school sent<br/>
out to &quot;investigate&quot; me a few weeks ago(She called me at 7:30). Mike was<br/>
waking up and Chris had been up about twenty minutes. He was watching<br/>
Nickeloden. When he heard a car drive up, Chris thought it was my sister in<br/>
law. Then he saw the worker, who he already knew. Chris let him in. He was a<br/>
&quot;friend&quot; as far as Chris was concerned because he had spent so much time<br/>
with the guy the day before. The principal told him that the investigator<br/>
was there to &quot;protect&quot; him. Can you believe that? An attorney at that point<br/>
was not exactly an option. As you might imagine, we have had a long talk<br/>
with Chris about opening doors to people.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t know anybody - ask your state homeschooling organization<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; or you can call the trial lawyers association for your state. Ask your<br/>
 </span></blockquote>state<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; organization for material to provide to your attorney to bring him/her up<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; speed on your state&#39;s homeschooling law.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am just now begining to know where to start with all this. I have print<br/>
outs of the law in my state, in case I need them (which I probably will). At<br/>
the moment, a lawyer is out of the realm of my financial abilty. To get a<br/>
pro se lawyer in SC, you have to be on a waiting list and it basically has<br/>
to be an easy case, from what they told me when I called a few weeks ago,<br/>
when the first investigator showed up. But they put me on the waiting list.<br/>
It could be months before I hear back from them. Right now we are waiting to<br/>
exhale. Mike is applying for social security (He was elcectrocuted on the<br/>
job in 1999 by a waffle baker at the Waffle House). If it comes through the<br/>
back pay he is owed will be more than enough to pay for a decent lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
DSS has way too much power - far  beyond we would normally think is<br/>
possible - it is risky to try to face them<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; down on your own. You may not need anything except a phone call or a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>letter<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; from your lawyer -- but you never know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope all I will need is a phone call or a letter. This is my second trip<br/>
down this road and my want to homeschool my child was just as big a part of<br/>
it then as it is now. I know how risky this is. Unfortunately, so does my<br/>
son. We used to whisper in our house until after 3:30pm everyday. That is<br/>
when DSS stops sending out people to investigate. We spent our weekends<br/>
cleaning house. He had nightmares about being taken away. The school allowed<br/>
him to let DSS interview him on three seperate occasions the last time. I<br/>
did not know that they can&#39;t do that then. Chris had a nightmare last night.<br/>
It will be the last one he has and I really do not care who I have to piss<br/>
off, mow over or knock out of my way to get all of this to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They&#39;ve already interviewed your son without your permission and you&#39;ve<br/>
 </span></blockquote>had<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them at your door. You don&#39;t say if you let them in and talked to them at<br/>
&gt; that time or what they say the next step is going to be<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mike showed them in, answered all their questions in a manner that I would<br/>
call intimidating as hell. Mike is a big guy who looks like Santa Claus<br/>
crossed with a Hell&#39;s Angel. The investigator was this little wet behind the<br/>
ears, just out of school kid who was probably just following orders. I told<br/>
him that I had been through this before and that I KNEW he could only make<br/>
one more &quot;drop in&quot; visit during the next 45 days. I told him I KNEW that,<br/>
when he returned, if he found nothing to substaniate their allegations he<br/>
HAD TO, BY LAW, drop the investigation and I had to be sent a letter giving<br/>
the dispensation of the investigation. I did not know any of this the first<br/>
time. That is how they got away with so much of this BS the first time.<br/>
<br/>
The next step? I mowed my lawn, cleaned my house and washed the rest of the<br/>
clothes (Actually Mike did most of it while I read, wrote emails and worked<br/>
with Chris.) We are not doing anything wrong and all of the things they are<br/>
accusing me are out right lies. Unless DSS in SC honestly wants to be in<br/>

More stuff of nightmares.<br/>
<br/>
If you put your concerns calmly in writing with a copy of the homeschooling <br/>
laws and send it by mail to DSS it will do you more good than any amount of <br/>
writing to us.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t get a lawyer to help you, you should document in CALM writing <br/>
and have it on record soon.<br/>

Fury will work against you.<br/>
