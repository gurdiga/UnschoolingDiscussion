&lt;&lt; I used to love to read the dictionary when I was younger.   I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
read <br/>
it straight through, though.   I would just pop it open and read a page here <br/>
and there.   I still do it every once in awhile if I see the dictionary out.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s strange to see a word you have never heard. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  Sometimes I have a hard time JUST looking something up in a <br/>
dictionary or encyclopedia (or now on Google) because I get distracted by something on <br/>
the side, and then I look something else up because of that, or just start <br/>
reading along and I forget why I went in there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE dictionaries with charts and colored pictures.  When I was a kid we <br/>
had a two-volume dictionary (as lots of people did in those days) and I just <br/>
about memorized every color plate.  Birds of North America.  Amphibians.  Holly <br/>
bought a baby-names book the other day and I told her that when I was a kid I <br/>
used to read the baby-names section of our big dictionary (same dictionary, <br/>
several pages of boys&#39; names and girls&#39;).<br/>
<br/>
I have the American Heritage Encyclopedic Dictionary.   The sad thing is they <br/>
took the etymologies out to put in color illustrations.   But the happy thing <br/>
is I have the one with eymologies right next to it.<br/>
