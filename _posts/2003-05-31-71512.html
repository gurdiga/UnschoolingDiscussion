<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562668023">Hi Karen<br/>
<br/>
I am unschooling three gifted children. Two of them went to school. One for<br/>
four years and one for nine months. They really struggled in the<br/>
one-size-fits-all system.  My oldest son, James, started school with a<br/>
passion for maths. He liked to do maths problems at home and when I showed<br/>
the school what he had been doing they told me it was grade four work. He<br/>
was reading novels independently and with a great deal of pleasure. Once in<br/>
school, he had to sit through pre-reading sessions and &quot;learn&quot; the numbers<br/>
1-10. He was ostracised and bullied and thoroughly miserable. We struggled<br/>
along for four years believing that the school was trying to help whilst my<br/>
son became increasingly depressed and lost interest in life. The school<br/>
tried various strategies including putting him up a grade with mixed<br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
My second son, Matthew, started school reading fluently and with a talent<br/>
for maths. He quickly became bored with the easy work given to him and<br/>
although a model student at school, came home and gave us all hell -<br/>
hitting, kicking, biting and screaming at us. Family life was awful. I<br/>
reread parenting books and did a class but life at home was a NIGHTMARE. We<br/>
were all so stressed all the time, we didn&#39;t even like each other anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I did some research, found out about unschooling, worked up my courage  and<br/>
pulled them out. We have not done any &#39;school&quot; work since but the boys<br/>
learn, do and produce amazing things through their own motivation. They love<br/>
to learn. Their main objection to school was it was so boring and they<br/>
weren&#39;t allowed to learn but expected to sit and wait patiently while the<br/>
teacher taught the others what they already knew. My third son, Stephen, has<br/>
never been to kinder or school but he spent a huge amount of time there with<br/>
me trying to support his brothers, attending meetings and helping out in the<br/>
classroom. He hated it and missed out on a lot at home as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Since being at home (2 1/2 years now), James is no longer depressed and<br/>
withdrawn, Matthew&#39;s stess levels are down and his behaviour has improved,<br/>
Stephen is happier because he has his brothers with him all the time. They<br/>
are great friends.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling gifted kids works and is exciting, rewarding and so much less<br/>
stressful than trying to keep them in school!<br/>
