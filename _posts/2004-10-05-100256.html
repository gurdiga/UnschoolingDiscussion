<div id="ygrps-yiv-590157391">money has been tighter than usual lately and there have been more and more times that i have had to tell my children that we can&#39;t buy something that they want that we normally would be able to buy.   i am tired of telling them that we can&#39;t afford it, we don&#39;t have the money, we can&#39;t buy it.  <br/>
<br/>
i know i read somewhere at some time the titles of some good books on money and kids, talking and learning about money with kids, etc., but of course i can&#39;t find the recommendations anywhere now.<br/>
<br/>
dh gets very frustrated about the way i am saying it.  (ie telling the kids we can&#39;t afford something) and doesn&#39;t want them (the kids) thinking they are poor.<br/>
<br/>
does anyone have any books to recommend or other ways of saying that we don&#39;t have the money to buy something?<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this book would have the wording you&#39;re looking for, <br/>
but it could be a fun way to get the whole family involved in being <br/>
frugal.  &quot;The Tightwad Gazette (I & II) by Amy Dacyczyn (pronounced <br/>
decision).  You should be able to find them at your library.  You could <br/>
turn being frugal into a kind of on-going scavenger hunt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532966894">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m right there with you in that boat. We are having to scale back in <br/>
major ways. Christmas, for one example is going to have to be much <br/>
smaller than it has been in the last couple of years. We&#39;re making a <br/>
lot of our gifts, and we are going to be sending just holiday cards <br/>
to a lot of people we&#39;d normally send presents to. And the kids stuff <br/>
is in layaway instead of just being bought outright.<br/>
We can&#39;t afford to buy a lot of extra stuff for the next few months. <br/>
We have some monthly bills that will be payed off in about 3-5 <br/>
months, things will be much easier financially then. But until then, <br/>
it&#39;s reality. I&#39;m not going to buy stuff we don&#39;t actually need, if <br/>
we are having trouble covering actual needs. Wants will have to wait. <br/>
That isn&#39;t just the kids, that&#39;s me and my husband too. I don&#39;t like <br/>
it, but right now, it&#39;s part of our life. I&#39;ve tried to offer the <br/>
kids real choices. You *CAN* spend X amount of money this month on <br/>
stuff you want. That&#39;s all that is available for that kind of thing <br/>
this month. What would you like to spend your money on? (usually a <br/>
toy or a book but not always)and where do you want to spend it? (they <br/>
really like thrift stores. The money goes a lot farther. LOL) WE have <br/>
also brainstormed together for ways to save money so that we could <br/>
afford to do something the kids really wanted to do. Some of their <br/>
suggestions have been pretty funny. But at least it let them feel a <br/>
part of things.And a couple of their suggestions have really been <br/>
good ones.<br/>
 I remember at one point,when I was about 9 or so, my parents had <br/>
some pretty severe money problems that lasted for a few years. I <br/>
remember that when they finally were honest with me about what the <br/>
problems were, I was okay with it. I knew there was something wrong, <br/>
and what I imagined was much worse than what the reality was. <br/>
I get really tired of having to say, we don&#39;t have the money right <br/>
now, too. But no matter how much I don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s the reality. <br/>
And for right now, I can&#39;t change that a whole lot. All I can do is <br/>
let them know that their needs are being taken care of, they are <br/>
loved, and that isn&#39;t going to change. <br/>

Volumes 1, 2, and 3 are in one book now, &quot;The Complete Tightwad  Gazette.&quot;  I <br/>
think it&#39;s only about 15 or 20 dollars on Amazon.  You&#39;ll  get that much back <br/>
the first month you start implementing her money saving  ideas.  GREAT book!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996193383">We try to go away for the holidays. Little gifts and we spend the money on a<br/>
family trip to see relatives, the ocean, etc..<br/>
The kids have chosen to spend the money on trips instead of toys when given<br/>
the choice.<br/>
We have from the beginning said that we will not spend tons of money on<br/>
christmas, one because it is a commercial holiday and not religious for us.<br/>
At first people gave us a weird time. <br/>
I like the idea of a $100 christmas. <br/>
In our family my mom gives the kids toys and they seem to really like that.<br/>
We love the tightwad gazette. My mom introduced me when she got the original<br/>
newsletters.<br/>

I think that when I see the *Simple* magazine at the checkout (is that what<br/>

Oh Deb, and dear Dylan,<br/>
Pleeeaassseee...feel no shame in making an honest profit - assuming it was your (Dylan&#39;s) intention to sell the watch and didn&#39;t do it only because there was interest expressed in the item by Fire and he was merely attempting to please her material desires with immediate gratification &lt;g&gt;.  My wish for you, Dylan, is that you can recognize that buying and selling can increase your purchasing power and perhaps you will generate the funds for a real antique watch.  otoh- if you really did not intend to sell the item then please donate the money to a worthy cause.  As we say, pass it on...<br/>

<br/>
Between the ages of 10 and 12, he baked cookies every week for profit. He took orders <br/>
from people in our neighborhood, sold some at our homeschool co-op and even sold <br/>
them in front of Walmart once.<br/>
<br/>
In two years, he earned betwen 8-900 dollars. He spent $700 of it on Space Camp this last <br/>
summer.<br/>
<br/>
His reliability in producing cookies led to summer mowing jobs and has expanded now to <br/>
odd jobs (painting, taking care of pets while owners are away, babysitting, etc.). He <br/>
continues to make cookies (made 8 dozen for perpaid orders on Sunday).<br/>
<br/>
He understands the amount it costs to make one batch and is great at budgeting for his <br/>
supplies. He loves having money and has started an admirable collection of LOTR <br/>
paraphenalia (including old copies of JRR Tolkein books and a huge sword) all through e-<br/>
bay where he does the bidding himself. He also bought hs own clothes for fall &quot;because he <br/>
could.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His current goal: to buy a laptop. After that, he plans to save for a trip to Costa Rica with <br/>
AFS. That trip will cost $4000 and he isn&#39;t even intimidated. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m blown away. One of the best things about unschooling for him (this is the kid who <br/>
wanted a curricula, by the way) is that he has had the time to pursue this business without <br/>
it taxing him or becoming a burden.<br/>
<br/>
He has learned so many great things:<br/>
<br/>
**How to present himself to people<br/>
<br/>
**How to fulfill his commitments to produce a tasty produce on time<br/>
<br/>
**How to budget<br/>
<br/>
**How to use a recipe (double, triple, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
**How to keep records<br/>
<br/>
**How to have vision for a goal and then to realize it<br/>
<br/>
**How to use E-bay<br/>
<br/>
**How to be generous (there are times he has made an extra dozen as a gift to the family <br/>
- it&#39;s torture to smell these cookies baking and to know they are leaving the house!)<br/>
<br/>
**How to work hard and translate his good reputation into more work (He knows more <br/>
members of our neighborhood than I do)<br/>
<br/>
**How to plan ahead and budget his time<br/>
<br/>
**How to celebrate his success (both with purchases and savings)<br/>
<br/>
We have five kids. He is the only one who is this gung-ho. We&#39;ve supported his energies <br/>
but have not &quot;made it happen.&quot; The other kids are learning by watching him and I&#39;ve seen <br/>
one of them earn $100 when given the chance to sell coupon books for his sports team.<br/>
<br/>
Just had to share. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a very fiscally motivated young man. LOL WHich space camp <br/>
did he go to? I used to do the jr high level of space academy in <br/>
Huntsville. Being a counselor there was probably the most fun I&#39;ve <br/>
ever gotten paid for. <br/>
I want my kids to go there if they have an interest, and both of them <br/>
are very interested in space related things, so I&#39;m hoping they want <br/>
to go.<br/>
If he&#39;s interested in doing things that are science related, he might <br/>
look into the JASON project.<br/>
You have to jump thru some hoops to do it, but the local science <br/>
museum here did a live link up last year from the jungle, I think in <br/>
costa rica, but I could be wrong. This year they are in the swamps of <br/>
Louisiana. But they have to write an essay and submit what is <br/>
basically a resume to get picked for the project. It&#39;s really a very <br/>
cool program, and there were a couple of homeschoolers(not sure if <br/>
they were unschoolers) on the project last year. It was interesting <br/>
to watch how they document things, and do the experiments.  Seeing <br/>
the kids, some of them fairly young, working with scientists, doing <br/>
research about things they were really interested in, was something I <br/>
liked seeing. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.jasonproject.org/">http://www.jasonproject.org/</a> is the link. I can&#39;t find the page that <br/>
lists how to get to be apart of the yearly trip, but if you contace <br/>
one of the people closest to you about it, I&#39;m sure they can give you <br/>
specifics. Evidently they sell a cirriculum for schools, and have <br/>
developed a seperate one for homeschoolers, but I&#39;m nut sure if <br/>
anyone here would be interested in that. IF I recall, it&#39;s kind of <br/>
pricey. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We did look into it when he began for our state (Ohio). The only rule I remember is that he <br/>
had to package the cookies individually (with saran wrap) if he sold them in a public place <br/>
(like Walmart). But for the neighborhood, there weren&#39;t any regulations at all. I suppose if <br/>
he got really big (there is some kind of earning limit), he&#39;d need the nice kitchen etc.<br/>
<br/>
One of my friends sells cheesecakes to a local coffee house and she just uses her kitchen <br/>
and doesn&#39;t have to meet any state regulations. I think it has to do with volume of sales.<br/>
<br/>
So he just bakes the cookies in our kitchen, using our oven, and pcakages them in saran <br/>
wrap (half a dozen in each package) and then puts them in a ziplock bag.<br/>
<br/>
We donate the wrap and bags to his cause. :)<br/>
<br/>
One tip: Get a truly tasty recipe, take a plate of samples around the neighborhood on the <br/>
first trip (when getting orders) and be sure the cookies are just out of the oven and still <br/>
warm. Chocolate chip cookies (he makes c.c. oatmeal ones) are irrisistible when warm. :)<br/>

That&#39;s the one! He loved it. We had made a deal with him initially that if he could raise the <br/>
money to pay for space camp, we&#39;d cover the flights. He is really into astronomy and has <br/>
his own telescope. He loves to watch the night sky and has taught me everything I know <br/>
about stars and planets (and meteor showers!).<br/>
<br/>
His time at camp was thrilling and the team he was on named him &quot;Cookie Monster&quot; <br/>

You may enjoy reading about &quot;The Muffin Lady&quot;, Linda Fisher. She wrote her<br/>
story in the introduction to her nice little cookbook of that title. She<br/>
began by selling muffins from her little red wagon. When she had a problem<br/>
with the health department, the local community (also her customers) rallied<br/>
around her and she was offered the use of the local firehouse commercial<br/>
style kitchen. It&#39;s a nice story of someone following their passion to earn<br/>
a living and finding fulfillment in the process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282416114">Most times, kids slide by on the bakery thing.  They&#39;re cute... not fair, but sometimes they do.  However, if someone really gets a bug they can make an issue of potential food-borne illnesses, etc...<br/>
<br/>
Check with your local Health Department for food service rules, codes, and safe food-handling regulations.  Additionally, most in-home bakeries are regulated/licensed by the Department of Agriculture and do require some type of inspecting, etc.  Some things may vary by state.  The only time they are not regulated is if you are offering the items for donation only without any &quot;suggested&quot; price - just strict donation.  I would suggest getting the info on safe food-handling from your local health departmetn though - it can be interesting and helpful.<br/>
<br/>
As far as buisness licenses go, that also varies by state and locality.  Again, kids usually skate on this issue too, but if you want you can check into it.  You can check with the state on different types of buisness organizations and associated filing fees, check your local city/township/municipalities for additional licensing and zoning regulations.  Usually you need some type of vendor&#39;s license too.  I believe they don&#39;t charge sales tax on prepared foods in Ohio, but that may vary by state - I don&#39;t know.  Your local SBA (Small Business Association) is great for all that info too - and you can find them online.  Many times the SBA even has pre-made packets of all the different forms and information related to the type of business you want to start.  Very informative resource.<br/>

Laws are different city to city, I think (or county to county) about what can <br/>
be sold how.  Last I knew, the strictest laws apply to non-baked goods here <br/>
(notably things like tamales and burritos, chicken sandwiches, that kind of <br/>
thing).  Pies, cakes, cookies--very loose, because they keep well and are <br/>
unlikely to produce food poisoning (if they even can at all).<br/>
