&gt; if someone wrote back and said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m a Republican<br/>
&gt; unschooler!&quot; :)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I&#39;m not, but my husband is (a Republican unschooler). I&#39;m a liberal<br/>
left-of-the-Democrats unschooler. Surprisingly (not to introduce politics,<br/>
but I will :-), one of the things I disagree with most about the Democratic<br/>
party is their attitude towards school and homeschooling and one of the<br/>
political things that my Republican hubby and I see eye to eye on is the<br/>
need for market competition in the arena of schools instead of throwing more<br/>
money at a failing system.<br/>
<br/>
It takes all kinds :-)<br/>

while. How does that work? Seriously, how do you talk<br/>
about things without getting upset with each other? I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine the closest person in my life, the one I<br/>
sleep next to every night, having such different ideas<br/>
about life and the world. Juli<br/>
