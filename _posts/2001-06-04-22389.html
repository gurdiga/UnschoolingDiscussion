<div id="ygrps-yiv-196474811">I was reading stories to my almost four-year old tonight, when he pointed out to me that the numbers on the two pages are the same. I made a bit of a fuss about him being so smart so he proceeded to find letters that look alike.<br/>
<br/>
I know we&#39;re still a long way off, but it&#39;s great to know that we&#39;re starting the journey. It&#39;s the first time ever he has shown any interest in letters and numbers.<br/>

I didn&#39;t want to work. It was as simple as that. I distrusted work, disliked it. I thought it was a very bad thing that the human race had unfortunately invented for itself. [ from &quot;Endless Night&quot;] <br/>
