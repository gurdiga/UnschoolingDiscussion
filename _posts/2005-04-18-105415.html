<div id="ygrps-yiv-321122839">-=-This site is to encourage and inspire home schoolers to find  peace in <br/>
their home schooling journey. We&#39;ll share and discuss organizing your  day, <br/>
balancing school and home, managing chores, teaching multiple children,  <br/>
stress-free home schooling, renewing your spirit and avoiding burnout,  disciplining <br/>
children, training children and raising children in the nurture and  admonition <br/>
of the Lord. This site is open to all home schoolers willing to share  how to <br/>
make home schooling a joyous undertaking. Specific Topics: Classical home  <br/>
schooling, Calvert School and The Well Trained Mind. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
I found this blurb looking to see where this list had been linked  lately.  I <br/>
just want to talk about the ideas in the description, not about  which list <br/>
it is (I didn&#39;t even look, just lifted this bit  whole).<br/>
 <br/>
I should save this for my (too slowly) growing page on  disrespectful <br/>
attitudes toward children.    I could be wrong, but  I&#39;m guessing that when the <br/>
author used the terms &quot;peace,&quot; &quot;stress-free&quot; and  &quot;joyous,&quot; she meant for the mom, <br/>
not for the children.<br/>
 <br/>
What the kids get will be discipline, training and admonishment  (after the <br/>
chores and teaching).<br/>
 <br/>
This is so common that people can write it and read it without  thinking <br/>
about it, I think.  The idea of really living WITH a child rather  than in fear <br/>
of, in spite of, in martyrly resentment of, in control of, in  opposition to, is <br/>
very, very different so I&#39;m not surprised when people don&#39;t  get it, but <br/>
without dismantling the old way, the new way has no place to  be.<br/>
