watching television doesn&#39;t create people with distorted reality, any more<br/>

&lt;&lt;An uncomfortable sort of, &quot;Oh!  You&#39;re teaching him to be sensative!  Well<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s allright at this age, but he&#39;ll be too old for that sort of<br/>
<br/>
thing soon.  And you don&#39;t want to encourage that sort of un-masculine<br/>
<br/>
behavior too long....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It really sickens me, and was the last straw for me with that previous<br/>
<br/>
group.  I mean, why should boys be treated differently simply by virtue of<br/>
<br/>
the fact that they are boys?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be tempted to ask that person &gt;&gt;Gee, what age do you think insensitivity <br/>
training should start?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The book _The Courage to Raise Good Men_, by Sivertstein?, has a lot of good <br/>
material on the topic of our weird cultural ideas about cutting our sons off <br/>
from affection lest we spoil them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140646952">I was actually referring to the studies of people estimating their &quot;risks&quot; of a<br/>
variety of dangers.  There was a direct relationship between how much T.V. people<br/>
watched and how accurate they were in estimating their risks.  Of course not all<br/>
people, at all times but broadly over a number of people.<br/>
<br/>
Probably as pernicious and destructive to our collective well-being is the &quot;junk<br/>
food&quot; news and &quot;educational&quot; programs which rearrange our sense of what is<br/>
important in the rest of the world. Making the sensational seem really important<br/>
and the everyday seem less important.<br/>
<br/>
A good example of this is the Columbine tragedy which got enormous air play and<br/>
the reality that 9 children die daily from gunfire in the US is muted and hardly<br/>
mentioned at all.  If it served someone&#39;s money making agenda we would have the<br/>
&quot;daily dead children report&quot;. Rape is another example.  A shockingly common crime<br/>
which is glossed over mostly.  If it got the coverage that it really deserves<br/>
there would be the daily sexual assault index for every community.  It would be a<br/>
social issue like drunk driving has become finally after years of unacknowledged<br/>
(by most people) carnage.<br/>
