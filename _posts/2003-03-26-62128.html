<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109580436">I really truly believe that a sandwich ALWAYS tastes<br/>
better when someone else makes it and I will<br/>
shamelessly bribe whoever is around to make me one<br/>
whenever I crave it! (turkey, bacon and avacado with<br/>
lettuce, mayo and italian dressing or a bean burrito<br/>
with cheese, salsa and ranch)!  <br/>
Sandwiches made and served while watching anime,<br/>
Orlando, or my &#39;Ren and Stimpy&#39; video are doubly<br/>
delicious...so....knowing this, I LIKE to make what my<br/>
kids (and husband) want to eat (and new stuff to try)<br/>
and I encourage them to watch what they want to watch<br/>
(when they want to watch), while eating!   <br/>
It&#39;s FUN, nice to share and discuss what they are<br/>
watching (and nice to get a bite of scrambled eggs<br/>
dripping with butter or super-cheesey nachos), just a<br/>
simple, NICE thing.  My arm is healing, 3 weeks till I<br/>
can skate and &#39;be normal&#39; again...I think broken bones<br/>
might be contagious on this list--hehe.<br/>
<br/>
We are still, (5 months after sudden school withdrawl<br/>
and deschooling/freedom living/non-coercive, &#39;golden<br/>
rule/Rede&#39; parenting as completely as I can manage to<br/>
do since) at the stage where they (kids AND DAD) think<br/>
mom has gone the rest of the way &#39;off her nut&#39; and<br/>
they will wake up from the &#39;unschooling dream&#39; any<br/>
time now!  They NEED encouragement to make messes and<br/>
watch tv marathons and continue to enlarge their huge<br/>
hole to China in the backyard...<br/>
<br/>
I count to 10 before speaking a LOT every day and<br/>
REALLY LOOK at their faces while doing so...it reminds<br/>
me of the REAL goal...happy life for everyone--RIGHT<br/>
NOW and long term!  Is it true, is it nice, is it<br/>
necessary to say...over and over, it takes PRACTICE to<br/>
sift through the automated response that is on the tip<br/>
of my tongue to get to what I REALLY want to say, to<br/>
get to the FEELINGS.<br/>
<br/>
Reading the radical unschooling things on this list is<br/>
mostly like hearing an amplification of the whispers<br/>
of my secret heart, telling me how raising kids is<br/>
SUPPOSED to be joyful and wondrous, that I am not<br/>
naieve or sappy for admiting it is more of a learning<br/>
experience for me than for my kids, instead it&#39;s very<br/>
humbling, powerful and very good.  Reading others&#39; r/l<br/>
stories here makes me more brave. Thanks much for<br/>
that.<br/>
