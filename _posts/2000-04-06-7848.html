<div id="ygrps-yiv-585855498">Kathy and Erin,  when I was a teacher I had a discount card that I used at <br/>
mostly teacher supply stores.  This was just a little paper card and did not <br/>
have  a picture on it.  It did have my school address on it, though, and I <br/>
did have to show it when I made a purchase, as the store kept a record of <br/>
which school had made use of the card.<br/>
  Recently I got a free discontinued wallpaper book.  The sales lady told me <br/>
they were free to &quot;teachers&quot;.  I told  her that I &quot;teach&quot; my own kids, and  <br/>
she did not charge me- (although it would have only been a dollar).  Anyway, <br/>
there was a question about making a card--I would caution you about making <br/>
one that looked too&quot;professional&quot;, or if you made one, maybe you could make <br/>
it clear that it is a home educator&#39;s card, just so you could not be accused <br/>
of trying to be an &quot;imposter&quot;.  Possibly your support group could design a <br/>
card and check with some local stores to see if they would set up an <br/>
agreement to honor these discount cards. If you are not in a support group, <br/>
maybe you could talk to some store managers and see if they would be willing <br/>
to work with you personally--they might even have a form that you could fill <br/>
out and show each time you shopped there.  Well, good luck to you both!         <br/>
                                                                    Karen in <br/>
