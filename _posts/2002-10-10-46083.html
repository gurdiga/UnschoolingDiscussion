  My own personal opinion is yes, the older kids should have the right to <br/>
choose.  There&#39;s a world of difference between the play of a two year old and <br/>
a five year old.  When my oldest son was little, he had a friend named <br/>
Steven.  They had a lot in common and played well together.  When the mom <br/>
decided that if you wanted to play with Steven, you had to play with younger <br/>
brother Joey, too, the friendship suffered.  <br/>
  Some kids just don&#39;t mix and forcing the matter may not help.  Sounds like <br/>
your children have a great relationship otherwise.  <br/>
  I think it&#39;s ok for them to have their own friends.<br/>
