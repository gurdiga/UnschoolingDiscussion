&gt;I belong to a pretty big Christian homeschooling group that is local.  They <br/>
&gt;have some GREAT activities and such.  BUT most from what I can tell use <br/>
&gt;boxed curric.  I was wondering if anyone had ideas on how to maybe start an <br/>

group going a few months back but so far nothing has come of <br/>
that. It was in North VA. If she hasn&#39;t done anything by xmas, I&#39;ll do <br/>
it myself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We started a free state-wide online unschooling support group almost two <br/>
years ago. It spun off an inclusive group after being a &quot;subgroup&quot; for a few <br/>
months. (We were where the unschooling-curious would go to ask questions.) <br/>
Eventually the inclusive group changed to a private site and wanted to start <br/>
charging for membership. We opted to start our own then.<br/>
<br/>
We started with just the two of us---our membership has grown into more than <br/>
sixty families (I haven&#39;t checked the numbers lately). Most have <br/>
&quot;preschoolers&quot;, but they&#39;ll hopefully ease into unschooling since they have <br/>
support. <br/>
<br/>
We &quot;advertised&quot; on all the homeschooling groups in the state we could find. <br/>
We&#39;re on a few search engines. We put up a few flyers in the health food <br/>
stores in town. THEN we put on a conference---unschoolers and <br/>
unschooling-wannabees came out of the woodwork!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d like to form an accountability association specifically for unschoolers <br/>
(one of our state requirements); it&#39;s in the works, but not yet a reality.<br/>
<br/>
The boards aren&#39;t terribly active: unschoolers don&#39;t seem to need the same <br/>
outlets as curriculum users. We don&#39;t need advise on which curriculum is the <br/>
best! &lt;G&gt; We don&#39;t organize a whole bunch of &quot;field trips&quot;---we mostly go on <br/>
our own, or with a family or two. But we have had swim days, a waterpark, a <br/>
Halloween party, and a conference!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s state-wide (small state---though not as small as Rhode Island, I was <br/>
reminded! &lt;g&gt;), so getting together regularly as a group is not necessary or <br/>
possible. Things are handled online or by me and Melinda. In unschooling <br/>
style, there are no rules except that you MUST be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice to know that there are &quot;others like us&quot; in the area. I was truly <br/>
surprised at HOW MANY unschoolers there were in Columbia and in the state! <br/>
And I&#39;ve heard that they were JUST as surprised to have found us!<br/>
<br/>
Pick a free site, yahoo/msn/whatever and sign up as an unschooling group. <br/>
You&#39;ll need a message board and a membership list---not much more than we <br/>
have here, unless you feel the need for more. We have some links and some <br/>
quotes and a calendar. SOS is going to a private site shortly, but that&#39;s <br/>
because we&#39;re already paying for the conference site---it will just expand.<br/>
<br/>
Build it, and they will come---in droves!<br/>
