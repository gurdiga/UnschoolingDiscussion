   Men <br/>
generally aren&#39;t as into reparenting themselves as women might be, or into <br/>
being analytical about what they could have used as children.   So while I <br/>
was <br/>
reparenting myself, I tried to remember to pass some of that on to Keith.  I <br/>
would  just touch him gently sometimes as I passed, kiss him on the head and <br/>
say <br/>
&quot;thanks&quot; while he was paying bills, bring him a drink or a snack where he was <br/>
working in the garage or the yard or watching a movie by himself--same kinds <br/>
of things I would do for the kids, I started trying to do for him.  It was <br/>
nice.  I didn&#39;t TELL him &quot;I know there&#39;s a hurt little boy inside you.&quot;   I <br/>
just <br/>
started mothering him a little bit too, and what happened was the manly <br/>
outsides got softer and sweeter.<br/>

Just had to pop out of lurkdom to thank you, Sandra, for this!  What a novel <br/>
idea (for me).  I&#39;ll bet this will be much more effective (and help our <br/>
relationship AND model love and kindness) than what I currently do   *smile*  <br/>

Warmly,<br/>
