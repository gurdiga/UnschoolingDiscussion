<div id="ygrps-yiv-1197784337">During that initial &quot;de-tox&quot; period from public school, you might borrow a<br/>
lot of movies from the library.  Watch them with your children.  Cook<br/>
interesting meals together.  Keep current on community happenings.  Attend<br/>
them with your family.  You know, the festivals, special exhibits at<br/>
museums, fairs, and other events.  Go camping together.  Walk along the<br/>
beach on a starry night.  Volunteer with your children at the local public<br/>
library.  Play basketball together at a community park.  Plant a garden.<br/>
Make your living room into a mini Legoland.  Take a hike through a forest.<br/>
<br/>
The list is endless really.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see there are tons of things to do before you buckle down and<br/>
&quot;start learning&quot; again.<br/>
<br/>
At the Andersen household, we&#39;ve gotten so hooked on &quot;play,&quot; that we&#39;ve all<br/>
but thrown &quot;learning&quot; out the window.<br/>

&quot;Possessions&quot;--Is the drive to own things a natural human instinct, or the<br/>
result of cultural conditioning?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello, everyone!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; New to homeschooling, my family and I are slowly adjusting.  My husband<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I have two daughters, ages 8 & 10.  We made the decision to<br/>
&gt; &gt; homeschool because of concerns about social issues in the schools, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; also because we just didn&#39;t feel the girls were getting what they need.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They are both very bright, and often complained about the boredom they<br/>
&gt; &gt; experienced in the classroom. Since bringing them home, we have found<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they have really lost their natural curiosity.  It seems public<br/>
&gt; &gt; school has drummed it right out of them! </span></blockquote></div>
