Hi,<br/>
I am not doing unit studies, but, the other day my oldest said he didn&#39;t want <br/>
to do work books, so I said ok, as long as at least once a week he did some <br/>
type of math that we could print, to put in his portfolio, did practice on <br/>
his cursive writing, however, and did some type of reasearch per month, I <br/>
didn&#39;t care.  He is writing a Halloween story, which he has done for 4 years, <br/>
starting with one he dictated, then printed, then typed on puter .  we will <br/>
put these all together either this year or next year in a book, which will be <br/>
a unit study for Dec.  and give to dad for Christmas.  He can also write or <br/>
type a letter, story or , this month, write a comparison between Hurricane <br/>
Floyd and Irene.  Since I have given them these choices, both of the boys are <br/>
a lot happier, with just the guide line, they fill in the details.  SEE! it <br/>
is beginning to dawn on me!  LOL,<br/>

    You would give them back soon. I love them dearly but they are so <br/>
difficult at times. We went to a museum last week, so glad dad went. 8yro <br/>
toured most of the place with his arms crossed 20 ft. away from us. He went <br/>
down the escaltor when dh went up, up when down. This kid has guts let me <br/>
tell you. I thank God regularly that dh is as patient as I am. Usually they <br/>
will listen to him before me but this one could have tried Jobs patience. The <br/>
11yro is another story. I won&#39;t go there now.<br/>

Hi, sorry I&#39;m so late with this but one unit study I&#39;ve found useful in my<br/>
ongoing efforts to become more child interest lead is the Prairie Primer.<br/>
It is a literature based unit study approach based from the Little House On<br/>
The Prairie series.  It covers just about everything.  I supplement with<br/>
math and grammar but other than that there are plenty of activities to<br/>
choose from.  For instance, you read a chapter or two in one of the books<br/>
and there are comprehension questions and about 12-15 activities you can<br/>
pursue.  I can let the kids pick out what they want to do and ignore the<br/>
rest.  It has been great for us as a back up source for things to do when<br/>
we get to a point of not knowing what to do next.  We travel lots of bunny<br/>
trails, as I call them, ending up in several mini unit studies that last<br/>
anywhere from 10 minutes to 10 days or more.  This primer is for 3-6th<br/>
grade age levels and is great for both boys and girls.<br/>
<br/>
Margie Gray, the author of Prairie Primer, also has another unit study<br/>
based on the Anne of Green Gables series called Where the Brook Meets the<br/>
River.  This study is more for the 7th - 12th grade crowd.<br/>
<br/>
