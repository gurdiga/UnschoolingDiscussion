 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
  I quit my job as a preschool associate teacher last June.  I wanted to be <br/>
home with my son, and the more I researched homeschooling, and unschooling in <br/>
particular, the more difficult it was to go to work each day.<br/>
  I worked for Head Start for 15 years.  The official name is Full Year Head <br/>
Start.  It was designed to give low income and handicapped children a boost, <br/>
so they would be able to compete (for lack of a better word) favorably with <br/>
the other kindergardeners.  It served the children who were 4 or 5 years old, <br/>
and attending K the next year.  A few years ago we began taking three year <br/>
olds.  Then, the year before I quit, they started a new program called Early <br/>
Head Start.  The clients?  PREGNANT WOMEN!  So these kids would be in the <br/>
program before they were even born right up to kindergarden age.  Give me a <br/>
break.  I think these moms will be so dependent on outside &quot;expertise&quot; <br/>
they&#39;ll be reluctant to trust their own judgment regarding their kids.<br/>
