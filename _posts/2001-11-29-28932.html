<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555678822">Bridget, <br/>
thanks for your thoughts--no it&#39;s not his first heart attack (his 2nd) but <br/>
the first one was a &quot;silent one&quot;--he &quot;didn&#39;t feel good&quot; -but still went to <br/>
work--so we made him go to the doc. Turns out he had mild heart attack, but <br/>
this second one was life threatening--and it turns out that the paramedic&#39;s <br/>
choice of hospitals saved his life--they have cardiac facilities that the <br/>
other local hospital doesn&#39;t have. I don&#39;t think that I have ever been so <br/>
scared in my life than when we heard &quot;code blue in the Cath Lab&quot;, knowing who <br/>
was in the Cath Lab. My dad has lived with my family and been our cheif cook <br/>
and bottle washer for the last 2 years and he&#39;s only 66, so I am not ready to <br/>
give him up yet.(not because he&#39;s our cheif cook and bottle washer, but cuz <br/>
he&#39;s too damn young to die!) My oldest daughter says he&#39;s her best friend and <br/>
pretty much everybody else who knows him feels the same, so we&#39;ve got a lot <br/>
of support,but nothing will take away that fear that we might lose him.  <br/>
Please forgive my rambling....fear and love can do stuff to you!<br/>
Nancy  (the sun came out so that helps!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710250554">Nancy, is he still in the hospital? Any surgery planned to correct problems that can be corrected? I can relate... just spent my summer at WFUBMC with my mom... Aortic Root Valve Replacement surgery.<br/>
These docs can do some pretty amazing stuff!! Keep the faith... will be thinking of you.<br/>

<br/>
Dyslexia means &quot;difficulty reading&quot;.  There is no proven evidence of an<br/>
underlying neurological disorder.  Even if there was, its not like you are<br/>
going to take a pill and fix it.  What helps child A will not help child B.<br/>
Once you &quot;identify problems like dyslexia&quot;, now what?  So what?  The kid<br/>
already knew they had difficulty reading.<br/>
<br/>
The whole learning disability thing came about because some teachers knew<br/>
that kids who couldn&#39;t read were still smart and wanted them to have fewer<br/>
disadvantages in the classroom, so the kids got to have untimed tests, etc..<br/>
It is a school phenomenon, not necessarily a medical one.<br/>

<br/>
No one has told me &quot;it&#39;s okay&quot;.  What they did was introduce me to an idea<br/>
that struck me to the core, that resonated so deeply within me I knew it was<br/>
Truth.  I have read many books on the topic because it is near and dear to<br/>
my heart.  I point those books out to others because the authors express<br/>
themselves so much better than I do.<br/>
<br/>
I am not a follower.  I am not a groupie.  I am not of the herd mentality.<br/>
I am a seeker of Truth and trust my soul to recognize it when it is<br/>
encountered.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I became an unschooler long before anyone had ever used the word.  After <br/>
reading Summerhill at the age of 14, the schools never really worked for me <br/>
again.  (Never did really.  I just knew why.)  I convinced my mother to <br/>
help me &quot;drop out&quot; at age 16, because I wanted to learn what interested me <br/>
in the way I wanted to learn it.  I needed her help because it was not easy <br/>
to drop out in California back then.  You had to go to continuation school <br/>
until you were 18.  My mother went round and round the bureaucrats until <br/>
finally the principal said he could let me go on a mental excuse.  So now <br/>
you know it.  I&#39;m mental.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Like Julie, the books I read about unschooling resonated with what I <br/>
already knew to be true.<br/>
