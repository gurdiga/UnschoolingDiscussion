&gt;Are there people on this list that DON&#39;T own t.v.&#39;s?  Just wondering.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. We don&#39;t. When dh and I met, I owned 3 TVs, and none of them <br/>
worked. He brought in a small B&W, because he couldn&#39;t imagine life <br/>
without TV. A year and a half later, we sold that one and haven&#39;t had <br/>
one since. That was several years before we had kids, though.<br/>
<br/>
I figure at some point we&#39;ll probably get one, but no one seems that <br/>
interested right now. We&#39;ll need it for the game systems, right? I just <br/>
don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t like noise, the pace of most programs seems <br/>
boggling to me, but most of all, I can&#39;t have it on in the background. <br/>
If it&#39;s ON I&#39;m WATCHING it, and I don&#39;t like that. Maybe we could use <br/>
the basement idea.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re at friends&#39; houses and all the kids watch TV, my two just <br/>
don&#39;t gravitate toward it. The other kids will all be yelling at them to <br/>
&quot;come watch the movie!&quot; but they&#39;re just not interested. In motel rooms <br/>
they love to play with the remote, but not really watch. I&#39;ll usually <br/>
turn on the weather channel at some point, and that gets them started <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I *most* disagree with, though, is the families who have TV, <br/>
but don&#39;t think the kids should watch it. Then they set the kids&#39; <br/>
bedtimes so they can watch their own shows. Do as I say, not as I do.<br/>

have many TVs.  And watch them off and on.  But when we go to a hotel or when <br/>
people come over my boys want to play.  They don&#39;t want to watch TV.  Maybe <br/>
because they can do that anytime.  So my boys are kind of the same as yours <br/>
but we do watch TV.  And when kids come over that are TV restricted at home <br/>
all they want to do is watch TV or play the computer.  They aren&#39;t able to <br/>
watch TV or play whatever computer game they like at home.  So they are glued <br/>
to them at our house.  My boys are always complaining about that.  The kids <br/>
come over to play and they won&#39;t play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544069295">We own a TV, but it is only for movies. We live in the middle of <br/>
nowhere, and can only get the NBC channel IF the TV is upstairs. We <br/>
brought it up last year for the Olympics...I&#39;m from SLC and simply <br/>
HAD to watch. That was when I watched my first and only episode <br/>
of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; and that hilarious ad lib/ <br/>
impromptu program. Otherwise the TV lives in the basement where ZERO <br/>
local stations come through.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway. In discussing how unschooling is going to manifest itself in <br/>
our home, the TV has come up often. I think the mind flourishes best <br/>
when it is in contact with real stuff: building a treehouse, <br/>
wrassling with your sister on the floor, reading Tom Swift, etc. so <br/>
we&#39;ve thought about putting a limit on the amount of time in front of <br/>
the TV. Hubby and I are already self-limited. It isn&#39;t ever on just <br/>
because. But in thinking it through, the only way to really do it <br/>
would be to put the TV away. Maybe not get rid of it entirely, but <br/>
stick in an out of the way place and make a movie night a very <br/>
special event. <br/>
<br/>
Dunno. Just thinking out loud. Again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942503587">I think personalities come in to play in whether or not kids are drawn to<br/>
the tv as much as whether it is restricted or not.  Some kids, like my<br/>
oldest, are just not drawn to the tv.  My youngest likes it a little more,<br/>
but both would leave it in a heart beat to play with their friends or to<br/>
play a game with me or listen to a book.  I used to restrict it when they<br/>
were little, but I don&#39;t anymore.  They are now 8 and 6.  I have a friend<br/>
who claims her kids would do nothing but watch tv all the time if she let<br/>
them.  I know you might think that is because she does restrict it, but I<br/>
restricted my kids tv viewing for many years and they still don&#39;t like it<br/>
that much.  So it seems to me that isn&#39;t just restriction vs. no restriction<br/>
that makes a kid want to watch more, but personalities of the kids come into<br/>
play there too.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting, I&#39;ve found the opposite. Most of our friends don&#39;t have <br/>
TVs, but a few do. When we&#39;ve had large groups of people over, the <br/>
only kids who discovered our TV downstairs and kept repeatedly asking <br/>
me to turn it on were ones who had TVs in their house. One 10 y.o. <br/>
boy actually became very upset with me when I explained that our TV <br/>
isn&#39;t hooked up to an antenna or cable, so it doesn&#39;t actually get <br/>
any TV shows. He was mad about that. I&#39;ve just got it hooked up to a <br/>
VCR so I can watch stuff while I&#39;m cycling. It was weird to see these <br/>
kids keep coming back to the TV like moths to a flame. But the rest <br/>
of the kids were upstairs playing.<br/>
<br/>
My son was at a friend&#39;s house last week, one of our few friends who <br/>
does have a TV out in the living room, and my son has never asked to <br/>
turn it on when we&#39;ve been there. I think it depends a lot on the <br/>
personalities of the kids involved, most likely.<br/>
<br/>
Some random thoughts, unconnected to your particular post: I guess I <br/>
see the TV/no TV thing as just a matter of choice. I know some folks <br/>
think kids who don&#39;t have TV are deprived, but really they just have <br/>
different things in their lives during that time when they&#39;d be <br/>
watching the TV. It doesn&#39;t have to be a value judgement - better or <br/>
worse - it&#39;s just different. So, some families choose to watch TV, <br/>
and some choose to do different things. We spent Saturday morning <br/>
going to a live vaudeville show, on a bike ride, and to a park. <br/>
Someone else might spend it watching Saturday morning cartoons. It&#39;s <br/>
just a different choice of activities for that time. We spend our <br/>
evening hours playing games with the kids, reading books, going <br/>
swimming, etc. Again, we&#39;ve just chosen a different set of activities.<br/>
<br/>
And if kids who don&#39;t watch TV want to watch it when they go to a <br/>
house where it&#39;s on, well that&#39;s natural. When my kids go to their <br/>
friend&#39;s house where the mom always does great crafts stuff, that&#39;s <br/>
all they want to do there. I&#39;m more or less craft-impaired. :-) Does <br/>
that mean my kids are craft-deprived and will be in need of a <br/>
psychiatrist to fix their craft-deprivation later in life? :-) And my <br/>
experience hasn&#39;t been that my kids crave TV at friend&#39;s houses in <br/>
any case.<br/>

worse - it&#39;s just different. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the value of the thought processes of the parents are really lame, then <br/>
it&#39;s worse, not just different (in MY opinion and experience).<br/>
<br/>
Some parents have invalid reasons for their TV views.  Nonsensical reasons.  <br/>
Illogical reasons.<br/>
<br/>
And passing illogical or dishonest reasoning on to kids doesn&#39;t promote <br/>
natural learning.  They figure out early that the parents are not being calm <br/>
and accepting, but that they&#39;re kind of superstitious and paranoid.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So, some families choose to watch TV, <br/>
and some choose to do different things. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have TVs.  But we are not a family that chooses to watch TV, as opposed to <br/>
a family that chooses to do different things.  We are a family that chooses <br/>
to offer a full range of options and see our children do all kinds of things <br/>
wholly by their own choice.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s watching Mr. Rogers.  She&#39;s 11.  I didn&#39;t tell her to.  She came in <br/>
here to show me the dress Lady Aberline&#39;s wearing.  Holly really liked it.  <br/>
Keith came home from work sick.  He was watching Fight Club, from the bed, <br/>
when I was in there last.  He&#39;s probably asleep now.  Last night Marty, Keith <br/>
and I worked on tent repairs for a couple of mid-sized medieval-style tents <br/>
we have.  Tonight we have one more grommet repair (which will involve leather <br/>
and glue).  Holly and I are going shopping today to a fabric store and to <br/>
look for some used shoes we can paint purple for an outfit she needs for <br/>
Saturday.   The boys are both sick too, poor guys.  Sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
Our family&#39;s quite busy.  But I never have once thought they were only doing <br/>
something because TV wasn&#39;t an option.  Every time they&#39;re out playing orc <br/>
ball or playing boffers in the back field or off gaming, it&#39;s because they <br/>
would rather do that than watch TV.  I think that&#39;s cooler than doing it <br/>
without options.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We spent Saturday morning <br/>
going to a live vaudeville show, on a bike ride, and to a park. <br/>
Someone else might spend it watching Saturday morning cartoons. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have never had any interest in the Saturday morning cartoons (if <br/>
there even are any anymore).  Saturday isn&#39;t a &quot;special day&quot; for them.  <br/>
<br/>
If there were a live vaudeville show here they would never have let TV keep <br/>
them from going (though on Saturday morning nobody here ever watches any).  <br/>
But I worry more about a family without any bike, park, vaudeville show who <br/>
just lies and says the TV doesn&#39;t work, or says yes it works, but you can&#39;t <br/>
watch it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s <br/>
just a different choice of activities for that time. We spend our <br/>
evening hours playing games with the kids, reading books, going <br/>
swimming, etc. Again, we&#39;ve just chosen a different set of activities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is still not a true representation of having television or videos <br/>
available.  It&#39;s not a choice to do that instead of reading, swimming or <br/>
playing games.<br/>

That&#39;s horribly tacky.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we do invite someone or people over to watch a movie, but they know <br/>
and we know and we totally clean up enough good places to sit and make <br/>
popcorn!  But more often if we have company it&#39;s to play games and so we <br/>
sometimes eat fast so we can play longer.   <br/>

For such flighty, disorganized people we can be pretty focussed!<br/>

I have had the same thing happen here. While we do have three televisions<br/>

When we have had groups of people over for Thanksgiving or New Years,<br/>

people, (my Dad) actually went home. I would hate for something to have<br/>
that much of a hold on me. My children can watch TV or tapes at their<br/>
whim, and when they go to visit other people, they are there to spend<br/>
that time with those people. DD5 often comes home from Grandma&#39;s<br/>
disappointed, because the first thing my Mom does is turn on cartoons for<br/>
her. DD would much rather spend the time doing something *with* Grandma.<br/>
She does think it is pretty cool that cartoons are on all night there<br/>
though.<br/>

their kids. We all pick and choose, based on our own interests, <br/>
abilities, etc. For instance, our children are offered the ability to <br/>
go flying in our airplane whenever they choose. Should I then say <br/>
that any other parents who choose not to purchase an airplane and <br/>
learn how to fly it are limiting their children&#39;s options because <br/>
it&#39;s not available to their children?  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sincerely doubt that any kids on this list have &quot;no options&quot;. <br/>
Though some might have different options. This morning, my kids said <br/>
they wanted to go flying, and I could take them up. If they said they <br/>
wanted to watch Powderpuff girls, that would&#39;ve been impossible as we <br/>
don&#39;t choose to use our money on cable TV. In another family, if the <br/>
kids had said in the morning that they wanted to go flying, that <br/>
would&#39;ve been impossible. However, the Powderpuff girls would&#39;ve been <br/>
an option for that family because they chose to use their money for <br/>
cable TV and not for airplane payments.<br/>
<br/>
In this scenario, I see two families who have chosen to use their <br/>
money on two different options and therefore their children have <br/>
different options available to them. It seems to me that in this <br/>
scenario, you see one family who is deprived because they don&#39;t have <br/>
a TV, and one family who is not deprived because they do. <br/>

programming, but our kids do watch movies on it (it has a VCR <br/>
attached).<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>swimming or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; playing games.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, but nobody has every choice. Some people live in areas where <br/>
they have snow, and therefore sledding, cross-country skiing, and <br/>
snowshoeing are available. Some people live on a beach, and therefore <br/>
swimming and surfing are available. Some people choose to own <br/>
bicycles, some people choose not to put their money into bicycles. <br/>
Some people choose to spend money on a membership to a club with a <br/>
pool, or in a house with a pool so that swimming is always an option. <br/>
Some people own airplanes so that flying is always an option. Some <br/>
people choose to have TVs available as an option, or playstations, or <br/>
computers. These are all options and not a single one of us has all <br/>
of these available. <br/>
<br/>
For some reason, TV is seen by many as a &quot;better&quot; option, or a <br/>
necessary one, or one that kids are &quot;deprived&quot; if they don&#39;t have <br/>
access to. I think that&#39;s about as strange as if I suddenly started <br/>
insisting that everyone who doesn&#39;t own an airplane is depriving <br/>
their kids by not giving them the ability to go flying whenever they <br/>
want to. My kids do happen to have that option. They also have a TV <br/>
that does get a couple of channels fuzzily via rabbit-ear antennas <br/>
and they occasionally ask to watch it, and they do watch it on those <br/>
occasions. But they&#39;re as deprived by their lack of cable TV as other <br/>
kids are by their lack of ability to take to the air.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unlimited tv does not mean that you sit your young kids down in front of NYPD blue<br/>
or ER and tell them to enjoy. My kids are 6 and almost 3 and they would not enjoy<br/>
watching something with a lot of violence or porn. Since reading here, I have become<br/>
more comfortable with trusting my children to decide if something is appropriate. <br/>
My oldest loves the crocodile hunter. When the movie came out, my immediate reaction was<br/>
that it was not something that I wanted Jason to see (things blowing up etc). We watched<br/>
a clips show on tv and Jason told me that he did not want to see the movie because<br/>
it looked too scary. He did the same thing with Spider Man, saw some ads and decided that<br/>
he did not want to see it.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes I am &quot;limiting&quot; tv because I am not taping (we have tivo) ER or NYPD Blue for the<br/>
boys (and we choose only to watch it when they are in bed). But I am not limiting it because<br/>
if they showed a real interest in wanting to see it for whatever reason, I would let them <br/>
watch it (with me next to them). It has actually been very freeing for me and I am seeing<br/>
my kids as people who have a good sense of what they are ready for rather then fragile<br/>
things that need to be protected (I am not sure that made sense). I used to be the type<br/>
that would try to flip the channel if an ad for a violent movie came on (fox football<br/>
used to drive me nuts!). But I realized that it had the potential of creating more<br/>
interest, so I stopped. And neither of my kids have been traumatized so far!<br/>
<br/>
I think that &quot;no limits&quot; means that we as parents do not decide what is &quot;good&quot; for them...<br/>
for example, only letting them watch &quot;educational&quot; tv. It is trusting that kids can make<br/>
good choices for themselves, even if those choices are not the ones that we would make.<br/>

There are people who do both.  There&#39;ve been a couple of people admit lying <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of anyone saying &quot;If I let my kids ski, they would just ski <br/>
all day,&quot; or &quot;When he&#39;s skiing he&#39;s like a zombie&quot; or &quot;Skiing rots his brain&quot; <br/>
or &quot;I&#39;ve read a book that says skiing will affect his mental development, so <br/>
we just don&#39;t have skis.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
You can be an unschooler without caring what other people do about TV.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What I am trying to figure out is;  if you own a television and restrict <br/>
your children&#39;s viewing to shows that you deem appropriate, does that imply <br/>
that you are depriving them of a learning opportunity and you are not <br/>
unschooling?  What about porn?  Or violence?  Or if you know your child is <br/>
super-sensitive to death or suffering?  Is there an age when you give kids <br/>
unlimited choices, or start from infancy?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends what your priorities are.<br/>
Depends how old your children are.<br/>
<br/>
A child who is super-sensitive to death or suffering wouldn&#39;t choose to watch <br/>
the news, right?<br/>
I myself choose not to watch the news.  It&#39;s a festival of death and <br/>
suffering.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; What about porn?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any porn channels.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or violence? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t much like violence, but in the context of a story sometimes there&#39;s <br/>
violence.  <br/>
<br/>
Do you  mean Tom & Jerry or Roadrunner/Coyote violence?  Fight Club violence? <br/>
 War coverage violence?<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t subscribe to Newsweek anymore, partly because I was tired of photos <br/>
of dead people.  <br/>
<br/>
I hate to pass through where anyone&#39;s watching WWF (WWE, any kind of <br/>
theatrical soap-opera wrestling) but my husband watches it a couple of times <br/>
a month.  Sometimes the boys watch it with him.  I think it&#39;s awful.  They <br/>
think it&#39;s fun and funny.  It hasn&#39;t made them get tattoos or hit anyone with <br/>
a chair.<br/>
<br/>
Before we were unschoolers we gave our kids choices about food.  Not <br/>
&quot;unlimited choices,&quot; because we didn&#39;t have all the food in the world.  But <br/>
free choices, yes.  We didn&#39;t make them eat food they didn&#39;t want to eat.  We <br/>
let them try foods if they wanted to try them.  We let them have more if they <br/>
wanted more.<br/>
<br/>
We let them choose which clothes to wear, of the clothes they had.  Marty <br/>
wore a tiger suit (no mask or hood, just the body part) for most of a year.<br/>
<br/>
We let them choose what toys to play with, of the toys they had.<br/>
<br/>
We let them choose what videos to watch, of the videos we had.  <br/>
We let them choose to watch TV shows.  They never were interested in things <br/>
they weren&#39;t interested in.   When they were little they didn&#39;t like things <br/>
without kids or animals.  <br/>
<br/>
As they got older and could understand stories they chose from a broader <br/>
range.  When they could request foods from the store, that increase their <br/>
food choices.  When they could save allowance and buy what they wanted to, <br/>
that increased their toy options.<br/>
<br/>
There was never a time when we made all their choices for them, or limited <br/>
their choices based on what WE thought was good for them against their will.  <br/>
When there&#39;s been an edgy matter we&#39;ve told them what we thought, and they&#39;ve <br/>
told us why they wanted to try or do the thing, and we&#39;d convince them to <br/>
wait a bit, or they&#39;d convince us they wanted to try it.  Lots of <br/>
communication.<br/>
<br/>
I think the stereotype or the extreme examples in these case are presupposing <br/>
that a child given free reign will watch porn, smoke cigars and stay up 48 <br/>
hours without sleeping.  The extreme examples are given in a reactionary and <br/>
challenging way, kind of as an insult to those who &quot;claim&quot; to give their <br/>
children freedoms.   It does get tiring, but it&#39;s worth explaining again, <br/>
because each time it comes around, some more families loosen up arbitrary <br/>
rules that weren&#39;t serving any useful purposes but to give them something to <br/>
stress and argue about.<br/>

<br/>
What if you really wanted a sewing machine and your husband bought one for<br/>

<br/>
Quite frankly when my 11 yo daughter is flipping through channels she<br/>
doesn&#39;t pause on shows that aren&#39;t cartoons or have animals in them or have<br/>
kids no more than a couple years older than her.<br/>
<br/>
Why would a chld choose to watch porn? (If it were even easily available to<br/>
them.) What in flipping through channels would make a child stop at porn and<br/>
say &quot;Hmm, that looks interesting&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or violence?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, do they want to watch violence? And if they did, what would it mean?<br/>
Do you think that by treating them lovingly that they would watch violent<br/>
shows and come to the conclusion that it&#39;s better to beat people up?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter loves video games like Kirby and Mario where the cute main<br/>
character eats and beats up other &quot;cute&quot; characters before they beat him up.<br/>
She accepts it as the way things are in the game. But those &quot;values&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
translate into real life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or if you know your child is super-sensitive<br/>
&gt; to death or suffering?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you hated horror movies, would your husband rent one and put it on for<br/>
you two to watch together?<br/>
<br/>
Letting them choose doesn&#39;t translate into putting things on they don&#39;t want<br/>
to watch. It means allowing them to trust their own fears and likes and<br/>
dislikes to decide whether they want to watch something or not. It means<br/>
honoring their feelings and not putting on movies you know they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
like. It means if they find something disturbing in a movie that seemed okay<br/>
that the movie can be shut off or they can go do something else.<br/>
<br/>
(If you don&#39;t know about Screen It! (http://www.screening.com) it would help<br/>
you figure out what scenes might bother your children. Then you can warn<br/>
them if it&#39;s something they really want to see. Or pass it by if it doesn&#39;t<br/>
sound interesting. They detail scenes in loads of different catagories that<br/>
might bother children (or parents), like sex and swear words and jump scenes<br/>
and scary music and violence and so on.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there an age when you give kids unlimited choices,<br/>
&gt; or start from infancy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It depends what you mean by unlimited. You don&#39;t need to bring everything in<br/>
the world home to them. You judge by your family&#39;s interests rather than by<br/>
what&#39;s good for them or bad for them.<br/>

get up and turn the channel.  My boys can handle a certain amount of <br/>
violence.  We don&#39;t have any porn on our cable but seeing how they deal with <br/>
the sex scenes in some movies I don&#39;t&#39; believe that would appeal to them at <br/>
the ages they are now (5 and 8).  They are usually bored with the sex stuff <br/>
right now.  If I think a movie is something that they won&#39;t like I tell them <br/>
ahead of time (it&#39;s kind of scary) if they want to watch we do and they have <br/>
the freedom to turn it off if they don&#39;t like it.  And they have before.  If <br/>
they happened to see something pornographic I would talk with them about it <br/>
and why I don&#39;t feel it is a &quot;good thing&quot; to watch.  We discuss a lot of what <br/>
we see on TV even the commercials.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the lack of TV as lack of a learning opportunity as much as a <br/>
lack of choice.  A lack of trust on my part. But that is just my opinion and <br/>
nonrestrictive TV for us has worked out just fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810236743">Kelle,<br/>
<br/>
I too am new to officially choosing unschooling as our named &quot;method&quot; and I also feel like there is a lot of freedom here when it comes to tv.  I tend to disagree for my children.  <br/>
<br/>
I own 2 television, one in my bedroom one in the living room.  Before my current partner came into my life we did not have the tvs on at all during the week (sunday at bedtime it went off and did not come back on until friday evening)  He changed that a bit in so much as he lived alone for many years and his habit was to ALWAYS have the tv on I guess even if just for the background noise.  Well with 3 children around, you don&#39;t need background noise!  So after 5 months living in &quot;our&quot; life he see the value of no tv during the week or at minimal during the day.  He has noticed that if the tv is on, nothing gets done!  The older children neglect helping with the baby, they don&#39;t do their chores unless constantly reminded and nagged.  And for me unschooling is about stopping the nagging...so why would I set that same situation up by allowing the tv to be on non-stop?  <br/>
<br/>
What is currently happening around out house is the tv is not supposed to be one during the day but after dinner we might sit and watch Jeopardy together, then maybe we watch another hour or two depending on what is on.  But honestly there is so much junk on tv.  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately or unfortunately, we only get our 4 or 5 local channels.  And every time I turn around there is some comment being made about sex-it doesn&#39;t matter what time of day it is either!  For my personal likes there is just too much of this on.  I guess it might be better if I had cable or satalite that I could program to show only the channels that might help educate or entertain my children in appropriate childlike ways but alas, that is not an option.  <br/>
<br/>
I did just join netflix so we will be getting some really cool documentary stuff in the mail soon.  That will be something the kids will enjoy and they can feel like they aren&#39;t being deprived.  They are also enjoying my new computer with some of the cool games on it.  Not sure how I feel about that one yet.  I guess anything in moderation is ok but I really hate the content on tv most times.<br/>
<br/>
I also think it is just best if we do set some limits for our chilren.  Many times we have had this discussion on the unassisted birth board I belong to in so much as many of us there practice AP.  But for me and my house, I prefer some structure as far as me having a bit more knowledge about life and choices and consequences than my 8 & 11 year old.  To me it equates to making sure my 9 month old doesn&#39;t stick anything into his mouth that might harm him or anything into a socket in the wall.  I am sure as my children age, I will offer more and more freedom as I have already done that in many areas of their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...working it all out as we adjust to a new way of doing things. <br/>

  Kelle,<br/>
<br/>
  I too am new to officially choosing unschooling as our named &quot;method&quot; and I also feel like there is a lot of freedom here when it comes to tv.  I tend to disagree for my children.  <br/>
<br/>
  I own 2 television, one in my bedroom one in the living room.  Before my current partner came into my life we did not have the tvs on at all during the week (sunday at bedtime it went off and did not come back on until friday evening)  He changed that a bit in so much as he lived alone for many years and his habit was to ALWAYS have the tv on I guess even if just for the background noise.  Well with 3 children around, you don&#39;t need background noise!  So after 5 months living in &quot;our&quot; life he see the value of no tv during the week or at minimal during the day.  He has noticed that if the tv is on, nothing gets done!  The older children neglect helping with the baby, they don&#39;t do their chores unless constantly reminded and nagged.  And for me unschooling is about stopping the nagging...so why would I set that same situation up by allowing the tv to be on non-stop?  <br/>
<br/>
  What is currently happening around out house is the tv is not supposed to be one during the day but after dinner we might sit and watch Jeopardy together, then maybe we watch another hour or two depending on what is on.  But honestly there is so much junk on tv.  <br/>
<br/>
  Fortunately or unfortunately, we only get our 4 or 5 local channels.  And every time I turn around there is some comment being made about sex-it doesn&#39;t matter what time of day it is either!  For my personal likes there is just too much of this on.  I guess it might be better if I had cable or satalite that I could program to show only the channels that might help educate or entertain my children in appropriate childlike ways but alas, that is not an option.  <br/>
<br/>
  I did just join netflix so we will be getting some really cool documentary stuff in the mail soon.  That will be something the kids will enjoy and they can feel like they aren&#39;t being deprived.  They are also enjoying my new computer with some of the cool games on it.  Not sure how I feel about that one yet.  I guess anything in moderation is ok but I really hate the content on tv most times.<br/>
<br/>
  I also think it is just best if we do set some limits for our chilren.  Many times we have had this discussion on the unassisted birth board I belong to in so much as many of us there practice AP.  But for me and my house, I prefer some structure as far as me having a bit more knowledge about life and choices and consequences than my 8 & 11 year old.  To me it equates to making sure my 9 month old doesn&#39;t stick anything into his mouth that might harm him or anything into a socket in the wall.  I am sure as my children age, I will offer more and more freedom as I have already done that in many areas of their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway...working it all out as we adjust to a new way of doing things. <br/>
<br/>
  Debra<br/>
<br/>
  &gt; New here, and I have to jump in about this TV thread.  What I am trying to figure out is;  if you own a television and restrict your children&#39;s viewing to shows that you deem appropriate, does that imply that you are depriving them of a learning opportunity and you are not unschooling?   What about porn?  Or violence?  Or if you know your child is super-sensitive to death or suffering?  Is there an age when you give kids <br/>
  &gt; unlimited choices, or start from infancy?<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
  &gt; Trying to figure out if I fit in as an unschooler.<br/>

home.  I don&#39;t bring in any physical money.  But I am lucky in that my dh <br/>
sees things the way I do.  He also believes that it is OUR house.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
belong to who can pay the bills but it belongs to the people that live <br/>

the children want? What do the children find interesting and important?<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re making the decisions about what is and isn&#39;t good for them and that<br/>
our values must be their values then are we trusting that they can learn<br/>
what they need from life? Or are we trusting that they can learn the things<br/>
that we don&#39;t care about and we need to make them do the things that are<br/>
most important to us until they choose to follow our example?<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s helpful to step back and see what principles look like when<br/>
applied to other parts of our lives. It&#39;s helpful to see what it looks like<br/>
from the children&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband made the decision that the only reading you could do<br/>
was an hour a night from a book he decided was good for the whole family?<br/>
How would that feel to you?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
And again, what do your kids want? What do they find value in?<br/>
<br/>
Attachment parenting is about helping our kids get what they want not in<br/>
setting up things so life is most comfortable and convenient for the<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to make decisons by making decision. That doesn&#39;t mean making the<br/>
decisions we would, but weighing the pros and cons and deciding. They don&#39;t<br/>
necessarily have the experience we do to know all the pros and cons, but as<br/>
long as they aren&#39;t in any immediate danger, then they have the opportunity<br/>
to build up confidence in their decision making powers. They may try out<br/>
some decisions that we wouldn&#39;t make. They may even see that there are some<br/>
not so great consequences but the consequences may be worth it for a while.<br/>
(Say like staying up really late knowing that tomorrow they&#39;ll feel wiped<br/>
out.) But eventually the bad parts out weigh the good parts and they choose<br/>
more sensibly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; To me it equates to making sure my 9 month old doesn&#39;t stick anything into his<br/>
&gt; mouth that might harm him or anything into a socket in the wall.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know for certain that sticking something in a socket could be really<br/>
bad. Do you also know for certain that a child who watches unlimited TV will<br/>
be harmed?<br/>
<br/>
Lots of kids here aren&#39;t being harmed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying you need to remove the restrictions. But if your restrictions<br/>
are based on things that aren&#39;t true, then they should be rethought.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am sure as <br/>
&gt; my children age, I will offer more and more freedom as I have already done<br/>
&gt; that in many areas of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many people say that. Many find that since they have made their children&#39;s<br/>
decisions for them that when given the opportunity the children will<br/>
deliberately choose the things they weren&#39;t allowed before just because they<br/>
can. And as the children get older, the things they can choose are a lot<br/>
more dangerous than how much TV they should watch so there is rarely a good<br/>
later age to start until it&#39;s too late and their gone.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well, what we do is if the kids want to watch a movie that they know <br/>
will have scary parts, I sit down with them and whenever a child <br/>
wants to skip a part they say &quot;Pause&quot; and I pause it. Then I can fast-<br/>
forward through the scary part for them. If one kid wants to see the <br/>
part, they other one can leave the room until we tell them to come <br/>
back in. This is what we did the first few times we watched Lord of <br/>
the Rings, which they both really wanted to see. After we bought the <br/>
DVD and watched all the &quot;Making Of&quot; documentaries, they were a lot <br/>
less scared of the bits and they chose to watch the whole thing <br/>
through. If we can&#39;t pause it - like with a TV show, they&#39;ll leave <br/>
the room or cover their eyes and ears.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, when both of my kids wanted to go see Harry Potter in the <br/>
theatre, we had read the books so they knew ahead of time that parts <br/>
might be scary. I arranged to go with a friend and her kids so that <br/>
if I had to leave the theatre with one kid, the other could stay and <br/>
watch with our friends. Both kids stayed through the whole thing, but <br/>
my son chose to turn around and cover his eyes and ears for parts of <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just what works here. The kids seem to self-regulate with <br/>
regards to what they will find scary. <br/>

wall. &gt;&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
The implication of this is that if we allow eight and eleven year olds to <br/>
make choices about their lives, we&#39;re letting babies eat bugs and cigar butts <br/>
and stick things into the sockets.  Not a nice argument, truly.  If the <br/>
methods being discussed here were having nasty and dangerous results, nobody <br/>
would be recommending them.  But they&#39;re having sweet, peaceful, surprisingly <br/>
great results.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; if the tv is on, nothing gets done!  The older children neglect helping <br/>
with the baby, they don&#39;t do their chores unless constantly reminded and <br/>
nagged.  And for me unschooling is about stopping the nagging...so why would <br/>
I set that same situation up by allowing the tv to be on non-stop?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With over 100 e-mails left to go, I realize I might be duplicating something, <br/>
but the good thing about two people saying the same thing is it keeps anyone <br/>
from thinking the first was just a weirdo.<br/>
<br/>
Allowing children to choose when to watch television<br/>
DOES NOT equal having it on non-stop.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have chores, there will be nothing to nag about.<br/>
<br/>
If you have to turn the tv off to avoid nagging, that&#39;s probably indicative <br/>
of some other problems.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What is currently happening around out house is the tv is not supposed to <br/>
be one during the day but after dinner we might sit and watch Jeopardy <br/>
together, then maybe we watch another hour or two depending on what is on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Depending on what is on&quot; is the way television decisions work, exactly.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;what is on&quot; isn&#39;t the same as choosing days and hours in advance.  <br/>
Sometimes the one coolest thing is on at 9:30 a.m. on a weekday, or 11:00 at <br/>
night on Friday.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But honestly there is so much junk on tv.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are some truly trashy magazines.  Do you forbid magazines in your house?<br/>
<br/>
Some books are evil crap and should never have been published.  Do you still <br/>
have books in your house?<br/>
<br/>
There are some atrocious talk shows on the radio, but I  never listen to <br/>
them.  I go through channels until I hear a song I like, and if I don&#39;t hear <br/>
one I like I turn it off, or put a tape in.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess it might be better if I had cable or satalite that I could program <br/>
to show only the channels that might help educate or entertain my children in <br/>
appropriate childlike ways but alas, that is not an option.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Videos?  PBS?  <br/>
Kids don&#39;t tend to watch stuff they&#39;re not interested in.  Why would they?<br/>
They also won&#39;t read books they&#39;re not interested in.<br/>
They also won&#39;t read magazines they don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I guess anything in moderation is ok but I really hate the content on tv <br/>
most times.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some things in moderation are not okay because the kids don&#39;t want them.  Is <br/>
math homework okay in moderation?  Are standardized tests okay in moderation? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If children are limited to hearing and seeing only what moms don&#39;t hate, <br/>
maybe moms need to consciously learn to love lots of things.<br/>

<br/>
To discuss the idea that children also should have rights in the house is <br/>
likely to cause a disagreement here which will look like a difference of <br/>
philosophy, but it would go along religious lines.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re really back to whether there is an &quot;us and them&quot; (adults and children) <br/>
or whether there can really be a &quot;we&quot; who live together and a we who make <br/>

it at first, but I have to say that I would never want to go back to watching <br/>
regular tv. It is so easy to use and it gives you so much freedom and control<br/>
over tv...you are not tied to the tv schedule and have so much flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
I love how easy it is to record the kids shows (especially the ones after they go<br/>
to bed) and it is there whenever they want to watch. No need to worry about missing<br/>
favorite programs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594738842">I hardly ever post, but I feel the need to jump in. I was probably the one that was saying the tv didn&#39;t work. I have tried doing the unlimited thing, and my kids WILL sit for 3-4 hours at a time. In fact, they choose that over other things I offer. I am just not Ok with that. It seems addicting to me, and I still am not ok about the research that has been done showing the affects on the developing brain and excess tv. Even though some have it on and aren&#39;t watching, I don&#39;t think that is healthy for anyone. I rarely watch tv, and I don&#39;t feel as though I am missing anything. I just can&#39;t sit back and watch my kids sit and sit. Even two hours a day seems like too much to me right now. My kids are 5 1/2. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read the book Magical Child, Magical Parent? It is excellent, I think. But, after reading it, I was back again to the tv is not a healthy thing. I don&#39;t think it is a healthy thing for anyone, but especially the younger ones whose brains are still developing.I keep reading about the unlimited tv thing, and I just can&#39;t feel ok about it. Plus, there is no way I will subject my kids to all of that advertising. That makes me angry (and we DO talk about advertising alot, in fact). And, they do ask me for the things they see on the ads, and that makes me angry that the advertisers are using our children like this.<br/>

Anyway, just my two cents...<br/>

isn&#39;t a temporary thing. If they fear it will be restricted, they&#39;re going<br/>
to try to pack in as much as they can. And their fears came true, didn&#39;t<br/>

does the research hold more importance for you than what people actually<br/>

<br/>
Anything that supports what we want to believe, takes on undue importance in<br/>
our minds. Being objective is setting aside what we want to believe and<br/>
looking at what is real and true.<br/>
<br/>
What is real and true is that the reasearchers are wrong. At least in the<br/>
cases of unschooled kids who have far more hours in their day than schooled<br/>
kids. And even in the case of me who went to school *and* had unrestricted<br/>
TV. I found the time for lots of TV *and* other things too like drawing and<br/>
reading and writing and going outside. And I got into a good college.<br/>
<br/>
So how does the research explain that?<br/>
<br/>
If you consider all the hours in a child&#39;s day that are affected by going to<br/>
school -- which includes getting ready, homework, recovering from the day --<br/>
can you confidently say that what kids get out of those hours is better<br/>
spent than if the child had spent those hours doing something that interests<br/>
them? Even if it&#39;s spent watching TV?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I rarely watch tv, and I don&#39;t feel as though I am missing anything.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I rarely go to sports events, opera, tractor pulls, dog shows, lectures,<br/>
poetry readings and don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m mising much. But what does that<br/>
mean? It means my tastes are different than someone who adores those things.<br/>
Should my not finding meaning in them mean that others shouldn&#39;t find<br/>
meaning in them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I <br/>
&gt; just can&#39;t sit back and watch my kids sit and sit. Even two hours a day seems<br/>
&gt; like too much to me right now. My kids are 5 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you want to unschool, being comfortable with what your kids are<br/>
interested in shouldn&#39;t be of primary importance. Unschooling is about<br/>
helping *them* explore their interests, not in helping them explore what you<br/>
feel is important.<br/>
<br/>
Schools often cover up the windows because the teachers find they can&#39;t<br/>
compete with what&#39;s going on outside. Rather than figuring out what *would*<br/>
interest the kids, they choose to make other alternatives duller than the<br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t find things that interest them *more* than TV then either TV is<br/>
really important to them or you&#39;re not being sensitive to what *they* are<br/>
interested in. Have you watched the programs with them and watched them to<br/>
see what they find funny or interesting? Have you asked them what they find<br/>
so fascinating? Have you talked about their favorite characters and scenes?<br/>
Have you tried sharing your favorite movies or old TV shows with them? Have<br/>
you looked their shows up on the internet to find behind the scenes types of<br/>
things that might interest them?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But, after reading it, I was back again to the tv is not a healthy thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But if the thoughts in that book don&#39;t match what happens in real life, then<br/>
what worth are they? They serve to help you feel that your fears are<br/>
justified even in the face of real life examples that they aren&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think it is a healthy thing for anyone, but especially the younger<br/>
&gt; ones whose brains are still developing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how do you reconcile that belief to what people are telling you is truth<br/>
in their lives and the lives of their children? It&#39;s like believing that a<br/>
house is haunted because someone presented a good case for it in a book, but<br/>
the people who have lived in the house their whole lives say that it isn&#39;t<br/>
haunted. Why believe a book over real life? Because you wish the book were<br/>
true and the people living the life weren&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I keep reading about the unlimited tv thing, and I just can&#39;t feel ok about<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you hold onto what you want to believe is true rather than examining an<br/>
uncomfortable reality and why reality doesn&#39;t match what you want to be<br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Plus, there is no way I will subject my kids to all of that advertising. That<br/>
&gt; makes me angry (and we DO talk about advertising alot, in fact). And, they do<br/>
&gt; ask me for the things they see on the ads, and that makes me angry that the<br/>
&gt; advertisers are using our children like this.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter sees advertising as a resource. She sees what&#39;s available. (We<br/>
have discussed the purpose and she knows the purpose is to make money and<br/>
can be cynical at times at what advertisers are trying to get people to<br/>
believe. I find it more effective to talk about commercials that are aimed<br/>
at *me* so I can point out how they&#39;re trying to make me believe something<br/>
is true to get me to buy something.)<br/>
<br/>
Again, reality doesn&#39;t match what we fear will happen. Advertising isn&#39;t<br/>
that hard to understand. It&#39;s a pretty simple concept. I&#39;ve always trusted<br/>
that my daughter is intelligent enough to get the concept.<br/>
