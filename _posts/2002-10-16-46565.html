&gt;Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Digest Number 2490<br/>
&gt;Date: Wed, Oct 16, 2002, 3:05 AM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Thanks for all your replies, I do enjoy discussing this and I do have a lot<br/>
&gt; to digest. I  feel quite comfortable with most of the ideas. I do however<br/>
&gt; find some of the responses (not only to me) on this group harsh,<br/>
&gt; judgemental and aggressive. I do not understand this, since I would think<br/>
&gt; people that so strongly believe in this style of parenting would be far<br/>
&gt; more helpful to help other people in transition (like myself) to understand<br/>
&gt; what unschooling is about. I imagine some people might be turned off by<br/>
&gt; individual aggressive replies rather than the philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The styles that people prefer to read vary as widely as the styles that<br/>
people write. I much prefer someone who just tells me what they think<br/>
without frills or hand-patting, some much prefer an extremely gentle<br/>
approach.<br/>
<br/>
My writing style (says the writer) is not something that I am willing (or<br/>
possibly able) to change. I like my writing style. It&#39;s me. Many others like<br/>
it, too, but that&#39;s just a side benefit. My writing is one of the most pure<br/>
parts of Who I Am. I&#39;d rather get into physical self-mutilation if I were<br/>
going to start cutting up my Self.<br/>
<br/>
In a medium where our writing is all we know of each other (excepting a few<br/>
of us who have met a few others of us in real life) I believe it&#39;s wise to<br/>
get used to reading the message and not critiquing the style of the<br/>
messenger. Even if I think somebody is whining or cloying or coddling in<br/>
their style, I try not to tell them so. :) Just my little effort at public<br/>
service.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; As far as limits go, someone suggested that I might not trust my children.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe that this is a matter about trust. I believe it is about<br/>
&gt; understanding my role as parent. I have always felt that my role is to love<br/>
&gt; them, guide them and protect them. Within the unschooling approach I<br/>
&gt; understand that I have to love them and guide them, but don&#39;t protect them.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not quite at ease with that. If feel that I might not be fulfilling my<br/>
&gt; responsibility if I don&#39;t protect the and to protect them means to<br/>
&gt; sometimes keep them away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When talking about limits, you&#39;re trying to protect your children from<br/>
themselves and their own judgment calls. That&#39;s where the trust issue comes<br/>
in. I trust my children to make choices for themselves at any given time,<br/>
even if it&#39;s not a choice I would have made for them. They will make some<br/>
poor choices and learn from them. If I am in charge of choosing for them *I*<br/>
would make some poor choices for them, and what good would that do them?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think my uneasiness with all this is that I might make the wrong choice<br/>
&gt; for my children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, that brings us back to the beginning and letting them make the choices<br/>
for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A hypothetical question comes to mind. What would you all do if your young<br/>
&gt; teenager experiences with serious drugs??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children who experiment with drugs don&#39;t usually have better choices, and/or<br/>
are trying to fill a void with a high. My children have better choices and<br/>
know how to fill voids with my help and without.<br/>
<br/>
I am not trying to dismiss what is obviously a very real fear, but my mind<br/>
boggles, you see. We have a home business. We unschool. Our children have<br/>
rich and varied lives and interests and keen curiousity. Making the leap<br/>
from there to a neglected bored schooled teen surrounded by same-situation<br/>
peers, many of them latch-key kids with no interest other than wearing black<br/>
and sneering, to the bright and interesting and active unschooled teens I<br/>
know is more a jump than I&#39;m able for.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bit like asking me what I would do if Brit took up a knife and tried<br/>
to kill the dog. Well, I&#39;d stop her, but I don&#39;t expect her to do it. She<br/>
has better outlets for her energy, even her anger.<br/>
<br/>
If my daughter were experimenting with serious drugs that presented a clear<br/>
and present danger of harming her or landing us all in jail, I would of<br/>
course stop her, just as I did stop my two year old from running headlong<br/>
down the stairs.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m not interested in living our lives in prevention of Worst Case<br/>
Scenario.<br/>
