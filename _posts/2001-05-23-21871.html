<div id="ygrps-yiv-330776395">PLEASE!!  for those poor souls on digest!!!  I was off for a week <br/>
last week (was it quiet?  oh, no, Sandra was back *grin* you can e-<br/>
bop me if you want, Sandra LOL) and had my mail set to daily <br/>
digest (being utterly unable to go without my mail lists, and just <br/>
plain nosy!)  It&#39;s really hard to have to scan through several hundred <br/>
(no I don&#39;t think I&#39;m exaggerating) messages in digests when they <br/>
have all the yahoo blurb repeated at the bottom and the whole of <br/>
someone else&#39;s huuuuge post as well.<br/>
<br/>
I now have over 480 emails in my unschooling-dotcom folder and <br/>
some of those are still digests.  Gonna take me a while to catch <br/>
up, my you&#39;ve been busy!!!<br/>
<br/>
Keep it up, but please remember to cut stuff down when you&#39;re <br/>
replying!<br/>
<br/>
