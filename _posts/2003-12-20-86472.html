<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496485003">As someone who is new to the idea of unschooling, I just read Nancy Wallace&#39;s <br/>
book and found it very interesting but I too think that it&#39;s overwhelming.  I <br/>
can&#39;t see either of my children ever writing operas, etc.  But my son is very <br/>
good at playing in the sandbox and building forts with the couch cushions!  <br/>
It really was an inspiration though of how it could be.  Thanks for everyone <br/>
who recommended it.  My next book to tackle is Valerie Fitzenreiter...maybe I <br/>
can find time over the holidays!<br/>
