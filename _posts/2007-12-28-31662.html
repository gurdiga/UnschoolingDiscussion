<div id="ygrps-yiv-203007172">I could be going about this so much better, but I don&#39;t know how.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 7 1/2.  The current situation looks something like this<br/>
(although we have variants on a regular basis)...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s schooled friend Hannah is over during her vacation.  Marti (my<br/>
dd) is always asking if Hannah can come over.  Now that she is here though,<br/>
all Marti wants to do is play video games (which is fine, normally), but she<br/>
expects Hannah to just sit there and watch her.  Hannah keeps trying to get<br/>
up which leads me to believe that Hannah is bored.  So Marti moves from<br/>
video game to video game trying to keep Hannah wanting to just sit there and<br/>
watch her, but Hannah would rather go and play with the younger kids.  Marti<br/>
gets upset.<br/>
<br/>
So, Marti sulks on the couch.  I try to go comfort her.  I try and give her<br/>
ideas to help her.  She could play a 2 player game, she could try playing<br/>
something Hannah wants to play, etc.  My ideas only make her more upset and<br/>
frustrated.  She attacks all my ideas with reasons why those things won&#39;t<br/>
work.  Clearly she doesn&#39;t want my advice so I end up walking away (due to<br/>
my own frustration many times), but then she is still upset.<br/>
<br/>
What could I be doing better?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m looking forward to hearing the answers on this. In Jayn&#39;s case it was an <br/>
expectation that her friends would be interested in sitting and watching her <br/>
sing and dance for them - for a really long time. Her friends became swiftly <br/>
bored.<br/>
<br/>
In our case I just had to allow Jayn to go through feeling frustrated (and <br/>
listen to her anger in private) when her friends eventually expressed their <br/>
boredom with the activity. Once she had been through feeling her <br/>
disappointment, *then* she was ready to return to the world of logic and <br/>
hear the other ideas and come to acceptance that it was not a reasonable <br/>
expectation on her part, and that other people needed turns and a say in <br/>
their game choices.<br/>
<br/>
BTW this whole sequence happened a few times before she internalized it, and <br/>
now there is a lot more taking turns being the center of the dance. I guess <br/>
it is a bit surprising how sometimes kids need to go through a learning <br/>
process a few times to see that the principles are constant (or something) <br/>
and don&#39;t &quot;get  it&quot; from the first experience. Once I let go of any <br/>
expectation that &quot;saying it once should be enough&quot; I got to feel better.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of times our neighbors come and play separate computer, hand held <br/>
and/or x-box games at our house as the first choice of activity. When <br/>
everyone is playing it is very peaceful and pleasant. Everyone celebrates <br/>
each other&#39;s successes and task completions. Sometimes all three will crowd <br/>
around the DS to watch a replay and cheer. The little boy will come and read <br/>
screens for Jayn or his sister. They constantly talk about what they are <br/>
doing and help each other. Sometimes I am called to help too. The activity <br/>
is not isolating at all most of the time. Then after a while one or another <br/>
will be done with the computer/game and will start playing dolls. They <br/>
eventually they will all start making a fort or something or go outside to <br/>
make their sweet Harry Potter play (with props and costumes). :)<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if there is some other activity that Hannah could do right by the <br/>
computer. Is she interested in a hand held game? Could you set up a craft or <br/>
drawing activity next to the computer?<br/>
<br/>
Can you spend a lot more time watching your dd play? I sit by Jayn a lot <br/>
with my laptop or writing notebook or my loom knittng or my beading and get <br/>
to multitask to the extent that she will let me between helping her with <br/>
various tasks. Her latest game interest in Nancy Drew - and there are some <br/>
really tough puzzles. It is worth examining whether you are seeing her <br/>
computer time as &quot;your break&quot; time.<br/>

<br/>
When someone has a guest, it&#39;s good to do what the guest wants to  <br/>
do.  That&#39;s no rule, that a principle at the most basic level of  <br/>
principles.  Part of the job of a host at every moment is to make the  <br/>
guest feel welcome and comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before Marti&#39;s visiting, brainstorm several things they could do  <br/>
together, or take them out.  I found my kids got along with ANY kids  <br/>
better when they were on neutral territory--a playground or in a park  <br/>
or anywhere.  If it&#39;s a two-hour visit, plan three or four hours&#39;  <br/>
worth of stuff in case some of the plans bomb.  Set them up with a  <br/>
playdough station in on room, and have something already set up in  <br/>
another room for when they get tired of that.<br/>
<br/>
If you have something that will be new to Hannah too, it will be easy  <br/>
for her to be excited and enthusiastic and not thinking about video  <br/>
games.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87492522">Hi...I replied to you over at UB but I&#39;m not sure if you saw it. The <br/>
first thing that came to my mind is what I do with my middle child <br/>
(she&#39;s 12) which is talk to her about this *before* it happens. Talk <br/>
about what your observations were (her friend being bored, etc) and ask <br/>
her what she thinks about it. My daughter seems to handle<br/>
situations better when the two of us can have some alone time and just <br/>
talk about it. I find that talking to her *while* it&#39;s happening is a <br/>
lose-lose situation. <br/>

Can you spend a lot more time watching your dd play?<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Robyn,<br/>
Yes.  I am sure I can.  I don&#39;t really think of her game time as my break<br/>
time.  Sometimes I play with her.  Usually a bit every day.  She loves<br/>
watching either me or her dad play which works too, mostly.  So, we do play<br/>
with her and we do watch her play.  I think it is kindda hard because there<br/>
are some things I really do need to get done during the day (including<br/>
spending time with my youngest, and when she needs me, she wants me to sit<br/>
with her and watch a movie, which, again, I do nearly every day) and she<br/>
(Marti) could watch me play all day (and we have taken those days, believe<br/>
me).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really do watch her play.  I don&#39;t think that is the problem so<br/>
much. I was just wondering what to do when friends are over.  Or do you<br/>
think that it&#39;s because I don&#39;t watch her enough that she thinks she needs<br/>
her friends to watch her?<br/>
<br/>

You got the names backwards, but that isn&#39;t the point.  This is really not<br/>
what I expected anyone to say.  It took me by surprise.  It makes sense to<br/>
me, but how do I explain that to Marti?  She would be devistated if I told<br/>
her she had to go that long without video games.  She would sulk A LOT.<br/>
<br/>
I guess maybe just the planning other things for them would work.  I will<br/>
have to think on that.  Thank you.<br/>

<br/>
Sorry about the names.<br/>
<br/>
Why explain it?  Why say it&#39;s a long time?<br/>
<br/>
If she wants her friend to come over, you could say &quot;Okay, what do   <br/>
you want to do with her?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest part of parenting is helping a child understand  <br/>
how the culture works, what&#39;s expected of them, what makes things  <br/>
smoother and happier.<br/>
<br/>
If  your family is in the habit of watching each other play games,  <br/>
it&#39;s worth mentioning that it&#39;s not something everyone will want to do.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that&#39;s excrutiating for me is for someone to say &quot;Listen to  <br/>
this song.&quot;  For my kids, sometimes I will, but it&#39;s not easy.<br/>
<br/>
That surprises other people sometimes, but I need to warm up to music  <br/>
gradually and in my own time, not with someone else  watching me  <br/>
listen and waiting for a reaction or review.  I just refuse, usually,  <br/>
or listen to a little bit of it and ask where I can find it later.   <br/>
You&#39;d think three or four minutes wouldn&#39;t hurt me, but you&#39;d be  <br/>
wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So the idea of watching someone else play a video game is, for most  <br/>
people,  unthinkable and nutty (if not painful or excrutiating).<br/>

reading something you&#39;d written, maybe on your blog, about Holly <br/>
spitting on a parking lot, I think, and you saying something <br/>
about &quot;doing it where people won&#39;t walk&quot;, and then there was another <br/>
place where you mentioned Marty with his head shaved and you told him <br/>
about some places seeing it differently (Oh, something like that, bad <br/>
paraphrase, I know).  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was thinking about that, and how if someone was planning a <br/>
trip to a foreign country you&#39;d try to make sure they were aware of <br/>
the customs so they wouldn&#39;t do socially unaccaptable things while <br/>
they were there.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a LOT of things *we* as adults know, and sometimes we just <br/>
assume the kids should know, too, but they don&#39;t...how could they?  <br/>
I&#39;m trying to keep that in mind when talking with my kids...for <br/>
example today during church my youngest got a bottle of body spray <br/>
out of her purse and spritzed herself, and I told her that some <br/>
people are allergic to scents/sprays and it wasn&#39;t polite to spray in <br/>
public.  I used to would have just said, &quot;Don&#39;t&quot; without explaining, <br/>
but I&#39;m finding it really helps them to know *WHY*.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-947735276">I joined &quot;AlwaysLearning&quot; right around this time last year as a brand  <br/>
new unschooler and was surprised and delighted to read the discussion  <br/>
at that time around children and media.  It was exactly what I was  <br/>
wondering about and struggling with as I tried moving away from a  <br/>
philosophy that previously restricted all access to TV for my kids in  <br/>
our home.   My original post is #27632.  It&#39;s amazing to look back  <br/>
even one year and see how far we&#39;ve come.<br/>
<br/>
I want to say THANK YOU to Sandra Dodd, Joyce Fetteroll, Pamela  <br/>
Sorooshian, and so many others of you in this unschooling community  <br/>
for your wonderful support around this philosophy of living.  I have  <br/>
grown so much personally in this past year, and I feel that I am truly  <br/>
getting to know, and LOVE, my son as. he. is.  I can think of no  <br/>
greater gift.<br/>
<br/>
I felt inspired to begin my own blog about our family&#39;s continued  <br/>
unschooling journey and I wanted to share the first post with you  <br/>
all.  This &quot;love letter&quot; to SpongeBob represents a complete turnaround  <br/>
for me as a result of the shifts we&#39;ve experienced in this first year  <br/>
of living more freely, joyfully, and authentically.  That said, I have  <br/>
lots more to learn and let go of but with your help, I&#39;m doing it!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to another year with you all.  THANK YOU for all that  <br/>
you do.<br/>
<br/>
~ Erica<br/>
KitchenOrTheEgg.com unschooling blog<br/>
(Declan, 4.5 yrs., Quinlan, 22 mos.)<br/>
<br/>
Dear SpongeBob,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a year since we&#39;ve been �seeing� each other, and I thought  <br/>
I&#39;d mark our anniversary with this love letter to you in my new blog.   <br/>
You see, during this past year, you have probably helped to  <br/>
demonstrate the changes in me more than anything else.  I just want to  <br/>
say thank you.  Some background...<br/>
<br/>
My son has loved you for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
I despised you.<br/>
<br/>
I thought you were just another �nonsense� cartoon whose image is  <br/>
everywhere, over-merchandised throughout my local department and toy  <br/>
stores.  To me, you represented the epitome of everything ridiculous  <br/>
in our society that got in the way of my raising my son �right.�  I  <br/>
had also never watched an episode.<br/>
<br/>
Things changed after I read the education book, �Teach Your Own� by  <br/>
John Holt.  I got so excited about the wonderful homeschooling ideas  <br/>
he wrote about!  I hosted a discussion group about it on January 5,  <br/>
2007, and that&#39;s when I began to get to know you, and my son, in a  <br/>
brand new way.  It marks the beginning of my conscious focus on  <br/>
following Declan&#39;s lead about his interests which, of course, included  <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
As a result of his passionate interest in you, we lifted the TV  <br/>
restrictions in our home and ended up watching lots of your shows.   <br/>
After a while, I found myself laughing at your crazy encounters with  <br/>
Squidward, cracking up at Patrick&#39;s jokes, appreciating Sandy&#39;s Texas  <br/>
spunk, smiling at Mrs. Puff&#39;s classroom management techniques,  <br/>
giggling at Mr. Krabs&#39; extreme frugality, and wondering what Plankton  <br/>
would do next in his quest to take over the Krusty Krab.<br/>
<br/>
Of course you portray the ridiculous in your show � we&#39;re talking  <br/>
about conversing crustaceans and their underwater lives, complete with  <br/>
restaurants and motorboats.  But to consider you as something  <br/>
negative, irrelevant, or even evil?  Never again.  I regret that my  <br/>
past negative feelings about you could have led my son to feel like he  <br/>
was shallow, or worse, a bad person, for enjoying you.  I judged you  <br/>
based on false assumptions.  Exactly what I strive not to do.  And  <br/>
something I hope my children would never do.<br/>
<br/>
I adore you, SpongeBob.  I relate to your enthusiasm and openness when  <br/>
pursuing new ideas, interests, and adventures.  I&#39;m inspired by your  <br/>
boundless optimism and enchanted by your bright, happy outlook on the  <br/>
world.  To me, you represent a lifestyle that embraces a zest for  <br/>
living, the way I want life to feel in our home.  But most of all, I  <br/>
appreciate the connection you&#39;ve helped me to establish with my son  <br/>
around something he loves.  It has been a valuable gateway to  <br/>
countless other interests.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for providing me with an amazing opportunity to connect with  <br/>
Declan at his level, on his terms, not filtered through my own likes  <br/>
and dislikes.  I don&#39;t want him limited to choices within a range of  <br/>
what I like or am familiar with.  The world is bigger than me and my  <br/>
experience.  He is here to walk his path in his own way.  I am here as  <br/>
a loving guide helping him to access and navigate this world.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, I share with him my ways and views about life.  So why wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
I be open to his?  In his own unique way?  Even if we don&#39;t share the  <br/>
same tastes.  I don&#39;t have to like everything he likes.  But to ignore  <br/>
or not take seriously his deep interest in something?  Not to learn  <br/>
more about something that&#39;s important to him?  That feels wrong to me.<br/>
<br/>
We watch you together now, SpongeBob.  I love hearing Declan&#39;s  <br/>
reactions to what happens with you and your friends.  Now that I&#39;m a  <br/>
regular viewer, I know what&#39;s going on in your life �down, down, down  <br/>
at the bottom of the sea,� and can offer context to my son&#39;s  <br/>
spontaneous, seemingly random comments or questions about a scene he  <br/>
saw.  This mama now considers you her favorite cartoon.  Here&#39;s to  <br/>
many more years of happiness together!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
Erica<br/>

I&#39;d like to put it in my TV section.   There&#39;s a place in there  <br/>

today, so this was nice to see.  Off to get our 3am snack and watch <br/>
SpongeBob again...and again and again and again.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803094555">Spongebob Squarepants is my favourite cartoon too. My son and I have <br/>
probably watched every episode ever made at least three times and once, <br/>
while on holiday, happily sat through a four hour marathon from start <br/>
to finish. Rock Bottom is a classic (the one where Spongebob keeps <br/>
missing the bus), and the one about the Sea Bear, and the Hash Slinging <br/>
Slasher ...<br/>
<br/>
My son is called Patrick, btw. :)<br/>

She doesn&#39;t *have* to. It&#39;s a choice to make between making her<br/>
friend comfortable or uncomfortable. You&#39;re not creating a rule for<br/>
her to adhere to, eg, &quot;When your friend is here you aren&#39;t allowed to<br/>
play video games.&quot; You&#39;re helping her think up ways to help her<br/>
friend be comfortable and have fun.<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I did give her the choice and she chose video games.  What her friend was<br/>
feeling didn&#39;t seem to matter to her.<br/>

invite her friend over.<br/>

<br/>
Was it a sufficiently informed choice?<br/>
<br/>
What is the principle?  It helps to see the principles behind  <br/>
decisions (such as whether to invite her friend over).<br/>
<br/>
WHY is her friend coming over?  Defending that situation will make  <br/>
sense, if your daughter has a &quot;why.&quot;  And the friend should be in on  <br/>
that, too.  If the friend is coming over just so you can checkbox  <br/>
&quot;friend came over,&quot; or &quot;socializing,&quot; then it&#39;s fine not to worry  <br/>
about the friend&#39;s feelings.  If the friend is invited over the play,  <br/>
then there&#39;s an obligation to provide and encourage play.<br/>
<br/>
Did you play with them?  Have you considered creating a situation  <br/>
you&#39;re in too?  A board game or cookie baking or pipe-cleaner  <br/>
sculpture project?<br/>
<br/>
Some people see unschooling as a new set of rules.  &quot;Children have to  <br/>
have choices.&quot;  If that&#39;s seen as a principle instead of &quot;a rule,&quot;  <br/>
your thinking should become easier.  But the choice might be better  <br/>
moved back before the friend comes over, and before the friend is  <br/>
invited.   Does your daughter want to play with her friend or play  <br/>
video games?  If the latter, don&#39;t invite the friend over.<br/>
<br/>
If I tell Holly I will pick her up from a party, I *could* choose not  <br/>
to, but only at the cost of her faith in me, at the cost of my  <br/>
integrity and reliability, and possibly at the cost of her safety.    <br/>
When a person makes a decision, other factors should be considered,  <br/>
not just &quot;at this moment, do you feel like playing a video game or  <br/>
not?&quot; or &quot;At this moment, do you feel like going out into the dark  <br/>
and the cold to drive the car or not?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you&#39;re looking at the wrong part of the &quot;problem.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Try to coach your DD ahead of time that her friend will only watch her<br/>
for a little while.  Ask DD if she still wants her friend there if her<br/>
friend stops watching after only a little bit.  <br/>
<br/>
If her friend wants to come over knowing your DD will spend most of<br/>
her time playing games, and is okay with watching for a while then<br/>
playing with the littler kids, then your DD&#39;s game playing is not a<br/>
problem for the friend.<br/>
<br/>
The four and three year olds probably see the friend coming over as a<br/>
special treat.<br/>
