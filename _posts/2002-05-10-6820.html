 Right now, he&#39;s fascinated by friction. He thinks it would be neat if he had<br/>
 frictionless skates. That led to a discussion of gravity, and space, and the<br/>
 three laws, and acceleration, and on and on. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Cool stuff!<br/>
<br/>
I loved your &quot;real life&quot; analogies btw...those were PHUNNY!!<br/>
