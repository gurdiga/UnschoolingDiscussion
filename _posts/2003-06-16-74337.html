  &lt;&lt; any advice? anything you would do differently? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I found with Joseph and Sierra., once in awhile a situation would come up<br/>
  when I would think a thank you would be nice from them and they didn&#39;t say<br/>
  it. It bothered me and I would do the whole &quot;say thank you&quot; thing and they<br/>
  would say it then. I started to really think about it and why they didn&#39;t do<br/>
  it and why it bothered me. My kids weren&#39;t really being rude at all. From<br/>
  what I could see, they were just being kids and had no clue most of the time<br/>
  that someone would be &quot;expecting&quot; a thank you or just very involved in the<br/>
  moment or just having their brain be somewhere else. So I figured what&#39;s the<br/>
  harm really? They&#39;re still kids and Tara certainly is very polite and where<br/>
  did she get it from? Us and watching.<br/>
<br/>
  So now I just leave it to me doing what I feel is proper and sometimes I<br/>
  just offer thank you&#39;s for them. Sierra can be very shy at times and<br/>
  sometimes a thank you is just too much for her. I won&#39;t push that and I<br/>
  won&#39;t &quot;make them&quot; offer politeness without sincerity. I know they will get<br/>
  it eventually.<br/>
<br/>
  And if there are times when I think maybe with a friend something would have<br/>
  been nice other than what was done, I&#39;ll talk to them about it. Reminding<br/>
  them how when they do something for each other, they like to be thanked for<br/>
  it and wouldn&#39;t it make someone else feel nice too? We do a lot of talking<br/>
  here about our feelings with each other and then relating that to other<br/>
  people as well. Asking how would that make you feel or what would be nice<br/>
  for you to do??? They even like this kind of talking to, it gives them<br/>
  another outlook on things and they like coming up with different ways or<br/>
  wondering how other people would feel.<br/>

both. Possibly, (but maybe not) throwing in a little dialogue about <br/>
not WANTING to give Uncle Normie a kiss, and in that role playing, <br/>
showing the kids that if they balk, mom isn&#39;t going to push it, but <br/>
inquire into their reasons for balking. IOW, giving them permission <br/>
to speak their mind if the hugging and kissing (or, for that matter, <br/>
the greeting and saying thank you) is uncomfortable for them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140000505">Oh my,<br/>
<br/>
I have an Aunt who gets all offended if the kids don&#39;t go give her a hug.  My mom even got into the act once, which surprised me, but she has never done it since.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say to the kids in front of her &quot;its ok, you don&#39;t have to give a hug if you don&#39;t want to&quot;.<br/>

Rain&#39;s dad does with her, or tries to do. He stills tries to guilt her<br/>
into hugging or kissing him at every visit - and this has been going on<br/>
since she was 4 (which is when he got out of prison).  I asked him once<br/>
what he would think if she was 16 and her boyfriend was saying what he<br/>
says, &quot;Come on, I&#39;ll be really sad if you do&#39;t kiss me, it means a lot to<br/>
me&quot;, etc., etc. He just didn&#39;t get it - &quot;But I&#39;m her dad, not her<br/>
boyfriend&quot;. Arrgghh. One of the things he did with her that pissed me off<br/>
the most was when she was 4 and didn&#39;t want to kiss him good-bye or be<br/>
kissed, and I got her all buckled into the carseat and he leaned in -<br/>
purportedly to tell her good-bye - and kissed her and and then gloated...<br/>
I was so furious.<br/>
<br/>
But it is all about him. He loves her in a way, but he also tries to use<br/>
her to meet his emotional needs.<br/>

that I&#39;ll back her up. He&#39;s not a very functional guy - he&#39;s been living<br/>
