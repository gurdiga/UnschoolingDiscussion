<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621765784">**I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll all get through it. It is funny most of the time. Looks like <br/>
we have a mouse in the house as we find food with one little bite out of <br/>
it!! **<br/>
<br/>
I have the most marvelous picture of my then 2 yo daughter sitting in the <br/>
middle of the kitchen table with a huge grin on her face, surrounded by <br/>
apples that each have one little nibble taken out of them.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 17 now. She hasn&#39;t done anything like that in a long time. :)<br/>

That is too funny. My oldest, who will be 17 shortly also did that with <br/>
apples. Nothing else but apples. Except she would go into the fridge when I <br/>
wasn&#39;t looking, take a bite out of one apple and put it back, take a bite <br/>
out of another apple and put it back. She did that until she bit them all. I <br/>
have a picture too of her standing at the fridge, wearing only a diaper with <br/>
a one bite apple in her hand!!!<br/>
She still thinks that story is hysterical!<br/>
