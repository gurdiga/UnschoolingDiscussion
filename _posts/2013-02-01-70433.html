<div id="ygrps-yiv-1020407575">Something that showed me just how negative I can be was when I read a sign that said, &quot;Stop being afraid of what could go wrong, and focus on what could go right.&quot;  I have a bad habit of worrying about all that can go wrong. When I feel anxiety, I have this saying along with some scripture and other nice sayings, on my phone that I can instantly access to remind me to think kinder, gentler, more positively. Deep slow breathing helps immensely. <br/>
