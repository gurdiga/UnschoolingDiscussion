<div id="ygrps-yiv-903533233">Hi.  I&#39;m a homeschooling mom and do freelance marketing/PR work.  <br/>
I&#39;m currently doing a marketing job for an education web site called <br/>
Project Power.  An innovative site devoted to enhancing learning <br/>
through hands-on projects, Project Power combines great projects <br/>
with convenient tools to assign and manage projects online.<br/>
 <br/>
Currently, the site is used by public schools, but it will soon be <br/>
opened to homeschoolers.  I am helping them evaluate appropriate <br/>
pricing and changes to the web site to make it as friendly as <br/>
possible to homeschool users.<br/>
 <br/>
In that effort, I am seeking a group of 15 to 20 homeschoolers who <br/>
would like to try the site for free for 30 days and provide feedback <br/>
to the company at the end of their trial.  (A 10-day trial is <br/>
available to any visitor).<br/>
 <br/>
You can peruse the site at www.projectpower.com.  If you&#39;re <br/>
interested in participating in the trial and shaping the site for <br/>
the homeschool community, please e-mail me at <br/>

Thank you,<br/>
