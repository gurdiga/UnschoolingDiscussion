<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326746742">Well, I&#39;m just gonna hafta do a search online for more Loretto Chapel info.<br/>
Got me going again!!<br/>
I&#39;m glad they figured out who the guy was....that part makes sense. But what <br/>
about the design? Did he talk about that in his journal?<br/>
And the type of wood he used, they could&#39;t figure out what it was.<br/>
Or were they just hyping the story to turn it into a &quot;Miracle&quot;.???<br/>
More questions.<br/>
I&#39;ll just quit for now, I&#39;m probably boring everyone. That place really drew <br/>
me though...the whole Santa Fe experience did. I love listening to Ottmar <br/>
Leibert&#39;s guitar music because it reminds me of it.<br/>
Ren, yearning to travel....</div>
