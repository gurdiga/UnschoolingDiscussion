<div id="ygrps-yiv-153362244">Hi guys,<br/>
My daughter and I got a Pooh book from the library about school.  &gt;rolling my <br/>
eyes&gt;  She loves anything with Pooh.  As I was reading it, I was think of <br/>
this list.  I wanted to share some of the comments in it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This schooling business-pencils and whatnot-it&#39;s overrated if you ask me.&quot; <br/>
(says Eeyore)<br/>
<br/>
Later .. &quot;If you have to go that far from home, I&#39;m sure school is not a good <br/>
thing for Piglets, &quot; said Piglet.<br/>
<br/>
A page or two later, Tigger is discussing bouncing in school.  Here is the <br/>
conversation:  &quot;there&#39;s no bouncing in school,&quot;said Eeyore decisively.  <br/>
&quot;None?&quot; asked Tigger.  &quot;School is work.  No time for fun, &quot; said Eeyore. <br/>
<br/>
hummmmmmm, need I say more. ........Of course the book goes on to say what <br/>
neat things you learn in school like ABC and counting, but we all know these <br/>
things are easier to learn when we are having fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-371995025">Hello Bonnie,<br/>
The ADDICTION..  will wear off, I could have kept going with just about every <br/>
animal possible. My hubby hates to tattoo me because ALL of my tatttoos HAVE <br/>
to be realistic and there are not enough pictures to go by and it is <br/>
difficult to make line sheets from books. I am saving skin for 2 more....... <br/>
family will really love me. A friend of ours (also a tattoo artist) drew a <br/>
sketch of my daughter and it came out beautiful and very realistic, hubby is <br/>
afraid that it wont come out the same in ink as it did in pencil. So I have <br/>
been procrastinating wether or not to get it. The other one is of a beautiful <br/>
black stallion with his mane all flowing and his nostrils all flared while he <br/>
is thundering across some open field  in all his freedom. You have to see it <br/>
to appreciate . Its so beautiful I almost cried when I saw it. The trouble is <br/>
with the line sheets , they can be so difficult and I really dont want to <br/>
ruin such a picture.<br/>

We are in Salem NH. You may of heard of all the shops on Rt. 28 in Salem. <br/>
There are plenty. But if you decide to cross the border we are at Ed&#39;s <br/>
Heritage , just ask for Russ. He always does my friends for almost free , <br/>
minus the $40.00  needles. They all love this because some of the tattoos go <br/>
for big money. The 40. covers his needles and supplies the tattoo goes for <br/>
free. (just to let everyone know, Because I know your all curious . The <br/>
needles are always brand new and COMPLETELY sterilized. and I make them <br/>
myself with TLC) sorry I had to say that alot of people want to know that.<br/>

I havent heard of her, but will be on the lookout for her in our mags. There <br/>

has dropped about people with tattoos . I have only been insulted twice by <br/>
strangers and they were both male. That only men get tattoos and how unlady <br/>

cause I bruise if they come within a foot of my hide!  Sooo, to quell the<br/>
itch I designed them and had them put on hubby &lt;g&gt;  Good thing he had broad<br/>
shoulders (ex-football player &lt;g&gt;) cause I was a busy little bee there for<br/>
awhile!  I hauled him down to SF a couple of times and had Lyle Tuttle put<br/>
a couple of them on him.  There was a guy named Ernie that did some really<br/>
beautiful work that I had so most of the rest of them on him.  Ernie was<br/>
the only artist I ever saw that could do beautiful work with browns and<br/>
yellows and did portraits that looked like they came off a canvas.  Don&#39;t<br/>
know whatever happened to him but he did some beautiful work on his wife<br/>
including a grizzly bear that looked like it was going to jump off her back<br/>
and come after ya!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1855837088">I was planning on going to salem to get it anyway. The problem that I have<br/>
is I&#39;m being very specific in what I want. I want a small (no more than 1-1<br/>
1/2 in.) Eeyore. Does he have anything like that? Also, If I get more than<br/>
one the same day is it the same price or is it per tatoo?. You can post off<br/>
list if you&#39;d like. I also need specific directions. I assume you&#39;re right<br/>
near the mall.<br/>

&gt; Hi Amy,<br/>
&gt; We are in Salem NH. You may of heard of all the shops on Rt. 28 in Salem.<br/>
&gt; There are plenty. But if you decide to cross the border we are at Ed&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Heritage , just ask for Russ. He always does my friends for almost free ,<br/>
&gt; minus the $40.00  needles. They all love this because some of the tattoos<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; for big money. The 40. covers his needles and supplies the tattoo goes for<br/>
&gt; free. (just to let everyone know, Because I know your all curious . The<br/>
&gt; needles are always brand new and COMPLETELY sterilized. and I make them<br/>
&gt; myself with TLC) sorry I had to say that alot of people want to know that.<br/>
&gt; Tamie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131539504">Hello Amy,<br/>
I will post you later on tonight Im kind of in a hurry , but didnt want you <br/>
to think that I wasnt responding. If you have a picture or something then <br/>
they can go by that. Look through the coloring books and any pooh books and <br/>
see if you like anything, they also have quite a few Pooh characters there <br/>
that you could pick from and  you could get any size that you want , they <br/>
will play with it until you approve. anyway gotta go . Talk to you later.<br/>

&gt;Hello Bonnie,<br/>
&gt;The ADDICTION..  will wear off, I could have kept going with just about <br/>
&gt;every<br/>
&gt;animal possible. My hubby hates to tattoo me because ALL of my tatttoos <br/>
&gt;HAVE<br/>
&gt;to be realistic and there are not enough pictures to go by and it is<br/>
&gt;difficult to make line sheets from books. I am saving skin for 2 <br/>
&gt;more.......<br/>
&gt;family will really love me. A friend of ours (also a tattoo artist) drew a<br/>
&gt;sketch of my daughter and it came out beautiful and very realistic, hubby <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;afraid that it wont come out the same in ink as it did in pencil. So I have<br/>
&gt;been procrastinating wether or not to get it. The other one is of a <br/>
&gt;beautiful<br/>
&gt;black stallion with his mane all flowing and his nostrils all flared while <br/>
&gt;he<br/>
&gt;is thundering across some open field  in all his freedom. You have to see <br/>
&gt;it<br/>
&gt;to appreciate . Its so beautiful I almost cried when I saw it. The trouble <br/>
&gt;is<br/>
&gt;with the line sheets , they can be so difficult and I really dont want to<br/>
&gt;ruin such a picture.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
