<br/>
Okay, here goes my plea for help:   We are both<br/>
non-religious, I have<br/>
very strong pagan leanings.  I am a very vehemently<br/>

My husband is an sweet, but slightly anal retentive<br/>
overachiever who insists on <br/>
workbook type curriculum so he can track our dd&#39;s progress.<br/>
 We tried compromising<br/>
by getting the Life Pac series of workbooks (as recommended<br/>
by a homeschooling <br/>
friend in NH).  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s killing me.  Every other paragraph lists a scripture<br/>

with dogma even the child is a-moanin!  (For ex. in a<br/>
chapter on hygiene in the Health<br/>

<br/>
I hope I have not offended anyone with this but the fact is<br/>
I&#39;m not looking for bible<br/>
classes. I would gleefully go back to ordering from<br/>
Carolina, but dh is also right that<br/>
the cost is AMAZING.  I just want something that helps her<br/>
focus on getting the job done, learning<br/>
about health, provoking discussions and more learning and<br/>
giving dh the workbook<br/>

News,  I&#39;m not sure what else is currently available with short articles and <br/>
lots of pictures) and go through those with her each month as they arrive and <br/>
do followup from websites or library?  It would keep him from easily tracking <br/>
scores on tests, but I think that would be good.  He&#39;ll probably come to <br/>
unschooling himself in a few months of that.  Tell him ANY pre-packaged <br/>
science curriculum will be old by the time it&#39;s published, compared to <br/>
current publications. <br/>
<br/>
I think there are some by-e-mail science experiments and news things you can <br/>
subscribe to (like by just giving them your e-mail address and being on the <br/>
list).  And there are videos and videos with kits of some of the old science <br/>
shows (Bill Nye and I forget the other one).  And there are geology field <br/>
trips and paleontology digs and all KINDS of real-life thing he could go and <br/>
do with her.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if these circumstances press him to see her learning the real way he <br/>
won&#39;t want the measured and sifted workbooks anymore.<br/>

if you have an ACE educational store, or any such store, you can look thru <br/>
and pick out your own books, they have all the courses labeled, and the <br/>
booklets are in all price ranges.  Also, just type in health curriculum in <br/>
the search area of your browser, or go to yahoo or google and type that in, <br/>
you will get a gazillion on line things, some you have to pay for, most are <br/>

P.s. The fathers dependence on textbooks is his own hang up, again IMO, and <br/>
whether they could help him or not I wouldnt know. Maybe he could read John <br/>

along, we are still deschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-808274441">Does your husband want your daughter to learn things, or does he want her to<br/>
get the job done (that is, learn to obey whoever it is whos in charge at<br/>
the moment)? Two separate things!<br/>
<br/>
If the former, ask him to read John Holts How Children Fail, which shows<br/>
how the program interferes with true intellectual development.<br/>
<br/>
If the latter, I dont know what to say. Maybe Stanley Milgrams Obedience<br/>
to Authority, which describes the horrifying results of experiments used to<br/>
see how far people will go in obeying, would help him start to question this<br/>
goal. But its a major change in thinking. Its hard to change anybodys<br/>
thinking on something so profound.<br/>
<br/>
You dont say how old your daughter is, so I dont know whether it might<br/>
help to enlist her in calming her dads fears. It could be a kind of secret<br/>
trick, something to whisper with her about. My husband suggested something<br/>
like this for a friend of ours whose husband is worried that their kids,<br/>
homeschooling for the second year after having been schooled, arent<br/>
learning enough. My husband said, Okay, so you take a childrens<br/>
encyclopedia like the Dorling Kindersley ones, and every day each kid finds<br/>
one thing in it to impress their father with when he gets home from work.<br/>
One single fact, like, You know what they do with guinea pigs in Peru? They<br/>
eat them! Or, Do you know how many times your blood vessels could go<br/>
between the Earth and the moon if they were all straightened out? (Im<br/>
making this one up.) This is trivia, but it might reassure the guy. If your<br/>
daughter could see it as a game (Impress Daddy, or Stump Daddy) - or even as<br/>
a dumb chore for helping out her poor father who was damaged by being in<br/>
school for too long - she might go along with it, as a stop-gap measure<br/>
until her own interests take over and she really does want to tell him<br/>
stuff. Its a pity to have to do this sort of thing, but maybe its still<br/>
better than school.<br/>
<br/>
Theres the age question, again, but vets offices, zoos, etc., are great<br/>
places to volunteer.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned science kits you can have sent to you monthly in the mail.<br/>
When I was a kid we were subscribed to Things Of Science  dont know<br/>
whether it still exists.<br/>
<br/>
Why youd want to ruin anything as engrossing and omnipresent as health,<br/>
nature and science with workbooks is beyond me. For real books, you might<br/>
have a look at the F.U.N. Books website. Thats the company that bought out<br/>
the Holt Associates (Growing Without Schooling) book business. Holt<br/>
Associates used to sell good nature and science books  Im thinking of the<br/>
Brown Paper Bag Series, for one  so there might still be a good selection<br/>
there. There were some coloring books on subjects like human anatomy at one<br/>
time, too. Theyre used in college courses, but some kids like them. (This<br/>
is about as workbooky as Im willing to get.) You can access F.U.N. through<br/>
the Holt Assoc. website at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com">http://www.holtgws.com</a> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.holtgws.com/">http://www.holtgws.com/</a>&gt;<br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
I have found enormous numbers of great science books at library sales (real<br/>
books, though  not textbooks or workbooks). It sounds like cost is a<br/>
consideration for you. I get books for 25 to 50 cents a piece at these<br/>
sales. You might have to be in a city, though, to find sales like these.<br/>
<br/>
Magazines for younger kids: Ranger Rick, Cricket, National Geographic World<br/>
(dont know whether thats still published). Sometimes they have puzzles in<br/>
them that might satisfy your husband somewhat. Ask a librarian. Sometimes<br/>
theyll subscribe to a mag on request, so that you can borrow it.<br/>
<br/>
Get some good field guides and go identify trees and beetles!<br/>

the way through my e-mails. If I &quot;hear&quot; you correctly, you are saying <br/>
that Clonlara might be able to help the Dad who feels the need for <br/>
textbooks and documentation? I can see that as they would <br/>
apply &quot;credit&quot; for the work and give it the &quot;authority&quot; he seems to <br/>
need. And in the meantime, Mom can still feel that she is following a <br/>
more relaxed atmosphere while getting  back up from an &quot;authority&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Having such a supportive, relaxed husband is such a blessing.... I&#39;ll <br/>
have to remember to thank mine.<br/>
<br/>
in peace,<br/>

Take care, Jacli <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763104468">Hey all, Jacli here :)<br/>
Just wanted to thankyou for the comments.  <br/>
I have to say I have been more than a <br/>
little frustrated with hubby dearest&#39; insistence on<br/>
textbooks.<br/>
Some days he really gets what we&#39;re doing and then...Then<br/>
he&#39;ll come home<br/>
and announce that he is really ,really worried about dd and<br/>
<br/>
why isn&#39;t she at the same level as he was at that age?  Or<br/>
why isn&#39;t<br/>
she doing algebra?  Or when are we gonna stop all this<br/>
touchy feely stuff and<br/>
do some real school work? ... Stuff like that.  <br/>
On one hand I KNOW that he has experienced only public and<br/>
ivy league stuff and hasn&#39;t <br/>
had the benefit of mixed experiences like I did.  At the<br/>
same time I FEEL that he should<br/>
know better anyway - I mean if he was miserable then why<br/>
would he expect that she would go to school and be<br/>
ecstatic?  He was forced to use textbooks and so forth and<br/>
he knows the truth of what you can actually get out of them<br/>
(not much) so why force that on her?  !!!<br/>
<br/>
At the same time I KNOW he knows that she is one smart<br/>
cookie and is soo much more advanced than the average<br/>
conventionally schooled child, in so many ways.  She didn&#39;t<br/>
start reading until 2 years ago but she is already reading<br/>
at 10th grade level now, for instance.  Reading and<br/>
comprehending.  She is a bright, articulate, polite and<br/>
well adjusted little girl, who may not have the easiest<br/>
time with fractions or multiplication tables but can hold<br/>
her own discussing finance and free trade with anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel like hey, she&#39;ll get around to that other stuff when<br/>
its time for her to and it is not fair or even decent to<br/>
push and shove her with the usual methods.  At the same<br/>
time<br/>
he really does pay the lion share for her school work and<br/>
he IS her father so I feel like I owe it to him to respect<br/>
his feelings and input.  I guess I&#39;m fairly conflicted, eh?<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway I just wanted to say thankyou to everybody that<br/>
answered my plea and also say Keep it Coming! <br/>
Ooh - I recently signed up for the Discovery Channel book<br/>
club (following up on a hint from Dan) which has some<br/>
really great (albeit EXPEN$IVE) stuff.  If anyone wants<br/>
details just let me know.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks Jacli :)<br/>
