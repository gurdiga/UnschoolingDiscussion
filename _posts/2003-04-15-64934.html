Yesterday I said my kids enjoyed believing in the magic of Santa if only for <br/>
a &quot;day&quot; which to me was clear it wasn&#39;t something that was a REAL belief.<br/>
<br/>
Then yesterday I post about the zoombinis and say this: &quot; I bought the <br/>
zoombini games, I played them myself, she saw them and she <br/>
began <br/>
to play along.Â  So she enjoyed that for a bit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then I get the above response that I should play the zoombinis myself, it <br/>
would make it seem more valuable and interesting to my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I struggle with whether I am &quot;clear&quot; about what I post but I really thought <br/>
that one was clear.  Am I not being specific enough or are posts not being <br/>
read entirely?<br/>

Have you not also read here that many people pay no attention to *who* is<br/>
writing the posts?   Sandra, especially, has been really clear about that.<br/>
She just responds to *that* post, not the person.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to stress about it all so much.  Just pay attention to your kids.<br/>
When you&#39;re out, if you see something one of them might like, get it.  Leave<br/>
it around or use it yourself.  Maybe spend more time on your own interests,<br/>
offering to include any kids who show an interest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just asking if I were being clear or my posts were somehow garbled.  I <br/>
stated in the opening line that I played the game, she saw me, joined in and <br/>
thought it was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Then someone replied for ME to play the game, let her see my play it.  It <br/>
made me think something wasn&#39;t reading the way I wrote it.<br/>
<br/>
Someone replied and said they read the post too fast and missed the first <br/>
part of me saying I bought them and I played them.<br/>
<br/>
That response had nothing to do with who answered my posts or who didn&#39;t.  It <br/>
was merely a question to see if my post indeed was complete and clear or if <br/>
there was a problem with it.<br/>
<br/>
Wondering if you posts are not coming through correctly has nothing to do <br/>
with WHO responded.  I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m getting the point you were trying to <br/>
make anyway.<br/>

Your posts are not always clear. More often than not I have to reread them<br/>
to understand you. I think if you proof read and maybe made them  shorter<br/>
you might find people respond differently.<br/>
