<div id="ygrps-yiv-826682528">michelle,<br/>
i have a four year old boy too, and i can hear him saying the same type of <br/>
thing when he is dissatisfied.  he has just moved into a new growth phase and <br/>
almost suddenly is requiring a new level of stimulation.  its as if his mind <br/>
roams until it hits upon something and then he is happy and busy until he is <br/>
ready to do the next thing.  to help out, i recently got some new art <br/>
supplies, playdough, little scissors, crayons, glue stick, etc.  just so he <br/>
could have some resources to turn to, otherwise he would ask to watch tv or <br/>
play on the computer all day.  plus, i put him to work.  (sorting the <br/>
recycling, emptying dw, scrubbing off something, delivering things to where <br/>
they go in the house, etc.)  before this recent change in him, he would amuse <br/>
himself for long periods playing with his trucks and tractors or whatever.  <br/>
now he just is looking for more.  anyway, all this to say that his comments <br/>
may be just a reflection (like you said) of him looking for a bit more, and <br/>
you can address that-- add some new activities, etc without attatching the <br/>
school issue perhaps.  although it would be fun when he is in a good mood to <br/>
listen to him tell you what school might be like.  or to make up stories <br/>
about it, fantasize what he would like it to be etc....<br/>
