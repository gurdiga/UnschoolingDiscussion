<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327495618">Hi Myranda,<br/>
<br/>
Your son&#39;s eye problems sound alot like mine.  I had surgery on my eye when I<br/>
was 9 maybe 10.  My left eye was crossed.  It stared at my nose.  The surgery<br/>
I had centered my eye.  The surgeon also did some experimental surgery on my<br/>
pupil or something to try and correct my vision (If people look really closely<br/>
at my eye they can see the ways the pupil was cut up).  I saw that surgery on<br/>
TLC quite a few years ago (though I think it was improved). I also had the eye<br/>
glasses and eye patch therapy to strenghthen the straightened eye.  After<br/>
about a year of therapy the doctor told my parents that the eye wasn&#39;t getting<br/>
any stronger and told me I could be rid of the eye patch and glasses. <br/>
Fortunately my right eye has perfectly good vision.  I&#39;m 29 now and the left<br/>
eye is still centered.  I can see out of the left eye well enough to walk<br/>
without bumping into things but not well enough to drive or read.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think the surgery to strenghthen the muscles of the eye will do any harm just<br/>
don&#39;t let them cut his pupil up :)<br/>
