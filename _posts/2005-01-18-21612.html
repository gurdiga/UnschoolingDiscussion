 </span></blockquote>Back when I was handsetting headline type, I could identify about 500<br/>
typefaces, some with as little information as a comma; there were some I<br/>
could even recognize by a period.  I think that must come under the &quot;nature&quot;<br/>
intelligence, as it involves recognizing and categorizing shapes.<br/>
<br/>
I read one of the links about this kind of intelligence, and it occured to<br/>
me that possessing it would make a person a successful human in a<br/>
prehistoric culture -- that those abilities would be basic to survival.<br/>
There were hundreds of thousands of years when humans had no need of reading<br/>
or higher math or much in the way of language, but certainly needed to<br/>
identify what was good to eat, or which animal could eat them.<br/>

OOOH! I was at the bank this morning. A man in front of me made a deposit  <br/>
that included and counterfeit $20! It was sooo cool! I asked the teller how she  <br/>
knew, what to look for, what she does next, etc. I was glad to have been  <br/>
inside rather than the drive-through today!<br/>

**Rowan I went shopping last week and my debit card wouldn&#39;t go through.<br/>
The cashier and manager couldn&#39;t figure out why - something on the bank&#39;s<br/>
end - so I told them I&#39;d go get some money and come back.  When I paid them<br/>
with a hundred dollar bill the same manager came over to check it out.  I<br/>
thought that was cool and said something like, &quot;How can you tell? Can we<br/>
watch?&quot; and the two women looked at each other and me funny and then acted<br/>
relieved that it wasn&#39;t fake.  I guess being interested can be very<br/>
suspicious &lt;g&gt;.  ~Rue<br/>

DARN!  Kirby&#39;s not home or I would ask him. They check twenties where  he <br/>
works.  For the new bills, there&#39;s a marker they run over it and if it&#39;s  a good <br/>
one the mark disappears (???) and if not, not.<br/>
 <br/>
I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068865177">I had a fake $100 at Costco one day, the cashier noticed that it was slightly off color.  Bank Of America gave it to me, I remember that it was a new pack of bills and it was the one on top.  I&#39;m almost certain know that THEY knew it was a fake and passed it off onto me.  My guess is that a teller goofed by accepting it and it was put front and center to go back into circulation.  I was out the $100.<br/>
<br/>
Costco called the treasury department to check the serial number, it&#39;s the only sure way to tell.  Some counterfeits can pass the marker test, I learned that from my little experience.  I never take anything larger than $20 in cash from the bank anymore.<br/>
