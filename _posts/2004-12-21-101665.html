<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773993735">Hello great wise ones!<br/>
<br/>
This is not at all an unschooling question, but I know this is the best <br/>
place to get the (child friendly, respectful) ideas I need to handle a <br/>
situation that may occur on Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
We are having a holiday party, and I invited a family that my husband <br/>
doesn&#39;t want in our house (didn&#39;t know that at the time).  Well, of <br/>
course, they are coming!  They have three children, mom is home with <br/>
them all the time and often seems to be out of her element.  My dh has <br/>
noticed that when they are at a party (the two neighborhood, outdoor <br/>
parties we&#39;ve had), nobody watches the kids.  It looks to me that the <br/>
mom just wants a break from being solely responsible for the kids, and <br/>
her dh seems to be totally clueless that she isn&#39;t watching them.  The <br/>
mom will make comments to her dh, but not actually ask him to help <br/>
directly.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, their oldest is just five and at the parties we&#39;ve had outside <br/>
just wanders around stomping on plants, pulling large parts of plants <br/>
up, dismantling lights, hitting other children, taking things from <br/>
others, etc.  This absolutely drives my dh crazy, and he is afraid that <br/>
this little boy will wander around our house tearing things up.<br/>
<br/>
What can I do (other than spend the entire party with this child)?  Are <br/>
there some things I can do to help this child feel comfortable?  Is <br/>
there something brilliant I can say to the parents?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest babysits for this family, and I hope they are not expecting <br/>
her to be responsible for their children during our party - my daughter <br/>
will have her own friends attending and I don&#39;t feel it fair to ask her <br/>
to get involved in this.  I, of course, will have hosting duties and <br/>
want to make sure that everything goes smoothly without spending all my <br/>
time with this one situation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been to parties where that is done.  All the children are  introduced to <br/>
the &quot;teen in charge&quot; and if they need drinks or help with food or  whatever, <br/>
they teen helps them out.<br/>
 <br/>
It was sort of like dropping the children off so the adults could  relax.  <br/>
They had the children in the family room downstairs with lots of  activities and <br/>
their own foods and basically their own little party.  I  think there were <br/>
two teen girls supervising and the parents of the kids all  ended up &quot;tipping&quot; <br/>
the girls for being so good with their kids and letting the  adults be free to <br/>
socialize with each other but have the children nearby.<br/>
 <br/>
the girls ended up with some pretty good spending money too.  I guess  that <br/>
was just an extra and the hostess did not suggest it, another parent did  and <br/>
more followed the idea with a tip.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-910048525">I could see a babysitter helping with normal situations, but I wonder <br/>
how much it would be with kids who are running around destroying <br/>
things with their parents present. Would they get upset that someone <br/>
else was telling their kids to stop? Something similar happened <br/>
around here...girl throwing rocks at a car and wouldn&#39;t stop, so the <br/>
owner of the car ended up raising his voice and the parents were <br/>
horrified about it. No, not about the fact that their dd was throwing <br/>
rocks...<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;d probably go to the parents after the first incident and <br/>
say something along the lines of &quot;Oh, I&#39;m sure you want to take care <br/>
of this yourself: Johnny just did such and such and I know you don&#39;t <br/>
want that going on. I&#39;ll let you talk to him and keep him from having <br/>
more problems.&quot; And then the next time &quot;What happened with Johnny? It <br/>
seems like he really needs your help. Everyone is taking care of <br/>
their own kids since my daughter is with her friends.&quot; Etc.  <br/>
