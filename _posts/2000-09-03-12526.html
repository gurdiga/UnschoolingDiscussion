<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032441228">Hi Cindy,<br/>
Welcome!  I have a friend who lives in O&#39;Fallon MO and the rest of my family <br/>
lives in various parts of MO (Central, West and a few South).  I am a <br/>
transplant to Florida now and have been here many years.....<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you, even though we &quot;go down that road again&quot; each time I take <br/>
the journey I learn more and think more about life, children and <br/>
parenting....Thanks everyone!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Julie:  I so agree... It sent me off to Barnes and Noble yesterday <br/>
afternoon for 3 hours (thankfully alone, while hubby played with the <br/>
kids) to do some research on discipline.  Decided against the Love <br/>
and Logic Book as it does include Spanking (as a final resort)... But <br/>
found tons of other books that I sat on the floor and read bits of... <br/>
Then I realized I had the books at home, the ones I really wanted by <br/>
Adele Fabler &quot;How to Talk So Kids Will Listen&quot; and the other 2 she <br/>
and her co-hort wrote... So I came home and started reading them <br/>
again last night.. .What a productive afternoon and evening from <br/>
reading posts on unschoolingdot.com.... There I was being an <br/>
unschooler myself (LOL).<br/>

included -- who employs Love and Logic and spanks, too, even as as a last <br/>
resort.  I haven&#39;t found it necessary, and I wouldn&#39;t do it anyway.<br/>
