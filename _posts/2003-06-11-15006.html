<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645706622">Hey all!  I&#39;m hoping to get some ideas here to help me out with some <br/>
issues with Andy, our 7yo.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been back and forth on the TV issue for most of my Mom years. I <br/>
tend to want to allow them to watch TV when they want, but with a <br/>
secret hope they&#39;ll actually watch much less than they do.  Both Will <br/>
(now grown) and Andy are HUGE TV watchers, where Dan (only 2) is the <br/>
only one who actually turns it off -- ever!<br/>
<br/>
Andy has always been a special kid -- he&#39;s larger than life in many <br/>
ways, very energetic, very sweet, with some really weird food issues <br/>
(tactile defensive stuff, I think) a big imagination, and an <br/>
amazingly obsessive focus and enthusiasm for his interests.  He&#39;s <br/>
also always been a worrier, for lack of a better word.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, he&#39;s developed some real anxiety issues -- can&#39;t stand to <br/>
be alone in a room, even in daylight; wants someone to walk him even <br/>
to the bathroom; won&#39;t go to sleep alone (a skill he&#39;d only recently <br/>
acquired anyway); is calling out several times some nights, with bad <br/>
dreams; and whining a lot; he desperately wanted me to hold his hand <br/>
as we walked down the hall to bed tonight (which I did).  Not a sweet <br/>
hand-holding thing, but out and out frantic anxiety!  Maybe the <br/>
regression is about his oldest brother leaving home -- but that was 2 <br/>
months ago, and they didn&#39;t even get along all that well anyway <br/>
(they&#39;re very different types of people) -- I&#39;d think that by now, <br/>
he&#39;d have adjusted.<br/>
<br/>
Just the last few days, he&#39;s begun telling me he&#39;s afraid of <br/>
characters with names like he hears on Pokemon cartoons. It started <br/>
me thinking... in the past couple of months, his TV viewing is way up <br/>
(we lifted all limits in March) and he&#39;s watching a lot of anime <br/>
style cartoons.  I wonder if this could be causing his anxiety? Not <br/>
so much in a scary character way, but in some kind of input <br/>
processing way?  Given his tactile issues -- not just about food, <br/>
he&#39;s also very high-need to be touched/snuggled, has to play with my <br/>
hair whenever he can, just never seems to get enough physical <br/>
contact -- I&#39;ve begun to think he may have some sensory integration <br/>
issues, and wondered if this could also be responsible for his <br/>
obsessive tendencies (yes, he&#39;s also more than a little obsessive).  <br/>
Until now, we&#39;ve just dismissed his quirks as just &quot;Andy&quot; done our <br/>
best to help him work thru his issues and trusted he&#39;d get thru <br/>
things just fine.  Now I&#39;m starting to wonder how we can help him.<br/>
<br/>
Could it be that anime, specifically, might be a problem for him?  I <br/>
told him tonight that it seems to me that the more TV he watches -- <br/>
especially anime -- the more anxious he is overall.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
talking about his anxiety/fears in the last week or two, to sort of <br/>
brainstorm ideas and solutions to help him.  I suggested he cut back <br/>
to only a couple hours of TV a day, and against my better judgment <br/>
agreed to allow two anime shows -- Pokemon & Digimon -- only because <br/>
he acted like I&#39;d cut his heart out at the very idea of not allowing <br/>
anime!  <br/>
<br/>
I reminded him that we&#39;ll be leaving for Hawaii soon, where there&#39;s <br/>
no cable TV and he might not even be able to get Pokemon (grandma & <br/>
grandpa have only the Big 3 and PBS, with somewhat spotty reception) <br/>
so maybe now would be a good time to start cutting back to prepare <br/>
for the loss of TV in Hawaii. He countered that it&#39;s more fun in <br/>
Hawaii, it&#39;s no fun here in Albuquerque and that&#39;s why he has to have <br/>
more TV!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what to do for him..... but it breaks my heart to see <br/>
him so anxious, not to mention how very tired I am of walking him to <br/>
the bathroom and having him shadow me all the time.  Right now, <br/>
Daniel at 2yo is more comfortable away from me than Andy!  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas or help?<br/>

<br/>
Marty used to have night panics.  He would sleepwalk, and if people touched <br/>
him he would start to just flap his hands to bat us away and whimper.   Or if <br/>
he woke up in the bed he would be saying &quot;Mom, MOM! MOM!&quot; but he didn&#39;t like to <br/>
be held, and he wasn&#39;t really awake.<br/>
<br/>
The latest sleepwalking I know of was when he was 10 or 11.  <br/>
<br/>
He said last year that he finally figured out it only happened on days when <br/>
he hadn&#39;t eaten much or well, and if he paid attention to eating protein it <br/>
quit happening.  There were kinds of audio and visual distortions.  Not a full-on <br/>
hallucination of seeing something that wasn&#39;t there, but weird perception.  <br/>
Interestingly I knew years back that Holly and Kirby got grumpy without protein <br/>
but Marty didn&#39;t.  Seems &quot;grumpy&quot; just wasn&#39;t his symptom.   When I was a <br/>
teenager, in high school and college, I had had those distortions Marty has <br/>
described, but in college they said &quot;hypoglycemia&quot; and I started consciously eating <br/>
protein (even between meals like taking medicine, I&#39;ll sometimes get a bite <br/>
of cheese, grab a handful of nuts, or eat a boiled egg) and it never happened <br/>
anymore.<br/>

<br/>
Could be the just-weird-brain-feeling thing Marty talks about, *possibly.*<br/>
<br/>
Eating more protein doesn&#39;t cost much time or money.  It&#39;s worth a try.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any ideas or help?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you know Joy, in Rio Rancho, whose son Michael is Asperger&#39;s syndrome?  <br/>
He&#39;s 18 now, employed, doing great.  I&#39;m not thinking of her last name.  Her <br/>
daughter is Kenna.  Have you considered it could be Asperger&#39;s?  If so, I don&#39;t <br/>
think limiting TV is going to change anything.  If he&#39;s feeling anxious, I&#39;d <br/>
let him have whatever comfort he wants.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558134284">First a quick intro. We&#39;re a life learning family in Wellington, New Zealand<br/>

Sylvia - Reading your post Asperger Syndrome sprung to mind. We have a<br/>
daughter we think as a young lady with AS - Carrie. She has food issues<br/>
(sensitivities), and many other &#39;intersting&#39; facets to her personality. She<br/>
obsesses about different things, is touchy-feely (less so than she used to<br/>
be -used to be great fun in shops!) I do find that Carrie will become<br/>
over-stimulated with TV sometimes. She seems to be learning to self-limit<br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d encourage you to do some reading about Aspergers - which is on the<br/>
autism spectrum. There are several sites on the internet and some good<br/>
books. One of the most encouraging books I have read is called &#39;Son-rise:<br/>
the miracle continues&#39; by Barry Kaufman. It is that story of a family whose<br/>
son displayed severely autistic behaviour and they developed their own way<br/>
of working with him against the trends of the day which were and still<br/>
largely are based on behaviour modification. Basically they accepted his<br/>
behaviour and allowed him to be himself.<br/>
We try to do this with our daughter as well as helping her learn to consider<br/>
the needs of other family members or folk in general. A balancing act!<br/>

Not really -- either dh or I am with both boys really 24/7. Occasionally, he visits a good friend of mine to hang out with her kids, and I&#39;m sure there&#39;s no trauma happening there.    But I know what you mean. My sister was sexually molested at age 10, and we didn&#39;t find out about it for 9+ years!  Now we understand why she was the most neurotic child on the planet -- thumbsucking, hairtwisting, nailbiting and so on continued well into her teens and even twenties!  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for thought, tho! I did get some great advice and a wonderful reply from Anne O, so I hope I&#39;m on the right track to figuring out how to help Andy!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1379357936">Hello!  I am a lurker-sorry for jumping in prior to my intro.  ;-)<br/>
 <br/>
I was thinking a simple anxiety disorder as I read this post (simple,<br/>
yes, but very painful for sure!).  Perhaps an evaluation by a counselor<br/>
experienced with childhood anxiety disorders could be a wonderful place<br/>
to start?  The key here is EXPERIENCED with CHILDHOOD anxiety issues.  A<br/>
few calls should turn someone up. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493858361">Hi,<br/>
Welcome to the list. I believe that my neighbor has AS. He has absolutely no social skills. He often tags along w/ us (Janis - mom & Brianna 10.5 y.o.)because he has no one but us and frankly, I feel bad. However it&#39;s becoming apparent that he feels that he can be with us all the time. I&#39;ve tried to tell him that Brianna & I need time & space away from him - to no avail.<br/>
I&#39;ve been severely embarrassed by some of the things he does. Sometimes his smell is so awful; he interrupts people; he sometimes talks in the third person and as a baby as in &quot;Robbie tired. Robbie go to bed&quot; while he does this huge stretch and then stares at people w/ a goofy grin. He&#39;s offended many people at the powwows. He has a hair fetish and has asked total strangers (women) if he can play w/ their hair for &quot;an hour or two&quot;<br/>
His home is a health hazard - food everywhere - you have to step up & over trash, dirty clothes, old food.<br/>
A woman I know who&#39;s son has been diagnosed with AS has been telling me that this man has it.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you more, but I need to know how to get through to him w/o hurting his feelings. <br/>
How can I make it so he isn&#39;t standing there pleading w/ us to come w/ us?<br/>
He&#39;s 43 and has a great job. <br/>
He also looks very strange. <br/>
He dyes his very long, straw-like hair a dead black....<br/>
any suggestions??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217587765">***Recently, he&#39;s developed some real anxiety issues -- ***<br/>
<br/>
Before I started worrying about disorders and such, I&#39;d just give it<br/>
time.<br/>
My son went through a similar anxious period at about this age.  He<br/>
didn&#39;t want draperies left open after dark, he didn&#39;t want to be alone in<br/>
a room with an open window.  He didn&#39;t want to be in his bedroom by<br/>
himself.   He found certain noises disturbing and static snow on TV<br/>
really scared him.<br/>
<br/>
We just offered him whatever comfort and help and support he was asking<br/>
for, reminded him often that he was safe and gave it time.   He still<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to go into the basement by himself - it&#39;s a cellar, really,<br/>
and he&#39;d rather have the draperies closed after dark, but he&#39;s not<br/>
anxious about it.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s eleven now and he says his only real fear is that I will stay on the<br/>
trampoline all day and not make dinner. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think a desire to understand these things makes us look for a cause, a<br/>
disorder of some sort, and what it might be is a kid just coming to<br/>
realize he&#39;s an individual in the world, separate from his parents and<br/>
susceptible to lurking dangers.  Most kids get past it, the ones who<br/>
don&#39;t grow up to be my little Jewish mother. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I remember toddlers going through phases of being afraid of slides, then not, <br/>
then afraid again,then not. It seemed as normal as some other patterns, like <br/>
kids using grammar rules &quot;wrong&quot; by trying to apply regular-verb rules to the <br/>
irregular verbs they&#39;ve been using correctly for years.  It&#39;s like another <br/>
normal level of awareness and development.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight Marty and I went to a banjo lesson.  I brought him home, let him out <br/>
and went to Kinko&#39;s for just under ten minutes.  When I got back, Holly came <br/>
running around from the side yard, with a portable phone.  <br/>
<br/>
She had called a friend of ours, same friend she called last time she got <br/>
spooked, and told her someone slammed the front door and turned on the TV, but no <br/>
car was here.<br/>
<br/>
She handed me the phone, I reassured Lisa, apologized, thanked her, and told <br/>
Holly &quot;I can&#39;t leave  you alone anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That upset Holly because she didn&#39;t want to go with us, could have gone with <br/>
Keith to pick Kirby up, but she chose not to.<br/>
<br/>
I hugged her and told her bad guys wouldn&#39;t slam the door and turn on the TV. <br/>
 I asked her to remember to trust the dog.  &quot;Was Gudrun scared?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for her.  And I asked Marty next time he comes in alone to <br/>
announce himself.<br/>
<br/>
She has not always been so skittish.  She won&#39;t always be, either.  I think <br/>
she&#39;s going through a phase of thoughts and fears and this is how she&#39;s dealing <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
There were neighbors home she could have gone to had it been a true emergency <br/>
and not just spookiness.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Poor Holly.  Kass and Kree recently watched the movie &quot;Darkness Falls&quot; about <br/>
the evil tooth fairy who kills anyone who actually looks at her. They have <br/>
always loved scary movies. They couldn&#39;t wait to see this one. We watched it at <br/>
our next door neighbor&#39;s house and when we got home they were petrified. At <br/>
first I thought they were being funny and joking around. They asked if they could <br/>
sleep in our room, which they do all the time without asking, but I think <br/>
they wanted reassurance that daddy was gonna sleep close enough to get anyone who <br/>
threatened his babies. Phil, DH, was shocked too. He also thought they were <br/>
pulling our legs. They laid down and went in to this long discussion about not <br/>
wanting to lose their last tooth. Which happened to be loose in both of their <br/>
mouths. Phil and I giggled as we settled into bed. Sparky, our dog, sat up <br/>
quickly, hearing another neighbors Hummer drive up and the girls went balistic. I <br/>
mean they screamed the kind of scream that makes your blood go cold. Phil <br/>
jumped out of bed and said &quot;What the F**k?&quot; I on the other hand was ROBLMAO. I <br/>
said, &quot;Kevin just got home!&quot; So although he hadn&#39;t been scared by the movie, he <br/>
had been by the shreek of our daughters screams. When they all realized what I <br/>
had said, the girls started to cry and Phil was just a little ticked at his <br/>
own instincts. All I could do is crack up. In the end, they were all mad at me, <br/>
so I got up to watch TV in the family room. Still laughing, I grabbed a <br/>
blanket, and as I headed for the hallway with Sparky in tow, the girls screamed <br/>
again!!! &quot;Don&#39;t go out there alone mommy!&quot; I literally fell to the ground dying <br/>
with laughter. I am not a scary movie watcher, so the fact that these three <br/>
scary movie addicts had frightened themselves to such a degree, was just more <br/>
than I could take. I came back to bed and took another half an hour to stop <br/>
laughing.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say they lost that last tooth, but forgot all about the movie <br/>
when the fairy had left them $5. How quickly their fears disapate when $$$ is <br/>
involved.LOL<br/>

Tonite we watched 2 episodes of the O&#39;Keefe&#39;s, in fact it&#39;s only 10 minutes <br/>
into the second episode and I&#39;m cracking up. Maybe I&#39;m just in a residual <br/>
laughing mode remembering the scary movie thing, but this family is a total crack <br/>
up. I know there was a big upheaval by several HS&#39;ing groups over it, but it&#39;s <br/>
so funny. When the dad used his thumbs up sign and shook it to mean maybe, I <br/>
fell apart. It seems to me the show is actually more about all that is wrong <br/>
with school and how much more these kids are actually prepared for in life,  <br/>
than the eclectic family they are supposed to be. While they are in school, they <br/>
seem to be teaching everyone else, including the teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents.<br/>
