<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623645240">We built one this afternoon!  It&#39;s sitting in the middle of the living<br/>
room, my husband is lying inside it either sound asleep or listening to<br/>
Harry Potter on audio (I can&#39;t tell from here).  The kids are crawling<br/>
in and out of it asking how long we can leave it up.<br/>
<br/>
Building it was frustrating, sweaty, and took longer than we had<br/>
anticipated.  But it was worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the links.  We had a ball.<br/>

Thanks for letting me know how it went. We have ours hopefully planned <br/>
sometime this week. So you used tape instead of staples? I never built one <br/>
before. One more question, did you use just one sheet of paper for each tube <br/>
or 4 like one other web site suggested?<br/>

We used staples initially, but after a while the paper got too thick and<br/>
the staples weren&#39;t going all the was through the paper, so tape was a<br/>
must.<br/>
We used two sheets of newspaper per tube, although four might be better,<br/>
maybe next time - one is not going to be strong enough.<br/>
Ours is still up, we are walking around it and crawling through it.  It<br/>
has already had many visitors and generated a lot of discussion (esp. by<br/>
my dad who was a friend of Bucky Fuller&#39;s).<br/>
