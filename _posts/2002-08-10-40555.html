I would say don&#39;t buy it.<br/>
<br/>
If that seems stupid to you and you&#39;re determined to buy one, call used <br/>
bookstores in your area (maybe one deals with/specializes in educational <br/>
stuff, and you can ask in any you call whether they know who might most <br/>
likely have it), or check with google.com for used copies online.<br/>
<br/>
Third recommendation is after you&#39;ve checked, don&#39;t buy it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YIKES! is right. Believe me when I tell you it is NOT worth the money and <br/>
Brittany does NOT need it to learn to read.  Those commercials make their <br/>
program sound so fun and easy, but really it&#39;s just tedium in a box. My <br/>
Casey got sucked in by those commercials once and asked me to get her that <br/>
program. We borrowed it from the library. She was bored in one day. She was <br/>
NOT however bored with learning to read. Just the simplistic phonics only <br/>
approach that this system was using.<br/>
<br/>
We had much more fun and lots of success using a playful, relaxed and varied <br/>
approach. Everything in that expensive phonics program can be found much <br/>
better in real life. There are books from the library, blocks, magnetic <br/>
letters, workbooks from the grocery (for playing, NOT enforcing of course), <br/>
games like Scrabble and Boggle, computer games, magazines, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest your local library as one of the best resources around. If <br/>
you feel a need to brush up on those phonics rules for yourself (so you can <br/>
help Brittany), there are tons of books on the subject. And all for free!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, look at it this way. The ads make it look like it&#39;s fun for the kids.<br/>
And it might be. But how much are you willing to spend on a fun way to do<br/>
something that will happen naturally for free? How much would you have paid<br/>
for a fun program to help her to walk?<br/>
<br/>
I think I ended up paying about $5. $20 for the 100 Easy Lessons which I<br/>
sold last year for about $15. (And it didn&#39;t work either because my daughter<br/>
had 0 interest.)<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re really buying is:<br/>
<br/>
1) a sense of peace that she&#39;ll learn to read. This is preying on groundless<br/>
fears. As an unschooler in an environment where reading is naturally fun and<br/>
useful she *will* learn to read. It may be tomorrow. It may be 6 years from<br/>
now. (Unless you put her in school where life isn&#39;t natural and there are<br/>
major road blocks to learning to read. (Like expecting her to do something<br/>
she isn&#39;t developmentally ready for yet.) So for parents with kids in school<br/>
the fears aren&#39;t quite so groundless.)<br/>
<br/>
2) *Maybe* early reading. Maybe. Though I&#39;d be more inclined to believe the<br/>
kids who read early with phonics programs are the ones who would have read<br/>
early to begin with. And though being able to read before school starts gets<br/>
cheered, what does it really mean? No one can tell the difference between an<br/>
adult who read at 3 and an adult who read at 7. (I&#39;d extend that to 13 for<br/>
an unschooler but a later reader in school might be demoralized by the<br/>
intervention and end up not liking to read or be convinced he can&#39;t. Sandra<br/>
has been collecting stories of later readers at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a> I think the most important thing to realize in<br/>
terms of calming fears is that a 13 yo new reader is *not* 7 years behind.<br/>
They&#39;ll be indistinguishable from their peers pretty quickly.) Learning<br/>
through reading is *different* not better than learning by doing or learning<br/>
by watching. Unless you&#39;re in school where learning is *only* avialble<br/>
through reading and listening. Then otherwise endowed kids are severly<br/>
handicapped. That doesn&#39;t need to be true at home. We can adapt the<br/>
environment to the kid rather than the kid to the environment.<br/>
<br/>
If you still think you&#39;d like it, first check your library or through<br/>
interlibrary loan. Just ask your librarian to search. That should be free.<br/>
(Or a nominal fee. I think one library in our system charges a quarter for<br/>
each request.) Even if they don&#39;t have a regular system in place, most<br/>
libraries will call around and try to locate what you want.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.half.com">http://www.half.com</a> You&#39;ll need to read and ask questions<br/>
of the sellers and perhaps search the internet to figure out what you&#39;re<br/>
getting since some of the sets are a few years old. (And to make sure the<br/>
seller has listed his item under the correct heading!)<br/>
<br/>
If you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.addall.com">http://www.addall.com</a> it will search 20 or so used book sites<br/>
(including half.com). It will be very helpful if you have the ISBN of the<br/>
one or ones you want since there&#39;s 15 of them and they&#39;re not listed by<br/>
publication date. <br/>
<br/>
The full price one does have a 60 day money back guarantee. Not on the s&h<br/>
though. But *if* you get to keep the National Geographics on CD that comes<br/>
as a free gift, it might be worth it even if you never use it and just send<br/>
it back! ;-) (It&#39;s *way* not worth it if you don&#39;t send it back. You&#39;re much<br/>
better off getting it used and then reselling. You&#39;ll lose less money!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-443584636">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would introduce myself, My name is Mary and I am a <br/>
homeschooling mom of 3 1/2 kids (#4 due in Sept).  I have been lurking the <br/>
last few days and trying to keep up with the &quot;friendly&quot; banter.lol<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just thought I would put in my opinion of the hooked on phonics <br/>
program.  I bought this (at a garage sale) and tried it with my son.  He is <br/>
very music oriented so I thought he would enjoy it.  He listened to the first <br/>
tape for about ten minutes and lost interest.  We occasionally look through <br/>
the books but I don&#39;t think its worth the $300 I would have spent if I <br/>
purchased it new.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should have known when I bought it, it was still in the original <br/>
box with the receipt inside.  I doubt the original owner used it for any <br/>
amount of time as well.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hope that helps.  Will probably go back to lurking for a while,  <br/>
thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547631612">Tia and All,<br/>
I used Hooked on Phonics with all three of my kids.  They loved and learned <br/>
to read with it.  They went at their own pace and sometimes would go weeks <br/>
without using the program and then pick it up again. It was not confusing at <br/>
all and I found that it follows a logical progression of steps that make <br/>
sense to us, at least.  <br/>
<br/>
What I liked most was that it comes with books that use the words that you <br/>
have learned  and they give the kids a real feeling of accomplishment when <br/>
they read them.  We found that after the first level we didn&#39;t use the tapes <br/>
anymore, that we didn&#39;t need them.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the kind of program that you can follow very strictly or very loosely, <br/>
as long as you don&#39;t move on until the child has mastered what he learned <br/>
before.  We followed it loosely, as we are unschoolers at heart.  Other than <br/>
Hooked on Phonics we don&#39;t do the curriculum thing but we were able to use it <br/>
in our own way.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend the program, although we bought ours 4 years ago, before the <br/>
computer CD&#39;s were added.  I&#39;m not sure I would want to use the CD&#39;s but the <br/>
workbooks and story books are good. It&#39;s hard checking the program out from <br/>
the library, we tried that at first.  3 weeks isn&#39;t enough time to complete <br/>
one level, let alone the entire series. As far as the price goes it was worth <br/>
if for us because I used for all three kids and I&#39;ll probably pass it on to <br/>
another family when we are finished with it.<br/>
