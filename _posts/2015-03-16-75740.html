<br/>
This isn&#39;t about unschooling, though.  Different institutions can create their own rules and requirements.  They&#39;re not about learning, they&#39;re about hurdles that apply to anyone—people who went through the system, or dropped out, or came from another country, or didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
<br/>
She should take a GED, or find something that doesn&#39;t require one.  Don&#39;t make a bigger deal of it than it needs to be.  <br/>
<br/>
She can take the test cold, and if she passes it&#39;s done.  If she doesn&#39;t, then she&#39;ll know which section she was weak on and could study just that one.  <br/>
<br/>

I didn&#39;t see the mess part, in your account.  <br/>
