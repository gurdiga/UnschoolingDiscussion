If my link doesn&#39;t work for you, look at the end of it and compare it to see if any of it got chopped off... or just cut & paste...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking of obsessions (which I think can be another way of saying someone is REALLY interested in it): one of my sons wants a chemistry set & we&#39;ve been talking about it on & off... we have not come to any conclusions about what type to get for him, but we have looked at some vials on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.specialtybottle.com/">http://www.specialtybottle.com/</a> but Gary (his dad) didn&#39;t think the ones with corks would be suitable for chemistry... we&#39;ve been checking out books in the library (one is about science experiments you can eat: his other obsession is cooking/baking (breads, and other oddball type recipes) & someone on one of my homeschool advertisement lists just listed a bunch of science books that might be interesting... <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m open to any suggestions for things we can look at to fill this need to explore chemistry..... perhaps books or websites or kits someone liked? (One of the things we&#39;re NOT liking about some of the kits we&#39;ve seen online: the vials/containers are plastic... my son just turned his nose up at that part! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Right now my kids are having a blast with their new Lego bionicles... another mini-obsession around here... <br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
