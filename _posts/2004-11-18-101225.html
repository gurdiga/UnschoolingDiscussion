<div id="ygrps-yiv-875211663">I got this in my mail today----maybe most of y&#39;all did  too. I&#39;ve read half <br/>
of it. It&#39;s a free download, so maybe it would be of  interest. <br/>

Hello, <br/>
My name is Debbie Harbeson and I am writing to you  because I have written a <br/>
short humor book about our family&#39;s early homeschooling  experiences and want <br/>
to share it freely with other homeschoolers and anyone else  interested.  I <br/>
have it available in a pdf file from the website listed  below.  Totally free.   <br/>
This book was originally a project for my family,  but I have since decided <br/>
it would be fun to share with anyone  interested.  I consider it my <br/>
contribution to the homeschooling cause.  :)   <br/>
It has received a great response so far.  Ann Zeise  of A to Z Home&#39;s Cool <br/>
and Beverly Hernandez of About.com have  put links on their sites and so far two <br/>
magazines have contacted me  for permission to publish an excerpt.   <br/>
I hope you are intrigued enough to go check it out for  yourself and if you <br/>
like it, to pass it on to your list members.   <br/>

Thank you so much for taking time to consider whether to  pass this offer on <br/>
to your list members. <br/>
If you have any questions, feel free to email  me. <br/>
Sincerely, <br/>
Debbie  Harbeson<br/>
