&gt; especially my oldest! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  My oldest two went to school, my youngest does not.  My daughter knows how <br/>
I feel now, and somehow she never got around to sending her son to school, <br/>
either.  (He would&#39;ve been in K this year.)  <br/>
  She asked me recently, &quot;So why did I have to go to school?&quot;  I answered <br/>
quite honestly, &quot;Because I didn&#39;t know any better.&quot;  <br/>
  &quot;Really?  That&#39;s it?&quot;  <br/>
  &quot;That&#39;s it.&quot;<br/>
