&lt;&lt;  I would have loved it if somebody had offered me the <br/>
chance to study any subject I&#39;d wanted, who knows what I would have <br/>
become.  I wasn&#39;t offered that opportunity, but my kids were.  <br/>

Although they&#39;re not at Christian school now and not doing Abeka, you still <br/>
could move from where you are to really unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something that might help.  <br/>

<br/>
There are links at the bottom, and &quot;disposable checklists&quot; might help you be <br/>
more at peace with unschooling too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I haven&#39;t even ASKED him to do anything as far as school, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling shouldn&#39;t have anything to do with school.  It should be the <br/>
complete and total absence of school, schooling and schoolishness.<br/>
