<div id="ygrps-yiv-297125921">This is not a new idea, but I just &quot;remembered&quot; about it.<br/>
<br/>
I got an end roll of newsprint from the newspaper and cut a piece long<br/>
enough to go the length of our dining table.  I sit at the table and do<br/>
the lessons from Drawing With Children myself.  The kids usually want to<br/>
join in.  We leave the paper on the table for meals etc., until it gets<br/>
covered with practice art or just gets too dirty.  Then it can go in the<br/>
recycle bin and a new piece comes out.  For kids who really hate to throw<br/>
away even practice art, you could photograph it before disposal.<br/>
<br/>
This led to us doing an impromptu still life of a ketchup bottle and a<br/>
wine glass after dinner last night.  8dd ended up doing a wine glass and<br/>
wine bottle.  Her ketchup bottle was too skinny, so she made it a wine<br/>
bottle instead.  This was an idea from the book - if you make a<br/>
&quot;mistake&quot;, change your drawing into something else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-329948210">When the kidlets were younger they got interested in how the human body<br/>
works and where things are located.<br/>
<br/>
We put the leaf in the table and had them lay down and they outlined each<br/>
other and then used colored paper to cut out their &quot;parts&quot; and learned<br/>
anatomy this way.  For the longest time they called the diningroom table the<br/>
operating room table &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those rolls of paper are great for a million things!<br/>
