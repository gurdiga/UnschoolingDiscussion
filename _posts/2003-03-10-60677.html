<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015324627"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt; So then would you agree that the boy who has requested people to help<br/>
&gt; him out by calling his school to complain about him being on detention<br/>
&gt; is actually in the wrong? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pretty much, yes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He can poster his whole house.  He can put picket signs on the lawns of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>any<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; friends&#39; families that agree to have them.  But legally, he doesn&#39;t have<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; right to paper the building.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The key question is under what circumstances a student *is* allowed to put<br/>
up posters.  If he was disciplined because of the political content of his<br/>
poster, then the rule would have to be no political posters.  If students<br/>
are allowed to put up posters with political opinions, then all political<br/>
opinions should be allowed.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; IF you think he has that right, what if what a student chose to put up was<br/>
&gt; sexist, racist, dishonest, harmful, inflammatory war-mongering?   What if<br/>
&gt; what he chose to put up was scatological humor about camel jockeys?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where&#39;s<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the line?  What &quot;rights&quot; DO you want schools to have?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they don&#39;t cross the line into illegal activity, and students are allowed<br/>
to put up political posters, then the boy should have the same right, even<br/>
if the principal disagrees with his politics.<br/>
