<div id="ygrps-yiv-846264022">On Sunday we were all out and about, getting new sneakers for the kids and such. Joe wanted to stop by Barnes and Noble and well the kids had a field day in there. No book for Joe but all 3 little ones sure stocked up. We have been reading chapter books like Goosebumps and Boxcar Children and such. Joseph and Sierra really like them and I always read them to both. At the store, Joseph asked if he could get this Bionicle book he found. He told me he wanted to read it by himself. He&#39;s been reading comic books and small story books and magazines but never a chapter book. Well he&#39;s almost finished and even read it in the car on the way to a friends today! He&#39;s already talking about getting more. It&#39;s so nice to see, he&#39;s having such fun!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815348530">Speaking of B/N, Borders, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I took a poll of my 6 grade inner city class today (where I teach 6th <br/>
grade English, reading,e tc.) and of the 31 kids I have in that class, 2 <br/>
have been to a large book store.  All had been to the city library, it&#39;s <br/>
a common field trip for the schools.  None had been to what my children <br/>
have called at different times &quot;the candy store&quot;, &quot;Paradise&quot; and <br/>
&quot;heaven&quot; (ie, large book stores.) <br/>
<br/>
No wonder these kids are not readers, they don&#39;t know what&#39;s out there!  <br/>
I think that will be the field trip I plan.  To Borders. Or Barnes & <br/>
Noble or wheverever.  Whatever Large bookstore. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s such a priceless moment! I&#39;m glad you shared it. It&#39;s a <br/>
milestone in mothering, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9 year old boy who declared at age 5: I won&#39;t be taught. :) <br/>
He was born an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
So I never have been able to teach him a dang thing (though I <br/>
tried to until joining this loop!). He learned to read on his own at <br/>
7. But he hasn&#39;t been a big &quot;reader.&quot; I went to B&N a month ago <br/>
to buy some books for my older kids and saw _The Mouse and <br/>
the Motorcycle_ on one of the kids&#39; tables. I knew immediately <br/>
that would be a book he&#39;d like.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say much about it when I got home. I put it on the kitchen <br/>
table and when he asked me about it, I just said, &quot;I saw this book <br/>
and thought of you. If you want me to read it to you, I will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Later that day, he told me &quot;I&#39;m going to read it myself, Mom. The <br/>
whole thing. I don&#39;t want any help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And boy, he is doing just that. Each day a little more. He is really <br/>
proud of himself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just so pleased to watch these unschooled kids grow under <br/>
their own powers.<br/>
