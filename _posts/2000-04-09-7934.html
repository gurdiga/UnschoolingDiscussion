<div id="ygrps-yiv-1192183663">&lt;&lt;It&#39;s just that dh has his reservations, as do I ,<br/>
about sending our kids into the world knowing nothing but the PBS sched.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been sending our kids into the world almost every day since we started homeschooling nine or so years ago!<br/>
<br/>
I think school, and some forms of homeschooling, gives people the idea that all education/learning happens in a particular building or place at a particular time and then, when it&#39;s finished, the student goes &quot;out into the world&quot;. If you&#39;re not in school, and not doing school at home, you have &quot;the world&quot; at your disposal.<br/>
