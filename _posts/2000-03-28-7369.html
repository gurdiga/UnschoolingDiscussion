<div id="ygrps-yiv-1468525272">I&#39;m resending this because it seems to have got lost in cyberspace...sorry if <br/>
it&#39;s a repeat.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry all this doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with unschooling (though many <br/>
will argue that everything does), but the reason I&#39;m posting this on here is <br/>
because I know there are many on here with chronic diseases.  I went to the <br/>
doctor last week with many many symptoms and he told me it was probably just <br/>
mild fibromylgia (would hate to see severe) but ran some test anyway.  My ANA <br/>
titer came back a high positive.  Doctor said he was surprised, he was <br/>
expecting all tests to be normal.  Anyway does anyone here know what diseases <br/>
this might indicate.  Before the test we were concerned that it might be MS, <br/>
but now think it&#39;s probably lupus, there&#39;s a family history of lupus too.  My <br/>
doctor doesn&#39;t seem to think I fit the criteria, though my mom, who&#39;s an RN <br/>
does.  Anyway, I was wondering if anyone here knew of any other diseases that <br/>
an abnormal ANA test might indicate.  And do people with MS have abnormal ANAs?<br/>
<br/>
Many thanks in advance,<br/>
