<div id="ygrps-yiv-285695987">We&#39;re finally settled in here in Indiana - hopefully I&#39;ll be able to <br/>
keep up with the list now.  But, I need a job that I can work at home <br/>
like on my computer.  I have no idea how to do it.  I have seen so <br/>
many &quot;job offers&quot; that sound like a chain letter type thing - you <br/>
send the person at the top of the list $5 and we&#39;ll put your name at <br/>
the bottom, etc.  Or we&#39;ll sell you an address list and you sell each <br/>
one of them an address list, etc.  I don&#39;t want to do that kind of <br/>
thing.  Does anyone know what I can do?  I don&#39;t want to put the kids <br/>
in day-care or anything.  I&#39;m pretty desperate.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
