<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918813057">This isn&#39;t applicable to everyone, but for those who had parents who were <br/>
alcoholics, substance abusers, rage-guys, there might be a bit of comfort or <br/>
idea-parts.<br/>
<br/>
Someone here last week suggested maybe I should check into Adult Children of <br/>
Alcoholics.  I realize it was intended as a slam rather than an honest piece <br/>
of advice, and many people on this list are aware that I&#39;ve not only been <br/>
involved in that but have helped others find it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s something which just came back to me in private e-mail with a <br/>
thank-you note, and I thought there might be others on this list who could <br/>
use it for themselves or a friend.<br/>
<br/>
The question had been, in private mail: &lt;&lt;  The other question I had was is <br/>
there a particular book or publication on  the topic that you found <br/>
especially helpful.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And my response, to the end:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; There was a plain old book called &quot;Adult Children of Alcoholics.&quot;  But I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>bet<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now there are websites.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Al-Anon  concept of &quot;detachment&quot; helped me more than anything, and<br/>
&gt; discussions of that can be found on websits about al-anon and also<br/>
&gt; co-dependency.   It&#39;s the idea of separating your life from other people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lives--not in a mean way, but in a way that makes it clearer for you that<br/>
&gt; their problems are really not your problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At first it seems to mean you would no longer care about the person, but<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not the idea.  It has come to mean that pretty much for me in my<br/>
&gt; relationship with my younger half-brother (29).  I don&#39;t want him in my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>life<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I don&#39;t yell about it.  I just tell him quietly and clearly every few<br/>
&gt; years that I want my kids to grow up without being woken up by drunks, and<br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m sorry for his sad upbringing, but I don&#39;t trust him not to steal<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; stuff and there are a lot of other people in the world he can deal with,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he needs to go take care of my mom if he wants some contact with his<br/>
&gt; relatives.  (Never all that at once, but that&#39;s what he hears from me if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>he<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; collects the whole set.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Another concept which changed me was &quot;reparenting.&quot;  Some of the people at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; meeting carried teddy bears around with them to and at meetings.  They<br/>
 </span></blockquote>were<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in therapy groups (mid-80&#39;s, when it was) which recommended they have a<br/>
&gt; &quot;child&quot; with them and treat that surrogate baby as they would wish to have<br/>
&gt; been treated.  So their &quot;inner child&quot; was represented by this stuffed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>animal,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and they put their compassion toward making something (anything else;<br/>
&gt; themselves as children) comfortable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I got pregnant within a few months of starting those meetings, so Kirby<br/>
&gt; became my reparenting object.  I tried to do for/to him what my parents<br/>
 </span></blockquote>could<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have done for/to me if they had had a few more resources and more<br/>
 </span></blockquote>awareness.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My dad worked lots, and happily.  He was very physical and kind and out of<br/>
&gt; the house a lot, and tired when he was home.  My mom was not good at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thinking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; three or four moves out in advance.  She did what seemed best of a very<br/>
&gt; limited set of choices, and justified in her head that it was good and<br/>
&gt; sufficient.  I tried consciously to increase my range of choices and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>options<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; by finding out what other families did with their kids, and what was the<br/>
&gt; outside of the envelope on what was possible and allowable.  WHAT IF my<br/>
 </span></blockquote>kids<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; slept with me?  WHAT IF I let them play as long as they wanted at the park<br/>
&gt; instead of setting a limit in advance?  WHAT IF kids stay up late?  (I<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tried<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; all that; the world didn&#39;t end, they didn&#39;t get sick, social services<br/>
 </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; take them away.  So I experimented with other stuff. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People used to ask us &quot;What time do your kids go to bed?&quot; and we&#39;d say<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Half<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; an hour or so after they go to sleep.&quot;  They would sleep when they were<br/>
&gt; tired, wherever they were, and would go to sleep near us, usually--in our<br/>
&gt; laps, on the couch, on the floor, on a nearby chair.  And we&#39;d carry them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; put them in bed.  Meanwhile our other friends had to plan their lives<br/>
 </span></blockquote>around<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their children&#39;s bedtimes because the kids were &quot;trained&quot; by the clock and<br/>
&gt; &quot;routines.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Professionals in those days were always saying &quot;Kids need routine.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I disagree hugely.  Kids need love and confidence.  They need things that<br/>
&gt; make sense.  They need some reliability.  It doesn&#39;t have to be a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>scheduled<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;routine.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you went to ACOA meetings they would remind you that nobody&#39;s drinking<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; your fault, that you can&#39;t control other people&#39;s alcoholism, that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>alcoholism<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is stronger than many people and comes to defend its own existence, that<br/>
&gt; whether or not the alcoholic continues, quits, lives or dies, your own<br/>
 </span></blockquote>life<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; is separate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I needed the meetings, but I didn&#39;t have kids at first (I went four years,<br/>
&gt; through the time Marty was born, and the group broke up and split out<br/>
 </span></blockquote>because<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we lost the free site and didn&#39;t survive the move).  Maybe you could find<br/>
&gt; meetings with childcare, or maybe you could find an internet support<br/>
 </span></blockquote>group.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I bet there is a website kinda like unschooling.com!  I&#39;ve never looked,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I bet it&#39;s out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck, and I&#39;ll be here if you need me!<br/>
