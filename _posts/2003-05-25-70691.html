And in my case, I think my higher being was testing me to see how much I<br/>
really wanted children. My first was absolutely a chore. My own mom says she<br/>
never thought I would have any more children after Tara. The first 2 years<br/>
were very trying. I went on to have 3 more. All of them most agreable<br/>
babies. I was rewarded in plenty of ways!<br/>

Maybe Marty was my reward for putting up with Kirby!<br/>
It was a gamble I won. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
(And now that they&#39;re older they&#39;re both easy to live with.)<br/>
