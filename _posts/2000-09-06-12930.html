<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173877240">Well, right now she is trying to make contact with a support group in her <br/>
really rurual area in Missouri...she pulled the kidlets out because they were <br/>
having a really hard time with teachers and waking up dreading each and every <br/>
day....she doesnt have cirruculm yet....and the kids are feeling like summer <br/>
again and are very excited with this oppurtunity....the 11yr old girl is <br/>
making a quilt she has been working on for a while and her 12yr son took <br/>
apart his bike tire yesterday to see how it works. (sound like unschooling to <br/>
me...and I pointed this out to my dsister)...we have dicussed unschooling, <br/>
but she is not sure if she is comfortable with that yet....she is looking for <br/>
support from people who have kids my neice and nephews ages....she said the <br/>
older two went on to do their thing but the 7yr old is having trouble being <br/>
bored....we discussed making a list of things she like to do, then Mom <br/>
sending her to it when the B word apprears....I am just amazed she did it so <br/>
quickly.  I guess everyones post really got to my sister and BIL.  Now they <br/>
are just trying figure out what to do and how to deal with the negativity <br/>
from others....<br/>
