<div id="ygrps-yiv-231541529">&lt;Schooling: The process by which a predetermined (and often arbitrary)<br/>
set of learning goals/outcomes is reached using predetermined (and often<br/>
arbitrary) standardized curriculum administered by an authority figure<br/>
to target groups of students sorted largely by chronological age.<br/>
Unschooling: The process by which a person acquires specific and<br/>
non-specific skills and information as determined by the needs and<br/>
interests of the person(s) doing the learning and by methods suited to<br/>
and chosen by those doing the learning.  A lot of unschooling learning <br/>
intrinsic, and some of the learning is often also accomplished by more<br/>
&quot;traditional&quot; methods, but the what, how, when,where,and why are<br/>
determined by the learner and his/her goals rather than a bureaucrat in<br/>
a government office, or a curriculum designer who has never met my<br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the process by which an individual learns to take<br/>
responsibility for his/her learning and his/her life, which should<br/>
(ideally) be one and the same.&gt;<br/>
