 </span></blockquote>Ann, your messages are coming through fine.  Here is a recipe for the paper<br/>
that was passed on to me from another list.  Enjoy!<br/>
Laraine<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>1. tear your old newspaper, toilet paper, printing paper, into small strips <br/>
and place in a bucket of hot water for at least an hour or leave overnight. <br/>
(tp can be used to lessen the mess and make a quick job......newspaper get<br/>
the <br/>
ink all over the kids hands and clothes if they are young) <br/>
2. Using a plastic detergent scoop lift out your presoaked paper and puree it <br/>
in your blender to reduce it even smaller into what we call pulp. Only do <br/>
small amounts at a time and add additional water to the blender if needed <br/>
otherwise you burn the blender up (I know from experience!) Takes less than a <br/>
minute or so in the blender. Stir in your seeds as liberally as you want or <br/>
wait and stick them in by hand when you screen your pulp.<br/>
3. We took 4 inch square pieces of old window screening and placed them in<br/>
our <br/>
left hand. With our right hand we poured the pulp onto the screen. Hold the <br/>
screen over a bucket when doing the pouring because all the excess water runs <br/>
through the screen and leaves the pulp.<br/>
4. lay the screen with the pulp on an old newspaper and lay a 5 inch piece of <br/>
felt over the pulp and roll with your rolling pin.. This takes out the excess <br/>
water. You can gently pick up the screen and flip the felt over in your hand. <br/>
Peel the screen off the paper and lay it and the felt down to dry. Once dry <br/>
you can peel it from the felt to plant later or send to a friend, etc.<br/>
5. You know you can experiment without adding seeds and add pieces of nature <br/>
to your pulp and see what it does to your paper. Try dry grasses, leaves, <br/>
petals, threads, colored paper, sandetc. Have Fun!</div>

<br/>
In recent years, the four testing companies that dominate the market <br/>
have experienced serious breakdowns in quality control. Problems at <br/>
NCS, for example, extend beyond Minnesota. In the last three years, <br/>
the company produced a flawed answer key that incorrectly lowered <br/>
multiple-choice scores for 12,000 Arizona students, erred in adding <br/>
up scores of essay tests for students in Michigan and was forced with <br/>
another company to rescore 204,000 essay tests in Washington because <br/>
the state found the scores too generous. NCS also missed important <br/>
deadlines for delivering test results in Florida and California.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I wanted to just throw them out and hire a new company,&quot; said <br/>
Christine Jax, Minnesota&#39;s top education official. &quot;But then my <br/>
testing director warned me that there isn&#39;t a blemish-free testing <br/>
company out there. That really shocked me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
One error by another big company resulted in nearly 9,000 students in <br/>
New York City being mistakenly assigned to summer school in 1999. In <br/>
Kentucky, a mistake in 1997 by a smaller company, Measured Progress <br/>
of Dover, N.H., denied $2 million in achievement awards to deserving <br/>
schools. In California, test booklets have been delivered to schools <br/>
too late for the scheduled test, were left out in the rain or arrived <br/>
with missing pages.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, testing companies turn the scoring of these writing samples <br/>
over to thousands of temporary workers earning as little as $9 an <br/>
hour. &quot;Lots of people don&#39;t even read the whole test - the time <br/>
pressure and scoring pressure are just too great,&quot; said Artur <br/>
Golczewski, a doctoral candidate, who said he has scored tests for <br/>
NCS for two years, most recently in April.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687566329">&lt;&lt;Maybe the person doesn&#39;t want to wait until they are 34 just to avoid the<br/>
SATs)<br/>
<br/>
Then don&#39;t.  (I don&#39;t think that was really the point anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Go take them.  Big deal.  They aren&#39;t particularly difficult because all you<br/>
need to know is how to take tests.  I never studied in school, never<br/>
prepared for a test in my life and I got over 1300 on the SAT.  Dh was<br/>
studying to be an EMT.  I was able to pass all the practice tests.  My only<br/>
medical training is working on the psych ward at some hospitals.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t feel comfortable taking them, don&#39;t.  Take some community<br/>
college classes and then see about transferring.  Or take them and then<br/>
start out at an &quot;open enrollment&quot; college (they often ask for test results<br/>
but don&#39;t really use them against you, these colleges are often utilized by<br/>
athletes who aren&#39;t quite good enough for full scholarships at large<br/>
universities).<br/>
<br/>
Do apprenticeship types of things.  Most people love to have bright,<br/>
interested passionate kids working for and with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795331261">1 - check the laws of the state - is there an alternate form of <br/>
evaluation allowed? Many states push testing but a narrative or <br/>
portfolio is acceptable as well - and many times, if narratives or <br/>
something are acceptable, there are unschooling friendly reviewers <br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
2 - again with the laws - what does it say about administering the <br/>
test? Must it be administered at school, using a state test? Or can <br/>
you test at home yourself? Or, is there a homeschool support <br/>
organization you can test through rather than the school district?<br/>
<br/>
3 - more legal - who sees the results? Is there a minimum score? <br/>
what is the outcome if you (a) don&#39;t test? (b) go below a minimum <br/>
score? (if there is one) In many places, the minimum score is so low <br/>
as to be ridiculous - random selection can get those scores. And, if <br/>
no one but you receives the scores, you can toss the results, <br/>
unopened, into a drawer &quot;just in case&quot; someone ever gets around to <br/>
asking about it BUT the results won&#39;t impact your family (since you <br/>
never look at them).<br/>
<br/>
Knowing the laws thoroughly is crucial. If you can test at home <br/>
using a test of your choice and then no one sees the scores, it can <br/>
be a pretty painless exercise in hoop jumping.</div>

 </span></blockquote>This year the school district has Hannah, 8,  listed as a 2nd grader, <br/>
hence her first standardized test -- it may be her first test since her <br/>
newborn PKU test &lt;bg&gt;.  What I always remember is (1) the answer is *on* <br/>
the test - it&#39;s really &quot;find the answer&quot; instead of &quot;come up with your <br/>
own,&quot; and (2) the results of the test show how well your child takes <br/>
tests, NOT how well your child knows English, Math, Science, whatever. <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re winging it!  I&#39;ve told her that I&#39;ve got to pick up the test in <br/>
April, that she&#39;ll get this cool answer sheet to bubble in her answer, <br/>
and this is just one hoop we jump through for the awesome opportunity to <br/>
be home together [we&#39;re fortunate it&#39;s the ONLY hoop in SD--tests <br/>
2,4,8,11th grades].  She&#39;s actually excited to do something so &quot;schooly&quot; <br/>
-- we may just play One Room Schoolhouse for that whole day &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just as a major complaint in school buildings is the concept of <br/>
&quot;teaching to the test,&quot; I&#39;d say this is a real danger for a parent to <br/>
do, as the kids have NO escape from Mom&#39;s test anxiety.  Empower your <br/>
kids to ease their dependence on external gauges of success; do whatever <br/>
it takes to raise them without your fears.  The school system does, in <br/>
some sense, dictate how I raise my kids, but not in the way *they* <br/>
anticipate.  I&#39;ve taken all the fun memories and worked to have similar <br/>
joyful experiences for my children; I&#39;ve taken the dark, scary ones and <br/>
worked to avoid them at all costs, refusing to pass them along to my <br/>
children.  Lucky for me & my kids, I&#39;ve been a great test taker in my <br/>
life and I&#39;ve convinced them they&#39;ve inherited the skill &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

The story is that the government at some point decided to make spellings of<br/>
towns uniform so there weren&#39;t -vils and -vills and -villes and so on. The<br/>
government wanted all -burghs and -bergs to be -burgs. Pittsburgh fought the<br/>
government for the right to keep the h because it was historical :-)<br/>

*****LOL Joyce, I noticed that after I sent it and my spell check didn&#39;t even catch it. Thanks for the history, I do know there is an *h* but my fingers weren&#39;t cooperating &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Now that is very interesting to me. I never knew that and I am originally<br/>
from outside Pittsburgh. Good old Beaver Falls to be exact!!!<br/>
Thanks Joyce!<br/>
