 </span></blockquote>Well, maybe I&#39;m old fashioned, but I put my kids to bed and we have adult time in the evenings.  Whether it&#39;s just Hubby and I having a date at home, or friends for a non-kid movie, or whatever.  The kids are allowed to stay up as long as they want, providing they are playing quietly in their rooms.  They each have a three way touch lamp which they can reach to turn up or down, and plenty of toys and books and things.<br/>
<br/>
This is my only adult social time away from the kids, since I am at home full time with them.  I do need that peace where I don&#39;t have a toddler climbing up my leg or running around, or a diaper or a mess to clean up, or somebody needing something every minute of every day.  It is so nice to sit down and ask Hubby to bring ME something for a change.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263175288">My kids have something similar, but not bedtime.  we have <br/>
&#39;upstairs time,&#39; which means that if they&#39;re ready to go to bed they <br/>
let us know and we do supper, teeth, story and sleep.  If they&#39;re <br/>
not ready for bed they play in their room (which isn&#39;t where they <br/>
sleep) until they are.  We found that giving them supper any <br/>
earlier than actual sleep-time was a waste, because they&#39;d play <br/>
for another hour or however long and then be hungry again, so <br/>
we&#39;d have more washing up, etc and being dishwasher-less makes <br/>
things like that more important &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, 9.50pm, they&#39;re in their room, clearing the floor so <br/>
I can vac tomorrow.  there are feetmark, but they&#39;re staying in <br/>
until it&#39;s done.  It&#39;s unfortunate that it&#39;s the first night of my <br/>
rescheduled Tai Chi class for summer, so Daddy&#39;s had them, and <br/>
not reminded them that it was Monday night.  They&#39;re both tired <br/>
and fed-up but what can I do.  If it gets left &#39;til tomorrow there&#39;ll <br/>
be more feetmark, and it takes me much longer to get my work <br/>
done.  so I&#39;m chatting with y&#39;all instead &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Oh well, when it works it is great LOL</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1884341284">Just been scanning back through the email (trouble with email <br/>
reader, brought back a load of prev.deleted stuff...) and thought I <br/>
might not have answered this.  &#39;feetmark,&#39; hmm.  one of those <br/>
words/phrases that says just what you mean it to, but hard to pin <br/>
down a definition...  general complaint about a process or request, <br/>
i think is closest &lt;g&gt;<br/>
