My sister had decided long ago that they would not spank or be punitive about <br/>

the message....so when they were noisy/wiggly/ normal kids, she simply let <br/>
them for a while and if they got disruptive or couldn&#39;t calm down with a <br/>
simply &quot;shhhh&quot;, she would take them out (so as not to disrupt others) and <br/>
walk with them or something calming.<br/>

They were fairly disruptive, as they are high energy kids, but it wasn&#39;t <br/>
anything major.<br/>
She wasn&#39;t beating them into submission like other families in our church <br/>
though, so two of the female ministers scheduled a &quot;visit&quot; with her and her <br/>
dh.<br/>
It was quite a visit. I thought my bil was going to strangle both of them <br/>

He told them in no uncertain terms that it was none of their business and <br/>
that they ought to be talking to the families that hit their children for <br/>
every little noise they made.<br/>
It is unfortunately a huge conservative christian issue.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean it is only a Christian problem, it IS anger and skill <br/>

available within conservative christian realms....it&#39;s encouraged and even <br/>
pushed.<br/>

&gt; I group up with my mom and step dad until I was 16. My biological parents<br/>
werent married. I was told about my dad at 16 yrs . Shortly after I met him.<br/>
I moved in with him due to favortism over a step sister. His discipline was<br/>
spanking or grounding. I moved in with my biological dad and found out there<br/>
were other better ways to deal with fustrations and problems. Communication<br/>
can go a long way.<br/>
My step dad hasnt changed his ways but I have now that my children are<br/>
18mths and 2. Time outs are working so far and taking things or priveleges. </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely true.  I was hounded for years because I didn&#39;t spank Lanora, was <br/>
given many dire predictions, mainly that she would grow up to be a brat.  The <br/>
fact that she was honest, calm, polite, enjoyed being with me and other <br/>
adults only seemed to make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling and the progression towards no punishment eventually made it <br/>
almost impossible for me to continue in the company of these people.  It was <br/>
a good move in the long run, I&#39;ve since found dear friends who have made my <br/>
life and Lanora&#39;s so much richer, some christians, some just spiritual.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m not saying all fundamentalists are like that. Only that those with that<br/>
 type of personality will be drawn to fundamentalism. And those who are drawn<br/>
 because they need to feel a part of a community that holds the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
 answers will easily be persuaded to spank their children. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but don&#39;t forget those whose personalities would NOT be drawn to it, but <br/>
were raised in it and heavily brainwashed.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe my personality is one that would naturally be drawn to <br/>
fundamentalism.<br/>
Yet it took me until just the last couple of years to disentangle myself from <br/>
the church I grew up in. Mind control is powerful stuff.<br/>
And when you&#39;re raised in a church that your ENTIRE family believes is THE <br/>
way, it is more than church you&#39;re walking away from. Many people don&#39;t have <br/>
the strength it takes to walk away from family, extended family and friends <br/>
they&#39;ve had their entire lives.<br/>
Not all churches are just another church. Some are very much like your family <br/>
and entire network of support. It&#39;s like being Amish, you don&#39;t just walk <br/>
away without huge repurcussions.<br/>
I am on a support group for former members and I hear daily of the anguish it <br/>
has caused in many lives.<br/>
Some of these folks have no contact with their families over it, how many are <br/>
still in because they&#39;re too scared to walk away from their families? Sad <br/>
stuff.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Nobody ever said that only conservative Christians spank, but as<br/>
&gt; far as I<br/>
&gt;&gt; know they are the only ones who&#39;ve made an industry from it.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Pam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone did.  That&#39;s how this entire thread started.<br/>

Christians spank&quot; because I missed it and my re-reading of the archives<br/>
