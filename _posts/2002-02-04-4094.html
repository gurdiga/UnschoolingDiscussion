&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;My younger daughter and I have taken to playing a cooperative version<br/>
&gt; &gt;of the Bean Game.  We try to see how many coins we can get <br/>
&gt;collectively<br/>
&gt; &gt;by the end of the game.  It was her idea, and it works really well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So what is the Great Dalmuti, and what&#39;s the Bean Game?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Great Dalmuti is an out-of-print (I think) Richard Garfield<br/>
game.  It&#39;s the most unfair game in the world.  Those that has<br/>
gets and those that don&#39;t have to pay taxes.  It&#39;s a great party<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
At the annual Crawdad Festival (a Northern California homeschooling<br/>
party that goes for a whole weekend in September), I stayed up<br/>
with the teenagers and played until the wee hours of the morning.<br/>
I told the other adults that I was the chaperone, but I turned<br/>
into a teenager as soon as they left the room.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling teenagers are so much fun.<br/>
<br/>
The Bean Game is really called Bohnanza and is put out by Rio<br/>
Grande.  You&#39;re a bean farmer planting and harvesting beans.<br/>
The bean cards make me smile.  It&#39;s a good game to play while<br/>
you&#39;re chatting with friends.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;When we first started, I&#39;d feel hurt if my kids rejected my<br/>
&gt; &gt;offerings.  It&#39;s much easier now to offer them things with no<br/>
&gt; &gt;strings attached.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;How did you work through that one, because it&#39;s still a problem for <br/>
&gt;me?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  How did I?<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did was to just leave things around casually instead<br/>
of offering them directly.  Thus, if the kids didn&#39;t pick them<br/>
up, I could tell myself they hadn&#39;t noticed them instead of<br/>
taking it personally.<br/>
<br/>
I also have Negative First Reaction kids, so they rejected things<br/>
a lot.  This gave me a lot of practice in breathing through<br/>
rejection.  Often they would later pick up whatever it was,<br/>
but not until after they&#39;d insisted that it was something they&#39;d<br/>
never be interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d try to look at things analytically.  Often, the kids<br/>
were right.  I was offering them something stupid, or I was<br/>
offering it to them at a bad time, or in some other way blowing<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
I got better at offering in a sensitive way, without pushing.<br/>
My kids don&#39;t like pushing at all.  They&#39;ll push back almost<br/>
every single time.<br/>
<br/>
And, y&#39;know, it&#39;s no big deal if they reject one of my ideas.<br/>
It&#39;s just a thing.  It&#39;s better to do things that everyone <br/>
enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
Things do tend to come around on the guitar, if I wait long<br/>
enough.  Every fall, I&#39;ve said that I&#39;d enjoy Family Nature<br/>
Walks and our local Homeschooling Choir.  Every year, the kids<br/>
would tell me that they&#39;d hate those activities, so we didn&#39;t do<br/>
them.  This year, the kids said that, yes, those sounded like <br/>
great activities.<br/>
<br/>
It also probably helps that there are four of them.  If I <br/>
offer something, chances are that at least one of them will<br/>
take me up on it.<br/>

And one variation (the only one my kids want to play) involves wearing hats.  <br/>
You gather up odd/cool hats, and the people get to pick by rank, or else <br/>
there are hats designated to represent the top two guys and the bottom few, <br/>
and the rest only change if you&#39;re winning or losing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We usually have hats for the dalmutis and the peons, and ragged old<br/>
shirts from the rag bag, and whatever else people come up with. It&#39;s a<br/>
very creative game... and sometimes the merchants decide what they&#39;re<br/>
selling, a lower merchant might be a tinker selling old pots and pans,<br/>
the highest merchant sells jewels, stuff like that... and the peons get<br/>
to grovel and the dalmutis get to act imperious. Oh, and we usually have<br/>
appropriate seating for everyone, the dalmutis get padded chairs and the<br/>
peons get an old woodn box, or sometimes the piano bench if they&#39;re<br/>
lucky... it&#39;s all fun.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, within the past year or so. You can get it on ebay still,<br/>
usually...<br/>

different, there&#39;s no trading so the interaction i a bit different, but<br/>
we still liked it. Each card has a drawing from a different scifi movie<br/>
