<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171498951">See if you have a local wildlife rehabilitator in your area.  The local <br/>
humane society would have the numbers of local wildlife <br/>
rehabilitators.  Or, you can try the local vet&#39;s emergency phone number.<br/>
<br/>
I just learned recently that unless you have seen that the bird&#39;s mamma has <br/>
been injured or killed, the likelihood is that this is not an orphaned <br/>
bird.  Apparently, fledglings don&#39;t start out flying from the nest, but <br/>
from the ground.  Lots of times we stumble across a fledgling and assume <br/>
that it&#39;s orphaned, when it&#39;s really okay.  You could try returning your <br/>
charge to where you found him/her and see watching to see if mom comes <br/>
by.  Don&#39;t worry about that stuff about your smell.  Birds don&#39;t really <br/>
have a sense of smell, so you don&#39;t have to worry about the mamma rejecting <br/>
her babe because you interfered.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I rescued many baby birds when I was a teen.<br/>
Some made it to adulthood, some didn&#39;t.<br/>
Try feeding the baby cooked oatmeal - on a tip of a popsicle stick or sucked<br/>
up into a straw and then it&#39;s easy to push with a long stick, like a<br/>
chopstick (not blow) into the baby&#39;s mouth. I also added mashed, hard-boiled<br/>
egg to the oatmeal mixture.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to feed baby birds is soaked pieces of dry dog food. This may<br/>
be a lot easier than oatmeal, especially if you already have a dog around.<br/>
<br/>
You can also buy baby-bird mix (add water) specially formulated to feed<br/>
babies at some stores that sell baby chicks and other farm-type feed stores.<br/>
I have a friend who is hand-feeding, with a syringe, a baby cockatiel with<br/>
this reconstituted mix.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any sources for this information - this is just going off my<br/>
own personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun with the baby and good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is also very good advice that I didn&#39;t think about.<br/>
Especially if the bird already has feathers, which you said it did.<br/>
Many of the birds I found were still too young to fly and needed care.<br/>
Here in town we do have organizations that care for fallen birds, where I<br/>
have taken some birds even recently.<br/>
But when I was younger, I did enjoy learning to take care of birds that I<br/>
found.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137933995">How long has it been since it&#39;s eaten?<br/>
Do you havbe a wildlife rehab anywhere close to you?<br/>
You may be able to call a vet and find out where you can get baby bird food.<br/>
It&#39;s a paste formula fed to the bird with a syringe.<br/>
Please don&#39;t be too hopeful about its survival unless you can get it fairly<br/>
quickly to a rehabber.<br/>
