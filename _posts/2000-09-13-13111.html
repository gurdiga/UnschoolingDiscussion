&gt; Hey there,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; sorry for the out of the blue email-but I am member of unschooling list<br/>
&gt; service and wanted to share with you a very cool thing in my life (I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t had the opportunity to post as often as I would of liked. I am<br/>
&gt; dyslexic and writing short little off the cuff post  is hard for me. My<br/>
&gt; mind tends to get overwhelmed with ideas that are much quicker then my<br/>
pen,<br/>
&gt; so I often just sit on the side lines and enjoy the great flow of great<br/>
&gt; ideas!).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But today my book Learning Outside the Lines (Simon & Schuster) is<br/>
&gt; officially published!!! This day has special meaning to me, considering<br/>
&gt; that I did not learn to read until I was 12, drooped out of sixth grade<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; was home schooled, only to be told the rest of my life that I would be a<br/>
&gt; failure. I am happy to say that the infamous &quot;they&quot; (we all know them )<br/>
&gt; were wrong about me-not only is my book out, but I recently graduated<br/>
brown<br/>
&gt; university with honors in English literature.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The book itself is my small attempt to make sure other students don&#39;t go<br/>
&gt; through the shame and struggle that I did, whether they are LD/ADHD, home<br/>
&gt; schooled, or simply think different. The book explores my and my<br/>
co-authors<br/>
&gt; (an ADHD, high school drop out who also graduated from brown) journey<br/>
&gt; through school then out lines alternative learning skills we developed to<br/>
&gt; beat all the odds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My royalties for Learning outside the lines also go to my other attempt to<br/>
&gt; help kids who think different, Project eye to eye-a national acclaimed<br/>
&gt; mentoring program for LD/ADHD children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The book is out all over the place now (a scary things for a kid who could<br/>
&gt; never even read teachers comments on his papers) and I would love to hear<br/>
&gt; what you think. The easiest  place to check it out on line is at this<br/>
link:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; But most importantly I wanted to thank you for your commitment to<br/>
&gt; alternative learning and cognitive diversity. Thanks so much for letting<br/>
me<br/>
&gt; be a part of it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got it too.... and I have a preview copy of his book on my desk. It&#39;s a<br/>
great story and he sounds eerily like a homeschooler in his view of public<br/>
schooling.  My favorite quote is this, &quot;educational revolution is the<br/>
ultimate outcome of pursuing an education that is about personal<br/>
empowerment.&quot;  His choice of words to describe life as an LD classroom child<br/>
is stark and sometimes harsh. The last section of tips, tricks and tools on<br/>
succeeding in college is very good, no matter what the LD.  If my children<br/>
will coooperate I&#39;ll write a real review this week. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I suspect we should tell him that harvesting names off of email lists is not<br/>
completely kosher.  :)<br/>
