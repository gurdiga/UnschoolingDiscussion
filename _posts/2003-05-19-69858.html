<br/>
&gt;The list goes on all weekend about HER and you expect her not to <br/>

<br/>
When someone says they are done with it and they are not going to <br/>
post anymore about it, then yes, I expect her not to post about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; YOU TORY posted MANY times why the hell didn&#39;t you stop??????????<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because I never said I was going to stop.  (Until my last post to <br/>
Glena, in which I said I would stop posting to her.  And I have.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Get off your horse, say something other than running behind someone <br/>
 </span></blockquote>else&#39;s <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;words and get over it for cry-n out loud. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like you have a lot to get over yourself.  Last time I <br/>
checked, I am allowed to post my thoughts on this board.  I am not <br/>
sure what you mean about running behind someone else&#39;s words.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Several posts that I read and some I wrote where NOT just about <br/>
&gt;Glena it was <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;back all <br/>
&gt;the talking this weekend should have ended while she was gone and it <br/>
 </span></blockquote>didn&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
If you read my next post, I stated exactly the fact that discussion <br/>
had moved on.  I do not have a problem with Glena posting.  It was <br/>
that she came back into a discussion she said she was leaving, and <br/>
said the same things she had already said again and <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe you should go away for a weekend we will all blast you in a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hundred or <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;so emails and you try to zip it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although it seems I have frustrated you quite a bit, I don&#39;t think I <br/>
have said anything on this board that would frustrate the number of <br/>
people Glena did.  If I were to do so, then that might happen.  If I <br/>
had found myself under the initial attack that Glena found herself, I <br/>
would have stopped posting MUCH earlier to determine what the hell I <br/>
was doing that was pissing so many people off.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

use you as a measuring stick.</div>

That was a bit harsh.  Certainly in the same *harsh* tone that got <br/>
some people upset with Sandra.  Glenna is back and she can certainly <br/>
defend herself.  I understand your point, however Glenna is not <br/>
making any new comments.  Her defenses are the same lines that can be <br/>
found in the archives.  If you are not making any new points, then <br/>
there is no reason to post.  Maybe, Tory&#39;s comment was sarcastic and <br/>
unnecessary but in all honestly yours stuck out far more to me.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you find so upsetting?  The tone of Tory&#39;s post or the <br/>
general frustration with Glenna?  I do not find that clear in this <br/>
post.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The general Frustration over the Glena situation and a couple others.<br/>
It was a moment last night after a long weekend of reading posts and it all <br/>
just was eating away at my positive thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I said it and I feel better. I was grouchy all weekend I let it all weigh on <br/>
my mind. Today is another day and I would like to see the list go back to the <br/>
way it was between the two Glena posts.<br/>
