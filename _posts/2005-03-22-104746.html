<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668954646">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
Shameless promotion coming!!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that my daughter Lelia (www.leliasmusic.com ) is going to be on a radio show on XPN in Philadelphia tonight  between 9 and 10 PM.  . . well, her music anyway. We have no idea how many songs they are playing or what songs even, but you can hear it on a Live Telecast on your computer if you go to www.xpn.org There is a Listen Live button you can click on. If you like what they play and want to request her music, you can do it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.xpn.org/request.php">http://www.xpn.org/request.php</a><br/>
<br/>
The thing about XPN is that radio stations from across the country listen to who they are playing and oftentimes pick up those artists to play on their station. We have heard that Lelia is being considered as an Artists to Watch for XPN, and when that happens, the artists gets a lot of national exposure. Sooo, if you feel like helping us out on making that happen, request her often :) <br/>
<br/>
Thanks a bunch!<br/>
