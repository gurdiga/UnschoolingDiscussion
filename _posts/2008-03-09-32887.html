<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281965864">Some criticism of unschooling I found.  It&#39;s good to know what the  <br/>
critics say.  It&#39;s not always a moment of joyful happy-dance, but it  <br/>
is useful.<br/>
<br/>
This builds up quite a while before getting to the dire and misguided  <br/>
point, but they quoted Pam Sorooshian in there, and other people<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Quotes from it in case you don&#39;t want to go there (I would not blame  <br/>
you a bit):<br/>
<br/>
*************<br/>
<br/>
we would like to make a statement, for the record, regarding the  <br/>
false but persistent notion that we advocate some form of unschooling  <br/>
before age ten. From the way some people talk, you could get the  <br/>
impression that we believe children should be left to wander about  <br/>
aimlessly, foraging in the forests for food, suffering from a dearth  <br/>
of discipline, until their tenth birthday.<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
<br/>
But in neither the training nor the teaching do we advocate leaving  <br/>
the child alone to explore his own interests. Children are not little  <br/>
adults.<br/>
<br/>
Train on Time<br/>
<br/>
On the basis of Scripture, we thoroughly reject the notion of  <br/>
unschooling – in principle and in practice – especially before age  <br/>
ten. The Scripture doctrines of original sin and total depravity  <br/>
should forever end the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
************NOT A QUOTE, a Sandra note:<br/>
<br/>
Two new sins I learned from that site:<br/>
<br/>
  the Sin of Hasty Conclusions, and &quot;intellectual misbehavior&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Another quote:<br/>
<br/>
***************************<br/>
<br/>
The first half of this verse tells us that a child must be  <br/>
disciplined with the rod and reproved for his misbehavior.  <br/>
Misbehavior may be manifested in a multitude of ways, including  <br/>
intellectual misbehavior.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
END OF QUOTES<br/>
<br/>
So whether or not they do it themselves (unschool), they&#39;re assuring  <br/>
all readers that it involves leaving children alone, one way or  <br/>
another.  I don&#39;t see anything in their quotes and examples that says  <br/>
&quot;leave them alone&quot; at all, but they seem to saying to be with them,  <br/>
explore with them, let them do real things.<br/>
<br/>
I want to collect more links to criticism of unschooling, for those  <br/>
people who come by and say they want the other side, too.  I&#39;ll start  <br/>
with this link and put it here:<br/>
