&lt;&lt; What exactly is/are these five in a row &quot;things&quot;...books??  I&#39;ve heard <br/>
them <br/>
 referred to before but never a real explanation of what they are...would it <br/>
 be age appropriate for a 14yo girl?  Information, Please!!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>B5IAR is for 8 - 12 year olds by the guide.  They take books and turn them <br/>
into multiple learning experiences.  Dare I say it is unit study...but it is. <br/>
 Doing the Edison unit...I know I could not have been creative enough to come <br/>
up with the ideas that author, formerly homeschooled herself, has put to <br/>
paper here.  I bounce the ideas off of the boys, and they do what they like.  <br/>
many of the &quot;concepts&quot; can be done with a simple conversation at the dinner <br/>
table, then if the boys are interested, we keep going, if not, we move on.  <br/>
It is incredible the ideas and things that can be learned through the Thomas <br/>
Edison guide, plenty of cool stuff to learn about.  if we were going by the <br/>
book on this unit, it would easily keep us busy for 17 weeks!!!!  But we are <br/>
really just getting to know Tom and the some of the cool ideas he came up <br/>
with while expanding on those ideas and reaching out into the world to grasp <br/>
as much good stuff as time allows (and that really ins&#39;t much with swimming, <br/>
baseball, visits with friends and families, sitting under a tree and drawing, <br/>
observing bugs, playing nintendo, running here and there to see this and <br/>
that).<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 volumes of Beyond 5 in A Row.  Each volume would take a whole year<br/>
to explore and expand upon.  The volume we are using (#2) uses the books; The <br/>
Boxcar Children #1, Thomas Edison, Young Inventor, Homer Price, and uhhhhhhh, <br/>
I forget the last book (it is in my car because I keep it with me opportunity <br/>
arises to touch on something while we are out and about).  And I found the <br/>
boys don&#39;t have to love to read to do this. Tthey are enjoying this I think <br/>
because of all of the hands on, in your face, exploratory activities that you <br/>
can do with it.<br/>
  <br/>
Somedays I really get down thinking that we do nothing productive.  then I <br/>
write on this list and I feel better :-)<br/>

  The Story of George Washington Carver<br/>
  Skylark<br/>
  Helen Keller<br/>
<br/>
  We read &#39;Sarah... &#39;  last year but I couldn&#39;t get my daughters very<br/>
  interested in the lesson activities. Hence, we are unschooling. I realized<br/>
  that , for right now, they are not into these pre-packaged learning<br/>
  experiences.<br/>
<br/>
  However, we did use the original FIAR with the girls when they were tiny<br/>
  and they loved it. <br/>
  I guess that it all depends on the ages and stages.<br/>
  Has anyone else found a way to use these books successfully??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76317018">Have any of you used the Five In A Row program? This came highly recomended<br/>
to me by a fellow LLL member and homeschooler. I checked out their web sight<br/>
at www.fiveinarow.com and it seemed like an inexpensive alternative to<br/>
prepackaged curriculums and something that my children could really get in<br/>
to. I&#39;m looking for any testimonials/critisisms that you might have.<br/>
