even homeschooling, let alone unschooling...<br/>

read.  My understanding is about letting go of control.  Have I been <br/>
seriously misled by unschoolers in this group and should I ought to be having <br/>
more control over what my sons do?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think the problem is that you think by having set guidelines for the<br/>
family it must mean oneof us is controlling the rest.  It doesn&#39;t.  The<br/>
guidelines are for the benefit of all and so that each person knows what<br/>
is expected of him/her.  They were workedout together by all of us in<br/>
response to a problem.  That problem was my husband who could not leave<br/>
the dishes or laundry undone.  Now, ANYONE who is not pulling their<br/>
weight, Ron and I included, looses the help and assistence  and perks of<br/>
being an equal until they are back up to speed.  A lot of this happens<br/>
unspoken, unannounced and without it being a control issue.  Obviously,<br/>
this whole list system is not set in stone.  Everything is variable from<br/>
week to week but it has really helped us to all be working together<br/>
effortlessly, instead of being in each otehrs way and all trying to do<br/>
the same things at once.<br/>
<br/>
You all keep talking about giving up control.  I didn&#39;t &#39;give up&#39; control<br/>
and I am not holding on to control.  I spread it around.  We are all in<br/>
control now.  And we are all much better friends for it.<br/>
<br/>
As for the &#39;educational&#39; aspects, well, they can learn and do whatever,<br/>
whenever as long as they are active participant in the family.  If I were<br/>
coming into this group with no background, based on only what I have been<br/>
told here, I would expect your houses all to look a little like the Lord<br/>
of the Flies.  I know they don&#39;t.  I know that you have led and cojoled<br/>
and manipulated your kids into being decent human beings one way or<br/>
another.  It didn&#39;t happen without your input.  <br/>
<br/>
I am getting tired of trying to explain my family&#39;s dynamics.  Especially<br/>
when everything I say is met with things like:<br/>
****<br/>
This has to be a joke doesn&#39;t it?  Tell me you are really someone who<br/>
sends <br/>
all their kids to PS and that you&#39;ve joined this list to antagonize<br/>
unschoolers...<br/>
******<br/>
Being dishonest is teaching dishonesty. (When my kid&#39;s knew exactly what<br/>
I did.)<br/>
********<br/>
Woohoo, lets hear it for authoritarian parenting!!! <br/>
****<br/>
And more.<br/>
<br/>
And now, with every comment I make , I accused of being defensive.  I am<br/>
just trying to explain my position to you more fully.<br/>
