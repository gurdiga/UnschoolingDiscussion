<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036265240">Hi Kimberly,<br/>
<br/>
2 of my kids attended school after we moved back to an old neighborhood<br/>
where they had gone to school prior to coming home.  (did that make any<br/>
sense?)  They would be attending school with all their old friends and<br/>
wanted to go.  Very sadly, I agreed.  My son even had to get shots to go and<br/>
still wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
The school was kind of jerky about it, very clearly assuming that the kids<br/>
would be way behind (in 2nd grade and K, if you can believe that).  They<br/>
tested the 2nd grader and she did fine.  The kids had a ball....initially.<br/>
They bounced right out of bed....initially.  They even did their<br/>
homework....initially.  Within 3 months, they both asked to come home and<br/>
have never mentioned going to school again.<br/>
