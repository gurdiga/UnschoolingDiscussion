<div id="ygrps-yiv-63110324">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone had some links to good parenting sites.  I <br/>
want my dear husband to take a parenting style test because he seems <br/>
to have a different view from me.  Does anyone else have this same <br/>
problem?  Thank you for the incites.<br/>
<br/>
