&lt;&lt;That is H$LDA in a nut shell.  What amazes is they seem to be a magnat<br/>
for<br/>
folks such as Scott who is less crediable at practicing law than the<br/>
average legal secretary!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Here in their home state, they seem to have &quot;invented&quot; a new option, the<br/>
umbrella school. Their handout on state law includes  a document that<br/>
says we can join this umbrella school, and be  a &quot;satellite&quot; campus of a<br/>
private school. Of course, the umbrella school, set up after Chris<br/>
Klicka&#39;s model, requires membership in HSLDA. But, if we are operating as<br/>
a private *school* then we are *not* homeschooling, so why do we need to<br/>
join a so-called &quot;homeschooling&quot; organization? DUH!<br/>
	Not to mention, the statute explicity states that &quot;Instruction of<br/>
children by their parents...shall not be classified...as a private,<br/>
denominational, or parochial school.&quot; Makes me wonder what in the heck<br/>
they&#39;re doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;SNIP&gt; a form for me that starts out by me admitting that I knew I was<br/>
breaking the law.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Really? I wanna&#39; see!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;SNIP&gt; By using their advise of calling H$LDA before you answer the door,<br/>
blocking the door, sending your kids to hide in another room, you justify<br/>
investigating a report.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;SNIP&gt; If you treat the vast majority of these folks like people instead<br/>
of with<br/>
paranoia, you get treated the same.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
	That seems true to me. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;  But then, who would join H$LDA??&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
	Those, who are unaware of the true situation. I think there are probably<br/>
many members who don&#39;t realize the real nature of the organiztion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745267829">I wish I could just once catch on tape or something one of them implying<br/>
that what they are selling is legal insurance.  I know CA would prosecute! <br/>
They have all those folks convinced it is legal insurance and all it is is<br/>
membership in an organization that will probably cause you more harm than<br/>
help you when you need it.<br/>
<br/>
The form they set up was on AHA-Networking about a year ago.  Mary might<br/>
have  copy or remember the state (I am a total failure at names).  I wrote<br/>
Scott at the time and asked why he would advise anyone to admit to wrong<br/>
doing and got back a rather tangled bunch of hooey that really didn&#39;t<br/>
address the issue.<br/>
<br/>
It is like the $50 M they are spending to build that college.  A stink was<br/>
raised about membership money doing that and now they are claiming they are<br/>
building an office building for H$LDA headquarters and they are only<br/>
&quot;renting&quot; the building to the college.  Like an office building would be<br/>
set up with classroom.<br/>
<br/>

Christian one called CHECK.  My understanding is that part of your <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699487063">hi,<br/>
<br/>
at first i had no real clue what all the fuss was over this topic.  mostly<br/>
because my son is only 4 and it isn&#39;t an issue but also because we, apparently,<br/>
have it great here in texas.  homeschooling is considered a private school,<br/>
which are not regulated so we have no real &#39;hoops to jump through&#39;.    the law<br/>
states: &#39;The home school must be run in a bona fide manner (not a sham or<br/>
subterfuge.)&#39; and is &#39;considered legitimate if parents used some sort of<br/>
curriculum consisting of books, workbooks or other written materials and that<br/>
they met &quot;basic education goals&quot; by teaching reading, spelling, grammar,<br/>
mathematics and good citizenship. Once that standard is met, the state&#39;s<br/>
authority ends, although the district court said school officials could ask<br/>
home-school parents about curricula and standardized tests.&#39;   this discussion<br/>
sure makes me think twice about moving.   it also makes me very grateful to all<br/>
those who have done all the groundwork and gotten us as far along as we are<br/>
(not that there isn&#39;t more to do).  thanks for all this info.<br/>

<br/>

seemed like a place i would like (i&#39;ve lived in over a dozen states but not<br/>
idaho, yet:)<br/>

&gt; at first i had no real clue what all the fuss was over this topic.  mostly<br/>
&gt; &gt;because my son is only 4 and it isn&#39;t an issue but also because we,<br/>
&gt; apparently,<br/>
&gt; &gt;have it great here in texas.  ... this discussion<br/>
&gt; &gt;sure makes me think twice about moving.<br/>

&gt; We live in Idaho, and it&#39;s easier here.  So if you did ever want to move,<br/>
&gt; you have at least one attractive option.<br/>
