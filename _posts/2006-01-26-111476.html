<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371366614">Hi all<br/>
<br/>
I lurk here usually, but have a question for which I would <br/>
appreciate some advice.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been deschooling most of last year, and in earnest since <br/>
October.  This month has seen the beginning of the school year here <br/>
in Australia so I am taking note of what they are doing for the sake <br/>
of sceptics.  I journal for myself daily and I&#39;ve just copied the <br/>
reporting draft for myself.  There are 8 children in our family, all <br/>
of whom are so, so different.  My concern right now is for my 12 1/2 <br/>
yo daughter.<br/>
<br/>
A very quick background.  Born extremely premature (25weeks) she has <br/>
struggled within herself (and with all those measuring sticks) at <br/>
each personal developmental stage.  She has not suffered with any <br/>
ongoing physical handicaps, just a more simplistic view of life.  My <br/>
husband and I have never labelled her, nor said she is behind etc., <br/>
and we have never gone in for the medical updates of doom and <br/>
gloom.  Certain foods upset her badly, so her choice is to have a <br/>
very simple diet which helps her feel calm and in control.  <br/>
<br/>
The issue for her (well really me) is she doesn&#39;t appear to have any <br/>
of her very own interests.  When asked, she will recite someone <br/>
else&#39;s dream, or desire, what she has heard someone else speak of.  <br/>
I try to guide her to express her own thoughts but I truly get a <br/>
blank look.  She doesn&#39;t see life through the same eyes as most <br/>
people, I&#39;m cool with that, I just want her to live her life, not <br/>
someone else&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
Strewing stuff for her feels like I&#39;m making up her mind for her.  <br/>
That&#39;s not what I want for her, I just can&#39;t seem to get her to <br/>
express her feelings and interests.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
Well, if you strew two things on the same table, when she walks up to <br/>
them she&#39;ll decide which one interests her the most, right?<br/>
<br/>
(I can imagine how having unpleasant reactions to food could make one a <br/>
cautious eater -- maybe it could make one a cautious try-er of everything?)<br/>
<br/>
If you really feel she can&#39;t tell you what her &quot;likes&quot; or interests are, <br/>
it still a good idea to try a variety of things.  (As much as she can <br/>
comfortably tolerate) You can watch her body language during an <br/>
experience and maybe discuss the activity as it ends so that even if she <br/>
doesn&#39;t know what she likes, you have some data to work with.  Then you <br/>
repeat the stuff that got the most positive response.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve had really polite guests before who said &quot;oh, that sounds lovely&quot; <br/>
rather tepidly to everything I offered and I was unable, at that time, <br/>
to find out what they really wanted.)<br/>

PS  If you strew some catalogs would she pick out what she wants?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1043305365">Watching her - what lights her eyes, what comforts her, what does she <br/>
meander over to in those odd moments here and there, etc - might be <br/>
more helpful than asking her. At this point, she&#39;s in the child/not <br/>
child transition and you note that all those milestone/transition <br/>
times tend to be rough times for her. She might not at this point be <br/>
able to say what her interests are because they&#39;re all still jumbled <br/>
and getting sorted out. What kinds of things are you expecting <br/>
exactly? Long range &quot;I want to go to medical school&quot; type <br/>
interests? &quot;I want to learn to knit&quot;? &quot;I&#39;d like a strawberry milkshake <br/>
with lunch please&quot;?  are all different types of interests or desires <br/>
but with very different levels of intensity (if you want to call it <br/>
that, I couldn&#39;t think of another phrase for it, maybe someone else <br/>
can).<br/>

probably NEXT October, but don&#39;t chicken out in the meantime!<br/>

Hers is the only view she will ever have.<br/>

If you don&#39;t like the answer, you shouldn&#39;t have asked the question.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m surprised every time anyone writes &quot;Well I asked my kids what  <br/>
their interests were, and they didn&#39;t know.&quot;  It&#39;s not a nice  <br/>
question to ask.  One doesn&#39;t ask one&#39;s husband some Tuesday  <br/>
afternoon &quot;So... what are your interests?  What kinds of things do  <br/>
you really like?&quot;  Presumably, living with the guy, one would already  <br/>
KNOW his interests.    Same with children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I try to guide her to express her own thoughts but I truly get a  <br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;re trying to dredge out thoughts that will make you feel  <br/>
good.  You want her to express something unique and clever, maybe,  <br/>
and she&#39;s not there yet.  The more you &quot;guide&quot; or ask, the more she  <br/>
might shut down, or feel there&#39;s something wrong with her, or that  <br/>
she&#39;s not giving the right answer on a test for which she&#39;s unprepared.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She doesn&#39;t see life through the same eyes as most<br/>

<br/>
Apparently not as cool with it as you would like to be.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Strewing stuff for her feels like I&#39;m making up her mind for her.<br/>

<br/>
You want her to be different from the way she is.  Try not to do that.<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t try to &quot;GET HER&quot; to do anything different, if she&#39;s  <br/>
healthy and happy.   If you put something out and she picks it up and  <br/>
examines it, plays with it, asks about it, shows it to someone else,  <br/>
in what way is that you making up her mind for her?  If you put  <br/>
something out and she doesn&#39;t pick it up, that&#39;s her expressing what  <br/>
her interests are (and aren&#39;t).<br/>
<br/>
Can you give us a more specific example of something you fear to  <br/>
&quot;strew&quot;?<br/>
