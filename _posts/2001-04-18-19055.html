<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021403072">all I can tell you is that at 8 years old, I personally, had no interest in sex,<br/>
or sexy innuendoes from movies. In fact, I was sort of oblivious to it all until<br/>
I was in my teens and my mom had given me a book on the subject that explained<br/>
it all. My daughter (6) currently thinks that all the hugging and kissing on the<br/>
movies is just gross. I think each child reaches different levels of the &quot;sex&quot;<br/>
issue at different times. I did not have older sisters/brothers either, so I may<br/>
have noticed things earlier if I did. You do not mention if this is the case<br/>
with your son. I would look at his reactions to some stuff as viewing one film.<br/>
Ask questions. I think you will be able to pick up and sense stuff from his<br/>
actions or non-actions to see if he should view these.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-849578932">Even though I don&#39;t like watching it, I&#39;m much less<br/>
concerned about sex in movies than violence. Sex is a<br/>
natural thing everyone does. Violence is not. The only<br/>
thing I object to about sex in movies (besides feeling<br/>
personally embarrassed by it) is when one partner is<br/>
using the other or whatever. Juli<br/>

<div><font face="HoratioDMed" color="#000080">My kids think &quot;sex&quot; stuff in movies is 
gross............my 8yo son just smiles and gets embarrassed.&nbsp; I do try to 
avoid very explicit scenes, fast forwarding.....and I try to explain when there 
is something I disagree with.........such as violence toward women and 
such.&nbsp; It is so hard to watch anything these days without some of this 
filtering in.&nbsp; To me, the sex bothers me much more than violence and 
language.&nbsp; My kids already know that those are wrong.........but sex is 
something they won&#39;t understand until much later, only after they have watched 
all these innuendos and immoral acts on TV or in movies.........its quite a 
dilemma for us parents.</font></div>

<div>My Life as a Dog is a coming of age movie, filmed somewhere in 
Europe.&nbsp; One of the girls in the film is beginning to develop breasts, so 
it deals a little with her dealing with that issue.&nbsp; She is a tomboy and 
one of the best athletes in their little town.&nbsp; There is a scene where she 
opens her blouse and asks a boy what he thinks about her breasts.&nbsp; Also, 
there are a couple of scenes with a married couple that probably wouldn&#39;t make 
it into a G rated movie.&nbsp; But I much prefer my kids to see something like 
Life as a Dog than most of the drivel that seems to be on prime time TV.&nbsp;
