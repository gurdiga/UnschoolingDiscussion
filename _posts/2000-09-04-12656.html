&gt;Did you say you are in the burbs near San Antonio?  I am in the sticks<br/>
&gt;approximately 100 miles from both SA and Austin.  Actually we are 21 miles<br/>
&gt;to Llano and 21 miles to Fredericksburg.  As soon as we can find good jobs<br/>
&gt;and get our place (21 acres, house, antique log cabin, and several<br/>
&gt;outbuildings) on the market, we are heading for the Pacific Northwest.<br/>
&gt;Their highs in the daytime are lower than our lows at night.<br/>
