  &lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;The problems of a child having to get up for school are not within the <br/>
    purview of this list&#39;s discussion, in my opinion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  -=-So, is this list for stay at home parents?-=-<br/>
<br/>
  Are you suggesting that all working parents must put their children in school <br/>
  but that they can still be unschoolers?  My comment was about a child being <br/>
  in school, not about whether parents worked outside the home.<br/>
<br/>
  What this list is for is on the main page at yahoogroups:<br/>
<br/>
  Description     Category: Home Schooling <br/>
  Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what they <br/>
  need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent is a <br/>
  facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with curiosity and <br/>
  enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what, when, where and <br/>
  how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to Spongebob <br/>
  Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to find out more <br/>
  about how video games and life in general are filled with learning, come join <br/>
  us!<br/>
<br/>
  As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is <br/>
  *not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed <br/>
  learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in <br/>
  unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in <br/>
  mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways <br/>
  designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at <br/>
  unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a <br/>
  &quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively <br/>
  debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions <br/>
  about this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll (<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are actually lots of working parents here. I&#39;m a single mom and<br/>
Rain&#39;s dad can&#39;t even support himself, so it&#39;s always been all me.<br/>
Generally I&#39;ve worked as much from home as I could, since it seemed<br/>
easier to mesh unschooling with that lifestyle. When I&#39;ve had to go to<br/>
meetings and things, if she didn&#39;t want to come I tried to find a friend<br/>
she could be with, or a paid one of her (homeschooled) teen friends to<br/>
babysit. If we had to leave early the next morning I told her that, but<br/>
usually she&#39;d still stay up late and sleep in the car, or take a nap when<br/>
we got home, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
Now that I&#39;m working for myself, I don&#39;t have the same schedule of<br/>
meetings and deadlines that  I used to, but Rain&#39;s involved in a lot of<br/>
things so we still generally keep a tight schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Working doesn&#39;t change the fundamentals of unschooling. <br/>

To be an unschooler the child needs not to be in school.<br/>
There are other places and people than school to be with a child while a <br/>
parent is at work.<br/>
If the child is in school and bedtime and homework and all are important <br/>
factors, then that&#39;s what it is.<br/>
<br/>
What advantage would there be for us to say &quot;Oh.  Okay.  That&#39;s unschooling <br/>

  I almost hate to say anything but I am pretty confused here. Wasn&#39;t the issue that your child was in school, and therefore, not being unschooled?<br/>

A schedule that involves the child doing things he doesn&#39;t want to simply <br/>
because Mom thinks it best is so far from unschooling. A schedule like I work <br/>
three days a week, Johnny has baseball twice a week on set days, we are in a <br/>
field trip group on Fridays,  is simply a set routine. Different than school <br/>
type scheduling.<br/>
You MAY HAVE a different point of view. That&#39;s okay! Some parents are more <br/>
comfortable with &quot;Relaxed homeschooling or Eclectic Homeschooling&quot;<br/>
Some of my best friends are relaxed homeschoolers. ;o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057250431">I work too, but just part-time. I&#39;m getting back into it as time allows. <br/>
I&#39;m in the fortunate position of not needing to work for financial <br/>

slowly but surely getting published and paid.<br/>

We find ways to balance work, learning, kids, family, dad&#39;s work, and so <br/>
on. Balance is the key. Unschooling is a good fit for us in many ways.<br/>
