<div id="ygrps-yiv-334812508"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;    From: Dalene Mactier &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Mactier@...">Mactier@...</a>&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m still in the early days of unschooling. My son is three and a half.<br/>
&gt; Inspired by The Unschooling Handbook i&#39;ve spent some time recording some<br/>
 </span></blockquote>of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; his learning and I&#39;m amazed at just how much learning takes place every<br/>
 </span></blockquote>day.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Just this morning we spent time building towers with food tins - due to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; lack of blocks<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thought I&#39;d throw in a good (cheap) way to make building blocks here. Just<br/>
take two half-gallon milk cartons, rinse them very thoroughly and wash with<br/>
soap, open up one end all the way on each carton, and push one of them all<br/>
the into the other one. Voila! you&#39;ve got a big building block that is<br/>
lightweight and versatile. My son uses these big &quot;bricks&quot; to build all sorts<br/>
of things in his room from tunnels for his trains to forts. The best thing<br/>
about them is they can get crushed, broken, etc. and we just make a new one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I really do not have any doubts as far as the academics go, but I do<br/>
&gt; wonder about the social development. Although I think being home would be<br/>
&gt; perfect for my child&#39;s temperament I do often get counter arguments from<br/>
&gt; other people. They argue that homeschooled children are very precious<br/>
 </span></blockquote>while<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; young, but they often turn into odd maladapted adults who struggle in<br/>
 </span></blockquote>their<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; relationships.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah yes, the ancient &quot;socialization&quot; question. And I suppose these people<br/>
know so many &quot;odd maladapted&quot; homeschooled adults themselves?? Snort.<br/>
There&#39;s a list on the internet, I think it&#39;s on the &quot;School is Dead, Learn<br/>
in Freedom&quot; site that lists all the famous homeschoolers, starting with<br/>
almost every one of our founding fathers (here in the U.S.). That&#39;s always a<br/>
good thing to have floating around in your head when you need to counter<br/>
this argument.<br/>
Long before I even had kids, I was a church youth group leader and I have to<br/>
say that the homeschooled teenagers I worked with got along great with their<br/>
peers. The only difference between them and the schooled kids is that they<br/>
were also able to carry on meaningful conversations with me (an adult)<br/>
without reverting to either subservience or rebellion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What do you do to ensure that your child&#39;s social development does not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fall<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; behind his peers at school??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The real question is what could I possibly do to my child so that their<br/>
social development was as bad as a kid who has been in school?? Kids in<br/>
school are &quot;socialized&quot; into a very narrow peer group, a group that, because<br/>
of its uniformity, causes strange cliques, pressures, and rules of<br/>
conformity to occur. Homeschooled kids are socialized into the real world,<br/>
where people of all ages work together, where you have value because of what<br/>
you do and who you are, not because you have the exact right pair of jeans<br/>
from The Gap, where you have freedom to choose many different paths instead<br/>
of a narrow set of social rules. In my day in highschool, you could be a<br/>
&quot;socie&quot;, a &quot;jock&quot; a &quot;doper&quot;, a &quot;punk&quot;, a &quot;nerd&quot;, or just plain labeled<br/>
&quot;weird&quot;, That was the sum total of your options. In the real<br/>
world, you can just be you.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line (to me) - let your kids pick their interests, help them<br/>
follow through on them, and chances are about 100% that these interests will<br/>
take them out into the world where they will interact with all kinds of<br/>
people, and become the truly social members of society that I would hope all<br/>
kids had the opportunity to become.<br/>
