&gt; &lt;&lt;I mean, you CAN say, &quot;We unschool except when we do school&quot; but how<br/>
&gt; much<br/>
&gt; sense does that make?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I never said that. &quot;DO SCHOOL&quot; to me means schedules, assignments, time<br/>
&gt; slots, grades, and all that junk.  I am more than justified calling<br/>
&gt; myself an unschooler even though I occasionally (I don&#39;t know, once a<br/>
&gt; week, twice a week?) ask my kids to fill out a math sheet whenever they<br/>
&gt; feel like it. I may even say that I want them to do it before bedtime. Or<br/>
&gt; lunchtime. or before they can get on the computer to play. My four year<br/>
&gt; old is just learning to read, and he LOVES to do workbooks and &#39;read&#39;<br/>
&gt; with me. If I say &quot;hey Kyson, come here with mom and do this sheet,<br/>
&gt; okay?&quot;, I can&#39;t be an unschooler???  to me, that is a far cry from<br/>
&gt; forced, scheduled work.  They are not forced, not stressed.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If I said to you, &quot;Do this before you can have lunch&quot; is that forcing you?<br/>
<br/>
Is the implication that they cannot have lunch, go to bed, or get on the<br/>
computer until the &quot;work&quot; you have assigned is completed? If you say, &quot;Do<br/>
this before lunch&quot; and they don&#39;t, what happens? I would assume you really<br/>
don&#39;t withhold food or bed (maybe the computer), so what happens? Is the<br/>
work waiting for the the next day? Are you disappointed in them? Do you try<br/>
to talk them into it?<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing wrong with an unschooled child loving to do workbooks. I<br/>
adore word search puzzles. But when one gets assigned these things, it<br/>
becomes, well, an assignment. And where are we assigned learning? In school.<br/>
Ergo, schooling is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Deb said it better anyway (paraphrasing): it doesn&#39;t matter whether it&#39;s<br/>
assigning math or assigning cloud-watching.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about who has the power over their own learning. If I am<br/>
assigning, I have the power. If my daughters are assigning themselves, THEY<br/>
have the power. If your workbook-loving son came to you and said, &quot;Hey Mom,<br/>
how about giving me some workbooks, I want to do that before lunch&quot; that&#39;s<br/>
the polar opposite of you saying to him, &quot;Do these before lunch&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about choices -- who has them and who makes them. It&#39;s also<br/>
about trust -- trust that a child will learn what he needs and wants to<br/>
learn when he needs and wants to learn it, not by anyone elses timetable,<br/>
just his own.<br/>
<br/>
I know that not every family is cut out for unschooling. There&#39;s no shame in<br/>
that. There&#39;s nothing wrong with hanging out with unschoolers, either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not cut out for non-coercive parenting. I look at it and I think,<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s cool. I wish I had the temperament for that&quot;. But I don&#39;t go around<br/>
calling myself an NCP parent, &quot;except that I make them brush their teeth<br/>
twice a day&quot;. That &quot;except&quot; is everything.<br/>
