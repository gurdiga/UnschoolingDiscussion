<div id="ygrps-yiv-91528831">My son is five years old and over the past year has become more and more<br/>
reluctant to leave the house.  Last summer we didn&#39;t go a lot of places, but<br/>
he&#39;d want to go to a park or bounce houses or my in-laws&#39; house or someplace<br/>
else fun maybe once or twice a<br/>
week.  During the winter the outings tapered off due to his<br/>
preference, and I thought it was because of the weather.<br/>
When it warmed up he began to play outside more, but other than<br/>
playing in our yard (and an occasional short walk down the block)<br/>
he&#39;s only been out of the house once in the past month.  The month before<br/>
that was probably twice.  When I ask him about it he says he&#39;s got games to<br/>
play at home and is too busy to go anywhere.  We have a small playground<br/>
within walking distance, and he doesn&#39;t want to go that far.<br/>
<br/>
I like to go places, and my 3-year-old daughter likes to go places, and<br/>
while we create opportunities to go out once a week or so and leave my son<br/>
at home with my husband, it doesn&#39;t seem to be enough for either one of us.<br/>
 We invite people over, and we also turn down a lot of invitations for<br/>
activities at other people&#39;s houses (or parks and the like).<br/>
<br/>
I worry that he&#39;s missing out on a lot of experiences by not going anywhere.<br/>
 I worry it won&#39;t pass and he&#39;ll never want to leave the house.  I know that<br/>
I&#39;m feeling stress over it.  I think that there would be more peace in our<br/>
house if the kids weren&#39;t home all day nearly every day.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
it&#39;s anxiety over seeing people he doesn&#39;t know, or if it&#39;s car sickness, or<br/>
if it&#39;s something else altogether.<br/>
<br/>
An example of a thing I&#39;d like to do:  my husband&#39;s sisters are coming to<br/>
town this weekend and will be at my in-laws&#39; house for a BBQ - I&#39;d like for<br/>
our family to be there.  My husband will likely go alone because the kids<br/>
will both want to be with me.<br/>
<br/>
The only other piece of information that might be relevant is that I&#39;m the<br/>
working parent, though I have a home office and see the kids throughout the<br/>
day.  When I&#39;m done working I want to spend time with both kids and feel<br/>
torn when my daughter wants to go somewhere, yet my son doesn&#39;t want to, and<br/>
they both want me to do things with them in the evenings.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what other details might help, so I&#39;ll stop here.  Any ideas on<br/>
how to maybe figure out what&#39;s underlying his reluctance to leave, or maybe<br/>
even thoughts on whether or not that&#39;s important.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505647133">-= I worry that he&#39;s missing out on a lot of experiences by not going<br/>
anywhere. =-   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My oldest, now 14, has never really liked going out places.  He really does<br/>
love being at home.  I have always done all I could to encourage but<br/>
hopefully without being pushy going out and doing new fun exciting things.<br/>
I&#39;ve even used McDonald&#39;s a few times for enticement when he was younger.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  I too always worried at least a little that he was missing out on<br/>
things and realized only the other day that I never really understood how he<br/>
could love being home so much of the time!   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Dd, now 12, always seemed to like going out and so we did as much as I could<br/>
and she seemed to like that.  So I really struggled and still do just a<br/>
tinge when things come up that she would have gone to in the past that she<br/>
now doesn&#39;t.  This began when ds was ready to be home on his own while dd<br/>
and I would go out.  Well she didn&#39;t want to go then either.  I knew they<br/>
were close but hadn&#39;t realized this would happen.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just the other day both my children and I ended up discussing &#39;my&#39;<br/>
fear/worry about them not getting out and doing things.  The conversation<br/>
started out about all these homeschool summer activities going on around<br/>
here that I felt maybe they should take advantage of and at least try.<br/>
Things mostly that we/they&#39;d not be able to do normally because of expense.<br/>
It didn&#39;t seem like such a big deal to me for them just to try one of two<br/>
things.  Well!  For the first time ever they turned it around on me and made<br/>
me realize it was really me that needed to work some thinking through not<br/>
them.  &lt;g&gt;   I can&#39;t say this is the entire deal but I now realize that I<br/>
wanted for them fond activities and memories like myself as a kid and that<br/>
was always away from home and my parents.  Home was just a place to sleep<br/>
and eat.  Home for them is totally different, much more than a place for<br/>
them to just eat and sleep.  :-)    I&#39;m suddenly starting to see the house<br/>
we live in in a different way than I used to.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One last thing, I read a book recently about a television/radio talkshow<br/>
host here in the UK.  His name is Jonathon Ross and he&#39;s about 40 now.  He<br/>
had many brothers and sisters and his parents felt they could not provide<br/>
the opportunities for their children that they would have liked to.  When he<br/>
was a young boy television here was just becoming popular and cheap enough<br/>
for the regular person to buy.  His parents totally believed in the power of<br/>
TV and they felt their kids would have so many opportunities seeing and<br/>
hearing about things they never could or did that way.  Jonathon says the TV<br/>
was almost always on even as background noise.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-932294674">My son is the same way and I have learned that it&#39;s because he gets car<br/>
sick, not just a little, he is out of commission for an hour or two after<br/>
riding in the car.  I have concerns about the missing exposure to people and<br/>
places but we do our best to have lots of people around us at home.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, though, if they want to be home and they are happy then it&#39;s<br/>
what they need.  He and I spend a lot of time together, talking, playing<br/>
video games, watching tv and movies.  In the course of that we talk about<br/>
people, places, cultures, ideas, etc and he seems to have a good grasp on it<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
He chats with people online in other countries and even manages to converse<br/>
with those who know little english.  Perhaps not knowing how this is<br/>
supposed to limit him makes it possible and, so far, all of my concerns have<br/>
been unnecessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775554446">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; One last thing, I read a book recently about a television/radio <br/>
talkshow<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; host here in the UK.  His name is Jonathon Ross and he&#39;s about 40 <br/>
&gt; now.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ready for a six degrees connection.<br/>
<br/>
I decorated sets on three occasions for &quot;An Evening at the Academy Awards <br/>
with Jonathon Ross&quot;, when the BBC was televising the Oscars. He was here in <br/>
LA and held interviews with different people all evening as they watched the <br/>
telecast - his program filled the commercial breaks for the no-commercial <br/>
BBC telecast.<br/>
<br/>
The repeat gig ended when they lost the contract (to Channel 4 I believe) <br/>
for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s very tall and very into purple.<br/>
<br/>
The first year I did it Jayn was a nursing toddler. I brought her with me, <br/>
and had a friend who knew her come and be the sitter with her, in the next <br/>
room. It was OK. The following year they told me I couldn&#39;t bring my baby to <br/>
the set anymore, because they were worried about insurance. That was OK too. <br/>
She came with me doing all my shopping but not to set. She visited for about <br/>
2 minutes with James then he took her away. She shopped the third year too, <br/>
and I worked it so that I wasn&#39;t there the night of the telecast. She was <br/>
much more patient in the car and visiting then (5 I think) than I think she <br/>
would be now, and she was content to have MacDonalds worked in to the day.<br/>
<br/>
The experience did make it very clear to me that the kind of work I used to <br/>
do and unschooling parenting were not particularly compatible. She had a <br/>
better time when she came to the theater with me, but I think again it was <br/>
because she was so little.<br/>
<br/>
I would say, in the absence of her friends for playdates, Jayn wants even <br/>
more of my attention now at 9, than she seemed to at 6. Maybe that&#39;s not <br/>
accurate, but my perception based on my belief that she &quot;should&quot; be more <br/>
capapble of entertaining herself at 9 than at 6. Maybe it&#39;s just the kind of <br/>
attention she wants is considerably more mentally demanding. She used to be <br/>
happy with me brushing the dolly&#39;s hair and zoneing out a bit while she <br/>
arranged them in rows with their teacups. Now she wants me to contribute <br/>
salient information and coherent dialog to the detective storyline the dolls <br/>
are enacting. (Meanwhile only she knows whodunit.)<br/>
<br/>
It was a long time ago now that Jayn stopped being interested in attending <br/>
home school park days other than the play activity after dance class on <br/>
Tuesdays. She is somewhat of a homebody, although perhaps not to the extent <br/>
of the OP&#39;s son. She is always on the lookout for our neighbors to play <br/>
with. She likes to go out to specific friends&#39; homes, rather than just go <br/>
out for the sake of it. If we had a large yard with gardening and a swing <br/>
set, she would probably want to go to the park even less. She likes theme <br/>
parks, and museums IF we are meeting her friends there.<br/>
<br/>
It also comes in waves. When we are on nights, there are few places to go. <br/>
We have a built in down time in our schedule. It&#39;s harder for you having a <br/>
second child with higher social, out and about needs. I don&#39;t know what to <br/>
suggest, other than to state the problem and ask them both for their ideas <br/>
on solving the issue.<br/>

we live in in a different way than I used to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I are going to Silver City today, and it&#39;s a five your  <br/>
drive, and I would rather stay home.  I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll have fun, but all  <br/>
things being equal, if they could be, I&#39;d WAY rather just be at my  <br/>
house.<br/>
<br/>
So I was wondering why I&#39;m willing to go to England and to Wales (to  <br/>
visit Joy in Wales, and meet these wise stay-at-home kids of hers  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  It&#39;s far enough to be really gone, maybe?  I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday Holly and I went to our get-out-of-court meeting (I&#39;ll write  <br/>
about that eventually), and I offered to get her a peach milk shake at  <br/>
Blake&#39;s Lotaburger.  We had seen the sign on the way there.    Or  <br/>
food.  She said no thanks, she wanted to go home and put her passport  <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
She likes to be home.  She likes to eat at home.  If I &quot;have to&quot; be  <br/>
home or I have to eat at home and we&#39;re not having company, it can  <br/>
seem like punishment, in the very back of my mind.<br/>
<br/>
These ideas don&#39;t even match.  I&#39;m just trying to report the emotions  <br/>
behind my wanting to be home and also my happiness in being able to  <br/>
eat or be elsewhere if I want to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about choices, but my kids&#39; choices don&#39;t have the overlays of  <br/>
reward or avoidance that mine seem to have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1413718050"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I too always worried at least a little that he was missing out on<br/>
&gt; things and realized only the other day that I never really understood how he<br/>
&gt; could love being home so much of the time!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes extroverted parents are rather hard on their introverted kids, <br/>
so my first thought was that you needed to adjust your expectations to <br/>
his personality and allow for him to be a homebody. But, only going out <br/>
of the house once in a month does sound like a pretty extreme aversion <br/>
to leaving the house, so maybe it is more than that he is introverted <br/>
and you&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;re just not offering him very fun options outside the house. <br/>
Also, going out to play in the yard is a lot different than going out to <br/>
go to the store or to someone else&#39;s house to have fun or to a movie or <br/>
an amusement park or to the park or the beach or a pool or other really <br/>
fun things. I have known kids who didn&#39;t play outside - all their <br/>
interests were indoors. That wouldn&#39;t worry me. I&#39;d worry about him <br/>
getting enough physical activity, but there are options for that either <br/>
indoors or going to parks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me, and I have no personal experience of this to base it on, so <br/>
just from an outside analytical perspective, that there could be a big <br/>
difference between wanting to stay home versus not wanting to go out.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is busy and happy and going out would interrupt his productive <br/>
joyful life, that&#39;s different than a kid being afraid or anxious about <br/>
going out.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;d think about how he is with other people when they come to his <br/>
own house. Does he enjoy having friends over sometimes? Does he interact <br/>
with the family?<br/>
<br/>
Also, not leaving the house except for once in a month, three times in <br/>
two months, does sound kind of extreme and I would also worry that he&#39;s <br/>
not getting the kind of experience of the world that I&#39;d want my kids to <br/>
have, so I think your concerns are reasonable. You can bring a lot of <br/>
the world to him, but taking him out into the world really is part of <br/>
unschooling. On the other hand, he&#39;s young and probably a very <br/>
introverted kid who doesn&#39;t have high social needs and it may be that he <br/>
simply has everything he needs right there to keep him blissfully happy. <br/>
If that&#39;s the case, I would probably, if I was his mom, entice him out <br/>
once a week or so because &quot;I&quot; would feel that he was missing out on <br/>
things - simple things like seeing the piles of fruits and veggies at <br/>
the grocery store or the big heavy machinery at a construction site or <br/>
cool things like a children&#39;s museum or hands-on science center or a <br/>
movie on a big screen in a theater, etc.<br/>
<br/>
How did it go the few times he has been out of the house? Where did you <br/>
go and how did he seem to feel about it at the time? Was he interested <br/>
in the world around hm? Did he socialize? Did he have fun? Or was he <br/>
anxious and thinking about getting back home? Are you worried that he <br/>
has developed agoraphobia?<br/>
<br/>
Also, was there a time when he used to like to go with you when you went <br/>
out? Did he ever ask to go when you were leaving to go to the grocery <br/>
store, for example? Is this a personality change or he&#39;s always been <br/>
like this?<br/>
<br/>
What if you were going out to someplace really fantastic - Disneyland, <br/>
for example? Would he want to go? What if you had a trampoline or a <br/>
swimming pool in your yard?<br/>
<br/>
No answers - but maybe the questions will help you think it through.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518762011">I think there&#39;s an amount of anxiety, but I can&#39;t pinpoint it, and he won&#39;t<br/>
discuss it.  I&#39;ve offered lots and lots of out of the house activities -<br/>
things that range from simple shopping trips to amusement parks to friends&#39;<br/>
houses (friends he likes, and his response is that they can come to our<br/>
house) to parks to grandparents&#39; house to McDonalds.  I started to feel like<br/>
I was pressuring too much, so lately I tell him where I&#39;m going, and ask if<br/>
he wants to come.  Or I&#39;ll tell him if something cool is going on (recently<br/>
he decided to skip a friend&#39;s birthday party) and let him decide if he wants<br/>
to go.<br/>
<br/>
He enjoys when people come here, but I can see that he gets easily<br/>
overwhelmed, so we space out visits and don&#39;t have more than one family over<br/>
at a time usually.  We have a mother&#39;s helper come once a week and he loves<br/>
playing with her, and seeks out a lot of adult interaction when we have<br/>
families over.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when he will say he wants to go somewhere, and then change<br/>
his mind as we&#39;re putting shoes on or getting in the van.  If I try to keep<br/>
momentum and encourage the trip, he gets very upset, and we will change our<br/>
plans because he is so distressed about having to go.  The 1-2 times I&#39;ve<br/>
forced it, I&#39;ve regretted it.  He frequently says he wants to do things, but<br/>
he doesn&#39;t want to actually follow through - within the past week he<br/>
mentioned wanting to go mini-golfing, and I&#39;ve said &quot;let&#39;s go&quot;, and he says<br/>
not now, maybe another day (and when I mention going another day, he says<br/>
&quot;no thank you&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
He seems to have fun when we go places - he&#39;s social, but is awkward at<br/>
engaging people - I stay close by to help.<br/>
<br/>
Another example - he&#39;s always loved fireworks, and they&#39;re happening tonight<br/>
nearby our house (about a 15 minute drive), and when I told him about them<br/>
he said that he wanted me or his dad to take video and pictures and come<br/>
back and show them to him - he does not want to go himself.  We&#39;ve seen<br/>
fireworks the past two years and he loved them both times.  There was a time<br/>
when he liked to go out, and his willingness to go along with us tapered off<br/>
over the past two years.<br/>
<br/>
He gets a lot of physical activity - we have an indoor trampoline, and a<br/>
slip-n-slide, and a good mattress for bouncing, and a swing set, and he<br/>
loves to battle with our pool noodle light sabers.  He seeks out physical<br/>
play (sometimes not in a respectful way), and I think that could decrease if<br/>
he were out and about more.<br/>
<br/>
I worry about him missing out on the kinds of things Pam mentioned.  And our<br/>
family doesn&#39;t get it either - their opinion is why would we let a<br/>
five-year-old dictate whether or not we&#39;ll be at a family BBQ.  They haven&#39;t<br/>
said it, but I think they blame us and think that if we made him go more<br/>
places then he wouldn&#39;t want to be home so much.  I don&#39;t know what else to<br/>
do to entice him though, and I don&#39;t like the idea of forcing it either.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re over, he doesn&#39;t *seem* to &quot;easily&quot;  overwhelmed-maybe one time, <br/>
right when we first started coming over. But any  more, it really just <br/>
seems like kids who are still learning how to socialize  with folks, adjusting <br/>
in the ways they know how. That being *said*, we don&#39;t  live with you. :~) <br/>
That&#39;s just our perception (Wyl and I), when we&#39;re  visiting.<br/>
 <br/>
I know when I&#39;m feeling anxious about an aspect of something  with my kids, <br/>
I can perceive my kids through a distorted lens-a lens that seems  to <br/>
magnify the things that are &quot;less positive&quot; and all but obliterates the  obvious <br/>
stuff. If I can realize that I&#39;m doing that, I can step back and set my  <br/>

 and see more clearly. I seem to have that happen more often when I&#39;m in <br/>
&quot;public  comparison&quot; places, like gymnastics, where there are general public <br/>
parents,  kids and coaches and lots of &quot;measuring up&quot; of kids skills and <br/>
abilities. I know  to be extra vigilant when I&#39;m there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; ------<br/>
&gt; He gets a lot of physical activity - we have an indoor trampoline, and a<br/>
&gt; slip-n-slide, and a good mattress for bouncing, and a swing set, and he<br/>
&gt; loves to battle with our pool noodle light sabers.  He seeks out physical<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although I try not to post here, I can&#39;t help feeling that your son sounds<br/>
very like my eldest daughter. I really hope your problems don&#39;t stem from<br/>
the same source but it might help someone if I mention it.<br/>
<br/>
Charlotte&#39;s reluctance to leave the house started at around the same age,<br/>
although at the time we put it down to a disastrous few months in school.<br/>
<br/>
We realised that some of it was a fear of getting lost - she would<br/>
occasionally go into a screaming panic if we were out and started to go home<br/>
a different way; she&#39;s gradually lost that fear but we stuck mostly to known<br/>
routes for two or three years.<br/>
<br/>
The other big thing turned out to be physical. We always thought she was<br/>
very active but as she grew older the difference between Charlotte&#39;s<br/>
&#39;active&#39; and everyone else&#39;s became obvious as she was stopping to rest<br/>
frequently in between bursts of activity. She ate well, slept well and was<br/>
slim, so we thought the amount of activity she was getting was right. Well,<br/>
it was, for her. She was also small for her age, but that again was<br/>
something which became more obvious as time went on.<br/>
<br/>
Then a few months ago she was diagnosed with a heart condition, which was<br/>
sapping her energy all the time. She was never really aware of how tired she<br/>
was because to her it was &#39;normal&#39; so she was unable to tell us there was<br/>
something wrong. Now I realise that trips out, however much she enjoyed<br/>
them, were generally just too physically stressful for her, though she was<br/>
never able to explain that.<br/>
<br/>
Since she had treatment she has become more adventurous, comes out with us<br/>
more willingly (though she&#39;s still a homebody) and even asks to go out. I<br/>
wonder if even her fear of getting lost was because she instinctively knew<br/>
she needed to nurse her energy.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s now nine and a half, I had a sneaking suspicion since she was tiny<br/>
that there was something wrong but it was easy to dismiss that when the<br/>
doctor told me she was healthy, until recently. Now on the other side I can<br/>
see such a huge difference I wonder how I missed seeing how ill she was but<br/>
it was just the way she was.<br/>

younger sibling?  I just thought I&#39;d bring it up, I know it&#39;s a lot<br/>
different when I have one child with me or both of them.  They both have<br/>
different ways of interacting and my 4yo son, who is extremely outgoing,<br/>
talks to everyone.  So, then, my 7yo  daughter feels a little put on the<br/>
spot because now she has sort of been thrown into a social situation.  Even<br/>
though she&#39;s more introverted, she&#39;s fine with it.  She likes to talk to<br/>
people, just not quite as much as her little brother does.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also, when my daughter was younger, we liked to just go and hang out<br/>
places.  Not really have an agenda, or any sort of &quot;thing to do&quot;.  We would<br/>
just go to the mall to do whatever she wanted to do there, sit and watch<br/>
people, walk around and look at things.  It kind of took the pressure off of<br/>
the outing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907071002">My Caleb (12) is a person who both loves home<br/>
and gets stressed when out and about--the<br/>
poster who distinguished those two made<br/>
a great point:  they are two different<br/>
issues--and he went through a period when<br/>
he really needed to be at home.  He was very <br/>
anxious at that time.  <br/>
<br/>
And we, too, had an extroverted child who needed to <br/>
be out and about.  We didn&#39;t go out as a family much <br/>
for awhile there; one parent would stay home with Caleb<br/>
and one would go out with Amelia.<br/>
<br/>
Caleb has strong interpersonal and intrapersonal skills, <br/>
and people are drawn to him.  When he was younger, that <br/>
felt like a burden to him.  He told me so.  I believed<br/>
him.  <br/>
<br/>
He preferred to stay at home not only because<br/>
home is safe and interesting and fun, but also <br/>
because he had a hard time not feeling other people&#39;s <br/>
feelings.  If anybody in the room had tense body language, <br/>
or was speaking in a less than gentle way... anywhere <br/>
around him; it didn&#39;t have to be in interaction with him... <br/>
he would empathize with that person to the extent that he <br/>
would feel their feelings.<br/>
<br/>
He still does that, but now he has a greater awareness of <br/>
doing it, and while he can&#39;t (yet?) NOT empathize to that <br/>
extent, the awareness does allow him to get out to do things <br/>
he really does want to do, like team gymnastics, or music <br/>
lessons, or public performances of his music, or skiing.<br/>
He plans on joining Civil Air Patrol this autumn; he wants<br/>
to get his pilot&#39;s license.  This is a young man who was<br/>
once so afraid of heights that he would not cross a bridge.<br/>
(And he crosses suspension bridges almost daily, too, to<br/>
go to the museum, or just to the hot truck for a bite to<br/>
eat.)<br/>
<br/>
He socializes easily with people of all ages, in the sense <br/>
that if I didn&#39;t tell you he was introverted, you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
know it.  He is very engaging and a great conversationalist; <br/>
people are very at ease around him.  But he is keenly aware <br/>
of everything that is going on around him, and he gets overstimulated, and then he needs to be home, alone, or with <br/>
just the quieter members of the family, to recharge his batteries.<br/>
<br/>
Another issue is transitions:  Many of us in this family<br/>
will continue what we are doing even when it has stopped <br/>
being joyful, when a change of pace or activity or scene<br/>
would feel good, because it can feel hard to stop, change <br/>
gears, prepare to do someting else, and then go and actually <br/>
do it.  All of us most always feel glad when we choose to make <br/>
the effort to switch gears, but it *is* an effort.  Increased awareness of that has also been helpful in going out, or<br/>
choosing not to.  We allow ourselves enough time to prepare<br/>
to segue from one thing to the next, and are gentle with our-<br/>
selves about the fact that it *is* challenging for us.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps to realize that being sensitive, or <br/>
introverted, or a homebody, is not a bad thing, not at all.  <br/>
OTOH, if your child is not just sensitive, but out-and-out<br/>
anxious, I would certainly do what I could to calm that.  <br/>
<br/>
Progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery meditation, <br/>
massage, warm baths, soothing music, cuddling his parents <br/>
and pets, and quiet nature walks all helped soothe Caleb <br/>
when he was your child&#39;s age.  They still do, but now he also <br/>
reads, watches a soothing TV show, or does martial arts forms, <br/>
or yoga, or plays a game, or a musical instrument.  He has<br/>
developed an awareness of which activity would be most calming,<br/>
but when he was younger, he needed me to try different things<br/>
for him to see what would help most.<br/>
<br/>
I understand about family judgements.  At the height of Caleb&#39;s anxiety, he would not cross a bridge.  Our town is criss-crossed<br/>
with gorges, so avoiding bridges is hard.  It meant driving miles <br/>
out of the way instead of taking a direct route.  Yes, I was <br/>
judged for letting a &quot;preschooler dictate&quot; (&lt;--not my words,<br/>
the critic&#39;s words) our route.<br/>
<br/>
When our family expanded and we were looking to buy a larger<br/>
house, we really liked one that sat right on a gorge, with a<br/>
view of a waterfall out the back windows and a view of the lake<br/>
in the valley below out the front windows.  You could hear the waterfall from the house, and that is a sound that I find very<br/>
soothing.  But Caleb was not at all comfortable about living on<br/>
a property that was situated on a cliff, so we didn&#39;t buy it.<br/>
Lots of people didn&#39;t understand listening to a child&#39;s<br/>
opinion on where to live.  But it was going to be his home!  <br/>
<br/>
I still one acquaintance who tells me that Caleb needs to go <br/>
to school to get over his shyness.  He&#39;s not shy, and he doesn&#39;t <br/>
need to go to school.  The fact is that her son is an unhappy kid, and finds Caleb&#39;s presence very soothing.  But Caleb finds the<br/>
interaction tiring, so Caleb doesn&#39;t like to spend much time with him, and so doesn&#39;t hang out with him much.  But she doesn&#39;t see <br/>
her son&#39;s unhappiness.  It is easier for her to label my son &quot;shy&quot; for turning down invitations.  <br/>
<br/>
I have had family not understand why I didn&#39;t want them to turn <br/>
on the News Hour in my home, in a room where my young children <br/>
were playing.  I&#39;ve had people comment that it&#39;s weird that<br/>
Caleb sometimes chooses to watch some movies with the sound <br/>
turned off and the closed captioning turned on.  It&#39;s not weird; <br/>
it&#39;s very healthy.  Caleb is aware that he is affected by <br/>
soundtracks--most of us are; that&#39;s why movies have &#39;em; but he <br/>
is *very* strongly emotionally affected by music--and so, if the music is pulling on his emotions, he will turn it off and choose <br/>
to read the dialogue.<br/>
<br/>
People may come around to understanding, or they may not.  <br/>
In our family, they mostly have.  It took time though.  (Heck, <br/>
we are still working on it ourselves, trying to parent,and to<br/>
live, more and more mindfully.)<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, Caleb has become a lot more involved in the world <br/>
beyond the walls of his home than I once thought might be possible.  I am happy about that, not because I think it is better, but<br/>
because I see that he is happily doing the things that he wants to <br/>
do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944186092">I was also thinking, at first, that some physical problem might be <br/>
present, but then the child was described as playing on the trampoline, <br/>
etc., and being very active, so that seems less likely to be the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I also knew a child with a heart condition that nobody recognized for a <br/>
long time and, interestingly, she also became very loathe to go places. <br/>
I&#39;m sure that being out and about just wasn&#39;t that much fun for her, <br/>
when she was exhausted all the time.So I think it is worth considering <br/>
the possibility of a physical problem.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about the descriptions of this particular 5 year old <br/>
and I&#39;m kind of thinking that the focus maybe is on the wrong thing - <br/>
maybe it isn&#39;t him not wanting to go out (especially since he says he <br/>
wants to go, at first, then back out at the time). Maybe it is that he <br/>
has a whole lot of inertia - a person who doesn&#39;t like to change where <br/>
they are and what they are doing. Maybe it would be worthwhile, at <br/>
least, to assume that is the real reason and come up with ways to <br/>
approach transitions that might work better for him.<br/>
<br/>
I had the opposite - really the exact opposite problem - with Roya (now <br/>
24).  She&#39;d be eager to get out the door, have a blast, but get very <br/>
anxious when we were turning the corner to our house and pulling in the <br/>
driveway. She wanted to know &quot;What are we doing next?&quot; The open, <br/>
unplanned time was hard for her to face. She really didn&#39;t have any <br/>
trouble filling it - she would go in and find all kinds of cool things <br/>
to do. But anticipating it was anxiety-provoking for her. It helped a <br/>
lot for me to have something planned for when she walked in the door. I <br/>
could say, &quot;When we get inside, Mr Rogers will be on if you want to <br/>
watch it.&quot; Or I could say, &quot;When we go in, will you get the legos out <br/>
and play with your sister for a few minutes?&quot; It didn&#39;t matter what it <br/>
was - just something to focus on was all she needed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there is anything in that which might help, but I do <br/>
recommend focusing on the possibility that it is transitions that are <br/>
hard for him, rather than being out. Difficulty with transitions is so <br/>
very common in young kids - people here will have all kind of ideas how <br/>
to make transitions more comfortable, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566162862">Here&#39;s another possibility to consider.  This happened in our family.   <br/>
When Zoe developed an extreme fear of throwing up along with it came  <br/>
fear of exposure to things that might make her sick, or might make  <br/>
somebody else sick.  If and when we did have her out and about in  <br/>
public places she would often grow panicky and request that we leave  <br/>
immediately.  She wouldn&#39;t say why she wanted to leave, and I hadn&#39;t  <br/>
quite figured out what was going on with her yet, so I&#39;d resist  <br/>
leaving, trying to persuade her to just put up with being wherever we  <br/>
were for just a little bit longer so the rest of the family could  <br/>
enjoy it.  The day she turned away from me and headed towards the car  <br/>
on her own, was the day I knew there was a force compelling her to get  <br/>
the heck out of there much stronger than my persuasive pleading.<br/>
<br/>
It took awhile but I started to connect the dots and when she stopped  <br/>
agreeing to go just about anywhere, even to places she used to love to  <br/>
go to -- like grandma and grandpa&#39;s house or the park to play with  <br/>
friends, I was able to talk to her about it and realized that she  <br/>
didn&#39;t trust me to take her need to leave a place seriously.  So, my  <br/>
husband and I started making contingent plans -- we never took her  <br/>
anywhere with us unless we had a plan for at least one of us to be  <br/>
able to leave with her.  Sometimes this required driving two cars to  <br/>
parties or family gatherings.  Then, if she started to get anxious and  <br/>
wanted to leave, one of us would exit immediately with her, no  <br/>
questions asked.  After we did this a few times she started to trust  <br/>
us again and she began agreeing to go out into public more often.  She  <br/>
still prefers to hang out at home but she is much more relaxed and  <br/>
even enjoys occasional outings for errands and social events now.<br/>
<br/>
Another discovery was that she gets nauseated riding in the car quite  <br/>
easily.  Sucking on a mint seems to help for short trips so I try to  <br/>
keep a stash in the car for her.  For longer trips, we make sure we  <br/>
keep the temperature comfortable, distract her with lots of  <br/>
entertainment, don&#39;t let her tummy get empty and make frequent stops.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few things to consider.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Two of my kids have been like this since they were very young.  Where ever<br/>
they are, that is where they want to be.  I have a few tactics that help<br/>
with this.  I always try to give them plenty of notice if we are going<br/>
somewhere.  That way they won&#39;t be in the middle of something when it is<br/>
time to leave.  I have told them on occasion that if we get there and they<br/>
aren&#39;t having fun, then we will leave (knowing that once we get there I will<br/>
have a hard time getting them to leave when it is time).  I also like to<br/>
borrow a line from Pippi Longstocking:  &quot;If we don&#39;t leave, we can&#39;t come<br/>
back&quot; (paraphrased).  Not in a threatening way, but rather as a truism.  My<br/>
kids get this.  It is impossible to come back to a place if you never leave<br/>
it.  I guess it has sort of turned into a joke in our family, but it helps<br/>
break the tension of not wanting to leave a place.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Also, when my boys first started having the option to stay home, they almost<br/>
always chose home in reaction to not having a choice in the past.  Now that<br/>
they have gone through that phase, they are able to make choices based on<br/>
whether they actually want to go.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Finally, my middle child has a lot of sensory issues, and that influences<br/>
whether he wants to go somewhere.  He doesn&#39;t like to be hot and sticky.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t like places that have a lot of noises competing with each other.  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t like fluorescent lighting.  The list goes on.  As he is getting<br/>
older, he is becoming better able to deal with sensory input - especially if<br/>
there is something he particularly wants to do.  He&#39;ll deal with the<br/>
florescent lighting in order to be able to look at toys in the store.  But<br/>
this is something I know about my son, and I plan outings to places that are<br/>
potentially unpleasant for him at a time when he will be able to stay home.<br/>

felt like a burden to him. He told me so. I believed<br/>
him. -=-<br/>
<br/>
After I read this I thought of saying my friend Annalize is that way!   <br/>
And I started to explain that her feelings are affected phyisically bu  <br/>
others&#39;--she will pick up their sorrow or agitation, but then you went  <br/>
on to explain that:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-He preferred to stay at home not only because<br/>
home is safe and interesting and fun, but also<br/>
because he had a hard time not feeling other people&#39;s<br/>
feelings. If anybody in the room had tense body language,<br/>
or was speaking in a less than gentle way... anywhere<br/>
around him; it didn&#39;t have to be in interaction with him...<br/>
he would empathize with that person to the extent that he<br/>
would feel their feelings.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the second part of it much, but I have have had people  <br/>
look at me and start telling me their life stories, or they&#39;ll come up  <br/>
to me when I&#39;m at a restaurant or in line at a store, and sometime get  <br/>
straight to divorce or death.   I took a one-day workshop one day and  <br/>
a woman offered me a ride home in her new Lexus.  We were very  <br/>
different kinds of people in just about every way, but she talked to  <br/>
me about her divorce and her fears.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe these people just really needed to talk and would&#39;ve found  <br/>
someone to talk to, but as it&#39;s happened since I was a kid, I think  <br/>
there&#39;s something about me in it too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He still does that, but now he has a greater awareness of<br/>
doing it, and while he can&#39;t (yet?) NOT empathize to that<br/>
extent, the awareness does allow him to get out to do things<br/>
he really does want to do, like team gymnastics, or music<br/>
lessons, or public performances of his music, or skiing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My friend is in her 40&#39;s now and doesn&#39;t know how to turn it off, and  <br/>
she&#39;s in the PhD program in communications and statistics at the  <br/>
university here, and so it&#39;s not like she hasn&#39;t had the stimulus,  <br/>
means or resources to consider it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He socializes easily with people of all ages, in the sense<br/>
that if I didn&#39;t tell you he was introverted, you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
know it. He is very engaging and a great conversationalist;<br/>
people are very at ease around him. But he is keenly aware<br/>
of everything that is going on around him, and he gets overstimulated,  <br/>
and then he needs to be home, alone, or with<br/>
just the quieter members of the family, to recharge his batteries.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly was mentioning just last night that her friend couldn&#39;t believe  <br/>
that Keith or Marty were introverts.<br/>
I was asked if Marty would MC the talent show for the Good Vibrations  <br/>
conference and I said he didn&#39;t want to (I knew but I asked him again  <br/>
to make sure), because doing it at Live and Learn stressed him out too  <br/>
much.   People raved and said he was great, but it was a big effort  <br/>
for him.  And he&#39;s not a pick-up-emotion guy, either, but he is an  <br/>
observe-more-than-most guy.   So my kids will do it as a group, and  <br/>
that way if one is getting stressed, another can pick up for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
When I realized that Keith couldn&#39;t stay at parties as long as I  <br/>
could, when we were in our 20&#39;s, we started finding ways to get around  <br/>
it.  He would pack the car, or go get ice for the party, or go outside  <br/>
and pick up cans or bottles or whatever useful thing he could do by  <br/>
himself while I said goodbye to people and got my last half hour of  <br/>
partying in, and then we&#39;d go.  Or he would get a ride home early, or  <br/>
I would stay and get a ride home later.<br/>
<br/>
When we have parties at our house, Keith just disappears around 10:30  <br/>
and the party continues for several hours more.<br/>
<br/>
If I tried to press him to socialize past his tolerance, or if he  <br/>
tried to make me stop just because he was done, we&#39;d probably not  <br/>
still be together after 30 years.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just the quieter members of the family, to recharge his batteries.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All of that would describe Chamille!  She&#39;s learning how to be more<br/>
social in group situations.  She pushes herself because she wants to,<br/>
then she goes home and dens up.  People have always been attracted to<br/>
her solid-ness, to her calm and quiet, to her listening and good<br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
We were having a conversation yesterday about this very thing!  I had<br/>
been talking to her boyfriend on the phone and he was telling me about<br/>
how different they are in this area.  He was saying how he&#39;s super<br/>
social, which I already knew, and that, thus far he&#39;s been<br/>
non-discriminating about who he hangs out with, any person will do. <br/>
Since he&#39;s been hanging out with Chamille a lot, he&#39;s finding out ways<br/>
to be more discriminating in a healthy way, and he&#39;s helping Chamille be<br/>
more comfortable just hanging out in groups of people.<br/>
<br/>
Since Chamille is really discriminating about who she hangs out with, it<br/>
becomes more about quality over quantity, as she gets older and meets<br/>
more people, she&#39;s starting to get a nice quantity of quality friends. <br/>
It makes her boyfriend feel special that she is choosing to hang out<br/>
with him, because he knows without a doubt that she can and does choose<br/>
to be by herself over hanging out with just anybody.<br/>
<br/>
I pointed out that I&#39;m more of a hang out with people kind of person, I<br/>
can be shy at first, but mostly I like to talk with people and hang out<br/>
and be very social, but that John really would prefer to be at home<br/>
doing his thing.  I go to a lot of outings without him.  He didn&#39;t even<br/>
go to the unschooling conference this year because he just couldn&#39;t<br/>
handle the social stuff at the time.  A few of the men at the conference<br/>
were asking about him, and after explaining why he wasn&#39;t there, most of<br/>
them told me that they felt the same way, but were pushing themselves<br/>
out of their comfort zones to be there and experience the conference. <br/>
They sent their well wishing on with me to extend to my husband.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille was telling me that sometimes Cyle&#39;s social-ness is<br/>
overwhelming, but she&#39;s finding ways to be ok with it, because she knows<br/>
that it&#39;s who he is as a person, so she&#39;s willing to accept that part of<br/>
him and find ways to work with it.  He is finding ways to get his social<br/>
stuff in and accept Chamille&#39;s need for quiet alone time, which he&#39;s<br/>
happy to be included in!  I find it all very fascinating, because I know<br/>
adults who can&#39;t seem to get this part of relationship stuff, that give<br/>
and take, and meeting people where they are at, and accepting the person<br/>
for who they are rather than changing them to be someone they are not to<br/>
meet their own needs.<br/>
<br/>
Their relationship is not like anything that I&#39;ve seen in young people. <br/>
I&#39;m still trying to figure out why it&#39;s so different.</div>

For example, last week I wanted to to the boys to a free summer movie and then use our free summer bowling coupons.  They did not want to do either.  I would have spent $4 on snacks at the movie and $4.50 on shoes for bowling.  We ended up adding movies to our Netflix account instead.  Sometimes we buy toys or kits or games or....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138414443">I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about the responses over the past couple of days.<br/>
<br/>
Pam mentioned that it might be about transitions, and I definitely think<br/>
that&#39;s part of it.  He used to really have a hard time leaving somewhere to<br/>
come home, that&#39;s not the case anymore.  If anyone has ideas for transitions<br/>
that we haven&#39;t tried, I&#39;d love to hear them - we always give a lot of<br/>
warning - he likes countdowns, so we usually give him a 20 min heads up,<br/>
then 10, then 5.  I&#39;ve tried to not do that, but he asks for it, so I do<br/>
it.  I&#39;ve offered to stop and get food, drinks, a new toy, a visit to a<br/>
favorite place, etc, along the way.  We have a DVD player in our van, so we<br/>
usually put a DVD in while we&#39;re driving, and anything that&#39;s portable I&#39;ll<br/>

anything that he&#39;s willing to leave the house for.  I&#39;ve tried really hard<br/>
(too hard I think) to get him to talk about it, and he doesn&#39;t.  He changes<br/>
the subject, he doesn&#39;t respond, or he agrees with whatever I&#39;ve said in a<br/>

Part of me is worried for him, but I also am very tense about not going<br/>

getting out of the house.  Mostly I like to get out of the house for a<br/>
change of atmosphere and because it changes the dynamics within our family.<br/>

keeping peace in the house when we don&#39;t go anywhere.  When we&#39;re at the<br/>
park or a friend&#39;s house the focus is shifted to new and different things (I<br/>
bring new things in often, as someone suggested, but it&#39;s not the same as<br/>
being out).  He and his sister generally get along, but when we&#39;re all in<br/>
the same space every day, all day, I notice that tensions start to run high,<br/>
and they fight more.<br/>

I appreciate any more ideas or food for thought folks have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434319065">Not sure if it&#39;s been said yet but you can support him while sharing with him that this is a family and we need to consider where others in the family would like to go and/or what they&#39;d like to do.  Doing an exchange-type thing seems to be helpful, though bear in mind the person who has to go where they don&#39;t want to isn&#39;t super happy about it (hey, sometimes they actually end up ENJOYING the place we&#39;ve gone that they SAID they would never enjoy!) but the important thing is that they know their want(s) has/have been considered.  So, to clarify, what I mean by &quot;exchange&quot; is saying &quot;We&#39;ll go to the store this morning to look for what you wanted and this afternoon will be your sister&#39;s turn to go to the park.  What would you like to bring to the park to make it more enjoyable for you?&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128369781">I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s a difference in your interactions with him when you&#39;re out? Are you less available? If you go to a park, are you playing WITH him, or do you sit on a bench while he plays?

That&#39;s something that just popped into my mind, as I read your last post, there might be a different quality to your interactions with him when you&#39;re out vs. when you&#39;re home.<br/>

****One thing I often notice is how I change while trying to get out of the house.  I HATE being late, which makes me very focused on getting out the door.  The boys often are not dressed hanging out in the house, so they need dressed, I always take snacks with us, and anything else I think we might possibly need.  It is great once we are gone as we are always well packed, but I get very focused on getting out of the house and I am not at my best with the boys.  Adding to the stress is the fact that the boys don&#39;t always want to follow through on plans, which somewhat eliminates my ability to get ready early.  <br/>
I would not be surprised if my boys sometimes want to avoid &quot;Focused Mom.&quot;  Although I have to say she does not come out nearly as often I she used to, I am learning which parts can be done early and how to take the stress out of the last minute items.<br/>

Same idea as Monkey Platters, each of us has a &quot;Monkey Box&quot;, a bento-style<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1331090761">-= So I was wondering why I&#39;m willing to go to England and to Wales (to <br/>
visit Joy in Wales, and meet these wise stay-at-home kids of hers <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). It&#39;s far enough to be really gone, maybe? I&#39;m not sure. =-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying pondering this question and not just because Sandra said<br/>
my children were wise.  &lt;g&gt;    One of the reasons I&#39;ve been thinking about<br/>
this is that we haven&#39;t made our holiday plans/bookings yet this year like<br/>
many people here in the UK probably did in Jan. or Feb and we&#39;ve been<br/>
discussing where everyone would enjoy going most atm.    The other day dd<br/>
wanted to know about Slovenia and thought it might be nice to go there.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think we&#39;re ready for there yet as a family but maybe we will be in a<br/>
year or two.  <br/>
<br/>
2 years ago our family went on our first full 2 week holiday.  I knew if I<br/>
wanted to travel again and have everyone be at least ok with going somewhere<br/>
again I needed this trip to be as easy going and fun as possible for<br/>
everyone.   Thankfully it worked out even better than I&#39;d planned for with<br/>
the things the northern part of France had to offer.   WWII unexpectedly<br/>
became more than just history online or in a book somewhere, as it was an<br/>
interest even if just a little that we all had we went with it.  I&#39;d never<br/>
thought about how the old abandoned bunkers and other military buildings<br/>
from the war are still everywhere.  So many other things to see as well left<br/>
from that time, out for all to see.  Some of the old war buildings are now<br/>
museums too, wonderfully non glossy - simple, and inexpensive.  One old<br/>
lookout/firing bunker had even since crashed down from a hillside onto the<br/>
beach and the way it fell one could still walk up some stairs inside and<br/>
look across the beach.  It reminded me of the movie planet of apes where the<br/>
statue of liberty is in the sand, only this was real.  I felt this urge to<br/>
get down on my knees in the sand in front of it but resisted.  ;) <br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m thinking before unschooling I would never have had such a holiday.  Or<br/>
if we did we wouldn&#39;t have enjoyed ourselves so much.  We never made it to<br/>
the Disney Park outside Paris.   We probably will check out Parc Asterix<br/>
next time we go to France though.  Since our trip the kids were really into<br/>
the books for awhile and most French people would probably say to visit Parc<br/>
Asterix before the Disney one!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
