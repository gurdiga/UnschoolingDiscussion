<div id="ygrps-yiv-225313937">About &quot;Whole Child, Whole Parent&quot; Sandra said:<br/>
&quot;It probably is.  I&#39;m sorry.  So never mind that one.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I bet this is never going to happen again...but I finally get to say this:<br/>
DON&#39;T LISTEN TO SANDRA!!  Ok there. That was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, just couldn&#39;t resist.:)<br/>
<br/>
I bought my copy of &quot;Whole Child, Whole Parent&quot; from half.com, but they&#39;re gone now. I imagine Amazon or Ebay would have one fairly inexpensive. It&#39;s an awesome book. Get it!<br/>
