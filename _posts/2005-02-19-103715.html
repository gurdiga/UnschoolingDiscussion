<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658598159">&quot;There&#39;s that father&#39;s day saying about lots of men are fathers, but only  the <br/>
special ones are daddies (or some such).   There are other  denotations for <br/>
male parents.  &quot;Sperm donor&quot; isn&#39;t a very nice one.<br/>

There are some &quot;parents&quot; who don&#39;t deserve a nicer term.  My son&#39;s male &quot;contributor&quot; was never a &quot;father&quot; or a &quot;daddy,&quot; and I won&#39;t refer to him as such.  I have a good friend (male) who has custody of his son, with the same sort of situation.  It can go both ways.  I would consider it demeaning to the &quot;real fathers/daddys&quot; out there to call my son&#39;s &quot;sperm donor&quot; a father.<br/>

Right.  And that&#39;s what connotation is all about.<br/>
To say &quot;manipulation&quot; instead of &quot;counsel&quot; or &quot;influence&quot; is done with purposeful intent. <br/>
