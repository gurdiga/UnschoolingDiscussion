<div id="ygrps-yiv-466890900">&lt;&lt;You seem to be saying that we should just accept ourselves&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is EXACTLY what I&#39;m saying.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And not try to improve ourselves&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t even imply that.  I am saying that just because something is hard,<br/>
that you do poorly at something, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there is anything<br/>
wrong with you.  Just because you are &quot;wired&quot; different than some mythical<br/>
&quot;median normal&quot; person is &quot;wired&quot;, doesn&#39;t necessarily mean there is<br/>
anything wrong with you.  Improve away, work away, do whatever you think<br/>
will work for you.  But the term disability strongly implies that there is<br/>
something inherently wrong with the person and I can&#39;t bring myself to<br/>
believe that different equals disabled.<br/>

with calling someone disabled.  In the case of dyslexia, which <br/>
started this thread, expecting a dyslexic to learn to read without <br/>
any input from others is like expecting a blind person to learn <br/>
braille without any input.  Sure, eventually that blind person will <br/>
stumble on braille by himself, but wouldn&#39;t it be much easier if <br/>
someone said, &quot;Hey, there&#39;s this thing that might work for you, you <br/>
want to try it?&quot;  So why shouldn&#39;t a person who suspects dyslexia <br/>
look into the research and the methods others have found and use them?<br/>
<br/>
And before you start saying that I&#39;m equating dyslexia and blindness <br/>
and therefore calling dyslexics disables, define disabled?  My cousin <br/>
is blind and the reason why I thought of the analogy.  He has <br/>
accomplished way more in this lifetime than I could ever hope to, so <br/>
which of us is disabled?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-243163549">You don&#39;t have to be labeled &quot;disabled&quot; because you find out that you might<br/>
have something that &quot;can be&quot; a disability.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, isn&#39;t that one of the great things about unschooling?  Not having<br/>
to accept the labels that ps would put on one?<br/>
<br/>
And, part of the origin of this discussion was that I said that there is<br/>
&quot;real&quot; dyslexia vs. all the non-professional diagnosing and labeling that<br/>
goes on in schools.  I haven&#39;t figured out yet why folks would want to hang<br/>
onto using a label if they don&#39;t have to but that would seem to be what is<br/>
happening here.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing what a &quot;problem&quot; or &quot;obsticule&quot; is that &quot;might&quot; place a hurtle in<br/>
ones path to learning something is NOT a bad thing.  The bad thing is not<br/>
knowing and being frustrated or allowing it to limit one.<br/>

with the bathwater going on here.  Just because you don&#39;t like the <br/>
way our current establishment uses the labels, does not mean you <br/>
can&#39;t use the available tools to solve problems. <br/>
