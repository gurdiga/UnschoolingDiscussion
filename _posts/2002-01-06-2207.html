<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342761457">I second a warm welcome to anyone coming to the San Antonio area.  We know<br/>
absolutely no other unschoolers here in the land of &quot;school at home&quot; and<br/>
would love to open our home to any and all from the list.<br/>
<br/>
Julie--who doesn&#39;t have a porch either (maybe the goat barn would do if we<br/>
closed our eyes and thought happy thoughts &lt;grin&gt;)</div>
