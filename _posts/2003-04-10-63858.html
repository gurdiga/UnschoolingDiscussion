 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just gonna talk about this part. First of all, I think he is too young<br/>
to worry (not yet 6 right?). Second, you CAN probably still use the speech<br/>
therapy at the school if you want to. Third, most speech things go away all<br/>
by themselves. Quinn has had quite a few things - now that he is nine they<br/>
are almost all gone, except for the &quot;th&quot; sometimes, and I know this will<br/>
disappear when he is reading and sees how words are spelled.<br/>

Until she said it yesterday I didn&#39;t even think of it as a problem. <br/>
<br/>
The thing she sees as a problem is he can&#39;t make the S sound if it&#39;s followed by a hard sound. Snake comes out nake, things like that, now if he tries real hard he can do it but complains about it hurting. He has a big toung and a small mouth, Jason said he had the same thing as a child and he grew out of it as he got bigger, he still slurs a little but it&#39;s rarely noticable.<br/>
