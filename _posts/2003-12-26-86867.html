<div id="ygrps-yiv-773481219">As I&#39;ve been sitting here posting I realized why this thread is making me<br/>
nuts (ok not really, just everybody at my house is gone for many days and<br/>
I&#39;m already bored).<br/>
<br/>
I used to work as a psychologist and I repeatedly saw therapists take things<br/>
that had correlations (like having many tattoos and antisocial personality<br/>
traits) and treating them as if the correlation were 100%.  You have 7<br/>
tattoos, bet you have Borderline Personality.  You have 9 tattoos, bet you<br/>
have Antisocial Personality.  Rather than seeing tattoos or whatever as<br/>
possible indicators, they were seen and treated as diagnostic tests.<br/>
<br/>
In my perception, the &quot;have to&quot; statements on this list have been treated<br/>
the same way.  A poster would use &quot;have to&quot; as some short-hand answer and be<br/>
questioned about it (which I think is positive) but then no matter how often<br/>
she said &quot;no, really, its not like that&quot;, she was told &quot;I bet it is.&quot;<br/>
However, it may just be my perception due to sore spots with the above<br/>
issues.  I&#39;ll think on it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I agree that teaching and learning are 2 different things but that they<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; happen simultaneously, even within the same person.  I always understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; karate better when I am teaching it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I understand unschooling better each time I try to explain it to someone<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; basic terms.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But does discussing when learning can come from teaching help anyone<br/>
&gt; understand unschooling? Or does it make it more confusing?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When people new to unschooling bring up teaching, they are thinking in<br/>
terms<br/>
&gt; of the teacher as separate from the learner. Helping people picture how a<br/>
&gt; teacher can learn while teaching doesn&#39;t help someone figure out how to<br/>
&gt; &quot;get&quot; (since that may be their mindset at the time) their kids to learn.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s an answer to a question they aren&#39;t asking. In fact it&#39;s an answer<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; looks like it suggests that teaching a child is still okay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just because a point of view is true, doesn&#39;t mean discussing it helps<br/>
&gt; someone understand unschooling. It *is* often hard to keep in mind how a<br/>
&gt; discussion will affect someone who is trying to understand unschooling but<br/>
&gt; that *is* the purpose of the list.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; However, I don&#39;t agree that &quot;have to&quot; and &quot;choose to&quot; are necessarily on<br/>
&gt; &gt; different planes because what people have said over and over (not just<br/>
me)<br/>
&gt; &gt; is that they made the original choice and see it as very much a choice,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; to keep that choice alive they &quot;have to&quot; do particular things. IF they<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; &gt; a black belt, they MUST train.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How does discussing that help anyone unschool? That probably sounds like a<br/>
&gt; snarky question, like it&#39;s code to say &quot;Shut up about this subject.&quot; But<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a serious question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I want to get to some place that&#39;s 30 minutes away, I have to leave at<br/>
&gt; least 30 mintues before I want to get there. It&#39;s just reality.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Well I could speed if my estimate of 30 minutes is based on going at the<br/>
&gt; speed limit, but at some point that won&#39;t make up for real life<br/>
&gt; limitations.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I want to unschool, I have to give up certain things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But people don&#39;t bring problems to the list that are based on not being<br/>
able<br/>
&gt; to recognize when they have to do something. The problems they bring are<br/>
&gt; based on thinking they have to and not being able to recognize when they<br/>
&gt; have a choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So can you bring up examples of when people&#39;s understanding of unschooling<br/>
&gt; was hampered by not being able to recognize that reality has limitations?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In this situation, to discuss it from an unschooling point of view, there<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t anything that was clearer when expressed as have to. The have tos<br/>
&gt; were limiting and suggestive to those still stuck with a lot of &quot;have tos&quot;<br/>
&gt; in their lives that there was some pressure that was necessary for<br/>
learning.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When problems are discussed on the list, the discussion is done with the<br/>
&gt; idea that many people are reading along. If someone chooses to say<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; a certain way that will make understanding unschooling confusing for<br/>
others,<br/>
&gt; then it&#39;s going to be pulled out an examined.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380420689">For some it may be a lingo that they are accustomed to but if one is on a <br/>
list long enough they know the buzz words.  It&#39;s also not just the buzz words it <br/>
is the delivery.  For the main radical topic there have been over 40 posts on <br/>
it I suspect the drawing has been finished and etched in the minds of many.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it was because she was 1) not recognizing why people were reading<br/>
&quot;have to&quot; into what she was writing and 2) not recognizing where she was<br/>
contradicting herself.<br/>
<br/>
Conversations should never be about a person, only about the ideas a person<br/>
brings. It doesn&#39;t make for useful discussions for people to individually<br/>
guess that even though someone is using words that are contradictory that<br/>
what is really happening in their lives is not contradictory.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t discuss posters lives. I can only discuss the picture their words<br/>
create. If someone is creating a contradictory image on the list, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
do anyone on the list who is trying to understand unschooling any favors if<br/>
people who are explaining unschooling to assume that contradictory<br/>
statements are just their way of writing and don&#39;t reflect what&#39;s going on<br/>
in their lives. <br/>
