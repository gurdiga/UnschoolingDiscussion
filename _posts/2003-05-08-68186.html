  I&#39;m trying to figure out how old Abigail is ( OK..poem writtin in 1994 when <br/>
she was 5, that means she was born in 1989.. sooo)She is 13! , or close to <br/>
it.  Anna is 13 too.. lol, makes the math easier for me.   I think Landon was <br/>
about 13 when he discovered the Starlite Cafe web site. <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thestarlitecafe.com/)">http://www.thestarlitecafe.com/)</a> Its a poetry website where lots of writers <br/>
share their stuff.. message boards and such too.  I know alot of the content <br/>
on there is &quot;adult&quot;  (not necessarily pornographic) but written by adults.   <br/>
You may want to check it out, it might be something she would enjoy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811842000">Lemme see here. How&#39;d the math come out so strange?<br/>
<br/>
Abbie is 15, born in 88, january. I&#39;m thinking, we submitted the poem <br/>
right after her 5th b-day, in 1993, but it was&#39;nt published until the <br/>
following year. magazines are ready several months in advance of <br/>
their issue...<br/>
<br/>
but if she&#39;d been five in 94, her bday would have been 89, not 88<br/>
<br/>
and your math would be closer.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m checking into that poetry site!thanks<br/>
