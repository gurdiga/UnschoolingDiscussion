In response to this comment:<br/>

supporters and facilitators?  Are we co-conspirators in the joy of living?<br/>
Or are we on another team than our kids are on?  Are we working against them<br/>
rather than with them?  Who is in charge of us? of the kids?  Vital<br/>
questions.&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes! My questions exactly (amongst 1000 or so others...)<br/>
I have been unschooling now for 5 months (we were laid-back, unstructured<br/>
homeschoolers before), and have been diligently doing my &#39;&#39;homework&#39;&#39;,<br/>
wading through copious mails on both Unschooling.com and AlwaysLearning in<br/>
search of the really good unschooling stuff that comes up every now and<br/>
then. I have read John Holt&#39;s &#39;How Children Learn&#39; and &#39;How Children Fail&#39;<br/>
and &#39;Learning All the Time&#39;. What I have seen in my children convinces me<br/>
that I am on the right track.<br/>
BUT:<br/>
I want to know how you experienced unschoolers see yourselves and your roles<br/>
in your children&#39;s lives. So much of what seemed to be my role in the past<br/>
is changing. It is quite challenging seeing the new modus operandi. I should<br/>
mention that I am a Christian, and this remains bottom line for me. I want<br/>
to know how Unschooling Christian parenting looks. (And whether I am<br/>
becoming anything like it!!!!!!!!!!!)<br/>
Opinions? Thoughts? Ideas?<br/>
Regards<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see myself as a facilitator.  My child wants to learn about the world; as<br/>
a parent, it&#39;s my job to help him do that.   We don&#39;t have the adversarial<br/>
relationship we had when he was in school, and it seemed my job was to force<br/>
him to do reams of meaningless homework every night.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all in this together.  I&#39;m older and have more experience as well as<br/>
the legal responsibility for the children, so they have to defer to my<br/>
judgement in some areas.  They&#39;re young and excited about learning and I<br/>
defer to their wishes about their education, finding that all those<br/>
mysterious &quot;gaps&quot; that educrats worry about fill in over time.  It&#39;s amazing<br/>
how little time it takes a child to learn a new subject, when it&#39;s his idea<br/>
and he&#39;s enthusiastic about it.<br/>
<br/>
That was brought to mind recently, when my 13yo Moose joined a Stock Market<br/>
Game team.  He did it mostly because a couple of his friends were on the<br/>
team and asked; he didn&#39;t really have a lot of interest in the stock<br/>
market - but whoa!  He has taken off with this interest!  Now the first<br/>
thing he reads after the comics is the business section.  He follows &quot;his<br/>
stocks&quot; (the ones his team purchased) daily.  He talks with his Dad about<br/>
investing and what he thinks might be good stocks.  He gets on the Internet<br/>
and looks up stocks and their performance, hunts down bits of information<br/>
about companies he thinks might work in their portfolio, and joins<br/>
enthusiastically in their twice-weekly on-line chats about possible new<br/>
purchases.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s unschooling at its finest - and he&#39;s learning a lot about economics,<br/>
about how world events affect the stock market, about profit-and-loss<br/>
statements, different kinds of businesses (corporations, sole<br/>
proprietorships, limited partnerships).  He&#39;s learning about taxes and why<br/>
government imposes them and how they are used.  Wow.  I didn&#39;t expect this,<br/>
but it&#39;s one of the best things he&#39;s done, in terms of education for the<br/>
real world.<br/>
<br/>
As for Christian Unschooling, let me refer you to Jeanne Musfeldt&#39;s page:<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s one of the finest Christian unschoolers I know, and a great human<br/>
being as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180191105">Cathy, I am not an experienced unschooler, but I have been learning a lot<br/>
and fast since deciding to become one just this last year.  I know you<br/>
have a lot of answers to your question about the role of parents in<br/>
unschooling already, but I want to answer it in terms of you being a<br/>
Christian.  The Bible says to share your experiences of witnessing God in<br/>
action in your personal life with other people, including your children. <br/>
Also, the Bible says to not cause your children to be discouraged.  I<br/>
think that means we should encourage them instead of focusing on their<br/>
mistakes.  It also says that God wants the hearts of the parents to be<br/>
turned to their children.  I think that means to really listen to them<br/>
and know them.  And when the Bible says to raise up a child in the way he<br/>
should go, it means according to his god-given natural bent, which is<br/>
what unschooling is all about.  Also, though we have authority over our<br/>
children, the Biblical purpose for authority is to protect and care for<br/>
others.  When the Bible talks about a minister managing his family, I<br/>
used to think it meant he had to have a firm hand on the kids.  But after<br/>
praying about this, I realized that a father cannot force his children to<br/>
respect him.  So now that scripture means to me that he is taking the<br/>
time to know his children and to spend time with them, so they respect<br/>
him.  And it also says to me that God cares so much about the man&#39;s<br/>
family that it should come first before his public ministry.  To me,<br/>
Christian unschooling means being real.  It is all about being honest<br/>
about who I am with my children and allowing them to be honest with me<br/>
about who they are, without fear of wrath.  I have also been learning a<br/>
lot from sources outside the church, which was scary at first because I<br/>
was concerned about ungodly counsel.  But everything I learned<br/>
corresponded with my Bible reading.  I found particular help from a book<br/>
called How to Talk So Kids Will Listen and How to Listen So Kids Will<br/>
Talk.  Jesus said that the gentile rulers lord it over them but that we<br/>
are God&#39;s children and should lead by serving.  I was raised by an<br/>
abusive mother who exercised her will over mine by controlling force. <br/>
Now I am learning about Christlike authority and giving up control and<br/>
using respectful techniques to communicate with, not dominate my<br/>
children.  I am having a wonderful journey.  It is hard sometimes to try<br/>
new ways, but persevere because it is so worth it!<br/>
