<div id="ygrps-yiv-79754335"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t like jokes at children&#39;s expense either.  Some people call it<br/>
&gt;teasing, but if it is something you would not do to an adult, than it is<br/>
&gt;an abuse of power.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I was raised with a lot of sarcasm, and sometimes find myself using it. <br/>
&gt;I really have to work on that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sarcasm is great, in moderation.  Teasing is fine too.  I live in a house<br/>
full of smartasses.  The problem comes, in my opinion, when we have another<br/>
set of rules for children than for the rest of the world.  When we say<br/>
something to kids that would be considered rude were we speaking to an<br/>
adult, that is an abuse of power.  It&#39;s like the whole &quot;Easy Answers&quot;<br/>
thread, and how would you feel is someone told you to &quot;Go look it up&quot;??<br/>
<br/>
I try to evaluate how I speak to children, including my own, based on how I<br/>
would want to be spoken to or how I speak to other adults.  I am constantly<br/>
seeing kids get ignored, told to &quot;shut up,&quot; spoken to in rude tones, etc.<br/>
Kids are still in the process of being socialized, and yes, they do rude<br/>
things and behave in ways that adults would not.  All the more reason for<br/>
us to show them by example how they should treat others.  &quot;Two wrongs do<br/>
not make a right&quot; and all that.<br/>

I come from a long line of tongue in cheek smartasses. My kids inherited it. <br/>
I do believe it is hereditary. My sisters and brother all have the same sense <br/>
if humor and they really are funny. I don&#39;t know what is meant by teasing. I <br/>
hate the stuff the younger two do to each other that always ends up in a <br/>
fight. We use light teasing or humor to get through life here. I prefer it to <br/>
crying. LOL<br/>

&gt;Laura<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By &quot;teasing&quot; I mean good natured teasing.  The kind of light hearted humor<br/>
that reminds us not to take ourselves too seriously.  I don&#39;t mean<br/>
tormenting others or exploiting someone&#39;s pet peeves, flaws or<br/>
idiosyncrasies.  I think that children often do this (particularly to each<br/>
other) because they lack the finess or experience to temper their humor<br/>
with kindness.  Perhaps there is also something of the psychology of power<br/>
struggles between siblings in it as well?  Kids also get a lot of bad<br/>
examples from popular media and peers, as there are a lot of &quot;jokes&quot; flung<br/>
around at other people&#39;s expense.  Not in good taste, in my opinion.  This<br/>
is another example of how kids can benefit by having role models and<br/>
caregivers model better behavior and ways of expressing yourself which does<br/>
not step on someone else.<br/>

I agree with you Nanci. We don&#39;t allow Simpson&#39;s type remarks, nor do I like <br/>
a lot of the flip remarks my teenagers come off with like &quot;whatever&quot;. They <br/>
learn pretty quil what is not acceptable.<br/>
