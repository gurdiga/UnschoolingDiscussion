&lt;&lt; I hate this!  First of all they are getting ready to move and the mom<br/>
had already told me that they would be stopping the school at home<br/>
bull.  Second, we hardly ever get to see them anymore because they do<br/>
school at home and are getting ready to move.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

There have been a couple of times when I&#39;ve protested cancellations like <br/>
this.  Once for the boys and once for Holly.  What I said was &quot;Holly has been <br/>
really looking forward to this, and it seems unfair to punish her too.&quot;  Or <br/>
appropriate other names.<br/>

Maybe you should do that.  Worst that could happen would be the other family <br/>
would keep as is.  BEST is they would go AND change.<br/>
