<br/>
Are you in the Chicago area?  I didn&#39;t know that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure on the exact dates,  we&#39;re trying to figure that out,  probably around August 18th,  maybe.   We havn&#39;t booked our hotels yet,  I want to try priceline on that.  I think we&#39;ll stay for a couple of days in that area, since there is so much.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are: ds 10, dd 8, dd 6.<br/>
<br/>
Would you e-mail me off line?   I couldn&#39;t find your address,  mine:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tktraas@...">tktraas@...</a><br/>

you!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost impossible to get lost in downtown Chicago, it&#39;s on a grid <br/>
system.  The field museum is fun, so is the museum of science and industry.  <br/>
Depending on the age of your kids, the Art Institute and the Shedd Aquarium and Adler <br/>
Planetarium can also be fun.<br/>
<br/>
There are the beaches, the ball parks, the zoos.  The Botanic Gardens has had <br/>
a miniature train exhibit for the last few years beginning in early June.  <br/>
There&#39;s a river preservation group that puts on river walks that I did one year <br/>
- they were really interesting.  Speaking of which, the downtown boat rides <br/>
can be fun too.  Navy Pier is a bit too crowded and crazy for me and my kids, <br/>
but lots of folks like it.  Rollerblading or biking on the lakefront bike path.  <br/>
Rent a car and take a trip to the Indiana Dunes.  There are lots of suburban <br/>
things to do too.  The Tribune puts out a list of all the street fairs and <br/>
festivals throughout the summer.  Grant Park has a concert series, as does <br/>
Ravinia.  All that and we have the hazing high school seniors, Sammy Soza corking <br/>
his bat and some guy in the suburbs selling Prairie dogs carrying the monkey pox <br/>
virus!  What more could you want?<br/>
<br/>
Did that help?  Were there other questions I missed on the original post?<br/>
