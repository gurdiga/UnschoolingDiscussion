There is actually talk of a spin-off.  I hope not; that would really ruin it. <br/>
IMO.  I feel a little better that I&#39;m not the only adult who finds the show <br/>
so appealing!<br/>

by them.  (Ok, so some of them are MY fault, as I&#39;ve loaned out the Season<br/>
1-3 DVD&#39;s.)<br/>

I got my Buffy season 2 disks back from my brother last night.  We<br/>
amused ourselves this morning watching them with English subtitles and<br/>
switching the spoken language back and forth between English and French,<br/>
often in midsentence.  (My son started it, but I had a lot of fun with it.)<br/>

PS  For those who have never watched Buffy or Angel, you can get them<br/>
(up to a point) from Netflix, one disk at a time. (One disk will have 3<br/>
or 4 episodes.) <br/>
<br/>
Buffy has the distinction of being the most disapproved of TV show by<br/>
some watchdog parents group, for those of you looking for a reason to<br/>
watch it. &lt;eg&gt;</div>
