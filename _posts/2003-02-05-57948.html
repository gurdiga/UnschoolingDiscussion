 </span></blockquote>Well, thats the problem.. She does NOT want to leave her house.. I know she <br/>
feels like, she&#39;s lost her husband, she doesnt want to lose EVERYTHING this <br/>
is hers.. But, its not really feasible for her children to continue to rotate <br/>
staying with her.  They love her and they want her to be happy and healthy, <br/>
but its not really fair to give up thier lives, their spouses, jobs, <br/>
children, grandchildren.   Every one of her 6 remaining children (oldest <br/>
daughter died of ovarian cancer at 63) would gladly, happily take her to <br/>
thier home.. even rotating among families would be good.  As of now, we just <br/>
dont know. Several of the grandchildren ( myself included) have offered to <br/>
stay with her as much as we can.. Mom said IF Grandma wont leave, then the <br/>
grandchildren will have to pitch in too..   Its going to be tought.. thanks <br/>
for your thoughts<br/>

Does your Grandma need someone staying with her all the time, or does she <br/>
just need some help? My Grandma has an aide who comes every weekday for a <br/>
couple hours. She cleans, cooks, talks. Family drops by to visit, do the <br/>
shopping, and do the heavy work regularly. When she first started having the <br/>
woman come in she wouldn&#39;t let her actually DO much but she&#39;s since seen the <br/>
benefits of laying down the load. :) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is a good idea.  I think, that right now, with Grandpa&#39;s death so fresh, <br/>
Grandma just needs someone around for company.   She cant bear the emotional <br/>
pain of being totally alone.. Especially at night. ..Her health is not <br/>
particularly bad... She is diabetic, but that is under control.  She&#39;s very <br/>
active and mobile for her age ( 84)  Its just that she wants/needs someone <br/>
with in her grief.   <br/>
