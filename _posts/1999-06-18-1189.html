<div id="ygrps-yiv-1632515624">Could somebody help me out here. For some reason I haven&#39;t gotten any new e-mails<br/>
from the list. Could someone send me an e-mail to my personal account ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:tbone@...">tbone@...</a><br/>
) and let me know if ya&#39;ll are posting or not. If you are, does anyone have<br/>
any ideas as to why I am not getting them?<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Tanya in WA (state)<br/>
