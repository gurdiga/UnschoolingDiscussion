&gt; Sometimes we think of computer experience as sending e-mail, drawing on <br/>
&gt; paint <br/>
&gt; and things of that nature. I am speaking of the other computer programs as <br/>
&gt; well. Don&#39;t you think that kids these days should do more than just play <br/>
&gt; games on the comp? Shouldn&#39;t they know how to do an excel spreadsheet? Add <br/>
&gt; some information into Access and all of that good stuff. Most companies <br/>
&gt; nowadays want someone who has this knowledge base of simple computer <br/>
&gt; applications. Do you think this is leaning towards forced learning if the <br/>
&gt; child has no interest in those things?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember when computers first became &quot;mainstream&quot; in our school. The <br/>
library had two or three Apple 2E&#39;s (I think those were the ones!) and we <br/>
would wheel them on carts to our room, team up into groups and spend time <br/>
&quot;writing&quot; simple programs (you remember the ones? <br/>
10  x=2<br/>
20  y=3<br/>
30  z=5<br/>
40  x+y<br/>
and so on.... ) It was all time consuming, boring, and worst of all, the <br/>
technology was obsolete with in months! I hated it, the experience put me off <br/>
computers for years! I didn&#39;t learn to use ANYTHING remotely related to a <br/>
computer for years. I thought it was all mumbo jumbo jargon too far advanced <br/>
for my addled brain. I never got the hang of how to write those old simple <br/>
programs, I heard all those hurtful comments from my teacher and peers about <br/>
how &quot;easy&quot; this all was, and even &quot;babies&quot; could get it, and a person had to <br/>
be really &quot;stupid&quot; not to understand and like to use computers. I was 26 <br/>
before I touched a computer again, and I took to it like a duck out of water! <br/>
I can now fix minor problems (Somehow our cookies setting got changed and <br/>
today I reset it so I could get into our group, I would have never learned <br/>
how to do that if someone had said I had to learn it! I did it because I <br/>
wanted to sign into our group, and Yahoo said if I wanted to play with you <br/>
all, I had to fix some error, somewhere on my computer or Yahoo wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
me play!) Our computer is in our dining, craft, freezer, laundry, library <br/>
room, the kids sit down and play Sim Park, Lego Harry Potter creator, <br/>
Puzzlemania.... they sign on to the Internet and IM with their Grandma, and <br/>
send their Grandpa funny jokes, they scan and send pictures they have drawn <br/>
to Grandma and Grandpa, their Aunt sends them links to fun sites and pictures <br/>
of their Cousin. I didn&#39;t teach them how to do this, and neither did my <br/>
Husband. Moly (8) and Jack (6) somehow learned to do all this by watching, <br/>
reading the directions from the computer and trial and error. (the trial and <br/>
error part is how I learned to rescue a crashed computer!) I suppose if <br/>
either of them need to learn how to run a spread sheet they will! (I don&#39;t <br/>
know how to do one, if I need to learn I guess I will, until that day...) And <br/>
that is how I look at computer literacy for my kids, they at 8 and 6 are more <br/>
computer literate than I was at 14 so I suppose when they are my age they <br/>
will be computer geniuses, until then I won&#39;t worry. <br/>
