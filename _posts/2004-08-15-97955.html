<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528514411">Our Big Macs started with some reading Dd did.  <br/>
<br/>
She did find the books overwhelming and scary, gut-wrenching, and she<br/>
kept setting them down to have a good cry. <br/>
<br/>
My parents took me to all sorts of activist events/protests/rallies,<br/>
and our house was always a flurry of activity, and not at all<br/>
&quot;peaceful,&quot; and I do want my children to have a better life than mine.    <br/>
<br/>
Should I keep her from reading books that discuss these<br/>
political/environmental/social issues to keep her life more peaceful? <br/>
**********************************************<br/>
I think a peaceful life can mean different things to different people.<br/>
<br/>
I think we live a very happy, peaceful life. The three of us (Me, Kathryn, my <br/>
partner, Beth, and our son Julian, who is almost 15) have very similar <br/>
temperaments, and we live together very harmoniously. We share many of the same <br/>
interests and support each other in our goals and interests.<br/>
<br/>
The three of us are also very political, and Julian has kind of grown up with <br/>
it. (It might also be partly genetic -- his dad is also very political LOL)  <br/>
He has never eaten meat. When he was a baby for some reason it just seemed <br/>
weird to feed him meat, even though both I and his father ate meat. Beth, a <br/>
vegetarian, was in his life by the time he was 1. When he was old enough to talk, <br/>
he was already pretty adamant that he did not want to eat animals. While not a <br/>
vegan, he also chooses not to use any leather.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also a straight teenager growing up in a gay household. Even though he&#39;s <br/>
straight, he also shares a gay culture, and knows a lot about civil rights <br/>
fights. He grew up with this. He got signatures on postcards in front of the <br/>
Post Office this year, fighting to allow me and Beth to marry legally. He&#39;s been <br/>
to Gay pride marches, and early on other marches. He attends a Unitarian <br/>
Universalist church and youth group, and he and his friends talk about politics <br/>
quite a lot. Right now he&#39;s reading the new Al Franken book, which he asked for <br/>
when he saw it at BJ&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously his parents&#39; interests/passions have had a dramatic effect on <br/>
Julian&#39;s interests and passions. We didn&#39;t make him have them -- they were around <br/>
the house (strewn, if you will, but not consciously). He&#39;s got lots of other <br/>
interests too, some of which he also got from us, some that are entirely his own.<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing. My mom once wondered how I turned out to be such an ardent <br/>
feminist. I cracked up. I knew exactly where I got it. From an early age my parents <br/>
let my sister and me know we were intelligent and could do whatever we <br/>
wanted. I remember as a teenager my mom buying me my first copy of Our Bodies, <br/>
Ourselves. I remember being excited when, for one birthday, she got me this three <br/>
volume set of books about biographies of women. <br/>
<br/>
My point is that we DO pass along our interests and values to our kids, <br/>
because they&#39;re lying around the house. If  you try to force them or portray them <br/>
in a negative way it&#39;s not going to work. Some families don&#39;t have tv&#39;s, for <br/>
whatever reason, but if you start not &quot;allowing&quot; kids to watch, even at someone <br/>
else&#39;s house, you kind of just end up with kids that seem odd and a little <br/>
sad. <br/>
<br/>
The choices we make can be joyful, even when the activity may be fighting <br/>
oppression, etc. It&#39;s not joyful if we&#39;re not really allowing choices.<br/>

For anyone who wasn&#39;t at the conference last year, (even if you <br/>
were), there is a tradition of wine by the pool on Friday and <br/>
Saturday nights after the speakers.  Just bring a bottle of your <br/>
favorite to share with the group, maybe something that originated <br/>
from your area.  Someone also brought cheeses, crackers and grapes.  <br/>
We stayed up until they kicked us out of the pool area (an hour <br/>
after they were supposed to), then we moved the party to a room and <br/>
did tarot cards.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about losing sleep by staying up all night, drinking <br/>
wine, then getting up at 9am for the first speaker.  You can catch <br/>
up on sleep once you get home.  <br/>

Since we&#39;re camping, and driving my Beetle, I&#39;ve been working on getting a  <br/>
hitch installed, then a cargo carrier, then a box for the cargo carrier to keep <br/>
 the gear dry.  The cargo carrier has little antennae with orange balls on  <br/>
it so I can see it from the rearview.  I&#39;m thinking of ways to decorate the  <br/>
antennae.  I&#39;ll probably put some Razorback antennae balls on them instead,  and <br/>
maybe even an unschooling flag of my own making.  I&#39;ve been planning  this <br/>
for MONTHS.  Today I put it all together and loaded it up and drove  over speed <br/>
bumps and it all works!  woo hoo.<br/>
 <br/>
Here we come.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would be SO COOL to see others on the journey TO the conference!  <br/>
When I was young my parents took us to Florida every year, and we <br/>
would see people we knew on the drive down!  We&#39;d always make signs <br/>
and get excited to see other *snowbirds* on that seemingly-endless <br/>
drive!<br/>
<br/>
So look for my Jeep along the Mass Turnpike!  It&#39;ll have an <br/>
unschooling bumper sticker (surprise, surprise!), a *Celebrate Today* <br/>
sticker and two kayak racks on the top!  We&#39;ll probably add a sign or <br/>
two.  And the interior will be LOADED with our whole fam damily and <br/>
Marty Dodd, too!<br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

Since  we&#39;re camping, and driving my Beetle, I&#39;ve been working on getting a   <br/>
hitch installed, then a cargo carrier, then a box for the cargo carrier to  <br/>
keep <br/>
the gear dry.  The cargo carrier has little antennae with orange  balls on  <br/>
it so I can see it from the rearview.  I&#39;m thinking of  ways to decorate the  <br/>
antennae.  I&#39;ll probably put some  Razorback antennae balls on them instead,  <br/>
and <br/>
maybe even an  unschooling flag of my own making.  I&#39;ve been planning  this <br/>
for  MONTHS.  Today I put it all together and loaded it up and drove   over <br/>
speed <br/>
bumps and it all works!  woo  hoo.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Cameron&#39;s working on painting the car with &quot;Live and Learn Unschooling  <br/>
Conference or BUST!&quot; on the sides. And little conference flags on the antenna  too. <br/>
 He made one for Boneroo and another for the last Phish concert in VA.  But <br/>
those were for his car. My van&#39;s already a rolling advertisement for  <br/>
unschooling; what&#39;s one more ad? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253456278">For anyone who wasn&#39;t at the conference last year, (even if you <br/>
were), there is a tradition of wine by the pool on Friday and <br/>
Saturday nights after the speakers.  Just bring a bottle of your <br/>
favorite to share with the group, maybe something that originated <br/>
from your area.  Someone also brought cheeses, crackers and grapes.  <br/>
We stayed up until they kicked us out of the pool area (an hour <br/>
after they were supposed to), then we moved the party to a room and <br/>
did tarot cards.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about losing sleep by staying up all night, drinking <br/>
wine, then getting up at 9am for the first speaker.  You can catch <br/>
up on sleep once you get home.  <br/>
================<br/>
<br/>
I have been going back and forth trying to decide whether to bring my family or come by myself this year since my kiddos are so young (7, 5 and 4). I&#39;m sad at the thought of coming without them, but I think they&#39;ll be much happier frolicking at their grandparent&#39;s shore house than hanging out in the hotel room. I *know* dh will be happier! And, now I know I&#39;ll get to hang out till all hours without feeling guilty or dealing with a grumpy hubby!<br/>
<br/>
I still keep thinking in the back of my mind though, but I could just bring Emily... she&#39;s 7 now.<br/>

But, for the next month or so all extra time and funds will be used to putput siding or the house, new windows in, finishing the basement and building decks. The thought of my house not looking like a run down shack and having a big unschooling friendly family room in the basement (thus pushing out the various rodents that like to winter there) wins big time! :) Next year. I&#39;m going to start saving as soon as the renovations are over.<br/>
