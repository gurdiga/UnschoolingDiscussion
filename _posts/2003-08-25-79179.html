<div id="ygrps-yiv-333662290">Hi!<br/>
Thanks for the advice!  I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way before.  I was trying to think of a way to be more supportive of his &quot;computer learning&quot; so I think I might order him some new role playing games.  He will just fall on the floor from shock if &quot;MOM&quot; actually bought him some games.  &lt;big grin&gt;  But if it were anything else that he or my daughter were into I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to go get it.  I do believe in providing resources within reason.<br/>
 <br/>
So, what role playing games do your members of your family enjoy? Give me some titles that I can go get.<br/>

Ages of the Empires is a huge hit over here.   Final Fantasy 7 is also good, there is a lot of reading.  I can&#39;t believe that I am in support of these games now.  lol<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t read all the posts on this topic- I have too many e-mails about John Taylor Gatto that I am trying to sift thru while trying to hear the program he was on today.  I am having difficulty with finding the story on the audio player. : (<br/>

&quot;Do WE work for CONGRESS, or is it the other way around?  If Congress works for us, and We the People give Congress permission to do the things they do, why can&#39;t I find a clause in the Constitution that allows the government to control our schools.  THINK, dammit!  Maybe - just maybe - the entire Department of Education is UNCONSTITUTIONAL.&quot;-Michael Badnarik - Libertarian Presidential Candidate 2004<br/>

Deana, three favorites of the house...Zoo Tycoon & Lemonade Stand for <br/>
PC, Harvest Moon games on PS one, two, and Gameboy. I just bought a <br/>
Wheel of Fortune game, a Scrabble game and Casino game for PC also. I <br/>
can go with any kind of game series except fighting and ds that&#39;s 12 <br/>
has no problem with it. He thinks they are boring. He has bouts with <br/>
the Need for Speed series which I don&#39;t like but don&#39;t complain <br/>
about. We&#39;ve discussed what I don&#39;t like about them and at this time <br/>
he doesn&#39;t play the parts that are offensive to me. I&#39;m sleep <br/>
deprived....good night! Sara <br/>
