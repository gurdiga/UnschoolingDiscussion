<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541877226">Thank you, Brenda! It really helps to hear that others have had 3 year olds <br/>
who acted like...well, three-year olds! Kalie&#39;s 3 regular (female) playmates <br/>
are (I think) amazingly docile, compared to our little girl, but Kalie also <br/>
seems to be a lot more creative. One mom even told me her child doesn&#39;t <br/>
really &quot;think outside the box&quot;, which I thought was an extremely sad comment. <br/>
My husband and I were discussing just this same thing recently, and I <br/>
remember telling him how the other little girls actually play with the toys <br/>
the way they&#39;re directed to. (I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m explaining this like I&#39;d <br/>
like, but they play with everything the way it&#39;s &quot;intended&#39;&quot; to be used - the <br/>
only thing in the tower are the blocks, the play dishes only are used in the <br/>
play kitchen..The other moms consider that our daughter is a bit wild because <br/>
she dumps her toys on the floor - and I &quot;let&#39;&quot;her! Must be I&#39;m just wild, <br/>
too! LOL) These 3 other girls, btw,  are all already in preschool of one sort <br/>
or another, and 2 of the 3 are exhibiting lots of clinginess, etc; the other <br/>
one is very passive.<br/>
<br/>
You are so absolutely right about Kalie being more relaxed when I am, too - <br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that she is receptive to the most minute changes in my mood. I&#39;m <br/>
working harder on remembering that - it can turn our whole day around. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess I did need some perspective - and I&#39;ll take any extra <br/>
patience you can spare!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too, and we&#39;re coming up on the half year thing again.  One of the things <br/>
she said, which I did not agree with, in the &quot;Your Three Year Old&quot; book was <br/>
that the mother should spend as much time as possible away from the child.  <br/>
While I did not follow the advice, it made me feel more virtuous to be with <br/>
them all day when I needed to feel that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll check the books out again when the half year troubles arrive...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231503540">I do remember this from the book, about spending time away - If I remember <br/>
correctly, it also advocates putting kids in preschool to keep them away from <br/>
the mother....I just sort of dismissed this, and read through the <br/>
developmental stuff, which I did find really helpful and interesting.<br/>

<br/>
We have two BIG cardboard boxes full of old-style Fisher Price stuff, and <br/>
it&#39;s all one big city (and country &lt;g&gt;).  There is a piece of blue cloth that <br/>
has been their lake for years.  <br/>
<br/>
When Holly was little and played with it, the little baby with a big was the <br/>
main character, and al the action revolved around the baby.  If she couldn&#39;t <br/>
find the baby, she had no interest in playing. <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 11, and still occasionally (last month) pulls out and plays with that <br/>
stuff.<br/>

LOL!!!! That sounds like my house. If it&#39;s one thing my children have taught <br/>
me, it&#39;s to be so much more easy going with things like that. I was always <br/>
very meticulous about my stuff when I was younger. I&#39;m sure it came from my <br/>
mom. I passed that on to my oldest somewhat and thankfully she taught me <br/>
from her strong will to lighten up!!! Now with 3 little ones, it would be <br/>
hard to be any other way!!<br/>
<br/>
I remember when my oldest went off to pre-school. She hated it and I didn&#39;t <br/>
know of any other way at the time. Anyway, they were all making houses on <br/>
paper out of popsicle sticks. Tara&#39;s picture had sticks just pasted all over <br/>
the paper in random order. When I asked about it, she explained that the <br/>
house had been through a tornado!!!! I loved that picture!!!!<br/>

 It is so refreshing to find a place and read the posts and actually agree.  <br/>
LOL.  I am sitting here at about 4:45 in the morning because my 5 year old <br/>
isn&#39;t tired.  He woke at about 4.  He should be getting tired in another 1/2 <br/>
hour or so.  <br/>
<br/>
But I had to comment on the toys because my sons friend (8 yo son) came over <br/>
and decided that I was the coolest mom because I let them play without <br/>
limits.  They dumped out toys and played and had fun, no one was hurt.  I <br/>
wasn&#39;t hanging over them.  He asked permission to use a toy a couple of times <br/>
then decided that all toys were fair game and he didn&#39;t have to ask me.  I <br/>
would simply say they aren&#39;t my toys you have to talk with the owner. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just wanted to say Hi.  My name is Pam.  My children (Dallen-8 and <br/>
Phillip-5) have never been to public school, we started out as relaxed <br/>
homeschoolers/some unit studies etc.  But we dumped that quickly and have <br/>
been unschooling ever since.  What a group.<br/>
I will go back to lurkdom for a while to get the feel of the group.<br/>
Take care all,<br/>

Or how (as we had here yesterday) will they construct a Mage Knight <br/>

miniature gingerbread house trees (kiped from my cake decorating stuff), <br/>
rocks from their collections and driftwood from the beach? It was utterly <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>14 Dec 2002, at  8:48pm</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547262746">I&#39;m new here.  Was here long ago, but just decided to stop in again :O).<br/>
<br/>
For as many mistakes as I have made, and I still make them, I&quot;m glad that one of the things I did right was to let them just &quot;dump&quot; their toys and go to town.<br/>
<br/>
Just the other day, they were playing with straws and clay, making sculptures.  I never would have thought of that one. <br/>
<br/>
My husband was feeling neurotic about the straws all over the floor that didn&#39;t get picked up (in spite of my &quot;constant&quot; cleaning)...and I told him, hey...in 10 more years, there won&#39;t be any straws on the floor, and there won&#39;t be many kids here.  Enjoy it while it lasts.<br/>

  &lt;&lt; HOW then, in all the world, will Barbie climb the alps?  How will they <br/>
  discover that playdough (or PlayDoh, either one--homemade or bought) can <br/>
  make <br/>
  some battle scenarios for Lego guys (the dried up playdoh comes out easily <br/>
  later with a toothpick)?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Oh yes!<br/>
  Or how (as we had here yesterday) will they construct a Mage Knight <br/>
  battlefield out of a dartboard covered with a blue laundry bag (a lake), <br/>
  miniature gingerbread house trees (kiped from my cake decorating stuff), <br/>
  rocks from their collections and driftwood from the beach? It was utterly <br/>
  charming and came from all sorts of different sets of things around the house.<br/>
  I love combination stuff.....kids always know how to combine toys well if the <br/>
  adults just stay out of the way.<br/>

  LOL At this moment we have VHS tapes all over the living room representing houses, buildings etc.. building blocks and legos everywhere, action figures also pretty much everywhere and on top of everything, a Kynex Rollercoaster set up in the living room with SpiderMan scaling the side of it. Hmm I think they are in there having fun. lol <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2037926402">Hi, Kelli!!  Thanks for your sweet words.  It&#39;s nice to know I&#39;m missed <br/>
:-)   I have been really busy.  I&#39;ve been trying to keep up with all the <br/>
mail but sometimes I can&#39;t get to it.  There have been a few times when <br/>
I&#39;ve started to draft a response to someone&#39;s message only to be <br/>
interrupted for so long that it doesn&#39;t make sense to keep on writing it <br/>
once I get back to the &#39;puter.<br/>
<br/>
Nevertheless, I think of this particular collection of folks as a shining <br/>
beacon in my life.  I am thankful every day to &quot;know&quot; you all and grateful <br/>
that you are in my life, even though I have to settle for this virtual <br/>
community.  Maybe one day...  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Love to everyone (with more waving and grinning!)<br/>
