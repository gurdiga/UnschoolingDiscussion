 I don&#39;t know what you could mean! Boromir is just an average ok guy, and <br/>
 Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn) is gorgeous! Head and shoulders above <br/>
 what&#39;s-his-name &lt;g&gt;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I AGREE!! I was thinking to myself that I need to watch the movie again <br/>
because I didn&#39;t think Boromir and Aragorn looked that much alike.<br/>
So I think I will watch it today....but I remember Aragorn being fairly <br/>
adorable and Boromir was just, well, an average ok guy like you said.<br/>
