<div id="ygrps-yiv-557586282">This article&#39;s URL has been posted at another club a couple of times, and<br/>
its message is so moving, I very much would like to see it pass through the<br/>
hands of every caring individual in every corner of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Please read this, and consider what it means to all humanity. And if you<br/>
have access to anyone with the means to pass it to the powers that be, by<br/>
all means do so. Not that I believe massive attacks which slaughter still<br/>
more innocents are the purpose nor intent of our unilateral move to<br/>
eliminate terrorism, but it could perhaps temper the efforts a bit.<br/>
