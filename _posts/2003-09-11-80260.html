<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598581229">I think one of the major attractions of Superheroes is the having power to<br/>
right wrongs.  To have the power to save the powerless, to fight for the<br/>
underdog, etc..  And often people have to get angry to be motivated to do<br/>
that, hence the Hulk.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have learned the most amazing things from shows that I thought were<br/>
complete fluff.  We were watching some show the other day with a reference<br/>
to Harriet Tubman which the character missed.  My 12yo  laughed and I asked<br/>
her if she knew who Harriet Tubman was.  Adriane explained the history of<br/>
Ms. Tubman and stated that she learned it on &quot;Sister, Sister.&quot;   Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
By the way of introduction,  my name is Julie S.  I was on this group when<br/>
it started but quite a few months ago our computer died and we are just now<br/>
up and running again.  We have 5 kids, ages 12, 10, 6 and two 4yos.  We are<br/>
radical, almost fanatical unschoolers and are loving every minute of it.<br/>

&gt; My kids had a neighbor girl they used to play with when we lived in the<br/>
&gt; Stepford Village who decided she wanted to homeschool too.  When she asked<br/>
&gt; her mother if they could, her mother told her no, because she, the<br/>
&gt; seven-year-old, would drive her crazy  if she was around the house all<br/>
day.<br/>
&gt; Besides that, when would her mother be able to go shopping, or to the gym,<br/>
&gt; or get her nails done if she had to take care of her all of the time?<br/>
Talk<br/>
&gt; about screwed up priorites!  My heart ached for this little girl.  It&#39;s<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; thing to think these sorts of thoughts, but to say them out loud to a<br/>
seven<br/>
&gt; year old is criminal.  All of our neighbors seemed to have the attitude<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; they wanted the best money could buy for their kids, and they were willing<br/>
&gt; to work as much as they needed to so their kids could have the very best.<br/>
&gt; The only thing they didn&#39;t have was parents who wanted to spend time with<br/>
&gt; them!<br/>

&gt; page the right length and spelled those. &lt;G&gt; So, I still don&#39;t know what<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh my gosh!!  Yeah, that&#39;s cool, but the odds of there being words on that<br/>

were.-=-<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yeah, I particularly liked the other girl&#39;s &quot;not nemore&quot; which I assume is<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I asked Holly about &quot;yaa&quot; which she used for &quot;yeah.&quot;  She said she knows<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other spelling, but it&#39;s a way to show it with a certain inflection<br/>
(didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; use the word &quot;inflection,&quot; but pronounced it the way it&#39;s intended to be<br/>
if they<br/>
&gt; wrote &quot;yaa&quot;).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Letting my kids watch what they want and play whatever video games<br/>
&gt; &gt; they want has led to some positive academic study.  Like, Ethan saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; some cartoon on Tv about Shakespeare&#39;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; and he thought Puck was pretty cool.  So today he just up and said,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I need to get a new library card.&quot;  I said, &quot;Do you want to go to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the library today?&quot;  &quot;Yes, I want to get A Midsummer Night&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Dream.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, we went and he did.  He also got Bloom&#39;s Notes on the play.  He<br/>
&gt; &gt; sat reading the first scene to me just now.  Now you know if I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggested he get that book, it would have gone over like a lead<br/>
&gt; &gt; balloon.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then Josh&#39;s obsession with the video game Halo and the movie<br/>
&gt; Resident<br/>
&gt; &gt; Evil has caused him to get all the paperback books spawned by those<br/>
&gt; &gt; two, and he has read every one.  Now, I could be complaining that<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; was not reading Shakespeare like Ethan, but at least he is<br/>
&gt; reading!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Which is what is important.  And every now and then, he tries to<br/>
&gt; &gt; write his own little Halo stories.<br/>

&gt; Subject: spelling<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t know if I caught the total jist of the discussion on spelling but it<br/>
made me think of something. My oldest came home from school at 10 yrs old.<br/>
She could not spell. My then youngest had done kindergarten. They were<br/>
introduced to sounds like spelling. For 1-2 yrs there was very little<br/>
attempt to do anything requiring spelling or reading by any of the kids. The<br/>
oldest started asking for how to spell, started having me write out her<br/>
dictated stories,etc...After about a year I noticed there was less asking.<br/>
At this point she was writing stories with a passion. She is now 15 and last<br/>
year asked for a book on punctuation, and grammar rules for Christmas. She<br/>
seldom needs help with spelling and seldom misspells now. I did no formal<br/>
training. The ds that learned sounds like spelling would quit spelling if I<br/>
corrected his letters at all.I would send his letters to his uncle<br/>
uncorrected. He is now 11 and began asking for spelling help on his own.What<br/>
fascinated me was I have seen a pattern for  dd and ds and that was to leave<br/>
them alone and only give what they asked for. Now suddenly the 11 yr old has<br/>
decided it is important for him to have correct spelling in his letters.<br/>
This whole natural learning has really worked here and been very fascinating<br/>
to watch.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; A teacher chooses to be with x number of children all day. Why is it<br/>
&gt; so hard for people who are so keen on spending time with their<br/>
&gt; children to understand that, for other people, it&#39;s not what they<br/>
&gt; want to do? They enjoy their jobs, or they enjoy their time out. Not<br/>
&gt; all kids are unhappy at school. Some kids love it and would hate to<br/>
&gt; be at home. I know this list is for home schoolers (we do, home<br/>
&gt; school I mean) and we love it - but I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to do it a<br/>
&gt; few years ago when my career still meant the world to me - as did my<br/>
&gt; children, but they were happy at school, and I was happy so changing<br/>
&gt; it wouldn&#39;t have brought us anything better - we would have been<br/>
&gt; unhappy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *******************************************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, just because I myself was a good student and absolutely LOVED<br/>
&gt; school and everything about it doesn&#39;t mean that leaving my kids in<br/>
&gt; school was the right thing.  Could they have continued on in the<br/>
&gt; school they were in?  Probably....they weren&#39;t getting bad grades,<br/>
&gt; except my older son in math, but they were already prepared to give<br/>
&gt; him some kind of business math course in place of Algebra, so he<br/>
&gt; could have done OK there.  We could have continued on, but I<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t in good conscience do it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No, people who don&#39;t homeschool aren&#39;t &quot;bad&quot; people, but I myself had<br/>
&gt; to question why I would want to leave my kids in a system that is<br/>
&gt; squelching their potential, that is literally designed to keep them<br/>
&gt; from succeeding, to keep them from being free thinkers and from<br/>
&gt; breaking out of the mold society wants to place them in.  I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; do it.....I had to give them a chance.  Even if kids in school get<br/>
&gt; straight A&#39;s, that doesn&#39;t mean school is good for them.  It&#39;s still<br/>
&gt; keeping them from reaching their potential.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I feel a bit dumb<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I think of all prejudices I have had towards certain books and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; TV<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I struggle with this too, maybe you all can help.  I find it difficult to<br/>
&gt; find the value in Spiderman, Superman, etc.  This is my son&#39;s current<br/>
&quot;thing.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying not to be judgemental, but it&#39;s a struggle.  I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
it is<br/>
&gt; except that I was never interested in super heroes as a child.  Also, I<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; trouble with violence in general.  Hulk, for instance, gets his powers<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; getting angry, right?  Nathan has done a lot with this phase, including<br/>
drawing<br/>
&gt; Zuperman, cutting him out and putting a big Z on his chest (actually a<br/>
&gt; backwards S).  He also makes spiderman masks, hulk hands, etc and engages<br/>
in a lot of<br/>
&gt; imaginative play with his guys.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s clearly something I need to get over.  I&#39;m trying to think positively<br/>
&gt; and at least acknowledge that it&#39;s a good think I know it&#39;s my issue, not<br/>
his!<br/>

I didn&#39;t connect the two topics this morning when I was ordering a copy of <br/>
The Tick episodes on DVD.   You have to know the real super-hero traditions and <br/>
motifs for all the humor on that show to make sense.  Some of the greatest <br/>
quotes of the past decade were from The Tick TV show.<br/>

Dr. Mental gets inside The Tick&#39;s head and says, &quot;I am going to unleash <br/>
your worst fear&quot;. Switch of scene and The Tick is in this tiny chair <br/>
sitting in front of a tine desk with paper everywhere to which he says: <br/>
&quot;A desk job? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE THE TICK!<br/>

<br/>
Or this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Evil is just plain bad. You don&#39;t cotton to it, <br/>
you just gotta smack it on the nose <br/>
with the rolled-up newspaper of goodness! <br/>
Bad dog! Bad dog!&quot;<br/>
