<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206116883">Taking the seminar, eh? *heart palpitations* $400 is SO MUCH MONEY to <br/>
us! A month&#39;s groceries, an overnight trip to Lagoon, a family pool <br/>
season pass and money to spend on the concession there...aaargh!<br/>
<br/>
This is what we&#39;re doing right now: <br/>
<br/>
History: she has read through her whole history book, for pleasure. <br/>
In order to learn how to study for a test, (since she wants to go to <br/>
college), I taught her how to go through her reading and find the <br/>
main points, and then she has an open book test. I&#39;ve also told her, <br/>
college tests won&#39;t be open book, and she knows she should hone her <br/>
study skills to prepare for college.<br/>
<br/>
Science: read a chapter, take an open book test. Forget everything <br/>
except the bits about the ocean (an interest of Abbie&#39;s)<br/>
<br/>
Grammar: sit down with mom, and get into a fit of giggles at how <br/>
STUPID and USELESS it is to have to show someone else that she can <br/>
fill in the little dots, and take an open book test with lots of <br/>
guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Economics: sit down with the book and mom, and read through the book <br/>
together, and talk about tools, consuming, food, shelter, and work. <br/>
Laugh a lot. Talk about it on the way to drama class. Haven&#39;t taken a <br/>
test in that one yet. Open book, most likely.  <br/>
<br/>
Math: we&#39;re ignoring math. She knows how to do everything up to <br/>
dividing and multiplying fractions. She went so far in math, and <br/>
said &quot;no more!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
and, she is doing this at her own pace. She rattled off about 10 <br/>
science tests in one week, and is now leaving it all alone. <br/>
<br/>
we may continue along those lines, just to &quot;finish what we started&quot; <br/>
(if that isn&#39;t an unschooling attitude, remember: I&#39;m a work in <br/>
progress here! L) and to give mom and dad the feeling that we didn&#39;t <br/>
shell out $400 for her not to finish. She does have until Oct. 31 to <br/>
finish the year out. (they give a pupil a whole year to do one year&#39;s <br/>
work, and we got started with this in Oct.) <br/>
<br/>
and HAVE WE learned our lesson! Abbie, too, though. She did <br/>
request &quot;more structure, some official assignments&quot; <br/>
<br/>
PEace, HeidiC<br/>

You&#39;ve already spent the money. It&#39;s gone. Consider it a lesson <br/>
learned. A $400 lesson. I&#39;d ditch it and move back to the joy.<br/>

I dont know what the curriculum looks like but I have some crafty<br/>
suggestions for it:<br/>
<br/>
Use an ageing wash on pages that have geometry or math diagrams and<br/>
decoupage them onto wooden boxes as gift or jewelry boxes. (Da Vinci<br/>
reproductions?)<br/>
<br/>
Tightly typed text can look good as mats for photos, backgrounds for<br/>
shadow boxes, decoupage items.<br/>
<br/>
Photos, especially black and white historical or architecture can make<br/>
great basis for collage wall art. Check out some of the finished art at<br/>
home décor stores  thats all a lot of it is.<br/>
<br/>
Hard cover books can be made into secret safes and hidden in plain<br/>
view.<br/>
<br/>
They can also be made into fake book rows and donated to the prop<br/>
department of your local community theater.<br/>
<br/>
Shred the stuff for mailing packages.<br/>
<br/>
Or I love papier mache!<br/>
<br/>
Or finally,<br/>
<br/>
Sell the whole darn thing on E-bay and recoup a portion of your costs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099504195">LOL Robyn, I like the way you think! The book Abbie likes is her <br/>
history book, so we&#39;ll keep that. Maybe we can get the rest onto Ebay <br/>
and sell some of the non-marked stuff. Not much of that, though. <br/>
She&#39;s been underlining in order to glean data for the tests. (Rolling <br/>
