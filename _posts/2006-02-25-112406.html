<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124435826">As I was posting my previous question, another thing occured to me.<br/>
<br/>
I had thought about this a few times before that, too.<br/>
<br/>
May be you can help me see this more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
I would hate it if my husband posted questions about how to handle our<br/>
relationship behind my back. Actually, I would hate it even if I knew<br/>
about it. It would make me feel exposed, and vulnerable, and as if our<br/>
intimacy has been invaded. Unless, I suppose I felt like I wanted some<br/>
outside input on a particular issue, too.<br/>
<br/>
Does this extend to parenting? Should I get my daughter&#39;s permission<br/>
before I write about her on message boards? A very young child might<br/>
not understand such an explanation.. How do you handle this?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

My kids are used to being discussed and they really don&#39;t mind.   <br/>
Sometimes they&#39;ll say something and say &quot;Don&#39;t report this,&quot; and I  <br/>
don&#39;t.  It&#39;s happened maybe four or five times with five kids in a  <br/>
dozen years.<br/>
<br/>
There are different &quot;parents&quot; of such discussions as these.  My own  <br/>
first examples were La Leche League (which DEFINITELY depends on real  <br/>
people sharing real experiences) and Adult Children of Alcoholics,  <br/>
which involves personal stories in a lighter way,  but is more  <br/>
formulaic and private, and uses only first names, not last.   There  <br/>
is a group/philosophy called TCS, and they refuse to tell any  <br/>
personal stories.  They talk theory only, which makes it useless, in  <br/>
my opinion.  It&#39;s a political philosophy at that point.<br/>
<br/>
What if you joined a list about training horses and no one there  <br/>
would even admit if he owned a horse, or if you happened to know he  <br/>
did, he refused to answer any direct questions about his horse, but  <br/>
would only speak of the way horses should theoretically be trained?    <br/>
That&#39;s how it seems to me it would be if we didn&#39;t give real-life  <br/>
examples.<br/>
<br/>
But if you feel uncomfortable, just read and don&#39;t share.  That&#39;s  <br/>
fine.  The group as a group isn&#39;t going to tell you whether you need  <br/>
her permission or not.  It IS your experience, your relationship with  <br/>
your daughter.<br/>
