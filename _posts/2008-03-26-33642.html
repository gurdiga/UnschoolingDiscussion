<div id="ygrps-yiv-554977758">&quot;How you live in the moment affects how you live in the hour, and the  <br/>
day, and the lifetime.&quot; —Sandra Dodd<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the quote that came up when I went to my main page (checking  <br/>
links, as I&#39;m working on repairing broken links and adding some good  <br/>
stuff to other pages...)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad it came up, because I was in the throes of trying to decide  <br/>
whether to bring a topic to this list or not, and that seemed to be a  <br/>
good sign.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How you live in the moment affects how you live in the hour, and the  <br/>
day, and the lifetime.&quot;   When I went just now to find where that  <br/>
quote came from, tadaa!  It&#39;s from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/balance">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a>    <br/>
Balancing in the Middle Ground, which was linked here yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Okay,  here&#39;s the subject matter.  There seems a little storm of  <br/>
confusion between unschooling and new age juju, specifically  <br/>
channeling and visualizing.<br/>
<br/>
I very much prefer thinking and doing to buck-passing and wishing.<br/>
<br/>
Dealing directly and sweetly with one&#39;s children does not require  <br/>
consultation with departed &quot;sages&quot; nor does it need to involve  <br/>
visualizing get-rich schemes or recommending that kids run away.<br/>
<br/>
This one bugged me:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When a child has a dream and a parent says, &#39;It&#39;s not financially<br/>
feasible; you can&#39;t make a living at that; don&#39;t do it,&#39; we say to<br/>
the child, run away from home...<br/>
You must follow your dream.<br/>
You will never be joyful if you don&#39;t.<br/>
Your dream may change, but you&#39;ve got to stay after your dreams.<br/>
You have to.&quot;<br/>
Abraham, channeled via Esther Hicks<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
And when I went to see who Esther Hicks was, it reminded me that  <br/>
someone told me there&#39;s a new &quot;radical unschooling&quot; list (and I call  <br/>
it that because it is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com">radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com</a>) that, once  <br/>
you go to the description says:  &quot;This is a discussion and support  <br/>
group for Radical or Whole Life Unschoolers. This group is unique in  <br/>
that we will have a focus on using the Law of Attraction in our  <br/>
Unschooling lives. This is a progressive, revolutionary approach to  <br/>
parenting that we are honored to be pioneering! &quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pioneering&quot; the combination of that with &quot;the Law of Attraction&quot;   <br/>
*maybe* (OR NOT, if the ReThinking Education conference wants to  <br/>
claim that, as that&#39;s where the Esther Hicks quote recommending that  <br/>
children with impractical ideas run away came from, but not  <br/>
pioneering unschooling, nor radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Is it necessary for me to explicitly state that I neither advocate   <br/>
nor believe in the channeling of anyone or anything?<br/>
<br/>
Well &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; be painted with the crazy brush?<br/>
<br/>
Yes of course, curiosity leads to more curiosity and peace leads to  <br/>
more peace.  Respect leads to  more respect.  This has been being  <br/>
said and explained and expanded and expounded on by people on this  <br/>
list and others similar for YEARS, very  many more years than some  <br/>
people have been parents at all.   Does it seem that when people  <br/>
start talking about the law of attraction they&#39;re also asking for  <br/>
money?  And that people want cash when they channel spirits or teams  <br/>
of spirits (this &quot;Abraham&quot; isn&#39;t the Abraham most people think of,  <br/>
it&#39;s some otherworldly committee who seem to have summarized some  <br/>
cool Hindu and Buddhist ideas, summarized the Best of the  <br/>
Rosicrucians, and is being marketted as something new).  Marketted is  <br/>
the main part.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a WHOLE LOT of free information, better, purer, and it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t put any juju between you and your child:<br/>

<br/>
If you live in juju, it will affect your hour, your day and your  <br/>
lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
Every moment spent hoping for magical benefits could be spent gently  <br/>
and directly in contact with your children getting REAL benefits.<br/>
<br/>
WAIT!  I&#39;m getting a message from the spirit realm.<br/>
<br/>
No, I&#39;m not.   I know some schizophrenics who are, but my head and my  <br/>
home are very still and clear.<br/>

every person, it completely ignores that all &quot;feelings/spiritual juju&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629267077">I enjoy Abraham-Hicks &quot;new-age&quot; &quot;juju&quot; stuff and learning about the <br/>
Law of Attraction particularly because it has helped me be a better <br/>
unschooling parent.  I&#39;ve learned to trust my journey with my kids <br/>
and I stand stronger now in the face of naysayers, negative opinions <br/>
from family because of what I&#39;ve read and learned from <br/>
Abraham/Esther. Am I just some lazy parent &quot;wishing&quot; for things and <br/>
trying to channel my way to a good life without any intention?  Hell <br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
I guess if you interpret all of Abraham Hicks and Law of Attraction <br/>
as just sticking your head in the sand and waiting for &quot;stuff,&quot; then <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t serve you. <br/>
<br/>
I think the Abraham-Hicks quote here in question is not great and I <br/>
think it is taken out of context.  I don&#39;t interpret it to be <br/>
speaking to young children and encouraging them to run away.  It <br/>
spoke to me more in terms of an older child or adult who is capable <br/>
of choosing what they want and yet don&#39;t because they are more caught <br/>
up in doing what a parent would want or seeking parental approval. <br/>
<br/>
I think a really great Abraham-Hicks quote in terms of unschooling is <br/>
this:<br/>
<br/>
----Home Schooled Children Feeling &quot;Free At Last?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Guest: I have begun home schooling our children. However, finding the <br/>
perfect teacher has been challenging.<br/>
<br/>
Abraham: When people use the word &quot;teacher&quot;, the vibration that <br/>
matches the word often feels more like asserter than it does like <br/>
allower. But, the ideal teacher is one who is an open vortex through <br/>
which desire can be satisfied, where an asserter is one who has <br/>
information that they are wanting to impart.<br/>
<br/>
Jerry and Esther visited with a magnificent founder of a wonderful <br/>
school, *Sudbury Valley School in Massachusetts. And he offered <br/>
something that was so clarifying to Esther. He said that their <br/>
teachers never say, &quot;Well, Johnny, don&#39;t you think you would like to <br/>
learn to read?&quot; because they are understanding that unless Johnny is <br/>
asking to read, that the effort that everyone makes is going to be <br/>
uncomfortable anyway.<br/>
<br/>
The ideal teacher is one who understands that desire to know is <br/>
natural, and is someone who stands by ready to offer examples to <br/>
satisfy the desire of the student... What made you realize it wasn&#39;t <br/>
working out?<br/>
<br/>
Guest: Behavior issues with the kids... they were not liking the <br/>
restraints...<br/>
<br/>
Abraham: The kinds of things they said to you were, &quot;We thought it <br/>
was going to be a whole lot more fun. We thought we were going to get <br/>
to do more of what we wanted to do, and we thought we were going to <br/>
get to choose.&quot; And that&#39;s the way you felt when you were born, you <br/>
thought you were going to get to choose, that was the bargain.<br/>
<br/>
And then somebody else says, &quot;Well, here you are, and you don&#39;t get <br/>
to choose. You don&#39;t get to choose where you sit, or when you come, <br/>
or how long you sit there, and you don&#39;t get to choose what we think <br/>
about. You don&#39;t get to choose when you talk, and you don&#39;t get to <br/>
choose what we talk about. In other words, you are not free, you are <br/>
our captives. And we are here to assert good stuff into you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they say, &quot;Ah, give me a break! That&#39;s not what the bargain was. <br/>
I came understanding that I am a creator. I came knowing that I get <br/>
to choose.&quot; It takes years to beat that out of them. It takes years <br/>
and years before they are willing to sit there and be quiet and do <br/>
only what is supposed to be done when it is supposed to be done. It <br/>
takes a long time to conform you into your unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it is so delicious! When you have an environment where children <br/>
feel free, where they get to choose, and you are brave enough to ride <br/>
it out... In other words, at first they&#39;ll choose all of the things <br/>
that you have been convinced are wrong... But when you are brave <br/>
enough to let it go far enough that they actually do identify their <br/>
own personal desire, and then you stand as the loving implementer of <br/>
their desire -- you would never go back to any other form.<br/>
<br/>
The other never worked. It doesn&#39;t work even a little bit. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
work at all. Not even a little bit.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote> From Wikipedia, &quot;Juju is a word of West African origin that refers to  <br/>
the supernatural power ascribed to an object.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been teaching and studying metaphysics, quantum physics, and New  <br/>
Thought Spirituality (which is not the same as new age) for over 20  <br/>
years.  Not once have I ever advocated ascribing supernatural power to  <br/>
any object.  In the 15 years that I&#39;ve been listening to Abraham-Hicks  <br/>
I have never heard them recommend giving power to an object.  In fact,  <br/>
they recommend not giving your power away to anything, much less an  <br/>
inanimate object.  Not once have I heard anyone who is talking about  <br/>
Law of Attraction, which seems to be the real issue here, advocate  <br/>
ascribing supernatural power to an object.  It&#39;s misleading and  <br/>
inaccurate to talk about these ideas and practices as new age juju.   <br/>
It&#39;s  inaccurate to liken channeling, and especially visualization, to  <br/>
juju.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I very much prefer thinking and doing to buck-passing and wishing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The ideas discussed by Abraham-Hicks have nothing to do with buck- <br/>
passing and wishing.  There are some very thoughtful and empowering  <br/>
discussions going on at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com">radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com</a> if anyone  <br/>
would like to know more.  None of which having anything to do with  <br/>
buck-passing and wishing and a lot to do with thinking and being in  <br/>
the present moment, healing past experiences, changing perspectives,  <br/>
making better choices and creating new positive experiences with our  <br/>
children and for ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it necessary for me to explicitly state that I neither advocate<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not necessary for me to know this about Sandra or agree with it  <br/>
in order for me to be a better unschooling parent.  It is useful  <br/>
information with regard to what I post on her list though.<br/>
<br/>
Whether certain information is considered channeled or not is less  <br/>
important to me than whether the information resonates with me and  <br/>
helps me be a more respectful, joyful parent.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I&#39;ve learned and benefitted from the ideas put forth by  <br/>
Sandra and other veteran unschoolers here, there have been many times  <br/>
when I wanted to discuss an unschooling ideas from a more spiritual  <br/>
perspective.  There have been many times when I have had something to  <br/>
add, but thought that it would be seen as too spiritual for this  <br/>
list.  So, I am very happy that there is a forum for those of us who  <br/>
came to unschooling as a natural expansion and expression of what we  <br/>
have learned on our spiritual paths.  And I&#39;m grateful to conferences  <br/>
that add options for us.  At Live and Learn, there have been topics on  <br/>
Zen and Unschooling and this year I think Scott Noelle is presenting  <br/>
at Live and Learn.  He is as spiritual as you get and gathering from  <br/>
his writings gets much of his wisdom from Abraham-Hicks.  At the  <br/>
Rethinking Education Conference I will be presenting several options  <br/>
for those who want to go deeper into unschooling from a spiritual  <br/>
perspective.  There is room in Unschooling for secular and spiritual  <br/>
alike.  I don&#39;t think one needs to feel threatened by the other.   <br/>
Separate lists are great though. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is a WHOLE LOT of free information, better, purer, and it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t put any juju between you and your child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because of this use of &quot;juju&quot; I&#39;m not clear on what Sandra is getting  <br/>
at here.   I can&#39;t imagine that she&#39;s saying that if a person  <br/>
practices visualization or studies a teaching that is &quot;channeled&quot; that  <br/>
will somehow put a barrier up between them and their children.  I have  <br/>
to say that the specific teachings of Abraham-Hicks have brought down  <br/>
more barriers in my life that I can even begin to describe.  I am  <br/>
definitely a better, more loving, gentle parent.  The basis of what  <br/>
Abe-Hicks teachings is what has moved me from fear and control to  <br/>
trust and freedom more easily, especially with my children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you live in juju, it will affect your hour, your day and your<br/>
&gt; lifetime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If by juju you mean the teachings of Abraham-Hicks, I certainly hope  <br/>
it affects my day and my lifetime.  It&#39;s really good positive stuff  <br/>
that brings joy to me and my family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Every moment spent hoping for magical benefits could be spent gently<br/>
&gt; and directly in contact with your children getting REAL benefits.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh yes, the proof is in the pudding.  That&#39;s why I&#39;ve been studying  <br/>
and learning from Abe-Hicks for 15 years.  Many, many real benefits  <br/>
and yes, magical and delightful and wonder-filled as well.  My  <br/>
children have benefitted greatly from it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; home are very still and clear.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When a person taps into universal wisdom that is beyond their personal  <br/>
mental consciousness, it can easily be disregarded as mental illness.   <br/>
Schizophrenics experience delusion and paranoia.  It is a disease that  <br/>
creates chaos and harm to the person and those in their lives.  I have  <br/>
met Esther Hicks and I have sat in her presences while she &quot;channeled&quot;  <br/>
Abraham.  She is anything but delusional and paranoid.  She is  <br/>
grounded in this life, joyful and clear.  She is in complete control  <br/>
of her senses and her body.  She doesn&#39;t call what she does  <br/>
&quot;channeling&quot; but more the quieting of her ego and individual mind  <br/>
chatter, so that she can hear universal wisdom.  Something we are all  <br/>
capable of doing if we choose.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful to Sandra for the insights that I&#39;ve gained from being  <br/>
part of this list.  Yet knowing that many of the ideas that are  <br/>
important to me are not welcomed here, I&#39;m also grateful that there  <br/>
are other places where I can bring my whole self to the table to  <br/>
discuss and explore unschooling ideas.   There are many, many more who  <br/>
are wanting the same - maybe right on this list.  I suspect there will  <br/>
be a boon in membership at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com">radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com</a>. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t waiting for Johnny to ask to read.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;effort&quot; that unschooling parents make is important (and far from  <br/>
&quot;uncomfortable&quot;) LONG before Johnny might even think of &quot;asking to  <br/>
read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;effort&quot; in the above quote sounds like it still means teaching  <br/>
Johnny to read, but just waiting until he asks.<br/>
<br/>
The unschooling parent&#39;s effort is in creating a fantastic,  <br/>
stimulating, enriched environment in which Johnny will naturally and,  <br/>
most often, incidentally, begin reading as natural result of pursuing  <br/>
his interests.<br/>
<br/>
The above quote is very misleading if it is supposed to describe  <br/>
unschooling - in fact, it is the number one most mistaken idea about  <br/>
unschooling that we often run across and I feel like I spent a whole  <br/>
lot of time trying to correct that idea.<br/>

That&#39;s the idea of discussing the ideas instead of the people, but it  <br/>

working from experience or theory, and it&#39;s starting to matter to me  <br/>
more and more whether the ideas are their own or whether they&#39;ve just  <br/>

Juju is a term used to refer to energy: &quot;good juju&quot; is good energy;  <br/>
&quot;bad juju&quot; is bad energy. This popular meaning has found its way to  <br/>
television. The ABC series Grey&#39;s Anatomy uses the term in the episode  <br/>
&quot;Superstition&quot;, as does the CBS series The Unit, in its 2006 episode,  <br/>
&quot;The Kill Zone.&quot; It has also been used by Capitan Sig Hansen of the F/ <br/>
V Northwestern on the Discovery Channel show &quot;The Deadliest Catch.&quot;<br/>
In the music industry, Juju plays a big part in the work of J Plunky  <br/>
Branch with his afro-funk jazz fusion music. From 1971 to 1974 his  <br/>
band was called Juju, from 1975 to 1981 Oneness of Juju, from 1982 to  <br/>
1988 Plunky & Oneness of Juju and from 1988 to present day is known as  <br/>
Plunky & Oneness. The band also had an album in 1984 called Electric  <br/>
JuJu Nation. (This information courtesy of the band&#39;s website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.plunkyone.com">http://www.plunkyone.com</a> <br/>

The lyric &quot;JuJu eyeball&quot; appears in the popular Beatles song &quot;Come  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504098980">Juju, the word, I&#39;ve known and used since I was 12 or 13 (and I&#39;m  <br/>
old), and because I was always really interested in word histories,  <br/>
I&#39;ve known the origin for nearly that long.  In plain English it  <br/>
applies to any superstition or special activity designed to create or  <br/>
avoid an effect.  My cousin had to walk the same way home that she  <br/>
had walked before.  If she went on one side of a tree, she went the  <br/>
same way.  If she crossed the road in one place, she&#39;d do it the same  <br/>
on the way back.  She said otherwise she would &quot;tangle up her  <br/>
string.&quot;  That was juju-stuff for her, and we&#39;d go along with it, if  <br/>
we were walking with her.  (She lived with us from the time she was 7  <br/>
to 17.)<br/>
<br/>
I had a teacher from 1968 to 1970 (my English teacher for two years)  <br/>
named Jacqui Littlejohn.  The first class I took with her was The  <br/>
Literature of Philosophy, but that was to large extent a cover for  <br/>
her teaching us meditation.  Same as &quot;trancendental meditation,&quot; but  <br/>
honestly?  **without the juju**--she told us which part of the  <br/>
traditions came from Hinduism and such.  She discussed the  <br/>
physiological realities and benefits, and that has always helped me.   <br/>
It&#39;s what I used when Kirby was little and lost his temper so easily.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Littlejohn used to bring New Age guest speakers to talk to us  <br/>
about color energy and healing color and protection from evil spirits  <br/>
and we lived in a superstitious northern New Mexico town already  <br/>
where such beliefs were all around all the time.  People put crosses  <br/>
in the screen of the screen doors with sewing needles--VERY common.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Littlejohn was way into spirit guides and other realms and had  <br/>
been hanging out with people who knew more than she did (which  <br/>
eventually was hard to come by) and she really, really cared.<br/>
<br/>
After she quit teaching, she moved from Santa Fe (she had been  <br/>
teaching in Espanola, where I grew up) to Albuquerque and worked full  <br/>
time as a psychic.  I stayed in contact with her and visited her and  <br/>
she went back up to Espanola with me for one of our class  <br/>
anniversaries (25th, probably).  I went to her funeral, in a  <br/>
wheelchair, which was just a week or so after I got back from the  <br/>
first Live and Learn conference, where I broke my leg.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling this long story to point out that this isn&#39;t something I  <br/>
just heard of lately.  And to distinguish between &quot;New Thought&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;New Age&quot; is a little like picking one definition from a long list  <br/>
and holding it up like a cross to keep out evil.<br/>
<br/>
None of that stuff is new to me.  I do know that Jacqui Littlejohn  <br/>
had a drinking problem and visualized the heck out of money she never  <br/>
got, and that she could easily have been happier, but I loved her and  <br/>
just ignored the parts I didn&#39;t agree with.  She was a good card  <br/>
reader and I always was willing to have her have a go at whatever  <br/>
kind of mindreading she wanted to do, but I never took it to the  <br/>
bank.  She cared more about my past life than I did.<br/>
<br/>
My objections have nothing to do with ignorance, my use of &quot;juju&quot;  <br/>
isn&#39;t new or an error on my part.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Ramtha is a 35000 year-old spirit-warrior who appeared in JZ Knight&#39;s<br/>
kitchen in Tacoma, Washington, in 1977&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://skepdic.com/ramtha.html">http://skepdic.com/ramtha.html</a><br/>
<br/>
JZ Knight is the lady behind the 2004 movie What The Bleep Do We Know?<br/>
There&#39;s a (less than complimentary) critique of the movie at the<br/>
bottom of the above page.<br/>
<br/>
Abraham-Hicks - now a brand name as much as it is a &#39;philosophy of<br/>
life&#39; (and not by accident, so I&#39;ve read) - appears not to be listed<br/>
in the Skeptics Dictionary, so that&#39;s a difference to start with.<br/>
<br/>
Abraham-Hicks is the subject of a more recent movie called The Secret,<br/>
though that&#39;s never actually stated in the movie itself. Most of the<br/>
alleged &quot;Teachers of The Secret&quot; who appear in the movie are personal<br/>
friends of Esther and Jerry Hicks. Esther Hicks was herself in the<br/>
version of The Secret that was originally released in March 2006, but<br/>
she asked to be removed after a falling out with the movie&#39;s producer,<br/>
Australian TV executive Rhonda Byrne, and the movie was re-edited and<br/>
re-released in I think the September.<br/>
<br/>
The Secret reiterates the &quot;quantum flapdoodle&quot; of JZ Knight&#39;s movie<br/>
even though it had already been debunked by real quantum physicists.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s The Secret that has popularised the so-called &#39;Law of Attraction&#39;<br/>
and led people to believe that it&#39;s supported by &quot;proven science&quot;.<br/>
It&#39;s not. When scientists speculate, that&#39;s still speculation not science.<br/>
<br/>
The Secret has also spawned a whole new industry of so-called Law of<br/>
Attraction coaches, most of whom had probably never even heard of the<br/>
idea two years ago, and an online infestation of scumbags out to make<br/>
a buck from offering solutions of various kinds to &quot;why the Law of<br/>
Attraction isn&#39;t working for you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I only heard of the &#39;Law of Attraction&#39; myself about five years ago.<br/>
It was always something that came from Abraham-Hicks as far as I was<br/>
concerned and I didn&#39;t have a problem with Abraham-Hicks. In fact,<br/>
Scott Noelle, the Abraham-Hicks parenting coach, features in one of<br/>
the free e-books I compiled to give away at my website because, out of<br/>
all the parenting &#39;experts&#39; or &#39;specialists&#39; I&#39;ve encountered through<br/>
my newsletter, his parenting philosophy is the closest to my own.<br/>
<br/>
But would I directly help promote Abraham-Hicks ideas about parenting<br/>
through my newsletter? Absolutely not. For me, channeling is in &#39;do<br/>
not touch with a bargepole&#39; territory. Other people are, of course,<br/>
free to believe what suits them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be having some interesting conversations about this at<br/>
the Rethinking Education conference in September. :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701158324">-=-While I can agree that there is an aspect of that in<br/>
every person, it completely ignores that all &quot;feelings/spiritual juju&quot;<br/>
can be trumped with thought.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it can be &quot;trumped,&quot; but it can be thought about and  <br/>
explained with thought (or words that came from thought and  <br/>
observation and news in the field of neurology and biochemistry).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a collection of songs here about love--the physical feeling  <br/>
of being in love.  Holly and her boyfriend are experiencing some of  <br/>
these things now, so it has not been in vain that I&#39;ve been studying  <br/>
the feeling.  There are articles talking about the adaptive behavior  <br/>
of this serious IN-LOVE phase.  It&#39;s not &quot;just&quot; a crush or just  <br/>
infatuation or just puppy love.  It IS infatuation and that IS love  <br/>
at a biochemical level.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a spiritual aspect that is a kind of higher-level  <br/>
intellectual aspect, and has to do with wonder and joy and  <br/>
compassion.  They all have biochemical realities, all those &quot;moods&quot;  <br/>
and states.  A hundred years from now that will probably be really  <br/>
well understood, but they&#39;re not yet, and so people make up stories  <br/>
to make those feelings make sense.  Awe.  Ecstasy.   Those states can  <br/>
be nurtured and encouraged in our children by regular old non- <br/>
jujufied unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-264205707">~~Call it magic, call it juju, call it the universe... thoughts attract<br/>
thoughts.~~<br/>
<br/>
Sort of.<br/>
I do believe that changing one&#39;s thoughts results in different actions<br/>
but my problem with the &quot;law of attraction&quot; is that it seems to forget<br/>
that action can change thoughts.<br/>
It is called a &quot;law of&quot; as though it is some scientific law. It isn&#39;t.<br/>
It&#39;s new age whatever-you-want-to-call-it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that a shift in thinking can come from getting up off your<br/>
butt and DOING something. I also believe that sometimes action follows<br/>
a shift in thought. Either way, sitting around visualizing what you<br/>
want for your life will NOT in and of itself change your life. You<br/>
have to take responsibility for changing your life at some point. You<br/>
have to DO something. Thinking about it results in thinking about it.<br/>
That&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe very much that visualization can be a really helpful tool. I<br/>
believe that giving yourself positive messages is hugely helpful, I<br/>
talk about it all the time at conferences and workshops! However, it&#39;s<br/>
one tool amongst many. It&#39;s not the end-all-be-all only way to change<br/>
your life.<br/>
<br/>
I think we have the power within each of us and relying on &quot;experts&quot;<br/>
or &quot;laws&quot; can leave us feeling that our own power is somehow less. All<br/>
of the answers we need are within us. We don&#39;t need certified leaders<br/>
or dogma or any such thing to find that.<br/>
<br/>
We may need a friend or a mentor or inspiration from each other. We<br/>
may need a kind word or a kick-in-the-toosh or clarification at times.<br/>
We may need discussion or reading or observing. That&#39;s life learning<br/>
for ya! But I get tired of hearing how some anything has all the<br/>
answers. The answers are within people who are willing to question and<br/>
dig inside themselves and be curious.<br/>

I think it does more than that.  It wastes time and energy, and it  <br/>
arranges for a person to blame others whose lives aren&#39;t going well.   <br/>
Without accepting that sometimes shit just happens, everything is  <br/>
turned to cause and effect, reward and punishment, deserved success  <br/>
and earned failure.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not compassionate and it&#39;s not realistic.<br/>
<br/>

forces and astral this&#39;n&#39;that.<br/>

People CAN make choices right away to do better and to be more  <br/>
patient and aware.<br/>

YES.  And if I have something to say, I&#39;m going to say it and put my  <br/>
own real name on it.  I&#39;m not going to claim to know more than I  <br/>
know, I&#39;m not going to quote someone I think is speaking to me, I&#39;m  <br/>
not going to claim any otherworldly authority.  I&#39;m not going to deny  <br/>
something I&#39;ve written and say &quot;Well I was just channeling; those  <br/>
aren&#39;t *my* words.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had an imaginary friend when I was little.  My Papaw sat on him and  <br/>
I cried.  I don&#39;t have imaginary friends now.  I have my kids, who  <br/>
are real in ways some adults aren&#39;t real, and who are still willing  <br/>
for me to share details of their lives so others can get ideas and  <br/>
gain confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Did &quot;Abraham&quot; (any of them) homeschool or unschool?  Or did they just  <br/>
use Hicks to interview people?  Did she homeschool or unschool?<br/>
<br/>
Why go through intermediaries when your kids are in the same room you  <br/>
are?<br/>

what I was hearing hurt because I wasn&#39;t willing to admit that I was the<br/>
source of much of the conflict that was happening in our home.<br/>
<br/>
Things were only going to get better if I was willing to change and hear<br/>
some things that I really didn&#39;t want to.  I still read all your post<br/>
and blogs hoping to learn and change and be a better parent.<br/>
<br/>
Just the last few days dd (10) has been reading some with me.  We read<br/>
about Holly and being brave...Lydia really liked that story about her<br/>
confronting the woman in the bathroom.  We often see things like that<br/>
happen at malls and such, which in all honesty just make me feel like a<br/>
great parent (and probably makes Lydia feel lucky).   I just love that<br/>
Lydia is so interested in hearing these stories and perhaps they will<br/>
help her understand why we&#39;ve chosen to live our life the way we have (a<br/>
lot of her friends are school at homers or public school kids).  I&#39;m<br/>
sure at times she must wonder why we do things so differently??<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m puzzled by this analogy and don&#39;t know what it has to do with  <br/>
clarifying the distinction between two terms.   There is indeed a  <br/>
difference between &quot;New Thought&quot; and &quot;New Age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
New Age is a catch-all term for many, many different practices and  <br/>
beliefs, occult and mystical, eastern and western.  There is no formal  <br/>
organization, structure or ideas that are universally agreed upon.   <br/>
There are no &quot;founders&quot; or tenets.  It&#39;s a term that came into popular  <br/>
use in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s and was a part of the evolution of the self- <br/>
help boon.  Some things that are included in new age are tarot,  <br/>
psychic phenomenon, crystals, reincarnation, and channeling.<br/>
<br/>
New Thought refers to a very specific spiritual movement that has its  <br/>
roots in transcendentalism and Christian mysticism and began in the  <br/>
mid-1800, with more formal organization beginning at the start of the  <br/>
20th century.  It is an organizational umbrella for New Thought  <br/>
centers all of the world and basic tenets are agreed upon.<br/>
<br/>
New Thought does NOT teach, advocate or include tarot, astrology,  <br/>
psychic phenomenon, crystals, reincarnation or channeling.  Although  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t condemn these practices if a person finds them valuable.   <br/>
The basic beliefs include Oneness (that we are all energetically  <br/>
connected to each other and our source) and that changing your  <br/>
thinking can change your life.  These are ideas that are put forth in  <br/>
all major religions when they are stripped of the dogma that man has  <br/>
created around them.   The Association for Global New Thought is a  <br/>
great place to find out more.  www.agnt.org<br/>
<br/>
New Age practices can indeed include many New Thought ideas, but New  <br/>
Thought does not include all things new age.  To use them  <br/>
interchangeably is inaccurate.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050695519">I don&#39;t have a specific problem with the Law of Attraction.  It&#39;s an  <br/>
idea, a thought about how to think.  Years ago I read Sandra&#39;s idea  <br/>
about making a different choice in any given moment, one that moved  <br/>
towards unschooling instead of away from it.  It&#39;s also an idea, a  <br/>
thought about how to think.  They have both been meaningful ideas for  <br/>
me, helped me to see ways that I could make changes in my own life.<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t really care how these ideas come into being --   <br/>
visualized, channelled, or popped into creation while taking a  <br/>
shower.   It&#39;s what I *do* with these ideas that matters to me.  And  <br/>
where I place the power, that&#39;s critical.  I agree with Ren, who said  <br/>
&quot;The answers are within people who are willing to question and dig  <br/>

I totally agree.<br/>
Some people find a tool useful for a while, to help them shift their<br/>
thinking. Great!<br/>
But more often than not, I see people who have rejected mainstream<br/>
religions and are quite willing to accept ANY New Age rhetoric or<br/>
whatever they&#39;ve decided is better than the mainstream version,<br/>
without question. That drives me bonkers. <br/>
<br/>
The Law of Attraction stuff has it&#39;s value, but it&#39;s nothing new.<br/>
&quot;Positive thinking&quot; and other such forms have been around for a long<br/>
time. My issues with it aren&#39;t about the part on shifting your<br/>
thoughts to positive...that&#39;s usually a great idea.:)<br/>
<br/>
When people believe that how they think will bring certain events into<br/>
their lives (and that again is true to a certain degree because if we<br/>
are AWARE we see opportunity we otherwise miss) I really wonder if<br/>
they realize the importance of changing actions and making better<br/>
choices,not just thinking about it.<br/>
<br/>
The kid that gets raped isn&#39;t thinking negative thoughts. My Mom<br/>
didn&#39;t die because of my thoughts. Shit happens and what we are<br/>

with those situations.  The changes we make can indeed affect our  <br/>
future.  And there are situations that we absolutely play apart in  <br/>
getting ourselves into.  For example, it&#39;s not blame or guilt to help  <br/>
a person see how their lack of self-esteem or self-worth actually did  <br/>
play a part in them being victimized or taken advantage of.  It&#39;s  <br/>
cruel NOT to help people change what they have the power to change  <br/>
within themselves so that they have happier, brighter experiences.   <br/>
What we do and how we think today does help create better tomorrows  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t condemn New Thought if a person finds it valuable, but to  <br/>
lead anyone else to believe that it&#39;s a part of Unschooling does  <br/>
neither Unschooling nor New Thought any good.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a kind of homeschooling.  Within homeschooling groups  <br/>
and discussions, unschooling is a specific and important  <br/>
distinction.  From the outside, it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
 From the inside of new age practices New Thought is a specific and  <br/>
important distinction.  From the outside, it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about what a good match the SCA and unschooling  <br/>
are and yet I have no desire nor need to create a group about it nor  <br/>
to have a conference about it, nor to have unschooling workshops at  <br/>
SCA events nor to encourage others to join the SCA.<br/>
<br/>
The way that New Thought can help an unschooling family is the way  <br/>
ideas from ANY religion or an ethical society or involvement in Yoga  <br/>
or traditional martial arts can help a family.  So if the general  <br/>
terms can be discussed that&#39;s great!  If a workshop at an  <br/>
international conference (or a whole long series of workshops) is  <br/>
help, no problem.  If the workshop becomes associated with one  <br/>
religion (as most homeschooling conferences are) it seems good and  <br/>
honest to let people know BEFORE they sign up for it.<br/>
<br/>
Most homeschooling conferences are run by Christian organizations,  <br/>
and have more vendors and vending than speakers and workshops.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
been to a couple of conferences where there were speakers talking  <br/>
about the role of men to lead their families the importance of  <br/>
keeping children safe from the world.  It&#39;s not pretty.  One of them  <br/>
was pretty clearly advertised.  The other was not, and the keynote  <br/>
speaker (intro and closing) was VERY much a &quot;Focus on the Family&quot;  <br/>
kind of guy (not in a general way but in a registered trademark James  <br/>
Dobson kind of way.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/">http://www.focusonthefamily.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I can (and have) mentioned the value of historical reenactment for  <br/>
those who like such things.  So have other people.  Within historical  <br/>
reenactment, the SCA is very specific and sometimes not respected at  <br/>
all.  But within historical reenactment, they all know and  <br/>
acknowledge that the SCA was there before most of the other groups  <br/>
and has spawned some very cool research and activity.   That&#39;s too  <br/>
much information for this list, though.  SOME of it is useful, but  <br/>
not a total parallel of one particular hobby (no matter that within  <br/>
it are dozens of hobbies--armor making, calligraphy, cooking, music,  <br/>
costuming, needlework, shoemaking...) and unschooling would be  <br/>
misleading and irritating to people who aren&#39;t in the SCA.<br/>

not at all religious.  Pam is; Joyce is; lots of people on this list  <br/>
are, but you don&#39;t even know it because it&#39;s not necessary for  <br/>
understanding how we can help our children see the world with wonder  <br/>
and awe without adding creationism or reincarnation or intentionality  <br/>
or ANY big word with a long explanation.<br/>
<br/>
A butterfly can be fantastically awe-inspiring and even moreso (in my  <br/>
opinion) if the mom doesn&#39;t jump in to tell the kid that the  <br/>
butterfly proves that God created the universe and non-Christians are  <br/>
dopes, or that the butterfly will die and come back as a bird, or  <br/>
that the butterfly is there because the child draws beauty to him.   <br/>
JUST LOOK AT THE BUTTERFLY!!!  Let the child start coming to his own  <br/>
conclusions.<br/>

Gaining insight from ANYTHING is cool. I read the educational  <br/>
psychology studies and gain insight from them. But I don&#39;t have to  <br/>
believe in them - in fact, I read them VERY critically and keep in  <br/>
mind the context and underlying assumptions of the investigators.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says that they are &quot;channeling&quot; some sort of wisdom, I flat  <br/>
out do not believe it.  I&#39;m not going to pretend that I do. I&#39;ve seen  <br/>
no convincing evidence to support it and lots of evidence of  <br/>
charlatans. What they SAY might still be interesting and valuable, but  <br/>
their credibility is damaged for me, by the paranormal claims. Still,  <br/>
I&#39;ll read what they say and take it at face value as much as I can and  <br/>
gain what insight is there for me to gain. Again, though, as with  <br/>
reading anything else, I&#39;m reading critically.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;critically&quot; I do not mean trying to find fault, I mean evaluating,  <br/>

conclusions.<br/>
<br/>
It would be good if people were careful not to confuse any particular  <br/>
belief system with unschooling, particularly with radical  <br/>
unschooling.  It is hard enough for people to absorb and &quot;get&quot; what is  <br/>
meant by radical unschooling without it being embedded in a certain  <br/>
new age OR new thought OR any other belief system. For those who do  <br/>
believe in some particular thing, I see no problem at all in  <br/>
discussing it openly, forming lists with like-minded people, etc.  <br/>
Just, please, make it clear you are a subset of a larger population of  <br/>
unschoolers, not THE population. And if we go out speaking at  <br/>
conferences or to the public about unschooling AND a particular belief  <br/>
system, we should say so up front as in, &quot;I am talking about  <br/>
unschooling AND .....&quot; whatever it is. Anything less is less than  <br/>
honest. If someone was promoting Bible-based unschooling or using the  <br/>
Koran as the basis of understanding unschooling, I&#39;d say the same  <br/>
thing - please identify your starting point and be honest about what  <br/>
you&#39;re really supporting - a religion AND unschooling.<br/>

&gt; thing - please identify your starting point and be honest about what<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re really supporting - a religion AND unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  I agree 100% with this.<br/>
<br/>
And to clarify the whole Abe-Hicks quote:  Esther Hicks in no way  <br/>
tries to represent herself as anything to do with unschooling.  In  <br/>
fact, recently a friend of mine mentioned to her something about  <br/>
unschooling and she said, &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;   Personally I have found  <br/>
many of their quotes inspirational and supportive of respectful  <br/>
parenting and the principles of unschooling.  For me, they were the  <br/>
first to plant the seed many years ago when talking about Sudbury.   <br/>
Because of their reference, I read the book, &quot;Free at Last&quot; and a door  <br/>
to a new way of thinking about education and children opened for me.   <br/>
Then years later I discovered John Holt and Unschooling and a bigger  <br/>
door opened.  That was my path and my connection to Unschooling and  <br/>
Abe-Hicks.  Esther Hicks makes no claim to unschooling and I don&#39;t  <br/>
believe she has any desire to be known at all in the unschooling  <br/>
world.  They are just saying what they are saying, going along their  <br/>
path.  And some of it gives me inspiration on my unschooling journey.   <br/>
I would never ever have brought up Abe-Hicks on this list if Sandra  <br/>
hadn&#39;t opened up the topic.  I would never represent unschooling as an  <br/>
off-shoot of my spiritual philosophy.  I&#39;m on a journey, talking and  <br/>
growing with others and it&#39;s helpful for me to put it all into context  <br/>
with regard to my spiritual beliefs.  If others find that helpful, I&#39;m  <br/>
happy to join in conversation with them.  But it&#39;s alway with the  <br/>
understanding that these are my beliefs AND unschooling, not just  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for helping to clarify that.<br/>
