<br/>
It was drilled into me, but it was simply modelled for my children. They do it because it&#39;s polite and considerate and ...well... it works down here.<br/>
<br/>
Y&#39;all&#39;ve told horror stories about yankees coming down here, but I have a friend who moved to NJ and was SLAPPED repeatedly by a teacher for &quot;sassing&quot;---so it&#39;s NOT a one way street!<br/>
<br/>
Because Cameron calls Sandra by her first name (the way she was introduced to him and how he &#39;knows&#39; her), he *might* not use ma&#39;am with her *as much*. But he more than likely *will* &quot;sir&quot; Keith---and strangers.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on where I am, that ma&#39;am can go a long way---the Southern accent (and mine is NOT that heavy, y&#39;all!!) and ma&#39;aming and sir-ing is considered charming! &lt;g&gt;  The &quot;yeahs, yeps, naws, and nopes&quot; don&#39;t go nearly as far in ANY part of the country and are definitely considered rude here! <br/>
<br/>
When in Rome,....  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it should be forced on anyone, but I also don&#39;t think you should expect a Southerner NOT to use it. And I think someone who moves down here should know what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
Some cultures are more formal---German and Spanish, for instance, both have a familiar and a formal &quot;you&quot;---and as an outsider, you don&#39;t start using the familiar until asked to.<br/>
<br/>
So---although as Sandra said---that the SCA doesn&#39;t mix up the past with the present, someone coming in from another culture shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
so unaware of the cultural norms and blatantly disregard them or put them down.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I realize that it&#39;s degrading to children---when forced. But it doesn&#39;t have to be. <br/>
<br/>
For the record, I DON&#39;T believe it should be forced on to children---but I DO believe that it can be modeled---and not *just* towards adults, but towards everyone.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Right. Sandra said to tell Cameron to &quot;just don&#39;t&quot;. It&#39;s not that easy. <br/>
It&#39;s what we DO. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll endure it and try to be philosophical, but I will twitch every time <br/>
inside.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Because Cameron calls Sandra by her first name (the way she was introduced <br/>

But he more than likely *will* &quot;sir&quot; Keith---and strangers.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Texans do it.  SE New Mexico does it.  Most of my cousins were made to do it <br/>
(upon pain of being backhanded or otherwise humiliated, so there&#39;s respect for <br/>
ya).<br/>
<br/>
My parents both said &quot;yes ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;yes sir&quot; to the telephone operator, to <br/>
anyone they talked to, even after they moved out of Texas.   And they were <br/>
mousie people to a large extent and I couldn&#39;t separate the two things in my <br/>
mind.  It seemed they really felt inferior to just about everyone around them.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t think it should be forced on anyone, but I also don&#39;t think you <br/>
should expect a Southerner NOT to use it. And I think someone who moves down <br/>
here should know what to expect.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all true.  There are cultural realities.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Some cultures are more formal---German and Spanish, for instance, both <br/>
have a familiar and a formal &quot;you&quot;---and as an outsider, you don&#39;t start using <br/>
the familiar until asked to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
English did too, not so long ago.  The formal is what we kept.  The familiar <br/>
we only keep in prayers to God.  And it&#39;s been long enough and is foreign <br/>
enough to native English speakers, that they assume thee and thou are the formal <br/>
(because God&#39;s scary in English), but it&#39;s the other away around.  In languages <br/>
in which they&#39;re aware that they&#39;re speaking to God in buddy terms, not <br/>
uber-formal terms, I think it makes a difference in their perception of their <br/>
closeness to God.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For the record, I DON&#39;T believe it should be forced on to children---but I <br/>
DO believe that it can be modeled---and not *just* towards adults, but <br/>
towards everyone.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I hear people say &quot;sir&quot; or &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; toward children, I cringe, because <br/>
I&#39;ve usually heard it in preparation for some sarcasm or other put-down, in the <br/>
context of telling them they&#39;re too big for their britches or other cliche <br/>
(and as cliche, said without much thought) kid-insults.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So---although as Sandra said---that the SCA doesn&#39;t mix up the past with <br/>
the present, someone coming in from another culture shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
<br/>
so unaware of the cultural norms and blatantly disregard them or put them <br/>
down.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think if people can&#39;t adjust, they shouldn&#39;t live where that&#39;s the norm.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a friend 40 years older than I was when I was 21 and she was 63 or so.  <br/>
 It seemed like a LOT more years then than it does now. &lt;g&gt;  I never, ever <br/>
could call her her first name.  I always called her &quot;Mrs. Prather.&quot;  We were <br/>
next door neighbors for a while, and shared a two-room portable classroom <br/>
building for a year.  And our neighbor at our old neighborhood, who only had one <br/>
child far away, we used to check on her and help take care of her and do her erra<br/>
nds and repairs a lot.  I always called her Mrs. Carter, and nothing else.  But <br/>
though I loved them and cried when they died, I didn&#39;t say &quot;Yes Ma&#39;am,&quot; never <br/>
once, and they might&#39;ve been surprised if I had.  <br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s something deeper than just the words.<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, maybe you or Ben know this, about the military.  I&#39;ve heard the army, <br/>
especially, is heavily composed of people from the southeastern U.S.  A <br/>
disproportionate number of southerners.   If that&#39;s so, do you think there&#39;s a <br/>
relationship?  Or is one the chicken and one the egg?<br/>

someone wheose name I don&#39;t know, especially if they&#39;re not looking at me<br/>
right then. Like, if I&#39;m wanting to ask someone the time, I&#39;ll say,<br/>
&quot;Excuse me, sir, could you tell me what time it is?&quot; I do think I&#39;m more<br/>
likely to use them when I want to make it especially clear that I&#39;m being<br/>
respectful of the other person. I don&#39;t ever use them when I know the<br/>
perrson, though. That sounds odd to me. <br/>
<br/>
Rain uses the words in the same context, I think. <br/>

We&#39;ve only lived in the midwest, southwest, and west-west. Actually, Rain<br/>
has only lived in Arizona and California, but I was born in Ohio and<br/>
lived in Kansas and Maryland, too. The whole southern thing seems really<br/>
foreign to me...<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve discussed this several times ourselves---and just had another long one just now. Keep in mind that these are our thoughts---and not &quot;truth&quot;---observations and ideas that Ben & I have thrown around a lot!<br/>
<br/>
I believe that, like in Europe, the officers were the ones who owned land, who owned horses, and who essentially ran the show. The north was colononized by the poor of Europe---those who were escaping. The South was colonized by wealthy British landowners, whose land was granted to them by the king (check out the state names: Maryland, Virginia, Carolinas, Georgia---royal references). They owned land and horses---and they became the officers. So....they made the military rules and regulations. Now it&#39;s just become tradition and form following function.<br/>
<br/>
Southerners made up the majority of officers in the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the War Between the States---because they had horses and money and could fund the war effort. They also brought many of their servants (not slaves) and farmworkers as aids and enlisted personnel because of trust and duty. Kind of &#39;feudal&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I think Southerners have always felt a bit more of a sense of duty to country because so many of the &#39;big&#39; original settlers still held an allegiance to the king---they were here not to escape tyranny, but to get MORE!&lt;g&gt; I also think it&#39;s not so great a leap to go from taking orders from the king of England to taking them from the president! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Southerners are also more comfortable with the chain of command and deference to authority. BUT, because of the legacy of rank (granted by the king), I think Southerners don&#39;t like to take orders from &quot;lessers&quot;----which is how they viewed the northern settlers/states. <br/>
<br/>
I think the early establishment of the US military, which was based on European model, simply kept a lot of the European system---which WAS based on rank. It just so happened that so was the South. I think it&#39;s a bit more clear than the Chicken and the Egg. I think it&#39;s a higher sense of duty to country as well as a comfort level with rank (sir & ma&#39;am) that encourages more Southerners to join the service. (Being a redneck may have something to do with it too! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
It is truly considered *honorable* to serve in the military here, as opposed to in other regions of the country where it is often seen as a last resort.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been a military (Air Force) wife for 2+ years now and many of <br/>
the wives are southern. Maybe the men are too and just don&#39;t have the <br/>
accent, but in our neighborhood--on base--the southern women <br/>
outnumber everyone else! My husband thought I was making a joke about <br/>
it, and then every new neighbor we met proved my point. He says he <br/>
must have have missed the memo and that&#39;s why he married a California <br/>
girl. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told ds that adults like to be called sir and ma&#39;am and so far <br/>
he&#39;s decided that he doesn&#39;t want to use it, but he said he will use <br/>
other forms of &quot;good manners&quot; like please and thank you. Now I&#39;ve <br/>
been modeling it more to both kids. Funny to hear them use it on each <br/>
other. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s already known to one neighbor for &quot;talking back&quot; because when <br/>
she told the boys to get out of her daughter&#39;s room, Mikey explained <br/>
that the girl had told them it was okay. Err, sounds like he was <br/>
telling her something quite relevant to me, actually. <br/>
<br/>
So how does it work between adults? Do you say it to every stranger <br/>
or are there situations/people you wouldn&#39;t use it in/on? I still <br/>
just can not wrap my brain around the military rank idea, esp. that <br/>
enlisted and officers aren&#39;t supposed to socialize with each other <br/>
(the A.F. seems to be more relaxed about that than other services) <br/>
and the southern sir and ma&#39;ams just confuse me more!<br/>

Oh, that reminded me to actually order the book in my Amazon cart: <br/>
_Albion&#39;s Seed: Four British Folkways in America_ by David Hackett <br/>
Fischer. Described thus:<br/>
<br/>
This cultural history explains the European settlement of the United <br/>
States as voluntary migrations from four English cultural centers. <br/>
Families of zealous, literate Puritan yeomen and artisans from <br/>
urbanized East Anglia established a religious community in <br/>
Massachusetts (1629-40); royalist cavaliers headed by Sir William <br/>
Berkeley and young, male indentured servants from the south and west <br/>
of England built a highly stratified agrarian way of life in Virginia <br/>
(1640-70); egalitarian Quakers of modest social standing from the <br/>
North Midlands resettled in the Delaware Valley and promoted a social <br/>
pluralism (1675-1715); and, in by far the largest migration (1717-<br/>
75), poor borderland families of English, Scots, and Irish fled a <br/>
violent environment to seek a better life in a similarly uncertain <br/>
American backcountry. These four cultures, reflected in regional <br/>
patterns of language, architecture, literacy, dress, sport, social <br/>
structure, religious beliefs, and familial ways, persisted in the <br/>
American settlements. The final chapter shows the significance of <br/>
these regional cultures for American history up to the present. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>All strangers, unless they show me that they are not deserving of my respect. Definitely the elderly. <br/>
<br/>
Those in service positions are expected to use it here: restaurant wait staff, hoteliers, your plumber. I used it as a dog groomer with my clients. Generally lawyers use it with their clients and clients with their lawyers. Ditto with doctors and policemen. Judges get it from *everybody*! &lt;g&gt;  Teachers tend to let you know what they expect: those that &quot;ain&#39;t from around here&quot; tend to let it slide.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, if you would call someone by his first name, you lose the &quot;sir&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
As an officer&#39;s wife, I&#39;m an anomaly. I &quot;sir&quot; Ben&#39;s sergeants. Many of them are (well, *were*) older than Ben! (So did Ben as a lieutenant---one of his NCOs had to call him on it. He told Ben in NO uncertain terms NOT to do it anymore. Ben had a well-bitten tongue for weeks! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found that too. But we became pretty close with several of Ben&#39;s sergeants and their wives. One started calling Ben by his first name. Ben had to tell him that he had to knock that off. So---here they were, playing racketball: Ben would say , &quot;Good shot, Joe!&quot; and he would say, &quot;Nice shot, sir!&quot; &lt;g&gt; But that&#39;s part of the game. If you don&#39;t like it (or can&#39;t handle it), get out.<br/>
<br/>
Fraternization is NOT just in the military. I enforced it when we had a restaurant. As manager, I didn&#39;t associate with my waitstaff (although we were very friendly). My brother DID---he&#39;d go out and get drunk and party with the staff. They lost a lot of respect for him when they&#39;d see him at his worst. <br/>
<br/>
Ben says that the military is different. As an officer, Ben has the responsibility to send men into harm&#39;s way. NCOs cannot do that unless there is no officer there. Ben can&#39;t be deciding which men to send into battle based on whom he likes most. It *must* be based on what&#39;s best for the unit. <br/>

&gt;North Midlands resettled in the Delaware Valley and promoted a social <br/>
&gt;pluralism (1675-1715); and, in by far the largest migration (1717-<br/>

&gt;violent environment to seek a better life in a similarly uncertain <br/>
&gt;American backcountry. These four cultures, reflected in regional <br/>
&gt;patterns of language, architecture, literacy, dress, sport, social <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s just what always bothered me about yes, ma&#39;am and no, sir.<br/>
I seem to be of the opposite philosophy, I&#39;ll be curteous to <br/>
everyone but respect from me comes from knowledge of people and if <br/>
they&#39;ve showed me they deserve my respect.  I would happily say yes, <br/>
ma&#39;am and no, sir to my aunt and uncle in NC if they wanted me too.<br/>
I respect and like them tons.<br/>
<br/>
I believe I know some of the reasons why came to my ideas about <br/>
respecting people.  When I was a child and told I needed to respect <br/>
my elders (in the north) just because they were older than me.  I <br/>
began to dislike automatic respect because the people that always <br/>
told me I &#39;had&#39; to respect them always seemed to be the ones that <br/>
deserved it the least.  I remember getting in big trouble once in <br/>
school and once in church for no showing &#39;enough&#39; respect to my <br/>
elders (I believe I was supposedly back talking).  I thought <br/>
blakkk!!  Do they deserve my respect?  Usually they didn&#39;t, they <br/>
were bullying me and I even saw it as a child.<br/>
<br/>
Even once I enlisted in the AF I wouldn&#39;t say all the sir&#39;s and  <br/>
such unless I was flat out told I had to or would get some kind of <br/>
written reprimand(happened only once or twice).  When I joined at 18 <br/>
to get away from home I guess I didn&#39;t think about &#39;having&#39; to say, <br/>
ma&#39;am and such.  Yes, ma&#39;am and such in basic training (boot camp) <br/>
just seemed like a part of the game of being degraded and made to <br/>
feel little, as well as being yelled at ect.  At my first base <br/>
though yet again some enlisted person who was in my classes and <br/>
around my same age with a slightly higher rank than me (he had some <br/>
college) insisted I say yes, sir ect. to him.  He was definitely <br/>
from the south somewhere.  He so... didn&#39;t deserve such formal <br/>
respect imo then (none of us liked him) and I couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
it.  That was the start of my AF career.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He may have spent some time at a military college and got booted out and felt he deserved some warped sense of respect. Ben says: a prick! <br/>
<br/>
As a second lieutenant, Ben would not have to &quot;sir&quot; a first lieutenant. He *might* &quot;sir&quot; a captain (depending on the relationship), he regularly &quot;sir-ed&quot; majors and above.<br/>
<br/>
Enlisted &quot;sir&quot; high-up NCO&#39;s---especially the highest ranking NCO&#39;s on base---but most of that is out of real respect for the person. It&#39;s not a requirement. <br/>
<br/>
Ben says that there&#39;s mandated stuff---and then there are the intangibles. All things being equal-ish (like your story above) Ben says he divides it 30/30/30. 30% is respect for the rank (that&#39;s mandated). 30% is respect for the office he holds, and 30% is for the person. <br/>
<br/>
Ben pins on LtCol this year and is squadron commander. He is mandated to receive his &quot;sirs&quot; because of his rank of LtCol. He gets a certain amount of respect as squadron commander, because it&#39;s pretty important. But the last 30% is his alone to earn as the person. <br/>
<br/>
This guy you described should not have been sir-ed nor did he deserve it.<br/>

The Sunday school teacher was a female member of the church, who had <br/>
two children about my age.  She told our class that for the duration of <br/>
the CCD class we would be expected to tithe from our allowances and any <br/>
other money we received -- birthday gifts, etc. -- so that she could <br/>
send in the money we collected each week to the Pope so he could use it <br/>
to feed hungry children around the world.<br/>
<br/>
I was really affected by her description of the hungry children, and <br/>
had what I thought was a brilliant idea -- I raised my hand and asked <br/>
why, since the Pope owned all those valuable paintings and other <br/>
treasures in the Vatican, couldn&#39;t he just sell them and then he&#39;d have <br/>
enough money to feed all the hungry people in the whole world?!<br/>
<br/>
Well, after standing there dumbfounded for about 3 minutes, she <br/>
completely freaked out on me and sent me home.  (She knew I lived <br/>
within walking distance.)  Later that evening, the monk who ran the <br/>
program called my parents and said I wouldn&#39;t be allowed back unless I <br/>
promised never to ask another question in class (this wasn&#39;t the first <br/>
time I stumped her, I guess).  My parents later told me Brother Jerry <br/>
thought the whole thing was pretty funny, but he wasn&#39;t about to side <br/>
with a child against an adult, (and neither would my parents, even <br/>
though now they tell the story with a weird sort of pride) so that was <br/>
that ...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep! That&#39;s pretty much what I thought at the time.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
The two striper was actually a pretty nice guy until he was made troop<br/>
leader of our little group- they did that in my tech. school.  It went<br/>
down from there.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well when you join the military at the very bottom of the pile you<br/>
pretty much need to sir everybody (or at least think you do after<br/>
basic-boot camp).  I remember seeing in tech. school (19 years old, 18<br/>
years ago) a TSgt., I laugh now at how most of us then thought that<br/>
rank was such a big deal.  He was so cool too, we thought that was<br/>
just amazing!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This probably happens sometimes but my own experience would say that<br/>
yes, sirs are not usually out of real respect for the NCO person by<br/>
other enlisted.  It was usually more of a formality or respect for the<br/>
position, at least among the enlisted I ever knew.  Most of the AF<br/>
members I knew were from all over the states and not predominately the<br/>
south, maybe making a difference.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What an interesting way of looking at it.  :o)   My Dh, Mark, said he<br/>
always said his sir&#39;s in the military for the rank not the person (his<br/>
dad retired enlisted AF).<br/>
<br/>

Congratulations to you both, Kelly and Ben, on Ben&#39;s promotion.  :-)    <br/>
My dorm roommate after tech. school was my squadron commanders secretary. <br/>
I&#39;m sure Ben easily earns others respect, in the military and out of<br/>
it.  As do you. :-)<br/>

&gt; at  a cocktail party.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I would do that. I think that I&#39;m a lot more comfortable with<br/>
someone of high &quot;status&quot; (power, etc) saying it to someone of lower<br/>
&quot;status&quot;, rather than the other way around. Actually, I guess I&#39;m most<br/>
likely to use the words when I&#39;m trying to sort of reassure the other<br/>
person of my respect when he or she is in a situation when he or she<br/>
might be perceived as having lower status. Like, if I see an elderly<br/>
person struggling to open a door I might say, &quot;Let me get that for you,<br/>
sir,&quot;  and the unspoken message is &quot;I see you as a person who is worthy<br/>
of respect even though you can do longer open this door by yourself.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I went to a library book sale at 9 am on a Saturday morning a few weeks<br/>
ago, in sort of a &quot;rough&quot; town. There was a man who had gotten drunk and<br/>
injured himself during the night lying in the library doorway, and there<br/>
were paramedics and police officers talking with him and preparing him<br/>
for transport to a hospital. They were all calling him &quot;Sir&quot;. This is<br/>
northern California, not the south atall, but two or three different<br/>
people all called him &quot;Sir&quot;. I think they were trying to send the same<br/>
message of respect.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked Rain if she ever called people Sir or Ma&#39;am. She says she<br/>
does when she&#39;s ushering for the local theatre - &quot;Excuse me, ma&#39;am,<br/>
there&#39;s no food allowed in the theatre,&quot; or if she&#39;s asking someone in<br/>
the mall what time it is (which she doesn&#39;t do anymore since she has a<br/>
cell phone, anyway.) I thought the first example was interesting, anyway.<br/>
She&#39;s a child telling an adult what to do, and calling her Ma&#39;am. To her<br/>
- to me, in our culture - those are terms of courtesy and respect. In<br/>
other situations, they&#39;re ways of reinforcing a power discrepancy. <br/>

<br/>
I do the same thing, such as the other night when I was inquiring where the<br/>
restroom was from a mature looking worker in a Best Buy (possible a<br/>
supervisor) - I feel sometimes it reinforces a formality of the<br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I find, particularly as I get older one thing I do resent is youthful<br/>
cashiers, on receiving my credit card or ID, deciding to call me &quot;Robyn&quot;.<br/>
Most of the time I get &quot;Mizz Coburn&quot;, but every now and then in stores that<br/>
pride themselves on being hip or trendy. I was watching &quot;Are You Being<br/>
Served&quot; today - classic Britcom with multiple opportunities to be<br/>
offensively non-PC yet they got away with it. They continually call each<br/>
other Mr, Miss or Mrs despite working with each other constantly. <br/>
<br/>
I also remember working in the theatre in Sydney, where there was a triple<br/>
tier of formal address. With the exception of addressing the biggest star<br/>
and the Producers, the Americans were more egalitarian and informal, than we<br/>
were (Australians) but visiting British performers and those from the Opera<br/>
were most formal, and had more of an expectation of deference. (BTW if you<br/>
ever want to blasted try calling &quot;Dame Edna&quot; Mr. Humphries while she is<br/>
wearing her heeled pumps - it didn&#39;t happen to me but I know someone). <br/>
<br/>
When working on a movie I always initially address the actors with the<br/>
appropriate honorific - although the usual response is &quot;Call me Malcolm&quot; (or<br/>
what ever). My late FIL, whom always engendered instant awe just by his<br/>
presence, always said, &quot;It&#39;s Jim&quot; to everyone on the set. There is a lot of<br/>
&quot;Yes, boss&quot; within departments, &quot;What do you need, bro?&quot; between colleagues<br/>
of close or equal status, but the use of &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; and &quot;sir&quot; to department<br/>
heads and the Director, but in a friendly manner. Producers get Mr. or Ms. -<br/>
at least to their faces - unless they also say &quot;Mr. Smith is my father, call<br/>
me Bill.&quot; (The most common response from men is that line.)<br/>
<br/>
Jayn has called people &quot;miss&quot; or &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; or &quot;sir&quot; if they are strangers and<br/>
she is trying to get their attention. &quot;Excuse me miss, I want a hot dog.&quot; It<br/>
seems to tickle them.<br/>

gap, you jump in and then wave and smile to thank the person behind you for<br/>
not speeding up to close the gap ;-)<br/>

Well, Joyce is being incredibly generous in her description of Boston drivers! &lt;g&gt; &quot;Aren&#39;t too kind&quot;??? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always thought of myself as a rather aggressive driver, but Boston puts even Ls Angeles to shame! &lt;bwg&gt;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There were no gaps! lol  And everyone was driving REALLY fast, and I <br/>
was SURE if I pulled out in front of one of them I&#39;d get hit. <br/>
<br/>
I did notice a change on the interstate as I got closer to Boston.  <br/>
In Pennsylvania, people make sure it&#39;s clear before they switch <br/>
lanes.  In Massachusetts, when you&#39;re driving in a lane you have to <br/>
make sure that the person switching lanes doesn&#39;t hit you. ;)  <br/>
<br/>
I LOVE Boston, but I found it much more enjoyable when I parked at <br/>
the (Framingham I think?) train station and took the subway into <br/>
Boston.  I have deep admiration for people who can handle Boston <br/>
driving.  They have a skill that I simply don&#39;t possess. lol <br/>

The police &quot;sir&quot; the heck out of people they pull over or tell them to get out of the way.   Not sure about paramedics.  When I&#39;ve been involved with them it was because an elderly neighbor was needing help, and they would be asking me questions about the neighbor who was less able to communicate.  Don&#39;t remember &quot;ma&#39;am&quot; but I wasn&#39;t the medically-in-need individually.<br/>
