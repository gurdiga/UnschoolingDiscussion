&lt;&lt; But my point was that superintendents are *not* the NEA.  At least they <br/>
don&#39;t belong to the union here in BC.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know the current situation but when I was teaching I was a member of <br/>
both the NEA and also, part of the time, of the AFT (American Federation of <br/>
Teachers).  The former pressed the idea that they were a professional <br/>
association, not a union.  And administrators belonged.  The latter was a <br/>
teamster union, and not even principals could be members, only teachers <br/>
without administrative power.<br/>
<br/>
I was nominated for AFT offices two years before I quit.   I said &quot;Oh, no, <br/>
thanks, no, couldn&#39;t really.&quot;  I was nominated for three offices.  I was <br/>
really young. They liked my energy.   (I think that means there was a lot of <br/>
work to do that the older teachers didn&#39;t want to do.  I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t get <br/>
more involved.)<br/>
<br/>
All the NEA has to do to SUPPORT homeschooling is to lobby for a change in <br/>
the way schools get their funding.  I wish the fact that my kids are not in <br/>
school would be a benefit to the local schools--that they would still have <br/>
that share of the money without my kids being any part of it.  If that were <br/>
to be accomplished--funding by population regardless of enrollment, or <br/>
something, then schools would be encouraging kids to get out so there would <br/>
be more room for other kids and the money would go farther.<br/>

taxes to have kids &quot;educated&quot; then I think the moneys gathered from <br/>
those taxes should be given to the parents of each school-age child <br/>
to use in &quot;educating&quot; their child the way they see fit.  Money is <br/>
very mismanaged by most schools. When we lived in Anchorage they <br/>
tried to institute a registration fee of around $50 or $60 per student<br/>
(it has been almost 5 years since we left there. I don&#39;t remember the <br/>
exact amount). The administrators promised that the money from this <br/>
fee would go directly to the classroom teacher of the student it was <br/>
paid for so that teacher would have more money for classroom <br/>
supplies. Well, in jr high and sr high kids have several teachers, so <br/>
that money wouldn&#39;t have gone far. I had kids in both elementary and <br/>
jr high at the time. I asked the teachers of all of my kids if the <br/>
extra money was helping. Each and every one of them said that they <br/>
never saw a penny of that extra money. One parent went to court to <br/>
fight the fee and won since public education is supposed to <br/>
be &quot;free&quot;. The schools still charged it, but they were supposed to <br/>
tell you that it was optional...they didn&#39;t. When I registered my <br/>
daughter for jr high, they were telling everyone that they couldn&#39;t <br/>
get their child&#39;s schedule until the fee was paid, (unless you were <br/>
on the reduced lunch program.go figure!). Only if you refused to pay, <br/>
did they say it was optional. But you had to go to the principal and <br/>
get a waiver before they would let you get the schedule, even if you <br/>
were on the reduced lunch program. And the principal would give you a <br/>
hard time about it, even if you were on the reduced lunch program. So <br/>
the parents who didn&#39;t have the guts or the knowledge to speak up, <br/>
wound up paying the fee; which wasn&#39;t even going where the <br/>
administrators promised. I was one of the few parents who had the <br/>
guts to speak up when I registered my daughter. Even though we were <br/>
on the reduced lunch program, I told the principal that I wanted a <br/>
waiver but not the one that said I wasn&#39;t paying due to the fact of <br/>
being on that program. I wanted a waiver that simply said that I <br/>
didn&#39;t have to pay because the &quot;fee&quot; was optional. The principals of <br/>
both schools my kids were attending gave me the waiver, but only <br/>
after giving me a hard time about it. When schools get more money, it <br/>
is usually wasted. That has been my experience.<br/>

<br/>
 My point was predicated on what the NEA could do to support homeschooling <br/>
(i.e. to encourage more homeschoolers) and have more money too.  If the <br/>
argument is they want us back so they have money, let them have the money and <br/>
let us out!!  Then they not only will be glad some people took their kids <br/>
home, they&#39;ll want more to do so.<br/>
