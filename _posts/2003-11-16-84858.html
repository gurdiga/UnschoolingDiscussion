<div id="ygrps-yiv-21124420"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Would like to hear any thoughts re: pets death and grieving times<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really think people should just do what works for their own situation. If your kids are happy about getting another pet, then they&#39;re ready. Delayed grief can happen whether you get another pet or not. And it&#39;s not going to mess up any grieving process!:)<br/>
A book that is truly wonderful for kids in any kind of grieving process is called &quot;It must hurt a lot&quot; about a boy that loses his dog and what he learns through the process of hurting.<br/>
It touches on some of the typical things people say or do to try and be helpful, but isn&#39;t actually helpful for someone that is grieving.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll see if I can&#39;t find my copy and tell you who the author is, maybe look it up at half.com?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-729801962">Thanks Ren,  I&#39;ll check it out.  I must say our vet gave us a <br/>
wonderful memory book to work on and fill out.  Places for pics <br/>
too.  They have picked that up at intervals.<br/>
