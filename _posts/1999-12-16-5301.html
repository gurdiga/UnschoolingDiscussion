<div id="ygrps-yiv-478502099">Hi all!<br/>
   I just wanted to check and see if any of you <br/>
are un-schooling in NY? It looks like we may be <br/>
headed in that direction, and I&#39;d love to know <br/>
I&#39;m not alone!!<br/>
   I noticed a group near the Finger Lakes region, <br/>
but we&#39;ll be nearer Rochester...<br/>
   My monitor bit the dust, so I&#39;m having to join <br/>
you sporadically as I can get to the library:(<br/>
   Please feel free to e-mail me privately as I&#39;m <br/>
catching the discussions via digest version at the <br/>
library and don&#39;t have time to do much more than <br/>
skim right now...<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
