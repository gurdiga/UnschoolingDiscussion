<br/>
I know some will disagree, but I couldn&#39;t live with myself unless I<br/>
spoke<br/>
up: This was the Worst Movie Ever. It was so boring that Craig and I<br/>
fast<br/>
forwarded, trying to find anything slightly titillating.<br/>

Paula, I have to agree with you on this!  TERRIBLE movie!!!  My husband<br/>
and I actually watched the whole thing waiting for it to get better,<br/>
never happened.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that Stanley Kubrik&#39;s last movie was his worst - but he leaves<br/>
a legacy of some really good ones.</div>
