* Immediate action required: Help us Kill the Carnivore!<br/>
<br/>
On July 14 we issued a press release about an FBI cybersnooping<br/>
device code-named Carnivore, which can scan millions of e-mails<br/>
per second. Because Carnivore has unlimited power to spy on<br/>
almost everyone with an e-mail account, it may be the biggest<br/>
threat to your digital privacy ever.<br/>
<br/>
Almost immediately after the existence of this project was<br/>
disclosed in a July 11 Wall Street Journal article, public<br/>
outrage began to mount -- and now Congress has been pressured<br/>
into holding hearings on Carnivore.<br/>
<br/>
To capitalize on Monday&#39;s hearing before a House Judiciary<br/>
Committee panel, weÂ’ve launched a campaign to &quot;Kill the<br/>
Carnivore&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
Politicians on Capitol Hill may be planning to mollify the<br/>
public by starting an &quot;investigation&quot; into the system, but<br/>
that&#39;s not enough: We want to stop the Carnivore in its tracks<br/>
and kill it -- before it devours your privacy.<br/>
<br/>
Please read this e-mail and *IMMEDIATELY* take the action<br/>
below. Then forward this e-mail to friends, and ask them to do<br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
BACKGROUND: Carnivore is a hardware-software device that the<br/>
FBI secretly developed at its lab in Quantico, Va.  Dubbed<br/>
Carnivore because of its ability to find &quot;the meat&quot; among<br/>
millions of e-mails, Carnivore scans every incoming and<br/>
outgoing e-mail message on a network looking for telltale words<br/>
or names, and saves those messages for later retrieval by law<br/>
enforcement. Carnivore can also track instant messages, visits<br/>
to websites, and Internet relay chat sessions.<br/>
<br/>
The FBI admits that Carnivore will scan millions of e-mail<br/>
messages from innocent people to find a tiny number of messages<br/>
from people suspected of crimes.  That&#39;s no different than if<br/>
the FBI opened everyone&#39;s mail hoping to find a letter from a<br/>
criminal, or listened in on everyone&#39;s phone calls just in case<br/>
a crime was being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Though Carnivore&#39;s existence was just publicly revealed, the<br/>
FBI has already installed the device at dozens of Internet<br/>
Service Providers (ISPs) around the country, and claims it has<br/>
used it &quot;fewer than 50 times&quot; so far. In many cases, the FBI<br/>
keeps the device in a locked cage on the ISP&#39;s premises, with<br/>
agents making daily visits to retrieve the captured data.<br/>
<br/>
Many ISPs have refused to allow the FBI to install Carnivore,<br/>
citing concerns that the privacy of all their customers could<br/>
be violated. But earlier this year, a federal judge ruled<br/>
against one such ISP, leaving it no choice but to allow the FBI<br/>
access to its system.<br/>
<br/>
Predictably, the FBI promises to limit surveillance to messages<br/>
from suspected hackers, terrorists, or drug dealers. But<br/>
considering that this is the same agency that quietly inserted<br/>
&quot;roving telephone tap&quot; authority into federal law and illegally<br/>
turned over confidential personnel files to the Clinton White<br/>
House, you shouldn&#39;t be expected to trust it with your<br/>
confidential e-mails.<br/>
<br/>
But Carnivore is more than a threat to your ordinary e-mail<br/>
correspondence -- it also gives government bureaucrats the<br/>
ability to spy on your online banking transactions, because it<br/>
has the ability to monitor all digital communications. The<br/>
bottom line is that your privacy won&#39;t be protected as long as<br/>
Carnivore is on the loose.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, no legislation to eliminate Carnivore has been<br/>
proposed. However, with your help we can change that. Keep in<br/>
mind that we kicked off our campaign to kill the FDIC&#39;s &quot;Know<br/>
Your Customer&quot; bank spy scheme last year before any legislation<br/>
existed. But once we informed the public about this threat to<br/>
their financial privacy, they swung into action and demanded an<br/>
immediate end to the program. Americans flooded Capitol Hill<br/>
with over 300,000 angry e-mails and phone calls, and within<br/>
weeks, Know Your Customer was withdrawn.<br/>
<br/>
We believe that once Americans learn about Carnivore&#39;s<br/>
outrageous assault on their electronic privacy, they will<br/>
demand legislation to abolish it as well.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why we&#39;re asking you to join the &quot;Kill the Carnivore&quot;<br/>
campaign!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHAT TO DO:<br/>
<br/>
Call the Congressional switchboard, toll free, at<br/>
1-888-449-3511. If that number is busy try 202-225-3121 or<br/>
202-224-3121. Then ask to speak to the office of your<br/>
Congressional representative. The switchboard is open 24 hours,<br/>
and most House offices have voice mail, so please make the call<br/>
as soon as you get this message.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
WHAT TO SAY:<br/>
<br/>
(1) Identify yourself and let them know you are a voter in<br/>
their district. Leave your name, address, complete with ZIP<br/>
code, and phone number. Please be brief, especially if you are<br/>
leaving a message.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Let them know that you&#39;re calling in response to Monday&#39;s<br/>
hearing on the FBI&#39;s Carnivore e-mail spy scheme. (The hearing<br/>
is being held by the House Judiciary Committee&#39;s subcommittee<br/>
on the Constitution.) Tell them that Carnivore poses an<br/>
immediate threat to your e-mail privacy and that you want it<br/>
abolished. Specifically, ask your representative to personally<br/>
sponsor or co-sponsor legislation to abolish the FBI&#39;s<br/>
Carnivore program now! Insist that you do *not* want an<br/>
investigation, or Congressional hearings, or a &quot;blue ribbon&quot;<br/>
commission -- you want to Kill the Carnivore now!<br/>
<br/>
(3) Ask them to write you a letter spelling out their position<br/>
on Carnivore, and detailing what they intend to do.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing: Please forward this e-mail to friends, and ask<br/>
them to call their representative, too. Thank you for your help!</div>
