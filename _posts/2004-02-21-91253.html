<div id="ygrps-yiv-196958535">-=-What is the abuse of truth and rational thought that you are pointing<br/>
at? -=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-When homeschoolers have a kneejerk reaction and deny any whiff of<br/>
suggestion<br/>
of negatives, it doesn&#39;t create better balance.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Showing only the negative aspects of homeschooling isn&#39;t balance either.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;The media&quot; isn&#39;t doing anything. Individual writers and directors<br/>
and<br/>
actors might be adding their phrase or plot or tension-building glance,<br/>
but<br/>
there is no big committee meeting at &quot;the media&quot; headquarters planning<br/>
what their<br/>
joint presentation will be.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;The media&quot; as I think most people view it, is the collective grouping<br/>
of writers, directors and station directors who decide what is going to<br/>
be viewed by the public.  Newspaper writers and editors as well tend to<br/>
be viewed in the collective &quot;media&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
=-= &quot;Get thee behind me, satanic media, there are NO questionable<br/>
homeschoolers,&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t remember anyone saying that but you.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Anytime there is a call for homeschoolers to get up a collective head<br/>
of<br/>
defensive steam, I&#39;m going to stand on the side and remind people to be<br/>
honest<br/>
and not just succumb to mob mentality.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Abuse of the truth - mob mentality wasn&#39;t present in this discussion it<br/>
was a discussion on disliking the way the &quot;media&quot; (this show) portrayed<br/>
homeschooling.  Not a call to arms.<br/>

You&#39;re trying to teach me English.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to ask people to be fair-minded and honest on this list.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s immature to say &quot;Well THEY&#39;RE not playing fair so I don&#39;t have to <br/>
either.&quot;<br/>
I would like to say that if anyone else is false or extreme, we on this list <br/>
could still be open-minded and honest.<br/>

<br/>
You were talking about a TV show.  I was talking about the response of <br/>
homeschoolers in general to TV shows and media mentions in general.   You can find <br/>
exciteable responses to such things many places on the internet.  What I&#39;d like <br/>
to find on this particular list is input that will help other people <br/>
unschool.   Discussing things in balanced fashion can help that.  Complaining that <br/>
other people other places are not living up to the ideals unschoolers have is not <br/>
productive.  It&#39;s a given; lots of other people suck. &lt;g&gt;  Let us not suck <br/>
here.  <br/>
<br/>
Integrity involves the courage to rise above making decisions based on what <br/>
will earn the most applause or the most back-patting.   If we do what we&#39;re <br/>
doing and do it well, we will be doing something of great value, regardless of <br/>
&quot;the competition.&quot;  It could only be better for us to see the value in other <br/>
homeschoolers, other &quot;media,&quot; in schools, etc.  To point out their flaws in order <br/>
to feel better about not being them is not a step toward integrity.   If we <br/>
see them as worthy and STILL surpass them, then we&#39;re doing something we might <br/>
be proud of.<br/>
