<div id="ygrps-yiv-549279269"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I keep the favorites in a pile for her scrapbook - it&#39;s actually all in a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>drawer &gt;right now, as I haven&#39;t actually put anything in a scrapbook... but<br/>
the drawer is &gt;filling, so I&#39;ll have to do it soon.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Robin<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I keep a Rubbermaid tote in a closet (about 5 gal. size) for keepsakes for<br/>
my boys (one for each child.)  I put things in them periodically.  They<br/>
contain my children&#39;s baby books, some hospital polaroids which did not fit<br/>
well in the scrapbook, my toddlers first painting, a pair of tiny newborn<br/>
booties for each of them, and other special things.  I have lots of room<br/>
left for adding things over the years, and it takes many more types of<br/>
things than a scrapbook.  In fact, it holds their scrapbooks too.<br/>
