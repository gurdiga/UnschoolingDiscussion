It is really beautiful, though all of the resorts are down at the ocean.  There are a few B & B&#39;s up here and the Kula Lodge.  Other than that it&#39;s really quiet.  Of course if you want to visit the volcano (Haleakala) you are a lot closer.  It&#39;s definitely worth a visit some day!  Kristin<br/>
<br/>
My grandparents used to go to Maui every year and loved it.  Although I <br/>
would terribly miss the cold, what you describe doesn&#39;t sound half bad!  We <br/>
may have to plan a trip sometime!<br/>
<br/>
I have an internet friend in HI and she complains of the sand incessantly.  <br/>
The humidity, too, although we have more than our fair share in Texas.  Not <br/>
quite as bad in north Texas as sdown in Houston, but it&#39;s bad enough!<br/>
