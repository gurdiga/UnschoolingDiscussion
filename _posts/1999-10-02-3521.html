<div id="ygrps-yiv-1931842828">For those of us with problems being around our own parents, I would like to<br/>
recommend a wonderful book, The Dance of Anger.  Can&#39;t recall the author,<br/>
she also has a book The Dance of Intimacy (haven&#39;t read it yet).  I had The<br/>
Dance of Anger recommended on another hs list.  I checked it out of the<br/>
library and ended up keeping it an extra 2 weeks in order to read it again.<br/>
I will probably go buy a personal copy.  It really opened my eyes to how my<br/>
problems with my mother had really tainted my relationship with my children.<br/>
Even though I still haven&#39;t directly talked with my mother (haven&#39;t spoken<br/>
to her in 3 years and may still not) , I still have done a lot of internal<br/>
work on the relationship and understanding.  I can see a direct improvement<br/>
in my handling my relationships with my children.  Hubby & I were able to<br/>
discuss a lot of things about how we handle things in our marriage and<br/>
openly look at some areas that have been uncomfortable for us but off limits<br/>
for discussion.  I can&#39;t recommend this book enough.  It was truly a life<br/>
changing read for me.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Liz</div>
