My son buys the same sort of stuff -- Backstreet Boys, Dragon Ball Z, etc. We <br/>
talk about it as well. What I found encouraging about Helen&#39;s discussion with <br/>
her son is that it reminded me of discussions we have here, though my kids <br/>
are 12 and 8 and things can&#39;t get all that deep or graphic. But we have <br/>
touched lightly on pornography, and the fact that it is exploitation of <br/>
mostly women by billion dollar corporations run and fueled mostly by men. My <br/>
kids know that many of the women in it were sexually abused when they were <br/>
younger, and truly can&#39;t be happy being involved with it.<br/>
<br/>
I listen to (but don&#39;t enjoy) all the music they listen to. They buy their <br/>
own as well. The same goes for DVD&#39;s and videos and books.<br/>
