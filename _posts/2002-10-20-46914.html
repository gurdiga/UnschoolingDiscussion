&lt;&lt; I have a problem with a blanket &quot;honor your parents&quot; when some parents are <br/>
anything but honorable. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AH!<br/>

I&#39;m reading backwards and swirly, no doubt, but here is a clue in what Patti <br/>
wrote.<br/>
In order to be honored one needs to be honorable.  [honor + able]<br/>
If one is dishonorable (cannot be honored, or behave contrary to the ability <br/>
to be honored) then nobody can truly honor them.<br/>
