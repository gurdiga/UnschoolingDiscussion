I am not, and have never claimed to be an unschooling &quot;expert&quot;  I know very <br/>
little about unschooling.  Yes, i am interested in learning, but my learning <br/>
about the subject does not necessarily mean I will practice it.. And, if I do <br/>
choose to practice unschooling, I am sure it will be my own unique style and <br/>
approach.   Heck, the only thing I can say I am an expert at is raising MY <br/>
children.  I am a very unstructured, relaxed, easy going parent.  I know I <br/>
wont be in a strict schedule with lots of &quot;work&quot; and records.  If i wanted <br/>
that, I would keep my children in public school.   I do know this. No two <br/>
children are alike, no two parents are alike. no two situations are alike.  <br/>
No method or approach works the same with every child and/or parent.   <br/>
Because someone chooses a different path than me does not make me superior to <br/>
them, it only makes us different.  I do not feel threatened by others <br/>
choices.  I can respect and learn from others in all walks of life.  <br/>
Christians, Pagans,  Catholics, ( ANY religion actually) UNschoolers, <br/>
&quot;structured&quot; homeschoolers, familes of &quot;regular&quot; PS&#39;ers,  one is no better <br/>
than the other in my eyes.  Ultimately, we are all just parents trying to do <br/>
whats best for our children<br/>
