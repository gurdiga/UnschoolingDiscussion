 What I found most interesting (though not surprising) was that one or two<br/>
 people posted negative reviews, then a few others thanked them for warning<br/>
 them and said they&#39;d never read the books. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This just feeds into the whole willingness to not think garbage.<br/>
Just like when one of the Moms around here was passing out anti-pokemon <br/>
literature. I asked her if she&#39;d actually seen the one card that they were <br/>
saying &quot;was calling evil powers to itself&quot; (what? like HSLDA leaders? Evil <br/>
like that? snark, snark)<br/>
And she said no, but her pastor had told her about it.<br/>
Oh, so the pastor said so, it must be true. Period. That&#39;s all the thought <br/>
that goes into it.<br/>
One of the ladies there ended up throwing ALL of her kids pokemon stuff away, <br/>
the games, everything.<br/>
Now, a couple years later, she has bought them pokemon, yugio, games galore <br/>
AND is coming to our unschooling group events and asking questions.<br/>
So you never know.<br/>
She finally applied some thought to the whole thing and found it didn&#39;t add <br/>
up.<br/>

How did the kids interpret this, I wonder.<br/>

<br/>
Now I get excited when I see reviews by narrow minded people telling me not<br/>
to read something -- I just know it&#39;s going to be damn good and it makes me<br/>
want to read it all the more:)<br/>
We see a lot of the &quot;blindly following behavior&quot; here and we have to work<br/>
hard with our students (Arab women) to get them to question things and to<br/>
seek out their own answers to things. I&#39;m not sure how successful we are as<br/>
we only have 4 years compared to their having 18 years prior to that to<br/>
have things so ingrained!<br/>
