 </span></blockquote>I believe deeply in honesty, too, but I do think there are times when lies <br/>
are appropriate. I&#39;ve tried to teach my children to exercise good judgment <br/>
about such things, and to recognize that choosing to lie is a serious choice. <br/>
I don&#39;t make distinctions like white lies. A lie is the telling of an untruth <br/>
or the omission of the truth as a means of misleading someone. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are ways to get away from the gun without lying, and I would like <br/>
them to do that if possible, but sometimes kids don&#39;t let each other have an <br/>
easy out, and a gun in a kid&#39;s hands can be a matter of life and death. I <br/>
don&#39;t want them to get caught up in a debate over who&#39;s a chicken when <br/>
someone is twirling a lethal weapon around.<br/>
<br/>
If a rapist had just assaulted me and asked me if there were any other <br/>
females in the house, I wouldn&#39;t feel moved to reveal my daughter&#39;s presence. <br/>
It&#39;s an extreme example, but it&#39;s the kind I use with my kids because I don&#39;t <br/>
want them to think everyone and every situation is deserving of the truth. <br/>
We&#39;ve talked over lots of examples and discussed how you can be tactful <br/>
without lying when the situation warrants it, as well.<br/>

Actually we picked out the verbiage together.  As we role play she finds the <br/>
words that would help her to take the necessary action.  I leave most of it <br/>
to their discretion.  She knows she won&#39;t be in trouble and hopefully the <br/>
role playing and ethics discussion helps her to not waste valuable time.<br/>

Kids need this for those moments that take them off guard and require quick <br/>
action.  As much as I would like to think she&#39;ll never be faced with this <br/>
event, I know it can happen.  A good friend&#39;s daughter was shot and killed by <br/>
a friend while playing at their house after school, she was 13.  I cared for <br/>
her when she was little, perhaps it made the possibility of this kind of <br/>
event seem more plausible.<br/>

&lt;&lt; f a child is taught that there are times when lying is acceptable, the <br/>
 parents should not be surprised when the children then lie to the parents.  <br/>
 Moments of crisis and rare events will happen between teens and parents.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m willing to take that risk. I firmly believe I can help my child develop <br/>
the conscience and good judgment to know that is not the kind of lie to which <br/>
I am referring. There are distinct differences. But, no, I will not be <br/>
surprised to discover my <br/>
children aren&#39;t perfect. <br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t specifically teach them to lie to get away from guns, I do <br/>
teach them that if a lie is necessary to escape a clear and present danger, <br/>
so be it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281499539">Very good point. I liked the rapist example. <br/>
I guess what I emphasize to my kids is that we don&#39;t<br/>
lie to people we love, *especially* to people we love.<br/>
and sure, I teach them we try to love everyone, but<br/>
somehow sometimes there does come into play some<br/>
exceptions. Like you said, sometimes it is neccesary.<br/>
If homeschooling DID become illegal and someone<br/>
questioned them I would tell them to say they were in<br/>
school or something I&#39;m sure. Like someone said<br/>
earlier when talking about religion, if the kids are<br/>
asked about being christian or what not the answer<br/>
depends on who is asking. I don&#39;t consider that lying.<br/>
Nor do i consider not volunteering information (ex:<br/>
&quot;we don&#39;t go to school&quot;) when it isn&#39;t neccesary to be<br/>
lying. And I DEFINITELY don&#39;t consider it wrong when<br/>
trying to get out of doing something wrong. <br/>
I am not sure exactly how we explain those or what the<br/>
exact &quot;rules&quot; of when it&#39;s okay are, but we all seem<br/>
to be on the same wavelength about it. (my kids and me<br/>
I mean) hm. thanks for making me think about it more. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142747211">oh jeez, see, I can hardly take READING that whole<br/>
msg. I tried to make myself stop but to no avail. I<br/>
would like to do something (career wise, I mean, if I<br/>
were to have a career other than mom/teacher<br/>
person...hypothetically) that helped people and for<br/>
awhile when I was helping my dad with his insulin<br/>
every day and taking care of him after his stroke I<br/>
thought something in the way of the medical area would<br/>
be cool. It&#39;s fascinating. But I don&#39;t like doctors<br/>
(no offense to any doctors here) and I don&#39;t like<br/>
hearing things like that about children. And seeing<br/>
people die. A physical therapist would be cool maybe,<br/>
but still bring me to tears each day most likely, but<br/>
hopefully in a good, touching way. A midwife or a<br/>
doula I decided would be the best for someone like me<br/>
who can&#39;t stomach the death part of life, but prefers<br/>
the usually joyous part...being birth.<br/>
But someone has to have those hard to deal with jobs<br/>
and I&#39;m glad that there are people out there that can<br/>
stomach it. I can&#39;t believe you lasted 1 year, 2 weeks<br/>
and 3 dayz. You must be pretty strong and probably in<br/>
some small way even made a difference in some people&#39;s<br/>
lives. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-441689495">There are lots of &quot;good&quot; nursing jobs out there such as inhome support for<br/>
folks that go home after surgery or for premmies.  And a lot of the inhome<br/>
jobs for the elderly just insure that they don&#39;t end up institutionalized in<br/>
a convo &quot;factory.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The part that was worth the job that I had was knowing that at least in one<br/>
case we managed (at the risk of our own jobs) to keep one abuse case in the<br/>
hospital for 3 months.  I really feel it was the happiest 3 months of the<br/>
little guy&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
The really rough part is that you end up wanting to take them all home with<br/>
you %-{<br/>

<br/>
&gt; oh jeez, see, I can hardly take READING that whole<br/>
&gt; msg. I tried to make myself stop but to no avail. I<br/>
&gt; would like to do something (career wise, I mean, if I<br/>
&gt; were to have a career other than mom/teacher<br/>
&gt; person...hypothetically) that helped people and for<br/>
&gt; awhile when I was helping my dad with his insulin<br/>
&gt; every day and taking care of him after his stroke I<br/>
&gt; thought something in the way of the medical area would<br/>
&gt; be cool. It&#39;s fascinating. But I don&#39;t like doctors<br/>
&gt; (no offense to any doctors here) and I don&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; hearing things like that about children. And seeing<br/>
&gt; people die. A physical therapist would be cool maybe,<br/>
&gt; but still bring me to tears each day most likely, but<br/>
&gt; hopefully in a good, touching way. A midwife or a<br/>
&gt; doula I decided would be the best for someone like me<br/>
&gt; who can&#39;t stomach the death part of life, but prefers<br/>
&gt; the usually joyous part...being birth.<br/>
&gt; But someone has to have those hard to deal with jobs<br/>
&gt; and I&#39;m glad that there are people out there that can<br/>
&gt; stomach it. I can&#39;t believe you lasted 1 year, 2 weeks<br/>
&gt; and 3 dayz. You must be pretty strong and probably in<br/>
&gt; some small way even made a difference in some people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; lives.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I worked at a county hospital in the radiology<br/>

&gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t handle one more<br/>
&gt; &gt; child abuse case, it was too much!!!  We would get<br/>
&gt; &gt; all the kids in to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; full body scans if their was any question of prior<br/>
&gt; &gt; abuse.  It just drove me<br/>
&gt; &gt; crazy after awhile because the parents would come in<br/>
&gt; &gt; and give these really<br/>
&gt; &gt; lame excuses most of which included &quot;she/he fell<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; was it really hard emotionally, being a cop?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that may sound like a completely stupid question,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just curious. It&#39;s another diversity on this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; board.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think (no, I KNOW) I couldn&#39;t handle<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; emotionally being a cop or a nurse and other such<br/>
&gt; &gt; high<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stress jobs involving not being able to help as<br/>
&gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as I would want to (being ALL). I&#39;m too extreme I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guess. I would feel very fulfilled in the good I<br/>
&gt; &gt; did<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do, but I&#39;m interested in how you seperate it in<br/>
&gt; &gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mind and don&#39;t get depressed about all the things<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CAN&#39;T do, being only one person.<br/>
