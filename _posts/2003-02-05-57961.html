I feel for you.  We have been sick, one at a time and sometimes all four <br/>
together, for 10 days now.  It&#39;s exhausting.  You&#39;ll get through it.<br/>
<br/>
And both my kids watched PBS all day yesterday, when they weren&#39;t sleeping.  <br/>
The three of us spend the day in our bed, watching tv, sleeping, coughing, <br/>
shivering and doing lots of snuggling.<br/>
<br/>
Today the kids are slightly better.  They got dressed for the first time in <br/>
probably a week (except that sometimes my son would wear his sequined cape <br/>
over his pjs) and have gone up and down the stairs a couple of times.  <br/>
They&#39;re not interested in PBS today.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days ago someone mentioned being annoyed by Sagwa on PBS.  Can I <br/>
just say how annoying I find Arthur to be?  He&#39;s always in fear of being <br/>
shamed at school by his friends.  I was probably just easily annoyed, even <br/>
Sesame street was getting on my nerves.<br/>
