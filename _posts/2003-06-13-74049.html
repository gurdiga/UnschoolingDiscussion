<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688434382">K and I had a nice afternoon together.  We went to the park for an hour, and then we came home and had a snack.  Then we read books together ( two Usborne Young Puzzle books 2x each and one book about maps 2x) and then did some pretending with two frogs and a girl puppet and a pretend pond (a blue blanket).  Then the frogs and the girl needed a another snack.  Now she&#39;s watching TV with the frogs and the girl.  <br/>
