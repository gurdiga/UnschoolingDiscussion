<br/>
DH went through scouting up thru Eagle, and really wants our son involved in<br/>
it.  I not only have problems about their inclusivity, but also that it<br/>
looks a heckuva lot like school these days.  It used to be that cubs were<br/>
grades 2-4, webaloes 5, and boy scouts 6-12.  Now (at least here...), the<br/>
cub scouts meet together once a month, but for weekly meetings, it&#39;s tigers<br/>
in 1st grade, wolves in 2nd grade, bears in 3rd grade, etc.  Being not<br/>
overly fond of the school model, that doesn&#39;t thrill me.  Part of the appeal<br/>
of scouting when I was a girl scout was having the older girls help me do<br/>
stuff and looking forward to when *I* was one of the older girls.  Mixed age<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just hesitant to jump into a commitment, I guess.<br/>

It&#39;s more like Girl Scouts in the diversity department, except it&#39;s MORE <br/>
diverse, allowing boys and all.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
Not near as rigid as Boy Scouts.  Camp Fire kids get to design their own <br/>
vests, instead of sewing on the emblems in the exact same space as <br/>
everyone else.  And everything else is flexible, too.<br/>

And 4-H!!!  Don&#39;t forget 4-H. There are boys and girls together, the ages are <br/>
only split into three groups  3-8y.o./8-13 y.o. and 14 and up. <br/>
Any topic can be covered under the 4-H guidelines....from Marine <br/>
biology,knitting and cooking to sports, animal husbandry and more!! Any <br/>
interests the kids have can be used to earn 4-H awards and use their free <br/>
materials. Plus, if you keep a good record of their projects, it can earn <br/>
great scholarships should they be college bound.<br/>
My kids have done community service projects, hatched chicks and studied <br/>
turtles at the beach, all under the 4-H group.<br/>

AND Girl Scouts.  Tae Kwon Do, too!  Her mother won&#39;t say she&#39;s <br/>
unschooling, and documents all that stuff as education.  But she never <br/>
buys curricula, that&#39;s for sure.  No time!<br/>
