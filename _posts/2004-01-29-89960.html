<div id="ygrps-yiv-465687852">&quot;I asked my now 12yro a few years ago if he wanted to take a cooking <br/>
class and he said &quot;Can&#39;t we just stay home and cook?&quot;<br/>
Smart kid,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree.<br/>
I just think that most classes can be better done at home, and with less expense. Gymboree always seemed like such a waste to me when I thought about how much it would cost in a year and the kind of things we could buy with that money. Babies don&#39;t need to go play on equipment with other babies, they  need their families.<br/>
There are some things we can&#39;t do at home, gymnastics is one of them. The classes cost less than the equipment would, so it makes sense to seek a good class when the kids wanted that. But my kids have always been able to stop the classes if they wanted to, whenever they wanted. So they&#39;ve come and gone from gymnastics. Sierra wants to start back right now.<br/>
I look at the continuting education classes at the college from time to time, they have several choices for children too. Most of them sound great, but for the money we could just buy really cool materials and do it at home!<br/>
Trevor has been taking guitar for a year now and still loves it. Jared is looking into a martial arts class. But they are 10 and 14, the ages where an outside class might sound really appealing to a child. <br/>
I don&#39;t think classes are necessary, but they can enrich your life if you really want to be there.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like the child in this case doesn&#39;t really want to be there, it&#39;s more about the parents right now. Keeping their outside experiences positive and happy is far more important to me than what they learn about structure. A toddler does NOT need to learn structure, heck, I don&#39;t need structure (or do I? I can&#39;t seem to find my keys again). Some of us like to be &quot;system busters&quot; our whole lives. Isn&#39;t that ok?:)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And speaking as someone who has taught those &quot;enrichment&quot; type classes and<br/>
as someone who has a few kids who love them.....nothing sucks the fun out of<br/>
an activity faster for everyone than someone being forced to be there.<br/>
<br/>
My 13yo dd LOVES gymnastics.  She takes extra classes, helps her younger<br/>
sisters with their skills (has even been approached by the owner to possibly<br/>
work there).....but even she complains when somebody isn&#39;t enjoying the<br/>
class, is forced by a parent to &quot;finish out the year.&quot;  It changes the<br/>
entire energy involved.  Instead of gymnastics being an energizer, it<br/>
becomes a drain.  Yuck.<br/>

Like a swing set!!!  We still have the swing set Kirby got when he turned <br/>
three.  Some parts have been replaced, but Holly still plays on it.  Kids come <br/>
over and play on it. <br/>
<br/>
My guess is things like gymboree are for people who live in apartments in big <br/>
cities and the kids have no place big enough to roll, and not much to climb <br/>
on.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve had this same thought.  People will mention taking their kids to a class of some sort, and I&#39;ll think, we do that in our backyard, or our basement, or out in our shop, etc.  Why take a class?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll just count my blessings that we have a huge yard and lots and lots of things to do in our home with lots of space to do them in.  I&#39;m a huge lover of space.  No way I could live in a city, lol.  I know there are aspects to city life that we don&#39;t get in on, but for me, none of them are worth giving up my space for.  And we can always go visit the cities.  <br/>

things have a different flavor. My DH and 12yro took a beginning airbrush workshop, <br/>
it was a 4hr thing which they both enjoyed. At the end the lady who was in <br/>
the station next to my son thanked him for being there, told him that she had <br/>
enjoyed having him next to her. He was the only kid in the workshop, he did <br/>
fine. I like those kinds of things best, they are not dumbed down.<br/>

(Washington DC suburbs).  Two kids and a dog. <br/>

<br/>
My SIL and my brother spend any time at all with the<br/>
kids taking them to ballet, gymnastics, swim lessons,<br/>
soccer, brownies or piano lessons (the kids are 6 and<br/>
4).  But they are in school all day and then daycare<br/>
after school until 5pm.  Come home, do the homework<br/>
(yes, even the 4yo has homework of some sort), and<br/>
then off to brownies or ballet or swim lessons. <br/>
Weekends are full of activities too....classes on<br/>
saturdays and church activities on sundays.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, my SIL also works full time, teaches some<br/>
evenings, and does volunteer work.  My brother does<br/>
all the cooking and cleaning that is done at all.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help thinking when they start listing all<br/>
these wonderful &quot;enrichment&quot; activities, wow, why not<br/>
just stay home for the few minutes you can and spend<br/>
it together?<br/>

<br/>
This is the very reason that my DH and I started taking our DD to <br/>
gymboree to begin with.  We had also recently moved to a new city <br/>
(about 4 hours from our old home town) and didn&#39;t know very many <br/>
people and no one with kids.  We decided to enroll our DD in <br/>
gymboree to get her out of our small apartment, so that she could <br/>
meet other kids her own age, and so that I could me other mothers.  <br/>
She loved it and so did I.  I met many people that I am still <br/>
friends with and she has lots of little friends that she met in <br/>
gymboree.  The other mothers that I met there and I actually decided <br/>
to form our own mom&#39;s group outside of gymboree and most of us chose <br/>
not to continue with gymboree once we had started that group.  <br/>
<br/>
When we made yet another move to Vegas, my DH and I decided that <br/>
gymboree might be a way to meet other people again (both for myself <br/>
and our DD).  Unfortunately, it didn&#39;t work out that same way here.  <br/>
Once we realized that we weren&#39;t meeting the type of people we <br/>
wanted to meet (most of the people there were either grandparents or <br/>
click type people only there for the status), we decided to save the <br/>
money and dropped the class.  Looks like we won&#39;t be going back to <br/>
gymnastics again either.  However, with the gymnastics class, I <br/>
don&#39;t feel disappointed to be taking her out.  I simply feel like we <br/>
are doing the right thing in not continuing with that class.  I have <br/>
hooked up with a homeschooling group here in Vegas and will be <br/>
meeting with them once a week for an open gym at the local community <br/>
center.  I think that Karen (my DD) will like that much better.<br/>

<br/>
I think a lot of times Gymboree classes are for moms who need to get out of<br/>
the house with a little one and might not have many mom friends yet.  They<br/>
need the socialization!  When my oldest was a baby I joined a local La Leche<br/>
League spin-off play group.  It was MY play group, not his.  He was 6 months<br/>
old, he didn&#39;t even realize it was a playgroup.  But all of us moms decided<br/>
that once a month wasn&#39;t enough support, we needed weekly get-togethers at<br/>
least!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>tell me about it. i&#39;ve come to respect Aidan&#39;s appraisal of classes. <br/>
when he says he does not like it, he does not like. i had him a mommy & <br/>
me music class and he hated it. instead of asking for our money back, I <br/>
made him go. that&#39;s one of my deschooling knee-jerk reactions of last <br/>
year. he still wants to do music in a school because his brother goes <br/>
and takes guitar lessons with a very unschooly kind of teacher. well, <br/>
this time around i asked him several times, &quot;do you want to go&quot; and he <br/>
very clearly said: sometimes i do, sometimes i don&#39;t. i&#39;ll let you <br/>
know. he&#39;s not even for yet.<br/>
<br/>
with Evan, i had a more jerk than knee reaction the other day. i fought <br/>
with him because he did not want to follow his guitar homework <br/>
instructions the way the teacher had written them out. WTF was I <br/>
thinking! I literally had to leave the apartment and go to Barnes and <br/>
Noble. after i came back and apologized, i had a lengthy talk with mark.<br/>
<br/>
my jerk moment came from the meaning i was giving to his choices. he <br/>
wants to do this because he enjoys it not because he needs to prove <br/>
anything. i want him to prove to his teacher he is good. UGH! let me <br/>
tell you, i&#39;ve been feeling very yucky about this. a lot of it has to <br/>
do with having an extra load of stress and going to places emotional <br/>
places where it is very easy for me to go when i&#39;m feeling sorry for <br/>
myself.  still, i don&#39;t want to turn this into a bashing session on <br/>
myself either because i can go there so easily. it&#39;s been more like a <br/>
wake-up call. a jolt to get back into awareness.<br/>

I had the same type of situation with my son the other day (he is four years <br/>
old).  He told me that he wanted to learn the recorder, and so we sat down <br/>
for a &quot;lesson,&quot; with me taking the role of teacher, of course.  THAT was <br/>
brilliant.  It ended up with me being frustrated because my son just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t listen to my instructions, gosh darnit!  He wanted to do things his <br/>
own way!  I realized what an idiot I was being (he&#39;s FOUR), and I later <br/>
asked my son if and how he would like his future &quot;lessons&quot; to go.  He told <br/>
me plain and simple, &quot;Mama - I just want you to sit there and listen, and if <br/>
I have any questions, I&#39;ll ask YOU.&quot;  Nicely put...in other words, just shut <br/>
up Mom.  I am still learning and my son is patiently pointing out the error <br/>
of my ways.  I am so proud.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t feel too bad, as at least you saw that you were pressuring your son.  <br/>
My mother forced me to practice the violin every day for an hour for EIGHT <br/>
YEARS (with me obviously hating it).  Funny, I can&#39;t stand to play it now.<br/>
