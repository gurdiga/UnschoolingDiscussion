Not sure why you want to argue this with a business associate but.....<br/>
<br/>
The woman basically doesn&#39;t seem to understand that information that is<br/>
necessary for school children is also necessary for unschoolers.  If you are<br/>
going to paint a house, it doesn&#39;t matter your educational background, you<br/>
need to find out how much paint to buy.  The difference in the educational<br/>
background is likely to show in the school child thinking there is &quot;a&quot; way<br/>
to figure the area and the unschooler being able to figure it several ways.<br/>
When my kids and I talk about arithmetic concepts we talk about the formulas<br/>
as simply shortcuts somebody figured out.  They aren&#39;t magical unto<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
2yos learn to talk because they want to communicate effectively.  Kids learn<br/>
to spell because they want to communicate effectively.  Gee whiz, I have a<br/>
graduate degree and still use spell check because I tend to overuse doubling<br/>
of letters.<br/>
<br/>
This core of knowledge the woman talks about that all Americans need.  Has<br/>
she ever gone from one school district to another?  One state to another?<br/>
The kids learn different things.  When my kids don&#39;t get a reference in a<br/>
conversation or television show, they ask about it.  Shoot, I married a<br/>
yankee and his family doesn&#39;t use the colorful language and &quot;sayings&quot; my<br/>
family does.  Had to sit and explain them to him.  No big deal.  He also has<br/>
a graduate degree.<br/>

&gt; GROAAAAAN.....lol<br/>
&gt; Gotta say I agree with you Betsy.<br/>
&gt; Rewarding for behavior is manipulative and directive and not(if you <br/>
&gt; are bribing for math work to be done), IMO unschooling.<br/>

Until about two weeks ago, I would have disagreed with you.  I have since<br/>
been led to believe that there is a very strict definition of what is and<br/>
is not unschooling so using that as a basis, I guess I agree that this is<br/>
not unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959634706">&lt;&lt;Does this kind of questioning go on forever with other people?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In a word, yes.  We have gotten to where we only mention we homeschool in<br/>
response to direct questions about where the kids go to school and only<br/>
mention unschooling when not doing so would be lying.<br/>
<br/>
We also have a racially mixed family of 5 adopted children.  We get lots of<br/>
questions and to be honest, get tired of answering them.  My biracial 2yos<br/>
hair is out of control, wild ringlets that tangles terribly.  I suggested to<br/>
dh that we give her dreadlocks.  He said no because it was one more thing to<br/>
answer questions about, only half joking.<br/>
