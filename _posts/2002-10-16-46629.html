Saying that it&#39;s wrong to judge others is a judgement in and of itself, though.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny... I tend to speak my mind blatantly on message boards and mailing lists, but not so much in real life.  I&#39;m usually the one sticking up for people who are being judged by others, saying things like &quot;well until you&#39;ve walked a mile in their shoes...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I actually got into an argument for telling someone that they shouldn&#39;t be so quick to judge the mother who was in the news for punching her child in a store parking lot.  But I had to take my own advice because in my *mind* I was thinking &quot;she punched her child?!  How could she?&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126148249">My take on judging is highly influenced by _Non<br/>
Violent Communiction: A Langauge of Compassion_<br/>
(NVC)by Marshall Rosenberg. <br/>
<br/>
A tool in using NVC especially to understand what<br/>
triggers anger is to fully connect with the<br/>
judgemental thoughts that come up. Write all those<br/>
thoughts down then connect them with our feelings and<br/>
needs. Also strive to connect with the feelings and<br/>
needs of the other person whose actions has triggered<br/>
the judgmental thoughts. (I find this easier to do<br/>
after I have connected to my feelings and needs first<br/>
otherwise I am not present enough to &quot;hear&quot; their pain<br/>
or concerns) So I find my judgmental thoughts very<br/>
helpful. I strive to keep them to myself transalte<br/>
them to feelings and needs. I find if I stay in what I<br/>
call &quot;nice mode&quot; and stop my judgemental thougths<br/>
because the things I thought are bad or wrong I am<br/>
less likely to be able to connect to what my feelings<br/>
are. (Guess what I am doing I am judging my judgemtnal<br/>
thoughts ;) Then I am less likely to seek connection<br/>
with others.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested understanding more of NVC go to<br/>
cnvc.org. There is way more to NVC than I have<br/>
described here and read the book too.<br/>
