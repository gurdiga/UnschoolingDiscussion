<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244819030">I&#39;m used to being the one who&#39;s criticized.   Joyce&#39;s motivations and  <br/>
general goodness were questioned here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/sometimes-its-just-not-what-i">http://familyrun.ning.com/forum/topics/sometimes-its-just-not-what-i</a><br/>
and although the post didn&#39;t go through, someone complained that Pam  <br/>
was being bossy.<br/>
<br/>
The two of those together have given me a new facet of perspective on  <br/>
why people get cranky in unschooling discussions.  I could be wrong,  <br/>
or might have &quot;discovered&quot; something others of you have known a long  <br/>
time, but I think maybe people have their &quot;if/then&quot; expectations  <br/>
backwards.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IF someone wanted to unschool and IF Pam or Joyce or I (or fill in  <br/>
your own sample person) said &quot;you can if&quot; THEN that might be bossy, I  <br/>
suppose, in a way.<br/>
<br/>
In both those cases above, though, it wasn&#39;t &quot;if you want to unschool.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If was IF you want to be welcome in this discussion THEN you need to  <br/>
be talking about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If Pam is bossy (funny idea, because she&#39;s hardly ever anything *like*  <br/>
bossy), she&#39;s not telling people what they have to do or how they have  <br/>
to be at home with their kids.  She&#39;s talking about how people need to  <br/>
be in order for her to let their posts through to the list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m bossy in my house, it&#39;s because it&#39;s my house and I get to say  <br/>
whether people throw bottles or smoke cigarettes or set fire to paper  <br/>
napkins at the table.  I do!  It doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t break glass or  <br/>
set fire to your own table cloth with your own cigarettes at your own  <br/>
house; I don&#39;t care.  But IF someone asks online how to keep broken  <br/>
glass and the smell of smoke out of their house, I might make some  <br/>
recommendations. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not unschooling on this list.  We&#39;re discussing unschooling.<br/>
If someone wants to just play around with unschooling in her spare  <br/>
time, once in a while, that&#39;s not the topic of this list.<br/>
This list is for people who really do intend to discuss and consider  <br/>
unschooling in a serious, focussed manner.<br/>
