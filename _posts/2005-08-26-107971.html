Right.   The &quot;new&quot; technology before that was hand-carving each page in <br/>
reverse.   Those wooden printblocks didn&#39;t last very long at all.   Or they could <br/>
cast a page in lead.   Lead ones didn&#39;t either.   They couldn&#39;t make unlimited <br/>
print runs.   They couldn&#39;t even make LARGE printruns.   Each page was printed <br/>
and hung up or laid out to dry.<br/>
<br/>
Owning a book created by hand is not even nearly in the same category as <br/>
going and buying one of however-many-million copies of the new Harry Potter book.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to Keith last night about autographed books.   I don&#39;t like to <br/>
have them.&lt;g&gt;   Too much responsibility.   I had an autographed copy of Shane <br/>
and gave it away.   Of course I wish I hadn&#39;t.   But I&#39;m glad I did.   I gave <br/>
away an autographed copy of the first novel my friend wrote (she&#39;s written <br/>
several now) because it was about a period and incident I didn&#39;t care about; gave <br/>
it to an unschooler teen who WAS interested.   <br/>
<br/>
What I told Keith was that I like to think of books as the essence of them, <br/>
the information that&#39;s in them, not as their physical selves.     On the other <br/>
hand, I write in my books, and that makes that copy important to me (and <br/>
relatively less valuable to others, which is fine with me, because in my view of <br/>
&quot;that book&quot; I haven&#39;t harmed the book (the greater soul of that collection of <br/>
writings), just that COPY of the book.<br/>
<br/>
A hundred years ago, and even more 200 years ago, and VASTLY more 500 years <br/>
ago, that thought would have been nonsense.   A book was a very valuable thing. <br/>
  More than the new iMac I just got (which was also one of millions, and <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be expected to last me ten years).<br/>
<br/>
I was watching Sense and Sensibility yesterday.   Part of the subplot of the <br/>
movie (not of the essence of the novel, I think, which has existed since the <br/>
18th century in many copies and passed through MANY kinds of printing <br/>
processes) is that the youngest sister loves an atlas that was at their house, in the <br/>
library of the &quot;stately home&quot; (just an everyday large estate with dozens of <br/>
servants, in those days—not a government-subsidized museum).    An older <br/>
half-brother inherits the house.   The house includes the library.   The atlas belongs <br/>
to the owner of the house, whoever that might be.<br/>
<br/>
Before that there was such a thing as &quot;bound libraries&quot;:   books were chained <br/>
to the tables.   Y&#39;know bookstands, angled bookstands?   There were big ones, <br/>
with benches in front of them.   Books LIVED there--not ten years, like an <br/>
i-Mac.   Hundreds of   years, in universities.   Universities existed because <br/>
books lived in certain places.   They weren&#39;t carried around in backpacks or the <br/>
back windows of cars.   They weren&#39;t carried around anywhere.   They were <br/>
transported in wooden trunks to the place where they would live from then on.    <br/>
<br/>
To this day, in English universities, someone will say &quot;I&#39;m reading in <br/>
history&quot; (whereas Americans say &quot;I&#39;m majoring in history&quot;).   They go to the <br/>
university to read (at least linguistically), still.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  The knowledge was in the books.  It is kind of a weird shift <br/>
from the older idea of knowledge being in people&#39;s heads, or <br/>
discoverable in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Without books, I bet we&#39;d respect older people more in our culture.<br/>

engraver, was able to print text and picture this way (so all the text <br/>

<br/>
Books as ju-ju.<br/>
Some of the medieval monks were making ju-ju books, BIGtime.   Even now, the <br/>
dedication of a book creates ju-ju.   A book is personified, embued with the <br/>
soul of a person.   And that meant a LOT more when there weren&#39;t going to be <br/>
six million copies the first day.   (I still am not over the stats on the new <br/>
Harry Potter book, which I got on the first day and took a week to read.)   <br/>
Quite common in the Renaissance was dedicating a book to a king or some other <br/>
royal patron.   Still common into the early 20th century.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959866784">I find some of the best things when looking for something else.<br/>
<br/>
Found this quote:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
“Wherever two people live together in this kind of comradeship, giving and <br/>
receiving mutual help, there real education is in progress. The place of books <br/>
is, therefore, secondary. This idea troubles many people, who think that if the <br/>
place assigned to books is reduced the students will be deprived of the most <br/>
valuable tools of knowledge. Books do have a place as tools of knowledge, but <br/>
it is a very minor place. The major need is for teacher and student to become <br/>
work-partners, and this can happen only when the distinction between the <br/>
teacher &#39;teaching&#39; and the student &#39;learning&#39; can be overcome.” - Vinoba Bhave, an <br/>
educational philosopher born in the Indian state of Maharashtra in 1895, <br/>
identified by Ghandi as his spiritual successor.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Very well organized set of info!    <br/>
<br/>
There was another quote by the same guy about Indian languages not having the <br/>
same problem English has about teacher/student, because they don&#39;t have our <br/>
idea of &quot;teach.&quot;   <br/>
