<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958174499">***We read every night for at least an hour (we&#39;ve only missed a few and<br/>
I<br/>
                      feel guilty for that!) since our first was new<br/>
born.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I should probably say that we read for an hour every night because it is<br/>
asked for and enjoyable and what we do instead of tv at night, not<br/>
because we require it.<br/>
<br/>
I feel guilty about missing some of those readings because I really like<br/>
them, it allows me lots of cuddling time and closeness with my kids.<br/>
Also because the nights that we did miss were because we were either on<br/>
a road trip, or at a friends house late and by the time we got home the<br/>
kids would be asleep but still wake up just enough to ask for books (we<br/>
sit on their beds and read until they drift back to sleep).<br/>
<br/>
Hope I cleared that up before there were questions about it.<br/>
