<div id="ygrps-yiv-95858089">My Australia-residing aunt-in-law loves to receive Amazon.com gift <br/>
certificates in US dollars because she gets much better deals that way.  I think they <br/>
ship from Australian warehouses, so postage isn&#39;t a big deal.  Maybe someone <br/>
could buy you gift certificates and mail those for less than a buck.  I also <br/>
think it&#39;s pretty easy to deposit a check from a foreign bank - so you could pay <br/>
this buyer back - if it&#39;s made out in US dollars, but I&#39;m not positive about <br/>
that.<br/>
