I think most of us understood your concern with &quot;being aware of what is going <br/>
on in school&quot;   I know I certainly didnt interpret that as you being involved <br/>
or worried about what your PS system does.  You already clarified what you <br/>
said, I don&#39;t know why others keep insisting that &quot;being aware&quot;   means <br/>
anything more than just that.. an awareness.     Don&#39;t discount your concerns <br/>
or feel like you have to defend them.  They are real and we all have to find <br/>
ways to deal with them.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873094792">Hi Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. I think this discussion has included so many people, and has had <br/>
a few different directions. I do agree with the ones who said that in <br/>
dealing with state regs, the key is to unschool, and find a way to <br/>
comply without compromising how you unschool. That&#39;s good, imho. ( btw, <br/>
I was two days behind on email, and prob should have read all of it <br/>
instead of responding as I went. :-)  I guess I get a little impatient, <br/>
or invovled and want to jump in.)<br/>
<br/>
The part about whether or not it compromises unschooling to even be <br/>
aware of the schools -- that means different things to different people, <br/>
apparantly. Some took that to mean knowing exactly what was actually <br/>
being taught, scope and sequence and all that. To me, it&#39;s more of an <br/>
interest in the culture of schools, and how it affects the people caught <br/>
up in it. I look at homeschoolers, esp. unschoolers, and think how great <br/>
it is. Then I look at public schools, and think, there must be a better <br/>
way. But while we can, one family at a time, step away from the schools, <br/>
how does an entire culture step away? What about all those kids there? <br/>
But then, I guess my interest in, concern for, the schools and who&#39;s in <br/>
them really isn&#39;t part of unschooling. The other side is, my kids bump <br/>
into ps kids all the time, so we do bump into the ps culture, in a way. <br/>
My kids ask lots of questions, and notice the difference in how kids <br/>
interact.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this discussion, is it was actually a couple of <br/>
different discussions under one header. I wasn&#39;t trying to defend my <br/>
concerns, actually. I like to feel like I was clear, and if someone <br/>
didn&#39;t get what I said, I look at it to see if I could have explained <br/>
myself more clearly. Also, I was sort of enjoying this discussion, <br/>
because it brought out a lot of different viewpoints, and I do think the <br/>
point (Sandra, I think?) about not compromising what you&#39;re doing to fit <br/>
state regs is very important. Also, if you can&#39;t unschool in your state, <br/>
then what? A few times I saw moving suggested. I do think this is an <br/>
important issue --- why should someone in a country supposedly about <br/>
freedom and the individual have to move? There is something seriously <br/>
wrong if the government is telling us how to raise our children, and <br/>
even if we don&#39;t live in that state, I do think it is everyone&#39;s <br/>
concern. Another state could look at that and think it&#39;s a good idea, or <br/>
no one objects, or any other excuse to further curb our freedoms.<br/>
<br/>
sorry, rambling again. :-)<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the note,<br/>
peace,<br/>
