<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757218685">Hello Everyone<br/>
   First I would like to say that I have not found a great feeling of <br/>
support from the group that I belong to, but I haven&#39;t found one that <br/>
are not christian yet, so I make due. They do offer things to our <br/>
family that would be hard to find (class and different play groups <br/>
ect.) Although once they find out that we don&#39;t go to church two <br/>
things happen. First we are hounded to go, and when that dosen&#39;t work <br/>
we get the silent treatment (nice people). I have NO problem with <br/>
church OR people who go but, I have found through the years that they <br/>
are the one&#39;s who have the problem with me not going.O WELL!<br/>
 Second My oldest son was given the game perfection for his birthday. <br/>
I have never seen a game that makes him so nuts he can&#39;t see the <br/>
pieces for the timer, and then he just starts to cry. When he went to <br/>
kindergarden this was a big problem for his Timed tests or doing <br/>
thing by the clock you could just see him fall apart. We have put the <br/>
game away for now. But it still worries me. He has a uncle that is <br/>
the some way he can not see the putting green on the golf course for <br/>
the water in front and of corce there goes his ball. I know there is <br/>
nothing to do for him he needs to work this out for himself. but I <br/>
needed to get this of my chest.<br/>
 Thanks for listening Libby</div>

That&#39;s not so. <br/>
<br/>
You can help him with the game and keep it put up between times so when he IS <br/>
old enough to use it on his own he still has the parts.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can&#39;t easily just learn to get over frustration.  They need help, and <br/>
distraction, and love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055018549">Hi We do still have the game and I have asked him<br/>
every now and then if he wants to play and he says<br/>
when I&#39;m older. I did try to help him play when we<br/>
first got the game and he would  get mad and say he<br/>
can do it. I didn&#39;t want to make the situation any<br/>
more stressful so I backed off. He&#39;s very independent.<br/>
