<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125174289">We have annual results tables for all schools who submit their SATs results.<br/>
There is testing at 11, and 14 years old, along with the national<br/>
qualifications, GCSE at 16 and &#39;A&#39; Level at 18.  The recent addition to this<br/>
list is &#39;Baseline Assessment&#39; for entrants to Reception (Kindy?  or<br/>
Pre-Kindy?) in order to &#39;measure&#39; the effectiveness of the school.  People<br/>
are actually cramming their children for the Baseline Assessment!  And<br/>
teachers could be marking pupils lower so that when the later test results<br/>
come out, they look to have made big improvements.  There are also tables of<br/>
the results of the national inspections, which make more sense, as they give<br/>
a better overall picture of the school.  But there again, when OFSTED react<br/>
like they do to Summerhill, I wouldn&#39;t put much store in their opinion<br/>
anymore.<br/>

Anyhoo, I hope this shed some light!  Where in England is your sister?<br/>
