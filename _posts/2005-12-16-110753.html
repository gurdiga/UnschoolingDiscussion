<div id="ygrps-yiv-605879167">Hi<br/>
   is LeapPad quantum a system for kids older than 7? Over here we <br/>
have LeapPad but it&#39;s mostly for under 7&#39;s (kids start school here at <br/>
ages 4-5). My dd had LeapPad and enjoyed it but she&#39;s outgrown it as <br/>
she can read now. I can&#39;t find any reference to leappad quantum here, <br/>
not even on amazon.co.uk. Any clues?<br/>
