&lt;&lt; On the other hand, my brother&#39;s first wife was unschooled and she couldn&#39;t <br/>
read until she was 14.  Her mother didn&#39;t do anything to try to make their <br/>
lives interesting (like trips to libraries or museums or whatever.)  5 of her <br/>
kids had no problem this way but my sis in law did.  So I worry about the <br/>
what ifs...and what I would do then. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well... you wouldn&#39;t live without libraries, museums or whatever!  A <br/>
non-reader can espcially use the input of visual, aural, and other <br/>
sense-sparking methods of input.<br/>
<br/>
Just not reading until she&#39;s 14 isn&#39;t a damnation of unschooling.  Maybe in <br/>
school she wouldn&#39;t have either.  But in school she wouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
learning other things in the meantime, just learning that she was &quot;special <br/>
ed&quot; and severely learning disabled.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh thank you for that article.  I worry more about reading than anything <br/>
else...math, science, history ect don&#39;t worry me at all...but I adore reading <br/>
and want my children to have that joy too.<br/>

That article was reassuring and so were the posts about late reading not <br/>
necessarily being a bad thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I felt the same way.  I love reading.  My son *loved* being read to, and I <br/>
read to him for hours and hours and hours over the years.  I assumed that <br/>
when he could read for himself that he would continue with his love of <br/>
books.  It hasn&#39;t happened.  It might be partly because I panicked and <br/>
started pushing phonics on him when he wasn&#39;t reading at 12.  Or it might <br/>
be that it&#39;s just his nature to not enjoy reading even though he can now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of my favourite articles in the old GWS was one about a family that <br/>
only had (at that time) one child reading.  The kids went bird-watching, <br/>
and the younger ones would figure out from the pictures which bird they <br/>
were looking at.  Then they would take the book to their sister to have her <br/>
read the details.  The non-readers remembered all those details.  The <br/>
reader didn&#39;t.  Non-readers tend to develop skills that readers don&#39;t.  So <br/>
later reading can actually be a *good* thing.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know that years ago Retromom on AOL said her son had eye tracking<br/>
problems. It wasn&#39;t something that an ordinary eye doctor could detect but<br/>
something that a specialist was needed for. I don&#39;t really know anything<br/>
more about it.<br/>
<br/>
5 years ago I would have said 12 would be a time to have that checked out<br/>
but since my 11 yo is still working on reading I have a lot more confidence<br/>
that it progresses in its own time. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d throw that in to keep for whenever it might be useful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read about that before, but I think the only place we could get <br/>
testing for it is in Vancouver, an expensive ferry ride away.  It&#39;s still <br/>
something I&#39;m considering.  He says he wants to do &quot;more schoolwork&quot; this <br/>
year.  *If* he actually does, and it seems to be getting in his way, we&#39;ll <br/>
make the trek.  A couple of years ago I had him tested for Irlen&#39;s <br/>
Syndrome.  He had it, and we got the right colour of plastic overlays to <br/>
help him compensate for it.  He didn&#39;t end up finding it helpful enough to <br/>
actually keep using them<br/>

3 or 4 girls who all turned out to be dyslexic.  The mother apparently felt <br/>
guilty for not discovering it until the oldest was 14.  That was what put <br/>
me into a panic, and now I wish I&#39;d never heard about it.  &lt;g&gt;  I became <br/>
convinced that I had to do *something*.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269211500">my fourth son is 10 1/2.  Over the last few months he has finally started<br/>
reading.  I don&#39;t know what changed.  When he was 7 and 8 he really didn&#39;t<br/>
even recognize most of the alphabet.  We wanted to have him tested, he was<br/>
beginning to be unhappy and doubting if he would ever learn to read.  Then<br/>
we discovered that our insurance didn&#39;t pay for testing and it would cost<br/>
way more than we could pay.  If we had gone through the school system i was<br/>
concerned about them freaking out about a 9 year old that couldn&#39;t read at<br/>
all.  So, we didn&#39;t do anything but eventually something clicked and he is<br/>
slowly getting this reading thing.  We thought that my oldest son was a<br/>
late reader when he didn&#39;t start reading until just before his 9th<br/>
birthday.  The middle 2 boys both started reading at 7 1/2, late for some<br/>
people but seemed early to us:)  My daughter is going on 6 and she knows a<br/>
lot of the letters but is no where near reading yet.  i still wonder if my<br/>
10 year old has some type of learning disability but we are relieved that<br/>
if there is something there at least it is no longer preventing him from<br/>
learning to read.<br/>
By the way, my oldest is now 16 1/2 and an avid reader.<br/>
