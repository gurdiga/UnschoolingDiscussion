<div id="ygrps-yiv-91665337"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I think if a parent finds that they are reminding a child to do something<br/>
 </span></blockquote>too much, it might not be that important to the child. Its become the<br/>
parent&#39;s agenda and not the child&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It could mean that - or it could mean that the child doesn&#39;t have much of a<br/>
sense of time, or is extremely forgetful.  I have one of those &lt;grin&gt; (who<br/>
said that it is okay to use this example).  My 15 yo has been fascinated<br/>
with insects for the last decade.  He volunteers at the Arthropod zoo at a<br/>
science museum.  I have to remind him every other week to send the director<br/>
an e-mail arranging a time.  Now - this is his thing, not mine.  It&#39;s a 2<br/>
hour round trip, and I have to find things to do with the other two children<br/>
in the area while he&#39;s volunteering (the other people at the musuem are<br/>
getting to know us *really* well &lt;grin&gt;).  Quite frankly, it would be much<br/>
easier for me to not remind him.<br/>
<br/>
DH is also extremely absent-minded, and I used to think the same thing  -<br/>
that if he really cared about something, he&#39;d remember.  And he&#39;d forget,<br/>
and I&#39;d think he didn&#39;t care.  Having an oldest child who was also<br/>
absent-minded was one of the best things for that part of our marriage.  It<br/>
made us both realize that dh&#39;sabsent-mindedness wasn&#39;t something voluntary -<br/>
it was just part of him.  And I relaxed about it.<br/>
<br/>
So, I end up remembering many things for both of them - from volunteering to<br/>
my mother-in-law&#39;s birthday.<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter is exactly the opposite - she&#39;s right on top of everything,<br/>
always ready early, and gets upset if there&#39;s any possiblity of being late.<br/>
She doesn&#39;t want to be reminded abouth things (both dh and ds said that they<br/>
do), and neither do I - because I&#39;ve been thinking for the last 3 days that<br/>
I have to do whatever it is, and trying to fit it in.  Usually by the time<br/>
dh reminds me of something, it&#39;s been done for a week &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Dd and I are both trying to learn how to relax a bit &lt;BWG&gt;.<br/>
