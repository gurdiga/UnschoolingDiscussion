<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930606438">Sorry ~ I pushed the wrong button, first email......lol.<br/>
<br/>
This is such a liberal group, and I just finished this incredible <br/>
book.....The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown, has anyone read it??  I&#39;m dieing to talk about <br/>
it, but if I were to even SUGGEST some of the things in this book to anyone in <br/>
my local homeschool group, I&#39;d be burned at the stake.....lol<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it amazing, we decided to homeschool our children, so that we may think <br/>
out of the box, and have children who think out of the box, but so many of <br/>
the homeschoolers are stuck in the same box, they left at school???  Unschool is <br/>
magical, I cannot believe what progress the boys have made since I got off <br/>
their backs.  Anyway ~ I&#39;m still grateful for this group :)<br/>
<br/>
Have a good day ~ Michelle<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776725603">I just looked up The Da Vinci Code on our library website. It looked good,<br/>
so I put it on reserve.  It must be pretty popular because I&#39;m number 866 on<br/>
the reserve list!<br/>
<br/>
While we&#39;re recommending  books, I have one that I just read that I thought<br/>
was fabulous.  It&#39;s caled   _The Speed of Dark_ by Elizabeth Moon.  It&#39;s<br/>
about a man in the future that&#39;s high-functioning autustic.  They develop a<br/>
experimental &quot;cure&quot; for autism and he has to decide if he wants to stay the<br/>
way he is, or change himself to be &quot;normal&quot;.  One of the things I liked most<br/>
about the book was getting into his mind and how it works.  The author&#39;s son<br/>
is autistic, so I think it&#39;s probably a good representation of autism, at<br/>
least as good as it can be by an outside source.  The book gave me some new<br/>
insights into certain behaviors my &quot;out of sync&quot; child exhibits.  I think a<br/>
few friends of mine are going to have a discussion of the book.  I can&#39;t<br/>
wait.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439652411">read it, loved it.<br/>
have also read the Margaret Starbird books - if you loved Da Vinci Code, <br/>
read The Woman with the Alabaster Jar and The Goddess in the Gospels. <br/>
Margaret also has a discussion list - very cool stuff.  Her books are <br/>
mentioned in Da Vinci Code.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be glad to chat.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the link to Margaret&#39;s website:<br/>
