&lt;&lt; May I ask what the Peaceful parenting tape is?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Richard Prystowsky and I did a joint presentation at the HSC conference in <br/>
Sacramento last fall, called Peaceful Parenting.  I have cassette tapes for <br/>
$7 or $6 in person at the August conference in South Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
We have another joint presentation on tape called &quot;To Question or Not to <br/>
Question: That is the Question,&quot; about how crucial a family&#39;s attitude toward <br/>
questions is to unschooling.<br/>
