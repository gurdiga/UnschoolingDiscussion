<div><font size="2">Dear Susan, and others who so graciously responded to my plea 
for advice, I appreciate your concern and time, and wonderful advice!!&nbsp; We 
are N of Seattle, Wa.&nbsp; Spring has Sprung....and we had a chance to visit 
another family that home/unschools a couple days ago , and this really did the 
trick&nbsp; I think he just thought perhaps we were the only ones or something, 
and he was missing out on something&nbsp; .&nbsp; He was happy to know other 
happy kids were doing the same thing and loving it.&nbsp; We talked quite a bit, 
and he&#39;s decided he likes the freedom he has..we took the advice of pretend 
public school, and although he was exceptionally well behaved, raising his hand 
to speak...he soon became figidy, and restless, and wanted to get back to real 
life.&nbsp; It was much nicer to sit on the floor and choose his own book, which 
was a map book, and read it , and ask questions, and learn, than to wait to be 
asked, and called upon.&nbsp; I picked up alot of great ideas from the lady I 
went to see, as well..the whole set up...making all sorts of things 
accesible...I think that&#39;s a great new tool for us....a play, learn, fun 
space.....his room is fun, but I will be adding more resources, and taking all 
the craft supplies, and such out of the closet, and putting them out where he 
can always get to them, he does have his seperate supplies, but hey..let&#39;s givem 
the whole shabang....&nbsp; We heard of a cyber school, near by that does extra 
classes for homeschoolers...such as languages..they offer homeschoolers funding 
for supplies..something like 600$&nbsp; a year..I don;t know anything about it 
yet, but I&#39;ll find out in about a week..I&#39;d like to check it out, and let hime 
take one class per week if he wants to.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is full of energy...loves 
to read, and be read to, and loves to play make-believe..his imagination is 
spectacular.....this is all a wonderful adventure for us..the whole 
family....Thanks for the advice, and Many Blessings!&nbsp;
