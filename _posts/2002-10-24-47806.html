<div id="ygrps-yiv-112892637">Whoever it was asking about iguanas as pets with kids, do some research <br/>
before you decide. Iguanas are not simple to keep where you just stick them <br/>
in a tank and feed them lettuce. And yes some people do this. Contrary to <br/>
popular belief, if well kept and healthy, they get very large in spite of <br/>
where they are kept. They should also not be kept in an aquarium unless it&#39;s <br/>
like a 50 gal one. They need room. And they can get to be 6 feet. And they <br/>
also shouldn&#39;t be fed lettuce, at least not a lot.<br/>
<br/>
They do carry salmonella and one never knows if they have it or not. They <br/>
can shed the bacteria and so can have it and not at different times. That&#39;s <br/>
why one should always consider they do have it. It&#39;s shed in their feces <br/>
from their stomach. They can get minute amounts (of feces) on their <br/>
enclosure or even on them and then you handle them and maybe touch your <br/>
mouth and that&#39;s how you get it. It&#39;s like a food poisoning thing where you <br/>
get pretty sick but it goes away. In infants and older or health compromised <br/>
people, it will cause more harm. After handling, hands should always be <br/>
washed.<br/>
<br/>
Great pets for people who like them and are ready to take the time to care <br/>
for them properly and have the room for them as they grow.<br/>
