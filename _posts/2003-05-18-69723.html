<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256193828">I know most of you already know, however alot of people have <br/>
*complained* that they have 100&#39;s of emails backed up.  I have mail <br/>
sent in daily digests which are a few emails a day.  It is pretty <br/>
quick to scroll through it and just as easy to skip topics you are <br/>
not interested in.  If comething interests me and I want to respond I <br/>
just make a mental note of the time and go back and look it up <br/>
later.  Also, it is much easier to erase 3-4 emails if you are <br/>
overwhelmed than to sift through your whole box!  Anyway, I hope this <br/>
helps anyone who did not know they had the option :)<br/>
