<div id="ygrps-yiv-281586047">If you&#39;re in Idaho, you&#39;re not too far from me, maybe, in Montana.<br/>
<br/>
There is a small, loose, radical group of Montana unschoolers and we are<br/>
currently planning, rather chaotically, a summer get together.   You&#39;d be<br/>
welcome to join us.<br/>
<br/>
There is a Montana unschooling list although only about nine of the<br/>
thirty something people are regular posters, and only about four or five<br/>
of those are unschoolers.   It started well, really it did, it just<br/>
morphed to include more eclectic homeschooler who didn&#39;t fit into the<br/>
other VERY religious list.   <br/>
<br/>
Dana is the list owner.  Are you here Dana?  She&#39;s a rabid unschooler.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m in Deer Lodge, our little camping deal may be in September,<br/>
we&#39;re still working on it, and should be in western MT somewhere.   Is<br/>
that clear? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
