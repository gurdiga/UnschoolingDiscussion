Partly  chatter from friends about how he would amount to nothing <br/>
by   dropping out of school. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
grrr.<br/>
 <br/>
Will crawled into bed with me the other night.  He likes to talk to me  late <br/>
at night and tell me secrets.  He was telling me about playing on  Sunday with <br/>
kids around the corner, whom we know from baseball.  I was at  work on <br/>
Sunday, so he had a day to think about it.  Their mother is a  teacher.  Will didn&#39;t <br/>
know that Monday was MLK day, because it just hadn&#39;t  come up, yet, although <br/>
he&#39;s known about it in other years.  Kyle, who is 6,  said that the reason <br/>
Will didn&#39;t know that was because he doesn&#39;t go to  school.  <br/>
 <br/>
Will was sooo kind about it.  He prefaced the story by saying he KNEW  Kyle <br/>
was only 6.  But it stung him, and he didn&#39;t have an answer,  really.  <br/>
 <br/>
Then Will told me about something that happened with Payton during baseball  <br/>
season.  Will asked him &quot;What&#39;s today?&quot;  (a question I ask myself and  others <br/>
several times every day) and Payton said, &quot;you don&#39;t know that because  you <br/>
don&#39;t go to school!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Will told me he knows those kids don&#39;t know any better, because they go to  <br/>
school.  &lt;BEG&gt;  But he said it still hurts him.  I reminded  him that he&#39;d been <br/>
to the Lorraine Motel where MLK was assassinated and he saw  the lady who <br/>
lives on the street in front of it because they took her home when  they made it <br/>
a museum, and that he knew more real things about MLK from being  born and <br/>
raised in Memphis than Kyle would every hope to know.  And that  he&#39;s even sat on <br/>
Dad&#39;s shoulders during the MLK parade on Front Street.   Kyle thinks it&#39;s <br/>
important because he gets a day off from school--how  much can he really know <br/>
when there aren&#39;t even any black children in his  classroom?  <br/>
 <br/>
Will is so gentle and non-aggressive.  Both of these kids are in  highly <br/>
competitive families, and nothing but winning in all ways is ever good  enough.  <br/>
 <br/>
It doesn&#39;t help Will to have that information in the moment, though.   I have <br/>
hesitated for years to show him how to interact with people who  have <br/>
conventional ideas about school.  I didn&#39;t want to poison him,  you know?  And it <br/>
hadn&#39;t really been an issue until now.  He fully  believes that school is not <br/>
necessary, but I think I&#39;ve hindered him by not  giving him tools to interact <br/>
with that mindset.  Finally I have told him to  make things up, which is what it <br/>
amounts to, in his mind.  Kyle said  something about Will having no school, <br/>
and I encouraged Will to just say that  his home is his school.  That for these <br/>
people, in this area, he&#39;s  going to have to speak language that people <br/>
understand.  Lie, obfuscate,  obscure the beautiful truth of his life, so he can <br/>
avoid the slings and  arrows.  <br/>
 <br/>
Either that or become more aggressive and competitive and be a one-upper  and <br/>
nanny-nanny boo-boo over how much he knows about MLK.  I don&#39;t want  that.  I <br/>
want the gentle Will who would rather have fun and play than argue  over who <br/>
is smarter. Who makes concessions for being 6.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I think this misinformation is coming from the parents, and I  <br/>
briefly considered writing a letter to the editor about it.  It would have  an <br/>
impact in this small town.  But nah, I&#39;ll just help Will, instead.<br/>

Yes, when you don&#39;t have to be caged up in the school box every day, a <br/>
day of play and freedom is just another day! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I often am unaware of the date, because I&#39;m not filling out lots of <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177936437">I&#39;m assuming that Payton said this in a derogatory way? Nick has a<br/>
friend (?) that says stuff like this when he&#39;s envious. Like he&#39;ll say<br/>
&quot;Well, you don&#39;t *have* to do anything.&quot; But he says it in a way that<br/>
makes Nick feel like he *should* be doing something when what his<br/>
friend really means is &quot;I *have* to do things [like schoolwork] and I<br/>
wish I didn&#39;t...&quot; Or he&#39;s jealous of how many games Nick has and he&#39;ll<br/>
say things like &quot;Well, you have all these games but you never finish<br/>
them.&quot; Like that&#39;s wrong or something... What he really means is that<br/>
he wishes he had that many games...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it would help to tell Will this or not, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
really seem to help Nick but maybe it does help to counter balance<br/>
it...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933739872">Maybe the aikido way to deal with such little attacks is to ask a question <br/>
back until the child shows he doesn&#39;t really know what MLK day&#39;s about either.<br/>
<br/>
Holly told me a story one of the girls at the conference told her, I think <br/>
(so maybe the mom of this kid&#39;s here).   A schoolkid was asking the homeschooled <br/>
kid how she learned, how she learned this and that in particular, and then <br/>
said, &quot;How did you learn to tie your shoes if you didn&#39;t go to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If kids talk about what they&#39;ve learend, the other kid could ask them to <br/>
explain more, maybe.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly memorized a big addition fact and when kids would ask her what four and <br/>
four were she would ask if they knew what 87+253 (OR whatever it was) was, <br/>
and they said no, and she told them the answer.  It was her own idea. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I coached Payton and Will on the baseball team.  I&#39;m certain it was  meant to <br/>
denigrate Will.  Payton&#39;s parents are some of the biggest &quot;sports  parents&quot; <br/>
there are.  I can&#39;t stand to be around them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve already got that! My 4 year old is telling his friends (who are <br/>
in full day pre-k) that he doesn&#39;t NEED to go to school because he <br/>
learns at HOME. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want him to be snotty, but I can&#39;t quite bring myself to tell <br/>
him &quot;neither way is better, just different&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
So I just continue to gently mention how we should talk to other <br/>
people and how he doesn&#39;t like it when people talk that way to him, <br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think I need to find a way to let him win at something more often, <br/>
because now that I think about it, there&#39;s been quite a bit of &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
better/faster/smarter than you&quot; directed at various people...racing <br/>
his sister to eat popsicles, for example...<br/>

kids today!</div>

anyone save her post? It was probably September 2003.<br/>

If that date&#39;s right it will help me start searching in the archives but<br/>
that takes soooooo loooooong so if anyone saved it, could you send it to me?<br/>
