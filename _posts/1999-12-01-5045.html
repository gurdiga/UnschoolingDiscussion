<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is now 2:10am here and I can hear doors opening and shutting and timers on <br/>
the stove going off. Last night dh was just drifting off to sleep when 16yro <br/>
went in and showered in our shower, which woke dh up.  (They have their own <br/>
bath.) Not to mention that each of the older boys came in the other night and <br/>
opened the broken fridge door..thump. Even with signs on it. <br/>
    I shouldn&#39;t&#39;be up but I am just able to get on the computer.17yro thought <br/>
he&#39;d change the background or something on my screen and the picture had been <br/>
rolling since yesterday. We just fixed it.<br/>
    This has been a really rough week so far and it&#39;s only Wed.<br/>
