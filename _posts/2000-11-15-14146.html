<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180724552">Sue   My daughter almost 8 would love to have a penpal.  She has two she&#39;s<br/>
been writing to but they&#39;re slow to respond.  She loves to get mail, even<br/>
that marked &quot;occupant&quot;.  Do you want to do it via an email account (hotmail)<br/>
or via post.  Either way is good for Katherine.</div>
