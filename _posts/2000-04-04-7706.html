<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296896655">Stephanie,  I don&#39;t know if you have ever nursed before,  but in my <br/>
experience, it has been wonderful.  We adopted our first child, and he was <br/>
bottle fed.  My second and third child are &quot;home grown&quot; , and I nursed my son <br/>
who is now 3 for almost 2 yrs., and my daughter who is now almost 7 mos. <br/>
nurses now.  She eats some solids now, but not a great deal yet.  I have <br/>
never joined the LLL, but I have thought about it before.  If you never <br/>
nursed before, you will probably find it easier than making bottles-- <br/>
especially at night.  And as an added bonus,  it really helps burn off the <br/>
pregnancy weight!  :)                                                           <br/>

    Hi again!  I just read your post (LOL)!  Because she is so funny, I guess <br/>
I had you pictured more as Tracy Allman!  (I&#39;m not sure if I have her last <br/>
name spelled right)  I used to watch her tv show a few yrs back!  Anyway, <br/>
keep in touch ! :)              Karen</div>
