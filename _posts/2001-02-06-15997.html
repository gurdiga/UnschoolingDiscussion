&lt;&lt;  I find it ironic that those who question vaccines are <br/>
seen as irresponsible but many of those who vaccinate do it blindly without <br/>
any research. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same with homeschooling and school, though.<br/>
<br/>
If you send your kids to school, blindly, without any research, people call <br/>
that being a god parent.  If you pull them out, you&#39;d better be able to prove <br/>
beyond the shadow of your relatives&#39; and various government agencies&#39; doubt <br/>
that you&#39;re not neglectful or ignorant, because you are Risking That Child&#39;s <br/>
Future.  Each individual case of school having screwed a kid up (or killed <br/>
him) is a single aberration.  ANY case of unsuccessful (or <br/>
not-on-school-schedule) homeschooling is seen as damning to the whole idea of <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
HEY, and come to think of it, someone said I should stick to talking about <br/>
unschooling.  How rude!  I can talk about religion as well as I can talk <br/>
about unschooling.  I can look coca cola up on the internet better than <br/>
anyone else here (or maybe I&#39;m the only one who wrote a report... &lt;g&gt;), and I <br/>
think ALL of that sort of inquiry and discussion is the stuff of continuous <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else wants to tell me what topics I&#39;m to be restricted to, just <br/>
don&#39;t do it in private.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112252549">amen! (heeh, I just got tired of saying &quot;i agree&quot; or<br/>
&quot;bravo&quot; or different &quot;hear here&quot; variations...)<br/>
In any case, very good point. I could ramble about<br/>
THAT one for awhile. <br/>
But I won&#39;t. (THANKYOU screams the list) &lt;g&gt;<br/>
