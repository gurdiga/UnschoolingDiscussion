<div id="ygrps-yiv-978258004">An IT person told me (via a local hs list) about a new web hosting company<br/>
that is offering three years of free web hosting.  I thought perhaps some<br/>
folks here might be interested in checking it out.<br/>
<br/>
I have signed up but havent begun using the service yet but its supposed<br/>
to be the kind of service you would normally pay about $20  a month for.<br/>
They ask for your name and address but no credit card, they are based in<br/>
Europe and want to develop a US customer base.<br/>
<br/>
Im not getting anything for sending folks to check it out, just thought it<br/>
might be of interest, maybe a good way for kids to develop their own web<br/>
pages.<br/>

Methinks you left something out of your post.<br/>
You are not getting paid for sending folks where?<br/>
