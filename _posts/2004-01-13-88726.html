<div id="ygrps-yiv-275759485">I don&#39;t know you and I&#39;m balling! You sound like such a wonderful mother and woman, and I am so sorry for your family&#39;s loss. <br/>
<br/>
I read Sandra&#39;s post yesterday, and my heart went out to you. Later as my kids and I were playing outside, my Sam (3.5) went into our fish pond trying to break the ice on it. He only went in up to his waist, but I thought of you and what you must have gone through as my girls and I ran him inside, got him warm and put him by the woodstove. My whole soul mourns for you, Joanna! <br/>
<br/>
You and your family sound so strong and courageous and loving. You are an inspiration as you have found strategies to continue to incorporate your Sam into your lives.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
