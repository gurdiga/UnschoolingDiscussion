<div id="ygrps-yiv-966901022">O.k. Here is a real life question.  My son has, what seems to the rest of the family, an addiction to sugar.  He can&#39;t eat just a few cookies.  He eats the whole pack.  If we don&#39;t have any sweet goodies at the moment, he will eat sugar directly out of the canister.  This is a problem for two reasons.  1) No one in the house will get any sweet snacks, if he is allowed to eat all he wants.  2) He will choose to go without food and just eat sweets if allowed.  Our house always has fresh vegetables and other healthy natural foods, because we have parrots.  <br/>

He agrees that he feels better when he limits his sugar.  I agree that I feel better when I&#39;m not carrying extra weight.  That doesn&#39;t make it easy.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460657097">&lt;&lt;How would an unschooler handle this?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends on so many factors.  Different people have different body<br/>
chemistries and so can handle different levels of &quot;not so<br/>
nutritiously-dense&quot; foods.<br/>
<br/>
For some people, it simply isn&#39;t much of a problem....for other people, it<br/>
causes tremendous health problems.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t set some arbitrary limit on the amount of sugar I think is<br/>
appropriate for him.  I would watch his health.  I would continue to offer<br/>
nutritious things.  I would talk about how there are other people in the<br/>
house who might like a cookie too.<br/>
<br/>
If there were no health problems, I wouldn&#39;t get in a twist about it.<br/>
<br/>
My son (age 10) developed serious dental issues due to sugar and vinegar (he<br/>
lived on sweets and pickles, refusing almost all other food).  The dentist<br/>
said if he kept eating those things he would have dentures by the age of 20.<br/>
<br/>
So I no longer bring those things into the house.  I no longer offer them to<br/>
my children.  But if we are out, or they are at a friend&#39;s house, and have<br/>
some cookies or pickles, it isn&#39;t a big deal because it is occassional.<br/>
<br/>
I think the way unschoolers handle things is to deal with real life issues,<br/>
not arbitrary ones.<br/>

My instincts were good.  I felt like he acted like he felt better when he would eat more protein.  It also fits because he is great at skipping meals when he decides that they don&#39;t suit him.  You can tell this bugs me.  He is welcome to get something else to eat, which is what my other children will do.  My son will just skip eating.  (Part of me is probably jealous, because food means nothing to him and I&#39;m really making an effort to lose weight right now!)<br/>

try to remember that when I give them a snack.  Now that I think about it,<br/>
if I wait too long to give them something, they, especially Stella will want<br/>
nothing but sugar and is pretty grumpy about it.  Hmmm...this might be what<br/>
made her so sick during all that movie watching.  She was so occupied, she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t think to eat or ask for anything, and I would be so busy cleaning<br/>
house or whatever while she was occupied, I probably didn&#39;t think of it<br/>
either.  Though often, I would bring them food while they watched, so I&#39;m<br/>
not sure.   Still, there were times, when they were just in there watching<br/>
and not eating....<br/>

Good idea.   And though it was mentioned way down in that paragraph I want to <br/>
mention it bigger:<br/>
<br/>
PROTEIN.   He needs protein three or five times a day.   Cheese or nuts if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like meat.  Eggs.  Beans.  If he does like meat, consider jerkey, or <br/>
little cubes of ham or chicken that he can grab a few of from an <br/>
easily-accessible container when he&#39;s feeling that need.<br/>
<br/>
He can learn to know he needs it if after a few instances of protein making <br/>
him feel better he can &quot;self medicate&quot; (as it were).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is not having the trappings of school in our homes. So - I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t make him take a required course in nutrition, I wouldn&#39;t give <br/>
him tests on the quantities of sugar in different foods, and I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
grade him on his eating habits.<br/>
<br/>
Okay - little tongue in cheek.<br/>
<br/>
But - when we talk specifically about unschooling - it is really about <br/>
not &quot;schooling&quot; at home.<br/>
<br/>
The other stuff - all the respectful, open, generous, gracious, <br/>
non-punitive, thinking parenting stuff - is a more or less natural <br/>
outcome of living an unschooing lifestyle, but people who control their <br/>
kids diet can certainly still be unschoolers and many are.  Lots of <br/>
unschoolers don&#39;t allow ANY sugar in their homes and eat only organic <br/>
foods and don&#39;t eat meat or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So - I just wanted to say that there is no specific &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
answer to this question. BUT, there are answers from unschoolers. And <br/>
MANY unschoolers find that when they&#39;ve let go of control over their <br/>
chidlren&#39;s learning and seen how their kids can think and learn and <br/>
make decisions and experiment and - be trusted - that it only seems <br/>
logical to let go of other areas that they are exerting parental <br/>
control. Those other areas, such as food, bedtimes, how kids dress (or <br/>
don&#39;t &lt;g&gt;), seem to be obvious next candidates for close examination <br/>
and letting go of arbitrary rules and replacement with family <br/>
discussions, joint consideration for ourselves and each other, and <br/>
coming up with principles to live by.<br/>
<br/>
So you will get LOTS of unschoolers&#39; advice. Not the &quot;unschooling <br/>
answer.&quot;<br/>

When I was a kid, my mom always said things about my eating habits.  <br/>
<br/>
I weighed more than she did, though I was also 5 inches taller by <br/>
<br/>
the time I was 12.  My defense was to eat.  My comfort was to eat.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Still have those defenses and comforts almost 20 years later.  Hard <br/>

I&#39;m glad you wrote this, I forgot about this as a cause for sugar <br/>
craving.  I&#39;ve always been hypoglycemic and before I knew what it was <br/>
I craved sugar all the time.  The downside is when you eat sugar, you <br/>
get an insulin spike and your sugar levels end up even lower than <br/>
before you ate the sugar, so you crave even more sugar.  What has <br/>
helped me is eating complex carbohydrates combined with protein.  The <br/>
body slowly breaks these down and the blood sugar stays more stable.  <br/>
When I start craving sugar I eat multi-grain bread with peanut <br/>
butter.  It makes the craving go away without the subsequent drop in <br/>
blood sugar.  Eating often is important too.  I have to eat multiple <br/>
snacks during the day to avoid the drop.  <br/>
<br/>
It is hard because you are craving the thing that will make it <br/>
worse.  See if you can encourage him to breads, pastas and protein.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933534281">&quot;We&quot; refers to my children also.  Because my children have choices, and because we eat out too much, we eat at McDonald&#39;s.  McDonald&#39;s burgers and fries are truly unhealthy on a regular basis.  A way to bond with your parrots is to share food.  There have been instances, in office buildings, where a parrot has gotten sick after two months of McDonald&#39;s, especially the fries.  An office worker, or several, save some of their lunch to share with the parrot.  After the parrot is at death&#39;s door and they try to trace what could have made it sick, they discover the McDonald&#39;s eating habit.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we all mention McDonald&#39;s food being unhealthy as a way to remind ourselves that we do have choices and our birds don&#39;t have as many.  It is up to us to make sure the birds only get healthy food.   <br/>

Providing the option of good food that people enjoy is better than standing<br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why are you eating out too much?<br/>
<br/>
The daily routine is your responsibility. If you&#39;re out too much at lunch,<br/>
it isn&#39;t your children&#39;s responsibility to choose healthy food to make up<br/>
for your not having them home at lunch where you can make them something<br/>
that&#39;s better than McDonald&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
That situation is really no different than your husband bringing home boxes<br/>
of Godiva chocolates and then when you choose to eat some saying &quot;I would<br/>
NEVER allow the parrots to eat such unhealthy food.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s up to us to create the environment not up to the kids to make the<br/>
choices we want them to. If we&#39;re creating the environment that has them out<br/>
at lunch where McDonald&#39;s is a convenient and tasty (to the kids) choice,<br/>
the responsibility for the situation isn&#39;t theirs. It&#39;s ours. If you&#39;d<br/>
rather they chose soup and sandwiches for lunch it&#39;s better that you fill<br/>
the home with the smell of homemade soup and fresh baked bread than to drive<br/>
by McDonald&#39;s when everyone is hungry. We can&#39;t make our kids choose soup<br/>
and sandwiches but we can create better choices for them than being near<br/>
McDonald&#39;s at lunch and then blaming them for making that choice.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, just out of curiousity, what happens with a child who likes *no* <br/>
forms of protein? This is the biggest issue with my daughter. She <br/>
gets hypoglycemic, cranky beyond belief, but there are virtually no <br/>
proteins she will eat and definitely none once she gets to the cranky <br/>
phase. We were at a friend&#39;s house for a BBQ last night, and I packed <br/>
along chicken for the BBQ, veggie burgers (both of my kids go back <br/>
and forth on whether they want to eat meat or not), a bag of almonds, <br/>
and a peanut butter sandwich. None of them were a go for her. We&#39;ve <br/>
sat down together and tried to come up with a list of proteins that <br/>
she would be okay with eating. She&#39;ll say a few things, but when the <br/>
time comes and I suggest protein, she doesn&#39;t want to eat any of <br/>
them. If she eats more carbs or sugar, we&#39;re back into the crabby <br/>
cycle. She did eat one peanut butter sandwich this week (a first!). I <br/>
can very occasionally get her to eat eggs if I cook them flat in a <br/>
pan and give her cookie cutters to cut them into shapes, but mostly <br/>
she plays with them and leaves them on the plate. <br/>
<br/>
None of this is an issue with my son, who is most easy-going about <br/>
food and eats a pretty healthy balanced diet all on his own. If I <br/>
suggest he eat some protein or get a snack because he&#39;s starting to <br/>
get that cranky/hungry thing, he&#39;ll go right ahead and get something <br/>
or ask me to fix him something. Ironically, this is the kid whose <br/>
diet was completely and totally controlled due to multiple, severe, <br/>
food allergies when he was younger (no longer an issue though), and <br/>
he&#39;s the easy-going one about food. My daughter, who had no such <br/>
issues (well, she&#39;s allergic to dairy, but it&#39;s not a life-<br/>
threatening allergy) and fortunately didn&#39;t have to go through that <br/>
total food control just doesn&#39;t seem to make the mood-food connection <br/>
(even though if, by some act of God, she does get protein, it makes a <br/>
huge difference - literally, within 5 minutes, she&#39;s back to her <br/>
cheerful self) or have any inclination to eat any form of protein at <br/>
all. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt; Any creative ideas welcome. <br/>

break them down and helps keep the blood sugar level stable.  By <br/>
keeping the blood sugar level stable you avoid the drops in blood <br/>
sugar that cause the cravings.  Protein is very important too but we <br/>
need some sugar (in the form of complex carbs) to keep our blood <br/>
sugar stable.   Our body does need some sugar to make ATP.<br/>

<br/>
Just a suggestion for adding protein to smoothies...<br/>
We use a whey protein called American Whey.  Usually I buy the <br/>
banana flavored.  It has an excellent consistency and it doesn&#39;t <br/>
leave that horrible whey aftertaste the way that some products can <br/>
(like Designer Protein or Twinlabs which are very popular brands you <br/>
will come across at GNC).  They also have a LOT of flavors.  You <br/>
might find a local supplier by going to www.americanwhey.com.  I buy <br/>
it at my gym.  Generally, I will make a smoothie with OJ, ice, <br/>
strawberries, half banana and a scoop of whey.  Make sure to adjust <br/>
the whey or any other protein to appropriate levels for your childs <br/>
age/weight, etc., she probably can&#39;t absorb a whole scoop of whey <br/>
protein (my kids use 1/2 to 3/4 scoop).<br/>
<br/>
If you do decide to buy a supplement, it can be expensive trial and <br/>
error to buy large containers of powder and find out you hate the <br/>
taste.  If you live in an area with a lot of gyms, you could always <br/>
stop in and try a protein shake at the juice bar.  This is a good <br/>
way of testing the different types of supplements for a few dollars <br/>
before you decide to buy a whole can for $30-40; most gyms carry <br/>
several brands and brands differ between gyms usually.  Plus a good <br/>
juice bar often has fun &quot;recipes&quot; for making protein smoothies.<br/>
<br/>
Other protein ideas for smoothies include blending in pasteurized <br/>
egg whites.  If the concoction is frothy enough and it&#39;s well <br/>
blended, it&#39;s not bad (and cheaper than whey)!  Many powdered <br/>
protein supplements can be blended into puddings, etc.  Most of the <br/>
women&#39;s BODYBUILDING magazines (Oxygen, MF for Her - but not the <br/>
diet magazines like Fit, etc.) have great recommendations for <br/>
preparing high protein meals, snacks and ways to incorporate more <br/>
protein/less carbs into traditional recipes.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806090862">There are a lot of things that have small amounts of protein in them, <br/>
like cold cereal, Wheat Thins, Nutrigrain bars, chewy granola bars, <br/>
pudding etc.  They each have about 3 grams of protein per serving.  <br/>
If she will eat a variety of foods with small amounts of protein, it <br/>
may add up to enough throughout the day.<br/>
