<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, so far today:<br/>
<br/>
3yod woke up at 9:00am and looked out window to find about 7&quot; snow. While<br/>
waiting for 5yo sis to wake up, we made waffles with dd dumping the<br/>
ingredients in and mixing, and then she watched some cartoons while I<br/>
cooked them. Getting impatient with sis (who was up till 1:00am trying to<br/>
win some kind of ticket on her Reader Rabbit computer game), she went in<br/>
every few minutes and would say &quot;wake up sunshine&quot;. No luck. Finally at<br/>
about 11:30, 5yod awoke and saw the snow. She quick rolled up a waffle,<br/>
they both put their snow clothes on and played in the snow. They built a<br/>
snowman, shoveled the sidewalk, and sled down our hill. They learned the<br/>
Frosty the Snowman song. Then they shoveled out the chicken coop door and<br/>
fed the chickens and collected eggs. When they got too cold, they came in<br/>
and made hot cocoa and made sandwiches with the leftover waffles. 5yod<br/>
played with Dad&#39;s remote control car. She decided she wanted to make a<br/>
remote control caterpillar. She decorated an egg carton strip and taped<br/>
batteries to it. She was frustrated she couldn&#39;t make it move that way.<br/>
Dh showed and explained how the remote control worked and why the<br/>
caterpillar wouldn&#39;t move. DD decided to tie the caterpillar to the roof<br/>
of the car and made it move that way. 3yod chased it around the house.<br/>
Since they have been inside, they have also made a tent village in the<br/>
living room, put on a magic show, and are now playing Mommie and Baby<br/>
(It&#39;s interesting to watch 5yod imitate me. I definitely need to work on<br/>
changing my tone of voice). I&#39;m trying to think of something quick to<br/>
throw together for dinner, and they will most likely want to help me with<br/>
that. That&#39;s about it so far!<br/>
