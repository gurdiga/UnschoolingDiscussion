&lt;&lt; How about a bar of soap at the creek?<br/>
 We used to take a bath in the lake in WI.  It was so much fun.  Use<br/>
 Ivory it floats!<br/>
 My kids swim in the pool almost everyday too...this usually sort of<br/>
 cleans them off.<br/>
 We have also hosed them off with soap and shampoo in the wash stall in<br/>
 the barn, and in the yard.<br/>
 Ha, ha, ha...<br/>
 But, my kids love to take baths and showers.<br/>

more biodegradable soap. I cringe thinking of Ivory in a creek or river. Poor <br/>
fish, plant and other life sustaining organisms in a natural water area. <br/>

<br/>
I think a lot of it depends on the reasons behind the question and the<br/>
reasons behind the answer.  Why do you not want to buy something for your<br/>
dd?  In our home, a lot of what the kids would like, we simply can&#39;t afford<br/>
(we have 5 kids and one income).  Is there a way the kid can earn money to<br/>
get it themselves?  Or pay for half?  Is it that you simply think the item<br/>
is not a good purchase, somehow against your values?  Again, can the kid pay<br/>
for it?  How about a discussion of values and see if the kid really wants<br/>
the item?<br/>
<br/>
As far as the party goes.....are you concerned your dd would not be safe in<br/>
the company of her sisters?  If so, then little sis gets to whine in my<br/>
opinion.  I might suggest alternate activities but.....    Is it that the<br/>
big sisters don&#39;t really want little sis to go, just don&#39;t want to be<br/>
&quot;mean?&quot;  I would talk with big sisters about how they are putting you on a<br/>
spot.  If sisters don&#39;t mind her going and you think she would be safe with<br/>
them, then I&#39;m with little sis....why can&#39;t she go?<br/>

they either say no to her or if I say yes then they<br/>
have to be prepared to be responsible for her. Thanks<br/>
for your input!<br/>
