<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Unfortunatly, the only way to dx hypoglycemia is 
with blood work, but it doesn&#39;t neccessarily mean being poked with needles 
repeatedly. I have a friend with LBS who has done vitamin K shots from time to 
time, but I was diagnosed several years ago and have never had them. A lot of 
times it can be controlled through diet (you&#39;ve alredy found that to some 
degree). You should probablly ask your GP for her/his opinion.</font></div>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">How were you diagnosed with this?&nbsp; I have 
suspected that I have this for a number of years, but due to a &quot;doctor phobia&quot; 
have not sought treatment.&nbsp; I am afraid that I will be poked repeatedly 
with needles! &lt;g&gt;</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">What I noticed first was that I get a severe 
headache if I go more than 3 hours without eating.&nbsp; If I eat, the headache 
disappears.&nbsp; I can relate to the other symptoms you listed, but never knew 
they were signs of LBS.</font></div>
