<br/>
I think if your relationship is a solid, good, loving one, most people hear<br/>
the intent rather than the specific language.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little, they went to a nursery at church.  The woman<br/>
working there was anything but gentle with the kids.  She would say things<br/>
like &quot;I&#39;m going to pinch your head off if you do that again.&quot; etc..<br/>
<br/>
I was somewhat flabbergasted.  The kids absolutely loved her.  They saw past<br/>
her words and into her heart.  Just a thought.<br/>

&gt; &gt; meals.....not that they feel resentful and mean towards their child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When it&#39;s said to the child and the child hears resentfulness, does it<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I said &quot;That&#39;s your mess. You&#39;ll need to clean it up,&quot; to my daughter when<br/>
&gt; she was small and it sounded like a reasonable fact of life: that we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; responsible for our own messes. But when she said it to me about something<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; spilled it didn&#39;t sound reasonable. It sounded mean and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; exactly how I sounded to her.<br/>

better for her to use her own words than to parrot mean parents of the past.<br/>

<br/>
One of the nicest people ever in my life babysat Kirby once when he was two <br/>
or three, just long enough for me and Keith to go to the movies.  Kirby always <br/>
liked him, still does.   There were other young adults there too, this guy&#39;s <br/>
girlfriend and roommate and another friend or two.<br/>
<br/>
When we came back, Jeff immediately confessed a horrible incident.  He said, <br/>
&quot;I spanked Kirby.&quot;  I could tell he was NOT happy to have done it or report <br/>
it.  I asked why, and he said he wouldn&#39;t stop doing something or other, and <br/>
Jeff had said if he didn&#39;t stop he would swat him, and Kirby didn&#39;t stop so he <br/>
swatted him.  He said he HAD to since he had said he would, but he wished he <br/>
hadn&#39;t said it.<br/>
<br/>
While the story was being told, Kirby was perfectly happy and comfortable, <br/>
the others there were all happy, and only Jeff was in distress.   I smiled and <br/>
shook my head and said &quot;What if you had said &#39;If you don&#39;t stop doing that I&#39;ll <br/>
kill you?&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He got it right away. <br/>
<br/>
I told him it&#39;s better to change your mind and say &quot;I don&#39;t know why I said <br/>
that, sorry,&quot; and just find something better for the kid to do than to stick <br/>
with a bad plan.   <br/>
<br/>
So the nursery lady didn&#39;t really pinch their heads off, but she gave them <br/>
the image of the threat of head removal, and that&#39;s not as sweet as she could&#39;ve <br/>
been.<br/>

cranky about fixing different foods - I was just sort of casually <br/>
commenting that I was feeling a bit like a short-order cook. I was fine <br/>
with it - we were having fun. BUT - the minute I heard that come out of <br/>
my mouth it had an uglyish should to it and I was sorry I&#39;d even <br/>
uttered those words. And i do not think my own mother ever DID say it - <br/>
I just picked up that kid of negativity out of the air (probably from <br/>
books or tv or friends&#39; mothers...who knows?)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; been.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely true.  But sweet isn&#39;t always the goal.<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t do sweet all day, every day.  I don&#39;t do sweet all day, every<br/>
day.  I&#39;m not always sweet with my dh either.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m aiming for ugly.....but we joke, we say stuff that is<br/>
slightly edgy (not with the intent to hurt).<br/>
<br/>
I remember a post Sandra made a long time ago about a young boy spending<br/>
time at their house and trying too hard to be &quot;something&quot;....she posted &quot;I<br/>
told him &#39;Try not to be a prick&#39;&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t exactly sweet.  Certainly doesn&#39;t sound it when it is written out<br/>
flat.  But it was said with concern, with compassion for this boy.  If I<br/>
remember correctly, the boy wasn&#39;t offended.  Again, sweet wasn&#39;t the goal.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I am talking about.  If someone were raised by very unloving<br/>
parents who told him &quot;Don&#39;t be a prick&quot; or called him &quot;you little prick&quot;.<br/>
The boy might have heard that as resentful and mean.  But he was able to see<br/>
into Sandra&#39;s heart and know her intent.<br/>
<br/>
There is a whole lot more going on in a conversation besides the specific<br/>
words being spoken.  There is the history with the person, people you know&#39;s<br/>
history with that person, body language, inflection, history of that topic,<br/>
childhood of both people involved, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Judging phrases as necessarily having positive or negative effects on people<br/>
no matter what isn&#39;t productive, I don&#39;t think.  Looking at what you are<br/>
saying, checking other people&#39;s reactions to it, understanding your dynamics<br/>
with that person.....those things, I think, are much more productive.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO<br/>

considered my words and my intend and put words together appropriate to that <br/>

<br/>
My objection is to people thoughtlessly or unconsciously using phrases from <br/>
the archives of put-down parenting.  I think it&#39;s a Very Bad thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is a whole lot more going on in a conversation besides the specific<br/>
<br/>
words being spoken. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But you seem to be defending a specific phrase which is NOT rearranged from <br/>
one conversation to another, and has been said for at least 50 years by parents <br/>
intending to put kids down.  I object to none of the individual words in &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
not a short-order cook.&quot;  I object to that specific word string being said to <br/>
any child who had an honest hope that her mother would make her some food she <br/>
liked, and no amount of &quot;depends on the intent&quot; will change my initial <br/>
objection and point which is that there are several phrases designed and repeated <br/>
for negative purposes and it will help unschoolers to hear them if they <br/>
accidently say them and to try to avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
Some people talk all in cliches.  It&#39;s lame.<br/>
We can strive to communicate directly and honestly and in our own words.<br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>14 May 2004, at  2:32pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620009677">My daughter was mad today because she felt there was &quot;nothing to eat&quot;, even though I went for groceries on Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
Now, granted, I *didn&#39;t* get a lot, because we are low on money this week.  But I&#39;m SO tired of hearing that we have nothing to eat because so often we have PLENTY to eat!<br/>
<br/>
I just said &quot;I&#39;m not going to listen to this right now&quot; and went into the house.  It is horribly hot out, we have no air conditioning, the dew point is probably 70.   I&#39;m miserable, she&#39;s miserable, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So we went our separate ways for the day.  She did some water fun stuff outside, I cleaned and took a nap.<br/>
<br/>
Just this afternoon, as I was driving her up to her friend&#39;s house, I joked that she couldn&#39;t go swimming unless I could get in the pool too.  <br/>
<br/>
She laughed, and said &quot;you&#39;re good mom&quot; (not sarcastically, she meant it).  I said, &quot;yeah, I&#39;m good, but I don&#39;t know how to get groceries&quot; and winked to acknowledge her earlier frustration.  I was just taking a stressful moment from earlier in the day and making it a non-stressful memory.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I said &quot;you&#39;re a brat&quot;, with the term meant to be endearing.  We were both smiling and it was a fun conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The difference, and she knew it too, was that I wasn&#39;t serious.  I was just acknowledging how human we really are, and how thats really ok on a hot miserable day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m *really* glad I didn&#39;t blow up about her grocery comment.  <br/>
<br/>
Ahhhhh, and as I sit here, there is a breeze blowing in, a storm on the horizon, and all three kids are gone for the night.  Hubby and I are going dancing and who knows what else.  <br/>
<br/>
Kristen, who just hung the laundry out on the line, and plans to let it there until it eventually dries LOL.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; intending to put kids down. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I&#39;m not really.  So I spent the afternoon trying to figure out what I&#39;m<br/>
trying to say so I can post clearly (now there&#39;s a concept &lt;grin&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I think when we tell people specific things to do and specific things to<br/>
say, or not to do or not to say....when we talk about specific words and<br/>
actions....it is almost like giving an unschooling recipe:<br/>
<br/>
Like Step 1. Make as many different breakfasts as the people in your house<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
Step 2.  Don&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Step 3. Say.....&lt;whatever&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
It seems legalistic.  Just as unschooling looks different in every home but<br/>
follows the same basic guidelines of trust and acceptance, gentle parenting<br/>
looks different as well but follows the same basic guidelines of love and<br/>
respect being a 2 way street.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that throwing a cliche out may not be the best approach to<br/>
parenting. It probably is worth examining.   But just because it is a<br/>
cliche, perhaps even one that people have used as a put down doesn&#39;t<br/>
automatically make it taboo.<br/>
<br/>
Most people would be offended if they were told &quot;f**k you&quot; by their spouse.<br/>
Dh and I have a relationship where being a smarta** is elevated to an<br/>
artform.  So when I leave him speechless where all he can do is laugh and<br/>
say &quot;f**k you&quot;, it is considered high praise, even if it is a cliche that<br/>
many consider a put down.<br/>
<br/>
That is all I&#39;m saying.  Perhaps we will just disagree on this one.<br/>

&gt; objection and point which is that there are several phrases designed and<br/>
repeated<br/>
&gt; for negative purposes and it will help unschoolers to hear them if they<br/>
&gt; accidently say them and to try to avoid them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people talk all in cliches.  It&#39;s lame.<br/>
&gt; We can strive to communicate directly and honestly and in our own words.<br/>

them what time train to get back and she&#39;ll pick them up.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why am I so reluctant? At this age I went into town every Saturday and met<br/>
my friends. And I walked there for 45 minutes alone. From the age of 8 I<br/>
went to the shops alone or with friends and that was a half hour walk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

parenting<br/>
looks different as well but follows the same basic guidelines of love <br/>
and<br/>
respect being a 2 way street.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is the hardest thing for me about unschooling.  Knowing when or <br/>
if ever I can say no.  Knowing where the line is between my personal <br/>
boundaries and making sure my kids are emotionally whole and feel <br/>
loved.  <br/>
<br/>
And still wondering if I&#39;ll ever grasp how to master finding time for <br/>
my own interests and work.  Just a few weeks ago someone (Julie?) <br/>
said she has five kids and still does all this amazing (to me) amount <br/>
of work with them around.  I&#39;m in awe, because I don&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
An example...<br/>
Today one of Alisha&#39;s friends was having a yard sale, so we went and <br/>
visited their sale.  Then we went to a few other yard sales and found <br/>
some neat stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Luke had to go to the bathroom on the way home, so we stopped at a <br/>
grocery store (closest bathroom).  When we walked past the salad bar, <br/>
he wanted some things off of it, so I let him fill up a container.  <br/>
<br/>
The boys hadn&#39;t wanted to go to yard sales, so I convinced them by <br/>
telling them we could stop and get milkshakes afterwards, so we <br/>
stopped for milkshakes.  <br/>
<br/>
At one of the sales Alisha and I found some new yugioh cards, so <br/>
Alisha asked me to play yugioh with her when we got home.  She set <br/>
the cards up while I hung a load of laundry outside.  I took a break <br/>
at one point to make english muffins, pour drinks, and go see <br/>
something that the boys had made outside.  <br/>
<br/>
After playing several games, Alisha and I looked up some stuff about <br/>
yugioh online.  Then I started making supper, but dh had to finish <br/>
that because Matt shut the door on his toe and needed my attention.  <br/>
I bandaided him up and it still hurt and he needed me to sit and hold <br/>
him for awhile.  <br/>
<br/>
After supper I looked something up online for Matt.  He really liked <br/>
something that he bought at the yardsale and wanted to know if he <br/>
could buy something similar somewhere.  Then Alisha asked me to play <br/>
yugioh some more.  I asked if she could clear the table while I got <br/>
the laundry in off the line, and she did.  We played 2 more games and <br/>
then spent awhile looking through all the cards not in our decks and <br/>
deciding what we could part with.  She wants to have a yard sale now <br/>
too, and wants to sell her extra yugioh cards there.  As we were <br/>
looking through the cards, something sparked a question she&#39;d <br/>
wondered about from seeing it on her video game.  She asked what <br/>
pyro, hydro, aero, and geo meant.  I knew what they meant and told <br/>
her, but looked up geo in the dictionary to make sure I was right.  <br/>
<br/>
I made a 5 minute phone call to discuss with a friend plans for some <br/>
clubs Alisha wants to get involved in. <br/>
<br/>
I took a shower and then lay, read, and sang with Alisha and then <br/>
Matt on their beds before they went to sleep.  (Luke went to bed with <br/>
dh).  <br/>
<br/>
I came down, ran the dishwasher, did a load of dishes by hand.  Now <br/>
I&#39;m up too late finding time for myself online.  I&#39;ll probably throw <br/>
in a load of laundry before bed so it&#39;s ready to get hung up in the <br/>
morning, and I&#39;d like to read some of my book but will probably fall <br/>
asleep after 1 or 2 pages. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT complaining about being home with and spending lots of time <br/>
with my kids.  Really!  I just wonder if there&#39;s something I&#39;m <br/>
not &quot;getting&quot;.  I&#39;ve been reading about moms getting lots of work <br/>
done even with 5 kids in the house and how moms should pursue <br/>
interests on their own.  When I do really need to get work done or <br/>
pursue an interest for myself it usually involves telling a kid no.  <br/>
I might have time in a few hours, or maybe tomorrow, but not now.  <br/>
Then they&#39;re sad and I feel bad. Last week I went out for lunch with <br/>
a friend and Alisha, who&#39;s almost 11, begged me not to go.  She would <br/>
miss me too much.  Her dad was home with her, and they get along <br/>
great. Yet some of you go to work...don&#39;t your kids ask you not to <br/>
ever leave them?   The only work I got done today was 2 loads of <br/>
laundry and food prep.  I did the dishes after everyone else was <br/>
asleep.  Is that bad?  Should I be able to get more done when my kids <br/>
are around?  They ask me to do stuff with them constantly.  Not that <br/>
they don&#39;t ever do stuff on their own, but usually what happens is <br/>
that while one child is off doing something on his own, a different <br/>
child wants my attention.  Usually I&#39;m doing something with someone.  <br/>
Is there something wrong that my kids want so much of me?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very concerned about doing it all &quot;right&quot;.  I want my kids to be <br/>
emotionally whole and healthy and feeling very loved by their mom.  <br/>
<br/>
Back to the &quot;I&#39;m not a short order cook&quot; theme...  IS there ever a <br/>
time when you can say, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired, I can&#39;t get that right now?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Example...All day long I got Luke everything he wanted to eat and <br/>
drink.  No problem. For supper, I made hamburgers which I knew he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want, so I made hot dogs too.  Dh cut the hot dog up for <br/>
him, I got him ketchup on his plate, got him a fork.  Poured him a <br/>
drink.  He wanted to take his plate to the couch (a few feet from the <br/>
table to watch tv), so he did.  Dh and I sat down to eat, kind of <br/>
tired, and as soon as I did, Luke said, &quot;Bring me my drink, Mommy&quot;.  <br/>
He had carried his plate in, sat down and got comfortable, and <br/>
realized he had forgotten his drink.  I was tired.  I said, &quot;Honey, <br/>
I&#39;m really tired.  Why don&#39;t you come get your drink.&quot;  He said no.  <br/>
Dh said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s right here whenever you want it.&quot;  He asked in a <br/>
whiny voice several more times and I was about to get up and get it <br/>
for him but then he finally did come out and get it himself.  <br/>
<br/>
In situations like that it&#39;s hard for me to know if I should just <br/>
always breathe and put a smile on my face and get up and serve, no <br/>
matter how tired I am, or can I sometimes say, &quot;I&#39;m tired honey, why <br/>
don&#39;t you get it&quot;.  And if he still says no, you get it, do I then do <br/>
it no matter what?  I can&#39;t imagine getting lots of work or pursuing <br/>
interesting things on my own without sometimes saying, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired <br/>
or busy, you&#39;ll have to get it this time&quot;.  or &quot;No, we just played <br/>
for 3 hours and now I need an hour to myself&quot;.  But does doing that <br/>
make them feel unloved?  Shouldn&#39;t I always meet their needs first <br/>
and THEN meet my needs if there&#39;s ever any time left over?   <br/>

<br/>
Personally I think you did a huge amount of cool stuff AND accomplished a<br/>
load of laundry AND a conversation with someone else. Seriously - look back<br/>
at it all written out and see what a great full day it was! <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;When I do really need to get work done or <br/>
pursue an interest for myself it usually involves telling a kid no.  <br/>
I might have time in a few hours, or maybe tomorrow, but not now.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, this is one of the hardest things for me (and I only have one<br/>
unless you count in giving dh the attention he needs to feel loved also).<br/>
The greatest boon for me has been a lap top computer so that I can check<br/>
email, do internet research and squeeze in moments on my scripts while still<br/>
being where she is. Also she can play computer games on it next to me while<br/>
I sprawl groggily on the bed - this is especially good because of her 28<br/>
hour long day. Lastly it is useful to keep always booted up and ready to go,<br/>
so that when I notice that Jayn has found something to do for 20 minutes<br/>
that doesn&#39;t need me, I can grab it.<br/>
  <br/>
&lt;&lt;Back to the &quot;I&#39;m not a short order cook&quot; theme...  IS there ever a <br/>
time when you can say, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired, I can&#39;t get that right now?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the time that is said around here is when it is true. I am getting<br/>
better at gauging how tired I am, and lately have been saying to Jayn<br/>
something like &quot;I&#39;ve got about 15 minutes left in me and then I&#39;m going to<br/>
bed&quot; instead of just getting increasingly grumpy and resentful until I snap<br/>
at her. By the same token if I say &quot;can you get it yourself&quot; then that is a<br/>
question for which the answer might genuinely be &quot;no&quot;. I find Jayn&#39;s whining<br/>
and misery more exhausting than the effort of heading off the whining by<br/>
accepting &quot;no, you get it&quot; or &quot;I need you to come with me&quot; (when I have to<br/>
get out of bed to turn on the bathroom light even though she can turn it on<br/>
herself and often does) and just staggering up and doing it as quickly as I<br/>
can. I&#39;m getting better at staying neutral if not cheerful about being<br/>
forced out of bed. What happens at the dinner table a lot, is that Jayn asks<br/>
me for her drink, and dh will get it for her - usually this is OK, sometimes<br/>
it just has to be me. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But does doing that <br/>
make them feel unloved?  Shouldn&#39;t I always meet their needs first <br/>
and THEN meet my needs if there&#39;s ever any time left over?&gt;&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to hearing from people with more experience on this one<br/>
too! Is it a matter of understanding the differences between &quot;needs&quot; and<br/>
&quot;wants&quot;? I don&#39;t know. So much of unschooling is acceptance and trust, even<br/>
when it seems counterintuitive or at least counter to what is accepted<br/>
conventional wisdom (like the idea that you have to make a child be<br/>
independent or they will always be clingy; we do the opposite allow a child<br/>
to cling as long as they need to and they will become truly independent and<br/>
confident). I have to trust that Jayn will become a pleasant, generous and<br/>
thoughtful person by being kinder to her than many parents who would simply<br/>
insist that their child get their own drink, or even be a little servant for<br/>
their parents. My dh remembers constantly being ordered to fetch stuff<br/>
(including cocktails) for his parents, regardless of his current activity. I<br/>
don&#39;t think it would have occurred to me to ask my mother to fetch me my<br/>
drink - since I would have been at the table with no choice in the matter,<br/>
unless I was actually sick. Actually Jayn is already eager to be helpful and<br/>
kind - like running to get the phone for me, and helping to clean, or<br/>
offering to get things for me.<br/>

<br/>
Sure.  Why not?<br/>
Anytime a person&#39;s really too tired and she tells the truth in her own words, <br/>
I have no problem.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is with people using a phrase off the bad-parent-pull-down-menu <br/>
(think Terminator) and saying &quot;I&#39;m not your slave&quot; every time a kid asks them to <br/>
do something, regardless of whether the parent has really thought a bit first <br/>
to consider whether it&#39;s a good idea to help, or whether she&#39;s too tired.<br/>
<br/>
Other options under the &quot;I&#39;m not your slave&quot; item are &quot;you&#39;re old enough to <br/>
do it yourself&quot; (said sharply like being old enough was some evil thing the <br/>
child did) and &quot;I&#39;m not your handmaid,&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not your servant,&quot; or &quot;Who do you <br/>
think you are?&quot; (which leads to its own other menu.<br/>
<br/>
My objection was to stock phrases.<br/>
I&#39;m honestly a little stunned that ANYONE here isn&#39;t getting that, but that <br/>
several aren&#39;t understanding it baffles me.<br/>

I got coffee and cigarettes for my parents for years and years.  Sometimes I <br/>
was told to make the coffee too.  I wouldn&#39;t have been allowed to drink it <br/>
even if I wanted to, because it was expensive.   My mom drank it black.  My dad <br/>
took cream and sugar.  I fixed it the way he liked it, but he invariably smiled <br/>
and said thank you really nicely.  My mom sometimes greeted her ordered <br/>
coffee delivery with &quot;Did you remember to take the trash out?&quot; or some equally <br/>
ungrateful thing.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I were working in the front yard last night, and Keith asked Marty <br/>
if he would felt like maybe getting a little dirty (the other two kids were <br/>
gone, but Marty would&#39;ve been the choice for this job anyway).  Marty said when <br/>
his game could pause, sure.  He came willing to help without knowing what the <br/>
task was.  Keith wanted two (big) wheelbarrow loads of dirt.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty brought one (from the back yard, up a single-board ramp, around the <br/>
house, quite a way) and Keith and I were distributing it where it needed to go.  <br/>
Marty was late with the second one, and kept not coming back, and while Keith <br/>
and I were doing other things we were joking and talking about whether Keith <br/>
should go &quot;supervise&quot; him, or whether we should just let him do it in his own <br/>
time, and Keith said no, let him do it however he wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
His dirt-choice was from the big hole he and a friend started digging several <br/>
years ago, and he was way down IN the hole, making it deeper.  And that&#39;s <br/>
slow.  But when the barrow was 2/3 full, Marty got a splinter, and he came up and <br/>
showed us, and said he was going to go try to get it out.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s Keith&#39;s fault, that splinter, because he leave his tools outside and <br/>
we&#39;re in the desert, and that shovel handle was too dry, needed oil or paint.<br/>
<br/>
So Keith and finished that load, and we would&#39;ve asked Marty to do one more, <br/>
but he came out and showed us he couldn&#39;t get the splinter, though he had dug. <br/>
 Keith and I both used to be excellent splinter surgeons, but we&#39;re both past <br/>
the point of seeing well without sunshine and a magnifying glass.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith asked Marty what he wanted to do, and Marty said he didn&#39;t want to help <br/>
anymore because it hurt.  Even putting anti-biotic creme on it had hurt.  <br/>
Keith said &quot;That&#39;s fine,&quot; and he really, truly meant it.<br/>
<br/>
That was cool, because I know Keith&#39;s dad just used to demand Keith do this <br/>
or that, dig post holes, change the oil, pull all the weeds, haul rocks, <br/>
without ANY consideration to what Keith might rather be doing.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I think when we tell people specific things to do and specific things to<br/>
<br/>
say, or not to do or not to say....when we talk about specific words and<br/>
<br/>
actions....it is almost like giving an unschooling recipe:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Like Step 1. Make as many different breakfasts as the people in your house<br/>
<br/>
want.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Step 2.  Don&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with step 1.  I think it comes under <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be thoughtful and aware of your children as individuals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Decide what your priorities are.  Children over house?  Learning over <br/>
schedule?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Be mindful, not kneejerk.  Don&#39;t try to use old methods for new purposes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I just made those up now. &lt;g&gt;  But they&#39;re the kinds of PRINCIPLES (not <br/>
rules) that are discussed all the time in unschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Step 2.  Don&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Step 3. Say.....&lt;whatever&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It seems legalistic.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Really?  I&#39;m repeating myself like a little telephone tape and somehow what <br/>
I&#39;m saying isn&#39;t coming through.  Can someone else help me say it?  Pam and <br/>
Joyce tried, I think.<br/>
<br/>
There are some phrases which don&#39;t exist in ANY conversations except those <br/>
which put down children, which treat them as second-class humans to be scoffed <br/>
at and abused.  One of those phrases is &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook.&quot;  There <br/>
are several other phrases like that.  If a parent is using those phrases, it is <br/>
indicative that the parent is working from super-ego voices, not from her own <br/>
voice.  She is having throw-back to other people and situations and attitudes, <br/>
not dealing directly with her own child in that moment.<br/>
<br/>
A person who is quoting parents or grandparents for purposes of thwarting a <br/>
child is not living in the unschooling moment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I agree that throwing a cliche out may not be the best approach to<br/>
<br/>
parenting. It probably is worth examining.   But just because it is a<br/>
<br/>
cliche, perhaps even one that people have used as a put down doesn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
automatically make it taboo.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Okay.  There it is.<br/>
<br/>
Why should a parent not try to rid their mind and soul of put-down cliches?  <br/>
Why should a parent not be willing to encourage other unschoolers to cleanse <br/>
themselves of anti-child rhetoric?<br/>
<br/>
-=- Perhaps we will just disagree on this one.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some of the hundreds of people who will read this before the weekend is out, <br/>
though, might decide what they believe on the basis of persuasive argument, so <br/>
it&#39;s still worth discussing.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; This is the hardest thing for me about unschooling.  Knowing when or <br/>
<br/>
if ever I can say no.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can say no all you want to.<br/>
When unschooling really gets into your heart and soul, you SHOULD be wanting <br/>
to say no less and less.  But that should be natural, not off a chart.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look at us when you decide, look compassionately at your child.  Look <br/>
inside at her feelings, her mood of the moment.  Is it an okay time for a no?  <br/>
Sometimes it is, sometimes it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And still wondering if I&#39;ll ever grasp how to master finding time for <br/>
<br/>
my own interests and work.  Just a few weeks ago someone (Julie?) <br/>
<br/>
said she has five kids and still does all this amazing (to me) amount <br/>
<br/>
of work with them around.  I&#39;m in awe, because I don&#39;t.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kids get older and they leave.  Life isn&#39;t homogenized.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is there something wrong that my kids want so much of me?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I doubt it!  Sounds like they just really LIKE you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Last week I went out for lunch with <br/>
<br/>
a friend and Alisha, who&#39;s almost 11, begged me not to go.  She would <br/>
<br/>
miss me too much.  Her dad was home with her, and they get along <br/>
<br/>
great. -=-<br/>
<br/>
In cases like that, when I knew Holly was antsy about me leaving, I would <br/>
help Keith arrange something really interesting for her so that staying home was <br/>
so fascinating she practically forgot I was leaving.  Most of her life she&#39;s <br/>
been okay with me leaving, but there were a few seasons where she just didn&#39;t <br/>
like the sight or feeling of seeing me leave.  I would really brightly and <br/>
smilingly say &quot;I&#39;ll be back at 3:30 or sooner!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah!  Another trick I&#39;ve used is instead of giving the closest estimate and <br/>
&quot;being late,&quot; I&#39;ll tack on a half an hour or an hour (depending how far away <br/>
I&#39;ll be) and then I show up early, and the kids feel special because I hurried <br/>
home, instead of cranky because I didn&#39;t get there when I said I would.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Dh and I sat down to eat, kind of <br/>
<br/>
tired, and as soon as I did, Luke said, &quot;Bring me my drink, Mommy&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
He had carried his plate in, sat down and got comfortable, and <br/>
<br/>
realized he had forgotten his drink.  I was tired.  I said, &quot;Honey, <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really tired.  Why don&#39;t you come get your drink.&quot;  He said no.  <br/>
<br/>
Dh said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s right here whenever you want it.&quot;  He asked in a <br/>
<br/>
whiny voice several more times and I was about to get up and get it <br/>
<br/>
for him but then he finally did come out and get it himself.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve gotten him the drink.  The reason I would have is that if he&#39;s not <br/>
old enough to cut up his own hot dog (or he needs it cut up) he&#39;s probably <br/>
not old enough to carry the hot dog AND a drink, so someone should&#39;ve helped him <br/>
get situated where he was going to eat.<br/>
<br/>
A hot dog needs a drink.  He&#39;s only been on the planet a short time, but both <br/>
the adults knew a hot dog needed a drink.   &quot;Kind of tired&quot; didn&#39;t change <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
So he ate, and he had his drink, but he also had the disappointment and <br/>
negativity that came from parents refusing to do him a little favor.<br/>
<br/>
I think he will refuse to do you a favor soon, or often.  You bought yourself <br/>
some backlash, I think.  And I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll even be aware of why he&#39;s <br/>
hesitant to help you.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Bring me my drink, Mommy&quot;.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Would it have helped you if he had said please?  Would you have been more <br/>
willing?<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t you and your husband feel a little less happy with your hamburgers, <br/>
having frustrated a kid who only wanted a drink?<br/>
<br/>
-=-In situations like that it&#39;s hard for me to know if I should just <br/>
<br/>
always breathe and put a smile on my face and get up and serve, no <br/>
<br/>
matter how tired I am, or can I sometimes say, &quot;I&#39;m tired honey, why <br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t you get it&quot;.  And if he still says no, you get it, do I then do <br/>
<br/>
it no matter what? -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why don&#39;t you get it&quot; might not be the best wording.<br/>
&quot;Could you get it?&quot;  That&#39;s an honest question.  &quot;Why don&#39;t you&quot; isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can&#39;t imagine getting lots of work or pursuing <br/>
<br/>
interesting things on my own without sometimes saying, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired <br/>
<br/>
or busy, you&#39;ll have to get it this time&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re really tired, you can&#39;t do work or pursue interesting things.<br/>
You might be tired of Barbie or pushing a kid on a swing, and that&#39;s fine.  <br/>
Kids get tired of doing the same thing too.  That&#39;s different from just plain <br/>
tired.<br/>
<br/>
-=-or &quot;No, we just played <br/>
<br/>
for 3 hours and now I need an hour to myself&quot;.  But does doing that <br/>
<br/>
make them feel unloved? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not after three hours.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe consider suggesting something really interesting they could do that <br/>
doesn&#39;t involve you so that they&#39;re not going from something neat to <br/>
something less neat, but from something they really liked (playing with you) to <br/>
something they like even more (whatever it might be; rent a new video, I don&#39;t know).<br/>

A mother with small children is the mother of small children.  She can either <br/>

and can&#39;t wait a few years.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
There is more than one point.<br/>
<br/>
If you are respectful of them, it makes you a better person.<br/>
If you are respectful of them, they build up a charge of being respected; <br/>
they know what it feels like, and they can pass it on.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t give what you don&#39;t have, and if children are not respected, they <br/>
can&#39;t be respectful in return.  But any mother who is expecting to get back <br/>
exactly what she give out to her children, and on some kind of equitable <br/>
schedule, and soon, is being unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
If you bring your children drinks for years, when you break your leg and <br/>
can&#39;t get to the kitchen for two months, they will be more likely to be sweet and <br/>
generous about bringing you drinks.  I know this from personal experience.    <br/>
If I took three kid drinks and said &quot;That&#39;s it; I&#39;ve done it three times and <br/>
you didn&#39;t bring me anything,&quot; you&#39;ve botched the whole deal.<br/>
<br/>
This is not time by the day, but time by the life.  a beloved, special child, <br/>
he will BE a beloved special child.<br/>
<br/>
If you treat him like an irritation who should get his own drink, he will <br/>
(even for a moment) BE an irritation who failed to get his own drink, who <br/>
misjudged whether to ask his mom for help, who failed.<br/>

&quot;How to Raise a Respected Child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t changed my mind about any of that.  I see parents want to have the <br/>
same result without the willingness to offer the same foundation.  Sorry to <br/>
quote myself, but: &quot;Neediness expresses itself differently with different kids. <br/>
Abundance expresses itself similarly in all. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
&quot;I would love to, but I&#39;m really tired and I&#39;m eating.  You can <br/>
either get it yourself, or I&#39;ll bring it when I&#39;ve finished.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I will in an hour -- right now I&#39;m _______.  Would you like to <br/>
watch?&quot;  (Or, &quot;I need to be alone while I do it, but let&#39;s set the <br/>
timer so you know when we&#39;ll play.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I begin, and then I do watch how the interaction goes.  <br/>
If it seems more important to the child that I do what they want <br/>
than it seems to me to do what I want, I do it.  If I really am just <br/>
too tired and getting grumpy, I let my son know that in a nice <br/>
way:  &quot;I&#39;m getting too grumpy to be with people right now, but in 20 <br/>
minutes I&#39;ll be up for it.  I want to be able to play with you when <br/>
I can enjoy it and be nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It models taking care of yourself in a way that nice and thoughtful <br/>
to others.  It shows that other people have needs, and that a lot of <br/>
interactions are about weighing those and seeing if everyone can get <br/>
something they need.<br/>
<br/>
For me, it&#39;s part of loving my children, because I do get snappy <br/>
when I&#39;m overwhelmed or tired, and I really don&#39;t want to do that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve said it before, but I make sure to take good care of my <br/>
children&#39;s mother.<br/>

I put in extra effort towards being attentive to my child this last week <br/>
instead of just collapsing in a heap.  Since he requested more time at <br/>
home, I came back from the park an hour earlier (despite the nasty <br/>
traffic), I made mac&#39;n&#39;cheese in addition to the adult meal, delivered <br/>
drinks to the living room and said &quot;yeah, sure&quot; to a strange dessert.  <br/>
In return I got a very happy child who sang me a song about being the <br/>
best mom ever.  (Absolutely true)  (That is, that he sang the song.  <br/>
It&#39;s really debatable whether I&#39;m the best mom ever. &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
These are all normally things that I do, at least some of the time, but <br/>
with encouragement from the list and with the extra pep from getting <br/>
home earlier I made a not-so-little boy really happy by going that extra <br/>
mile.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655821397">The situation described wasn&#39;t a kid being lazy, it was a kid who <br/>
hadn&#39;t planned ahead perfectly, had gotten comfy and then realized he&#39;d <br/>
forgotten his drink. That&#39;s not a &quot;bad habit&quot; - that&#39;s just being a <br/>
human. ANY of us could do the same thing. I&#39;ve I&#39;d settled into a comfy <br/>
position with my food and then realized I&#39;d forgotten to bring my <br/>
drink, I&#39;d look up to see if anybody was in a good position to hand it <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
We have a situation at our house that is new - in the late evenings <br/>
there are usually several of us sitting together in the living room, <br/>
with our laptops, playing a game, or watching something on tv.  <br/>
Recently, our dog has been wanting to go in and out the back door way <br/>
more often than she ever has before - I don&#39;t know what the problem is, <br/>
she goes out and wanders around and then wants back in and then out and <br/>
then in.... Anyway - we don&#39;t have a doggy door because we&#39;ve never <br/>
needed one, but now we&#39;re having to get up and down all the time. We <br/>
are all getting a little tired of it and I hope she&#39;ll just stop doing <br/>
it, soon. But I noticed something nice. We seem to just kind of <br/>
naturally share the chore of getting up - kind of taking turns in an <br/>
unspoken rotation. If the kids are busy and I&#39;m just reading email, I <br/>
usually do it - so I probably do it more than they do.  But it is WAY <br/>
harder for me to get up and down off the floor if we&#39;re sitting down <br/>
there playing a game and they don&#39;t even expect me to do it at all, in <br/>
that case. Nice of them. Thoughtful without even probably giving it <br/>
more than a moment&#39;s thought. These are 13, 16, and 19 year old kids.<br/>
<br/>
A little while ago, my husband settled down in his chair to watch a <br/>
soccer game on tv that he is very excited by (his favorite English <br/>
team, Arsenal, will break a 100+ year record if they win this game). As <br/>
soon as he settled in and got the game on and it started, he said, &quot;Oh <br/>
darn, I forgot to make my tea.&quot; (He&#39;d boiled the water but forgot to <br/>
make it and bring it with him to sit down.) Roxana, 16, was sitting on <br/>
the couch nearby, with her laptop. She jumped up and said, &quot;I&#39;ll get <br/>
it.&quot; She did that. Now 20 minutes later, he just wanted another cup of <br/>
tea. He looked around and saw Roxana and I both typing away on our <br/>
laptops and he didn&#39;t even ask, he just jumped up and went and got it <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard work and tiring to have young children. You DO have to watch <br/>
out for them and help them a lot. A parent could have kept an eye on <br/>
him getting his food and reminded him that he&#39;d forgotten his drink or <br/>
noticed when he settled down without it and gotten it for him before <br/>
they settled down with their own food. It takes effort and attention to <br/>
parent.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we don&#39;t have to be perfect and I don&#39;t want this to <br/>
sound like I have been perfect. I have many times not done something <br/>
for my kids that I could have done, just because I was a little tired <br/>
or doing something myself and didn&#39;t feel like it. I wish I could start <br/>
fresh - and do better. But it hasn&#39;t ruined my relationship with my <br/>
children or ruined their lives or anything like that. So the trick <br/>
seems to be to keep striving to do better and better and to give myself <br/>
a break when I am, inevitably, not perfect.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What if you still stick up for yourself but don&#39;t start with the &quot;n&quot; <br/>
<br/>
word? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a danger when parents consider saying no to their children (no matter <br/>
how it&#39;s phrased) as sticking up for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Any &quot;us and them&quot; thinking erodes the togetherness.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;I will in an hour -- right now I&#39;m _______.  Would you like to <br/>
<br/>
watch?&quot;  (Or, &quot;I need to be alone while I do it, but let&#39;s set the <br/>
<br/>
timer so you know when we&#39;ll play.&quot;)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Arbitrary, to my way of thinking, unless you want to watch a TV show or <br/>
something that really lasts an hour.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do agree with all this, -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how I begin, and then I do watch how the interaction goes.  <br/>
<br/>
If it seems more important to the child that I do what they want <br/>
<br/>
than it seems to me to do what I want, I do it.  If I really am just <br/>
<br/>
too tired and getting grumpy, I let my son know that in a nice <br/>
<br/>
way: -=-<br/>
<br/>
and I agree with your general premise, I&#39;m just picking at the details for <br/>
the benefit of people who are trying to come up with their own gameplans.<br/>
<br/>
Your children being on your team, they won&#39;t mind you taking a rest sometimes <br/>
(especially if you&#39;re really generous with them and their needs, which you <br/>
really seem to be!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290872184">&lt;&lt; My dh remembers constantly being ordered to fetch stuff (including<br/>
cocktails) for his parents, regardless of his current activity. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the last five years or so our morning ritual (especially in the winter)<br/>
has been for me to make the kids hot milos while they are all snuggling on<br/>
the couch watching their shows. A couple of months ago Jacob (my 7 yr old)<br/>
asked me to show him how to make them and also how to make tea and coffee.<br/>
Now if I look tired or I offer to make Mark a coffee he always jumps in and<br/>
asks if he can make me a cup of tea and get his dad&#39;s coffee. The nicest<br/>
thing about this is the big smile on his face when he brings it to you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097406817">This too is something I struggle with. My ds is 4,   I try to figure out<br/>
where my limits are and speak of them.  Not to get to NO for no good reason<br/>
which is what I see all around me.. We do so much and are out so much so<br/>
that when it there comes a time where I need something for myself I try to<br/>
honor that.  Sometimes I&#39;m too too tired to go out at 10 pm to get some<br/>
candy that he wants.  We&#39;ll discuss the options like creating something else<br/>
or eating what we&#39;ve got in the house. I&#39;ve noticed a trend these days that<br/>
he&#39;s accepting of my limits more.  In the afternoon sometimes I need to lie<br/>
down for about a 1/2 hr.  I crash.  It used to be a 5 sec lying down w/ a<br/>
pull on me to do something, then going back to lie down for and the whole<br/>
thing was like that for the 1/2 hr.  Then lying next to him while he watched<br/>
tv worked a bit better.<br/>
<br/>
I think if we never brought up our needs our kids wouldn&#39;t get a chance to<br/>
see us as whole human beings all interacting in this creation that is our<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
I think letting him know that I do have limits is a good thing and that I<br/>
take care of myself also a good thing.  I try to let him know when I&#39;m<br/>
heading towards burnout and why.  I also think hanging out with him while he<br/>
goes through the disappointment of my not doing what he&#39;s wanting is<br/>
helpful. Not being resentful and instead being understanding of his<br/>
disappointments helps move us along.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s something I think a lot about.  I don&#39;t have boundless energy and<br/>
sometimes feel guilty that I don&#39;t but that&#39;s what we got to deal with so<br/>
I&#39;ve got to find more creative ways to engage when I&#39;m in that down time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to hear how others deal w/ this.<br/>

make sure they get taken care of.<br/>

Subject: [UnschoolingDiscussion] Re: &quot;a taste of his own medicine&quot; andother<br/>
cruel ideas<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; &quot;it is almost like giving an unschooling recipe:<br/>
&gt; Like Step 1. Make as many different breakfasts as the people in your<br/>
&gt; house<br/>
&gt; want.<br/>
&gt; Step 2. Don&#39;t say &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Step 3. Say.....&lt;whatever&gt;.<br/>
&gt; It seems legalistic. Just as unschooling looks different in every<br/>
&gt; home but<br/>
&gt; follows the same basic guidelines of trust and acceptance, gentle<br/>
&gt; parenting<br/>
&gt; looks different as well but follows the same basic guidelines of love<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; respect being a 2 way street.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is the hardest thing for me about unschooling.  Knowing when or<br/>
&gt; if ever I can say no.  Knowing where the line is between my personal<br/>
&gt; boundaries and making sure my kids are emotionally whole and feel<br/>
&gt; loved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And still wondering if I&#39;ll ever grasp how to master finding time for<br/>
&gt; my own interests and work.  Just a few weeks ago someone (Julie?)<br/>
&gt; said she has five kids and still does all this amazing (to me) amount<br/>
&gt; of work with them around.  I&#39;m in awe, because I don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; An example...<br/>
&gt; Today one of Alisha&#39;s friends was having a yard sale, so we went and<br/>
&gt; visited their sale.  Then we went to a few other yard sales and found<br/>
&gt; some neat stuff.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Luke had to go to the bathroom on the way home, so we stopped at a<br/>
&gt; grocery store (closest bathroom).  When we walked past the salad bar,<br/>
&gt; he wanted some things off of it, so I let him fill up a container.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The boys hadn&#39;t wanted to go to yard sales, so I convinced them by<br/>
&gt; telling them we could stop and get milkshakes afterwards, so we<br/>
&gt; stopped for milkshakes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At one of the sales Alisha and I found some new yugioh cards, so<br/>
&gt; Alisha asked me to play yugioh with her when we got home.  She set<br/>
&gt; the cards up while I hung a load of laundry outside.  I took a break<br/>
&gt; at one point to make english muffins, pour drinks, and go see<br/>
&gt; something that the boys had made outside.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After playing several games, Alisha and I looked up some stuff about<br/>
&gt; yugioh online.  Then I started making supper, but dh had to finish<br/>
&gt; that because Matt shut the door on his toe and needed my attention.<br/>
&gt; I bandaided him up and it still hurt and he needed me to sit and hold<br/>
&gt; him for awhile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After supper I looked something up online for Matt.  He really liked<br/>
&gt; something that he bought at the yardsale and wanted to know if he<br/>
&gt; could buy something similar somewhere.  Then Alisha asked me to play<br/>
&gt; yugioh some more.  I asked if she could clear the table while I got<br/>
&gt; the laundry in off the line, and she did.  We played 2 more games and<br/>
&gt; then spent awhile looking through all the cards not in our decks and<br/>
&gt; deciding what we could part with.  She wants to have a yard sale now<br/>
&gt; too, and wants to sell her extra yugioh cards there.  As we were<br/>
&gt; looking through the cards, something sparked a question she&#39;d<br/>
&gt; wondered about from seeing it on her video game.  She asked what<br/>
&gt; pyro, hydro, aero, and geo meant.  I knew what they meant and told<br/>
&gt; her, but looked up geo in the dictionary to make sure I was right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I made a 5 minute phone call to discuss with a friend plans for some<br/>
&gt; clubs Alisha wants to get involved in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I took a shower and then lay, read, and sang with Alisha and then<br/>
&gt; Matt on their beds before they went to sleep.  (Luke went to bed with<br/>
&gt; dh).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I came down, ran the dishwasher, did a load of dishes by hand.  Now<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m up too late finding time for myself online.  I&#39;ll probably throw<br/>
&gt; in a load of laundry before bed so it&#39;s ready to get hung up in the<br/>
&gt; morning, and I&#39;d like to read some of my book but will probably fall<br/>
&gt; asleep after 1 or 2 pages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m NOT complaining about being home with and spending lots of time<br/>
&gt; with my kids.  Really!  I just wonder if there&#39;s something I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not &quot;getting&quot;.  I&#39;ve been reading about moms getting lots of work<br/>
&gt; done even with 5 kids in the house and how moms should pursue<br/>
&gt; interests on their own.  When I do really need to get work done or<br/>
&gt; pursue an interest for myself it usually involves telling a kid no.<br/>
&gt; I might have time in a few hours, or maybe tomorrow, but not now.<br/>
&gt; Then they&#39;re sad and I feel bad. Last week I went out for lunch with<br/>
&gt; a friend and Alisha, who&#39;s almost 11, begged me not to go.  She would<br/>
&gt; miss me too much.  Her dad was home with her, and they get along<br/>
&gt; great. Yet some of you go to work...don&#39;t your kids ask you not to<br/>
&gt; ever leave them?   The only work I got done today was 2 loads of<br/>
&gt; laundry and food prep.  I did the dishes after everyone else was<br/>
&gt; asleep.  Is that bad?  Should I be able to get more done when my kids<br/>
&gt; are around?  They ask me to do stuff with them constantly.  Not that<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t ever do stuff on their own, but usually what happens is<br/>
&gt; that while one child is off doing something on his own, a different<br/>
&gt; child wants my attention.  Usually I&#39;m doing something with someone.<br/>
&gt; Is there something wrong that my kids want so much of me?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m very concerned about doing it all &quot;right&quot;.  I want my kids to be<br/>
&gt; emotionally whole and healthy and feeling very loved by their mom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Back to the &quot;I&#39;m not a short order cook&quot; theme...  IS there ever a<br/>
&gt; time when you can say, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired, I can&#39;t get that right now?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Example...All day long I got Luke everything he wanted to eat and<br/>
&gt; drink.  No problem. For supper, I made hamburgers which I knew he<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t want, so I made hot dogs too.  Dh cut the hot dog up for<br/>
&gt; him, I got him ketchup on his plate, got him a fork.  Poured him a<br/>
&gt; drink.  He wanted to take his plate to the couch (a few feet from the<br/>
&gt; table to watch tv), so he did.  Dh and I sat down to eat, kind of<br/>
&gt; tired, and as soon as I did, Luke said, &quot;Bring me my drink, Mommy&quot;.<br/>
&gt; He had carried his plate in, sat down and got comfortable, and<br/>
&gt; realized he had forgotten his drink.  I was tired.  I said, &quot;Honey,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m really tired.  Why don&#39;t you come get your drink.&quot;  He said no.<br/>
&gt; Dh said, &quot;Well, it&#39;s right here whenever you want it.&quot;  He asked in a<br/>
&gt; whiny voice several more times and I was about to get up and get it<br/>
&gt; for him but then he finally did come out and get it himself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In situations like that it&#39;s hard for me to know if I should just<br/>
&gt; always breathe and put a smile on my face and get up and serve, no<br/>
&gt; matter how tired I am, or can I sometimes say, &quot;I&#39;m tired honey, why<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t you get it&quot;.  And if he still says no, you get it, do I then do<br/>
&gt; it no matter what?  I can&#39;t imagine getting lots of work or pursuing<br/>
&gt; interesting things on my own without sometimes saying, &quot;No, I&#39;m tired<br/>
&gt; or busy, you&#39;ll have to get it this time&quot;.  or &quot;No, we just played<br/>
&gt; for 3 hours and now I need an hour to myself&quot;.  But does doing that<br/>
&gt; make them feel unloved?  Shouldn&#39;t I always meet their needs first<br/>
&gt; and THEN meet my needs if there&#39;s ever any time left over?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Be thoughtful and aware of your children as individuals.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Decide what your priorities are.  Children over house?  Learning over<br/>
&gt; schedule?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Be mindful, not kneejerk.  Don&#39;t try to use old methods for new<br/>
purposes.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just made those up now. &lt;g&gt;  But they&#39;re the kinds of PRINCIPLES (not<br/>
&gt; rules) that are discussed all the time in unschooling discussions.<br/>

&gt; Really?  I&#39;m repeating myself like a little telephone tape and somehow<br/>
what<br/>

and<br/>
&gt; Joyce tried, I think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are some phrases which don&#39;t exist in ANY conversations except those<br/>
&gt; which put down children, which treat them as second-class humans to be<br/>
scoffed<br/>
&gt; at and abused.  One of those phrases is &quot;I&#39;m not a short-order cook.&quot;<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; are several other phrases like that.  If a parent is using those phrases,<br/>
it is<br/>
&gt; indicative that the parent is working from super-ego voices, not from her<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; voice.  She is having throw-back to other people and situations and<br/>
attitudes,<br/>
&gt; not dealing directly with her own child in that moment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A person who is quoting parents or grandparents for purposes of thwarting<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; child is not living in the unschooling moment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-I agree that throwing a cliche out may not be the best approach to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; parenting. It probably is worth examining.   But just because it is a<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; cliche, perhaps even one that people have used as a put down doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; automatically make it taboo.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay.  There it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why should a parent not try to rid their mind and soul of put-down<br/>
cliches?<br/>
&gt; Why should a parent not be willing to encourage other unschoolers to<br/>
cleanse<br/>
&gt; themselves of anti-child rhetoric?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; though, might decide what they believe on the basis of persuasive<br/>
argument, so<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s still worth discussing.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Perhaps this is the problem.  I HAVE heard this phrase is conversations<br/>
<br/>
which had absolutely nothing to do with chirldren.  It wasn&#39;t used in a<br/>
<br/>
hurtful way but in a rather playful, laughing way to get a point across<br/>
<br/>
between adults.<br/>
<br/>

conversation (and more than once, you said &#39;conversations&#39;) when it wasn&#39;t to <br/>
or about children?  What point were the adults trying to get across to one <br/>
another?<br/>
<br/>
I have never, ever heard or read that phrase when it wasn&#39;t intended to tell <br/>
someone that you were not going to do what they unreasonably wanted, because <br/>
you had some status they didn&#39;t have.   Please, if I&#39;m wrong show me.  If I&#39;m <br/>
right, say uncle and stop defending it.<br/>
