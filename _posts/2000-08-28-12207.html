<div id="ygrps-yiv-735830197">I am new to this site. I have a 10 year old and 13 year old and am curious <br/>
about what you all think, unschooling-wise, about: 1)SET TIMES FOR BED vs. <br/>
ANYTIME IS OKAY...same with rising time. 2)Use of the computer/internet: <br/>
SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT? 3)Last year, we homeschooled with a curriculum from <br/>
Oak Meadow. We did the Saxon Math lessons everyday...after lots of coercing. <br/>
They both learned alot inspite of resistance. Now we are unschooling (again) <br/>
and I am having trouble just LETTING GO of math...I doubt that they are ever <br/>
going to choose to do it on their own...the stuff they were learning, we <br/>
will probably never come across naturally (multiplying fractions, algebra, <br/>
etc.)so, what happens if they want to take an SAT test later; I guess they <br/>
just have to &quot;knuckle down&quot; and learn lots of math all at once THEN? I think <br/>
I need a pep talk...<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; I got tired of<br/>
&gt;  switching them and started using my right hand for the mouse or I<br/>
&gt;  would use my lefthand and had to remember not to use my index finger<br/>
&gt;  to click with. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;OH MY!  I just realized that whenever my dd does play on the computer we <br/>
&gt;make<br/>
&gt;her use the mouse just as it is!!  I NEVER thought about changing the<br/>
&gt;buttons!!  Wow, I guess I&#39;ll have to change the mouse and see if there is a<br/>
&gt;difference?!  DD does eat, write, and do MOST tasks with her left hand but<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve noticed she throw with her right hand (quite well) and I guess she <br/>
&gt;also<br/>
&gt;uses the mouse with her right -- I&#39;ll have to let you know what happens if<br/>
&gt;she uses the left with the mouse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Again, thanks to all who are responding -- the more I read and listen to <br/>
&gt;all<br/>
&gt;of you the more confident I am becoming about the hschooling endeavor.  I <br/>
&gt;am<br/>
&gt;looking into a support group in my area (DE).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Carron, on the behavior issues -- so far so good!  I guess I have been <br/>
&gt;doing<br/>
&gt;the Love and Logic thing *correctly* but I am guessing it is just going to<br/>
&gt;take some time.  I only started implementing the whole L&L ideas in January<br/>
&gt;of this year.  Also, late that same month my ds was born so we were ALL<br/>
&gt;adjusting to life with a newborn.  I&#39;ll keep up the choices and <br/>
&gt;implementing<br/>
&gt;my own if she doesn&#39;t make a choice.  Now, I just have to work on REALLY<br/>
&gt;keeping my voice calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a screamer and <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;think I REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)  Also, the Library thinks <br/>
&gt;they<br/>
&gt;may have the book which they got from the interlibrary loan service -- a<br/>
&gt;local college apparently has or will have several copies of the Toddler <br/>
&gt;book<br/>
&gt;you referred to -- I am really looking forward to reading it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks for the support and advice!<br/>

&gt;yes, I do make the choice after a couple of times...I don&#39;t think she has<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;LOL.  Were you a debater in school?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My husband observed after the last unschooling conference that we went to<br/>
&gt;that homeschooling, the research into it, the websites, the books, the<br/>
&gt;conferences, the support groups, are overwhelmingly feminine in nature.<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s completely understandable since moms are the primary homeschoolers.<br/>
&gt;He sees in talking with other hs dads, that there is often the attitude <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;homeschooling is the mom&#39;s job, and that the dad may have some concerns <br/>
&gt;about<br/>
&gt;it, but if she&#39;s willing to commit to it, he&#39;s willing to &quot;give it a try&quot;.<br/>
&gt;But, they often take a wait and see attitude.  Then, as time progresses, <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;the dad sees that the children and mom are happy, productive people, that <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;kids are learning and they won&#39;t be social misfits, he &quot;comes around&quot; and<br/>
&gt;becomes an advocate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This happened with my husband, too.  But wouldn&#39;t it be so much more<br/>
&gt;productive if we could bring these guys around sooner?  We could save so <br/>
&gt;much<br/>
&gt;emotional energy if we didn&#39;t have to deal with our job--homeschooling--and<br/>
&gt;with our partner&#39;s doubts, too.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Wow, Michelle, that turns everybody upside down!  It is so hard dealing <br/>
&gt;with<br/>
&gt;a new baby and your other child&#39;s behavioral issues at the same time!<br/>
&gt;Especially when I bet a lot of those behaviors are a direct result of <br/>
&gt;having<br/>
&gt;the new baby in the house.  I promise things will get better.  But it will<br/>
&gt;take time and consistency.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Now, I just have to work on REALLY<br/>
&gt; &gt;  keeping my voice calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a screamer <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  think I REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;That&#39;s my biggest problem, too.  I really have to pay attention to my <br/>
&gt;voice,<br/>
&gt;even now.  There are still times when my son tries my patience -- that will<br/>
&gt;never go away, I&#39;m sure -- but it has gotten easier.   Even if a calm voice<br/>
&gt;is not second nature, I&#39;ve tried to make it a habit to stop and think <br/>
&gt;before<br/>
&gt;I say anything (the old count to 10 trick).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Also, the Library thinks they<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Thanks for the support and advice!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You&#39;re welcome.  I really believe in Love and Logic, and I know that with<br/>
&gt;consistency, it works.  You guys are going through a really trying time,<br/>
&gt;right now.  But, as the bible says, this too shall pass.  If you have any<br/>
&gt;questions or problems, I can give you some ideas to try.  Just let me know.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Here is a description by Michelle Malkin in the St. Louis<br/>
&gt; &gt; Post-Dispatch: Death Row Marv is &quot;a half-foot-tall replica<br/>
&gt; &gt; of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; violent character created by surly graphic artist Frank<br/>
&gt; &gt; Miller.... He comes with &quot;the chair, wired helmet,<br/>

&gt; &gt; and electrocuting switch.&quot; For $23.95, you, too, can<br/>
&gt; &gt; purchase<br/>
&gt; &gt; the &quot;deluxe box set&quot; and share the cheap thrill of<br/>
&gt; &gt; executing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; murderer: &quot;Feel the burn as the electric buzz fills the<br/>

&gt; &gt; Death Row<br/>
&gt; &gt; Marv beckons. &quot;Experience the pain as the shaking<br/>
&gt; &gt; continues and<br/>
&gt; &gt; his eyes start to glow bright red. Enjoy the torment as he<br/>
&gt; &gt; utters his famous last words, &#39;Is that the best you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; do, you<br/>

&gt; &gt; Death Row Marv is unbelievably vulgar and gross.  It<br/>

&gt; &gt; Carron, on the behavior issues -- so far so good!  I guess I have<br/>
&gt;been doing  the Love and Logic thing *correctly* but I am guessing it<br/>
&gt;is just going to  take some time.  I only started implementing the<br/>
&gt;whole L&L ideas in January  of this year.  Also, late that same month<br/>
&gt;my ds was born so we were ALL  adjusting to life with a newborn.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll keep up the choices and implementing my own if she doesn&#39;t make<br/>
&gt;a choice.  Now, I just have to work on REALLY keeping my voice<br/>
&gt;calm!!!  (Not my strong point!  My mom was a screamer and I think I<br/>
&gt;REALLY have it in me to be one tooo!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I can relate REALLY well to this. I naturally have a loud voice since<br/>
&gt;birth. I was a screamer as an infant. I was so loud that people would<br/>
&gt;move away from my parents when they sat down at church. I am also the<br/>
&gt;second of six children. It got pretty loud around the house with so<br/>
&gt;many kids. It has taken me most of my adult life to hear that I am<br/>
&gt;talking louder than everyone else. Now that I have kids, I realize<br/>
&gt;that when I am frustrated my volum rises, again. I have learned that<br/>
&gt;keeping the radio and t.v. down or off helps a lot. I have also<br/>
&gt;learned that when I am REALLY upset with the children to use a softer<br/>
&gt;calmer voice. You can almost tell how irritated I am by how calm and<br/>
&gt;controled my voice is. It is when things are calm around here that I<br/>
&gt;tend to lose control of my volum. I am still working on the control<br/>
&gt;in those frustrating times though. Think I always will. Corallyn<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: Re: Rebellion (was Pink Hair)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;my dh became an adamant<br/>
&gt; &gt;unschooler.  Something clicked.  He came away telling me that kids<br/>
&gt; &gt;shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;even think about academics until they&#39;re twelve, that the body of <br/>
&gt;knowledge<br/>
&gt; &gt;is changing so rapidly we can&#39;t possibly to hope to learn what we need to<br/>
&gt; &gt;know in school or even homeschooling with a curriculum, that our kids <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt; &gt;learn what they need to when they need to -- period!.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Your husband has de-schooled. Isn&#39;t it great how it works! When I started<br/>
&gt;out I had all these wonderful plans for unit studies that I thought would <br/>
&gt;be<br/>
&gt;fun, and interesting, and could incorporate all the usual school subjects<br/>
&gt;into one topic. It didn&#39;t take me long to find out that what sounded fun <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;interesting to me might sound dumb and boring to the kids. Or, more likely,<br/>
&gt;it would appeal to one kid, but not the others. So, after a few months of<br/>
&gt;trying to force people to participate in all my carefully planned fun, I<br/>
&gt;began my own de-schooling too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now, though, after two years, it seems that the kids would like to do some<br/>
&gt;of the things that I threw out. Now that they are truly free to learn what<br/>
&gt;they want, they do want to learn. Now they will put the effort into it, and<br/>
&gt;seem to be able to appreciate each others contributions and interests. So,<br/>
&gt;we may do a unit. This time, however, it won&#39;t be me planning it all out <br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;telling them what they are to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;School starts in our district tomorrow. We traditionally have breakfast in<br/>
&gt;our garden and watch the bus pass by. We celebrate our freedom and do a<br/>
&gt;little thinking and talking about where we want to go with school this year<br/>
&gt;and what we would like to do. When they went to school I always video taped<br/>
&gt;them on this day, getting on the bus, and then telling me how the first day<br/>
&gt;went. That tape was a big motivator in the decision to pull them out of<br/>
&gt;school when I looked back at the changes over the years-from a wonderful<br/>
&gt;family that you would love to know, to a bunch of rude brats interrupting<br/>
&gt;each other. Maybe I will tape again tomorrow to see what a difference there<br/>
&gt;is now.<br/>

&gt;  ANYTIME IS OKAY...same with rising time. 2)Use of the computer/internet: <br/>
&gt;  SHOULD THERE BE A LIMIT? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the needs of the family and the child(ren), IMO.  One of our main <br/>
reasons to stay away from the ps thing is to have more control over our <br/>
personal lives and better time to spend together as a family.  In our family, <br/>
we all live by Dad&#39;s schedule because he is the one with a schedule set by <br/>
outside influences (work).  DH has worked rotating shift work most of our <br/>
lives.  When he&#39;s on a night shift he would totally miss any family time if <br/>
we stick to a strict bedtime routine, especially when he works a swing shift. <br/>
 Our ps routine for swing shift WAS:  Dad comes home from work after <br/>
midnight, sleeps until 9 or 10, by which time children have gone off to <br/>
school; dad would go to work just before children return from school and <br/>
children were in bed before dad returned from work.  YUCK!  (Just one of the <br/>
many reasons we homeschool!)  Now, we all shift schedules according to Dad&#39;s <br/>
work schedule.  (although it is a little hard for the family to do the <br/>
midnight to 7 a.m. routine, so we compromise as needed!)<br/>
<br/>
I also think it depends on the needs of the child.  We have health problems <br/>
in our family which are exacerbated by disrupted sleep routines.  So, when <br/>
someone is in a health flare, it becomes important that there be some routine <br/>
to encourage good sleep patterns.  Also, I can&#39;t sleep knowing there are <br/>
children up and about.  It&#39;s more a matter of wanting to be there/be involved <br/>
with them than lack of trust.  Since I&#39;m most often the one with health <br/>
problems, my sleep needs take precedent over kid&#39;s schedule.  OTOH if someone <br/>
else has a bigger/stronger need, we adjust.<br/>
<br/>
The family time is most important to us.  We don&#39;t really care when the <br/>
family sleeps, but we have better quality of life and family time if we are <br/>
all on a similar schedule.  Our friends and extended family have learned to <br/>
not call at 8 a.m. and that they may catch us napping mid-afternoon, and I&#39;ve <br/>
learned to turn the phone off until I&#39;m up in the morning!  They&#39;ve also <br/>
learned that if they need to talk to someone at 2 a.m., the odds are really <br/>
good that I&#39;m up.  <br/>
<br/>
It is my opinion that, as the parent, I have the responsibility to monitor <br/>
the health conditions of my children and insist on a bedtime that is best for <br/>
the individual and the family, as needed.  I would definitely not be <br/>
comfortable having kids up until who knows when.  Having people up and about <br/>
during sleep hours is not much of an issue because, regardless of which <br/>
schedule we are currently on, we have a bedtime routine which includes <br/>
reading, cuddling, family time and tucking in kidlet who is about to turn 12, <br/>
but not about to give up that routine(!).  <br/>
<br/>
If someone has a hard time going to sleep at the designated hour, we <br/>
encourage reading or other quiet activity.  Especially when we are having to <br/>
switch from one schedule to another.  (I would probably be a family bed <br/>
spokesperson if everyone else&#39;s snoring didn&#39;t keep me awake.  But that&#39;s <br/>
almost a different topic.)<br/>
<br/>
This has probably not been an answer that&#39;s helpful for you, except to point <br/>
out that the needs of each family differ.  (What a long-winded way to say: Do <br/>
what is best for you and your family.  &lt;bg&gt; )<br/>
<br/>
As for limiting usage of computer/internet (or computer games).  Again, it <br/>
depends.  I&#39;m protective of where on the net my children go, so we use AOL&#39;s <br/>
filter and also ask children to let us know when they are on the internet.  <br/>
Plus, I hang out with them enough that it is not difficult for me to steer <br/>
them a different direction if I don&#39;t like where they are.<br/>
<br/>
I have found we sometimes need to limit the time on the computer or using <br/>
video games due to general crabbiness.  IMO, too much time in front of any <br/>
electronic media has the same effect as too much time in front of TV or <br/>
stuffed behind a school desk...brain wave coma.  (Quickly recognizable by the <br/>
loss of ability to hear mom&#39;s voice and the vacant stares when you actually <br/>
get them to look your way!  LOL)  We don&#39;t have fast rules about how much is <br/>
too much, but watch our children&#39;s behavior and let that be our guide.<br/>
<br/>
As for math, we still use Saxon.  I love math and have no trouble getting DS <br/>
to be enthusiastic about the subject.  We love the scientific aspects of it <br/>
and multiplying fractions is just the sort of topic our brain waves enjoy.  <br/>
(sometimes comes in handy for solving video or puzzle game problems, too.)<br/>
<br/>
When it&#39;s time for SAT&#39;s or college placement tests, they&#39;ll either learn the <br/>
subject quickly in order to move on and meet their goal, or they&#39;ll take <br/>
remedial classes/find a tutor to get what they need when they need it.  So, <br/>
either method works.  We use a hybrid:  Use a textbook, but without strictly <br/>
following the outline/schedule and look for opportunities to explore math <br/>
concepts in daily living. <br/>
<br/>
If it helps any, I have 2 child-units.  One is an adult now.  We unschooled <br/>
pretty thoroughly from about age 15 on (read:  could NOT get the kid to do <br/>
any &#39;school&#39; work and eventually gave up with the theory that saving our <br/>
relationship with him was more important than cramming the &#39;necessary&#39; school <br/>
work into his rebellious brain!)  The stinker went on to take his GED after 5 <br/>
years of no formal school work, refused to study with a GED study guide or <br/>
look at any text books in order to prepare for the test, passed the GED test <br/>
with flying colors the first try, has taken college courses, started his own <br/>
family and has since gone on to become an electrician apprenticeship.  I <br/>
count that as success.<br/>
<br/>
He learned what he needed when he was ready for it.  Waiting only helped him <br/>
to be more ready for it.  I learned to relax the hard way!  We do things much <br/>
differently for the younger son.  (That&#39;s the cool thing about 10 years <br/>
between kids, there is lots of time to analyze parenting decisions and learn <br/>
for the second son.)  Luckily for us, the older one is so stubborn.  &lt;bg&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Linda --<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has their own take on these things but here&#39;s my 2 cents:<br/>
<br/>
(1) Bedtime -- ??  Whatever works.  I have read a lot lately about teens <br/>
needing lots and lots and lots of sleep, tho.  So, maybe that&#39;s an important <br/>
factor in your house.  Not mine yet (7 yo and 5 1/2 yo) but we sleep when <br/>
we&#39;re tired.  Not to be flip, I have just never figured out how to tell a <br/>
person (even myself), &quot;OK, it&#39;s 9:00 -- sleep.&quot;  Altho, I personally, can <br/>
sleep at the drop of a hat!  No help here!!<br/>
<br/>
(2) Computer limits -- what we do -- Mom hogs the computer.  Seriously, I <br/>
have been doing some things lately and have not been sharing well.  But <br/>
generally we take turns and are so busy doing lots of things that we haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten into too many hours of computer time.  It&#39;s probably more of a problem <br/>
with teens tho.  But I do know it goes in spurts - a new game or website = <br/>
hours of fun (and learning too but don&#39;t tell the kids).  Of course, they&#39;re <br/>
completely supervised on the Net --all that.<br/>
<br/>
(3)  Math -- Do what you want.  My son is taking a math course on line and <br/>
also does all sorts of reading and games and blackboard time and 5 1/2 yo <br/>
daughter is at the playing lots of games and learning to write the letters <br/>
and add & subtract stage.  We have some workbooks sitting around.  But for <br/>
the more advanced stuff especially, what&#39;s wrong with a course.  Maybe you <br/>
just haven&#39;t found one the kids click with.  They are old enough -- perhaps <br/>
they could help you select the right one for them.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, good luck with everything.  <br/>

<br/>
Welcome. I&#39;m Amy unschooling mom to 3 girls. We do not have enforced<br/>
bedtimes for 2 reasons. 1) I think part fo the beauty of unschooling is that<br/>
the kids are not limited to class time. My daughter is a night owl by<br/>
nature. She does most of her best learning and is at her sharpest at 11 at<br/>
night. 2) my dh holds odd hours at work and as someone else said, if we<br/>
stuck to traditional hours we&#39;d never see him. I can&#39;t really answer the<br/>
computer question, because my kids have no interest in it. I&#39;d like to see<br/>
them use it more. As far as math goes, I do use workbooks, but try not to<br/>
enforce it too much. That way I feel like they still have some say in the<br/>
matter. Hope that helps.<br/>

dance classes at a local community college here in Dallas.  Since she had not <br/>
taken a college entrance exam, she had to take a similar test administered by <br/>
the community college system.  It included Algebra.  That was the only thing <br/>
she felt unsure about as she had never bothered with it before  She sat down <br/>
with an algebra textbook, and learned the entire course in 17 days.  She took <br/>
the test and did just fine.  <br/>
