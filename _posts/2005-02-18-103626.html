<div id="ygrps-yiv-606540095">Kirby dropped his English class and didn&#39;t feel bad about it at all.  I told the tale to a friend who was the chairman of the English department at UNM for years.  He asked whether Kirby had taken college placement tests, and it led to that story.  He was appalled. He stepped back and let his mouth drop open.  Had it been a few years back, and had that woman been teaching in his department, I would&#39;t have been able to finish the story.  He&#39;d&#39;ve been over at her office and all over her.   He said &quot;I haven&#39;t heard of grading like that since the 1930&#39;s.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But on a brighter note, when four weeks were gone, Kirby had a B in the math class.  The other one isn&#39;t a graded situation (the college success class) but he loves it.  They talk about deciding how much value an activity will have to them, and how much time to invest in it.  &quot;Is this a piano?&quot; was one of the principles.  He said they said some things just aren&#39;t a piano.  I was puzzled at first, but he said if you&#39;ve worked for an hour and gotten 90% of what you need to do, is it worth another hour to get the remaining 10% of improvement?   Sometimes yes, sometimes no.  <br/>
<br/>
As a lifelong perfectionist, I immediately see it as sloth. &lt;bwg&gt;  And yet I play Neopets every day instead of writing a book.  Could I do 90% of the book I envision?  Apparently not. &lt;g&gt;  But Kirby is pretty easily happy with 90% already, and now someone has reinforced that, which I think is pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
And the other day they did a(nother) learning styles profile and Kirby was shown to be someone who learns musically.  He said his response to that was &quot;Schoolhouse Rock rocks!&quot; (and showed me with gestures)<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
No English 101 on the table at the moment<br/>
B thusfar in math 99<br/>
happy-happy in College Success<br/>
<br/>
Said he&#39;d like to go some more in fall, but will only take things that won&#39;t be harshly affected by taking time off to go to the Live & Learn conference.<br/>

My kids have a piggy bank that dh says is their college fund.   It will probably hold about $100 by the time it&#39;s full.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always figured it makes more sense to be home with my kids now and get a job when they go to college, if they go.  So we don&#39;t have much extra funds right now.<br/>
<br/>
I got through college myself with loans, scholarships, and working while attending.  My parents helped me out a little by giving me cash here and there.<br/>
<br/>
If I did have enough money to put away specifically for my kids future, I don&#39;t think I would designate it &quot;college fund&quot;.  At this point, I have no idea what my children will need when they are 18 to 22.<br/>
<br/>
OTH, people should probably consult a financial expert to decide how best to invest extra income now, for the future.  I know my state offers some kind of college savings that allows children to attend the state colleges later by their parents investing what it costs now.  I&#39;ve not looked into the details.  What would happen to the money if the child decided not to go?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1764442880">if this partially came before, ugh....i apologize...<br/>
I am having troubles with things sending or disappearing<br/>
on me!  <br/>
<br/>
I have had the same thoughts too, about who knows what <br/>
the kids will want as they get older.  One thought dh<br/>
has had to combat(hah) my argument is if we have a fund<br/>
designated to them, and one wants to open a business instead<br/>
of go to school, that they could have the $$ for that.<br/>
Who knows, we will see.  We are paying off student loans<br/>
still in this house, so we&#39;re not looking at saving yet.<br/>
I think a designated college fund can grow tax free though,<br/>
and if it&#39;s not used for college you just pay ? penalties<br/>
on it.  Not sure though, that&#39;s dh&#39;s area if interest.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The way financial aid works, it can hurt you to save up. Depends on <br/>
your income level. If your income level is middle to high - then you <br/>
won&#39;t qualify for financial aid anyway, and you may need the savings. <br/>
If your income is low, then the savings will increase the amount your <br/>
family is expected to pay toward college expenses.<br/>

A weird thing happened this year.  This is the first year we had  planned to <br/>
use any of the e-bonds (savings bonds tax free if you use them for  education) <br/>
but this year because I got a settlement from the insurance company  of the <br/>
hotel where I broke my leg, that added enough to our income that we would  have <br/>
had to pay taxes on the bonds had we cashed any anyway.   Other  years it <br/>
won&#39;t matter.  So for people with high incomes ordinarily, no  matter what their <br/>
expenses are, the tax advantage might fade away with those  bonds.  When we <br/>
first bought some we were quite poor.  <br/>
 <br/>
One good thing about those I didn&#39;t know when we first got them is that it  <br/>
could be me or Keith using them on education, too.  So if I talk all my  kids <br/>
out of wanting any college, I can go back and get a master&#39;s in a few  years.  <br/>
(JOKING...  mostly.)<br/>

Yeah, and it can also hurt you if you have two parents living apart,  because <br/>
they will consider the income of both.  My oldest son got ripped  off one <br/>
year.  The government claimed he was still dependent on his father,  but he <br/>
actually had leased an apartment in May of that year, and gotten MARRIED  in June.<br/>
 <br/>
Student loans are considered a good investment--low interest, deferred  <br/>
payments--AND you&#39;re investing in something that will only improve with  age; <br/>
yourself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905031793">Congratulations to Kirby thus far!<br/>
<br/>
When my oldest ds was trying to decide what to do the summer before starting <br/>
4-yr. college (after community college), he wanted to work at a camp that <br/>
paid almost nothing, but thought that he probably should get a better-paying <br/>
job and save up for college.  We looked into the whole financial aid thing <br/>
and found out that he would Lose money by working the regular job.  So he <br/>
was a camp counselor, had a blast, and came out better off financially!<br/>
<br/>
The system is wacky, and people need to check out the different aspects of <br/>
it, especially if the family is poor (like us, with one income and  a lot of <br/>
children!) and will be trying to get financial aid.  The really bad thing is <br/>
that if a student works for more money, everything is based on gross income, <br/>
and fin.aid is cut by that amount, but of course you don&#39;t ever have that <br/>
much in hand.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe not, the FASA form we fill out doesn&#39;t ask how much you have in  <br/>
savings, just proof of income currently for all adult members.  <br/>
 <br/>
One thing I&#39;ve found out through experience that no one really said, is  that <br/>
PRIVATE college might be the way to go if you don&#39;t qualify for financial  <br/>
aid.  They have tons of money that is not bound by federal regulations  about <br/>
income to give away.  You need not always be an A student or a  athlete to get <br/>
this funds.  Always talk to the financial aid officer, even  after you get your <br/>
award letter, there is almost always extra money lingering  around and they <br/>
decide who it goes to.<br/>
 <br/>
My oldest went to a private college in NC, out of state for us.   Tuition, <br/>
room and board nears 30,000 per year.  She was there four years  and a summer <br/>
semester.  We paid about six thousand dollars out of pocket  (mostly for the <br/>
summer semester) and she had about four thousand in loans.   The rest was paid by <br/>
private scholarships and grants.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve recommended this to other parents who felt panicked that their child  <br/>
wanted to head off to college and they had not financially prepared, it has  <br/>
always helped greatly.<br/>
 <br/>
We got the original award letter and I called the financial aide office  just <br/>
to ask some questions.  How much did they think books average?   (it had been <br/>
many years since I was in college)  How much do they figure an  away from <br/>
home student might need to live on?<br/>
 <br/>
I asked LOTS of questions.  I finally just said to him that I was  trying to <br/>
be prepared.  We wanted to give Sarah this opportunity that she  wanted but I <br/>
wasn&#39;t willing for the rest of us to sit in the dark and eat peanut  butter <br/>
sandwiches for four years to make it happen.  I wanted to know the  approximate <br/>
monthly amount I would have to budget for her to be there.<br/>
 <br/>
He laughed and said he&#39;d never heard it put quite that way.  He&#39;d see  what <br/>
he could do and send me a letter in a week.  Her first year, he came  up with <br/>
us paying $1,000.00.  Not bad at all.<br/>
 <br/>
So, I would add to not rule out private colleges because they seem so  <br/>
expensive.  I would have paid more for her to go three years to a community  college <br/>
in state and it would not have been the experience that she was looking  for. <br/>
