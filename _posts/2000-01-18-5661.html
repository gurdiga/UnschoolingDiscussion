<div id="ygrps-yiv-675764861">Thanks so much... but my library is tiny and it is hard to find even the<br/>
more basic Canadian history books and fictions so I doubt that I will find<br/>
the book you mentioned. But I order books like a fiend...a major addiction<br/>
and pretty much compulsory where I live (remote). <br/>
Soooo, any other suggestions&gt;??<br/>
And could anyone get me the name of the book listed below or better yet, an<br/>
ISBN. <br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt;I haven&#39;t been very helpful in her pursuit of great historical fiction<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;regarding this era in American history (we do not cover it here in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Canada...esp. at elementary levels). She is particularly interested in the<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1800&#39;s. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;One of the Fleischman&#39;s (Either Sid or Paul) recently published a lively<br/>
 </span></blockquote>book <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;about a girl who ends up travelling with &quot;the bandit&quot; Joaquin Murietta.  I <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t remember the title, but maybe you can find it at the library.  I <br/>
&gt;enjoyed the book.  It&#39;s set around 1849.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, Zorro is a set in California, when it was still part of Mexico.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I wish I had more suggestions.  I&#39;ll be interested to hear what others have <br/>
&gt;to say.<br/>
