<br/>
I suppose it is because nearly all children go to school nowadays and <br/>
have things arranged for them that they seem so forlornly unable to <br/>
produce their own ideas.<br/>
~~ Agatha Christie ~~<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
TURN &#39;EM ON, TUNE &#39;EM IN, DROP &#39;EM OUT<br/>
http://www.home-ed-magazine.com/HEM/195/soroad.html<br/>
<br/>
Turn &#39;em on. Unfortunately, it seems our schools are better at <br/>
turning kids off to learning than they are at turning them on to it. <br/>
The problem, as the saying goes, might be too many cooks spoiling the <br/>
soup. Children don&#39;t get the soup until the federal and state <br/>
politicians, county and local politicians, test writers, textbook <br/>
publishers, teachers unions, school boards, taxpayers, <br/>
superintendents, principals, and teachers all add their own brands of <br/>
seasoning. When they&#39;re all done, every conceivable kind of learner <br/>
-- regardless of taste or appetite -- is served the same unpalatable, <br/>
watered-down mix that has only a vague resemblance to the healthy, <br/>
natural thing -- real education.<br/>
<br/>
Children are natural learning machines. Turn them on, then get the <br/>
heck outta their way! Instead of mental gruel, feed them whole food <br/>
for the mind -- real books, and knowledge borne of experience in the <br/>
greater world where they will live and work and play -- today, not <br/>
tomorrow. Only in freedom to taste the variety of ways to learn that <br/>
the world has to offer can a child truly be turned on...<br/>
<br/>
... Once you&#39;ve got those lean, mean learning machines well fed and <br/>
running, it&#39;s time to tune in like only a parent can do. You&#39;re in a <br/>
perfect position to observe, study, and participate. Tune in to what <br/>
turns your child on. It might be physics. It might be comic books. No <br/>
matter, learning is available from both -- we&#39;re in the real world <br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
With clues about what turns your child on, seek out available <br/>
resources that build on the excitement and keep the momentum going. <br/>
Find information in books and on the Internet, yes, but also check <br/>
out videos, television programs, museums, organizations, and, most <br/>
importantly, people within the community who share the same passion. <br/>
Take an active interest so you can be the very best guide (not <br/>
teacher, guide) that money can&#39;t buy. Open your own mind to learning <br/>
for the pure joy of it and you&#39;ll find, along with your child, that <br/>
the world is full of interesting things to know. Build up your own <br/>
appetite for knowledge, and sit down to partake in that healthy, <br/>
natural soup right alongside your offspring.<br/>
~~ Linda Dobson in the Sept/Oct issue of Home Education Magazine ~~<br/>
<br/>
You can read the rest of this delicious column, as well as a couple <br/>
of articles and columns from the September/October issue at the <br/>
address above, but you&#39;ll have to get the magazine--the one you hold <br/>
in your hands--to read them all! See special subscription information <br/>
at the top and end of this newsletter, or visit your local bookseller <br/>
to get your copy today.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
LET&#39;S PLAY GAMES!<br/>
<br/>
Worried your kids won&#39;t know how to take tests if they homeschool? <br/>
You don&#39;t have to send them to school for that! These games are like <br/>
taking tests, only fun. Test your knowledge on all kinds of topics at <br/>
the following websites. Good luck!<br/>
<br/>
Answer 6 trivia questions on a variety of topics. Questions change <br/>
periodically. The Cyber Camp at World Book&#39;s site offers some <br/>
interesting projects as well. You can click on it from the same page <br/>
as the trivia game.<br/>
http://www2.worldbook.com/students/trivia_quiz.asp<br/>
<br/>
Merriam-Webster changes their word game every day and you can try the <br/>
ones in the archives. If you love words, you&#39;ll spend a long time at <br/>
this site. (I should know.)<br/>
http://www.m-w.com/game<br/>
<br/>
I love National Geographic. You can play games and explore the world <br/>
on their website for days and not see it all. This trivia game tests <br/>
your knowledge of...what else?...geography.<br/>
http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geobee/ax/newquizstart.html<br/>
<br/>
Are you as virtuous as Benjamin Franklin? Take this test that&#39;s based <br/>
on Ben Franklin&#39;s self-improvement program. You&#39;ll find other <br/>
interesting activities for getting to know Ben better in this area of <br/>
the PBS website.<br/>
http://www.pbs.org/benfranklin/exp_virtue.html<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
ASK CAROL<br/>
<br/>
In addition to editing this newsletter, I write a column for Home <br/>
Education Magazine. Now, I don&#39;t want to take Ann Lander&#39;s place, but <br/>
I will take those thorny questions and problems you struggle with and <br/>
try to give you some options or information that might help you. <br/>
Although I don&#39;t answer the questions in this newsletter, I do answer <br/>
them in every issue of HEM, the original print version where <br/>
homeschoolers have found support for over 20 years. A couple of them <br/>
are online (http://www.home-ed-magazine.com), but most you have to <br/>
read in the magazine.<br/>
<br/>
I really like to get your questions-any questions at all, even if you <br/>
think your question is too stupid and you&#39;re the only one who has <br/>
your particular problem (probably not true). So, don&#39;t be shy; don&#39;t <br/>
procrastinate; send me your questions. I even have a special email <br/>
address: askcarol@... . Of course, I don&#39;t promise I <br/>
can answer every question in the magazine (especially if you don&#39;t <br/>
send one!), but I try to respond to each one, whether I use it for a <br/>
column or not. Don&#39;t wait! (~ CN ~)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
UNSCHOOLING.COM<br/>
http://www.unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
I thought I would share an update. I had struggled with deciding to <br/>
support my dd (daughter) in going back to school this year. She&#39;s <br/>
been begging to go for about a year. (She is 10.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, here are some of the things she described after 1 week at school:<br/>
<br/>
The teacher was BORING.<br/>
<br/>
The class work was BORING. &quot;All we do is sit at desks all day and <br/>
read a book or do paperwork.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She even asked if it would be that boring next week, and her friends <br/>
said, &quot;Yes, but we just have to deal with it.&quot; That&#39;s the first <br/>
honest thing they&#39;ve told her.<br/>
<br/>
Recess was BORING.<br/>
<br/>
The kids were &quot;weird&quot; or &quot;mean and bossy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The food sucked.<br/>
<br/>
The cafeteria aides chased the kids out before their lunch period was <br/>
over. (Like after they&#39;d only been eating for 5 or 10 minutes.)<br/>
<br/>
The bathroom privileges, while flexible this week, were going to <br/>
change: next week they can only go when they get to school and at <br/>
lunch. (I pity the girls who get their period for the first time!)<br/>
<br/>
The librarian wouldn&#39;t explain how to play a particular game (the <br/>
kids who&#39;ve been there all these years already knew how to <br/>
play)...and so she was the only one who didn&#39;t get a prize. This <br/>
librarian also knew she was homeschooled and told me she thinks there <br/>
is a &quot;right&quot; way to homeschool...BLECH.<br/>
<br/>
To her credit, my wonderful daughter DID stand up to the cafeteria <br/>
aids and told them that she had until 1pm to finish eating, to which <br/>
they replied that she &quot;had a point.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad she came back home. ~~ Koolaidmom, unschooling.com <br/>

LITE BRITE<br/>
http://www.sfpg.com/animation/litebrite.html#<br/>
<br/>
Remember Lite Brite? We always ran out of the black paper and we <br/>
never had enough of the little lights to do the pictures we wanted to <br/>
do. Not so with the online version. You have as many of the 8 colors <br/>
of lights as you want and you never run out of paper. It&#39;s not really <br/>
as exciting as seeing the lights light up, but it&#39;s still fun to play <br/>
with. Why not try some math games too? Color every third dot a <br/>
different color from the rest and see what the pattern looks like. <br/>
Then try 2s and 4s. See if you can make up a game for 2 players. Get <br/>
creative! This website is fun for any age.<br/>

<br/>
WHEN THE PRESS LOOKS AT HOMESCHOOLING<br/>
http://www.nhen.org<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When the National Home Education Network first began doing media <br/>
work, every article with something positive to say about <br/>
homeschooling seemed like a little baby step forward. But for each of <br/>
those encouraging articles, there were also the ones we dreaded, <br/>
those that gave misinformation, or painted a very skewed picture of <br/>
who homeschoolers are and what it is that we do all day...&quot; ~~ Laura <br/>
Derrick ~~<br/>
<br/>
Laura mentions several different articles that are beginning to show <br/>
a shift in reporters&#39; attitudes toward homeschooling. She writes, &quot;A <br/>
year ago we had only glimpses of these kinds of media pieces. Now it <br/>
really seems as if the tide might finally be turning toward a much <br/>
more interesting coverage of homeschooling. A lot of credit should go <br/>
to the many homeschoolers who have opened up their lives, and <br/>
sometimes even their homes, to journalists, so that the world might <br/>
see beyond the statistics and the contests to the heart and soul of <br/>
homeschooling.&quot; Read the entire article at the NHEN website: <br/>
http://www.nhen.org/nhen/pov/editors/default.asp?id=397<br/>

&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**&lt;&lt;**<br/>
<br/>
TIME TO PRACTICE!<br/>
<br/>
Many kids start music lessons in the fall. If you or your child need <br/>
practice learning notes and music theory, check out the Java music <br/>
theory tutorials at http://web1.hamilton.edu/javamusic . Fun for <br/>
people of any age with an interest in learning music, this site can <br/>
really help you master music.<br/>
