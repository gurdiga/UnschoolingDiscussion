<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107830225">maybe this is a little off, but I read a book &quot;Rich dad, Poor dad&quot;,<br/>
(sounds out &#39;a place i know), where the author asks the question <br/>
generally about good educations, &quot;May it&#39;s a good education, but is <br/>
it adequate?&quot; - this got me thinking because what he stated was <br/>
about successful financial education and view of money, ironically <br/>
most people focus on money when they think about success; so here&#39;s <br/>
a thing for you to ponder about</div>
