<div id="ygrps-yiv-229678973">&lt;&lt;So Julie why live in the US if you are a communist?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ummm....because I&#39;m an American citizen.  I don&#39;t believe in capitalism<br/>
which is economic doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m against the country.  I don&#39;t see how<br/>
capitalism and Christianity go together myself, and I am a follower of<br/>
Christ if not a Christian with a capital C.  However, I don&#39;t support<br/>
American imperialism in general.  To be honest I think that is how you end<br/>
up with the horrors of yesterday.  But the biggest reason I live in the U.S.<br/>
is because my dh is the biggest yuppie, consumerism-at-its-best, capitalist<br/>
I know.  Makes for very interesting dinner conversation.<br/>
<br/>
I actively promote communism like I actively promote unschooling.  Talking,<br/>
educating with people with whom I have personal contact.  So many people<br/>
think the USSR is communism when actually an unschooling, noncoercive family<br/>
is closer to the ideal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776819814">Hey Aimee,<br/>
<br/>
I had about given up hope of finding another unschooler in TX.  I really do<br/>
love it, wouldn&#39;t live anywhere else (tried it and was so homesick) but you<br/>
do have to develop a thick skin and a strong sense of self.<br/>
<br/>
We live just north of San Antonio in the southern Hill Country.  We have<br/>
family in Amarillo and are up there quite often.  Where are you?<br/>

<br/>
If we are talking experience, I have a Master&#39;s degree in Clinical Psych.  I<br/>
worked for 10 years doing inpatient rehab and general psych with adolescents<br/>

of Yale on Alcoholism treatment.  There is no diagnosis of television<br/>
addiction.<br/>

Many people with OCD are compulsive about television, but that isn&#39;t the<br/>

Also in Sandra&#39;s defense, not that she needs defending by me, looking at<br/>
family dynamics is standard practice in dealing with any mental illness,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747238216">Oh now this opens a door for a real discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I am seriously curious, not looking for an argument, just trying to, shall<br/>
we say, wrap my brain around, as a Communist how you can believe that<br/>
Christianity and capitalism don&#39;t go together when Marx felt what religion<br/>
and capitalism did to the masses were parellel and were equally evil?  I<br/>
mean, Marx  believed religion was the &quot;opium of the masses&quot; that &quot;should not<br/>
only be dismissed, but dismissed with scorn&quot; and that &quot;religion&#39;s role in<br/>
history has been to offer a divine justification for the status quo&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my grandfather quoting Marx about religion not being a good thing<br/>
when he led some of the meetings his cell had.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826474147">Then you know that a layman will call something by a non-technical term, ie.<br/>
television addiction even though it is technically part the manifestation of<br/>
obsessive behavior.<br/>
<br/>
And, you also know that the shrink community is no longer rushing blindly<br/>
into blaming how a person is raised, and instead is looking at the whole<br/>
person, family, physical and genetic history for answers.  In fact, the<br/>
majority are taking steps to stop the stereotyping of addictive diseases.<br/>

some of the orders of monks.  The higher ups had gold and fine velvets<br/>
while the minions had sackcloth and wood.  Christianity does not have to<br/>
be like that.  But Marx could not seperate the two.<br/>

it as the big bad red boogie man that was promoted by this government?<br/>

As to our forefather, if you mean the genocidal folks that wrote the<br/>
constitution, well, they weren&#39;t exactly squeeky clean themselves.<br/>
<br/>
As to people who fought for this country, they had many political beliefs<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-240238726">Hey, Julie~<br/>
<br/>
I live in Denton, north of D/FW.  I know a few &quot;old-school&quot; <br/>
unschoolers in my area (their kids are grown now), and I am slowly <br/>
gathering some similarly-minded open-hearted people around me and my <br/>
kids.  I&#39;ve put up flyers all over town to start an unschooling <br/>
group, with very little response.  I added &quot;eclectic homeschoolers&quot; <br/>
to the flyer, and people are responding.  While it would be nice to <br/>
have some other unschoolers in our day-to-day lives, I am most <br/>
concerned currently with my little ones having some day-time buddies <br/>
when they want them - doesn&#39;t matter too much to me whether or not <br/>
they&#39;re unschooled or homeschooled or school-schooled for that matter!<br/>
<br/>
Some of my best friends live in New Braunfels.  She helped start a <br/>
relaxed homeschoolers group there (or maybe in SA?), and most of its <br/>
members are unschoolers.  If you want to email me off-list, I can try <br/>
to get the info on it if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
My family has a ranch in the hill country - near Marble Falls.  We <br/>
don&#39;t make it down too often these days, but will probably come <br/>
through sometime this fall.  <br/>
<br/>
What *one* book would you recommend re. &quot;pure&quot; communism?  I&#39;m <br/>
curious enough to read one now.  I&#39;ve read several references and <br/>
blurbs about pure or real communism, and I&#39;ve read rather extensively <br/>
about communal living, and my curiosity is now peaked.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, and good luck~<br/>
Aimee<br/>
