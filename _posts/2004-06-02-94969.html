<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what I am wondering is what you or other more<br/>
&gt;  experienced homeschoolers think of as your role in terms of <br/>
&gt;  facilitating<br/>
&gt; learning for your kid(s) and is that pretty much the same  for all<br/>
&gt; unschoolers or does it differ.  In other words, how do you  generally go<br/>
&gt; about digging up possible resources that your kids might be  interested <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; for things they&#39;ve expressed interest in, or  thinking up ways they <br/>
&gt; might<br/>
&gt; enjoy expanding those  interests.  And how much do you leave up to <br/>
&gt; them?  Is<br/>
&gt;  this something that has varied over your years of unschooling with <br/>
&gt;  insight<br/>
&gt; you have gained in the process of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>THESE are  really good questions that hit right at the center of what <br/>
makes unschooling  what it is. The easy quick answer is that the <br/>
parents&#39; role varies depending  on the child (and on the parent).  I <br/>
think &quot;pretty much the same for  all unschoolers&quot; would be a very <br/>
misleading answer. My role isn&#39;t the same  even for my three kids.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I bet there are some genera principles  that all unschoolers <br/>
abide by and maybe together we can come up with a  useful list.<br/>
<br/>
What is the role of the unschooling parent?<br/>
<br/>
1. Show  respect for all of a child&#39;s interests equally.<br/>
2. Keep the child in mind as  I go through life, so that I notice things <br/>
that might be of interest to that  child.<br/>
3. Find ways to include the child in my own daily life - live a more  <br/>
&quot;open-book&quot; life than the norm.<br/>
4. Follow up on things the child is  interested in - and do this in a <br/>
wide variety of ways, not only by &quot;getting  him a book on it.&quot;<br/>
5. Live a family life that is rich with experiences of a  variety of <br/>
kinds both at home and outside the home.<br/>
6. Have resources  around the home that are interesting and stimulating <br/>
- things that will  encourage exploration of ideas.<br/>
7. Discuss things - spend time in  conversation. This is probably <br/>
overall the most important parental &quot;action&quot;  involved in unschooling.<br/>
8. Have a &#39;playful&#39; attitude - play together, have  fun, appreciate the <br/>
amazing world around ou. Don&#39;t be cynical, be able to  be amazed and <br/>
find the world a fascinating place. THIS is the most important  <br/>
&quot;attitude&quot; for an unschooling parent.<br/>
9. Be self-aware of your own  thinking and behavior. Purposely stretch <br/>
your imagination - question your  own assumptions, check your own <br/>
automatic impulses.<br/>
10. Be very observant  of what your child is really doing - don&#39;t view <br/>
him/her in a shallow  superficial way. Recognize that there is a reason <br/>
for a child&#39;s actions,  that a child is &#39;born to learn&#39; and is always <br/>
learning. Get to know your  child&#39;s own special favored ways of learning<br/>
11. Wholeheartedly support a  child&#39;s passions EVEN if, to you, they <br/>
don&#39;t look like  &quot;education.&quot;<br/>
