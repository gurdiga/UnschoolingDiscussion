<div id="ygrps-yiv-1237575195">Hi all....<br/>
<br/>
( hey Lyn ;-))<br/>
 I just want to introduce myself here....<br/>
 My name is Joshua and I have two boys going on 6 and 8 who &quot;unschool&quot; <br/>
as near as I can tell.  I am the &quot;stay at home parent&quot;, as my wife works full time. We withdrew our boys form school over the Christmas break, so we are only a month into this.  <br/>
 Of course I have been going through questions about to what extent to utilize curriculum materials etc. and how to structure our &quot;schooldays&quot;.  My wife would be much happier I think if we created an in home replica of a school classroom and followed a good curriculum, but it is just what I desire for us.  Intuitively I have always known learning didnt need to be confined to &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
 I didn&#39;t know it was called &quot;unschooling&quot;, but I am happy to find lots of other people &quot;out there&quot; educationg their children at home by just living full inquisitive lives.  <br/>
 I look forward to having such a lorge list of experienced people to glean wisdome from through this list.  <br/>
 Cheers,<br/>
<br/>
 Joshua <br/>
<br/>
 Oh, are there any other stay-home dad&#39;s out there??</div>
