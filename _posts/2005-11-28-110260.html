<div id="ygrps-yiv-1622364505">Hi, I&#39;m Jenn. I&#39;ve been lurking for a couple weeks, but this is my first<br/>
post here. My 10yo boy/girl twins have been homeschooling for almost three<br/>
years. We&#39;ve been gradually evolving to an unschooling environment, with a<br/>
big leap over the past month or two. We&#39;re all more relaxed, enjoying each<br/>
other&#39;s company, and exploring many new interests together. DH and I are<br/>
also finding that we&#39;re starting to naturally ease up on non-homeschool<br/>
rules because they just don&#39;t seem to apply anymore. Bedtime has become much<br/>
more relaxed -- I&#39;ll remind the kids if we have obligations the next day<br/>
that might prevent them from sneaking in a mid-day nap, but I leave the<br/>
decision of when to go to sleep to them. Tonight, they&#39;re sleeping in the<br/>
family room with the dogs because they wanted to have a &quot;slumber party&quot;<br/>
together. Meals have become a more cooperative effort, and the kids are<br/>
taking more interest in learning about nutrition as we give them a voice in<br/>
choosing what we&#39;re going to make for dinner and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a question, though. My daughter and I were discussing The Giver<br/>
last night. She loves that book, and we&#39;ve talked about it many times over<br/>
the past year or so. Last night, I shared a viewpoint that was different<br/>
from hers, and she immediately said she agreed with me. When I asked why she<br/>
didn&#39;t maintain her position, as the story could easily be interpreted<br/>
either way, she said she didn&#39;t like disagreeing with me because I&#39;m an<br/>
authority figure. This shocked me. DH and I have never been the sort of<br/>
parents who demand unwavering discipline or agreement. My mother lives<br/>
nearby and is often here for dinner, so the kids see a living,<br/>
multi-generational example of how we can respectfully debate and<br/>
occasionally disagree with each other, especially as we all love to discuss<br/>
current events and books and whatnot. <br/>
<br/>
Can anyone offer advice on how we can encourage our daughter to stand up for<br/>
herself and feel free to question without turning this into a &quot;lesson&quot; and<br/>
making a big deal of it with her? I don&#39;t want to make her even more<br/>
self-conscious about it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Jenn</div>

 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s only ten.   That&#39;s really young to stick to literary analysis. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe she really liked your theory better. Maybe she could see the value in <br/>
both.   <br/>
Maybe she just really LIKES you and wants to hear your theories and agree <br/>
with them.   Holly went through a phase of thinking my ideas were always great.   <br/>
It&#39;s fading.   Enjoy it while you can!<br/>
<br/>
Accepting her ideas as valid is better than pressing her to disagre with <br/>
people, I think.   It&#39;s just another kind of pressure if you&#39;re going to reward <br/>
her (however subtly) for disagreeing with you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t going to answer your question, but in the same vein...<br/>
Last night my housemates found some furs in an old trunk.  I happen to <br/>
be a *huge* fan of animal fur, so I tried on the brown mink stole (it <br/>
had a clippy under the mouth so it could &#39;bite itself&#39; to stay in <br/>
place!) and a beautiful white mink coat.  I walked around for a while <br/>
just petting myself; I was incredibly gleeful when they said I could <br/>
have the coat!!!  I asked Hannah, 9, to bring it downstairs for me, she <br/>
refused to touch the fur (agreed to transport it by touching only the <br/>
satin lining), and gave me a huge opposing spiel on fur.   She&#39;s seen me <br/>
ooohing and aaaahing over vintage furs many times, but we had never had <br/>
a discussion.  It was *SO* cool to debate purposefulness after death (my <br/>
justification) and animal cruelty.  She wouldn&#39;t buy my &quot;but this is <br/>
their purpose in life and I&#39;d hate to deny them their one true purpose&quot; <br/>
and she came back with if one were to eat the animal, it would be right <br/>
and proper to use the fur and the other parts as needed, as in leather. <br/>
I so enjoyed the exchange and am so impressed with her ability to hold <br/>
her own opinions in the face of mine.  I realized too, that although I <br/>
want my kids to think for themselves, I had always assumed they would <br/>
come to the same (highly logical &lt;g&gt;) conclusions as me -- it&#39;s so cool <br/>
that she didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t and even cooler that she didn&#39;t/doesn&#39;t feel she <br/>
*has to*!!<br/>
This original discussion resurfaced a few hours later as we talked about <br/>
our aging kitty and my desire to tan her hide and create a wall hanging <br/>
out of her (or a muff, or a hat, or slippers &lt;bg&gt;), which led to a talk <br/>
about cremation and her desire to add Patches&#39; ashes to her &#39;collection&#39; <br/>
(she has some of her dad&#39;s ashes) and some to sprinkle at the cat&#39;s <br/>
birth home, which led to talking about Mitch and what his perceptions <br/>
would be of our life right now, which led to a discussion on my dad and <br/>
his relationship with Mitch, which led to a discussion on grieving (&quot;I <br/>
really like talking to you about daddy when you aren&#39;t crying about <br/>
it&quot;), which led to plans for our Death Day celebration (ala Nearly <br/>
Headless Nick) this coming Saturday... We went to bed at midnight, but <br/>
fell asleep sometime after 3:00 &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
~diana :) who knows fur is politically incorrect, but danggummit, I sure <br/>
wish I was furrier on days like today with all the snow and wind, as I&#39;m <br/>
not, I&#39;ll happily repurpose someone else&#39;s &lt;bg&gt;<br/>
