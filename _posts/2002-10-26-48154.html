<div id="ygrps-yiv-578888560"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What about those people who don&#39;t have family support systems?  People talk<br/>
&gt;  all the time about families taking care of each other.  What family?  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;  never lived closer than a 3 day drive from my relatives, compliments of the<br/>
&gt;  U.S. Army.  I&#39;m also not in the minority as far as this situation goes.<br/>
&gt;  Nice idea.  Doesn&#39;t work these days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote> I know this post is a couple of days old and off of your minds now, but I <br/>
just had to comment.  I&#39;m still catching up after being in the hospital for a <br/>
couple of days and having a broken ankle...<br/>
<br/>
I must be really lucky.  My parents live an hour and a half away, but are <br/>
ageing and it is difficult for them to help.  The paramedics called them and <br/>
they came right away.  We have wonderful friends and neighbors on our block.  <br/>
The kids went from house to house, were dressed, bathed, fed, nourished, <br/>
played with and loved every minute of my hospitalization.  As soon as it was <br/>
clear the extent of the fracture, a friend down the street started calling <br/>
everyone she knows to get a lead on a nanny.  We hired one last night <br/>
(Thursday), just four days after the fall.  We have dinner coming every other <br/>
night.  We have people begging to do errands, running to the library, fixing <br/>
our vacuum cleaner, etc.  Maybe we just live in Mayberry, but it does happen <br/>
in this day and age.  A diverse group of public and Catholic schoolers, <br/>
christians, agnostics, undeclareds, republicans, democrats, tall, short, fat, <br/>
fit, big families, small families, grown children, little children and those <br/>
inbetween.  We all have a desire to live in a community together and make our <br/>
lives easier.  We work at it.  We&#39;ve made our own family.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s humbling to be on the receiving end of such caring attention.  <br/>
