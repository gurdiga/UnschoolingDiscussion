<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633688168"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My kids  aren&#39;t vaccinated and the younger 3 have never had chicken pox. In<br/>
&gt; the next 6  months they will all be 10, 9 and 4. I seem to have an immunity<br/>
&gt; although I was  never tested. If I do have that immunity, my kids may have it<br/>
&gt; also. My oldest  has had them before the others were born. Someone I know of<br/>
&gt; has <br/>
&gt; a child with  them now and I&#39;m wondering about exposing them like I&#39;ve heard<br/>
&gt; people do while  the kids are young.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A bunch of my friends and I did a pox party and it was a good thing in my<br/>
opinion.  Most of the kids got moderate cases of them so we felt good about<br/>
immunity without it being dangerously miserable like it can be once you hit<br/>
puberty.  My then 2 yo got a very tolerable case.  My son was 3 months old<br/>
and he only got a few, although another friend&#39;s baby a week older got a<br/>
very full case of them.  Everyone is different but it seems the general<br/>
consensus is that they are milder and safer if the kids are younger, and<br/>
that the vax isn&#39;t very effective even if it were something you were<br/>
interested in in the first place.<br/>
