<div id="ygrps-yiv-96909638">Ooh, this can be a tough one in  some ways.  I was unable to access the<br/>
article so I&#39;ll have to go out and buy the paper.  But here are my<br/>
immediate thoughts, negative and postive:  <br/>
Does the Chicago Public System have the right to judge anybody?  Do they<br/>
have the staff to do this ?  <br/>
<br/>
I have 2 friends that teach in the Chgo. public school system. One is a<br/>
kindergarten teacher who is consistently amazed at the large number of<br/>
her students who are not aware of  letters, numbers or books.  These<br/>
things are completely foreign to them. They are, however, well versed in<br/>
swearing and threatening each other.  If this is truly the case, maybe<br/>
some counseling would be a good thing. But again, I must ask, the Chicago<br/>
PS?  What a joke. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply">     &gt; INTRUSIVE POLICIES. Chicago public schools will begin this year <br/>
&gt; evaluating<br/>
&gt; parents. Yes, you read that correctly. The district will rate <br/>
&gt; parents on<br/>
&gt; how well they fulfil 23 &quot;responsibilities.&quot; Schools have the option <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; targeting all parents, or only selected parents. Parents who don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; meet the<br/>
&gt; expectations of the schools will receive home visits every 10 weeks <br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; one of more than 1000 school staff members or counselors. Some of <br/>
&gt; the areas<br/>
&gt; that might put parents on the list:<br/>
&gt; * Parent fails to praise the child often enough<br/>
&gt; * Parent spends insufficient &quot;quality time&quot; with child <br/>
&gt; * Child eats meals or snacks that the school deems unhealthy. <br/>
&gt; * Child dressed in a manner the school considers inappropriate for <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; weather<br/>
&gt; * Child is tardy or absent from school<br/>
&gt; * Child comes to school inadequately unprepared<br/>
&gt; * Child fails to return completed homework on time<br/>

Probably not.  And if they have the staff to do this -- why can&#39;t Johnny <br/>
