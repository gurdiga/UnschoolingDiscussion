<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149506555">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have been lurking for a few weeks, my name is April.  I have two ds&#39;s 3 and <br/>
5 (and one on the way!)  I also run a licensed childcare from my home.  <br/>
Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
One of my questions is about the dads.  How do the dads handle the <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; idea.  My dh was very open to the idea of homeschooling, he has <br/>
a sister that hs&#39;s her six children.  But, she is very structured.  I think <br/>
that this is what he expects, sort of a mini school.  I started off trying to <br/>
be that way with my ds this year, but never felt that comfortable.  I started <br/>
hearing about unschooling and reading about it.  I feel more comfortable <br/>
somewhere in the middle.  Not too structured, but with some use of <br/>
curriculum, like Saxon math, that I use loosely.  My dh does not seem to be <br/>
too comfortable with this idea.  He feels that if I never &quot;teach&quot; him <br/>
anything, that he will never learn.  Dh wants to see physical work, like <br/>
workbooks or pages of writing.  I think that he is stuck on the idea that I <br/>
can turn our son into a genius, lol.  So, does anyone have any good ideas on <br/>
how to deschool my dh?  How can we meet in the middle?  Has anyone had this <br/>
experience before?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1173734541"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font COLOR="#0000a0" SIZE="4" FACE="CAC Moose">Wow! &nbsp;I have had this experience just recently. &nbsp;My husband was *cured* by 
<br>reading a few books relative to homeschooling and unschooling and mostly from 
<br>reading the posts since I joined this e-mail loop. &nbsp;(i only joined 2 weeks 
<br>ago)
<br>
<br>After three days of maybe one hundred e-mails - and chatting with my son 
<br>about learning and what it means to him etc - he was hooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday he 
<br>slipped and said &quot;Do good work with mom tomorrow&quot;. &nbsp;I shot him such a look! &nbsp;
<br>He then said, &quot;I mean, have a great day with mom tomorrow - I will miss you.&quot;
<br>My son smiled and said &quot;Remember dad, no pressure!&quot; &nbsp;It was sooo cute - such 
<br>a great moment! &nbsp;
<br>
<br>As I said, I am new to this too - but just reading all the wonderful info on 
<br>this site, really helped.

<div><font face="CentSchbook BT" size="4">My DH is having some qualms about my 
lack of educational structure.&nbsp; The first thing I did to &#39;cure&#39; him was to 
send him to another country!&nbsp; (This is a joke...&lt;G&gt;... He was in the 
middle east for almost 2 years so DS and I were on our own.)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="CentSchbook BT" size="4">Once DH came back he recognized he had 
to learn our lifestyle rather than expect us to conform to the lifestyle he 
expected.&nbsp; That is an education in itself, I&#39;ll tell you!</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="CentSchbook BT" size="4">It took DH over a year to find another 
job state side that didn&#39;t have him travelling all over the place.&nbsp; During 
that time my health went significantly downhill, so we&#39;ve had &#39;time off&#39; from 
most structure in our lives.&nbsp; Now that he&#39;s working and we&#39;ve moved, he&#39;s 
starting to put some pressure on us to &#39;do&#39; something.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="CentSchbook BT" size="4">So far I&#39;ve given him books to read, or 
make a point of letting him know &#39;schoolish&#39; facts DS has picked up in his daily 
doings.&nbsp; DH&#39;s schedule is such that he has very little time at home, so he 
hasn&#39;t had much chance to do more than fuss about it a little a time or 
two.&nbsp; IF it comes down to his outright expressing concern that we aren&#39;t 
doing enough &#39;school&#39; then we&#39;ll sit down and have some frank discussions about 
learning styles.&nbsp; I&#39;ll expect him to read some and learn where I&#39;m coming 
from and we&#39;ll go from there.&nbsp; From what he&#39;s already told me when we 
discuss it, I think he&#39;ll be a fast convert and we won&#39;t have much trouble about 
it. </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="CentSchbook BT" size="4">I also quietly point out to DH when 
teaching moments happen...especially when it is a conversation that DS has 
initiated with DH and the natural course of the conversation/activity has led to 
learning.&nbsp; DH has been very impressed with those incidents.&nbsp; It has 
increased his confidence.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="CentSchbook BT" size="4">It helps that DS is 12 and is 
thriving.&nbsp; DH has had a chance to see that I might know a little about what 
I&#39;m doing.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="CentSchbook BT" size="4">These aren&#39;t very well put together 
thoughts...sorry about that.&nbsp; Normally I try to communicate better.&nbsp; 
Today isn&#39;t such a good day for that, and if I wait for a better time it is not 
likely to happen, so I wanted to at least let you know that you aren&#39;t 
alone!</font></div>

<br>
<br>Here&#39;s some input:
<br>
<br>Dad&#39;s are gone all day (at least around here :) ) and want to feel they have 
<br>a clue about what&#39;s going on and that good things are happening to their kids 
<br>and they want to be involved. &nbsp;Hopefully.
<br>
<br>So . . . 
<br>
<br>we meet Dad for picnics, fishing, etc. -- whatever he suggests when he has 
<br>time that the kids would have fun doing that includes him
<br>
<br>the kids love to tell him what they&#39;ve been up to -- show him today&#39;s artwork 
<br>or new book or tell a story about what happened
<br>
<br>our Dad makes an effort to find things he thinks are &quot;educational&quot; and yet 
<br>are things the kiddos would like talking to him about -- example, yesterday&#39;s 
<br>newspaper had an article about Washington&#39;s inauguration and we had been to 
<br>the statue on Wall Street commemorating it, etc.
<br>
<br>Dad has a cell phone -- we talk to him a lot -- sometimes just to update him 
<br>on some little thing.
<br>
<br>Etc.
<br>
<br>He is supportive because he sees it working and the kids are happy and we&#39;re 
<br>not the packaged curriculum types anyway.
<br>
<br>Good luck.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484321592">I have children the same age as yours, and as you already know, <br/>
children learn SO much through play.  One way to show your DH how <br/>
unschooling is effective is stop and list all the things your <br/>
children know already!  I think you will both be surprised, &quot;All this <br/>
w/o &quot;formal&quot; education!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Whenever a relative questions our decision to hs, I tell them that my <br/>
3yr old would be bored to tears in Kindergarten, so how on earth <br/>
could my 5yr old benefit?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-607521616">This is something I always did.  I could never get my husband to actually <br/>
read the books that I thought were important, so as I was reading the books, <br/>
I often read important passages to him out loud or I would just talk talk <br/>
talk endlessly about everything I had read about.  He was initially totally <br/>
against homeschooling but my enthusiam for the subject wore off on him.<br/>
<br/>
Now when we see things on TV that are school related, he will say things <br/>
like &quot;they&#39;re just saying that because that&#39;s the way they are conditioned, <br/>
they should try unschooling&quot;<br/>

parks, etc for him.&nbsp; He took them to the Natural History Museum &amp; spent 
the first morning&nbsp; there.&nbsp; The kids were explaining to him what they 
were looking at.&nbsp; The next day he took them to an art museum.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
They spent the morning their &amp; again the kids were explaining to him what 
different pieces were made from.&nbsp; They even had computer programs for the 
kids to work with &amp; all three played with it.&nbsp; The kids asked to go 
back to the history museum for the afternoon.&nbsp; He was so impressed by their 
understanding &amp; knowledge.&nbsp; I hadn&#39;t even preped the kids for them to 
be able to show off but they were ready.&nbsp; His comment to me was what ever I
