<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742177803">Now that we have decided (well I really decided and informed my <br/>
husband as he had no opinion other than not sending our daughter to <br/>
public school) to unschool our 2 1/2 year old daughter, I am tring <br/>
to see things in a different way.  I went to public school for 12 <br/>
years and am really tring to disconnect from that way <br/>
of &quot;teaching.&quot;  I love the idea of letting her learn on her own and <br/>
exploring the world around her.  I know that I always learned things <br/>
much more throughly when it was somthing that I wanted to learn <br/>
about and was allowed to do my own research on.  <br/>
<br/>
To get to the point of this post.  Now that my daughter is 2 1/2, I <br/>
have started thinking about potty training and I&#39;m stuck.  Part of <br/>
me feels like I should go out and buy the pull ups and &quot;teach&quot; her <br/>
how to use the potty.  But, I think that she does know how to use it <br/>
and is just not interested in trying right now.  <br/>
<br/>
I did buy her her own potty a while back and she has certainly <br/>
watched me enough times.  Sometimes she&#39;ll go and sit on her potty <br/>
(while I&#39;m in there) and tell me that she&#39;s using the potty, just <br/>
like me.  She even flushes it (her&#39;s has a fake flusher on it).  So, <br/>
most of the time, I think, just let her learn when she&#39;s ready.  <br/>
But, then sometimes I hear (in my head) &quot;people&quot; saying she&#39;s 3 1/2 <br/>
or 4 and not potty trained yet?!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if this has nothing to do with unschooling and I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be posting it but, I wanted to get some other opinions on this.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

just glad it isn&#39;t me having to clean it up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

**It may be hard to stop other people from making comments like that, but<br/>
you can decide that they&#39;re not allowed to talk in your head :0).  I&#39;m much<br/>
more concerned with how my kids feel about how I treat them than with what<br/>

replace them with your daughter&#39;s voice.  She&#39;s the one who matters here.<br/>

You&#39;ve done your part.  You&#39;ve created an environment where she can learn in<br/>
her own time.  Now you need to trust her to do so.  ~Rue<br/>

That&#39;s exactly what I thought.  I don&#39;t normally worry about things <br/>
like this.  Of course, I started doubting myself when I talked to my <br/>
niece&#39;s mom (never married to my brother).  She is soooooo into <br/>
things like did she crawl by this age, walk by this age, talk by <br/>
this age and how come she isn&#39;t potty trained yet?  I started to <br/>
wonder if maybe I wasn&#39;t worrying enough about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m done...I enjoy her too much to wonder why she isn&#39;t out of <br/>
diapers yet.  Too many other things to do.....like play in the new <br/>
fallen snow (we woke up to that this morning). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114065369">Inasmuch as unschooling is life, and so is learning to use a potty, it&#39;s not inappropriate for this list in my opinion. <br/>
 <br/>
I personally would wait..and am waiting...my 3 1/2 year old son CAN &quot;go potty&quot; but hardly ever does. SO he&#39;s still in pullups and/or diapers. He just isn&#39;t all that interested in moving into underwear full-time. <br/>
 <br/>
My 2 1/2 year old is becoming interested in the whole idea, and so we&#39;re looking at getting her some underpants. She&#39;ll strip as soon as she is icky because she doesn&#39;t like how it feels. I think once she gets the idea, she&#39;ll &quot;train&quot; quickly and easily, like my oldest did. <br/>
 <br/>
Considering that the only NEED for Logan to be pottytrained at this time is for our convenience in not having 3 children in diapers, since he will NOT be going to preschool or Head Start or anything...I&#39;m doing my best to not consider him behind or anything. I highly doubt he&#39;ll still be in diapers when he&#39;s 5 or 6. Right now, it&#39;s not that big of a deal. Inconvenient...somewhat, but that&#39;s my problem and not his. He&#39;ll have times where he&#39;ll ask for underpants, and times he wants a pullup. <br/>
 <br/>
If he&#39;s 6 and still in a pullup, I might consult a doctor to make sure he doesn&#39;t have any physical problems, but at this point...I&#39;m not going to rush it. <br/>
 <br/>
If Meggie gets &quot;trained&quot; before he does, that might spur him into it. Or it might not. <br/>
 <br/>
Letting go of societal edicts that a child must be potty trained early in life isn&#39;t easy, but I don&#39;t see any reason to battle over it, have hurt feelings and anger or anything.<br/>

  I&#39;m to the point of actually wishing I could wave a magic wand and just have<br/>
  my little one (Alyssa) really want to go on the potty.  <br/>
<br/>
What helped here when my daughter was 3 was reassuring her that if she pooped on the potty, she didn&#39;t have <br/>
to keep doing it there.  I told her that she could try the potty and then go back to diapers if she preferred.  In general she dislikes transitions and change -- as soon as she realized that she wasn&#39;t committing to anything permanent she pooped on the potty -- realized that it drastically improved her comfort and never looked back.  She had 2 pee accidents and 1 poop accident that week and that was it.  (Although she did pee all over me in bed at night about 2 nights a week for another couple of months until she learned to wake up enough to go to the bathroom). <br/>

Nice to know I&#39;m not the only one still sleeping with my little <br/>
one.  It started out as something that was just so easy when she was <br/>
a newborn (who wants to get up and out of bed when you can just roll <br/>
over?).  Then, we have moved so much in the last 2 years that I feel <br/>
like it makes her feel safer when she&#39;s in a new place to be with me <br/>
right next to her (I do know that she sleeps better with me next to <br/>
her rather than in her own bed).  Especially since my husband works <br/>
nights and is gone 6 nights a week.  We even went so far as to buy a <br/>
bigger bed (so that when my husband is home, we can all fit in one <br/>
bed).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071292113">It&#39;s easy. Watch for his lead. Give him plenty of opportunity--potty in the <br/>
playroom kind of thing. I even toted a port-a-potty in my van for a while. <br/>
Get lots of thick underwear, and be prepared to clean up however often you <br/>
need to--cheerfully. Get them into dry pants as quickly as possible. Let <br/>
them go bare whenever you&#39;re outside or someplace it doesn&#39;t really matter. <br/>
Be positive--always.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve approached it with 3 kids this way, one at 3.5, one at 19 mos. and one <br/>
at 2.5.  Whenever they&#39;re ready is when they&#39;ll do it. Facilitate, clean up <br/>
cheerfully, and it&#39;s a breeze.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042049220">I like it that she&#39;s aware and will tell me she&#39;s &quot;Ih-TY!&quot; sometimes though if we aren&#39;t careful she will take off an icky diaper and then we have a mess to find...but usually she&#39;ll tell us, but if she&#39;s wet she&#39;ll tend to just take it off. But she&#39;ll take it off right at the bathroom now and say &quot;Peepee! Got Peepee!!&quot; and we&#39;ll help her to sit on the toilet. <br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s a trip...she&#39;ll flush things down the toilet if you&#39;re not careful...the other day she threw a candy wrapper in and flushed it before I could get to her...and she stuck her head in through the seat and yelled &quot;BYE-BYE!!!&quot; and waved her hand...!!  Another time, she had just gone in and flushed it for no reason (I was watching her closely) and she leaned over and then grabbed her nose and said &quot;oh TINKY!!&quot;<br/>

<h4>Robyn Coburn</h4>
<time>30 Dec 2003, at  8:10pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147647131">&lt;&lt;To get to the point of this post.  Now that my daughter is 2 1/2, I <br/>
have started thinking about potty training and I&#39;m stuck.  Part of <br/>
me feels like I should go out and buy the pull ups and &quot;teach&quot; her <br/>
how to use the potty.  But, I think that she does know how to use it <br/>
and is just not interested in trying right now.  <br/>
<br/>
I did buy her her own potty a while back and she has certainly <br/>
watched me enough times.  Sometimes she&#39;ll go and sit on her potty <br/>
(while I&#39;m in there) and tell me that she&#39;s using the potty, just <br/>
like me.  She even flushes it (her&#39;s has a fake flusher on it).  So, <br/>
most of the time, I think, just let her learn when she&#39;s ready.  <br/>
But, then sometimes I hear (in my head) &quot;people&quot; saying she&#39;s 3 1/2 <br/>
or 4 and not potty trained yet?!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This sounds to me like a little girl who is exactly on track with her own<br/>
potty learning. Try and lose the word training from your thinking and you<br/>
are well on track. Also there are many and plenty of youngsters who are not<br/>
seeming to do anything until they are 4, then suddenly seem to learn it all<br/>
overnight. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn is four and completely moved from cloth diapers to using the adult<br/>
commode all the time, from about 2 ½ to about 3 ½ (no dyedee at night)<br/>
absolutely painlessly without any effort from me. She began just as you are<br/>
describing (bar the flush action). Next she would use the potty before we<br/>
went swimming through her swimsuit, at my invitation. We were away from home<br/>
at the time with my mother going through an illness, so I was surprised that<br/>
she wanted to start the process  her life being disrupted and all. When we<br/>
got home in to our apartment, I would ask her whether she wanted to be<br/>
without her diaper for a while. I would move the potty around the house to<br/>
whatever room we were in, and show her how to pour it out  usually she<br/>
asked me to do it anyway. She would tell me that she had poo-poo in her<br/>
butt and then run to her potty. I guess we would have about one accident<br/>
a week, or less. Slowly the potty moved from in any room to the hallway, and<br/>
finally the bathroom again. We used diapers when we went out, and then<br/>
started leaving them at home, but taking our potty in the car. She seemed to<br/>
go from needing the diapers to simply telling me she wanted to peepee very<br/>
quickly.<br/>
<br/>
We still used a diaper at night, and towards the end of that she would wake<br/>
up dry, and use her diaper when she awoke  giggling about it sometimes. I<br/>
started asking her whether she wanted a diaper or not, or taking it off<br/>
first thing, so she became used to going into the bathroom a little while<br/>
after waking. There was a brief period of confusion for her about whether<br/>
she had her panties or her diaper on  but this only lasted a few nights. We<br/>
used a couple of washable bedliners (rather than disposable) from Bed, Bath<br/>
and Beyond to protect our mattress. She has wet the bed once in the last<br/>
four or five months.<br/>
<br/>
What we did not use were pull ups (another invention of the disposable<br/>
diaper industry), rewards, punishments, or any other numerous strategies<br/>
from Potty train your child overnight! experts. She still announces her<br/>
intention to go to the bathroom, although less often. She refuses to use<br/>
small commodes, in the places where kid size ones are available  saying she<br/>
is a big girl now and will use the big potty. The only help she still<br/>
requires of me is wiping her butt  on the occasions where that is<br/>
necessary.<br/>
<br/>
You may find more acceptance of late (although your daughter is not by any<br/>
standards late) potty learning amongst other homeschoolers than the public<br/>
at large. Find a local park day type group now. Jayn has been going to our<br/>
local group since she was 18 months.<br/>

&gt;Nice to know I&#39;m not the only one still sleeping with my little<br/>
&gt;one.  It started out as something that was just so easy when she was<br/>
&gt;a newborn (who wants to get up and out of bed when you can just roll<br/>
&gt;over?).  Then, we have moved so much in the last 2 years that I feel<br/>
&gt;like it makes her feel safer when she&#39;s in a new place to be with me<br/>
&gt;right next to her (I do know that she sleeps better with me next to<br/>
&gt;her rather than in her own bed).  Especially since my husband works<br/>
&gt;nights and is gone 6 nights a week.  We even went so far as to buy a<br/>
&gt;bigger bed (so that when my husband is home, we can all fit in one<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lots of co-sleeping on this list. Lars slept with us until he was about 4. <br/>
My daughter and her husband have 3 with them most nights, though the 9 year <br/>
old is working up whatever it takes to sleep alone. I think she does now <br/>
some nights.<br/>
And my daughter also gets drenched many nights. The middle one won&#39;t wear <br/>
diapers but doesn&#39;t wake up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068280974">We co-sleep here now too! I wish we had more with Sarah. Logan spent his first four months in the bed with me because we didn&#39;t have a crib for him; he often comes to join me at night. Sometimes he can&#39;t fall asleep without someone with him. He&#39;s lately taken to sleeping on the couch with Megan, who decided last summer that the new couch was more comfortable than anywhere else in the house. Occasionally he&#39;ll crawl in bed with Sarah. I have Gracie in bed with me alot. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah usually keeps to herself nowadays, but she&#39;ll snuggle with me in the mornings.<br/>

(although we always seem to be the ones to get peed on, must be the <br/>

My DD talks in her sleep and I mean sometimes I think she just might <br/>
be awake.  I&#39;m used to it by now but my husband is not home most <br/>
nights and he got an earfull for the first time early this morning.  <br/>
He sat up in bed, looked at me (because, of course I was awake since <br/>
I wake up every time she makes a noise) and asked if she was ok.  I <br/>
had to laugh since I think he thought I was exaggerating somewhat.  <br/>

I personally think pull-ups are a major obstacle in kids choosing to use the<br/>
toilet.  My first few kids were in cloth and made the switch fairly easily.<br/>
The last ones and the foster kids we used pull-ups and it seemed to take<br/>
much longer to make the connection.  I thought perhaps it had to do with the<br/>
pull-ups pulling the moisture away from the skin.  Just my .02<br/>

I think you just might be right (I&#39;m sure they work fine for some <br/>
people).  My cousin worked for a day care provider and once told me <br/>
that she hated pull ups.  She felt that they really were an obstacle <br/>
to potty training and would not recommend them to anyone.  That&#39;s <br/>
one of the reasons that I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m going to get them.  I think <br/>
I&#39;m just going to wait a while until we do anything and see how she <br/>
does.<br/>

I didn&#39;t mention in my earlier post, but you have reminded me. I would often<br/>
put the nighttime diaper (double cloths) onto Jayn after she had dropped off<br/>
to sleep.<br/>

Oh I do agree. The disposables just make it so darn comfy I&#39;m guessing. But<br/>
I have never used cloth and I&#39;m not going to start now just to get Alyssa<br/>
out of them quicker. &lt;BG&gt; I should relish these last months because my<br/>
diaper changing days are over. Until grandkids of course!!!<br/>
