<br/>
Pat, I&#39;m not sure I really understand your question....what you described<br/>
above sounds just like &quot;child centered learning&quot; to me.  There is nothing<br/>
wrong with sharing your interests with your children.  I think the key here<br/>
would be &quot;what would you do if they were *not* interested in what you saw<br/>
under the microscope?&quot;  If that&#39;s fine with you, then it&#39;s still<br/>
child-centered.  If it&#39;s not OK with you and you make them stick with it for<br/>
a certain amount of time or until some goal is met, then it would not be<br/>
child centered.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing that is at least some factor in there is that a parent<br/>
probably &quot;should&quot; (for lack of a better phrase that comes to mind!) *enjoy*<br/>
whatever it is they&#39;re sharing.  Kids can see right through you and if<br/>
you&#39;re just staging a &quot;learning moment&quot; for *their* benefit then they won&#39;t<br/>
be fooled.  It depends a bit on what their experiences with learning were<br/>
before this.  (I.e. were they &quot;made&quot; to study certain things or not?)  But<br/>
by the same token, the above statement still applies....as long as it&#39;s OK<br/>
with you that they&#39;re NOT interested, then feel free to show them the world.<br/>
In fact, at least in the beginning stages of unschooling, it&#39;s probably an<br/>
important factor in them being able to discover their joys and passions.<br/>
<br/>
And when children have a trust that no one is going to &quot;make&quot; them learn<br/>
something, then they will very likely be interested in a great deal of what<br/>
you are interested in.  Or at the very least will be willing to give it a<br/>
try.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you were wondering?<br/>

<br/>
I agree with this, too.  I think as importantly or MORE importantly than<br/>
sharing things with them that you think THEY will like is just modeling<br/>
passion in your *own* life--whether they are interested or not.  From this,<br/>
they learn life is full of joy and passion and they will seek it out in<br/>
their own lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Leslie, I really like what you wrote, especially about the children being able to try things with out expectations.  I think that is really a great point. I want to help them remain open to new experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Eventhough I have become very passionate about things over my lifetime, I am not open to new things unless I see a purpose to it.  When I was growing up I was paid for my grades.  I got really good grades but have never been able to enjoy learning for the pleasure of learning.  There always needs to be a purpose in it for me.  Maybe it would not have mattered how I was raised because it may just be my personality to be an all or nothing person.  I do feel I am missing out on simply being in awe of something or just enjoying the sunsets just because of their beautiful.  Actually, it has been so wonderful seeing things through my children&#39;s eyes.  Things are easy for them to enjoy.  To tell you the truth, I feel I am being a little selfish about the unschooling stuff.  I am the one whose life has been so enriched because of my childrens simple pleasures. I hope they never decide to go back to ps.  <br/>

I hope my kids can see my flaws for what they are.  I try to hide my prejudices and other flaws as much as possible.  A few times my dd&#39;s have taught me a lesson or two.  Here is a good example.  I had to keep my mouth shut one year when my dd took some canned goods in to school for a food drive.  I went in the building with her and she put the cans in the boxes at the front entrance.  I said something about &quot;oh you don&#39;t want to bring them to your classroom?&quot;  I&#39;m embarrassed to say I would have brought them to the classroom so that others could see I had done something good.

I think you&#39;re catching on to this unschooling thing just fine :-) <br/>
Most people have to enter into it with baby steps. I think you&#39;re <br/>
making great strides toward a goal that will be both fulfilling for <br/>
you and your kids. Keep it up and don&#39;t give up on &#39;em!<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the encouraging words.  I so agree with you about kids keeping us honest.  They don&#39;t miss a thing, and they are brutally honest.  The other day my 10 yo dd asked if I had a scar on my lip.  I nonchalantly said &quot;no that is a wrinkle&quot; (while deep inside I wanted to say &quot;Oh my are my wrinkles getting that bad, I wish I wasn&#39;t looking so old&quot; but I didn&#39;t show any of my insecurities.  Kids are very observant! <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have another question in my quest to understand unschooling.  One <br/>
 </span></blockquote>of my main reasons for homeschooling in the first place was to foster <br/>
the love of learning in my children.  This was clearly being squashed <br/>
in ps.  Some may or probably will disagree with me here but in my <br/>
mind child centered learning may not always foster the love of <br/>
learning which is truly my goal.  Agree or Disagree?  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree and I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
There are kids out there who need extra help along those lines.  They <br/>
are IMHO by far not the norm.  But there are enough of them that no <br/>
forum (including this one) should act like they don&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
For the vast majority of kids, being left to their own interests is <br/>
fine.  They will learn what they need, when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few cases where because of underlying problems a child <br/>
does not thrive if left to figure things out on his own.  In those <br/>
cases, I believe it is the responsibility of the parent to step in.  <br/>
The big trick is knowing if what you think is a problem child reallly <br/>
is.  If you think your child has problems that you need to deal with, <br/>
step back and take a long hard look and make absolutely certain that <br/>
the problem is with the child and not with your preconceived notions <br/>
of what &quot;normal&quot; is supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
One way to tell the difference is this:  Is your child happy most of <br/>
the time?  Then don&#39;t worry much.  But if your child is unhappy and <br/>
frustrated most of the time, maybe (MAYBE) you need to do something.  <br/>
BUT - - and this is very important - - if you are comin gout of more <br/>
than one year of ps, give the child a LOT of time (at least a full <br/>
year) to unlearn the bad stuff from school before making the decision <br/>
to step in.  I waited 2 1/2 years with Wyndham, just watching him and <br/>
trying to let him be himself by giving him the tools and materials he <br/>
wanted to fool around with.  It was becoming more and more clear in <br/>
that time that he did NEED our help with many things.  His happiness <br/>
was declining the whole time.<br/>
<br/>
But the flipside of that coin is that my girls have had even longer <br/>
to deschool - this is our 7th year - and until this year I was <br/>
waiting for signs in them one way or the other.  They were always <br/>
learning just enough to keep me from believing they needed help, even <br/>
when dh and grandma were naysaying.  I see things in them this year <br/>
that just took time to develope.  And I know that had I tried with <br/>
them what works with Wyndham it would have been a disaster.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part about this is knowing the difference.  If I had not <br/>
been through this both ways, I would probably be in the let them ALL <br/>
unschool - it works for everyone camp.  As it is, I have strong <br/>
beliefs that unschooling is very good and is the best for the <br/>
majority but that there is no reason to expect it to be the perfect <br/>
thing for EVERY child.  <br/>

Pat, I wanted to comment on this thought.... I don&#39;t think your experience<br/>
(needing a purpose to learn) is undesirable.  In fact, I think it is the<br/>
essence of unschooling.  I think most adults (not all) would say this about<br/>
themselves.  Perhaps what you were saying (as I read between the lines) is<br/>
that you needed an *external* motivation for learning--an extrensic reward?<br/>
Approval, maybe?  I was the same way in school.<br/>
<br/>
I do hope that my children will find learning has it own intrinsic rewards<br/>
BUT I don&#39;t make the mistake of thinking that they will be eager to learn<br/>
without a &quot;purpose&quot;....it will just be *their* purpose.  It may or may not<br/>
be obvious to me OR them...but it is there.  I do see my<br/>
children--unschooled all their lives--doing plenty of things that bring them<br/>
extrinsic rewards.  But I don&#39;t think they associate *learning, per se* with<br/>
these rewards.  (For example, my son has studied public speaking because it<br/>
allows him to speak well in front of his Scout troop and he gains the<br/>
admiration of his peers and positive feedback from his Scoutmaster who he<br/>
adores.  Working a job and getting paid is an extrinsic reward.)<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, the primary mistake schools make is to act as if learning HAS<br/>
no purpose other than the extrensic rewards schools/teachers provide.  They<br/>
try to *manufacture* purpose where it does not exist. Or, worse, they warp<br/>
the purpose so severely as to cause humiliation and make learning painful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m post-migraine here, so not sure if I said what I wanted to, but maybe<br/>
someone else can continue with the thought.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490803637">Hi Leslie,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the thoughtful response.  I have a question though.  If it is the norm to need a purpose to learn, then why do people go to museums or star gaze?  My dh and kids used to go to museums a lot and I could not understand what they could get out of it unless they were studying something that was there.  I would look at things and try to get the feeling I get when I have a purpose to learn it, but I couldn&#39;t.  Now that we have been unschooling for a few months, I am beginning to just look at things and be in awe of them or see the beauty in them.  Aren&#39;t these experiences learning experiences?  I hope they are because we have been doing a lot of this with our new microscope.  Maybe these things are not the things any one of us will look into in great depth and maybe that is what you are speaking of when you talk about purpose, more in-depth learning.  However, without this process of experiencing many things, how will we know what we really have a passion for?  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well...&quot;pleasure&quot; is a purpose, too.  &quot;Beauty&quot;, &quot;joy&quot;, &quot;inspiration&quot;,<br/>
&quot;happiness&quot;, &quot;understanding&quot;....&quot;making sense of my world&quot;--those are all<br/>
purposes, too.  They aren&#39;t *tangible* ones, perhaps, but they are purposes.<br/>
That was what I meant when I said that it might not be &quot;obvious&quot;--&quot;tangible&quot;<br/>
would have been a better choice of words.<br/>
<br/>
But not all learning is *enjoyable*.....for example, when I have problems<br/>
with my computer, I don&#39;t find it inherently pleasurable to search the<br/>
Internet looking for a way to solve my problem.  In fact, I find it<br/>
extremely distasteful.  But I have a need--a purpose.  So I don&#39;t really<br/>
think it is a realistic goal that unschooling will make all learning fun.  I<br/>
think it is realistic to think that one will not try to separate learning<br/>
from it&#39;s purpose, though.  This is what much of institutional school and<br/>
school-at-home does.<br/>
