<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987946626">A book appeared in our house yesterday of which the kids have no<br/>
recollection. It&#39;s hard cover, brand new, and quite beautiful. Santa<br/>
come early?<br/>
<br/>
I picked it up this morning and read it and was inspired. It seemed to<br/>
talk to unschooling so much! It is a testament to passion and<br/>
following one&#39;s interests.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about a man who was born in 1865 in Vermont, where snow was &quot;as<br/>
common as dirt&quot;. But the boy loved snow. He spent every minute (during<br/>
the winter :) observing snow, picking up snowflakes, comparing<br/>
designs, trying to draw them, etc. The neighbors sneered, the father<br/>
thought it foolish, but since his parents loved him they spent their<br/>
life savings on a microscope/camera so that he could photograph<br/>
snowflakes. This in 1881 when he was 16.<br/>
<br/>
The boy, Wilson Bentley, spent two winters trying to get a decent<br/>
snowflake photograph, and then finally got it... using a tiny aperture<br/>
and really long exposure. He spent many, many hours collecting,<br/>
studying, and photographing snowflakes. He never made any money from<br/>
it, a group of scientists raised money so that he could publish a book<br/>
&quot;Snow Crystals&quot; which is still a basic &quot;text&quot; for snow.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a quote from Wilson Bentley:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The average dairy farmer gets up at dawn because he has to go to work<br/>
in the cow yard. I get up at dawn, too. But it is because I want to<br/>
find some leaf, hung with dew; or a spider web which the dew has made<br/>
into the most delicate ropes of pearls... I take my camera with me,<br/>
get down on my knees in the wet grass, and photograph these exquisite<br/>
bits of nature. Because I do this I can show these lovely things to<br/>
people who never would have seen them without my help. They will get<br/>
their daily quart of milk, all right. Other farmers will attend to<br/>
that. But I think I am giving them something which is just as<br/>
important.&quot; -- W. A. Bentley<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Although the book is meant for children, it seems perfect to me for<br/>
relatives who don&#39;t get unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869522627">just wanted to second this book recommendation! :)  we love it!! <br/>
<br/>
the illustrations are beautiful woodcuts and it&#39;s a nice story...even <br/>
better that it&#39;s true!  i must say though, my favorite thing about it is <br/>
how it&#39;s written.  the text is split on the page...there&#39;s the regular <br/>
story part in the middle with the pictures, and then there&#39;s additional <br/>
information/tidbits on the edges for a more in-depth experience!  some <br/>
of my kids like the shorter version, some like the longer.  and you can <br/>
pick and choose what to read each time. :)<br/>
<br/>
snowflake bentley was a groovy guy!  and i think the layout of the book <br/>
is fitting for his somewhat unconventional way of life.<br/>
<br/>
check it out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293745191">Thanks Liz for the great info on this very interesting sounding book! I <br/>
clicked on the Amazon link (and the other one too!) and found even more <br/>
great information! We will definitely be adding this book to our ever <br/>
growing library. My soon to be 8 yr old DD is my nature bug; I am <br/>
certain she will love it! And so will I!<br/>
Happy Holidays to all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969316415">Our 9th grade science teacher, Louie Sanchez, told us about those  <br/>
early snowflake photos, and patterns in nature involving sixes.<br/>
<br/>
I taught with Louie later.  I learned a lot of cool things from him,  <br/>
many not the &quot;real&quot; stuff--not the in-class stuff.  He was  <br/>
insightful, irritating and a font of connections and oddments.<br/>
<br/>
People who don&#39;t live where snow is probably don&#39;t know that if a  <br/>
snowflake lands on something like cloth it will sit there for a while  <br/>
before it melts or is shaken off and sometimes you can see a little  <br/>
of the shape of it.  Sometimes they fall in clumps, though, and look  <br/>
more like a pile of stuff that weighs nothing.  Sometimes those  <br/>
clumps get heavy, and as they fall the edges turn up so they look  <br/>
like corn flakes (the shape, not the color) and start to wag back and  <br/>
forth some as they fall.  Sometimes the wind is blowing and it turns  <br/>
into little ice balls and doesn&#39;t look so cool.  But sometimes on a  <br/>
very still day if the flakes fall so gently that they&#39;re not  <br/>
combining you can really see one.<br/>
<br/>
Also when it&#39;s still that way you can look up and see them coming all  <br/>
around you and it looks a little like when you&#39;re driving through  <br/>
snow and the snow goes in all directions (or when the Enterprise goes  <br/>
through at warp speed and something (STARS!?  I doubt it &lt;g&gt;) is  <br/>
going by on all sides. &lt;g&gt;    And just as you&#39;re wondering how high  <br/>
up you&#39;re seeing these snowflakes, whether it&#39;s six feet or maybe  <br/>
twenty, one will get you RIGHT in the eye. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373525629">I first heard about this guy from my dad, who is always interested in<br/>
stories of people who follow their interests and passions (and is a<br/>
great cheerleader for unschooling, too, yay!!).<br/>
<br/>
We also love the books by Bentley himself, with gorgeous photos of<br/>
hundreds of snowflakes. Here are amazon links to them:<br/>
