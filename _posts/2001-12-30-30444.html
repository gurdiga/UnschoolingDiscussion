<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662175004">=======================================================================<br/>
When somebody comes along and posts that they&#39;re giving up the school at home thing and going for unschooling and they have questions, what *good* comes from Bridget posting &quot;well, it won&#39;t work for everybody&quot; . WAIT... now, before you respond... let me try to complete this thought..<br/>
Now, it&#39;s true that it might not work for every person BUT shouldn&#39;t the newbie be given the benefit of the doubt and told about all the various ways of deschooling and so on beFORE she&#39;s confronted with this doubtful post from Bridget? Being a newbie, she would not necessarily *know* that Bridget&#39;s son is different and she would *assume* that this &quot;not working&#39; thing happens more often than it *really* does. <br/>
SO, wouldn&#39;t it be better if those who are positive supporters of unschooling reach the newbie first and give them the drill THEN, after six months or a year and they post again and say it&#39;s just not happening like it&#39;s been described, Bridget could then make suggestions  based on *her* experience? <br/>
Before you decide that unschooling isn&#39;t going to work, there is a process.. a *lengthy* process that has to occur before you throw the ideas out the window. <br/>
Makes sense???<br/>

==========================================================================<br/>
<br/>
As a newbie, I have to agree with Sarah.  What I&#39;m looking for from people on this list is the recipe on how to make good unschooling.  I&#39;ll decide after I make it whether I like it or not but if I don&#39;t do it right how will I ever know. I have to give Billie Greer credit for the analogy to cooking.  I read an article he wrote for a newsletter (don&#39;t remember where) that gave me the idea.<br/>
