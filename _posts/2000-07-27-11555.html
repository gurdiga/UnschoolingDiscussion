<div><font color="#000080" size="2">
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">The price of children<br><br>The government 
recently calculated the cost of raising a child&nbsp;from birth to 18 and came 
up with $160,140 for a middle-income<br>family.&nbsp;Talk&nbsp;about sticker 
shock. That doesn&#39;t even touch college tuition.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">For those with kids, that figure leads to wild 
fantasies about all&nbsp;the things we could have bought, all the places we 
could have&nbsp;traveled, all the money we could have banked if not for (insert 
child&#39;s&nbsp;name here).<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">For others, that number might confirm the 
decision to remain&nbsp;childless.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">But $160,140 isn&#39;t so bad if you break it down. 
It translates&nbsp;into $8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month or $171.08 a week. 
That&#39;s a&nbsp;mere $24.44 a day. Just over a dollar an hour. Still, you might 
think&nbsp;the&nbsp;best&nbsp;financial advice says don&#39;t have children if you 
want to be rich. It&#39;s&nbsp;just&nbsp;the opposite.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">There&#39;s no way to put a price tag 
on:<br>*Feeling a new life move for the first time and seeing the bump of&nbsp;a 
knee rippling across your skin.<br>* Having someone cry, &quot;It&#39;s a boy!&quot; or shout, 
&quot;It&#39;s a girl!&quot; then&nbsp;hearing the baby wail and knowing all that matters is 
it&#39;s healthy.<br>* Counting all 10 fingers and toes for the first time.<br>* 
Feeling the warmth of fat cheeks against your breast.<br>* Cupping an entire 
head in the palm of your hand.<br>* Making out da da or ma ma from all the 
cooing and gurgling.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">What do you get for your $160,140?<br>* Naming 
rights. First, middle and last.<br>* Glimpses of God every day.<br>* Giggles 
under the covers every night.<br>* More love than your heart can hold.<br>* 
Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.<br>* Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds 
and warm cookies.<br>* A hand to hold, usually covered with jam.<br>* A partner 
for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building sand castles and skipping down the 
sidewalk in the pouring rain.<br>* Someone to laugh yourself silly with no 
matter what the boss said or how your stocks performed that 
day.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">For $160,140, you never have to grow up. You get 
to finger-paint,&nbsp;carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek, catch lightning bugs 
and never stop believing in Santa Claus.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">You have an excuse to keep reading the 
adventures of Piglet and&nbsp;Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to 
Disney movies and&nbsp;wishing on stars.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">You get to frame rainbows, hearts and flowers 
under refrigerator&nbsp;magnets and collect spray-painted noodle wreaths for 
Christmas,&nbsp;handprints&nbsp;set&nbsp;in clay for Mother&#39;s Day and cards with 
backward letters for Father&#39;s&nbsp;Day.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">For $160,140, there&#39;s no greater bang for your 
buck.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">You get to be a hero just for retrieving a 
Frisbee off the garage&nbsp;roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, 
removing a sliver,&nbsp;filling the wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of 
bangs and coaching&nbsp;a&nbsp;baseball team that never wins but always gets 
treated to ice cream&nbsp;regardless. </font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">You get a front-row seat to history to witness 
the first step,&nbsp;first word, first bra, first date, first time behind the 
wheel.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">You get to be immortal. You get another branch 
added to your&nbsp;family tree, and if you&#39;re lucky, a long list of limbs in 
your<br>obituary&nbsp;called&nbsp;grandchildren.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">You get an education in psychology, nursing, 
criminal justice,&nbsp;communications and human sexuality no college can 
match.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">In the eyes of a child, you rank right up there 
with God.<br></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" size="2">You have the power to heal a boo-boo, scare away 
monsters under&nbsp;the bed, patch a broken heart, police a slumber party, 
ground them&nbsp;forever&nbsp;and love them without limits, so one day they 
will, like you, love&nbsp;without&nbsp;counting the 
cost.<br><br></font></div></font></div></html></div>
