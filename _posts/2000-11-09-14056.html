<div id="ygrps-yiv-1264958305">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else enjoy talking about the elections with their children? We <br/>
all trooped down to the polls to vote and then stayed up late to watch the <br/>
returns... ds, 7, sitting on the couch with his fingers, toes, legs and eyes <br/>
crossed for our man! (We still don&#39;t know if it worked.) I think he&#39;s <br/>
learned so much from our discussions of how the elections work, and how <br/>
other countries are governed, and how our government works, and so on. And <br/>
recently, at every corner we were met by students and others with signs and <br/>
fliers for their particular candidate, and we were able to discuss the <br/>
differences. It&#39;s been exciting for us as we strive to raise a new <br/>
generation of political junkies.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone remembers me, I&#39;m still here, but I&#39;ve been lurking as I have a <br/>
new fulltime job (sigh) and dh is taking over most of the daytime <br/>
responsibilities at home. But I&#39;ve followed all discussions with interest as <br/>
always.<br/>
<br/>
Annette<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633897836">My dd (7) has been fascinated!  Someone taught us an &quot;electoral college&quot;<br/>
game.  You write each state&#39;s name and # of electoral votes on a slip of<br/>
paper.  Take turns drawing a state, find it on the map, and tally the<br/>
points to see who wins.  (math, geography, social studies).  Today we<br/>
found a map of which presidential candidate won which state (on cnn.com)<br/>
and played the game again - awarding the states according to who really<br/>
won it.<br/>
<br/>
Another game she likes is quizzing mom and dad on the state capitols. <br/>
She reads the state and mom and dad race to see who can name the capital<br/>
first.  Boy, are we rusty - she had to give us LOTS of hints!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-194256280">On Tuesday evening we had one of those magical family experiences that <br/>
make it all seem worthwhile. Lately my husband and I have gone off to vote <br/>
with only our youngest who still thinks it&#39;s interesting. This time around, <br/>
Michael, age 15. caught election fever and was very worked up by the time his <br/>
father and older sister got home from work. Jenny, age 19, was about to vote <br/>
for the first time but was not too sure about it. I asked her if she would <br/>
consider having her brother&#39;s help. She said she&#39;d been thinking about asking <br/>
him. We then prepared by discussing with the kids the decisions we&#39;d made <br/>
about candidates and propositions. They decided they agreed with us and we <br/>
wrote it all down for them. Then off we went, all five of us. We filled three <br/>
booths: the teenagers in one, Dad and younger sister (11) in another and me <br/>
by myself. Needless to say the ladies working there were very impressed and <br/>
my husband and I felt very happy. Now, of course, we&#39;re on pins and needles <br/>
with the rest of the country. It&#39;s interesting that Michael had asked his dad <br/>
to explain the electoral college to him in detail about a week before. This <br/>
led to the two of them cracking endless stupid jokes about the &quot;electrical&quot; <br/>
college:&gt;) -Amalia-</div>
