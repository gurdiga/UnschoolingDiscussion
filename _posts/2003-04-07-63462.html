<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-325165482">I&#39;m re-introducing a topic that came up with a new name because I can&#39;t keep track of it in the other threads that are on the list right now.<br/>
<br/>
The question goes something like this...<br/>
<br/>
How do we handle it when our kids say they want to do something (like be a doctor or a vet, etc).  but they aren&#39;t interested in the steps it takes to get there.<br/>

****************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>

&lt;&lt; just sounds like a bit of a frustrating day because you are worried  <br/>
that she won&#39;t do what she needs to do to fulfill her own goals. That  <br/>
isn&#39;t unusual. One thing you can learn here is all about all the  <br/>
unusual ways kids do fulfill their goals and how,.....<br/>
<br/>
Good topic for us to chew on. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
By any chance, is there anyone here who&#39;s had that kind of issue in <br/>
unschooling, and now that child is in Med school (or whatever the case may <br/>
be)? Please do tell tell!   Lara.........</div>

interested in the steps it takes to get there, they aren&#39;t all THAT <br/>
desirous of it. If they really want it badly, it would be hard to stop <br/>
them.<br/>

this is applicable when the parent is more committed to a kid&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
Kirby has said &quot;lawyer&quot; lately.   You know what the preparation is for that?  <br/>
Nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
He writes, reads, and plays games.  He teaches games.  He works in a store, <br/>
where there are all kinds of rules and procedures he has to follow and also <br/>
enforce.<br/>
<br/>
That is preparation.<br/>
<br/>
And if he changes his mind, the preparation won&#39;t have hurt him any.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent tells a child that they can&#39;t be a veterinarian unless they start <br/>
studying anatomy or chemistry now, the parent will be lying.   So parents can <br/>
probably kill a desire to pursue a dream much more effectively than they can <br/>
enhance it.<br/>

    Nothing special.<br/>
<br/>
    He writes, reads, and plays games.  He teaches games.  He works in a store, <br/>
    where there are all kinds of rules and procedures he has to follow and also <br/>
    enforce.<br/>
<br/>
    That is preparation.<br/>
<br/>
    And if he changes his mind, the preparation won&#39;t have hurt him any.<br/>
<br/>
    If a parent tells a child that they can&#39;t be a veterinarian unless they start <br/>
    studying anatomy or chemistry now, the parent will be lying.   So parents can <br/>
    probably kill a desire to pursue a dream much more effectively than they can <br/>
    enhance it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670947728">One of the smartest things I think I did in college was how I handled my<br/>
&quot;requirements.&quot;  I had NO idea what I wanted to be.  So I took any class,<br/>
for the first two years, so long as it interested me and would fit one of<br/>
those undergrad basics.  When I had all the basics filled in I went back and<br/>
looked at the kinds of classes I had taken.<br/>
<br/>
I was about 2/3&#39;s of the way to a English Lit degree with a Anthro minor,<br/>
without even trying.  Just by taking what *I* wanted to take.<br/>
<br/>
It really taught me that by looking at what I&#39;m actually DOING and not what<br/>
I am planning, I can get a clearer idea of where I&#39;m headed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why?  I think that&#39;s a cool way to decide a major.  I did something similar.<br/>
I went to a community college and took any class that interested me.  I&#39;d<br/>
start with a full load and then drop any that didn&#39;t interest me.  I<br/>
happened to take a music theory course and loved it.  I decided I wanted to<br/>
major in music.  I did that for a while, even transferring to a 4 year<br/>
college before deciding it wasn&#39;t for me after all.  I wasn&#39;t good enough<br/>
for performance and didn&#39;t want to be a school music teacher or a<br/>
musicologist.  So I quit moved to Canada.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; How do we handle it when our kids say they want to do something (like<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; be a doctor or a vet, etc).  but they aren&#39;t interested in the steps<br/>
&gt; it takes to get there.<br/>
 &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Like so much of unschooling, for me it boils down to trust and faith. Trust<br/>
that if they really want to do it, they&#39;ll find a way, in their own time and<br/>
at their own pace. Faith that it&#39;s never too late to learn what you need to<br/>
in order to do what you&#39;re passionate about. Grandma Moses didn&#39;t start<br/>
painting until after her children were grown. Agatha Christie wanted a<br/>
career in music, then was a nurse, then finished her first novel at age 30.<br/>
Julia Child had a degree in history, worked for the British spy service in<br/>
WWII, got married and was such a terrible domestic cook that she took<br/>
cooking lessons, and in her late 40&#39;s became a famous chef. The list goes on<br/>
and on.<br/>
If someone is *really* interested in doing something, and if no-one blocks<br/>
that interest or causes it to be pushed aside due to aggravation and<br/>
nagging, they will find a way to make that interest happen. The best thing<br/>
we can do is to make sure our kids know that they&#39;re valued no matter what<br/>
and to pursue our own passions in life with joy. And remember that very few<br/>
of us end up doing what we thought we would when we were 10, or 15, or 20...<br/>
and that&#39;s okay! Some passions are not evident until other things fall into<br/>
place. &quot;What you want to be in life&quot; can change and flow and evolve and be a<br/>
joyous voyage of discovery.<br/>
