<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115567035">Hello,<br/>
I have been reading this list for several months and really enjoy it, but<br/>
now have a concern I hope to find some answers to.<br/>
I will try to keep this short...<br/>
We are an unschooling family in  SC with 4 boys ages 14 down to 3 yo. We<br/>
have always unschooled, (learned about it by studying the work of John Holt<br/>
and later Grace Llewellyn) so our boys have never been registered with any<br/>
school district. We belonged to a Homeschool Support Group for a while in<br/>
the beginning but got tired of talking  &#39;curriculums&#39;  and how to prevent<br/>
&#39;mommy burn out! &#39;  (No experience with either of those!)  Anyway, we&#39;ve<br/>
pretty much been on our own since then and thoroughly love our life! It&#39;s<br/>
been a wonderful adventure for us all and our kids are creative, intelligent<br/>
and passionate about living. They have never had a test of any kind, nor<br/>
have I ever kept detailed descriptions of our days. I sincerely trust them<br/>
and felt my record keeping would imply to them that I do not. I never even<br/>
worried about this but somewhere in the back of my mind I knew we were not<br/>
&#39;complying&#39; with state laws. We live in a rural neighborhood where all<br/>
families have about 5 acres, and behind us is a rather odd neighbor who we<br/>
recently learned has been speaking ill of our homeschooling methods. Namely,<br/>
he said we were lawbreakers and that our kids did nothing all day, and would<br/>
surely grow to breaking and entering and other means of breaking the law as<br/>
they get older. ( ! ) He also said that he had talked to my husband about<br/>
his concern and we refuse to do anything about it. (He has never discussed<br/>
this with me or my husband, doesn&#39;t even know we &#39;unschool&#39; as we don&#39;t make<br/>
that detail public knowledge, and we assume he is inferring this all from<br/>
seeing the kids playing outside at all hours of the day...GASP! )  My<br/>
question...IF he were to turn us in to some higher authority such as DSS or<br/>
the school district, what if anything would likely happen? How difficult<br/>
could he make things for us in this state? We are completely willing to<br/>
relocate to another state if it would come to that and wouldn&#39;t even mind as<br/>
we are contemplating liquidating all assets and traveling in an RV for a few<br/>
years, anyway. (Talk about a rich enviroment! But that is beside the point)<br/>
I have found myself compiling items toward making a portfolio but that<br/>
infuriates me that I should have to do that.  I KNOW how great my kids are<br/>
doing, at the same time I&#39;m sure so called &#39;gaps&#39; could be found if they<br/>
were forced into testing. So now there is this fear...this &#39; what if &#39; in<br/>
the back of my mind. And I am compelled to find some answers.<br/>

You can join PACESC (www.pacesc.com) for $25 to cover everyone.... they are very unschooler friendly, all you have to send in is the beginning of the year simple application, and an end of the year signed statement saying you &quot;did&quot; school for the required 180 days and covered all subjects. No one can touch you if you&#39;re registered with them. :-)<br/>

I seem to be answering questions about SC constantly lately here! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler, please consider joining PS*SOS (Palmetto State&#39;s School&#39;s <br/>
Out Support), a support group for unschoolers in SC. (it&#39;s free!) You can <br/>
direct zillions of questions there!  We are hosting the Live & Learn <br/>
Unschooling Conference in Columbia 11-13 October in downtown Columbia--two <br/>
weeks away! You should REALLY consider coming! And you and your kids could <br/>
meet a bunch of other unschoolers IRL! <br/>
<br/>
You can find info on both at     SchoolsOutSupport.org  <br/>
<br/>
Legally, you need to register with an accountabity association. SOS is <br/>
planning to form our own next year (we would have this year, but we needed 50 <br/>
families. Next year. Next year!), but right now, we are recommending <br/>
PACESC---they&#39;re unschooling-friendly and are only asking for the <br/>
minimum---the most important thing. The state requirements are minimal <br/>
(&quot;teaching&quot; parent must have a high school diploma or equivalent; &quot;teach&quot; 180 <br/>
days/year; keep a portfolio/journal/record; and &quot;cover reading, writing, <br/>
&#39;rithmatic, and social studies and literature and composition in highschool).<br/>
<br/>
And having been to the DMV Tuesday: when your oldest goes for a driver&#39;s <br/>
license, you&#39;ll NEED to be registered! <br/>
<br/>
I just spoke with the spokesman for DSS yesterday. Homeschooling is legal in <br/>
SC, and as long as you&#39;re complying with the law (!!!), they cannot touch you <br/>
for &quot;educational neglect&quot;. If your neighbor is actually threatening you with <br/>
reporting you, it would be in your best interest to BE registered and follow <br/>
the law---or buy that RV and/or move to New Mexico! &lt;G&gt; It&#39;s possible that if <br/>
you just get your records in compliance for THIS year, that you would be <br/>
covered (I don&#39;t know whether they &quot;dig&quot; into your past, but I&#39;d certainly <br/>
get things in order for this year.).<br/>
<br/>
If your children know you trust them and that keeping the records is JUST to <br/>
comply with the law, why would it matter? (other than it&#39;s a pain.)<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to contact me off-list  with any more questions or call me @ <br/>
803 776 4849.<br/>

Sure!  Come on out!  But not until after the conference.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should take your neighbor cookies, and offer to help him, tell him <br/>
stories about how cool your kids are and ask if he&#39;d like you to come over <br/>
EVERY day to reassure him about homeschooling!  He&#39;ll say no. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1036843827">The Fourth Sunday in September is Good Neighbor Day  started in<br/>
Lakeside, MT It is a time to visit shut ins, and (maybe communicate and<br/>
create a bridge with complaining neighbors) and bring them some Ginger<br/>
Bread.  <br/>
Gingerbread recipe is 4 ½ cups flour, 2/3 cups sugar, 2 cups dark<br/>
molasses, 1 ½ cups hot water, 1 cup shortening, 2 eggs, 2 tsp baking<br/>
soda, 2 tsp ginger, 2 tsp cinnamon, 1 ½ tsp salt.  Bake at 325 degrees<br/>
until toothpick comes out clean.  Good Luck!  Lisa of MT<br/>
