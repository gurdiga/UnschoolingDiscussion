<div id="ygrps-yiv-234720775">Dear Unschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
Several exceptions to the rules of pronunciation have been used in order to<br/>
prove that the rules are not valid. That tactic is absurd and misleading. We<br/>
are trying to help people learn things, not to inform them that trying to<br/>
learn is futile. Despite many exception, our languge is regular. The<br/>
exceptions count for a small percentage of all our words. English is<br/>
becoming the world&#39;s language because it is so regular and it does adapt to<br/>
the words of many other languages, precisely because it is a phonetic<br/>
language.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s look at the examples cited (sighted, sited) and try to see how we can<br/>
help. Hey, maybe this group can actually make English even easier to learn<br/>
than it already is, using phonics, of course.<br/>
<br/>
The following was posted in Digest 2184, message 2 (also in earlier digest).<br/>
I&#39;ll try a few changes to make understanding easier. This can be a new<br/>
parlor game, or parlance game...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  WHY IS THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE SO HARD TO LEARN?<br/>
    <br/>
  1) The bandage was wound around the wound.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt;&gt; change the second wound to woond<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  2) The farm was used to produce produce.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt;&gt; change the second produce to produse or prodeuce, or use better<br/>
 </span></blockquote>writing skill, perhaps saying,  &quot;The farm grew produce.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  3) The dump was so full that it had to refuse more refuse.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt;&gt; change the second refuse to refuce or refeuce<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  4) We must polish the Polish furniture.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt;&gt; change polish to pollish<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  5) He could lead, if only he would get the lead out.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">       &gt;&gt; change the second lead to led or ledd<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt;&gt; this one is so crazy that its desert should be to remain in use,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so long as anyone is stupid enough to write it as is<br/>
<br/>
  7) Since there is no time like the present, he thought it was time to<br/>
  present the present.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt;&gt; same for this. Sometimes it&#39;s enjoyable to explain our language to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>foreigners. It&#39;s a bonding exercise.<br/>
<br/>
  8) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">        &gt;&gt; change the second dove to dived<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>   9) I did not object to the object.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; change the first object to obgect<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  10) The insurance was invalid for the invalid.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; change the first invalid to invallid<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  11) There was a row among the oarsmen about how to row.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; change the first row to rhow, and the third row to ro -- like go.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  12) They were too close to the door to close it.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; change the first close to cloce<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  13) The buck does funny things when the does are present.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">          &gt;&gt; He sho duz<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  14) The wind was too strong to wind the sail.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; change the second wind to wynd -- not to be confused with whined<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  15) After a number of injections, my jaw got number.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; since the b is silent in the second number, leave it out and<br/>
 </span></blockquote>double the mm, as in bummer, and dum and dummer<br/>
<br/>
  16) I had to subject the subject to a series of tests.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; On what subject?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  17) I threw the ball through the hoop.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; I throwed the ball thru the hoop. take your pick<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  18) The cement statue of the deer was dear to my Mother.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">         &gt;&gt; was it a doe or a buck? Was it cemented to anything?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  19) The slogan of a bear on the beer bottle was funny.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">          &gt;&gt; what was funny, the bear or the slogan? It makes me think of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>mascot for the Pittsburgh Pirates -- a parrot.<br/>
<br/>
In phugn, Ned Vare<br/>
like my mother told me -- &quot;The p is silent, as in swimming.&quot;</div>

<br/>
This is not the reason English is the world&#39;s language.<br/>
<br/>
When Latin, Italian and French were the languages of international trade and <br/>
politics, in their turns, it was for political reasons, as it is for English <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That tactic is absurd and misleading. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It is not absurd, and it is quite to the point.  SAYING something is <br/>
misleading when it is not is not the way to make friends or influence people. <br/>
 We are leading people toward unschooling.  You are leading people <br/>
(bludgeoning and dragging) toward phonics.  We see phonics as something that <br/>
kids can pick up naturally.  You keep on keep on keep on keep on keep on <br/>
saying phonics has to come before reading.  You keep on keep on keep on keep <br/>
on ignoring what others here are saying DID work and IS working, not what <br/>
they think or hope might work.<br/>

<br/>
No, it was just joke-dissection in a way that killed all the humor.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;change the second wind to wynd -- not to be confused with whined&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wynd is a common Rennaisance spelling of &quot;wynd&quot; (which blows in the sky) <br/>
still appearing in verses and song lyrics commonly found in 2002.<br/>

<br/>
Dear Unschoolers and others,<br/>
<br/>
Phonics is for people of all ages who encounter a word that they have not<br/>
seen before. For children starting out in reading, that includes most words.<br/>
Phonics allows them to turn printed letters into familiar sounds. When they<br/>
do that, they can &quot;hear&quot; the word.<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Dear Ned:<br/>
<br/>
We KNOW what phonics means, what involves, why it is used.<br/>
We are talking about real life experiences of living, reading people, and a <br/>
living, well-read language<br/>
<br/>
You are talking about your personal obsession with an idea, and you&#39;re being <br/>
insulting and condescending to unschooling parents while you do it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First, what I posted was intended as a funny. Who dissects a joke? :o&#92; <br/>
Second, English isn&#39;t becoming the world language because it is regular and <br/>
adaptable, it is because (as much as it counts) America and other English <br/>
speaking Nations are the *super* powers. {Although I believe there is an <br/>
invented language that combines English, Japanese, and some others to form <br/>
what is called the international business language, but I could be wrong.} <br/>
I have, in my short life, met many folks for whom, English is a second, third <br/>
(or more) language. In conversations about learning languages with them, many <br/>
(but not all) have told me that English is one of the harder languages to <br/>
learn precisely because of that *small percentage* of irregular words and <br/>
rules for sounds. The foreign exchange student staying with my folks two <br/>
years ago stated she had an easier time learning Japanese than English. She <br/>
was from Brazil, and English was her third language. <br/>
You stated that &quot;exceptions to the rules of pronunciation have been used in <br/>
order to prove that the rules are not valid.&quot; I doubt anyone here has said, <br/>
or intended to say that. What many of us have said is that learning phonics, <br/>
while fine for many people, doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be the absolute first <br/>
step. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How is changing the spelling of the words in some of the examples I used <br/>
helpful in learning the *rules*? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;2) The farm was used to produce produce.<br/>
       &gt;&gt; change the second produce to produse or prodeuce, or use better<br/>
&gt;writing skill, perhaps saying,  &quot;The farm grew produce.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;6) The soldier decided to desert his dessert in the desert.<br/>
       &gt;&gt; this one is so crazy that its desert should be to remain in use,<br/>
&gt;so long as anyone is stupid enough to write it as is<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HUH??<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;8) When shot at, the dove dove into the bushes.<br/>
       &gt;&gt; change the second dove to dived<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How is this an example of better writing skills? It isn&#39;t even an example of <br/>
good or correct grammar. How is this helpful? I guess I stand by my original <br/>
question of who dissects a joke anyway! <br/>
