<div id="ygrps-yiv-432685518">Holiday&#39;s at my in-laws brought to the front of my mind how to deal with things that are done differently at other peopleâs homes compared to oneâs own home. One thing that has helped me a lot is hearing some of Sandraâs and other peopleâs input about helping your children in other peopleâs homes (That children donât have âabsolute freedomâ to do whatever they wantâ¦ It seems obvious, but tangling out what is acceptable and what is not isnât as easy especially when it is family â&quot; trying to search for the principles). For example, maybe they are allowed to jump or eat on the couch at home, but at other peopleâs homes they are not. (Actually a good example of two things that my 3 yo does at our house, but my Mother-in-law does not want in her home.) <br/>
<br/>
So, I the idea that when we are guests somewhere we may have to act differently than we do at home makes sense. What I am having a hard time with is where the lines are, especially with family. A few examples from this last week â&quot; Marisol had her new pillow pets (a big stuffed animal) on a kitchen counter that no one was using. My SIL came in the kitchen and wanted them off â&quot; said it was disgusting and that we need to respect the house. I was not present for this particular incident â&quot; it was between my husband and her. SIL lives there with their mom and dad right now. Marisol was very upset and did NOT want to move the stuffed animals. My husband didnât see why they had to be moved, felt that they were not bothering anyone. SIL stomped up the stairs, kicked some boxes out of the way (that Marisol had been playing with earlier) slammed the door to her room and didnât come out for a couple of hours (I think she may have taken a nap). SIL is 33 years old and she had several âtantrumsâ like this while we were home â&quot; stomping feet, leaving in a huff etc. In fact she didnât even say goodbye to us! She seems to take Marisolâs intense feelings very personally. She does not really play with her either. On the other hand, my husband is not very sensitive in the way he says things to his sister.<br/>
<br/>
When I found out what happened I felt a lot of anxiety. It is not my parentâs house and my in-laws keep things very neat.  My husband and I both feel between having a 3 yo and it being Christmas â&quot; lots of new stuff and toysâ&quot;that their expectations are not realistic. Plus the way they interact is much different than my family. I thought SIL maybe had a point about us ârespecting their houseâ but do not agree at all with how she reacts to things. I told Marisol that we may have to move them in a little bit. My MIL said it would be nice to move them before preparing dinner. We told Marisol a couple of times and she kept saying âshe wasnât readyâ. I finally did move them and it led to a pretty big meltdown on Marisolâs part. I realize that helping her through big emotions like that and not always having her way is part of what I need to do as a parent. Philosophically we are in a very different place from our family though, so how do we reconcile that? Or donât we?<br/>
<br/>
Another example â&quot; on Sunday Marisol stayed home with the family while my husband, her baby brother, and I went to Mass. We gave her the option of staying at their house to play or going to Mass. She chose to stay with them. We were gone for almost exactly an hour. When we came home Marisol was very upset. From what we gathered from SIL, Marisol, and MIL she had asked (or more likely demanded in the eyes or our family) that her Grandmother come to her. MIL told her to say please and Marisol said she couldnât. Not sure how many times this was recited, âsay pleaseâ âI canât!â but she was very upset. She told me that she was sad because her Nonna Gigi wouldnât come to her (a perfect example I think of children learning something completely different than what you are trying to âteach!â) Besides the fact that I just donât agree with the idea of âteachingâ please and thank you, it was disheartening that we couldnât leave for an hour without coming home to a very upset little girl. Iâm not sure if we should not leave her with them or keep giving her the choice â&quot; I think that maybe if things like that keep occurring she will naturally choose to go with us rather than stay. I donât know. My husband asked his mother if it was worth insisting on a âpleaseâ when it resulted in such a negative result. She said something to the effect that âIf you can never say no to a childâ¦â  I donât think that she finished the thought but it was clear what she meant.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, Marisol does NOT like having her hair brushed right now. We managed to do it the day that we went to the in-laws house, and Christmas eve too (with no tears or upset). So it looked decent through the holiday. But the time we left yesterday it was very messy and tangled. My MIL made several comments â&quot; one that Marisol âlet her brush it a couple timesâ. I said âit depends on her moodâ. She said âthere are some things that you just have to doâ. I didnât respond because once again I have a completely different philosophy than her.<br/>
 <br/>
Do we try to explain some of the reasons behind why we do things? Do we limit our visits to short stays? We live in DC and they live in upstate NY. It makes me not want to visit very often, but to be fair maybe I should tell them that first. I have not really ever talked with them about my parenting &quot;philosophy&quot; and up till now have tried to get along without doing so. But things seem to be getting harder rather than easier as Marisol gets older. She is actually more like my in-laws side of the family than mine in tempermentâ&quot; she knows her mind, knows what she wants, and she is pretty intense. Ironically because of this she clashes with them more than my family, particular my parents, who are way more easy going. My family think she is âhigh maintenanceâ but love her and are way more tolerant of her projects (&quot;messes&quot;) and emotions at their house. Plus they are way more hands on. Also ironically, our baby boy, (Gerry 5 months old) is very laid back so far and the in-laws are just LOVING him. I am worried about comparisons. <br/>
<br/>
What is the balance of ârespectingâ their house but also our daughter when she is doing things that normal 3 year olds do? Maybe we shouldnât stay there anymore, but maybe they deserve to know why first? If we canât be comfortable but they feel we arenât respecting their home maybe it is best? Maybe Iâm missing other choices.</div>

<br/>
I would&#39;ve moved the stuffed animal way more quickly, had it been me.   <br/>
I probably wouldn&#39;t have encouraged it to be on any flat food prep  <br/>
surface, either.  But rather than ask her if she&#39;s ready to move it,  <br/>
you might&#39;ve found a cool little place an make &quot;a den&quot; or something  <br/>
for it to be in and show her excitedly what a cool place you&#39;ve found,  <br/>
so that she sees it as going to a better place, not losing a battle of  <br/>
wills, or a territorial battle.<br/>
<br/>
-=- From what we gathered from SIL, Marisol, and MIL she had asked (or  <br/>
more likely demanded in the eyes or our family) that her Grandmother  <br/>
come to her. MIL told her to say please and Marisol said she  <br/>

â•˛teachingâ•ˇ please and thank you, it was disheartening that  <br/>
we couldnâ•˙t leave for an hour without coming home to a very upset  <br/>
little girl. -=-<br/>
<br/>
We had a family staying with us and the kids would yell for one or the  <br/>
other of the parents to come where they were.  And the parents would.   <br/>
And my kids never did that with me, and I didn&#39;t like it much.  I  <br/>
wondered (but didn&#39;t want to make things worse by asking) whether they  <br/>
did that at home, too, or whether being at my house was a factor.   <br/>
Sometimes parents seem nervous in front of me about how they interact  <br/>
with their kids, or they don&#39;t seem nervous but they tell me later  <br/>
that they were.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can expect to leave your child somewhere for an hour  <br/>
and even hope that those people will be you while you&#39;re gone.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you want to &quot;teach&quot; please and thank you?  They&#39;re  <br/>
powerful.  Not just speaking the words, but feeling the feelings that  <br/>
should go with them.   If my child says &quot;Mom, could you please come  <br/>
here?&quot; she&#39;s saying that if I&#39;m not busy and I feel like it, she would  <br/>
like my attention.  I&#39;m eager, if I can, to go there.  If a kid yells  <br/>
MOM!  it depends on the tone of voice.  If they&#39;re hurt, I&#39;m running.   <br/>
If they sound excited, they&#39;ll probably follow with &quot;This is cool,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Come look!&quot; and I&#39;ll rush over.  To have a rule that someone does or  <br/>
does not have to say &quot;please&quot; is a rule.   To react to a &quot;please&quot;  <br/>
requirement by never encouraging &quot;please&quot; will handicap your child.   <br/>
If you tell your child in words or actions that &quot;thank you&quot; is no  <br/>
better than saying nothing at all, that child will be at a social and  <br/>
emotional disadvantage.<br/>
<br/>
-=- She said â•˛there are some things that you just have to  <br/>
doâ•ˇ. I didnâ•˙t respond because once again I have a  <br/>
completely different philosophy than her.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s right.  There are some things you just have to do.  &lt;g&gt;  She&#39;s  <br/>
wrong, though, because some people choose never to choose, and so they  <br/>
go with the flow, like a stick in a river, until they get stuck  <br/>
somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
First you decide what you want, and then it makes it easier to decide  <br/>
what to do next year.  Do you stay at grandma&#39;s next year again?  It  <br/>
depends what your priorities are. If you stay again, can you prepare  <br/>
your daughter better for it?  Maybe meeting grandma in a public place  <br/>
would be more peaceful, so that the limitations were imposed by  <br/>
strangers (a hotel with a water park or something designed for kids  <br/>
and fun, maybe, for example).<br/>
<br/>
-=-What is the balance of â•˛respectingâ•ˇ their house but also  <br/>
our daughter when she is doing things that normal 3 year olds do?  <br/>
Maybe we shouldnâ•˙t stay there anymore, but maybe they deserve to  <br/>
know why first?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t dramatize it at all.  She won&#39;t be three again.  At some  <br/>
point she&#39;ll be able to help you figure out ways to get along better  <br/>
there.  Our kids had some similar problems with my mother-in-law&#39;s  <br/>
house, but they were better at the transition, after a few years, than  <br/>
I was myself.   She didn&#39;t like for them to say &quot;poop&quot; or &quot;pee.&quot;  I  <br/>
was more likely to offend her than they were.  They saw it as just  <br/>
another place with another set of expectations, and they adapted fine.<br/>

Chamille never really did that, but Margaux has always done that.  She&#39;s getting better about it as she gets older, but she demands things from everyone around her and sometimes it really isn&#39;t nice.  I will almost always say something, like, &quot;you are being really bossy, maybe next time ask nicer.&quot; or &quot;when you demand and yell at me like that, it makes me feel less like jumping up and helping you do something that I would otherwise be very happy to help you with.&quot;.  If she&#39;s really upset, and she does a 180 turn around in less than 30 sec sometimes, it&#39;s better to not say anything in the moment, help her out, do whatever it is she&#39;s asking for, kindly, get her in a better space, THEN say something about how to deal with that better next time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was mostly happening with my husband being around - I wasn&#39;t there initially. Although I don&#39;t know if I would have discouraged it initially anyways -- it was actually a &quot;bar&quot; area of the counter where there are chairs for people to eat and often there are laptops there too. Not really a food prep area per se. I tend to agree with my husband that it wasn&#39;t really a big deal with the toys being there, but we are really laid back with Marisol and where she puts stuff. I do think that if if bothers the people whose house it is then it should be moved.<br/>
<br/>
I mostly wanted to convey to her that when we are at someone else&#39;s house we may have to do things differently than at our own. I think your idea of making a cool new place for them is a good one and would work with my daughter in &quot;perfect&quot; conditions. As it was, with my husband and SIL arguing about it, it would not have worked because she already sensed it was a point of contention. Also I think that me and my mother-in-law tried something like that, to make a bed for them or something, but as I said Marisol was already resisting moving them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think you can expect to leave your child somewhere for an hour and even hope that those people will be you while you&#39;re gone.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with this. So then the decision is whether to leave your child with someone or to keep giving your child the choice. She is 3 years old and gets upset sometimes whether she is with us or someone else. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is when I know that I need to get better at being very clear with my posts. As it was, my post seemed long. By &quot;teach&quot; I mean having a rule, or forcing the issue when it isn&#39;t warranted, or not giving things or helping until the &quot;right&quot; words are spoken. We role model please and thank you ALL the time, AND Marisol says please and thank you spontaneously all the time -- I&#39;d say just about every day. She says &quot;Thank you Mama&quot;, and &quot;I love you Mama&quot; so many times a day it is almost ridiculous! I have also started to tell her when she is being extra demanding that there is a nicer way to ask me to do something, I have even said those oft repeated words, &quot;What do you say?&quot; But I really think that role modeling and saying thank you for them are powerful ways to help them learn these things. SO I don&#39;t think that I disagree with you Sandra. <br/>
<br/>
-=- She&#39;s right.  There are some things you just have to do.  &lt;g&gt; She&#39;s wrong, though, because some people choose never to choose, and so they go with the flow, like a stick in a river, until they get stuck somewhere.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is actually almost exactly what I was thinking. Yes, there are some things that you just have to do -- but I&#39;m pretty sure that the things that my MIL thinks you just &quot;have to do&quot; are not the same things that I think you have to do. <br/>
<br/>
-=- First you decide what you want, and then it makes it easier to decide what to do next year.  Do you stay at grandma&#39;s next year again?  It depends what your priorities are. If you stay again, can you prepare your daughter better for it?-=-<br/>

Definitely something I can work on, especially as she gets older.   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Already doing this more as my parents actually only live about 45 minutes from my in-laws. I used to stay with my in-laws with my daughter (when my husband wasn&#39;t with us), but I don&#39;t think that I will do that anymore. It is hard enough when he is there.<br/>
<br/>
Actually that is partly what is so hard for me. Figuring out how to communicate with these people who are now my &quot;family&quot; but so different from me. I have felt it is up to my husband to navigate but leaving it to him doesn&#39;t seem to be going so well! :-) When I am tired and feeling fed up I am more likely to feel drastic about the measures we should take, but I am more myself, optimistic and happy, I know that they are our family and I want to work things out for the best for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for your input!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574005036">Firstly I wanted to say to the OP that you have a 3 year old and a very young baby - it&#39;s a full-on time of your life so good on you for trying to parent mindfully and lovingly.  When I was in your position I was in the early stages of learning about unschooling/peaceful parenting.  I look back now and wish I could&#39;ve been more accommodating of my then three-year-old&#39;s quirks. As it is, my kids are now nearly 5 and 2.5, and I can tell you that things are definitely getting easier.  And one of the reasons for that is that I am more confident and calmer within myself.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the incident of the soft toy, there was clearly more going on than just a child&#39;s toy left on a bench. Your SIL is 33 and living with her parents. Presumably she doesn&#39;t have kids, probably has very little idea about how to interact with kids. So her getting stroppy about a toy on a bench says to me that she wasn&#39;t coping well with the whole situation. Plus it sounds like she and your husband have a fairly adversarial relationship, which would not have helped the situation. One solution could have been for your DH to get into puppet mode and get the toy to &#39;ask&#39; Marisol if it could come down and play with her. I&#39;ve found that if I turn something into a game, especially if I play the voice of a toy, kids often respond very well.<br/>
<br/>
Generally I have found that if I want happy playing within the rules of the house we are visiting, my calm presence is the biggest factor in ensuring that this will happen. I try to intervene in a way that is fun for the kids and saves face for our hosts. I don&#39;t tend to explain how things are at our house or my &#39;parenting philosophy&#39;. If there are tensions beyond my control, I keep the visit as short as possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-288691310">My problem in visiting the extended family is not<br/>
with the kids&#39; behavior; it&#39;s with the extended family<br/>
members.  Specifically, the kids are always getting <br/>
grilled on &quot;what are you learning?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are you doing in science these days?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are you studying in history?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Show me something you wrote.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I, likewise, am getting grilled on &quot;what are you <br/>
teaching them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My family and my husband&#39;s both include a lot of former <br/>
teachers and members of Boards of Education.  Well <br/>
meaning, traditional parents.  <br/>
<br/>
I actually got my father-in-law to read some Alfie Kohn, <br/>
but of course, he thought it was total bunk.<br/>
<br/>
My mother will say, in one breath, that she trusts me in<br/>
how I am educating my children, and then in the next breath<br/>
say, &quot;They&#39;ll be living with you forever, you know, and <br/>
completely ill-equipped to support themselves or do anything productive with their lives.&quot;  It so sad that she believes<br/>
that, and sad that her grandkids overhear her saying so.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody in the extended family is convinced that you need<br/>
to have an advanced degree in order to live a successful, <br/>
fulfilling life.  Since several of them are computer scientists,<br/>
I point to Bill Gates, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak (sp?) as<br/>
examples that this is simply not true.  And then I get, &quot;Well,<br/>
those successes happened in a specific place and time, and the<br/>
world isn&#39;t like that anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I recognize a fear-based statement for what it is, but just <br/>
seeing that the statement and the belief behind it are fear-fed, doesn&#39;t make it easier to face.  I don&#39;t know how to ease their <br/>
fears.  I could give them tons of stuff to read, and they&#39;d come <br/>
back with &quot;it&#39;s all bunk, bunk, bunk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I try to shut down these conversations/interrogations as politely<br/>
as I can, but &quot;we&#39;re just going to have to agree to disagree&quot; and <br/>
&quot;I am confident that the children are happy now, and learning what they need to learn, and that they will go on to lead fulfilling lives..&quot; doesn&#39;t ease the fears of a grandparent worried about the <br/>
grandchildren&#39;s current education and future possibilities.  I <br/>
point out that the kids are very active in their community and <br/>
have many adult role models and mentors.  The fears remain.<br/>
<br/>
I try to point out that the time we can spend together is limited,<br/>
and spending it arguing is a waste of a precious opportunity.<br/>
But when they are asking for me to assuage their fears, any<br/>
statement that I don&#39;t want to discuss their fears comes across<br/>
as conceited, or else defensive.  But how can I assuage their fears?<br/>
<br/>
Two kids are working &quot;above grade level&quot; (according to their age,<br/>
according to what grade they&#39;d be placed in public school), in<br/>
several subject areas.  (This is not a matter we focus on at home, <br/>
but it matters to the relatives.)  Still, the relatives focus on where the kids are &quot;below grade level.&quot;  I point out that the two <br/>
of the four kids have &quot;skipped&quot; grades because of high test scores <br/>
on year-end standardized tests--there&#39;s no point in arguing that those tests are ridiculous--but still, all they can focus on are <br/>
the areas where they think the kids should be doing more, doing better.  <br/>
<br/>
How on earth can I assuage their fears, so that they can see the beautiful children that they have in their lives right now, so that<br/>
they can just love them for who they are right now?<br/>
They are of the &quot;public school was good enough for me...&quot; and &quot;these kids are exceptionally bright; they should be working harder...&quot; schools of thought.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe grandparents and aunts and uncles are important to have in our lives, and I&#39;m afraid if I make a simple statement to the effect that how we raise our children is NOT a topic that is open for discussion, that is going to blow up into a situation where we just don&#39;t see the extended family any more.  And that would be a real loss.<br/>
<br/>
Still, when we are on our way to grandpa&#39;s house, and the kids are all taking turns role playing grandpa, and preparing answers to the questions they know he&#39;ll ask, translating their passions into educationalese, that seems sad to me.  The kids are aware that grandpa is not accepting them for who they are, but rather for what<br/>
they can accomplish.  Yes, they see that as a fault in grandpa, and not as a problem with themselves, but, still.  Likewise, when a child <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to share a wonderful story she wrote with grandma, &#39;cause she knows grandma is going to pick apart the grammar and spelling...<br/>
...well, it&#39;s a rift between them, and that&#39;s sad.<br/>
<br/>
I try to avoid conversations about homeschooling, but the relatives keep bringing &#39;em up.  I try to be vague:  &quot;Oh, they&#39;re doing very well.... followed by a brief synopsis of each of the kids current passions (leaving out the passion for gaming, which the extended family just cannot appreciate as educational).&quot;  But then we&#39;ll<br/>
play a board game together, and any mispronunciation on a game<br/>
card read aloud gets pounced on, any mistake in reading the roll<br/>
of the dice raises eyebrows.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be strident.  I want to be tactful.  But how to <br/>
manage it?  I am meeting my state&#39;s homeschooling regulatory requirements.  But the grandparents remain concerned, and I don&#39;t<br/>
know how to assuage those concerns.  If they believe that a fifth<br/>
grader should know standard grammar and punctuation, and should<br/>
spell better, then the fact that she did well enough on the required<br/>
end-of-year exam doesn&#39;t calm them.  The older the kids get, the<br/>
more fearful the extended family seems.  We are not &quot;out&quot; as <br/>
unschoolers, but if the kids don&#39;t start taking AP or community<br/>
college courses soon, I do expect that we are going to get a<br/>
lot more flack.  And truth to tell, the kids may very well NOT.<br/>
They may play a lot of computer games.  Read.  Ski, skate, swim,<br/>
kayak.  Train the dogs.  Grow a garden.  Cook and bake.  They may<br/>
or may not want to get a job when they are old enough to do so.  <br/>
They may or may not go to college when they are 18.  They may<br/>
not go ever. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe family visits aren&#39;t worth facing all this emotional toxicity,<br/>
but the kids love their grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.<br/>
Seems like I need a better way to be a buffer; I just don&#39;t know<br/>
how to do it.  Has anybody successfully managed this and have <br/>
BTDT advice for us?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256189351">Sorry I sent a blank.   I  meant to ask, when you said you weren&#39;t out  <br/>
as unschoolers, did that mean your family didn&#39;t know you were  <br/>
unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
The way I dealt with not arguing with my in-laws was kind of like  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s how do you lift a bell?  Build a foundation.  But I didn&#39;t  <br/>
know I was doing it.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was days old, his grandmother (a nurse) came to visit and I  <br/>
offered to let her change him (which I thought would be sweet, but she  <br/>
acted like it was supid), and when she came back she said &quot;You have to  <br/>
get him circumcised.&quot;  Not in a friendly way.  In a &quot;no question about  <br/>
it&quot; way.  Like we were ignorant parents.<br/>
<br/>
I said we had decided not to and that we had read a lot about it  <br/>
before we decided.   She clearly showed disdain, and I asked her if  <br/>
she wanted to read what we had read (me very nicely, her kind snorty  <br/>
and eye-rolling).  She said &quot;I&#39;ll read it, but it&#39;s not going to  <br/>
change my mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I put sticky notes in three or four books, on the circumcision  <br/>
section, and she took them overnight (they were trailer camping  <br/>
nearby, on their way back from Alaska, to Alamogordo).<br/>
<br/>
The next day she brought them back and set them very quietly, gently,  <br/>
*respectfully* on the table where she got them and said &quot;Well things  <br/>
have changed since I went to nursing school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t say &quot;NO SHIT, SHIRLEY!&quot;   And I never said any harsh  <br/>
thing to her, ever, and she never did die until this year.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby didn&#39;t go to school, she asked, and I said we read a lot  <br/>
about it and did she want to read what we had read.  Same tone of  <br/>
voice, like I was quoting myself, but not sarcastically at all.  And  <br/>
she said no, that&#39;s okay, thanks or something, but  nicely.<br/>
<br/>
When he was seven or so she asked if we were going to get him tested.   <br/>
We were at a restaurant; all the kids were at the table.  I said no.   <br/>
She asked how would we know if he was behind.   I said I was sure he  <br/>
WAS behind in some areas, and that he was ahead in some other ones.  I  <br/>
said kids at school are behind in some things and ahead in others, and  <br/>
I put food in my mouth, and she didn&#39;t say anything else.<br/>
<br/>
My mantra, though, when people would express vague misgivings or want  <br/>
to talk about it, was that if this stopped working we could put them  <br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
To schoolteacher friends, though, I would say cheerily that if this  <br/>
didn&#39;t work we could always put him in special ed and they&#39;d get him  <br/>
all caught up.  They&#39;d sputter (or spit, if they had coffee in their  <br/>
mouths &lt;g&gt;) and laugh, because they knew and they  knew that I knew  <br/>
that special ed does not &quot;get kids all caught up.&quot;  One of those  <br/>
friends was an award-winning, master&#39;s degree special ed teacher,  <br/>
too.  She got it, when I said that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also sometimes remind them that there was a school within walking  <br/>
distance, and it was free, and he could go there if he wanted to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341198554">My in-laws are so anti-homeschooling, esp. RU.  My mother in law is just a disagreeable person anhyow.  With the exeception of her negativity towards RU, she is a very loving Grandma to my kids and they love to spend time with her.  When she grills my kids about what they are &quot;learning&quot;,  can they read yet, what math are you doing... I have just told my kids to answer whatever they will or they can just say, &quot;Ask my Mom&quot; and I will be more than happy to handle it for them.<br/>
<br/>
My mother in law has mostly given up buggin us about it.  Yipee.<br/>
<br/>
My sister in law, who just graduated with a masters in child physcology, and has no children of her own.... likes to make little comments to me about how my kids need STRUCTURE and more sit down learning time.  Whoa to the family that gets her as their advisor...<br/>
<br/>
She also says that we baby our kids and is appauled that our 2 littlest still sleep in our room (8 & 10).  My oldest moved out of our room around 10 because he wanted his own space.  I once tried to explain why we allow our kids to be with us all the time and how much we love spending time with them and how much they love spending time with us.  She just doesn&#39;t get it, so I just smile, knod my head and say okay, thanks for the advice.  Then go on my merry way.  I feel so sad for her when she has her children, most of her parenting advice will be so dispelled.  Or the poor kids will be really f.ed up, how sad.<br/>
<br/>
As for me and mine, we just continue on our adventure allowing ourselves to learn through life and just smile and pass over others who strongly disagree and don&#39;t want to learn from us.</div>

I parent Margaux differently than I parented Chamille because of this!  They are 7 yrs apart, enough for me to know more and see things in a different light.  There were things I worried about with Chamille that I just simply don&#39;t worry about with Margaux, because there are bigger things in life than those weird things like what a movie is rated and how late a child stays up at night, or whether she reads by the age of &quot;whatever&quot;.<br/>

You can turn that around you know.  Ask how many kids pass every class every year, ask for specific statistics.  Your kids should not be held up to the top 1% of every school child out there.  I hope that you weren&#39;t when you were a child!  Remember that for every child that gets an &quot;A&quot; in a subject in school there is a polar opposite or barely passing child in that very same class.  Not every student can receive an &quot;A&quot;, administrators frown on that... if everyone got A&#39;s, then A&#39;s would lose their value and a new system for student measurement would need to be invented.<br/>

Please don&#39;t refer to it as &quot;RU.&quot;  On this list, please say  <br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;  And if in your mind, in your thoughts, you think  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; instead of &quot;RU&quot; or &quot;radical unschooling,&quot; I think it  <br/>
will settle down some of the drama and angst and antagonism.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s good when people can pull it off.<br/>
<br/>
If people go on their merry way (they think) but the way is really a  <br/>
trail of grumbling and resentment, that too will mar the unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For the general question, maybe shorter and less frequent visits to  <br/>
professional educators and child psychologists and school board  <br/>
members (current or past) who happen to also be relatives would take  <br/>
some of the pressure off everyone.  It can&#39;t be easy for the  <br/>
relatives, either, if they see you as people who &quot;strongly disagree  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804638953">I&#39;m glad you wrote that, because I was just about to come here and ask a question about how to handle rudeness.  Ezabella just turned 4 and is usually polite, but more lately, she&#39;s been acting kind of rude.  Things like &quot;GET ME SOME FOOD!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been responding by saying things like &quot;You&#39;re being rude.  Try again&quot; and she almost always turns on a sweet voice and says &quot;Get me some food please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also said things like, &quot;How about, &#39;I&#39;m hungry, I need some food please&#39;&quot; or some other script. <br/>
<br/>
Or it&#39;s been happening so much lately that at this point I can just say &quot;I need some food please mom&quot; and she&#39;ll repeat back &quot;I need some food please mom.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Or sometimes, depending on everyone&#39;s mood, I&#39;ll just be playful and say &quot;Food?  No way!&quot; (which totally doesn&#39;t come across right in writing, but it&#39;s totally playful and she giggles and then acts nicer).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also said &quot;I cannot understand you when you&#39;re whinning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, on the one hand, I think maybe I&#39;m not handling this well.  I always hated when my mom critisized anything I said.  For now, Ezabella doesn&#39;t seem to mind.  I try to either be lighthearted about it or sometimes if she&#39;s being really rude I&#39;ll use my serious mom voice.  She almost always changes her tone or words.  But lately we&#39;ve been going through this every day, sometimes a few times a day, and I&#39;m afraid that it is going to cause resentment about me always &quot;correcting&quot; her.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think that I&#39;m handling it well.  I&#39;m not punishing her, I don&#39;t withhold anything, in fact I&#39;m usually getting up to get her what she wants as I&#39;m reminding her to ask nicely.  I&#39;m not mean about it, but I am firm sometimes especially if she does it to someone else.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you all think?<br/>

getting the straight As.  (Never mind that they would be miserable.)<br/>
So my kids&#39; grandparents are sure I am wasting their childhoods, setting them up for failure in later life, and all that.  In<br/>
their minds, being the ones getting the straight As is the whole<br/>
point of going to school, and they are sure that this is the only<br/>
path to a happy life.<br/>

I keep reading Amy Childs essay about her teen son, and his path<br/>
to his MBA, and more importantly, about how her faith in him<br/>
allowed their relationship to blossom through those teen years,<br/>
and so much of that essay rings true for me.  But that same essay<br/>
would make no sense to my parents and my in-laws.<br/>

I think shorter and fewer visits with the extended family are<br/>
necessary.  It&#39;s too bad.  It really is.<br/>

Wow -- flashback!!  Here in the State of Victoria, Australia, when I was in Year 11, 1990 (16?) the HSC (High School Certificate) went through administrative changes to become the VCE (Victorian Education Certificate).  I remember we were told we were the &#39;guinea pigs&#39; of higher school education.  Anyway, we were advised that the percentage of students to get an &#39;A&#39; was, say, 20%, &#39;B&#39; say, 40%, etc, etc . . . you get the picture.  This does not/did not make sense!!  As students, we pondered just what Would happen if All students did extrememly well.  We determined to not bother trying to excel, as Others would be Chosen above us; those Usually in the top 20%, that is.  Most importantly, we were Well Aware that it had all become a numbers game -- our individuality had been overided.  Sad.<br/>

on<br/>
how to help communicate to her that the volume just needs to be a little<br/>
lower or for her to move locations so that she understands what I&#39;m  <br/>
telling<br/>
her. It&#39;s been a real problem with trying to get the baby to sleep and<br/>
there is a hyena in the room! :)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes talking softly to the person helps bring the volume back  <br/>
down.  It&#39;s hard for some people (me, sometimes) to know they&#39;ve  <br/>
gotten really loud.  Keith and Marty are both bad about that, and  <br/>
they&#39;re way older than four.    Some people are louder than others.<br/>
<br/>
Some families have the concept of &quot;indoor voice&quot; or &quot;library  <br/>
voice&quot; (though libraries aren&#39;t as quiet as they used to be).<br/>
<br/>
Modelling and discussing being quiet when it&#39;s not about her or the  <br/>
baby might help, gradually.  I used to find times to say &quot;Let&#39;s be  <br/>
extra quiet, because it&#39;s still early,&quot; or &quot;Dad&#39;s sleeping--could you  <br/>
play with soft stuff instead?&quot;   And sometimes I&#39;d say it when we were  <br/>
out and about, not always at the house.   Playing at a park in broad  <br/>
daylight, screaming and yelling is not bad.  Walking the dog at night,  <br/>
we&#39;d talk quietly.<br/>

their grandparents. You could do it kind of subtly, perhaps, by just <br/>
making little comments about the importance of grandparents to kids - <br/>
and throw in there how it is so great to have grandparents because THEY <br/>
don&#39;t pressure their grandkids, they just love them so unconditionally, <br/>
etc. Mention the special relationship between grandparents and <br/>
grandchildren, how nice it must be not to have to WORRY about them, just <br/>
love and enjoy them as they are. Stuff like that.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are some subject areas where the schools don&#39;t seem to mind giving <br/>
lots of A&#39;s and B&#39;s --- but in most academic worlds (high school and <br/>
college level, at least), there is always an expectation of a certain <br/>
grade distribution.<br/>
<br/>
But, when students ask if a course is graded &quot;on a curve&quot; the answer is <br/>
usually &quot;no.&quot; We don&#39;t just automatically give the top 10 percent an &quot;A&quot; <br/>
and the next 20 percent a &quot;B.&quot;  That&#39;s not how it works - things are <br/>
much more tricky than that.<br/>
<br/>
The way it works, in reality, is that a teacher sets up a grading system <br/>
based on points earned or percentage of points earned. So, to an <br/>
individual student, it looks like if they can earn 90 percent of the <br/>
possible points, they can get an A. True enough, on the surface.<br/>
<br/>
But when we teachers turn in the grades for ALL the students, those <br/>
grades had better fall roughly into the expected grade distribution, or <br/>
we will be questioned or even called on the carpet or (in the case of <br/>
part-time faculty) not re-hired.<br/>
<br/>
In my field, and in most &quot;academic&quot; fields, the expected grade <br/>
distribution is something like 10 percent As, 20 percent B&#39;s, and 30 to <br/>
50 percent C&#39;s and the rest D&#39;s and F&#39;s.  Nobody holds to these hard and <br/>
fast, but woe to the teacher who would dare to give, say, 30 percent <br/>
A&#39;s. Different schools and different departments may have different <br/>
grade distribution expectations, but they exist and those teachers who <br/>
don&#39;t follow them will hear about it from their dean or department head.<br/>
<br/>
Faculty have two ways to make sure our grades come reasonably close to <br/>
the expected distribution. First, just based on experience, we make the <br/>
material just difficult enough that we can expect the grades to fall <br/>
into the desired distribution. If we have a semester that the grades are <br/>
too high, we make the tests a little harder. Second, a significant part <br/>
of the grade is always subjective. By the time we are grading the <br/>
subjective part of the course, it is usually a term paper of some sort, <br/>
we already can see how the grades are turning out and we can grade <br/>
harder or easier depending on if we think too many people are getting <br/>
too high or too low grades. Many teachers have a &quot;participation&quot; <br/>
component to their grading, too, which is subjective. In my courses, the <br/>
material is very difficult and I give extra credit to help students <br/>
raise their grades. I can control how much extra credit I offer in such <br/>
a way that I can move about 10 percent of the students into the A&#39;s and <br/>
about 20 percent into the B&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
This is the reality of every college I have ever worked for - and I&#39;ve <br/>
worked at a LOT of them -- maybe 15 different colleges over the past <br/>
30-plus years.<br/>
<br/>
So - it will usually be worked out just as if it had been graded on a <br/>
curve, but there will be the illusion that every student in the class <br/>
could earn an A.<br/>
<br/>
My kids understand this system very well, having grown up with a parent <br/>
teaching college courses and hanging out at colleges their whole lives. <br/>
They don&#39;t take grades very seriously in the sense that they don&#39;t <br/>
believe in the slightest that the grade reflects what they have truly <br/>
&quot;gotten out of&quot; the course. They totally separate &quot;learning&quot; from <br/>
&quot;grading.&quot; They understand very well that the grade measures something <br/>
different - partly it is psyching out the teacher and guessing what will <br/>
be on the tests, partly it is how much time you spend on detail - the <br/>
kind of minutia that IS so often asked on tests, party it is bias on the <br/>
part of the teacher (once the teacher thinks of you as a top student, <br/>
turns out you can slack off a bit and they&#39;ll still grade you higher <br/>
than other students), A big chunk of good grades is being very very very <br/>
careful to fully follow directions. Some of good grades is just good <br/>
test-taking. Some of it is willingness to be bored - to study the stuff <br/>
that is going to be on the test, rather than focusing on learning what <br/>
seems interesting and important.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I think, said something earlier in this conversation about how <br/>
unschooled kids can go to college and be more able to withstand a system <br/>
of grades, etc., all the school stuff they&#39;ve not had to deal with as <br/>
unschoolers. That has been our experience. However, I do think <br/>
unschooling parents should be aware that, yes, going to college DOES <br/>
mean stepping into that school-think world and should help their kids <br/>
analyze it and consider how they want to approach it.<br/>
<br/>
When Roya (now 25 yo) was a student at Cal State Long Beach, she was <br/>
studying with a group of friends and she told me later that she&#39;d gotten <br/>
a little exasperated with them and told them that if they&#39;d think more <br/>
about what they could learn in the class and less about grades, that the <br/>
grades would be better. She said they were distracted and unfocused <br/>
because they were constantly worrying about grades.<br/>
<br/>
I took a college class last semester just for fun - I took ASL, which is <br/>
taught as a foreign language course.  I was very much enjoying the <br/>
course and then, suddenly, it was time for the first test and I was <br/>
taken by surprise at how much tension that created. I had to talk myself <br/>
down, a couple of times, from being anxious over it. I had to remind <br/>
myself that I was there to learn ASL, not to get a grade for taking a <br/>
class in ASL. That was a very very different attitude than I had had <br/>
when I was an actual college student. So I talked to myself, reminded <br/>
myself that the test was a good time to review and sort of intensely <br/>
practice all that we&#39;d covered so far - I got myself to use the occasion <br/>
of a test to focus a little more on what I was learning. It worked and, <br/>
yes, I probably got an A in the course, but, to be honest, I haven&#39;t <br/>
even gone to my school account to check my grade because I really did <br/>
talk myself into NOT thinking about it and, I keep forgetting to check.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a college and graduate school student, I thought about grades <br/>
all the time. My goal was to do just the right amount of work to get the <br/>
A, but not waste my time doing extra. I didn&#39;t think about learning for <br/>
its own sake at all - not EVER. I only thought about what would be on <br/>
the test.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling helped ME get over this awful attitude. My kids don&#39;t have <br/>
to get over it - they don&#39;t have it to start with. They do care about <br/>
their college grades, but for completely rational reasons - they see <br/>
grades for what they are and good grades can get you things <br/>
(scholarships, good driver car insurance discounts, etc). They don&#39;t at <br/>
ALL see grades as reflections of their value as a person or even as <br/>
reflections of how much they&#39;ve learned in the class.<br/>

anyone I advise that this inclination is one reason to not<br/>
procrastinate....to not count on pulling it all together at the end.    Work<br/>
very, very, hard at the beginning of a course.   If it is a course that<br/>
requires &quot;papers&quot; then make sure the first paper &quot;blows them away&quot;.   If<br/>
your first paper is great then you can slide a long way on the last paper<br/>
and still get an &quot;A&quot;.  In some cases I think the dirty little instructor<br/>
secret is that the last papers or &quot;term&quot; papers of &quot;good&quot; students aren&#39;t<br/>
even read!.<br/>
<br/>
The same can also apply to tests if there is ever any leeway on how it is<br/>
graded.  A student who &quot;usually&quot; does well on tests will often find that<br/>
some mercy points will be given even on objective test questions.<br/>

 <br/>
I haven&#39;t been involved in a school system in a long time because I&#39;ve been really trying to live as if school didn&#39;t exist, but every once in a while it gets slammed into our lives and I do a bit of searching online.<br/>
 <br/>
Chamille&#39;s boyfriend was recently grounded from her because of failing a class.  This entire concept rocked Chamille&#39;s world, the fact that a person&#39;s very being could be seen as good or bad based on a letter grade, or percentage in a class given to another person by a complete stranger, then interpreted by a parent as somehow completely and absolutely about their child&#39;s character, good or bad.  Then to have the parent act on this and use it to discipline and guide the child to do it differently and somehow be &quot;good&quot; or better just added more confusion.  In her mind, if the grade itself was a system to measure or dole out rewards and punishments to get a student to do better, then shouldn&#39;t that be enough? <br/>
 <br/>
What we&#39;ve found is that it rarely is.  Over and over, parents and schools push kids to get better grades, to do better, to be &quot;good&quot; within that system.  The reality is that it makes very little difference because the system itself isn&#39;t designed to work that way.  The high school that Chamille&#39;s boyfriend goes to is implementing this new program this year and like all new programs in schools, it&#39;s presented as this positive and wonderful thing to help student achieve better scores and get better grades so that the kids can be better people.  The wording is all peaches and roses.  The reality that the school faces is that 17%, an actual statistic from that high school, of all incoming freshman will fail a required class in that first year of high school.  Since the school is required to have a certain level of passing students to continue getting funding, then for that school, a 17% failure rate is pretty dismal indeed.<br/>
 <br/>
So they created a program called &quot;homework in the now&quot;, and guess where the burden always lies... with the student.  It&#39;s presented as this great program to give students who have failed a class a way to get their grade up.  Sounds ok on the surface, but this is what really happens... the students are forced to do a study hall during their lunch hour and if they miss it or are late it&#39;s counted against them and they get detentions or saturday school.  Each student gets about 5 min to get their lunch and take it to their study room.  Most of the students don&#39;t even have time to stand in line to get their lunch.  Not only that, it violates their own student handbook policy that clearly states that no student will be denied their lunch break.  Yet no kid is going to say anything because the school does this program without the parents knowledge or permission, unless the parent is really really aware of everything that goes on in school and I find that<br/>
 most parents don&#39;t.<br/>
 <br/>
The school even admits that it&#39;s not even aiming to eliminate failure, it&#39;s only looking to raise that 17% to 10%.  All those students get subjected to this &quot;homework in the now&quot; program thinking they have the potential to raise their grade and that they WILL raise their grade or stay in the program until they do, yet only a few, less than half are going to do that.  The rest of them just miss lunch for the entire year.<br/>
 <br/>
The conclusion that I always come to is that all these kids jump through hoops to meet benchmarks set up without even knowing that most of them won&#39;t make them.  Schools set kids up to fail, yet talk about creating successful future people.  I&#39;m so glad that I found unschooling and walked away from that system.  I try very hard to set my kids up to succeed!  It shows too!<br/>
