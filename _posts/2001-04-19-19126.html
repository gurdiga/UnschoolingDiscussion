<div id="ygrps-yiv-725681669"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I have a harder time deciding how to handle the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ooooooo, tough question.  I guess it would entirely<br/>
depend on the maturity of the child.  Even very young<br/>
children are able to understand, sometimes with more<br/>
sophistication than adults, that some people hurt the<br/>
feelings of others, or treat them in ways that are not<br/>
so nice, even when the offending person is themselves<br/>
not a bad person.  <br/>
<br/>
For an older child I might use such instances as a<br/>
learning tool to point out why Mr. Bond is always<br/>
alone, barring his brief encounters.  I would try to<br/>
get them involved in a discussion about what they<br/>
think he does that might not be appropriate and why he<br/>
might do that.  I would also want to talk about the<br/>
other side of the coin, as to why his partners might<br/>
choose him, and what they do that might be bad<br/>
choices.  For an even older child it might be<br/>
appropriate to discuss sexual roles in culture and why<br/>
it it thought of as amusing and cool that James Bond<br/>
is a playboy, or why women in these movies are seen as<br/>
objects or pleasure and decoration for Bond,<br/>
particularly in the older films.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to explain these paradoxes in our<br/>
culture.  Sex appeal is a marketing tool, and playboys<br/>
are seen as dashing, handsome and exciting in the<br/>
media, while in actual life (yours and mine) they are<br/>
hurtful and sad.  Good luck and keep us posted so that<br/>
we may benefit from your experience!<br/>

<div><tt>This is exactly what I was trying to get at! I don&#39;t know how to 
explain this! Do you know of any books, articles, etc. that talk about this 
stuff? I think I also need to think through more carefully my own thoughts about 
all of this. I came to adulthood in the 60&#39;s and although I&#39;m in a very stable 
and monogamous relationship now, it hasn&#39;t always been so. I think I need to 
reconcile my experiences with what I would like to pass on to my child. Oh, I&#39;m 
so confused ....</tt></div>

 </span></blockquote>We had an interesting occurrence at dinner. Ds (10yo)<br/>
had a friend over. I was pretending to be in love with<br/>
my chocolate mousse, being a mad chocolate fiend like<br/>
I am, hugging it (yeah, we&#39;re silly) and my husband<br/>
was pretending to be jealous. So ds started kissing<br/>
his chocolate mousse. Little pecks on the dessert<br/>
dish. His friend asked him, &quot;Do you love her?&quot; Ds<br/>
replied, &quot;He, it&#39;s a boy.&quot; His friend said, &quot;Oh, are<br/>
you gay then?&quot; Ds replied, &quot;No, it&#39;s not my husband,<br/>
it&#39;s my baby.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The gay question was asked nonchalantly and without<br/>
any hint of judgment. It was answered nonchalantly and<br/>
without any hint of defensiveness. <br/>
<br/>
A new generation of tolerance? <br/>
