The games playing habits of 700 7- to 16-year-olds is the subject<br/>
of new research carried out by directors, Professor Angela<br/>
McFarlane, who holds a Chair in Education at Bristol University,<br/>
Ysanne Heald and Anne Sparrowhawk, of Teachers Evaluating<br/>
Educational Multimedia (TEEM) on behalf of the DfES.<br/>
<br/>
The report reveals the many important benefits that children<br/>
acquire as a result of playing computer games.<br/>
<br/>
The research, which gathered information from teachers, parents<br/>
and pupils, shows that children learn a range of strategic<br/>
thinking and planning skills that teachers find beneficial to<br/>
their pupils&#39; learning.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than games playing being a solitary, male-orientated<br/>
activity, the report demonstrates that children prefer to play in<br/>
pairs and small groups, and are excited and motivated with the<br/>
challenges that games provide.<br/>
