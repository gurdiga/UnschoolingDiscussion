<div id="ygrps-yiv-303189682">Just a quick note to those who&#39;ve asked about the books I offered - <br/>
I&#39;m getting quite a number of these messages from our server:<br/>

I/O error encountered<br/>

Now I&#39;m not sure what all that really means, but if you wrote to me <br/>
about the books and haven&#39;t heard back yet that might be the reason. <br/>
Some seem to go through, others don&#39;t, with no apparent rhyme or <br/>
reason. We&#39;ve been having trouble with our ISP all day long... <br/>
Wonderful timing, eh?<br/>
