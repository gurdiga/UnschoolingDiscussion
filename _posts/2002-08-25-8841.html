creatures who live in his very curly, thick hair. Many of them seem to have <br/>
issues...there is a squirrel who thinks it&#39;s a pigeon for example. The have <br/>
been know to build condos and other structures. Many recently climbed Everest <br/>
in a special expedition. We often have conversations with these beings. It <br/>
may LOOK like we&#39;re are talking to our son&#39;s hand, but it&#39;s really a squirrel <br/>
or other critter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984042436">My oldest son, David, now 21, used to have little people that lived <br/>
in his hands. They would fight with each other most nights when he <br/>
would get ready for bed. He had names for each of them, but I don&#39;t <br/>
remember them. He also had an alter ego named Rudy Patudi that he <br/>
blamed for everything that he got in trouble for doing. &quot;I didn&#39;t do <br/>
it! Rudy Patudi did!&quot; When he was around 11, he started telling <br/>
everyone,&quot;I was never a baby! I was dropped off by aliens at the age <br/>
I am now&quot;. In fact, he still says that! :-)<br/>
