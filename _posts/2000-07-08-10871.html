I&#39;m here, Vicki (not much of a poster, and during these busy days not even
a very good &quot;lurker!&quot; &lt;g&gt;).
<p>I conceded my&nbsp; &quot;expert&quot; hat on this subject to Mark Hegener, who,
after all, started homeschooling while I was only knee-high to a grasshopper
&lt;g&gt;.&nbsp; While he&#39;s equally as busy, he sent the following for me
to share here:

&nbsp;&nbsp; You can argue until the cows come home about causation/determination

&nbsp;&nbsp; homeschooling our community bent over backwards to make them feel
&nbsp;&nbsp; welcome. It was not until the political types who followed these
&nbsp;&nbsp; families and, as their leaders, started to organize them into voting
&nbsp;&nbsp; blocks that we saw problems.

<p>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; it was only later, in the 1980s when large numbers of
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fundamentalists found their small church schools closed because
of tax
<br>&gt;&gt; &gt;laws, that
<p>Vicki:&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; can you explain more about how tax laws closed small church schools?&nbsp;
Was
<br>&gt;&gt; this a problem only in certain areas or states?
<br>&gt;&gt;
<br>&gt;&gt; Are you referring to &quot;tax laws&quot;&nbsp; denying exemptions if property
was used
<br>for
<br>&gt;&gt; a commercial business?
<br>&gt;
<br>&gt;This one, as I understand it (Linda Dobson is the expert in this area.)
<p>Is Linda on this list ?&nbsp;&nbsp; (I sometimes get confused remembering
where I have
<br>seen folks)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If so,&nbsp; could we&nbsp;&nbsp; hear
a bit more?&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not arguing that
<br>there was not a big increase in having school at home among certain
<br>fundamentalist&nbsp; groups.&nbsp; My question concerns a mass shutdown
of church
<br>schools and whether that was a causative factor.
