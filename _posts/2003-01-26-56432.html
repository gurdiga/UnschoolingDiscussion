<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<time>26 Jan 2003, at 11:31am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906718227">I was telling some friends from work about how someone tried to hack us the other night and how we found the guy, and are pursuing it with his ISP, etc.  We were so proud of ourselves for catching the guy (at least we *think* we have).<br/>
I was sharing an exciting story.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what the first thing they asked me was?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What is an 11 year old doing chatting on the internet anyway?  You can&#39;t just let kids chat with ANYONE!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
UGH!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
They completely missed the point.  No harm was done and we all learned A LOT.  I bet I can say with 100% certainty that my kids will never make that mistake again BECAUSE of this experience...not because of any advice I gave them before.  And NOW they know how to track someone who does this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
UGH again.<br/>

<br/>
Today is even more important than tomorrow because &quot;today&quot; is a gift, and &quot;tomorrow&quot; might never come.<br/>
<br/>
Today is where hope lives because today is when we can make things better than yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing we can be sure of is today and life isn&#39;t worth living if it isn&#39;t lived in joy for as many moments of today as we can manage.<br/>
