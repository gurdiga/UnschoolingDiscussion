<div id="ygrps-yiv-835646120">The other night we had two of our sons friends sleep over. The two boys both <br/>
attend school and one is two years older and has some family stresses. Im not <br/>
fond of him bc he leaves a trail of trouble but I feel bad bc his parents have <br/>
been fighting and his mom has a drinking problem (Got a DWI last week). I <br/>
took the boys to Walmart with me bc they wanted to go. I found when I got there <br/>
that they only wanted to go so they could take their skateboards which I have <br/>
safety concerns with (at Walmart) and my son knows this. He didn&#39;t speak up to <br/>
them and say no until they listened. I listened to them interact and its just <br/>
sad. My son is soo different with this kid.<br/>
<br/>
Later in the night the boys came in about 10:30 from jumping on the <br/>
trampoline. We had some nice conversations about unschooling. We talked about me as a <br/>
parent and how &quot;cool&quot; they think I am. Well, I had said to them &quot;you know im <br/>
not a strict parent all I ask is to know where my son is going and that he is <br/>
making good choices.<br/>
My son popped his head in my room around 11ish and said &quot;were going to bed <br/>
now Mom.&quot; I KNEW something was up he never does that. I thought for a sec and <br/>
then said to my self no, Laura your going to trust his judgement..........&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well,.... Some time after 11:30 ish one of the boys (the one with the <br/>
troubled family) pretty much nagged my son and the other boy to go egging. At some <br/>
point walking down the street my son began to cry and ran home. He told the kid <br/>
you know I cant do this my mom will be so upset. More pressure from the boy <br/>
and they ended up going. They egged two houses and one is a family that dislikes <br/>
us bc we HS. Its my understanding that my son didn&#39;t throw one at this house <br/>
but rather the older boy did. We told him that just bc he didn&#39;t throw it he <br/>
still was there. The family knows we are not too impressed with them and they <br/>
the same. They have been looking for a reason to be irritated with us.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight the daughter of the family said to the older boy in IM that her <br/>
parents think it was my son. My thoughts on this are why do they think it was my <br/>
kid? He has never done anything the hurt anyone or break the law why my kid?<br/>
<br/>
I am very upset inside that he caves into peer pressure. Im sad that he <br/>
didn&#39;t stand up to the boy. I didn&#39;t yell, I didn&#39;t punish but I did speak with <br/>
him. The last couple days he has been pretty close to my side and has apologized <br/>
a few times. Because the situation with the family and us isn&#39;t good and they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t believe he didn&#39;t throw the egg we all (three families) choose to say <br/>
nothing. I feel guilt, I feel dishonest and I know they are going to find out.<br/>
I have been not wanting to say he cannot play with this boy but in light of <br/>
this situation I dont think anything good is going to come from this <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts? Has anyone experienced this? What unschooly~parental step did I <br/>
miss?<br/>

<br/>
Did you talk to the older boy?  Did you TELL him that you&#39;re unwilling to <br/>
risk your peaceful homeschooling life for his reckless behavior?  Did you <br/>
consider telling the neighbors who did throw the eggs, or threatening the boy with <br/>
telling?  Did you consider taking the two boys over there to apologize and clean <br/>
up the mess?<br/>
<br/>
Treating children like people sometimes involves treating them as you would <br/>
treat adult friends, and just saying &quot;NO, don&#39;t even think of pissing off my <br/>
neighbors.&quot;  I wouldn&#39;t cover for adult friends who threw eggs.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want an adult roommate to say &quot;I&#39;m going to bed&quot; and then sneak <br/>
out.   It&#39;s SO not okay on many, many levels.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Well, I had said to them &quot;you know im <br/>
not a strict parent all I ask is to know where my son is going and that he is <br/>
making good choices.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I would have gotten my husband to help me verbally intimidate <br/>
the other boy BIGTIME.   He probably has no clue how much risk he&#39;s put you <br/>
at, but you could let him know.   If an adult friend or roommate were using your <br/>
house to sell drugs, or provide liquor to minors, or whatever other illegal <br/>
thing, would you cower and lie?  I doubt it.  Don&#39;t let a child use your eggs <br/>
and your house to hide in and just hide.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have it in you to pressure the kids to apologize and clean, <br/>
maybe write a letter to the family saying you know which boys were involved, and <br/>
that you have spoken with them (IF you speak to them).  It might keep them from <br/>
assuming your son is guilty for years to come.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told my kids that they are not to be out late on school nights because I <br/>
don&#39;t want any trouble with social services at ALL, and being homeschoolers <br/>
makes us more conspicuous.   I remind them when they forget.  One friend of <br/>
Marty&#39;s is a bad influence, but I look him right in the face and say &quot;No.&quot;  And <br/>
&quot;no&quot; means you can go home or you can stay here and stop posturing and <br/>
monkeying.<br/>

Aren&#39;t you glad? Sounds like a pretty good experience for him to have.  <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be too upset - learning happens the hard way sometimes. <br/>
He&#39;ll get stronger and will have experience for when more dangerous <br/>
pressures hit him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d think you&#39;d want to &#39;fess up and clean up or make amends to the <br/>
families whose houses got egged though. You could do the talking for <br/>
him - say, &quot;We&#39;re really sorry this happened and want to make it up to <br/>
you somehow.&quot; Or maybe he could write them a note? Or he could help you <br/>
bake a cake and give it to them with a card on which he can say, &quot;This <br/>
is how I&#39;ll be using eggs from now on.&quot; I think you&#39;d both feel much <br/>
better if you did find a way for him to make amends.<br/>

Yes, I did speak to them but I have not spoken to the boy about his <br/>
friendship with my son that will be ending. He is not allowed to leave his house but <br/>
has been ringing my phone off the hook.<br/>
<br/>
IN the am I did speak to the boys and this is what was said: My son was in <br/>
his room and the two other boys were in the tv room. I spoke to my son first <br/>
while they slept. I asked him who got egged and who did what house and WHY. He <br/>
told me the older boy came in to his room and ripped his blankets off and said <br/>
&quot;lets go!&quot; I know he did say no several times and it was a big step for him. <br/>
(thank you Sandra for reminding me of that)<br/>
<br/>
I then went to the tv room with my husband. I asked them both what happened. <br/>
At first the older boy told me he didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. I <br/>
cleared that up for him...They said what my son said except the part about him <br/>
running back home in tears. I asked about that and they said yes he did.<br/>
<br/>
I told them that I was sorry but I would need to call their parents. I asked <br/>
if either one would be hit by their parents (I suspected the older one but <br/>
after some delay he finally answered a no and said I talk to my parents). The <br/>
other boy and I spoke before went home. He began to cry. I wanted to cry with <br/>
him, I kinda did just less tears.<br/>
I told him I was sorry this happened. I told him how important it is not to <br/>
cave to pressure when you know its not kind. I told him soon this will pass but <br/>
for now 5 minutes of fun has now turned into prob a few months of no play (I <br/>
knew his dad would ground him for months and he did). My husband and I spoke <br/>
to the dad and he has had many issues with the older boy and the boy was <br/>
actually banned from their home. I think my son and his will continue to play in a <br/>
few days but the older boy will need to go back to his old friends.<br/>
<br/>
As far as going to apologize considering the people its not a good idea. We <br/>
talked about it (all three families) and they are not people who physically <br/>
treat children any different than adults.  <br/>
<br/>
Ive spoken to my son and he knows to say no next time anyone pressures him. <br/>
We have spoken about this several times this weekend and its clear.<br/>
<br/>
This was tuff to post but I am an all or nothing person. Just a few days ago <br/>
I am an unschooling mom of four unschooling successfully and now my son eggs <br/>
someone&#39;s house, gesh.... <br/>
(Sandra)I listened to the three tapes today (to see what one would be good <br/>
for my friend) on Peaceful parenting, Unschooling gracefully and unschooling <br/>
explained (I think that the name) and I feel way better. Turns out there were <br/>
some messages for me on there also. Before I was feeling like a failure and <br/>
bummed my son made a bad decision. Now I feel we can get passed it. A living and <br/>
learning experience that taught us all that we are human and do make mistakes.<br/>

***************<br/>
<br/>
We had an incident here involving a neighbor boy tonight. I won&#39;t go into the details, but suffice it to say that somehow we have a lot of losers for neighbors. He is 15 I think. <br/>
<br/>
I called him tonight on the phone and told him if he ever did anything like that again, I was coming after him.<br/>
<br/>
I have never done that before.  I&#39;ve always been diplomatic, but I&#39;m sick of being diplomatic with jerks disguised as people.  It felt good to truly hold him accountable, even if he&#39;s not my kid.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome to the real world - don&#39;t be upset. This seems a small incident <br/>
with HUGE big learning potential that could really pay off in the <br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
I do feel a need for a person who has done something like this  to make <br/>
amends somehow though - no matter what the family is like, unless you <br/>
think they&#39;d actually hit your or pull out a gun and shoot him or <br/>
something. Being nasty to him, verbally, is part of what he might just <br/>
have to face, because he DID egg their house (whether he threw the <br/>
actual egg at that house or not is irrelevant.) Even leaving a small <br/>
gift and an apologetic note on their porch, anonymously, would be good <br/>
for your son.<br/>
<br/>
  Doing the right thing when it is hard is a real test of character and <br/>
it is in these kinds of situations that we build up our strength of <br/>
character to do the right thing when it is even harder.<br/>

Could they have him arrested for egging their house?  That would be a <br/>
concern of mine in  having him make ammends.  <br/>

Yes, and they would even if he didn&#39;t do it (someone in the family works at <br/>
the PD and the entire street is related). I do feel like a bit of a wimp but im <br/>
not going to put my son out to the wolves for being in the wrong place at the <br/>
wrong time (he didn&#39;t throw an egg at this house the older boy did). I guess <br/>
I feel like if you treat a kid like a criminal they will find a way to prove <br/>
you right.<br/>
<br/>
However I do think that maybe it would be a good idea to visit the house he <br/>
actually tossed at (im being told he missed on purpose). This isn&#39;t the violent <br/>
people but close. I know in my heart the guilt of not coming forward is going <br/>
to get the best of me and that&#39;s good I guess....<br/>
We will do something I just dont know what yet? Knowing these people and how <br/>
much they dislike us (not from anything we did that&#39;s for sure) no one I know <br/>
is suggesting that we speak up at all.....<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked yesterday if any of us unschool due to our own childhood&#39;s or <br/>
something like that. I do. In this case I know first hand that being accused of <br/>
doing something or being a bad kid can make a good kid go in the wrong <br/>
direction. I did things just because I was already accused of them so I had to try <br/>
them. However stupid or silly it sounds it was real to me. The difference may <br/>
be that my son has a good home, I didn&#39;t.<br/>
