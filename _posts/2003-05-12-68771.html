attitude was a friendship I developed with a very conservative Mennonite <br/>
family.  Although I don&#39;t agree with a lot of their beliefs (no musical <br/>
instruments, same dress, etc) knowing them and reading a lot of their books <br/>
was an inspiration.  Seeing their children content with some play dishes and <br/>
a doll, with homemade swings and a set of tools relieved a lot of my guilt <br/>
for not buying my children the latest educational &quot;toys&quot; being pushed by Toys <br/>
R Us.  Learning to be content and to take something for what it is...a 100 <br/>
dollar dress is made from material just like a 25 cent dress from a yard <br/>
sale.  A 2.00 set of garage sale dishes serve the purpose as much as a 50.00 <br/>
dollar store bought set.  Who gives a crap what the world says is the latest <br/>
in home furnishings/styling...who cares!!  As long as we are fed, warm, <br/>
healthy, happy, and clean, who gives a flying fudgecake if our car door is <br/>
dented and there&#39;s juice stains on the carpet and it&#39;s a 10 year old station <br/>
wagon.  It gets us to the store all the same.  <br/>
<br/>
If I can make a small suggestion of a couple good books:  &quot;How to Survive <br/>
Without a Salary&quot; which does not mean no income, just means not a regular <br/>
job, but book is VERY well written, and a wonderful study in the difference <br/>
between wants and needs, and learning to change from being a consumer to a <br/>
conserver.  GREAT book.  <br/>
<br/>
Another that I didn&#39;t like quite as well, but was much more detailed and more <br/>
of an entire plan, was &quot;Youra Money or your Life.&quot;  Another help at looking <br/>
at what you consume, want, spend, and a huge help at getting things under <br/>
control.  <br/>
<br/>
One more thing....got through all your rooms, one at a time, and put anything <br/>
you don&#39;t need, don&#39;t want, don&#39;t use, in boxes...whatever is not junk, sell <br/>
on ebay.  We did this (and we didn&#39;t even have that much to sell) and made <br/>
enough in a couple of weeks for a new computer, and a bunch of home repairs <br/>
we needed to do.  Whatever is not good enough for ebay, sell at a yard sale.  <br/>
REALLY go through your rooms with a fine toothed comb...you&#39;ll have less junk <br/>
to clean, organize, etc. and more time for your family and kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-948902193">Thank you for all the kind words ((((((UNSCHOOLERS))))))))) <br/>
<br/>
I know we are not as bad off as we could be. I really think I have been in <br/>
this rut since my business sunk the week of 9/11.  I had just opened a store <br/>
front that was costly. (bad idea)<br/>
<br/>
I was a one woman show with my son as my helper doing a 1000.00 a day selling <br/>
high end children toys on the net. I worked out of my home and actually all <br/>
the manufactures thought we had like 20 people answering phones in a big <br/>
building. All my customers knew we HS and that my son helped.  <br/>
We have house its a split entry nothing to write home about but its a house.  <br/>
Between the dogs and kids nothing looks untouched to say the least. <br/>
<br/>
I shop at Goodwill also I actually prefer it. I just cant justify the added <br/>
funds on the same items. I wear Walmart or Eddie Bauer jeans not a big deal <br/>
at all.<br/>
There is nothing flashy or expensive looking about me except my car, people <br/>
think the car is worth a lot but its not.  I am a jeans and sneakers person <br/>
always have been.  I have never carried a purse except at my wedding for 5 <br/>
minutes.<br/>
<br/>
I dont think it&#39;s that I cant go, go, go.  And the kids are great they really <br/>
have all they need and then some.  I dont know what it is.... <br/>
I have actually asked my husband if we could sell this and move to some far <br/>
away state with lots of land. We have about an acre and a half that&#39;s back up <br/>
to 11 acres of woods so we are not in the city at all. <br/>
<br/>
All in all I think the business had a lot to do with my rut and I&#39;&#39;ll tell <br/>
you why.<br/>
<br/>
I am rebuilding the site and the business but its not mine.  It is my older <br/>
sisters. I have been doing her site and giving all the back door secrets to <br/>
the manufacturers. She knows before she calls who to talk to who not and what <br/>
to say.<br/>
So it&#39;s knowing that I could be out of this mess in a year or so that gets <br/>
me. But I really dont have the energy to want to do the same thing all over <br/>
again I need a different business.<br/>
<br/>
I was never secure but I could pay my bills, now with the business gone I <br/>
doubled my debt and that&#39;s scary.<br/>
<br/>
This stuff is always on my mind why it fell out yesterday I dont know. <br/>
Today is another day, I vented and I feel much better.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for listening, I&#39;ll try to be positive now.<br/>
<br/>
