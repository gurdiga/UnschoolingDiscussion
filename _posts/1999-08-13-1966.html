&lt;&lt;    It&#39;s nice to know that phonics confuses someone<br/>
 else. My mil thinks I must be wrong when I say that phonics makes no sense<br/>
 to my now 9 year old. :)  I also have a 7. 5 year old who has no interest in<br/>
 reading either.  Now, taking things apart, that he can do for hours and<br/>
 hours, not to mention playing video games.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>    Lisa, we must have the same mil (they just dress differently!) :-)<br/>
  she contstantly tries to &quot;teach&quot; my 7.5 yo dd.  Neither of my girls are <br/>
phonetic readers--they could practice phonics  on worksheets until they (and <br/>
I) were blue in the face, but when they would try to read  they&#39;d say &quot;Huh?&quot;  <br/>
 So we just read a lot because we love it.<br/>
  Here&#39;s an unschooling &quot;moment&quot;. The other night We were all sitting in and <br/>
reading our various books. Hannah (the 7.5 yo) was also &quot;reading&quot; but this <br/>
time she started to read one of the &quot;Little Bear&#39; books out loud to herself.  <br/>
It was cool.   She has always told me that she is too busy playing to learn <br/>
to read!! All things in their own time!!<br/>
