makes perfect sense in my voice and in my head, but all strung out in its little <br/>
words this way would make it a heck of a sentence to diagram:<br/>

A small flaw in a huge diamond. That was a great post. Damn, you have <br/>
such a way with analogies!<br/>

It made sense to me, though I have to admit that I just couldn&#39;t <br/>
follow your other one:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-And those who thinking asking forever is the same as being get <br/>
 </span></blockquote>angry <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when those same people they were asking for help or approval <br/>
 </span></blockquote>say &quot;You&#39;re not <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thinking it yet. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The overall post definitely goes in my &quot;words to ponder&quot; file. The <br/>
analogy really spoke to me. My part-time job is teaching people how <br/>
to do something that is largely intuitive and comes by feel <br/>
(swimming) and it&#39;s always fun when they &quot;get it&quot; and *know* that <br/>
they&#39;ve got it, but it&#39;s really hard to explain to them exactly how <br/>
to get it. I love thinking about unschooling in the same way. <br/>
