<div id="ygrps-yiv-305389012">Thanks again to this group for a great idea! (I&#39;m the one who was feeling<br/>
chocolate-deprived)<br/>
<br/>
We like to dye eggs for Easter, so for a few weeks before Easter I poke<br/>
holes in eggs and blow out the inside and save the shells for dying.  We<br/>
do some hard boiled too.  Dd really wanted to buy the egg dye kit, but<br/>
the store was out so we used vinegar and food coloring and got far more<br/>
vibrant colors than last year!<br/>
<br/>
So, Easter morning, Dh and I went in the backyard and hid colored eggs<br/>
and a few Hershey&#39;s kisses while Dd&#39;s were in the front yard doing the<br/>
same.  Then we watched them hunt, and THEN they watched us hunt.  They<br/>
said it was the best egg hunt ever!  (And I got some chocolate of my very<br/>
own out of the deal :-)<br/>
<br/>
There is a mystery however.  We count before we hide and we found all the<br/>
eggs but there is one piece of chocolate in the front and one in the back<br/>
that we couldn&#39;t find.  Will we find it before the irrigation system<br/>
turns on for the year? ...<br/>

they&#39;ll know how to have fun when they&#39;re adults.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065394960">Smart idea, counting. One year my grandmother forgot to count, and found one <br/>
very bad egg under the end of her mobile home about July...but it was EASY to <br/>
find!<br/>
