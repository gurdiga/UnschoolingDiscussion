There are so many different aspects of the fashion industry, so I&#39;ll<br/>
touch on some generals, and if you want more info on specifics let me<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Fashion design starts out as the idea in the designers head, and is<br/>
usually transformed to concept in one of two ways. First, by sketch pad.<br/>
If your daughter wants to get an idea of how fashion design art looks,<br/>
try to get your hands on a copy of *WWD* (Womens&#39; Wear Daily). It is the<br/>
fashion industry bible and is loaded with pictures, as well as other info<br/>
I&#39;ll get into later. If she wants to get the hang of drawing the human<br/>
form, and clothing, photo copy a picture of the body form, and let her<br/>
draw various clothes on them. (If you need a copy, I can fax you one)<br/>
Once she gets good at the proportions, she can draw the whole look<br/>
freehand. The second way that most designers transfer their idea to<br/>
concept is by what it called draping. For this, it is most easily done<br/>
using a dress form. You can sometimes find them in local sale papers,<br/>
maybe on the internet. What you do is cut, pin, and drape muslin on the<br/>
dress form till you get the look you want. <br/>
Once you have the design you want, you need to choose colors and fabrics.<br/>
To choose the proper fabrics, maybe your daughter would want to start her<br/>
own textile catalog. What I did was go to a fabric store and get a bunch<br/>
of different swatches of fabric (about 1&quot; square pieces) and staple them<br/>
each to a 3X5 card. On the card you can write information such as fiber<br/>
content, and fabric care. Show her how to tell the difference between<br/>
natural and synthetic fibers, and the pros and cons of each. Show her how<br/>
to determine the different textures, and show her the difference between<br/>
woven, knit, and felted material. Have her identify this info about each<br/>
swatch on the 3x5 card. All this info is vital in choosing the proper<br/>
fabric for her designs. Once you pick the fabric, this will limit your<br/>
color choices as to what is available (unless you get into dying your own<br/>
fabric, which I have not).<br/>
        To make your designs into clothes, you need to make patterns. If<br/>
you start out with a basic straight skirt, bodice front, and bodice back,<br/>
you can pretty much change them to whatever design you need. If your<br/>
daughter is not familiar with sewing terminology, she will need to know<br/>
some basics. Show her what darts, pleats, gathers, seam allowance, etc<br/>
is, and give her scraps of fabric to practice these skills with. To make<br/>
patterns, I use rolls of white newsprint paper that you can get free from<br/>
your news printer. When they get close to the end of the roll, they just<br/>
get rid of them. There is usually 80 feet or better left on them, plenty<br/>
to make patterns. Making patterns is more easily shown than described, so<br/>
hopefully you have enough basic sewing knowledge to get her through this<br/>
part &lt;grin&gt;. If my end design is going to be made of expensive fabric, I<br/>
first make the garment out of muslin, then make any changes necessary on<br/>
the pattern. I learned this the hard and expensive way.<br/>
        If your daughter wants to learn more about marketing the<br/>
fashions, *WWD* lists fashion show schedules. It also shows the trends<br/>
and styles that will be prevalent the following year. You may want to<br/>
take her to a fashion show in New York, and let her see one in action.<br/>
You could also just take her to the garment district, I think around 5th<br/>
Avenue. They used to give tours, but I don&#39;t know if they still do that<br/>
or not. Maybe your daughter would want to put on her own fashion show.<br/>
She could get together with a bunch of friends and swap clothes and do an<br/>
impromptu show. Or, depending where you live, there are some clothing<br/>
stores that put on fashion shows to expose new clothing lines.<br/>
I was a manager at a Fashion Bug umpteen years ago, when they just<br/>
started carrying childrens&#39; clothing. I recruited children, and we put on<br/>
a little show in their school auditorium. Then they got a discount on the<br/>
clothes they wore. Ask around at different stores to see if they put on<br/>
fashion shows, and ask how your daughter can help. Anything from<br/>
modeling, to steaming the clothes, to accessorizing outfits. Another<br/>
thing she can do is ask stores when their display day is, when they<br/>
change all the mannequins and store displays. If you left your phone<br/>
number with them, and asked them to call you when they were going to do<br/>
them, it would be great for your daughter to watch. It&#39;s just like<br/>
dressing big dolls. If you run into a nice store manager, they may even<br/>
let her help, and often times are even looking for a younger girls<br/>
perspective. <br/>
        As far as the buying end of fashion, it might be helpful to know<br/>
where you are, and what chain headquarters are near you. Charming<br/>
Shoppes, which owns the chain of Fashion Bug stores, is in Bensalem, PA.<br/>
If you called them, they might let your daughter actually see their<br/>
buying department in action (good PR for them). Depending on what line<br/>
the buyer is buying for, they may purchase directly from the designer,<br/>
from a distributor, or from catalogs. Hosiery, lingerie, and accessories<br/>
are generally purchased out of catalogs. Most larger chains, like Fashion<br/>
Bug, have in-house designers that design for their store labels, and then<br/>
have the garments made overseas and shipped back. Hess&#39; Department store<br/>
used to be in Allentown, PA and they at one time where the top upscale<br/>
store in the nation. It was exciting watching the buyers choose lavish<br/>
sequined gowns at fashion shows, and ordering these $2000 and up dresses,<br/>
ten at a time. At 19 years old it was really a LOT of money. Very<br/>
fascinating. Maybe there is an upscale store in your area that you can<br/>
talk to.<br/>
        Also, if there is an art college near you, they probably have a<br/>
fashion design program. They may let you and your daughter sit in on a<br/>
class, or join them on field trips. They are also usually in need of<br/>
younger people for fitting and modeling purposes. Call the department<br/>
head and see how flexible they are. Find out when they put their shows<br/>
on, and just go to watch.<br/>
        I&#39;m sure that I left some stuff out. Hope this helps, and let me<br/>
know if you want more info.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure where &quot;nearby&quot; is.&lt;grin&gt; I am about 25 minutes SW of<br/>
Allentown. What part of fashion design is your daughter most interested<br/>
in? The artsy? Sewing? Marketing? Modeling? I have some of my old<br/>
portfolio stuff, but most of it got tossed when I moved. I have lots of<br/>
fabric and stuff if she wants to learn to sew. If she wants to learn to<br/>
sew, a good project to start out with is pillows shaped liked the letters<br/>
in her name. Easy to make the patterns, you can use scraps of fabric so<br/>
it is cheap. The only thing that can get expensive is the fiberfill if<br/>
she has a long name. Maybe it&#39;s time to retire one of your bed pillows???<br/>
They can have a lot of fun with this, and like having all the pillows on<br/>
their beds. Let me know where you are, and we can see if we can get<br/>
together if she is interested. If not, I can always send you stuff out.<br/>

&gt; bunch<br/>
&gt;   of different swatches of fabric (about 1&quot; square pieces) and <br/>
&gt; staple them<br/>
&gt;   each to a 3X5 card. On the card you can write information such as <br/>
&gt; fiber<br/>
&gt;   content, and fabric care. Show her how to tell the difference <br/>
&gt; between<br/>
&gt;   natural and synthetic fibers, and the pros and cons of each. Show <br/>
&gt; her how<br/>
&gt;   to determine the different textures, and show her the difference <br/>
&gt; between<br/>
&gt;   woven, knit, and felted material. Have her identify this info <br/>
&gt; about each<br/>
&gt;   swatch on the 3x5 card. All this info is vital in choosing the <br/>
&gt; proper<br/>
&gt;   fabric for her designs. Once you pick the fabric, this will limit <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt;   color choices as to what is available (unless you get into dying <br/>
&gt; your own<br/>
&gt;   fabric, which I have not).<br/>
&gt;           To make your designs into clothes, you need to make <br/>
&gt; patterns. If<br/>
&gt;   you start out with a basic straight skirt, bodice front, and <br/>
&gt; bodice back,<br/>
&gt;   you can pretty much change them to whatever design you need. If <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt;   daughter is not familiar with sewing terminology, she will need to <br/>
&gt; know<br/>
&gt;   some basics. Show her what darts, pleats, gathers, seam allowance, <br/>
&gt; etc<br/>
&gt;   is, and give her scraps of fabric to practice these skills with. <br/>
&gt; To make<br/>
&gt;   patterns, I use rolls of white newsprint paper that you can get <br/>
&gt; free from<br/>
&gt;   your news printer. When they get close to the end of the roll, <br/>
&gt; they just<br/>
&gt;   get rid of them. There is usually 80 feet or better left on them, <br/>
&gt; plenty<br/>
&gt;   to make patterns. Making patterns is more easily shown than <br/>
&gt; described, so<br/>
&gt;   hopefully you have enough basic sewing knowledge to get her <br/>
&gt; through this<br/>
&gt;   part &lt;grin&gt;. If my end design is going to be made of expensive <br/>
&gt; fabric, I<br/>
&gt;   first make the garment out of muslin, then make any changes <br/>
&gt; necessary on<br/>
&gt;   the pattern. I learned this the hard and expensive way.<br/>
&gt;           If your daughter wants to learn more about marketing the<br/>
&gt;   fashions, *WWD* lists fashion show schedules. It also shows the <br/>
&gt; trends<br/>
&gt;   and styles that will be prevalent the following year. You may want <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt;   take her to a fashion show in New York, and let her see one in <br/>
&gt; action.<br/>
&gt;   You could also just take her to the garment district, I think <br/>
&gt; around 5th<br/>
&gt;   Avenue. They used to give tours, but I don&#39;t know if they still do <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt;   or not. Maybe your daughter would want to put on her own fashion <br/>
&gt; show.<br/>
&gt;   She could get together with a bunch of friends and swap clothes <br/>
&gt; and do an<br/>
&gt;   impromptu show. Or, depending where you live, there are some <br/>
&gt; clothing<br/>
&gt;   stores that put on fashion shows to expose new clothing lines.<br/>
&gt;   I was a manager at a Fashion Bug umpteen years ago, when they <br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt;   started carrying childrens&#39; clothing. I recruited children, and we <br/>
&gt; put on<br/>
&gt;   a little show in their school auditorium. Then they got a discount <br/>
&gt; on the<br/>
&gt;   clothes they wore. Ask around at different stores to see if they <br/>
&gt; put on<br/>
&gt;   fashion shows, and ask how your daughter can help. Anything from<br/>
&gt;   modeling, to steaming the clothes, to accessorizing outfits. <br/>
&gt; Another<br/>
&gt;   thing she can do is ask stores when their display day is, when <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt;   change all the mannequins and store displays. If you left your <br/>
&gt; phone<br/>
&gt;   number with them, and asked them to call you when they were going <br/>
&gt; to do<br/>
&gt;   them, it would be great for your daughter to watch. It&#39;s just <br/>
&gt; like<br/>
&gt;   dressing big dolls. If you run into a nice store manager, they may <br/>
&gt; even<br/>
&gt;   let her help, and often times are even looking for a younger <br/>
&gt; girls<br/>
&gt;   perspective. <br/>
&gt;           As far as the buying end of fashion, it might be helpful <br/>
&gt; to know<br/>
&gt;   where you are, and what chain headquarters are near you. Charming<br/>
&gt;   Shoppes, which owns the chain of Fashion Bug stores, is in <br/>
&gt; Bensalem, PA.<br/>
&gt;   If you called them, they might let your daughter actually see <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt;   buying department in action (good PR for them). Depending on what <br/>
&gt; line<br/>
&gt;   the buyer is buying for, they may purchase directly from the <br/>
&gt; designer,<br/>
&gt;   from a distributor, or from catalogs. Hosiery, lingerie, and <br/>
&gt; accessories<br/>
&gt;   are generally purchased out of catalogs. Most larger chains, like <br/>
&gt; Fashion<br/>
&gt;   Bug, have in-house designers that design for their store labels, <br/>
&gt; and then<br/>
&gt;   have the garments made overseas and shipped back. Hess&#39; Department <br/>
&gt; store<br/>
&gt;   used to be in Allentown, PA and they at one time where the top <br/>
&gt; upscale<br/>
&gt;   store in the nation. It was exciting watching the buyers choose <br/>
&gt; lavish<br/>
&gt;   sequined gowns at fashion shows, and ordering these $2000 and up <br/>
&gt; dresses,<br/>
&gt;   ten at a time. At 19 years old it was really a LOT of money. Very<br/>
&gt;   fascinating. Maybe there is an upscale store in your area that you <br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt;   talk to.<br/>
&gt;           Also, if there is an art college near you, they probably <br/>
&gt; have a<br/>
&gt;   fashion design program. They may let you and your daughter sit in <br/>
&gt; on a<br/>
&gt;   class, or join them on field trips. They are also usually in need <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt;   younger people for fitting and modeling purposes. Call the <br/>
&gt; department<br/>
&gt;   head and see how flexible they are. Find out when they put their <br/>
&gt; shows<br/>
&gt;   on, and just go to watch.<br/>
&gt;           I&#39;m sure that I left some stuff out. Hope this helps, and <br/>
&gt; let me<br/>
&gt;   know if you want more info.<br/>
&gt;   Wende<br/>

&gt;   &gt; My 10 year old daughter is very interested in designing <br/>

&gt;   &gt; Anyone know where I can get more info on this, or software, or <br/>

&gt;   &gt; I also wanted to look into the &quot;buyer&quot; aspect of it.  <br/>
