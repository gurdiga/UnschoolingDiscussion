<div id="ygrps-yiv-21541604">***27 to point out spelling/grammar errors***<br/>
<br/>
I dreamed about this list last night.  <br/>
I dreamed Kelly corrected my spelling and grammar. (and someone soitanly<br/>
should)<br/>
<br/>
Dylan&#39;s dad is out of town and Dylan and I have been away a lot.  We&#39;ve<br/>
been hiking and camping and visiting friends.  When we&#39;ve been home we&#39;ve<br/>
had company and I haven&#39;t had much time to post until last weekend.  <br/>
Wow!  The last few days were not the best days to try to catch up and<br/>
participate.   It must have affected my tiny little mind because I<br/>
dreamed Kelly sent me a private e-mail telling me to proof read. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good advice, Kelly, thank you.<br/>
<br/>
There might also be five posts about how changing light bulbs could be an<br/>
indication of a serious disorder, ten posts about natural remedies for<br/>
obsessive light bulb changing and six posts in a row, from the same<br/>
person, about how her kids would only eat light bulbs all day if she<br/>
didn&#39;t tell them not to. <br/>
<br/>
And at least one post from some smart ass who can&#39;t even find a light<br/>
bulb, who&#39;s going away again tonight and won&#39;t be back till Saturday. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
