<div id="ygrps-yiv-742324486">-=-... for about 9 months now. I was hoping that giving them their own money would help them learn . . . -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I was hoping&quot; sounds like you&#39;ve already given up.<br/>
Nine months is a very short time.<br/>
<br/>
They WILL learn, if you don&#39;t give up.  And I think they&#39;ll learn more quickly if you stop the running commentary, and let them feel their own feelings and have their own thoughts about it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Â I also was getting really tired of constant begging for things. I understand that when we go into a store, we want things - and I certainly bought many treats and things (actually my husband felt I did this too much - and that was the reason for the continual begging).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe only take one to the store at a time?<br/>
Maybe when they say &quot;I want this,&quot; say &quot;Let&#39;s put it on a list when we get home,&quot; and the desire might pass or it might grow stronger.  That&#39;s a way to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;maybe&quot; instead of &quot;NO, stop whining.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never dealt with &quot;continual begging,&quot; and without knowing the family dynamics I can&#39;t guess what would cause it, but if kids are happy and distracted and feeling talked to and seen when they&#39;re in the store, they might have less need and opportunity to &quot;beg.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t know - but they all seem to have a disregard for their stuff no matter how much they like it, or how expensive it is.-=- <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a separate issue.<br/>
<br/>
Are you helping make it easier for them to take care of things?  Good storage, privacy, assistance picking things up and putting them in safe places?  Most little kids can&#39;t begin to do that on their own, and until they CAN do it on their own, especially as it&#39;s bothering you, I think you should do it for them and with them.<br/>
<br/>
We still have game pieces to games my kids had when they were VERY small, because when we finished playing a game, I always helped them put the game away.  If we found a piece of a game or puzzle, we put it in the lost parts drawer, and would eventually put it with the right game.  Because I made an effort to take care of things and to help them keep their parts and pieces safe and together, they did it for my things and each others&#39; things (and still do).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=- I was hoping that this would wear off, and they would start to see that when they see something that is like $10 it is attainable in a couple weeks if they save.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Was hoping&quot; again.   You consider it a failed &quot;experiment&quot; after less than a year, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 -=-I explain this. . . -=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re trying to teach instead of letting them learn.<br/>
<br/>
 -=-I explain this, and they seem to agree and then on the way out they will buy candy - or put money in those machines with the plastic bubbles. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My guess is they&#39;re agreeing with you so you&#39;ll stop talking, or they acknowledge that they KNOW they could save their money, and then they make a choice and you don&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I suppose I could look at this . . . but I am of the mindset that generally you get what you pay for with things.. . .I have such a hard time . . . I would think that they would figure this out. . .&#39;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of &quot;I&quot; in one paragraph, and too much thinking about money you&#39;ve already freely given to your kids. Let it be free and good and happy!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, I know they are not deprived ;-)   -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yet you mentioned constant begging.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145751596">Nine months isn&#39;t very long for learning a life long lesson.  It seems like<br/>
the short term value of the low quality toys is worth it to them right now.<br/>
How old are they anyway?  Kids don&#39;t always enjoy playing with junky toys.<br/>
They&#39;ll outgrow that with time, I would think.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I was growing up, my parents never told me how to spend my money.  I<br/>
earned it baby sitting, working in a pizza parlor, and sometimes when I was<br/>
younger, I got an allowance.  Until I was on my own, I was always pretty<br/>
generous with my money.  I would take my friends to fairs and I&#39;d buy them<br/>
things and take them on rides, if I could afford it.  It was worth it to me<br/>
to have my friends with me.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t stop me from becoming a pretty frugal adult who thinks carefully<br/>
about every purchase made.  In fact, I am one of the most careful people<br/>
with money that I know.   I think it&#39;s very possible that a big part of the<br/>
reason that I don&#39;t have issues with money is because I always made my own<br/>
choices and I learned from my mistakes.  I am glad my parents allowed me the<br/>
freedom to do that when I was still under their roof.  I know way too many<br/>
adults who are who are just now learning from their mistakes when there are<br/>
harsher consequences for the mistakes than just a house full of low quality<br/>
toys.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think kids are better off with the freedom to spend their money however<br/>
they wish without any judgmental looks or remarks from their parents.  You<br/>
can&#39;t learn their lesson for them.  If they ask your opinion on the quality<br/>
of something then give it.  Otherwise I&#39;d save my breath.  When the value of<br/>
the toys is less than the value of the money &lt;to them&gt; then they&#39;ll stop<br/>
buying them.<br/>
<br/>

doing that. Stop thinking about it, much less talking about it.  It is <br/>
kind of meanspirited, Heather, to give them money and then be <br/>
judgmental about how they spend it. Heck, if you did that to me, I&#39;d <br/>
spend it on what I knew you disapproved of, just because it would feel <br/>
kind of like a dirty trick to me.<br/>
<br/>
They WILL learn - but you&#39;re corrupting their learning process by <br/>
making YOUR judgment part of it.<br/>
<br/>
ENJOY their purchases with gusto. &quot;Wow, look how much stuff you got!!&quot; <br/>
&quot;How was the candy? Good? Oh good!!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s a cute little toy - what <br/>
does it do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Commiserate with them when a cheaply made little toy breaks. &quot;I&#39;m so <br/>
sorry, how disappointing.&quot; &quot;I know that little toy didn&#39;t last long, <br/>
but I bet you had fun with it while it lasted, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Talking and spreading your angst is not going to teach them anything <br/>
except that you&#39;re somebody who sucks the joy out of spending a few <br/>
dollars.<br/>
<br/>
You can share your own thoughts when it is about YOUR own spending. <br/>
Maybe a little letting your inner voice out &lt;G&gt; such as, &quot;Hmmmm, I <br/>
could get 10 plastic cups for $5 or just 5 of these for $5. I think <br/>
I&#39;ll get the more expensive ones even though I get fewer of them - they <br/>
seem like they&#39;ll last longer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re worried about the environment - then, again, use your own <br/>
purchases to show that. They&#39;ll learn from what you do.<br/>
<br/>
But - really - don&#39;t give the kids their own money and then talk at <br/>
them about what they spend it on. That&#39;s just not very nice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941324466">I can remember buying the little trinkets that fell apart when I was young.  I&#39;m glad I learned from that, but I feel bad that my mother let me waste all that money on junk.  I wish I could have had the guidance to see the wisdom in saving for something nicer.<br/>
<br/>
I think part of the problem was that the only place we usually shopped was the grocery store, and all they had for toys was cheap junk.  My mother liked to get us something (I&#39;m sure we begged) everytime we went to the store, but it was always cheap.<br/>
<br/>
I think the reason kids beg is because they want to feel like their parents care enough about them to spend money on them.<br/>
<br/>
I always kicked myself for not being able to save money because I always wanted so many little cheap things.  I still have trouble saving money.  It&#39;s like, maybe the habit stuck.<br/>
<br/>
This is just to present a different view.  There is merit to helping your children understand the value of quality merchandise.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we still have to make mistakes to learn.  I&#39;m bad about having to learn everything the hard way--by experience--instead of listening to sound advice.  I think it&#39;s because I&#39;m a puzzle-worker.  I love mysteries, being able to solve things myself.  I&#39;m addicted to the euphoria of conquering a problem myself instead of someone else squashing my achievement by explaining how to do it. <br/>

Right.<br/>
Without a sermon on &quot;I told you so&quot; and without any tales of savings and <br/>

I recommend you watch Mary Poppins, yourself (kids might want to too!) and <br/>
pay very close attention to the song about putting tuppence in the bank, and to <br/>
&quot;Feed the Birds.&quot;<br/>

Cheap toys cost $1.  <br/>
If they last an hour, that&#39;s  not bad.<br/>
<br/>
Psychotherapy or counselling costs around $100 an hour.<br/>
Don&#39;t invest your motherly input now on future need for therapy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t present a different view, though. We all agree in the merit <br/>
of helping them understand the value of quality merchandise.<br/>
<br/>
But we may not agree about what IS a good way to help them understand <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Giving them money and then harping on them about what they&#39;re buying <br/>
with it is not going to help them learn it. I think letting them <br/>
experiment will. I don&#39;t think mommy being a spoilsport is useful at <br/>
all - and just makes HER the negative, rather than the cheap toys <br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
But talking about purchases and quality and why I&#39;m making the buying <br/>
decisions I&#39;m making is useful, over time, in helping them.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids were with me in the grocery store and they wanted those <br/>
little plastic bubble toys from a machine, we&#39;d do it sometimes - there <br/>
is something fun about getting them that way. But if they wanted it <br/>
EVERY week, then we&#39;d perhaps talk about maybe putting that money in an <br/>
envelope instead and saving it up for something specific that they <br/>
wanted. I mean - if I was concerned and seeing a problem, I can see <br/>
trying to find some way of doing something different.<br/>
<br/>
But not with THEIR money. I wouldn&#39;t give them money and then try to <br/>
control how they spend it - directly or indirectly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866437554">Heather, it is really hard for me to watch my kids<br/>
spend their money too! Dh and I have had many talks<br/>
about this, and we always come back to the fact that<br/>
it is their money.  Sometimes we do talk to them about<br/>
saving up for something big.  They hear us talk about <br/>
saving up for something, so I feel this is not out of <br/>
the norm for them to hear.  It doesn&#39;t really change<br/>
how they spend though :)  One question that keeps <br/>
coming up lately from my kids is, they want to know how<br/>
much money we have.  I wouldn&#39;t be uncomfortable sharing <br/>
this, but dh is.  How have others handled that?  I think<br/>
it might be great for them to see what our monthly intake<br/>
is, and a breakdown of how it is spent.  krista<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97183388">I had a question regarding kids learning to manage money. We have been giving our kids an allowance for about 9 months now. I was hoping that giving them their own money would help them learn to save up and buy something they wanted themselves.  I also was getting really tired of constant begging for things. I understand that when we go into a store, we want things - and I certainly bought many treats and things (actually my husband felt I did this too much - and that was the reason for the continual begging). I don&#39;t know - but they all seem to have a disregard for their stuff no matter how much they like it, or how expensive it is. I also have personal problems with continual buying just for the sake of it. Having so many toys and dollar store type items that they break in a day or so seems so wasteful. I am not saying that once in a while this is a bad thing, but when it becomes every time we got to the store it bothers me. I keep thinking &quot;Geez - we have so much stuff at home! and no one takes care of it!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So, now I thought having their own money and having to make their own choices about it would help. They choose more often than not to spend all of it right away on candy or stuffed animals. I was hoping that this would wear off, and they would start to see that when they see something that is like $10 it is attainable in a couple weeks if they save. I explain this, and they seem to agree and then on the way out they will buy candy - or put money in those machines with the plastic bubbles. <br/>
<br/>
Even with gift cards, instead of buying one or two well made, or higher priced items that they seem to really want - it seems that it is quantity they want. I suppose I could look at this a type of money management - getting as many things as possible for one price ;-) but I am of the mindset that generally you get what you pay for with things.  And inevitably the candy is gone, the cheap toys are broken and they are left with nothing. I have such a hard time with the sadness that inevitably happens when something cheap breaks and it usually happens relatively quickly. I would think that they would figure this out and the next five times they would choose differently. It is also not like these are the only times they get candy or cheap toys. So, I know they are not deprived ;-)<br/>
<br/>
This may all be my problem and maybe it is their ages or whatever. I know that it is similar with all of us. We all have things that we like to spend money on, and others may think &quot;Oh, that&#39;s wasteful!&quot; so I probably need to lighten up. I am just so worried that they will never figure this out. An I have environmental &quot;angst&quot; at the amount of stuff that comes in our house and goes out the trash.<br/>
<br/>
So, what are others suggestions on this? I feel like my talking about all the issues wastefulness, environmental concerns, etc. is constantly rain on their parade.... How do you go about helping your kids with money and money issues?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks -<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500358178">Tonight we were in China town in NYC.  We go out every<br/>
year for Chinese New Year.  There are tons of small<br/>
trinket stores that sell first edition and limited<br/>
edition yug-i-oh cards.  Well, my sons got quite a bit<br/>
of money for hanukah this year and were looking at<br/>
these cards (costing $5 to $40 for one card) and I<br/>
told them (they each had about $30 left)<br/>
<br/>
My dh was with us and I just knew he&#39;d have big beef<br/>
with the idea of my guys spending so much $$ on cards<br/>
that half the time end up all over the floor.  Keep in<br/>
mind that this is after we spent $30 (easy) on snaps<br/>
and the big (and totally cool) confetti poppers. <br/>
That&#39;s what? half a minute of excitement and then<br/>
that&#39;s it.  I just thought his objections were so<br/>
arbitrary.  Sure, I wouldn&#39;t go out and spend big $ on<br/>
yug-i-oh cards nor $50 on a computer game (dh would)<br/>
but my kids and dh wouldn&#39;t spend $100 on a pair of<br/>
shoes, or a sweater (and If I really liked it, I<br/>
would).  BTW, my older son did spend all his $$ on two<br/>
cards and I think it&#39;s great that he was able to<br/>
acquire something that gave him so much joy.<br/>
<br/>
I tried to talk to dh about respecting ds&#39; choices,<br/>
after all, it is his $.  I put forth that giving him<br/>
the freedom to spend $ would help him understand the<br/>
process (in a way that makes sense for him) and that<br/>
trying to control him would make him feel denied and<br/>
deprived, but dh wasn&#39;t hearing it.  What is it about<br/>
$ that can makes us so crazy?  When it comes to power<br/>
struggles over behavior, manners and such, dh<br/>
understands unschooling principles, but $ and bedtimes<br/>
- those are tough for him.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it always comes back to examining (and<br/>
reexamining) our own values as shaped by our own<br/>
childhoods.  When dh and my older son were having<br/>
conflicts b/c ds wouldn&#39;t &#39;do what dh was saying&#39;, we<br/>
talked about his own father, and how controling,<br/>
punitive and arbitrary he was in his parenting, and in<br/>
that context, my point made more sense.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts :)<br/>

  --I&#39;ve never dealt with &quot;continual begging,&quot; and without knowing the family dynamics I can&#39;t guess what would cause it, but if kids are happy and distracted and feeling talked to and seen when they&#39;re in the store, they might have less need and opportunity to &quot;beg.&quot;--<br/>
  It could be that what I term &quot;begging&quot; is more like asking for things all the time. In other words, there are no tantrum fits or anything if we can&#39;t buy it all. I think the crux of this on my end is money. And this could very well, be why I am so worried about it all. Working within our budget is not always easy. I think I am stressed at not having enough at the end of the week. Maybe sitting down and making a list beforehand and saying &quot;Ok, pick one or two things you&#39;d like to get&quot; would work better. It doesn&#39;t seem like it would be a big deal if they asked for a candy bar - but it all adds up when it is constant. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  --We still have game pieces to games my kids had when they were VERY small, because when we finished playing a game, I always helped them put the game away.  If we found a piece of a game or puzzle, we put it in the lost parts drawer, and would eventually put it with the right game.  Because I made an effort to take care of things and to help them keep their parts and pieces safe and together, they did it for my things and each others&#39; things (and still do).--<br/>
<br/>
  That is a really good - I think I don&#39;t do this enough. I am not really good at this myself (organizing) When we have lost game pieces I know I have stuck them somewhere... but can never remember where. I&#39;ll have to make a space in a drawer for this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  --You&#39;re trying to teach instead of letting them learn.--<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, I can feel it in myself that &quot;make them&quot; feeling. And I am trying to not &quot;show&quot; it - but of course that is impossible and rather dishonest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  --My guess is they&#39;re agreeing with you so you&#39;ll stop talking, or they acknowledge that they KNOW they could save their money, and then they make a choice and you don&#39;t like it.--<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah - I can picture that. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  -=-So, I know they are not deprived ;-) <br/>
<br/>
  Yet you mentioned constant begging.--<br/>
<br/>
  See that&#39;s the part that I don&#39;t understand. I realize that logically if they had everything they wanted, they would not feel deprived. But how much is enough? Does it become a habit if we buy  candy every time we go to the grocery store, or the convienent store for milk - is it then expected every time?  And if  kids don&#39;t expect it every time is it because they know if they ask they will get it.?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172786096">--That didn&#39;t stop me from becoming a pretty frugal adult who thinks carefully<br/>
  about every purchase made.  In fact, I am one of the most careful people<br/>
  with money that I know.   I think it&#39;s very possible that a big part of the<br/>
  reason that I don&#39;t have issues with money is because I always made my own<br/>
  choices and I learned from my mistakes.  I am glad my parents allowed me the<br/>
  freedom to do that when I was still under their roof.  I know way too many<br/>
  adults who are who are just now learning from their mistakes when there are<br/>
  harsher consequences for the mistakes than just a house full of low quality<br/>
  toys. -- <br/>
  Well this is the outcome I would like - and yes it is better to experience the mistakes in a smaller scale than on a larger one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  --I think kids are better off with the freedom to spend their money however<br/>
  they wish without any judgmental looks or remarks from their parents.  You<br/>
  can&#39;t learn their lesson for them. -- <br/>
<br/>
  Yes, this is true and I want so much to not have the judgmental feeling about it all. They can certainly sense it - and that is not how I want it to be! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919763020">--Stop it - you gave THEM the money to make their own choices and they&#39;re <br/>
  doing that. Stop thinking about it, much less talking about it.  It is <br/>
  kind of meanspirited, Heather, to give them money and then be <br/>
  judgmental about how they spend it. Heck, if you did that to me, I&#39;d <br/>
  spend it on what I knew you disapproved of, just because it would feel <br/>
  kind of like a dirty trick to me.--<br/>
<br/>
  Yeah, see that is very true - and its not how I want it to be. I would never give money to a friend and feel like I am teaching them to manage<br/>
  their money or be critical of where they spent it. Thanks Pam - it&#39;s like the kick in the butt that I needed -<br/>
<br/>
  --ENJOY their purchases with gusto. &quot;Wow, look how much stuff you got!!&quot; <br/>
  &quot;How was the candy? Good? Oh good!!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s a cute little toy - what <br/>
  does it do?&quot;--<br/>
<br/>
  To really feel this though is the part I am struggling with. I am having a really hard time doing this, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  --But - really - don&#39;t give the kids their own money and then talk at <br/>
  them about what they spend it on. That&#39;s just not very nice.--<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Ok - this is true. Having it said straight up should help me stop myself and take a deep breath before saying anything -<br/>
  and maybe I can start to feel real joy in their joy of their purchases. I think I am looking at it all<br/>
  wrong. Instead of feeling - I am &quot;giving&quot;this money - I am setting preconceived notions on how is &quot;should&quot; be used.<br/>
  If I am giving then I should just be giving!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my daughter was younger she was always wanting something and wanting it<br/>
right away, usually video games which are $30-$50 and to her saving up might<br/>
as well have been waiting forever. She also loved stuffed animals, Beanie<br/>
Babies, Pokemon cards. She never met a store she couldn&#39;t find something to<br/>
buy in ;-) So her money was always leaking out on smaller things. Her list<br/>
of wants was huge so even if she had a big chunk of money it couldn&#39;t buy<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
I helped her out what felt to me like fairly often but probably felt to her<br/>
like hardly ever since she seemed to focus so much on right now. I gave her<br/>
interest on her savings to encourage her to save. Not going to toy stores<br/>
where she could see things she didn&#39;t know existed to spend her money on was<br/>
helpful. Of course the Beanies and Pokemon cards were always with other<br/>
things, so we couldn&#39;t always avoid them.<br/>
<br/>
But starting with puberty it all seemed to go away. And now she hardly wants<br/>
anything. Christmas the past two years was really hard to shop for her!<br/>
<br/>
Which is not to suggest that it will all go away with puberty! But that<br/>
despite all the money that trickled through her fingers, despite all the<br/>
stuff she has, *that* didn&#39;t prevent her from understanding the value of<br/>
money now that she is older. It wasn&#39;t because I taught her. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
because the message finally sank in. It was because her needs changed and<br/>
her point of view changed. It didn&#39;t make sense to her now. Now it does.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the common thought that if they&#39;re &quot;indulged&quot; they&#39;ll never<br/>
understand the value of money. But with my daughter that didn&#39;t proven true<br/>
and I don&#39;t think the common thought has any basis. It&#39;s just fear.<br/>

have not since had to explain to them (and even before<br/>
this, they still couldn&#39;t understand) why we can&#39;t<br/>

toy).  It also helped them understand b/t not being<br/>
able to afford something NOW (i.e. a $50 lego set) b/c<br/>
money must first go to these living essentials, but I<br/>
might say, this week we have $20 to put towards that<br/>
lego set, and after two weeks or so, we could go and<br/>
buy it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That has been my experience too.  There are things I wish I could have gotten <br/>
my kids, but because we were always really honest with them it was <br/>
understandable all the way around.  And there were a few things they got and didn&#39;t <br/>
appreciate (Holly, a scooter she hardly ever rode/rides) that stirred the old <br/>
voices in me that wanted to give them the speech about how much others don&#39;t have <br/>
and how ungrateful, blah blah, but I REALLY try to keep those things to <br/>
myself, though occasionally a squeak of it comes out.<br/>
<br/>
I had a mom who could, with a straight face (which came from not thinking <br/>
about it past the surface) tell me with a cigarette in one hand and a beer in the <br/>
other that she/they couldn&#39;t afford to get me whatever $4 or $10 thing I was <br/>
requesting.   My allowance went from 35 cents to $5 over the course of seven <br/>
years or so (the $5 a week was when I was 17 and in college), and my dad <br/>
wouldn&#39;t let me get a job.  It would look like he couldn&#39;t afford to provide for me. <br/>
 But my mom was making sure I wasn&#39;t much provided for.  Altogether, that was <br/>
a big drag.  (When I went away to college I got work study jobs, at least, on <br/>
campus.)  So I know personally what scarcity and resentment feel like.<br/>
<br/>
Since I became pregnant with Kirby (a surprise at the time), I&#39;ve really <br/>
[fishing for a word, and rejecting &#39;studied&#39; and &#39;worked&#39;]...   <br/>
<br/>
From the time I knew I was going to have a baby, I dedicated myself to <br/>
overcoming my childhood problems and getting clear enough about what was important <br/>
and what wasn&#39;t so that my child would have a nest free of the trickle-down <br/>
effects of my being a child of an alcoholic, and (I had hoped)  free of the <br/>
effects of the discouraging voices people can keep in their heads.  I didn&#39;t mind <br/>
encouraging tapes playing in my head, from people who had thought I WAS capable <br/>
and fun, but the negative loops and the insults I had endured and collected <br/>
as a kid were categorized as &quot;toxic&quot; and to be cleaned up.  <br/>
<br/>
It might not seem like messages from grandmothers and aunts and teachers and <br/>
friends would affect how people spend money, or don&#39;t, but they can strike at <br/>
the very core of whether one feels worth $5, or $50, or whether one is <br/>
competent to ask for more money, or to sign a contract that puts one in debt, or to <br/>
invest.  All that can have to do with self esteem and self worth.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why money problems are so often the source of marital discord, I <br/>
think, and why counselling can help.  Money issues are rarely cleanly about money.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had friends whose parents used money as reward and punishment.   Kid was <br/>
good all year?  &quot;Christmas bonus.&quot;  One family I know, that was as clearly <br/>
shown as if they&#39;d put coal in the stockings.  The kids didn&#39;t get equal amounts <br/>
of money at holidays.  Teens, young adults.  And it wasn&#39;t about need, or <br/>
age, it was about who did what the parents said to do better that year.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the principles we have tried to  maintain with our children is that <br/>
they not feel needy or deprived.  Their clothes aren&#39;t all new or expensive, but <br/>
they have enough clothes that every day they  have a choice of what to wear.  <br/>
They have extra shoes.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly bought herself a used pair of shoes.  I&#39;ll buy her laces <br/>
today or tomorrow.  Yesterday I bought Kirby a coat, used at a re-sale shop, for <br/>
$30.  That&#39;s the first coat I&#39;ve bought him since the one he outgrew when he <br/>
was 12 or 13.  But he has always had a coat, even though it came from his dad, <br/>
or was the one I found near a dumpster.  Somewhere in there, they didn&#39;t feel <br/>
deprived.<br/>
<br/>
We paid them off, but we paid them in attention and freedom and positive <br/>
regard.  <br/>
<br/>
And, kind of like the not forcing foods thing, we didn&#39;t force them to wear <br/>
clothes they hated.  I never thought of that until just now.  Because they were <br/>
free to say, &quot;No, this one&#39;s uncomfortable,&quot; or &quot;these shoes hurt&quot; or &quot;I just <br/>
don&#39;t like this shirt for some reason,&quot; clothes weren&#39;t charged with IMPORT <br/>
or emotion or hurt.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an article I wrote about ideas concerning spoiled kids and money.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think it needs to cost a lot of money to be generous with kids.  Parents <br/>
of any means can be generous or stingy, because those have more to do (I <br/>
think) with the emotions surrounding how one says &quot;can&#39;t afford it&quot; or &quot;I wish I <br/>
could.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1608099666">&quot; One question that keeps <br/>
coming up lately from my kids is, they want to know how <br/>
much money we have.  I wouldn&#39;t be uncomfortable sharing <br/>
this, but dh is.  How have others handled that?  I think <br/>
it might be great for them to see what our monthly intake <br/>
is, and a breakdown of how it is spent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My parents never discussed money in front of us when I was young.  It seems so artificial for children not to know some of the everyday financial dilema&#39;s the family faces.<br/>
<br/>
Our son knows when we have money, and when we don&#39;t, although he&#39;s probably too young to know exactly where all of it goes.<br/>
<br/>
He does help his dad with the gravel-hauling business--calculating the price of the load and how much profit they are making with the haul.  That&#39;s how he &quot;practices&quot; his math.  He enjoys it, taking his briefcase and calculator with him in the dump truck.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most important thing is just being honest, and sharing your concerns with your child without overwhelming them with the details they can&#39;t understand yet.<br/>
<br/>
About the recent thread concerning children saving money--there&#39;s a really cool bank I got for my son (crown.org} which helps him save money.  It&#39;s like an ATM machine, with a card, keypad, and drawer.  It keeps track of how much you put in, take out, and save.  I would give the exact address, but I don&#39;t want this to sound like an advertisement. <br/>

<br/>
It is a left-over idea that children won&#39;t learn what we don&#39;t directly <br/>
teach them. We know that&#39;s not true. They WANT to be competent and <br/>
capable and they will want to live good lives in which they will think <br/>
about what makes sense to get what they want and do what they want. it <br/>
is once again a matter of trust - trusting that they&#39;ll &quot;grow up&quot; and <br/>
that if we don&#39;t mess with them, if we don&#39;t warp them in some way, <br/>
they&#39;ll make conscious decisions about money.<br/>
<br/>
NO different than food issues at all - if we keep at them about what <br/>
they eat or don&#39;t eat - if we bug them all the time, if we say, &quot;You <br/>
can eat anything you want, but, oh, honey, do you really want to eat <br/>
just cake for breakfast, don&#39;t you think you should have some eggs?&quot; <br/>
then we undermine their own sense of self, their own sense of making <br/>
their own choices, their own chance to make their own &quot;little&quot; <br/>
mistakes. Their eating, as adults, will STILL be somehow controlled by <br/>
that controlling mommy voice in our heads - and, as teens and adults, <br/>
we very often tend to be resistant to it - which means that we find <br/>
ourselves as ADULTS, eating too much cake while hearing, &quot;You shouldn&#39;t <br/>
be eating that,&quot; over and over in our heads.<br/>
<br/>
Do we want our kids to grow up and find themselves spending money on <br/>
the adult equivalent of junky little things while hearing, &quot;You <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be buying that,&quot; over and over in their heads?<br/>
<br/>
Trust them.<br/>
<br/>
Be their support system. I want so much for my kids to grow up and hear <br/>
that mommy voice in their head saying positive supportive things, not <br/>
tearing them down, but encouraging them - and especially not a voice to <br/>
be resisted. This drives me. I don&#39;t do it all that well - but what I <br/>
focus on is awareness of what they&#39;re likely hearing/saying to <br/>
themselves in response to what I&#39;m saying out loud.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-694138667">Oh gosh, Kelle, I am certain that negative mommy voices can be <br/>
replaced. Absolutely. Look what people can do even as adults in <br/>
reformatting their own inner thoughts. So, yeah, for sure, with the <br/>
help of a newly-aware parent and a lot of honesty and openness about <br/>
how she is working on herself, too? Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the phrase unconditional love - because that has some sort <br/>
of connotation of not even &quot;caring&quot; what my kids do - and it just seems <br/>
like something different than what we mean, here. I guess I think <br/>
parents do all kinds of things while claiming unconditional love. I&#39;ve <br/>
seen advice given to mothers of tiny babies to stop them from squirming <br/>
during diaper changes by whipping them with fishing line and, at the <br/>
same time, looking into their eyes and smiling and cooing that they <br/>
love them. I&#39;m pretty sure those parents giving and taking that advice <br/>
think they have &quot;unconditional love&quot; for their children.<br/>
<br/>
So what we&#39;re talking about, to me, is parenting based on trust in some <br/>
kind of innate urges in human beings.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that ever baby born is programmed to naturally grow up <br/>
to be a competent and capable adult who wants to get along with other <br/>
people and who wants to live a happy and productive life and wants to <br/>
find his/her passions and contribute to the world.<br/>
<br/>
This is clearly different than those who believe children are born <br/>
sinful.<br/>
It is even different, though, from those who believe children are born <br/>
inept. That&#39;s a big deal. It is radically different way of relating to <br/>
children when we relate to them as people needing our support, not our <br/>
control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585208397">If my kids were with me in the grocery store and they wanted those <br/>
little plastic bubble toys from a machine, we&#39;d do it sometimes - there <br/>
is something fun about getting them that way. But if they wanted it <br/>
EVERY week, then we&#39;d perhaps talk about maybe putting that money in an <br/>
envelope instead and saving it up for something specific that they <br/>
wanted. I mean - if I was concerned and seeing a problem, I can see <br/>
trying to find some way of doing something different.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok - so what if they insist that they want it NOW! because for mine it seems that the instant gratification wins out far more often than the saving for something later. And do you mean that if you are buying them something at the store - you feel differently than if it is &quot;their&quot; money?<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned thrift stores. We do this all the time. At one point my son was able to buy a rescue hero jeep and man with his money that he had been wanting. I think they had like $10.00 on it or something. He was proud of himself at being able to buy it with his own money.  But it was short lived. If I remind home of how good he felt the day that he went back and bought it - he doesn&#39;t seem to want to do that over the instant purchase. It was kind of fluky that he saved it that time. I don&#39;t think we had gotten out as much because of bad weather and other plans.<br/>
<br/>
But overall - I guess if he wants something larger bad enough at some point he will decide to just do it. I will let this go ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081855009">--One question that keeps <br/>
coming up lately from my kids is, they want to know how<br/>
much money we have.  I wouldn&#39;t be uncomfortable sharing <br/>
this, but dh is.  How have others handled that? --<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I share it when my kids ask. We have an electric heat pump - and usually its not that bad - but the last couple months have been really cold ( I am envying those of you in warm places ;-) so we had a really large bill. When they heard me talking about possible getting an insert for our fireplace to save on this they wanted to know how much the electric bill was. When I told them I explained how it all matters - lights, hot water, heat, etc. and things that we can all do to cut it back a little. It won&#39;t get tremendously better - but often there are little things, like we forget the playroom lights and stuff. So it opened up a conversation about that and all the other things we pay for like water that is by usage and how much it costs for the mortgage, etc. I think that large of an amount money to them is hard to comprehend. I also share what we save.<br/>
<br/>
Just for fun, we save change in a big jar for our vacation each summer. We cash it in once a year and then use it for fun things on our trip. Of course, its not the only funds we have for the trip but they always like to put our pocket change in there.<br/>

Okay, this is good, because I have done just this, except I said angry or<br/>
irritable instead of grouchy.  I told him to tell me to calm down and take<br/>
it easy.  He has only had to do it once, since.  <br/>

Well, it isnï¿½t just you since Pam just wrote the same thing.  Iï¿½m thinking<br/>
of unconditional love as loving the person inside while still being able to<br/>
express dismay or dislike of an undesirable deed.  Now Iï¿½m going to have to<br/>
think about this a little further, I guess.<br/>

not. I&#39;m just saying that what we&#39;re talking about here is something a <br/>

talking about active encouragement and support and focus on the kids&#39; <br/>
strengths and building on those. We&#39;re talking about assuming the kids <br/>
want pretty much what we want - to have a good life - to live well - to <br/>
have interests and passions and to love what we do and, yes, to feel <br/>
loved.<br/>
<br/>
People can love their kids, but still assume that their children are <br/>
likely to try to &quot;manipulate&quot; them or take advantage of them or rebel <br/>
against them and so on. So - my point is that &quot;love&quot; isn&#39;t the issue <br/>
here - the foundation here is our underlying belief about the nature of <br/>
young human beings.<br/>
