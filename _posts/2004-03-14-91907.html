<br/>
Like what?<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Each time this come up people will say things to that effect, but I&#39;ve yet to <br/>
hear real examples instead of just hopeful hypotheticals.<br/>
<br/>
One of the times we talked about spanking someone asserted that spankers come <br/>
from every religion andsocial group, not just Christians.   Maybe.  But the <br/>
challenge was put for someone to come up with a pro-spanking site that wasn&#39;t <br/>
Christian.   We didn&#39;t get one, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>

check this book out, as I have already taken too much of Sandra&#39;s <br/>
time. <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Everyone&#39;s time, but that&#39;s okay. It&#39;s what the list is for.<br/>
<br/>
I realize Christian unschoolers get the triple whammy where other unschoolers <br/>
only get the double.  Wehave to answer to schoolers and school-at-homers.   <br/>
Christian unschoolers seem to feel the need to answer for other Christians, but <br/>
they can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t.  I would rather they would just say &quot;Yes, we know <br/>
there&#39;s a big organized Christian homeschooling movement.&quot; Because the rest of <br/>
us know there are Christians who are NOT part of that group.  Nothing we say <br/>
or do here will change the reality of the size, organization and intent of <br/>
Christian Homeschooling of the strictly-structured sort.  <br/>
<br/>
My kids have Christian friends they make allowances for when the&#39;re visiting. <br/>
 We&#39;re not anti-Christian.  I&#39;m personally anti anti-child people.  I have no <br/>
patience or  understanding for people who intend to break children&#39;s spirits. <br/>
 Some of those spirits stay broken for life, and it&#39;s hard for me to be <br/>
hopeful about my whole kids having to go ou tand deal with broken-spirited people <br/>
who wish their parents had respected them more (but might not realize what they <br/>
wish after they learn not to look back at their childhoods).<br/>

other topics, like how my daughter explained to one of her new <br/>
friends today how she learns w/out using school books and going to <br/>
school. Her explaination to the friend was: daughter, &quot;do you bake?&quot; <br/>
friend, &quot;yes&quot;, daughter,&quot;well then that&#39;s math and reading, plus <br/>
everything that happens and you do, you learn from&quot;. friend, &quot;Oh, <br/>
okay, do you want to ride the scooters?&quot;   <br/>
I learn so much from kids! :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is so true, but it is really, really hard to do. <br/>
As a Christian unschooler, there is a compelling need<br/>
to separate myself from the huge majority of the<br/>
Christian Homeschooling Movement, and this<br/>
overwhelming need to say, &quot;But that isn&#39;t me!&quot; when I<br/>
hear generalizations made about Christian<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I want people to know clearly and unmistakenly, that<br/>
there ARE Christians unschoolers, there ARE<br/>
Christians, even those who hold fundamentalist<br/>
beliefs, that do not buy into the HSLDA mantra, and<br/>
that even though we are a small minority, we do exist.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel like the Hoos on Horton the<br/>
Elephant&#39;s little truffla tuft who are shouting &quot;WE<br/>
ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE! WE ARE HERE!&quot; hoping that they<br/>
will be heard.<br/>
<br/>
When a new Christian unschooler comes to this list,<br/>
they might not realize that this discussion has been<br/>
gone over so many times, and they are feeling like the<br/>
little Hoo shouting.  They don&#39;t realize, when the<br/>
generalizations are mentioned, that it has already<br/>
been established and is pretty much a given here that<br/>
christians who are here are unschoolers, don&#39;t fit the<br/>
general mold and stereotype, etc.  They have been told<br/>
by all those whammies that they can&#39;t possibly be what<br/>
they say they are, and they feel defensive.  <br/>
<br/>
I know I don&#39;t want to answer for other Christians and<br/>
the school-at-homers.  I just want to answer for me.<br/>

I think it&#39;s a good thing to  model for children, and a good thing for <br/>
personal integrity, if an adult is able to back down if she&#39;s wrong.     I&#39;ve known <br/>
adults who didn&#39;t want to say &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; to children, or to anyone, <br/>
and I&#39;m sorry, but that&#39;s wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

The quote, in defense of statement-of-faith Christian homeschooling groups, <br/>
was this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do personally know of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; other faiths and  groups that do promote their agenda, exlude others <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Other groups like statement-of-faith Christian homeschooling groups, is my <br/>
question.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there might be groups with names like &quot;Catholic  homeschoolers&quot; or &quot;LDS <br/>
homeschoolers&quot; and people might reasonably assume that people of other <br/>
religions don&#39;t have good business being there.   But they&#39;re upfront.  They call <br/>
them what they are.  And I&#39;ve never known a Mormon or Catholic family that <br/>
prevented their kids from playing with kids outside their faith, but I HAVE known <br/>
fundamentalist families who have done so, and sometimes not in subtle ways.<br/>
