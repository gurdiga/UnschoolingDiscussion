<div id="ygrps-yiv-536136740">Hi - the Ayn Rand version of enlightened self-interest was mentioned <br/>
by me, but I think I must not have done it justice if it came across as limited <br/>
to some sort of crass reward-seeking. To the contrary, I think her philosophy <br/>
meant to say the opposite, that the really crass people are those who claim <br/>
we &quot;owe&quot; others what we have just because we have it. Rand&#39;s writings say that <br/>
when we give of ourselves because we choose to rather than because we are <br/>
blackmailed or shamed into it or otherwise forced, then it is good for both giver <br/>
and receiver. <br/>
<br/>
       The enlightenment is in understanding and accepting that it&#39;s better <br/>
for the giver to get something satisfying out of the experience than to be <br/>
extorted, and that it doesn&#39;t make the giver crass just because he refuses to make <br/>
himself miserable for someone else. (But I read Rand at least a couple of <br/>
decades ago, sorry if I still am not doing her philosophy justice.) <br/>
<br/>
       As to &quot;Punished by Rewards&quot; it&#39;s a great unschooling book imo. For <br/>
someone who enjoys the kind of discussion on this list, I would think the whole <br/>
book rather than a synopsis would be better, so you&#39;ll get all his research and <br/>
reasoning. And just my opinion, all of Alfie Kohn&#39;s work (that I know of) is <br/>
very compatible with unschooling -- ours, anyway. :) JJ<br/>

&lt;&lt; A list-mate was defining &#39;Enlightened Self Interest&#39; where a person does <br/>

<br/>
She was citing Ayn Rand, though, who was not a touchy-feely human.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Isn&#39;t it better if we do something nice for another person/the world simply <br/>

<br/>
I think so, but then I care more about the person who&#39;s doing the deed than <br/>
the person done for, in most cases involving my children.  If Kirby is nice to <br/>
Holly, I get a double bonus.   If Kirby is nice to someone I don&#39;t even know <br/>
and will never see again, it makes Kirby a better person, and I&#39;m glad for <br/>
that.   And when I see Kirby be kind to a stranger, or a customer, or a student at <br/>
the dojo, or a friend of his, I have a warm feeling about Kirby.<br/>
<br/>
So it helps the person who is good, because his own self-image is better when <br/>
he&#39;s done what he considers &quot;worthy&quot; instead of acting in a less-than-best <br/>
way.   And it helps the person&#39;s reputation for others to see him act in ways <br/>
they consider commendable.  They might speak well of him to others; that&#39;s <br/>
helpful for reputation and the benefits spread all directions.   <br/>
<br/>
On top of all that, he made the person&#39;s day brighter, the one he was kind to <br/>
in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Somehow, I feel that the <br/>
expectation of a &#39;reward&#39; for being generous with oneself and ones time is <br/>
what kills relationships, friendships and whittles away at each of us, <br/>
lessens us somehow.  I won&#39;t help you until I know that you&#39;ll help <br/>
me? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Selfless acts are wonderful.<br/>
Most of the cool things Kirby has done, I&#39;ll never know about.  But to some <br/>
degree he knows.  Some he&#39;s really used to and doesn&#39;t much notice anymore.  <br/>
He&#39;s exceptionally kind to clerks and waitresses.  He&#39;s patient with little kids <br/>
asking for help (if they&#39;re not Holly, and sometimes Holly).  <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who always takes a cart in when he goes to the grocery store <br/>
or WalMart.  Not a cart for him to use, necessarily, but just picks one up <br/>
from the parking lot and returns it.  He&#39;s not announcing it. He&#39;s not counting.  <br/>
He feels better when he does it than when he doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people and their kids have seen Cast Away, with Tom Hanks on the <br/>
island alone.  We know he wasn&#39;t REALLY alone on an island, but considering the <br/>
possibility that a person would be...   What are the benefits of being &quot;good&quot; <br/>
when one is all alone, and what would &quot;good&quot; look like?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When a child is left alone in the house for a few hours, what would <br/>
&quot;goodness&quot; look like?<br/>
When I&#39;m home all alone sometimes I take a nap or read the whole time.  <br/>
Sometimes not.  It&#39;s worth thinking about, though.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963938765">***A list-mate was defining &#39;Enlightened Self Interest&#39; where a person<br/>
does <br/>
something nice for someone else because they believe doing such means<br/>
that <br/>
something nice will happen to themselves.***<br/>
<br/>
I posted about the immediate benefits of being kind versus unkind. <br/>
Someone else brought up Ayn Rand&#39;s thoughts on enlightened self interest.<br/>
<br/>
I was responding to the poster who asked - paraphrasing- if there is no<br/>
greater purpose why be kind at all?<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t recommending people be kind for some sneaky personal gain.  I<br/>
was making an observation.   Kindness benefits us right now in our lives<br/>
here on planet Earth.<br/>
<br/>
The other idea, I guess, is that good people get rewarded in the<br/>
afterlife. <br/>
 <br/>
***Isn&#39;t it better if we do something nice for another person/the world<br/>
simply <br/>
because we WANT to do something nice?***<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  But we don&#39;t always want to do nice things when the other person<br/>
needs it.   I didn&#39;t want to split and stack a cord of wood for my mom<br/>
Sunday night after a long camping weekend.  I wanted to take a shower and<br/>
wash the dog and go to bed.    <br/>
<br/>
But I did it because I have a pretty nice mom, who&#39;s eighty one and who<br/>
couldn&#39;t have done it herself.  I did it because she was worried someone<br/>
would steal it before it was stacked beside her back door.  I did it<br/>
because I can think of a million nice things she&#39;s done for me. <br/>
<br/>
I could have waited and done it today but that would have meant more<br/>
worry for her.  Maybe she would have tried to move those big pieces of<br/>
larch herself with the wheelbarrow.  Maybe she would have fallen or just<br/>
been upset that no one was there to help her. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want to take care of my pop when he was dying but he took care<br/>
of me for sixteen years and it seemed the least I could do. <br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t have been better for my mom to wait and worry about her wood.<br/>
 I wouldn&#39;t have been better for my pop if I only came around when I felt<br/>
like I really wanted to. <br/>
<br/>
I stretch some because I am pretty sure I&#39;m going to need some niceness<br/>
sometime and I do hope it&#39;ll be there.  I don&#39;t think that&#39;s much<br/>
different than someone else striving to be good in order to make it into<br/>
to the kingdom of Heaven, or trying to live an ethical life so they can<br/>
stand to look at themselves in the mirror, or modeling goodness to their<br/>
kids so their kids will know how to be good people. <br/>

She didn&#39;t believe in charity or generosity.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes.  It was anti-communist and anti-Christian kind of philosophy about the <br/>
individual and capitalism, expressed though novels mostly, but there were <br/>
subscriptions to recordings (on 33 rpm records, a friend&#39;s dad used to get them) of <br/>
further musings.   <br/>
Anthem (the only short one with very few characters, so the easiest read)<br/>
Atlas Shrugged<br/>
The Fountainhead<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not books that make unschooling any easier, though, nor much else <br/>
easier, though it does soothe the conscience of rich people who don&#39;t want to <br/>
share any of their resources or land or time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My reward is feeling good about myself when I&#39;ve done something nice.  I like <br/>
doing nice things for people, it&#39;s kinda selfish in that way.  But if I won&#39;t <br/>
feel good afterwards, if I&#39;ll resent people later, I don&#39;t offer, or I say <br/>
no.  I&#39;d agree with you that the expectation of anything in return can cause <br/>
resentment and rifts in relationships.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like lending money.  If someone needs some cash and I have it and don&#39;t <br/>
need it, it&#39;s theirs, but I never expect it back.  If they pay me back because <br/>
they want to, fine.  But I don&#39;t lend, I give.  Same thing, in my mind.  If I <br/>
don&#39;t have it to spare, I say no, no guilt.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t expect anything in return for a favor.  But I also am no longer <br/>
friends with people who take and take and never give, either.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, Karma IS in the back of my mind, however, and I do believe that what you <br/>
put out, you get back.  So I&#39;m either neutral or positive as much as <br/>
possible.  Self interest, there, definitely.  <br/>
