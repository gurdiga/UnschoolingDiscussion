<div id="ygrps-yiv-386578565">-=-I&#39;ve tried punishment in the sense <br/>
of taking things away (no  treats for two days, Gameboy taken away, etc.) <br/>
and this does not seem to  affect him.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
It does affect him, but not in a way that makes things better.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Treats&quot;?  Treats is a dangerous concept anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-=- So I am trying now to simply ignore <br/>
it and just tell him &quot;You can  not hit&quot; and moving away from him. Yes, he <br/>
will follow me, but if it&#39;s my  attention he&#39;s after, hopefully he will see <br/>
that hitting is not the way to  get it. I suppose it will just take time, <br/>
like anything else!-=-<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;You cannot hit&quot; isn&#39;t good information.  Obviously he CAN hit.   He&#39;s doing <br/>
it regularly.<br/>
And ignoring him? If he NEEDS attention, it&#39;s a need.  Withholding  attention <br/>
from a kid who needs attention is like withholding food from a kid who  needs <br/>
food, or the bed from a kid who&#39;s sleepy.<br/>
 <br/>
Something is happening before he hits. That&#39;s what I think you should look  <br/>
at. Maybe it&#39;s that something is NOT happening.<br/>
 <br/>
Others here might have suggestions of books that would help you, but I  think <br/>
ignoring him is a really bad thing, and &quot;withholding treats&quot; sounds like  <br/>
conditioning and that&#39;s not the way to go if you want him to understand and  <br/>
think, rather than to perform behaviors (like a trained animal).<br/>
 <br/>
Six isn&#39;t too young to talk to him like a person.  Are you using set  phrases <br/>
in a sing-songy voice?   Are you reciting rules and policies  that he&#39;s <br/>
learned to tune out instead of speaking to him in the moment as one  person to <br/>
another?   <br/>
 <br/>
I would tell him too, truthfully, that there are people in jail and prison  <br/>
for just hitting another person.  There are people who are older who hit  <br/>
strangers and they get hit back HARD or shot.  Hitting is just NOT  okay to do, <br/>
it&#39;s not safe, it&#39;s not right.<br/>
 <br/>
But if his life is too frustrating for him, try to alleviate his  frustration.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t ignore the hitting though, either. Sometimes I see parents <br/>
just try to keep working through on whatever the situation is that is <br/>
causing him to hit - just pretending they don&#39;t even notice that they <br/>
are being pummeled in the meantime.<br/>
<br/>
Example: mom is fixing a sandwich that the child requested and the <br/>
child thinks the mom is about to put on the wrong kind of jam. The <br/>
child starts screaming and hitting and kicking the mom - &quot;NOOOOO , not <br/>
that kind you KNOW I don&#39;t want that KIND why do you always put the <br/>
wrong kind on......&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that to just stay calm and address the jam issue, in the <br/>
face of being screamed at and hit and kicked, is not a good idea. I <br/>
think the sandwich and jam become a secondary issue at that point and I <br/>
don&#39;t think calmly and sweetly responding with, &quot;Oh, you prefer another <br/>
kind of jam,&quot; is responsive to what is really happening in that <br/>
situation. I&#39;m not advocating punishment or anything - just that going <br/>
on as if this is business as usual is sending a very very poor piece of <br/>
information to the kid. Sandra said, for example, that when people are <br/>
older and they lash out like that, they can get hit back, hard, or even <br/>
shot. So a mom who pretends it isn&#39;t even happening - or ineffectually <br/>
says, sweetly, &quot;Honey, I don&#39;t like it when you hit me. Now (even <br/>
though she is STILL being attacked) what kind of jam would you like?&quot; <br/>
is really teaching the kid that hitting and screaming ARE the best ways <br/>
to quickly get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
There are obviously other things going on with kids who are hitting and <br/>
screaming at their parents like that. Some kids are very much more <br/>
easily frustrated with the usual minor things that happen in life - <br/>
like mom pulling the wrong jam out of the refrigerator. And they need a <br/>
TON of help to learn to handle frustration. But it truly is NOT helpful <br/>
to them for parents to tolerate hitting and screaming at them, either.<br/>
<br/>
Parents with kids who do this can often head it off if they&#39;ll take a <br/>
LOT of time and make an effort to not add to the frustration of the <br/>
kid. ALWAYS ask questions - never assume. &quot;So you want peanut butter <br/>
and jelly? What kind of jelly? Lots of it or a little? Do you want your <br/>
sandwich cut in half this way or that way?&quot; And so on.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard.<br/>
<br/>
And a parent can only do so much - with other kids and other demands on <br/>
them, they can&#39;t make life completely frustration-free for their child.<br/>
<br/>
I think parents should stay kind and caring - but be very clear, too, <br/>
&quot;Sweetheart, I&#39;m not going to let you hit me or kick me. I REALLY want <br/>
to help you out, but first you absolutely must stop hitting and kicking <br/>
and then we&#39;ll TALK about what&#39;s frustrating you so much and we&#39;ll find <br/>
a solution.&quot; Or, sometimes, it helps with littler kids to say, &quot;Do not <br/>
hit me - say &quot;I AM FRUSTRATED&quot; instead.&quot; Helping them have the exact <br/>
words to say when those intense and out of control feelings arise, is <br/>
often really effective.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t think ignoring them is a good idea - that comes from the <br/>
behaviorist idea of &#39;extinguishing&#39; a negative behavior by not <br/>
responding to it. It is a Skinnerian conditioning technique. In fact, I <br/>
think other things should stop and the behavior itself should be the <br/>
focus. If the child won&#39;t let you hold them - then just standing there <br/>
gently waiting might be good. Lecturing isn&#39;t good. If you say <br/>
something once, don&#39;t keep repeating it in different ways. That&#39;s just <br/>
more frustration and irritation and the child will stop listening <br/>
anyway.If they won&#39;t stop hitting or kicking you, I&#39;d go behind a <br/>
closed door to protect myself. I just think it is a really really bad <br/>
idea for parents to let their kids keep on hitting and kicking them.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the work to stop the hitting and screaming is done when the <br/>
child is NOT hitting and screaming. Partly it is the parent being more <br/>
alert to what kinds of things lead to it - and heading them off and <br/>
helping the child anticipate them too. When NOT in a hitting situation, <br/>
say, &quot;So, I noticed that when we&#39;re getting ready to go out, that&#39;s a <br/>
time that is really stressful and we often have blow-ups then. I&#39;m <br/>
thinking about what we can do to make those times easier. Like, I was <br/>
thinking that I could give you more information about when we&#39;re going <br/>
to be going places and what we&#39;re going to be doing. What do you think? <br/>
Any other ideas?&quot; &quot;Or maybe we could have some clothes picked out every <br/>
day to be those clothes you&#39;ll wear when we&#39;re going out, so you don&#39;t <br/>
have to try to pick them out when it is already time to go.&quot; And so on.<br/>
<br/>
Also - I talked to my explosive child a lot about what she felt like in <br/>
the moments before she exploded and that seemed to really help - what <br/>
signs to look for that her anger or frustration level was reaching a <br/>
critical point and what to do immediately (like breathing deeply three <br/>
times before doing anything else).<br/>
<br/>
Hard stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point. Most of what I&#39;ve dealt with has been one outburst, so we <br/>
could move ahead with a calm-down period and then talking. But yeh, a <br/>
growth spurt at 3.5 had ds hitting and hitting, so I would sometimes <br/>
take dd into the kitchen and close the gate. Yes, I want to find a <br/>
way to deal with the situation without adding more negative emotions, <br/>
but not at the expense of getting hit again. Same thing with hitting <br/>
another child--it doesn&#39;t matter that he doesn&#39;t like me picking him <br/>
up when he&#39;s mad, the hitting has to stop.<br/>

<br/>
------------------<br/>
 <br/>
I agree.<br/>
 <br/>
The mom could have let him pick his jam in advance.<br/>
The mom could have asked him to help.<br/>
 <br/>
If it were me, I would pointedly put down all implements of sandwich making  <br/>
entirely, so the kid saw that sandwich making had been suspended until yelling <br/>
 stopped.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Yes.  And REALLY pay attention to the child.<br/>
 <br/>
When I&#39;ve seen the worst such melt-downs myself, the mom was talking to  <br/>
other moms, or being on the phone, or somehow just pretending to listen to the  <br/>
kid out of the corner of her awareness without really stopping the other  <br/>
activity and looking right at her child and being (with all her being, thought,  <br/>
focus) with him.  FIVE SECONDS of real attention can avert a rage.<br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
Too many words.<br/>
 <br/>
A frustrated human (even an adult) whose mind is spinning can&#39;t hear  all <br/>
that.  It will infuriate him more.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;STOP. Talk.  Breathe and talk.&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s my recommendation if someone wants a scripted message.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- When NOT in a hitting situation, <br/>
say, &quot;So, I noticed that when  we&#39;re getting ready to go out, that&#39;s a <br/>

to be going places and what we&#39;re going to be doing.  What do you think? <br/>
Any other ideas?&quot; -=-<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe the mom could just TRY the things she thinks will work andnot make it  <br/>
the child&#39;s responsibility to help her figure out how to be an attentive and  <br/>
prepared mom. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Or maybe we could have some clothes picked out every <br/>
day to be  those clothes you&#39;ll wear when we&#39;re going out, so you don&#39;t <br/>
have to try to  pick them out when it is already time to go.&quot; And so on.<br/>
-=-<br/>
 <br/>
A mom having had that thought should act on the thought.  If clothes  or <br/>
finding shoes are an issue, the night before or an hour before, the mom  should <br/>
say &quot;What are you going to wear?  Where is it?&quot; and help the child  get the <br/>
clothes into a found, available state.  If the child doesn&#39;t know  where his coat <br/>
is, the mom probably doesn&#39;t either.  Until such age as a  child doesn&#39;t need <br/>
the mom&#39;s help anymore (even if that&#39;s 20 years old), the mom  should help and <br/>
not blame the kid for not knowing where something is or not  knowing what he <br/>
wants to wear, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
-=Also - I talked to my explosive child a lot about what she felt like in  <br/>
the moments before she exploded and that seemed to really help - what  <br/>
signs to look for that her anger or frustration level was reaching a  <br/>
critical point -=-<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s what I meant by something is happening just before the  hitting.  I <br/>
could see the signs in Kirby.  He would tighten up.   His face and posture would <br/>
get hard, like he was on the alert for the coming  last straw.  And so I <br/>
would try to back him back to a point where he could  handle another five or six <br/>
frustrations, not just help him maintain his &quot;last  straw&quot; status.<br/>
 <br/>
Emotional explosions follow emotional build-ups.  Parents who  habitually <br/>
ignore the buildup and then try to figure out how to manage the  volcanic <br/>
activity might work on being better managers of the peace of their  families.<br/>
 <br/>
It has been years since Kirby has had any scenes of frustration, but he  used <br/>
to.  We worked to give him tools to use so that he could sense his own  <br/>
building emotions, and philosophical ideas and principles that helped him see  the <br/>
value in being calmer and more understanding.  It didn&#39;t happen all in  one <br/>
year, but it did happen.  (Karate helped too, and that&#39;s another  standing <br/>
recommendation as far as I&#39;m concerned for any child who lashes out  physically:  <br/>
martial arts training in a school that emphasizes  character, control, defense <br/>
and the history of the form.)<br/>

We had a turkey running around at our park day a few weeks ago - yeah, <br/>
a turkey. (We do not live in a place where turkeys run around wild.)<br/>
<br/>
It was tame - and kids around 4 to 6 years old were chasing it and <br/>
throwing sand right in its face. I didn&#39;t know the kids (it wasn&#39;t the <br/>
kids in our group). The adults who were with those kids were all at a <br/>
table - half watching. There was no way that they weren&#39;t aware - but <br/>
they were ignoring. I stood between the adults and the kids, facing the <br/>
kids and said, &quot;Stop NOW!&quot; Very strongly, but not too loud. They <br/>
stopped but were just obviously waiting until I turned my back to start <br/>
up again. Some of us herded the turkey away from the playground and <br/>
eventually one of our group took it over to the nearby animal shelter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716746480">First I&#39;d like to say that I love this list - what a great source of <br/>
support and ideas!  My responses to various posts below:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Six isn&#39;t too young to talk to him like a person.  Are you using set  phrases<br/>
&gt;in a sing-songy voice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, but I do repeat myself often. I am also too long-winded, but working on <br/>
this. I feel like there&#39;s so much contradictory info when it comes to <br/>
parenting! Some say repetition is needed for children to learn, others say <br/>
it will just make the child &quot;turn off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I would tell him too, truthfully, that there are people in jail and prison<br/>
&gt;for just hitting another person.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have done this. Asked him what he thought would happen if I hit our <br/>
neighbor, and explained that the neighbor would call the police and I would <br/>
go to jail. My son thought about that for a moment, but it didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
make a big impact and certainly didn&#39;t stop future hitting incidents.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wouldn&#39;t ignore the hitting though, either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t clear when I said I would &quot;ignore&quot; him. I do not stand there and <br/>
let him hit me. I make it clear that it&#39;s NOT ok to behave this way and I <br/>
move away from him to protect myself. By &quot;ignore&quot; I meant &quot;walk away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also - I talked to my explosive child a lot about what she felt like in<br/>
&gt;the moments before she exploded and that seemed to really help<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son doesn&#39;t (can&#39;t?) talk about his feelings. If I bring the issues up <br/>
when he is calm, he will say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;I can&#39;t remember.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some kids are very much more<br/>
&gt;easily frustrated with the usual minor things that happen in life -<br/>
&gt;like mom pulling the wrong jam out of the refrigerator.<br/>
&gt;Most of the work to stop the hitting and screaming is done when the<br/>
&gt;child is NOT hitting and screaming. Partly it is the parent being more<br/>
&gt;alert to what kinds of things lead to it - and heading them off and<br/>
&gt;helping the child anticipate them too.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my challenge.  Many times I can recognize what will set him off. <br/>
But then there are times when I can&#39;t. Example: I am nursing the baby and <br/>
he is sitting next to me watching TV, everything is fine. Then a commercial <br/>
will come on (or the show is over) and it&#39;s like he suddenly realizes I am <br/>
nursing the baby and not sitting there waiting to execute his next command. <br/>
So he&#39;ll just growl at me or punch me. Not a tantrum or meltdown, just a <br/>
frustrated punch out of the blue. Typically, I will try to put words to his <br/>
feelings, acknowledging that he may be bored and why don&#39;t we read a book <br/>
or play cards or something else I can do while nursing. His response is <br/>
usually to ask to do something he *knows* I can&#39;t do while nursing. It&#39;s <br/>
very antagonistic - almost as if he&#39;s *looking* for a reason to get mad.<br/>
<br/>
Question: If I try to avert possibly volatile situations and tip-toe around <br/>
him, will he learn to handle frustration?  Or will he just learn that Mommy <br/>
will &quot;make everything ok?&quot; Example:  He knows that I know the *right* way <br/>
to cut/prepare his food. So when Dad has to make his food, he lashes out <br/>
and insists Mommy has to do it. And he often gets angry and hits when dh & <br/>
I are talking (presumably because no one is paying attention to him). <br/>
Doesn&#39;t he need to learn that he can not *always* be the center of <br/>
attention? I mean, my husband and I can&#39;t hold all our conversations until <br/>
he goes to bed in hopes that this will head off an outburst.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-539416022">Hi Shannon- I just wanted to offer some possible advice.  I missed the post <br/>
that said how old your son is, but I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s around 3 1/2 by his <br/>
behavior.  His behavior is fairly developmentally correct, while it may seem <br/>
extreme.  But there is still a chance that this could be part of his temperament and <br/>
a book like The Explosive Child offers an excellent method for helping <br/>
children cope with frustration, and finding collaborative solutions.  Because your <br/>
son is young and doesn&#39;t have the language he needs to tell you what is wrong, <br/>
your skills of intuition and empathy are going to be critical.  Then you may <br/>
need to provide your son with the language, using some trial and error.  For <br/>
example, with the nursing and watching TV scenario.  You correctly figured out <br/>
that he was choosing an activity that you couldn&#39;t possibly do while nursing.  <br/>
From your perspective, this is antagonistic.  From his, he&#39;s just testing you <br/>
to see if his needs are as important to you as the baby&#39;s.  You could start by <br/>
saying to him, &quot;You must feel like Baby gets a lot of Mommie&#39;s attention <br/>
because he&#39;s nursing.  I bet you wish you could have Mommy all to yourself again.&quot;  <br/>
First empathize- this will take practice and he may not get it right away.  <br/>
Then, after helping him name his feelings, find a solution.  It might require <br/>
putting the baby down for 5-10 minutes, if he&#39;s not shrieking, or promising to <br/>
do something just with your son, say during the babies nap.  &quot;Hey babies sure <br/>
take a lot of time and work, maybe you can help me soothe him while he nurses <br/>
himself to sleep- then we can do something together.&quot;  Yes- you can keep <br/>
repeating the Don&#39;t hit mantra, but most likely your son already knows its not OK <br/>
to hit, he just doesn&#39;t have the other tools to resapond to his frustration.  <br/>
So instead, he&#39;s frustrated AND convinced that he&#39;s a bad, unlovable boy <br/>
because he&#39;s hitting.  Try also, The Challenging Child, by Stanley Greenspan, which <br/>
advocates&quot;floor time&quot; with each of your children.  But really- The Explosive <br/>
Child, by Dr. Ross Green is the best.  Wow that was long- hope it helps.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s so interesting! I have tried - with increasing success as the <br/>
kids have gotten older - NOT to tell them things they already know as <br/>
if I don&#39;t think they remember. First, it is annoying and I don&#39;t want <br/>
my kids to think of me as annoying. Second, it isn&#39;t useful information <br/>
if they KNOW it already, so why say it? Mostly, though, it is because I <br/>
think it undermines their own sense of responsibility. I&#39;ve seen kids <br/>
doing something - something I KNOW they know is not appropriate. They <br/>
keep watching their parent, waiting to see if the parent will say <br/>
anything, as if it is the parent saying something that makes it okay or <br/>
not okay. I&#39;ve heard kids say, &quot;But you didn&#39;t tell me not to,&quot; as if <br/>
that made something okay for them to do EVEN though they knew, <br/>
themselves, that it wasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I try really hard to offer information rather than tell them what to <br/>
do, too. Remember to think about what THEY are thinking inside their <br/>
own head in response to what you&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>
What we WISH - what parents often imagine the kids are thinking in <br/>
response to: &quot;Pick up your towel and hang it up, please,&quot; is &quot;Oh yes, I <br/>
should pick up this towel right now and hang it up nicely because then <br/>
it&#39;ll be nice and dry and clean next time I want to use it and my mom <br/>
won&#39;t have so much laundry to do and the house will look neater and it <br/>
is a good habit to put things away right away, not leave them for <br/>
later, because we all know how later sometimes never comes and I&#39;m so <br/>
glad my mom reminded me to put this towel away.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Reality:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pick up that towel and hang it up.&quot; (&quot;You don&#39;t have to order me <br/>
around like that.&quot;) Coercion always feels bad - always creates some <br/>
amount of resistance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The towel is wet and will make the carpet wet and it&#39;ll get moldy.&quot; <br/>
(&quot;How many times have you told me that, do you think I&#39;m stupid or <br/>
what? And I really don&#39;t think that little bit of wetness is going to <br/>
make the carpet moldy anyway, so you&#39;re either not very smart or you&#39;re <br/>
exaggerating.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pick the towel up NOW, please.&quot; (&quot;Sheesh, can&#39;t it wait one minute? <br/>
You&#39;re so impatient. Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m in the middle of something? <br/>
Don&#39;t you trust me to come back and do it in a second?&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t you <br/>
think what I&#39;m doing now is more important than picking up a stupid <br/>
towel?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pick up the towel and hang it up so it&#39;ll be nice and dry next time <br/>
you want it. PIcking things up when we first drop them is a lot easier <br/>
than having to around clean up everything later. Isn&#39;t it nicer when <br/>
the house is neat and orderly. Putting things away means they&#39;re there <br/>
when you need them later.&quot; (How many TIMES do you have to say these <br/>
things to me? Do you think I can&#39;t hear or what?&quot; &quot;Blah blah blah blah <br/>
blah blah blah....&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
None of those are the kinds of things we want our kids to be thinking <br/>
in response to what we say to them.<br/>
<br/>
So - if our kid keeps dropping wet towels on the carpet, what do we do?<br/>
<br/>
What would you say to another adult who was walking away leaving their <br/>
wet towel on the carpet?<br/>
Possibly, lightly and casually, remind them as they walk away? &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
forget your towel.&quot; Or - even more likely - just pick it up - maybe <br/>
hand it to them and say, &quot;Oh, here is your towel.&quot; (&quot;Whoops - I almost <br/>
forgot it.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Or - maybe a questioning tone - &quot;Do you want to take your towel?&quot; (&quot;Oh <br/>
- yeah, thanks.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
OFTEN - if the kid is busy, &quot;I&#39;ll hang up your towel for you.&quot; <br/>
(&quot;Thanks.&quot;)  Took some practice to say that without sounding annoyed - <br/>
just helpful.<br/>
<br/>
A good exercise to get better at this stuff is to try to say just one <br/>
word. Yep - ONE word. In a nice tone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Towel.&quot; (Huh? Towel? What? Oh yeah - she means I should pick up my <br/>
towel and hang it up.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I really suggest trying the one word approach. It can be a real <br/>
eye-opener and change the atmosphere of a home a LOT.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090784802">i agree that it&#39;s not ok to hit someone simply out of frustration. <br/>
but i am not sure about saying that it&#39;s NEVER ok to hit. if some kid <br/>
hits my daughter, i don&#39;t want her to run to me and point them out, i <br/>
want her to hit them back. maybe first give them the benefit of <br/>
yelling &#39;hey, don&#39;t hit me&#39; in case it was an accident and they might <br/>
