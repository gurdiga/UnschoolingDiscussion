<div id="ygrps-yiv-779195752">I got a message today with a subject line, &quot;Invitation to Join the <br/>
Unschooling2 Group.  I was suspicious because it talks about the <br/>
unschooling group you now are a member of having a technical problem.  The <br/>
only fast solution is to start a new one with a similar name.  First of <br/>
all, there *is* no Yahoo group with that name.  You&#39;re supposed to go <br/>
straight to that group&#39;s page, which of course is not on the Yahoo site at <br/>
all.  It&#39;s groups.yahoo.com rather than yahoogroups.com.  I&#39;m guessing <br/>
going there could get you a nice new worm or something for your <br/>
computer.  Please be careful, and if you&#39;ve already gone there, make sure <br/>
you scan your computer with good anti-virus software.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I figured this one out.  I still don&#39;t know why I couldn&#39;t find the new <br/>
group when searching, but I remembered that I&#39;m nomail on the unschooling <br/>
list and went there.  There was a message about the technical problem there.<br/>

I got one of those too Tia and I also got an e-mail from the list from the <br/>
owner saying that he had to change the list for the reasons you stated. So the <br/>
list is still the same?<br/>

on that one nomail.  Sorry to worry anybody.<br/>
