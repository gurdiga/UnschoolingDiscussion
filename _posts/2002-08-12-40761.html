&gt; I think vouchers would be a fine idea, especially if they were used the way<br/>

Hey, it&#39;s OUR money.<br/>

&gt; But the difficulty here is that money is being taken for education from way<br/>
&gt; more than just parents of school aged children.  All those retired people<br/>
&gt; and people with no children are going to want a say in how the money is spent.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, they might.  But do you believe that they have a say in how it&#39;s spent<br/>
now? I&#39;ve been going to school board meetings and listening to how school<br/>
employees treat parents for years, and I must agree with the careful<br/>
observers who say that the schools do whatever suits them with no regard<br/>
whatsoever to what the public wants or what is best for the children, unless<br/>
it happens to boost the school spending or employment roster.<br/>
<br/>
One author says that schools consider parents to be &quot;unenlightened,<br/>
bothersome appendages&quot; to the children.<br/>
<br/>
As for retired and childless people, Why not include homeschoolers and those<br/>
who send their kids to private schools. Do we (they) get a say in how school<br/>
funds are spent? Heck no. More than likely, we are told that we are<br/>
&quot;interlopers&quot; and &quot;anti-education meddlers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone tell us why any of those groups should be forced to pay for the<br/>
public schools? (yes, I&#39;m familiar with the &quot;public good&quot; argument, but<br/>
there are lots of public goods that people are taxed for.)<br/>
<br/>
Should we not discuss this? Whose money is it? We are among the people who<br/>
pay, but are not allowed to say how the money is spent.<br/>
<br/>
If we can discuss something so absurdly impertinent as Hell -- without<br/>
protest -- why not this, which affects us all.<br/>
