&gt; &gt; I have been &quot;teaching&quot; for 4 years now. I had a year of adjusting and <br/>
&gt; &gt; feeling out the system, followed by a year of trying to change the <br/>
&gt; &gt; system, then another year of changing the system. I have done much <br/>
&gt; &gt; deep thought on school and educating. I feel at times the suffering <br/>
&gt; &gt; that the children dont even realize that they are going through. The <br/>
&gt; &gt; system does NOT work! Not in any way shape or form! EDUCATING is not <br/>
&gt; &gt; a good way to learn. Children need to learn not be &quot;educated&quot;. I see <br/>
&gt; &gt; rooms full of blank, unattached, and bored faces.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I commend all of you on the courage to unschool your children. My <br/>
&gt; &gt; concern is to those children whose families either dont have a clue <br/>
&gt; &gt; or dont care about whats best for their children. I would love to <br/>
&gt; &gt; create an alternative that will benefit them. any comments or <br/>
&gt; &gt; suggestions? Thanks for listening......... </span></blockquote></div>

 </span></blockquote>Have you checked into Sudbury Schools? They try to offer free learning<br/>
through a school setting.<br/>
<br/>
People have started up learning centers. I&#39;m vaguely remembering websites<br/>
that people suggested where such things are discussed.<br/>
<br/>
The *biggest* problem with institutionalizing unschooling is that it<br/>
eliminates free choice. Kids (generally) have to be there. And they have to<br/>
choose from what&#39;s available rather than what the parents can help them<br/>
reach out and get.<br/>
<br/>
The other problem is accountability. If you&#39;re responsible for someone<br/>
else&#39;s child, it&#39;s reasonable that they&#39;re going to have certain<br/>
expectations. With unschooling, a child could spend a full week watching TV.<br/>
A parent could understandably think the child could be doing that at home<br/>
and be expecting more if they&#39;re paying someone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1258243169">I agree with you but I think the *biggest* problem is not the <br/>
elimination of free choice (don&#39;t they have that at Sudbury?).  I <br/>
think the biggest problem is taking kids out of the real world.  My <br/>
kids learn the most when we are out doing things and meeting people <br/>
or at home living life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about this a lot.  I would love to open a very small <br/>
school one day about 5 kids or so.  But, even though I hope it will <br/>
be a much better alternative to traditional schooling, I know it <br/>
won&#39;t be an &quot;unschooling school&quot;. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239398121">A lot of Sudburys have attendance requirements.  So if you choose <br/>
Sudbury, you have to attend a certain number of hours per week.  The <br/>
one in PA requires either 30 or 35, can&#39;t remember which it was.  But <br/>
it was an average of 6 or 7 hours a day.  <br/>

<br/>
Matt how about assisting parents in getting to homeschooling/unschooling? <br/>
Maybe showing them that their is another alternative to spending hundreds on <br/>
books.<br/>
 Maybe by way of portfolios? <br/>
I know for us we are required to do that or test. I would love to know that <br/>
there is another teacher in Maine that is unschooling friendly. I know quite a <br/>
few families that are unschooling or new to unschooling looking for one to do <br/>
their portfolios near York Co.<br/>
If your interested email me.<br/>
