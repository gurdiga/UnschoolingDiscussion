<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972850988">The sci-fi thread reminded me of this one for independent reading or<br/>
family read-aloud.  We just finished reading &quot;Skellig&quot;.  The main<br/>
character is a boy who finds a man (bum? angel?) living in his garage. <br/>
His parents are preoccupied with his baby sister, who is not well.  The<br/>
neighbor girl is homeschooled.  They strike up a friendship and attempt<br/>
to help the strange man, who is not quite of this world.<br/>
