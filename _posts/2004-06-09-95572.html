<br/>
2nd Annual Nevada Homeschool Network Convention<br/>
June 18 and 19, 2004<br/>
Calvary Community, 2900 N. Torrey Pines Dr.<br/>
<br/>
Not an unschooling conference, a variety show of homeschooling topics.  The <br/>
way it&#39;s set up (seems to be) is that each particular homeschooling group there <br/>
is sponsoring a speaker.   I&#39;m sponsored by Las Vegas Life Learners, a new <br/>
unschooling group there.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LVLifelearners/</a><br/>
<br/>
Other people I know to be on the unschooling side of life are Connie Colten;<br/>
and Elissa Wahl who&#39;s one of the authors of Christian unschooling; and <br/>
Steve and Kimberly Patrow who used to live in Albuquerque and were active in <br/>
The Goof Group, a weekly unschooling group we used to have here when Kirby and <br/>
Marty were younger.<br/>
<br/>
Other workshop and presentation descriptions are about control and biblical <br/>
mandates and other things I have no interest in.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an HSLDA guy.<br/>
The main speaker is Reb Bradley, who seems to be a preacher more than <br/>
anything else. <br/>
<br/>
There are some things Holly might like, though.   I hope she has fun.  <br/>
<br/>
And then on Sunday the unschooling group is going to get together for a <br/>
picnic or barbecue and then we can REALLY talk about unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
The arrangements for this were fairly recent, but I wish I had put a notice <br/>
here sooner.  I kept forgetting.  And it&#39;s not a conference to really invite <br/>
doubting spouses or parents to.  I could be in for some flak or criticism, and <br/>
no doubt there will be a room full of revisionist propaganda and advice for <br/>
keeping kids down and small.   I will be a threat to the idea that of course <br/>
parents have to make kids learn  (etc.)<br/>
<br/>
-=- at the door it will be $25/single and $35/family-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too much just to hear the unschoolers, I think. But I&#39;m glad to get to meet <br/>
more unschoolers and maybe help them out.<br/>

speak.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042450801">I&#39;d be happy to drive to Vegas and pay to hear you speak. I saw you <br/>
speak a few years ago in Long Beach. You changed our lives. Will you <br/>
be giving a similar talk this time? I am always interested in what <br/>
you have to say. The picnic sounds fun. We are always looking to <br/>
meet more unschoolers.<br/>

The picnic is going to be on Monday (because of Father&#39;s Day, it turns out).  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re being taken touristing Sunday, so if you were there then maybe you<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I saw you <br/>

<br/>
Would that be good or bad for you?  I&#39;m still planning the Saturday speech <br/>
and could steal good parts of what you hear if you want.  Do you remember which <br/>
year it was? (If you want to write to me on the side, go peek here and write <br/>
and let me know.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/speaking)">http://sandradodd.com/speaking)</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re supposed to be all-new talks, and the one with Holly will surely be!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the positive feedback.<br/>
I liked those conferences, and partly because I always stayed at Pam <br/>
Sorooshian&#39;s, and it was a great thing for me to see her kids in that snapshot way, <br/>
where you haven&#39;t seen someone for a year and you get the kind of... time-lapse <br/>
effect of the learning and growth curves.<br/>
<br/>
Just this afternoon Holly and I jumped forward and backward through a new DVD <br/>
we had made from a tape of all of Kirby&#39;s karate belt tests.  I wanted to <br/>
back it up because tapes don&#39;t last forever, and he has another belt test <br/>
Tuesday.  It&#39;s something the dojo does, when kids test, and I think it&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
But we were jumping &quot;search&quot; &quot;search&quot; and it would skip a bit forward.  We <br/>
saw his belt colors change, his hair getting longer until it was waist-length <br/>
and tied back, and the short again.  He got more confident, and taller, kind of <br/>
all of a sudden. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds so fun. We have a friend that built his own house. He <br/>
talked his neighbor across the street into setting up a video camera <br/>
on a tripod in his front window that took a frame every few minutes <br/>
I think. It was so fun to watch and see the house go up before your <br/>
eyes.<br/>
<br/>
More fun though, I think, to watch your son grow from a boy, into a <br/>
man. Even in real time, it does seem like all of a sudden. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Oh you are so right!  I remember when my son&#39;s voice changed.  It was literally overnight.  And to watch him fill out, and live like an adult...wow.<br/>
<br/>
Then I think back to when he was a little kid and I think &quot;sheesh, it seems like a whole other life!&quot;.<br/>

Kirby and Marty have gone to Dallas/Arlington for the weekend, and it&#39;s just <br/>
me, Keith and Holly.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing for a parent-plus-subset-of-children to be gone.  Next weekend <br/>
it will be just Keith and the boys here.  But for children to be FAR gone <br/>
without parents is  [stuck for a word, rejecting &quot;creepy&quot; and &quot;harbinger of <br/>
doom&quot;]    ...   not a phase I had quite foreseen.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s moving out (bye, oh take some dishes and sheets, we&#39;ll bring you some <br/>
houseplants if you want, yeah, sure we can pay your deposits), but there are <br/>
intermediate steps I hadn&#39;t fantasized.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yea, I think having almost grown kids far away without a parent <br/>
would be...disconcerting, even if you know they are capable of <br/>
taking care of themselves. I haven&#39;t had to deal with that one yet, <br/>
although I know those days are fast approaching, much too quickly <br/>
for me. I feel for you Sandra. If it were me, I imagine I would have <br/>
the broken record of &#39;I wonder what they&#39;re doing right now, I hope <br/>
they&#39;re OK&#39; playing in my head.<br/>

I tried to e-mail you privately about the Vegas conference, did you <br/>
