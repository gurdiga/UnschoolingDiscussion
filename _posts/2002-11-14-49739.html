thought about running to the &quot;milk machine&quot; for my mom in years! My memories <br/>
are very vague, since I was really small, but very pleasant.<br/>

My &gt; dh remembers milk vending machines on street corners of Buffalo, NY.  I&#39;d <br/>

&gt; love it if milk was delivered to my door daily, it would save me the late <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753722670">We had a huckster who came by with a truck full of fruits, vegtables,<br/>
gum and candy - ice cream too! We used to get the fudgesicles that as<br/>
soon as they were in the heat would form a thin sheet of ice on them -<br/>
watch that tongue. They were SO good. Can&#39;t find that kind any more.<br/>
Fire balls. Bubble gum. Umm. We had the Hood man come with milk and<br/>
juice. A nice man came with a truck load of donuts and breads. We use to<br/>
tease grandma to buy the powder sugar donuts and the cardboard container<br/>
full of little cookies - I liked the ones made of coconut and the ones<br/>
with the little red jelly that was hard and chewy in the middle. We<br/>
would swim for hours in my grandmothers pond. It was so big people for<br/>
miles around came to swim, too. I spent hours and hours there as a child<br/>
catching fish - some the size of quarters - little sunfish or bluegills.<br/>
I would dig in the muck where ever I saw a little hole and find a crab<br/>
to toss into a bucket full of pollywogs, frogs, baby turtle the size of<br/>
quarters, etc. My hair would end up the same color as my tan. We would<br/>
ice skate in the winter. Have a bonfire. Pop popcorn over the open fire<br/>
with my grandmothers old popcorn popper - long handle with black box at<br/>
the end made of metal. She used to call the fry pans, spiders. I didn&#39;t<br/>
get that the first time she asked me for one! She had a huge flower<br/>
garden and a goldfish pond. A creek ran in back of her house. Fresh mint<br/>
and horseradish grew in it. We used to go sledding there in the winter -<br/>
slidding along the bank and down another and ending up on the frozen<br/>
creek. I would walk on that creek in the dead of winter with boughs hung<br/>
heavily with snow - so peaceful and quiet. In the summer she grew<br/>
hyacynth, lily of the valley along it&#39;s banks. Sweet william and<br/>
hollyhocks. She had a grape arbor with huge purple grapes - green on the<br/>
inside with seeds. A crabapple tree. A tree with little red pears that<br/>
turned yellowish when ripe. Pear trees lined our driveway - the big<br/>
green pears that turned yellow when ripe - so many bees came then! Her<br/>
front yard was big enough to invite many kids over to play baseball.<br/>
That was where I had my first crush on Bob Barnes - red haired young man<br/>
who was more interested in tuning his first car than play ball - died in<br/>
the VietNam war. So many cherished memories... Like the Waltons. Only we<br/>
got beat and molested. Thank God for the wonderful land where I grew up<br/>
- central New York. Gosh I miss it now. Not there anymore when John<br/>
Glenn (astronaut) Blvd. was made. The state tried to say my grandmothers<br/>
land was a cess pool. Good thing she had pictures - went to court - got<br/>
money. She never acted uppity about it. She always shared the land. She<br/>
made lousy oatmeal cookies though - the woman couldn&#39;t cook:) Blessings,<br/>
Michele<br/>
