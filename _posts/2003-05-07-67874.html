<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997297442">Another note about nature watching - we saw a fisher cat in our yard yesterday. I live in Connecticut. Apparently they are rare around here. They are strange looking - but it did make for an interesting Internet Search as this one was light brown/tan whereas all of the photos I have found showed a black or dark brown animal.  My neighbor says they adapt their color to their surroundings like a deer.  I couldn&#39;t  find this info anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here have any Fisher Cat experience?  They make a really creepy sound during March & april during mating season. They sound like a screaming baby. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway - this was part of our unschooling day ;-) <br/>

&lt;&lt;Another note about nature watching - we saw a fisher cat in our yard<br/>
yesterday. I live in Connecticut. Apparently they are rare around here. They<br/>
are strange looking - but it did make for an interesting Internet Search as<br/>
this one was light brown/tan whereas all of the photos I have found showed a<br/>
black or dark brown animal.  My neighbor says they adapt their color to<br/>
their surroundings like a deer.  I couldn&#39;t  find this info anywhere.&gt;&gt;<br/>

I never heard them referred to as fisher &quot;cats&quot; before. Cute little things<br/>
though aren&#39;t they? Not that I&#39;ve seen one in my backyard or anything!!!<br/>
Don&#39;t know how rare they are in CN but that&#39;s the area where they are<br/>
supposed to be. The info I have states that they can be dark brown to<br/>
blackish while some light brown and almost creamy underneath and some even<br/>
white spots. Never saw anything in the info I have stating they change<br/>
colors. Maybe people were thinking of an ermine, they can change color to<br/>
white in the winter.<br/>
<br/>
Cool sighting though. I do miss just seeing wildlife in the backyard aside<br/>
from birds and lizards!!!<br/>
