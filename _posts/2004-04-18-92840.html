<div id="ygrps-yiv-893417324">I just sent this post into my local unschooling group and thought I would go ahead and share it here too.  This list has been pretty intense the last few days and I thought some might appreciate a light story of unschooling &quot;success-in-progress.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
************<br/>
I just wanted to share (with people who would truly appreciate it) some writing Dane just handed me.  I will put all the translations into parentheses.<br/>
<br/>
He drew out a &quot;cartoon&quot; titled Mi PT BD.  (My Pet Beetle)<br/>
I&#39;m going to try to explain this as best as I can.  There are a bunch of little drawings all over the paper and each one has a little caption bubble above its head.  The captions are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;NO&quot; (No)<br/>
&quot;OOY&quot; (Yes)<br/>
&quot;IM WAD&quot; (I&#39;m waiting)<br/>
&quot;IKBU&quot; (I can beat you)<br/>
&quot;P&quot; (pfft)<br/>
&quot;Di&quot; (die)<br/>
&quot;No&quot; (no)<br/>
&quot;Surrender&quot;  {This was actually written by Beck (8)}<br/>
&quot;UH&quot; (uh)<br/>
&quot;KM BAK&quot; (come back)<br/>
&quot;No&quot; (no)<br/>
&quot;plez&quot; (please)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say it made any sense...lol....but it was cute.  I love all the phonetic/invented spelling.  And I love that Dane is learning to read and write at his own pace and feels no shame or pressure for it.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to anyone who made it through this.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175271127">That&#39;s wonderful! I also live with a pre-reading 5 year old :)<br/>
<br/>
She looks at writing like drawing.  She has asked me to write words <br/>
down so she can copy them.  I&#39;ve noticed that when I&#39;m writing too <br/>
quickly and not paying attention, I write the letters too close <br/>
together.  She copies them exactly. It&#39;s fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to recognize whole words and has no interest in learning <br/>
individual letters or phonics.  She wants to know the whole word.</div>

<br/>
       For years I&#39;ve been quizzing my OB/GYN about when I would be <br/>
&quot;premenopausal&quot; and he keeps explaining that  it&#39;s really a long individualized <br/>
development period of years during which a woman is not &quot;premenopausal&quot; but <br/>
&quot;peri-menopausal.&quot; And there&#39;s no way to speak of that perimenopausal process as over <br/>
until after you&#39;ve obviously arrived at Menopause, disembarked and gone home. &lt;<br/>
grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       So I was wondering if there might be value in re-casting the <br/>
development of reading not as pre-reading but as a properly indeterminate and personal <br/>
time of &quot;peri-reading&quot; ?  Only half-joking, JJ<br/>

  I actually kinda like this idea!  I think I may start using it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; So I was wondering if there might be value in re-casting the <br/>
  development of reading not as pre-reading but as a properly indeterminate <br/>
and personal <br/>
  time of &quot;peri-reading&quot; ? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Emergent reader&quot; is one existing term.<br/>
<br/>
I personally think that creating stages only adds to the prejudice against <br/>
non-readers.  Maybe if not reading wasn&#39;t treated as sin or eternal separation <br/>
from literacy (it is neither of those), everyone involved would lighten up and <br/>
just calmly say &quot;She&#39;s not reading fluently yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t stages of bike riding, outside of &quot;with training wheels&quot; or <br/>
&quot;without.&quot;  Yet there&#39;s a world of difference between a five year old on a coaster <br/>
bike and a mountain racer.  Still, if one is operating the bike independently <br/>
and it&#39;s moving forward, that is riding a bike.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent can&#39;t leave a carefully printed note for a child that has <br/>
important information and know that the child can read it and act accordingly, I <br/>
don&#39;t think the child can read.  Anymore than a child who can&#39;t have a phone <br/>
conversation with someone can be considered to be fully verbal.   <br/>
<br/>
But everyone starts out not fully verbal, and most gain amazing facility <br/>
there, so why create intermediary steps?  It reminds me too much of gold star <br/>
school stuff and not enough of accepting and helping kids see the normal healthy <br/>
progressions of real life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970763775">I completely agree that defining stages and standards for each is <br/>
troublesome to unschoolers for various reasons, not the least of which is it&#39;s <br/>
needlessly schoolish. (Yes, for the same reasons transcripts and grades are <br/>
troublesome.)<br/>
<br/>
       Unschooled learning conceived as each person&#39;s unique development <br/>
continuum, unfolding its mysteries as a daily delight and proceeding along at its <br/>
own unique timetable, is best of all.<br/>
<br/>
       Peri-literacy was only mentioned as an improvement on the concept of <br/>
&quot;pre-reading&quot; and only as a gimmicky illustration at that. :)  JJ<br/>

trust that he would actually choose to follow whatever information <br/>

whenever she has enough life experience under her belt or just whenever the<br/>

<br/>
My husband teaches 9th grade English at the local high school.  It&#39;s my <br/>
firm belief that of all his students, those that like to read and that <br/>
read *voluntarily* are the ones that will reach the levels of <br/>
proficiency that will lead to them &quot;succeeding in school&quot;, being able to <br/>
pass the exit exam and being able to read college level work.  I think <br/>
that pushing reading on kids faster than they can get it is the worst <br/>
thing that one can do to them.<br/>
<br/>
If not now, in a year or so, your daughter might really like &quot;comic <br/>
books&quot; like Garfield.  My son did, when lots of text was too daunting.<br/>

Late responses are cool, like an oldies station.    You&#39;ll respond to the <br/>
good stuff!  (or the weird stuff--we heard &quot;Hey There, Little Red Riding Hood&quot; <br/>
the other day.  What drivel.  Holly and Marty had never heard it, and I could <br/>
sing the harmony and laugh along with the idiotic laugh.  I think they liked me <br/>
more before that.)<br/>
