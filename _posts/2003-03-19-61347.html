All these gadgets were meant to free up our time, give us more leisure etc etc but people seem more harassed and busy than ever. Many HS&#39;ers book playdates weeks in advance. No-one just drops round for<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, the rat race is too blame and, I think, because we have lost contact with ourselves and each other. People rush from one meeting/activity to the next. They do the same with their kids. The more<br/>
stuff you have, the more classes you do has come to be equated with how good you are. Other humans have become superficial relationships.<br/>
<br/>
30 years ago my mum raised 3 kids alone. She washed laundry by hand and dried it on the line. She walked to the shops (she couldn&#39;t afford a car until I was 25) most days. Yet she had plenty of time too<br/>
see her friends. They dug vegetable gardens together. They made wine and then sat around drinking it. I remember plenty of time to play in next doors garden.<br/>
My cousin&#39;s two children never play outside. They don&#39;t have *time*. Both parenst work so the kids go to a child-minder after school. When they are picked up it is swimming class or soccer practice or<br/>
piano lesson. Then its homework, TV and bed. Weekends are spent getting the groceries or &#39;shopping&#39;. They&#39;ve never played in a stream or made snowmen. My cousin is contsantly moaning that he has no<br/>
*time*. I&#39;ve been to his house. Both of them have shiny new cars, a wide-screen TV - the kids have TV and DVD players too (they are 7 and 4). The kids get new clothes every week.They have every labour<br/>
saving device known to man. Most of this stuff they have loans for. So they both have to work in order to pay for the stuff they bought that was meant to give them more *time*.<br/>
When I sugested to my cousin that he could work less over-time if he wasn&#39;t paying a car loan (and UK interest rates for car loans are often 17-23%) he wanted to know how he&#39;d get too work? It&#39;s a mile<br/>
away......<br/>
<br/>
It seems like madness. They are not happy, even with all this stuff they have. They rarely see family as they are so busy. They have to schedule appointments to see friends, often weeks in advance.<br/>
My cousin once said he envied me staying at home, having friends drop in unexpectedly for coffee, my long walks with the kids doing nothing in particuarly. Yet he could not see that it was his desire<br/>
for more new shiny stuff that meant that he could do none of those things. He&#39;s over-weight and stressed :-(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002560207">I&#39;m sure up on the hills of PA where I lived, it was quiet. We were on a dead end street and aside from crickets, can&#39;t see much more making noise. I just really don&#39;t remember it being quiet. <br/>
<br/>
I moved to downtown Miami when I first left home 26 years ago. The contrast was exciting and it scared me too. After all these years of being here, not anywhere near as isolated as where I grew up, I got use to noise.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago we vacationed at Anna Maria Island on the west coast of FL. Very small thin island. Our house was right on the Bay of Tampa. I remember going out on the balcony the first night and calling Joe out. I said listen. You couldn&#39;t hear a thing. Absolutely nothing. Not the water, not birds, not crickets, nothing. It was amazing to me. Sat out there with my wine for quite awhile just listening to nothing. It was wonderful but not sure if I could live like that. I actually like hearing the birds at night at the sound of the distant train going by.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513624229"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I remember an article in Mothering magazine that was about &quot;time saving&quot; <br/>
&gt;&gt;devices.  It mentioned how we now wear new clothes daily, thus creating <br/>
&gt;&gt;more laundry whereas people used to wear the same clothes for work and 1 <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Sunday&quot; outfit.  We now cook many things for a meal while in the past a <br/>
&gt;&gt;meal usually consisted of a stew cooked in 1 pot.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have also used those time saving devices as an excuse/reason to do <br/>
more/have more. Our wardrobes are stuffed, we have bigger houses to clean <br/>
and maintain, lots more dishes and cooking utensils to wash, more places to <br/>
go-farther and farther away, etc. Rather than relaxing in the time saved, we <br/>
just filled it up with more stuff and things to do.<br/>

Have you heard Swami Beyondananda&#39;s bit on &quot;nothing&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
He says he&#39;s selling nothing, and it&#39;s wonderful.  <br/>
Nothing will get kids to eat vegetables.<br/>
Nothing succeeds like sucess!<br/>
<br/>
Oh cool!  I found one in writing.  (I know it from a recording, but this has <br/>
more, and fun stuff!)<br/>

<br/>
A Special Message From The Swami<br/>
<br/>
What if I told you you could do nothing all day and become fabulously wealthy <br/>
in the process? If you say &quot;No way!&quot; I say, &quot;Absolutely right.&quot; Because now, <br/>
thanks to my new network marketing company, NoWay, you can make a fortune <br/>
selling boxes of Nothing. I want you to think about all those people who told <br/>
you that nothing could make you rich and successful. Well, here is your chance<br/>
 to prove them right! Yes, if you feel you have been working for nothing all <br/>
these years, now it is time to have Nothing to work for you. <br/>
<br/>
I tell you, this is a business opportunity whose time has come, because no <br/>
matter what your problem is, Nothing will help. For example, Nothing has been <br/>
proven to cure every disease imaginable. That&#39;s right. Studies show that <br/>
placebos alone are effective in about 20% of cases — and what better placebo <br/>
than Nothing? And you can forget about pesky product liability lawsuits. We <br/>
promise Nothing — and we deliver. How many companies can make that claim? <br/>
<br/>
Imagine how refreshing it will be for your friends who have been inundated <br/>
with multilevel marketing opportunities. You can truthfully tell them you <br/>
have Nothing to sell — and then sell it to them! Yes, in a world filled with <br/>
products that are really nothing disguised as something, you can sell <br/>
something disguised as nothing. Think of all those pessimystics out there who <br/>
insist that nothing can help the starving multitudes, nothing can alleviate <br/>
poverty, nothing can revive our neighborless `hoods. I say, let&#39;s prove them <br/>
right and prove them wrong at the same time. Imagine armies of homeless folks <br/>
or unemployed young men selling boxes of Nothing door-to-door. &quot;They told me <br/>
nothing could get me off the streets,&quot; they might say, &quot;and I am hoping they <br/>
are right. Will you help?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Now why, you might ask, would anyone be interested in buying Nothing? Well, <br/>
for one thing, most of us already have everything. In fact, we have so much o<br/>
f everything that we can&#39;t appreciate nothing. After all, God made the <br/>
entire Universe from nothing. And the same holds true of our own creations. <br/>
Every painting begins with an empty canvas, every book with a blank page, <br/>
every symphony with silence to be filled. As Harry Cohen Baba used to say, <br/>
&quot;Listen, if you don&#39;t know nothing, you don&#39;t know nothing.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Of course, being a FUNdamentalist, I couldn&#39;t resist putting some funny jokes <br/>
about nothing on the box. This is a perfect product for those diagnosed with <br/>
humorrhoids and who insist, &quot;Nothing makes me laugh.&quot; So not only will you be <br/>
striking a blow for the invisible nothing in a world cluttered with visible <br/>
somethings, but you will be raising the laugh force on the planet — and <br/>
creating a mannafestival of the first order. Imagine millions and millions of <br/>
people all around the globe being fed and prospered by Nothing. Now that&#39;s <br/>
what I call manifesting manna!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, the rat race is too blame and, I think, because we have lost contact<br/>
with ourselves and each other. People rush from one meeting/activity to the<br/>
next. They do the same with their kids. The more<br/>
stuff you have, the more classes you do has come to be equated with how good<br/>
you are. Other humans have become superficial relationships.<br/>
<br/>
30 years ago my mum raised 3 kids alone. She washed laundry by hand and<br/>
dried it on the line. She walked to the shops (she couldn&#39;t afford a car<br/>
until I was 25) most days. Yet she had plenty of time too<br/>
see her friends. They dug vegetable gardens together. They made wine and<br/>
then sat around drinking it. I remember plenty of time to play in next doors<br/>
garden.<br/>
My cousin&#39;s two children never play outside. They don&#39;t have *time*. Both<br/>
parenst work so the kids go to a child-minder after school. When they are<br/>
picked up it is swimming class or soccer practice or<br/>
piano lesson. Then its homework, TV and bed. Weekends are spent getting the<br/>
groceries or &#39;shopping&#39;. They&#39;ve never played in a stream or made snowmen.<br/>
My cousin is contsantly moaning that he has no<br/>
*time*. I&#39;ve been to his house. Both of them have shiny new cars, a<br/>
wide-screen TV - the kids have TV and DVD players too (they are 7 and 4).<br/>
The kids get new clothes every week.They have every labour<br/>
saving device known to man. Most of this stuff they have loans for. So they<br/>
both have to work in order to pay for the stuff they bought that was meant<br/>
to give them more *time*.<br/>
When I sugested to my cousin that he could work less over-time if he wasn&#39;t<br/>
paying a car loan (and UK interest rates for car loans are often 17-23%) he<br/>
wanted to know how he&#39;d get too work? It&#39;s a mile<br/>
away......<br/>
<br/>
It seems like madness. They are not happy, even with all this stuff they<br/>
have. They rarely see family as they are so busy. They have to schedule<br/>
appointments to see friends, often weeks in advance.<br/>
My cousin once said he envied me staying at home, having friends drop in<br/>
unexpectedly for coffee, my long walks with the kids doing nothing in<br/>
particuarly. Yet he could not see that it was his desire<br/>
for more new shiny stuff that meant that he could do none of those things.<br/>
He&#39;s over-weight and stressed :-(<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; One mum leaves the house at 6:30am and returns at<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;6:30pm. I say next time buy a dog!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Why leave a dog for twelve hours?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This is really what neices and nephews are for--contact with the future<br/>
&gt;with a low time investment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
