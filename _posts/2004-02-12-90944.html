<div id="ygrps-yiv-181909062">Hi!  Im new to this group and have been reading your posts over the<br/>
last week.  My name is Rheta.  I have 2 dd Isabel and Viven, 5 yo and 2<br/>
½ yo respectively.  My wonderful dh of 10 years, Mark, and our 3 cats<br/>
(cant forget them!).  We decided to Homeschool from the time I was pg<br/>
with Isabel and after reading as much as I could, came across the term<br/>
unschooling and started to read up on it.  I cant say I know it all and<br/>
Ive been known to get uptight when a friends child begins to do<br/>
something I think my dd should know;  learning how to back off and<br/>
follow her interests has been an experience in itself.  A good one<br/>
though.  <br/>
 <br/>
I was posed a question today that I wasnt sure how to answer and<br/>
figured if anyone could help me with this, it would be all of you.  The<br/>
question (actually statement) was:  Years ago the kids in this country<br/>
were being raised by farmers and factory workers and all they knew was<br/>
working in the fields and their factory jobs.  The only thing that<br/>
educated them was the public school system.  If everyone went back to<br/>
homeschooling, how would we keep from becoming a nation of idiots?  If<br/>
there were no public schools, a lot of kids would be raised by drug<br/>
addicts and people who were uneducated themselves and would have no idea<br/>
how to be responsible for their own childrens education. <br/>
 <br/>
I mentioned that this country was founded and did become a great nation<br/>
due to the people who were here hundreds of years ago.  Does anyone know<br/>
if there were public schools that far back.  Ive read that the public<br/>
school system was not in place until just the past 100 years or so.  As<br/>
I said, I do not know it all.  I figure I can research all of this in my<br/>
spare time (LOL) or I can ask those of you who already know how to<br/>
counter this statement.  I feel I should be able to answer this but seem<br/>
to have drawn a blank.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217211012">I will answer this question carefully. Especially since I hardly ever post.<br/>
 First, I love unschooling and am so happy to be raising my children this <br/>
way. But as an unschooling mom I personally don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m the one educating <br/>
my children. I didn&#39;t teach my son (8) to add, subtract, multipy or how <br/>
percentages work. He figured it out on his own. I never sat down to teach him to <br/>
read. But he reads most words and sounds out the ones he douesn&#39;t know. I don&#39;t <br/>
teach him about snakes or lizards or the solar system or politicsor history. <br/>
He watches television , both educational and not supposed to be educational <br/>
programs, movies, goes to museums, and litens and participates in conversations <br/>
about various subjects. My daughter (14) has learned much in the same way. They <br/>
are responsible for their own education as far as I&#39;m concerned. I went to <br/>
public school and I still feel as though most of my learning was on my own. <br/>
Second, as much as I love unschooling and am excited to see other people home <br/>
with their kids too, it&#39;s not for every family and situation. My home was no <br/>
place to be during my childhood and I&#39;m so glad I had a place to go. Even if <br/>
it was school. <br/>

<br/>
It is always a question in my mind whether we even do a service tfor  <br/>
some people to even point them torward unschooling. Yesterday I talked <br/>
to a mom on the phone who is taking her 13 yo son out of school. He is <br/>
failing. I didn&#39;t talk about unschooling, just the legalities and how <br/>
to get him out. SHE said to me: &quot;I don&#39;t think he&#39;s a textbook kind of <br/>
kid and I wish we could just live our lives and let him learn naturally <br/>
as we go along.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, very quietly, &quot;You can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She talked some more about her ideas, not knowing that ANYBODY else had <br/>
ever had such ideas. She could have invented unschooling all by <br/>
herself. TOO COOL!!!!!<br/>

Does he/she reallt think the USA was founded by idiots?  Then tell him/her to go read some history. Sorry this is snarky but really, that&#39;s an ignorant question based on no knowledge and I&#39;m not sure it deserves a reply. :)<br/>

I guess for me, how i would answer would depend on the type of <br/>
conversation i wanted to have. If it was a friend or casual <br/>
acquientance (ack, sp?), i wouldnt take on the whole public school <br/>
system. I&#39;d simply say that this is what works for us, seems to be <br/>
meeting my child&#39;s needs, and we didnt have the greatest experience <br/>
in school. Sometimes people think that we are attacking their choice <br/>
to send their kid to school, by making this choice for ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
I usually ask people how much they actually remember from their own <br/>
schooling, and how much of it is really useful to their current life. <br/>
I am lucky enough to be surrounded by people who had less than <br/>
wonderful school careers, who can&#39;t imagine why anyone would defend <br/>
school, so this doesnt come up much. And for the people in my life <br/>
(like seamus&#39; paternal grandmother who is a history professor)who <br/>
don&#39;t want to understand, i don&#39;t waste alot of effort on convincing <br/>
them. <br/>

<br/>
There are many ways people can learn without the direct instruction of their <br/>
parents.  I think that is a lot of what unschooling is about.  The internet is <br/>
available to everybody at most public libraries...not just the wealthy or <br/>
well-educated.  So are videos, DVD&#39;s, books, and CD&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;drug addicts and people who are uneducated&quot;, their children are <br/>
the ones who I often see receiving the worst end of a public education--poor <br/>
schools, poor teachers who care about class management more than anything else, <br/>
no respect at school and little at home.  I tend to think that some of these <br/>
kids would be better off at home.  At least their parents and siblings would get <br/>
to know them.  At least they would be less likely to feel like failures.  If <br/>
their parents felt the freedom of being responsible for their own children, I <br/>
think it would be good for the whole family.<br/>

Honestly, tell this guy to go learn some American history beginning with Abraham Lincoln, who came from the humblest of farmer roots, taught himself everything he knew from math and reading to law and went on to become one of the greatest American presidents. He was not only responsible for holding the nation together and the 13th amendment, he represents the turning point from antebellum to modern America. He was not homeschooled; he was unschooled.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure about that! Neither situation is good, but at least at <br/>
school, the child may find *someone* who cares. He may go to visit a classmate who <br/>
has a &quot;normal&quot; homelife and see that there is &quot;something better out there&quot; than <br/>
what he sees at home or with relatives.<br/>
<br/>
Drug addicts think of getting their next fix, NOT what the child&#39;s passion <br/>
is. <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;uneducated&quot; think that school is the *best* chance the child has to get <br/>
out of the hell-hole THEY&#39;re in (and they must have landed there because they <br/>
didn&#39;t graduate or listen in school ). They believe what they were taught in <br/>
school.<br/>

next to no free time to use information that wasn&#39;t directly related to<br/>

(There&#39;s an interesting statistic that says something like a single issue of<br/>
the New York Times has more information in it than was available in printed<br/>
form in the 1700s.)<br/>
<br/>
The wealthy were well educated without public schools. Some went to private<br/>
schools, certainly, but tutors were common. But whatever the choice of<br/>
learning, the important part is that given the freedom not to educatate<br/>
their kids, parents *choose* to make sure their kids had access to learning.<br/>
<br/>
Many more people in the US have access to the leisure time to help their<br/>
kids learn. And you can&#39;t turn around without tripping over information. The<br/>
farmers and factory workers of ages past had none of that.<br/>

want to do it so the question is ridiculous. It&#39;s a choice for those who<br/>
*do* want to do it.<br/>

The point of homeschooling isn&#39;t to replace public schools. The point is to<br/>
provide another option to choose from.<br/>

<br/>
We weren&#39;t a nation of idiots before we had schools.<br/>
And now that we have schools, they produce a small amount of &quot;product&quot; with a <br/>
HUGE human slag heap of people who would have thought they were real and <br/>
whole if school hadn&#39;t told them different.<br/>
<br/>
But a child in a farmhouse or city apartment in 1830 who had maybe a Bible in <br/>
the house for input, maybe one trip to church a week, who learned from <br/>
stories and songs (MAYBE) is no comparison to a kid in 2004 who has the internet, <br/>
hundreds of books and magazines (and unlimited numbers more all around in <br/>
libraries, thrift stores, book stores, garage sales), radio, TV, recorded media out <br/>
the wazoo needing only a turntable, cassette player or CD player to access.   <br/>
No comparison whatsoever.   <br/>
<br/>
Oh!  We have Bibles, too.   Searchable bibles, whatever translation you want. <br/>
 With commentary.  It&#39;s like a seminary any time of the day or night, for <br/>
those who are interested.  And illustrated?  Not counting videos and movies of <br/>
Bible stories, and cartoons and musicals, we can access tons of paintings <br/>
online, book of Kells close-up detail, archeological bits, photographed in color.    <br/>
Those 1830 Bibles might have had two illustrations, a map of Palestine and <br/>
then the eastern Mediterranean, and some line drawings of shekkels and the ark <br/>
of the convenant (which we can see in Raiders of the Lost Ark &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Now what was the question?<br/>

This is exactly the type of situation I was referring to &lt;g&gt;.  I realize that <br/>
unschooling might not be the best choice for every family, but so many <br/>
families don&#39;t even realize that this is an option.  I&#39;m tired of parents telling me <br/>
that I&#39;m *lucky* that I have such great kids.  It&#39;s not luck!  The same <br/>
parents will then go and holler at their own kids because they&#39;re not doing good in <br/>
school.  The parents don&#39;t blame the school; they blame the kids.  Many <br/>
parents that I know really think that they got *bad* kids.  Their belief is that <br/>
school is there so that their kids can have a better life, and if their child <br/>
isn&#39;t doing well in school then he or she must have something wrong with him.  <br/>
