<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962136790"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;From: &quot;kayb85&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sheran@...">sheran@...</a>&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;My dad is a retired biology teacher and a creationist.  He hands down<br/>
all his Ex Nihilo magazines to me.  I always have my hands on good<br/>
creation literature to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about not getting good answers about Bible<br/>
questions.  Some people just seem to not want to really think things<br/>
through or ever consider anything that would allow anyone to label<br/>
them heretical.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Okay so is creationism believing in the bible? I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s even <br/>
the right word, is it? Religion isn&#39;t my forte. So those who believe the <br/>
bible as what is absolute, do they believe in dinosaurs and<br/>
prehistoric man? If so, how does that fit in with the bible. If not, do they <br/>
just not believe fossils?<br/>

I&#39;ve actually heard bible literalists suggest that perhaps a)God planted the fossils to test our faith or b)Satan planted the fossils to turn us away from our faith.<br/>
I&#39;ve also heard it said that perhaps dinosaurs existed at the time of Noah&#39;s flood and were wiped out in it, hence the fossils.<br/>

It amazes me how far people are willing to stretch their powers of belief to avoid altering their world view.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897942108">Creationism is the belief in creation as described in the Bible. <br/>
<br/>
God created dinosaurs on day 6 with the rest of the land animals and <br/>
human beings.  Creationists believe that dinosaurs existed peacefully <br/>
with man for some times.  (Death didn&#39;t exist before sin, so all <br/>
animals had to have been herbivores.  Therefore dinosaurs didn&#39;t eat <br/>
people.)  Dinosaurs probably entered the ark with Noah and some of <br/>
them became extinct some time after the flood due to changes in food <br/>
supply and atmosphere.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, many creationists believe that dinosaurs aren&#39;t actually <br/>
extinct.  Before the flood, we had a different kind of atmosphere.  <br/>
The water cycle as we know it didn&#39;t exist until the flood, so the <br/>
atmosphere was different-- kind of like a tropical rainforest.  The <br/>
atmospheric conditions were conducive to animals growing very big. So <br/>
reptiles grew really big before the flood.  Iguanadon, for example, <br/>
was probably just a really big iguana.  The word dinosaur actually <br/>
just means terrible lizard.  So, dinosaurs could have been just real <br/>
big lizards.  <br/>
<br/>
Fossils were created by the flood.  Lots and lots of things buried <br/>
under huge amounts of water very quickly.  That&#39;s why you have sea <br/>
animal fossils at the tops of mountains--the flood waters carried <br/>
them there.  <br/>

Wow. I had never heard that. I am just so curious about the bible, or should <br/>
I say people who take it so literally. I&#39;m not judging at all or trying to <br/>
cause trouble. I would really like to know how they explain certain things <br/>
because I think it will eventually come up with my own kids. I know my <br/>
oldest asks me certain things that I can&#39;t answer either. And she&#39;s also <br/>
always gone to private catholic schools. She gets pretty much the same <br/>
answers I did growing up. &quot;Just because that&#39;s the way it is!&quot;<br/>
Doesn&#39;t satisfy either one of us. I would really like to know from people <br/>
who believe and have the answers.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The word dinosaur actually <br/>
just means terrible lizard.  So, dinosaurs could have been just real <br/>
big lizards.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the word &quot;dinosaur&quot; was made from Greek parts, using Latin rules,  in the <br/>
19th century, and wasn&#39;t coined by Adam or God or Noah.  Using evolutionary <br/>
arguments for childrearing is way better than using linguistic evidence to <br/>
support the Bible.  <br/>
<br/>
Nineteenth century names for dug-up animals have LOTS to do with evolutionary <br/>
theories and nothing to do with the Bible.  They&#39;re still naming dinosaurs <br/>
(and plants, and new species of bugs) with this set of Greco-Latin parts.  <br/>
It&#39;s like tinker-toys of word parts.  It&#39;s the way philosophical concepts are <br/>
named too, like &quot;philosophy&quot; and &quot;anthropology.&quot;  Few of those words are any <br/>
older than the Middle Ages and most were new in the 20th century.<br/>

So isn&#39;t that kind of like looking for money under the streetlight even <br/>
though that&#39;s not where you lost it?<br/>
<br/>
Just because something&#39;s easy to understand doesn&#39;t make it more likely to be <br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
I think being good with our kids and friends and being helpful to other <br/>
people is important whether our species and planet are old, planted by God, <br/>
or scattered by aliens, or figments of someone&#39;s imagination.  Being good is <br/>
better than being bad.  Knowing our origins doesn&#39;t change that.  Beliefs <br/>
about origins doesn&#39;t change that.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard those too.<br/>
<br/>
I really like that Satan planted them.  Satan gets blamed for everything <br/>
inexplicable or bad.<br/>
Except by Monty Python.  Eric Idle wrote this parody of &quot;All Things Bright <br/>
and Beautiful.&quot;  Their tune isn&#39;t the same as the tune common in the U.S. <br/>
hymnals I&#39;ve seen, but it will still fit.  The Church of England tune is <br/>
really pretty too.<br/>
<br/>
All things dull and ugly,<br/>
All creatures short and squat,<br/>
All things rude and nasty,<br/>
The Lord God made the lot.<br/>
<br/>
Each little snake that poisons,<br/>
Each little wasp that stings,<br/>
He made their brutish venom.<br/>
He made their horrid wings.<br/>
<br/>
All things sick and cancerous,<br/>
All evil great and small,<br/>
All things foul and dangerous,<br/>
The Lord God made them all.<br/>
<br/>
Each nasty little hornet,<br/>
Each beastly little squid--<br/>
Who made the spikey urchin?<br/>
Who made the sharks? He did!<br/>
<br/>
All things scabbed and ulcerous,<br/>
All pox both great and small,<br/>
Putrid, foul and gangrenous,<br/>
The Lord God made them all.<br/>

Good point. This was also one of the answers my daugher got when questioning <br/>
the bible or anything to do with the catholic faith in school. That you just <br/>
have faith and believe. There always isn&#39;t an answer for everything. That <br/>
never set well with her either. She wanted some kind of answer to either <br/>
disagree with or not.<br/>

can&#39;t accept the views of *The devil put the fossils there to throw us off <br/>
the right path.* because I don&#39;t put much stock in the devil. And I can&#39;t <br/>
believe that man was once the size of or bigger than dinosaurs because we <br/>
would have found huge human bones too. (and I know there were dinosaurs out <br/>
there as big as ten elephants put together and I haven&#39;t ever seen a human <br/>
bigger than that.) I will never believe humans and dinosaurs lived together <br/>
because there would be bones and fossils to that proof. If there were, I <br/>
would have seen that guy, last night on Discovery, saying something like, <br/>
*And here we have ancient man, notice the tooth marks along his thigh bone? <br/>
He was ravaged by dinosaurousX here, see how the tooth fits nicely into these <br/>
grooves?* and so on... <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t get me wrong here, I do believe in something higher than me. I just <br/>
know that there were Dinosaurs too. And they didn&#39;t get on the boat with <br/>

I think the point is that people who accept physical evidence of dinosaurs <br/>
don&#39;t spend much time speculating on the age or size of animals that Noah is <br/>
said to have taken on the ark.<br/>
<br/>
Flooding the whole world when they thought it was a pretty small, flat place <br/>
is ONE proposal.  Flooding a planet is another whole thing.  <br/>

Bible literalists are a minority among humans, and even a minority among <br/>
Christians.  It&#39;s worth really knowing that there are millions of Christians <br/>
who are happy in their relationship with Jesus who don&#39;t take the whole Bible <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-477533491">Speaking of people who take the bible literally but haven&#39;t ever actually read it...<br/>
Has anyone seen this letter to Dr. Laura?  I assumed it was okay to cut and paste it without permission since it&#39;s all over the internet.<br/>
<br/>
Dear Dr. Laura,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for doing so much to educate people regarding God&#39;s law. I have learned a great deal from you, and I try to share that knowledge with as many people as I can. When someone tries to defend the homosexual lifestyle, for example, I simply remind him that Leviticus 18:22 clearly states it to be an abomination. End of debate.<br/>
Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it [is] abomination. ~Leviticus 18:22<br/>
<br/>
I do need some advice from you, however, regarding some of the specific laws and how to best follow them.<br/>
<br/>
When I burn a bull on the altar as a sacrifice, I know it creates a pleasing odor for the Lord (Lev. 1:9). The problem is my neighbors. They claim the odor is not pleasing to them. How should I deal with this?<br/>
But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, [to be] a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD. ~Leviticus 1:9<br/>
<br/>
I would like to sell my daughter into slavery, as it suggests in Exodus 21:7. In this day and age, what do you think would be a fair price for her?<br/>
And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do. ~Exodus 21:7<br/>
<br/>
I know that I am allowed no contact with a woman while she is in her period of uncleanliness (Lev. 15:19-24). The problem is, how do I tell? I have tried asking, but most women take offense.<br/>
Leviticus 15:19 The woman, who at the return of the month, etc., etc., etc., shall be separated seven days. Every one that toucheth her, shall be unclean until the evening. And every thing that she sleepeth on, or that she sitteth on in the days of her separation, shall be defiled etc., etc., etc. ~Leviticus 15:19 thru 23 <br/>
<br/>
Lev. 25:44 states that I may buy slaves from the nations that are around us. A friend of mine claims that this applies to Mexicans but not Canadians. Can you clarify?<br/>
Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, [shall be] of the heathen that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids. ~Leviticus 25:44<br/>
<br/>
I have a neighbor who insists on working on the Sabbath. Exodus 35:2 clearly states he should be put to death. Am I morally obligated to kill him myself?<br/>
Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall be to you an holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whosoever doeth work therein shall be put to death. ~Exodus<br/>
<br/>
In Lev 1:5 and 1:6 it says someone has to kill a bull, splatter it&#39;s blood all around the alter, then flay it till it&#39;s torn apart. Do I have to do that myself, or can I just pay a Goth to do it for me?<br/>
And he shall kill the bullock before Jehovah: and Aaron&#39;s sons, the priests, shall present the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting. And he shall flay the burnt-offering, and cut it into its pieces. ~Leviticus 1:5-6<br/>
<br/>
A couple of verses that have really concerned me, Dr. Laura, are Lev 7:22-25. They say a low fat diet is just not going to cut it, not even close. And to be perfectly honest, my favorite restaurants are Burger King and Popeye&#39;s Chicken. So here&#39;s my questions: if I have to be cut off from the people, can I still work from home? If not, can I work from a motel room as long as I stay away from my family?<br/>
And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no fat, of ox, or sheep, or goat. And the fat of that which dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn of beasts, may be used for any other service; but ye shall in no wise eat of it. For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto Jehovah, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. ~Leviticus 7:22-25 <br/>
<br/>
I know you have studied these things extensively, so I am confident you can help. Thank you again for reminding us that God&#39;s word is eternal and unchanging.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594079519">The problem with this post is that if one actually did read the bible, and read the Gemorah, which is the *other* part of the Jewish bible, then the questions wouldn&#39;t confound you...the answers are fairly simple and direct. <br/>
<br/>
For example.. selling one&#39;s daughter...in meant not into slavery, but as a wife.  She was given in marriage to another person with the right to not marry when she reached majority.  It was a way for a poor person to protect his daughter...He couldn&#39;t afford to take care of her, so he gave her as a bride to be to another family. They cared for her as they would a daughter.  When she reached majority, if she wanted to remain with him and marry she did.  The Torah also makes clear that this is something allowed but not at all desired. (<br/>
<br/>
A boy was apprenticed.  <br/>
<br/>
Sacrificing animals is forbidden in any place aside from the Temple.  ie, the Temple which stood and was destroyed twice.  There are differing opinons on whether or not we will have sacrifices come the final Temple.<br/>
<br/>
No you can&#39;t take slaves from your neighbors now.  The law of the land is the land.  Furthermore, the form of slavery practiced in America was in total violation of the laws of the Torah. <br/>
<br/>
Fat meant a particular fat.  Not all fat.<br/>
<br/>
Justice required two witnesses to a violation.  Furthermore the person had to have warning that they were about to commit whatever crime they were about to commit and the penalty for the crime was XYZ.  The two witnesses could not be related to the person or to each other, or to the vicitm. You couldn&#39;t kill just on your own two eyes.  We had a system of courts, and the death penalty was rare (a court which sentence one person in seven, and some say seventy years to death was considerd a hanging court.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is really interested, I will post or send to them good sites to really ask these questions...where you&#39;ll get answers from Rabbi&#39;s who have been studying this stuff most of their lives.....<br/>

would make it impossible, IMO. Most only live in certain habitats, so<br/>
they&#39;d either have to walk or fly to the ark, or the ark would have to<br/>
make a pretty long trip picking them up. Then there&#39;s the sheer number of<br/>
different species.There are hundreds of different species of small<br/>
grayish moths. There are hundreds of thousands of different species of<br/>
beetles. If they didn&#39;t evolve, they would have all had to be on the<br/>
ark... I&#39;m sure someone has figured out how large an ark would have to<br/>
big to hold every species, plus provisions for that species for a few<br/>
months (food for just the elephants would fill a pretty bug space), but<br/>
it&#39;s pretty easy to figure out that it&#39;s logistically impossible. <br/>
<br/>
