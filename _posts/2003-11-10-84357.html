<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144653391">The threads on limits and showering and chores, along with the recent <br/>
post about following one&#39;s instincts and not always coming to &quot;the <br/>
experts&quot;... have struck a chord with me. <br/>
<br/>
Recently, I put out a bowl with Halloween candy in it, though having <br/>
such an item in my house is counter-instinctive to me. My whole adult <br/>
life, I&#39;ve chosen whole foods and scratch cooking and healthy stuff. <br/>
Haven&#39;t outlawed candy or any other food, but I&#39;ve always kept a <br/>
fruit bowl and had things like cheese and crackers or ants on a log <br/>
for snacks. Putting out a bowl full of candy for whomever to have <br/>
whenever isn&#39;t something I would naturally, normally do. <br/>
<br/>
And the reason was, I wondered how kids who hadn&#39;t been limited (i.e. <br/>
candy has never been outlawed, I just don&#39;t usually buy it) don&#39;t <br/>
seem able to ignore a candy bowl at my friend&#39;s house and gobble <br/>
their Halloween candy in a day or two. The advice here was to make it <br/>
truly unlimited, all the time. They&#39;d eventually get tired of it, and <br/>
the candy would sit. I believe this would happen IF I actually <br/>
decided to keep a candy bowl around all the time. I may not.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s why. Well, there are lots of reasons. <br/>
<br/>
1) we live out in the country. With the fruit bowl, when the fruit is <br/>
gone, we don&#39;t get more until the next trip to the grocery <br/>
store...twice a month to the big city; once a week to the town, but <br/>
we go to the library, not the expensive grocery store there, unless <br/>
there&#39;s something on sale that I need to restock. If I only replenish <br/>
the fruit when I&#39;m grocery shopping, I won&#39;t be refilling the candy <br/>
bowl more often. <br/>
<br/>
2) we are on a tight budget right now. It was mentioned, once the <br/>
kids are satiated, they won&#39;t eat the candy all gone and it won&#39;t be <br/>
expensive. Well...my budget may not allow for the time to pass while <br/>
the kids become satiated. Life in this family right now is: we are <br/>
cutting back, especially in areas where personal choices make the <br/>
most difference (I HAVE to pay the credit cards; I DON&#39;T HAVE to buy <br/>
foods that lack nutrition)<br/>
<br/>
3) I kind of like a concept I read in The McDougall Plan (a vegan <br/>
lifestyle book)...where it is explained that in most cultures, people <br/>
eat very simply on a day to day basis, and have two or three big <br/>
community feasts per year. The author was saying that most cultures <br/>
eat no meat except on feast days. I don&#39;t know about THAT, but the <br/>
concept stuck with me. If you keep things simple on a daily basis, <br/>
when a &quot;feast day&quot; comes, all the goodies that go with it are all the <br/>
better for not having been around every day. Like going without rich <br/>
foods for the Lenten Season, and breaking that fast with an Easter <br/>
meal...how much better that food will be, because it&#39;s been put away <br/>
for a season.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t my plan to serve rice and veggies and only break out the <br/>
Yummy Stuff at Christmas and Easter, but what is so wrong with how we <br/>
were doing candy around here, before? That is, once a week, the kids <br/>
get allowance and no limits on what they spend it on. And they have <br/>
always spent it on either candy or Pokemon cards. (I&#39;m also not <br/>
saying that anyone here thought it was wrong...just thinking out <br/>
loud, because I&#39;ve changed some very fundamental things in the house <br/>
and need to think about it)<br/>
<br/>
4) thinking about it, their eating all their Halloween candy in a day <br/>
or two doesn&#39;t bother me. It goes along with that feast mentality: <br/>
they don&#39;t get it every day, so when they do, they consume it. It&#39;s a <br/>
treat to them. <br/>
<br/>
so, back to Instincts. The first thing that came to mind, reading the <br/>
post about following one&#39;s instincts without always coming to the <br/>
experts, was that child rearing method that puts babies on a feeding <br/>
schedule and adamantly opposes bringing them to bed with you, etc. So <br/>
counter-intuitive. A mother&#39;s instinct is to have the baby nearby all <br/>
the time, and to feed the baby when he needs feeding. Some bonehead <br/>
comes along and says &quot;No! You&#39;ll have spoiled kids if you feed on <br/>
demand and taking them to bed with you is bad for your marriage&quot; and  <br/>
people bought into that system so completely, some mothers were even <br/>
denying food to their babies who were genuinely hungry, <br/>
because &quot;there is no feeding scheduled for another half hour&quot;...erg.<br/>
<br/>
Even so, my instinct about having fruit and veggie sticks and <br/>
crackers around for snacking, and let candy come and go as it does <br/>
without providing an endless supply, is appropriate. In Heidi&#39;s <br/>
House, there isn&#39;t a candy bowl, any more than there is a level of <br/>
clutter that you have to make a path in order to get around. I prefer <br/>
to keep the clutter off the floor (though the tables and counters <br/>
often...er, always...have stuff on them) and so, I keep the floor <br/>
decluttered.<br/>
<br/>
I prefer not to have lots of sugary stuff around all the time, and so <br/>
I don&#39;t buy candy and put it out in a bowl.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, at Christmas time, I made my usual batches of homemade <br/>
Almond Roca and had some out in a dish. The kids tentatively <br/>
approached, and I said &quot;Have some. Have as much as you want&quot;...you <br/>
should have seen the looks on their faces. Disbelief faded into <br/>
happiness. Actually, I felt pretty bad that their first response was <br/>
disbelief. I&#39;d been so controlling, that I&#39;d actually put out my <br/>
famous homemade toffee in a dish when there was no company coming <br/>
over, and say &quot;Don&#39;t touch&quot; to my kids! I&#39;ll not be going back to <br/>
that way of doing things, ever. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, why go against my instincts about candy? I&#39;ve never provided an <br/>
endless supply; I&#39;m a Granola at heart, and think less candy is <br/>
better, though I don&#39;t say no when they buy candy w/their allowance <br/>
money...<br/>
<br/>
Well...that&#39;s where my thoughts have been the last couple of days. <br/>
Pretty much just thinking out loud and learning to incorporate these <br/>
ideas in our life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1061197144">Hmm....my initial responses: <br/>
<br/>
Is your instinct not to put out candy the same instinct that led you to put out homemade toffee and tell you kids they could not eat it?  While you describe that as &quot;controlling&quot; and something that you would never go back to -- is the limit on candy in general different? I&#39;m genuinely asking. <br/>
<br/>
As one who took years to unlearn the effects of being limited as to candy (and I think my parents would have described the limits more as being caused by budget than by philosophy -- they were not controlling people in general), I would SOO have preferred to have had a limitless candy bowl (even with dollar store candy) rather than having had it ingrained into my psyche the idea that candy is scarce and wonderful and must be all eaten whenever presented.  I am just now managing to have a bite of something sweet and leave the rest -  a skill that my daughter, thankfully, has by instinct and has never lost.  It took me a long time to realize that it had nothing to do with &quot;will power&quot; -- it had to do with &quot;feast or famine&quot; type instincts.  <br/>
<br/>
Obviously, you should find and do what works for you -- but since you put it out there, these are my thoughts. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-987440215">I have noticed with myself that if I buy three or four of those very large bars of chocolate, and one of two smaller bars, I might eat one or both of the smaller bars right away but the other bars will sit for quite awhile before I think to have any, and I&#39;m more likely to only eat a small portion. My children have proven to be the same way. If they think it&#39;s only going to be just that amount available they will go nuts and eat it all at once. If there is plenty that is available, they tend to search our their favorite snacks of apples, cheese or popcorn.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too.<br/>
The thing I keep thinking about is that the kids WILL have the <br/>
equivalent of a bottomless candy bowl when they&#39;re old enough to be out <br/>
from under parental control and have their own money. Its called &quot;the <br/>
world.&quot; I can stop in and buy all the candy I want any time I want it <br/>
now. That&#39;s a reality that those people Heidi talked about who only <br/>
&quot;feast&quot; once in a while didn&#39;t have to deal with - they didn&#39;t have the <br/>
opportunity to have candy every time they turned around. Heidi you can <br/>
make the world seem like that in her own house, for a few years, but it <br/>
won&#39;t last long. I&#39;d suggest taking a slightly more realistic view of <br/>
the real world we live in now.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we don&#39;t have a candy bowl sitting out all the time <br/>
- I don&#39;t think anybody thought that was some kind of requirement - <br/>
just one way of loosening up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so happy that none of my kids has my urge to want to be eating <br/>
sweets all the time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess it might be that for me too - I find myself reminding myself <br/>
that I don&#39;t have to eat something now just because it is available, <br/>
that if I really want it later, I&#39;m a grownup and I can just go BUY it <br/>
for myself. In fact, that IS often my frame of mind - like I&#39;m <br/>
indulging myself because I can. Feels a little like rebellion. Hmmm.<br/>

don&#39;t limit how much they can eat at one time. They limit themselves, <br/>
gradually working their way through over a period of weeks. And last August <br/>
I found Ian&#39;s Halloween bag from the previous year, left forgotten in a <br/>
corner, that still had about 1/4 of the candy left in it.<br/>

Hey, maybe there&#39;s something to this trust-your-kids business after all!  ;-)<br/>

they buy candy, they eat the candy...no comment from me. Go for it. <br/>
Same with the Halloween candy this year. It was gone in a day, pretty <br/>
much. Not a problem. I don&#39;t buy candy and have it around, but as a <br/>
rule, I also don&#39;t buy processed foods, not even frozen fries, not <br/>
even thrift store bread. BUT, it isn&#39;t set in stone by any stretch. <br/>
If I find frozen fries that are cheaper than buying whole potatoes <br/>
and fricasseeing them my own self, and fries sounds good, I&#39;ll buy em.<br/>
Usually, if a kid is along to the grocery store and they ask for <br/>
something, I get it. But one thing I am trying to do as their mom is <br/>
show them that you don&#39;t have to do frozen fries; you CAN cut up a <br/>
potato and make them your own self. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a teenager, when I had more money at my disposal, I started eating <br/>
whatever and wheneverstarted putting on weight, too, and it&#39;s been a <br/>
issue my whole adult life, my weight. Anyway, just to let you know, I <br/>
do understand this feeling of &quot;must all be eaten whenever presented.&quot; <br/>
Mine has more to do with a controlling mom, though. Budgetary <br/>
controls or not, she had something to say about every single thing I <br/>
ever tried to do, and not much of it to the tune of Well Done. Eating <br/>
what I wanted was my way of controlling my own self. But I also used <br/>
to love any and all candy, anything so long as it was sweet. My <br/>
tastes have refined a bit by now, so that I prefer certain things <br/>
over others. Will my kids start doing that at an earlier age, if it&#39;s <br/>
all presented equally, all the time? Probably. I&#39;m seeing it with <br/>
computer games and my 10year old boy. He knows what he likes in that <br/>
arena, and shuns what he doesn&#39;t like. Will my kids eventually figure <br/>
out that some candy is worth it and some isn&#39;t, even if I don&#39;t have <br/>
a full candy bowl in the house? Probably. <br/>
<br/>
It is a fact of life in our family right now, though: tight budget. <br/>
Living in the boonies. Natural/whole foods/Granola for a mom. If the <br/>
kids wanted to supply a bottomless candy bowl...go for it. It&#39;s their <br/>
house, too. <br/>

is still here, but getting low and I dunno if I&#39;ll replenish or not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Pam<br/>
<br/>
I did think of this:if we lived on the Solomon Islands, we&#39;d feast a <br/>
few times a year, due as much to paucity as anything else. But, on <br/>
the Islands, when a kid exits the hut, he has all the food on the <br/>
Island available to him. When my kids &quot;exit the hut,&quot; today, THIS <br/>
day, right now, whatever comes their way, they can have it. If <br/>
someone offers them candy...sure; if they have money to buy <br/>
candy...go for it. I don&#39;t say &quot;Sorry. No.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The kids&#39; candy is limited only insofar as I am able to afford it or <br/>
feel good about keeping the bowl filled. They are limited by the same <br/>
factors that limit the whole family: we buy what is in budget, pretty <br/>
much. I don&#39;t try to limit them outside my own purview. If I buy <br/>
Special Dark chocolate, I share it. My hubby shares his Snicker bars <br/>
when he gets them (on special, three for a dollar). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, we don&#39;t have a candy bowl sitting out all the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>time <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; - I don&#39;t think anybody thought that was some kind of requirement - <br/>
&gt; just one way of loosening up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! that&#39;s what has had to sink in for me, too. Going by my own <br/>
instincts, not running to &quot;the experts&quot; (as fine a bunch of experts <br/>
as you all are ;)...for every little thing. A candy bowl sitting out <br/>
sounds like a three or four times per year thing for this family. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-354560824">Hi Pam!<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend whose way with her kids, and her kids, seem to belie <br/>
what I read here. IOW, she is much more in charge of everything they <br/>
do, pushing them and giving them assignments and making them do <br/>
things. Her kids don&#39;t turn into monsters when she isn&#39;t around, <br/>
either. They are impressive people with kind hearts who love her very <br/>
much. She governs them tightly and lets them grow into self-<br/>
government in a quite &quot;traditional&quot; way, and it seems to work <br/>
extremely well. They are kids whom other kids as well as adults like <br/>
to be with, sort of like the kids I hear described on this board, yet <br/>
they haven&#39;t been unschooled by anyone&#39;s definition.<br/>
<br/>
So, she hasn&#39;t had a limitless candy policy at her house. They have <br/>
some, and she doesn&#39;t say no when they get a piece, yet, the candy in <br/>
the little dish on her kitchen counter sits all day, every day. The <br/>
kids pretty much leave it alone. TV and computer are similar; they <br/>
have both, but my kids are drawn to it like a magnet...her kids can <br/>
take it or leave it...they&#39;ve never gone through a phase of computer <br/>
games as their main free time activity, nor have they gone through a <br/>
consume all the candy in sight phase...<br/>
<br/>
According to what I was reading at the time I decided to try the <br/>
candy bowl experiment, it is limits that make kids crave (the candy <br/>
and eat it all gone) (Insert any &quot;forbidden&quot; item for candy), but my <br/>
friend&#39;s home, a &quot;tight ship&quot; for SURE, would not bear that out. <br/>
There I see a house where there are limits, yet the kids don&#39;t go <br/>
nuts on the candy.<br/>
<br/>
and so I wonder what REALLY causes kids to not crave it. Is it the <br/>
fact that she pours herself into them, 100%+? Keeps them very busy <br/>
all the time, so they have many interests everywhere in the city and <br/>
they get satiated with experiences?...because in her case, it isn&#39;t <br/>
unlimited supply. <br/>
<br/>
anyway. Something tells me successful homeschooling, whether school-<br/>
at-home or relaxed or radical unschooling, has more to do with <br/>
parental involvement and enjoyment of their kids, than any other <br/>
thing. My friend is able to use more traditional, parent controlled <br/>
styles of homeschooling and still enjoy her kids. <br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

What makes the mom feel good has been used for lots of child-limiting things <br/>
over the years, though.  Just in keeping with the idea of experimenting with a <br/>
different mode of parenting, if the moms say &quot;I can only do what I feel good <br/>
about,&quot; then lots of moms can only feel good using a curriculum and making <br/>
their kids sit like the moms want them to sit and eat exactly the way the moms <br/>
tell them to eat (my mom had lots of ways to sit and eat, and they were <br/>
non-negotiable).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725701016">The difference being, letting their brains soak up what they need, <br/>
and learn from life, has an instinctual &quot;right&quot; feel to it. Having <br/>
