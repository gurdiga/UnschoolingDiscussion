&gt; Vatican actually added some new words to Latin and published an 18,000 word<br/>

&gt; words total?) I&#39;m assuming these words were decided by committee rather than<br/>
&gt; actual use so new words don&#39;t make Latin any less dead.<br/>

*speaks* latin.  Priests have to have some common language, being from all<br/>
over the world.  So it would make sense that new words are needed<br/>
periodically, due to changes in the world.<br/>

wonderfully different from me.  how&#39;s that?!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1035981137">There are actually two types of Latin.  Church Latin is different in <br/>
some ways from Classical Latin.  When I was in high school, the priest <br/>
who had been teaching us Classical Latin, left the priesthood mid-year <br/>
to get married (testimony to letting priests marry - he was one of the <br/>
best priests I knew).  The nun who took over the class switched us to <br/>
church latin without even really explaining the differences fully.  <br/>
What a pain that was!<br/>

compliment in my house!<br/>

<br/>
More than two, for Latin scholars.  But Church Latin, while specialized, <br/>
stayed in use (mostly in writing) through the Middle Ages, while &quot;classical <br/>
Latin&quot; (the REAL dead language) was the language in which the plays and <br/>
histories and philosophies and such of the Romans was written.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the Roman Catholic church, liturgical business (the Mass, music, <br/>
prayers) were put into Latin even though it was only being used during <br/>
church, or among priests at formal meetings.  <br/>
