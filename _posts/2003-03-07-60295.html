&lt;&lt; Does food coloring come out of clothing? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Depends.<br/>
Instead of coloring the cornstarch goop, you can simply make it with <br/>
cornstarch and water. And in smallish batches that they can play with at the <br/>
kitchen table. We do that a lot.<br/>
It never gets to a point where you can really stir it easily, it&#39;s rather <br/>
stiff. But it&#39;s sure fun to play with.<br/>
We took large buckets to our resource day a couple weeks ago and made two BIG <br/>
batches of it.<br/>
Cool thing is no matter how messy they get, cornstarch rinses of easily.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve got a great book recommendation if you like making goop type recipes.<br/>
&quot;Lotions, Potions and Slime: Mudpies and More!&quot;<br/>
by Nancy Blakely<br/>
Another good one for basic dough recipes and many sculpting material ideas is <br/>
&quot;Magic Mixtures&quot;...that one is used frequently as there is some dough recipe <br/>
for EVERY project. Even edible dough.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
