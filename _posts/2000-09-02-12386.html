&gt; Corallyn-I don&#39;t know what the average is, but I didn&#39;t start losing teeth<br/>
&gt; until I was 7 and it&#39;s been the same with my kids and many of my nieces<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; nephews also.<br/>

My dd was 7 1/2. Rule of thumb usually goes that the later you got teeth as<br/>
a baby the later they fall out. My dd was almost 11 mos. when she cut her<br/>
1st tooth, hence the late age losing them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723949803">Well, this is what happened. Last night DS and DH were at bil&#39;s <br/>
house, DH&#39;s brother. DS was eating an apple when he noticed his tooth <br/>
was loose and told DH. In the past DS has forgotten to brush his <br/>
teeth, as any normal 5yo does, and we always ask him if he has done <br/>
this. DH has also told DS that if you don&#39;t brush your teeth you will <br/>
loose them. I have gone back and clarified this statement to DS but <br/>
it has been a while and at the time I never dreamed that it would <br/>
cause him this much worry or I would have persued it more deeply with <br/>
him. Anyway, I guess DH thought that his tooth was loose because DS <br/>
forgets to brush occasionally and that this weakened the tooth to the <br/>
point that the apple was too hard for the tooth to handle and <br/>
loosened it. This is what he told DS. This a.m. DS and I had a good <br/>
conversation about loosing his baby teeth and I explained the process <br/>
to him. When I told him about the Tooth Fairy his response was, &quot;A <br/>
whole quarter?!?!?!&quot; I think he feels better about it now. This <br/>
afternoon DH was still convinced that it was the lack of brushing <br/>
that caused the tooth to become loose. BTW DS had all of his teeth by <br/>
1yo. He started drooling profusely at 2.5-3mo and cut his first tooth <br/>
at 4-5mo and cut them till he had the same number as he did months <br/>
then cut 1-2 a month till he was 12mo. This sounds like it was a very <br/>
difficult time, as is usually the case, however, the only symptom he <br/>
had was the drooling and a cold/runny nose the weekend prior to the <br/>
teeth cutting in. Corallyn<br/>

Same here and my kids as well. An odd thing about my kids was that the new<br/>
front teeth. top and bottom, came in before the old ones fell out or even<br/>
felt loose. Those double rows made me think of JAWS!! LOL! When the old<br/>
teeth finally departed, the new ones just moved forward. Weird!!</div>

That&#39;s what I had always heard, too, and my son was late in cutting teeth,<br/>
but my daughter started cutting teeth at 5.5 months and I was 4 mos. when I<br/>
got my first tooth. Go figure!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343622265">my eldest got 3 teeth at 3 months and had all of his baby teeth by 15<br/>
months.  His 6 yr molars were fully in by 5 and he&#39;s 7 and working on his<br/>
12 yr molars.  He lost his first teeth at 4 and is now in the process of<br/>
losing his 11th and 12th teeth.  I had a similar pattern and got my<br/>
wisdom teeth in at 12 yrs.  my middle son got his teeth much later and<br/>
shows no signs of being close to losing any and he&#39;s five.  Most of my<br/>
son&#39;s 7 yr old friends have holes in their mouths.  Mostly the middle<br/>
front teeth. <br/>
