<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570772206">Sandra do you have a tape available on Peaceful Parenting?  I thought <br/>
that I read it somewhere here that you did. If this is available, how <br/>
can I get one?  Also, are the websites that come up when I used <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92027348">Well, I&#39;m not Sandra, but someone else asked me about that tape, and here&#39;s <br/>
how you can get it:<br/>
<br/>
This is a tape of a talk Sandra Dodd and Richard Prystowski gave at a <br/>
homeschooling conference in California last year.  I picked the tape up at <br/>
the Live and Learn Unschoolers Conference last October in South Carolina, <br/>
and I can&#39;t get over what a wonderful tape it is.  Here&#39;s the link to order <br/>
the tape. It&#39;s $6 plus S&H.<br/>

Sources of what?  That was an interesting queston and I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
respond!<br/>
<br/>
I have Peaceful Parenting tapes here but you can also buy them from HSC&#39;s <br/>
website.   I&#39;m asking $7 with shipping and $6 in person (South Carolina, or <br/>
wherever I might be).   <br/>
<br/>
My address is <br/>
Sandra Dodd<br/>
2905 Tahiti Ct. NE<br/>
Albuquerque NM  87112<br/>
<br/>
I have a paypal account under just<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>
<br/>
or you could send a check, either way.   <br/>
<br/>
If the google search turned up that tape for sale through HSC, it should <br/>
still be good, as they come from the guy who makes the copies.<br/>
<br/>
The tape is not just me, it&#39;s a &#39;duet&#39; between me and Richard Prystowski, a <br/>
homeschooling dad in California.  We&#39;re very different and we&#39;ve done four <br/>
presentations together over the years, and I really like them.<br/>

I&#39;ve been selling them $6 in person but hadn&#39;t been selling by mail, so I <br/>

Sorry.  I think it breaks some rles for me to have told people that.  <br/>
I thought it was a private e-mail and went too fast.  <br/>

 I didn&#39;t state my question very clearly, but it&#39;s ok because I <br/>
figured it out.  I was just wondering if the websites that I got when <br/>
I goggled &quot;peaceful parenting&quot; were good information.  Sorry for the <br/>
confusion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be sending for your tape.  Thank you.<br/>
