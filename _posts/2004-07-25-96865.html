&quot;5. To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of Coca-Cola <br/>
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion.  <br/>
We actually have a rusty old dead car battery in the garage. Tried it. <br/>
Thought it’d be cool. It didn’t work. But then I tried it with some Reynold’s wrap <br/>
(no Coke) and it came off beautifully. Maybe we should be worried about the <br/>
Reynold’s wrap here. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
another quote from that one:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tried the laundry one. It didn’t work. Except the road haze one kinda did. <br/>
But it left my windshield all sticky. Next time I used Windex, and that REALLY <br/>
worked (who knew?). A lot better than sticky brown pop. Who are all these <br/>
people trying this stuff on their windows and batteries and stuff? Or are they <br/>
just claiming they’ve tried it in the hopes that some doofus like me will copy <br/>
them?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve rejected two pending posts that recommended pouring coke on a corroded  <br/>
car battery.  If you&#39;re out in the mountains and your battery is so corroded <br/>
your car won&#39;t start, pour any liquid you have on it.  But if you have plain <br/>
water, that&#39;s best.   Or rub the corrosion off with pine needles, but if any <br/>
gets on your hands RINSE THEM A LOT.   The white battery acid leakage buildup is <br/>
acidic.  It needs BASE to clean it off, not more acid.  The coke is less <br/>
acidic than the corrosion, which is why it will work better than nothing.  But it&#39;s <br/>
far from being a useful/necessary/efficient treatment.   Water and baking s<br/>
oda have been used cheaply, commonly, by lots of garage mechanics who are where <br/>
they have lots of options (at home, at work, not stuck out in the country).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s from the Jaguar site:<br/>
<br/>
-=-1.  Make sure the terminals are clean. Batteries typically produce a white <br/>
fluffy  corrosion, and this corrosion acts as an insulator, preventing full <br/>
battery power from  reaching the starter. This makes the car act like the <br/>
battery is weak. Unbolt the  terminals and clean them with a mixture of water and <br/>
baking soda. WEAR EYE PROTECTION AND  RUBBER GLOVES.  Wash down the battery <br/>
case with more water and baking soda. You can buy a  corrosion inhibitor at your <br/>
local parts store. spray it on when you reattach the battery  cables.   -=-<br/>
<br/>
Champion Auto&#39;s site:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Clean battery terminals are necessary to deliver your battery&#39;s full p<br/>
and keep it fully charged. Battery terminals may be cleaned by use<br/>
battery terminal cleaner, or washing with a solution of baking soda<br/>
water and brushed clean.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why pour something sticky in or on ANY part of an engine?<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone here still thinks pouring something sugary and thick on a <br/>
battery is a great idea, please discuss it somewhere else, as it doesn&#39;t help <br/>
anyone unschool. <br/>

The above recommends toothpaste as one step of  treating CD scratches, the <br/>
whole procedue involving toothpaste, Brasso and Vaseline.<br/>
<br/>

It claims toothpaste was useless and says Brasso is best with total repair <br/>

<br/>
This was a real &#39;aha&#39; moment for me . . . realizing that so many times I<br/>
have relied on my children to do things for me that they were far better<br/>
at. Eventually I have come to do some of them on my own, but only because<br/>
they were patient with me and never belittled me for being timid or<br/>
incompetent. <br/>
Thanks for this moment of reflection, Sandra. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We thought in 1992 or whenever it was that he would be gone <br/>
 </span></blockquote>when he was 18.  What did we know?  <br/>
<br/>
And on the pensive times you are going through regarding Kirby&#39;s allowance<br/>
and the ages-old announcement that it was to stop at 18 . . . sooooooooo<br/>
much I thought and even verbalized about what was to happen with my<br/>
children as young adults has come around to just not happen. . . . like<br/>
college, no sex until whenever, like moving out, like never telling me to<br/>
buzz off or whatever . . . it has all been a fluid learning process, with<br/>
situations being handled as they arise, with deep reflection on all the<br/>
circumstances and deep work on my part to hold the situation its highest<br/>
light and to treat them with the respect they deserve. Now that I type<br/>
that, it was also true when they were babies and toddlers . . . things that<br/>
I was SO sure I would not do or my children would not do (remember I was 34<br/>
when Sky was born and had seen many parents and children around me) or that<br/>
I would do or my children would do . . . it all came around to be put in<br/>
front of me - and I had to made consistently conscious choices in that<br/>
moment.. . . based on nothing that I had seen or experienced, just<br/>
following my heart and my instincts. Sometimes it was easy, sometimes it<br/>
involved me eating my words or my thoughts. But, whenever I truly make<br/>
decisions in that kind of light - it always feels the best - for me and for<br/>
my relationships with my children (now my young adults).<br/>
<br/>
Love, Lee<br/>

Thanks, Juli!  My son said when he worked at Hot Topic they put  toothpaste <br/>
on the scratched CDs that they played in the store.  He says a  lot of things <br/>
that I don&#39;t necessarily believe, though!  I guess I&#39;ll take  my scratched CDs <br/>
down to Replays and have them polished for 4 bucks a  piece!  :P<br/>

I have to keep my payments up on those kids.<br/>

Yesterday was Kirby&#39;s last allowance day.  I wanted to ceremoniously give him <br/>
his $12.75, but he had company until Keith and I went to bed, and I didnt&#39; <br/>
want to embarrass him.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a big chunk of his budget that&#39;s not there now.  Weird.  We said when <br/>
he was five we&#39;d give him allowance until he was 18.  Now I don&#39;t know how to <br/>
act about it.   We thought in 1992 or whenever it was that he would be gone <br/>
when he was 18.  What did we know?   He has a job, it&#39;s just the the accumulated <br/>
allowance paid for big suddenish things, like needing a tux for the prom he <br/>
went to a year ago, and having money to take to Nan Desu Kan anime-thing.  I <br/>
don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be at all traumatized.  I am. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What we have has a crank handle and it&#39;s lovely to look at.  Artsy.<br/>
<br/>
You put the CD holder in, with the CD (or whatever) in it, and spray it with <br/>
the resurfacing stuff.  Then you crank it all the way around (takes a while) <br/>
and then all the way back.  Then you dry it with an anti-static thing in there, <br/>
and then you polish it.   <br/>
<br/>
Almost always works great, unless the (rented) thing has a really serious <br/>
scratch.  But for home-owned stuff it&#39;s never failed to fix the problem.  We&#39;ve <br/>
replaced the spray once.  Kirby paid for that replacement and didn&#39;t even <br/>
announce it.  It was empty, then it was replaced.  He&#39;s growing up. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; So, Kirby&#39;s 18 now?  Happy Birthday to him! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thursday.  <br/>
Next Sunday will be past the moment.  It&#39;s very strange for being new to me.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
By the time Holly turns 18 I&#39;ll be experienced, but at the moment it stuns <br/>
me.   Registering for the draft?  Looked that up for him yesterday.  Registering <br/>
to vote, maybe.   Marty told me the other day they had teased him about going <br/>
to Castle Superstore (for those unfamiliar, it&#39;s a big porn shop) after he&#39;s <br/>
18, but that Kirby had said porn&#39;s way too expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe THAT&#39;s why the tradition is allowance stops after 18.  (Just joking... <br/>
my parents gave me money all the time I was in college.  Not much.  But I <br/>
think porn-shop age was 21 then, and I was out of college by the time I turned 21.)<br/>
<br/>
There are no new barriers for him to cross, really, so it seems kind of sad <br/>
to penalize him for having a birthday, by NOT giving him the annual allowance <br/>
increase, but cutting it off altogether.   Doesn&#39;t feel right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255058342">There are still thresholds for him to cross -- you too as his Mom.  Someday he&#39;ll move out (Will did just 10 wks after his 18th), and having him gone will be a really new thing!  I found it felt surreal not having Will around the house -- he was gone several months before we cleared out his room to move Dan in there.  The closet is still full of his stuff -- I went thru it just last week to find some clothes for Andy.<br/>
 <br/>
Even weirder is talking to him when he calls -- he&#39;s busy, what with work, friends, days on a shared boat on the lake.  I find that I spend days literally feeling his childhood -- I can smell it, even see him as a little guy.  It all went by way too fast for me, tho as he&#39;s pointed out it went by slowly for him!<br/>
 <br/>
Ah well, gotta go -- the ones still at home are calling out that they&#39;re hungry.  Dan said the reason he&#39;s hungry is &#39;because I didn&#39;t get a bowling shirt&#39; (Andy just dug out one from last summer).  Poor guy!<br/>
