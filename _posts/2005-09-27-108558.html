<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110147427">So...   <br/>
Yesterday the kids and I went to Old Town (oldest part of Albuquerque, the <br/>
old plaza from before the train and all...)   and I was gathering things to put <br/>
in a little treasure box for people to bid on at the raffle at the Live and <br/>
Learn Conference, things that were fun representations of Albuquerque or the <br/>
southwest, and I looked at and rejected little lollipops/suckers with scorpions <br/>
in them.   Gross.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, less than 24 hours after I thought &quot;too disgusting,&quot; a got a <br/>
catalog, Educational Innovations, Teachers Serving Teachers, blah blah, <br/>
educational stuff.    <br/>
<br/>
Right on the cover with crystals and   magnets is a scorpion lollipop.<br/>
And inside they&#39;re describing them as thing to actually eat.   &quot;These <br/>
completely edible, farm raised scorpions come in four sugar-free flavors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they have other stuff--lollipops with crickets or larva.   And &quot;Amber <br/>
Insect-N-Side,&quot; toffee flavored brittle containing a cricket, larva and aspargus <br/>
fern, intended to teach kids about insects caught in amber.<br/>
<br/>
I had some thoughts.   This is not so &quot;educational&quot; in school terms, and <br/>
they&#39;re EXPENSIVE!!!<br/>
I didn&#39;t look at the prices yesterday, but this catalog wants $2.95 for the <br/>
scorpions ($1.60 for a cricket).    No way they were that high in Old Town.   <br/>
Gross, gross, gross.   Gross.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651405049">We bought a cricket one at the children&#39;s museum in cincy...seemed <br/>
cool at the time. Now we&#39;re kinda stuck with it, because its not like <br/>
anyone here is going to actually eat it. Its been sitting on top of <br/>
the microwave for about 6 months. <br/>
<br/>
A scorpion one wouldve been way cooler. We don&#39;t have scorpions here <br/>
in Michigan. Plenty of crickets though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521409607">That&#39;s disgusting, but my kids would love to see them. <br/>
 <br/>
Several years ago, my husband and I took the boys (it was just the oldest two at that time) to the Rattlesnake Museum in Old Town and Logan chose a scorpion-in-glass paper weight for a souvenir.  He brought it home in the little paper bag and didn&#39;t let his little brother, Colton, who was four, see it.  Well, that night Colton woke up, saw the paper weight on their bedside table, and freaked out!  He started screaming at the top of his lungs that the scorpion was trying to break free from the glass to eat him and, &quot;it&#39;s going to start with my eyes!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t know where he got that idea. :-)<br/>

First rat&#39;s asses, now meal worms and bugs. <br/>

I&#39;ve GOT to try some of your coffees!<br/>

BTW there is a town in CA that has an annual festival of food made from all<br/>
kinds of bugs, and apparently these occur all over the country:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-47991202">My oldest 2 dds love to watch the Discovery and Cooking network channels <br/>
and once caught a couple of shows within one week of unusual diets and <br/>
ingredients.  Did you know there&#39;s actually a national club where people <br/>
(who can afford it) travel to a convention location and have a banquet <br/>
on things like deep-fried scorpions for $95 a stick?  I actually love <br/>
seeing these things.  It&#39;s right up there with the guy who makes a <br/>
living painting hat boxes and the woman who shellaqed a laundry basket <br/>
full of clothes and sold it as a chair for $1500.  It&#39;s like the Cat in <br/>
the Hat movies with the cupcakes...I tell the girls, &quot;See,  you really <br/>
can do ANYTHING you want with you life...anything?....ANYTHING!&quot;<br/>

Ass/Meal Worm Blend coffee to the raffle. Ok, ok, so<br/>
it&#39;s very light on the rat&#39;s ass, but it has two kinds<br/>
of special mealworms my importer tells me are *da<br/>
bomb*!  ;)<br/>
