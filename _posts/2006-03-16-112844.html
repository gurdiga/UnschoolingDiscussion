Louis Malle&#39;s `80&#39;s film, &quot;Au Revoir Les Enfants&quot; is semi-<br/>
autobiographical.  The protagonists are 12 year old boys at a <br/>
Catholic boarding school in France during the war, one of whom is <br/>
being hidden from the Nazis.  Here is a Washington Post review:<br/>

&quot;Secret Lives&quot; is a documentary about Jewish children who were hidden <br/>
by families during the war, sometimes openly, by pretending they were <br/>
members of their family.  The film was made by a woman who was hidden <br/>
(openly) herself, and includes interviews with the children (now <br/>
grown), their rescuers, and family members who survived to be <br/>
reunited when the war was over.  The website includes some <br/>
interesting historical overview of what was going on in various <br/>
countries:<br/>
