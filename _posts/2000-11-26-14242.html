<br/>
Thanks for the understanding post.<br/>
<br/>
The idea is to make Buy Nothing Day an occasion when we &quot;turn off the<br/>
economy for a day and talk about it.&quot;  That&#39;s the point really.<br/>
<br/>
With time I think the idea will catch on in a big way; especially as more<br/>
people become aware of the extent to which corporations are pulling the<br/>
strings.<br/>
