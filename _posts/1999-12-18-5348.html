<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005525352"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I just wanted to share that it is<br/>
&gt; my experience that any activity (or class - or book or program or idea)<br/>
&gt; *specifically designed for children*, often *stinks*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was my experience also...<br/>
<br/>
When Logan was 2 and not in any type of child care environment he showed<br/>
an interest in spending more time with other children so we signed up<br/>
for a class at the YMCA that was supposed to be open gym time, songs,<br/>
and a craft.  The first session wasn&#39;t too bad...the instructor was<br/>
pretty good about leaving a kid be if he or she didn&#39;t want to<br/>
participate in something and wanted to do something else.  I found the<br/>
crafts to be developmentally inappropriate....but all they usually<br/>
consisted of was something like &quot;paste this on here&quot; then it was done so<br/>
I wasn&#39;t too bothered by it.  Logan seemed to enjoy it so we signed up<br/>
for the next 6 week session.  There was a different instructor this time<br/>
and she had a way of making what I think she thought were funny comments<br/>
about the one or two children who chose to run around the gym or<br/>
whatever instead of participating in &quot;circle time&quot;.  This really<br/>
bothered me, but since she didn&#39;t actually interfere with Logan and he<br/>
didn&#39;t hear the comments we continued for the rest of the session.  We<br/>
didn&#39;t go back because I figured that he&#39;d eventually pick up on the<br/>
attitude.<br/>
<br/>
So on I went to find a different program and ended up trying out<br/>
Gymboree.  We went for a free trial class and I really loved what I<br/>
saw.  Parents stayed with the children and the children were free to<br/>
explore any and all of the equipment that was set up (boy I wish they<br/>
had this for grown ups!).  During the class the instructor would have<br/>
parachute time, songs with rhythm instruments, and other games going on<br/>
in the middle of the room.  The kids were truly free to choose their own<br/>
activity.  The instructor would come around singing with bubbles and<br/>
greet all the children at some point during each class, too.  We did one<br/>
10 week session there, but then our life changed a bit- my dh got a new<br/>
job and Logan ended up going to day care from 1:30 to 4 every day (I had<br/>
been working full time on second shift).  We really couldn&#39;t afford to<br/>
continue and barely had the time to either.  I&#39;m quite sad that we<br/>
stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we&#39;re home together again Logan seems to want more time with<br/>
other kids.  Unfortunately Gymboree programs in our area only go up to<br/>
age 4...Logan will be 5 in January.  I&#39;m going to look into our local<br/>
unschoolers group (there is one, yay!) to see if there are any<br/>
activities going on with the kids and possibly organize some if there<br/>
aren&#39;t.  I dread the idea of trying a YMCA program for him again because<br/>
I&#39;m sure as kids get older they just try to impose more structure.<br/>
There is a gymnastics program I might look into nearby...but for some<br/>
reason I have a feeling its not what I&#39;m looking for.  If only we could<br/>
just go to the playground during the day (which we do)- unfortunately we<br/>
don&#39;t seem to find any other kids there and Logan is craving some sort<br/>
of kid interaction.  He has a great time when he sees my kid brothers<br/>
and when we get together with my extended family, but its just not<br/>
enough for him.<br/>
<br/>
So its probably a case now where I have to create what we want...but I<br/>
will recommend Gymboree programs for parents of toddlers (and it<br/>
probably does depend on the instructor!) because we had a great<br/>
experience there.  But I agree with Diane...most &quot;children&#39;s activity<br/>
classes&quot; are terrible!<br/>

  structure</div>
  <div><br></div><tt>This is from the unschooling.com FAQ list<br><br>&quot;Can 
  unschooling be structured?<br>It depends on what you mean by structure. 
  Imposing<br>external structure onto the learner, by specifying<br>materials 
  and methods, is not unschooling. A person<br>creating structure to suit his or 
  her own purpose,<br>that is unschooling. Some people are by 
  nature<br>methodical, and we want our children to respect and<br>work with 
  their own internal rhythms. Our job as<br>parent is to help them create what 
  they need. For<br>example, it is entirely possible that one child 
  will<br>learn everything in a more relaxed, free flowing way,<br>except for 
  one sucject- perhaps history. With history<br>that child may want a time line 
  and a access to<br>materials in chronological order. If it works for 
  the<br>child and is created at the behest of the child, then<br>structured, 
  methodical learning is also unschooling.&quot;<br><br>Still trying to put my
