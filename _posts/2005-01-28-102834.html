<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039756176">Can anyone recommend any good children&#39;s books on chicken pox?  One <br/>
that doesn&#39;t end in, &quot;and now I&#39;m all better and can go back to <br/>

with chicken pox.<br/>

Thanks for any leads!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1015759137">There&#39;s an Arthur chicken pox book (and a dvd too).  I&#39;ve seen the tv <br/>
episode.  Although Arthur does go to school, in the chicken pox <br/>
episode he is worried about missing the circus with his family. <br/>
