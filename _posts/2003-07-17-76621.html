<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446344789">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Our son went to conservation camp this week. I am really disappointed and <br/>
have been wondering how he is doing all week. He won the lottery for a free week <br/>
(normally 350.00). When we dropped him off we where both not happy with the <br/>
camp area. We where under the impression that he would be staying in a cabin but <br/>
he is not. He is in a four person tent with a tarp on the top. My husband <br/>
decided before he left that our son didn&#39;t need any more than 2 sets of batteries <br/>
for his flashlight. After discussing it he feels bad being that he is in a <br/>
dark tent.<br/>
<br/>
This camp rakes in 70,000.00 a week just on Conservation camp. <br/>
Normally I would have said something and maybe not even sent him. He said it <br/>
would be ok and we said our good-byes and left. This is the first time he has <br/>
been away from home more than one night. I miss him and hope he is doing ok.<br/>
He is 11 and has successfully stayed over night twice at a friends. This is <br/>
new for all of us but I cant help but worry about him all week.<br/>
Maybe I am stressing and he is having fun but not knowing is driving me nuts.<br/>
<br/>
When they did swim &quot;tests&quot; some girl came out of the water and said &quot;Oh I <br/>
didn&#39;t know it was a test, if I knew that I would not have tries so hard,&quot; lol. <br/>
The instructor said &quot;Hence Conservation SCHOOL&quot; ugh... She said it all I smiled.<br/>
<br/>
Any way, the list was slow so I thought I would send my thoughts....<br/>

<br/>
Kass and Kree are 11 (12 next month) and they have never been away from home <br/>
like that either. Just last night they spent the night with another <br/>
homeschooling family we are close with, but lives about 1/2 an hour away. They went with <br/>
my girlfriend and her kids straight from our parkday to the local <br/>
amusement/waterpark because it was free homeschoolers day. They were so excited they <br/>
didn&#39;t even kiss me goodbye!!! I couldn&#39;t believe it. They never so much as walk <br/>
away without a kiss goodbye. They finally called me after they were done at the <br/>
park, but I have a feeling that was because while they were still sliding <br/>
humongous water rides, I called my friend to whine about not getting any <br/>
kisses!!! LOL She too was shocked. As soon as the girls called, they said, &quot;Oh mommy <br/>
we are so sorry, we remembered you after we got in the car and rode away, but <br/>
we forgot you again when we got to the park!&quot; If it wasn&#39;t so funny, it may <br/>
have hurt my feelings. But they had a blast. I got them back when we met up at <br/>
our Karate studio at 11:30 this morning. But it felt like they were gone a lot <br/>
longer than 18 hours. I&#39;d probably fall to pieces over a week. <br/>
<br/>
Your son is lucky you miss him so much, even if he never knows it. I know p<br/>
eople who can&#39;t wait to ship their kids off for 8 hours a day and would revel in <br/>
shipping them off for a solid week. I feel much sorrier for all of them than <br/>
myself missing one night of kisses.<br/>

camp with the question...&quot;Don&#39;t know what you&#39;ll do with those kids this <br/>
summer...&quot; It hit the trash before the solicitor got down the driveway.<br/>

different areas, they wouldn&#39;t even let me see him.  He was only around 8 and I was <br/>
12.  He was so scared and crying.  I saw him through a window in the dining <br/>
facility and the counselor dragged me away and wouldn&#39;t let me console him.  &quot;He <br/>
will get over it&quot;  &quot;It&#39;s better if you leave him alone&quot;  &quot;seeing you will <br/>
only make it worse&quot;  That was all they said.  Then I didn&#39;t know what to say or <br/>
do.  Now it makes me sick that he had to &quot;cry it out&quot; on his own with no one <br/>
that was familiar.  He did &quot;get over it&quot; but at what cost.<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t making you feel better.  I guess maybe I should have waited <br/>
until he was back to write that but it is such a good unschooy topic.  And at <br/>
such a slow posting time.<br/>
<br/>
Try to call the camp and ask how he is getting along.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255473240">I do miss him. He has always been at my side. He and I are always together. <br/>
My mom said the other day well &quot;Brian should be happy that he got rid of him <br/>
for a week.&quot; She who shipped us off to camp several times and we refused to <br/>
participate and got to go home the same or following day.<br/>
I was like no Mom we both miss him very much.  My Father In Law asked if the <br/>
house was quieter, I said no not all. We all miss him! The 3 yr. keeps asking <br/>
if we can go get him now.  I wanted to so badly but Dustin knows if he was not <br/>
having fun or something was wrong he would make sure he got to call me to <br/>
come get him. One time he was at a birthday party and some kids while playing in <br/>
the woods where throwing rocks at him trying to get him lost. He ended up <br/>
beginning to walk home until the mother picked him up on the side of the road and <br/>
brought him home. The boys followed him and chucked rocks at him as he walked. <br/>
The boys Mom was totally mad at him for leaving and we are no longer friendly <br/>
with the family. <br/>
<br/>
I have laid in bed most of this week wondering if he would do the same or if <br/>
he would call me. I know he would call as it took us two hours to get there he <br/>
knows how far from home he is. The paperwork said no phone calls. His Nana <br/>
lives about 20 minutes away from the camp he asked how close she was and I said <br/>
much too far to walk please don&#39;t try it. If there is a problem that I wanted <br/>
him to call me and I would come get him. When I dropped him off he something <br/>
like it&#39;s ok Mom I&#39;ll be fine. So I don&#39;t want to ruin it for him for my own <br/>
reasons if he is having fun. I pick him up tomorrow am at 11 so we shall see. <br/>
When I dropped him off about half of the kids had been repeat campers, maybe <br/>
forced or willing I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
I know its all me. I miss my baby but I have to say this trip may open up <br/>
other areas for him. He has been wanting to go tenting. He loves to do archery <br/>
and shoot his gun. <br/>
<br/>
I am really trying not to make this about my worries. Kinda bugs me they say <br/>
no calls. They can answer my questions cant they? I bet there is no answer if <br/>
I do call. I tried to call them the week bf he went and they didn&#39;t answer the <br/>
phone only email.<br/>
I know I sound like I am going back and forth I am.......sorry<br/>

Make some cookies, drive up there and see how he is.   If he&#39;s having a<br/>
great time you can say &quot;I just thought I&#39;d bring you a treat!&quot;,  and if<br/>
he wants to come home you can rescue him and feed him and you&#39;ll both<br/>
feel better. <br/>
<br/>
If he wants to stay you&#39;ll still worry, but not the drive you crazy kind<br/>
of worry.  And while you&#39;re there you can check to see if he has access<br/>
to a phone to call you if something comes up.   You&#39;ll feel better either<br/>
way, and he won&#39;t mind knowing you cared enough to drive all the way up<br/>
there again. (with cookies!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230553576">I went to a week long sleepover camp at age 10 and loved it.  The counselors were nice, we had lots of fun activiities and campfire time every night.  We did have KP duty, but it wasn&#39;t slave work, just each cabin taking a turn to clean up after meals.<br/>
<br/>
I went to 4 summer sleepover camps in all.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;So??? Since when do you play by the rules?  LOL  If your gut says to<br/>
call him then CALL HIM.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s having a ball then you can settle your fears for the duration of<br/>
his camp, but if it&#39;s horrible you can go rescue him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with this. You are obviously worried if he&#39;s having a good time. And<br/>
rightly so. I would be doing the same thing. Call him or find some way to<br/>
get in touch with someone up there. I&#39;m just wondering if they don&#39;t *allow*<br/>
you to call, can one of the children really call home if they want to? Just<br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense for people not to be able to get in contact with a group<br/>
away from home in the woods. What about emergencies? If there was no answer,<br/>
I would probably even drive there to make sure. What&#39;s the worse that could<br/>
happen? You get chastised by a counselor for worrying? Big deal right?!!! If<br/>
your son is having a blast, then you know. If not, he&#39;s coming home early.<br/>
Let us know how he&#39;s doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869764611">It&#39;s really kind of sad to hear about the stories of some of you going away<br/>
to camp and being so miserable. I remember hearing about kids going away to<br/>
camp when I was little and thinking how awful that would be. For me, it was<br/>
a fate worse than death. Especially knowing some kids didn&#39;t really want to<br/>
go. I never went anywhere for more than one night. When I was about 13 I<br/>
went on a weekend retreat at my school and that was long enough for me!! Now<br/>
I know where Tara gets it from. The apple didn&#39;t fall far from this tree!!!<br/>
<br/>
My poor step daughter was sent to camp every summer just to get her away so<br/>
her mom could play. I felt bad for her but that&#39;s the way things always went<br/>
and well, I had no *right* if you know what I mean to say anything. Her dad<br/>
thought it was good for her too, even though she didn&#39;t want to go. Later on<br/>
she went to *fat* camp too. Poor kid hated it. We went up one summer and<br/>
surprised her with a visit. She was so happy to see us. I never really asked<br/>
her in her adult life about those summers. I&#39;m curious as to how she feels<br/>
now. I&#39;m going to remember to ask her.<br/>

Thank you for all the suggestions. I agree all the way around. I will let you <br/>

at least they will change their no call, no answer situation. <br/>
You are right if we had an emergency I would like to be able to get in touch <br/>
with him without having to call the local police to drive over there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-158547867">I called. The girl that took the call didn&#39;t sound to understand at all. <br/>
The director just called back. She spoke to the councilor that has Dustin and <br/>
he said Dustin is doing great. No issues, sicknesses or complaints at all. <br/>
<br/>
They did tell me a few kids went home this week and that if they need to <br/>
speak with their parents they are allowed to do so.<br/>
<br/>
She said today they are having a cook out and big get together around the <br/>
fire tonight. <br/>
Tomorrow is graduation and hunter safety certificates will be handed out. <br/>
Dustin has already taken the coarse with me but they said he could take it again <br/>
for fun. <br/>
They also run the Maine Guide service program.<br/>
<br/>
I do hope he had fun.   <br/>
Thank you I am feeling much better now that I was able to speak with them. I <br/>
told her it was best if I didn&#39;t speak to Dustin.  He would tell me I <br/>
embarrassed him later.<br/>
<br/>
He comes home tomorrow and then dinner at Newicks for my birthday so he <br/>
should be thrilled with the meal. He loves seafood and cake.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282609328">All 7 of our kids have been to 4H camp, the older ones for 4 years now.  They <br/>
absolutely love it.  The same kids (from that county) go each year so it&#39;s <br/>
like a reunion.  The end of the week council fire is surrounded by tearful, sad <br/>
faces...no one wants to go home!  I think it works so well because there are a <br/>
lot of familiar faces there.  Their whole 4H group goes...it&#39;s like family.  <br/>
The kids have about 30 or 40 &quot;classes&quot; to choose 3 from, and they do that each <br/>
day.  If they don&#39;t like it, they can switch.  Most of the classes are taught <br/>
by their leaders, or older 4H&#39;ers, or the kid&#39;s parents!  Still, when I <br/>
dropped them off, I looked the counselors straight in the eyes and said, &quot;If anyone <br/>
doesn&#39;t feel well, or wants to come home, CALL ME!!  I will be glad to come <br/>
and get them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I sent the kids to a YMCA camp last year, and they didn&#39;t have near as much <br/>
fun...more like school.  Only one kid wanted to go back, so we definately <br/>
skipped it this year.  <br/>

<br/>
I taught at a Conservation Camp in Vermont for two summers.  It was a GREAT camp, and 95% of the kids had a fabulous time right from the get go, despite a lot of tears as parents were leaving.  The other 5% were always having a blast by the next day -- that first night was the toughest for them, and the instructors took them under their wings and gave them fun jobs to do to get their minds off of being homesick.  After the first night, not a single kid was homesick even for a minute.  They were too busy having fun and being kids! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing your son had an absolute BLAST at camp!  Celebrate his newly developing independence, it means you are doing your job of raising him well.  And be sure to let us all know how much he loved it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806570482">Oh, Laura, I meant to add, if a child at the camp I worked at was really upset, we did let them call home.  So I&#39;ll bet you would have heard from your son if he wasn&#39;t having a good time.  I remember we did have one set of parents come back to pick up their child, who was just too sad without them, but one out of hundreds and hundreds who went on to stay and have a really great time.<br/>
<br/>
We had several home-schooled kids at camp, by the way -- they always adjusted quicker than the public schooled kids, I don&#39;t remember any of them being anything but happy and excited to be there.  I think the parents had a harder time tho.<br/>

minds off of being homesick.  After the first night, not a single kid was <br/>
homesick even for a minute.  They were too busy having fun and being kids! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing your son had an absolute BLAST at camp!  Celebrate his newly <br/>
developing independence, it means you are doing your job of raising him well.  <br/>
And be sure to let us all know how much he loved it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639589934">I went to pick up Dustin at a camp yesterday. When I was walking up the hill <br/>
he was coming down and he burst into tears. I began to cry also asking him <br/>
what was wrong... He said that I had missed his Kayak race. I apologized and told <br/>
him I knew nothing about it. I wasn&#39;t late either.<br/>
<br/>
To make a long story short he loved the camp and asked to go for two weeks <br/>
next time. He misses his counselors but not a few campers. He said he bragged <br/>
too much and everyone hated him. One boy called him a faggit and gay.  He told <br/>
them that that was not very nice so the boy said he was a f****ing A** hole. <br/>
Then the boy asked if he wanted to make something of it.  Dustin said yes and <br/>
the boy pounced him in the face. Dustin who has never fought a day in his life <br/>
except for two years of wrestling and just finished reading the SAS handbook <br/>
knocked the boy on his but. I asked him his counselor said anything he said no <br/>
cuz I didn&#39;t start it and the boy was knocked down. <br/>
He got his first kiss! He said you know Mom I kinda liked it. I said well it <br/>
is nice to be liked isn&#39;t it : ) But I was a bit annoyed that it had happened.<br/>
<br/>
So besides the boys he loved camp. Since last night he has asked for a kayak, <br/>
he wants to go climbing, he wants a 30-06 and wants to go to Canada and hunt <br/>
Caribou and Moose. I suggested to my husband maybe he and Dustin should go <br/>
hunting for a week up north. He still has not been able to take his two weeks <br/>
vacation so maybe they will do that.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry so long....<br/>
