<div id="ygrps-yiv-243664195">Are homeschoolers allowed to deduct the costs for supplies like <br/>
software and art and books on their taxes?  Are we considered <br/>
educators by law if we have to file a letter of intent with the <br/>
county?  <br/>

Sorry, but I didn&#39;t know who else to ask.<br/>

book says &quot;Qualified expenses do not include expenses for home schooling...&quot;<br/>
from the tax booklet pg. 29<br/>

Unless you&#39;re taking someone else&#39;s money to teach their child, I don&#39;t think <br/>
so.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re running a school that has income, your expenses weigh against that <br/>
income.    But not just for educating your own child, as I understand it. <br/>
