Sandra, is that an old book? I have tried ordering it from the library but<br/>
they don&#39;t stock it. And I tried ordering it from the bookshop months ago<br/>
but they said they would have to import it and I still haven&#39;t heard back<br/>
from them.<br/>
=======================<br/>
<br/>
It probably is.  I&#39;m sorry.  So never mind that one.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure where you live, but have you tried talking to the <br/>
reference librarian?  In our state there are two seperate systems <br/>
available outside of our local library co-op.  One is a system that <br/>
you can use to request a book from any library in the state, and the <br/>
other is throughout the nation.  The national service can only be <br/>
accessed using the reference librarian.  It&#39;s worth a shot...<br/>
