wouldn&#39;t want to play with the ball thrower anymore.  The child would also <br/>
learn that if you hurt someone, that person may not want to be your friend, <br/>
or that person may be afraid of you and your actions.  When something like <br/>
this has happened in our home, I have also walked away from the situation and <br/>
said that I&#39;d rather not &quot;play&quot; with that person for now.  <br/>
<br/>
If someone says mean, hateful things to me, then I may say I would rather not <br/>
be around that person at the moment.  I have also stated that I would not <br/>
talk to that person in the same manner, and that it hurts me to be spoken to <br/>
that way, and that I&#39;d rather not be hurt anymore so I am &quot;removing&quot; myself <br/>
from the conversation and I don&#39;t want to  talk for the time being.  If the <br/>
child continues to spout off at me, I ignore.  When there is a change in <br/>
tone, or an apology, or I can see a real change in heart, I don&#39;t dwell on <br/>
the unkind things, we just continue the conversation without the attacks.  <br/>
Maybe I believe this way a little more because we deal with foster children <br/>
who have been raised very differently and on some things, I have to set a <br/>
clear standard or our home would be chaos.  <br/>
<br/>
No one deserves to be spoken to hatefully.  If you were walking down the <br/>
street and observed an elderly person, or someone of a minority race, or <br/>
anyone for that matter, being spat on, being slurred, or attacked <br/>
verbally/physically, would you do nothing?  No one deserves to be treated in <br/>
this way, especially other people in the family and/or ourselves.  When <br/>
someone is stuck unable to function because one child decides they don&#39;t want <br/>
to go, or they cannot control their anger, it affects the entire family, <br/>
especially the other children.  I think the 2 choice principle would work <br/>
well here...we are going to the bank...would you like to bring a book or your <br/>
game so you don&#39;t get bored?  We&#39;re going to the play park to visit with <br/>
other families,...would you like to bring your skates/bike/games to share <br/>
with the other kids, or would you rather read in the car?  <br/>

Good point, and I agree.  In this case, it is not the parent that has to <br/>
decide that they kids can&#39;t play together though, which is not a natural <br/>
consequence.  Also, with young children, addressing the situation with them <br/>
both (if possible) and finding peaceful solutions together will most likely <br/>
prevent continued hard feelings and allow them to continue playing.  I would <br/>
always try to focus on solutions that bring back peace immediately, not <br/>
those that leave  the child left alone in guilt and unhappiness.<br/>
