<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429586954">Hi, my name is Carli and I just joined this list.  My oldest daughter is 4<br/>
1/2 years old.  We (my hubby and I) know that we want to do homeschooling. <br/>
I am just not sure what avenue to take.  Unschooling philosophies are<br/>
appealing to me and make sense.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is, what do you do?  I got a pretty good idea of what<br/>
unschooling is not.  <br/>
<br/>
Currently my daughter loves the time that her sister takes a nap and we do<br/>
&quot;homeschooling.&quot;  This is more a term than an actuality.  But a couple<br/>
times a week, we do practice writing letters and spelling her name.  On<br/>
occassion I have been teaching her the names of different coins and<br/>
teaching her how to classify fruits and vegetables.  These are both done<br/>
through game like activities.  I chose these 2 areas, because she seems to<br/>
have been picking up on it on her own and I wanted to strengthen her<br/>
knowledge.  Anyway, the time we do spend is usually focused time.  It&#39;s<br/>
easiest to do when her 2 year old sister is napping.  Oh, and we always do<br/>
some craft or cooking activity too.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, she absolutely loves this time, and begs for it everyday.  I<br/>
get the feeling that unschooling would be much less casual than this<br/>
focused time I have been spending.<br/>
<br/>
In your opinion, what are some things I should be doing.  And should I<br/>
continue what I am doing, since she enjoys it so much?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a lot.<br/>
<br/>
