Kristen,
<p>You say / ask:
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote TYPE="CITE"><font size="-1">Do you all unschool math as well?&nbsp;
I&#39;ve read over and over the ways you can unschool math, and it is starting
to &quot;sink in&quot;.</font><font size="-1"></font>
<p><font size="-1">&lt;and&gt;</font></p></blockquote>

<blockquote TYPE="CITE"><font size="-1">I can see how this would work.&nbsp;
I worry about gaps though, even though I know we all have gaps. Unschooling
fits our way of life well, but I tend to use it to &quot;supplement&quot; a more
eclectic approach, hmmmm, or do I supplement unschooling with the eclectic
approach??&nbsp; (sigh).</font> <font size="-1">Kristen</font></blockquote>
IMO you can&#39;t unschool one subject, nor can you use unschooling as a supplement.
Unschooling is an attitude to life, not a technique or method. If you stress
the importance of some &#39;subjects&#39; by insisting on the child learning them,
then then you can&#39;t &#39;unschool&#39; another &#39;subject&#39; without saying, in effect,
that this subject is less important than the ones you teach - that you
don&#39;t trust the child to know what s/he wants / needs to learn.
<p>And yet I too struggle with maths. Because I don&#39;t understand it, because
I don&#39;t like it, and because I have found the need for it in my own life.
Yet I have to wonder: is my inability as an old dog to learn the new maths
tricks I need, not directly related to the misery of those enforced math
lessons of my childhood? Is it not precisely because I was made to try
and learn stuff that was at that time totally irrelevant and uninteresting,
that I became math phobic? So is it not better to leave math as an interesting
possibility for future learning, than to try and force it on the unwilling?
<p>And yet..... I worry..... The theory of unschooling is a lot easier
than the living of it, for those of us who are school damaged &lt;sigh&gt;.
