<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028973069">SANDRA! I am so glad you brought up The Friendly Giant -- I had forgotten <br/>
about that show -- I loved it dearly as a kid. Now, thanks to Yahoo, I found <br/>
a video clip from it, a midi of &quot;Early One Morning&quot; (the theme song) and I&#39;m <br/>
having a big time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s shows like this one, and Mr. Rogers, and the old Sesame Street, that <br/>
make me love children&#39;s TV. Some of the shows today (wheeze wheeze cripple <br/>
cripple I&#39;m almost thirty over here) have such a frenetic pace -- they&#39;re <br/>
like an extension of the commercials.<br/>
<br/>
Our TV policy is this: No channels with commercials.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>

&lt;&lt; SANDRA! I am so glad you brought up The Friendly Giant -- I had forgotten <br/>
about that show -- I loved it dearly as a kid. Now, thanks to Yahoo, I found <br/>
a video clip from it, a midi of &quot;Early One Morning&quot; (the theme song) and I&#39;m <br/>
having a big time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I found a little midi thing, but they could have done it as he did!! He <br/>
played it on a recorder, himself, right there as they were panning up from <br/>
his feet to his head.  I think it was a tenor recorder, but it might have <br/>
been an alto (trying to remember from memory!).   <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re ever where I am in person and I have a recorder, I&#39;ll play you that <br/>
themesong!  But I won&#39;t be able to read the stories or do the puppets!  That <br/>
was one really sweet show.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921751602">-=-&quot;You might be interested to learn that Jerome, Rusty, the castle, the <br/>
little chairs and castle backdrop as well as Friendly&#39;s clothing is all on <br/>
display next to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&#39;s Radio and TV Museum <br/>
located at the CBC Broadcasting Centre, 250 Front Street West in Toronto, <br/>
Ontario, Canada.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Another reason to go to Toronto someday!<br/>

This is from an article at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tvparty.com/lostgiant.html">http://www.tvparty.com/lostgiant.html</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Each episode starts with the Giant (who lives in a castle on a farm with <br/>
tiny doll house antiques), saying &quot;Once upon a time, not long ago and not far <br/>
away...&quot;. There was a running plotline that gets explored through <br/>
conversation or by the Giant reading books to the kids at home. There was <br/>
rarely a point of view put across - &quot;What is important is for them (the <br/>
children) to see that we adults enjoy learning.&quot; Homme declared in 1969. <br/>
 <br/>
-=-Homme was serious in his attempts to reach children with new concepts, his <br/>
was a go-slow, gentle approach. &quot;Witness how they repeat and repeat things <br/>
and play records over and over again. They like repetition.&quot; Home said about <br/>
children, &quot;I think the whole world is preoccupied by the concept of change. <br/>
But there are a lot of things that had better not change. And one of them is <br/>
the concept of clarity and coherence.&quot;  -=-</div>
