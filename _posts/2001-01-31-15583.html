<div id="ygrps-yiv-900881935">Hey Nanci!<br/>
<br/>
I am a shameless lurker on this list, but had to put in my .02 here.  I was<br/>
also tired of being sick and tired and finally after years of this, weight<br/>
gain, and a plethora of strange symptoms, got a doctor, told him I felt like<br/>
dirt and could he please figure out what was wrong with me.  A lab visit<br/>
later, he told me that I had hypothyroidism.  The symptom list read like my<br/>
life story and it&#39;s easily treated - hurray!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just a thought.......<br/>
