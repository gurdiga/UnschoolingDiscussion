You&#39;re right, it does matter.  Very much.  My 14 yo stepson who is in ps<br/>
came for vacation the summer before last with a clarinet.  He hated to<br/>
practice it (his mom said he had to and I was the one who was supposed<br/>
to enforce it).  He had no clue how to play it (I had to tell him why it<br/>
kept squeaking - because apparently his teacher had not).  I finally<br/>
asked him why he chose clarinet if he didn&#39;t like it.  He said it was<br/>
because he really wanted to learn saxophone but they had enough sax<br/>
players so this is what he HAD to take to stay in band.  <br/>
 <br/>
Music is not just music.  You choose an instrument because you feel<br/>
something towards the music and sound it creates.  It didn&#39;t surprise me<br/>
to find out he had dropped it a year later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462520255">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lynn and I am new to the group.  I have 2<br/>
daughters I am going to unschool.  I must say that one<br/>
of my grade school musically experiences reflects<br/>
this.  I wanted to play the flute and got move to the<br/>
clarinet because there were enough already playing.  I<br/>
had a music teacher that was an alcoholic and would<br/>
play our instruments to &quot;show&quot; us how.  It was<br/>
disgusting to get it back and have to repeat what he<br/>
had done with to show we were paying attention. <br/>
Gross!!!  I was a music lover, piano playing child and<br/>
I gave up on it because it wasn&#39;t fun and it became<br/>
disgusting.<br/>
<br/>
Just had to post, because your email brought back many<br/>
memories.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227940040">That&#39;s part of how I ended up playing the trumpet in band. Partly because there were already &quot;enough&quot; flute players, and partly because I had a little trouble getting air over the mouthpiece of a flute right off the bat with the &quot;testing.&quot; Looking back, I don&#39;t think it was a fair system, although I understand the whys of it and everything...trying to have a balanced band (the 7th grade beginner band was looked at as training specifically for the 8th grade competitive band rather than simply kids who wanted to play music for the sake of it). <br/>
 <br/>
I hadn&#39;t really thought about any other instrument but the flute, but I didn&#39;t mind the trumpet. Particularly when, on the first day of class, I found myself sitting in 7th chair because all the boys (I was the ONLY girl in the entire brass section, let alone playing the trumpet!) had had summer band and could already play a little. They gave me a hard time that day saying I didn&#39;t belong there, couldn&#39;t play, would never be able to, etc. It took me two weeks just to be able to get a clear, sustained F. But by the end of the semester, guess who was not only sitting in the first chair but had been asked to sit second chair in the 8th grade band (technically first trumpet, as the kid in first chair actually played cornet)? The challenge of it all helped LOL...telling me that I couldn&#39;t do it since I was &quot;just&quot; a girl! <br/>
