With so many little ones and everyone home all the time (if you&#39;d just send<br/>
those kids to school they would stop messin&#39; up your house!) you may have to<br/>
relax your standards.  Maybe you are wanting to have your home look like<br/>
your mothers did when you were a child - and you were in school all day and<br/>
she was at home - or then again maybe you hated your mother&#39;s housekeeping<br/>
and vowed to never have a house like hers!  Yikes!<br/>
<br/>
My $.02 would be that if I was 10 yo and I had 3 younger siblings (doesn&#39;t<br/>
that sound better that 3 little brats) following me around messing up what I<br/>
just straightened, I would find it hard to be motivated!<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was a mess maker and now she&#39;s the one following people around<br/>
picking up after them (&quot;Where&#39;s my glass of water?&quot; &quot;Oh, I poured it out and<br/>
put it in the dishwasher!&quot;)  My 2nd was a real helper as a child - cooked,<br/>
did laundry, whatever - now (at 18) his room, his car, the rest of the<br/>
house - all are dumping grounds for his stuff and he&#39;s out the door!  You<br/>
just never know how things will turn out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it drives you crazy - but sometimes all you can do is take a deep<br/>
breath and chant &quot;This too shall pass&quot;<br/>

help my children with the things they want to do to pursue their <br/>
unschooling,  I need some help around here.  They understand that, <br/>
and although I&#39;m sure they don&#39;t look forward to it,  they are very <br/>
willing to help.   They&#39;ve been responsible for their own rooms for <br/>
as long as I can remember and beyond that,  they&#39;ve always had a chore a <br/>
day - like vacuuming, cleaning toilets, scrubbing floors, wiping down <br/>
bathrooms, etc.  In the early days,  I had to remind them and insist <br/>
that they do them,  but it&#39;s become second nature after all this <br/>
time.  Now my 19 year old is living on her own,  and while I thought <br/>
that was going to mean more chores for my son and I ,  we&#39;ve <br/>
discovered that we don&#39;t have to do certain chores as often with her <br/>
gone - one less person, you know - and the messiest member of the <br/>
family at that !!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-437021294">hi becky -- thnx 4 your thoughts too!  how old are your kids now?<br/>
<br/>
it seems like i am hearing that moms should just do it?  the housework i <br/>
mean?  that certainly would be easier in many ways than trying to train up <br/>
the help....<br/>
<br/>
i guess i want to know if that is what the unschooling way of approaching <br/>
housework is?  mom does it always unless she is lucky enough to have a <br/>
naturally neat child grow up in the household and help?  (not that there is <br/>
only one way, i am just trying to grasp another way to look at this)<br/>
<br/>
no assigning and directing, no charts and reminding?<br/>
<br/>
i have not read the alfie kohen books and wonder if they would help me here, <br/>
also the natural child website that was mentioned a while back about <br/>
non-coersion...(sp?)<br/>
<br/>
i am really curious folks!  would you help me out with your perspective on <br/>
this  if you can? ty!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404540853">I&#39;m one who gets irritable when the house gets TOO cluttered.  Messed up<br/>
with my 1st dd as I did stuff myself bc it was faster.  2nd dd loves to<br/>
&quot;help&quot; (sometimes & she&#39;s 4), my GOAL is to cheerfully let her do it,<br/>
even though it takes longer and doesn&#39;t get done as well.  But how else<br/>
can you get better, than by practice?  Take advantage of young children<br/>
wanting to do everything you do.<br/>
IMO, learning to keep a house is an important skill for males and<br/>
females(not necessarily immaculate, but at least the basics).  Have to<br/>
agree with whoever said that kids will learn how if they perceive it as<br/>
useful.  (ie, see how it&#39;s easier to find the toy you want when they are<br/>
put in place?)<br/>
Lots of good books out there on how to get organized and reduce clutter.<br/>
Also try &quot;401 ways to get your kids to work&quot; or something like that.  I&#39;m<br/>
trying to find the balance between &quot;simplifying&quot; and having stuff I want<br/>
around.<br/>
Zone theory is helpful too.  Which room do people see first when they<br/>
enter your house?  If I keep that room fairly neat, visitor&#39;s FIRST<br/>
impression is of my &quot;clean house&quot; and they won&#39;t think as much about<br/>
dirty dishes or scattered toys.<br/>

Oh no! &lt;g&gt;  We made the living room into a play room for the kids.  The <br/>
family room is larger so that&#39;s where the couch, TV, etc. are.  However, the <br/>
living room is the first thing someone sees when they walk in the front door. <br/>
 In fact, that&#39;s what people see when they&#39;re out on the front porch &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>

the large, heavily decorated &quot;house&quot; made out of a cardboard box, we give a <br/>

OTOH,  when they walk past the play room to the very sunlit, fairly clear (at <br/>
least some days &lt;g&gt;) and open family room, they&#39;ll get a good second <br/>
impression.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018875767">You know, this brings to mind something somebody did to be when i was feeling<br/>
quite the failure in the housekeeping dept.   Think about when your kids and<br/>
their friends are older, do you want them to look back and remember what a nice<br/>
clean house you had, or.....  Wow, wasn&#39;t it fun at the (whoever&#39;s) house?  It<br/>
was so great there.  We got to do everything.<br/>
That really made me think a bit about why it bothered me so much.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>this reminds me of a book we stumbled upon at the library a few<br/>
months back called &quot;The Box&quot; (can&#39;t remember the author).  The<br/>
daughter loves boxes and confiscates one from her Mom before letting<br/>
it go out to the trash.  The story takes the box from one thing to<br/>
another as it begins to fall apart and get so worn.  The Mom keeps<br/>
thinking it&#39;s ready for the trash but the daughter turns it into yet<br/>
another thing but cutting here, taping there.  finally toward the<br/>
end when it won&#39;t even stand upright anymore, she flattens it out<br/>
and uses it as the &quot;ballroom dance floor&quot;.  real cute story that <br/>
encourages creativity and imagination on every page.  i tried to <br/>
find it at Barnes and Noble online and couldn&#39;t even find it in the <br/>
&quot;out of print&quot; section.  but maybe your local libraries will have it <br/>
for all the box lovers out there!  <br/>
