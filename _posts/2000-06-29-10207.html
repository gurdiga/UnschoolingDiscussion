Why, if you you do something you love for a living, is it stressful... Stess<br/>

are stressful. After a long day, with kids arguing and laundry all over, <br/>
being a homemaker is stressful (to ME). That&#39;s not to say I don&#39;t love it. <br/>
My job is quite stressful at times, though I like it. I just don&#39;t want more <br/>
stress at home than I have. That&#39;s why my income-earning occupation takes <br/>
place away from my home.<br/>
<br/>
And since you asked, i think the definition you gave earlier was to the word <br/>
&quot;righteous.&quot; Self-righteous means &quot;filled with or showing a conviction of <br/>
being morally superior or more righteous than others; smugly virtuous.&quot;<br/>
