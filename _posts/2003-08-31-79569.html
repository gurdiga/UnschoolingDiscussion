<div id="ygrps-yiv-682667630"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; if he were in that<br/>
&gt; situation, it&#39;d be a real-world situation, and there he&#39;d be. (And really,<br/>
&gt; there aren&#39;t that many of those in the world.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Military is like that.  Lots of people get themselves into it for longer<br/>
than they want, and can&#39;t figure out how to get out.  But there are ways, it<br/>
depends whether you&#39;re willing to pay the price.  (less than honorable<br/>
discharge for patterns of misconduct, medical discharge for being<br/>
chronically overweight, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thirteen is awfully young to commit to two years, much less what he wants to<br/>
&gt; do for the rest of his life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly.  And there are precious few real-world situations where you can&#39;t<br/>
get out before you&#39;re eighteen years old.  (Except school, if your parents<br/>
won&#39;t let you....)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Besides, both of you have learned something really valuable here: sometimes<br/>
&gt; before making a long, expensive commitment, it&#39;s a good idea to explore other<br/>
&gt; options, and really think about how you want to do something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And that lesson is WELL worth what you&#39;ve paid for it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027920369">8/31/03 20:45:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m sitting here thinking, how could I ever have known that this<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t the right choice for him, when he told me it&#39;s what he wanted?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You couldn&#39;t have known.  Becuase he&#39;s been responsible in the past with<br/>
trying and finishing things, you believed him.  And he believed it himself.<br/>
<br/>
But it turned out not to be right.  Maybe you&#39;ve never had this experience,<br/>
but now he has.  I have; I dropped classes left and right in college.  They<br/>
sounded good, but after a week or two, I realized they weren&#39;t right for me.<br/>
I still got my degrees, and I&#39;m a reasonably responsible human.  It&#39;s okay<br/>
to be wrong. <br/>
<br/>
So this course isn&#39;t right for him.  So?  Is your anger over it and your<br/>
sarcasm going to help him feel better about being wrong?  It isn&#39;t like he<br/>
intentionally was lying to you that this is what he wanted, trying to make<br/>
you waste money!   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re having a bad day with this.  Maybe the whole decision could<br/>
be put off a day or two while you relax and think about it all.<br/>
