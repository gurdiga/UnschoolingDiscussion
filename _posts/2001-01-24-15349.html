&gt; One day the first grade teacher was reading the story of the Three<br/>
&gt; Little<br/>
&gt; Pigs to her class. She came to the part of the story where the first pig<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; trying to accumulate the building materials for his home. She read,<br/>
&gt; &quot;...And<br/>
&gt; so the pig went up to the man with the wheelbarrow full of straw and<br/>
&gt; said,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Pardon me sir, but may I have some of that straw to build my house?&#39;&quot;<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; teacher paused then asked the class, &quot;And what do you think that man<br/>
&gt; said?&quot;<br/>
&gt; One little boy raised his hand and said, &quot;I think he said &#39;Holy Shit! A<br/>
&gt; talking pig!&#39;&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The teacher was unable to teach for the next 10 minutes. </span></blockquote></div>
