<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061585897">Sandra, I know you and I have had multiple conversations about this. (Okay,  <br/>
yeah, it was mostly me nagging and Sandra saying, &quot;But I don&#39;t  wannnnaaaa!&quot;)<br/>
 <br/>
I think compiling essays is a great way to go, because that&#39;s what you do  <br/>
best, and frankly, you probably already HAVE a book written. And your audience  <br/>
is HERE. So I think self-publishing is the way to go.  You know  <br/>
CafePress.com, that does all those cool unschooling tees that people design?  They also do <br/>
books. No minimums, no upfront costs. People can just buy the books  from the <br/>
site. I bet you sell a lot.  <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, I&#39;m nagging again. And a whole bunch of other people are too. Probably  <br/>
easier just to give in.<br/>

up front costs, but specifically a publishing oriented operation as<br/>
opposed to cafepress which does more other merchandise too.  They will<br/>
take care of getting an ISBN number for your book, and I believe it can<br/>
also automatically show up in the amazon.com catalog if you so desire.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lousy excuse. That&#39;s a GOOD deal. Used to be that if you wanted to <br/>
correct a book, you had to wait until the publisher decided it was <br/>
worth reprinting. Years.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if the change is minor, you don&#39;t have to get a new ISBN at all.<br/>
<br/>
If the change is enough to consider it a &quot;new edition,&quot; then you can do <br/>
that ANYTIME, for a small fee ($80).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So - what&#39;s next on your list of excuses? &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ready to knock &#39;em down as fast as you can toss them at us!<br/>

Yup, it would....<br/>
 <br/>
BUT.............<br/>
 <br/>
How cool would that pattern be as the cover of a book (which is done in  <br/>
color with these things) with bright contrasting letters proclaiming the  title:<br/>
 <br/>
Moving a Puddle: Adventures in Unschooling<br/>
by Sandra Dodd<br/>
 <br/>
Sandra, I doubt the nagging is going to go away. Better just to  do it so <br/>
everyone will shut up.<br/>
 <br/>
Reading stuff online is cool....I do it everyday. But books are  nice and you <br/>
can hand them to people and they smell good, and you can say, &quot;Wow,  I really <br/>
wrote a book!&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;ve already written it, really...it&#39;s just time to make it  LOOK like a <br/>
book.<br/>

***********************<br/>
I recently downloaded an out of print book, thinking I could just read it  on <br/>
the computer...<br/>
 <br/>
I ended up printing the whole thing out...I&#39;d rather pay the money for the  <br/>
ink and be able to curl up under the covers with a reading light, or on the <br/>
sofa  with a cup of coffee.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s like apples and oranges to me...I read online for info, and some  <br/>
enjoyment.  But a good book I&#39;ve been waiting for is a delight!  <br/>
 <br/>
And I have to admit, although I&#39;ve been part of this list about 3 years,  <br/>
there is so much on Sandra&#39;s website that I have never read, because I hate  <br/>
sitting at a computer and reading.  We have 7 kids in the house, and I&#39;d  much <br/>
rather have it printed out so they can get some computer time in too!   So <br/>
writing a book will enable more kids to use the internet!!  LOL!<br/>
