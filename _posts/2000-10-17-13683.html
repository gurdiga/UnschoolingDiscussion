<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110346700">Hi Cath, I appreciate your feedback. I understand about the envy of the <br/>
&quot;no-brainer&quot; pregnancies. I am also envious of those who are lucky or <br/>
blessed enough to have the number of children they wanted. It is not always <br/>
possible to have such a clear-cut course and be able to follow it.<br/>
<br/>
I saw in another one of your posts that you mentioned you would like to <br/>
have a homebirth the second time around. This reminds me of one of the <br/>
reasons why I would like to have another birth child: I am in such a <br/>
different place now, that my birth/baby-raising experience would be so <br/>
different than it was with my son. After all, now I am &quot;out of the box&quot; <br/>
because of home/unschooling, and I feel empowered to make that birth <br/>
experience more what I had hoped the first one would have been. (I think of <br/>
all the ways homeschooling has helped me grow as a person, that I guess it <br/>
is not necessarily off topic to talk about its influence on birth here.)<br/>
My son was a C-section, and I feel now that the surgery and all its related <br/>
recovery stress may have been avoided had I had a doula or midwife with me <br/>
to encourage me to follow my heart, instead of to be persuaded by <br/>
conventional medicine (and family). The same with nursing, which became a <br/>
struggle I gave up because I didn&#39;t have any support. Now I know many other <br/>
homeschoolers to whom I could turn for advice and encouragement in this <br/>
regard. I guess this is not a valid reason for having a second child, but <br/>
it is still in my heart: I would like to have another child and do things <br/>
the way I want this time, in light of my empowered viewpoint. I now feel <br/>
strong enough to speak up for myself instead of just going along. <br/>
Unfortunately, I was raised in a very conventional setting, and I was not <br/>
so enlightened when I had my son; I was a stressed, overprotective, <br/>
mainstream mom when he was born. I envy those who got out of the box prior <br/>
to having their children. Well, I&#39;ve made a lot of parenting decisions I <br/>
wish I could change, but you can&#39;t go back, you can only go forward.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ll risk being a little more wordy here.) On the other hand, I also <br/>
firmly believe in giving a home to those children already born who are in <br/>
need of love and a home. So adoption is very much on my mind also. I would <br/>
love to hear from other homeschooling families who have adopted while <br/>
homeschooling to hear of their experiences.<br/>
<br/>
I usually don&#39;t post my personal thoughts here, but these issues are on my <br/>
mind right now, and your email and those of others have prompted me to <br/>
share. Sorry for the babble!<br/>
<br/>
I wish you peace and happiness as well, and I hope you will be successful <br/>
in whichever direction you go.<br/>

&gt;Olivia, thank you for sharing.  I am new to the list and appreciate getting<br/>
&gt;to know everyone.  I agree with your comment above that the option-weighing<br/>
&gt;process with regard to future children is challenging.  I / we have to weigh<br/>
&gt;the desire for sharing a pregnancy-birth-new sibling experience with each<br/>
&gt;other and our son, with the fact that fertility treatments are very expensive<br/>
&gt;and emotionally exhausting. For some, adding children is a surprise or a<br/>
&gt;no-brainer (comes without a thought), and I am in serious envy!! Anyway, I<br/>
&gt;wish you well in your decision making and peace of mind with the way things<br/>
&gt;are going.<br/>

I just wanted to thank you for your wonderful and empowering testimonial<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054626107">You are welcome, Sonia. I am glad someone can relate. After I wrote that <br/>
long response I thought, I&#39;m not only out of the box but now I&#39;m standing <br/>
on top of it giving a speech! LOL  I&#39;ll say that the journey to unschooling <br/>
certainly helps you find your voice.<br/>
