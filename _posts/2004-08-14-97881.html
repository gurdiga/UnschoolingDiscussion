If you  were driving the wrong way to get to your destination, wouuld you go <br/>
to  the next town or intersection and then turn around?   Or would you  turn <br/>
around as soon as you knew you were going the wrong  way?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I have never understood this.  Often when I feel I have gone the wrong  way <br/>
while trying to get somewhere, I will keep going, based on the fact that I  <br/>
have likely looked at a map before I left, probably have the map in the car, and  <br/>
an alternate route is likely available.  It drives my husband NUTS.   :)<br/>
 <br/>
But I get to see a part of town that I wouldn&#39;t have seen, maybe.  I  learn <br/>
how to get around in a new town.  I may even run across the the  very thing I <br/>
was looking for, which has happened many times.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve also ended up in a very nasty neighborhood in Chicago late at night  <br/>
where a 9 yo boy came and scared the living daylights out of me by trying to  <br/>
wash the windshield.  I&#39;ve hit dead ends.  There are times when I  just turn <br/>
around, but not every often.<br/>
 <br/>
Not all who wander are lost.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671419922">I wander around, too. lol <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned that what often happens is that I connect<br/>
two parts of my mental map with a new route, and I<br/>
LOVE that.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, often, I end up having to go someplace new, look<br/>
at a map, and lo and behold, it&#39;s right where that new<br/>
route was, or near it.  <br/>
<br/>
My world widens. <br/>
<br/>
I used to be very phobic about getting lost.  <br/>
Now, I get *found*. lol<br/>

I was born there and lived there until I was 3, when we moved to  Romeoville. <br/>
 But then at 11 we moved to Arkansas.<br/>
 <br/>
I was on the expressway with my mother, and we were trying to get to a  hotel <br/>
out by O&#39;Hare from the south side.  There was construction and we had  to get <br/>
off and it got squirrely and we couldn&#39;t get back on near where we got  off, <br/>
and that&#39;s how we ended up with the windshield incident.  :)<br/>
 <br/>
I like Chicago.  Love to visit.  <br/>

That&#39;s funny, because I was thinking of state highways out in New Mexico.  If <br/>
you&#39;re not headed toward the town you need to go to, you will not ever find <br/>
that town driving away from it, and every mile you drive is going to have to be <br/>
re-drivin the other way.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, if I&#39;m looking for a WalMart in Albuquerque I can wander around.   I <br/>
think there might be six of them now.  But if I&#39;m looking for Pecos, driving on <br/>
to find another one won&#39;t help much at all! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
See, now if you weren&#39;t even supposed to be in Chicago at all, that would be <br/>
very bad. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well, I do USUALLY know what town I should be going to, and whether I&#39;m  <br/>
going the right direction.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
 <br/>
For some reason I get my directions mixed up in Florida, a lot. There&#39;s  <br/>
something about a big body of water being on both sides of me that throws me  off.<br/>
 <br/>
The more I think about whether to turn around or not, the more I think that  <br/>
the answer is &quot;it depends.&quot;  I went on a Young Life trip to Colorado in  high <br/>
school and the van I was in did take a wrong turn at New Mexico and  DID run <br/>
out of gas in the middle of the desert on a SUNDAY in 1978.   We probably <br/>
should have turned around.<br/>
