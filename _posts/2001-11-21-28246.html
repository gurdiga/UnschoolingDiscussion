<div id="ygrps-yiv-1871730453">I&#39;m a Christian, too. Training can be by example, it doesn&#39;t require a whip,<br/>
a chair, or even chore lists. In my opinion, it SHOULD be by example, first<br/>
and foremost and maybe last and hindmost, too. I have found children in<br/>
general (and my own close up) make excellent choices if given the chance.<br/>

Those of us who are Christians also have a Biblical mandate to &quot;train<br/>
up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not<br/>
depart from it&quot;.  How can we &quot;train up&quot; a child, if we never require<br/>
anything of him?<br/>
