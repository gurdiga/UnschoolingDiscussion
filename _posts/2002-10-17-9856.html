<div id="ygrps-yiv-405292851">You can have your kid&#39;s name put on a CD that&#39;s going to Mars next year. <br/>
You get a cool certificate too. <br/>
We did this before, for the Mars Polar Lander but sadly, that&#39;s the one<br/>
they burned up in the Martian atmosphere. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
We could send up all the names of these amazing kids who will, maybe, be<br/>
going there themselves one of these days.<br/>
