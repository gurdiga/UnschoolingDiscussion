yes, i see the same in my dds, and i was a second daughter myself so i <br/>
remember some of it...  i often tried to choose a different path than my big <br/>
sis, to avoid the comparisons that would inevitably be made...  it is a great <br/>
concern of mine, how to help my dds appreciate each other without feeling <br/>
competitive!  id like them to see themselves as valued individuals yet <br/>
nurture their special relationship.  (high expectations, i know!)  but my <br/>
older sis had (neg) feelings about me that i never knew until we were both <br/>
grown...  anyway, just want to encourage all to share ways that you have <br/>
found to do this with especially girl siblings close in age.<br/>
