If he&#39;s not old enough to stay near you, then you should hold his hand.<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be okay for you or your husband to climb those stairs and it&#39;s <br/>
not okay for him.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Then when he does runs all over the store as I try to chase him (and<br/>
catch him). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Hold his hand until he&#39;s old enough to stay with you, or have him hold on to <br/>
your purse or backpack or something.   Or keep him in a cart if there are <br/>
carts.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never had kids I had to chase, so I don&#39;t know what to say.   Were you <br/>
very strict before?<br/>
<br/>
All I can guess (and it could be a wholly wrong guess) is that somehow you <br/>
had an adversarial relationship and aren&#39;t quite at the partner stage yet.   If <br/>
he sees getting away from you as a win, and coming back to you as a loss, <br/>
maybe see what you can do about the way you talk to him about going with you, and <br/>
how he needs to act in public.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-When I catch him his body almost seems to relax.  I<br/>
then carry him out of the store.  I feel frazzled but glad I can<br/>
talk with him calming not get angry.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t chase him.   I wouldn&#39;t catch him.   I would set the condition of <br/>
holding my hand or not gong to the store with me, until he&#39;s able to stay <br/>
near, and come when you ask him to.<br/>
