<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599485394">Mary...Here is the situation I find myself in with my 3 year old and her<br/>
&#39;reading&#39;.  She has already learned the 26 basic letter sounds.  She did<br/>
this back when she was about 2 1/2!  She was an early talker, and very<br/>
verbal and very interested in letters and words.  We&#39;ve been reading<br/>
with her since she was a baby and now, must read an average of 10-15<br/>
books a day (by her request!).  I&#39;ll catch her &#39;reading&#39; to her dolls<br/>
and stuffed animals.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now she&#39;s very into rhyming.  Em makes up songs and rhymes the<br/>
ending sentences (and will make up a nonsense word to rhyme if she can&#39;t<br/>
think of a &#39;real&#39; word&#39; :)  Anyway, she notices that some words that<br/>
rhyme are spelled similarly, and some words are spelled differently<br/>
(like cream and seem, for example).  <br/>
<br/>
My question to you all (regarding helping her learn &#39;sounds&#39;) is how do<br/>
you explain (once they understand and are sounding out the basic 26<br/>
sounds) all those other sounds?  Like, this morning she was sounding out<br/>
a book she&#39;d picked up, A Trip to the Pond.  First she sounded out<br/>
&#39;p-o-n-d&#39; and exclaimed POND!  Then she did the same with &#39;trip&#39;.  But<br/>
then she sounded out &#39;to&#39; and of course &#39;to&#39; doesn&#39;t say &#39;tuh&#39; &#39;ah&#39;...it<br/>
says &#39;tuh&#39; &#39;oo&#39;.  I&#39;m looking for ideas in HOW to explain these<br/>
differences.  How about why the &#39;oa&#39; in boat, doesn&#39;t sound out that<br/>
way, but instead the &#39;oa&#39; makes an &#39;oh&#39; sound?  I think Em is looking<br/>
for some guidance, and I&#39;m unsure of how to explain it to her.  <br/>
Am I making too much of all this?  Do you just plainly state what<br/>
different words sound like, or do you actually explain &#39;why&#39;?  That&#39;s<br/>
why the book reading reflex seemed attractive.  They use the ideas of<br/>
sound pictures, which seemed easier to comprehend for kids that the way<br/>
I&#39;d learned..   For example, they say that the letter &#39;o&#39; has many<br/>
&#39;sound pictures&#39;....the _sound_ &#39;oe&#39; as in &#39;toe&#39; can also be spelled as<br/>
&#39;oa&#39; as in &#39;boat&#39;, &#39;ough&#39; as in &#39;though&#39;, &#39;ow&#39; as in &#39;tow&#39;. But anyway,<br/>
I&#39;m feeling like I could use some guidance and suggestions.  I&#39;m<br/>
floundering!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling like if I can help her understand the basics (which she<br/>
seems to grasp very easily) that she&#39;ll love reading and be a great<br/>
speller, which will, in turn help her on the road to learning anything<br/>
she wants...  But is this a &#39;correct&#39; assumption?  Or am I still too<br/>
hung up on thinking that she &#39;needs&#39; to know these basics to become a<br/>
good reader and speller???<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&quot;When two vowels go walking<br/>
the first one does the talking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And tell her there are exceptions to that too!  <br/>
And a later vowel (either immediately or after a consonate) usually makes the <br/>
vowel &quot;longer&quot; (say its name).<br/>
<br/>
Holly heard another one on TV, on Between the Lions:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When two vowels stand side by side,<br/>
The first one says its name with pride.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was in &quot;vowel boot camp,&quot; she says.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Am I making too much of all this?  Do you just plainly state what<br/>
different words sound like, or do you actually explain &#39;why&#39;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Often they &quot;why&quot; is because of vowel shifts hundreds of years ago, wars <br/>
between nations, the natural tendency of common words to lose precision <br/>
because everyone knows the word in context, and if there is a word in a <br/>
language with no near-sounding neighbors it&#39;s often contracted (shortened).  <br/>
That&#39;s too much to explain to just say one little thing!<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly was talking about Al and all, and how the verb changes for <br/>
having more letters.  Al is a name, and names rarely follow rules! &lt;g&gt;  She <br/>
also pointed out &quot;of&quot; and &quot;off&quot; do the same sort of thing.  Some things you <br/>
just have to look at and go &quot;Yep, that&#39;s the way it is.&quot;  Otherwise you&#39;re <br/>
into the whole history of Germanic tribes and human anatomy.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I won&#39;t say hung up. I&#39;ll say worried.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ll also say don&#39;t worry. :-) She needs to know them but she doesn&#39;t<br/>
need taught them. And she&#39;ll learn them without even realizing she&#39;s<br/>
learning them.<br/>
<br/>
If you were to try to teach English to a toddler you&#39;d get even more<br/>
overwhelmed. We take the learning of spoken English so casually and yet look<br/>
at how difficult it is to learn a foreign language formally! The only reason<br/>
we think reading needs some high powered explanations is because schools<br/>
teach it -- and don&#39;t do a good job at it either! So that makes it sound<br/>
like it&#39;s *really* hard.<br/>
<br/>
But schools teach foreign languages too -- and don&#39;t do a very good job at<br/>
that either. Whereas your daughter picked up English all on her own as a<br/>
side effect of living and I bet has done a fabulous job at it! :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you just plainly state what<br/>
&gt; different words sound like, or do you actually explain &#39;why&#39;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t sound like the book explains why either. It just attempts to draw<br/>
a pattern out of the chaos of English. That&#39;s the way we all learn. We take<br/>
in input and naturally draw patterns from it and from that devise rules. But<br/>
the patterns the book presents probably won&#39;t be the same patterns she would<br/>
pull out and definitely -- since the patterns won&#39;t be in context -- have<br/>
the same meaning.<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, as you&#39;ve done helping her speak English, just tell her what the<br/>
word is and she&#39;ll naturally figure out patterns and rules as she acquires<br/>
more and more words. That discovery is really the fun part! It&#39;s an<br/>
adventure because you never know what surprising thing you&#39;ll stumble on.<br/>
:-)  It&#39;s a mystery or detective story. Phonics books just skip the story<br/>
and tell you who did it. How interesting is that? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If she gets curious about the inconsistencies in spellings you can mention<br/>
that every language has it&#39;s own spelling rules but English has words from<br/>
all over the world. So every word carries a bit of history inside and tells<br/>
you of its travels, like words that spell the f sounds as &quot;ph&quot; and the k<br/>
sound as &quot;ch&quot; are from the Greek, &quot;ough&quot; probably means Old English.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean she won&#39;t enjoy the book or that it would be &quot;dangerous&quot;.<br/>
She might think the patterns they show are really neat. She might like to<br/>
look at the pictures. Don&#39;t worry about her doing it &quot;right&quot;. Just let her<br/>
enjoy. Or not and move onto something else she does enjoy :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You just explain them as they come up. First - explain that there are words <br/>
you just need to recognize -- you can start her a master list of them: &quot;to&quot;, <br/>
&quot;the&quot;, and explain that they are often words that are used REALLY often - <br/>
that&#39;s why they got warped into sounding different than they look. Later you <br/>
can add to her list, saying: &quot;That is one of THOSE words - let&#39;s write it on <br/>
your big list.&quot; Just as they come up... not in any planned way. You don&#39;t <br/>
need a system, just be responsive.<br/>
<br/>
For the &quot;oa&quot; in boat -- you can say that there are LOTS of words like that -- <br/>
so that when she sees &quot;oa&quot; she should give that &quot;oh&quot; sound a try -- and play <br/>
your rhyming games with oat and goat and float and boat etc.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry - just be responsive.<br/>
