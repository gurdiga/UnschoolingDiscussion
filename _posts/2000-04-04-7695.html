<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255235535">Now that everyone knows that this is OFF TOPIC, I wan to share something<br/>
that is very near to my heart. Tonight, I was reading my e-news. In the<br/>
entertainment section, there was a focus on the song &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; by the<br/>
Dixie Chicks (Country). It stated that 20 out of 149 radio stations chose<br/>
NOT to play this song because a battered woman plots and kills her abusive<br/>
husband in it. I wrote a letter to Lon Helton (of Country Countdown USA)<br/>
regarding that particular song. I am open to any and all comments PRIVATELY.<br/>
The letter is below. I would like to know what your thought are. thanks.<br/>
Stephanie<br/>
Mr. Lon Helton<br/>

<br/>
Mr. Helton,<br/>
I am writing this in regard to the single &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot; from the Dixie<br/>
Chicks. As a survivor of DV (domestic violence) I can personally relate to<br/>
the feelings that drove Wanda and Mary Anne to poison the black eyed peas.<br/>
Domestic violence is much bigger today than is heard of, and unfortunately<br/>
is not getting the attention it so badly needs. DV has many forms: physical,<br/>
psychological, and emotional; and it is extremely hard for a battered person<br/>
to find their way out. I cannot understand why radio stations have decided<br/>
not to play &quot;Goodbye Earl&quot;, but they will play Martina  McBride&#39;s<br/>
&quot;Independence Day&quot;. Both songs depict the end of a violent relationship. The<br/>
discussion of women plotting their abuser&#39;s death is not new, but the<br/>
majority of women do not make it that far. They end up in Intensive Care or<br/>
die. Many women may think of &quot;getting back&quot; at their abuser, only to<br/>
immediately dismiss the thought, since if caught thinking such a thought<br/>
could (and would) provoke another beating.<br/>
    Domestic violence needs to be put into the media, and if this is a way<br/>
to get DV noticed, then I am all for it! Please feel free to contact me for<br/>
any questions or comments that you may have- I am more than willing to<br/>
share. Sincerely Mrs Stephanie A Coomer (now married to a non abuser!)<br/>
