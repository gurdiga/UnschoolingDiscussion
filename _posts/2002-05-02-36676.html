<br/>
&gt;&gt; with &quot;training pants&quot;. I made that decision after<br/>
&gt;&gt; only one time seeing a<br/>
&gt;&gt; woman at church change her child who was wearing<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;training pants&quot; and he had<br/>
&gt;&gt; pooped them. In the process of removing them, the<br/>
&gt;&gt; poop got smeared all over his legs - it was an awful<br/>
&gt;&gt;mess to clean up.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I was reading your post and wondered if the women in<br/>
&gt;the church removed the training pants as if it was<br/>
&gt;underwear?   LOL My girlfriend did it that way and it<br/>
&gt;smeared everywhere.  I had to explain to her that your<br/>
&gt;supose to rip them on the side like you would diapers!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I loved them because I didn&#39;t have to worry about the<br/>
&gt;tape not sticking. Iused them instead of diapers.<br/>

<br/>
This was over 20 years ago before the days of disposable training pants.(I<br/>
am probably ancient compared to most on this list :-) You couldn&#39;t just rip<br/>
them down the side; they were cloth. Very sturdy cloth that would have been<br/>
very difficult to tear. I must admit that my younger two did venture into<br/>
the disposable training pants, because to me the only difference between<br/>
them and diapers was that the kids could pull them on and off by themselves.<br/>
But we never ventured into cloth underpants, training or otherwise, until<br/>
they were proficient with potty.<br/>

crawling away during diaper changes and standing once I have caught up to him <br/>

1/2 we have never pushed her.  She uses the potty until she sleeps then she <br/>
wears Atta Girls her choice either way. She has used the potty for the <br/>
longest time but nights she does not wake with the urge. That&#39;s fine with me. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to read the book though for knowledge. I have never followed <br/>
someone else&#39;s teachings to the letter. I follow what I feel works for me and <br/>
my family. Bits and pieces of what works for me.  From looking at the site I <br/>
didn&#39;t get the impression that it was &quot;Potty Training&quot; in that sense. The <br/>
book as explained on the site sounded loving and nurturing if anything I <br/>
could always learn more ways to enjoy my children&#39;s younger years. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>People have a natural strong adversion to soiling themselves (just as most<br/>
mammals do- except shoot- porcupines- man do they STINK).<br/>
<br/>
When babies are born they give all sorts of signs to try to communicate to<br/>
their mom that they have to go- but because the mom isn&#39;t even thinking<br/>
about it, she ignores it.   In order for a person to sit in wet and dirty<br/>
clothes, they have to &quot;turn off&quot; down there- Later, they are supposed to<br/>
turn it back on.<br/>
<br/>
So what I am saying is that they are not &quot;care free&quot; about soiling<br/>
themselves- they DO care and they DONT like it.  - they only &quot;dont care&quot;<br/>
when they have had to do it so much, I mean really, they have no choice.<br/>
<br/>
In effect, where we are thinking, &quot;lets be kind and let them potty train<br/>
when they are ready&quot;..  what we are really saying is, &quot;you might not like<br/>
sitting in this, but until you can take off your clothes, say &quot;I have to go<br/>
potty&quot;, do it all your self- I won&#39;t help you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
SO lets help them!!  Lets help our babies get to the potty when they want to<br/>
go :-)<br/>
<br/>
ANd here are some links to places to buy diapers (to answer the other<br/>
poster). Some people who do EC (elimination communication) in our culture<br/>
also use cloth diapers some or all of the time- just unsnapping them to pee,<br/>
then snapping them back up<br/>

<br/>
EC (elimination communication) is NOT potty training, with praise and<br/>
stickers and coersion and control.  It is about communication- like<br/>
breastfeeding.  Like when you know your baby wants to nurse, &#39;cause he<br/>
&quot;tells&quot; you- this is just communication about what goes out of the baby too.<br/>
<br/>
The closeness and complete bond this generates is immeasurable.  In fact, I<br/>
would do this again even if I never &quot;caught&quot; a pee- just holding your baby<br/>
when he doesnt have a diaper on is beautiful!.  And I have to say- sleeping<br/>
with your naked baby IS heaven- I am serious- *heaven* where you are aware<br/>
that love has enveloped and is every ounce of matter.<br/>

or wet diaper, but I also know some babies do NOT like having thier diaper <br/>
changed.  When I worked in a preschool with the 2 year olds, it was about <br/>
even for babies who didnt like dirty diapers, and would sure tell you in a <br/>
hurry they needed a diaper change ( and yes, these were usually the &quot;early&quot; <br/>
pottiers) , and babies who would rather wear a stinky all day then lay down <br/>
and get cleaned up.  Also, I have known children who pee peed in the potty <br/>
very easily, but had an aversion to pooping in the potty.  I believe the <br/>

<br/>
  I have four children of my own, 8 neices and nephews, I have babysat at <br/>
least half a dozen children in my home, and I worked in a preschool,   So, my <br/>
exposure and experience with babies is not limited.  Their actions and <br/>
reactions concerning peeing and pooping, diaper changing, and using the potty <br/>
are as varied as  each of their own unique personalities.   <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Do they really? All babies? You know that for sure?<br/>
<br/>
I was well aware of this (potty training babies) when my last was born and<br/>
was very in tune to her and I couldn&#39;t tell when she was telling me she had<br/>
to go. Of course if it was practical for me to let her be naked, not worry<br/>
about my carpets and clothes when going out in public as much as I do, I<br/>
would imagine I would just pick up on her schedule. It would probably work<br/>
great if I was in a hut somewhere with no Target or Publix to go to or<br/>
errands to run and clothes to wear. Would also be nice if I had a village to<br/>
watch my children instead of doing it all myself.  My mom had me potty<br/>
trained at 1 year old. Not that I could actually say hey I need to go potty,<br/>
but SHE knew when as I had a schedule. SHE knew when to hold me over the<br/>
potty.<br/>
<br/>
Are you saying everyone who has a child in diapers is doing the child a<br/>
diservice by making them do something they really don&#39;t want to do? That<br/>
they really want to go potty and we aren&#39;t attentive enough to give them<br/>
what they need?<br/>
<br/>
My youngest now is 2 and half and has no clue that she needs to pee or poop.<br/>
Really none whatsoever. She&#39;ll be naked and just pee all over and look at<br/>
what she did and then tell me she peed. Sometimes she says she pooped when<br/>
she didn&#39;t. But I guess that&#39;s my fault because I didn&#39;t do it soon enough?<br/>
At one month if I would have been smarter she would be going on the potty<br/>
now. I really don&#39;t have time to clean up myself or the floors all day,<br/>
especially right after a baby is born. I have other children to take care of<br/>
let alone a house filled with all sorts of things. I don&#39;t see having my<br/>
kids in diapers is a bad thing. They are very comfortable and with the<br/>
disposable diapers being the way they are now, the children are really never<br/>
uncomfortable let alone rashy. I see, for me, taking the time to train an<br/>
infant, and I do see it as training, is more bad then good for all my<br/>
children involved.<br/>
<br/>
Trying to figure out when your baby needs to go is wonderful for someone who<br/>
wants to do that. Great for the family if it all works. I just couldn&#39;t see<br/>
it working here and the one mom I knew who did it, was rather disturbing in<br/>
how long she would hold the poor baby over a potty with nothing happening<br/>
for 5 minutes. Then to have her try again 5 minutes later. She swore the<br/>
baby would give her signals. Maybe I just always caught her on a bad day.<br/>
<br/>
And if the tone of this letter sounds anything more then me just talking,<br/>
I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m not mad or upset or looking for trouble. Just talking and not<br/>
taking the time to try and make it all nice. I know this works for many<br/>
people and different cultures and so does lots of things we don&#39;t do here.<br/>
Just not wanting to make others feel inferior for not &quot;knowing&quot; their babies<br/>
well enough.<br/>

<br/>
Surely you don&#39;t think they WANT to sit in their pee and poop??  I&#39;m <br/>
venturing a guess that they would rather go on about their business *rather* <br/>
than have their diaper changed.  NOT because they enjoy the feeling of <br/>
sitting in their poo!  I also know other children who have tender skin and <br/>
would risk sitting in a diaper rather than face the fear of pain associated <br/>
with wiping a tender bum.<br/>
<br/>
***Also, I have known children who pee peed in the potty<br/>
very easily, but had an aversion to pooping in the potty.  I believe the <br/>
&quot;scared to poop in the potty&quot; kids had that fear that part of them was being <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve heard this happen.  The key part of your sentence is &quot;scared to poop in <br/>
the potty&quot;.  You didn&#39;t say they wanted to sit in their poop.  There is a <br/>
HUGE difference.<br/>
<br/>
***Their actions and reactions concerning peeing and pooping, diaper <br/>
changing, and using the potty are as varied as  each of their own unique <br/>
personalities.***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, their reactions do vary widely, but none of this implies that ANY child <br/>
enjoys peeing and pooping on themselves.  They may not want to stop what <br/>
they are doing to be changed.  They may not like sitting still to be <br/>
changed.  They may be scared of the potty.  They may fear the sight of their <br/>
poop being flushed away.  But I do NOT believe any of this suggests that <br/>
they want, enjoy or wish to sit in their excrement.<br/>

BOY.. A POOPY DIAPER!.. But, barring any sensitive skin reaction, I think <br/>
some kids really don&#39;t give it a second thought.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;arguing&quot; the point.  I&#39;m just expressing my opinion.  I could be <br/>
wrong, but unless babies start talking and telling us exactly what they think <br/>
and feel, we will have to rely on guessing at thier cues, or lack thereof.  I <br/>
am saying, from my own experience, I have known children who really didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to care if they have a dirty diaper on.  And, yes, I have known children <br/>
who cried miserably as soon as thier pee started hitting thier diaper.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This goes along exactly with something I read when one of my children were <br/>
&quot;potty aware age&quot;  A baby goes through 3 stages before their body is ready to <br/>
&quot;potty&quot;  First, they are aware that they peed or pooped.  Just like you <br/>
explained about your daughter.. A child may soil their diaper then come and <br/>
tell you.  The second stage is that they are aware when they are actually <br/>
doing it.  Like.. OH, I AM PEEING/POOPING.  I have seen kids at this age.  <br/>
They begin to pee or poop and they get some strange look over thier face..  <br/>
Like, &quot;oh, oh, something is happening here!&quot;  The third stage is when they <br/>
know they are going to do it.  &quot;Oh, I feel like I need to pee/poop!&quot;.  At <br/>
first, they may have the urge to eliminate, feel the urge, but not know quiet <br/>
what it is, but eventually, they figure it out.. lol<br/>
<br/>
  Every child is different, there is no set age when children go through <br/>
these stages, and no set time that each phase lasts til the next phase comes <br/>
in.  But, generally it&#39;s been a good sort of guideline for me to know when my <br/>
children ( or others) were ready to use the potty.  Basically,  when they are <br/>
ready, they start telling you.. <br/>

<br/>
I met Ingrid, the author of the book, at a La Leche League conference.  I<br/>
was sitting at the homeschooling information table and she was next to me<br/>
with her weeks old baby in a sling.  Every so often she&#39;d feel the babe<br/>
wiggle and off she&#39;d go to the restroom.  She and her family live a gentle,<br/>
natural, back-to-the-land kind of life, but I don&#39;t think you&#39;d have to live<br/>
exactly as she does to  use these methods successfully. Ingrid herself was<br/>
diaper-free by about one year of age - her mother had just done what she<br/>
thought seemed right.  Ingrid decided to explore it and, voila, diaper-free<br/>
babies and a book!<br/>
<br/>
Even if you don&#39;t ever plan to do the diaper-free thing, her book is<br/>
fascinating reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241728193"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My daughter is doing this with her youngest.  He gets really restless when<br/>
&gt; he has to go.  She&#39;s caught a lot of them, but she&#39;s the one being<br/>
&gt; potty-trained.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess you could also say that moms are &quot;trained&quot; by their babies to nurse<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
It really is a huge shift in thinking - it goes against everything we have<br/>
been told, and seen, and learned.  Kind of like shifting to really getting<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sascha is just more comfortable than he might be otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First off, I think it is incredible that you are supportive of her- so many<br/>
people -  are incredulous and think it is rediculous at best.  I thought it<br/>
was silly- and I am an earth mother supreme- besides I liked diapers!  they<br/>
were fluffy and cute out of the dryer.<br/>
<br/>
And I know to other people, even supportive ones- it seems like alot of<br/>
trouble just so he can be &quot;more comfortable than he might be otherwise&quot;.<br/>
But it is not trouble- any more than breastfeeding when a baby wants to is<br/>
more trouble than breastfeeding on a schedule.  And what mother in baby love<br/>
would not want them to be more comfortable- (even though it is much more<br/>
than being comfortable).<br/>
<br/>
I think what helps for us just learning is to have the goal being that the<br/>
baby maintains awareness of his elimination- and maybe that means useing<br/>
diapers all the time, but doing your best to change *right* after each pee,<br/>
or maybe that means a naked baby 24/7.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nighttime is where my daughter has gotten hung up.  If she doesn&#39;t catch<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the bed (and the rest of the family) gets wet.  How do you handle that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are many options at night- some people always use diapers at night,<br/>
some never.  Is she on the EC list?  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.babieswithoutdiapers.com/">http://www.babieswithoutdiapers.com/</a>  i<br/>
think she can get to it from here.<br/>
<br/>
There are alot of ideas about it there.  I can say that to me, it was worth<br/>
the risk of missing a pee- I can also give practical suggestions- but that<br/>
list is incredible- the night time thing comes up quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Part of what is the problem in trying to teach ourselves this is that we<br/>
have no modeling and have never seen it done.  I had great imprinting for<br/>
breastfeeding- my mother nursed my sister 12 years my junior, for four<br/>
years.  I NEVER questioned if bf would work- or even how it would work.  I<br/>
have been helping moms bf for 14 years now and so many moms are so worried-<br/>
they just dont have the imprinting and are trying to do it from scratch, it<br/>
is really hard to do- to go against your imprinting (or lack of!  some<br/>
people have never held a baby, much less seen one nurse).   EC is a really<br/>
far jump for other people- because it really is like swimming up stream. --<br/>
like trying to understand why on earth your grandaughter is being<br/>
homeschooled!-  what my poor parents and in laws have gone through with me!<br/>
<br/>
I talk about this when ever I can (I have mentioned it on this list before!)<br/>
because if I knew about it with my other kids I would have done it-<br/>
especially with my middle child- he HATED diapers, no matter how &quot;fun&quot; I<br/>
made it- in fact, once he figured out how to take them off- he did, so he<br/>
was diaper free with out the communication :-).<br/>
<br/>
I talk about it because what we are told about &quot;potty readiness&quot; is NOT<br/>
true. NOT true.<br/>
<br/>
I talk about it as much as I can because it was an paradigm shift for me-<br/>
earth changing- and I thought I had heard and done every &quot;natural&quot; parenting<br/>
thing possible- it gave me something that was missing with my other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t talk about it to instill guilt and arouse defenses with people who<br/>
feel bad about decisions they made. People can only do what they can do.  I<br/>
can make a really big list of things I wish I was doing differently from<br/>
buying grass fed beef to doing laundy more regularly.  If someone would like<br/>
to expound the virtues of grass fed beef- I might be inspired and it might<br/>
get moved higher on my list of priorities, and maybe make some positive<br/>
steps - but I dont think I can buy the gf beef all the time. you know?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
<br/>
Diapers are about you doing something to the kid when you think you should<br/>
(school)<br/>
<br/>
EC is about you supporting and helping when needed (unschooling)<br/>
<br/>
