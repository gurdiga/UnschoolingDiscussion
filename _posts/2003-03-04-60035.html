FIRST the mom has to figure out how to be happy now.<br/>
<br/>
Not happy when the house is clean.  Happy without the house being clean.<br/>
<br/>
The mom has to find joy in being a mom.  Maybe she could end up living in a <br/>
tent (with a dirt floor!) and would she still be happy?  Maybe she will break <br/>
her leg and live on the couch for a month and a half.  It can happen.  Will <br/>
she still be a mom who&#39;s joyful to see her children?  Or will she have to be <br/>
miserable until she can wax her floor?<br/>
<br/>
I never birthed a linoleum floor, nor the wood one in Holly&#39;s room, nor the <br/>
tile in Marty&#39;s room, nor the carpet in Kirby&#39;s.    But Holly, Marty and <br/>
Kirby are mine to keep safe and well and happy.   They need a happy mom more <br/>
than they need a floor they could eat off of.<br/>

This is pretty applicable.  If what&#39;s below is messy, it&#39;s at<br/>

REJECTING A PRE-PACKAGED LIFE<br/>
by Sandra Dodd <br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
How many things do you do because you&#39;re supposed to, because your relatives <br/>
and neighbors expect it, because it&#39;s easy and you don&#39;t have to think about <br/>
it? How many of those things are taking you and your kids in a positive and <br/>
healthy direction?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Changing paradigms&quot; is an option! If you&#39;re operating on oneferently. It&#39;s <br/>
just thinking. It won&#39;t hurt you.<br/>
Is school the center of children&#39;s lives? Should it be?<br/>
<br/>
Is the only acceptable goal of adult life having the most expensive house and <br/>
furniture credit will buy?<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take much of a shift to consider house and education secondary <br/>
instead of primary. What might be primary then? Health? Joy? Togetherness and <br/>
love? <br/>
<br/>
Part of the pre-packaged life Americans are issued is the idea that happiness <br/>
comes after college, after home ownership, after the new car. The stick that <br/>
holds that carrot will not bend. If happiness depends on performance and <br/>
acquisition, how long will it last? How long is your car the newest on your <br/>
street before unhappiness returns?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a little paradigm shift for you to practice on. Perhaps happiness <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be the primary goal. Try joy. Try the idea that it might be <br/>
enJOYable to cook, to set the table, to see your family, rather than the idea <br/>
that you&#39;ll be happy after dinner&#39;s done and cleaned up. My guess is that <br/>
such happiness might last a couple of seconds before you look around and see <br/>
something else between you and happiness. Joy, though, can be ongoing, and <br/>
can be felt before, during and after the meeting of goals. <br/>
<br/>
Enjoyment--that word itself is hardly used. Enjoyment is seen nearly as a sin <br/>
for some people. &quot;You&#39;re not here to have fun, you&#39;re here to work.&quot; Why <br/>
can&#39;t work bring joy? Any tiny moment can be enjoyed: the feel of warm <br/>
running water when you wash your hands; light and shadow on the floor; <br/>
pictures in the clouds; the feel of an old book. If you see an old friend <br/>
that can bring pure, tingly joy for which there are no words.<br/>
<br/>
If you practice noticing and experiencing joy, if you take a second out of <br/>
each hour to find joy, your life improves with each remembrance of your new <br/>
primary goal. You don&#39;t need someone else to give you permission, or to <br/>
decide whether or not what you thought gave you joy was an acceptable source <br/>
of enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
Can learning be fun? If it&#39;s not fun, it won&#39;t stick. Can laundry be fun? If <br/>
you have to do laundry and you choose NOT to enjoy it, an hour or more of <br/>
your precious hours on earth have been wasted. Can looking at your child <br/>
bring you joy even when he needs a bath and has lost a shoe and hasn&#39;t lived <br/>
up to some expectation that only exists in your mind? If not, a paradigm <br/>
shift could help you both.<br/>
<br/>
Your life is yours, and it is being lived even as you read this. Do not wait <br/>
for approval. Do not wait for instructions, or for a proctor to say &quot;Open <br/>
your lifebook now and write.&quot; Have all the joy you want, and help your <br/>
children, neighbors and relatives find some too. Joy doesn&#39;t cost anything <br/>
but some reuseable thought and awareness. Tell your kids it&#39;s recyclable. <br/>
They&#39;ll love that!</div>
