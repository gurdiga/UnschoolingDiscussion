Yesterday I painted a magnetic wall. Actually it is paint with metal particles in it to make magnet sticks to the wall.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I could get some ideas of how to make use of the magnets.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestion?<br/>
<br/>
Before this wall, I had nothing in the house I can put magnets on, so I haven&#39;t looked around magnets.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear your cool ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191715148">We used to keep a marble run on the fridge. That thing got tons of use by my son and his cousins (once they were past the &quot;putting marbles in the mouth&quot; phase). <br/>

If this hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet, you can buy magentic tape at craft stores, and probably Walmart in the craft section, and adhere it to all kinds of stuff. We&#39;ve made Perler bead designs (Perler beads are those plastic beads you melt using an iron) and put magnetic tape on the back and use them for fridge magnets. You can put it on the backs of photos or cards (I&#39;m thinking of Pokemon cards and things like that). Pretty much anything that is sturdy enough to hold the magnetic tape, you can stick it to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169023359">Our experience with our painted magnetic wall, is that it won&#39;t hold very heavy magnets.  My husband put 8 coats of it on our wall, thinking that the more the better, but not so.  It will hold the Magnetic Poetry style of magnets (light and thin) and also the plastic letter ones.  It will hold our Magformers, as those have neodymium magnets in them (the strongest magnets in the world), and those are cool for making 1 dimensional designs on a flat surface.  I&#39;ve also seen Magna-Tiles that look like they would be light enought to stick to the painted magnetic wall.  <br/>
<br/>
We are planning to cover an entire wall in our basement with a sheet of metal, as we&#39;ve seen lots of cool (heavy) magnetic toys at our local children&#39;s museum.  We wanted to make our own ball run using pvc pipe and strong magnets. <br/>
<br/>
I would be interested to hear if you find any cool magnetic toys that are compatible with the painted wall.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767782441">I like magnetic poetry. I didnʻt so much expect my daughter to use it,  <br/>
as much as I had fun making sentences and poems myself that she could  <br/>
see. You could get the bigger ones, too, so there wouldnʻt be as much  <br/>
likelihood of the kids swallowing the little ones. If your kids are  <br/>
&quot;mouthy&quot; (putting stuff in their mouths a lot), you might want to keep  <br/>
the small stuff up high where they can see them but not reach them  <br/>
until that stage has passed.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.magneticpoetry.com/">http://www.magneticpoetry.com/</a>   (I rather like the Color Words,  <br/>
myself &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Make some magnets, with clear glass disks and stick-on magnets. You  <br/>
can paint the bottom of the disk in a pattern so it shows through when  <br/>
itʻs on the wall. Or make this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://crafts.kaboose.com/ladybugmagnet.htm">http://crafts.kaboose.com/ladybugmagnet.htm</a> <br/>
l<br/>
<br/>
Use the big letters and numbers that people usually put on  <br/>
refrigerators - you can get them just about anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Use it for sticking up notes to yourself! And photos!<br/>

I have painted three coats. So far I can put some lightweight magnets on the wall. Melissa & Doug Deluxe Magnetic Responsibility magnets can stick to the wall.<br/>

I ordered more magnets and will report once they arrive.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, Sandra. I also bought the chalkboard paint but didn&#39;t paint. I was concerned of the powder from the chalk. I don&#39;t know if the powder is a problem or not. Last time when I used the chalk board was more than twenty years ago. Will the powder from the chalk be all over the carpet?<br/>

**We did that, and it is very cool. <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s true that not all magnets stick well to the magnetic paint, even<br/>
using a few layers of it. (Or at least it&#39;s true of the magnetic paint<br/>
we used - it&#39;s been 6 or 7 years, so they may have improved it since<br/>
then.) We&#39;ve found plenty of magnets that do stick, though. The flat<br/>
ones work best for us. We have magnetic words and tangrams and letters,<br/>
and those are all fun.<br/>
