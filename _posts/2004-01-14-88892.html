<br/>
True.  While it&#39;s commendable that the younger children are sometimes letting <br/>
the babies&#39; needs come first, they would have BEEN the babies.<br/>
<br/>
I know a mom with nine children of her own, ranging from two to 20 or so.   <br/>
She and her husband were from families of 10 and 12, so they have lots of <br/>
experience with big families, and many of the people in their church have such <br/>
large families too.  <br/>
<br/>
One is too many for some people.  Twelve can work for some people.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anyone who couldn&#39;t find her limit at some point.  And <br/>
there will ALWAYS be needy children in the world.  Always have been, and <br/>
always will be, and if I adopted thirty children there would still be hundreds of <br/>
thousands more.<br/>
<br/>
I understand entirely my mother&#39;s desire to take her sister&#39;s children to <br/>
raise.  Some of it was selfless, some was selfish.  She wasn&#39;t always as nice to <br/>
them as she would have liked to have thought she was.  My sister and I <br/>
&quot;learned&quot; to share our lives equally with them.  My mom earned many points within her <br/>
family that she NEEDED, because she was trying to prove she was better and <br/>
brighter than some of the others.   Alcoholism was the problem with my aunt, and <br/>
became the problem with my mother too.  <br/>
<br/>
But none of that applies to the other family I cited, a homeschooling family <br/>
my kids used to hang out with.  (I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re still homeschooling; <br/>
we lost touch.)   The mom LOVED saying she had little Korean.&quot;   It was a <br/>
little too much like a doll collection and of such intense interest to the mom <br/>
that I used to try to spend special time and attention on her biological <br/>
daughter, who would have been two of two, and the youngest, but was now deeply buried <br/>
in the middle of five, with an older sister and two younger brothers.   Her <br/>
biological brother was still the oldest, but oldest of five, one of three boys, <br/>
and not very special.  He was expected to help the little boys get dressed and <br/>
help them eat and help them play and help them everything.  Yet he wasn&#39;t the <br/>
one who wanted more children.   <br/>
<br/>
Someone could say &quot;Well you obviously have personally issues.&quot;<br/>
Yeah, that&#39;s one way to minimize what I would call &quot;actual experience.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My point at first and now was that if an oldest child with or without a <br/>
diagnosis of some frustration-producing &quot;disorder&quot; seems frustrated and the mom <br/>
doesn&#39;t have time to soothe and calm him, the fact of the mom&#39;s lack of time IS a <br/>
factor and should be considered a factor.<br/>
<br/>
It might be nice if he could just be TOLD to buck up and get over it, but <br/>
he&#39;s a kid with real kid needs.  He could be drugged, but when the drugs wear off <br/>
will he be in a smaller family with a happier mom?<br/>
<br/>
When parents decide kids&#39; feelings aren&#39;t justified or aren&#39;t &quot;okay,&quot; that&#39;s <br/>
the beginning of the end of their relationship with that child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938207141">&lt;lol&gt; Now, when the war in Afghanistan broke out, I had 3 under 6, and my girls thought that we should adopt ALL of the Afghani children who were left without parents. Must admit, they made me feel good talking about how those kids needed a family like ours. <br/>
<br/>
Remember when Bush called on American children to send a dollar to the White House? Well, we were watching the presidential addresses as a family, so this was a big topic around here.<br/>

  I would love to have more children.  I called to talk to the state about<br/>
  being a foster parent and while I was on the telephone Adriane came in,<br/>
  oldest of 5.  She asked who I was talking to and I told her.  She screeches<br/>

My post glitched.   I think I can reconstruct.<br/>
<br/>
It should have said <br/>
&quot;The mom LOVED saying she had five kids, but she would refer to them oddly.  <br/>
She would say &quot;My little Russian boy&quot; and &quot;my little Korean&quot; instead of using <br/>
their names, way too often.   <br/>
