 <br/>
I know who he is, and based on past conversations with him, I&#39;d guess he<br/>
means that he teaches the kids math, and requires that they write in a<br/>
journal, but he still thinks he&#39;s unschooling.  From what I remember<br/>
he&#39;s big on &#39;learning opportunities&#39; and &#39;teachable moments&#39;.  Wasn&#39;t he<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384776944">That essay upsets me,  <br/>
 <br/>
to me that sounds like an ecclectic style of homeschool.   Maybe some unschoolers do this, but in my book it isn&#39;t unschooling.      If essays like that are at the unschooling web site it really explains why people are having a hard time defining unschooling.<br/>
 <br/>
Then I also wonder if there are different levels of unschooling.  I didn&#39;t think so.     Are there purist unschoolers or radical unschoolers and are there somewhat unschoolers or almost unschoolers?           Then I guess we can ask how effective will unschooling be if it is more of an ecclectic style or not complete unschooling in practice?<br/>
 <br/>
I guess I&#39;m probably just a purist in alot of ways and it comes into conflict alot of the time.<br/>
 <br/>
Just some comments and questions.<br/>

I agree. My understanding of it is in order to use the label for<br/>
yourself of Unschooling, it is an all the way proposition. An analogy -<br/>
a recovering alcoholic can&#39;t say they are &quot;sober except for having a<br/>
glass of beer with dinner on Saturdays&quot;. This person is not &quot;sober&quot;.<br/>
Someone outside of the recovery community might say, &quot;that&#39;s nothing&quot;,<br/>
but it makes a huge difference to the other members of AA. If you are<br/>
unschooling except for &quot;requiring&quot; a journal - that is an oxymoron. That<br/>
person is not Unschooling in the way we understand it here. Although to<br/>
someone doing school-at-home or in the school system it would seem like<br/>
nothing. I would define that person as Eclectic, and possibly still on<br/>
the journey towards unschooling. I was going to suggest Relaxed, but the<br/>
idea of such a requirement sounds like a great tension inducer in the<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, it also sounds like a terrific way of turning a budding writer off<br/>
journalizing!<br/>

However, it is confusing to hear that we should read unschooling.com to<br/>
learn about unschooling, then read there that &quot;of course we require ... and<br/>
do math...&quot;.  It implies that unschooling can mean &quot;everything but math and<br/>
writing&quot; and still be unschooling, and this is from a source that is said to<br/>
present real unschooling.  Maybe there should be a disclaimer about the<br/>
article not representing true unschooling...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1027865081">Sandra, <br/>
<br/>
I agree with you.  I was about to post a similar comment but very frequently <br/>
on this list is seems as if people&#39;s minds are somewhat closed.  Ok, now <br/>
don&#39;t everyone attack at once...but...<br/>
<br/>
The unassisted childbirth list I am on can tend to be that way too at times <br/>
about how women &quot;ought&quot; to birth unassisted and if you have a midwife present <br/>
or even the father, then it isn&#39;t truely an unassisted birth.  Well to me, <br/>
that is crazy.  And everything can be taken to the extreme.  <br/>
<br/>
As I have said on the UC board, I will say here.  It would benefit the <br/>
old-timers who perhaps are all for complete, pure unschooling to help those <br/>
of us who are new to this concept come to it in a gentle way which is of <br/>
course a process.  And who is to say what unschooling is or isn&#39;t.  In our <br/>
society we don&#39;t naturally think unschooling is the way to go, just as we are <br/>
trained to think we need OBs to have babies. <br/>
<br/>
I feel for now if my children and I can work together towards some sort of <br/>
process that satisfies us both and allows them to grow into adults who can <br/>
function in our society and &quot;unschooling&quot; is the way to do it, then I think <br/>
that is great.  But I don&#39;t want anyone else to define what unschooling ought <br/>
to be for us-nor do I think that should be done to any person considering <br/>
this as an option.  That is a process only each family can come to on their <br/>
own.  <br/>
<br/>
So in closing I think offering advice for what worked for each of us and how <br/>
we got to where we are in our journey would be a much more helpful route than <br/>
to say &quot;Oh you aren&#39;t unschooling properly if you are doing this and such or <br/>
not doing this or that&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
just my 2 cents...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, to use your example . . . A lot of women do the regular hospital birth<br/>
with their first, maybe with a midwife in attendance.  For the next one,<br/>
they might do a homebirth with a midwife.  But to go the last distance, as<br/>
my daughter recently did with her third, requires a mind-shift.  You can&#39;t<br/>
do it successfully if you&#39;re worried about all the possibilities.  In fact,<br/>
the worry itself can actually cause a labour to slow down or stop, and could<br/>
produce those very possibilities that the mother was worried about..<br/>
<br/>
I think people can come to unschooling in a similar way, but where would you<br/>
say that they were really unschooling?  Personally, I would say it isn&#39;t<br/>
until they experience that mind-shift, the one that really gives them<br/>
confidence that helping their children to grow into who they really are will<br/>
also let them acquire the education that&#39;s exactly right for them.  The mind<br/>
set that isn&#39;t looking for learning to look like school.  That&#39;s why I don&#39;t<br/>
call it unschooling when certain academic requirements exist for the kids.<br/>
It&#39;s great if the parents are relaxing those requirements, but it isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882057302">----- snip----- And who is to say what unschooling is or isn&#39;t.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I come to unschooling.com seeking information, than I DO want to know<br/>
what unschooling is and isn&#39;t.  Perhaps there is no distinct, absolute<br/>
definition(??), but I think having some defining characteristics will be<br/>
more helpful than not.  I don&#39;t think people should be offended if they are<br/>
told that what they are doing is not unschooling, if unschooling is what<br/>
they *want* to be doing.  Of course we each need to find our own way within<br/>
our own family.  There are too many human variables for someone to say that<br/>
all parents must do XYZ exactly the same way.  But that doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
unschooling is replicating a school in your home.  If I think that I am<br/>
unschooling, while &quot;of course requiring&quot; and that is not really the essence<br/>
of unschooling, I would rather someone tell me that.  Defining unschooling<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that I must unschool.  I am still free to do what I think is<br/>
best for my children.  But I shouldn&#39;t say we unschool if we really don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That is why the wording in that essay bothered me.  I understood that<br/>
unschooling means the parent doesn&#39;t require any &quot;school work&quot; of their<br/>
children.  Then I read the essay at unschooling.com that claims &quot;of course<br/>
we require&quot; [journal keeping and kitchen table math].  The &quot;of course we<br/>
require&quot; implies that unschooling means the parent needs to make the child<br/>
do some academic work.  Is that unschooling or isn&#39;t it?  And if it isn&#39;t,<br/>
than the essay shouldn&#39;t be at unschooling.com or it should have a<br/>
disclaimer explaining that some of the content is not from an exclusive<br/>
unschooling viewpoint.<br/>
<br/>
I worked with La Leche League for many years.  I never told anybody that<br/>
100% exclusive breastfeeding was what *they should* do.  But if someone<br/>
asked for information about breastfeeding, I would be doing them a<br/>
disservice if I said that breastfeeding works great even if you use formula<br/>
whenever it &quot;works for your family&quot;.  It doesn&#39;t mean that someone is right<br/>
or wrong to use formula, but it does mean that baby/mother pair will not<br/>
receive the same results and benefits as they would if they exclusively<br/>
breastfed.  The mother should then realize that she combines breastfeeding<br/>
with formula; she is not exclusively breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe we need partial unschooling and complete unschooling?  Is that<br/>
possible?<br/>
<br/>
Here is what I think some are saying about unschooling - that we need to<br/>
trust our children in everything, not trust them in everything but math, or<br/>
everything but feeding themselves, for instance.  It doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
children are left totally to their own devices either.  Parents provide an<br/>
environment that includes math/food/etc., and are available to guide and<br/>
assist their children in using math/food/etc., and trust that children will<br/>
use math/food/etc., as they need to without the parent requiring it of them.<br/>
Going beyond that, arithmetic and food are things that we use to accomplish<br/>
our goals in life, but they are not the end goals by themselves.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes and people *can* practice non-coercive parenting and respectful<br/>
attitudes towards their children, even when they are enrolled in public<br/>
school. It is just a question of the naming. I could have used the<br/>
analogy that a group of vegans might not consider someone who described<br/>
themselves as &quot;a vegan except for chocolate milkshakes&quot; a &quot;Vegan&quot;,<br/>
although that would be a perfectly valid dietary choice. <br/>
<br/>
Following this food analogy, it was not until I became a vegetarian<br/>
about 15 years ago, that I realized how much meat I ate on a daily<br/>
basis, always believing that I ate very little. Friends would always<br/>
say, on hearing of my conversion, &quot;Oh I don&#39;t eat much meat&quot;, evidently<br/>
operating under same belief I had entertained (and feeling defensive,<br/>
but that&#39;s another issue). Perhaps it is not until people renounce the<br/>
control and &quot;requirements&quot; that they realize how much these attitudes<br/>
affect their relationships with their children. Others have said this<br/>
kind of thing better before. <br/>
<br/>
From the replies, I don&#39;t think there is any disagreement here on the<br/>
original question, which was whether &quot;requiring a journal&quot; could<br/>
accurately be called unschooling in any universe. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How important is the name? Well, I&#39;m feeling lonely in my local support<br/>
group/e-list at the moment, since there are no other unschoolers there<br/>
anymore. One person on our list talked about how they have been almost<br/>
unschooling and she doesn&#39;t feel comfortable with that. I have yet to<br/>
see her to ask her about it. Another has recently asked how to make her<br/>
son write reports. A proud former Middle School English teacher sent a<br/>
multipage treatise on how to write school reports properly step by step,<br/>
to be greeted with acclaim, and the one lone voice who suggested that<br/>
maybe he didn&#39;t need to write reports right now was vilified as being<br/>
unhelpful. We have a lot of Unit Studies proponents in the group. One<br/>
parent was worried about math with her reluctant son, expressing how her<br/>
fears were causing tension in their relationship - I suggested with<br/>
utmost gentleness that there might be some helpful information at<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site - to help her feel less stressed about doing it NOW and<br/>
not &quot;falling behind&quot;. It was not well taken. <br/>
<br/>
Yet these parents are so much more pleasant to be around than &quot;regular&quot;<br/>
schooling parents, who mediate every interaction their kids have with<br/>
others, constantly yell &quot;be careful&quot; and &quot;YOU MUST SHARE&quot; etc. and whose<br/>
conversation is totally about getting their children to do their<br/>
homework. :-(  The primary purpose of going to our weekly Park Day is<br/>
for our children to have fun and enhance their relationships with each<br/>
other, for which purpose we avoid parks that are well attended by other<br/>
groups, nannies and preschools. Still I don&#39;t feel safe enough to &quot;come<br/>
out&quot; as an unschooler. Since Jayn is three, I don&#39;t know how seriously I<br/>
would be taken anyway. It makes me nervous when I hear about some of the<br/>
other folk on this list who have told us about their kids being shunned.<br/>
Perhaps I have contempt prior to investigation, and what I do will be<br/>
roundly ignored by the others in my group as totally irrelevant to them.<br/>
The fact is I don&#39;t have any other friends with children, except one<br/>
couple who are friends of my dh, and are public schooling spankers of<br/>
their 5 yo. The first question I get asked when I tell regular people I<br/>
am homeschooling is about curriculum. They don&#39;t ask about socialization<br/>
- usually treating me to a lecture on the subject instead!  *sigh* I<br/>
just want Jayn to be able to play with the same few kids regularly and<br/>
sit pleasantly and admire each other&#39;s great kids and their imaginative<br/>
games. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel like I am letting down the side with silence. Recently<br/>
one mother (new to the group) was speaking of the Zero Tolerance for<br/>
hitting policy they have in their home. If their six yo son hits or<br/>
punches he is sent straight to bed until tomorrow, &quot;even if it is 10 in<br/>
the morning&quot;. She was watching a rowdy boys&#39; game unfolding, with great<br/>
apprehension. How can I, as the mother of a 3yo girl, say, &quot;I think your<br/>
policy is well intentioned but dumb; what will it do to your son&#39;s<br/>
ability to express his feelings and feel safe in his home?&quot;, even if<br/>
that is how I feel. I would hardly blame her if she returned &quot;Mind your<br/>
own business!&quot;  She is likely to learn much more by watching the<br/>
beautiful interactions between one mother of four boys and her<br/>
expressive and intelligent sons, who are regulars at Park Day. Oh well.<br/>
At least in my home we are unrestricted and full of the joy of this<br/>
lifestyle.<br/>

&lt;&lt; if you have a midwife present <br/>
or even the father, then it isn&#39;t truely an unassisted birth.  Well to me, <br/>
that is crazy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if the list says &quot;unassisted&quot; means the mom alone, then if a midwife or <br/>
husband is there...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But I don&#39;t want anyone else to define what unschooling ought <br/>
to be for us-nor do I think that should be done to any person considering <br/>
this as an option. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;Okay, that&#39;s unschooling&quot; to everyone who stops telling their <br/>
children when and where to &#39;do their math&#39; or who says &quot;you have to read <br/>
every day, but you can choose the book,&quot; then how CAN they consider as an <br/>
option the idea that kids can and will learn to do math and will read if you <br/>
don&#39;t make them do it?<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;Good job!&quot; about everything, good or bad, there will be no pure <br/>
unschooling,<br/>
<br/>
If everything short of a cesarean is called an unassisted birth, then there <br/>
will probably be no one willing to even consider a totally unassisted homebirt<br/>
h.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;That is a process only each family can come to on their own.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not without seeing examples or hearing stories.  <br/>
<br/>
And unless a woman&#39;s going to have twenty babies, she doesn&#39;t have that much <br/>
time to ease into it.  And unless a kid&#39;s going to live at home for thirty <br/>
years, parents don&#39;t have that much time to decide to stop making them do <br/>
schoolwork to see how natural learning can blossom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So in closing I think offering advice for what worked for each of us and <br/>
how <br/>
we got to where we are in our journey would be a much more helpful route than <br/>
to say &quot;Oh you aren&#39;t unschooling properly if you are doing this and such or <br/>
not doing this or that&quot;....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That sounds really good all by itself.<br/>
<br/>
But if this list (or any unschooling source) affirms the anecdotes of each <br/>
person who shows up here and says &quot;Sounds great!&quot; to a ton of controlling <br/>
rules and &quot;Sounds great!&quot; to actual experience unschoolers the same way, then <br/>
those who are just coming by for a day or a week to see what they can pick up <br/>
on the fly will have no idea what unschooling might be.  And those who stay a <br/>
month might be paying as much attention to someone who just got here, who <br/>
tests her kids every six months, who just took them out of school, who has a <br/>
curriculum in the closet just waiting for the moment it looks like this <br/>
unschooling experiment isn&#39;t going to work (not knowing the difference) as <br/>
she pays to someone who honestly walked away from school and schooling <br/>
fifteen years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I like to assume that people who have finally come looking for unschoolnig <br/>
actually want to see what it is, not just to maybe hear a bit or two if they <br/>
stick around long enough to winnow through the stories on their own, <br/>
gradually, to decide whether they want to call relaxed or eclectic <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; and then never have to see the full range of possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so easy to say &quot;Let&#39;s just tell our stories occasionally and let <br/>
people decide what they want to do in their own time&quot; *and* to provide <br/>
unschooling information today.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, sounds like you are making the best of a dismal situation. One <br/>
suggestion I&#39;d have, based on something that worked for a friend of <br/>
mine when she moved to a new (smaller) town was that she went to the <br/>
local health food store or co-op (which, I think, was quite a ways <br/>
away) and posted a sign about finding other attachment <br/>
parents/unschoolers. To her surprise, she did get a couple of phone <br/>
calls. Neither of the people lived right next door, but they were <br/>
within distance to be able to get together a few times a month. It <br/>
made a big difference for her to find people who were at least in the <br/>
same book as her, if not on exactly the same page. <br/>
Another place I&#39;d check is La Leche League, if your 3 y.o. is <br/>
nursing. Many of the more radical moms I&#39;ve met have matriculated up <br/>
through LLL. And no, I&#39;m not even a member, just saying that&#39;s one <br/>
other place to look.<br/>
I do find, though, that the strangest thing occurs to even most of my <br/>
more radical mommy friends, online and real life. Even moms who have <br/>
homebirthed, cloth diapered, attachment parented, and nursed into <br/>
preschool age or beyond suddenly turn conventional when it comes to <br/>
schooling and just put their radically parented children straight <br/>
into the gaping maw of the school system. I don&#39;t understand it. It&#39;s <br/>
like homeschooling, let alone unschooling, is the last bastion that <br/>
most of the even quite radical don&#39;t cross. I mean, I know moms who <br/>
have had unassisted lotus births who end up sending their kids on the <br/>
bus to kindy when the time comes. It&#39;s baffling. I&#39;m not saying that <br/>
attachment parenting or homebirthing is the only path to unschooling, <br/>
just that it&#39;s strange how people on an alternative path can suddenly <br/>
swerve back to the straight and narrow when it comes to school.<br/>
It can make it a lonely world for unschoolers. Hang in there. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Gosh! I sure didn&#39;t mean it to sound dismal, or a bad situation. I&#39;m<br/>
just having a crisis in my personal courage level right now. Also I am<br/>
so excited by what unschooling has given me already with Jayn, it makes<br/>
it hard for me to hear other people rejecting it. I have learnt a lot<br/>
from the women in my group, and they are kind and loving parents all<br/>
around. I don&#39;t want to be told how to parent or criticized, so I don&#39;t<br/>
want to make unsolicited suggestions to others. I don&#39;t see it as my<br/>
place to spread the word, beyond my general actions and the way I<br/>
interact with Jayn. Thanks for your concern and caring, though.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I do find, though, that the strangest thing occurs to even most of my <br/>
more radical mommy friends, online and real life.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. when my friend&#39;s girl was a baby she was all about no spanking.<br/>
Now her father spanks her, and they &quot;use time-outs&quot; and that awful<br/>
counting thing. I have seen the girl go from giggling to wary fear in an<br/>
instant. Then she starts twirling her hair, and they instantly exclaim<br/>
&quot;oh she&#39;s tired&quot;. Yeah right - what she is is stressed. Of course being<br/>
tired and not wanting to stop is another kind of stress, but I think the<br/>
twirling followed a little too close to being threatened for it to be<br/>
unconnected. The look on Jayn&#39;s face when this was going on.<br/>
<br/>
We were planning to all go away for a road trip but I said I couldn&#39;t<br/>
because the stress level for me during our time together was too high.<br/>
Also I don&#39;t want Jayn exposed to that cruelty.<br/>

&gt; own.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it sounds good in theory. It&#39;s very gentle and accepting of where<br/>
people are and their ability to find what works for them and their families.<br/>
<br/>
But the list is *not* a list to help people find what works for their<br/>
families. It&#39;s unschooling. And unschooling *is* a specific philosophy with<br/>
goals that are different from any other form of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps to look at the advice *not* as what you *should* do but<br/>
*what* to shoot for and *how* to shoot for it *if* you want to be an<br/>
unschooler. (I don&#39;t think anyone here feels they&#39;ve reached the goal. We<br/>
*all* need to keep working towards it.) If someone wants to modify the goal<br/>
for their own family, then they can pick and choose what sounds good to them<br/>
and reject the rest. But the pickers and choosers need to respect that their<br/>
needs getting to their goal shouldn&#39;t interfere with others getting to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When people sign onto the list they are in essence saying they want to<br/>
figure out how to get to that goal called unschooling. So *not* telling<br/>
people when they get off the path would not be helpful to them.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re doing is like dicussing vegetarianism. People who join the list<br/>
don&#39;t need to become vegetarians. They could pick and choose the advice and<br/>
modify it to eat less meat. But they need to respect that the list is for<br/>
people who *are* trying to do something very specific.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;Wait, I don&#39;t like that advice. That&#39;s too radical for my<br/>
needs because I don&#39;t like beans so I need you to help me incorporate ground<br/>
beef *not* tell me how to avoid it,&quot; or &quot;I like vegetarianism but I worry<br/>
about getting enough protein so I always mix in some chicken to make sure I<br/>
get enough protein,&quot; then they&#39;re interfering with those who want to go the<br/>
whole way.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s even more difficult for unschoolers. Society has filled us chock full<br/>
of fears. It is *very* easy to fall back on standard methods that ease those<br/>
fears. But finding ways to ease fears isn&#39;t what the list is about. It isn&#39;t<br/>
about finding our comfort zone on the path to unschooling. It isn&#39;t about<br/>
finding what works for our families. It&#39;s about finding out how to get from<br/>
where we are to where we want to go. For most people getting where they&#39;re<br/>
determined to go means spending a fair amount of time in a *discomfort*<br/>
zone.<br/>
<br/>
The people who will get the most from this list are the ones who want to get<br/>
where the list is helping people get to. It would *not* be helpful to get on<br/>
a list headed for New York City if you want to go to Miami ;-) But if<br/>
someone wants one of the stops along the way or want the general direction,<br/>
the list can be useful. Then additional lists might help them with the<br/>
specifics of the place they want to stop at.<br/>
<br/>
It could be this list isn&#39;t going to meet your needs. It *can&#39;t* expand to<br/>
be about what works for each family because then it would cease to be about<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

want to be here.  They enjoy playing with other children of all ages.  The <br/>
children don&#39;t talk about the curriculum they use.  <br/>
<br/>
I always bring my crocheting.  They know I am an unschooler and therefore do <br/>
not ask me any questions about curriculum.  They usually do talk about it at <br/>
every play day though.  LOL.  But they do find me the oddity, as we talked <br/>
about a week or so ago.  And will ask me how I get me boys to learn, how do I <br/>
deal with math, what my day looks like.  Not that they intend to go home and <br/>
try it but at each play day I have the opportunity to tell them how we do <br/>
things. I try not to seem preachy and just offer some short simple answers <br/>
without getting too deep into my philosophy. And I have noticed that a couple <br/>
of the mothers are leaning towards a more relaxed atmosphere.  I just feel <br/>
good that I may be offering an alternative, so that some of the &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot; mothers might see that it doesn&#39;t necessarily have to be so structured. <br/>
 There are in-betweens.  <br/>

or relaxed or whatever term may best fit my style of parenting and <br/>
homeschooling.. No one term is better or worse in my opinion.  I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
called a &#39;school at home&quot; person, because, I don&#39;t do school at home.    I&#39;ve <br/>
said before, that I find labels restrictive and  I dont feel I fit any one <br/>
&#39;way&quot; of doing things.   It doesnt&#39; offend me that folks here may say. OH <br/>
OH.. your not a REAL TRUE unschooler.   Just like Im not offended if folks <br/>
say. OH, your not a real true Christian because I dont subscribe to their <br/>
fundamental beliefs 100% ( or heck, even 50%).   I stay around this group <br/>
because its active, there are lots of GOOD advice here, and I have made some <br/>
friends.  For unschooling information, ( which is what I look for, even if <br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;there&quot; yet) this group has consistently been the best source I have <br/>
found.  Thats why I hang around here.   Folks can call me eclectic or relaxed <br/>
or &quot;unschooling modified&quot;  LOL.. ( although, I dont INTEND to modify <br/>
unschooling in my home.. its just Im lower on the continum and still <br/>
learning).. I know Ive been called much worse :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Pam,<br/>
As a label-free homeschooler, I think I&#39;m closer to unschooling than <br/>
anything else.  I don&#39;t call myself any kind of homeschooler, and <br/>
when people press me for an answer, I just say we make it up as we go <br/>
along.  So, I can see why some homeschoolers might call themselves <br/>
unschoolers, although according to the definition on Yahoo website <br/>
they haven&#39;t reached that nirvana yet.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think because in some areas unschooling is used for what we&#39;d call<br/>
eclectic and relaxed. Probably in heavy curriculum areas anyone not doing<br/>
curriculum looks like an &quot;unschooler&quot;. So some homeschoolers self-identify<br/>
with the local use of the word unschooling. Then they come here and find a<br/>
bunch of people who tell them they aren&#39;t unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me it would be like self-identifing yourself as Polish only to join<br/>
a Polish group who said you weren&#39;t really Polish because you didn&#39;t speak<br/>
the language or didn&#39;t have 3 Polish grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure the definition of unschooling here seems just as arbitrary as that<br/>
definition of Polish. In their minds who&#39;s to say we&#39;re right and the local<br/>
people using unschooling the way they understand it are wrong? Especially if<br/>
someone doesn&#39;t know that unschooling is a specific philosophy and not just<br/>
a general term that crept into the language to identify noncuriculum users.<br/>
Especially if homeschooling information comes by word of mouth and what<br/>
people can stumble across. I don&#39;t know how anyone homeschools without the<br/>
internet but they do.<br/>

Some of us are raising various sorts of high-maintenance kids, and <br/>
they sometimes do need external structure because they aren&#39;t always <br/>
(and some of them never!) able to provide it for themselves. Some <br/>
kids need to be held and redirected in order to read an entire book <br/>

obsessing on a single topic from waking to sleep. Some kids need to <br/>
be taught, step by step, year after year, how to make the simplest <br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone with an autistic child, for example, knows that radical <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t an option.<br/>
<br/>
I half-jokingly call us &quot;Eclectic Semi-Unschoolers&quot;. Sure, <br/>
unschooling is a goal. But fact is, folks, that not all of us are <br/>
gonna get there.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling mail lists give me the willies. I&#39;ve got them set <br/>
for &quot;nomail&quot;, so I don&#39;t accidentially open some letter of <br/>
condemnation, where somebody gets trounced, politely or otherwise, <br/>
for not doing it &quot;the right way&quot;.  I&#39;m sure I miss a lot of tips and <br/>
ideas that I might be able to incorporate into my family&#39;s ways of <br/>
living and learning. But some days I&#39;m just too stressed to have any <br/>
tolerance toward the fanatical preachers of the Absolute Revealed <br/>
Truth of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what that does, folks? It loses more people than it converts. <br/>

<br/>
My 8 year old is autistic.  Radical unschooling would not work for him either, especially in math.  My son has no concept of numbers at all, at least not without some form of manipulative.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has seen the move Rain Man, they&#39;d understand!  Where Raymond is able to count how many toothpicks fell on the floor, but a candy bar is, &quot;About a hundred dollars.&quot;  That&#39;s my son.  8 means the same to him as 800.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, if he has 800 Lego blocks in front of him, and another pile with 8 Lego blocks, he can grasp the concept that it&#39;s bigger than the other and by how much.<br/>
<br/>
So I do use Math-U-See with him.<br/>
<br/>
Other than this program, we&#39;re unschooling.  I prefer the term Electic or Child-Led Home Educator (LOL...fit THAT on T-Shirt!) because the term unschooling doesn&#39;t truly describe us.<br/>

But I question whether they need to read an entire book or page.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Some kids need lists of things to do to keep them from <br/>
obsessing on a single topic from waking to sleep.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some parents are sure their lists of things are more important than kids&#39; <br/>
obsessions.  I&#39;m personally not that way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyone with an autistic child, for example, knows that radical <br/>
unschooling isn&#39;t an option.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That may be, then, for that family it won&#39;t work.  But if we let every <br/>
exception become a part of the definition, then there&#39;s not likely to be any <br/>
pure unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I&#39;m sure I miss a lot of tips and <br/>
ideas that I might be able to incorporate into my family&#39;s ways of <br/>
living and learning. But some days I&#39;m just too stressed to have any <br/>

<br/>
But the stress is in your life, not in our advice.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Guess what that does, folks? It loses more people than it converts. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a church, and we&#39;re not passing the plate for the building fund, so <br/>
we&#39;re not after numbers.   Anyone who doesn&#39;t want it or can&#39;t use it can <br/>
SURELY find other homeschooling advice.<br/>
<br/>
My comment wasn&#39;t a recommendation that we tone down this list, but that we <br/>
acknowledge that other people other places are going to use the word <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; in ways we don&#39;t like and we can&#39;t stop them.<br/>
