&lt;&lt; My kids have Christian friends they make allowances for when the&#39;re <br/>
visiting. <br/>
 We&#39;re not anti-Christian.  I&#39;m personally anti anti-child people.  I have no <br/>
patience or  understanding for people who intend to break children&#39;s spirits. <br/>
 Some of those spirits stay broken for life, and it&#39;s hard for me to be <br/>
hopeful about my whole kids having to go out and deal with broken-spirited <br/>
people <br/>
who wish their parents had respected them more (but might not realize what <br/>
they <br/>
wish after they learn not to look back at their childhoods).<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday at a thrift store for 49 cents I picked up the November 2002 issue <br/>
of Focus on the Family.   It shows a boy pretending to shave, with shaving <br/>
creme and a comb.  The cover blurb is &quot;Raising Right-Minded Rascals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right away, it seemed disrespectful of boys.  &quot;Rascals&quot; might be a term of <br/>
endearment, but it&#39;s not positive.  The issue was largely an advertisement for a <br/>
series of videos called &quot;Bringing Up Boys.&quot;  It was pro-leadership and <br/>
anti-homosexuality (&quot;Teaching that homosexuality is genetic is one of the biggest <br/>
deceptions taught in schools today.  Two former homosexuals testify of their <br/>
turn from homosexuality and it origins&quot; and one tape is all about the role <br/>
parents have in preventing homosexuality.)   But that&#39;s not what I wanted to bring <br/>
to the list, it&#39;s just the tone of this issue.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a short article, though, called Backing Down Back Talk (&quot;featuring <br/>
Dr. James Dobson,&quot; who is quoted but didn&#39;t write it, and there isn&#39;t an author <br/>
credit).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to quote some.  Were the question put to this list, the answers <br/>
would have been MUCH much different.<br/>
<br/>
======<br/>
<br/>
Kids can say the cutest thins.  but not everything coming out of etheir <br/>
mouths is sugar and spiec.  Sometimes their syllables can sizle. <br/>
<br/>
Check out a scene between a mom and her precocious 7-year-old:<br/>
<br/>
Linda:  Tess, get in here and clear your breaflast dishes.<br/>
<br/>
Tess:  Just  a minute, Mom.  I&#39;m watching television.<br/>
<br/>
Linda:  No, right now.<br/>
<br/>
Tess:  I said, in a minute!<br/>
<br/>
Linda: And I said right now!<br/>
<br/>
Tess:  (stomping into kitchen):  HUMPH!  You&#39;re such a pain, mom.  Why can&#39;t <br/>
you let me do what I want?<br/>
<br/>
Linda:  Because I&#39;m your mom.  It&#39;s my job to help you do the right thing.<br/>
<br/>
Tess:  That&#39;s not a REAL job.  Why can&#39;t you get a job like vicki&#39;s mom?<br/>
<br/>
Linda:  Because I&#39;m YOUR mom.  I&#39;m supposed to make your life miserable.<br/>
<br/>
Tess:  I am miserable.  Thanks to you.<br/>
<br/>
On a scale of one to 10, how d you think Linda handled the situation?  <br/>
(Cheesy game show music.)<br/>
BUZZ!  Got your answer?<br/>
<br/>
Dr.  James Dobson says Linda needs to discourage the disrespectful behavior <br/>
now--before it gets worse.  He might give her a three.<br/>
<br/>
So they&#39;re not recommending it as an ideal conversation, but are they <br/>
suggesting the mother could have been more respectful and patient?  No.   The <br/>
reecommendation is this:<br/>
&quot;By punishing disrepectful talk now, Linda will help squelch battles in the <br/>
teen years before they start.  Added chores, a spanking or being grounded from <br/>
the television may be a good reminder for Tess to treat her mom better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-----------end of quotes-------<br/>
<br/>
I used caps to show where they used italics.<br/>
There was more, about trying to understand a child&#39;s viewpoint and being big <br/>
enough to apologize, and helping them find ways to communicate.  But there was <br/>
NO criticism of a mother saying &quot;get in here and...&quot; or &quot;no, right now.&quot;  The <br/>
mother is assumed right.   &quot;But if you feel your actions were correct, you <br/>
should explain your reaction and what you expect next time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Telling children what you expect, with the threat of &quot;added chores, a <br/>
spanking or being grounded from the television&quot; is not respectful of children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ugh.  Who *begins* a conversation this way?  Even I at my worst have <br/>
never *started* in such a curt, preemptory way.<br/>
<br/>
This is what I&#39;m running from, running toward respect and <br/>
saying, &quot;Could you let me know when you have a break so I can ask you <br/>
something?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Last night, late, Fisher (6) lost a battle in his Pokemon GameCube <br/>
game.  He ended up losing a rare Pokemon because he had forgotten to <br/>
save before the battle.  He cried off and on for two hours (we ended <br/>
up going to bed at 1 a.m.)  I knew he was overtired, and just <br/>
mentioned to him that he might feel better about it in the morning.  <br/>
But instead of insisting that he turn it off or go to bed or stop <br/>
crying or just shut up and play until he got the Pokemon again, I <br/>
waited to see what he wanted to do.  Sometimes I played for him while <br/>
he was waiting to get that Pokemon again, going through some of the <br/>
more repetitive battles.  I brought him snacks to keep his energy <br/>
up.  I rubbed his back and talked to him when he felt like talking -- <br/>
when he was too upset to talk, I backed off.  At one point he was up <br/>
in his room, but I asked if he wanted to keep me company in the <br/>
kitchen while I cleaned up, and he took me up on it.  He showed me a <br/>
lot of the game while we did that.<br/>
<br/>
By the time we went to bed, he was smiling and okay again.  Still <br/>
very disappointed (he never did get that Pokemon back) but I could <br/>
tell he felt like I was on his side, and it helped a lot.<br/>
<br/>
When I think &quot;How can I help Fisher get what he wants?&quot; everything <br/>
about parenting seems to fall into place.  I suppose it&#39;s more work, <br/>
but it&#39;s easier because I know what the work is about and it&#39;s work <br/>
toward a good relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Focus on the Family isn&#39;t going to show me that.  Mothers who don&#39;t <br/>
let their children play with neighborhood kids, ever, aren&#39;t going to <br/>
show me that.  This group has showed me that, and I hope to find <br/>
others in real life to walk that path with me, too.<br/>
<br/>
Ramblin&#39; peace,<br/>
