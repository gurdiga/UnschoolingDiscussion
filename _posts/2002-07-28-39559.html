&quot;In fact, I&#39;m guessing that, by forcing, they actually create <br/>
physiological changes in the brain that make reading more difficult and less <br/>
pleasurable&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have read in a book called Homeschool Burnout by Raymond and Dorothy Moore <br/>
that one of the causes of ADD and ADHD is by forcing kids to read when they <br/>
are not ready. <br/>
<br/>
Also, 80% of athletes in ski racing have so-called &quot;learning disorders&quot;, in <br/>
that they are not in pace with the school system&#39;s &quot;breadline&quot; &quot;ladder&quot; <br/>
learning style.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083358546">when my daughter was still in ps i was told she did things(NO LIE) to slow. <br/>
she is extremely smart and not a behavior problem ever but they said she was <br/>
too slow. so i had her tested for everything under the sun. finally the doc <br/>
came in and told me she had a very high iq and that she just learned things <br/>
in her own time. so i went back to the school and gave them the form they <br/>
made me have filled out and never said anything to me about her intelligence <br/>
only i needed to talk to her and make her work faster. <br/>
  needless to say i din&#39;t have the potion of hsing then and told her to do <br/>
the best she could i would help her at home, the next year the started the <br/>
excellerated reader program. now i was told she was add and i needed to get <br/>
her on med. back to the doctor, she doesn&#39;t have add she just don&#39;t like to <br/>
read. more news the school didn&#39;t want to hear!<br/>
  in third grade she began to have severe problems with her bladder and <br/>
missed alot of school because of this, that&#39;s when the schhool suggested i hs <br/>
her. i guess they didn&#39;t have the patience to work but with one type of <br/>
learner. <br/>
  so last year we were able to bring her home!!!! yeah!! and guess what she <br/>
recently started reading the chroncils of narnia.  the point being force was <br/>
told to me to delay a child&#39;s learning process, that each child can&#39;t fit <br/>
into the mold set by school systems, and making a child do something or hurry <br/>
or di things a certain way can delay what they learn because you&#39;ve told them <br/>
they can&#39;t do it the only way they know how.<br/>
  sorry to ramble but i thought you might like to hear at least 1 medical <br/>
professional does agree that force is the worst way to get a kid to learn.<br/>
