<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917657578">Mothers: A Field Guide<br/>
By Mary Akers Guyton<br/>
<br/>
I have often wondered, during those rare times that I<br/>
manage to go out in public without my children, if I bear some<br/>
distinguishing mark that identifies me as a mother. Surely I must <br/>
exhibit certain characteristics unique to mothers of all ages and <br/>
income levels. <br/>
<br/>
As a bird watcher looks for an unusual crest or listens carefully for <br/>
a specific songbird&#39;s call, could not a mother watcher locate a woman <br/>
with children, even when she did not have her children with her? <br/>
Carrying this one step further, I began to develop a theory that not <br/>
only could one recognize a mother, but like the bird watcher, could <br/>
identify the various stages of motherhood development through careful <br/>
observation. On this premise, I have created a field guide to Mothers <br/>
of North America.<br/>
<br/>
A hatchling mother (birth to six months) will exhibit<br/>
unique characteristics. She may, while standing in line at<br/>
the grocery store, gently bounce a 25-pound sack of potatoes on her <br/>
hip, to keep it entertained. She may, upon hearing someone else&#39;s baby<br/>
cry, quickly cross her arms over her chest to stop the involuntary<br/>
milk let-down reflex. She is likely to have mastered the ability to<br/>
pick up objects with her feet, without interrupting the ritual baby<br/>
dance, perfected in the first six months of motherhood. She will,<br/>
undoubtedly, exhibit the universal signs of new motherhood: dark half <br/>
moons under the eyes, and a spit-up stain down the back of her left <br/>
shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
An examination of her purse contents will reveal baby<br/>
Anbesol, Tylenol, elixir with the eye-dropper top; the pediatrician&#39;s<br/>
office, beeper, and home phone numbers; a two-week-old list of things <br/>
to do (still undone); a few birth announcements that have not yet <br/>
been addressed; and a large bottle of extra-strength Tylenol.<br/>
<br/>
A nestling mother (6 to 12 months) can be picked out<br/>
of a crowd by looking for a woman who double ties her shoes, smells<br/>
faintly of diaper wipes and apple juice, and has one arm much stronger<br/>
than the other. She will jump to catch any falling object seen out of <br/>
the corner of her eye, and will have it in her hand before she is <br/>
aware of having reached for it.<br/>
<br/>
An examination of her purse contents will reveal a set<br/>
of brightly colored plastic keys, a slightly crushed package of<br/>
crackers from the salad bar two weeks ago, the contents of her wallet<br/>
strewn all over the inside, a bent pair of sunglasses, and a large <br/>
bottle of extra-strength Tylenol.<br/>
<br/>
A fledgling mother (12 to 24 months) will exhibit a singular <br/>
vocabulary, rich in two syllable words. A seemingly intelligent<br/>
woman will suddenly want to use the potty or show you a boo-boo. She <br/>
will be the one looking around anxiously when someone else&#39;s child <br/>
calls, &quot;Mommy!&quot; The truly devoted will answer, &quot;Right here!&quot; before<br/>
embarrassment can win out over instinct. At the end of each day, she <br/>
falls exhausted into bed and goes night-night.<br/>
<br/>
In her purse is a crayon fragment, a half-chewed bite<br/>
of the grocery store&#39;s daily free sample wrapped in a napkin, one<br/>
plastic block, and a large bottle of extra-strength Tylenol.<br/>
<br/>
A juvenile mother (two to five years) can also be<br/>
easily recognized.  Some tell-tale signs are a cartoon-character <br/>
bandage on her finger, a ketchup-colored handprint streaked across <br/>
her sleeve, and legs that haven&#39;t seen a razor lately. She will be <br/>
the one with the grateful, silly smile on her lips when the stranger <br/>
beside her has a two-year-old clinging desperately to one leg<br/>
screaming, &quot;I want it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When driving down the highway, you can recognize her as the one who<br/>
appears to be talking loudly to herself. Closer inspection will often<br/>
reveal one or more full car seats in the back. She&#39;s probably singing<br/>
&quot;The Wheels on the Bus&quot; with gusto.<br/>
<br/>
Her purse contains Band-Aids; Neosporin; a straw; a Barbie shoe or <br/>
Hot Wheels car (or both); an emergency package of candy; a<br/>
checkbook covered with artistic renderings of cats, flowers, and suns;<br/>
and a large bottle of extra-strength Tylenol.<br/>
<br/>
You will recognize the mature mother (6 to 12 years) as the one who<br/>
crosses to the opposite side of the mall and quickens her speed, when <br/>
a toy store is spotted. Her grocery store cart will contain three <br/>
packs of family-sized hot dogs, a case of Spaghettios, and four<br/>
boxes of cereal with three gallons of milk. Savvy in the appropriate<br/>
value of a lost tooth when placed beneath the pillow, she is also the<br/>
one who will be able to help when a stranger asks, &quot;Does anyone have a<br/>
tissue?&quot; This mother only appears to be by herself. Look closely:<br/>
her child is probably 10 steps behind her, trailing in anguished<br/>
embarrassment, trying desperately to appear alone.<br/>
<br/>
An examination of her purse contents will reveal a permission slip <br/>
(due yesterday), a piece of sea grass from the weekend at the beach, <br/>
a wilted flower, a Gameboy cartridge, and a large bottle of extra-<br/>
strength Tylenol.<br/>
<br/>
In using your field guide, it is important to remember<br/>
that a mother can only be spotted during special seasons of her life,<br/>
and once mature, she will gradually blend back into society. Her <br/>
migratory routes through Toys-R-Us and K-Mart will cease, and the <br/>
basic functions of speech and concentration will slowly return.<br/>
<br/>
The final challenge she faces is the difficult and emotional task of<br/>
convincing her brood to leave the nest. Depending upon the migratory<br/>
habits of her offspring, this may take anywhere from 18 to 36 years.<br/>
