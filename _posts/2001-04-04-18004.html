&lt;&lt;Anyone else swear by color therapy, aromatherapy<br/>
(aside from manure&lt;g&gt;), reiki, infant massage?<br/>
It would be an interesting topic to hear about, and<br/>
how you teach it to your kids....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am so behind on these posts!  I just wanted to say to the above- yes, yes, <br/>
yes, and yes- and any other natural forms of healing/therapy... out there on <br/>
the earth that go along with body, mind, spirit, nature.  I&#39;m also an <br/>
intuitive/spiritual/psychic healer.  (I never know what to &quot;call&quot; it-it is <br/>
all of these things and more- all I know is that it works and I feel very <br/>
blessed to be able to do it!).  <br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t any natural healing modalities that I can think of off the top <br/>
that I&#39;ve seen or heard of that are harmful, and as with anything, all <br/>
therapies need to be done with thought and care.  I respect all natural forms <br/>
of healing and energy work.  Not a big fan of allopathic medicine!  Can you <br/>
tell?!  <br/>
