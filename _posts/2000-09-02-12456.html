<div id="ygrps-yiv-867504050">Hi Marianne ...<br/>
<br/>
ahhhhhhh mannnnnnnnnn, that&#39;s just *dirty pool* ... does this teacher even<br/>
KNOW your child???   yes, that&#39;s another *good* reason to h-s, so you don&#39;t<br/>
have to put up w/ foolishiness like *this* ...  my suggestion is to just<br/>
consider the source and blow her off!!!  blah :P<br/>
<br/>
as far as h-s&#39;ing dd from the beginning, don&#39;t do this to yourself, it&#39;s NOT<br/>
FAIR!!!  my dss attended both  ps/private for 1 yr ... when we started<br/>
h-s&#39;ing I felt TERRIBLY guilty b/c I quickly realized how much I&#39;d missed in<br/>
their growth/development ... I also missed this experience w/ my older dch<br/>
(now 24/21) BUTTTTTT, you can&#39;t do this to yourself; live/learn/grow ...<br/>
<br/>
ahhhhhh mannnnnnn, just don&#39;t let the turkeys get you down and hang in<br/>
there!!!  goodness, you MUST be doing SOMETHING RIGHT if this teacher has<br/>
gotten so defensive about her profession (ha) ...  &lt;SMILES&gt;<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] i am so angry<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My H/s&#39;d daughter has a friend who goes to school. This friend is<br/>
&gt; rather hot headed and tends to get into trouble a lot.  My daughter<br/>
&gt; is the opposite.<br/>
&gt; Friends mother has said that my daughter is a good influence on<br/>
&gt; friend. Friends teacher also said My daughter a good influence.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Friend in trouble again.  Another teacher told friends mother, that<br/>
&gt; my daughter is a bad inluence - and - this is what made me so mad -<br/>
&gt; My daughter should be in school as she has to much time on her<br/>
&gt; hands....<br/>
&gt; Who is this women?  My daughter is with me most of the time .  When<br/>
&gt; she is not with me i always know where she is.  When did teachers<br/>
&gt; become GOD<br/>
&gt; It is because of teachers like this, who judge unfairly, that my<br/>
&gt; daughter ended up depressed at the begining of the year.  The reason<br/>
&gt; she is now unschooling - I should have unschooled her from the start.<br/>
