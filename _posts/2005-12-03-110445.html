<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271981502">So, I had heard of neopets, and we had a couple of stuffed ones that  <br/>
came in Happy Meals a few months ago. But I never checked it out  <br/>
until the recent discussion on this list. Day before yesterday I  <br/>
thought I&#39;d just go see what you all found so interesting...next  <br/>
thing I knew I had a pet Kau, and he was bloated from eating too many  <br/>
mashed potatoes with gravy (he&#39;s still bloated, poor guy). My 4 yo,  <br/>
Eric,  spotted the website on the computer, and I told him that when  <br/>
the baby fell asleep I&#39;d show it to him. Now he has a Scorchio  <br/>
(happily full, not bloated!) and we spent the whole afternoon while  <br/>
the baby slept exploring and playing games. It was so nice! Then  <br/>
after dinner last night we got on the site to show Daddy and Uncle  <br/>
Scott, and we all played. We grownups kept playing after the kids  <br/>
went to bed. And this morning my 4 yo said, &quot;Let&#39;s check on our pets,  <br/>
and then play a game,&quot; so we did.<br/>
<br/>
We grownups have always loved video games. Uncle Scott used to live  <br/>
with us, and we used to clear our calendar for a whole weekend, stock  <br/>
up on frozen food, and hole up to play Zelda or Donkey Kong. The last  <br/>
time we played for hours at a time was when Eric was a newborn. So  <br/>
this has been really fun. But how will I get anything else done?<br/>
<br/>
Su, off to find some Flat-U-Less pills if she can</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96906531">-=-We grownups have always loved video games. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I too.<br/>
Just this morning, the double points game is one I<br/>
hadn&#39;t played, and so I opened it up.  <br/>
<br/>
Often I can&#39;t play the &quot;action&quot; games--just can&#39;t<br/>
figure out what they wanted me to do, but this one....<br/>
it&#39;s Centipede!!!<br/>
<br/>
I can play Centipede, and I did, and got lots of<br/>
points. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It looks like frogger, and he&#39;s catching flies, but<br/>
operationally it&#39;s just plain oldtime Centipede.<br/>
<br/>
I long for a stand-up game with a rollerball and a<br/>
frame so heavy you can really lean into it, but<br/>
yeah... my daddy used to long for his Model A Ford and<br/>
that old tractor, too, and so arcade games fade into<br/>
the &quot;in the olden times&quot; history. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Yahoo group and the text I quoted has shown up on the list without my  <br/>
