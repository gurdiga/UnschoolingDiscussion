&lt;&lt; BUT it was actually too much socialization ---she <br/>
was giving me the attitude (that I thought was normal---NOPE) and other <br/>
such things that you would relate to maturity...<br/>
SO I locked her back up in the dungeon (NO really I am kidding)<br/>
So I said Brittany I think that you are picking up some bad habits from all <br/>
this socialization (brownies, dance, etc) and I cannot live like this and <br/>
you are not happy either so I think that we need to cut back and come back <br/>
home and if you think that you can pull together and realize that it is not <br/>
acceptable to behave in such a negative fashion then we can try it <br/>
again. &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
love this bc it is great what our children are receptive to when something is <br/>
pointed out to them....  it may sound like an ultimatum, but it is really <br/>
just mom recognizing clearly something & helping dd see it, thereby enabling <br/>
her to make a choice about her behavior!<br/>

got old<br/>
So then I decided that I was POD from invasion of the body snatchers<br/>
You know the pods that they had they developed into humans (but were really <br/>
aliens)<br/>
So there you go......<br/>
Love<br/>
