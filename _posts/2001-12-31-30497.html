My dd was going through a real craving for sugar in any form.  One day,<br/>
she asked if she could go outside to play.  I said, &quot;Not until you have<br/>
eaten six (small) cookies.&quot;  The mixture of emotions on her face was<br/>
priceless, she didn&#39;t know whether to laugh (she did) or be angry (she<br/>
was).  Now, normally, she would have eaten half the bag if allowed but<br/>
being &quot;forced&quot; to eat them was an entirely different matter.<br/>
<br/>
She tried to negotiate for fewer cookies but I held tight to six.  &quot;You<br/>
can eat more than six, but not less.&quot;  She asserted, &quot;I&#39;m not going to<br/>
eat MORE than six cookies,&quot; as though I was trying to kill her.<br/>
<br/>
She ate all six but wasn&#39;t happy about it.  And later wanted nothing to<br/>
do with the rest of the bag.  A couple of times I heard her telling a<br/>
friend I had tortured her by making her eat those cookies.  Nobody<br/>
understood why that was torture.  But I did.  Now she makes all her food<br/>
choices and dessert doesn&#39;t have the same power.<br/>
<br/>
I knew I had to give up control over food when I saw her having a little<br/>
tea with her honey and sneaking food into her room.  Giving up control<br/>
over what she eats, however, has been the easiest thing.  It was never<br/>
about the food, it was the control she craved.  Okay, she still eats too<br/>
much sugar but it&#39;s less now than it was before and it doesn&#39;t seem as<br/>
obsessive.  She actually says, &quot;No&quot; sometimes to sweet things, declines<br/>
desserts and orders water instead of soda.  Go figure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100769481">Hi Carolyn,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve experienced the same thing with my son, Leroy who is a Juvenile <br/>
Diabetic.  I am constantly having to count the number of carbohydrates <br/>
he ingests to keep his diabetes under very tight control.  There are <br/>
many times when he just hasn&#39;t had enough carbos for lunch or dinner and <br/>
I have to insist he eats a piece of fruit, cookie, or candy.  Sometimes <br/>
he&#39;ll complain bitterly, but he knows he has to do it or he may go low <br/>
and have a seizure.  His twin, Paul, is not a diabetic.  I don&#39;t control <br/>
what or how much he eats whatsoever.   It often seems so unfair to Leroy <br/>
that I constantly have to keep an eye out on what he eats, the amounts <br/>
he eats and at what time he eats.  It really is very stressful.     But, <br/>
it is done to maintain his physical well-being and to avoid <br/>
complications in the future.<br/>
