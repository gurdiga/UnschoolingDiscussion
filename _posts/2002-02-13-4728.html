Unschooling is a mindest that for us flows freely into<br/>
<br/>
and connects with all the other aspects of our lives<br/>
<br/>
in other ways. The unschooling life leads us to other<br/>
<br/>
growth and change, opening our minds to new freedoms<br/>
<br/>
and challenges, striving to follow our dreams both as<br/>
<br/>
a family and as individuals. I don&#39;t really care for<br/>
<br/>
the term Unscooling, but I utilize it as something<br/>
<br/>
that others rqecognize and connect with, something<br/>
<br/>
that conveys a message aobut us and our lives<br/>
<br/>
together, something that allows us to network with<br/>
<br/>
others. I would prefer a term less couched in the<br/>
<br/>
negative and associating with what we DON&#39;T believe<br/>
<br/>
in.<br/>
