<div id="ygrps-yiv-937198720">Thanks Jill!<br/>
<br/>
Science At Home looks like the exact magazine I wanted. We have a Barnes &<br/>
Noble nearby, so I guess we will be stopping there today to see if they<br/>
have it.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I also just found the Scientific American Explorations magazine site<br/>
and it looks good too. Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.explorations.org/index.html">http://www.explorations.org/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look for that one also at B&N. No wonder I can spend so much time and<br/>
money at bookstores! Thanks for getting the information for me.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;Subject: science mags. for Olivia<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Olivia, I went to B&N today and found those Science<br/>
&gt;Magazines for you. The first one is Science At Home.<br/>
&gt;They have a web site but I could find no phone #.<br/>
&gt;scienceathome.com  <br/>
&gt;the second mag is Scientific American Explorations<br/>
&gt;phone # to order is 1-800-333-1199 <br/>
&gt;Scientific American does have a web site but I do not<br/>
&gt;have the url. You could search it out though. Hope<br/>
&gt;this helps. Both mags look great, lots of hands on. <br/>
&gt;Good luck!<br/>
