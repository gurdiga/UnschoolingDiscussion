You mean the four CD set isn&#39;t with frills,  I thought the extended part was about as frilly as I could get?    Bummer!  I havn&#39;t even seen the other.<br/>
 <br/>
As you can tell I got the 4 CD set also.<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry,  can&#39;t help you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s one that also includes the national geographic special about New <br/>
Zealand as Middle Earth, and two bookends (like the kings on the river), and <br/>
if Kirby&#39;s correct, a couple or three collectible playing cards which aren&#39;t <br/>
available elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need bookends.  I think bookends are for people who don&#39;t have enough <br/>
books.<br/>
And the national geographic special is available from Netflix.<br/>
But I didn&#39;t know about the cards...<br/>

&lt;G&gt;<br/>
You are SO right!<br/>
How do you fit books just between those things on a shelf?<br/>
What&#39;s wrong with one stack holding up the other?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dont have Ray, but the other two fellas I have plenty of.. I just started <br/>
Dean Koontz&#39; Doorway to Heaven ( or something like that)..  I recently read <br/>
The Green Mile.. I had seen the movie, but hadnt read the book.. Of course <br/>
the book was better, but the movie was pretty true to it.  I also like James <br/>
Patterson.. I want to get Four Blind Mice ASAP.. maybe Santa will help me out <br/>
:-)   <br/>
<br/>
My boys can&#39;t wait for Two Towers.. they are counting down the days.<br/>
