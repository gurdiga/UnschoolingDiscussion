<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353495439">Robin, I love this story. I have heard many like it<br/>
from others. <br/>
I voiced this same belief some months ago and nearly<br/>
got my head chewed off. Be careful :)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I hadn&#39;t given it much thought - being &quot;chosen&quot; by<br/>
&gt; my kids, but one day when<br/>
&gt; Mackenzie was 2, he said to me &quot;Remember that time<br/>
&gt; when you were dressed<br/>
&gt; like a white princess and you walked down a long<br/>
&gt; trail with lots of people<br/>
&gt; beside it and dad was standing on the other end, and<br/>
&gt; I was floating on the<br/>
&gt; ceiling and watching you?&quot; All I can figure from<br/>
&gt; that conversation was that<br/>
&gt; he was present at our wedding, *years* before he was<br/>
&gt; conceived. Asa has said<br/>
&gt; some very similar stuff when she was a young<br/>
&gt; toddler, she mentioned our<br/>
&gt; wedding once too. I do believe now that they chose<br/>
&gt; us.<br/>
