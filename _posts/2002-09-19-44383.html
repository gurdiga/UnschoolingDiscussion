<div id="ygrps-yiv-95796966">ok, according to the dictionary, self taught is: &quot;Having taught oneself <br/>
without formal instruction or the help of others&quot;.<br/>
So isn&#39;t a book &quot;the help of others&quot; or is it because the person isn&#39;t <br/>
interacting with you in the flesh that makes it not the help of others?<br/>
Isn&#39;t the internet the help of others?<br/>
At what point do you say you self taught without outside forces?<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering about this. Obviously my pov is not the way the dictionary <br/>
defines it.<br/>
But exactly how can a person self teach without the help of others?<br/>
We get help from others from the day we&#39;re born. If only by observance.<br/>
