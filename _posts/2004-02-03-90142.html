<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been a little stressed lately.  Nothing to do with the kids<br/>
(thankfully), just myself getting overwhelmed at the number of things that I<br/>
want to accomplish...  Anyway, my husband insisted that we go out to eat<br/>
last Saturday at a grand reopening of a vegetarian restaurant here in town.<br/>
He knows that going out to eat is one of my greatest joys.<br/>
<br/>
While we were looking at the menu, I noticed that they had vegan chocolate<br/>
shakes.  I am a vegan and we&#39;ve mastered vegan chocolate shakes at home, but<br/>
I&#39;ve never had one out and about (I&#39;d never seen them at a restaurant<br/>
before).  So, here I was completely stressed, trying really hard to relax<br/>
and enjoy my wonderful family and I couldn&#39;t get myself to spend $4.25 on a<br/>
shake because I could make a bigger one at home for less money.  DH,<br/>
appropriately said, &quot;It&#39;s $4.25, a massage is $60 and a psychologist visit<br/>
is how much?  $100, $200?  Order the shake.&quot;  I did, it was wonderful and I<br/>
was able to calm down and relax for the entire meal and a while after that.<br/>
Totally worth $4.25.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes &quot;retail therapy&quot; costs a lot less than we would think, because it<br/>
is therapuetic to the soul.<br/>
