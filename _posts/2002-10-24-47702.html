Well, I really value Sandra Dodd&#39;s advice on this one, and we&#39;re putting it <br/>
to use around here.<br/>
Every single time somebody starts to lose their temper, I am present as <br/>
quickly as possible. We talk, calmly, and I try to not only listen to both <br/>
sides, but let them come up with solutions.<br/>
Sometimes a calm third party is all that&#39;s needed.<br/>
If someone loses their temper and hits, I immedietly comfort the victim and <br/>
go through the list of things we need to do BEFORE hitting becomes an option.<br/>
First, we use words.<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t work, we call in a mediator (usually Mom or Dad) to help <br/>
problem solve.<br/>
I explain to them that adults can&#39;t hit each other or they get in trouble <br/>
with the law, and that hitting makes people feel awful.<br/>
Lately, they&#39;ve been quick to feel sorry (without me telling them they <br/>
should!!) without all the guilt, blame and anger of previous times.<br/>
I even apologized to my older son for some of the things that were done to <br/>
him and told him how wrong we were (once again) and that even though we did <br/>
things to make him very angry, I didn&#39;t want to perpetuate anger in our <br/>
family and I couldn&#39;t tolerate anyone hitting anyone else because it makes <br/>
our home an angry place, rather than peaceful.<br/>
Yesterday morning I read a quote by Deepak Chopra and they each chose a rock <br/>
(a pile of rocks we keep for meditation purposes with words on them like <br/>
&quot;strength&quot;, &quot;joy&quot; or &quot;peace&quot;) to hold. They choose ones that they feel they <br/>
need to focus on.<br/>
I have found a peaceful beginning to the day, and a request for us all to <br/>
focus on making each other happy and doing nice things, really helps set the <br/>
tone for the day.<br/>
I find myself dialoguing a lot, but more trust developing between everyone.<br/>
More compassion, more problem solving skills and so on, are being noticed.<br/>
Not that we don&#39;t have bad moments.....everyone does.<br/>
But I really believe that my calm awareness is going to make a huge <br/>
difference eventually.<br/>
Patience is not my strength, but I&#39;m learning.<br/>

Well I&#39;ll just throw this question out. Does Kalie get enough attention and <br/>
one on one interaction with just you? I know you said she gets plenty of <br/>
attention but I mean only you and her. I know it&#39;s hard, believe me with my <br/>
4 it&#39;s hard to take the time for just me and one of them but my husband and <br/>
I try very hard to do this often. Even if it&#39;s just a trip to the store.<br/>
<br/>
Also she sounds like she&#39;s just trying to rile someone up. Maybe she&#39;s bored <br/>
and needs more stimulation? I&#39;m just talking out loud so if this isn&#39;t the <br/>
case, disregard!!! Maybe too, she is ahead of playing with her ages. Are <br/>
these kids her same age? I know my Alyssa (2) doesn&#39;t like to play with 2 <br/>
year old stuff and does much better with older kids. Then we she does get <br/>
around younger ones, she has a tendency to play better because it&#39;s <br/>
different. But mostly she doesn&#39;t like to play like most 2 year olds.<br/>
