<div id="ygrps-yiv-348994050">Shelly, no I have not met any &quot;radical schoolers&quot; but I did attend a dinner last night with other parents of special needs kids. Three of them ganged up on me trying to convince me I should put my children back in school, specifically my special needs son. It makes no sense to me. He is 12 and has cerebral palsy. He is a very young 12, still believes in tooth fairy etc. If I were to put him in school in the rural town we are in, he would have to go to the high school (there is no junior high here) to receive &quot;services&quot; which is 40 minutes away for one (so tack on two more hours to his day) He would be in a special day class (which as I recall from school was commonly called the &quot;retard class&quot; on campus by other students). They conspired ahead of time to try to push me to get him in school because I am &quot;robbing him of the experience.&quot; Oh, you bet I am. An experience we could do without. <br/>

I do have to remember that these are the same type of people who think homebirth is child abuse, while I personally feel many hospital births (not all) are child abuse and mother abuse. I just let it go... it&#39;s like arguing religion, politics, or abortion. No one wins. <br/>

rainy afternoon playing legos on the front porch. As I<br/>
looked out the window at him, I was feeling grateful<br/>
that, relatively speaking, he&#39;s a &quot;young 12&quot;, too.<br/>
With so many 12-year-olds having sex, smoking<br/>
cigarettes, drinking and doing drugs, there&#39;s Andrew<br/>
playing legos and being a kid. That makes me very<br/>
happy.<br/>

wonderful experience learning at home!<br/>
