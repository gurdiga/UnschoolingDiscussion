        Your post on unschooling is excellent!  It&#39;s hard to believe a parent <br/>
would not help a child learn to do things!  I can&#39;t imagine telling my <br/>
child,&quot;no&quot; when asked to help him read a word!!  You put &quot;unschooling&quot; into <br/>
words so easy for others to understand.  I felt a sense of confirmation that <br/>
what we are doing is right, as every once in a while, I need to hear it.  <br/>
Thanks!                                                 Karen</div>

&lt;&lt; Unschooling is to do with the environment the kids live in. You can&#39;t<br/>
 unschool successfully as a method. You need to provide an environment<br/>
 rich in opportunity, experiences and, most essentially, trust. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I loved your response.  Your description of your son who thrives on structure <br/>
was really encouraging to me.  I have one like that too, and  everytime I <br/>
assign workbook pages for him, I feel like I&#39;m &quot;selling out&quot;.  LOL  <br/>
You&#39;re right about our children being able to sense when we&#39;re waffling about <br/>
unschooling.  They know when they are being watched and even evaluated (even <br/>
if we&#39;re only doing it subconsciously).  If we don&#39;t trust them it just won&#39;t <br/>
work.  It seems to be the hardest thing for us to do.  Isn&#39;t it sad that the <br/>
biggest, most long-lasting lesson so many of us learned in school is that <br/>
&quot;Children Are Not To Be Trusted&quot;.  That one goes along with &quot;Give Them An <br/>
Inch And They&#39;ll Take A Mile&quot;.  It is engrained in us.  Our culture says it&#39;s <br/>
okay for adults to have choices, but not kids.  Why is that?  I admit to some <br/>
guilt in this - it&#39;s okay if I choose to have more cookies than are good for <br/>
me with my morning coffee, but I don&#39;t let the kids make the same choice.  I <br/>
guess we have some responsibility to shelter them by guiding their choices.  <br/>
I KNOW how many cookies it takes to give me a stomachache ( a LOT!  LOL) but <br/>
the kids don&#39;t.  Where do we draw the line between completely trusting them <br/>
and protecting them because we&#39;re the parents?  It&#39;s a tough call.  <br/>

<div><font size="2">Thanks for your response.&nbsp; That does help some.&nbsp; I&#39;m 
finding that the one thing that seems consistant with unschoolers is that they 
provide an enriched environement...and then they let the child lead.&nbsp; The 
amount of direct parental involvement seems to stem from what individual 
children need or want.&nbsp; </font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I can see how this would work.&nbsp; I worry about gaps 
though, even though I know we all have gaps. Unschooling fits our way of life 
well, but I tend to use it to &quot;supplement&quot; a more eclectic approach, hmmmm, or 
do I supplement unschooling with the eclectic approach??&nbsp;

  <p>You will always hear stories about unschooling not working. I have one that 
  I know from personal experience, where the 3 kids have turned out variously 
  illiterate, totally lacking in self esteem, a bully and a thief. Their mother 
  was into John Holt and unschooling from the time the eldest was a baby. 
  <p>But you see it&#39;s all a matter of definition, and IMO she didn&#39;t understand 
  what unschooling was all about. For example, when her daughter wanted to 
  attend a gym class instead of just the play-around-with-the-equipment session, 
  because she wanted to learn how to do things properly, she was told no. When 
  one wanted to learn to read it was told no. And so on. This woman thought 
  unschooling was taking your kids to lots of places, having lots of toys, 
  books, etc - offering an enriched environment - but NEVER teaching them 
  anything, because teaching is the root of all evil. And to her, responding to 
  a child asking &#39;what does this word say?&#39;, was teaching, so she wouldn&#39;t do 
  it. IMO this was neglect, not unschooling. 
  <p>In my experience, some kids thrive on structure - I have one like that. I 
  am trying to help him find his own ways of structuring his life. He loves 
  workbooks - discovered them through another homeschooler and begged for them 
  for his birthday! He likes to have a schedule printed up of all our 
  commitments, so he can work out times to do his maths, music practise etc. My 
  husband taught him to use MS Projects or some such thing so he could timetable 
  his day! But this isn&#39;t forcing anything on him, it&#39;s enabling him to live how 
  he likes, within a disorganised family &lt;g&gt; Others thrive on serendipity, 
  and going with the flow. 
  <p>On a more subtle level, and this is the level I&#39;m still at :-(&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br/>
Sure I think your going to hear stories, I &quot;know&quot; of a few myself.  But you <br/>
have<br/>
to ask yourself, would this child have had &quot;gaps&quot; if they had been schooled?  <br/>
We have all read the statistics of children graduating that don&#39;t know basic <br/>
math or how to read.  I would think we could do at least that much for our <br/>
children. A child who does not know what he needs to know to function in life <br/>
because he was unschooled, could very likely have the same problems if he <br/>
were sent to public school or worse. Other times that unschooling might not <br/>
work would be when someone says &quot;oh we tried that&quot; but didn&#39;t really <br/>
understand what unschooling is or maybe only tried it for a short period of <br/>
time and didn&#39;t really trust enough to give it a chance.  Again I recommend <br/>
doing some reading at Unschooling.com ---<br/>
