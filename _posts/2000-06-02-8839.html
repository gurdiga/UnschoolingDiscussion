&gt; Oooops!  I sent this privately (learning a new email program) and<br/>
&gt; meant to send it to the list, do you mind resending this if I resend<br/>
&gt; mine?<br/>

&gt; &gt; You can&#39;t let them know it&#39;s a lesson. They can keep score without<br/>
knowing it&#39;s addition. &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Welcome Angela,<br/>
&gt;  My suggestion to you is to just live your life as you normally would,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt;  turn as many things as possible into a learning experience. Today, for<br/>
&gt;  instance, we went bowling. What most people would think of as play we<br/>
turned<br/>
&gt;  into a lesson. Math with scorekeeping, science with physics of the ball<br/>
&gt;  going down the alley, etc. Even a trip to the grocery store can be<br/>
&gt;  educational. Just live life and have fun.<br/>
&gt;  Amy<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;   I&#39;d like to mention here that if I try to make things &#39;educational&#39; my<br/>
eldest switches off. I&#39;ve found it&#39;s best for us to answer her questions,<br/>
and try to make time for conversations, and she&#39;ll figure out what she needs<br/>
to know in her own way. btw, this includes maths &lt;g&gt; But she does have<br/>
&gt; a certain amount of &#39;puter stuff, though no drawing tools or paper atm,<br/>
cos they got thrown out in a tidying-up dispute on Tuesday.<br/>
