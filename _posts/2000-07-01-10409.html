<div id="ygrps-yiv-922168727">Our boys, 3 and 7, go to bed at 8 in the winter and 9 in the summer (when it <br/>
is light later). They have a bath, story and then lights-out. We do feel <br/>
like it is important to have a routine that we can plan around. We can&#39;t <br/>
really talk or watch a grownup movie with them around clamoring for food, <br/>
attention, cartoons, etc. so after 9 would be our time together and as brief <br/>
as it may be before we collapse exhausted, we do enjoy it.<br/>
