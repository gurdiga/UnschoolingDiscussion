Here&#39;s my advice: get out of this program.  Find a private teacher.  He&#39;ll<br/>
make faster progress and be happier with his playing faster.  At this stage<br/>
of the game, he&#39;d probably also benefit from only one person teaching him,<br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
You said something in your original post about this being a program you<br/>
could afford.  I started teaching at 16.  Surely you can find a talented<br/>
teenager in the area, or call the nearest college or university or youth<br/>
symphony to find someone (ask for the violin teacher).  If you want to tell<br/>
me where you are, I may be able to send you towards someone.  If all you can<br/>
find is someone you can&#39;t afford, ask about a discout based on your<br/>
financial needs.  Many teachers would be happy to teach a kid who really<br/>
wanted to take but couldn&#39;t afford it.  But you have to ask.  In 17 years of<br/>
teaching, I&#39;ve been asked 4 times to cut my price.  I was happy to, and I<br/>
think other people would, too.<br/>

p.s. If you stay with the group lessons, don&#39;t lie to the teachers about the<br/>
practice time.  Your integrity is more important than that.  Tell them you<br/>
think the practice chart is stupid, and that you won&#39;t lie to them about the<br/>
time your son spends or doesn&#39;t spend; you&#39;re more interested in him<br/>
enjoying practicing than making it a drudge.  Hey, maybe *they&#39;d* learn<br/>
something...!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, we are looking into alternatives now. We signed up for the <br/>
program because it had been recommended by some other hs-ers in our <br/>
area. We decided to give a try and now, 6 weeks into it, it&#39;s flaws <br/>
are very obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Funny you should mention confronting the teachers about the stupid <br/>
practice charts. I&#39;ve come *that* close to speaking up about them <br/>
several times. I&#39;ve talked with ds about the whole point of <br/>
practicing (which is to master a skill, not fill in some silly sheet <br/>
in order to get a pencil as reward). I told him it was his choice <br/>
whether or not he filled in enough to get his reward and to his <br/>
credit he decided it was better to be honest. He&#39;s not taking the <br/>
carrot! (guess I must be doing *something* right, after all!)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe tomorrow (next lesson) I&#39;ll get up the nerve to say my piece.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the insight.  Beth</div>
