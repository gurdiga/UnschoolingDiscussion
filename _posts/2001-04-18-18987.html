<br>Well, you wouldn&#39;t know you have the problem until you do the test, it seems

<br>And some of us who would opt for an abortion if told we were going to have a

Just to stick my nose in :)<br/>
<br/>
If I recall the original post correctly, in *that case*, an ultrasound <br/>
indicated a problem, so an amnio was done to determine the problem. The <br/>
amnio was not routine, but used only after a problem was detected.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892055730">Unfortunately amnio has suffered from bad press.  Too much anecdotal telling<br/>
of stories that weren&#39;t first hand to begin have grown into &quot;facts&quot; with a<br/>
life of their own.  Kinda like when in ps on a rainy day teachers would have<br/>
kids play &quot;Telephone, Telegraph&quot; to see how an original sentence she handed<br/>

ear.<br/>
<br/>
Amnios, when properly done with ultrasound concurrently, have a less than 1%<br/>
chance of causing a miscarriage.  There is a 2-3% chance of a miscarriage in<br/>
a normal pregnancy.  So what caused the miscarriage.  No one knows for sure.<br/>
<br/>
As to the accuracy of the testing, the test for Down&#39;s is 99% accurate, the<br/>
tests for other genetic problems are 90% accurate.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.obgyn.upenn.edu/Genetics/Amnio.html">http://www.obgyn.upenn.edu/Genetics/Amnio.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Now on to the good.  There are many, many, many children alive that wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been because of lung, spine and kidney disorders that amnios have<br/>
accurately diagnosed.  Many, many more than there have been errors and many,<br/>
many more than there have been possible miscarriages.<br/>
<br/>
Although, due to a litigious society, some doctors are mad about tests, most<br/>
hold to the guidelines that are set which are: history, age (over 35), other<br/>
test results (blood tests, ultrasounds), current complaints of patient which<br/>
indicate that this test should be done.<br/>
<br/>
Babies with SB have an excellent survival rate now that amnios are done<br/>
(natural births can do severe damage to a spine that is already damaged<br/>
which frequently resulted in death).  An amnio can tell you if the lungs are<br/>
mature enough to allow an early lab to proceed or if you should be given<br/>
drugs to try to stop the labor.  Kidney problems which were deadly 30 years<br/>
ago are now being treated in utereo or immediately after birth.  Treatment<br/>
can begin immediately after birth for those with cystic fibrosis.<br/>

<div><font color="#008080" size="4">I think a lot of problems occur because poeple 
don&#39;t ask enough questions or are not given enough information in order to make 
an informed decision. When my doctor recommended amniocenesis, I asked all kind 
of questions. Probably twenty minutes worth. I found out all I could, positives 
and minuses. I took a couple of days to find out information independently 
before saying yes or no. In my case the anser was no, but in a different 
situation it might have been yes. With my first child, I took the doctor&#39;s word 
on whether a test was needed, but learned to question and did refuse some tests 
in subsequent pregnancies. Each pregnancy is different and as the parent, we 
have an obligation to our child to choose wisely, even before they &quot;arrive&quot;. 
Thank you Linda for presenting another side to the issue.</font></div>

  <div><font color="#008080" size="4">I think a lot of problems occur because poeple 
  don&#39;t ask enough questions or are not given enough information in order to 
  make an informed decision. When my doctor recommended amniocenesis, I asked 
  all kind of questions. Probably twenty minutes worth. I found out all I could, 
  positives and minuses. I took a couple of days to find out information 
  independently before saying yes or no. In my case the anser was no, but in a 
  different situation it might have been yes. With my first child, I took the 
  doctor&#39;s word on whether a test was needed, but learned to question and did 
  refuse some tests in subsequent pregnancies. Each pregnancy is different and 
  as the parent, we have an obligation to our child to choose wisely, even 
  before they &quot;arrive&quot;. Thank you Linda for presenting another side to the 
  issue.</font></div>

    <div><br></div><tt>Unfortunately amnio has suffered from bad press.&nbsp; 
    Too much anecdotal telling<br>of stories that weren&#39;t first hand to begin 
    have grown into &quot;facts&quot; with a<br>life of their own.&nbsp; Kinda like when 
    in ps on a rainy day teachers would have<br>kids play &quot;Telephone, Telegraph&quot; 
    to see how an original sentence she handed<br>out ended up when it reached 
    the end of the line when whispered from ear to<br>ear.<br><br>Amnios, when 
    properly done with ultrasound concurrently, have a less than 1%<br>chance of 
    causing a miscarriage.&nbsp; There is a 2-3% chance of a miscarriage in<br>a 
    normal pregnancy.&nbsp; So what caused the miscarriage.&nbsp; No one knows 
    for sure.<br><br>As to the accuracy of the testing, the test for Down&#39;s is 
    99% accurate, the<br>tests for other genetic problems are 90% 
    accurate.<br><a rel="nofollow"
 target="_blank" href="http://www.obgyn.upenn.edu/Genetics/Amnio.html">http://www.obgyn.upenn.edu/Genetics/Amnio.html</a><br><br>Now 
    on to the good.&nbsp; There are many, many, many children alive that 
    wouldn&#39;t<br>have been because of lung, spine and kidney disorders that 
    amnios have<br>accurately diagnosed.&nbsp; Many, many more than there have 
    been errors and many,<br>many more than there have been possible 
    miscarriages.<br><br>Although, due to a litigious society, some doctors are 
    mad about tests, most<br>hold to the guidelines that are set which are: 
    history, age (over 35), other<br>test results (blood tests, ultrasounds), 
    current complaints of patient which<br>indicate that this test should be 
    done.<br><br>Babies with SB have an excellent survival rate now that amnios 
    are done<br>(natural births can do severe damage to a spine that is already 
    damaged<br>which frequently resulted in death).&nbsp; An amnio can tell you 
    if the lungs are<br>mature enough to allow an early lab to proceed or if you 
    should be given<br>drugs to try to stop the labor.&nbsp; Kidney problems 
    which were deadly 30 years<br>ago are now being treated in utereo or 
    immediately after birth.&nbsp; Treatment<br>can begin immediately after 
    birth for those with cystic fibrosis.<br><br>Lynda<br>----- Original Message

    Everytime I&#39;ve heard amnio mentioned it was accompanied by the
