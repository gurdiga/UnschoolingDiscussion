Heidi, didn&#39;t you just join lately?<br/>
If you joined when I was on pain killers and not too mobile, (October and <br/>
early November) that might explain why I would have missed your bold <br/>

I joined about two weeks ago. And, in discussing this concept with my <br/>
best friend, she brought up the founding fathers&#39; childhoods of <br/>
structure, coursework, schedules, etc. So I threw it in the pot here. <br/>
I did get feedback, I think from Mary B., that the founding fathers <br/>
may have pursued further, even Classic education, but they didn&#39;t <br/>
embark on their scholarship before about age 12.<br/>
<br/>
Ben Franklin&#39;s bio bears that out. He self-educated, beginning about <br/>
age 12. The man was a GENIUS, btw. Self-learned three Romance <br/>
languages, plus Latin.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236634208">Oh, absolutely. I may not be a full-fledged radical unschooler, but <br/>
I&#39;ve always given my kids actual books to read, not textbooks. NEVER <br/>
textbooks, though we have a few in the home library in case they ever <br/>
wanted to peruse one. <br/>
In fact, we&#39;re ready to toss Abbie&#39;s science text out the window. <br/>
Oceans, then Weather, then Chemistry, then this, then that...so far, <br/>
none of these topics has sparked a fire in her, but what am I <br/>
supposed to do, according to the correspondence school we&#39;re using <br/>
for her high school, if some science topic DOES take off in her mind? <br/>
When she gets through that topic in the text, jump to the next topic <br/>
and drop what she&#39;s falling in love with? I just HATE textbooks. The <br/>
public school mentality...I&#39;m becoming more and more convinced THAT <br/>
is what is wrong with American youth, NOT the ditching of prayer or <br/>
Bible reading IN the schools...the freaking schools, themselves.<br/>
<br/>
How B.Franklin learned Latin was, in his middle adulthood, he decided <br/>
to learn it. Found a Latin grammar (textbook? maybe) and found that <br/>
he picked it up in a few months, BECAUSE he already knew the French <br/>
and Italian. And he also learned the French and Italian because he <br/>
wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>

<br/>
If some science topic does take off, it could be neverending.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish &quot;science&quot; as a school-topic didn&#39;t exist.  <br/>
That&#39;s not what I mean to say, but I&#39;m leaving it because it popped out.<br/>
<br/>
What I wish is that no one had come up with the idea to lump all the cool <br/>
stuff about the earth and space and microscopic life into one heading.   I&#39;ve <br/>
never known anyone equally interested in all of that, unless they &quot;hated <br/>
science&quot; and so decided in advance to shun and ignore anything that anyone <br/>
else thought was &quot;science.&quot;   Someone can know all about marine biology <br/>
without caring anything at all about crystal formation or metamorphic rock.  <br/>
But in school it seems &quot;good at science&quot; or &quot;likes science&quot; is like an on/off <br/>
switch that not only the students don&#39;t understand, but most of the teachers <br/>
don&#39;t either.  <br/>
<br/>
Worse than math which is presented &quot;in order&quot; so that those who are stuck or <br/>
dislike one level are barred from the rest for a while (or discouraged <br/>
forever), science&#39;s arbitrary levels seem entirely unrelated, except for that <br/>
thread of scientific observation and measuring and discovery and methodology. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s what I mean. But it is the institutional school that <br/>
started the trend, Homeschoolers just opt for &quot;doing school at home,&quot; <br/>
not thinking it through. Even to the point of having a separate room <br/>
with desks and everyone&#39;s workbooks in his or her own desk, and <br/>
having school time, etc. I never could do that. We&#39;ve always just <br/>
gotten out the books and sat down to &quot;school&quot; at the kitchen table, <br/>
and &quot;school&quot; has always been &quot;Get your math done!&quot; LOL  Thank God I <br/>
have opted from the beginning, for self-created curriculum using <br/>
living books (Principle Approach), or very hands off curriculum where <br/>
the kids teach their own selves (Robinson, albeit Math is pretty <br/>
forced with Robinson, even if kids aren&#39;t shaping up to have a brain <br/>
for math)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible, even at home, to break up a kid&#39;s time into little <br/>
increments, although I would definitely say, even the most scheduled <br/>
and regimented homeschoolers find all their school work done in a <br/>
couple of hours, and the rest of their time for cool stuff. I don&#39;t <br/>
know any families where the home lessons have taken five or six hours <br/>
a day. <br/>

<br/>
When I was just in the early stages of reading about homeschooling, when <br/>
Kirby was five, I was sitting at the playgroup meeting with several other La <br/>
Leche League types (lots of leaders, lot of regulars, and some people I <br/>
didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I was asking some of the unschoolers questions.<br/>
<br/>
I said (probably too raucously) &quot;HEY, I hear there are some homeschoolers who <br/>
even make a SCHOOLroom with a teacher&#39;s desk and maps and a flag, and the <br/>
kids have to stand up in the morning and say the Pledge of Allegiance. . .&quot; <br/>
and I wasn&#39;t even through with my &quot;Can you beLIEVE this Sh** would really <br/>
happen!?&quot; when one of the leaders, I noticed started kind of twitching parts <br/>
of her face toward the woman sitting next to her.<br/>
<br/>
I trailed off and she said &quot;Yeah, some people really do.&quot;  I knew exactly who <br/>
she meant, and I changed the subject just enough to cover what was left of my <br/>
butt. <br/>
<br/>
Had I known more, I&#39;d&#39;ve just asked her WHY.  But I was so new I didn&#39;t feel <br/>
confident in saying more.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago when there was no separate place for unschoolers, but the bulletin <br/>
boards were mixed homeschoolers, someone reported to us with great <br/>
satisfaction that during school hours, her children were required to call her <br/>
&quot;Mrs. Smith&quot; or whatever it was.  That way they remembered they were Really <br/>
in SCHOOL.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard this off and on.  I can hardly imagine it.  I mean, even my kids friends call me by my first name, and some of them even call me &quot;mom&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
To make my own kids call me &quot;mrs.&quot;????? LOLOLOLOL<br/>

I&#39;d have lost them the very first minute of &quot;school&quot;.  What kid is going to take that seriously??<br/>

division between the role of parents and the role of kids. That kids are<br/>
clearly subordinate to mom. (Who is subordinate to her husband. Who is<br/>
subordinate to God.)<br/>
