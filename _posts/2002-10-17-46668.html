Southwest Alaskans say bird is the size of a small plane<br/>
 <br/>
Wednesday, October 16, 2002<br/>
 <br/>
THE ASSOCIATED PRESS<br/>
 <br/>
ANCHORAGE -- Reports of a giant winged creature seen in Southwest Alaska<br/>
in<br/>
recent weeks have biolgists and residents puzzled.<br/>
 <br/>
Villagers in Togiak and Manokotak say the huge bird has a wingspan of<br/>
about<br/>
14-feet -- the size of a small plane -- and is much bigger than anything<br/>
they have seen before.<br/>
 <br/>
Scientists aren&#39;t sure what to make of the reports. No one doubts that<br/>
people in the region west of Dillingham have seen a very large raptorlike<br/>
bird. But biologists and other people familiar with big Alaska birds say<br/>
they&#39;re skeptical it&#39;s that big.<br/>
 <br/>
A recent sighting of the mystery bird occurred last Thursday morning when<br/>
Moses Coupchiak, a 43-year-old heavy equipment operator from Togiak, 40<br/>
miles west of Manokotak, saw the bird flying toward him from about two<br/>
miles<br/>
away as he worked his tractor.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;At first I thought it was one of those old-time Otter planes,&quot; Coupchiak<br/>
said. &quot;Instead of continuing toward me, it banked to the left, and that&#39;s<br/>
when I noticed it wasn&#39;t a plane.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The bird was &quot;something huge,&quot; he said. &quot;The wing looks a little wider<br/>
than<br/>
the Otter&#39;s, maybe as long as the Otter plane.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
The bird flew behind a hill and disappeared. Coupchiak got on the radio<br/>
and<br/>
warned people in Togiak to tell their children to stay away.<br/>
 <br/>
Pilot John Bouker said he was highly skeptical of reports of &quot;this great<br/>
big<br/>
eagle&quot; that is two or three times the size of a bald eagle. &quot;I didn&#39;t put<br/>
any thought into it.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
But early this week while flying into Manokotak, Bouker, owner of Bristol<br/>
Bay Air Service, looked out his left window and 1,000 feet away, saw a<br/>
very<br/>
big bird.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;The people in the plane all saw him,&quot; Bouker said. &quot;He&#39;s huge, he&#39;s<br/>
huge,<br/>
he&#39;s really, really big. You wouldn&#39;t want to have your children out,&quot;<br/>
Bouker said.<br/>
 <br/>
Raptor specialist Phil Schemf in Juneau is skeptical of the size.<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m certainly not aware of anything with a 14-foot wingspan that&#39;s been<br/>
alive for the last 100,000 years,&quot; Schemf said.<br/>
 <br/>
Schemf, other biologists, a village police officer and teachers at the<br/>
Manokotak School said the sightings could be of a Steller&#39;s sea eagle, a<br/>
species native to northeast Asia and one of the world&#39;s largest eagles.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
about 50 percent bigger than a bald eagle.<br/>
 <br/>
The Steller&#39;s eagle has occasionally shown up in the Pribilof Islands, on<br/>
the Aleutian chain and on Kodiak.<br/>
 <br/>
A bird known to be a Steller&#39;s sea eagle has been spotted three times<br/>
since<br/>
May and in August of last year, 40 miles up the Nushagak River from<br/>
Dillingham, according to Rob MacDonald of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife<br/>
Service.<br/>
 <br/>
Another Steller&#39;s eagle took up residence on the Taku River south of<br/>
Juneau<br/>
for 10 summers starting in the late 1980s, Schemf said.<br/>
 <br/>
The fish-eating Steller&#39;s sea eagle can weigh 20 pounds and have a<br/>
wingspan<br/>
of up to 8 feet. It has a distinctive and impressive appearance, Schemf<br/>
said, with a pronounced yellow beak, a black or dark brown body and large<br/>
white shoulder patches.</div>

Beats me if they are true, but a creationist can understand them <br/>
easier than an evolutionist can.<br/>
<br/>
Non-believers in evolution likewise enjoy these discoveries because <br/>
they believe that all species were created concurrently.  That is <br/>
there was/is adaptation by natural selection within species but no <br/>
evolution between species.<br/>

I had the great good fortune of seeing a Steller&#39;s Sea eagle when I lived<br/>
in Alaska.  I hope someone get&#39;s a picture, and can determine the real<br/>
size.  Steller&#39;s are huge birds, I might snatch up my baby if one was<br/>
passing overhead.&lt;g&gt;  If this is a Steller&#39;s and it really is that big,<br/>

I&#39;m trying to imagine all those cute but deadly ones from Jurassic park.  You know, the ones that suddenly got vicious.  What was their name?<br/>
<br/>
Actually started a head story like that...suddenly everywhere dinosaurs and other lost creatures and plants, began appearing everywhere.  Neaderthal, Australopithecus afarensis, the Dodo and passenger pigeon.  Wooly mammouths and those not so friendly dolphins of the past....<br/>
With no warning a towering tree would appear where once stood a home...<br/>

anyway...sounds like an interesting bird...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984262543">Isn&#39;t Dinotopia supposed to be a series on TV now? <br/>
I am so out of touch with TV.  I better find that one out, my son loves those books!<br/>

I&#39;m trying to imagine all those cute but deadly ones from Jurassic park.  You know, the ones that suddenly got vicious.  What was their name?<br/>
<br/>
Actually started a head story like that...suddenly everywhere dinosaurs and other lost creatures and plants, began appearing everywhere.  Neaderthal, Australopithecus afarensis, the Dodo and passenger pigeon.  Wooly mammouths and those not so friendly dolphins of the past....<br/>
With no warning a towering tree would appear where once stood a home...<br/>
<br/>
anyway...sounds like an interesting bird...<br/>

  Can&#39;t you see a little chomper running around the house,  just think a walking composter!  Although it would have to be trained and I don&#39;t know if their brains could wrap around that concept.    And also I suppose pet cats and dogs would turn into some nice snacks for them.  Ewwww.<br/>
<br/>
  How about crossing a Lab/Retreiver with a T-rex.  I can see it!&lt;g&gt;<br/>
  Kelli, thinking that our pet guinea pig sounds very easy right now!<br/>

  He doesn&#39;t really mean it. But what a thought.<br/>

  about where an apatasaurous would sleep...<br/>

  &gt; I was hoping for a aptasaurous as a pet. <br/>

  &gt; Now you&#39;ve gone and spoiled my illusions... Dinosaurs aren&#39;t coming <br/>
  &gt; back. <br/>
  &gt; No land of the lost.  Pout, pout, pout.<br/>
