<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961740849">Something cool happened today!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I was boooooored. Really, really, really bored. I&#39;m not often<br/>
bored, but I had nothing to do today. I was so bored that about an hour ago,<br/>
I decided to work on fractions with my old high school CD-ROM course.<br/>
Anyway, I started doing the problems, and about ten minutes into it I<br/>
realized that (for the first time I can remember) I was actually stopping to<br/>
figure out the problems in my head, instead of guessing or starting at the<br/>
screen in despair. So the whole thing turned into a game. I&#39;d calculate and<br/>
convert the problems in my head, and then type them in..score!. I got most<br/>
of them right, and the ones I got wrong I could understand why. This is<br/>
really cool! I&#39;ve never been able to understand fractions before. ~Eryn<br/>

&quot;I dreamed I was a butterfly, flitting around in the sky;<br/>
then I awoke. Now I wonder: Am I a man who dreamt of<br/>
being a butterfuly, or am I a butterfly dreaming that I am<br/>
a man?&quot; - Chuang Tsu<br/>
