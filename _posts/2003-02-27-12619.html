<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844154596">I was hoping someone could help me...on another list I am on, I was trying to explain to the group what unschooling is.  I received another question from the group and I was hoping someone here could help me find the best way to answer her questions.  I mean, I know my children are learning and I personally don&#39;t care if they do want to &quot;play&quot; all day (in fact I hope they do!), but I have a hard time putting it into the right words.  Any advice on what to answer to the following would be *greatly* appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
{beginning}<br/>
Question.  Do you ever have a problem with motivating your child to<br/>
get interested in &quot;learning&quot; about something?  I purchase<br/>
curriculum from a charter-like school.  I&#39;m really interested in<br/>
unschooling but I&#39;m afraid my kids would want to play all day.  I know<br/>
children learn through &quot;play&quot; but I don&#39;t think playing with their<br/>
action-figure toys all day would benefit their extended learning. <br/>
What do you do about this?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1904693937"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Question.  Do you ever have a problem with motivating your child to<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, there are two points:<br/>
<br/>
One is that playing with their action-figure toys *would* benefit their<br/>
extended learning -- I know I&#39;m continually amazed when listening in on the<br/>
adventures of my daughters&#39; action figures and stuffed animals how much they<br/>
are working out different complex things -- interpersonal relationships,<br/>
storytelling which is just verbal writing, grammar, syntax, public speaking<br/>
-- all this without even talking about the various &quot;subjects&quot; that come up<br/>
in such play ranging from science to history to arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
The second is that no child plays with their action figures all day every<br/>
day unless they are given no other choices of things to do. Unschooling is<br/>
all about paying attention to their interests and helping them (whether<br/>
that&#39;s finding new action figures for them on eBay, helping them build<br/>
Action Figure Swim World in the back yard with an old rubbermaid bin, taking<br/>
pictures of the action figures doing various action figure things so they<br/>
can keep them in a scrapbook, etc.) and also in bringing bits of the world<br/>
that you think *they* might find interesting to them (trips to the zoo, or a<br/>
factory that makes jelly beans, or videos or books or websites about otters<br/>
or Pokemon or bananas).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the pursuit of happiness. In that pursuit, learning cannot<br/>
help but happen. Humans are just like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292124039">Children learn, not through &quot;play&quot; but through real genuine PLAY! I <br/>
think the quote marks here are really significant. As some of you know, <br/>
we&#39;ve been doing trains here for the past year. What ON EARTH can be <br/>
learned by trains? Oh, sure, Thomas and Friends trains have numbers <br/>
painted on their sides, and I&#39;m assured by the promotional material that <br/>
children can learn the colors of them. C&#39;mon on! Who really cares?<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this evening my son (5) came in and was talking about Big Sky <br/>
Country. I mentioned that was Colorado--no, New Mex--no, anyway, it&#39;s <br/>
somewhere--go ask Dad, and he informed me &quot;Montana.&quot; Where did he GET <br/>
that?! Train magazine. From playing with trains, and being supported to <br/>
follow his interest in trains. No motivation required to &quot;learn,&quot; he <br/>
just comes up with stuff.<br/>

<br/>
How would your husband get you interested in rebuilding carburetors?<br/>
<br/>
Answer: He probably couldn&#39;t! Motivation comes from inside. It comes from<br/>
someone wanting to pull the information in because they need it, not from<br/>
someone else persuading them that something is interesting enough to learn.<br/>
<br/>
How did they learn English? What kind of words did they use as 2 yos? Did<br/>
you worry that cup and red and owwie and juice weren&#39;t preparing them to be<br/>
corporate executives? They lived one day at a time, reaching out for what<br/>
they needed for the moment. And day by day, living for each day, they got to<br/>
be where they are today.<br/>
<br/>
Preparing someone for an unknown future is hard boring work. It takes years.<br/>
But if a child pursues what interests him, he&#39;s already preparing for his<br/>
future. Even if it&#39;s actions figures.<br/>
<br/>
Play is how children are *designed* to explore the world and learn. That&#39;s<br/>
their natural state. That is until adults come along and mess it up trying<br/>
to impose unnatural learning ways on them. And because those ways are<br/>
unnatural, they are *hard* for kids. We assume because kids find it<br/>
difficult that what they&#39;re learning is difficult. But it isn&#39;t the what<br/>
that&#39;s difficult. It&#39;s the how that&#39;s difficult. The difference between<br/>
being made to learn something someone else wants you to and playing is the<br/>
difference between climbing up the side of a really steep mountain that<br/>
someone else decided you need to climb, and rambling all over the<br/>
mountainside exploring and playing and having fun. One is work and if you<br/>
don&#39;t like where you ended up, you&#39;ll probably never climb another mountain.<br/>
The second is fun and where you end up isn&#39;t nearly as important as what you<br/>
discovered along the way.<br/>

and learning.  They need to trust their children&#39;s innate desire to learn and <br/>
understand how learning happens, quickly and permanently knowledge is <br/>
absorbed when it&#39;s gathered while pursuing a passion rather than through rote <br/>
memorization.<br/>
<br/>
Steer this person to read John Holt and Unschooling.com to start.  Unless <br/>
they are willing change their ideas about school and learning they probably <br/>
won&#39;t succeed at unschooling.<br/>
