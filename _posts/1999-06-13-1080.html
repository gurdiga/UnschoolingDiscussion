do not posess the cognitive abilities to acuratelty do these calculations<br/>
until something like age 10.  It makes reasonable sense to me, and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to take a chance with my children, if every time they cross the street<br/>
there is the possibility that they will get squished due to inaccurate<br/>
calculations.  Of course, there are no absolutes and I am sure that there<br/>
are some children that reach this level of cognitive ability earlier.  Not<br/>
to mention the fact that the sciences of Psychology and other types of<br/>
brain study are still quite young.<br/>

<br/>
There is some pretty fascinating info in Frank Smith&#39;s book (The Book of <br/>
Learning and Forgetting) about the fact that many scientific studies of <br/>
learning are actually studies of how we learn nonsense!  I think there may be <br/>
many faulty conclusions floating around in the &gt;&gt;sciences&lt;&lt; of Psychology and <br/>
of Education.<br/>
<br/>
To back up and explain for those who haven&#39;t read this cool book:<br/>
<br/>
In order to get a controlled result when studying the effectiveness of <br/>
learning methods, one needs to have people to test who have no prior <br/>
knowledge of that subject and no particular interest in the subject.  <br/>
(Otherwise their prior knowledge or strong interest may skew the result.)  <br/>
Therefore experiments were designed ,(by Ebbinghaus), to test how well people <br/>
could memorize nonsense words.  That made for a more controlled experiment.  <br/>
But the human brain seems to work best making connections between real <br/>
things.  Studying how we learn nonsense doesn&#39;t lead to valid conclusions <br/>
about how we learn things that do make sense, and do connect to our prior <br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had time to write this better, but I&#39;m late to go visit my mom.  <br/>
Gotta fly!<br/>
<br/>
Hope some of you have something to add on this topic.  My husband has always <br/>
thought that a lot of official theory about Short Term Memory was hooey -- I <br/>
need to discuss this with him further.<br/>
