This is a conference that the whole family can enjoy! Nestled in the hills<br/>
of the Berkshire mountains, the camp lets you experience early fall foliage<br/>
season in New England in the company of homeschooling families, speakers<br/>
from across the United States, and the friendly and knowledgeable staff of<br/>
Eisner Camp. Children participate in well-run activities while you attend<br/>
the sessions you wish; teens can attend activities or sessions. There are<br/>
also a private teen lounge and special teen activities, vendors, plenty of<br/>
indoor meeting spaces, playground, boating, biking, basketball and tennis<br/>
courts and a heated swimming pool. Accommodations on site include two nights<br/>
lodging, six full meals, coffee, fruit and snacks throughout the weekend.<br/>
<br/>
FUN Books and other vendors will be there so come prepared to shop! If you<br/>
have any special order items you would like to get, or if you would just<br/>
like to save on shipping, send us a list of the items you want and you can<br/>
pick them up at the conference. Be sure to stop by our table and say hi!<br/>
