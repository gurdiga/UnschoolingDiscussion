<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518687794">I actually picked up a copy of Baby Signs, the book, and we are, shall I <br/>
say, I am working on them, so as to teach them to Caeleb.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
teaching my older kids ASL and would like to teach him that, rather than <br/>
obscure, made up signs.  Although, we do stick with whatever he comes up <br/>
with.  For example, his sign for ball is to raise his arm over his head and <br/>
&#39;throw the ball down&#39;.  It works and I know exactly what it means, so we <br/>
stick with that.  He also grabs his diaper when he is wet or dirty so that&#39;s <br/>
easy to recognise, too.  We are working on need signs right now...eat, <br/>
drink, sleep, etc.  Those are usually the things he has a hard time with <br/>
(anger, frustration), especially when I am distracted by other things.  <br/>
Although he will come grab my hand and lead me to the fridge or to his bed <br/>
here and there.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else doing ASL with their kids?  We are having such a blast with <br/>
it.  The first sign we did was soda....I told the kids we were going to play <br/>
a game and they had to learn to sign it if they wanted a Coke and BOY, we&#39;ve <br/>
got a million little hands signing soda all the time!  LOL  Now they are <br/>
begging me for signs for everything!  They love trying to learn signs *I* <br/>
don&#39;t know to throw me off.  It has really been a wonderful time for us all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-144608646">My favorite of the kids&#39; is the ASL &quot;Whaaaat?&quot; with shrugged shoulders and <br/>
waving, open hands.  It looks just like the question it&#39;s asking :)  <br/>
<br/>
I find, too, when I&#39;m really frustrated with Hayden in public [and I&#39;m gonna <br/>
say that thing that my mom always said but I swore I never would...], I&#39;ll <br/>
begin to sign to him instead ~ it throws him off, gives me a chance to <br/>
recollect and the resolution comes quickly.  <br/>
<br/>
For reassurance, most *natural signs* that babies make up become ASL with <br/>
little intervention; just as babbling becomes spoken English.  Model the <br/>
adult version while accepting the baby version and soon you&#39;ve got a <br/>
bi-lingual family :)  {the secret to unschooling a second language}<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569273731">I don&#39;t know what it is about sign language that I just don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; but<br/>
my brain doesn&#39;t seem to process it well.  When my son wasn&#39;t talking<br/>
yet, I got some sign language videos and watched them over and over.<br/>
Then my son started signing and I had no clue what he meant.  Sometimes<br/>
I had to pull out a video and watch it again to see what he was saying.<br/>
Just a few weeks ago we were at my parents&#39; house and he was feeling<br/>
tired and overwhelmed and for some reason didn&#39;t feel like making the<br/>
effort to talk.  He started signing, and my husband and I could not for<br/>
the life of us remember what the signs meant, even though we recognized<br/>
them.<br/>
