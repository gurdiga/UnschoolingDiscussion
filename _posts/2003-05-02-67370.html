&lt;&lt; I can&#39;t figure out if I should just keep allowing her to be in <br/>
<br/>
situations where she has to deal with it, or if I should try to avoid <br/>
<br/>
them if possible until she seems &quot;older&quot; or better able to deal with <br/>
<br/>
them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would try to avoid them for the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s part of what school features which just crushes the souls of some kids, <br/>
the incessant competition for grades, lining up first, sitting in the best <br/>
place in the bus or the cafeteria, having the nicest notebook or backpack, <br/>
being called on to do something interesting (if THAT happens to happen).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Making it into a contest and <br/>
<br/>
creating a single winner and many losers just doesn&#39;t seem to be that <br/>
<br/>
great of an idea to me.  But it seems like I am in the <br/>
<br/>
minority on that one. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can bring that up at organizational meetings, say &quot;Why are you <br/>
having a contest that declares X-1 LOSERS instead of having a cooperative <br/>
activity that will be X Winners?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542332701">At our house we do &quot;first winner&quot; &quot;second winner&quot; &quot;third winner&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
So if the 3 of us (mom, dad and 3 year old) are &#39;racing&#39; everybody wins :-)  If we find anyone else to race we would of course add on &quot;fourth winner&quot; etc  No losers in our family.<br/>
