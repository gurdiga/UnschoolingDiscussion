<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501744574">we went to a girl scout function called Family Fear Factor.  IT was <br/>
totally cool, they had five challenges.  You ate worms out of mud, had <br/>
to move worms from one location to another (picking them up and carrying <br/>
them about 15 feet), eat a chocolate covered bug, feel five mystery <br/>
items and figure out what they were, put your hand through a bunch of <br/>
crickets to find two keys, and a race.  Janene ate the chocolate bug <br/>
like nothing.  Just popped it into her mouth and chewed.  It really is a <br/>
chocolate covered raisen but Janene ate the &quot;bug&quot; convinced it was a <br/>
bug. She also moved the earth worms like she was moving precious pets.  <br/>
Both girls regularly pick up bugs and worms, etc. (saving them by <br/>
putting them back into the dirt after a rain or watering).  I was just <br/>
really proud of them.  Other girls did OK, some did well, but Lexie and <br/>
Janene attacked each challenge and did their aboslute best and were not <br/>
afraid of anything. :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524214283">This sounds so fun! Chloe (4 3/4 ;0) has seen the advertisements for <br/>
the upcoming Family Fear Factor on channel 4, whatever station that <br/>
is. She swears we could do well. She says that Daddy would be <br/>
terrible on the &quot;bug eating part&quot;...she is right! But she thinks we <br/>
(her and I would do great here)...I agree. Then she went on to say <br/>
that Daddy is very strong so he would do great on the &quot;physical&quot; <br/>
(her word not mine) challenges. She is right on. Apparently Raiden <br/>
would be great at the &quot;scary stuff&quot; too because he is strong like <br/>
Daddy and not much afraid (ummm...yeah he is 13mos old). LOL!!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you had a fun and challenging day!! I want a turn!!<br/>
