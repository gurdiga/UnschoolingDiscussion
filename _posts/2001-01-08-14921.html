There is a saying (and I cannot remember what author actually said this)<br/>
which claims that if every subject we teach in schools could be presented<br/>
to children in story form, there would be no difficulty  learning any<br/>
concept, subject, or skill.  <br/>
I have found this to be true with nearly every child I have worked with,<br/>
I&#39;m sure most parents would agree with it as well.<br/>
