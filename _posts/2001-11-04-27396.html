<div id="ygrps-yiv-626113863">My SIL loves to throw that phrase around. . . . her son is all boy or 100% <br/>
boy. . . Bryan(my husband) always ask her what that means, and what would a <br/>
50% boy look like. Our son, Quinton loves to play with pink and purple things <br/>
and goes right to the Barbie isle in the toy store. I offered him one of <br/>
Lelia&#39;s old dresses the other day and he just loved it. . . thought it was <br/>
the coolest thing to play with. If he turns out to be gay, I would have no <br/>
problem absolutely. Neither would my husband. His sister says she thinks it <br/>
would be so cool to have a gay brother. But I guess we are much more the <br/>
exception than the rule as to families accepting alternative lifestyles for <br/>
their children.<br/>

Have you noticed that the HORSES are all in the Barbie<br/>

dinosaurs and neutered (well, they are) fighting<br/>

have to sit down to play with.  Very few real<br/>
play-with-move-your-body-around-fun-things...so<br/>
nothing that is really attractive to anybody.  A child<br/>
that appreciates beauty at all is forced to go to the<br/>
&quot;girls&quot; toys isles.  At least in Walmart...the only<br/>
&quot;toy&quot; store within 50 miles of our home.<br/>
<br/>
Skate board, bicycles, kayaks, tents, hot-air<br/>
balloons, gliders, kites, other really fun stuff come<br/>
in ALL colors.<br/>
<br/>
Besides....the Creator plays with pink and purple,<br/>
too.  What color are the sunsets?  What colors are the<br/>
mountains? What colors are in sea-shells? What colors<br/>
are lots of the flowers? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-228836274">The great thing about legos, tinker toys and similar toys is that they can <br/>
be built on (given for many birthdays, etc.) and their appeal is ageless.  <br/>
My children love to play with the capsela that belonged to my brother.  The <br/>
only problem is we are missing some parts and can make 5 items out of 50.<br/>
