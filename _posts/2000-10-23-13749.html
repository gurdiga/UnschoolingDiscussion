<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301219110">The test taking is my only fear about having late readers as well. Here in<br/>
Oregon, I don&#39;t think you can administer the tests at home by yourself. And<br/>
kids have to score above the 15th percentile to avoid some form of<br/>
intervention from the school district. I admit, I&#39;m not completely up on the<br/>
laws yet as we just moved here and also as I don&#39;t have to worry about it<br/>
for 3 more years. My son (4) is already reading the Bob books, so I think I<br/>
won&#39;t have to worry about that with him, but who knows how my daughter will<br/>
do. I just hate the fact that even though we are unschooling, we still have<br/>
to comform to some sort of timeline about when they have to know certain<br/>
subjects. I hate the idea of having to prepare the kids to take tests just<br/>
so we can keep away from having to deal with government interference.<br/>
<br/>
And on a relatively unrelated note, are there any other unschoolers on this<br/>
list from Eugene, OR?? If so, I&#39;d like to hear from you (off-list) about<br/>
unschooling groups or good homeschooling groups in this area. I tried the<br/>
numbers listed in the Oregon Homeschooling handbook, but haven&#39;t gotten a<br/>
response. Went to a homeschooling fair here a few months ago but that ended<br/>
up being run by a Christian Homeschool organization which is not exactly<br/>
where we&#39;re at.<br/>
