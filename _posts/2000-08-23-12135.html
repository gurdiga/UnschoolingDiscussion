than he&#39;s ready for, but he will still get a lot out of it.  Our son pretty <br/>
much learned to read from Nintendo Power and scriptures.  Since he was really <br/>
interested in winning the games, he would pour over the magazine and work <br/>
really hard to understand what was written.  His reading level improved <br/>
dramatically and all at his own effort.<br/>
<br/>
(The scripture reading came from daily family reading.  If you are not into <br/>
scripture/religion, I highly recommend having some form of &#39;higher&#39; reading <br/>
that the family does together on a regular basis (Shakespeare, other <br/>
classics, or poetry for instance).  There is something about reading to the <br/>
cadence of a &#39;different&#39; language that stimulates the reading ability.  FWIW, <br/>
Dr. Seuss or Shel Silverstein are great for this, IMO! )<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you didn&#39;t necessarily ask for an educational gift.  &lt;g&gt;  Eight is <br/>
the age we finally got DS his own subscription to Nintendo Power.  He kept <br/>
snagging his brother&#39;s copy and having his personal copy brought much peace <br/>
to our home!  LOL<br/>

my 8 yo boy loves monopoly-so we have 4 sets! 1 is a pokemon set! he also <br/>
really likes to play chess, so we have gotten him a chess clock and a few <br/>

wherever we go!!!!! he loves the mystery-type books-boxcar children, hardy <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Betsy.  Good suggestion.  He does like books on tape, especially book <br/>
and tape combinations.  I think he&#39;s a visual learner, and the picture book <br/>
is a help keeping him focused on the story, although a friend lent us the <br/>
tapes for the first Harry Potter, and he&#39;s done very well listening to them <br/>
without having a book in front of him.  Do you have any favorite books on <br/>
tape?<br/>

of mine!  I should pull out my Silverstein books and read them to Zack.  I <br/>
actually always thought of them as mine, because a friend introduced me to <br/>
his books many years ago, long before I had children, and I never thought of <br/>
them (honest!) as children&#39;s books.  But they really are, aren&#39;t they?<br/>

well he counted the money.  He played Monopoly Junior with some friends <br/>
recently and enjoyed it.  Do you think that might be too young for an 8 year <br/>
old? I also saw both a Star Trek chess set and a Star Wars chess set in a <br/>
game shop where he goes for Pokemon cards.  Hummm, maybe one of those. . .<br/>

&lt;&lt;Do you have any favorite books on tape?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t done a lot of book-on-taping yet.  One we did listen to from the <br/>
library that was quite fun was The Whipping Boy, by Fleischman.  (About the <br/>
boy who studies with the spoiled prince and has to take the prince&#39;s <br/>
punishment because the tutor is not allowed to hit royalty.)<br/>
<br/>
The Chinaberry catalog has a good selection of books on tape, with <br/>
descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
If your son really enjoyed Harry Potter #1, then #2 might be a winner.  My <br/>
son is 6, so his taste probably won&#39;t match that of your son very closely.<br/>

age suggestions and have a hard time imagining that you can play Monopoly <br/>
without the buildings &lt;grin&gt;.  But, I&#39;m unschooling too, and I&#39;ve really <br/>
