<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned defends himself:<br/>
I said, &quot;some homeschoolers.&quot; I didn&#39;t say anything about you. (but I might)<br/>
<br/>
My point seemed logical since many people in this unschoolers&#39; e-list do<br/>
not, by definition, use or follow &quot;plans&quot; or curricula. As DeWes has been<br/>
happy to admit, telling the state what it wants to hear, even if it is<br/>
false, is his/her practice. Therefore, &quot;some&quot; if not most unschoolers in MA<br/>
lie when they profess to the government that they follow a &quot;plan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s fair to conclude that if you tell the state that you follow a<br/>
curriculum or that your homeschooling follows a plan, and if that&#39;s the<br/>
truth, then you&#39;re not an UNschooler  -- not that there&#39;s anything wrong<br/>
with that.......<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, again -- putting words in my mouth:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;You&#39;re basically saying the homeschoolers of MA are too blind, ignorant and<br/>
&gt;&gt;like scared sheep to be able to understand the smoke that&#39;s in their own<br/>
&gt;&gt;state. That you who see so much clearer know that every puff of smoke is<br/>
&gt;&gt;hiding a ranging inferno about to burst free. That insults every politically<br/>
&gt;&gt;active homeschooler in MA.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Gosh, did I say all that? Wow.<br/>
<br/>
Later, Joyce says:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I do cheer for the quiet ones in the state group who are politcally active for<br/>
&gt;&gt;homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned expresses himself again:<br/>
Good, but<br/>
What can be more politically active than doing exactly what the Bryants did?<br/>
They were, in fact, &quot;quiet ones&quot; just like everybody else, until they were<br/>
faced with the need to lie IN WRITING to the state simply in order to keep<br/>
to their practice. Their crime, according to the homeschool mafia, is<br/>
refusing to lie.<br/>
<br/>
(does anyone know what catagory of crime LYING TO THE STATE is? --<br/>
Misdemeanor? Felony? --What happens to people who are caught?)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, for the Bryants, being dishonest was more than they were willing to<br/>
suffer.  Hey, what if they were discovered by some snooping neighbor or an<br/>
ambitious social worker looking to score some points by uncovering<br/>
&quot;Educational Malpractice&quot; or &quot;Pedagogical Skullduggery&quot; or, worst of all --<br/>
the oxymoronic &quot;Homeschooling Non-Conformity&quot; in the home of the Bryants,<br/>
all on a tip from one of the semi-literate clerks in the local<br/>
superintendent&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
And what are all those other &quot;quiet ones&quot; doing to help change the laws of<br/>
MA, and how are they helping the Bryants? People in every state need to know<br/>
because lots of us want to make things better. This is the most ON TOPIC<br/>
thing I know.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, I asked you to explain your displeasure/annoyance about the Bryants<br/>
here. What you&#39;ve done is continue to complain about them without telling<br/>
what you believe they did wrong. What gives? Other people seem to think this<br/>
is relevant to unschooling, as do I. Tell me (us) why it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce: Why shouldn&#39;t homeschoolers in other states do exactly what the<br/>
Bryants have done under such circumstances? Or is this about me?<br/>
<br/>
Ned Vare<br/>
Obedience is the great multiplier of evil.<br/>

Fear the man who feels himself a slave. He&#39;ll want to make a slave of you.<br/>

This is personal insult.<br/>

curriculum or that your homeschooling follows a plan, and if that&#39;s the<br/>

<br/>
I think it is NOT fair.  <br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t looked at what Carol Narigon wrote, please do so before you <br/>
further insult those in several states who are successfully and HONESTLY <br/>
using her style of description of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingcurriculum</a><br/>
<br/>
I have a DEFINITE plan for my kids.  It doesn&#39;t look like a curriculum and it <br/>
doesn&#39;t lead to &quot;graduation&quot; at 17 or any of those things, but I&#39;m not <br/>
listlessly out in the midst of years of vague childrearing, either.  The plan <br/>
includes NOT ruining their confidence with school-style nonsense, and I&#39;m <br/>
vigilant about that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to turn in diddly in New Mexico, but if I did I could describe <br/>
what we do honestly and make it sound way better than the education <br/>
objectives and measures the public school is using this year or any year.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Joyce, again -- putting words in my mouth:...<br/>
Gosh, did I say all that? Wow.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Will the insults ever stop?<br/>
You won&#39;t answer that.  You haven&#39;t answered any direct questions that I can <br/>
remember.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Their crime, according to the homeschool mafia, is<br/>
refusing to lie.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What &quot;homeschool mafia&quot; do you mean?<br/>
And will you stick to your claim that nobody can comply with that law without <br/>
lying no matter what else people here say, the way you stuck so doggedly with <br/>
your phonics claim against a sea of evidence?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This is the most ON TOPIC thing I know.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s about politics.  It&#39;s not about how people learn.<br/>
And it&#39;s not as honest as it needs to be, and will NOT be honest until you <br/>
see that it is possible to write up a description of unschooling in <br/>
educational jargon and be telling the truth about a family&#39;s intent.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Joyce, I asked you to explain your displeasure/annoyance about the Bryants<br/>
here. What you&#39;ve done is continue to complain about them without telling<br/>
what you believe they did wrong.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Joyce and one or two others HAVE listed their objections very clearly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What gives? Other people seem to think this<br/>
is relevant to unschooling, as do I. Tell me (us) why it&#39;s not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That would be repetitive all over again, and redundant.  It&#39;s been said.  <br/>
It&#39;s been told.<br/>
<br/>
Please read the description Carol Narigon wrote before continuing to say <br/>
&quot;lying&quot; and &quot;dishonest&quot; about people in those states who have filed as <br/>
unschoolers, aboveboard and honestly.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But Ned, I&#39;m saying I&#39;m an unschooler and I am able to describe unschooling<br/>
in my ed plan without lying to the superintendent. You&#39;re saying the Bryants<br/>
needed to lie because they&#39;re unschoolers and found it too odious to lie so<br/>
chose to take a stand. The logic doesn&#39;t quite flow there.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, that&#39;s just your *guess* why the Bryants did what they did. Have<br/>
you read the posts at MAHomeschoolers and MassHomeLearningAssoc? Please give<br/>
quotes from the Bryants to tell us what the Bryants did and why.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, for the Bryants, being dishonest was more than they were willing to<br/>
&gt; suffer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you supply some quotes where the Bryants said anything like that? It<br/>
sounds pretty when creating a heroic figure. But we&#39;re not writing a movie<br/>
script. Let&#39;s just stick with the real people and what really happened, not<br/>
the movie of the week version of the Bryants.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hey, what if they were discovered by some snooping neighbor or an<br/>
&gt; ambitious social worker looking to score some points ...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Boogeymen. If we must discuss it, then let&#39;s stick to things that have<br/>
actually happened in MA in similar circumstances. Tell me what the Bryants<br/>
*actually* feared -- include quotes from them -- not what you believe they<br/>
could have feared. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If there&#39;s anything left unexplained by my Heroes post, then just ask again.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it&#39;s clear that I am not complaining or annoyed with the Bryants. I<br/>
*am* annoyed that people outside of MA want to insist that the Bryants and<br/>
their case was about fighting for the rights of homeschoolers in MA when<br/>
nothing I&#39;ve read from Kim Bryant herself supports that.<br/>
