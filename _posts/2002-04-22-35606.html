<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292966206"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; So the question remains unanswered, How do you go about finding<br/>
&gt; people to &quot;trade lessons&quot; with if your kids want to learn something<br/>
&gt; you can&#39;t help them with?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tell everyone you know that your kid wants to learn to *skydive* (or<br/>
whatever...) and you&#39;re on the lookout for some help for them.  Chances are,<br/>
somebody knows somebody whose Uncle had a friend.....<br/>
<br/>
Also, try getting away from the idea that you have to trade &quot;lessons&quot;.<br/>
Maybe you all love your kids more than I do, but *I* can use a break now and<br/>
then, so I trade my teaching (of music) for lots of babysitting! (This is<br/>
really good, because the kids themselves end up &quot;paying&quot; for their own<br/>
lessons)  I have also accepted used books, housecleaning or housesitting<br/>
services, etc.  It doesn&#39;t have to be my lessons for your lessons.  In fact,<br/>
around here, it rarely is!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-104652482">Somewhere in the U.S. there was a big &quot;place,&quot; for lack of a better word.<br/>
Kinda reminded me of the old Farmers Market in Portland, OR back in the 60s.<br/>
At anyrate, it was kinda of a combination flea market, farmers market and<br/>
used things stores all under one big roof.  You got &quot;chits&quot; that could be<br/>
used through out the building for things.  Kind of a barter system.  So you<br/>
could take you old books to the bookstore section and get a credit chit for<br/>
those books which you could in turn use at one of the other markets.<br/>
<br/>
We were hauling to horseshows at the time and I&#39;m blessed if I can remember<br/>
what city or even state it was in.  But I remember thinking, &quot;dang, I wish<br/>
we had one of those near us!&quot;<br/>

Lynda, who has boxes of books piled to the ceiling in the garage and the<br/>
tool shed, not counting those in the house and the attic and in everyone&#39;s<br/>
bedrooms.<br/>
