 </span></blockquote>We might need a definition of &quot;allowance.&quot;  Most of us assume that an<br/>
allowance we give our children is discretionary -- for the free use by the<br/>
child. If the parents put conditions (strings) on how some of it it is to be<br/>
spent -- not that there&#39;s anything wrong with that -- the amount that the<br/>
parents control is not allowance, it&#39;s really still the parents&#39; money that<br/>
they are keeping in the child&#39;s pockets, to be spent as they have directed.<br/>
<br/>
When you control money you &quot;give&quot; your kid, the amount you control is not<br/>
allowance. If there&#39;s some left over that the child can spend (or save, or<br/>
give away) at his/her discretion, that amount is the actual allowance.<br/>

I AGREE!!!<br/>
I think I would tell my children that I am putting a certain amount aside<br/>
for them for savings, charity etc that they could add to IF they wish.<br/>
keeping that seperate rather than giving an allowance and then taking some<br/>
of it back. After all one can&#39;t choose to give if there is no choice.<br/>
