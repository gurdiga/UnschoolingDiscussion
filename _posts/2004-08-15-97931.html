<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976492801">That&#39;s alright. Yeah, I could have too. I&#39;ve never<br/>
been as girly-girl as my mother would have preferred.<br/>
I think I ended up with an allergy to little bitty<br/>
rosebud prints after that one. <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t long after that that I decided I wanted to<br/>
fly the F14 Tomcat, shaved my hair off into a military<br/>
cut and pasted up Tomcat photos all over my wall. <br/>
<br/>
And the hair..shoulda heard the ruckus the other<br/>
cheerleaders gave me over it since I couldn&#39;t wear the<br/>
hairbow! Nothing wrong with cheerleading, I absolutely<br/>
loved it, but it sure was fun when the girls saw my<br/>
head shaved! <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately my mother went and cut her hair short as<br/>
mine not long afterward since &quot;Well, it looks good on<br/>
you so I knew it would look good on me since you look<br/>
so much like me.&quot; Can&#39;t win with my mother, let me<br/>
tell ya!<br/>
