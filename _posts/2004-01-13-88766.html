<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281093847">I have learned so much from this list!  It really challenges me and makes me think and I could use some input here!<br/>
<br/>
I have concerns about my 2nd child.  He will be 10 years old in May and he has autism.  I&#39;ve been unschooling him since July.  Before this, we were doing &#39;school at home&#39;, albeit even then in a relaxed fashion.  When we had Jonathan diagnosed, they tested his IQ at 88 and he&#39;s been consistently at a 1st/2nd grade level since around the age of 7.<br/>
<br/>
Since we&#39;ve been unschooling, his attitude has improved tenfold.  He no longer has emotional meltdowns and seems SOOO much happier!!  I could tell that I had been pressuring him to &#39;catch up&#39; and that this was doing more harm than good.  Hence the decision to just &#39;let it go&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
He is very artistic and loves to draw.  He loves to play board games, so I have no real concerns about his math skills, as I can see that coming on its own, just through curiosity and play.<br/>
<br/>
My concern with him is in the area of reading and pessimism.  Before, when I was doing &#39;school at home&#39;, we worked through a phonics curriculum, and he did well with the decoding thing, but he still does not read. <br/>
<br/>
He has the attitude of &#39;I can&#39;t read.&#39;  and  &#39;I don&#39;t know how to read.&#39;  Even though, from last year, when we were doing school at home, I know he *can* read.  <br/>
<br/>
For instance, today he brought a popsicle stick to me with a joke on it and said, &quot;I can&#39;t read this.&quot;  The words were all simple, save for one word and that was &#39;digital&#39;.  So I said, &quot;Is it just this word here?  That word is &#39;digital&#39;&quot;  And then, with prompting on my part, he read the rest of the joke with ease.<br/>
<br/>
But his initial attitude was &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot;  Is there any way that I can help him with this attitude?  In other words, if he has the attitude of &quot;I can&#39;t read,&quot; will that ever change on its own?  Or has the proverbial damage already been done?  Will he ever become a reader if he thinks he is not, or can&#39;t be, or, maybe even never will be able to become a reader?<br/>
<br/>
And is it better for me to encourage him to sound words out and, therefore, figure it out?  Or is it better for me to read it for him and ignore the &#39;pessimistic&#39;, &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; attitude?<br/>
<br/>
Btw...he doesn&#39;t like to be read to.  He never has.  He has auditory sensitivity issues and I really think that being read to was almost &#39;painful&#39; for him in a way, as he is easily overwhelmed by auditory stimuli.<br/>
<br/>
Any and all advice would be most welcome!!!  And if there is anyone on this list unschooling a special needs child, I would LOVE to hear from you!!  I have yet to meet anyone, either in &#39;real life&#39; or online, who is unschooling an autistic child, or any child on the &#39;autism spectrum&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

 <br/>
Hello! Welcome to the group! I have four children. My oldest is Sarah, who is nearly 8 years old. She has a diagnosis of ADHD, quite possibly has mild Asberger&#39;s (sp?!) but we decided not to pursue testing for it. Next I have Logan, who is nearly 4. As far as we can tell at this point he is NT. Megan is 2 1/2, and has some developmental delays that may or may not be related to possible PDD-NOS but we&#39;re not pursuing a diagnosis there either. Gracie is 5 months old, and so far also seems NT. <br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve kept Sarah home since the end of Kindergarten, nearly 2 years now. While she figured out that she &quot;could&quot; read during the first couple months of &quot;first grade&quot; she has only really begun to read since about last October. She, too, had a very pessimistic attitude towards reading. She is primarily an auditory learner, and visual things seem to be a weak spot for her. Mostly, we just kept reading to her and telling her that she COULD read. After about a year of having the technical knowledge but not really interest, she became interested in reading and will now read some. Like I said though she is primarily an auditory person so I don&#39;t expect her to ever become a &quot;reader&quot; like I am...I &quot;devour&quot; books. I continue to encourage her to read for fun, and listen as she reads when she wants to read aloud, which gives me the opportunity to see that her skills are improving. I just do my best though to understand that reading may never be her primary source for information or a favorite<br/>
 &quot;fun&quot; activity.<br/>
 <br/>
Right now though, your son may just need you to continue to not make a big deal out of his reading or seeming lack of it. Keep interesting things around that he might like to read, especially if they are full of pictures and just be available. I think he&#39;ll do just fine eventually!<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>

I don&#39;t have any suggestions for auditory sensitivities, but as far as<br/>
whether or not to make him sound out the words, here&#39;s what I did with my<br/>
oldest who is a perfectionist and easily frustrated.  When he was going to<br/>
read a new book, I would look over the first couple of pages and say<br/>
something like, &quot;There are some new words here that you might not know like<br/>
xxxx, and xxxx and xxxxx&quot; as I pointed to the &quot;harder&quot; words and read them.<br/>
Then, he would read the pages to me.  The we would preview the next few<br/>
pages.  That way he could read the book without having to stop and ask me<br/>
what the words were, or slowly sound them out.  It helped a lot with the &quot;I<br/>
cant&#39;s&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
evan is like that as well. he will say, &quot;i can&#39;t do it&quot; for the drama <br/>
effect. then i will ask, which word can&#39;t you do. he&#39;ll point to it and <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s our experience.  My daughter went through the &quot;I can&#39;t read&quot; stage after she left school (she was almost 8).  What I did was to remove any pressure she felt.  I knew she *could* read, technically, but obviously she had no such confidence.  So I did not ask her to sound anything out; I just read whatever she asked.  I did point out to her once in a while when she was reading a word here and there ... see you can read, you just haven&#39;t meet all the words yet (and I mentioned how I sometimes come across new words as well - nobody knows them all!).  I would get books from the library that I thought she might like and left them lying around.  And I read stories to the kids.  This lasted just over a year.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it ended up that the kids loved the Harry Potter books and I read them over and over.  We eventually got the audiobooks and she listened to them almost constantly in her room.  Last fall she started picking up the books to look up various passages and found she wasn&#39;t as intimidated as before.  Soon she read the first HP book (and her first book) on her own in 3-4 days.  And now she&#39;s branched out to &quot;The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter&quot; and various other things.  In fact, a few weeks ago she announced in mock horror &quot;Oh no, I&#39;m turning into a bookworm!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that your son does not enjoy being read to, so maybe you can bring the words to him in a different way.  I know my eldest learned to enjoy the written word through video game guides and magazines.  Does your son have an interest that maybe you could get a magazine subscription for?  Especially if the magazine has wonderful pictures in it as well.  He can get info through the pictures to start and his interest may lead him to start reading the captions and eventually the articles.  For now, you can do any reading he wants from it for him.<br/>

Hey Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking more about this, and I really think the best thing to do is back off completely. I know a big part of your concern is J being down on himself and believing that he &quot;can&#39;t&quot; do it--far more than you&#39;re worried about the act of reading itself. But I think at this point any kind of &quot;encouragement&quot; however hands-off and well-meaning is going to reinforce his attitude of &quot;they want me to be able to do this, but I just can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reflecting on this in terms of Emily, who had only about 3 weeks of daily practice &quot;encouraged&quot; on her. It was turning so incredibly negative. Once we completely, and I mean completely, backed off, she began to do things on her own terms. At first she just didn&#39;t do anything at all, but then she started reading little things like boxes, signs, video titles. She built up her confidence in her own way and on her own terms and started thinking to herself, &quot;hey, I can do this!&quot; Gradually, she went back to the Clifford readers, which dh and I had decided were &quot;too easy&quot; for her and had &quot;encouraged&quot; her to move away from. She would read 2 or 3 at a time and reinforce the confidence that she was rebuilding on her own, now that we&#39;d finally stopped interfering with her.<br/>
<br/>
Then the other night she read 4 in a row while snuggling in bed with me--I was just keeping my mouth shut! I&#39;m still disappointed with myself because she&#39;ll look up at me periodically, asking with her eyes &quot;am I getting this right?&quot; I&#39;m just smiling at her and listening, maybe a wink or a rub periodically, but I&#39;m trying to be way hands off. After the 4th book was done, she yawned and said, &quot;I am getting *so* good at reading! I&#39;m going to bed now, mama. I love you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Emily is beginning to own the reading for herself, which is what is reversing the &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; attitude. Yes, damage has already been done. I think it&#39;s minimal, and I&#39;m very grateful to have come to my senses sooner rather than later. But I really believe that the only reason she&#39;s changing her attitude is because I have dropped any efforts to encourage. I quietly support by being there to listen when she&#39;s ready to read, but that&#39;s it. <br/>
<br/>
Watching her read on her own terms without any involvement from us was really dh&#39;s turning point on unschooling. While he had been generally supportive of it, he was hanging onto the whole math and reading thing. Now, he&#39;s seeing how unschooling works in action, and he&#39;s really impressed. I&#39;m sure that we&#39;ll revisit his concerns periodically, and I feel bad that Emily will take the brunt of it all as the oldest. But now, I have a success story to remind him about. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; He has the attitude of &#39;I can&#39;t read.&#39;  and  &#39;I don&#39;t know how to read.&#39;  <br/>
Even though, from last year, when we were doing school at home, I know he <br/>
*can* read.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly couldn&#39;t read when she was ten, and she wanted to, but the &quot;parts&quot; <br/>
weren&#39;t all in her head yet.   Her only known biological disadvantage is she was a <br/>
preemie.  Her teeth came in slowly too.  She only got her &quot;eye teeth&quot; within <br/>
the past year.  That may or may not have anything to do with it.  There&#39;s an <br/>
&quot;old wives tale&quot; that until those teeth are in a child won&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For instance, today he brought a popsicle stick to me with a joke on it and <br/>
said, &quot;I can&#39;t read this.&quot;  The words were all simple, save for one word and <br/>
that was &#39;digital&#39;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It helped my kids to know that sometimes even the best of readers will come <br/>
to a word she doesn&#39;t know.    It helped them to know that some words I know by <br/>
sight and some I have to sound out because they&#39;re new or uncommon. <br/>
<br/>
It helped them for me to remind them of other things they learned in stages.  <br/>
Roller blading, runnning and jumping, playing video games.  There&#39;s a <br/>
beginning stage, and a getting-better stage, and though they might get pretty quick <br/>
at reading, they&#39;ll never have seen all the words there are in the world.   <br/>
It&#39;s a process.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And is it better for me to encourage him to sound words out and, therefore, <br/>
figure it out? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.  You could sound one out for him.  With <br/>
&quot;digital,&quot; I would have said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a hard word.  &quot;g&quot; is usually hard, like <br/>
&quot;dig&quot; in English, but this one is from the word &quot;digit&quot; that means finger.  <br/>
It&#39;s from Latin or Greek word parts.  &quot;Digital&quot; just has to do with counting <br/>
and numbers, and people count on their fingers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told TONS of stories like that to kids learning to read.  For one thing, <br/>
it&#39;s distracting (in a good way) and it shows WHY English is so inconsistent.   <br/>
It trades them a COOL piece of knowledge for their sad frustration in not <br/>
reading a word they might never even have heard or seen before.<br/>
<br/>
In Walmart on Monday Holly said there are words with &quot;th&quot; in the middle which <br/>
are NOT &quot;th&quot; words.   &quot;Foothills&quot; and &quot;Sweetheart.&quot;    We talked about how <br/>
hard that must be to read for kids who are looking for phonics blends they have <br/>
learned, instead of looking at the words themselves to see what they seem to <br/>
be made of.<br/>
<br/>
Phonics says to work from front to end, sounding out.    But if a child is <br/>
looking at the whole word and seeing FIRST whether it&#39;s something sensible he <br/>
recognizes in context, he will see those two for the English compound words they <br/>
are, broken between the t and the h.<br/>
<br/>
Simple English one-syllable words are the most commonly used in English.   <br/>
There are tons of the longer words we have from French, Latin and Greek, but <br/>
they&#39;re not the bulk of everyday speech and writing.  They&#39;re the bulk of the <br/>
dictionary, but that&#39;s a different way to count.<br/>
<br/>
I think the more words he knows from watching movies, singing songs, talking, <br/>
playing video games, etc., the easier it will be for him to recognize those <br/>
words when his reading ability DOES kick in.  Holly had a huge vocabulary <br/>
before she could read, so she would as easily have been able to read &quot;vocabulary&quot; <br/>
as &quot;words.&quot;  When it made sense to her, it made sense.   What would have been <br/>
difficult for her in the few sentences above would be &quot;huge&quot; and &quot;singing&quot; and <br/>
&quot;does.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And then, with prompting on my part, he read the rest of the joke with <br/>
ease.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Prompting might not be as helpful as just reading it to him and letting him <br/>
think &quot;I knew that,&quot; if he did.  If he didn&#39;t, pressing him to perform is <br/>
actually pressing him to fail, again.<br/>
<br/>
When he can read he WILL read.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I have yet to meet anyone, either in &#39;real life&#39; or online, who is <br/>
unschooling an autistic child, or any child on the &#39;autism spectrum&#39;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an Asperger&#39;s boy who was in our unschooling group here from the time <br/>
he was 11 or so.  He had been in school and spent the first few meetings <br/>
standing looking intently at the bark of a tree.   One of my boys would check with <br/>
him every twenty minutes or so, and invite him to come and play if they had <br/>
changed games, but they said &quot;That&#39;s okay&quot; happily if he refused.  And after a <br/>
few weeks he started at least turning to watch them, or standing nearer, and <br/>
soon he was playing with them for a while.   Nobody made a big deal of it one <br/>
way or another (I don&#39;t know how his mom was after we weren&#39;t there, but she <br/>
seemed happy in the mom-conversations).    When we moved to a bigger houses and <br/>
meetings were here on cold days, he started staying at our house sometimes to <br/>
play video games, after his mom was gone.   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 18 now, or 19 maybe.  He has taken some classes at the technical school, <br/>
he has had a job for a while (at a grocery store, I think), and is actually <br/>
TALKATIVE!<br/>
<br/>
The squinch-eyed fear he had when he first came out of school is long gone.  <br/>
It helped finding some people who would treat him like a person instead of <br/>
like &quot;a special ed kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now read this word out loud: &quot;magic&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HOW did you pronounce the &quot;a&quot; in &quot;ma&quot; versus &quot;mag?&quot; Why did you change <br/>
it?<br/>
How did you pronounce the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;magi&quot; versus &quot;magic?&quot; Why did you <br/>
change it?<br/>
<br/>
You do NOT read letters within a word from left to right - you HAD to <br/>
know what was on the right of the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;magic&quot; in order to know how <br/>
to pronounce the &quot;i&quot; correctly. You have to look at all the letters at <br/>
once in order to read. Teaching kids to read one letter at a time slows <br/>
down their learning to read - makes it harder.<br/>
<br/>
How do you read &quot;rig&quot; versus &quot;right?&quot; How do you read &quot;fire&quot; versus <br/>
&quot;first&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
You cannot read well by &quot;sounding out&quot; from left to right. It isn&#39;t <br/>
possible.<br/>

My kids love the story I tell them about when I was 7-8 or so and reading some of the books my Dad saved ... Famous Five, Secret Seven etc. - he came over from England when he was 12.  Pretty regularly they would call each other an idiot in jest, which I read as &quot;i-dot&quot;.  It was a while before I heard idiot and realised it was the same word!  They get a good laugh ... and a reminder that everyone makes mistakes ... no big deal!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Ok, I&#39;ll bite.  How else is persevere pronounced?  I was hoping the <br/>
<br/>
dictionary would tell me, but it only has one pronounciation, per-sev-<br/>
<br/>
ear.  Do you mean it&#39;s pronounced per-sev-er-ree, following the Greek <br/>
<br/>
words Persephone or Penelope?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;  Do you mean it&#39;s pronounced <br/>
per-sev-er-ree, following the Greek words Persephone or <br/>
Penelope?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, but that&#39;s a good idea! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a question of whether the stressed syllable is the second one (per SE <br/>
ver) to rhyme with &quot;sever&quot; or on the end, to rhyme with &quot;severe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Americans do it the second way, which might be a communal bit of &quot;reader&#39;s <br/>
vocabulary&quot; or it might not be.   <br/>
<br/>
Americans and Brits  tend to pronounce &quot;harassment&quot; differently too.   <br/>
Americans are heavy on the &quot;ass,&quot; from seeing it written and not hearing it <br/>
pronounced (except by other Americans, I suspect).  Once a few million people have <br/>
settled on a pronunciation, it gains legitimacy no matter how they got the idea <br/>
to pronounce it that way in the first place.  <br/>
