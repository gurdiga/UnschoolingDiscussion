&lt;&lt;....we&#39;re back to his schooled friends! And how THEIR moms would have <br/>
NEVER offered piercings!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Tha&#39;s funy you say that. I see just the opposite here. Of course I am only <br/>
going by the school my oldest goes to. It&#39;s a private pricey school where <br/>
there are tons of kids driving brand new BMW&#39;s. I take it that parents with <br/>
money, I mean lots of it, think that just giving their kids freedom without <br/>
any kind of interaction is best. Most of these parents have no clue what <br/>
their kids are doing and who they are with. Kids are actually taking drugs <br/>
during class.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I digress. I would say at least half of the kids in that school, if <br/>
not more have piercings and tattoos. Their parents have no problem with it, <br/>
not saying I do, just that their meaning behind it is different than mine <br/>
would be.<br/>
<br/>
Tara has each ear done 3 times and her bellybutton pierced.  She wants a <br/>
tattoo but I had to crusade way too hard with her dad for the bellybutton <br/>
ring to let that happen. He&#39;d go ballistic on me if I even mentioned tattoo. <br/>
He thinks I let Tara &quot;get away&quot; with way too much. (btw he&#39;s not my husband)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even funnier! Cameron&#39;s friends are the pricey private schoolers too! &lt;G&gt; But <br/>
things are just TOO conservative here in Columbia, SC. The kids SEEM to have <br/>
freedom, but they don&#39;t. Not at all. Some of the parents are oblivious to <br/>
what&#39;s going on (and the kids encourage that by misleading the parents). The <br/>
&quot;freedom&quot; (in quotes&lt;g&gt;) is hardly what the parents THINK they&#39;re giving. The <br/>
kids are TAKING their own freedoms without &quot;permission&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My niece (at 18) got a tattoo. The Chinese characters for &quot;love&quot; and &quot;joy&quot; <br/>
down her back (Last name&#39;s Lovejoy). She was supposed to get a car to take to <br/>
college. The parents refused to get the car she had been promised because of <br/>
the tattoo. They didn&#39;t learn of the tongue piercing &#39;til MUCH later! &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
Screwy in-laws!<br/>
