example of a difference between the way most of the people here seem to see their <br/>
children and... well...     <br/>
<br/>
Here is it:<br/>
<br/>
                         &quot;What you&#39;re doing to people and children is <br/>
unethical.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My response was that I wasn&#39;t doing anything to people; I&#39;m just writing.<br/>
<br/>
What I probably should&#39;ve added was &quot;children are people,&quot; but I&#39;ve thought <br/>
that way for so long that it seemed not worth saying.   I forget that some <br/>
people are coming at it as a new idea.<br/>
<br/>
Polly Berrien Berends refers to infants as &quot;seeing beings,&quot; and that changed <br/>
my life, when I read While Child/Whole Parent, when Kirby was a baby.   To <br/>
realize so profoundly that his whole, real life was fully in progress changed MY <br/>
whole, real life.  And that&#39;s the purpose of her book, and the meaning of the <br/>
title.    When we help our child to be whole, or rather when we acknowledge <br/>
and honor his wholeness, seeing him as the seeing being he is, then we know that <br/>
we too are, and always were, &quot;seeing beings.&quot;   We are as much a part of that <br/>
child&#39;s world as he is of ours, and we are both part of the same wholeness.<br/>
<br/>
Kinda cosmic. &lt;g&gt;   WHOLLY cosmic.<br/>
<br/>
And in practical terms, if we make a priority of helping to guard the <br/>
integrity of his being, it creates (or rather it helps uncover and restore) an <br/>
integrity and a wholeness in us.<br/>
<br/>
What might this unethical thing be that I&#39;m &quot;doing to people&quot; (including ch<br/>
ildren)?<br/>
Just sharing what I have learned and done with my children, and hearing what <br/>
they&#39;ve learned and done, saving the good parts and recommending other things <br/>
to read/see/hear/consider.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think &#39;unethical&#39; means what he thinks it means.<br/>

Apparently you are hog-tying them to their computer terminals and <br/>
freezing their browsers so that they can&#39;t ever be exposed to any other <br/>
ideas about education than yours. (Imagine the sound of demented <br/>
cackling right here.) And you are disabling their critical thinking <br/>
skills so that they nod as they read every word.  And you probably <br/>
hypnotized them, with your Pokemon powers &lt;g&gt;, so that they&#39;ve forgotten <br/>
anything they might have learned about institutional schooling when they <br/>
(or their kids) were in it.  Their brains are blank slates and you are <br/>
filling them with only your thoughts in an otherwise thought-free <br/>
environment of mindless acquiescence.  (With powers like these, it&#39;s <br/>
amazing the goverment hasn&#39;t commandeered you and put you to work for <br/>
their nefarious purposes.)<br/>

<br/>
All the people on this list live in the real world.   They all have lives<br/>
and jobs and hobbies and family and friends and problems and history.  <br/>
No member of this list is imprisoned here.   Everyone on this list has<br/>
Internet access or e-mail access and that means they can get other news<br/>
and information from other sources.  Most every list member has TV or<br/>
radio or a telephone and can get or get to a newspaper or magazine.  <br/>
Most everyone lives near a town with at least one school.  <br/>
<br/>
The guy who wrote this seems to think y&#39;all are just stuck here, at<br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion with no other people in the whole world to talk to,<br/>
no other way to get any other ideas in your head.  Or maybe he thinks you<br/>
never had other ideas, ever.  Maybe he thinks you can&#39;t leave this list<br/>
and go to another.     <br/>
<br/>
I think he believes you all need to be exposed to *his* ideas.   Those of<br/>
you who feel that need could write to him, he seems perfectly ok with<br/>
*lots* of unsolicited e-mail correspondence. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>

Well, that explains a LOT.   I was kinda mesmerized in Peabody, MA in<br/>
2004 when I heard her speak.  I thought it was her gentle voice and<br/>

<br/>
Oh, ahem, my apologies to the Butterfly people...&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve embraced the Unga Bunga too.   Krisula mentioned the whistle and<br/>
they do that here.   The kids don&#39;t have to get on their knees but they<br/>
are required to squat and stay there until the aid blows the whistle<br/>
again.  <br/>
<br/>
In some martial arts clubs during sparring students will turn away from<br/>
their opponent and get on their knees if they&#39;ve landed a hard blow or<br/>
their opponent seems to be injured.  They don&#39;t get up until the Sensei<br/>
gives the word.   Schools, maybe, want martial arts discipline on the<br/>
playground.  <br/>
<br/>
In the classrooms the teachers use clapping.  Clap, clap, clapclapclap,<br/>
and the kids have to clap the pattern back at the teacher and immediately<br/>
sit down wherever they are.   It&#39;s incredibly creepy to see.  Shivers me<br/>
timbers.  Everyone involved in the school acts as if it&#39;s perfectly<br/>
normal.   And when you force a group of people into a situation they<br/>
don&#39;t want to be in, when they have no power to change the situation or<br/>
opt out the only way to maintain any sense of personal identity is to<br/>
sometimes, or regularly, oppose the power that keeps you there.  So the<br/>
schools need to find a way to keep the inmates from rioting.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad my son is not controlled by whistles and claps.  He uses his own<br/>
good judgement.  I wish I didn&#39;t know how those other kids are treated, I<br/>
wish they weren&#39;t being altered.   I&#39;m sorry the scary, brain washing,<br/>
Direct Instruction stuff spooked Kelly.&lt;g&gt;    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-297997037">What&#39;s ludicrous is the assumption that most of us have not come from an<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s also rather insulting that he assumes that we are not capable of<br/>
evaluating information as we have traveled the path towards and into<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sheltered?!  Isolated?!  We have been called many things, and accused of<br/>
much, but sheltered and isolated are not words that are usually used to<br/>
describe my family.<br/>
<br/>
As far as being &#39;unethical&#39;,  many of us might use the same word to describe<br/>
the coercion and manipulation needed to make many schools work.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s been my observation that most people come to unschooling often as a<br/>
last resort when they&#39;ve tried everything else and that has failed their<br/>
children.  Personally, I discovered unschooling before my children were<br/>
school age.  They just continued learning as they had done before they<br/>
turned 5, with my support. (although over time I came to understand<br/>
unschooling better) They are not sheltered as to the other alternatives out<br/>
there.  They know they are free to go to public school anytime they wish.<br/>
They are also free to choose to learn about anything on the planet with my<br/>
help.  Their world is larger than a classroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-192942039">I&#39;m still 50 some messages behind, but I&#39;m sitting here reading the subject line and message, thinking about the past few hours I&#39;ve spent catching up, and I realize how mesmerized I can become. &lt;g&gt; But the funny *I think, but not ha ha funny,* thing is, someone is watching an episode of Family Guy in the other room. (As annoyingly full of crap and demeaning as it is, I&#39;m always laughing at something.) Peter just told Lois something like he doesn&#39;t have to listen to her because women aren&#39;t real people. And that is the same kind of message we get from people like this. Women aren&#39;t people, children aren&#39;t people. We have to be told what to do and how to do it. And no one should listen to either group. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>

My response was that I wasn&#39;t doing anything to people; I&#39;m just writing.<br/>
<br/>
What I probably should&#39;ve added was &quot;children are people,&quot; but I&#39;ve thought <br/>
that way for so long that it seemed not worth saying.   I forget that some <br/>
people are coming at it as a new idea.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
    This makes me sad... of course he&#39;s not unschooling, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
believe HUMAN BEINGS can discern, not even the grown-up ones.  I&#39;ve not <br/>
met unschoolers who want minions, mindless souls in need of a spoon-fed <br/>
life (if you&#39;re hiding out there, stay hidden!) the most of us (and all <br/>
I&#39;ve met in real life) want the opposite -- real people who think for <br/>
themselves and have a joyful, whole, existence (one they&#39;d gladly repeat <br/>
over and over for all time). <br/>
    I&#39;ve joked about this, even called Sandra *the Doddess* -- but my <br/>
worship of Sandra is for reasons that I doubt this person can <br/>
understand... like the fact that she&#39;s a *real* person who had *real* <br/>
life experiences that sucked (and almost sucked the capacity for joy <br/>
right out of her) and yet she knew/knows that the world can be a better <br/>
place for little humans, so she works (not tries, WORKS) every day to <br/>
ensure her children & *OURS* don&#39;t suffer the consequences of our <br/>
choiceless childhoods. <br/>
    Kelly, this is why Live & Learn is the most amazing conference in <br/>
existence -- it is REAL time with REAL people living REAL lives sharing <br/>
REAL joy -- it is Unschooling in Action.  It is where we can come to <br/>
meet people (of all sizes shapes and ages) and be inspired by their <br/>
reality of unschooling.  I would love for all of the Michaels in the <br/>
world to come along to Albuquerque, put the notepad aside and just *BE* <br/>
there, soaking in the incredible vibes.  THEN, ask about our choices and <br/>
why they matter -- see the proof in the joyous faces of our families, in <br/>
the support we give to one another (even when Sandra isn&#39;t looking &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
the inspiration our children are to one another...<br/>
    To inspire and be inspired (freely exchange the word &quot;challenge&quot;), I <br/>
imagine that is why most of us are here, sharing our lives and our <br/>
thoughts -- with each other and with our families.  I am a better person <br/>
because of this list, I&#39;m even better than that because I&#39;ve reached out <br/>
IRL to people this list and the conference have led me to.  My children <br/>
are happier and healthier than I can imagine I *ever* was (before age 35 <br/>
anyway ;) all because I have the *freedom* to *choose* this lifestyle. <br/>
    The whole wide world is about what unschooling isn&#39;t.  Michael <br/>
didn&#39;t come here and shine a light onto anything new and exciting.  I&#39;ve <br/>
lived the world outside of unschooling and I will carry those scars with <br/>
me forever.  I&#39;m so thankful that unschooling is so very unlike school <br/>
and our school-centric society, I&#39;m glad to be here by choice (and my <br/>
children are, too!). <br/>
    So now that I&#39;ve had done to me whatever it is Michael thinks Sandra <br/>
is capable of doing, I say Thanks, my children say Thanks, and my unborn <br/>
grandchildren say Thanks :) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760219900">Kudos Diana - <br/>
<br/>
That is exactly what I wanted to say in my earlier post about our <br/>
journey to unschooling.  I&#39;m glad we made that journey, however <br/>
painful it was for all of us.  My family is very thankful for this new <br/>
way of life.  I also want to thank all of the people on this list for <br/>
helping us on our journey.  Many of the post are very informative and <br/>
I&#39;m always on Sandra&#39;s site reading new insightful ways so that we can <br/>
be better parents.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and sorry to Rue when I meant Ren, great book by the way.  I&#39;m <br/>
reading it again and sharing some of it with my husband who is not a <br/>

were invited to.   The archives are public; you don&#39;t have to join to read.     <br/>
<br/>
It really put a damper on my morning, even aside from the flat out <br/>
dishonesty.   There has been more unhappiness deposited there in the less-than-a-month <br/>
of its existence than I think all my children together have experienced in the <br/>
past ten years.   I&#39;m so used to life being pleasant and sweet and funny that <br/>
I&#39;m starting to forget what downers some people&#39;s lives can be.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to avoid cynicism and depression and wallowing.   There&#39;s an <br/>
advantage to living as peacefully and merrily as possible.<br/>
<br/>
No, not an advantage.<br/>
<br/>
There are countless advantages to finding the joy in little moments and the <br/>
hope and happiness in big ones.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, most people from the conference love me for my Marty.   They figure <br/>
Marty must be proof of something good.    (Now that so many have met Keith I <br/>
might get less secondary glow as Marty&#39;s mom, but it was nice while it lasted. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
)     <br/>
<br/>
All my kids have been especially happy and busy this week.   Kirby (19) is <br/>
teaching karate four hours a week now (up from one), and supposed to be going to <br/>
adult classes twice a week.   &quot;Supposed to&quot; means is invited and encouraged.  <br/>
 He went Monday for two and a half hours and Wednesday opted out to go to a <br/>
gaming night.   He worked every day this week at Dion&#39;s pizza, at least three <br/>
hours a day too.   Last night he was part of the volunteer set-up crew for a <br/>
Halo tournament at a hotel in town, and was there most of the day.   He didn&#39;t <br/>
come home last night (I didn&#39;t really expect him to), and there was e-mail this <br/>
morning letting me know where he had stayed and that the tournament was <br/>
starting at 10:00 a.m.    He called late afternoon to tell me he was out, one <br/>
friend was still in, and he would pick up the equipment he had loaned when the <br/>
tournament ended or his friend was out, if they didn&#39;t still need it.   I think he <br/>
took one XBox, two TVs and a power strip.<br/>
<br/>
Marty (16) got more computer memory and so his City of Heroes game is working <br/>
better, and he&#39;s been doing that a lot, and working on some leather armor.   <br/>
His part involves sewing.   Keith did some leather tooling on part of it.   <br/>
People at next fall&#39;s conference might get to see it finished.<br/>
<br/>
Holly (14) has been doing some art with new gel pens she got for her birthday <br/>
last week, watching the first season of Third Rock from the Sun (also a <br/>
birthday gift), and chatting with friends online.    She would like to be playing <br/>
Halo2 tonight she said, but Kirby&#39;s XBox is gone.   Twice this week she&#39;s said <br/>
&quot;I really miss Kirby when he&#39;s gone.&quot;   She has started making him food and <br/>
taking it to him.   He doesn&#39;t ask her to, she just notices that he might be <br/>
hungry and makes something they both like.   For years she adored Marty and <br/>
didn&#39;t like Kirby as much, but   lately they&#39;re spending more time together.<br/>
<br/>

He must think us all mindless twits that look to Sandra for all of our<br/>

In order to GET to radical unschooling, one must search high and low,<br/>
read, read, read, question oneself and ones upbringing, question<br/>
everything one EVER believed true about learning and education and<br/>
eventually find their way to unschooling and perhaps some other people<br/>
that understand!!!<br/>
<br/>
I attended 13 years of school, plus a trade school. I was involved in<br/>
the pre-school and kindergarten year of my oldest child...from joining<br/>
the PTA to serving on the Program Delivery Council (an elected<br/>
position), I was INVOLVED. I researched various educational methods<br/>
and found my soul drawn to Montessori, Waldorf and Charlotte Mason. I<br/>
read much of John Holt and thought it made the most sense of anything<br/>
I&#39;d ever read on children and learning. I read Grace Lewellyn and<br/>
decided that humans didn&#39;t need schooling of any kind....only a<br/>
passionate and interesting life of their choosing.<br/>
<br/>
It was a long journey to unschooling for me.<br/>
<br/>
Where on earth does he think the average person is going to find<br/>
unschooling information BEFORE all the school methods and paradigms???<br/>
HOW would that even happen?<br/>
You only get to unschooling after being exposed to other kinds of<br/>
thought....that&#39;s pretty safe to say in our school-saturated world.<br/>
<br/>
I am offended that he thinks so little of my intelligence and every<br/>
thoughtful, mindful person at this list. I am offended that he seems<br/>
to believe we&#39;re thoughtless enough to look to ONE person for all our<br/>
information (that would be a practice shunned by any unschooler I<br/>
know), I am offended that he&#39;s willing to share his low thoughts of us<br/>
in public. <br/>
<br/>
Life&#39;s too short for your negative fixations Mr. Atherton. There&#39;s a<br/>
big grand world out there waiting to be explored. We&#39;ll all be off<br/>
exploring it while you sit around discussing why we shouldn&#39;t allow<br/>
our children to learn by exploring the world with us. Sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi<br/>
   I endured 8 years of English boarding school. My older daughter <br/>
aged 19 was in school for 2 years, tried 2 alternative schools and <br/>
then was home educated like school at home but a bit more relaxed. <br/>
<br/>
Only after my younger daughter was born did we move to an eclectic <br/>
style of home education and she did attend (much to my regret) a <br/>
year of nursery.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only in the last couple of years that we have moved to <br/>
unschooling, it&#39;s been a very long journey. I have found mysefl <br/>
talking to my older daughter a lot about how I feel and have told <br/>
her I regret not knowing about unschooling fully when I was bring <br/>
her up.<br/>
<br/>
I am also an online member of 2 national (UK) home education groups, <br/>
1 local group which I moderate, 1 consultation group to discuss and <br/>
respond to prospective legislation on Home Education, 1 Europe wide <br/>
home education group and of course I also belong to this group.<br/>
<br/>
Offline I belong to one national home education support group, I <br/>
also subscribe to 2 independent home education magazines and am also <br/>
involved with our local home education group which I set up. <br/>
Although we don&#39;t go much now as we prefer to hang out with friends <br/>
at home or at their houses.<br/>
<br/>
I also organise for local home educating families to meet up at an <br/>
Open Lunch event once a month (which is open to everyone) at a place <br/>
called the Open Centre who&#39;s aim it is to promote religious <br/>
tolerance. You get a LOT of view points there as there are a LOT of <br/>
different religions where I live. <br/>
<br/>
I also started a Freecycle group for our city which has over 600 <br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
So what  world do I live in where I only listen to Sandra??  Not to <br/>
say by the way that she isn&#39;t entertaining and interesting. I enjoy <br/>
reading her stuff, not least because she has a sense of humour and <br/>
makes me laugh a LOT. <br/>

a fabulous mom and I made it all happen [1] , but it&#39;s seems even more<br/>

sites.    And on the main unschooling page there&#39;s even (though it was risky <br/>
of me to put it there, I know) a plain old Google.com link.     An escape hatch <br/>
right on the Radical Unschooling page.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so cocky that I think people might still read some of the unschooling <br/>
stuff, even though they COULD bolt at any moment.<br/>

Perhaps I could make a poison kool-aid site and the next time it looks like <br/>
our totally isolated cult might be discovered by some damnably clever person <br/>
from the outside you could all be directed there.   We need a flash cartoon of <br/>
poison-kool-aid preparation, I guess, and a timer so we&#39;ll all know when to <br/>
drink it at the same time.   I suppose that&#39;s doable, but nah--let&#39;s just spend <br/>
the time with our families instead, okay?   <br/>

&gt; Just in case you interpret my last message incorrectly,<br/>
&gt; what I was referring to, was that now that you&#39;ve got<br/>
&gt; people thinking about these things, they are (like<br/>
&gt; the children) going to what to know the other side<br/>
&gt; and they&#39;re going to start looking.   In order to sell<br/>
&gt; &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; you need to shelter people from<br/>
&gt; other perspectives, because it won&#39;t stand close<br/>
&gt; scrutiny.   That&#39;s why you can&#39;t let me post.   What<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re doing to people and children is unethical.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You are free to post this to your list.<br/>
