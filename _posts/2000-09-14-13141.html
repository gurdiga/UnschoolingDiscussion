I was a bit disturbed by the article in &quot;Countryside Magazine&quot; on a<br/>
university just for homeschoolers.  It argued that homschoolers needed a<br/>
special university because they were not ready for the real world.  It also<br/>
suggested that the university would have only selected Christians.<br/>
IMHO the fact that a higher percentage of homeschoolers are getting into<br/>
Harvard, Yale, and other top universities suggests that homeschoolers do not<br/>
need a special university.  And it seems to me that limiting contacts of<br/>
adults to a single religion, race, creed, or any other social limitation<br/>
would delay their preparation for the real world even more.<br/>
IMHO the strongest argument for homeschooling is that future citizens can<br/>
become involved in their communities and society throughout their most<br/>
formative years.  Unlike schoolers they are not shut away in a false<br/>
environment. If they are not ready for the real world by 18 when will they<br/>
be?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481070304">This university isn&#39;t about homeschoolers, it is about Farris raising a<br/>
little army of H$LDA political activists!  Now, that isn&#39;t my opinion, that<br/>
is what he has said.  Well, maybe not with so few words &lt;g&gt;<br/>
