<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought the point was more about the need to speak up strongly when you <br/>
think someone is giving advice that may be potentially harmful to kids. Some <br/>
folks here have very strong feelings about someone insisting there is a <br/>
&quot;right&quot; way to read. They believe it will hurt the many kids who can&#39;t or <br/>
won&#39;t learn in that &quot;right&quot; way. From that point of view, I can follow the <br/>
analogy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yup.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s time to start talking uschooling again and get off the posts <br/>
about posts discussions. Those are always so circular. So what&#39;s going on in <br/>
your unschooling home Denise? :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree that there have even BEEN rude posts in the short time since <br/>
you joined the list. <br/>
<br/>
But, if they do appear overly tactless to you, you might want to consider <br/>
what &quot;Miss Manners&quot; has to say about vigilante etiquette patrols:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Gentle Reader, <br/>
How, pray, were you planning to fight back against rudeness? By bawling this <br/>
person out? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much, but Miss Manners does not need that kind of help in the <br/>
fight against rudeness. You only add to the amount of rudeness in the world <br/>
when you behave that way, and the object is to reduce it. Vigilante etiquette <br/>
patrols are part of the problem, not of the solution.<br/>
<br/>
Members of the public are not authorized to go around teaching one another <br/>
manners; even Miss Manners does not do that.&quot;<br/>
    <br/>
     <br/>
Let&#39;s stop the finger-pointing and just talk about unschooling, whaddya say?<br/>

&gt; Ned Vare<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In fact, the book is really called: Hey! I&#39;m Reading!: A How-To-Read Book for <br/>
Beginners. I think the confidence stuff comes in because it gets kids <br/>
actually reading quickly - using a variety of strategies (see the six listed <br/>
below) and that USING various different strategies, some of which will work <br/>
better, at first, than others, for different kids, they gain confidence and <br/>
that supports them as they keep working on learning more. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here is a description of the book: <br/>
<br/>
****Learning to read is a big step for anyone. Betty Miles demystifies the <br/>
process by revealing the secrets behind one of life’s most important and <br/>
enjoyable skills. Hey! I’m Reading! is for children who are just getting <br/>
ready to read — and for the parents, relatives, teachers, and friends who <br/>
want to help them. Part 1 tells beginners how much they already know about <br/>
reading and includes 10 simple questions children can answer for themselves <br/>
to see if they are ready to use the book. Part 2 introduces new readers to <br/>
six skills all readers use to decode words. Part 3 features short stories, <br/>
poems, and puzzles so beginners can try out their new skills. Armed with <br/>
confidence, skills, and practice, children will delight in finding that they <br/>
are reading!****<br/>
<br/>
Here are the 6 steps in the &quot;how-to&quot; part of the book -- the book is written <br/>
directly to the kids, by the way, assuming parents are there to help out.<br/>
<br/>
***********<br/>
<br/>
1. Getting help from pictures. A picture can help to tell you what the words <br/>
say. <br/>
 2. Remembering. You remember some words because you see them over and over. <br/>
3. Sounding out the letters. The sounds of the letters in a word can help you <br/>
to read it. <br/>
4. Expecting what comes next. Expecting words to come along makes you ready <br/>
to read them. <br/>
 5. Writing. Writing words is good practice for reading them. <br/>
6. Making sense. If what you read makes sense to you, you&#39;re probably reading <br/>
it right. <br/>

It is written specifically for classroom teachers - basically says that we <br/>

educating kids. It was too expensive for me to buy -- &quot;Teaching With the <br/>
Brain in Mind&quot; was the title. But one thing it talked about was that kids are <br/>
so RESTRICTED - just in physical movement - that he considers that many <br/>
learning disabilities, including dyslexia, may be directly a result of <br/>
children NOT having enough large motor movement when they are from 1 to 3 <br/>
years old. He says, for example, that in 1960 2 yo&#39;s spent about 200 hours in <br/>
a car (not in a car seat, either). In a recent year - (1999?) they spent 500 <br/>
hours strapped in carseats. He says parents don&#39;t &quot;make up for&quot; the loss of <br/>
movement-time --- even though there is lots of evidence that points up the <br/>
importance of physical movement on brain development in those first few years <br/>
of life.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more. Great book. I&#39;d like to hear the author speak to <br/>
homeschoolers sometime.<br/>
<br/>
He talks about how brain development is dependent on appropriate amounts of <br/>
challenge and how difficult that is to create in a classroom -- I just wanted <br/>
to YELL right there in the bookstore -- THE KID WILL KNOW how much challenge <br/>
is optimal - let them work it out themselves!!!! Give them freedom and <br/>
they&#39;ll challenge themselves JUST RIGHT!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551362460">sounds like a very interesting book.. it is so frustrating to me to think that schools so totally ignore these things..<br/>
<br/>
schools are better than home for a LOT of kids... too many kids find more stability and safety there than in their own homes and i am glad they have schools to go to.. if only the educational systems paid more attention to SCIENCE... PSYCHOLOGY... RESEARCH.... instead of politics and the effort to keep their jobs easy and stable.. it is so sad.. and then the teachers that DO pay attention to the way kids really learn.. well they are so successful they end up in some admin job away from students, but not powerful enuf to make any difference..anyway this is what i&#39;ve seen around here lately from working within the system and dealign with it from the outside for my older son..<br/>

<br/>
The book is about pointing out to the child that wants to read that <br/>
he or she indeed does not need to be &quot;taught&quot; because they already <br/>
have the skills for reading. All they need to do now is practice. I <br/>
highly recommend you give it a look.<br/>
<br/>
As for the 6 ways to read:<br/>
1. Getting help from pictures<br/>
2. Remembering<br/>
3.Sounding out letters<br/>
4.Expecting what comes next<br/>
5.Writing<br/>
6.Making sense<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it explains these but if I write all of it I might as well <br/>
charge y&#39;all for transcribing the book. It costs $7.99 and it is a <br/>
great resource. Public libraries may have hardcover version.<br/>

  Ned,<br/>
<br/>
  The book is about pointing out to the child that wants to read that <br/>
  he or she indeed does not need to be &quot;taught&quot; because they already <br/>
  have the skills for reading. All they need to do now is practice. I <br/>
  highly recommend you give it a look.<br/>
<br/>
  As for the 6 ways to read:<br/>
  1. Getting help from pictures<br/>
  2. Remembering<br/>
  3.Sounding out letters<br/>
  4.Expecting what comes next<br/>
  5.Writing<br/>
  6.Making sense<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, it explains these but if I write all of it I might as well <br/>
  charge y&#39;all for transcribing the book. It costs $7.99 and it is a <br/>
  great resource. Public libraries may have hardcover version.<br/>

<br/>
  &gt;Liza writes about a book that:<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;  talks about the SIX WAYS (Ned,<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;are you counting) we learn to read and one of them is (Yes, Ned) by<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;&#39;sounding out words&#39;.&lt;&lt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Ned asks:   Does it just talk about them or does it describe them? Please,<br/>
  &gt;may we hear about the other five ways?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Liza also writes, about that same book:<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;the last paragraph suggests, it is<br/>
  &gt;&gt;&gt;not a how-to book, but a book about boosting reading confidence&lt;&lt;<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;Ned again: The original question was from Sheila, who asked us what to do<br/>
  &gt;after her son asked her Will you teach me how to read? I thought, perhaps in<br/>
  &gt;my madness, that he wanted to learn HOW TO READ. I don&#39;t remember that<br/>
  &gt;Sheila was asking us for ways to boost his reading confidence, or to give<br/>
  &gt;him more motivation. Those are therapy. He did not need therapy.  He wanted<br/>
  &gt;a skill.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I have nothing against the book, but I have been laboring under the idea<br/>
  &gt;that the discussion is about HOW-TO, not *Gee, reading sure is fun if you<br/>
  &gt;can just somehow get the hang of it.* He needs the hang of it. He&#39;s got a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another point.  Good readers use all or most of those 6 ways at various <br/>
times.  Poor readers restrict themselves to one or two.  My friend has a <br/>
boy (schooled) who can decode perfectly all day.  But he doesn&#39;t *get* what <br/>
he has read.  What he&#39;s mastered is the mechanics of phonics and decoding <br/>
words, and it hasn&#39;t turned him into a reader.  *Now* they&#39;re getting him <br/>
working on the other 5 ways.<br/>
