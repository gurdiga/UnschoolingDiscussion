My hsing friend has taken a part-time position for the Census.  Since she is<br/>
reliable, sensible and smart, she has moved up the ranks rather quickly and<br/>
is now in a managerial position and is making about $17/hr.<br/>
<br/>
That my friends, is a pay rate I would like for a part-time/temp job.<br/>
