<br/>
<br/>
I just joined one that mentioned workbooks and television and I left it <br/>
because I thought it was a homeschooling list. Lots for us still to discover!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We&#39;re the serious unschoolers! &lt;BWG&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So then would you say that the serious unschoolers are really radical <br/>
unschoolers? I hear that mentioned often also.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;YOU can pick and choose which unschoolers you&#39;d rather &quot;follow&quot;. Here <br/>

<br/>
We went down the workbook, restricting and so on path and we were all <br/>
miserable. I wouldn&#39;t give up this way for anything. The changes in us and it in <br/>
Christopher speak volumes. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Guess I haven&#39;t done much research on other methods or how other unschoolers <br/>
do things. I found this list and have been glued here since. The book sort of <br/>
surprised Kevin and I. We thought this way was the only way. Still do!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Again, unschooling is living as if school didn&#39;t exist---not as if the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-457740695">I didn&#39;t see what &quot;book&quot; this thread is about, but I did visit the <br/>
Leppert site and also the GAil Withrow site, and have a question.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a rhetorical question. Actually, a rant. <br/>
<br/>
She states that unschoolers are dead set against teaching. Hello? I <br/>
teach my kids all the time, just not from forcing them to sit down <br/>
and fill in the blanks or answer arbitrary questions about the <br/>
reading they&#39;re doing. I teach them by talking with them about <br/>
things, doing things and them observing and helping, and sometimes, I <br/>
even teach them by sitting down with them, a piece of paper, a <br/>
pencil, and a...gasp...workbook...so they can practice their cursive <br/>
r&#39;s or their addition facts (and this, tis as the lady claims, is at <br/>
their request. I don&#39;t come up to them and say &quot;today, you learn <br/>
about r&#39;s&quot; but when they find a need to learn how to sign their <br/>
names, and there is an r in there...? THEN)<br/>
<br/>
Having read quite a bit of John Holt and done with him as I do with <br/>
every author (keep what is good, toss what I can&#39;t use), I find his <br/>
ideas about teaching to be reality based. I can&#39;t believe he was <br/>
opposed to teaching, having been an educator himself for how long? I <br/>
know from experience, that you can NOT teach a kid something he is <br/>
not ready to learn...Katie&#39;s reading as my favorite case in point.<br/>
<br/>
Last year at this time, (pre-Natural Learning-days) her every &quot;let&#39;s <br/>
sit down and work on your reading&quot; lesson was a study in pouting, <br/>
hollering, frustration, hatred of the written word, and other very <br/>
negative things. From a kid who usually wants to please. This year, <br/>
she opens up her Nate the Great books and asks me to come over and <br/>
listen to her read. WITH PLEASURE, MY DEAR! :) I &quot;taught&quot; her <br/>
and &quot;taught&quot; her until phonics was coming out my ears...and going in <br/>
one and out the other of HER ears...starting when she was five (the <br/>
age I did phonics w/my other two, who then started reading) It&#39;s <br/>
amazing I didn&#39;t permanently kill her desire to read, with all my <br/>
TEACHING!!!<br/>
<br/>
And guess what? With me sitting next to her and helping her with <br/>
(many) words...I&#39;m STILL TEACHING HER! sheesh. I have nothing against <br/>
teaching, Ms. Gail Windrow LOL sorry...Withrow...rant...matter of <br/>
fact, since learning about Natural Learning, I&#39;m very much more <br/>
attuned to my kids&#39; learning, more on the lookout for teaching <br/>
moments than I EVER was before. Before, it was &quot;do this many pages of <br/>
writing, finish reading that book, and a full problem set of math&quot; <br/>
and if they did the seatwork, they were done. I wasn&#39;t teaching them <br/>
in those days; I was marking their FREAKING papers! And making sure <br/>
they corrected whatever needed it, thus turning their days into <br/>
strongly divided chunks of time: seatwork time, and &quot;cool, get to go <br/>
play&quot; time...which one did they desire the most? three guesses. And <br/>
during which chunk of time did my kids gain knowledge that THEY HAVE <br/>
KEPT? grrrrrr.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I take that back. Robby does know his times tables, thanks to the <br/>
about half an hour of study I &quot;forced&quot; on him, towards the end of our <br/>
Robinson Curriculum days. But why, once he knew the times tables, did <br/>
he have to continue spouting them, day in and day out, a la Robinson <br/>
and Saxon? He had learned them, and today, two years after learing <br/>
them, he still knows them. But Robinson expected him to continue in <br/>
the same vein, ad nauseum. The little twerp DIDN&#39;T LIKE IT. How dare <br/>
he not LOVE all that &quot;learning&quot;? LOL and Robby hasn&#39;t done a single <br/>
bit of sit-down math since about January of this year...except one <br/>
time, near the beginning, when I got nervous and asked him to do some <br/>
long division...L He didn&#39;t know what I was talking about, until he <br/>
saw the problems I had written out for him to solve. Which he did <br/>
without a hitch, and I&#39;ve never looked back since then. <br/>
<br/>
So, the question. Is this list anti-teaching? Is unschooling really <br/>
about a parent not purposely teaching their children anything? If so, <br/>
then I&#39;m doing it wrong, because I do a lot of it in any given day. <br/>
For instance, I purposely taught about cutting up potatoes yesterday. <br/>
And my hubby has purposely taught about chopping wood and laying a <br/>
fire.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the lack of a formal curriculum that makes Ms. Withrow <br/>
nervous. Yet, if it came right down to it, and a kid wanted to know a <br/>
lot about something, I&#39;d lay out a course, based on my experience and <br/>
knowledge...&quot;course&quot; being the English translation of the word <br/>
curriculum. Maybe!!! oh, this is it, I bet. Maybe she wants me to lay <br/>
out that course and set my kids on it, whether they want to learn <br/>
about the topic or not. I have no problem with suggesting a direction <br/>
to my kids, one that I think would interest them and be useful. But <br/>
I&#39;m not going to try and teach something that they aren&#39;t ready to <br/>
learn. And they&#39;ll be ready to learn when they&#39;ve found a need for <br/>
it, from their day to day living. Some of what they need, I&#39;ll teach <br/>
to them. Some, they will learn themselves through experience. And <br/>
some, dare I say it, they will find other mentors to learn from.<br/>
<br/>
*end rant*<br/>

blessings, HeidiC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757460272">-=-Having read quite a bit of John Holt and done with him as I do with <br/>
<br/>
every author (keep what is good, toss what I can&#39;t use), I find his <br/>
<br/>
ideas about teaching to be reality based. I can&#39;t believe he was <br/>

<br/>
know from experience, that you can NOT teach a kid something he is <br/>
<br/>
not ready to learn...Katie&#39;s reading as my favorite case in point.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I was in college and was assigned to read John Holt, the professor told <br/>
me teaching was nonexistent.  There was no action, and that if teaching were a <br/>
legitimate transitive verb, you must be able to affect the object, but that <br/>
all the learning that takes place in a student takes place inside him on his <br/>
terms.  <br/>
<br/>
The term they wanted us to understand and strive to become was &quot;facilitator <br/>
of others&#39; learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a facilitator of a LOT of people&#39;s learning, and have been my whole life. <br/>
 I was the sex-ed source for kids my age from the time I was nine, but I <br/>
never &quot;taught a class&quot; or prepared a lesson.  I answered questions and found <br/>
resources.  I&#39;ve &quot;taught&quot; a lot of people vocal music, but what I did was find a <br/>
song, help them with their parts if they needed help, and then sing with them <br/>
until we were all singing it without thinking very hard and it seemed natural.  <br/>
I&#39;ve helped other people do all kind of things in everyday life because I&#39;ve <br/>
always been good at understanding procedures.   I was facilitating.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So, the question. Is this list anti-teaching? Is unschooling really <br/>
<br/>
about a parent not purposely teaching their children anything?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m against &quot;purposely teaching&quot; if the purpose is to try to wrest learning <br/>
away from a child and turn it to traditional top-down delivery of information <br/>
presented on a schedule.  And for most people, that&#39;s what &quot;teaching&quot; means.   <br/>
I own information and will dole it out to you in 45 minute dollops, and it is <br/>
your DUTY to be attentive and apply yourself to learning, or you have wasted <br/>
your teacher&#39;s time.<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the way it goes?  Teachers aren&#39;t accused of wasting their <br/>
students&#39; time, but students who already know and so are distracted, or can&#39;t fathom <br/>
at all what the guy&#39;s talking about, or who don&#39;t give a damn are accused of <br/>
wasting their teacher&#39;s time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-For instance, I purposely taught about cutting up potatoes yesterday. <br/>
<br/>
And my hubby has purposely taught about chopping wood and laying a <br/>
<br/>
fire.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t know that you &quot;taught&quot; them.  You talked about the best ways and <br/>
the dangers and you demonstrated.  If they already knew you didn&#39;t teach them.  <br/>
If they were wishing really hard to be elsewhere and so won&#39;t remember the <br/>
next time what you said, you didn&#39;t teach them.   If they really wanted to learn <br/>
to cut up potatoes yesterday, they learned.  Your talking and doing was part <br/>
of what they needed to learn.  If you&#39;re sure you taught, try teaching your <br/>
dog, or a kid who can&#39;t use her hands at all, or someone who sees a knife and <br/>
just wants to kill you with it and leave a message spelled out in potato-parts.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe it&#39;s the lack of a formal curriculum that makes Ms. Withrow <br/>
<br/>
nervous. Yet, if it came right down to it, and a kid wanted to know a <br/>
<br/>
lot about something, I&#39;d lay out a course, based on my experience and <br/>
<br/>
knowledge...&quot;course&quot; being the English translation of the word <br/>
<br/>
curriculum.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Course&quot; is  where horses run.  You set a course, and you  make each horse <br/>
follow it in the same direction.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Maybe!!! oh, this is it, I bet. Maybe she wants me to lay <br/>
<br/>
out that course and set my kids on it, whether they want to learn <br/>
<br/>
about the topic or not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well DUH! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But I&#39;m not going to try and teach something that they aren&#39;t ready to <br/>
<br/>
learn.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you&#39;re against teaching, because part of what she means is the <br/>
parent is in charge of when and what.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like your an unschooler who understands that a kid who&#39;s ready WANTS <br/>
to learn and will appreciate help, and that trying to teach a child something <br/>
he doesn&#39;t want is going to hamper unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
People who want to be the teachers need to dislike unschoolers and find us <br/>
wrong and lazy.  If they see or admit that our kids are doing well and we&#39;re <br/>
spending quite a bit of energy and thought making sure that&#39;s true, then they <br/>
have a choice and they&#39;ve chosen something difficult and somewhat unworkable.   <br/>
Then they&#39;re mad at us for having more fun.<br/>
<br/>
This, I think, was the author&#39;s gut-level premise:<br/>
If two ways both work, the one that&#39;s least fun must be the most moral.<br/>
If it tastes bad it must be good for you.<br/>
If it feels good, don&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much easier to condemn people who are having more fun than you are.<br/>
<br/>
But back to teach/learn, here&#39;s why I think clarity about the difference is <br/>
important, and I saved it in a more permanent place than these e-mails:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938382582">You know what&#39;s funny...before coming across a &quot;late starting reader&quot; <br/>
I was a &quot;purely phonics&quot; type, believing all the writing out there <br/>
about how you must teach reading by phonics, or they won&#39;t learn how <br/>
to read. Deep, analytical, take it apart and put it back together, <br/>
type phonics (love it! L)<br/>
<br/>
But Katie taught me that all the phonics in the world is totally <br/>
useless to a brain that isn&#39;t ready to read. <br/>
<br/>
My kids also taught me that, if they&#39;re not into it, they aren&#39;t <br/>
going to learn. KONOS is a cool curriculum, jam-packed with hands-on <br/>
ideas about TONS of subjects. Heavy on History and Natural Science. <br/>
We had the most wonderful times with Medieval History and Eyesight <br/>
and Light, using ideas from KONOS...and then I decided it was time to <br/>
learn about plants.<br/>
<br/>
wow! even my little scientist Abbie was &quot;no thanks.&quot; and all my <br/>
wonderful plans for them simply fizzled out. <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say is, when it was all written out and I was <br/>
reading about this stuff: how to make a lesson plan, how to teach <br/>
reading, and the belief that there is knowledge that everyone needs <br/>
to have and it is my job to hand them that knowledge...well, when I <br/>
was merely reading/preparing for educating my kids, I was in total <br/>
agreement with that philosophy. When I actually got into it and was <br/>
doing/trying to do what was shown forth by &quot;the experts&quot;...it was a <br/>
different story altogether. My kids taught me this much: learning <br/>
comes from them, not from me. When I finally grasped that, and let go <br/>
of the idea that *I* and *I alone* must be their teacher, is when we <br/>
began to be joyful and happy with each other. Wanting to be together, <br/>
we spend time trying new things, doing old favorite things, visiting, <br/>
hanging out...what&#39;s not to love? LOL<br/>

I just love this statement:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, unschooling is living as if school didn&#39;t exist---not as if <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the WORLD <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; didn&#39;t!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ~Kelly<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Talk about a great little reminder for me when I start to feel <br/>
uncertain.  Although, it seems things are finally clicking here.  I <br/>
finally get things that I was still trying to grasp early this <br/>
year.  I can see the learning full circle around us.  For example, <br/>
my son is playing Zelda with his Dad.  In this version you sail a <br/>
boat and have to decide how to navigate it based on a map with <br/>
islands.  Here is my 5yo figuring out which way to go and I thought <br/>
that has to beat those stupid map worksheets we used to do in <br/>
school.  Remember, you are here, the school is 2 blocks north, blah, <br/>
blah, blah.  There is no decision to teach maps, it is just <br/>
happening as we play.    Pretty cool. <br/>
