<div id="ygrps-yiv-277773034">Don&#39;t stop saying thank you in person, but I&#39;ve returned four posts in  <br/>
just the past few days that were thank you&#39;s to the list or to one  <br/>
person about one post.  Here&#39;s a really sweet one.  I&#39;ll let it  <br/>
represent the others:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m behind on emails and new to this group, but just have to shout  <br/>
out a big THANK YOU for all these great ideas!!!  Wow, they rock!   <br/>
Some are just little things I haven&#39;t thought of for a while.  I made  <br/>
a list to save!<br/>
Thanks a bunch!-=-<br/>
<br/>
The list is big and busy.  Each and every time anyone posts, please  <br/>
let it be a question about unschooling, a suggestion or a personal  <br/>
story, or something interesting about unschooling that will help MANY  <br/>
people on the list--dozens or hundreds.<br/>
<br/>
Let us all continue to assume that the ideas are good and that people  <br/>
who get good ideas are grateful and will think about them.   It&#39;s not  <br/>
rude not to write to a thousand people and say &quot;thanks!&quot;  I don&#39;t want  <br/>
to be returning so many posts.  So if anyone wants to say LOL or Me  <br/>
too! or Good idea or Thanks, then you need to wrap that up in a good  <br/>
story about how it helped you at your house, or something your kids  <br/>
have done lately that might not have done if not for unschooling.    <br/>
Something substantial and useful.<br/>
<br/>
And then, others, don&#39;t write and say &quot;thanks for writing that.  I  <br/>
agree.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Think your gratitude, and take that warm feeling and do something nice  <br/>
for someone at your house.<br/>
<br/>
