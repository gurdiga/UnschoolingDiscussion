<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Of course, we ensure they do some of the 3R&#39;s each day. For instance, we<br/>
&gt; require our daughter to write in her journal daily. And math is a daily<br/>
&gt; kitchen table event.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;m misunderstanding something here, but is requiring someone to write<br/>
&gt; in a journal really unschooling?  I&#39;m not sure what he means about the math.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t consider requiring a child to write in a journal every day<br/>
unschooling.  If your child wants to write in a journal every day, that&#39;s<br/>
his or her choice.  More power to &#39;em.  But requiring, no.<br/>
<br/>
I easily see what he means about the math.  They unschool &quot;except for math&quot;,<br/>
for which they use a curriculum.  I wouldn&#39;t think of that as unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But even if you use a curriculum, why the kitchen table?  Why not on the<br/>
floor in the living room, in a treehouse, on a porch swing, or in bed?  And<br/>
how does he find room on his kitchen table for math every day, anyhow?  Mine<br/>
is often completely burried.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are so organized they worry me.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; get filled quick! HELP<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always have this problem too. I put some stackable plastic drawers on<br/>
wheels in my pantry, and labeled each drawer. DDs can move the stuff to<br/>
where they are working, and everything has its place when they are done<br/>
(not that the stuff ever finds its place). They also have a Little Tykes<br/>
table that they work at. In the summer time it is on the deck, and in the<br/>
winter it is in the kitchen. When this table starts overflowing, they<br/>
move to the kitchen table, which quickly gets lost.  I thought I had this<br/>
problem solved last week when we replaced our rickety, small,<br/>
hand-me-down table with a HUGE heavy duty, solid wood hand-me-down table.<br/>
Nope! Just found more stuff to pile on it!lol. The one thing that has<br/>
reduced some clutter, though, is giving each of my children a box with<br/>
their name on to store their finished masterpieces in. So pictures stay<br/>
up on the fridge for a couple of weeks, then get moved to the box or<br/>
thrown out, whatever they decide. 3 dimensional projects were another<br/>
story. We just can&#39;t keep them all, so they keep their favorites, and I<br/>
take photos of them with the others, and then they keep the photos in<br/>
their special boxes. A little bit of organization goes a long way,<br/>
especially in a house like mine where *nobody* likes to throw *anything*<br/>
away.<br/>
