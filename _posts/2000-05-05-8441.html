<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Just received the following from a good friend here in Dallas:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This information is from a report by the Associated Press that was<br/>
&gt; forwarded to me a few minutes ago by a member of this email list.  I  have<br/>
&gt; received 7 warnings so far today about the &#39;Love&#39; Virus.  In addition, a<br/>
&gt; friend just informed me that his entire computer has just been wiped<br/>
&gt; out.  The first lines alone are enough to suggest extreme caution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The source of this article<br/>
&gt; is:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/403350.asp?0a=2107110-">http://www.msnbc.com/news/403350.asp?0a=2107110-</a><br/>
&gt; The site contains additional information on this virus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; THE STATISTICS ARE STAGGERING. Nearly 30<br/>
&gt; percent of businesses in Great Britain, and nearly 80<br/>
&gt; percent in Sweden, have been infected by the virus,<br/>
&gt; according to anti-virus research firm Network Associates.<br/>
&gt; In fact, the company says, ATM cash machines in Belgium<br/>
&gt; were knocked offline thanks to the deluge of e-mail traffic<br/>
&gt; created by the virus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many companies â and even the Army and the Navy<br/>
&gt; â have resorted to simply shutting down their e-mail<br/>
&gt; system while the virus worms its way around the Internet.<br/>
&gt; âThis is the worst Iâve ever seen in my nine years in the<br/>
&gt; business,â* said Mikko Hypponen, manager of anti-virus<br/>
&gt; research at F-Secure Corp. âWe actually donât know why<br/>
&gt;   itâs so widespread, why itâs spreading so fast.â*<br/>
&gt; For example, one European magazine has lost its<br/>
&gt; photograph archive, and the U.K.âs House of Commons<br/>
&gt; closed down its e-mail systems temporarily over concerns<br/>
&gt; about the virus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The virus targets users of Microsoft Outlook and only<br/>
&gt;   works under the Windows operating system. (Microsoft is a<br/>
&gt; partner in MSNBC.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Internet users are advised to update their virus scanning<br/>
&gt; software as soon as possible. But throughout the day,<br/>
&gt; anti-virus Web pages have been swamped with traffic and<br/>
&gt; largely unreadable. So for now, the best bet is to avoid<br/>
&gt; opening attachments entirely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Researchers say the technology that spreads the virus is<br/>
&gt; no smarter than that of previous viruses, leaving them a bit<br/>
&gt; baffled over LoveLetterâs worldwide rapage. One possible<br/>
&gt; reason â victims canât resist opening an attachment that<br/>
&gt; claims to be a love letter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; âOnly human nature to want to open a letter that leads<br/>
&gt; off with âI love you,ââ* said David Perry, public education<br/>
&gt; director at anti-virus research firm Trend Micro. He also<br/>
&gt; suspects that because itâs been several months since the last<br/>
&gt; virus scare, computer users are a bit more gullible than they<br/>
&gt; were perhaps a year ago, in the wake of the Melissa virus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The file attachment is called âLOVE LETTER FOR<br/>
&gt; YOU.TXT.vbs,â* which might also be adding to the<br/>
&gt; confusion for consumers. It offers the appearance of being a<br/>
&gt;   harmless text file, and the âvbsâ* extension, which stands for<br/>
&gt; Visual Basic Script, may also mislead users who are now<br/>
&gt; trained to be skeptical of executable files with the extension<br/>
&gt; .exe.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; WHO IS BEHIND THE VIRUS?<br/>
&gt; In the virusâs source code, an individual named<br/>
&gt; âspyderâ* takes credit for authoring the program. Hypponen<br/>
&gt; said the name is unknown on the virus scene.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In a bit of programming understatement, the code<br/>
&gt; contains a comment, likely by the author, suggesting the<br/>
&gt; virus is âsimple but i think this is good.â*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The code also references Manila, Philippines, but that<br/>
&gt; doesnât necessarily indicate the author lives there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are no other hints as to who âspyderâ* might be<br/>
&gt; other than this cryptic message within the code: âbarok<br/>
&gt; -loveletter(vbe) âi hate go to schoolâ*.â*<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many European computer systems shut down e-mail<br/>
&gt; servers Thursday. Britainâs House of Commons was the<br/>
&gt; latest U.K. organization to succumb to the virus. The lower<br/>
&gt; House of Commons shut down its e-mail system for about<br/>
&gt; two hours to safeguard against the virus.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Britainâs Consumers Association and a major anti-virus<br/>
&gt; firm said they also had been bombarded by calls from<br/>
&gt; businesses whose e-mail servers had been hit by a blizzard<br/>
&gt; of messages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; British Internet service provider Freeserve said it had<br/>
&gt; set up a filter to screen out any e-mails with the words âI<br/>
&gt; love you.â*<br/>
