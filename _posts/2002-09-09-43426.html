&lt;&lt; How do you all balance the needs of different kids? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve got four, so it&#39;s definitely a challenge at times.<br/>
Last night, after I got home from work (working creates a whole &#39;nother set <br/>
of dynamics and neediness) the baby was exhausted because Daddy can&#39;t nurse <br/>
him to sleep. So after he napped a bit and woke up really cranky, Trevor was <br/>
really antsy about going up to Target to buy a gameboy game that he&#39;s been <br/>
wanting.<br/>
I really wanted to take him. He&#39;s been babysitting his younger sibs some and <br/>
I really owed him anyway.<br/>
But here&#39;s this tired cranky baby that needs to be home. So we waited. I told <br/>
Trevor I would have to see...that I could not go up to the store if he was <br/>
still cranky, and I wouldn&#39;t leave him with Daddy again since he just got me <br/>
back after being gone at work.  It would have upset him too much if I walked <br/>
out the door again.<br/>
So we fed Jalen, we waited some more, I nursed him again. And he started <br/>
being less cranky. Pretty soon he was getting his shoes out (heard us talking <br/>
about leaving) and was ready to go. So I got to meet everyone&#39;s needs. But it <br/>
is a balancing act.<br/>
While at the store I had to put Jared off over something he wanted because I <br/>
didn&#39;t have enough money.  I promised to buy it later this week, after <br/>
payday. He was fine with that.<br/>
<br/>
I think with two little ones it can be harder. They do get less needy as they <br/>
get older, or needy in different ways at least. <br/>
Do you have any way to spend time alone with each of them weekly? This is a <br/>
very important thing in our house. Time alone with one parent greatly reduces <br/>
their feelings of rivalry for attention.<br/>
Find some really cool activity for one of them and deal with the one that is <br/>
needing you at that moment. <br/>
Rice bins are a great distractor, as is water play, bubble blowing and music.<br/>
Fill up the kitchen sink with water and dishsoap and let them put some <br/>
kitchen tools in and play.  Water is hugely calming to a child also.<br/>
Put on music and take turns dancing with them.<br/>
Watch a movie together.<br/>
Get out a pile of paper, crayons, pens, glitter glue and make art together. <br/>
Your doing the project with them is more calming than if you leave them on <br/>
their own doing it.<br/>
Hope some of this helps.<br/>

With my first three kids, the &quot;terrible two&#39;s&quot; started at about a year and a <br/>
half and lasted for about a year and then all was smooth sailing. Now with <br/>
this last one, it seems to be the same way, sure hope 3 isn&#39;t any worse!!! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-543233878">Mine are also  4.5 yrs apart - now 5 and 9. I agree that this is a tough age <br/>
gap because their interests are so different, and reading out loud is <br/>
especially difficult because of varying interests and attention spans. <br/>
However, mine have become very good friends -- the older guy is a <br/>
responsible older brother, the younger one prefers his company to anyone <br/>
else&#39;s, and they love to play games together (video, cards, imaginary, <br/>
chasing, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
It is really hard to feel like you don&#39;t have time for what everyone needs. <br/>
That includes kids, husband and coworkers. To say nothing of oneself -- <br/>
another topic altogether. I  have had to make what once seemed like major <br/>
compromises. When I worked at night, I used to read stories at breakfast <br/>
because I wasn&#39;t home at bedtime. Today, by the time work and dinner were <br/>
over, it was dark, but the guys wanted to go to the park so we went, in the <br/>
dark. (It was fun -- we had it to ourselves.) Their dad is home with them <br/>
during the day, but of course since I&#39;ve been gone all day, there&#39;s a <br/>
thundering race to the front door when they hear my key in the lock and then <br/>
a wrestling match to see who can hug me first (the upside of a job outside <br/>
the house!).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should feel bad about giving one less attention if the <br/>
other needs more for the moment. It balances out over time. The reality is <br/>
that people have to satisfy their own needs sometimes and often must wait <br/>
for what they need. The family is an organic unit and parts  must always <br/>
accommodate each other.<br/>
<br/>
And the younger child makes up for less parental attention with all that <br/>
sibling attention. They learn a lot from their older siblings.<br/>
<br/>
Our younger child has definitely gotten less of the concentrated attention <br/>
than his older sibling did. I can&#39;t say he&#39;s worse off for it. He&#39;s learned <br/>
to find things to do on his own and he&#39;s much more self-sufficient and <br/>
easy-going than our older one, who always seemed to need someone to help him <br/>
figure out how to keep busy.<br/>

Siblings WIthout RIvalry put me in mind of another book that might be<br/>

of this book talks about stopping negative behavior in ways that<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918368727">I have a problem I&#39;ve been trying to work on for quite awhile. I&#39;m not having much luck and would love any input.<br/>
<br/>
My 2 middle children are 13 months apart. They generally get along quite well with each other. <br/>
<br/>
For the past few months now, Sierra (8) has been very insensitive to Joseph (9) and his feelings. She basically blows him off when she promises him she will play what he would like to play. <br/>
<br/>
They will each want to play different things. Sierra will get Joseph to play what she wants, promising him she will play his game after. Then when the time comes, she changes her mind. Joseph is not a cryer and she has been bringing him to tears lately. He feels like she just doesn&#39;t care about him at all. He wonders how she can be so mean to him. <br/>
<br/>
Everything I have tried and said so far has made no difference. Joseph will just stop playing with her to try and make her see what she&#39;s doing but eventually he will want to play with her enough to give in. Then she&#39;ll blow him off again. <br/>
<br/>
She seems to understand when I explain to her how he&#39;s feeling, but not enough to stop doing what she does. She doesn&#39;t do this with anyone else but Joseph. In fact, when she plays with groups of kids, she&#39;s the one that never has a problem with anyone else. <br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t seem to find a solution. She seems to not care that&#39;s it&#39;s a big deal to Joseph and he&#39;s heartbroken at least once or twice a week over this. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not like that with her at all and she hardly ever complains about anything he does to her. She loves playing with him, but when he gets upset, she&#39;ll find someone else to play with or just play alone. We&#39;re big on not making promises here just because so I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s no big deal to her. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m totally out of ideas. <br/>

Change is the only real constant, and girls tend to mature faster than boys <br/>

Can you try to do some things with both of them in the next few weeks to see <br/>
if you can feel the problem?  Maybe sitting right between the two of them <br/>
you&#39;ll catch the clues that neither of them are seeing or feeling.  You might be <br/>
able to feel what she might have perceived just before she got impatient.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s just zippier and has a shorter attention span?  I&#39;m that way, <br/>
especially in the mornings.  Does time of day matter?  Could you ask her to do <br/>
something with him first?  And maybe he&#39;s expecting half an hour and she can <br/>
only do ten minutes.   Maybe if it is a matter of attention span you could warn <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Can you get boys over to play with him?  She shouldn&#39;t really need to be his <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sandra I appreciate your outlook on this. I guess I posted maybe at the<br/>
wrong time for more advice. &lt;bg&gt; I have spoken with her about what she does<br/>
and how he feels because of it. I&#39;m sure she doesn&#39;t do it on purpose. I do<br/>
think maybe she is in a change right now and he isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Can you try to do some things with both of them in the next few weeks to<br/>
see<br/>
 if you can feel the problem?  Maybe sitting right between the two of them<br/>
 you&#39;ll catch the clues that neither of them are seeing or feeling.  You<br/>
might be<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Yes maybe that would help. I guess feeling like I&#39;m there while watching<br/>
through the kitchen wouldn&#39;t give me the same insight as sitting among them.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s being a bit too strict for her play. That&#39;s very possible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Maybe she&#39;s just zippier and has a shorter attention span?  I&#39;m that way,<br/>
 especially in the mornings.  Does time of day matter?  Could you ask her to<br/>
do<br/>

can<br/>
 only do ten minutes.   Maybe if it is a matter of attention span you could<br/>
warn<br/>
 him.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first thing here is very very true for her. She doesn&#39;t have the<br/>
attention span that Joseph has. I didn&#39;t think that maybe he&#39;s just playing<br/>
way too long and intensely for her. Very possible. Time of day doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter. He has asked for her to play with him first and that works for<br/>
awhile and then it gets switched around and she blows him off again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Can you get boys over to play with him?  She shouldn&#39;t really need to be<br/>
his<br/>
 dependable play-buddy.  I know it&#39;s only a year or three before he might<br/>
not<br/>
 want her to play with him anyway, but as transition, if he&#39;s got a better<br/>
 alternative, that will give her the space she might be needing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That could be a problem too. Joseph doesn&#39;t have any friends that are just<br/>
his. He has a few from sports camp but it&#39;s very hard for me to get together<br/>
with them. They are school at homers and just don&#39;t have much *play* time<br/>
during the week. Weekends seem to be family time for them and us. I&#39;ll have<br/>
to work more on maybe seeing if that could happen though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for seeing what I haven&#39;t.<br/>

I remember telling my sister and brother that Mom & Dad should have stopped at one child, very smug in the knowledge that would have been me!  It was one sure way to really tick off my sister in particular!<br/>

Maybe it&#39;s because I am the oldest and was always the oldest that my siblings <br/>
have never treated me as less than their &quot;sister&quot;.  Not to say we have always <br/>
agreed on everything, or even close.  They might even have said, &quot;She is my <br/>
adopted sister&quot; but not within my hearing.<br/>
<br/>
As a young girl/teenager, even before I KNEW I was adopted I used to say that <br/>
all the time to people that would say how different my sister next youngest <br/>
to me were from each other.  I later found out why my mother cringed every time <br/>
she heard me say that.  She apparently would think someone had &quot;let out the <br/>
secret&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why it was a secret, I don&#39;t care, that&#39;s my mom&#39;s stuff to deal <br/>
with.  I just know from the adopted side of the fence how it would sting to <br/>
know that I was referred to in different words than my siblings.<br/>
<br/>
Of course we are all white, the birth children have black hair and dark dark <br/>
eyes and dark skin.  I have very white skin, red hair and green eyes, so to a <br/>
big extent I did look very different from all the other kids in the family <br/>
too.  I know that can&#39;t compare with children who are completely a different <br/>
ethnicity though.<br/>
<br/>
I was also different in many many ways than any of my parents &quot;birth <br/>
children&quot;.  I was the &quot;perfect&quot; child that always had felt the inner need to do <br/>
everything to perfection and to NEVER do anything that might cause anyone distress <br/>
or heck, just avoid anything that even seemed wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The birth kids were hell raisers, trouble makers, lazy, disrespectful and <br/>
just a nightmare at times.  My parents hardly noticed for the most part.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you are right, maybe there is a distinction in how you love children <br/>
that are adopted or are your birth children.  Maybe no matter how much I don&#39;t <br/>
want there to be that, there will always be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to believe that if I am able to adopt a child that I would love that <br/>
child equally as any I gave birth to.  Maybe the circumstances would have to <br/>
be just right for that to happen.  Maybe older children wouldn&#39;t be the same.  <br/>
Lots of maybes, I can only say what I know or feel from my side of the fence. <br/>
 Maybe because I know how it would feel I&#39;d be better at it, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve examined this, I know there were major differences in how the four <br/>
of us were treated.  I found lots of reasons for this, mainly me just not <br/>
being &quot;good enough&quot; but those were the years when I knew nothing about joining <br/>
that family at age 3.5.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that are adopted or are your birth children.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think that is what Ren is saying.  As an adoptive mom, I personally<br/>
know that it isn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
But kids who were adopted, particularly at an older age, have an entirely<br/>
different &quot;story&quot; than kids who were born into the family.  There is the<br/>
loss of the birthfamily, even for those adopted as infants.  The wonderings<br/>
of &quot;what if&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There are different genetics at work.  We have very close relationships with<br/>
our kids&#39; birthfamilies and it is bizarre to me how much genetics is a<br/>
factor in who kids are.<br/>
<br/>
I think what Ren was saying is that the EXPERIENCE is different, not that<br/>
the love is.<br/>

There are over six billion people on earth.  They&#39;re all different.  We can&#39;t <br/>
legislate or wish or prove or prevent much of anything concerning that many <br/>
people.  What an individual wants or believes won&#39;t change facts, and few facts <br/>
are universal.<br/>
<br/>
Given that there are lots and LOTS of different factors, instead of us trying <br/>
to come to consensus (not possible; not necessary) or judge one thing better <br/>
or worse than another, or a parent wrong or right, let&#39;s just tell our own <br/>
personal stories here in ways that might reveal factors and concepts for others <br/>
reading to add to their own mental checklists of considerations, so if they are <br/>
asked for advice about adoption or fostering they&#39;ll have more to offer than <br/>
just their own personal thoughts and wishes and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
There can be glorious successes.  There can be problems.  We&#39;re not <br/>
discussing whether adoption is always wrong or always right.  We&#39;re discussing under <br/>
which circumstances can it be better or worse.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry if I sounded judgmental of someone else&#39;s experience.  I was just <br/>
trying to say that from my side of the fence (the side of being an adopted <br/>
child) who felt all the connections with her siblings and family, it would hurt to <br/>
know that I had been ALWAYS referred to as the &quot;adopted&quot; child, instead of <br/>
just Glena, the oldest.  I can&#39;t speak for the parents or siblings as to why or <br/>
how they would feel by distinguishing outloud between bio and adopted, I&#39;m <br/>
sorry if I did that.  I can&#39;t possibly know how that would feel.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of other things that hurt me as a child, probably much worse <br/>
than if I had been referred to as the &quot;adopted&quot; child.<br/>
<br/>
I met my bio dad on my 30th birthday.  I had thought there might be some <br/>
&quot;connection&quot;.  There was none.  He was pleasant enough.  He of course had the <br/>
upper hand in the relationship, having known about me my whole life, having had <br/>
updates, having KNOWN me and loved me until I was almost four.  I never knew he <br/>
existed until just before my thirtieth year.  It was strange that this man I <br/>
didn&#39;t know had pictures of me in albums of HIS family.  His children, my half <br/>
siblings, I DID feel very connected to right away.  It was very odd for me, <br/>
still is.<br/>
<br/>
I did, however, always have dreams about some man coming to &quot;take me away&quot; to <br/>
a very nice, very pleasant place, but I thought all children had that dream.  <br/>
Maybe I did remember him on some level as a child and that there had been a <br/>
kind and caring man that sometimes took me to a different safe place.  Maybe it <br/>
was just childish dreams.<br/>
<br/>
I guess if one had enough specific dreams to compare to thoughts from adults <br/>
who were there when the experience might have occurred it could be documented <br/>
as fact, or not.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember a moment when I learned I was adopted and this man on the other <br/>
end of the phone claiming to be my &quot;dad&quot; and knowing all kinds of information <br/>
about me was indeed saying truths, I thought Ahhhh, THAT is why I was treated <br/>
like I was treated, it&#39;s NOT my fault!  I no longer had to try to &quot;fix&quot; or <br/>
change something had no idea about.<br/>
<br/>
Of course my truths about adoption cannot be anyone else&#39;s.  The set of <br/>
circumstances are unique to me and my upbringing, yet there are common threads, I&#39;m <br/>
sure with almost all adoptions as well.<br/>

<br/>

 <br/>
So, were you an adult when you found out you were adopted?  How did you parents keep that a secret?  and why?   It would make some pretty important aspects of a child&#39;s life very confusing to keep a secret like that!  I once dated a man who was 13 when he discovered his Dad was really his adoptive stepdad, and that he had a bio-dad out there.  Things got worse when he learned his bio-dad had been sending gifts and letters for years, only to have his mom return them unopened.  He felt very betrayed by her dishonesty -- to the point that he changed his last name to his bio-dad&#39;s when he turned 18, and went to live with his bio-dad.  <br/>
 <br/>
He also gave me the best piece of advice I ever got as a divorced Mom with an uninvolved ex.  In addition to blocking all contact, his Mom went on to tell him that his bio-dad as a really bad guy.  Now, maybe he had been when they were married, but by the time Mike met him, Dad was a great guy, and they became fast friends.  Mom had zero credibility after that, and Mike had some serious trust issues (last I heard from him he and his wife were in therapy after less than 2yrs of marriage).  <br/>
 <br/>
His advice was to always be fair, even generous, in talking about my ex to my son, because someday he could turn out to be Mr. Wonderful.  Even if he just learned how to look like Mr. Wonderful, it would be enough to leave my son feeling like he&#39;d been lied to.  I always did my best to be fair, to explain to my oldest that we&#39;d both been responsible for the mess things were when he was born, and that I genuinely hoped someday his bio-dad would find the happiness he&#39;d never had in childhood.  As it happens, my ex doesn&#39;t even look like Mr. Wonderful, but that was something my son found out on his own, and it left him free to make his own assessments.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes the best advice comes from wounded survivors.<br/>

<br/>
YES YES YES<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who wondered what to tell her son about his dad.  I said,<br/>
&quot;Listen, just be honest, with no drama or anything.  Someday he&#39;ll realize<br/>
that Dad&#39;s just not terribly mature, but that he does love his son.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, the boy was well under age five when he realized he was more mature<br/>
than Dad.  -sigh-  But they have a close and loving relationship, so that&#39;s<br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
And my parents never said a bad word about each other until I was in my<br/>
20&#39;s.  Dad was annoyed about some tax thing and started mouthing off about<br/>
how my mom was bad with money and was taking something away from me<br/>
and.....I hung up on him.  About three times.  He was so sure that my mom<br/>
and grandparents had been bad mouthing him.  Uhm, no, not even when they<br/>
could have.<br/>
<br/>
First, last and only time I ever heard bad from them.  Made a sucky<br/>
situation better.  Really I think they handled the whole divorce thing with<br/>
a fair bit of grace, all things considered.<br/>

&lt;&lt; So, were you an adult when you found out you were adopted?  How did you <br/>
parents keep that a secret?  and why?   It would make some pretty important <br/>
aspects of a child&#39;s life very confusing to keep a secret like that! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why did they keep it a secret?  I asked my Mom that one time and she just <br/>
replied &quot;because I thought it was best for you&quot;.  Mostly I think it was a secret <br/>
because my bio dad never agreed to me being taken away and adopted and my <br/>
family knew him and I went to live several States away to prevent him from knowing <br/>
apparently.<br/>
<br/>
How unfit would it have been for an unwed FATHER to raise a child in the <br/>
early 1960&#39;s?  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
How did they keep the secret?  Apparently because everyone thought I KNEW and <br/>
didn&#39;t want to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
How was the secret revealed?  Other than my &quot;dad&quot; in younger years in rages <br/>
of punishment telling me I could never be his child (which I never thought <br/>
meant I really WASN&#39;T) and I&#39;d ask my mother about it later and she said he meant <br/>
nothing by it...<br/>
<br/>
In my late twenties I got sick, very sick.  I had an undiagnosed liver <br/>
failure.  The doctors said there were about 80 different diseases with a genetic <br/>
aspect that would cause this.  He wanted a family history of ANY liver problem.  <br/>
I asked my mother she said there were none anywhere in the family.  It was <br/>
Thanksgiving, at my house, I heard my parents in a heated argument in the <br/>
bathroom but couldn&#39;t tell what the problem was.  The next day my adopted dad called <br/>
my DH to come visit him at work.  There he said &quot;her mother would rather her <br/>
die than tell her the truth&quot;, &quot;the truth is that I am not her father, and I <br/>
will tell you who is&quot;.  My Aunt that lived in MI, my birth State had already <br/>
contacted my father and told him what was going on.  That very day as my mother <br/>
walked in my front door my phone rang and a man who said he was my father, Glen <br/>
________ wanted to know what he could do to help me.<br/>
<br/>
Very awkward moment.  I asked him to call back later.  I didn&#39;t say anything <br/>
to my mother at all.  When my DH came home that evening he told me about his <br/>
conversation with my adopted dad and verified the name of the man who had <br/>
called me.<br/>
<br/>
It all happened fairly quickly and it was very difficult at times to try to <br/>
grasp.  When I called the Aunt in MI to ask her what she knew about this man, <br/>
she was very short with me and wanted to know why I was making a &quot;big deal&quot; out <br/>
of this, I have known this information for years and had wanted no part of <br/>
knowing him.  It took me more than half an hour to convince her that I did NOT <br/>
know I was adopted and this was all knew to me.<br/>
<br/>
So on my thirtieth birthday (which I always had felt would be traumatic for <br/>
me, for some reason it signaled OLD to me at the time) I got on an airplane, <br/>
alone and headed for Detroit to meet the man who obviously had loved me very <br/>
much for all my life.  I knew there were TV stations waiting for me on my <br/>
arrival.  The made announcements on the plane.  Several people bought me glasses of <br/>
champagne.  I was grateful and drunk and four hours late and I missed the TV <br/>
crews and am also grateful for that.<br/>
<br/>
They were great, but they had known about me all my life and loved me and I <br/>
did not know them.  The siblings were great and while everyone tried to put me <br/>
at ease, it was hard for me to know how these people seemed so caring when the <br/>
parents I was raised with weren&#39;t even like that.  I had a very hard time <br/>
understanding how this could be so.<br/>
<br/>
As for keeping a secret, I guess the best way to do that is to act like it <br/>
isn&#39;t a secret at all maybe?<br/>
<br/>
It was weird 13 years ago, it&#39;s still weird for me today.  I still can&#39;t <br/>
figure out what was to be gained by a secret like that.  Other than my parents <br/>
KEEPING me, but most of the time it sure felt like I was not wanted there.  Power <br/>
trip, control, that&#39;s probably got a lot to do with it.<br/>
