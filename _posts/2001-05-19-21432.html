<div id="ygrps-yiv-903807849">Yes you are right about cajun being in Acadiana, not New Orleans, my friend. <br/>
Of course, I do not miss the humidity (People here think it is humid also!!. <br/>
. can you imagine??) nor do I miss the fire ants, which I stepped into a big <br/>
pile on Monday. You cannot compare the food from anywhere else to what you <br/>
find in Acadiana, because there is nothing like it anywhere else. <br/>
<br/>
It seems we were in Lafayette at the same time. . .I just left two years ago <br/>
and had been there since 1982. I was unschooling then, but there were really <br/>
no others doing that at that time in the area. I have a daughter who is 12 <br/>
also, or will be on Thursday, and a son who is 22 months. <br/>

If you wanna make the world a better place, take a look at yourself, and then <br/>
make a change.<br/>
