&lt;&lt;   I am not talking about silencing voices.  Please share.  I talking about <br/>
 the way in which some/a few have expressed themselves.  Again, you are <br/>
 determining what others &quot;need&quot; to hear.  Would you do that to an unschooling <br/>
 child and wouldyou do that to a significant other? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you are talking about silencing voices.<br/>
When you say a poster shouldn&#39;t post in the style they&#39;ve written with for <br/>
years and years, that is arrogant.<br/>
People post in their style. It may not be what you like to hear, but others <br/>
do.<br/>
Sandra&#39;s voice may upset some people, but others get a LOT from her. And <br/>
you&#39;re asking her to change her style of posting?<br/>
This, as mentioned before, is an unshcooling discussion list.<br/>
I would assume that anyone coming here wants to discuss ideas and <br/>
philosophies.<br/>
That makes it a whole different playing field than what I&#39;m on with my dh and <br/>
children.<br/>
One would assume that on a discussion list, there is a level of maturity that <br/>
makes difficult discussion possible. If my children voluntarily came to this <br/>
list, I would let them know up front what it&#39;s about and then they better be <br/>
able to handle it.<br/>
If not, they could leave.<br/>
No one is making anyone be here.<br/>
It&#39;s kind of rude to come in a bit late to a party and then yell that you <br/>
don&#39;t like the way it&#39;s being run.<br/>
<br/>
Ren<br/>
&quot;Knowledge will not always take the place of simple observation.&quot;<br/>

It&#39;s called an analogy.<br/>
If you hate it here SO much, why stay?<br/>
If I felt the way you do about a group, I certainly wouldn&#39;t spend all my <br/>
time screaming at everyone on it....seems so unproductive when we could be <br/>
talking about unschooling.<br/>
