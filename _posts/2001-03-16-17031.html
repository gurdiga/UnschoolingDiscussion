<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Play indoor games. Balloon relay is one my kids 
enjoy. Split kids into two groups. Provide each with inflated balloon. Have two 
chairs at the opposite side of the room. The kids run to chair, hop on ballon 
till it pops and run back to tag next team mate. I get little prizes like 
superballs and squirt guns, decks or cards, etc. Limbo can be entertining too. 
twister also brings lots of laughs. How about a messy sandwich contest Use 
graham crackers for the bread and supply lots of gooey sweet things like 
chocolate syrup, marshmallows, jelly etc and let them build. sure to have lots 
of laughing. Balloon volleyball can be fun too. Hope things work great for you 
and your boys!</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783662566">Set up a play tent in the living room or family room for the boys. Have<br/>
the boys work together for an half hour or 45 minutes to come up with a<br/>
play of their own and have them entertain you and hubby with a play. Make<br/>
available play clothes for a play, and props to use their imagination<br/>
with. Have them help you make popcorn and popcorn balls or carmel corn.<br/>
Have each boy decorate their own sword from a robin hood movie. You can<br/>
rent a robin hood movie or some other and offer them a choice of creating<br/>
something from that movie. (my siblings and I put on the Christmas story<br/>
one year instead of Dad reading the story out of the bible and it was<br/>
fun) You can also make a pretend fire in front of the play tent with<br/>
crepe paper or construction paper and just cook the food ahead of time. <br/>
Make sure you have plenty of paper plates and napkins and pop or juice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-544279311"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">That&#39;s a lot of guys.
<br>
<br>I don&#39;t know how much room you have, but if they&#39;re willing to split out some 
<br>(voluntarily, I mean) if you can put up a table or two for games (what sprang 
<br>to mind was Risk, or Magic), some could play there while others did something 
<br>else, and when it got late some could fall asleep and others could keep 
<br>playing until they&#39;re tired. &nbsp;Not being outside will hamper the exhaustion 
<br>factor.
<br>
<br>If you have a fireplace you could still do marshmallows. &nbsp;If there&#39;s an 
<br>alternate activity, some could be making food while others are playing, and 
<br>switch out so it&#39;s not so crowded all in one place at one time.
<br>
<br>There&#39;s a game called Dead Lion (we call it &quot;Dead Pirates&quot; because we first 
<br>played it at a pirate party) where everyone is to lie down on the floor and 
<br>relax, and one is &quot;it.&quot; &nbsp;He says whatever he wants without touching anyone, 
<br>can walk around, can step over them, and they have to play dead. &nbsp;If one 
<br>laughs, he&#39;s up and can help make the others laugh. &nbsp;Nothing mean, nothing 
<br>nasty was allowed, but eventually there&#39;s one guy left not laughing and he&#39;s 
<br>it next. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>Depending on the kids and the house and all, maybe videos--even just for 
<br>background, like renting Weird Al music videos (there are three collections 
<br>of Weird Al videos)--that doesn&#39;t take attention span or for the room to be 
<br>quiet, it&#39;s high-quality humor, and could be rewound and re-watched. &nbsp;&nbsp;Or 
<br>Monty Python and the Holy Grail (which has a touch of bad language, but not 
<br>much, and boys seem to love it). &nbsp;That&#39;s also basically as series of short 
<br>sketches and kids can come and go.
<br>
<br>A video gives something for shy or getting-grumpy kids to do until there&#39;s 
<br>another good chance for them to join the flow.

<br>that many birthday parties

cobwebs and spiders every where.  Had a scary video  (not to scary) <br/>
and got the kids to tell scary stories. Even the cake was covered in <br/>
green icing and edible spiders and creepy crawlies......<br/>
