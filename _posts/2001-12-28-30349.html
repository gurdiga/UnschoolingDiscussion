being irradiated when she was a child, back in the forties. I can&#39;t<br/>
remember the exact gland, maybe adrenal? a gland that&#39;s often much bigger<br/>
in children than adults, but doctors during that time period thought that<br/>
was a problem and gave kids large doses of radiation to shrink it...<br/>
which worked, except that the gland was supposed to be the size it<br/>
was....<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, exposure to radiation is the only known factor that will increase<br/>
your chances of developing anaplastic thyroid cancer - and often there<br/>
are 20 or more years between exposure and the cancer developing, in my<br/>
mom&#39;s case it was more like 50 years - but I imagine there are a lot of<br/>
other toxic events that happen to people over their lives, and we just<br/>
don&#39;t know what effect they&#39;re having.<br/>
<br/>
One in every three people will eventually develop some kind of cancer...<br/>

So true. When we go with the natural talents a child has, it *is* a<br/>
painless procedure. But to get there, we have to release our past<br/>
upbringing of &quot;this is how it&#39;s done&quot; and &quot;this is what you need to<br/>
know&quot; stuff. Hard to do but well worth it in the end.<br/>

&gt;patience on your part.  You have to totally change your ideas of<br/>
&gt;what<br/>
&gt;learning really is and how it happens.<br/>
&gt;++++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my response: I&#39;ve head for every year of school, deschooling takes a<br/>
month so in your case, a minimum of 10 months of doing *NOTHING*<br/>
schoolish (on your part anyway) would be needed.  When we went<br/>
through the de-schooling process, dd had only been in Kindergarten<br/>
for about 3 months and we &#39;deschooled&#39; for 6 months before she came<br/>
to me wanting to do something other than watch tv and play games. It<br/>
was well worth the wait!!!!!<br/>

1. no florescent lighting (it can drive me crazy)<br/>

What happens in my case is while I&#39;m reading, I&#39;m thinking of a<br/>
thousand other things I need to do. Have him keep a notepad beside<br/>
him and when he finds he&#39;s thinking about something else, jot it down<br/>
so he won&#39;t forget about it but it will give him the sense that he&#39;s<br/>
released from trying to remember whatever &#39;it&#39; is.<br/>

your son were very ill and had to take a year off of school, would<br/>
you be in such a panic or would you sigh and say, we&#39;ll, he&#39;ll be<br/>
fine? There&#39;s no race here to the educational finish line... there<br/>

You&#39;ll have to find some things the two of you can do together once<br/>
in awhile. Sitting at home bored to tears won&#39;t work for long. You<br/>
say he&#39;s crazy about computers... can you make plans to go to a<br/>
computer show/extravaganza? How about just going to the bookstore and<br/>
finding books that interest him on computers? How about lining up a<br/>
trip for the two of you to a business that does what he&#39;s interested<br/>
in? If you called and said your son would like to spend an hour or<br/>
two with a mentor there and would anyone be interested in showing him<br/>
the business, *somebody* will be interested. Somebody will have a kid<br/>
and relate to your situation and offer help.<br/>

my response:<br/>
And if he refuses to learn about unschooling, then tell him *you*<br/>
have done the research and *you* think this is best for your child.<br/>
If he&#39;s not willing to learn about the alternatives, then he needs to<br/>
relinquish that parenting responsibility over to you and not<br/>
criticize it! :-) I had to take this approach and although dh has<br/>
never read any John Holt other than what I&#39;ve read out loud to him,<br/>

my response:<br/>
I agree. I think you&#39;re concerned because uncharted territory is<br/>
always a little unsettling. But if you stick around the unschooling<br/>
boards and lists you&#39;ll soon start feeling more at ease with your<br/>
inclinations to unschool.  Just give it *one* year and I truly<br/>
believe you&#39;ll be where you want to be.<br/>

Quit School and<br/>
<br/>
In the elementary grades, there&#39;s less emphasis on speed and grasping<br/>
things quickly than in  middle and high school. The pace picks up<br/>
quite a bit. So, in your son&#39;s case, it&#39;s probably safe to say that<br/>
he&#39;s been able to cover up his inability to comprehend for quite some<br/>
time.  Now that there&#39;s this diagnosis, he&#39;s bound to be upset.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s angry/frustrated that he struggled for so long and nobody<br/>
ever realized it or figured it out. Maybe he&#39;s gotten into more<br/>
detailed material so that covering up is now impossible and he&#39;s<br/>
feeling defeated.  (I don&#39;t know... just making assumptions based on<br/>
my friend&#39;s son who also had the same problem).  In my friend&#39;s case,<br/>
her son began taking a medication (don&#39;t know which one but it was<br/>
akin to a mild sedative) and within three weeks, he experienced<br/>
positive results. Further, more detailed diagnosis was done and it<br/>
was determined that he could do the work when not put under the<br/>
normal time constraints.  *Maybe* by being at home your son will<br/>
learn to relax without the medication (that is probably a bad choice<br/>
of wording)... I&#39;m trying to say that your son may not need<br/>
medications (then again, he may) but at least try<br/>
unschooling/deschooling before drugs. There are side effects and<br/>
concequences to the drug route and you may very well be able to avoid<br/>
that if given time.<br/>

Hi Susan,<br/>
I totally expect to have very close ties with my dd&#39;s when they&#39;re<br/>
grown up. In thinking about all my hsing mom-friends, it seems we all<br/>
have struggles with our moms. It&#39;s also pretty clear that we&#39;re all<br/>
striving to not repeat the same patterns that put us in this<br/>
position.<br/>
 My oldest is now a teen, 15 and we&#39;re going through that stage where<br/>
she&#39;s a goddess and I&#39;m poison :( but compared to others I have<br/>
observed, we have a milder case of this than most. It&#39;s very<br/>
disturbing to me even though I know it&#39;s just a stage because I<br/>
*want* to be a part of her life. So, for now, I have to choose my<br/>
battles because in the end, I want to be able to go to lunch with my<br/>
adult children and laugh and tell secrets and all that good stuff. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to alienate her now just to make a point.<br/>
 Maybe one day *we&#39;ll* stroll in the grocery store together and have<br/>
a good time even there!<br/>

You&#39;re so right about staying de-stressed. It&#39;s so easy to get caught<br/>
up in situations, isn&#39;t it? I have to step outside of myself and<br/>
decide if it&#39;s worth feeling so bad over (I get skin ulcers under<br/>

&gt;  My son knows all about some of the famous people (Edison, Einstein, etc)<br/>
&gt; who had ADD and he knows he is smart. He admires Bill Gates and has<br/>
&gt; bought a biography of his. His problem is in comprehension. Attention<br/>
&gt; Deficit Disorder. That is the reason he gives for not being able to read.<br/>
&gt; He does read on the net, yes. That&#39;s in smaller spurts though. He was<br/>
&gt; just diagnosed with ADD the other day, so the label wasn&#39;t given to him<br/>
&gt; until then. The problem with reading began, and the not wanting any form<br/>
&gt; of academics, in the last few years. They say that all goes along with<br/>
&gt; having ADD. If anyone on this list is familiar with it, please speak up.<br/>
<br/>
Well I&#39;m probably no more familiar with it than you.  But your description<br/>
of your son could be a description of mine.  &lt;g&gt;  And, while he hasn&#39;t been<br/>
diagnosed, I&#39;m more and more sure that he *is* ADD.<br/>
<br/>
You say your son is keen on programming.  Is he very far along that<br/>
path?  My son has expressed an interest, but I have no idea how to get him<br/>
started.  (I started learning programming in 1970, never finished the<br/>
course, and it&#39;s *way* different now.)  Do you think your son would have<br/>
some ideas to help mine get started?<br/>

&gt;  Now my only question is how to provide the necessary documentation to<br/>

I was just reading recently about MA and satisfying their regs.  It might<br/>
have been here, in which case you&#39;d find it in the archives.  But one of<br/>
the suggestions was for a MA hs list.  If you don&#39;t find it in the<br/>
archives, maybe you could search Yahoogroups.  Or it might show up on<br/>
unschooling.com.  At any rate, it sounded like it wouldn&#39;t be that hard to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Why is it that we&#39;re (people in general) reduced to being our parents<br/>
&gt;children even after we&#39;ve grown up?  It is rare to find the adult<br/>
&gt;child/adult parent relationship that honors each other as adults.<br/>
<br/>
My mother and I relate as adults.  And so do my daughter and I.  Her<br/>
father, on the other hand, has yet to learn that she is no longer a<br/>
child.  It&#39;s kind of ironic.  He spent her childhood trying to turn her<br/>
against me.  And now she and I are *much* closer than they are.  She&#39;s<br/>
actually had to write him out of her life a few times already.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;     The wounds inflicted (knowingly or not) by parents seem to linger at<br/>
&gt;least a lifetime.  Have you found families you actually have friendships<br/>
&gt;with who have manged to develop adult-adult relationships with grown<br/>
&gt;children?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say that we&#39;ve got that with all three of our grown kids.  We&#39;re still<br/>
parents, and we still worry about them, but we do our best to only *offer*<br/>
advice, in the sense that they are free to accept or reject without hurting<br/>
our feelings.  (And we&#39;re not perfect at this.  The &quot;kids&quot; know we&#39;re<br/>
trying though.)<br/>
<br/>
&gt;     Just curious,  do we (on this list) expect our children to have close<br/>
&gt;relationships with us when they&#39;re grown up?<br/>
<br/>
I certainly always have, and it&#39;s worked.  (And the older ones all went to<br/>
school.)<br/>

<br/>
I always expected a close relationship with my kids when they were<br/>
grown, and so far we have just that, even though three of them live<br/>
quite a ways away (two in Alaska, one 60+ miles away), and the other<br/>
two are gone more than they&#39;re home most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
What do I mean by close? Well... I was visiting the kids in Alaska<br/>
just before Christmas and we were out doing some Christmas shopping;<br/>
I was picking out one of those noisy-obnoxious kinds of toys grandmas<br/>
love to give grandkids when my oldest son grabbed me from behind,<br/>
lifted me right up off my feet with a big bearhug, and said &quot;Mom, I<br/>
love you to pieces but if you get that for my daughter I&#39;m going to<br/>
mail both it and her down to YOU!&quot; &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So I snuck back the next day, bought the noisemaker, wrapped it up<br/>
and tucked it under the tree for HIM to open on Christmas - after I&#39;d<br/>
left! &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right now I&#39;m waiting for Jim, the son who lives 60 miles away, to<br/>
show up with his family. I was over at their place last night (yeah,<br/>
we all travel A LOT), and thought about just spending the night<br/>
there, but it was a beautiful clear moonlit night and the drive<br/>
between here and there is through some of the most beautiful<br/>
mountains anywhere, over the highest pass in the state... (and<br/>
besides, there&#39;s nothing like one&#39;s *own* bed and snugglies &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d been home about ten minutes when the phone rang. It was Jim, just<br/>
checking to make sure I&#39;d made it home safely. Mark said it was his<br/>
third call, and on his call before that he&#39;d said he was giving me<br/>
another half hour before he started out looking for me. (Yes, I carry<br/>
a cellphone, but it doesn&#39;t work out in those mountains.)<br/>
<br/>
I credit my parents with teaching me how to parent. What goes around<br/>
comes around.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Public schools &quot;say&quot; they accommodate ADD children, but let me tell you<br/>
&gt; it is impossible for them to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The last year that my son was in public school they put off his 504<br/>
&gt; Accomodation Plan meeting until January. (it should have taken place no<br/>
&gt; later<br/>
&gt; than October). At the meeting I asked the teacher why she had not made<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; accomodations that were outlined in the plan ( I had asked her on an<br/>
&gt; almost<br/>
&gt; daily basis up to this point), she replied that she didn&#39;t have a copy<br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; plan. That&#39;s when the special ed director realized that this teacher<br/>
&gt; was a<br/>
&gt; complete idiot, as I had been telling her. (she could&#39;ve gotten a copy<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; me or the special ed director, but never asked) Anything the teacher<br/>
&gt; said<br/>
&gt; after that point in the meeting was looked upon with suspision and I<br/>
&gt; caught<br/>
&gt; her in an out-and-out lie and called her on it. (she responded by<br/>
&gt; stating<br/>
&gt; that she &quot;didn&#39;t remember saying that&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t want to sound like I&#39;m defending the teacher here, I&#39;m sure if<br/>
&gt;you felt she lied, then she probably did. But, my question is, HOW COME<br/>
&gt;THE SPECIAL ED ADMINISTRATORS DIDN&#39;T MAKE SURE SHE WAS GIVEN A &gt;COPY OF<br/>
&gt;THE MODIFICATIONS TO KEEP IN HER FILES IN HER CLASSROOM? I feel that<br/>
&gt;should be part of that administrators job - to make sure all the<br/>
&gt;teachers have their mods in their classrooms.<br/>
<br/>
The first day of school I informed the teacher that Andrew has Asperger<br/>
Syndrome and he had a 504 Accomodation plan-she said that she saw that in<br/>
his<br/>
file, and she never asked for a copy so I assumed that she had one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t feel it was right that it be eaten up by continuous<br/>
&gt;trips to the Special Ed office, ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ADMINISTRATORS &gt;THERE<br/>
&gt;HAVE SEVERAL SECRETARIES AND STUDENT HELPERS WHO COULD &gt;EASILY<br/>
&gt;HAND-DELIVER THESE VERY IMPORTANT MODIFICATIONS TO THE VERY &gt;BUSY<br/>
&gt;TEACHERS.<br/>
<br/>
I can understand the frustration,but in our case, the teacher never even<br/>
made<br/>
any attempt to get his file, and you are right about the admin staff--the<br/>
principal didn&#39;t give a rat&#39;s butt about my son&#39;s situation.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The administrators should remember that the teachers are very busy<br/>
&gt;serving their many students. They should be the ones who put those mods<br/>
&gt;in the teacher&#39;s box or deliver them to the classroom. The teachers are<br/>
&gt;under much more stress and are much busier than those administrators.<br/>
<br/>
In this case the principal wouldn&#39;t give me the time of day. After many<br/>
(15+)<br/>
attempts to get a new 504 meeting, and no one returning my calls, I finally<br/>
left a note for the principal saying that Andrew wasn&#39;t going to school<br/>
until<br/>
she saw me. It took her 9 school days to call me- then they marked him as<br/>
truant for those days because I failed to date the note and had no proof of<br/>
when I left it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Also, was this a new teacher? Was she new to the school? Did she know<br/>
&gt;how the system worked? I remember my first year at my last high<br/>
&gt;school. I was totally on my own. I didn&#39;t know who anyone was, where<br/>
&gt;anything was, or what the policies and systems were. All the other<br/>
&gt;teachers are so incredibly busy, they don&#39;t have time to teach and/or<br/>
&gt;direct you. I didn&#39;t have a mentor teacher to help me because I was not<br/>
&gt;a first-year teacher. It took me almost an entire school-year before I<br/>
&gt;felt comfortable with how things worked there.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, she was a new teacher but I was there every day, trying to talk to her<br/>
and get help for whatever she needed. She resisted all my efforts and also I<br/>
stopped volunteering because she complained evey time I was there about what<br/>
I was doing and how much time I spent with my son. She made excuses for not<br/>
communicating with me and not meeting the accomodations that I asked for.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;IMO, in your son&#39;s case, the administrators should have taken some of<br/>
&gt;the blame for not having the accommodations or modifications put into<br/>
&gt;the hands of the teacher. There is the possibility the teacher was<br/>
&gt;totally overwhelmed and the administrators should have realized that.<br/>
<br/>
I agree--everyone dropped the ball--but there&#39;s more to this story...<br/>
I work in a major grocery chain in our community and on 3 different<br/>
occasions<br/>
I had kids from his classrom some in the store and tell me that &quot;Mrs.<br/>
Brennan<br/>
was being mean to Andrew&quot;--lots of verbal abuse--screaming at him and<br/>
slamming her hand down on his desk. Of course when I questiond her she<br/>
always<br/>
denied it, and Andrew never told me because he was too afraid. I know that<br/>
he<br/>
was not a behavior problem--he just required too much of her time ......<br/>

Yes.  My husband and I are very close to our boys now and we hope to<br/>
remain so forever.  My husband had an extremely close and beautiful<br/>
relationship with his &quot;Pop&quot; (his step-grandfather).  My husband was<br/>
raised by this wonderful man.  I credit him for the fact that my husband<br/>
is such an excellent and loving father.  Wes, my husband, was very lucky<br/>
to have his Pop.  He&#39;s been gone now for over 25 years, and Wes still<br/>
misses him terribly.  I&#39;m quite certain that my boys will be just as<br/>
close to my husband as he was to his Pop.  I have learned a lot from my<br/>
husband about how to be a loving and caring parent.<br/>
