<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025983930">It hit me today that while we&#39;ve really spent most of the past year somewhat unschooling, we&#39;re still in the &quot;de-schooling&quot; process...especially since during that time I was still trying to force some academics in as much as I could...I&#39;m learning to let go, learning to stop it...but it isn&#39;t exactly the easiest process. I worry so much about Sarah (or the other children) coming to me later on in life and saying that they totally regret not having had 1) the public school experience &quot;everyone else&quot; did or 2) that they really wish I&#39;d taught them a, b, or c ... sigh! <br/>
 <br/>
I keep trying to remind myself of what&#39;s truly important in life, rather than important in the very limited world of government education. I keep telling myself that they will be just fine in the long run and so much happier for this way of life. <br/>
 <br/>
The other day we had a long power outage, about an hour and a half. During it we had an interesting discussion about how people lived before electricity, and how much the world has changed since then and if it&#39;s a good thing or a bad thing and I was surprised at how astute some of Sarah&#39;s observations were. She said it&#39;s easier to be a family without all the modern things that distract us from spending time with each other. <br/>
 <br/>
Not that she or I want to change our lives drastically, but it was also I think a &quot;spend more time with me&quot; moment too. <br/>
 <br/>
ANYWAY..I know that I&#39;m rambling..I just wanted to share my thoughts with others who understand. Sometimes I feel rather lonely because I don&#39;t know anyone else who unschools in my area. <br/>

I really agree with  this ! We lived for awhile where the lights went out once/twice a week. We&#39;d get out candles and play Clue in the candlelite. Good memories....<br/>

Maybe it would help to be in more unusual circumstances, then.  Go to other <br/>
places.  Hike.  Camp.  Go to lunch at some family restaurant in a nearby town <br/>
and sit extra long, if it&#39;s not crowded.<br/>

It was something else. Neighbours were out, children playing, the nieghbourhood smelled wonderful with everyone using the barbques....sigh, I almost miss it. Almost...4 days was just right.<br/>

<br/>
Yep.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s talking about going to school next year, for a while, to see what <br/>
it&#39;s like.  I told her I couldn&#39;t stand to talk about every day between now and <br/>
September, that it would ruin a year of my life.  She tends to go back and <br/>
forth and back and forth and BACK and forth about stuff, all aloud, at the oddest <br/>
hours.  She did want braces, definitely, no not yet, yes but later, maybe not, <br/>
YES, should&#39;ve started sooner (and so forth).<br/>
<br/>
So she says she wants to go to school but she doesn&#39;t intend to do any <br/>
homework.  And when she finds out what it&#39;s like she&#39;ll come home.  Unless she&#39;s <br/>
having fun.<br/>
<br/>
Theoretically I&#39;m willing to let her go.  There are side issues, though, and <br/>
one is my serious reluctance to plan on it and do anything toward it just to <br/>
have her say, &quot;No, I changed my mind, I don&#39;t want to go,&quot; and then a week or <br/>
four hours later, &quot;I really did want to go, I should go.&quot;<br/>

Probably a year or so....and my kids were only in school about a year and we<br/>
did curriculum for less than a semester.<br/>
<br/>
Now about 4 years into the process, worries about academics are the farthest<br/>
thing from my mind.  I worry about more important stuff, stuff I didn&#39;t seem<br/>
to have time to worry about before....like the people in the family treating<br/>

how long did it take you to relax and go with the flow? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I started off unschooling with kids who hadn&#39;t been to school, and there were <br/>
still layers of deschooling for me.  Overall, it takes years, but until you <br/>
get one layer off (onion-style) you can&#39;t start on the next one.  Stalling <br/>
never helps. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you were to go a whole year with absolutely nothing schoolish and you <br/>
found that didn&#39;t work, you could add in schoolish stuff.  (I bet you would never <br/>
go back, but for the sake of the argument, say you lived a TRULY clean solid <br/>
unschooling year...)<br/>
<br/>
But if you never go a whole year, you can&#39;t go a second year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941485165">Beth, consider this an invitation. Gather the kids in the car soon, drive a<br/>
couple hours north, and come to Salem for a couple days. We&#39;ll kick Julian<br/>
out of his room and you can stay here. We&#39;ll do some fun things and we can<br/>
talk<br/>
about unshooling and you and your kids can meet Julian and see how<br/>
unschooled kids turn out.<br/>

We&#39;re in our second year of homeschooling. We&#39;ve bounced back and forth between school at home and unschooling quite a few times in that period. It&#39;s only been about a week since I truly stopped trying to force academics in. It&#39;s not easy for me, but I&#39;m getting there. One thing that&#39;s helping me to learn to let go is keeping a journal of what we&#39;re doing and my thoughts on the issue as well as just reading everything I can find about children and how they learn, etc. <br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t think the deschooling starts until AFTER you stop trying to <br/>
force <br/>
&gt; academics in.<br/>
<br/>
I am finally understanding this more and more in my quest <br/>
to &quot;educate&quot; with freedom and lack of worry about what we SHOULD be <br/>
doing. Yesterday we passed a school bus and my 11 yr. old daughter <br/>
said to me &quot;I am so lucky.&quot; I almost drove off the road. <br/>
<br/>
I have stopped saying we &quot;should&quot; be doing this or that after one day <br/>
a few weeks ago my daughter said &quot;I hate school work!&quot;  I have <br/>
finally realized how much she does on her own, in her own time frame, <br/>
suiting her own interests (usually about horses)in research at the <br/>
library or on the computer, reading how-to  and fiction books, <br/>
drawing horses, etc.   So I have given &quot;IT&quot; a rest. I know we are all <br/>
different but for those of you who have been doing this for awhile, <br/>
how long did it take you to relax and go with the flow?  I am <br/>
assuming it will get easier as time goes on, especially if I keep <br/>
listening to her.  Thanks for your input.  Sara<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good visual!  My daughter has never been to &quot;school&quot; but we were in a <br/>
home school charter for awhile.  It turned into more of a government <br/>
run public school with all of the requirements and accountability <br/>
issues. . . .that is why I filed a R4 here in Ca.in 2002.  So one <br/>
HUGE layer was peeled off last year and little bits are peeling every <br/>
day.  Thanks</div>
