<h4>Cornerstone Community Farm</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146521746">Hi everyone.  I&#39;ve been lurking (and occasional writing) on this list <br/>
quite a while, maybe nearly a year.  Thought it bout time to say hello <br/>
and a little more about myself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a single dad, been single 8 1/2 half years.  First heard about <br/>
homeschooling in a culture (world view) course at my church.<br/>
Later took a seminar in 1993 by Professor and author Larry Woiwode. <br/>
<br/>
The past three years I&#39;ve been teaching a seminar on Home schooling at <br/>
Cornerstone Festival of music and art. (Over 300 bands, the likes of <br/>
POD, Sixpence none the richer, and Switchfoot became famous thru <br/>
Cornerstone) I teach general HS, but with a strong emphasis on <br/>
Unschooling.  I go over the various trains of thought within home <br/>
schooling, and emphasize that all parents must have elements of <br/>
unschooling in their methodology, or they will fail to teach their <br/>
children to love education...<br/>
<br/>
We just set up a contract to lease/land contract our own land in a <br/>
rugged hilly portion of SW WI.  We will continue growing organic <br/>
produce and organic milk and a few beef steers every year.  We use <br/>
rotational grazing, a LOW labor/capital input type of farming.  No <br/>
tractors.  All work by hand or draft horses.<br/>
<br/>
We will next summer set up cabins and tent sites where customers can <br/>
come and see how their food is produced (and help for a reduced price <br/>
on food), learn about healthy eating and living in a Biblical <br/>
worldview.<br/>
<br/>
Alice was only a baby then, but I was excited about the prospects of <br/>
homeschooling.  I felt right from the start, that education began at <br/>
birth.  Alice was played with and read to quite a bit, long before she <br/>
knew what reading was about.  She pretty much learned to read on her <br/>
own, reading Chronicles of Narnia on my lap.<br/>
<br/>
Alice loved home schooling, and thrived at it.  She pretty much taught <br/>
herself math with Saxon math, and read extensively, on her own.  Her <br/>
mom originally agreed to homeschooling, but began to object.  Alice <br/>
tested (court ordered) well above school kids.  I think the real issue <br/>
was not Alice was not thriving, but she missed the tax-free child <br/>
support payments.  Mom earns twice what I do, and I did NOT make her <br/>
pay child support when I had her homeschooling and 90% custody.<br/>
Anyway, a crooked judged decided that 2 grades ahead of other kids was <br/>
not good enough.  I&#39;m appealing now, and should hear back with a few <br/>
months.  <br/>
<br/>
Other interests include Linux computer systems (building my own), <br/>
reading, music, writing, Cornerstone Festival.com, guitar, hiking, <br/>
hunting, fishing, camping, homemade bread, scratch foods, gardening, <br/>
horses, dogs, cats, and just about any other kind of animal.<br/>
<br/>
I read with great curiosity the discussions questioning how one could <br/>
both unschool and be a Christian.  I was raised in a church, but later <br/>
became a Christian while serving in the military, so I understand the <br/>
confusion some may have. <br/>
<br/>
Feel free to send any questions about our homeschooling or our farm or <br/>
world view.  <br/>
