<div id="ygrps-yiv-279648620">Has anyone dealt with hostile exes and DCF?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t heard from my ex in probably close to 2 years.  Last night he IMed me and went off on a tirade.  Amongst other things, he said that Bekka needs to be in school before she becomes socially dysfunctional.  While I know that&#39;s a crock of hooey, it won&#39;t stop him from calling DCF and causing trouble.  What do I do?  What are my &quot;rights&quot; as far as that goes?  Thank you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would say it depends on a couple things.  What state you live in would be <br/>
one.  And what kind of custody arrangement you have.  If you have fully <br/>
custody, then he&#39;d have a harder time saying what he wants to happen.  And <br/>
full custody doesn&#39;t just mean who she lives with.  It also means who has <br/>
the &quot;custodial&quot; role.  In some agreements that&#39;s shared.<br/>
<br/>
Mind you, since he&#39;s been &quot;gone&quot; for so long, you do have a leg up.<br/>
<br/>
Save the IM, if you can.  If it included other things that can be called <br/>
abusive, it could be useful.  And make sure all your ducks are in a row in <br/>
terms of your state&#39;s paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
(oh, and remind me to thank my parents for not being jerks after their <br/>
divorce.  -sigh-  I can&#39;t believe what some people have to put up with.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841489522">I&#39;m so sorry you are having to deal with this. No matter the outcome, it is<br/>
always a terrible feeling to have those kind of encounters with an ex. I<br/>
have had various exchanges with my ex about my childrens&#39; schooling, or<br/>
lack of, in his opinion. Not being defensive or stooping to his tirade<br/>
level helps. I am happy to email you privately and send you a copy of the<br/>
&#39;discussion of learning experiences&#39; I have compiled to appease my ex. And,<br/>
usually I find it cools him down to see such richness in our unschooling<br/>
path. <br/>
Aloha, Lee<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know much about dealing with DCF, but could you difuse the <br/>
situation with your ex now to prevent him from calling? Maybe send <br/>
him a nice, informative email acknowledging his concerns about <br/>
Bekka&#39;s socialization. (Even though we all know it&#39;s a crock of <br/>
hooey!) Tell him about all the ways she IS being socialized with <br/>
other kids her age. Does she do scouts, gymnastics, dance, park <br/>
groups, classes, church group, etc.? Then let him know about it. <br/>
Maybe with some soothing words you can get him to back down.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<br/>
Homeschooling is legal in all states but that doesn&#39;t keep judges from<br/>
ruling against it.<br/>
<br/>
I would document what you guys are doing.  Not change what you are doing<br/>
necessarily but keep track of books read, shows watched, math skills, trips<br/>
to museums, etc. in a notebook.  I wouldn&#39;t even mention to my child what I<br/>
was doing.<br/>
<br/>
I would make sure that ex was up to date on his child support and, next time<br/>
I hear from him, I would explain that if dd goes to school, I will be asking<br/>
for an increase to cover the cost of school clothes, supplies, lunch money,<br/>
etc..<br/>
