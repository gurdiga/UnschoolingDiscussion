<div id="ygrps-yiv-1144864276">&lt;&lt;she won&#39;t even look at one of her educational videos for weeks at a time&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what that is supposed to mean, except perhaps that most of what<br/>
we term &quot;educational&quot; is boring.  My kids all go through stages of varying<br/>
lengths.  Right now, my 3yo is huge into &quot;James and the Giant Peach&quot;.  He<br/>
loves all kinds of bugs and the show is just the tops for him.  It isn&#39;t any<br/>
big deal.  My 8yo son is currently into gel-ing and spiking his hair.  So<br/>
what....this too shall pass.<br/>

<br/>
Igloos?  Ice sculptures?<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in Michigan, my kids just liked to pee in the snow.  &#39;Course,<br/>
we are what y&#39;all might call rednecks  :)<br/>
