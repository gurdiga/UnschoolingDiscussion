<div id="ygrps-yiv-143808933">Wow!  I almost hit the delete key because I thought it was yet another BS tip about &quot;reward&quot; for cleaning your own stuff up.  The only reward/payment WE get when WE clean OUR house is the freedom to kick back and trash it for the rest of the day.  <br/>
<br/>
I try to give our guys money (allowance?  but allowance for what?) because I didn&#39;t like the lousy feeling it gave me to always have them begging for pennies.  It&#39;s not much, but they control it, it is theirs and I do not tell them what they can and can not buy.  They get the money for the same reason I get money, we are members of this family and this is family money.  That is a bit hard for my husband to comprehend.  He has to work for the money, but I remind him that kids don&#39;t have that option and no one pays him or me to do work about the house.  I even hate to use the word work:  it is simply those things we do to make our home more pleasing to be in and somewhat sanitary.  We don&#39;t go to the park or zoo or wherever BECAUSE THEY cleaned the house; we go WHEN WE have it cleaned, or just blow off the whole cleaning thing and throw everything out of sight and go.    <br/>

My toddler makes many of the messes in the house, including in my daughters&#39;<br/>
room. The girls end up cleaning up many messes they aren&#39;t responsible for,<br/>
and I often give them money to do so. I often give them special tasks to<br/>
earn spending money for candy or marbles or whatever.<br/>
They have the option of not doing those things, and often excercize it, but<br/>
knowing that it may take me longer to get things done and therefore put off<br/>
some of the *fun* things we might want to do. It is the closest thing to how<br/>
life on the whole seems to work, for us.<br/>
<br/>
There are also days when we all get the house together, and those days we<br/>
work just because it is part of our routine.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t divide tasks by who made what mess, because life doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
work that way either.<br/>
My husband works to make money that often I will spend on our family stuff.<br/>
That isn&#39;t evenly divided, and neither is the housework. Neither is our<br/>
time, turthfully. We work towards a balance....a coordinated effort to keep<br/>
certain standards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that there is often no one better way to do things in regards<br/>
to allowance/chores Different seasons and ages and paces of life ask for<br/>
different approaches. :)<br/>

     I liked this whole post.  I believe in being fluid in most of life <br/>
because that&#39;s how we find things that work better for us at any given time. <br/>
