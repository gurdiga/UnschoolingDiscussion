<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hi, I thought of something when I was reading your 
post.&nbsp; Maybe it would be fun to have a homeschooling trip to Daddy&#39;s work, 
so SOn &amp; others can see what Daddy does. The office, and how important 
Daddy&#39;s work is, and all the&nbsp;ways his job helps people. Maybe if he saw 
where he was everyday he could relate to his job a little better.&nbsp; Son 
could give Daddy a special object that he can carry around with him when he is 
at work, perhaps.&nbsp; And all prayers are great.&nbsp; AN expression of ones 
hopes, and concerns, some days I may pray , and include some worrisome thoughts, 
but they will pass.&nbsp; But that is a high stress job, maybe focusing on the 
activities that aren&#39;t so scary.&nbsp; My husband climbs trees, and at times 
this can be a hazard, but few people can do this type of job, and Daddy loves 
it.&nbsp; SO we try to have fun with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;
