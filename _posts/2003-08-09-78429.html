      Why? *I* don&#39;t get it, I really don&#39;t. I thought the post was well done.<br/>
  I also thought the discussion was going well. Lots of sharing how posters<br/>
  felt about the subject.  I&#39;ve *always* been outside any cliques. Never in<br/>
  the inner cicle, anytime, anywhere. Probably never will. I don&#39;t feel there<br/>
  is one here. Frequent posters, sometime posters and lurkers. Info, advice,<br/>
  sharing, family life stories and websites, comfort and celebrating. That&#39;s<br/>
  what I see here. Now one more opinion to add to the mix. ;-)<br/>
