&gt; Lars has told me he&#39;d like to learn more about history.  When I pinned <br/>
&gt; him<br/>
&gt; down a bit, it seems he&#39;d like to understand the history leading up to <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; current events he sees on the news, particularly the Middle East.  Does<br/>
&gt; anybody have any favourite sites, movies, or books to recommend?  I <br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s just interested generally at this point rather than focussed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The  Nation Public Radio website (www.NRP.org) has a great series on all <br/>
aspects of what&#39;s going on in the Middle East, particularly Israel and <br/>
Palestine, that you can listen to for free using a free downloadable <br/>
RealAudio player.  Its mentioned on their homepage, so it&#39;s easy to find <br/>
(the title is &quot;The Mideast: A Century of Conflict&quot;). I don&#39;t know how a <br/>
kid will feel about it, but it helped ME understand a little better <br/>
what&#39;s going on over there.<br/>
<br/>
Also maybe geared more towards adults, but in a very accessable format <br/>
(the comic book!) is Marjane Satrapi&#39;s book about growing up before and <br/>
during the Islamic revolution in Iran , &quot;Persepolis, the story of a <br/>
Childhood&quot;. (Yes, it was reviewed on NPR!).<br/>

at it yet, but my husband (who is Iranian) liked it a lot and my older <br/>
daughters have read it and really liked it.<br/>

realizing that it&#39;s pretty disgraceful that I really know nothing about it.<br/>
