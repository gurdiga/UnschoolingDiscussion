<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005823980">We belong to a methodist church.  When Landon went through confirmation, they <br/>
met every week on Sunday afternoons.  It was a very casual atmosphere and <br/>
Landon never complained (although he is accustomed to &quot;class&quot; since goes to <br/>
school)  <br/>
<br/>
Anna is going through confirmation right now and they have changed the format <br/>
to something much better.  Now, the confirmands each have a mentor.  They <br/>
meet ( at their convenience) with their mentor to ask questions, have <br/>
conversations, and discuss the bible scripture they are supposed to read ( I <br/>
know, I know, an &#39;assignment&quot;.. Anna has not had a problem with that though.  <br/>
She reads some of it and I read some of it aloud to her. no big deal)  The <br/>
whole experience is one on one.  Much more personal and communicative.  They <br/>
will meet as a group one time for supper and mingling.    She is learning a <br/>
lot going through confirmation and he has really enjoyed her special time <br/>
with her mentor.  The goal is for them to continue this relationship and for <br/>
the confirmands to feel they always have someone they can call, ask for <br/>
advice, and be a role model for them.   <br/>
<br/>
Anna really likes her grandparents church a lot better because there have a <br/>
much larger and more active youth group than  our church.   She said that she <br/>
may want to go to church there instead.  She felt a little &quot;weird&quot; going <br/>
through confirmation and then maybe &quot;ditching&quot; our  church for a different <br/>
one.  I told her that was all a personal choice for her.  If she wants to <br/>
finish confirmation, then that is fine.  If she wants to stop, thats fine <br/>
too.  She can be active in both churches.  She can pick and chose which <br/>
activities she wants to do at each one.   Or, she can not go to church at a<br/>
ll.  She wants to finish confirmation because she is enjoying it and likes <br/>
her mentor.  But who knows, she may become a baptimeth or something.. :-)<br/>
