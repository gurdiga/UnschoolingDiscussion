Deadline for home schools<br/>
Oct. 11, 2002 Orange County Register Editorial<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.ocregister.com/ocrweb/ocr/article.do?id=6429&section=COMMENTARY&year=2002&month=10&day=11">http://www2.ocregister.com/ocrweb/ocr/article.do?id=6429&section=COMMENTARY&year=2002&month=10&day=11</a><br/>
<br/>
Halloween frights could come early this year for home-schooling families. <br/>
Oct. 15 marks the last day home schools may file required private-school <br/>
affidavits with the California Department of Education. This is a departure <br/>
from previous years, when the affidavits were filed with county departments <br/>
of education.<br/>
<br/>
After Oct. 15, parents will find out how serious Superintendent of Public <br/>
Instruction Delaine Eastin is in trying to outlaw home-schooling. In <br/>
August, she announced that California law by her reading doesn&#39;t allow home <br/>
schooling. As she explained in a Sept. 1 letter to the Register, &quot;The <br/>
classic &#39;home school&#39;- where children are taught by their parent who does <br/>
not have a teaching credential - is not a legal means of complying with <br/>
compulsory education law, which means that home-schooled children are truant.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But she&#39;s wrong. A home school is legal because it is a private school, <br/>
sometimes called a parent-operated private school, which clearly is allowed <br/>
by state law. And Education Code Section 44237(b)(4) even allows &quot;a parent <br/>
or legal guardian working exclusively with his or her children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The shift to the state for filing the affidavit is an attempt by state <br/>
education authorities to locate home-schoolers, Michael Smith, president of <br/>
the Home School Legal Defense Association, told us. Although located in <br/>
Virginia, his group is closely watching California&#39;s situation and is ready <br/>
to defend in court any of its members who are challenged by the government.<br/>
<br/>
He said the state figures that anybody filing an affidavit &quot;with five <br/>
students or less is a home schooler,&quot; instead of a more traditional private <br/>
school, which also must fill in the form but the Department of Education <br/>
considers legitimate (for now).<br/>
<br/>
He said that, if the Department of Education does go after home-schoolers, <br/>
it will do so through local district attorneys. The procedure would be for <br/>
a local D.A. to file truancy charges against a home-schooling family, which <br/>
means a child has been absent from a public or private school for more than <br/>
three days. The parents then are given an opportunity to get the child in <br/>
school before being prosecuted in court.<br/>
<br/>
Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas was not available to talk <br/>
to us yesterday. But his spokesperson, deputy D.A. Susan Kang Schroeder, <br/>
told us, &quot;We&#39;re going to look at every case that comes in to see if a crime <br/>
occurred. But we won&#39;t say with a broad stroke that these kinds of people <br/>
will be prosecuted.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Given the nature of Orange County as a place that appreciates freedom more <br/>
than Ms. Eastin, and where in the 1998 election she got just 45 percent of <br/>
the vote here (compared to 54 percent statewide), we hope - and even expect <br/>
- Mr. Rackauckas will avoid such prosecutions, instead spending scarce <br/>
resources on real crimes.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Smith said parents who are home-schooling, or considering it, should <br/>
not worry that they will be hauled into court. He believes state law is <br/>
clear and will hold up in court.<br/>
<br/>
We hope so. Home-schooling, which has produced many notable success <br/>
stories, obviously is a choice that should be made by parents, not the <br/>
education establishment as represented by Ms. Eastin.<br/>
<br/>
(The affidavit is available online: www.cde.ca.gov/privateschools. <br/>
Instructions are provided there, but more information is available at the <br/>
site of the Home School Legal Defense Association: www.hslda.org. The <br/>
Internet also is chock-full of home-schooling sites.)<br/>
