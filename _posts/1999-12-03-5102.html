<br/>
i agree with most of what&#39;s been said.   but the biggest problem i see is that<br/>
your daughter&#39;s friend has no idea what homeschooling/unschooling is - it most<br/>
certainly is not just leaving school and vegging (though your daughter may<br/>
need a bit of down time -a debriefing if you will)  so she can develop a new<br/>
relationship with learning.<br/>
<br/>
many people need time to understand something so new and different.<br/>
homeschooling, for some people unfortunately, carries a stigma whether it be<br/>
the belief that the homeschoolers are religious fanatics or hippy freaks - in<br/>
general ultra non-conformists who don&#39;t support society (which the public<br/>
school system represents) as a whole.   the bottom line, as i see it, is:<br/>
things which are different most often create fear, so see this as a great<br/>
opportunity to help someone broaden their understanding of homeschooling and<br/>
all it has to offer (not only to the individual family but also to society) as<br/>
well as their understanding of the world.   communities are diverse and<br/>
homeschooling is just another example of this diversity.   the more people who<br/>
can truly enjoy the differences we each have, the better and stronger society<br/>
we can build and maintain.   good luck and wishes in your transition.<br/>

<br/>
My son has been homeschooled since fifth grade,  but he returned <br/>
briefly at the beginning of 7th because he wanted to see what middle <br/>
school was like.  When he decided to leave school,  his friend (they&#39;ve been <br/>
friends since they were 3,  but this was the first time they&#39;ve gone <br/>
to the same school) was hurt and angry.  He lashed out at Kyle  <br/>
verbally saying many of the same things that were said in the poem.<br/>
Middle school is tough and Kyle&#39;s friend felt betrayed and abandoned <br/>
by his best friend.  He didn&#39;t have a choice and Kyle did.  We tried <br/>
to see it from his perspective and at the same time told Kyle that he <br/>
didn&#39;t have to put up with any verbal abuse from his friend.  It took <br/>
a little while,  but they hung in there together and are still best <br/>
friends.  Sometimes they still give each other a hard time about who <br/>
will end up *dumber*  but they&#39;ve come to some sort of truce that <br/>
only they understand.   I hope your daughter and her friend are able <br/>
to do the same.<br/>

How about a list of all the famous unschoolers, homeschoolers?  In addition how<br/>
about your daughter telling her friend how hurt and angry she feels?<br/>
<br/>
Worship of high school diplomas is of course common.  The whole system is set<br/>
up to propagandize how important this is.  Of course the school system is<br/>
dependent on a web of misrepresentation otherwise parents & children would<br/>
leave the system in droves. The idea that the misery will pay off &quot;someday&quot; is<br/>
a fundamental piece of the whole myth.  Does your daughter know or believe that<br/>
it is a myth.<br/>
<br/>
Ignorance is a terrible thing.<br/>
<br/>
Most of all it is a time for you to be closer than ever to your daughter,<br/>
listening to her sorrow, fear and anger.  You are the anchor in her life.  This<br/>
is an opportunity for you to reestablish your connection with your daughter.<br/>
If she has been in public school much that connection is no doubt weakened<br/>
somewhat.  The widespread frenzy of peer identification is a challenge to the<br/>
attachment between parents and children everywhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57839873">WOW what an intense poem for your daughter to GET!<br/>
I think maybe you and her should sit down with the friend and explain what<br/>
you are doing your goals etc....It sounds as if your daughters friend feels<br/>
like your daughter has deserted her!<br/>
Maybe they could talk about plans they could make together outside of school<br/>
etc...<br/>
maybe the friend is just hurt and trying to do the same to your daughter?<br/>
Good Luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369396997">Comment #1:  Maybe this is a good time to talk about how people sometimes <br/>
lash out and act hurtful, even to those they care for, when they are insecure <br/>
or jealous or have problems of their own.   That whatever this teenager&#39;s <br/>
angst is about and however unfortunate it is that it is directed at your <br/>
daughter, it may actually have very little to do with her.  That people (old <br/>
and young) often behave poorly.   For reasons that are not clear, even to <br/>
them, let alone us.  That sometimes friendships end.  It is often a part of <br/>
growing up.  Sometimes the parties handle it well.  Sometimes not.  Overall, <br/>
that this tirade has nothing to do with your daughter and everything to do <br/>
with an overreaction from the other girl.  <br/>
<br/>
Catty Comment #2:  One benefit of hsing you might point out to your daughter <br/>
is that  her grammar and spelling may end up being better than her friend&#39;s.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151592326">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This is maybe going to sound odd, but I get a strange instinct reaction that<br/>
the girl who wrote the letter was making a badly-thought-out but<br/>
well-intentioned outreach to a friend she thinks has just &quot;quit&quot;, as in<br/>
&quot;dropped out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I even get a feeling that her parents might have influenced her to write it,<br/>
because it&#39;s got that super-ego-y tone to it.  I can even envision a talk<br/>
with them going something like &quot;Well, dear, if your friend has quit school,<br/>
maybe she needs a good friend like you to help her see that it&#39;s a really<br/>
bad decision and that her future is at stake&quot;.  (They of course don&#39;t get<br/>
the idea of home/unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
After all, the message is no different from what we all hear on t.v. and in<br/>
the media, from people who supposedly have our best interest at heart: &quot;Stay<br/>
in school.  Get a good job.  The value of a diploma is  $...&quot;<br/>
Something along the ideas of an intervention, is what I&#39;m thinking this<br/>
unhappy friend was hoping to accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter still wants to be friends with the other girl, your<br/>
daughter is going to have to be willing to educate her friend, and her<br/>
friend is going to have to be willing to be educated.  I know from friends<br/>
who are HIV positive, just to give an example, that being the spokesperson<br/>
for HIV suddenly, to their former friends who desert them when they find<br/>
out, is really not worth the energy.<br/>
<br/>
But your daughter might choose differently.  It could be a really wonderful<br/>
moment to open this friend&#39;s worldview.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s too much trouble--but I just wanted to offer an<br/>
interpretation that ascribed the best motivations to the friend to offer<br/>
your daughter a happier way to understand it.  What actions she choose to<br/>
take on the basis of that are up to her, but I hope this will help her see<br/>
it as less hurtful in intent.<br/>
<br/>
Just my gut feeling about it--<br/>

Jumping right in here without an intro, (don&#39;t worry, I will send it!) It<br/>
is apparent that both of these girls are hurting. It sounds like her<br/>
friend feels like she has been abandoned. Try inviting her over, or<br/>
planning on doing some things after school or on weekends. She probably<br/>
feels lost without her bosom buddy. <br/>
<br/>
I would say this is worthwhile unless you feel that this friend is not<br/>
good for your daughter. In that case, I would just give your daughter all<br/>
the support you can. I was overjoyed to see that all the mixed up kids<br/>
who my daughter thought were her friends dropped her like a hot potato<br/>
when she came home to school! Yea!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861141791">I haven&#39;t read all the posts on this topic, so someone else may have already<br/>
mentioned it...<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, out of jealousy, we &quot;lash out&quot; at those whom we profess to care<br/>
about.  Perhaps your daughter&#39;s friend is thinking (unconsiously?) that she<br/>
too, would like to homeschool... since she can&#39;t, her &quot;defense mechanism&quot;<br/>
may have kicked in, and responded to the situation in this way.  Perhaps the<br/>
friend is feeling abandonded... &quot;I&#39;ll never get to see you...&quot; etc.  Are you<br/>
friendly with the girl&#39;s parents?  Perhaps a discussion with them (with or<br/>
without the daughters present) could help ease the tension.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing related to homeschooling.. but as one who was severely hurt by<br/>
&quot;friends&quot; in high school.. time does in fact heal, but never erases.  I<br/>
applaud your desire to help your daughter, recognizing that she has been<br/>
hurt, rather than simply &quot;blowing it off&quot;.  You obviously love her very<br/>
much.  I hope it all works out well in the end.<br/>

passed). No one asked me anything about my kids. It is really the strangest <br/>
thing, as though we don&#39;t exist as learning people because we choose to be <br/>
outside the system. <br/>
    They do not criticize me but none of them really understand hsing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836960221">I remember all too well how much my friends meant to me and others as <br/>
teenagers.  My sister had a best friend through the junior high and high <br/>
school years who was rather dominating and I felt like this letter reminded <br/>
me of that girl.  My sister let the girl be the dominant one in the <br/>
friendship but it finally ended because my sister decided to go to college <br/>
and this girl felt that it was wrong.  There were religious issues involved <br/>
and the girl felt that my sister was not a true Christian because she was <br/>
choosing the things of the world by taking some classes at the community <br/>
college.  (My sister had become interested in psychology.)  It ended up <br/>
really hurting my sister a lot and it took her many years before she was able <br/>
to trust enough again to have close friends.<br/>
    It seems to me that if a person isn&#39;t willing to believe in you for who <br/>
you are and is going to use her friendship as a leverage when you aren&#39;t <br/>
doing what she thinks you should do, you&#39;re probably a lot better off without <br/>
the friendship.  However, teens may not be able to see this and sometimes <br/>
have to learn on their own, painfully, unfortunately.  <br/>
     Of course, I may be totally wrong about this girl because I don&#39;t know <br/>
the situation at all.  I hope they are able to mend it.  As your daughter <br/>
continues learning at home, she will probably be much more independently <br/>
minded than many of us were as teens and therefore able to choose friendships <br/>
which are positive for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-824216234">Yeh know, remembering that age, maybe, just maybe, part of the problem is<br/>
jealousy.  Like wishing she could, wishing her parents would let her,<br/>
wishing her parents cared (it would be caring in her eyes but hey, in mine<br/>
too) enough about her to spend that much time with/for her.  Girls are a<br/>
very catty, jealous bunch at that age in ps!<br/>

&gt; Hi all..<br/>
&gt; Jumping right in here without an intro, (don&#39;t worry, I will send it!) It<br/>
&gt; is apparent that both of these girls are hurting. It sounds like her<br/>
&gt; friend feels like she has been abandoned. Try inviting her over, or<br/>
&gt; planning on doing some things after school or on weekends. She probably<br/>
&gt; feels lost without her bosom buddy. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would say this is worthwhile unless you feel that this friend is not<br/>
&gt; good for your daughter. In that case, I would just give your daughter all<br/>
&gt; the support you can. I was overjoyed to see that all the mixed up kids<br/>
&gt; who my daughter thought were her friends dropped her like a hot potato<br/>
&gt; when she came home to school! Yea!<br/>

I&#39;m sorry, I used to be one of those.  I thought hsing was a bit<br/>
interesting, but mostly thought the people who actually did it were just<br/>
weird!<br/>
