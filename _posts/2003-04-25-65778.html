where you can make &quot;square&quot; numbers, and even &quot;cubed&quot; by taking ten <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The book does a great job of explaining things, going all the way <br/>
back to the discovery of math by the Sumerians.  Then it moves <br/>
forward through the Babylonians, Egyptians, Greeks.  <br/>
<br/>
I also looked some basic words up in the dictionary to find their <br/>
roots.  Arithmetic means &quot;the art of measurement&quot; or &quot;the counting <br/>
art&quot;.  Calculus comes from a Greek word for pebble, because they used <br/>
pebbles to &quot;calculate&quot;.  Geometry means &quot;to measure the earth&quot;.  And <br/>
Mathematics means &quot;to think; to be alert; or to learn&quot;.  Mathematics <br/>
is a &quot;group of sciences including arithmetic, geometry, algebra, <br/>
calculus, etc. that deals with quantities, magnitudes, and forms and <br/>
their relationships, attributes, etc.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, for me, a good starting point to math instruction would <br/>
have been an introduction to the roots of the words themselves and a <br/>
history of how we went from tallying our sheep to the math we use <br/>
nowadays.  What I was actually taught was a bunch of meaningless and <br/>
pointless formulas that didn&#39;t fit into my concept of the world.<br/>

<br/>
ME TOO. I feel the same way.<br/>
I discovered it at a workshop on geoboards at a little homeschooling <br/>
convention in New Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
But three different years they showed me some long-division-looking way to <br/>
&quot;calculate a square root.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Well yes.<br/>
<br/>
But my kids and your kids will someday be happy to find out there&#39;s a way to <br/>
do things in writing, and MAYBE it will be easier than the way they&#39;ve <br/>
already figured out to do it in their heads, but maybe not! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the one in my family who has to grab a pencil and paper to &quot;think&quot; when a <br/>
math thing comes up.  I might end up figuring it out in my head, but until I <br/>
have the paper and pencil my brain doesn&#39;t even operate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m crippled!  But at least I&#39;m a hyperactive crippled unschooling <br/>
missionary. LOL!<br/>

Uhh...ummmm....gads...DUH...and why did that never occur to me <br/>
before!!!  Good grief, it was like a little light went on and <br/>
said ..ohhhhh.  The sad part is that I am pretty good at math and <br/>
aced algebra in college and never knew anything you mentioned.  In <br/>
fact, I am currently studying for my GRE and reviewing all <br/>
this &quot;basic&quot; math that I have forgotten.  Your note cracked me up, <br/>
here I am working so hard with the facts and missing the true <br/>
theories behind them all!  It is making me rethink my whole approach!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187088161">Just had to chime in her with my own “discovery” about math and its<br/>
interrelationships.<br/>
<br/>
Did you know that the trig identities “work” because of the Pythagorean<br/>
theorem?<br/>
<br/>
For example, sin2+cos2=1.  The way I learned it was that sin=y/h and<br/>
cos=x/h.  if you substitute those back in, you get<br/>
<br/>
(y/h)2 + (x/h)2=1.  Simplifying, you get:<br/>
<br/>
(x2+y2)/(h2)=1.  By Pythagorean theorem, x2+y2=h2, so the equation<br/>
simplifies to h2/h2=1!<br/>
