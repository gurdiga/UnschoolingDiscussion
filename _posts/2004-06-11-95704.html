 &lt;&lt; Does anyone know of any picture books like this?  When I searched<br/>
 &quot;homeschool books&quot; in the library and online, I only seem to get books<br/>
about<br/>
 homeschooling for adults like The Unschooling Handbook, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I somehow didn&#39;t get the original post this came from, but if you&#39;re<br/>
looking<br/>
 for a picture book about homeschooling, there is a book called _I Am a<br/>
 Homeschooler_ by J. Voetberg. I had it out of our library a few years ago,<br/>
 when I was first interested in homeschooling. The main character, if I<br/>
 recall correctly, is a girl who lives in a rural setting. It didn&#39;t strike<br/>
 me as overly school-at-home-y  at the time, but that was before I really<br/>
 knew much about unschooling &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
