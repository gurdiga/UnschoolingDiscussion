<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634084813">Although,  now our first is such a daddy&#39;s girl, it&#39;s not even funny!!!<br/>
She loves mom, but when dad walks in the room her face lights up like a<br/>
Christmas tree!  So, I guess I had my time and now it&#39;s his.  It eventually<br/>
balances out, I guess. <br/>

My children (both boys) are absolutely and without a doubt devoted<br/>
completely to their father and have been since even before birth.  When I<br/>
was pregnant with my first child he was very busy and active in utero and<br/>
only Daddy&#39;s voice and hands on my belly got him to settle down at night.<br/>
The same has been true for them since they were born.  They call out for<br/>
Daddy in the night (usually) the copy his mannerisms and phrases or<br/>
sayings, they follow him around they house and drop everything to run into<br/>
his arms when he gets home at night.  At the dinner table, when Daddy takes<br/>
a drink the 2.5 year old does too, if he takes a bite of food, so does my<br/>
toddler.  They LOOOOVE to cuddle with their father and play games with him<br/>
and they play Daddies and Babies with thier toy animals and dinosaurs at<br/>
least as often as they play Mommies and Babies.  They stand at the window<br/>
by the front door and look down the street for their father when he is at<br/>
work frequently, they prefer Daddy to read their bedtime story...I could go<br/>
on, but you all get the idea.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1449901909">Such sweetness as you describe below, Nanci, is what makes life more than<br/>
wonderful. I don&#39;t mind if you go on.  I can never hear enough because it<br/>
allows me to appreciate my own joy with my dear daughters!<br/>
