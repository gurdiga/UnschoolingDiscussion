<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373865423">Hi,  I know this probably won&#39;t get me anywhere, but....   I&#39;m trying to find a friend of mine that I met at the national ELCA youth gathering in st. louis, last july.  we both stayed at the adam&#39;s mark hotel, and on the 14th floor.  he wasn&#39;t unschooled, but I thought I might give it a try.  His name was Will Garrison.  Please let me know if you know anything...<br/>
e-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Leslie_emma@...">Leslie_emma@...</a><br/>
thank you,<br/>
Leslie</div>
