<div id="ygrps-yiv-571921183">**Also, I personally love kids.  However, life would certainly be<br/>
*easier* without them.**<br/>
<br/>
What an interesting thread.  This line, in particular, really caught my eye. <br/>
  I really don&#39;t think life would be easier without kids, for *me*.  Perhaps <br/>
it is because I have always wanted so much to have them.  I think, for me, <br/>
there are definitly a lot of life circumstances surrounding that, though.  I <br/>
always wonder how differently I would feel about motherhood had I had a <br/>
different mother, or at least had my own mother been more attentive and <br/>
loving.  Having my first child truly changed my life.  Gave me a focus and <br/>
dreams and plans I really didn&#39;t have before.  I still have such a hard time <br/>
when I see teen mother shows that tell teenagers that a baby won&#39;t change <br/>
their lives for the better because for me, it certainly did.  Having a child <br/>
gave me everything I felt was lacking in my life, internally and externally. <br/>
  I would never encourage a teenager to have a baby, but I know that after <br/>
the fact, there are those who become better people because of it and find a <br/>
peace they have never known.  I&#39;m not naive to the fact that having a baby <br/>
can be a life breaker for some people as well, sad as that is to say.<br/>
<br/>
When I lost my second daughter, Hillary was stillborn at 38 weeks, Haleigh <br/>
was my saving grace.  Having her to focus my energy and love into saved me <br/>
from a deep and paralyzing depression.  It scares me to think of where I <br/>
would be now had it not been for having to come out of the darkness and face <br/>
my responsibilitites as a mother.  Strange as it may sound, and as much as I <br/>
would give anything to have Hillary here with me now, her brief passing <br/>
through my life has given me so much and taught me so many lessons that I <br/>
think only losing a child can teach a person.  I felt this same sentiment in <br/>
the recent posts on losing children.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when I hear people tell me how hard having seven children must be, I <br/>
can honestly say how hard it would be for me not to have them.  They <br/>
brighten up my gloomiest days and fill me with a deep love and passion I had <br/>
never known was even humanly possible.  I&#39;ve had a terrible week.  I&#39;m <br/>
facing things that would drive many people into a spiraling depression.  I <br/>
*have* been depressed.  But when I have to stop the turning world to nurse <br/>
my baby and peer into her beautiful eyes, I am reminded that what we are <br/>
going through will pass.  Everytime we are turned away from a prospective <br/>
house because of our credit, I look at my children and know that it doesn&#39;t <br/>
really matter where we live.  When the house is a mess and life becomes <br/>
overwhelming and I feel like throwing in the towel, a sweet little face <br/>
appears and says, &quot;Mommy, my love you&quot; or &quot;Can we read a story in the closet <br/>
with a flashlight tonight?&quot;  I realize the messes can wait, a house will <br/>
come along and soon, all will be right with my world.<br/>
