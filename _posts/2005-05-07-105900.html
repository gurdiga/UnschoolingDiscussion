&gt;&gt;&gt;I laughed and told him to have a good time, but I wondered after he<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;whether &quot;Toaster Strudle&quot; came up because that&#39;s what he ate in<br/>

We&#39;ve never tried Toaster Strudle either. <br/>

============<br/>
 <br/>
I bet you&#39;re right. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
So in their vocabulary (maybe for the next fifty years) maybe they&#39;ll say,  <br/>
&quot;What, did you invent Toaster Strudel or something?&quot;  Even after toaster  <br/>
strudle is long gone.<br/>
 <br/>
My mom used to have a snarky kind of put-down about &quot;Miss Aster,&quot; like  &quot;Well <br/>
excuuuuse ME, Miss Aster.&quot;  I had no idea who &quot;Miss Aster&quot; was but I  could <br/>
tell my mom didn&#39;t like Miss Aster any more than she liked me. <br/>
