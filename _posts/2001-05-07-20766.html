my perspective that spanking is harmful and violent: (1) the father, imo,<br/>
can&#39;t be trusted to protect the child since he, himself, is able and<br/>
willing to hurt the child and (2) the child is twice betrayed by the<br/>
father&#39;s hitting of the child and by the mother&#39;s inablity to protect<br/>
him/her.  I think spanking causes more psychological damage than we as a<br/>
socitiey would want to believe.  I wouldn&#39;t let my husband take my kids<br/>
out without proper safety restraints in the car and I would speak to<br/>
someone who I knew had unsafte carseats or no carseats and tell them what<br/>
the dangers are.<br/>

in practice today.  The child being threatened with being hit was not<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-401741535">Yes, I do agree that there are two (or more) problems here. My dh does not <br/>
have respect for my parenting decisions. He knows that it is very important <br/>
to me that we not hit (spank) our children.<br/>
<br/>
My dh is going through a difficult time personally right now, but also he&#39;s <br/>
becoming more like his father (not admirable) since the kids came along. In <br/>
many ways he&#39;s a wonderful dad, but since he&#39;s started spanking, it&#39;s become <br/>
a slippery slope he invokes increasingly (at least in threat) in a variety of <br/>
situations that are objectively minor.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve considered leaving, but I don&#39;t think daycare would better for them, and <br/>
realistically that&#39;s what would happen given my resources. He won&#39;t listen to <br/>
me or to any expert. His motto is, &quot;see what everyone else is doing and do <br/>
something different&quot; but somehow it doesn&#39;t apply to spanking. Of course, <br/>
since the experts advocate not spanking, that&#39;s what everyone&#39;s doing, right?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry so long, it&#39;s obviously a sore point for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330141788">I can see why it is.  It sounds as though your husband<br/>
is unhappy, and visiting that unhappiness on the<br/>
entire family.  If you cannot leave him, is there a<br/>
way to help him with his issues, so that he has more<br/>
energy and attention to devote to invest in more<br/>
constructive ways to relate to his family?  I know<br/>
it&#39;s not a simple thing, but perhaps looking at it<br/>
from a cooperative point of view will give *him* more<br/>
room to do the same?<br/>

I was a bit confused as to who wrote this... It has me in tears. This <br/>
is what I was hoping to convey by coming to this list and in writing <br/>
my book. We CAN be friends with our kids. <br/>
<br/>
I finally stopped fearing my parents. They are meek and mild and <br/>
haven&#39;t spanked me since 4th grade, but I feared being myself because <br/>
of losing their approval. I finally (with Laurie&#39;s help) realized <br/>
that my inner turmoil would not stop until I was myself around them. <br/>
I do not have their approval, but I have mine and Laurie&#39;s. I am <br/>
content. <br/>
<br/>
I hope that you have a relationship like ours with your child soon.<br/>

love, Valerie</div>
