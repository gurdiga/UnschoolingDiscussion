&lt;&lt; She loves <br/>
 her baby brother so much and is never mean or even crabby with him. But she <br/>
 seems very angry with me. I understand that part of that is the adjustment <br/>
 to not being the baby anymore. I wonder though if she isn&#39;t upset about not <br/>
 nursing. We had a stop nursing party for her where she enjoyed telling us <br/>
 how big she was. When we go to bed together at night she always wants to <br/>
 cuddle and fondle my breasts. I ask her if she still wants to nurse and she <br/>
 says sometimes. &gt;&gt;<br/>
My daughter weaned herself when I was three month pregnant.  When her brother <br/>
come along she did great durning the first three month, but then she started <br/>
getting really angry and hitting me.  Around six months the anger turning <br/>
towards her bother.  When Matthew was born, and many months afterwards, I <br/>
still asked her if she would like to start nursing again.  She tried twice, <br/>
and said &quot;Yuck&quot;  but was really happy that I offered.  In her mind, I think <br/>
she equated nursing with love, even though she wanted to be the really big <br/>
girl, a part of her wanted to still be the baby.  I noticed that if I held <br/>
her as much as possible and as ofter as she wanted (as possible) even if I <br/>
didn&#39;t get last nights dishes done, or a shower until my hubby came home, she <br/>
was more happy and less aggressive.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t read &quot;Siblings without Rivarly&quot; it is an excellent book.  In <br/>
the opening around pg 39, it talkes about how we would feel if our hubbys <br/>
said &quot;Sweetheart, I love you sooooo much I have decided to have another wife&quot; <br/>
then proceeds to spend almost all of his time taking care her.....hmmmm I am <br/>
feeling jealous and angry just in that statement alone but it goes on...and <br/>
on with common statements that we used with our older baby when we bring a <br/>
new baby in the house.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I feel overwhelmed sometimes just with <br/>
 </span></blockquote>my new son but it upsets me to see how angry she gets.She never acted out <br/>
like this before. Any advice?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She may just want you to offer, she may not even take you up on the offer, <br/>
but don&#39;t count on it.  Having two little ones can be overwhelming, <br/>
ecspecially when you have tons of other stuff to do....I think whether you <br/>
have 2 children or more the advice stays the same, when you add a new baby <br/>
get rid of everything extra you can, ask for more help from hubby or whoever, <br/>
and simplify, simplify, simplify......so the floor doesn&#39;t get washed this <br/>
week, spend that extra 10 minutes cuddling the older baby....you get the <br/>
idea....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
    I am new to unschooling and am still having some trouble with it. My <br/>
children have never been in school but we homeschooled in a fairly <br/>
traditional way. <br/>
<br/>
Simplify, simplify.....even traditional schooling is flexible and can take <br/>
some &quot;teacher &quot;days off.....that is one of the joys of homeschooling....you <br/>
kids may love the free time to look for things that interest them....<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
Happy Mothering,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174010470">Thank you all for the great advice. It is so great to know that someone is <br/>
out there. I have one question. Why isn&#39;t simplifying simple?<br/>
Thanks again. You made my week.<br/>
