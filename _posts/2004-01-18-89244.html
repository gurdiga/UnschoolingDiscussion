<div id="ygrps-yiv-226411391">Laura, thanks for posting that, it was a timely thing for me to <br/>
read. I&#39;ve been thinking about this a lot lately -- because of a <br/>
desire to help people with knowledge and skills that I have, I have <br/>
known for a long time that I would like to teach childbirth <br/>
education. And be compensated for it of course. Yet money creates <br/>
problems with my vision on many levels. For one thing, if I&#39;m <br/>
charging I have to consider doing what people have come to expect <br/>
from people in this field. Starting out, I would be expected to show <br/>
evidence of a certain level of expertise, which means training and <br/>
certification (which in itself would cost *me* quite a bit of money) <br/>
and the classes would need to cover a range of things that I am not <br/>
necessarily interested in teaching about; it seems a simple enough <br/>
thing to just offer an approach I am comfortable with, yet because <br/>
no one else is doing it yet (and I have not done it yet myself) <br/>
there is not a precedent to help me and clients determine cost-<br/>
worth. There are other problems with it as well. One is from the <br/>
client side -- the client cannot be in it just for the learning that <br/>
they are ready for and desire, they feel they also have to &quot;get <br/>
something for my money.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Last year I witnessed something heartbreaking that really made me <br/>
aware of this in a big way. I signed my boys up for an art class. <br/>
The children&#39;s ages in the class ranged from 3-6 years old, so my <br/>
daughter (who was 2 at the time) could not be officially enrolled, <br/>
but the teacher was fine with her using the art supplies. Sometimes <br/>
my daughter would be into it, but sometimes she would be more <br/>
interested in running around in a nearby room normally used for <br/>
dance classes. Well, there was a very young boy, probably only just <br/>
turned 3, who related to my daughter more than to the other kids in <br/>
the class, who were all older than him. He also seemed to be just <br/>
barely interested in working with the art materials. So everyone <br/>
would be sitting around doing their projects and my daughter would <br/>
wander off and immediately he would be aware of this and would want <br/>
to wander off with her. His mom was pretty successful at keeping him <br/>
working at the table. The trouble began when my boys decided to go <br/>
run around with their sister, which I had no problem with; nor did <br/>
it interfere with the teacher&#39;s teaching, as really it only amounted <br/>
to laying out basic projects and supplies and letting everyone have <br/>
at it. But now this little boy couldn&#39;t stand it, because other kids <br/>
in the class were allowed a freedom he wasn&#39;t. It clearly didn&#39;t <br/>
make sense to him. Usually his mom could coerce him into staying in <br/>
the classroom, but one day he just absolutely rebelled. He would not <br/>
listen to her. He started running around with my daughter gleefully <br/>
(my boys were still working on their projects.) His mom tolerated <br/>
this for a minute or two, then told him he had to get back to the <br/>
class. The teacher herself tried to coax him back to class, no doubt <br/>
feeling guilty that she was taking his mother&#39;s money yet couldn&#39;t <br/>
do her job, i.e., keep his attention. But he was just absolutely <br/>
done with art and wouldn&#39;t go back. This is when it got ugly. She <br/>
started guilt tripping him (&quot;I pay all this money, and you&#39;re not <br/>
even doing it. Well maybe I just won&#39;t ever pay for you to take a <br/>
class again.&quot;) He still resisted, and she got more angry and more <br/>
forceful. This struggle went on for quite a while, and finally he <br/>
gave in and went back with her. It was awful. I thought, geez, good <br/>
way to encourage a love of art and learning in this poor kid. But <br/>
all she could think about was that she wasn&#39;t getting her money&#39;s <br/>
worth. I&#39;m not suggesting that the teacher should have done these <br/>
classes for free (she appeared to be a poor art-student type, for <br/>
all I know she was relying on those classes to pay her rent,) only <br/>
that the experience for both teacher and student was spoiled because <br/>
money and obligation were primary concerns for the adults involved.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I don&#39;t know yet what the answer for me is, how I will be <br/>
able to reconcile these things. Maybe this would only be a temporary <br/>
fix, I don&#39;t know how satisfying it would ultimately be, but the <br/>
other night it occured to me that I could just leave money out of <br/>
the equation until it naturally becomes part of the equation (could <br/>
it be possible that it would?) It really opens things up when you <br/>
don&#39;t expect to be monetarily compensated. It opens *people* up, <br/>
because whatever relationship develops has nothing to do with it <br/>
being a business deal, which makes people tend to feel guarded and <br/>
snarky and vulnerable. It would give me flexibility and freedom to <br/>
discover the approach to this work that is most personally <br/>
fulfilling to me. As far as mentorship goes, if I expect to be paid <br/>
I have to expect to pay (in money and obligations attached to that <br/>
money.) But instead I could call the local midwife up and say, &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
here, I&#39;m not competition and I don&#39;t expect anything in return, I <br/>
just want to learn and give something to the community (teach). Can <br/>
you use me or help me find a way to do this?&quot; How could she resist?<br/>
<br/>
Still thinking about this, but while I can (that is, while money <br/>
does not *need* to be the focus for me) do it this way, it is <br/>
looking like a pretty attractive way to do what I want to do.<br/>

  =========================================================================================<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s tough to offer a class to unschoolers. My kids take art classes and karate, but they&#39;re in a more formal setting where they are expected to behave in a certain way and we are free to stop coming for whatever reason (out the $$, of course). And we&#39;re likely the only homeschoolers in the class, never mind unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
But we had a friend offer an American Sign Language class (she might be reading this now and could speak to the issue better than I) where most of the students were unschoolers of vastly different ages. I know she struggled with a lot of the same issues that the article raises--how much structure to enforce or expect, what to do when students or her son were no longer interested in what was going on, how to gear the lessons to kids of varying ages, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Initially, my girls really wanted to sign up but then lost interest part way through. I was still interested and felt an obligation (in a good way) to continue to attend, so I told my girls that they could color while I paid attention. Chances are we were more disruptive than anyone because my kids were the youngest members there. Overall, I really enjoyed taking the class and learned a lot, which my kids then picked up at home while I was practicing. So I think it was a positive experience overall, for us. But I don&#39;t know that my friend will ever offer another class again. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you can do something structured with a whole group of unschoolers. I don&#39;t know how that would work really, but it&#39;s interesting to think about.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about classes a lot lately.  My oldest daughter <br/>
currently takes ballet in a group with other teens and adults and voice in a private <br/>
lesson.  She has also studied violin, both privately and in a group off and on, <br/>
since she was 3.  My other 5 kids have never taken any formal lessons with <br/>
the exception of Antonio playing Pop Warner football one year.<br/>
<br/>
I often feel guilty that I don&#39;t have enough money for all of my kids to take <br/>
lessons in a lot of things right now.  I&#39;m starting to let it go because I <br/>
realize that although some of them have expressed interest in classes, I was <br/>
usually the one who brought lessons up and made them seem great.  I&#39;m starting to <br/>
realize that I was the one who always wanted to take all these lessons, and <br/>
that right now, I am the one who should probably take them if we can afford it. <br/>
 I&#39;ve always felt guilty spending money on lessons for me.  I&#39;ve thought that <br/>
I owed it to my kids to give them all these advantages.  Now I&#39;ve realized <br/>
that I really need to listen to what they want and not my expectations of what <br/>
would be fun for them.  Right now, Emily teaches ballet to Antonio, Paige, <br/>
JoAnn, and me a couple of times a week, very informally, and that is probably <br/>
enough of that for now.  If they want lessons in the future, we&#39;ll work it out.  <br/>
For now, if I want to learn something and I can&#39;t teach myself, I&#39;m going to <br/>
invest our money in my learning.  Then if my children express an interest, I <br/>
will be able to show them what I learned without the structure and challenges of <br/>
more formal learning situations.<br/>

here at least not in the sense I am seeing so much of these days. I think it&#39;s <br/>
great for those who want it but my kids have always resisted anything that felt <br/>
like school. But they will do very short term things and they will try things <br/>
that are not age segregated. My 16yro and I did a weekend airbrush body tattoo <br/>
workshop together this past fall and then my 12yros and husband took a one <br/>
day airbrush class. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482718768">Hi Linda,<br/>
<br/>
I have also considered teaching childbirth ed. I have taken a class a<br/>
few years ago to be a doula and one of my teachers was a childbirth<br/>
educator as well as a doula, so I got to sit in on one of her<br/>
classes. Then when I was pregnant I spent all my time studying for<br/>
the birth. I feel like I know a lot. I cannot do it yet because my<br/>
daughter is only two, but as she gets older I think it would be good<br/>
for her if she got to be around classes like that. <br/>
<br/>
What I know about my teacher&#39;s practice: she started out as a Bradley<br/>
instructor but by the time I met her she had decided that she did not<br/>
agree with everything this method teaches. So she did not renew her<br/>
certification, but was teaching from her own &#39;curriculum&#39;. The class<br/>
I attended has 5 couples and she charged $100 a couple. <br/>
<br/>
I have talked &#39;business issues&#39; to other doulas and childbirth<br/>
educators, and it seems that while being compensated is a nice perk,<br/>
the big thing also is respect. A lot of couples will sign up for<br/>
class and then never go, unless they spent money. And same with<br/>
doulas - if the client didn&#39;t pay, there is a good chance that they<br/>
will not evel call you for the birth. <br/>
<br/>
I know how it can feel really strange asking to be paid for something<br/>
you&#39;d do for free, and asking actual people and not a company. But I<br/>
think at least a symbolic charge is necessary in order for you to be<br/>
respected. <br/>
