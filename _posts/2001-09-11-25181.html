<div id="ygrps-yiv-1554908269">I&#39;ve just sufted through four HUNDRED and some messages. See this was my <br/>
obsession and now that I&#39;ve started to wane off a bit, I can&#39;t keep up.<br/>
<br/>
I read the eureka moments and wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
Recently my huge debate with tv was the turning point for me and my son.  <br/>
Thanks so much for everyone on here and the website for sharing their lives <br/>
and stories. And while I&#39;ve gotten too irked to read many of her messages, I <br/>
understand where Bridgett is coming from. It&#39;s (hopefully) the last great <br/>
stance. For me it&#39;s sort of like peeling layers, and frightfully hanging onto <br/>
that last one...afraid of what&#39;s *really* underneath.<br/>
<br/>
I think right now the biggest factors for me are, treating my son as I would <br/>
a friend or spouse and believing to the core that he is already a great <br/>
person and that I don&#39;t need to, nor would be able to, mold him into being <br/>
one.  And that sort of allows everything else to fall into place. And, as <br/>
someone on the website suggested, I&#39;m letting him show me the way. It&#39;s <br/>
really cool! And while he&#39;s only 3, I have more thoroughly enjoyed our <br/>
relationship in just the last couple weeks. And he has too, he&#39;s opened up <br/>
more, offered to help me with different things, etc. And he&#39;s a very verbal <br/>
articulate child, has been for awhile, and we&#39;re talking a lot more. I&#39;ve <br/>
always wished he&#39;d just play more freely and I&#39;ve seen him do that more <br/>
lately.<br/>
<br/>
I have related to the fears of, if I don&#39;t step in.....then what? How will he <br/>
learn to control himself, care for others, feed himself, etc. And they <br/>
ultimately all come from the belief that my son is somehow bad, less, wrong, <br/>
etc. and needs to be taught how to be good, more, right, etc.<br/>
<br/>
And a couple of weeks ago I would have thoroughly believed that my son had an <br/>
addiction to the tv, or was more prone to addiction, blah blah blah. But I <br/>
don&#39;t feel that way now. I&#39;m not doubting that there are people out there <br/>
with it born in, but I&#39;ve known a *lot* of addicts, myself one, and I&#39;ve <br/>
never known one that didn&#39;t have a traumatic childhood and used addiction as <br/>
self medication.<br/>
<br/>
My issue now is extending this past just my son and I. Like being around <br/>
other parents and families who are thoroughly opposite this philosophy. I <br/>
think it&#39;s a personal issue of mine, not wanting conflict or criticism.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just wanted to share....I think I *get it* now and I wanted to thank <br/>
everyone here, and I&#39;m sure my son thanks you too!<br/>

Especially with family who are probably not following the unschooling life <br/>
and want to &quot;correct&quot; your children or treat them in a manner you find <br/>
disrespectful. . . what do you say. . . how do you handle it. . . does it <br/>
depend on what age the child is as to what you say? I am really interested in <br/>
this one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know LOTS of addicts.  Most of them are relatives.  Some are recovering<br/>
alcoholics, some are heavy smokers, some can&#39;t live without coca-cola.  A<br/>
few are hooked on gambling.  There is a sexually addicted memebr.  I&#39;ve<br/>
seen addiction, and compuslsive behavior in lots of different forms.  Did<br/>
we all have bad childhoods?  Nope, on the contrary, we all had very<br/>
pleasant happy ones for the most part.<br/>
On the other had, I&#39;ve had people tell me they or their children are<br/>
addictive and just can&#39;t help themselves who were using it for an excuse.<br/>
 I&#39;d watch them suddenly change their tunes when the time was right for<br/>
them to.  And suddenly, they are all better.  No more struggles, no more<br/>
cravings, etc.  It doesn&#39;t work that way.<br/>
I truly believe that there is a genectic connection between addiction,<br/>
obsessive-compulsive disorder, bi-polar and depressive disorders and<br/>
allergies.  I think these things are all connected in ways we don&#39;t yet<br/>
comprehend.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m glad that your son is normal.  But the next time you have to<br/>
put a band-aid on his arm, give him an extra hug and be glad the band-aid<br/>
is because he fell down and not because he picked himself open for the<br/>
third time today.<br/>

<br/>
Brenda, <br/>
I read your post twice and saved it with my small set of favorites.<br/>
<br/>
For others who may not be to that point with their kids yet, here&#39;s an <br/>
analogy not involving Satan or Teletubbies:<br/>
<br/>
The same way a school curriculum tries to promise happiness and completion <br/>
(learn this, forget about anything else, and you&#39;ll be happy and successful), <br/>
so the &quot;child raising&quot; lists can seem that way.  Make sure your kid has table <br/>
manners, can share, says please and thank you, picks socks and towels up, <br/>
makes his bed (add your own favorite other six things), and you&#39;ve done your <br/>
job as a mom!  TaDaa!! He&#39;s ready to go out into the world and have a <br/>
power-lunch at the Hilton!<br/>
<br/>
But there are hundreds of thousands of things to learn about behavior and <br/>
interactions and homes and yards and we don&#39;t know which will be the most <br/>
important or which will present themselves.  Mildew prevention can be way <br/>
more fascinating than shirt-folding, and could lead to a lifelong fascination <br/>
with biochemistry or architectural engineering.<br/>
<br/>
Treating a child as a young human who lives in our house instead of &quot;our kid&quot; <br/>
or &quot;a five year old&quot; or any other designation that comes with all kinds of <br/>
pre-conceived behavioral notions closes more doors than it opens.  Seeing the <br/>
child as an honored guest who will stay with you untl he chooses to leave <br/>
opens all the doors in the universe.<br/>
<br/>
I read once somewhere (I though it was Polly Berends, but I could never find <br/>
the quote) that we should treat each child as though he were the Messiah.   I <br/>
said that once on a list or in a forum with a lot of Christian homeschoolers <br/>
(it was several years back before there was much separation) and one mom <br/>
snapped back very defensively &quot;TRUST ME, my kid is NOT the second coming.&quot;   <br/>
I felt really bad for her child.  <br/>
<br/>
There are other religions that also suggest treating children like gods, <br/>
seeing the godliness in them.   And in fact Christianity does too.  But <br/>
that&#39;s not the verse most families choose to keep in mind when they deal with <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus made a pretty good threat about people who mistreat children, but I <br/>
don&#39;t hear it quoted in homeschooling forums.  And the whole &quot;When did we see <br/>
you hungry and feed you, or naked and clothed you?&quot; passage *should* apply to <br/>
children, but it&#39;s rarely made to do so.  People use it to promote visiting <br/>
sick people in hospitals and charity to prisoners, but they forget to turn <br/>
around and treat those children who are tugging at their clothes as the <br/>
representatives of Christ.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1447315958">Sandra, thank you for your beautiful words.  I have, as a result of this<br/>
unschooling list, even with all the arguments going on lately, decided to<br/>
throw out my chore cards.  When they were undone, I felt like I had<br/>
failed and like I should be more in control of things.  When I thought<br/>
about it, I realized it was an obsessive attempt at gaining control of a<br/>
situation which wasn&#39;t even out of control in the first place.  It was as<br/>
a result of someone&#39;s advice years ago to my husband, who has a problem<br/>
with the house due to his dysfunctional childhood.  So, my kids and I<br/>
have discussed it and have decided that we will all work together on the<br/>
house and will just keep a look-out for things that need to be done.  We<br/>
have also decided to give up the program of schooling we had been doing<br/>
and to just have the books and games available and that I am available<br/>
should anyone want assistance with them.  This is really a daring step<br/>
for me, since I am a rather insecure person.  But I have felt for some<br/>
time that God wanted me to learn about all this unschooling business<br/>
since I kept coming upon it &quot;accidentally&quot;.  The unschooling ideals have<br/>
also helped me in other areas of my life like bills and working and<br/>
scheduling everything.  I knew I had control issues, because I kept<br/>
getting scared or mad about things and wondering why and I could only<br/>
come to the conclusion that I felt out of control.  Now I am giving<br/>
myself permission to be out of control.  Thank you again.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son is not normal, and neither am I. I no longer believe in normal. And I <br/>
really didn&#39;t even get the rest of this. <br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t wish to be rude but I usually lack tact and I feel the need to <br/>
be blunt here. If most of your relatives are addicts, then it&#39;s a family <br/>
illness and it most likely stemmed from all of your upbringings. If you have <br/>
children on prozac and an entire history of family addiction, the tv is not <br/>
the problem. Find some serious 12 step groups and counseling. I know, I know, <br/>
I&#39;m judging you without knowing you. But so far most everything you&#39;ve <br/>
described fits right in with the codependent format, imo.<br/>
<br/>
I also had an injury that kept me on my back for a time and I was so grateful <br/>
that my son could watch tv, which he did a lot then. One because we never had <br/>
cable and suddenly we did and two because quite possibly it was his own <br/>
little escape from all the emotional problems he had. I was flat on my back <br/>
and couldn&#39;t get up hardly at all. It never occurred to me that he was using <br/>
tv to help him through his own emotional struggles until someone in this <br/>
forum suggested it to me. And there have been other family problems...and I <br/>
now think his current use of tv is from the emotional stuff that I thought <br/>
should be over by now. But by turning my complete focus onto him and joining <br/>
what he is doing, completely, I see it from a completely different angle. So <br/>
consider that maybe he isn&#39;t addicted, but he&#39;s using it to comfort him from <br/>
the uncontrollable pains of his life outside the tv.<br/>

He is a smaller human than me, but no less of one. And while I&#39;m not <br/>

just kids or babies or elderly or saintly. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m glad that your son is normal.  But the next time you have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; put a band-aid on his arm, give him an extra hug and be glad the<br/>
band-aid<br/>
&gt; &gt; is because he fell down and not because he picked himself open for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; third time today.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son is not normal, and neither am I. I no longer believe in normal. And<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; really didn&#39;t even get the rest of this.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I really don&#39;t wish to be rude but I usually lack tact and I feel the need<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; be blunt here. If most of your relatives are addicts, then it&#39;s a family<br/>
&gt; illness and it most likely stemmed from all of your upbringings. If you<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; children on prozac and an entire history of family addiction, the tv is<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; the problem. Find some serious 12 step groups and counseling. I know, I<br/>
know,<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m judging you without knowing you. But so far most everything you&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; described fits right in with the codependent format, imo.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I also had an injury that kept me on my back for a time and I was so<br/>
grateful<br/>
&gt; that my son could watch tv, which he did a lot then. One because we never<br/>
had<br/>
&gt; cable and suddenly we did and two because quite possibly it was his own<br/>
&gt; little escape from all the emotional problems he had. I was flat on my<br/>
back<br/>
&gt; and couldn&#39;t get up hardly at all. It never occurred to me that he was<br/>
using<br/>
&gt; tv to help him through his own emotional struggles until someone in this<br/>
&gt; forum suggested it to me. And there have been other family problems...and<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; now think his current use of tv is from the emotional stuff that I thought<br/>
&gt; should be over by now. But by turning my complete focus onto him and<br/>
joining<br/>
&gt; what he is doing, completely, I see it from a completely different angle.<br/>
So<br/>
&gt; consider that maybe he isn&#39;t addicted, but he&#39;s using it to comfort him<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; the uncontrollable pains of his life outside the tv.<br/>

I just wanted to thank you for this post.  I am a bit drained at the<br/>
moment.  What with an exchange student who needed to call home and<br/>
reassure his parents and my three kids, and two of their friends all here<br/>
tonight watching the coverage and discussing. Five teens just basically<br/>
need me so I am just a bit too busy to think enough to respond to it<br/>
clearly.  Heck, it was just a fluke that I saw this post.<br/>
So, are the people on this list always that &#39;compassionate&#39;?<br/>

since you are not a medical professional nor do you &quot;walk in her shoes&quot; you<br/>
are not in a position to say otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, have worked in the rehab field, both physical and<br/>
acute psych and I can tell you that the description matches low level OCD<br/>
and addictive personality traits.  So, since the descriptions match I<br/>
haven&#39;t felt a need to question the diagnosis.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983134866">When I became a parent I thought it was a doing to<br/>
rather than a providing for. Even providing for<br/>
doesn&#39;t really descibe what I mean because some of<br/>
parenting has become a striving to be available. My<br/>
growth has lead me down the unschooling path which I<br/>
originally saw as giving as a gift to my children. (as<br/>
if they needed to learn how to learn) Now I see<br/>
unschooling is the way that allows children to *be*<br/>
the learning people they are. <br/>
<br/>
I have had an even greater AH AH momment when I<br/>
decided to re-read Whole Child/Whole Parent by Polly<br/>
Berends. I had tried to read it a few years ago but I<br/>
was still in a need to what I see know as fix my<br/>
spirited dd rather than help her/ support her. When I<br/>
read some of her words I had an immediate falling away<br/>
of tension and awareness of what *I* needed to do so<br/>
my very spirited dd could be *allowed* to be who she<br/>
*already is* a loving, learning, brite, etc...child. <br/>
<br/>
When I shared with Dh about this thread and seeing our<br/>
children as the Messiah. He said ooh that makes a lot<br/>
of sense. Just think his mother believed he was the<br/>
son of God. So when she looked at him she saw the son<br/>
of God. So she always saw good. So how could Jesus<br/>
help but become good. So it has become very important<br/>
to me to see the true pure child even when her<br/>
behavior does not seem in accordance with that. That<br/>
upset/negative behavior is only an aberation or an<br/>
indication of some unmet need. <br/>
<br/>

Alcoholics.  That means you have personal life experiences with an alcoholic<br/>

&gt; &gt; Just because there&#39;s a difference doesn&#39;t mean everytime a mom wants to<br/>
&gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;my kid is an addict and so...&quot; that she&#39;s right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247695929">Figuring it out for them never really works because most of the time the<br/>
figuring out is from a place that the person doing the figuring is coming<br/>
from and not the person who is supposedly being helped and is soooo very<br/>
unschooling &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Offering help, offering to share experiences, just being there are IMHO the<br/>
way to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, I&#39;m not a psych expert, but yes, I&#39;ve worked with many different addicts <br/>
in my life. I have experienced serious addiction first hand, in my family, <br/>
and in my surrounding community (friends and spouses who for some strange <br/>
reason are either addicts themselves or one is a big part of their lives). <br/>
I&#39;ve been a part of aa and al-anon, and I didn&#39;t just read one little <br/>
article. I&#39;ve read tons of books on addiction and self-help. This makes me no <br/>
expert whatsoever.  It just means sometimes I can spot things that fit into <br/>
the format, and I was just stating my opinion. I could be wrong, way off, <br/>
etc. I wasn&#39;t implying that it was a family &#39;fault&#39; so much as I was saying a <br/>
family illness.  I don&#39;t care what genetic research says, I believe addiction <br/>
is both genetic and environmental. While some children of alcoholics may not <br/>
become addicts themselves, many fall into codependent coping <br/>
behaviors....controlling, overworking, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So I have walked a mile....a few actually.<br/>

people off on here. I never ever mentioned you or was anywhere NEAR talking <br/>
about you in my post, was I? No, I was not. Yet you continually jump to <br/>
conclusions about how everyone is telling you what to do. For the record, I <br/>
have not offered any opinion on the subject of addictions nor do I intend to. <br/>
 I was simply commenting on Lynda&#39;s dialog about how she was better informed <br/>
on this issue because of her education, which I find absurd.<br/>
