<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316767422">The old text-based online multi-player role playing games worked for us.<br/>
Type fast or die!  It wasn&#39;t formal or anything but we all learned how to<br/>
type fast on the keyboard.  I&#39;m not sure what the age limit is (I think 13)<br/>
on Everquest but my son enjoyed watching us play.  He has gotten fast<br/>
playing online games too (he&#39;s 9).  He just gets online and finds games to<br/>
play.  I find him at the lego website quite often or at Disney.com.<br/>

<br/>
I recommend playing with anything you can download or borrow before spending <br/>
money.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of structured homeschoolers like Mavis Beacon.  There are other games <br/>
for &quot;typing readiness&quot; like QuickKey and KeyBoom and Mario Teaches Typing.  <br/>
<br/>
If you can find some download sites online (shareware or freeware) you could <br/>
find some to try, or maybe you have friends who could help you.   AOL has a <br/>
big freeware library.<br/>
<br/>
My son has the kind of keyboard that&#39;s angled and split down the middle, so <br/>
that&#39;s going to cover left/right hand for him, without him even trying.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-333187974">My kids loved Mario teaches typing  but they were 3 and 6 at the <br/>
time.   It has tests to see how fast you are which is pretty cool  <br/>
but I don&#39;t know how anyone else feels about the program.  We got <br/>
ours at a rummage sale for 10 cents so i was no big thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327042845">My kids liked &quot;Jump Start Typing&quot;. It&#39;s like a video game. For example, <br/>
little people ski down a mountain at increasing speeds, and you have to type <br/>
the letters they are holding up before they go past a certain point. You have <br/>
to sit with them at first to make sure their fingers are on the correct keys. <br/>
It&#39;s worth the small amount of time sitting with them at the beginning until <br/>
they get the hang of it!<br/>
<br/>
I wish someone had helped me learn to type. One of the reasons I hang out in <br/>
lurkdom is that I&#39;m such a slow typist that it takes me forever to express an <br/>
opinion. (I know, I know----I should take a course myself)<br/>

<br/>
I covered up the letters on the keys with tape and went through at least<br/>
part of a typing book to learn where to put my fingers when I was in high<br/>
school. Covering up the keys forced my fingers to memorize where the leters<br/>
were!<br/>
<br/>
But my husband types just as fast with two fingers, looking at the keys.<br/>
<br/>
The more you type, the better you get.<br/>

in for the Disney type products but this one is fun.  Good typing habits are <br/>
embedded in the games.  Probably not good for true vegetarians as there is <br/>
bug eating involved.<br/>

With unschooling, if you call it &quot;playing&quot; instead of &quot;taking a course&quot; <br/>
you&#39;re a giant-step closer to unschooling being part of the air instead of <br/>
part of school-option.<br/>

My husband and his friends spend 8-10 hours a day in a fantasy role playing<br/>

with my kids.  So to me, it is real life and involves real life<br/>
accomplishments in the real world.  My son has become quite interested in<br/>
programming because of the games he plays and what he sees his dad doing all<br/>
day:  working with his friends making fun things to do!  Imagine spending<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it depends on the quality of the fiction you are reading and also how <br/>
much time you are committing to it. I read stuff often for short time periods <br/>
that I consider purely escapist. I also take pleasure in some very stupid TV <br/>
and other escapist pastimes. Those things are fun and a great way to unwind.  <br/>
But, I try hard to be selective about how I spend large amounts of time. If <br/>
I&#39;m going to spend a lot of time on something, I want it to be memorable, <br/>
enlightening or productive. One chapter of Tom Sawyer or an E.L. Doktorow <br/>
book are worth ten R.L Stine books or true romance novels. One half hour of <br/>
NPR news is worth more than 10 episodes of a soap opera. There really is a <br/>
reason why Mark Twain is constantly quoted and R.L. Stine is not.  One way to <br/>
think of it is food for thought. Are you on a steady diet of real nourishing <br/>
food (for the mind and spirit)with a delicious desert or candy treat <br/>
occasionally?&quot;, or &quot;Does your entire diet every day consist of candy <br/>
(anesthesia for the mind and spirit)? I see the obsession today with video <br/>
games as just another drug. I like a glass of wine, but wouldn&#39;t drink 5 <br/>
bottles in the name of fun.  All things in moderation....<br/>
