elementary school here is requiring studenst to have signed permission<br/>
slips from a parent before they can check the books out from the school<br/>

Here&#39;s the ACLU page about it, with a quiz where you can try to guess why<br/>

There was an article in The Onion (HEAVY satire) which some Christians picked <br/>
up and thought was true/real/not humor and sent it around like a panicky <br/>

dangerous horror among us.<br/>

There are books that we &quot;christians&quot; prefer that our<br/>
children do not read . So what ? They will reach an<br/>
age where they will pick what they read and do soon<br/>
enough .<br/>
Atleast we&#39;re not so caught up in the fact that they<br/>
ARE reading that it doesn&#39;t matter to us WHAT it is !<br/>
 Control our children ? How about guide them until<br/>
they each the age they can make good choices for<br/>
themselves . You can&#39;t just throw them out there and<br/>
say ,&quot;do whatever makes you feel good&quot; . Please !<br/>

San Antonio soon. I find Arizona to be conservative enough....<br/>
<br/>
I do think book banning is about fear. I guess I can sort of see why<br/>
people would maybe want to ban how-to information in books, like a book<br/>
about how to successfully kidnap and murder someone, or how to molest a<br/>
child and get away with it. I have a harder time understanding why <br/>
people want to ban ideas...<br/>

about the author of these books. Some Christians couldn&#39;t see that it was<br/>
*satire* and passed it on to millions of people as &quot;fact&quot;. That has<br/>

I think you mean the Anarchist Cookbook, though the  ANTarchist Cookbook<br/>
could be interesting.<br/>

You know, the apples and oranges comparison of Harry  Potter and the<br/>
Anarchist Cookbook is really annoying, however, if my son wanted to<br/>
check out the Anarchist Cookbook, I&#39;d let him. Of course, we already own<br/>
three copies, one of them unexpurgated...<br/>

as I know. Do you mean Anarchist or Antichrist?<br/>
<br/>
And juuuust out of curiousity, are you and/or your family unschooling?<br/>

What age is that?  If they don&#39;t have the opportunity to make choices,<br/>
how will they ever make good ones for themselves.  If someone else is<br/>
making the choices, how is that unschooling?   Why are young children<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600006259">&lt;&lt;  Is HP not a &quot;how to&quot; book written in story form ?<br/>
Informational - ideas ? A ban is a ban , right ? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How to WHAT?<br/>
<br/>
No, it is NOT a &quot;&#39;how to&#39; book written in story form.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it banned in Texas?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nah, I misread the Texas reference.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wonder if that&#39;s part of why it&#39;s banned in Texas,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; because some of those <br/>
&gt; who want to control what their children read don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; read very well themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How offensive ! How dare you !<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is that the general thought here on this list ? <br/>
There are books that we &quot;christians&quot; prefer that our<br/>
children do not read . So what ? -=-<br/>
<br/>
OH... I was reading backwards and had missed this.<br/>
<br/>
No, the suggestion wasn&#39;t that they preferred their children didn&#39;t read, it <br/>
was that some of them THEMSELVES didn&#39;t read very well and were <br/>
misinterpretting (out of kneejerk paranoia or  prejudice or something) what <br/>
they HAD read (as in the Onion, or as in this forum today).<br/>
<br/>
If you read thoughtfully and make your own decisions, you won&#39;t believe <br/>
people who tell you things like that Harry Potter is a how-to book in story <br/>
form.<br/>
<br/>
-=-At least we&#39;re not so caught up in the fact that they<br/>
ARE reading that it doesn&#39;t matter to us WHAT it is !-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are things in the Bible I wouldn&#39;t really want my kids reading.  Lots <br/>
of Christians I knew well when I was involved there used to claim to have <br/>
read the whole Bible, but they hadn&#39;t really, because when asked about <br/>
certain things that were in there they&#39;d blanch as though I had said the F <br/>
word.  But if my kids do decide to read it I&#39;ll be willing to just talk to <br/>
them about it, and look up other people&#39;s explanations of what those <br/>
offensive passages might be considered useful for, whether it was history of <br/>
the Hebrews, or allegory, or what it might have been.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You can&#39;t just throw them out there and<br/>
say ,&quot;do whatever makes you feel good&quot; . Please !&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, but you don&#39;t need to throw them into a library edited and sanitized by <br/>
Christians who didn&#39;t even read the books they&#39;re responding to, just saying <br/>
&quot;ME TOO&quot; to some chain letter that went around by e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What exactly does HP teach kids how to do? I&#39;ve tried all the spells and<br/>
none of them work... -=-<br/>
<br/>
You tried them!?<br/>
Just trying them will get you sent to Christian Homeschooling HELL.<br/>
And if you THOUGHT about trying them, it&#39;s as bad as if you did it.<br/>
You&#39;ve commited Satanical sin in your heart.<br/>
<br/>
(Or was that satirical sin?)<br/>

What age is that?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The age of accountability.&quot;  Differs from person to person (although some <br/>
churches put a minimum age on it because of some kid-prejudice or other).<br/>
<br/>
Interesting that fundamentalist Christians who WILL take their child&#39;s word <br/>
for their having had a personal relationship with Jesus commence in their <br/>
hearts, and who will consent to their baptism as their spiritual equal, will <br/>
still control their morals after that.  Either they don&#39;t think that child <br/>
with Jesus&#39; guidance can make good decisions (like about what book to read, <br/>
or what the effect of reading a book might be on their eternal soul), or they <br/>
don&#39;t REALLY think the child was old enough to know what he was talking about <br/>
about that born-again experience, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228994572">Actually, had you read the subject line that you responded under, and read<br/>
the original posta, it was about banned books. Sure consent forms came up<br/>
but so did Harry Porter and your response there was all about censorship.<br/>
This list is about unschooling which, IMNSHO, is all about INDIVIDUAL<br/>
choices and not designating children as a lesser species simply because they<br/>
can&#39;t vote yet!<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have consent forms at our local library and I have yet to see any<br/>
problem with that.<br/>
<br/>
Besides which, libraries aren&#39;t babysitter services, so what would children<br/>
too young to make relatively educated choices be doing at a library without<br/>
their parents anyway?  Seems to me that if they are old enough to be there<br/>
unsupervised they should be able to make their own choices.<br/>

&gt; &gt; The Antarchist<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Cookbook from that same elementary school library<br/>
&gt; &gt; ? But wait ..... it<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   The problem with this is , what ? That<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ELEMENTARY  age children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to have parental permission .<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if that same young child can check<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Antarchist<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cookbook from that same elementary school<br/>
&gt; library<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ? But wait ..... it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be a crime according to you all if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; couldn&#39;t , right ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; God help us all !<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m I the only one on this list that feels<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; Harry Potter is #1, of course. I saw on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; news<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tonight that one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elementary school here is requiring<br/>
&gt; studenst<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signed permission<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slips from a parent before they can check<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; books<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out from the school<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; library. Sheesh. &gt;&gt;<br/>

There are more of us in the country than there are fundamentalist Christians <br/>

to them, but whose mother has read all four of them AND the Bible and can <br/>

something, maybe *they* should be the ones to sign a non-consent form for <br/>
their children, rather than the other way around.  Why give all children <br/>
the idea that there&#39;s something wrong with the book, just because some <br/>
people think there is?  (Unless they actually *want* their kids to read it, <br/>
which is generally the effect of banning a book.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

library, so the kids would be there without their parents.  But I still say <br/>
the parents who don&#39;t want their kids reading something should be the ones <br/>
to sign forms, if any, rather than the other way around.  And I do find it <br/>
hard to understand people who would refuse to let their children read a <br/>
book based on someone else&#39;s opinion of it.  Have they no discernment of <br/>
their own?  Can they not think for themselves?<br/>

Harry Potter is #1, of course.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious where you saw Harry Potter as #1? The list at ALA had it at #7?  <br/>
<br/>
Oops, just found it, on the year 2000 list, I was looking at the lists for <br/>
the entire decade just past, which had as I expected Huckleberry Finn, among <br/>
others, beating out Harry. I wonder if Harry has the staying power to grab <br/>
the top spot long term? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The lists btw are of books most challenged, not books most banned. <br/>
