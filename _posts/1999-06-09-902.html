<div id="ygrps-yiv-384818515">Beauty is only skin deep...<br/>
<br/>
A married couple was in a terrible accident where the<br/>
woman&#39;s face was severely burned. The doctor told the husband that they couldn&#39;t<br/>
graft any skin from her body because she was too skinny. So the husband offered<br/>
to donate some of his own skin. However, the only skin on his body that the<br/>
doctor felt was suitable would have to come from his buttocks.<br/>
<br/>
The husband and wife agreed that they would tell no one<br/>
about where the skin came from, and requested that the doctor also honor their<br/>
secret.<br/>
After all,this was a very delicate matter. After the surgery<br/>
was completed, everyone was astounded at the woman&#39;s new beauty. She looked<br/>
more beautiful than she ever had before!<br/>
All her friends and relatives just went on and on about her youthful beauty!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One day, she was alone with her husband, and she was<br/>
overcome with emotion at his sacrifice. She said, &quot;Dear, I just want to thank<br/>
you for everything you did for me. There is no way I could ever repay you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My darling,&quot; he replied, &quot;Think nothing of it. I get all the thanks I<br/>
need every time I see your mother kiss you on the cheek.&quot;<br/>
