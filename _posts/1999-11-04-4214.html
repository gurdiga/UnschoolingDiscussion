<div id="ygrps-yiv-716819362">I&#39;m not really up on lizards, or any reptiles for that matter, but a<br/>
friend of mine used to give her lizard tofu.  Might be worth a try!!!!!!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361208183">We have two lizards; a leopard gecko and a green anole.  They like crickets.  Of<br/>
course not your ordinary crickets.  :-)  But the kind you get from the pet store<br/>
that don&#39;t have the hard shells.  We get them for .07/ea.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s interesting that you found a lizard.  We don&#39;t have lizards around here.<br/>
So, then again, if lizards are native to where you are, there&#39;s gotta be a natural<br/>
food source around.<br/>
