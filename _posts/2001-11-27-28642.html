<div id="ygrps-yiv-1798539991">While I think many others posted more thoughtful and kind advice about<br/>
writing......I still say you have to be careful about &quot;encouraging your<br/>
children&quot; to learn something you believe they need to be taught.  I say<br/>
examine yourself thoroughly....where is this need coming from?  Often,  I<br/>
think parents efforts at *encouraging* are a thinly veiled attempt to direct<br/>
them to what the parent thinks is necessary.  I think pushing,  even subtly,<br/>
will drive most children away from the very topics you think they &quot;need to<br/>
be taught&quot;   Why can you believe in them learning some things on their own<br/>
and in their own good time,  but not others?  Isn&#39;t it because their natural<br/>
interest and intrinsic motivation drive them to excel at what they&#39;re<br/>
interested in?  Do you think your child will never want to write?  Does it<br/>
matter to the child or to you whether &quot;creative writing&quot; is learned?<br/>

(Does creative writing include my 4 yo dd taking the box of 300 Q-tips and<br/>
forming them into a reasonable facsimie of her name dozens of time over the<br/>
whole floor?)<br/>
<br/>
Encouraging journal writing may be something you could look into. For the<br/>
younger kids, Borders has a book called Scraps & Scribbles which is a great<br/>
starting point. They offer suggestions of things to write about (past<br/>
birthday parties, vacations, favorite relatives, oneself, etc.), and the<br/>
book gives plenty of doodle space to get one going.<br/>
<br/>
A friend used a writing program***for her older children when they were<br/>
ready to go to college and yet hadn&#39;t ever written any essays or term<br/>
papers.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.writeguide.com/">http://www.writeguide.com/</a><br/>
They were very pleased with the program and the motivation it offered her<br/>
teen. You get to choose what type of writing you want to do and have a lot<br/>
of freedom of choices with their set up.<br/>
***Before it&#39;s pointed out that this is an unschooling list, I know that but<br/>
I&#39;m of the belief that unschooling can encompass books of all kinds,<br/>
instruction from others can include what would normally be considered<br/>
&quot;schoolish&quot; *if* the child was the one asking to do &quot;it&quot;. To *me*,<br/>
unschooling means that the person doing the learning is doing so of their<br/>
own free will and not being coerced into it.<br/>
