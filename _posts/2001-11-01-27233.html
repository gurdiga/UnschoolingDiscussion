<div id="ygrps-yiv-770902546">Hi Everybody!  I just wanted to take a moment to introduce<br/>
myself.<br/>
Some of you may remember me from before, but since it&#39;s<br/>
been a<br/>
good while since I was on the list I thought I should<br/>
introduce again :)<br/>
<br/>
My name is Jacli and my husband Marco and I have a 12 year<br/>
old<br/>
daughter, Larissa.  We&#39;ve been unschoolers since she was<br/>
born.<br/>
While Marco had no experience with unschooling either in<br/>
Italy <br/>
or here, I am an Army brat and have had multiple schooling<br/>
experiences.<br/>
My father was career military and traveled to wherever<br/>
whenever.  My<br/>
mother had children because she was expected to and used<br/>
whatever<br/>
schooling was nearby to alleviate her burden.  I&#39;ve<br/>
attended just about<br/>
every type of school there is.  I loved Montessori but it<br/>
wasn&#39;t til I became<br/>
very ill in High School and had to stay home for a year (in<br/>
the midst of <br/>
qualifying for early graduation) that I found out about<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
I had a tutor who believed very strongly in what I now know<br/>
was actually<br/>
unschooling.  It was absolutely the best thing that could<br/>
have happened to me.<br/>
When our daughter was born there was never any question in<br/>
my mind that<br/>
that would be best for her as well.  Marco on the other<br/>
hand, well, the jury is<br/>
still out as far as he is concerned.  We have days he is<br/>
convinced that homeschooling<br/>
is best and others when he wonders aloud why he ever let me<br/>
talk him into it.  He<br/>
is more rigidly inclined than I am and actually prefers<br/>
homeschooling - I grew up<br/>
with super rigid household and I prefer un-schooling.  But<br/>
we make it work.<br/>
<br/>
Until today he worked in New York Monday -Friday, staying<br/>
at our Manhattan apt.<br/>
and came home to our South Florida apt. on the weekends.<br/>
And until Sept. 11<br/>
we (Larissa and I) pretty much spent equal time in New<br/>
York.  Now as of today<br/>
we are full time in Florida.  <br/>
<br/>
We are pretty much loners and tend to pagan ways of<br/>
thinking.  I am a former actress<br/>
and model and am actually getting back into it.  I own an<br/>
Herbalife business and used<br/>
the products to go from a size 26 to a 10 and get off 14<br/>
daily medications so as you can<br/>
imagine I am VERY health and nutrition minded.  I also do<br/>
voice overs and Larissa has <br/>
been modeling and acting since she was a baby.  We just<br/>
moved to Florida a year ago<br/>
and we are still making adjustments.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now that I have told you way more than you could<br/>
possibly want to know<br/>
I guess that about does it.  I am very excited to be back<br/>
on the list again and looking forward<br/>
to meeting all the &quot;new&quot; people.  I am pretty outspoken but<br/>
I will always try to be considerate<br/>
to everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, Jacli</div>
