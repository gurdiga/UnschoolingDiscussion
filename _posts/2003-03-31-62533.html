Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Satish and I am from India.  Currently I am in the US near<br/>
Seattle on a project with my company.  I was reading through your Website<br/>
and found it interesting.  I have 2 children and my wife and I are home<br/>
schooling them right now.   I also work with a group in India on alternative<br/>
education.  I wanted to share my thoughts on education as I felt.  Here<br/>
goes....<br/>
<br/>
I am looking at education where the children discover, innovate and learn<br/>
about things which are existing and new. Learning is not something which we<br/>
essentially read and know it is more an experience.  There are no teachers<br/>
here and we can only be facilitators in the learning process.  Children<br/>
learn in their own way in their own speed in their own style.  We only<br/>
observe and facilitate them.  What then happens is they start discovering<br/>
themselves, their self.  They learn to be with themselves.  We also learn in<br/>
the process, learn to wonder at everything.<br/>
<br/>
Education is something which helps a child flower into a beautiful human<br/>
being.  It does not stereotype and create them into doctors, engineers,<br/>
scientists, businessmen, carpenters etc.  These are only vocations which are<br/>
external and they could become one or all of them in different times in<br/>
their life.  But essentially they remain humans rather silent powerful human<br/>
beings. <br/>
<br/>
Education is also about excellence.  Excellence for me is to do whatever you<br/>
are doing with 100% being in it.  It can be anything from eating, talking to<br/>
someone, running, walking.... to operating (doctor), carpentering etc.<br/>
Being in the present and totally in the present in whatever we are doing is<br/>
excellence.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks and Regards<br/>
<br/>
Satish<br/>

Welcome to the Unschooling.com Email Group,<br/>
<br/>
Please take a few minutes to go over the following message:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is the confidence to trust that young people will learn what<br/>
they need from living their lives in freedom and joy. An unschooling parent<br/>
is a facilitator and cheerleader who embraces life and learning with<br/>
curiosity and enthusiasm. An unschooled child is free to choose the what,<br/>
when, where and how of their learning -- from mud puddles to Shakespeare to<br/>
Spongebob Squarepants! If this sounds like it&#39;s for you or you&#39;d like to<br/>
find out more about how video games and life in general are filled with<br/>
learning, come join us!<br/>
<br/>
As discussed on this list and at the Unschooling.com website, unschooling is<br/>
*not* defined as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis. Everyone with an interest in<br/>
unschooling is welcome to join this discussion, but we ask that you keep in<br/>
mind the purpose of this list, which is to discuss unschooling in ways<br/>
designed to help each other become unschoolers or become better at<br/>
unschooling. We advise reading for a week or two before posting to get a<br/>
&quot;feel&quot; for the list and its members, since many listmembers love a lively<br/>
debate and questioning beliefs to their foundations. If you have questions<br/>
about this list please feel free to contact list moderator Joyce Fetteroll<br/>
