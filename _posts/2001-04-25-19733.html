<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668422557">Oh Pris, this is funny!  Sad, and true, but funny.<br/>
We had a similar experience last month.  We went to a pet store that has sharks to watch and sting rays that one can pet.  The kids were<br/>
soooo excited.  This place is not large, and while we were there, two school groups came in.  Loud, noisy, rowdy...and also herded like<br/>
cattle.  Of course most of the kids weren&#39;t listening anyway.  My 6 yr old son (the one that is my loudest, most rambunctious, and hardest<br/>
of hearing ;)  ) kept putting his hands over his ears!  He also kept giving me funny looks.  When we left...after two and a half hours of<br/>
being in this little store, he said Wow..it is nice to be away from those kids!  My 8 yr old said, &quot;boy, I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t have to be in<br/>
school with them all day&quot;  It was enlightening for me too.  I can&#39;t imagine how my kids would be after a day spent with that much chaos.  I<br/>
don&#39;t even want to think about it.  Later we were sitting in Applebees having lunch, and the bus went by, both boys looked at me and<br/>
smiled...the eight year old said, &quot;Mom, aren&#39;t we lucky we get to be here?&quot;  Of course I agreed!!<br/>
And about the goose....  When I was little some neighbors, and good friends, had a pond...AND a goose.  I was terrified of that thing!  It<br/>
would chase us kids, and I would jump on the tire swing to get away from it until someone bigger would save me!  Ha,  ha, ha....  Its funny<br/>
now....  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-295081203">I just have to share a childhood moment. When I was nine and my sister was eleven, my mom didn&#39;t have a car. Her boyfriend took us out to dinner for chinese food and left us there. Our house was about five miles away and we had to walk home. As we walked by one house, this particularly ferocious looking german shepard came tearing down the driveway, barking loudly. My mother was in such a foul mood, she turned and barked back at the dog. The dog shut up, paused and ran yelping back up the driveway!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53324322">We&#39;ve had many &quot;GOT IT&quot; times with our family.  My 2 favorites are the time <br/>
we were at a science center and my kids we&#39;re having a great time with a <br/>
visiting exhibit (Airplay) and a group of ps kids we&#39;re at a nearby <br/>
permanent exhibit (stand, listen, don&#39;t talk, don&#39;t touch).  The poor dears <br/>
had to listen to the teacher drone on and on while watching my kids with <br/>
wistful eyes.  The 2nd time was at another science center we were camping <br/>
near (mid September, mid week-practically had the place to ourselves).  The <br/>
boa constrictor was fed (a dead mouse) and my family watched the whole <br/>
thing.  It was s-l-o-w but exciting.  They normally feed it on Sundays, so <br/>
this was a rare thing.<br/>
Everyday is a got it day for unschoolers, not just the ones something <br/>
exciting happens or when we see ps kids out of their &quot;natural habitat&quot;.<br/>

&gt;Oh boy, when I read this I had to respond!  We went to the county museum a <br/>
&gt;few weeks ago!  I guess it was ps day!  I heard the lady at the front desk <br/>
&gt;grumbling about how they acted the last time before they came in and I <br/>
&gt;thought, &quot;Boy, how can you think that way about kids!&quot;  Well, later I <br/>
&gt;figured out why she was grumbling!  (Of course I don&#39;t blame the kids) The <br/>
&gt;kids were tearing around the museum, crawling under and over the exhibits, <br/>
&gt;screaming!  I could see the precariously balanced stuffed animals shake and <br/>
&gt;shimmy with the thundering children!  And the parents that volunteered to <br/>
&gt;come along on this field trip had no control over the kids at all!  They <br/>
&gt;were screaming at the kids to no avail!  How can anyone learn anything in <br/>
&gt;that chaos?  My kids just shook their heads and asked if we could go to a <br/>
&gt;quieter part of the museum!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Another time we went to a play put on by a local children&#39;s theatre.  Half <br/>
&gt;of the audience was full of homeschooled kids and the other half was full <br/>
&gt;of ps kids.  Boy, you could sure tell the difference!  One half of the <br/>
&gt;audience could absolutely not stay still in their seats, could not keep <br/>
&gt;their voices down, was throwing objects!  The other half was well-mannered <br/>
&gt;quiet and attentive to the play.  I&#39;ll bet you can guess which is which!<br/>
