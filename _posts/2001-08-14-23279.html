<div id="ygrps-yiv-273560197">Hi,<br/>
I have a grammar question, and I can&#39;t find my old grammar<br/>
textbooks...heee..heee...think I happily threw them away.  Is there a<br/>
place on the web??  Or, are there any English teachers on here??<br/>
What is correct?<br/>
Grandma and us had the same phone number when we moved here.<br/>
or<br/>
Grandma and we had the same phone number when we moved here.<br/>
or<br/>
should it be completely rephrased....in other words neither are<br/>
correct....<br/>
maybe<br/>
All of us shared the same phone number with Grandma when we first moved<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone???<br/>
Thanks....  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think technically this one would be correct.  You check with the <br/>
verbs.  Grandma had.  Us had.  Nope.  Doesn&#39;t work.  Grandma had.  We <br/>
had.  Yep.  Works.  But We had the same phone number as Grandma when we <br/>
moved here sounds a lot better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384575010">Same rule applies, as when you to other sentences.  John and me or John and<br/>
I.  Is it correct if you leave off &quot;Grandma and&quot;  So would &quot;us&quot; had the same<br/>
phone number be right or would &quot;we&quot; had the same phone number be correct.<br/>
(it is &quot;we&quot;)  The third choice should be &quot;We had,&quot; not &quot;all of us.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633492112">Grandma and we would be the correct form. The best way to tell with a<br/>
compound subject is take the subject not in question out and see how it<br/>
sounds to you.<br/>
...us had the same phone number?<br/>
...we had the same phone number?<br/>
