<br/>
Apologies if this is an oldie, but I&#39;ve just seen this pinned up on<br/>
the staff-room notice board at the school where I teach (the cello -<br/>
is that allowed!)  I loved it, and thought it was particularly<br/>
relevant to us on this list:<br/>
<br/>
Then Jesus took his disciples up the mountain and gathering them<br/>
around him, he taught them, saying:<br/>
<br/>
Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven<br/>
Blessed are the meek Blessed are they that mourn Blessed are the<br/>
merciful Blessed are they who thirst for justice Blessed are all the<br/>
concerned Blessed are you when persecuted Blessed are you <br/>
when you<br/>
suffer Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is great in heaven Try to<br/>
remember what I&#39;m telling you<br/>
<br/>
Then Simon Peter said<br/>
    will this count?<br/>
and Andrew said<br/>
    will we have a test on it?<br/>
and James said<br/>
    when do we have to know it for?<br/>
and Philip said    <br/>
    how many words?<br/>
and Bartholemew said<br/>
    will I have to stand up in front of the others?<br/>
and John said<br/>
    the other disciples didn&#39;t have to learn this<br/>
and Matthew said<br/>
    how many marks do we get for it?<br/>
and Judas said<br/>
    what is it worth?<br/>
and the other disciples likewise.<br/>
<br/>
Then one of the Pharisees who was present, asked to see Jesus&#39; <br/>
lesson<br/>
plan and inquired of Jesus his terminal objectives in the cognitive<br/>
domain.<br/>
<br/>
And Jesus wept.<br/>
