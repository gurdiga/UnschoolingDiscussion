<div id="ygrps-yiv-665731681">Hi to all you very wise women,<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t my problem (right now) but I am connect so I <br/>
thought I would share this with all of you in hopes you could <br/>
enlighten me with some inspiring words. <br/>
 <br/>
My husband called his ex-wifes house to talk to the children. His ex-<br/>
wife was at the her the end of her ropes with the children (both <br/>
boys 15 and 11) who are doing horribly in school. She was looking <br/>
for my husband to rescue her and like I said many times before to <br/>
both of them is all I can do is offer to keep the boys with me to <br/>
homeschool (unschool)them with my 7 year old son. Of course they are <br/>
still trying to grasp the whole concept of homeschool so I don&#39;t <br/>
scare them with the word unschool as of yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course my husband would want nothing more than to have them here <br/>
but his ex-wife is dead against it (right now anyway). She wouldn&#39;t <br/>
get all that lovely $$ support (another story - another list). As <br/>
for me I know they could benifit just from being out of the school <br/>
system and it would be a BIG ADJUSTMENT but I am sure it would be a <br/>
learning exsperoence for all. I would be willing to take on the <br/>
challange though. <br/>
<br/>
We have gone through this before this many tmes and life just goes <br/>
on and on.  This time she said to my husband that she wants all four <br/>
of us to get together and talk. I say to my husband I whole <br/>
different philosophy on school and education why the hell would you <br/>
want to get together and talk with me or why would I want to talk <br/>
with you ??? <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was wondering if you had any suggestions. I thought all I <br/>
can do is offer my life style and what I believe in and they can do <br/>
what they want with it.  Does anyone have any complicated blended <br/>
family stories to share about unschooling ?? Does anyone unschool <br/>
their stepchildren at all ?? I thought if she is desparate she might <br/>
take me up on the offer.  I know she would never dream of doing it <br/>
herself.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you ,<br/>
Sonya</div>

<br/>
Possibly she&#39;s dreaming that you could take over responsibility for the <br/>
boys but still follow her philosophy?<br/>
<br/>
My mom pushed me at age 15 to go live with my dad and his brand new wife <br/>
because my brother (13) and I were making her crazy and she was <br/>
exhausted from 6 years as a single parent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just been talking to my dad about this time (30 years ago) recently <br/>
and he feels it was very hard on his marriage.<br/>
<br/>
We were all public schooled, so the comparison breaks down at this <br/>
point.  Good luck!<br/>

keep in mind here the issue is how to help the boys, not forcing anyone&#39;s <br/>

out, oh, well, you tried.  That&#39;s just my opinion.<br/>

But if she loses both their social security checks and her mother of a <br/>
dependent child check (IF that&#39;s the financial consideration) that&#39;s over $1800 a <br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
What I did when I took custody of my brother and my mom wouldn&#39;t have been <br/>
able to live without her check was I took half the money and she kept half.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can do that with the ex.  Let her keep half or more, and if she <br/>
squawks at what you&#39;re doing, point out that she&#39;s needing to be quiet because <br/>
any government attention and she&#39;ll lose that money.<br/>

&gt; ############################################################<br/>
&gt; Thanks Carol and Betsy,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For your replies I appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she is waiting for another offer to come her way.<br/>
She has dreamed that before - that I would take them and put them in <br/>
our town&#39;s school.  My husband has exspressed that he wants nothing <br/>
more to come home to their smiling faces everyday after <br/>
homeschooling them he would like to see both happen !!  However, I <br/>
do realize that because of the dynamics it would be the BIGGEST <br/>
challange I have ever taken on. I thought it was funny how you <br/>
picked up on the &quot;enimies&quot; thing.  I guess she is reaching out and <br/>
perhaps she is willing to try ANYTHING as crazy as it may seem. <br/>
Perhaps,when I pick up the children I will open the topic and invite <br/>
her to talk with me when the children are not around. <br/>
The oldest that is 15 is at a very critical age in his life and I <br/>
feel this is where we can loose him. He has been wanting to live <br/>
with us since he was 6 and quite frankly I always wanted him but I <br/>
am tired of this yo yo thing. At least the children have not been <br/>
tossed back and fourth but still I feel it is just as hard.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, bottom line I will only take them if she is willing to let <br/>
them live under our prefrence of lifestyle.  What I&#39;m wondering is <br/>
how can I offer it gently without letting her feel like a bad <br/>
mother.  Ultimately I think she would love to send them but doesn&#39;t <br/>
for fear of &quot;how she looks as a mother&quot; or feeling as if she failed <br/>
in some way. Or perhaps she might be afraid that if she sends them <br/>
to me they may be worse &quot;because&quot; I do homeschool. I have no idea <br/>
what she thinkss but as you all know most people do not APPROVE of <br/>
the concept at all.  So I would like to ease her mind in some way <br/>
that it could be very benificial for them without making her feel <br/>
bad.  She is constanly comparing herself to me with the children and <br/>
I want to aviod that here - I don&#39;t want it to be a contest.  I <br/>
truly want whats best for the children. I know it is about the boys <br/>
but I&#39;m sure there is a ton of emotions that goes on when you turn <br/>
your children over to someone else and I would like to help her feel <br/>
better about that so she could focus more on her boys.<br/>
<br/>
what could I do to offer her or to make her feel better about <br/>
homeschooling ?? What could I do to help her be at peace with <br/>
whatever decsion she makes.  Ultimately it is about the boys but <br/>
that is one of their BIGGEST problems it has always been about her.  <br/>
The children were never put first they were always caught up in that <br/>
nasty divorce thing :( So I feel the only way that I can help them <br/>
is to sort of help her first if that makes any sense ?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394337608">Hi Sonya.  Would your step-son&#39;s mother agree to go to an unschooling <br/>
outing with you and a group of unschoolers.  I don&#39;t know if you get <br/>
along with her well enough that you could stand to spend a whole day <br/>
with her, but maybe if she saw others who are living their life the <br/>
same way you are she would soften up to the idea.  Also, she could <br/>
get a perspective of homeschooling from someone she isn&#39;t in <br/>
competition with.<br/>

This may sound unfair or dishonest, but something that she might respond <br/>

That is something all together different. Our situation is child <br/>
support paid from ex-husband for the dependant children mandated <br/>
from the state and conrolled by them.  We pay state and state pays <br/>
her.  Nothings easy :)<br/>
