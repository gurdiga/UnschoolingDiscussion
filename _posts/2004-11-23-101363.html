Has anyone played both?  Any feedback?  Thanks!<br/>

She and her friend have been letting the tigers out of the cages on purpose.  Those poor zoo guests...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We love Zoo Tycoon! (My son, also 9, likes to let out the lions!)   <br/>
We borrowed the Expanded version from our library -- I think it&#39;s <br/>
called the &quot;Complete Collection&quot; with Dinosaur and Marine Mania <br/>
expansion packs.  You can let the dinosaurs out to eat the visitors <br/>
in the expanded version. There are some competing opinions at Amazon -<br/>
- and from people who have played both, so it&#39;s a pretty good <br/>
resource.  If the links below don&#39;t work, just go to Amazon.com and <br/>
type in &quot;Zoo Tycoon.&quot;  You&#39;ll get the links to these pages.<br/>
