 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but...   wait...<br/>
<br/>
The whole culture is made of school and school support and subject matter and <br/>
expectation and pressure.    BUT, still, the whole wide WORLD, with all its <br/>
STUFF and places and things can be experienced by unschoolers in a school-free <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
It is strangely possible to learn from the whole wide world without <br/>
participating in its pervasive school aspects.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little like polarized glass--where you change the angle a little and <br/>
it all looks CLEAR!!   Tilt it back and it all looks dark.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a big world and school does not own it.<br/>
<br/>
And the big world is not just right now, as is.   It&#39;s all its history, all <br/>
its future, all its imaginings and myths and fantasies and alternate endings.   <br/>
School presents a little package of one version of history, a little package <br/>
of one summary of science, etc., and leaves all else out.<br/>
<br/>
It is very common for people to see school as the center of life, the <br/>
universe and everything.   That&#39;s the way the world looks when one sees it mostly in <br/>
textbook photos, or through whatever classroom windows haven&#39;t been papered <br/>
over or painted out, and from the windows of a schoolbus on the way home to <br/>
finish homework before going to sleep early because it&#39;s a schoolnight.   That <br/>
world is limited and limiting.<br/>

Thanks!  I know I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed as my kids are involved in<br/>
many activities recently that revolve around a school day and the<br/>
school year, it was easier when they were younger.  It&#39;s just a new<br/>
adaption to make, an angle to change &lt;bg&gt; And the activities are<br/>
really fun, a new form of joy is worth the scheduling angst!  <br/>
