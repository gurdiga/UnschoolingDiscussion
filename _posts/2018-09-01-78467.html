I might need help paying better attention to this group!!  Sorry I didn’t approve that post sooner.<br/>
<br/>
Others might have great ideas.  In the past I’ve told some stories about boogers, and Marty, when he was little, and maybe by looking in the archives for boogers, zoo, or monkey, previous topics could be found and linked here, perhaps, maybe.   I’ll be gone all day tomorrow, so I hope others will brilliantly provide tons of angles, tricks and tools.<br/>

I look for role models who make lightness look easy. Peter Gray&#39;s article on the value of teasing is really helpful for me to deconstruct the concept and figure out how to do it more often myself. <br><br>I especially like Gray&#39;s take on teasing as a way of letting others know they&#39;re accepted. People who know they&#39;re accepted are more likely to change their behavior than someone fighting to be seen and heard. I&#39;m picturing a laughing mom using a knuckle to over-the-top pretend to pick her nose, and a bunch of laughing kids watching her joyfully.&nbsp;<br><br>We spend a lot of time learning how damaging things like teasing and shame can be. But there are actually very healthy capacities of both.&nbsp;<br><br>I&#39;m linking the Peter Gray article here. For someone who feels nervous about teasing, googling &quot;teasing vs bullying&quot; could also be helpful. To be clear, Gray is not an unschooler but he does study and write about us often.&nbsp;<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201301/the-educative-value-teasing-0">https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/freedom-learn/201301/the-educative-value-teasing-0</a><br><br>~Tara Joe Farrell&nbsp;</div>

<br/>
People DO things while they’re listening.  They smoke cigarettes, or drink beer.  Some peel their nail polish, or bite their nails.  Lots doodle, or fold paper.<br/>
<br/>
Little kids don’t have access to all that yet. :-)<br/>
He’s probably doing something that helps him listen, helps him concentrate.<br/>
<br/>
You could, perhaps, try to ignore it.  He’ll grow out of it.  Make sure he has a tissue or handkerchief, and then try to ignore it.<br/>
Or you coud find something else for him to play with.  Silly putty, a fidget spinner, a lego figure, a little 3-D puzzle.<br/>
