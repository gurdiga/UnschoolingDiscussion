<div id="ygrps-yiv-682940597">Hi Folks,<br/>
<br/>
My 6 3/4 son is going with his grandparents and two other boy cousins to<br/>
South Dakota for a week.  She&#39;s like them to bring on their hand held<br/>
electronic games.  Does anyone have any suggestions for some good<br/>
ones?   I&#39;d actually rather have him look at a book or the scenery but,<br/>
hey he&#39;s going on a free trip with my in-laws.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Sherry</div>
