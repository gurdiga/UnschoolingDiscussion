 I was just diagnosed with asthma (all 3 of my kids have it too) and my <br/>
doctor immediatly started talking about me using an inhaled steroid <br/>
(something my kids have never had to do). Do any of you know of any more <br/>
natural alternatives?<br/>

Hi-- my oldest son had some asthma after having his tonsils and adenoids <br/>
removed.  He went on a nebulizer for about 6-8 weeks, and then things settled <br/>
down.  He needed a steroid , but it was for very temporary measures.  Did the <br/>
doc indicate how long the steroids were to be used?  I don&#39;t personally know <br/>
of an alternative, but I bet there is one.  If not, I would bet the steroid <br/>
would be used for a very short period of time.  Good luck.  ~Karen</div>

HSOs: Beyond Probiotics<br/>
<br/>
A Natural Way to Boost Your Immune System by Herb Rubin, D. C.<br/>
     A disturbing question I¹m often asked as a health professional is, &quot;I<br/>
try to eat right, I take supplements, but I just don¹t feel healthy. What<br/>
can I do?&quot; We are seeing a dramatic rise in degenerative, chronic and<br/>
autoimmune diseases, even in children. Diseases that were once unusual,<br/>
such as chronic fatigue, severe allergies, asthma, fibromyalgia, diabetes,<br/>
candidiasis, severe digestive disorders and environmental/chemical<br/>
sensitivities are becoming common. More people complain of getting<br/>
recurring colds, flu and infections. Each generation seems weaker than the<br/>
last. With all the nutritional supplements and advances in traditional<br/>
medicine, why is this happening?<br/>
....<br/>
       Generally, intestinal toxemia manifests as one or more of the<br/>
following: fatigue, nervousness, gastrointestinal upset, impaired<br/>
nutrition, skin problems, circulatory problems, headaches, arthritis,<br/>
sciatica and low back pain, allergy, asthma, eye, ear, nose and throat<br/>
disease, heart irregularities, appendicitis, diverticulitis, irritable<br/>
bowel syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn¹s disease, diabetes, psoriasis,<br/>
high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and pathological changes<br/>
in the breasts. All of these have responded to therapy directed at a<br/>
toxemic state in the&#39; intestine.<br/>
