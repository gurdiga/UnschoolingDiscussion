&gt; Feels like I have broken glass in my throat<br/>
&gt; every time I swallow.  I don&#39;t want to go to the doc<br/>
&gt; and shell out a bunch of money, so am hoping that this<br/>
&gt; is something I can kick on my own.  Any ideas folks?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Slippery Elm Bark - I get it in tea and drink it by the gallon. It feels<br/>
wonderful going down and leaves your throat feeling much better, it&#39;s<br/>
miraculous stuff!<br/>
