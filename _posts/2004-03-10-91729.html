&lt;&lt; For those of you who knew about my weight loss surgery back in November; I <br/>
am finally better now. I developed a horrible abscess on my liver where the <br/>
surgeon retracted it to get to my stomach. It took almost two weeks for <br/>
anyone <br/>
to catch it and by then the infection had spread so bad that my lungs <br/>
couldn&#39;t <br/>
work and my blood oxygen levels were sating at barely 80%. My heart was <br/>
working so hard that I had a small heart attack. But I am finally better now <br/>
and <br/>
have lost over 80 pounds in the past few months! AND Darin and I are <br/>
*thinking* <br/>
about maybe another baby in the next year or so, we are just worried about <br/>
the <br/>
age gap between a baby and Moly and Jack.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you survived!!<br/>
<br/>
I hope the kids weren&#39;t too afraid and that you were still able to be with <br/>
them.  VERY scary story.<br/>
<br/>
Holly still seems not to have fully recovered from the two months I was laid <br/>
up with a broken leg.   She missed having me be able to tuck her in (or even <br/>
see her room, for two months, because I couldn&#39;t get up the stairs, and she had <br/>
moved in there not long before that).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, when people are committed to attachment parenting or unschooling <br/>
and then become unable to move through the house and take kids places the way <br/>
they would like to be able to do.<br/>
<br/>
Glad you&#39;re back, Nancy.  I missed your writings!<br/>
