<div id="ygrps-yiv-21534452">My kids have always known they were adopted.  I made each of them a little<br/>
book with pictures of us waiting for them, their birth families, etc. and<br/>
the story of them coming to our home.  I read it to them from when they were<br/>
babies.  We have an open relationship with their birth families and try to<br/>
visit.  Some of the families have been more involved than others.  Adriane<br/>
just saw her birthmom and step-birthdad (at least thats what we call him) in<br/>
September when we were in Dallas for a stock show.  We went out to dinner<br/>
and the birthparents came out to the stock show.  Adriane spent several<br/>
hours hanging out with them while I was busy with the goats.  Adriane is<br/>
excited that her birthmom is expecting a baby in the Spring.<br/>
<br/>
It was harder when the kids were smaller.  The hurt of not being able to<br/>
raise this child was still fresh and birthfamily visits often ended in<br/>
gentle tears, not tears of regret but tears of sadness and long, deep hugs.<br/>
The kids would pick up on the sadness but not understand.  When Adriane<br/>
turned 6, she asked her birthmom to her birthday party.  Kristy came and<br/>
spent the weekend with us, camping out in Adriane&#39;s room.  The tears stopped<br/>
after that.<br/>
<br/>
Zach used to wonder why his birthfamily didn&#39;t keep him to raise, but later<br/>
had 2 boys that they did keep.  We talked a lot about differences in<br/>
circumstances and how babies can&#39;t always wait until we get it together.<br/>
<br/>
Having been adopted has never seemed like a major issue around here, it is<br/>
talked about but not dwelt upon nor avoided.  I have a memory box for each<br/>
of the kids with stuff from their birthfamilies, as well as baptisms, etc..<br/>
The kids love getting out the boxes and hearing the stories about the first<br/>
time I saw them or ways they are like their birthparents.  Because it isn&#39;t<br/>
threatening to dh or me, I think it helps to not be threatening to the kids.<br/>

sounded nuts.<br/>
Because a new child is such a big deal, we record things. Baby books, videos, <br/>
photo albums. If one was to not tell their child, I would think the <br/>
alternative would be to lie! <br/>
Why would anyone do that? and I think that if they were the type to do so <br/>
(Lie or hide tha truth) then adoption vs biology would be completely beside <br/>
the point, but honesty and integrety would be a much larger issue.<br/>

&gt; Julie<br/>
&gt; This is exactly what I think many who don&#39;t have experience with adoption <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t understand. It&#39;s not a threatening situation, nor a bad one.<br/>
