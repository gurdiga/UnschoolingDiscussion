I think you could be right, my dd ( who by the way is 12yrs old)might <br/>
just grow up to be a fashion designer - or a make up artist.  She <br/>
came out of her bedroom the other day with her face made up to look <br/>
like she had been beaten up!  It looked very realistic....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that I *do not* critisies her dress sence (apart <br/>
form wearing a big jersey on a hot day) I love her individuality.  At <br/>
least she is not a crowd follower - perhaps she will be a *leader*.<br/>

thought I was. I was just saying how even though my<br/>
mom didn&#39;t like my dress personally, she never made me<br/>
change, unless it was immodest. (which it sometimes<br/>
was).<br/>
I could tell you spoke of her ensembles with an<br/>
affectionate tone. :)<br/>

Good point!<br/>
<br/>
I have a child who has been since the age of six a good counselor.  He can <br/>
make peace between other kids, and between kids and their parents.   Now that <br/>
he&#39;s a teen, he ends up sometimes late at night on phone or e-mail counseling <br/>
people through relationship problems.  He&#39;s even helped a married couple he <br/>
knows, and done some suicide prevention sort of stuff.  If he was no good at <br/>
it nobody would ask him twice. Sometimes it&#39;s word of mouth, but sometimes <br/>
someone can just tell that a friend is perceptive and might help, or <br/>
sometimes something he says draws them out to discuss the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting to watch him in action.<br/>
<br/>
Other kids I know are good engineers, and can figure out how to get a frisbee <br/>
out of a high tree, or how to open something that&#39;s resistent, etc., without <br/>
making a mess or hurting anything or anybody.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-684556547">I never thought of red food colouring!  My dd is olive skinned with <br/>
black hair, so not sure if it would work - but definetly alot cheaper <br/>
than hair dye.<br/>
<br/>
My son from my first marriage, was born with ginger hair, he hated <br/>
it, so when he was 14yrs old he dyed it black, didnt like it put some <br/>
thing else on and ended up with GREEN hair!!<br/>
<br/>
I am the absolute oposite to a pack rat -  I hate clutter and I  <br/>
throw things away that I wish I hadnt later!!!!<br/>
