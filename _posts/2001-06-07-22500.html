<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763971359">This is one of those situations that is so double edged.  The school <br/>
systems and even our government say they want more parent involvement <br/>
with the schools and the children.  But heaven forbid you decide that <br/>
you, as the parents, know what is best for you own children when it <br/>
comes to their education and deciding to school them at home.  As a <br/>
parent, we love our children more than a teacher ever will.  As a <br/>
parent, we know the likes and dislikes of our children; are better <br/>
able to equip them for life, teach them in a manner that is <br/>
constructive instead of destructive to their self image.  You go <br/>
girl!  Teach your son in a way that will bring you two closer <br/>
together more than just &quot;working with his teacher&quot;.<br/>

You have also repeatedly posted that you send Wyndam to your mom&#39;s for<br/>
school.  That is pretty much of the issue.  Do we really want to dredge all<br/>
of this up again?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480005316">No I didn&#39;t say I send him for school.  I said he goes for &#39;school&#39;.  <br/>
It&#39;s his choice to do this, and what they do over there is between <br/>
them but I know that my mom does what he wants because I&#39;m the one <br/>
that gets to hear about how sick and tired she is of studying trains.<br/>
<br/>
But my point in asking the question earlier was this:  We give Wyndham <br/>
what Wyndham needs.  He has as much control as he can handle right now <br/>
and we are working very hard to help him get to a place where he can <br/>
assume full control of his entire life.  For now, he gets to pick <br/>
things like what to read.  But we control certain other things that <br/>
were causing him great harm, like certain aspects of his diet and the <br/>
quantity of TV he watches.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps this is another hot button word problem.  When I say he <br/>
goes to &#39;school&#39; over there the quote marks signify that that is what <br/>
we call it, but not necessarily what it is.  I suppose we could <br/>
just call it the Alan Parsons Project instead.<br/>

<br/>
I think it helps others understand us if we use words in the way they are<br/>
probably interpretting them rather than trying to get everyone to remember<br/>
our special uses of the words.<br/>
<br/>
I can call a dog a cat and deal with the resulting confusing and keep<br/>
reminding people I use words differently than they do, or I could just use<br/>
the words they use to convey the meaning I want and call and dog a dog.<br/>

<br/>
You could, but it wouldn&#39;t be accurate.<br/>
<br/>
Words do have limits.  <br/>
<br/>
If words are treated as unimportant, thoughts can&#39;t be very clear.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, that was the reason for my post.  It never occurred to me that <br/>
school and &#39;school&#39; (in the context I was using it) would not be <br/>
considered different.  Mostly that is because many of the people I <br/>
know use the quote mark hand gesture to give connotations like that.  <br/>
Until yesterday, I truly did not recognize that word choice as a <br/>
problem.  I knew I had explained what goes on over there before so I <br/>
figured it was understood.  Sorry for the confusion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s probably helpful to realize that maybe a dozen new people join the list<br/>
each week. So if we redefine a standard everyday word and want everyone to<br/>
know that when we use that word we&#39;re using our own definition not the<br/>
standard definition, we will need to redefined it every week and remind<br/>
people of our special definition or new people (and the old people who have<br/>
forgotten or don&#39;t notice who a post is from) will assume we&#39;re using the<br/>
standard definition.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My video must be disabled. I never saw the hand guesture ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Personally I find that since all we&#39;ve got is a written medium to convey our<br/>
thoughts, the more I stick to denotations rather than connotations the less<br/>
backing up and explaining I have to do.<br/>
