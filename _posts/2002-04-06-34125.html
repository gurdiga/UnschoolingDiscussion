intending it to be one. Your hostility is baffling since I addressed the <br/>
push/pull of conforming and unschooling and the duality of them both arising <br/>
in one situation.<br/>
The concept that unschooling means learning happens all of the time means <br/>
that the very essence of Shelley&#39;s son&#39;s experience was full of learning.<br/>
My post was on point about unschooling. Joanna, I fail to see how yours, <br/>
attacking my encouragement, was on topic at all =/<br/>
Shelley, I&#39;m glad that you got a few replies as feedback to consider in your <br/>
decision with your son. Good luck =)  It sounds like he found a great thing! <br/>
All learning is great! I&#39;m not here to argue that but I won&#39;t be lumped into <br/>
a negative group of people that attack unschooling, which I did not and do <br/>
not do.<br/>

I want to apologize for my post.  I read it with a certain slant, and <br/>
in a certain mood and reacted grumpily.<br/>
If it makes you feel any better, I snapped at my dh quite a bit <br/>
yesterdy too. :-)<br/>
Sorry. <br/>
Joanna-whose having a much better day today.<br/>
