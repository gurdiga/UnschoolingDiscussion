<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926067221">Basically if we don&#39;t agree with you Lynda we should just delete our<br/>
&quot;digests&quot; because you are going to keep hammering us until we agree with<br/>
your &quot;liberal&quot; attitude about guns. (Quite a rude suggestion from you) You<br/>
are not the only one on the list with the &quot;right&quot; opinion. Do you live in a<br/>
big city in the East or West? Rural or small town attitudes are quite<br/>
different about guns as their experiences are quite different. I come from<br/>
the East but now live in a small town in the West.(Like it much better).If<br/>
people couldn&#39;t get violent and aggressive with guns they would just use<br/>
some other means. Removing guns won&#39;t remove the problem people in our<br/>
society.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32307809">Your opening statement is silly.  If you are on digest you don&#39;t have to<br/>
stop and read the posts you aren&#39;t interested in.  So excuse me if I didn&#39;t<br/>
say delete or scroll down if you are on digest and looking from some thing<br/>
to nit pick apart.<br/>
<br/>
No one asked you to agree with me, quite frankly I could care if you do or<br/>
don&#39;t!  I would guess, since you don&#39;t give a clue what you are responding<br/>
to, that it is my response to someone DICTATING to the list that they should<br/>
stop the gun thread.  My answer remains the same, if you don&#39;t like a<br/>
particular thread, then delete it!  Oops, sorry, if you are on digest,<br/>
scroll past the posts you aren&#39;t interested in.<br/>
<br/>
As to small towns in the West, well, you can&#39;t get any further west, at<br/>
least not in the 48 states, than I am and I think at around 26,000 this town<br/>
qualifies as small.  BTW, I&#39;m not a transplant, my family has lived here for<br/>
several thousand years, so I think I might have a little bit of<br/>
understanding about how folks living in the &quot;west&quot; think.  Of course, my<br/>
opinion might be somewhat shaded since my cousin was chief of police here.<br/>
Also, from the tone of your missive, sounds to me that your Eastern attitude<br/>
came with you!<br/>
<br/>
And while removing guns won&#39;t remove the people you term problems, since<br/>
most of those &quot;problems&quot; are usually of the bully/coward genre, and I<br/>
somehow can&#39;t picture driveby knivings, then I guess they just might have to<br/>
learn to deal with their anger in a more constructive way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Please calm down.  <br/>
<br/>
Your defense for all your gun arguments (many of which I was in agreement <br/>
with, so try not to take it so personally or negatively) boiled down to this:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  BTW, I&#39;m not a transplant, my family has lived here for<br/>
several thousand years, so I think I might have a little bit of<br/>
understanding about how folks living in the &quot;west&quot; think.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt that you are 100% native American of tribes all from <br/>
northern California or wherever you are,  (when I asked once before where you <br/>
lived and how old your kids were you went into a frenzy designed to loudly <br/>
not tell me, so I no longer really care) so your statement suggesting you <br/>
know &quot;how folks living in the west think&quot; is not germaine, not supportive of <br/>
the argument, and probably not substantially true.<br/>
<br/>
No websites requested.  No further information requested.  Just a request to <br/>
stay on topic, try not to get defensive, try not to be insulting or personal, <br/>
and try to be fair and honest.<br/>
