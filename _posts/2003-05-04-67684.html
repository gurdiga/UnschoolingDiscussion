<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So if you have a sofa and chair, there will be seatbelts there.  Our <br/>
&gt; motorhome<br/>
&gt; is a bit older so I don&#39;t know if newer ones have seatbelts in the dinette. <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; wish ours did.  I allow the kids to sleep in the back bedroom.  I believe <br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; seatbelt laws apply whether you are in a RV or auto, so they should be<br/>
&gt; belted in.<br/>

mattress on the floor. She was speeding and was stopped. She tried waking the <br/>
boys with no luck. The cop took one look and gave her a summons to appear in <br/>
court next month. Virginia doesn&#39;t look kindly on kids out of seat belts!<br/>

pre pay her ticket by mailing it in, just give the County a call where she <br/>
got her ticket.  Unless of course she wants to contest the ticket, that you <br/>
have to do in person.<br/>

endangerment&quot; ticket.<br/>
