&lt;&lt;  It<br/>
<br/>
seems so natural to me.  It saddens me when I listen to other people’s<br/>
<br/>
concerns for their children’s education.  They are missing out, in a big<br/>
<br/>
way, on today.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a long ramble; feel free to skip over it, or skip it altogether.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m up at 5:25.  I&#39;ve been awake for an hour.  I felt a sharp tiny pain and <br/>
woke up thinking a bug had bitten me, so did that whole sweep out with my hand, <br/>
put the lamp on and look on the floor, disturb my husband (who might not have <br/>
woken up, honestly), and decide no, it was a crumb of broken corn small <br/>
enough to come out of my cornbag (heating device for my feet:  cloth bag with corn <br/>
in, heated in the microwave).   <br/>
<br/>
Then I had a hot flash (because I&#39;m old &lt;g&gt;) and I lay there thinking about <br/>
biochemistry and sleep and emotions.  Then I started coughing and figured at <br/>
least Keith should sleep, so I&#39;m up, drinking juice.<br/>
<br/>
At unschooling.info/forum there is dicussion about the definition of <br/>
unschooling that touches on relationships.  At unschooling.com there&#39;s a discussion <br/>
about Buddhism and such principles beinggood match for unschooling.   They&#39;re s<br/>
娪⨀祩milar, but scattered out.  And what I was thinking as I decided to get up <br/>
was that not everyone can or should unschool.  And I was thinking about <br/>
stability of situations, and emotions, and families, and life.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too much thinking for this early in the morning!!<br/>
<br/>
But some of the thoughts were about the flu epidemic, and tuberculosis, and <br/>
black lung, and lack of sanitation and antibiotics in the early 20th century.   <br/>
When parents are dying through no fault of their own, maybe children could <br/>
use school as a safety net, a bit of continuity, and connections to the <br/>
community of their own, outside of their family&#39;s connections.<br/>
<br/>
When masses of people are moving from striated societies to more idealistic <br/>
situations with potential or theoretical classlessness and equality, they need <br/>
the tools to get in there.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe school, in 1910, was like the internet is today.  Maybe school, in <br/>
1920, was what made a child real.  Maybe &quot;being a fourth grader,&quot; in 1930, was <br/>
better than being another starving, neglected, abused orphan.    <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Things have changed.&quot;<br/>
Medically things have changed, but parents still die.<br/>
Financially things have changed, but parents are still unemployed sometimes, <br/>
or have financial difficulties.<br/>
Schools have changed.  They&#39;re NOT the internet.  They&#39;re not a conduit to <br/>
the best or only opportunity for learning.<br/>
<br/>
But any choice needs to involve knowing at least one alternative.  <br/>
<br/>
Not all parents can provide a rich home environment.  And even all of those <br/>
who want to.<br/>
And of those who want to can can, none of them can guarantee living until the <br/>
children are grown.    And there are those scary times for unschoolers, when <br/>
in a snapshot moment they know their kids are &quot;behind&quot; (and &quot;ahead&quot; moments <br/>
often come too, I know) and they freak about the idea that if the kids suddenly <br/>
had to go to school it might not be smooth.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve added another item to my checklist of what will help unschooling, or <br/>
potentially hamper it.    Peace or calm.    <br/>
<br/>
With some people, peace and calm are natural. <br/>
For some, it takes philosophy:  reasons to be calm, self-calming messages.<br/>
For some, it takes practice:  therapy, biofeedback, meditation, breathing <br/>
exercises.<br/>
<br/>
Some don&#39;t have peace and calm, or don&#39;t want it, or don&#39;t even believe in it.<br/>
Or they  might want it and believe in it, but their lives are buried in <br/>
stresses beyond their control.  Or they might want it and be unable to arrange to <br/>
have it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are not well equipped with self awareness enough to feel stress <br/>
and learn how to overcome it in any physical or mental way.  It picks them up <br/>
and shakes them, and they live in an overwhelmed state.    Some people enjoy <br/>
turmoil, and steep in drama.  <br/>
Some don&#39;t enjoy it but it keeps coming upon them.<br/>
<br/>
1:30  a.m. (early Saturday morning) our phone rang  three times.  I was still <br/>
up talking to Marty, and Kirby was awake.  He got it and I heard his end.  It <br/>
was something like &quot;Well just don&#39;t say anything stupid to your parents, and <br/>
be calm when the police get there.  And don&#39;t call my house at 1:30 in the <br/>
morning anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To Kirby I&#39;m sure that seemed like reasonable and sensible advice.  <br/>
<br/>
A guy he knows from gaming, who was at his halloween party, who has been over <br/>
a few times to play games and who hangs out at Active Imagination, was in a <br/>
physical fight with his stepfather and his mom had called the police.  He <br/>
wanted Kirby to come rescue him from the situation.  Kirby logically said that he <br/>
couldn&#39;t make it there before the police came, and it wouldn&#39;t be cool to take <br/>
him away anyway, if the police wouldn&#39;t like it.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if he had hurt his mom or stepdad.  No.  <br/>
Were there other kids?  Two much younger sisters.  (The guy is 15, I think.)<br/>
He said the police would probably take the stepdad, if anyone.<br/>
I said maybe the mom would like for the son to have another safe place to go.<br/>
He&#39;s not one of their favorite friends; he&#39;s irritating.  <br/>
I said I would hope that if things got crazy at our house that if Kirby or <br/>
Marty were afraid enough to call someone else at 1:30 that they would get some <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
After some quick discussion and option brainstorming, Kirby called back and <br/>
asked if he still wanted a rescue.  Yes.   He lives about seven miles away.<br/>
<br/>
Marty went too.  The police were there, talking to the parents, it was not <br/>
problem for the son to go with them.  While they were gone I made beds on two <br/>
couches in the library for him and Kirby (whose room is being rearranged for a <br/>
window replacement and he wasn&#39;t going to sleep there anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Because of my alcoholic mom and my experience with steparents on both sides <br/>
(when I was 18, but my sister was 14, 15), I sympathized.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of the fact that our family and house are NOT that way, no drunken f<br/>
ights in the middle of the night, no adults shaming and controlling kids, no <br/>
kids needing to tell adults they hate them and want to leave (or whatever all <br/>
happened there and happens all around), I also realized I didn&#39;t want to get <br/>
involved.  But this little exposure was probably good for my boys.  I did ask <br/>
Kirby to tell him it was a one-shot deal, and gave him some excuses and reasons <br/>
to offer if he needed to, that I didn&#39;t want them exposed to craziness because <br/>
of my own background, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So they got a peek at NOT calm.<br/>
And when I woke up thinking &quot;bug bite?&quot; and hot flash and then coughing, I <br/>
could have been angry or frustrated, and let the adrenaline come and make <br/>
everything worse.  I could have woken Keith up and whined and complained.  Years <br/>
ago, I might have done any or all of that.  But because I decided when I was <br/>
pregnant with Kirby that I needed to become a calm and thoughtful mom and really <br/>
concentrate on doing that, I no longer need to concentrate to do it.  Now I can <br/>
be uncomfortable and a little afraid without turning it into pain and VERY <br/>
afraid.  <br/>
<br/>
If I couldn&#39;t do that, I think unschooling would not work as well.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve scattered parts all over the table here.  Anyone want to mess with <br/>
putting any of them together or seeing what&#39;s missing from the set?<br/>

 <br/>
Just in looking at this one part of your post I have some observations to  <br/>
add.  I have not known any unschooling parents that have died, or even  <br/>
homeschooling parents.  I have known two parents that have died and have  children in <br/>
public school.  And public school did not provide that sense of  continuity or <br/>
connection or calm.  <br/>
 <br/>
What I observed was that the child would bring some of the stress of home  to <br/>
school with them.  I would think it would be impossible to NOT do that.  But <br/>
the teachers and administrators, even though they were aware of the stresses  <br/>
at home, would not try to help the child at all.  The child became the  <br/>
&quot;nuisance child&quot; at school.  Started getting sent to the principal&#39;s  office, <br/>
getting detention.  The teachers started calling home saying that  the child just <br/>
wasn&#39;t paying attention in class, something had to be done  etc.  Which adds to <br/>
the stress at home on all concerned.  <br/>
 <br/>
In the two instances that I had a chance to observe, school became  another <br/>
stressor.  Now I have to add in the disclaimer.  I do not know  the teacher&#39;s <br/>
side of things, only what the parents had told me.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, just my observations.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I agree with the idea that it can be unfeasible to come to unschooling if you are having a really stressful life.<br/>
<br/>
As to someone not *wanting* to be peaceful and calm, I think there is a really strong subconscious value in our culture that a &quot;good mom&quot; hovers and worries nearly constantly.  I believe one has to reject that idea in order to have peace with the uneven &quot;academic development&quot; that often comes with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When someone believes that worrying is the right thing to do and backs that up with directing her kids lives very closely, I think that is likely to clash quite a bit with deschooling and with typical unschooling.  (The hypothetical worried-but-still-unschooling mom that I am describing might do okay with a kid who was focused AND energetic AND postive AND bookish.  Or some other close approximation of being an unschooling poster child. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

PS  From the time he was 3 or 4, James has shown good sense in thinking before leaping.  He has really good judgement about what he can and can&#39;t do on the playground without falling, and very rarely hurts himself.  (Wrestling with dad is the exception. &lt;g&gt;)  Thus, it was easy for me to trust him from a young age.  It&#39;s understandable that a mom who&#39;s kid is drawn to danger and harm would get very vigilant and might get stuck in that role for more years than necessary.)</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people want it and would be capable of arranging to have it if <br/>
they thought it was okay to give themselves permission to do so.  <br/>
<br/>
What it took for me to get it was to give myself permission to enjoy <br/>
life and to do things the way I wanted to do them instead of living <br/>
my life pushing myself to do things just because I felt for some <br/>
reason that I &quot;should&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t start out parenting the way my instincts would have told me <br/>
to if I had listened to my instincts.  It thought it was wrong to <br/>
listen to my instincts...You know, the Bible verse that says to lean <br/>
not on your own understanding but to look to God to direct your <br/>
paths.  I had it hammered into my head for my whole life that <br/>
sometimes things will seem to be right but if they contradicted with <br/>
what you &quot;knew to be right&quot;, then to not listen to them because our <br/>
own fleshly desires are just wrong and sinful, and satan will use <br/>
them to deceive us.  So I ignored what I wanted and did what I <br/>
should, always.  I listened to Christian parenting advocates who told <br/>
you that it&#39;s important to teach your kids to listen to arbitrary <br/>
rules that don&#39;t make sense and to obey you just because, because <br/>
someday they&#39;ll think a command in the Bible doesn&#39;t make sense and <br/>
they should be trained to ignore their own deceitful hearts and <br/>
listen to God no matter what.  <br/>
<br/>
Even once I got over that and became an unschooler, it took me a long <br/>
while to realize that I could just enjoy life and parent my kids <br/>
naturally and listen to my own instincts and just love them and enjoy <br/>
them.  I did everything the way that I &quot;should&quot;, and for awhile I <br/>
thought that meant that I should do everything they ever asked me to <br/>
do the minute they asked me to do it.  If one child wanted to be up <br/>
until 3 am but didn&#39;t want to stay up without me, I&#39;d stay up with <br/>
him AND get up with another child at 7 am when he wanted me up.  And <br/>
if one child wanted a hot dog at 2 am and we didn&#39;t have hot dogs, <br/>
I&#39;d run him to 24 hour wal-mart at 2 am.  I literally turned myself <br/>
into a human doormat and become my children&#39;s servant instead of <br/>
their mom.  They would fight over what they wanted me to do with <br/>
them, and they became demanding of me.  All because I wanted to do <br/>
it &quot;right&quot;.  I took the &quot;say yes as much as possible&quot; aspect of <br/>
unschooling to the extreme, because in my mind you technically could <br/>
ignore your own needs SO much that you run yourself ragged never <br/>
saying no.  It is humanly possible to not love yourself much at all <br/>
and to do that. I didn&#39;t realize it at the time that this was still <br/>
one more layer from my former belief of &quot;do things right, not the way <br/>
you feel&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Until I realized my needs mattered too and that it really was a good <br/>
thing to love myself as much as I loved my children, THEN our home <br/>
became much more peaceful.  Because until that time the learning was <br/>
child-led and fit every definition of unschooling there could be but <br/>
it still wasn&#39;t as peaceful as it could have been because *I* wasn&#39;t <br/>
at peace in my own heart. <br/>
<br/>
The philosophy that I carried to the extreme is a philosophy that&#39;s <br/>
ubiquitous in our culture I think.  Most people don&#39;t carry it as far <br/>
as I did, but it&#39;s something that&#39;s preached not only in churches but <br/>
in schools and scouts and gov&#39;t and everywhere.  <br/>
<br/>
If everyone believed in the philosophy of enjoy life, enjoy your <br/>
children, love yourself and love your children, do what your heart <br/>
tells you to do and follow your instincts....well, I think this world <br/>
would be a much more peaceful, happy place!<br/>
<br/>
So maybe another thing to add to your checklist, Sandra, would be <br/>
that in order for unschooling to work as well as it possibly can, the <br/>
parent has to focus on emotional wholeness for herself.  It&#39;s hard to <br/>
help a child grow up emotionally whole if the parent isn&#39;t whole <br/>
herself.  I don&#39;t think it has to come first though, because in our <br/>
family, unschooling was one of the major vehicles that led the whole <br/>
family to emotional wholeness.  <br/>

<br/>
And it wasn&#39;t only religion doing that.<br/>
<br/>
I was told in school in the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s that humans had no instincts, that <br/>
everything we knew or learned came from previous generations in writing.  And <br/>
I wrote that down.  But it wasn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped that that was the tail end of some pre-psychology 17/18th century <br/>
stuff, but a younger friend who was in college in the mid 1980&#39;s said they <br/>
told him the same thing. Instincts have been extinguished in humans.<br/>
<br/>
In those days I was pregnant, and had a baby.  I was a mass of instincts. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My favorite example is people saying if your children don&#39;t obey you <br/>
instantly without considering first whether they should, that they will not obey you <br/>
when you tell them to get out off the road or off the tracks when a train is <br/>
coming.   WELL!  There&#39;s a reason to spank a child who won&#39;t get off a swing in <br/>
one second.  The train might hit him.   There are kids who come to wish a <br/>
train would hit them, they&#39;ve been told &quot;no&quot; so much.  Meanwhile, my kids who <br/>
always hear &quot;okay, if you think it&#39;s safe,&quot; or &quot;go ahead for a while more&quot; would <br/>
IMMEDIATELY jump out of anything&#39;s way if they heard a frightened &quot;NO!&quot; from me <br/>

One thing the author of Whole Child, Whole Parent wrote once was that people <br/>
often confuse the book&#39;s title.  She said something like if the parent <br/>
understands the child&#39;s self... I can&#39;t quote it.  Sorry.  It was from a summary of <br/>
the book online somewhere and I don&#39;t want to misquote.  But it was basically <br/>
that if you see the child as a Seeing Being, you know you are and always were <br/>
one too.  or something. &lt;g&gt;  Sorry.  I thought I knew where I was going with <br/>
that, but it fizzled out.<br/>

I can so sympathize with the family of the 15 yo boy.  We have a  stepdad <br/>

no shaming and controlling, things can go wrong with 15  yo boys.  We had a <br/>
similar occurence with an angry 15 yo, who threatened to  hit me (he was upset <br/>
over a girl and it clouded everything he said or did for  weeks).  Stepdad <br/>
stepped in, and it became a little physical tussle, no one  got hurt, but the boy <br/>
walked out of the house at midnight and walked four  miles barefoot in the <br/>
dark in a not-so-safe part of Memphis  before we found him.  <br/>
 <br/>
I would have been *thrilled* if he had had a guy like Kirby to call in  the <br/>
middle of the night.  He ended up calling home from a pay phone at a  closed <br/>
gas station, hours later.  This after I had driven the streets and  talked to <br/>
cops who gave me the number to juvenile detention whom I called in  case he&#39;d <br/>
been picked up for curfew.  <br/>
 <br/>
What a compliment to Kirby that this boy called him.  How smart he was  to <br/>
say &quot;don&#39;t say stupid things&quot; and &quot;stay calm&quot;.  It seems like the  obvious thing <br/>
to say in cold analysis, but it doesn&#39;t always come to mind when  you have an <br/>
iffy family history.  <br/>
 <br/>
I learned my lesson about getting involved in domestic things when I took  in <br/>
a woman and her children for two weeks.  Her husband was wicked, and I&#39;m  <br/>
sure she&#39;s probably still with him, and he&#39;s probably still wicked.  Now I  know <br/>
how far I can go before I get entangled.  <br/>
 <br/>
I still think I have a certain responsbility to do what I can for people  who <br/>
need help *without* damaging or hindering the life of my family in any  way.  <br/>
I think we all do.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I got something from it... .  Like if you can see it in your child, then<br/>
you can see it in yourself -- which is the part that needed seeing when you<br/>
were a child, and is the part that needs healing and the part that needs to<br/>
be brought back into your life to make it whole.  (Using &#39;you&#39; here in a<br/>
very generic way.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Between the two of us we&#39;ve vaguely clarified it. &lt;bwg&gt;  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
If we wait until WE are whole to see our children as whole, we might look <br/>
around and they&#39;re 35.  If we can manage to see it in them, we will know it&#39;s in <br/>
us too.<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s because in my own thoughts the fear and potential ensuing <br/>
craziness came up.  I was half and half between knowing how it feels to be afraid of <br/>
drunks in the middle of the night, and wanting to continue to protect the <br/>
rest of my family from knowing.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, they can&#39;t know it because they&#39;re coming from a safer place.  <br/>
Keith missed it.  His family is very quiet, and I think none of them was ever <br/>
up after midnight. &lt;bwg&gt;   Their meanness was passive and cold, not loud and <br/>
fiery.<br/>

I bet those things didn&#39;t come up for Kirby.  He probably took it  more &quot;in <br/>
the now&quot;...especially since he said don&#39;t call again at 1:30  a.m.   I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have said that under those circumstances, because I  get how serious those <br/>
kinds of phone calls can be. It sounded to me like  Kirby knew the limits of <br/>
what he was willing to do for the kid, based on his own  experience.  He offered <br/>
the advice he had.  You added  your experience, overcoming those justified <br/>
fears of craziness for the best  outcome for the kid who wasn&#39;t even yours, and <br/>
Kirby changed his  mind.  <br/>
 <br/>
I suppose what happened didn&#39;t really spill over into your lives too much,  <br/>
and the cops weren&#39;t upset that the boy was leaving his house,  and Kirby <br/>
probably went over there and was calm with the police and didn&#39;t say  anything <br/>
stupid.  The boy learned something from that.  I&#39;ll bet Kirby  did, too.  I think <br/>
at his age a little contrast in his life doesn&#39;t  hurt.  ;)<br/>

Term life insurance is so cheap to get on a stay-at-home spouse, I think  <br/>
everyone should have some.  Enough to cover at least a few years in case  the <br/>
family has to adjust to the SAH parent being gone.  It goes without  saying that <br/>

I wanted Keith to crank his up too, but he said he felt uncomfortable <br/>
thinking he was worth more dead than alive.  So I pressed for mortgage insurance so <br/>
I&#39;d never be stuck widowed with $1100 a month payments (we used to pay $300 at <br/>
the old, little house).   Yeeks!  (I don&#39;t think he bought any, but that&#39;s <br/>
okay, really.  I spooked him with too much death talk all at once, I think.)<br/>

*	------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of people today worry too much about what other people think.<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to feel like you can be your authentic self.  For me,<br/>
it means surrounding myself with people who support me and staying away from<br/>
people who don&#39;t.  It&#39;s much easier to be yourself when you don&#39;t have<br/>
people around you who want to try to change you or who criticize what you<br/>
believe.  I don&#39;t have a high need to be with other people and neither do my<br/>
kids.  That makes it easier for us in that regard because we don&#39;t feel like<br/>
we need to find a lot of people who believe in us, just a few.  Having just<br/>
a few very close friends works well for us.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It can be uncomfortable making those changes and carving people out of your<br/>
life when they don&#39;t support you, but in the long run, it makes life easier<br/>
and more peaceful.  You need to make the life that you want.  It won&#39;t just<br/>
plop down into your lap without some forethought and planning.  Think<br/>
positive.  Be proactive. You can do it! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773358693">We&#39;ve had a visitor stay with us for the last four days, a business partner<br/>
of my dh&#39;s. Dan is an &quot;intellectual&quot;, has a phd in chemistry. I was tucked<br/>
away in my office when he walked in the front door this afternoon, looked at<br/>
my 14 yo who was sitting close to the TV watching a skate video and the man<br/>
said to my son (not knowing I was within earshot), &quot;Unschooling, an<br/>
interesting experiment&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It was all I could do not to lunge at him, but what I did was breathe deep,<br/>
walk out to where he was, and say, &quot;Schooling, an interesting experiment.&quot;<br/>
He was certainly surprised, thinking he was just giving his snide remark to<br/>
a kid who was obviously wasting his life away with his parents&#39; permission.<br/>
We then engaged in a rather passionate discussion about schooling,<br/>
unschooling, learning through living, education, how it works, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Why this came up for me with your comments Laura was because a huge part of<br/>
my discomfort had to do with my reactive caring of what Dan thought. He was<br/>
the living breathing person that represented all of those living breathing<br/>
people that would judge our life choices, and he was in my house and<br/>
speaking negatively to my son! Our passionate discussion was primarily<br/>
because I SO wanted to show him the truth and get him to change his thinking<br/>
(didn&#39;t happen in the moment, but maybe in a few years?? He has no children<br/>
of his own). It reminded me of Evangelical Christians who have so<br/>
passionately wanted me to see their truth. At least by the end, Dan saw that<br/>
my son was watching a skate video that he purchased with his own money (as<br/>
opposed to &quot;spacing out&quot; in front of the TV...not that there&#39;s anything<br/>
wrong with that :0)), and that he would most likely sometime in the day try<br/>
some of the moves on the video. One of Dan&#39;s comments, &quot;It seems that a<br/>
child at some point has to realize that they have to leave mommy and daddy&#39;s<br/>
home and make it on their own&quot;. My comment, &quot;What about what we are doing<br/>
would make you think my children wouldn&#39;t figure that out? And what makes<br/>
you think I ever want my children to leave my home?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I ask myself, &quot;Why did this bother me so much? Why didn&#39;t I<br/>
handle this with as much patience and grace as I might  handle a child who<br/>
was learning something for the first time? Where was my &#39;calm&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jacki, going to bed before the answers are clear to her<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that I don&#39;t have calm because I need to<br/>
be what I think everyone  thinks I should be.  I<br/>
am glad we are having this discussion.  I need to<br/>
find out who I am and get back to that.  If I<br/>
can&#39;t be me, what will my ds end up to be.<br/>

What a dipwad.<br/>
<br/>
And what are the odds if he&#39;d walked into a home where the kid were in <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m guessing maybe because he treated your son &quot;like a kid&quot; <br/>
(disrespectfully), in the process insulting you and your husband (unintentionally), that he was <br/>
being sneaky (thinking he was unheard by you), and that it was just not the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432131647">I think it&#39;s important to be your authentic self all the time, but it&#39;s<br/>
easier when you feel supported and not ridiculed, especially if you are at<br/>
that stage when you are still trying to find out what you really<br/>
believe/think.  I don&#39;t look for friends to be exactly like me, but I do<br/>
look for friends who are open minded enough to allow for differences and not<br/>
try to pressure you to be like them or agree with them on all counts.  For<br/>
me, life is too short to surround myself with people who want to change me<br/>
or try to convince me that their thinking is the right thinking.  I don&#39;t<br/>
enjoy conflict and so life is more peaceful for me if I am around people who<br/>
can accept me for who I am.  I am not fake at all but I often keep my<br/>
thoughts and feelings to myself if I know that by sharing them I will be<br/>
opening myself up to criticism or a debate of my way of life.  I enjoy a<br/>
good debate once in a while but I don&#39;t thrive on them.<br/>

--------------------------------------<br/>
That&#39;s a good start, but hypothetically, isn&#39;t there a level of being<br/>
authentic that enables one to be authentic even in the presence of people<br/>
who don&#39;t validate oneself?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-450967067">This thread reminded me of a Christmas party the girls and I went to last<br/>
year.  The adults were all downstairs talking and the kids were all upstairs<br/>
playing.  This was an open house and I knew the hostess pretty well but<br/>
hadn&#39;t seen her for a long time. (About a year and that&#39;s a long time for a<br/>
7 and 9 yo)   I knew a couple other people there, but my kids didn&#39;t know<br/>
anyone else but the hostess&#39; kids, whom they aren&#39;t comfortable with<br/>
anyways.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My kids stayed with me downstairs.  Several people commented to *me* in<br/>
front of my girls as to why they weren&#39;t upstairs with all the other kids.<br/>
With each comment the kids drew closer to me.  It feels very uncomfortable<br/>
to them to be talked about like they weren&#39;t even there.  They aren&#39;t used<br/>
to being treated so disrespectfully.  It was odd to everyone that my kids<br/>
wanted to be with me and not with all the other kids, even though they<br/>
didn&#39;t know them well.  I tried to ignore it.  I tried to explain.  After<br/>
several more comments, I started to feel uncomfortable about it too.  It was<br/>
obvious to me that they thought my kids were different because they chose to<br/>
be with me and not the other kids.  That didn&#39;t make me want to send my kids<br/>
away from me or treat them with any less respect, but I certainly felt like<br/>
I was being criticized in a subtle way.  We stayed about a total of 30<br/>
minutes.  Long enough to be polite but not too long.  I wasn&#39;t any less<br/>
authentic.  I just didn&#39;t chose to spend more of my precious time in an<br/>
unsupportive atmosphere.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; One of Dan&#39;s comments, &quot;It seems that a<br/>
child at some point has to realize that they have to leave mommy and daddy&#39;s<br/>
home and make it on their own&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;What a dipwad.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tell me about it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And what are the odds if he&#39;d walked into a home where the kid were in<br/>
&gt;&gt;school, if one was home he would have been watching TV, or a video, or<br/>
 </span></blockquote>playing a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;game?  But he wouldn&#39;t have insulted that kid and his parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In fact, what are the odds that we would walk into HIS house any day of the<br/>
week and see HIM watching TV. He is self-employed and does what he wants<br/>
everyday. Not sure why it&#39;s supposed to be different for kids...the dipwad<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
-=-So anyway, I ask myself, &quot;Why did this bother me so much? Why didn&#39;t I<br/>
handle this with as much patience and grace as I might  handle a child who<br/>
was learning something for the first time? Where was my &#39;calm&#39;&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I&#39;m guessing maybe because he treated your son &quot;like a kid&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;(disrespectfully), in the process insulting you and your husband<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(unintentionally), that he was<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;being sneaky (thinking he was unheard by you), and that it was just not<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;best thing he could have said.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103631998">Angela - I&#39;m really enjoying reading your comments on other people and <br/>
being selective and careful about how you choose to spend your energy <br/>
and time. This is something I hadn&#39;t really learned how to do for <br/>
myself and it has cost me. I&#39;m 52 and just seeing the light in this <br/>
area!  Thanks.<br/>
