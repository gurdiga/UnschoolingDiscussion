<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What&#39;s going on in your unschooling home today? How many kids do you have?  <br/>
&gt; Have you or the kids read any good books? Gone anyplace interesting? Made <br/>
&gt; any cool crafts?  How&#39;s the unschooling life going?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s some of what we did yesterday.  I read The Story of Ping to my 4.5 yr <br/>
old dd and my 10 yr ds listened too.   Then the AC repair men came.  I opened <br/>
a drawer in the bathroom and saw a tiny gecko!  Amazing!  I calmly told the <br/>
kids to come see &lt;g&gt; (I&#39;m so proud of myself for not screaming, I guess it&#39;s <br/>
bugs that I really don&#39;t like).  <br/>
<br/>
My 13 yr ds caught it in a bug jar and we started looking in reptile books <br/>
and google.com to see what kind it was.  It was so cute - pinkish/peach and <br/>
about 1.5 inches long.  You could see some organs thru its pale skin.  And <br/>
it&#39;s suction-cup feet stuck to the cover of the jar.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the AC guys overheard us and told us his hobby was reptiles and he <br/>
used to do presentations at schools.  So he told us about the gecko being a <br/>
common household kind and that it could get to be 4 inches long (that&#39;s what <br/>
google said too).  <br/>
<br/>
Then we let it go after my 10 yr ds took some pictures of it.  <br/>
<br/>
Both boys played Nintendo and my oldest read some of CS Lewis&#39; Chronicles of <br/>
Narnia.  He likes these books and Redwall and the Left Behind adult and kid <br/>
series.  <br/>
<br/>
My dd wanted to cut her jeans to shorts and then she and her brother decided <br/>
to make puppets with the remnants.  So glueing, cutting, sewing etc.  Then we <br/>
needed to make a puppet stage.  So more cutting, taping, coloring, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I read 3 books to my dd: Blueberries For Sal (I love that one), If You Give a <br/>
Moose a Muffin, and If You Give a Pig a Pancake.  And we played dress-up with <br/>
scarves and danced around.<br/>
<br/>
Later I played chinese checkers with my 10 yr old and later with my dd.  My <br/>
dd makes up all her own rules so one piece can jump across the whole board if <br/>
you want.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
And they all watched Cyberchase.  <br/>
<br/>
It was a fun day!<br/>

instruction have not yet entirely strangled the holy curiousity of inquiry; <br/>
for this delicate little plant, aside from stimulation, stands mainly in need <br/>
of freedom.&quot;<br/>

gecko. I would have screamed first for sure!<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
