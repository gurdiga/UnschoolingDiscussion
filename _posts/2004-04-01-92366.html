<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471009231">Hi all, <br/>
<br/>
I thought I would share this cool thing.<br/>
<br/>
Gramps is quoting poetry to ds.  &quot; I know that&quot; and he runs to get his D & D book.<br/>
He begins to read Jabberwocky with Gramps. I think maybe the Jabberwocky is in the Monster Manual.   Months later, I am reading some Carroll with dd and I decide to look up vorpal in the dictionary.  It is not there.  I search on line.  Now true D & D fans may know that a vorpal sword is so sharp and awesome that it will cut of the heads of the enemy.<br/>
<br/>
One, two!  One, two!  And through and through<br/>
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!<br/>
He left it dead, and with its head<br/>
He went galumphing back.<br/>
<br/>
Fun stuff!!  Best I can figure, Carroll seems to have invented that word.  What do you think Sandra? (a.k.a. the word origin guru) <br/>

Many of the words in &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; are invented words. In fact, what <br/>
makes that poem especially delightful is that we understand the <br/>
storyline so well without knowing what many of the words mean (since <br/>
they are brand new)! Carroll uses &quot;felt sense&quot; (that intuitive sense <br/>
of what sounds and word placement do together to make meaning) so <br/>
effectively in this poem. It&#39;s a successful experiment in language <br/>
creation and acquisition through context alone.<br/>
<br/>
We love Jabberwocky and didn&#39;t know that D&D used that term!<br/>

Vorpal blades are maybe created by jellicle cats.<br/>
They&#39;re totally cromulent words.<br/>

An adjective originating in Lewis Carroll&#39;s &quot;Jabberwocky&quot; poem in &lt;i&gt;Through <br/>
the Looking Glass and What Alice Saw There&lt;/i&gt;. Due to his description of it, <br/>
most generally would agree that it deals with slashing damage severing a limb <br/>
or head; however, it can be stretched to mean any form of weapon that can <br/>
possibly kill in one blow, considering the word itself is a &quot;nonsense word&quot; <br/>
created by Carroll. Despite its popularity and history, it still eludes a normal <br/>
dictionary.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t allow my characters to have vorpal weapons; they are simply too <br/>
powerful.-=-<br/>

People submit definitions and others vote on which they like (it seems).  <br/>

It&#39;s a word from the Simpsons which Lisa used to say that &quot;embiggen&quot; was a <br/>
real word (which it is, on The Simpsons &lt;g&gt;).   CUTE the way the word is being <br/>
used in the examples given (which might be themselves totally cromulent <br/>
examples, or not...).<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Carroll uses &quot;felt sense&quot; (that intuitive sense <br/>
<br/>
of what sounds and word placement do together to make meaning) so <br/>
<br/>
effectively in this poem.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And some made up words (like &quot;embiggen&quot;) are created legitimately from parts <br/>
left lying around.  English doesn&#39;t need &quot;embiggen&quot; because we have &quot;enlarge&quot; <br/>
but if we didn&#39;t, darned if we wouldn&#39;t really NEED &quot;embiggen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With &quot;embiggen&quot; though the joke (etymologically, perhaps) is that  &quot;big&quot; <br/>
comes from Anglo Saxon, and they&#39;ve stuck it with a prefix that&#39;s commonly used <br/>
with roots from Norman French  (like &quot;embrace&quot; or &quot;embarrass&quot;) and so it&#39;s got a <br/>
touch of the lingusitic Frankenstein-word about it.   But now that I think of <br/>
it, &quot;bold&quot; is native English (by which I mean from the Germanic side of the <br/>
family of English words) and &quot;embolden&quot; has been a word for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
So embiggen is emboldened by the history of English and its cromulence is <br/>
well-earned.<br/>
<br/>
Using the little dictionary &quot;word&quot; has I looked for more &quot;em-somethinged&quot; <br/>
words.<br/>
embalm  <br/>
embank (definitely French, &quot;embankment&quot;)<br/>
embark (OOOooh.... definitely English.  &quot;Bark&quot; for boat is old, old, old.)<br/>
embattle (French: embattlements)<br/>
embed (English)<br/>
embellish (FRENCH, with its embellishments)<br/>
embezzle (French, embezzlement)<br/>
embitter (sounds German, &quot;bitter&quot; but could be French and I&#39;m not looking)<br/>
embrue and embroider, French<br/>
and now I&#39;m bored and still in the b&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
If I were in grad school, I&#39;d do that monkey-trick for many more hours and <br/>
write up something that embiggened the linguistic community but I&#39;m not, so I&#39;ll <br/>
just drop this halfbaked clue and go do something else!  Tea and cookies <br/>
sounds good.<br/>

forward to sitting down each day to discuss these words. <br/>
