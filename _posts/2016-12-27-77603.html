<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839668147">I feel like I&#39;m caught in a situation of competing and incompatible needs, and I&#39;m hoping someone with some experience can guide me. <div><br></div><div>My children are 10 1/2 and 7. They are close and very sweet together. My older son, Wallace, is so gentle and accommodating with his brother; sometimes I feel he&#39;s too much that way, willing to set aside his desires because of his brother&#39;s jealousy of his time and attention. Lately, Wallace is getting more assertive, making plans with friends that don&#39;t include Lysander or putting him off when he wants to play. It feels natural for him to do these things and I want to help Lysander, the younger, in finding his own way. </div><div><br></div><div>When I can come up with a fun alternative, everyone wins. However, that is not always happening, because Lysander has been uninterested in making his own friends or playing with me. I tell him that it&#39;s okay for Wallace to want some space. It seems like he needs help with the grief and anger of that sometimes. That&#39;s where I come up a little short. If I had to assess my greatest weakness on my parenting journey, it would probably be too much passivity at times-allowing Lysander to get his way because he was making the most disturbance; the &quot;squeaky wheel,&quot; if you will. I have come to recognize that this isn&#39;t fair to Wallace, but I need some advice on helping Lysander through that frustration. </div><div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>
