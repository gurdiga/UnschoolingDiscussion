What she describes in the post is the Sudbury Valley School idea which has<br/>
now expanded to perhaps a dozen schools around the country. It can only<br/>
happen if it private, parent-funded and parent directed. A new one will open<br/>
this fall is CT that will the second in this state. Tuition is low, freedon<br/>
of self-education is total, nurturing is paramount. Who would want more. Go<br/>
to www.sudburyschool.org for their fine books about learning and to see<br/>
about starting one in your neighborhood.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like the basic ideas behind the Sudbury model, but  the reality, in my<br/>
places, has been problematic. In all the states I know about, a private<br/>
school must be registered with the state and follow state regulations, or<br/>
else the students they enroll are considered delinquent. In California,<br/>
at least, that means that when the children show up at school, they are<br/>
required to stay for at least 4 hours, to meet state attendance<br/>
regulations.<br/>
<br/>
Also, often the flavor of these schools varies a lot depending on who the<br/>
founders are. Some are very anti-parent, some are anti-tv, few if any are<br/>
truly as democratic as they say, IME.<br/>
<br/>
What I see as the real problem, though, is the idea that children need to<br/>
go somewhere away from their families to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of setting up learning resource centers where people of<br/>
all ages are welcome.I also like Ivan Illich&#39;s ideas about creating 4<br/>
networks of educational resources:<br/>
<br/>
1.A reference service to educational objects (which ould be just about<br/>
anything).<br/>
<br/>
2. Skill exchanges, where people who are willing to serve as models or<br/>
mentors for others trying to learn a skill list their skills<br/>
<br/>
3. Peer Matching , which allows people to find others with similar<br/>
interests and skill levels<br/>
<br/>
4.Educators at-Large , who would be more like career counselors or<br/>
learning facilitators than traditional educators - they might help a<br/>
person wanting to learn a foreign language find the methods that would<br/>
work best for him,   for example.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually . . . there&#39;s a Sudbury Valley type school in North Vancouver that <br/>
is publicly funded, has been for years now.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re probably right in general that they need to be privately funded in <br/>
order to work, but it&#39;s these absolute statements that keep putting me <br/>
off.  One of the things I&#39;ve learned as I got older (number three <br/>
grandchild was born yesterday - a boy) is that there&#39;s way less black and <br/>
white than I used to think.  Most subjects have a lot of shades of gray in <br/>
between.<br/>
