<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787732941">... that we talk about  topics or ideas and not each other.  Staying on the<br/>
topic rather than an individual does keep from arguments over controversial<br/>
topics from becoming a personal flame war.  Personal flame wars serve no<br/>
purpose what-so-ever and make it hard for important discussions to take<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
  I have seen debates on spanking and parenting styles change minds. I know<br/>
people who have been deeply affected by their online discussions, but never<br/>
when they spiral down into you did/no I didn&#39;t/yes you did exchanges. So,<br/>
please let&#39;s take a collective deep breath and return to discussing the<br/>
topics at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
