<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005635926">This family has been through enough.  And they are continuing to suffer.  We <br/>
cannot know what is truly going on in their lives.  I hope we can respect <br/>
them enough not to use their tragic situation to support any particular <br/>
political agenda we may have or to amuse ourselves with endless speculation.  <br/>
Some day we may know enough to have a civil and informative discussion but, <br/>
at this time, this sort of discussion seems like a cruel invasion of their <br/>
privacy, to me.<br/>

I appreciate your use of using the delete key as I do<br/>
so often, however, to suggest that this discussion be<br/>
stopped because of &quot;cruel invasion of their privacy,<br/>
to me.&quot; is unnecessary. This list, as well as many<br/>
others, discusses current events and living on the<br/>
fringe as so many unschoolers do. IMO, it&#39;s valuable<br/>
to learn what has happened to other families so that<br/>
these errors won&#39;t be repeated. Yes, I feel horrible<br/>
for this particular family but the discussion needs to<br/>
continue. Even the woman herself mentioned the need to<br/>
inform the public of what is happening to her (taken<br/>
from one of the forwarded links).<br/>
If I found myself under the long arm of government one<br/>
day, you can bet your booties I&#39;d want all you guys<br/>
here talking it up and learning from it and suggesting<br/>
ways to &#39;fix&#39; it. I wouldn&#39;t want it swept under the<br/>
rug because it made some folks uncomfortable or<br/>
because there were two sides to the story. I&#39;d hope<br/>
that the truth would slowly but surely be revealed so<br/>
that all could learn from it.<br/>
