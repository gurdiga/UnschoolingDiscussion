<div id="ygrps-yiv-176566960">Dear members of the list.<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post to the list.  I am second generation<br/>
Japanese-Brazilian, my husband is Japanese and  we unschool our<br/>
7yo dd in Tokyo, Japan. So far<br/>
it seems to us that we are the only HS of the neighborhood. We<br/>
are lucky that we can join a weekly outing with a multicultured<br/>
hs group. Anyone can find us playing in one of the parks<br/>
surrounding Tokyo during weekdays.<br/>
<br/>
My dd and I are much darker than most of the people of our area<br/>
in a country that is the best one consumer of whitening products.<br/>
We have been enjoying  the summer of both north and south<br/>
hemisphere for the past 3 years. We have just come back fm Sao<br/>
Paulo, Brazil, where my mother and sister live.<br/>
<br/>
Dd says that  T., 6yo is her best friend. Until last year dd used<br/>
to say that T. was American. T. is blond.  Her daddy walks and<br/>
work on bear foot and finger prints when he has to &quot;sign&quot; the<br/>
receipt for my sister for his monthly salary. T&#39;s mother uses pen<br/>
when she gets her own pay-check for looking after my sister&#39;s<br/>
ranch house and garden.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, T&#39;s mother and T. walked 8 km to and from the public<br/>
pre-school.  This year they are walking to the building next<br/>
door. We spend most of our days in Brazil at my sister&#39;s ranch<br/>
that is one and half hour fm Sao Paulo city and 20 min. to the<br/>
beach. Dd wakes up and before having her break fast, runs to T,<br/>
place to see if she had already taken her breakfast.  T&#39;s mother<br/>
does not allow T. to call dd to play. Dd has to go there all the<br/>
time.  T, is also not allowed to go inside my sister house unless<br/>
invited.  These are the rules of the area. My sister tells dd<br/>
that these are the rules there.  T. and dd are friends, but T.<br/>
families and my sister are employer and employee too.  Dd knows<br/>
that each family operates within its own rules and each family<br/>
have their our requirements of manners. From having been to many<br/>
homes, dd knows that families have different table manners, eat<br/>
distinct foods and speak in languages not yet familiar to her. Dd<br/>
daughter also knows that she knows it all because her parents<br/>
like to travel, meet  people, share soul and table food and<br/>
homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
When we left Brazil, I gave T. most of the pencils, colored<br/>
pencils, crayons and white papers.  Once T&#39;s mother said that T.<br/>
did not do her homework because T. has not told her that she did<br/>
not have colored pencils. It happened last summer.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we are back to Tokyo dd is speaking Portuguese more the<br/>
way I do. Dd is not using T. and T&#39;s family Portuguese classified<br/>
by the experts as &quot;Portuguese spoken by the unlearned&quot;.  I follow<br/>
Holt&#39;s teaching and I do not correct, neither dd  Portuguese nor<br/>
her English (mostly yet passive). I am thankful to T&#39;s family for<br/>
allowing their daughter to play freely with dd fm 7 AM to 8 PM.<br/>
Thanks to them, dd began speaking Portuguese. (Last year I have<br/>
posted at unschooling.com under trilingual unschooling)<br/>
<br/>
Right now dd is playing with her friend M.  M&#39;s father is fm<br/>
Pakistan and her mother is Japanese. M.  has big dar eyes and is<br/>
hairly. On her way home fm ps, M. daily stops at our apartment<br/>
and calls dd to play with her. Dd is set next to the apartment&#39;s<br/>
window  30 min. before that call.<br/>
<br/>
Today it is rainning but on sunny days 5 to 6 children with one<br/>
or both parents that do not speak Japanese fluently gather at the<br/>
park in front of our apartment. We live in public housing for low<br/>
incomers. There is a quite large Chinese comunity here.<br/>
<br/>
This gathering is unusual.  Children here in Japan is said that<br/>
only play  with their own classmates. The ps policy is to teach<br/>
comformity and strong group spirity (&quot;wa&quot;).  But the children at<br/>
this park are fm different ages. I know all of them because dd<br/>
and I are at the park on most sunny days.  I am one of the few<br/>
adults that frequents the park. I see the group as &quot;ostracized<br/>
children of the neighborhood&quot;. I am grateful that they gather at<br/>
this park.  And I make sure that they enjoy their time here.<br/>
<br/>
I can see and hear the talks at the park fm my apartment&#39;s<br/>
window.  If I see that if bully come, I am there to impose adult<br/>
authority. By just being there.<br/>
.......<br/>
I have been unschooling for a year already but have not yet found<br/>
any hsing family that does it in Portuguese.  When people here<br/>
approach me their first question is from which country I am from.<br/>
The following question is always if I speak English. Thanks to<br/>
this hability, I do feel discriminated here.  Neither I feel that<br/>
dd does.  But my brother, 5 cousins and 3 nieces that are here in<br/>
Japan as laborer hold hurt. None of them speaks English neither<br/>
do they read and write Japanese, although they all have more than<br/>
16 years of Brazilian school  education.  250.000 Brazilians are<br/>
in Japan &quot;learning&quot;  about discrimination, a subject that most of<br/>
these Brazilians say it is over in Brazil.<br/>
<br/>
World soccer 2002 will be hosted by Korea and Japan.  Before<br/>
WWII, Japan made Koreans speak only Japanese.  So far, it seems<br/>
that soccer has brought Koreans and Japanese closer.<br/>
Discrimination / racism will be a hot subject again in the<br/>
following months; for the ones that have not been confronted by<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Joylyn for your sharing.  And thank you for reading<br/>
this far.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202564548">Welcome Noemi!<br/>
<br/>
There are so many fascinating things about the Japanese culture. And some<br/>
not wonderful things. :-( The not wonderful things are probably true of any<br/>
closed culture the way Japan was and is. Zenmama&#39;s experiences in Utah might<br/>
be very similar!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that homeschooling is very difficult in Japan. Have you found<br/>
that to be true?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1863925691">Hello Noemi, <br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed your posting.  Reading about the bullies at the <br/>
apartment playground reminded me of our stay in Kyoto.  We used to <br/>
walk down to Takashimaya via a little apartment playground.  And <br/>
once, I got to be the non-Japanese speaking, overbearing American to <br/>
a bunch of young boys.  There was a clear bully action going on <br/>
wherein some big boys took a collection of little boys Pokemon <br/>
cards.  I stepped in and gave them back to the little boys.  I had <br/>
never dealt with such direct bullying in front of an adult, before.  <br/>
It was a huge adrenalin rush.  It is good to know that there are <br/>
bodyguards scattered about the playgrounds of Tokyo, as well.<br/>
