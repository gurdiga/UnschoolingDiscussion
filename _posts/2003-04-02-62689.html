&gt; Anyway, how would you define hungry?  A little bit hungry?  Starving?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Food and eating are not just for survival.  They are also for pleasure and<br/>
&gt; for socializing.  We certainly don&#39;t have sex only we want to have a child!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one says it. I don&#39;t listen to what other people say, if I did it would be <br/>
another diet. I know when I eat for reasons other than hunger, I don&#39;t come <br/>
away pleased or satisified, but fatter. <br/>
<br/>
Define hunger? Needing food for fuel. Not for boredom, frustration, feeling <br/>
together with people, celebrating, socializing. I am not a naturally thin <br/>
person. I used to be when I was a small child and didn&#39;t have any pressure to <br/>
eat or diet for reasons other than physiological. But when I finally realized <br/>
that listening to my body&#39;s hunger mechanism was how I was designed, it made <br/>
much more sense, and resulted in weight loss. I still have a long way to go.<br/>
<br/>
Sex and food, apples and oranges. Both have their allures and their purposes, <br/>
both can be misused. I enjoy sex in an intimate, loving, committed, married <br/>
relationship. A lot of people use sex for other reasons, physical pleasure <br/>
beyond marriage. I did that once too, before marriage. I wish I only waited <br/>
for marriage.  <br/>
<br/>
I enjoy food the most as it was intended, to fuel my body. I use it for other <br/>
reasons out of habit and come away miserable, sluggish, burdened. <br/>
<br/>
You go ahead and eat for your reasons, I&#39;ll eat for mine. :0)<br/>
