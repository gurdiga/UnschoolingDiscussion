<div id="ygrps-yiv-468127256">at a yard sale!?  i love it!  and yes, this is definately the same <br/>
book.  i forgot about the beginning of the title &quot;Christina <br/>
Katerina&quot;.  i thought it was such a fun book to encourage a child&#39;s <br/>
creative imagination using something so simple as a box that everyone <br/>
else would typically perceive as just &quot;trash&quot;.  today was my visit to <br/>
the library for new books and as i was browsing the shelves, another <br/>
book jumped out at me...  &quot;Christina Katerina and the Great Bear <br/>
Train&quot; - same author.  haven&#39;t read it yet but i see she has linked <br/>
several small boxes together to make a train for her teddy bears and <br/>
goes out on a journey throughout the neighborhood.  looks cute.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-169414895">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
My son has informed me that his homeschooling curriculim is building<br/>
with cardboard boxes.  We need to move the table back against the wall<br/>
so he has more room.  We&#39;ll also need to get him tape.  We have a<br/>
section in the basement with broken down cardboard boxes. He&#39;s 7 years<br/>
old and likes to build.  Can you imagine the wide range of learning he<br/>
gains with these construction?<br/>
<br/>
Today we sewed a bag for a key.  It was a quite day with no neighbors<br/>
banging on the door to drag my son out to play.<br/>
<br/>
Blessings and Success,<br/>

cardboard boxes...but sorry, you can&#39;t have him....  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sherry, that&#39;s great stuff. Reminds me of my own living room, which <br/>
often looks like some sort of weird hobo jungle. I have a box-and-<br/>
tape construction engineer here too. He constructed a dragon out of <br/>
boxes the other day. What fun!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll pass on another great building tool he loves. A friend of mine <br/>
gave me a ton of these, since we don&#39;t drink milk. You take two half-<br/>
gallon paper milk cartons, open the top end all the way on each of <br/>
them, and put them together, putting one all the way inside of the <br/>
other one. They make great gigantic building bricks.<br/>
