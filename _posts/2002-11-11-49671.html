Supporting learning isn&#39;t the same as teaching.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t call the library and say &quot;Bring over all your books on Japan, <br/>
QUICK!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We generate information by the hour here and at www.unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
If a mom wants to unschool and is sure that will work but isn&#39;t willing to <br/>
find things and read them (and having a site called www.unschooling.com makes <br/>
it DAMNED easy to find, too), then she&#39;s not going to get what it takes to <br/>
help her kids learn things, or to see it when they are.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE books on unschooling, but this doesn&#39;t happen to be one of them.<br/>
And nobody but Amazon will deliver you those books on unschooling.  <br/>
Here&#39;s another address:<br/>

I don&#39;t think she did anything of the sort. It pays to not TRY and get <br/>
offended at every little thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418945425">**I&#39;m frustrated too.  Support self-learning you say, then right off the<br/>
bat, YOU criticize new people who join the group trying to LEARN.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry.  Do you mean me?  I wasn&#39;t talking about you.<br/>
<br/>
My comment **sometimes when brand new homeschoolers join the group** was<br/>
about my support group in real life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had people that I provided a lot of information to, turn and sniff<br/>
disdainfully, as if they were unhappy that I didn&#39;t give them a complete<br/>
and perfect prescription for their children and their situation.  <br/>
<br/>
Keeping with the cooking analogy, I can give people fruit from my tree,<br/>
I can share groceries with them and tell them my favorite places to<br/>
shop, but I am not gonna plan all their meals for the week and cook them<br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s clearer.  I know analogies are kind of an imperfect way to<br/>
express ideas, but I like them.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy <br/>
<br/>
PS  I think some people, who&#39;ve had kids in school, are used to only<br/>
making one decision &quot;what school should my child attend&quot; and they are<br/>
looking for a one decision answer regarding homeschooling.  They&#39;re<br/>
looking for what engineers call a &quot;turnkey solution&quot;.  They seem to be<br/>
very uncomfortable with choices and look like they are looking for a<br/>
path that doesn&#39;t involve making choices.  Unschooling isn&#39;t that path.<br/>
