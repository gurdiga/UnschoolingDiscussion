 </span></blockquote>Hi Karri. We have this issue also. One thing I have done (not sure if it&#39;s <br/>
available in your area) is shop online. There is a grocery store about 35 <br/>
minutes from me that will do your shopping and bring the bags out to your <br/>
car. You just make your order online and drive up to the store and give <br/>
them your credit card. This even helps *me* to resist temptation that is <br/>
all over the mainstream stores. We get our meat from a delivery service and <br/>
go to a whole food store, then other items we get with the online shopping.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do or do not. There is no try.&quot;<br/>
