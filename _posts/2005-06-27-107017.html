I&#39;m probably going to order it but am wondering whether it&#39;s going to <br/>
be one of those &quot;wow, it looked cool on tv, but...&quot; experiences. I&#39;m <br/>
not going to make a big deal of my doubts to the kids, but I don&#39;t <br/>
want to get MY hopes up, lol.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Yes! It is very cool in a tactile way and makes nice squeaky crackly noises<br/>
when squeezed, from the tiny foam bits. It also can be sculpted<br/>
3-dimensionally in a way that resembles modeling clay rather than Play Doh,<br/>
and then the pieces will slowly dry solid retaining their bright colors. The<br/>
pieces stick together in the modeling process much better than play doh or<br/>
clay - which is why it can cover stuff. I notice a picture of it being used<br/>
on shoes on the website - I would suspect that is going a bit far - I don&#39;t<br/>
recall the dried product having really enough flexibility to stay stuck and<br/>
not chip off after a while in that kind of usage. However YMMV.<br/>
<br/>
Gosh it&#39;s been ages since we had any and I am enthusing myself about getting<br/>
some more! <br/>
<br/>
Only problem - the seal on the containers has to be *very* good or the stuff<br/>
will dry out in the box or bag. Extra bagging should help with that.<br/>

That&#39;s what I was thinking--in the distant past when my older kids had  some. <br/>
 I ended up re-using the containers for something else because I  found them <br/>
with chunks of hard floam inside.<br/>
