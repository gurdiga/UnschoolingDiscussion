Oh my gosh, thank you!  I thought I was the only one with the problem.<br/>
My son is so into Legos and wanted to visit a factory.  I found out <br/>
the company is from Denmark.  So I planned this big so-called study <br/>
with Danish food, languages.  I was up till 1 am downloading all of <br/>
this junk.  I was so hoping this would branch off into Vikings.<br/>
They completely loved making the Danish recipes and hearing the <br/>
language of the net but want nothing to do with the rest.<br/>
I&#39;m reading the books on Vikings b/c my &quot;cheap&quot; side can&#39;t let any <br/>
thing go to waste, you know!<br/>
<br/>
What a learning experience for me.  And I am sure that this will <br/>
happen next week w/ something else. Just about the time I &#39;m letting <br/>
my creative juices grow I get stopped cold.<br/>

Same with me.. I woukd get excited about whatever the subject was and the <br/>
kids interest would hit the brakes!  Now I&#39;m more the resource provider.  <br/>
