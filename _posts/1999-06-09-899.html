<div id="ygrps-yiv-343281361">God&#39;s Boxes of Love<br/>
<br/>
               I have in my hands two boxes<br/>
              Which God gave me to hold<br/>
           He said, &quot;Put all your sorrows in the black,<br/>
                and all your joys in the gold.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            I heeded His words, and in the two boxes<br/>
                 Both my joys and sorrows I store<br/>
          But though the gold became heavier each day<br/>
                 The black was as light as before<br/>
<br/>
         With curiosity, I opened the black box<br/>
                      I wanted to find out why   <br/>
               And I saw, in the base of the box, a hole<br/>
                  Which my sorrows had fallen out by<br/>
<br/>
              I showed the hole to God, and mused aloud,<br/>
             &quot;I wonder where my sorrows could be.&quot;<br/>
                    He smiled a gentle smile at me.<br/>
                &quot;My child, they&#39;re all here with me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
           I asked, &quot;God, why give me the boxes,<br/>
          Why the gold, and the black with the hole?&quot;<br/>
      &quot;My child, the gold is for you to count your blessings,<br/>
            the black is for you to let go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
       We should consider all of our friends a blessing.<br/>
         Send this to a friend today just to let them know<br/>
  that you are thinking of them, and that they are a    <br/>
                   joy in your life.<br/>
