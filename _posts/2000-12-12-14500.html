<div id="ygrps-yiv-677732479">There was a very interesting article in &quot;Parade&#39;s Special Intelligence<br/>
Report&quot; by Lyric Wallwork Winik.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;David Satcher, the U.S. Surgeon General, is short on funds for stamps.  Why<br/>
should you care?  Well, he wanted to mail a letter to every U.S. household<br/>
warning of a health risk.  (The last time a Surgeon General did this, it was<br/>
C. Everett Koop, and the risk was AIDS.)<br/>
<br/>
The danger is a liver disease known as Hepatitis C (HCV).  If you received<br/>
blood for any reason--surgery, a car accident, a cesarean birth--before July<br/>
1992, when accurate blood-screening began, you could be at risk.  And you<br/>
can carry the disease for 30 years before noticing any symptoms.  Hepatitis<br/>
C can be diagnosed with blood tests, and treatment is effective in up to 40%<br/>
of cases.  Untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure and liver<br/>
cancer.  An estimated 4 million Americans are infected, including many<br/>
veterans, and 70% have no symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
To read Dr. Satcher&#39;s letter and learn more about HCV and other risk<br/>
factors, go to www.surgeongeneral.gov/topics/hepatitisc/letter.htm or call<br/>
the American Liver Foundation hotline at 1-800-465-4837.&quot;<br/>
