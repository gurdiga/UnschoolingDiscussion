<div id="ygrps-yiv-634082861">Well, this is the week. My dear, sweet husband is leaving to travel 9500 <br/>
miles away to Australia (anyone on this list from there?) and won&#39;t be <br/>
back for three whole months. &lt;sob&gt; He&#39;s finally quitting his job (which <br/>
he&#39;s never liked), after having been a steady, dependable provider for <br/>
25 years.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested he take this trip to &quot;find&quot; himself and just let the <br/>
pressure peel away. My desire for him is that he comes home refreshed <br/>
and renewed and ready to work at something he loves for a change.<br/>
<br/>
I remember years ago Eric had a job he detested downtown with a huge <br/>
marketing company.  One day I was on my way to pick him up after work <br/>
when I saw him walking down the sidewalk wearing his pants rolled up to <br/>
his knees. He was carrying his shoes and socks, his shirt and tie were <br/>
over one arm and he had a big silly grin of relief on his face &#39;cause he <br/>
had finally worked up the courage to quit. I want to see that silly grin <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
My dad died suddenly when I was 13 years old. My parents had had an <br/>
argument that morning and when Dad dropped me off at school he looked <br/>
sad and I wanted to tell him &quot;I love you&quot;.  I couldn&#39;t bring myself to <br/>
say it aloud and I never saw him again; consequently, whenever anyone in <br/>
my family goes away (even to the store!), I have the awful feeling that <br/>
I&#39;m never going to see him/her again. A lot of therapy over the years <br/>
has done nothing to change this and I&#39;ve had to really work at <br/>
gracefully letting  my family go (having a daughter with wanderlust has <br/>
been a real challenge).<br/>
<br/>
Someone please give me a GUARANTEE that Eric will get there safely, have <br/>
a safe time and come home safely.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113822388">Eric must feel extremely loved.<br/>
What a gift.<br/>
Does he know people there that he is staying with, or is he all on <br/>
his own?<br/>
Sorry there are no guarantees.<br/>
My daughter 11 is flying to FL at the end of March to stay with my <br/>
parents for over a week.  I think I am going to be physically ill <br/>
when I take her to the airport.  She&#39;s flying with 3 other cousins, <br/>
and the trip will be so much fun for her.  I just am having a very <br/>
hard time not stressing over her flying and being away.  Mostly the <br/>
flying.<br/>
I&#39;d like one of those guarantees too!!<br/>

You&#39;re about the bravest wife and mom I&#39;ve ever known.<br/>
<br/>
Kira will have given him advice on hostels and travelling alone, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell us Eric-stories.  I&#39;m guessing he&#39;ll find e-mail.  Is he going to rent a <br/>
car?  Camp?  what&#39;s his plan?  <br/>
