<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We formed a babysitting co-op in our homeschool group (and later included<br/>
friends who didn&#39;t homeschool).  This can be a great thing for kids who are<br/>
old enough to go play without mom but too young to stay home alone.  Parents<br/>
benefit because it is free and your child is being cared for by another<br/>
parent.  Children benefit because they basically are going on play dates.<br/>
<br/>
We had a point system.  Then a member introduced cards made on her computer.<br/>
Each card was worth either 30 minutes or one hour for one child.  Parents<br/>
&quot;pay&quot; with the cards, which are just getting traded back and forth between<br/>
the members.  Most moms kept the cards in their car glovebox, so they would<br/>
always be handy.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, several of us stopped bothering with the points all together<br/>
as friendships developed.  It was a great way to get started though.<br/>
