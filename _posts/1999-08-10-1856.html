<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151489896">Hey everyone,<br/>
I&#39;m really curious about unschooling and learning to read.  My 7yod does not<br/>
yet read (much...she can read a few words).  I&#39;ve read many articles saying<br/>
things like: a) just keep reading to the child and s/he will learn to read.<br/>
b) When s/he&#39;s ready,  she will read,  whether it&#39;s at age 4 or even as late<br/>
as nine or ten.<br/>
She has excelled at all the pre-reading skills and many thought she would be<br/>
reading by the time she was 5.<br/>
This is causing me some anxiety.... I want to enjoy her growth and learning,<br/>
but feel she can accomplish this.  I wonder if she needs to be challenged<br/>
with this?<br/>
Any ideas,  thoughts on this?<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1523101565">I have 4 kids, currently they are almost 17, 9.5, 7.5, and almost 6.  The<br/>
oldest was taught to read between 5-6, she gobbled it up and was reading<br/>
fluently quickly.<br/>
<br/>
The second child began learning at about 5.  He took it very slowly and<br/>
rather privately.  He would use computer programs and ask questions.  By 6<br/>
he had lost interest and only sort of played around with letters/sounds,<br/>
with no real progress. He also didn&#39;t *get* phonics.  By 8 I wanted him to<br/>
be able to read, as he wanted to play computer and video games that needed<br/>
someone to read to him.  Only this spring and summer, after he turned 9 in<br/>
January, did his reading take off.  Now you can&#39;t stop him, he&#39;s reading<br/>
everything.  All I did was provide the computer games and paper and pencils.<br/>
I also answered his questions and read to him a bit. (not a lot, just a<br/>
bit).<br/>
<br/>
My third child is doesn&#39;t even know his ABC&#39;s, couldn&#39;t care less, and has<br/>
no plans to read anytime soon. He did cry tonight because his brother<br/>
wouldn&#39;t read the directions to Pokemon Snapshot to him.  I don&#39;t see him<br/>
even trying to read until much later.  Doing is this child&#39;s middle name. He<br/>
takes things apart, he builds things.  Sometimes he tries to rebuild what he<br/>
took apart, but not often.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 4th child is another daughter and she&#39;s actively asked for lessons.  She<br/>
was sorely disappointed that one 15 minute lesson didn&#39;t solve her desire to<br/>
read fluently.  She&#39;s willing to play around with sounds and letters and<br/>
writing with me. She&#39;s absorbing things, but I have a clue as to when it<br/>
will click for her.<br/>
<br/>
The thing I would look for is frustration at not being able to read.  Is she<br/>
showing signs of wanting to read, or to be able to read fluently? Or is this<br/>
just you??<br/>
<br/>
There is a great essay in the back of one of the Colfax books, _Hard Time in<br/>
Paradise_ I think. Of Daffodils and Diesels is the name of the essay.   It<br/>
discusses the idea that when a child is reading for their information they<br/>
are NOT actively figuring things out on their own. They are trusting a book<br/>
to tell them about things.  Since your child is not reading, just what is<br/>
she doing with the time others spend reading? Aren&#39;t those things more<br/>
appropriate for her at the moment?  My 7.5 year old who builds is working<br/>
very hard on understanding his world,  his physical world. When he has a<br/>
handle on all that he wants to know there, he&#39;ll shift and move on into the<br/>
abstract world of reading.  I suspect the same is true for your child.  When<br/>
she&#39;s finished the stage she&#39;s currently in, she&#39;ll have room for other<br/>
things like reading.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe.  Everything in it&#39;s own time.  :)<br/>

     Some kids read at 4 or 5, and some read later. My now 11 yo dd didn&#39;t <br/>
read fluently until around 7 1/2 or 8. One night she told me that she would <br/>
read to me. She then picked up Little Men and proceeded.    My youngest dd (7 <br/>
1/2) isn&#39;t  a fluent reader. But she loves the process and that is what is <br/>
important. Last night she wanted to go to bed early so we would have plenty <br/>
of thime to read.<br/>
   Wait--she&#39;ll read when she is ready.<br/>

not read yet, although the 7 y/o does recognize some words, and they both <br/>
know all their letters and some sounds.  My daughters also have trouble with <br/>
phonics.  My 7 y/o had gone to kindergarten in ps, and failed.  I had said <br/>

next year to learn.  My 11 y/o son has learning disabilities, including <br/>
dyslexia.  He knew how to read, but he HATED it.  But for some reason over <br/>
this summer, he has totally gotten into reading and is never without a book <br/>
in his hand.  I swear, I didn&#39;t do anything differently!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728581249">Seconding the motion to &quot;Relax&quot;.  There is so much evidence that different<br/>
people learn things in different ways and at different rates. Your daughter will<br/>
learn to read in her own good time. We have two daughters, first one an early<br/>
reader which of course eliminated the worry for us.  And I know it easier to say<br/>
relax when your kid read at three than it is when your kid is ten and doesn&#39;t<br/>
read a word.  There are lots of kids who didn&#39;t learn to read until their teens<br/>
some become avid readers and others don&#39;t care for it much.  AnD ....I always<br/>
like to point out that there are wonderful, loving, kind, happy,  good people<br/>
who can&#39;t read a word. And there are hideously evil doing folk who are excellent<br/>
readers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-555815538">Unschooling does not mean you can&#39;t use books.  Whatever works for the child<br/>
that the child is WILLING to do still constitutes unschooling.  I&#39;d say see<br/>
if she wants to learn and how she would like to go about doing it, but give<br/>
her options.  Maybe show her different ways that you could help her with it.<br/>
<br/>
I used the book Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons with my son<br/>
when he was 3.5.  Now he reads...well it totally amazes me the things he can<br/>
read.  I didn&#39;t finish the book with him.  He told me when we were about 3/4<br/>
of the way through it that that was enough of this book.  From there on he<br/>
figured out everything for himself with me reading, reading, reading still.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92180872">Jill,  sorry it&#39;s taken me awhile to get back!  I am glad to know I&#39;m not<br/>
the &#39;only one&#39;!  I was beginning to think every hs child I met could read by<br/>
age 5!  My 7yo seems to be just where your dd is with reading.  I keep<br/>
waiting and waiting for her to suddenly &#39;take off&#39; with it.  (as some<br/>
unschoolers articles proclaim).  After reading those almost a year ago,  I<br/>
was patient for awhile and relaxed about it....I just thought by now she&#39;d<br/>
be there...it&#39;s partly pressure from the outside;  lots of neighbors think<br/>
I&#39;m doing an injustice by HSing and I can&#39;t wait to prove them wrong!!<br/>
One person constantly talks about how her son is *expected* to be reading<br/>
independently at the start of first grade.  She has also wondered aloud to<br/>
me...what will I do if I send my dd back to school and she tests *behind*<br/>
her grade level!!!  (GRRRRRR!!!!)<br/>
I believe my dd will be fine,  I admit I hope she will excel and find her<br/>
talents.<br/>
I am thankful for the supportive comments....it&#39;s just what I need now,<br/>
until I regain my confidence in my dd&#39;s going at her own pace.<br/>
Thanks,  Susan in KY<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have 4 kids, currently they are almost 17, 9.5, 7.5, and almost 6.  The<br/>
&gt;oldest was taught to read between 5-6, she gobbled it up and was reading<br/>
&gt;fluently quickly.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;The thing I would look for is frustration at not being able to read.  Is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;showing signs of wanting to read, or to be able to read fluently? Or is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;just you??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She shows signs of wanting to read...loves to write....copies words from<br/>
cereal boxes,  magazines etc.;  she looks at books every night before going<br/>
to sleep 15-20 mins.    And part is me, too,  wondering how to guide her to<br/>
put it together,  without trying to force it on her if she&#39;s not<br/>
ready/willing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of Daffodils and Diesels is the name of the essay.<br/>
Since your child is not reading, just what is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;she doing with the time others spend reading? Aren&#39;t those things more<br/>
&gt;appropriate for her at the moment?  My 7.5 year old who builds is working<br/>
&gt;very hard on understanding his world,  his physical world. When he has a<br/>
&gt;handle on all that he wants to know there, he&#39;ll shift and move on into the<br/>
&gt;abstract world of reading.  I suspect the same is true for your child.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;she&#39;s finished the stage she&#39;s currently in, she&#39;ll have room for other<br/>
&gt;things like reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Breathe.  Everything in it&#39;s own time.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you,  thank you,  thank you!!!  Your support has been very helpful!!<br/>

I really appreciate the supportive thoughts,  comments, and resource<br/>
referrals!!<br/>
I notice so much sociatal pressure in learning to read early.... I know my<br/>
dd is a bright, inquisitive person.<br/>
I am getting more grounded about the reading issue again!!<br/>
And the trusting her to lead in her exploration of the world issue!!<br/>

Our 8.5 yo dd went from reading a few words at age 7 to complete the C. S.<br/>
Lewis &quot;Narnia&quot; series a few weeks ago.  It was amazing to watch!  I started<br/>
reading Laura Ingalls Wilder&#39;s &quot;Little House&quot; books to her when she was 6.<br/>
We loved those! We found some McGuffy readers, including the primer, at a<br/>
used bookstore and she read aloud to me from these.  We had fun with this<br/>
because the vignettes were from Laura&#39;s time and these would have been the<br/>
kind of readers she used.  Early on, she would get very frustrated if I<br/>
tried to get her to sound a word out.  She wanted to point at the words she<br/>
didn&#39;t know and have me read them.  She finally patiently explained to me<br/>
that she was learning to sound out the words by watching (and hearing) me do<br/>
it.  It must have worked because before long she was reading independently.<br/>
Have fun!  Play!<br/>

 </span></blockquote> She sounds alot like my dau!!  We have read some of the Laura Ingalls<br/>
Wilder, too.  That and the American girls books,  which she loves.    We did<br/>
get &quot;Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons&quot;  and have presented it to<br/>
her.  She is cooperating with the lessons,  but we&#39;re not following<br/>
instructions exactly.  We try to go through 2 lessons/day.  We&#39;ll see...if<br/>
she gets bored,  I&#39;ll stop and let her go.<br/>
She wants us to read her every word she&#39;s not absolutely sure about,  but<br/>
has given us no feedback.  I was beginning to wonder if she was afraid i<br/>
wouldn&#39;t read to her anymore once she can read on har own.<br/>
