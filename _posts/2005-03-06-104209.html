Hey, people become &quot;members&quot; of radical unschooler groups by just being  <br/>
there.  THey don&#39;t test in or pass a certification.<br/>
 <br/>
And if people really believe math can only happen with a curriculum or  <br/>
lessons, unschoolers can try to talk them out of that belief but if the only  thing <br/>
they&#39;ll agree to is a curriculum someone might say, in exasperation, &quot;then  <br/>
use a curriculum.&quot;  Or someone who just got to that list or group might  give <br/>
advice from their still-schooling-point-of-view.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-408772627">At my house we don&#39;t really use a particular curriculum for anything.  If we happen upon a good looking math workbook or computer game, we get it.  If we start on a book, and it doesn&#39;t help, we scrap it.  It just depends on the needs of the individual child.  Monopoly is a great way to practice math.<br/>
