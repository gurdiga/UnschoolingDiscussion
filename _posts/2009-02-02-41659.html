<div id="ygrps-yiv-499246502">Ok, so I am the posting machine tonight! Everyone else is asleep and I<br/>
had a coke with my pizza during the Superbowl, so I don&#39;t think sleep<br/>
is coming for me anytime soon!<br/>
<br/>
I recently started reading a book called, &quot;Healing Our Children&quot;. It<br/>
looked interesting, and I am pregnant with our second baby so I<br/>
thought I would look at it. <br/>
<br/>
Basically it rejects the whole western diet and way of eating. It<br/>
calls for eating many things raw -- meat, milk, seafood etc. And the<br/>
list of things not to eat was mind boggling.<br/>
<br/>
I only read a bit of the book, but the whole thing seems to be based<br/>
on indigenous people&#39;s diets and the author believes that many of our<br/>
illnesses today are due to our diet. <br/>
<br/>
Well, I just couldn&#39;t read much more because I found it overwhelming.<br/>
To eat the way they describe would be very challenging in our society.<br/>
And I found it discouraging that most of the things I eat were on the<br/>
&quot;don&#39;t eat&quot; lists. <br/>
<br/>
I am posting about this here for a couple of reasons. First, I think<br/>
that some of the people on this list have really well thought through<br/>
opinions and I really respect that. I view myself as a smart person,<br/>
but I also have a habit of seeing things from every side which ends up<br/>
confusing me. Does anyone actually eat a diet similar to this one and<br/>
how does it mesh with your unschooling lifestyle?<br/>
<br/>
Part of me thinks that &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; and I feel pretty healthy<br/>
as I am! But then part of me wonders if I should explore it more --<br/>
after all, unschooling is certainly not the norm in our society and I<br/>
am very glad that I have pursued my interest in it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input once again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861977722">&quot;Does anyone actually eat a diet similar to this one and how does it mesh with your <br/>
unschooling lifestyle?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 The information you are talking about is promoted by the Weston A. Price Foundation.  We <br/>
do keep these principles in mind in our diets, and I know many other unschooling families <br/>
that do as well.  We&#39;ve actually had a small slew of minor, and a few major, complaints <br/>
clear up with this stuff, and so have many others I&#39;ve known.<br/>
<br/>
All that being said, we all make our own choices and have lots of conversation about food.  <br/>
I mesh the principles in as it makes sense, being the main cook and purchaser in the <br/>
house, and we work to find foods that satisfy and bring pleasure to our lives, like many <br/>
families on this list do.  If you are asking whether we &quot;impose&quot; this diet on our children, <br/>
the answer is no, and that would also go for the other unschooling families that I know <br/>
well enough to know that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact me off-list if you&#39;d like to discuss more, because it seems like part of <br/>
what you&#39;re asking makes sense on this list, but part of it might be more specific to the <br/>
information you&#39;ve been reading about.<br/>

Research-Based Appraisals of Alternative Diet Lore<br/>

Comparative Anatomy and Physiology Brought Up to Date: Are humans  <br/>
natural frugivores/vegetarians or omnivores/faunivores?<br/>
<br/>
The rationale for vegetarianism based on similarities with apes or  <br/>
differences with carnivores has long been a cornerstone of the  <br/>
philosophy for many adherents. However, the supporting arguments have  <br/>
changed little for over 25 years now. Given that scientific study has  <br/>
advanced tremendously during that time, an update has been long  <br/>
overdue. This extensive tour provides an in-depth look at the  <br/>
numerous and intriguing problems involved, including an examination  <br/>
of the much more rigorous analytical techniques of recent comparative  <br/>
studies. Whether or not you&#39;re pleased with what the evidence points  <br/>
to, you&#39;re sure to come away with fascinating insights into the  <br/>
complex mix of factors involved in determining the diet that the  <br/>
human species is most naturally adapted to.<br/>

Is Cooked Food Poison? Looking at the Science on Raw vs. Cooked Foods.<br/>
<br/>
The traditional answers to this question in raw foods are often  <br/>
justified either on the subjective grounds of philosophical  <br/>
naturalism, or by harking back to very old scientific studies that  <br/>
have never been replicated. On the other hand, what modern research  <br/>
is available about the effects of specific substances in raw foods or  <br/>
the biochemistry of cooking has been restricted to very narrowly  <br/>
defined studies scattered widely in the literature.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63345704">What Joanna and Joyce wrote might answer all of the original poster&#39;s  <br/>
questions, so I want to go a different direction with it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people really enjoy the feeling (and it can be kind of addictive)  <br/>
that the world is ending and only valiant sacrifice by those noble  <br/>
enough to change EVERYthing can save the human race.  There&#39;s an  <br/>
entire industry creating movies to give them the thrill of imagining  <br/>
various such scenarios.  There have always been books and stories  <br/>
about it, one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
Much of religion, superstition and magic (not sleight-of-hand and  <br/>
illusion) are based on sacrifice.  What will the practitioner offer up  <br/>
in exchange for power / life / luck?<br/>
<br/>
Some parents decide to sacrifice TV, or books with too many pictures,  <br/>
hoping they will gain for their children more imagination and a love  <br/>
of (or dependence upon) books.<br/>
Some parents decide to sacrifice playing cards and drinking beer and  <br/>
dancing, so that their children will be in a &quot;Godly&quot; environment and  <br/>
more likely to live eternally.<br/>
Some parents sacrifice sugar, hoping for health and placidness in  <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
In many cases, adopting a rule or big set of rules is a sacrifice a  <br/>
parent makes in hopes of not having to think so hard all the time.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that makes unschooling and mindful parenting work,  <br/>
it seems to me, is the CONSTANT thought and awareness that the world  <br/>
changes, people change, what&#39;s great for a three year old might not be  <br/>
great for a twelve-year-old (not just food but anything in any area),  <br/>
or it might be!!!   Either rejecting all or accepting all is still a  <br/>
rule, and not a thoughtful balance.<br/>
<br/>
If I read the links Joyce brought and decide the raw food thing is  <br/>
bogus, and if in reaction to my new judgment I start cooking even the  <br/>
things I used to eat raw, that would be goofy.<br/>
If I get carrots and wonder whether I should give them to my family  <br/>
raw or cooked, and if I think VERY much about that, it would be kind  <br/>
of a waste of thinking.   I could cut some up and offer them raw and  <br/>
cook some.  I could ask Holly (the one who likes cooked carrots most)  <br/>
whether she&#39;s in the mood for cooked carrots.  She usually is.  Or  <br/>
Keith could get down the juicer he got for working at Honeywell for  <br/>
fifteen years (it&#39;s over 20 now, but we still have the juicer) and he  <br/>
could make us carrot juice.  I wouldn&#39;t try to make any of them eat  <br/>
raw or cooked or juice-of carrots.<br/>
<br/>
  If I decide today what I will do with carrots for the rest of my  <br/>
life, that would be more like superstition than mindfulness.  If I  <br/>
imbue carrots with the ability to destroy my health or to maintain it,  <br/>
that&#39;s too much power to give a carrot!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-283506046">My family consumes raw milk and cheese.  We buy from a co-op.  An Amish farmer (we love to visit his farm!) in PA delivers in our area.  He also has grass-fed beef and milk-fed pork, among other things.  I know people who follow the Weston A. Price Foundation&#39;s cookbook Nourishing Traditions, some more strictly than others.  One who is very strict is not an unschooling mom but follows Waldorf, which we used to.  It IS overwhelming!  A great thing for me has been to go to cooking classes that a leader in our co-op has offered (many of the people in our co-op also follow Nourishing Traditions and are members of the Weston A.Price Foundation). <br/>
<br/>
We are not strict in our household.  I feel food is a social aspect of life, whether it&#39;s crap or not. :)  If you&#39;re at a party and everyone&#39;s eating pizza, it wouldn&#39;t be NT (Nourishing Traditions) to eat it because the flour wouldn&#39;t have been fresh-ground and soaked in whey and water for 24 hours to make the dough and the cheese would not have been raw to start with, blah, blah, blah.  But, to eat it would be a social thing--you&#39;d like to join in the party and enjoy a slice of pizza!!  So, we dabble in fast food, drink raw milk, eat fresh fruits and vegetables (my girls are NUTS for carrots!), and sometimes drink soda.  They&#39;re hardly ever sick.  I know drinking raw milk and eating good quality yogurt adds to the health of the gut, which is where disease and ill health starts.  This protects against the ill-effects of the crap they eat and I feel we can still partake in our social life and in society and enjoy some &#39;bad&quot; food!   They buy soda or candy with their own money and I don&#39;t bat an eye.  It&#39;s their choice!!  And if they are restricted from it while their friends enjoy, well, life just sucks for them.  So, unless it&#39;s a food allergy, I say balance is key.  And educate your kids on WHY some food is bad for you while others are nourishing!<br/>

&gt; list of things not to eat was mind boggling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rejecting the &quot;western&quot; diet is like rejecting the diet of our<br/>
ancestors, if that is where one&#39;s ancestors come from.  It&#39;s<br/>
traditionally consiste of grains, meats, and fruits and veggies, or the<br/>
4 food groups, or the newer pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
People all over the world have eaten what comes in abundance where they<br/>
live.  For hundreds of years people have eaten foods from all over the<br/>
world in addition to what comes in abundance.  The farther and faster<br/>
people have been able to travel the more diverse people have been able<br/>
to eat.<br/>
<br/>
I love how culinary ideas are different because of what comes in<br/>
abundance.  I love  how it makes living in one place different from<br/>
living in other places.  Living in the Pacific NW makes fish very<br/>
abundant, especially salmon.  If I&#39;d grown up in the SW US, I&#39;d probably<br/>
be eating a lot of beef and chiles.  It&#39;s fascinating how culinary ideas<br/>
are created and area specific and represtational of what is abundant.<br/>
<br/>
What these kinds of diets tend to ignore is the fact that indigenous<br/>
cultures have always eaten what is most locally abundant, it doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that those things are the exact best thing for each individual to<br/>
eat.  I like that I can eat an orange in the winter, even though I don&#39;t<br/>
live in CA, FL, or a place with a similar climate, Italy? maybe.<br/>
<br/>
If a diet deemed fish as much worthier than beef, I&#39;d be in a world of<br/>
hurt if I lived in the midwest.  Not that people can&#39;t eat fish in the<br/>
midwest US, it&#39;s just more likely frozen and expensive.  I&#39;ve had<br/>
friends from Germany really enjoy being in the NW US, because of the<br/>
abundance of fresh fish for sushi.<br/>
<br/>
I love how food has traveled around the world, from island to island,<br/>
from continent to continent, from city to city, and region to region. <br/>
People have been doing this for thousands of years.  Coconuts are a good<br/>
example, traveling from island to island and transplanting itself in an<br/>
area that may have never seen a coconut before.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; on indigenous people&#39;s diets and the author believes that many of our<br/>
&gt; illnesses today are due to our diet.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to see anyone prove this!  Are illnesses really from eating or<br/>
not eating food?  There have been different illnesses throughout the<br/>
history of the world.  Thousands of people died from the plague, and I&#39;m<br/>
sure that those people were eating entirely unprocessed, organically<br/>
grown foods.  People used to die from leprosy.  A lot of children never<br/>
made it to adult hood.  I think people, in general, are a lot healthier<br/>
than a thousand years ago.<br/>
<br/>
The preservation of food in some form or another has been around since<br/>
humans have, correct me if I&#39;m wrong on that.  Cheese is a form of<br/>
preservation of milk, just like dried fruit is a preservation of fresh<br/>
fruit.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather eat a fresh apple from cold storage than an apple that was<br/>
sun dried many months ago and reconstituted in water.  Refridgerators<br/>
have allowed us to eat more and more things fresh.  One could argue that<br/>
cheese powder for mac and cheese is just another way of food<br/>
preservation.  Why is this a bad thing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; &quot;don&#39;t eat&quot; lists.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is the feeling of discouragment, challenge and being overwelmed healthy?<br/>
There are so many foods that are available, who&#39;s to say what is good<br/>
and what isn&#39;t?  How narrow should we make our world?  Should we ignore<br/>
the global way in which we can accept the world of food?  Should I stop<br/>
using pepper and salt because I don&#39;t go to the ocean and process my own<br/>
salt locally, and pepper because it comes originally from anciet India? <br/>
Where does one draw the line, on what to eat or not to eat?  What about<br/>
things that we can&#39;t eat raw?  Some tubers are poisonous if eaten raw,<br/>
but are quite good for you if you cook them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297033447">&quot;john hopkins study said that everyone gets cancer cells in their body a<br/>
dozen or so times during their life. cells die if not fed. sugar & dairy<br/>
feed cells. i try & eat healthy. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If that were true, then every single person who ate sugar and dairy<br/>
would get cancer!  Cancer researchers don&#39;t even know why some people<br/>
get cancer and others don&#39;t.  Free radicals are all around us, some of<br/>
them contribute to cancers, but clearly they all don&#39;t, otherwise every<br/>
person alive would get cancer.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;limit sugar & eat lots of fruit, veg. whole grains & miso ,<br/>
seaweed...... my ? is about the dairy. is it good or bad?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess it depends on who you ask?  I don&#39;t eat whole grains, they make<br/>
me sick.  I don&#39;t eat dairy for the same reason.  My husband and<br/>
children can all eat grains of any kind and mostly prefer whole grain<br/>
things but can certainly appreciate a delicious plain bagel, the same<br/>
goes for dairy, except each individual has their own tolerances of that.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people can&#39;t drink milk, but can eat cheese.  I have a friend<br/>
that can drink raw milk, but pasteurized milk makes her sick.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is one size fits all, and that includes the way we eat.  If you<br/>
don&#39;t like meat, don&#39;t eat it.  If you love fish, eat it.  If you prefer<br/>
bananas to apples, then by all means eat bananas.   Limiting sugar isn&#39;t<br/>
going to stop your body from needing sugars.  Limiting your protein<br/>
source isn&#39;t going to stop your body from requiring protein.<br/>
<br/>
We can make our world really small with our diets, or we can make our<br/>
worlds really big and wonderful and enjoy what we enjoy and eat the<br/>
things we like and that make our bodies feel good.  Some people get sick<br/>
because they are always negative and cynical.  I think our attitude<br/>
helps us be healthy and happy, just as much as what we put into it.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Interbreeding has made quite a hodgepodge.   Genetically, some groups  <br/>
tend to process milk fine and have done so for a long, long time.   <br/>
Lapps.  Nepalese and Tibetans.  Scandinavians, Brits.  Italy?  Not so  <br/>
much.  Cheese yes.   Africa?  Not so much.   Persians and Indian drink  <br/>
yoghurt drinks.  I don&#39;t know the whole-world rundown on that, just  <br/>
some examples.<br/>
<br/>
Requiring schoolkids to drink their milk regardless of their genetic  <br/>
heritage is going to be looked back upon as a Bad Thing someday, I&#39;m  <br/>
pretty sure.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are some people saying people outgrow their need for and  <br/>
tolerance for milk.  But I think it&#39;s not ALL people.  Even within  <br/>
those cultures that even make their alcoholic beverages with milk,  <br/>
it&#39;s likely that some don&#39;t like or digest milk as well as others.<br/>

about in terms of being anomalies.   For instance, the government has been trying to <br/>
prove for 40 years that a low-fat diet is healthy, and they can&#39;t actually make well- <br/>
designed studies show it.   A good book that is pretty exhaustive with detail on the studies <br/>
is Good Calories, Bad Calories.  It&#39;s pretty surprising stuff.<br/>
<br/>
The food related illnesses have to do with Syndrome X (type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high <br/>
hypertension) and digestive disorders, and there is lots of evidence anectotally from all <br/>
around the world, and through current studies that show these diseases are pretty food <br/>
related.  I don&#39;t think anyone is talking about viral or bacterially based diseases, although <br/>
my own immune system has become remarkably stronger.  I used to catch every cold that <br/>
came my way--both before kids and after--and I don&#39;t really get sick anymore.<br/>

<br/>
The proof has been in the pudding of health for me and my family.  <br/>
<br/>
And at the same time, I think Sandra&#39;s post is well-taken.  I think we can make decisions <br/>
that don&#39;t have that doom and gloom, end of the world, fanatical energy to them that <br/>
move us in the direction of health, etc.  And I trust that my children can make their own <br/>
decisions if presented with a buffet of options.  I&#39;ve seen them do it time and again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071420421">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; And educate your kids on WHY some food is bad for you while others are <br/>
nourishing!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In all of that happy post this is the one idea that could be problematic.<br/>
<br/>
What might &quot;educate&quot; mean?<br/>
<br/>
What does &quot;nourishing&quot; mean? If Joyce&#39;s links show anything, they show that <br/>
this is an idea that has changed, continues to change, that it varies <br/>
between individuals.<br/>
<br/>
The more I read and talk to people about food and diets, the more I am <br/>
convinced that the dietary preferences of most parents, most adults in <br/>
general, are a reflection of their philosophy and values than really have <br/>
anything to do with nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is a different body type from me. I look at her and see her father&#39;s <br/>
genetics. The things that we share, like hair color and skin texture, seem <br/>
to be things that I share with her father as well. Plus she has an allergy <br/>
that I don&#39;t, and nor does he, so that came from somewhere unknown. Her <br/>
body&#39;s nutritional needs are probably always going to be different from <br/>
mine. I am not going to tell her what is nourishing to her, because I know <br/>
that she can trust her own body to give her good cues. I am not going to <br/>
tell her that some food is bad for her, because I can trust her to <br/>
experience and express how foods make her feel. The only observation that I <br/>
have for her is that she gets emotionally volatile and cranky when she is <br/>
very hungry, with little self control. And when she is hungry, what matters <br/>
is calories fast.<br/>
<br/>
We have a kind of dance around discovering what she wants to eat. She <br/>
usually resents it if I make her food without offering her choices first. <br/>
She sometimes doesn&#39;t know what she wants until she is able to envisage it. <br/>
(This is why we love buffets.) I list what we have and I can make and she <br/>
eventually makes a choice. If she can&#39;t then I make something that I will <br/>
eat if she doesn&#39;t care for it. It does take patience and energy from me, <br/>
much more than if I were defining nutritious, limiting to those  and acting <br/>
accordingly. When we go out I put a huge variety in the food bag.  I make <br/>
monkey platter type snack trays too, especially when we have visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The other day I was in the bedroom while she was playing with her friends. I <br/>
came out to find that she had cooked scrambled eggs for all of them. Her <br/>
fairly regular visitors are two girls who eat anything that is put in front <br/>
of them, regardless of how soon they just ate, and will generally finish <br/>
everything. Once one asked me if she had to finish everything on her plate <br/>
at dinner time because she was finally full and didn&#39;t like it all that much <br/>
(of course I said &quot;no&quot; very emphatically), but her sister continued to <br/>
slowly soldier on until her plate was empty. They express being hungry all <br/>
the time. It is no small matter to have them over for a visit!<br/>

&gt; My family consumes raw milk and cheese.  We buy from a co-op.  An Amish <br/>
&gt; farmer (we love to visit his farm!) in PA delivers in our area.  He also <br/>
&gt; has grass-fed beef and milk-fed pork, among other things.  I know people <br/>
&gt; who follow the Weston A. Price Foundation&#39;s cookbook Nourishing <br/>
&gt; Traditions, some more strictly than others.  One who is very strict is not <br/>
&gt; an unschooling mom but follows Waldorf, which we used to.  It IS <br/>
&gt; overwhelming!  A great thing for me has been to go to cooking classes that <br/>
&gt; a leader in our co-op has offered (many of the people in our co-op also <br/>
&gt; follow Nourishing Traditions and are members of the Weston A.Price <br/>
&gt; Foundation).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We are not strict in our household.  I feel food is a social aspect of <br/>
&gt; life, whether it&#39;s crap or not. :)  If you&#39;re at a party and everyone&#39;s <br/>
&gt; eating pizza, it wouldn&#39;t be NT (Nourishing Traditions) to eat it because <br/>
&gt; the flour wouldn&#39;t have been fresh-ground and soaked in whey and water for <br/>
&gt; 24 hours to make the dough and the cheese would not have been raw to start <br/>
&gt; with, blah, blah, blah.  But, to eat it would be a social thing--you&#39;d <br/>
&gt; like to join in the party and enjoy a slice of pizza!!  So, we dabble in <br/>
&gt; fast food, drink raw milk, eat fresh fruits and vegetables (my girls are <br/>
&gt; NUTS for carrots!), and sometimes drink soda.  They&#39;re hardly ever sick. <br/>
&gt; I know drinking raw milk and eating good quality yogurt adds to the health <br/>
&gt; of the gut, which is where disease and ill health starts.  This protects <br/>
&gt; against the ill-effects of the crap they eat and I feel we can still <br/>
&gt; partake in our social life and in society and enjoy some &#39;bad&quot; food! <br/>
&gt; They buy soda or candy with their own money and I don&#39;t bat an eye.  It&#39;s <br/>
&gt; their choice!!  And if they are restricted from it while their friends <br/>
&gt; enjoy, well, life just sucks for them.  So, unless it&#39;s a food allergy, I <br/>
&gt; say balance is key.  &gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Ok, so I am the posting machine tonight! Everyone else is asleep and I<br/>
&gt;  had a coke with my pizza during the Superbowl, so I don&#39;t think sleep<br/>
&gt;  is coming for me anytime soon!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I recently started reading a book called, &quot;Healing Our Children&quot;. It<br/>
&gt;  looked interesting, and I am pregnant with our second baby so I<br/>
&gt;  thought I would look at it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Basically it rejects the whole western diet and way of eating. It<br/>
&gt;  calls for eating many things raw -- meat, milk, seafood etc. And the<br/>
&gt;  list of things not to eat was mind boggling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I only read a bit of the book, but the whole thing seems to be based<br/>
&gt;  on indigenous people&#39;s diets and the author believes that many of our<br/>
&gt;  illnesses today are due to our diet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Well, I just couldn&#39;t read much more because I found it overwhelming.<br/>
&gt;  To eat the way they describe would be very challenging in our society.<br/>
&gt;  And I found it discouraging that most of the things I eat were on the<br/>
&gt;  &quot;don&#39;t eat&quot; lists.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I am posting about this here for a couple of reasons. First, I think<br/>
&gt;  that some of the people on this list have really well thought through<br/>
&gt;  opinions and I really respect that. I view myself as a smart person,<br/>
&gt;  but I also have a habit of seeing things from every side which ends up<br/>
&gt;  confusing me. Does anyone actually eat a diet similar to this one and<br/>
&gt;  how does it mesh with your unschooling lifestyle?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Part of me thinks that &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; and I feel pretty healthy<br/>
&gt;  as I am! But then part of me wonders if I should explore it more --<br/>
&gt;  after all, unschooling is certainly not the norm in our society and I<br/>
&gt;  am very glad that I have pursued my interest in it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Thanks for any input once again!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

People from many governments are on this list.<br/>
<br/>
For the U.S.,<br/>
The four food groups charts go back to the 50&#39;s or earlier, and the  <br/>
food pyramid from the 1980&#39;s I think.   But the stuff IN the groups  <br/>
(bread, cheese, milk, the vegetables and meats they picture) are north  <br/>

Well, then the term is a misnomer!  I&#39;m sure there are lots of folks<br/>
that eat a lot of high fat and high sugar diet, but I see more people<br/>
eat food bought in grocery stores that are used to make things.  My kids<br/>
and I analyze other peoples&#39; grocery hauls on a fairly regular basis. <br/>
So, sure people put cookies made in a factory in their haul, as well as<br/>
fruit and veggies, and breads, and meats, and chips, and a whole host of<br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
Something that&#39;s really helped me get to a place of ease about factory<br/>
processing has been shows like &quot;Unwrapped&quot; on the food network channel. <br/>
It has created convenience and cost effective eating.  There are so many<br/>
brands of factory processed food, that we can pick and choose our<br/>
ingredients when buying things.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all part of the process of the evolution of food storage.  Some of<br/>
the things that we can buy all packaged up, have been around for a long<br/>
time, and before factories, were made by hand in small batches.  Some of<br/>
these things haved changed very little minus the mass production aspect.<br/>

Perhaps more and more people are getting immuno type illnesses from<br/>
water.  The fact is, nobody really knows, there are lots of guesses and<br/>
speculation and fear about what if, but we don&#39;t really know.<br/>

leanest, most natural beef, and it would still make me sick.  I could<br/>
eat bananas all day long, but they would still make me sick.  I could<br/>
grow my own grain, harvest it myself with my own mill and make my own<br/>
bread, but it would still make me sick.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a rice paddy, so I rely on others to grow and process my<br/>
rice and it&#39;s almost always imported from somewhere else.  Rice is a<br/>
good source of calories for me, but if my ideal was to only eat what was<br/>
local, I would go hungry a lot.  People travel, food travels, culinary<br/>
ideas travel.  If we consume food because we like it and it makes us<br/>
feel good, how could that be &quot;bad&quot; calories?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>anymore.<br/>
<br/>
My own experience says that this is the best reason that we should allow<br/>
kids to eat what they feel like eating!  If I had been allowed to eat or<br/>
not eat the foods that I wanted,as a child, I could&#39;ve learned to listen<br/>
to my body better.  I wouldn&#39;t be an adult with digestive disorders.  I<br/>
hardly ever get sick now that I&#39;ve stopped eating the foods that make me<br/>
sick.  I don&#39;t eat raw, I don&#39;t follow any other diet, except the one<br/>
that allows me to eat what makes me feel good and not eat the things<br/>
that make me feel yucky.  Kids, if allowed to make free choices, do<br/>
exactly this!<br/>
<br/>
So maybe the real problem is how we treat kids and force them to eat or<br/>
not eat things, simply because, the adults in their lives seemingly know<br/>
better and force this &quot;knowledge&quot; onto their kids.</div>

i don&#39;t post often, but i feel the need to respond to this statement, having had breast cancer during pregnancy less than 2 years ago at the age of 37.<br/>
<br/>
i feel it is irresponsible to make blanket statements about cancer, such as foods &quot;feeding&quot; cancer.  although i think many people (especially people from lists like these who question the status quo) do their own research about issues they are curious about, statements such as these are not helpful in general.  they create misunderstanding and fear.<br/>
<br/>
according to my panel of oncologists i had &quot;done everything right&quot; to avoid breast cancer, ie breastfeeding, avoiding tobacco products, having children later in life, no family history, etc.<br/>
<br/>
my tumor specifically grew directly proportionate to the pregnancy.  it was affected by the hormone progesterone. it was not known to be caused by specific foods or anything else besides pregnancy (this after 3 other normal pregnancies).<br/>
<br/>
oncologists and researchers do not know exact triggers which cause cells to mutate into cancer.  they do their best to identify risk factors.  by publishing findings, they attempt to help people, and they maintain their research funding.<br/>

my doctors flat-out told me they do not know why i developed cancer.  i had NO apparent risk factors for that particular disease.  i was told that most of their body of knowledge is in regards to treatment of cancer.  the treatment techniques have come a long way since the 60&#39;s, when pregnancy termination would have been recommended, and for that i am grateful.<br/>
<br/>
no one knows when or how they may become ill, nor if they will die a sudden death tomorrow.  in our family we choose not to control diet.  far better for our family to be emotionally &quot;healthy&quot; than to live in fear of some unknown illness caused by drinking milk or eating sugar! <br/>

<br/>
Eh, my brother has celiac, I&#39;m allergic to oats, and my doctor told me<br/>
recently that I shouldn&#39;t be eating hardly any grains at all because<br/>
it&#39;s not what stone-age people ate. Or something like that. Also<br/>
according to her I&#39;m not supposed to be eating much fruit either, or<br/>
sweet vegetables or tubers because of the amount of sugar in them. I<br/>
read somewhere else that for some reason (my blood type or what-not)<br/>
that I shouldn&#39;t be eating lentils. And somewhere else that I<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be eating nuts. And of course everyone knows that soy and<br/>
dairy are horrible for you. All this is of course completely contrary<br/>
to what I grew up hearing from nutrition &quot;experts&quot;. I&#39;m not sure what<br/>
there is left to eat. It just seems like no matter how healthy you<br/>
think you&#39;re eating someone somewhere is going to have a reason for<br/>
you why it&#39;s wrong. (I once laid out my diet for someone who was<br/>
convinced I was obese because I was eating &quot;bad&quot; foods, and when she<br/>
was given a list of whole natural foods she said, &quot;Well, you know you<br/>
have to eat them in the right *order*.&quot; Oy.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve given up hoping that anyone knows what they&#39;re talking about. At<br/>
this point we are just paying attention to how what *we* eat makes<br/>
*us* feel. I&#39;ve learned more doing that than hours upon hours of<br/>

&quot;john hopkins study said that everyone gets cancer cells in their body a<br/>
dozen or so times during their life. cells die if not fed. sugar & dairy<br/>
feed cells. i try & eat healthy. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
If that were true, then every single person who ate sugar and dairy<br/>
would get cancer! Cancer researchers don&#39;t even know why some people<br/>
get cancer and others don&#39;t. Free radicals are all around us, some of<br/>
them contribute to cancers, but clearly they all don&#39;t, otherwise every<br/>
person alive would get cancer.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;limit sugar & eat lots of fruit, veg. whole grains & miso ,<br/>
seaweed...... my ? is about the dairy. is it good or bad?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I guess it depends on who you ask? I don&#39;t eat whole grains, they make<br/>
me sick. I don&#39;t eat dairy for the same reason. My husband and<br/>
children can all eat grains of any kind and mostly prefer whole grain<br/>
things but can certainly appreciate a delicious plain bagel, the same<br/>
goes for dairy, except each individual has their own tolerances of that.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people can&#39;t drink milk, but can eat cheese. I have a friend<br/>
that can drink raw milk, but pasteurized milk makes her sick.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is one size fits all, and that includes the way we eat. If you<br/>
don&#39;t like meat, don&#39;t eat it. If you love fish, eat it. If you prefer<br/>
bananas to apples, then by all means eat bananas. Limiting sugar isn&#39;t<br/>
going to stop your body from needing sugars. Limiting your protein<br/>
source isn&#39;t going to stop your body from requiring protein.<br/>
<br/>
We can make our world really small with our diets, or we can make our<br/>
worlds really big and wonderful and enjoy what we enjoy and eat the<br/>
things we like and that make our bodies feel good. Some people get sick<br/>
because they are always negative and cynical. I think our attitude<br/>
helps us be healthy and happy, just as much as what we put into it.<br/>

increasingly debatable to what degree it is normal or healthy for us to eat them.  It&#39;s not <br/>

Interbreeding has made quite a hodgepodge. Genetically, some groups <br/>
tend to process milk fine and have done so for a long, long time. <br/>
Lapps. Nepalese and Tibetans. Scandinavians, Brits. Italy? Not so <br/>
much. Cheese yes. Africa? Not so much. Persians and Indian drink <br/>
yoghurt drinks. I don&#39;t know the whole-world rundown on that, just <br/>
some examples.<br/>
<br/>
Requiring schoolkids to drink their milk regardless of their genetic <br/>
heritage is going to be looked back upon as a Bad Thing someday, I&#39;m <br/>
pretty sure.<br/>
<br/>
Then there are some people saying people outgrow their need for and <br/>
tolerance for milk. But I think it&#39;s not ALL people. Even within <br/>
those cultures that even make their alcoholic beverages with milk, <br/>
it&#39;s likely that some don&#39;t like or digest milk as well as others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-833234272">Everything has sugar in it:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/21/5/484">http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/summary/21/5/484</a>  My question is<br/>
how is it determined that insulin is made independently from the presence of<br/>
sugar?  I don&#39;t think it is.  Glucose comes from what we eat from food<br/>
breakdown.  The liver doesn&#39;t produce glucose independently but uses stored<br/>
glycogen derived from glucose in the blood which it remakes into glucose<br/>
when energy is needed.<br/>
<br/>
From the link given: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/diabetes1.htm">http://health.howstuffworks.com/diabetes1.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Your body tries to keep a constant supply of glucose for your cells by<br/>
 </span></blockquote>maintaining a constant glucose concentration in your blood -- otherwise,<br/>
your cells would have more than enough glucose right after a meal and starve<br/>
in between meals and overnight. So, when you have an oversupply of glucose,<br/>
your body stores the excess in the liver and<br/>
muscles&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/muscle.htm">http://health.howstuffworks.com/muscle.htm</a>&gt;by making<br/>
*glycogen*, long chains of glucose. When glucose is in short supply, your<br/>
body mobilizes glucose from stored glycogen and/or stimulates you to eat<br/>
food. The key is to maintain a constant blood-glucose level. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Also:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The cells take in glucose from the blood&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/blood.htm">http://health.howstuffworks.com/blood.htm</a>&gt;and break it down for energy (some cells, like brain<br/>
 </span></blockquote>cells &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain.htm">http://health.howstuffworks.com/brain.htm</a>&gt; and red blood<br/>
cells&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/blood.htm">http://health.howstuffworks.com/blood.htm</a>&gt;,<br/>
rely solely on glucose for fuel). The glucose in the blood comes from the<br/>
food &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://health.howstuffworks.com/food.htm">http://health.howstuffworks.com/food.htm</a>&gt; that you eat. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree that adult physiology may not require as much sugar as child<br/>
physiology.  Depends.  Some people need more than others.  Some people use<br/>
energy more, some less through physical activity, higher drain on energy<br/>
levels placed on the body due to fighting disease or relative health which<br/>
might not lead to more need of energy to raise immunity.  Injury increases<br/>
the need for energy, as does stress from a variety of sources.<br/>
<br/>
The need for glucose to produce energy is a balancing act, a cycle, in which<br/>
the pancreas produces both insulin and its opposing glucagon.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that the consumption of sugar is the main factor in the<br/>
development of diabetes.  Some people eat plenty of it and other people<br/>
avoid it like the plague, and still from both groups there are diabetics.<br/>
Which probably means other factors are involved.<br/>
<br/>
Experts, scientists, researchers etc don&#39;t quite understand it.  The How<br/>
Stuff Works writeup is a general rundown of what *is* known.  But that<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that there isn&#39;t more to be understood.<br/>

&gt; What does &quot;nourishing&quot; mean? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And I think another important peice of the concept of nourishing, <br/>
which has been written about already, but I wanted to readdress, is <br/>
how something makes you feel emotionally and mentally.  When denied <br/>
all kinds of food items because they aren&#39;t &quot;nourishing&quot;, a child&#39;s <br/>
desires, wants, fascinations, curiosities aren&#39;t being nourished.  <br/>
When I want a big ol&#39; bowl of haagen daaz, it isn&#39;t because my <br/>
physical body *needs* it, something else in me wants/needs it, and <br/>
when I sit down and enjoy it, it IS nourishing.  Are kids *hyper* <br/>
when they eat something that tastes really good because it has sugar <br/>
in it?  Or are they just expressing happiness and joy?  As adults <br/>
maybe we forget that feeling of something so good it makes you want <br/>
to dance ... maybe when you are 4 that is how a slurpee on a hot day <br/>
tastes?<br/>
<br/>
In light of some of the comments on diets that are given by <br/>
allergies and sensitivites, I just wanted to make note (and <br/>
celebrate) that within this community even those (sometimes extreme) <br/>
diets haven&#39;t been equated with suffering.  If the dietary needs of <br/>
someone need to exclude certain ingredients, it doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
exclude all the elements of &quot;nourishing&quot; -- the soul, the spirit.  <br/>
For example, just yesterday we had a couple of celiac kids over and <br/>
my dd and I are gluten sensitive, so we made gluten free crepes, <br/>
filled them with nutella, and topped them with whipped cream ... <br/>
mmm, can you get much more nourishing than that? :).  <br/>
<br/>
What makes me uncomfortable are the parents I have seen who use <br/>
allergies to limit many things beyond the actual allergy, as if it <br/>
gives them the free-pass on food controls.  The celiac children that <br/>
were at our home yesterday do not have their diet limited, except <br/>
for the gluten ... they, like my children, ate what they wanted and <br/>
not a bite more, it was very refreshing.  We have had other friends <br/>
whose children couldn&#39;t have gluten over and they really gorged on <br/>
the yummy gluten free treats we have laying out on our counters and <br/>
easily available -- they can&#39;t have gluten but that has been ramped <br/>
up to incude many other things &quot;just in case.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
So, I think that when you buy into something like Weston Price, it <br/>
is easy to forget about all the other nourishing traditions out <br/>
there, all the other aspects of nourishment that are so important to <br/>
children who live in the moment and don&#39;t/*shouldn&#39;t* be bogged down <br/>
with all the what-ifs surrounding that kind of dietary control, all <br/>
the *educating* can really destroy pure simple food enjoyment.<br/>

When parents come to unschooling chats and try to derail ALL talk of  <br/>

coloring, I want to reach through and magically thump them.  They&#39;ve  <br/>
sacrificed peace and freedom for nothing.  They get nothing but fear  <br/>
and irritation, and they&#39;re spreading it around.<br/>
<br/>
I watched a movie called Role Models yesterday.  There&#39;s a dinner  <br/>
table scene where the guest gets tired of the way the mom and step dad  <br/>
are speaking of and to their teenaged son, and he says something about  <br/>
it.  I don&#39;t know the quote, but it&#39;s like the mom said life&#39;s hard  <br/>
and the guest says especially with parents like you.  It was quite a  <br/>
powerful moment, and a great thing to put in a mainstream movie.  I  <br/>
hope it makes a lot of not-yet-parents people my kids&#39; ages be more  <br/>

not like they are.<br/>

punish a disobedient child, he shames, humiliates, name calls, and<br/>
punishes in extreme fashion.  The girl is desperate.  She called me for<br/>
advice.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few things she can do to empower herself, but she&#39;s scared<br/>
and probably won&#39;t.  In our conversation, I asked her if she was happy<br/>
with her situation, knowing the answer already.  I asked her if she had<br/>
relayed her unhappiness to her dad and she said this, &quot;He doesn&#39;t care<br/>
about my happiness, when I told him how unhappy I was, he laughed and<br/>
told me it was my problem, not his.&quot;  It was stunning to hear her say it<br/>
even though I knew it was the case.<br/>
<br/>
I told her that it absolutely was his problem, his responsibility to<br/>
provide for his children, not just food and clothes, but emotional<br/>
health as well.  I told her that parents have a great power to make<br/>
their children&#39;s lives miserable or happy and that I considered it to be<br/>
one of the biggest responsibilities of being a parent.  I also reminded<br/>
her that her mom really does care about her happiness.<br/>
<br/>
If there is one thing that makes unschooling work well, it&#39;s happiness. <br/>
If one of my kids is unhappy, it&#39;s my cue to ramp it up, make life<br/>
easier, better, calmer.  I know without a doubt that kids who are happy<br/>
learn more and better, they are open and receptive.  Kids who are<br/>
unhappy, close themselves to the world.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-576319347">My mom just sent David a book called The 10,000 Year Explosion by Gregory Cochran and Henry Harpending. I really like Henry Harpending&#39;s work. They&#39;ve got a website up for the book: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://the10000yearexplosion.com/">http://the10000yearexplosion.com/</a> (ooh, I got Rick Rolled off the site, hee, hee)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, the book is based on the idea that not only did humans not stop evolving 10,000 years ago, or 50,000 as some people posit, but that through civilization we&#39;ve accelerated change through evolution. They use dogs as an example of rapid evolution. Dogs have been domesticated for roughly the same time as humans have been farming. The traits that they carry as dogs are derived from the genetic traits that a wolf has, but adapted in ways that are appropriate for their environment. So, a border-collie&#39;s hyper herding instinct is derived from wolf game-herding patterns, but is exaggerated as it was the herding that made the dog best suited to the environment of a shephard&#39;s dog. They also point out that some wolf traits have disappeared either entirely in dogs, like regurgitating food for their puppies, or having male parental care, or traits that have disappeared in most breeds of dogs, like digging birthing dens or having a specific time of year when<br/>
 they go into season. The point of the comparison is to say:  &quot;[a]ny adaptation, whether physical or behavioral, that loses its utility in a new environment can be lost rapidly, especially if it has any noticeable cost. Fish in lightless cave lose their sight over a few thousand years at most--much more rapidly than it took for eyes to evolve in the first place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So that sets the stage for the idea that the Inuit are less adapted to a farmed diet, whereas those of us who have not recently come from a hunter-gatherer or a horticulturalists society are much more adapted to these diets. They write: &quot;There is every reason to think that early farmers developed serious health problems from this low-protein, vitamin-short, high-carbohydrate diet. Infant mortality increased, and the poor diet was likely one of the causes. You can see the mismatch between the genes and the environment in the skeletal evidence. Humans who adopted agriculture shrank: Average height dropped by almost five inches.&quot; They continue with &quot;There are numerous signs of pathology in the bones of early agriculturalists. In the Americas, the introduction of maize led to widespread tooth decay and anemia due to iron deficiency, since maize is low in bioavailable iron. This story is not new: Many researchers have written about the health problems<br/>
 stemming from the advent of agriculture. Our point is that, over millennia, populations responded to these new pressures. People who had genetic variants that helped them deal with the new diet had more surviving children, and those variants spread: Farmers began to adapt to an agricultural diet. Humanity changed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They argue that the increased incidence of diabetes among populations who have never farmed or that haven&#39;t farmed for long is a consequence of a lesser degree of adaptation to high-carbohydrate diets. It would take time to undo the changes that our changed environment has wrought, maybe the thousands of years that it takes for fish to go blind. And while we probably still have some of the genetic predispositions of our pre-agriculture forebears, more or less depending on who they were and how they subsisted, most of us are fairly well adapted to the diet of agriculture. <br/>

<br/>
I wonder if that&#39;s really right.  Wouldn&#39;t that 90% protein also<br/>
include a pretty hefty amount of fats from which glucose levels could<br/>
be more efficiently maintained for energy?  What are the Inuit protein<br/>
sources?  Fish, bears, caribou (I have no idea)?  Animals, fish and<br/>
birds from Inuit country all have high fat for warmth and energy.  The<br/>
Inuit have been eating their diet for probably many 1000s of years.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know.  Can high enough glucose levels be made from almost<br/>
nothing but protein?<br/>
<br/>
I doubt if *I* could live on 90% protein/fats.  I wouldn&#39;t want to for<br/>
one thing, and even if I did my kidneys and liver would be overworked<br/>
by all that protein intake which would pull out all sorts of calcium<br/>
and other trace minerals during excretion.  I can live on higher<br/>
amounts of protein than some.  I am not a high percentage carb eater.<br/>
But I don&#39;t eat anything like 90% or even 50% protein.<br/>
<br/>
Originally I posted that there&#39;s a huge range of variation in diet,<br/>
energy needs and preference.  Just in terms of higher or less demand<br/>
for glucose.  In my view, how we go about that is more individualistic<br/>
than is generally thought.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And unless the parents are siblings or first cousins, it&#39;s really  <br/>
likely that there will be unexpected differences in the children,  <br/>
especially if the parents are from two different gene pools  <br/>
altogether.  So what&#39;s good for the mom might not be good for the  <br/>
kid.  And in the case of adoption, the parents can swear up and down  <br/>
that a food is nourishing or &quot;bad&quot; or will give a kid the runs, or  <br/>
won&#39;t, and they might just be making noise in the wind.<br/>
<br/>
IF a child is allowed to try foods and decide on his own stopping  <br/>
place (none of the &quot;clean your plate&quot; pressure), and if there are food  <br/>
choices and peace and love in the house, then It&#39;s unlikely he or she  <br/>
will eat out of spite or despearation or fear or &#39;gluttony.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
People cannot ever become attuned to what their bodies need if someone  <br/>
else is TELLING them what&#39;s good and bad and how they should be feeling.<br/>
