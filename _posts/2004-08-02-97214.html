<div id="ygrps-yiv-565511265">How do I explain to my kids that what I am doing is different without <br/>
dredging up a past that my mom and I have both left behind?<br/>
<br/>
****************************************<br/>
<br/>
My kids spend lots of time with my parents... 20 years ago I would <br/>
have sworn to you that I would NEVER allow that to happen.  The fact <br/>
is, they are FAR better at grandparenting than they ever were at <br/>
parenting.  It&#39;s human evolution at it&#39;s finest and I&#39;m very lucky to <br/>
witness it.  Upon returning from a fun date with them, Hannah <br/>
remarked, &quot;It must have been SO fun to grow up with them!&quot;  Without <br/>
being a total fun-killer, I explained that I am glad she has fun with <br/>
her grandparents but her relationship with them is really very <br/>
different than when *I* was her age.  I didn&#39;t go into specifics, but <br/>
did talk about spanking, yelling, and the lack of respect in our <br/>
home.  It was the greatest lesson I could have given her on &quot;When we <br/>
know better, we do better.&quot;  I have no fear of my children being hit, <br/>
having food withheld or being shamed when with my parents.  My <br/>
children have the strength to stand up for themselves that I never <br/>
had and my parents are so grateful for my children&#39;s love and my <br/>
forgiveness that it wouldn&#39;t enter their minds at this point.  My dad <br/>
doesn&#39;t even smoke in his own house when my kids are over!  <br/>
<br/>
DH reconciled with his absent father when we were 28, saw him for the <br/>
first time since age 3 when we were 29... Mitch didn&#39;t want his Dad <br/>
at that point, he wanted a grandfather for his children.  He was open <br/>
enough to allow his children to have a relationship with a man with <br/>
whom he had NOT had relationship because he felt it was their right <br/>
to have their OWN perspective on the man, Mitch&#39;s feelings aside.  <br/>
Had they not been dying of cancer at the same time, I have no doubt <br/>
Mitch would have been at the man&#39;s side for his last moments of <br/>
life.  <br/>

COOL!<br/>
<br/>
If they have you as a model, and their grandparents *now* as models, maybe <br/>
their kids will have lots of fun growing up.<br/>

<br/>
Good phrase.  Good  story and I&#39;m glad your parents are getting to make up <br/>
for somethings indirectly, and you&#39;re getting to see that they know better.<br/>

<br/>
I have a big pang of sorrow for you every time you remind us of your loss, <br/>
but I never mind being reminded that I should appreciate my husband even when <br/>
he&#39;s irritating.  And I&#39;m sorry yours is gone too soon.<br/>

I wonder if, from your parents view, they&#39;re trying to make up for the <br/>
mistakes they made when you were younger.  I see this in my parents.  My mom has <br/>
apologized a few times for not doing something, or doing something wrong when I <br/>
was a kid.  It&#39;s funny, because some things she feels bad about I don&#39;t even <br/>
remember, or was not bothered by it!<br/>
<br/>
I think I will be a good grandma some day.  I have learned (mostly through <br/>
this list) how to be kinder to my children.  I WANT the chance to be kinder, <br/>
more attentive, more mindful to a child from the very start of their lives.  <br/>
Maybe I can help my children do the same for their kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286456628">Nancy - this is so nicely said. I read it and realized I feel the exact <br/>
same way. My mom was a pretty good mom - but was very young when she <br/>

there, sometimes getting into too much drinking, etc). But she was a <br/>
GREAT grandmother - absolutely the very best grandmother possible. AND <br/>
a great mom of grown women to me and my two sisters. I want to be that <br/>

I am so glad that you have experienced transormations in your parents as<br/>
they have become grandparents.  You should count your blessings every day.<br/>
That&#39;s an incredible gift.<br/>
<br/>
And even for those of us who have not been blessed in such a way, there is a<br/>
lot of hope in what you have to say, because WE can learn from our own<br/>
situations.  I look SO forward to being a grandmother, myself, and being<br/>
what I always longed for for my children.  Every kid should have a wonderful<br/>
grandparent, and my awareness of what they missed out on because of the<br/>
human frailties of their grandparents makes me  that much more determined.<br/>
<br/>
This is going to be so much FUN -- and I shouldn&#39;t have that much longer to<br/>
wait, what with my 19yo dd in a serious relationship and all...   :-)<br/>

My mom has recently been doing the same thing--&quot;admitting&quot; her regrets<br/>
regarding her parenting to me--and what she regrets aren&#39;t the things that<br/>
upset me when I was a kid.  What she is sorry about is more related to her<br/>
new fundamentalist religious views.  It&#39;s a bit frustrating to listen to her<br/>
apologize for things that didn&#39;t even consider a problem at all, like going<br/>
out dancing when I was old enough to babysit my brothers and sisters, yet<br/>
continue in the things that did,  like laying guilt-trips and screaming at<br/>
me (now via email about my unsaved soul!)  Sheesh.<br/>
