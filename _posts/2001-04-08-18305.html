&gt; It&#39;s an excellent read and, I think, full of truth--worth a few minutes of<br/>
&gt; your time. While he doesn&#39;t mention homeschooling this speaker does<br/>
advocate<br/>
&gt; breaking up the government monopoly.<br/>

&gt; Champion of Freedom Encourages Parents to Enter Educational Debate<br/>
&gt; -----------------------<br/>
&gt; The Education Policy is pleased that its efforts to foster a competitive<br/>
&gt; education industry are shared by a number of outstanding leaders in<br/>
&gt; American society.  Few are as astute as Ted Forstmann, Chairman and CEO,<br/>
&gt; Parents in Charge, who made these remarks Wednesday to a group gathered<br/>
&gt; at the National Press Club.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Make Education look more like America: Put Parents in Charge<br/>
&gt; National Press Club<br/>
&gt; April 3, 2001<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was three years ago, here at the National Press Club, that I<br/>
&gt; announced the formation of the Children&#39;s Scholarship Fund. It has<br/>
&gt; exceeded our fondest hopes as we have been able to help 40,000 low<br/>
&gt; income children escape failing public schools and seek a quality<br/>
&gt; education in the school of their choice. Personally, I have evolved from<br/>
&gt; a person with simple charitable objectives into someone who has become<br/>
&gt; painfully aware of the real facts of the education system in America.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So today I would like to share with you what I have learned and to tell<br/>
&gt; you the unvarnished truth as I see it. I&#39;m going to suggest that we do<br/>
&gt; not have a real education debate in this country. What we have are<br/>
&gt; competing ideas for tinkering with the same old system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;re like the famous mythical Emperor&#39;s loyal subjects, debating<br/>
&gt; whether his hat is red, or his boots are green - when in fact, he isn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; wearing anything at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now the little boy who first had the temerity to say out loud that the<br/>
&gt; Emperor had no clothes was, you will recall, given a pretty hard time. I<br/>
&gt; guess I&#39;m ready for that. In fact, in the early days of the Children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; Scholarship Fund an education bureaucrat actually called me<br/>
&gt; &quot;un-American&quot; on a television news show. Un-American for helping 40,000<br/>
&gt; underprivileged kids? it got me thinking, in this context what really is<br/>
&gt; American or un-American after all?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, to me, America is a democratic capitalist country. That&#39;s pretty<br/>
&gt; basic. Democratic means you have choices. It means people are free to<br/>
&gt; choose all sorts of things - from who to vote for, to how to pray, to<br/>
&gt; what to read, even free to drive multi-ton vehicles up to 65 miles per<br/>
&gt; hour. Capitalism would imply that multiple suppliers compete, on a<br/>
&gt; relatively level playing field, for the business of these free people<br/>
&gt; who we call customers. But I want you to notice that in K-12 education,<br/>
&gt; not a word that I have just spoken applies. We don&#39;t allow people to<br/>
&gt; choose where their children go to school, who teaches them or what they<br/>
&gt; learn - and we have one supplier with essentially no competition.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Obviously, that&#39;s monopolistic. And given the fact that the payment for<br/>
&gt; the product is mandatory - through taxes - and consumption of the<br/>
&gt; product is compulsory - through attendance laws -- that&#39;s about as<br/>
&gt; powerful a monopoly as has ever existed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the way, we passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act outlawing monopolies in<br/>
&gt; 1890 because we came to a national consensus that monopolies produce a<br/>
&gt; low quality product at a high price. That&#39;s another fact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So here&#39;s where I begin to feel like the little boy looking at the naked<br/>
&gt; Emperor. Because when it comes to the so-called education debate, all<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ve really been asking ourselves is what kind of monopoly we ought to<br/>
&gt; have - one with longer hours, or smaller class sizes, or more buildings,<br/>
&gt; or what. No one asks what seems to me to be the really obvious question,<br/>
&gt; which is: why do we have a monopoly in K-12 education at all? Why in a<br/>
&gt; country that is both democratic and capitalist, and that has a<br/>
&gt; university system that is highly competitive and the envy of the world,<br/>
&gt; does none of this apply to K- 12 education?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well surely, there must be a reason. We are told that America was<br/>
&gt; founded on a system of government schools - and that therefore, they are<br/>
&gt; a fundamental underpinning of our society. This is totally false. In<br/>
&gt; fact, our founders consciously chose to base the country on an open<br/>
&gt; system of education - one in which any legitimate supplier could enter<br/>
&gt; the market and compete, and parents could choose from among them.<br/>
&gt; Competition kept quality high and costs low. It wasn&#39;t until 100 years<br/>
&gt; after our founding, that things changed when Horace Mann convinced the<br/>
&gt; Massachusetts legislature to start a government-operated system in that<br/>
&gt; state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both utopianism and bigotry played a role. Mann promised that if<br/>
&gt; Massachusetts adopted his ideas, &quot;nine-tenths of the crimes in the penal<br/>
&gt; code would become obsolete.&quot; But, in reality, both he and his followers<br/>
&gt; were concerned about the large numbers of Irish Catholic immigrants<br/>
&gt; entering the country, and felt that government schools were the best way<br/>
&gt; to homogenize them within the broader Anglo-Saxon, Protestant society.<br/>
&gt; Parents who once had authority over their children&#39;s education had it<br/>
&gt; taken gradually away -sometimes at the point of a bayonet. The whole<br/>
&gt; thing might not even have survived had it not been adopted and very<br/>
&gt; heavily sponsored by major industrialists like Carnegie, Rockefeller,<br/>
&gt; Ford and Astor who believed a standardized, bureaucratic system could<br/>
&gt; turn out compliant workers to staff their new factories, oil fields and<br/>
&gt; coal mines.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, so it turns out that the system we have is in fact the opposite of<br/>
&gt; what the founders had in mind. But if it is a good system, maybe it only<br/>
&gt; needs to be changed in some way or other. We&#39;re told repeatedly that<br/>
&gt; more money is needed to make the system work. But dozens of studies have<br/>
&gt; tried to show a connection bet`.veen money and learning without success.<br/>
&gt; In fact we&#39;ve increased spending fourteen-fold in inflation-adjusted<br/>
&gt; terms since 1920, yet our schools, by just about every conceivable<br/>
&gt; measure from test scores to basic safety, continue to perform at a<br/>
&gt; mediocre level. That should come as no surprise. I think you all know<br/>
&gt; without my telling you that no monopoly in history has ever been<br/>
&gt; reformed by raising its prices, or for that matter expanding office<br/>
&gt; hours, building more office space, or even by making its customers wear<br/>
&gt; uniforms.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, we have a new administration. President Bush and Secretary Paige<br/>
&gt; are in charge and we are fortunate that they are because they bring<br/>
&gt; impressive credentials and the best of intentions to bear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you know they have proposed instituting standards and accountability<br/>
&gt; and that is very salutory. Every good CEO taking over a business would<br/>
&gt; institute standards and demand accountability. But they still would have<br/>
&gt; to compete against other suppliers. So, I submit that standards and<br/>
&gt; accountability - while beneficial for the organization you are in charge<br/>
&gt; of, are in no way the equal of, or a substitute for competition and<br/>
&gt; freedom of choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, we are paying a huge price by being so willfully<br/>
&gt; myopic. By refusing to open this system up, we continue to perpetuate a<br/>
&gt; kind of educational apartheid. While more affluent families can buy<br/>
&gt; themselves better options -- either by sending their children to private<br/>
&gt; schools, or moving out to more expensive suburbs with better public<br/>
&gt; schools - poor parents are stuck with no option other than government<br/>
&gt; schools that can&#39;t teach or even protect their children. The result: 70<br/>
&gt; percent of our inner city 4th graders are unable to read at even a basic<br/>
&gt; level - that&#39;s according to the Department of Education. To illustrate a<br/>
&gt; point I made just a moment ago: right here, in our nation&#39;s capital, we<br/>
&gt; have the highest per pupil education spending, and lowest performance,<br/>
&gt; of any urban school district in America. Normally we expect children to<br/>
&gt; learn more as they advance through schools, but this school system has<br/>
&gt; managed to turn that expectation on its head -- according to a report<br/>
&gt; issued by the District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and<br/>
&gt; Management Assistance Authority in November, 1996, &quot;the longer students<br/>
&gt; stay in the District&#39;s public school system, the less likely they are to<br/>
&gt; succeed educationally.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It was this kind of inequality that convinced me three years ago to<br/>
&gt; start the Children&#39;s Scholarship Fund. John Walton and I pooled together<br/>
&gt; $200 million, and offered some 40,000 scholarships. Our offices were<br/>
&gt; completely overwhelmed by the response: we received 1.25 million<br/>
&gt; applications from all over the country - sent in, in some cities from as<br/>
&gt; many as a third of the eligible population. Consider that these were all<br/>
&gt; from people who were already getting their product for free, who had an<br/>
&gt; average yearly income of $20,000 a year, and yet who were willing to put<br/>
&gt; up $1,000 per child in order to take advantage of these partial<br/>
&gt; scholarships. And some people still seriously suggest that parents don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; care or aren&#39;t qualified to be in charge of their children&#39;s education.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, I think I have news for you - very big news. We commissioned the<br/>
&gt; SWR Whitman Group and The Wirthlin Group to produce bi-partisan polling<br/>
&gt; on this subject. The results are eye-opening. 69% of those polled<br/>
&gt; believed parents, as opposed to government, should set the standards for<br/>
&gt; educational performance. 72% agreed that our educational system would be<br/>
&gt; improved if there were a multitude of suppliers. And 82% believed<br/>
&gt; parents should be able to choose their children&#39;s school. You have the<br/>
&gt; full survey and methodology in your press kits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So we verified what parents want. We also wanted to know what teachers<br/>
&gt; thought. More than 11,000 teachers, including Polly Broussard of the<br/>
&gt; Associated Professional Educators of Louisiana, John Taylor Gatto, New<br/>
&gt; York State Teacher of the Year, Ernestine Sanders of Cornerstone Schools<br/>
&gt; in Detroit, Michigan, Michael Feinberg of KIPP Academies in Houston, Guy<br/>
&gt; Doud of Staples, Minnesota, and Thomas Fleming of Michigan, both of whom<br/>
&gt; are National Public School Teachers of the Year, and all of whom are<br/>
&gt; here today, have signed onto a Statement of Principles which says<br/>
&gt; amongst other things:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We believe: Parents and guardians, not government, have primary<br/>
&gt; responsibility for and authority over their children&#39;s education.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We believe: Children are the reason for a system of education, and that<br/>
&gt; system&#39;s needs must not take precedence over the needs of children;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We believe: Teaching is a profession and good teachers deserve<br/>
&gt; recognition and compensation based on their performance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We believe: Government currently controls the vast majority of schools<br/>
&gt; in this country; our system of education would be improved by a<br/>
&gt; multitude of providers as opposed to a government monopoly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And by the way, not only do 11,000 teachers support these principles -<br/>
&gt; so do two Secretaries of Education, Bill Bennett and Joe Califano. A<br/>
&gt; third, current Secretary of Education Rod Paige, speaking at a<br/>
&gt; conference I also addressed just last month, declared that, &quot;the idea of<br/>
&gt; public school monopoly is dead. It needs to be relegated to the<br/>
&gt; Smithsonian.&quot; He also said to me, &quot;Ted, the arguments against your<br/>
&gt; position are all bogus.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The support of thousands of teachers and millions of parents - is why<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m here today. I&#39;m here to launch Parents in Charge, a bipartisan<br/>
&gt; organization which advocates the following:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That every child - regardless of race, creed, or household income - must<br/>
&gt; have an equal opportunity to receive a quality education. That parents<br/>
&gt; have a prior right to determine what sort of education be given to their<br/>
&gt; child. And therefore that parents have a right to choose: where their<br/>
&gt; children attend school, and have a say in who teaches them, and what<br/>
&gt; they learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have created Parents in Charge to advance these principles, and to<br/>
&gt; educate America in a national campaign as to the real problems and real<br/>
&gt; possibilities of American education.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While we know that monopolies don&#39;t work - we also know what does.<br/>
&gt; Freedom of choice and competition work. Listen to what my fellow board<br/>
&gt; member and former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles has to say:<br/>
&gt; &quot;There has never been an industry, never been a company, never been a<br/>
&gt; product that has not been improved by competition.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have an example of this, even within education itself. It&#39;s our<br/>
&gt; system of higher education - and it&#39;s the envy of the world. Consumers<br/>
&gt; are free to choose among all sorts of different options - including<br/>
&gt; state-run, and even religious institutions. And suppliers are free to<br/>
&gt; set up schools, compete on a fairly level playing field, and even, after<br/>
&gt; meeting certain basic certifications, receive government funding -<br/>
&gt; which, by the way, isn&#39;t considered school aid, but student aid. This<br/>
&gt; kind of freedom for consumers and freedom for suppliers produces high<br/>
&gt; quality, innovation, and specialization to meet a diverse universe of<br/>
&gt; students&#39; needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You can go at night, part time, or even online; you can pursue general<br/>
&gt; studies, or a specific discipline. And if you aren&#39;t satisfied, you<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t going to be forced to sit there for four years - you can transfer<br/>
&gt; to a school that better suits your goals and needs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For the same kind of thing to occur in our primary and secondary schools<br/>
&gt; we need to have equality of opportunity not just for consumers, but for<br/>
&gt; suppliers as well. It&#39;s no good to say that families are free to choose<br/>
&gt; their children&#39;s schools when there are no schools to choose from. This<br/>
&gt; was brought home to me a year ago when we offered to fill every empty<br/>
&gt; seat in New York&#39;s private and parochial schools. While we were able to<br/>
&gt; help 3,400 children, there are 162,000 children still waiting to be<br/>
&gt; helped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there&#39;s nowhere for them to go. There&#39;s no supply because suppliers<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have an equal opportunity to compete. How can they - when their<br/>
&gt; customers have to pay twice, first in terms of taxes, then in terms of<br/>
&gt; tuition? No wonder the majority of existing suppliers are either those<br/>
&gt; who are willing to forgo making a profit - namely, parochial schools -<br/>
&gt; or those elite institutions, which cater to customers at the highest end<br/>
&gt; of the income scale.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The powerful interests that work so tirelessly to maintain the status<br/>
&gt; quo claim that fundamental changes would be too difficult and too<br/>
&gt; disruptive. But consider this. The payment method would be the same. We<br/>
&gt; would all continue to chip in with our tax dollars - some a great deal,<br/>
&gt; some a little, some not at all. The government would continue to be the<br/>
&gt; collection agent but not the sole supplier of the product. Instead,<br/>
&gt; there would be multiple qualified suppliers - including the government.<br/>
&gt; Parents would be free to choose among these suppliers and funding would<br/>
&gt; be allocated on the basis of their choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Please remember, this was a right parents once enjoyed - and it was<br/>
&gt; taken away. Horace Mann started us down this path proclaiming that<br/>
&gt; parents should be taken out of the equation entirely and that their<br/>
&gt; children should be considered &quot;hostages&quot; to the great cause of<br/>
&gt; government schooling. What would happen if Mann&#39;s &quot;hostages&quot; were<br/>
&gt; released - if parents were put back in charge of their children&#39;s<br/>
&gt; education? Parents as consumers would demand quality, safety, and<br/>
&gt; variety. Suppliers would utilize technology, innovation and private<br/>
&gt; investment to compete for their business. The teaching profession would<br/>
&gt; benefit as well. Yes, bad teachers would not make it. But good teachers<br/>
&gt; would finally get the high regard and higher pay they deserve. And<br/>
&gt; perhaps most importantly, I believe that putting parents in charge would<br/>
&gt; revitalize families as well. We worry about the dissolution of families.<br/>
&gt; But we have reaped what we have sown: by taking away one of the family&#39;s<br/>
&gt; most important responsibilities and bonding functions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So here&#39;s the bottom line of what I&#39;m talking about: freedom, choice,<br/>
&gt; competition. Equal opportunity for both consumers and suppliers. As I<br/>
&gt; look out at all of you, I see some skeptical faces and I sympathize.<br/>
&gt; This would have seemed pretty radical to me too when I appeared here<br/>
&gt; three years ago with nothing more than a desire to help some<br/>
&gt; underprivileged children. And I want to freely admit to you that with<br/>
&gt; regard to the conventional wisdom on all sides of the so-called<br/>
&gt; education debate, this is pretty different stuff. But I&#39;ll bet that most<br/>
&gt; of you will agree with me that what I&#39;ve been talking about is pretty<br/>
&gt; normal in most every other area of American life. Because I&#39;m really<br/>
&gt; just talking about freedom. I&#39;m really just talking about making K-12<br/>
&gt; education look more like the rest of America - including our much<br/>
&gt; admired university system.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Freedom ought not to be on trial - the absence of freedom should be. The<br/>
&gt; burden of proof ought not to be on parents seeking their rights - but on<br/>
&gt; those who would deny them those rights. We should all be seeking a<br/>
&gt; system that educates the public - not continuing to live in denial about<br/>
&gt; the anachronistic system we now have, in which so many children are left<br/>
&gt; behind. I&#39;m asking you to think about the possibility of a new day in<br/>
&gt; which education would be more democratic, more creative and competitive<br/>
&gt; - in a word, yes, so much more American than the system we have now.<br/>
&gt; Thank you.<br/>
