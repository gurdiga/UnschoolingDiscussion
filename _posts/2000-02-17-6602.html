<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809566036">Despite the fact that our computer seems so s..l..o..w, I still enjoy poking around on the web.  My 17-yr-old daughter, however, is far too impatient to get much enjoyment out of waiting for pages to appear.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is the same way--he gets positively itchy sitting in front of the screen waiting and waiting for the information we wants. In the years we&#39;ve had computers, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s used them more than a dozen times (except for the occasional game).<br/>
<br/>
I used a friend&#39;s spiffy new computer the other day and found that, while it was faster than ours, it still seemed to take a lot of time.  I&#39;m assuming that in the not-too-distant future computers will take you where you want to go with just a touch.  Does anyone have one like that?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1854048440">Our computer is also a dinosaur&lt;G&gt;, however we now have internet access<br/>
through our cable company, which gives us no phone line tie ups, no dial<br/>
ups, no waiting and instant downloads. I know not all cable companies offer<br/>
this, and it is more expensive than traditional internet companies, but it<br/>
might be worth looking into. We find it worth every penny!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073915970">We have internet service through our cable company and it is ALOT faster<br/>
than regular internet. I would not change back to the old phone line service<br/>
for anything! Its through Cox Cable here in VA. Our download times are cut<br/>
in half (at least!)<br/>
