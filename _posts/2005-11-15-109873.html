 </span></blockquote>Are you looking for vegan or vegetarian? I ask because there are <br/>
things like whey and casein which are cow milk related. A vegan <br/>
wouldn&#39;t touch it but there are vegetarians who eat eggs and dairy. <br/>
Same with something like honey - a vegan would likely not touch it (it <br/>
is taken from living organisms) while a vegetarian might.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the whole arena of organic products - not all vegetarian <br/>
products are necessarily organic (although often items marketed toward <br/>
vegetarians are also organic).<br/>
<br/>
Oh and keep an eye on the Worcestershire sauce - most commercial <br/>
brands use anchovies (of all things) for the saltiness. But it is <br/>
possible to find a vegan Worcestershire like sauce at some natural <br/>
food places.<br/>
<br/>
It is actually not too hard to move to vegetarian in an ovo-lacto kind <br/>
of way - vegan is harder because you remove cheeses, most milks, and <br/>
eggs. Soy milk and almond milk are alternatives if you just gotta have <br/>
your cereal in the morning (or something creamy in your coffee).<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking, if you don&#39;t know what an ingredient is, skip the <br/>
item. Easiest is to simply buy ingredients rather than packaged foods <br/>
and make things yourself. For example, if you make the plain spaghetti <br/>
sauce, you know that it has just tomatoes and seasonings because you <br/>
didn&#39;t put any meat related products into it. Of course, that could be <br/>
a whole part of the family experiment because you&#39;ll likely be cooking <br/>
more rather than heating up things (soup from scratch rather than from <br/>
a can and so on). vegsource and other websites have lots of vegetarian <br/>
and vegan recipes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-991699948">Maybe a good place to start would be to stick with fresh foods...veggies,<br/>
fruits, 100% whole grain pastas, breads, brown rice...<br/>
Is there a health food store in your area?  That would be a great fieldtrip<br/>
and it should be very easy to find vegetarian sauces and dressings.  As for<br/>
protein there are lots of meat substitutes available in the frozen food and<br/>
near the produce section of your regular store.<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I are about 95% vegetarian...we may eat something with fish or<br/>
shrimp in it here or there but at home we always cook from scratch and eat<br/>
vegetarian so if you would like more info or ideas, you are welcome to eme<br/>
off list.  I also have a client that eats strictly vegan so any given week I<br/>
am cooking 7 to 10 vegan dishes for her.<br/>
<br/>
I missed wifeswap last night.  I&#39;m happy that your fun felt inspired.  It&#39;s<br/>
a great show IMO.<br/>

typically eat in our culture - the whole &#39;meat and potatoes&#39; square <br/>
meal thing. We make sure to fit in protein for sure because spaced <br/>
out in small bits through the day it helps keep DS (and me) on a <br/>
more even keel but it&#39;s way way less than it used to be when every <br/>
dinner &quot;had to&quot; include some protein (meat, cheese, etc). I kept <br/>
track for a bit and we are now averaging betwen 50 and 75 grams per <br/>
day rather than the 100+ that is typical in the overall population. <br/>
Generally, DS eats the most protein but then he&#39;s also growing a lot <br/>
(a friend who sees him regularly commented this past weekend on how <br/>
much he&#39;s grown in the last few months). <br/>
<br/>
Some of the alternate grains like spelt are good plant protein <br/>
sources. Also, even the regular grocery stores are starting to carry <br/>
pastas with protein (made of alternated grains or added in various <br/>
ways -check labels). Personally, the spelt pasta wasn&#39;t my favorite <br/>
but there were a couple of others that were quite tasty and even <br/>
better than plain old semolina wheat pasta. And, DH even sometimes <br/>
makes (yup makes, my DH is a wonder) whole wheat lasagna noodles <br/>
rather than buying the dried store kind.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;field trip <br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Wild Oats not all that far from us (it&#39;s a 30 minute drive) <br/>
arranged a field trip for our hs group - explained the way the <br/>
labelling is (organic produce is tagged with one color, non-organic <br/>
with another - when we go there DS insists on only the organic <br/>
tagged items), looking for ingredients, etc. Don&#39;t know if they do <br/>
one person type tours but maybe you could talk to them and see what <br/>
their minimum group is - could round up one other family maybe and <br/>
that&#39;d be enough or maybe just your family would be ok.<br/>

since taking the honey from the bees is disrupting their lives to <br/>
take their energy source/food/important for life stuff, that&#39;d be <br/>
off limits.<br/>

bit of butter and honey on a cold winter&#39;s morning).<br/>

Unschooling, and equally rewarding.  :)  Rather than looking at what you <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720895879">At dinner tonight, as we finished off last night&#39;s leftover Sloppy Joe, we discussed what to fix for dinner the rest of the week.  Jackie suggested beef stew tomorrow.  I said I was reluctant, because dh&#39;s birthday is Thursday and he is thinking of grilled steak.  (I&#39;m going to make him an apple pie too.  Don&#39;t tell!  It&#39;s a surprise.  He loves fruit pie and I don&#39;t make them very often.)  I pointed out that it would mean beef every night this week.  <br/>
<br/>
Lisa said, &quot;That&#39;s OK.  We&#39;ll just have a beef week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jackie had a play date today with a new neighbor friend.  When I picked Jackie up, I asked the neighbor what she was fixing for dinner.  She told me that they are vegetarian.  One of her boys (age 5) piped up to say that *he* was not vegetarian.  Then the mom told me that her kids &quot;discovered&quot; meat this summer at a BBQ.  So she started buying meat substitutes for them.  Jackie told me later that the girl she played with told her that she is vegetarian by choice.<br/>
<br/>
I love many non-meat foods.  We eat lots of beans and tofu and meatless-meals because we like them.  But my family enjoys meat, too.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a challenge to find that balance between our preferred diet and that which we may be served by others.  It is not always pleasant when someone serves us something we&#39;d prefer not to eat.  I can, and will, eat just about anything when I&#39;m a guest.  In my own home, I make what I like and what my family likes.<br/>
<br/>
My goal for my children is to help them make their own food choices, yet not offend their hosts.  This means learning polite ways to decline, if you really can&#39;t eat something.<br/>

A week isn&#39;t probably long enough for people&#39;s digestion and systems to <br/>
really show changes, either, so as the experiment goes I don&#39;t think it will be <br/>
really enough to know what it&#39;s like to be vegetarian.    It might be like <br/>
someone who unschooled for a week. &lt;g&gt;     Not quite parallel, but there will be <br/>
some aspects of that.   <br/>

and eating turkey<br/>

I think this will be the most interesting part. This was one of Dillon&#39;s<br/>
biggest questions. How many things we eat without really knowing what is in<br/>
them? In 4-H we learned about GRAS ingredients and he found it very<br/>
interesting. <br/>

It might be fun for you to see how many of the foods you regularly eat<br/>
have critter squeezin&#39;s in them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of these can be derived from plant sources but unless &lt;and even if&gt;<br/>
you call the company you can&#39;t know which is what.<br/>
 <br/>
Glucose<br/>
Dextrose<br/>
Lard<br/>
Tallow<br/>
Lecithin<br/>
Honey<br/>
Oleic acid<br/>
Stearic acid<br/>
Lactic acid<br/>
Lactylic stearate <br/>
Glycerin <br/>
Tetradecanoic acid<br/>
Casien <br/>
Calcium cassinate<br/>
Rennet<br/>
Pepsin<br/>
Whey <br/>
Calcium Stearate<br/>
Lactose<br/>
Albumin<br/>
Carmine <br/>
Cochineal<br/>
Carminic acid<br/>
Gelatin<br/>
Monoglyceride  <br/>
Triglyceride<br/>
Diglyceride<br/>
Capric acid or decanoic acid<br/>
  <br/>
Vitamins A, B12 and D can be from animal sources.  Calcium added to<br/>
fortify foods (breads, cereals, orange juice) could be from animal<br/>
sources. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m probably forgetting some.   : /   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll be an adventure!  A weird, weird adventure. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
