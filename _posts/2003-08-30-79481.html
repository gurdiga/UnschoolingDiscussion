Betsy,<br/>
    Thank you for the tips!  I will definitely try them out.  I LOVE French<br/>
In Action...took it in college.  I always sit to watch when I catch it on<br/>
tv!<br/>
    I deschooled back when we started four years ago.  Then it seemed like I<br/>
didn&#39;t deschool enough, so we did some more.  But these schoolish notions<br/>
still persist!  I think she is afraid to venture out on her own.  She went<br/>
to school from Pre-K through 4th grade.  Alot of stuff already ingrained in<br/>
her.  She loves anything to do with Ancient Egypt, so she is venturing out<br/>
to learn all she can on that.  I am hoping she will gain confidence to<br/>
continue to do so.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sarah<br/>
