<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699567478">Bridget, when my dad died, I objected to the open casket.  My mom said,<br/>
&quot;Well, they say it is the only way for some to really accept that a<br/>
person is dead.&quot;  I said, &quot;That&#39;s stupid!  I know he&#39;s dead.&quot;  A month<br/>
after he died, I had a dream he was in the living room and we were<br/>
talking, and when I woke up I thought, &quot;He&#39;s alive!  He&#39;s alive!  I have<br/>
to tell everyone.&quot;  But before I leaped out of bed to make the<br/>
announcement, the image of his body in the casket flashed in my mind. <br/>
&quot;Oh, he is dead.  It must have been a dream.&quot;<br/>
However, my sister, who was six, saw my dad in the casket and started<br/>
screaming &quot;Daddy, Daddy!&quot;  My step-mom had to pry her hands off the<br/>
casket since pulling her didn&#39;t work.  <br/>
I told my family I just want a memorial service, and for my body to be<br/>
donated to science.  They pay for your burial that way.  Besides, I don&#39;t<br/>
like for people to look at me when I&#39;m sick, much less when I&#39;m dead. <br/>

it&#39;s too bad you felt the need to invalidate your mom&#39;s feelings.....maybe<br/>
it stemmed from your own grief reaction.<br/>
<br/>
I can see that some would &#39;need&#39;  open casket....or some ritual with the<br/>

discontinuing &#39;wakes&#39;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168132962">Susan, I&#39;m not sure what you mean by me invalidating my mother&#39;s<br/>
feelings.  She didn&#39;t express any.  We were on the airplane to my dad&#39;s<br/>
funeral when I was sixteen years old, and she was concerned that I wasn&#39;t<br/>
showing any grief.  I actually had said nothing about his death to her,<br/>
and hadn&#39;t cried in her presence.  The first thing I said in response was<br/>
to object to the open casket.  I just thought it made no sense since my<br/>
dad wasn&#39;t in that body anymore.  I don&#39;t know why it bothered me, maybe<br/>
I was just not wanting to accept he was dead by looking at the body?  Or<br/>
maybe I had a distant memory of being only 3 or 4 and going to funerals<br/>
with an elderly lady who took care of me when I was young, seeing a lot<br/>
of dead bodies of strangers.  Or maybe I was avoiding the issue of<br/>
showing grief.  The point was, my mom&#39;s words were proven right later<br/>
when I had that dream.  The experience of seeing my dad&#39;s body was<br/>
traumatic for my younger six-year-old sister, however.  I thought my dad<br/>
looked handsome in his horse-showing clothes, boots, hat, buckle and all.<br/>
 Except he looked darker...he was a dark skinned man.<br/>
Oh, it just occurred to me that you thought my mom chose the open casket.<br/>
 No, I think my uncle did.  Or maybe my step-mom.  No one asked me, of<br/>
course. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Perhaps that has more to do with the skill of the funeral people than the<br/>
open casket, and the quality of the photos they have. Most older people<br/>
haven&#39;t had a good picture taken of them for years. And those who make the<br/>
arrangements generally assume the deceased should be dressed up and looking<br/>
his best, which isn&#39;t necessarily the way they usually looked.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that type of thing is much more meaningful than a priest who may not<br/>
have even known the person or any of the people there reading supposedly<br/>
comforting passages from the Bible.<br/>
<br/>
But some people are visual rather than verbal so what was meaningful to you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have as much meaning to them. Some people even need to touch the<br/>
body for it to seem real. It would be a shame to deny them what they need.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a small movement towards dying at home and having funerals at home<br/>
sometimes with the family preparing the body. Some people are feeling our<br/>
society is too far removed from death as it is and that it causes problems<br/>
in the grieving process.<br/>
<br/>
I typed in &quot;family-directed funeral&quot; into Google which brought up some sites<br/>
and other phrases to use if anyone&#39;s curious.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The funeral dorector is a friend of the family and knows what they <br/>
looked like.  The problem comes in trying to make them look like they <br/>
did before they were sick I think.  My dad had brain surgery and he <br/>
had gotten very bloated toward the end from the tube feedings that <br/>
were forced on my mom.  (I wish I had know then what I know now, I <br/>
would have made her refuse them more vehemantly.)  Anyway, some things <br/>
you can&#39;t fix with make-up.<br/>

way we handle funerals now.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Anyway, some things <br/>
you can&#39;t fix with make-up. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bullet holes to the forehead.  I&#39;ve seen two, in open-casket funerals.   The <br/>
makeup did a good job, but not perfect.  A little indentation, like a bruise.<br/>
<br/>
Ninth and tenth grade.  Charles Montoya in 9th.  Alice Law in 10th.  Some <br/>
combination of school and parents and other kids just too much for them.  <br/>
Charles had been my 8th grade boyfriend; his dad was our art teacher; we <br/>
played clarinet together.  Alice was in band too (trumpet), and also was in <br/>
my Sunday School class.<br/>
<br/>
That helps remind me that homeschooling is NOT for nothing, and that school <br/>
is NOT always &quot;just&quot; a necessary character-building experience.<br/>

&#39;stipid&#39;  or some phrase that (to me) indicated your strong feelings against<br/>
it,  while your other comments seemed to indicate her wanting/needing the<br/>
open casket.<br/>
<br/>
And for you and your 6 yr ols sis,  I did turn out to be<br/>
&quot;difficult&quot;/challenging.....instead of peaceful and healing.   It&#39;s just not<br/>
always (or even often,  ie ever) possible to know ahead of time which grief<br/>
rituals will be healing and which will not.<br/>
<br/>
Also,   those who have died are often said to appear to others....especially<br/>
those with a psychic gift.  That may be frightening whether or not one has<br/>
seen the body.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This happened to Cacie, not sure if I mentioned it here. We were all<br/>
sitting in the living room right after we got the phone call that my mom<br/>
had died, and Cacie saw her sitting on the couch where she always sits.<br/>
She worried about it for a couple of days and then brought it up to me,<br/>
saying she&#39;d had some hallucinations. That was in December, so she was 8,<br/>
but savvy enough to worry that she was becoming mentally ill. I told her<br/>
that those were a special kind of hallucinations, and I asked her she<br/>
felt when she saw her grandma. She said she felt good, comforted. I told<br/>
her that some people believed that the person who had died would visit to<br/>
try to comfort her loved ones, and that children were often best at<br/>
seeing them... and also that some people believed that when a person had<br/>
someone special in their life die, that person&#39;s own mind might create<br/>
visions of the person who had died, as a way of dealing with  it and<br/>
making the person feel better. I told her she was free to believe either<br/>
explanation, or both, or neither, but that  was pretty sure she wasn&#39;t<br/>
mentally ill.<br/>

You are amazing!!  This is just eaxactly how I hope to handle a situation<br/>
like this.....should it happen to one of my children.<br/>
    When I was a child I saw my grandpa.  He had &#39;appeared&#39;  after a<br/>
frightening &#39;dream&#39;....and I always felt that he was watching over me.<br/>
