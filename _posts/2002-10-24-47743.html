<div id="ygrps-yiv-588814366">Joyce: You may have something here. I thought a while ago that she was trying <br/>
to get the other child&#39;s attention, but dismissed that after some incidents <br/>
where she lashed out when she was exhausted. It more complicated to deal <br/>
with, but I&#39;m wondering now if it&#39;s a combination: a behavior she&#39;s using <br/>
when she&#39;s overtired, and also when she wants to interact (but doesn&#39;t know <br/>
how). I think we&#39;ve been looking for one answer, and it looks like it might <br/>
be more than that. <br/>
<br/>
Your idea that she isn&#39;t sure how to ask another child to play might be on <br/>
target - Kalie&#39;s our only one, and although she gets a fair amount of <br/>
playtime with other children, they&#39;re all just at the age where they&#39;re <br/>
starting to actually play with each other (instead of playing side-by-side, <br/>
but not involved with each other). <br/>
<br/>
Thanks - we&#39;ll give this one some thought, too!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve seen her walk up to a playmate who<br/>
&gt; &gt; has been playing quietly, and kick them in in the heels for no apparent<br/>
&gt; &gt; reason.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Could she be wanting the other child to play or wanting to join in but not<br/>
&gt; sure how to go about asking?<br/>
