<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Thank you! I love hearing this stuff! Did you and/or Shawn ever<br/>
&gt; consider unschooling college?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back then we sure didn&#39;t -- we read a little about it in &quot;Growing Without <br/>
Schooling&quot;.  When t the kids got older they started in Community College - and <br/>
went from there.  Shawn&#39;s upper division schooling was in Clarion PA - where <br/>
there was a fabulous dive coach (Shawn was the national champion on both the 1 <br/>
and 3 meter boards for his two years  there).  I think the kids decided that <br/>
regular college offered more of what they wanted by the time they were that age. <br/>
(Shawn in acting, Donika in music and dance, and Chris in business)  Shawn <br/>
didn&#39;t start college til he was 21, and found out it was cheaper to keep his <br/>
health insurance by becoming a full time student - and discovered he liked school.<br/>
<br/>
The kids don&#39;t do the go at 18 - finish straight thro -- <br/>
<br/>
My daughter now 21, started taking college classes as a high school student <br/>
at comm. college.  She&#39;s still there taking loads of dance classes each <br/>
semester, with a little general ed.  She feels safe there, and loves it - so what&#39;s <br/>
the hurry to get finished?  <br/>
<br/>
Knowing their own pace and their own needs I believe comes from having been <br/>
at home all those years, spending time with themselves and learning who they <br/>
are and what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
Right now Shawn is working several summer jobs - he told me he will consider <br/>
himself a success if he can support himself by acting and not have several <br/>
side jobs.  I have visions of Tom Cruise success - but he laughes!!<br/>

    Interesting this can up now and I&#39;m reading it today. ;-) Did any of<br/>
your kids have to have a GED to get their college degree? (Not com. college)<br/>
I ask because my SIL was here last night from GA and stated that students<br/>
have to have a GED or High School deploma to actually get there pieces on<br/>
paper, I mean degree. She said that you can go all you wnat but you won&#39;t<br/>
get your deploma with out a GED, etc. She see that as a holy grail I guess.<br/>
Her daughter is 10 and has had 5 yrs of french, bla bla bla.<br/>
    The saddest part is the statement that daughter made. Mom had asked her<br/>
if she would be there to push around her wheelchair in her old age. Daughter<br/>
stated she&#39;d be too busy with 2 jobs and a life of her own. :-(<br/>
    Connie thanks for sharing this with us.<br/>

&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>

Is she talking about state college in Georgia?<br/>
<br/>
I say this to anyone with young children who&#39;s putting an ounce of energy <br/>
into worrying about college:   Things will change by the time your child is <br/>
college age.<br/>
<br/>
But if she&#39;s making a claim that you don&#39;t trust to be true, just calmly ask <br/>
her where she heard or read it, and ask her to show you.   I&#39;ve never heard <br/>
it.  It might be true, or it might not be (I&#39;d bet &quot;not&quot;), but it could change <br/>
anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341226503">Thank you everyone for your replies. :-)<br/>
    I was just curious if any of you had heard or experienced this. I found<br/>
it pretty far fetched to go to college for the whole term and finish all<br/>
those credits to get a degree. Then they tell you they aren&#39;t giving you<br/>
your earned sheepskin without a GED. I thought it was laughable but curious.<br/>
    Sandra I wasn&#39;t able to ask because she left early the next morning for<br/>
home. I rarely think of the right thing to say at the time. It&#39;s always<br/>
later or the next day. LOL!<br/>
    I do know now how much she disagrees with our choice. I didn&#39;t really<br/>
know until now and it&#39;s been 8 yrs. She still doesn&#39;t know what she is<br/>
talking about. She has just run into some really unfortunite cases.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
