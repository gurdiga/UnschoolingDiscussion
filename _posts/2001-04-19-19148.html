    HOMESCHOOLING IN THE NEWS<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers are in the news across the country this month. They are<br/>
winning bees and contests in record numbers and because of that seem to be<br/>
on the media&#39;s mind. ABC News aired a national television piece on its<br/>
&quot;World News Tonight&quot; about homeschoolers being admitted to colleges.<br/>
Broadcast on April 14, you can  read the trascript of this very positive<br/>
piece at<br/>

Paige Warns Districts Of Increased Competition<br/>

This article is not about homeschooling, but it is important because it<br/>
brings to light Secretary of Education Rod<br/>
Paige&#39;s beliefs about alternative forms of education. He<br/>
is quoted as saying &quot;In addition to charter schools and private schools,<br/>
districts are likely to see growing competition from home schooling and new<br/>
Internet-based education, or &quot;cyber schools.&quot; &quot;We are in some real serious<br/>
competition and we need to figure out who we are, because we can beat the<br/>
competition.&quot;<br/>

Several homeschooled students and their parents were interviewed for this<br/>
article about homeschoolers who go on<br/>
to college. Clayton Smith, the director of admissions at<br/>
the State University College of Agriculture and Technology<br/>
at Cobleskill, is quoted as saying, &quot;Research indicated that<br/>
home-school graduates are doing very well in colleges and universities<br/>
throughout the country.&quot; This is a great<br/>
article to pass on to worried relatives!<br/>

This is an excellent article about the incredible tennis playing Williams<br/>
sisters. &quot;Into a very white establishment, filled with spoiled-rotten rich<br/>
kids, jealousy, a country-club mentality and more than a hint of racism,<br/>
along came Venus and Serena: Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses, home-schooled and<br/>
from the ghetto, without playing junior tournaments or any other<br/>
establishment games. They came separately, but as<br/>
one: The Williams family against the world.&quot;<br/>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
With this issue, we&#39;re offering a new service for NHEN members kids & teens.<br/>
We realize that often homeschooling kids need a place to let others know<br/>
about their networking projects. Whether they&#39;re trying to start a post card<br/>
exchange, working on a service project that they want to share with others,<br/>
or raising funds for a specific purpose, we&#39;d like to offer them the<br/>
opportunity to share their needs with other homeschooling families. As much<br/>
as possible, we hope to allow the children to tell you in their own words<br/>
what their project/needs are.<br/>

VIRTUAL NON-BAKE SALE TO HELP OREGON TEAM OF HOMESCHOOLERS!<br/>
We&#39;re sure you&#39;ve been asked to donate goodies to a bake sale before. Well,<br/>
this is our first virtual bake sale fundraiser and we&#39;d like you to<br/>
participate! The good news is, you don&#39;t have to bake a thing!<br/>
<br/>
Our team, the Oregon Home Education Network Secondary Destination<br/>
Imagination  Team, has won Oregon&#39;s state D. I. championship again and will<br/>
be traveling to the Global Finals competition in May!! This is a very big<br/>
deal for us as we&#39;ve been working diligently toward this since last August.<br/>
Last year, with lots of help from family, friends and supporters, we were<br/>
able to travel to Iowa where we won the international competition.<br/>
<br/>
This year we travel to Knoxville, TN for the competition. We&#39;re facing the<br/>
grueling task of raising $8,000 in just a few weeks. Like most<br/>
homeschoolers, we aren&#39;t from wealthy families, so we&#39;re turning to the<br/>
homeschooling community for help.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re asking is, instead of actually baking us a goodie to sell, you<br/>
contribute to our team the cost of the ingredients. Then, instead of<br/>
spending hours baking, just sit down in your favorite chair and have a nice,<br/>
relaxing cup of tea. Please send your contributions (checks made out to OHEN<br/>
Destination Imagination Team) in care of:<br/>
Christine Webb<br/>

AFGHAN PROJECT FOR FOSTER KIDS!<br/>
Hi, I am a 14 year old home schooler from Mass. I am involved in a community<br/>
service project called the Afghan Project.  The purpose is to supply a<br/>
personalized afghan to foster children.  There are 10, 000 foster children<br/>
in Mass. and I have helped personalize nearly 600.  I have an on line<br/>
newsletter which I send out each month looking for help. I also would like<br/>
to get other states involved.  I would like to do this through home<br/>
schoolers or 4-H.<br/>
<br/>
My personal goal is to help give 200 foster kids an afghan this year. You<br/>
can help me with this goal in many ways.<br/>
If you do not knit or crochet you could:<br/>
1. Donate:<br/>
     1. usable afghans<br/>
     2. washable 4 ply acrylic yarn<br/>
     3. knitting needles or crochet hooks<br/>
2. Make afghans - knit or crochet - any size - any color<br/>
3. create 6&quot; squares<br/>
  for knitters:  cast on 20 stitches and straight knit until 6  inches (can<br/>
do patterns but prefer not the stockinette (knit a row, purl a row)<br/>
  crochet any 6&quot; square<br/>
4. repair donated afghans<br/>
5. assemble afghans<br/>
     1. sew together squares<br/>
     2. add borders<br/>
     3. personalize afghans<br/>
6. prepare afghans for delivery (decorate bags, etc)<br/>
<br/>
There are many ways to help me with this project and I would appreciate<br/>
anything you could do.  I also could come talk to a small group that might<br/>
be interested in learning more about this project. If you want to know more<br/>
about this project, please contact Erin Rosen-Watson at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Gymkar2004@...">Gymkar2004@...</a>.<br/>

    HOT TOPICS<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
The National Home Education Network brings a new feature to NHENotes and<br/>
offers the opportunity for homeschoolers to speak out on some of the tougher<br/>
issues facing us today. We&#39;ll feature a question and comments in each issue<br/>
of NHENotes.<br/>
<br/>
This time we asked:<br/>
How do you feel about homeschoolers participating in extracurricular<br/>
activities at public schools?<br/>
<br/>
Here are some of your responses:<br/>
<br/>
I am torn on this issue.  I think it depends on how intrusive the public<br/>
school system is when the homeschooler uses the service. --Nance<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
I used to think that if I homeschooled then I should not have access to the<br/>
activities at the schools then I realized that I do pay taxes and should<br/>
have every right if I so choose.<br/>
--Laurie<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
I am not in favor - the further we stay away from government run services,<br/>
the freer we shall be. --Shannon<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t want to take part in any activities our public schools<br/>
offer to homeschoolers. I think this would open the door to the school<br/>
officials sticking their noses in our schooling. If I wanted the district to<br/>
be involved in my children&#39;s education, I would have kept them in the public<br/>
schools! I believe it would eventually  compromise my freedom as a<br/>
homeschool parent to utilize the public schools extracurricular<br/>
activities --Karen<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
My county is very welcoming to homeschoolers inviting them to participate. I<br/>
feel this is a good thing. Our taxes pay for these activities, and if<br/>
someone chooses to put their child in band or sports,I think they should be<br/>
allowed to. --Pat<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
I will not tell others how to raise their children, and I can&#39;t fault<br/>
parents who are doing what they think is best. However, I will not use the<br/>
services of the public schools, because I think that, even if there are no<br/>
problems at the outset, it invites closer scrutiny and possible regulation<br/>
of homeschools when they entangle themselves with tax-funded schools. There<br/>
are many other worthwhile opportunites for us that do not present such<br/>
complications. --Karen<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
My son plays on the high school soccer team and at this time it&#39;s the only<br/>
way possible for him to get the competition he needs with other players who<br/>
play at the same level. It has never been a problem for us and the athletic<br/>
department has been outstanding in their support...what it all boils down to<br/>
for me, is that this is a personal choice made by my son, who is passionate<br/>
about his sport. Arbitrary arguments about whether or not this is the<br/>
&quot;politically correct&quot; homeschooling choice doesn&#39;t enter into it. For him,<br/>
his love of the game and his commitment to his sport is all that matters and<br/>
I will always support him in his choice.<br/>
--Cindie<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
As long as there are no governmental strings attached, sure!  Why not?<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be great if the public school could serve as a community<br/>
resource rather than insist upon maintaining a stronghold on all those<br/>
participating in its programs?  Until that happens our family will forgo,<br/>
however. --Carol<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
Under no circumstances should homeschoolers participate in Public school<br/>
activities. This sends a two sided message. We do not want the government to<br/>
regulate homeschool yet we want to participate in government run schools.<br/>
Any contact with the public school in this day and age opens up<br/>
homeschoolers to government invasion. Many times children are only able to<br/>
participate based on test scores.  It would be much more beneficial for<br/>
homeschoolers to band together and get leagues going on their own...When<br/>
homeschoolers participate in public school activities we send the message<br/>
that we approve of the school system and that we cannot function without<br/>
it...There are always strings attached and no matter how enticing the offer<br/>
there are still consequences. Unfortunately many do not look at the whole<br/>
picture...Be sure you understand the implications by participating in public<br/>
school activities of any kind. --Beth<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s fine as long as it is very clear that the programs and<br/>
activities are public school activities, not public school activities billed<br/>
as &quot;homeschooling&quot; activities. Tough balancing act on this one! --Christine<br/>
<br/>
====================&gt;&lt;====================<br/>
<br/>
The typical objection I encounter revolves around the homeschooler taking up<br/>
a &quot;slot&quot;, thereby denying some other student the position. My usual answer<br/>
centers around having provided the same funding (taxes & fees) as any other<br/>
participant, and subjecting oneself to inferior education should not be a<br/>
prerequisite to participating in something paid for. --Bob<br/>
