<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796298338">***... but if we lift Sandra up on the highest of<br/>
pedestals then it makes everyone else look short or deficient.  That<br/>
isn&#39;t a good idea.***<br/>
<br/>
But I AM short and deficient compared to Sandra.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
I haven&#39;t had the desire to put her on a pedestal though.   I think it&#39;d<br/>
be pretty lonely up there and she&#39;d be closer to the vultures who want to<br/>
pick at her the minute they think they spot a weakness.   I appreciate<br/>
that she&#39;s down here, willingly, where the rest of us can hang around her<br/>
and benefit from her smarts.<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, the deficient.</div>
