How old is he and to whom are you needing to account?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s as much or more math than science, but soon you won&#39;t see such a <br/>
difference between math and science, I bet.  Depending what he was intending <br/>
as he worked, or what he was doing, it could also be history or language <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-671867312"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">You may call it whatever you like.
<br>
<br>Science, math, art, geometry, abstract thinking, pattern creation, logic, 
<br>color coordination, bridge and stucture building, architecture, reading (the 
<br>book where he got the idea to build the castle or whatever it was), history 
<br>(the book about the castle), space travel (that&#39;s what it reminds me of), etc.
<br>
<br>What would he call it, I wonder? 
<br>
<br>Hey, all we did was goof off here today -- we found eggs and ate too much 
<br>candy!
<br>
<br>I wonder what I should call that????
<br>
<br>Home-economics, health, holidays/history, reproduction/science (there were 
<br>eggs!), art (dyeing the eggs -- hey, there were stickers too!!) . . 
<br>
<br>Anyway, Legos are cool, I think, because they expand into so many things 
<br>beyond the picture on the box. &nbsp;Which has become a few big tupperware-type 
<br>tubs with all these different Legos jumbled together so who knows what they 
<br>will be next.

He is 9, almost 10.
<br>We are required to keep a log of shool type activities in our State.
We live in Mo. My motivation is that the amount of work he was putting
into it should go toward school hours.
<br>He had an imaginary setting he had created. He was making up a story
about what the cars were to be used for, and was designing a building to
go along with the story line. When I asked how he was doing, he told me
all about it in great detail.&nbsp; When he plays with Legos, he typically
does this.&nbsp; I am thinking as I answer you that I could also use it&nbsp;
as Language Arts.
<br>There was no music or TV on at that time. It just worked out that way
today.
<br>I am beginning to see what you mean about there not being much of a
difference between Math and Science. The reasoning/logic skills are similar.
As he gets older, it is hard to tell how to separate them. It gets to be
a real judgement call. My rule of thumb is that if in doubt, I give him
credit for both.
<br>I asked him what he thought itwas and he said he thinks it should be
both science and math. The science is &quot;how it will hold together and the
math is &quot;how it will do it.&quot; I understand what he saying because I heard
him thinking out loud while he was designing the building and analyzing
the shapes of the Legos and their geometric&nbsp; relationships.

ALWAYS give credit for both.  If he&#39;s listening to music while he&#39;s doing <br/>
something you intend to count as math, count it as both.<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to find some unschoolers in Missouri and see how they are <br/>
keeping records.  You shouldn&#39;t have to keep a by-the-hour log longterm.  <br/>
When you get more comfortable with unschooling you&#39;ll relax and summarize, I <br/>

  <blockquote TYPE="CITE"><pre>How old is he and to whom are you needing to account?

It&#39;s as much or more math than science, but soon you
won&#39;t see such a&nbsp;
difference between math and science, I bet.&nbsp; Depending
what he was intending&nbsp;
as he worked, or what he was doing, it could also be
history or language&nbsp;
arts.&nbsp; Was he singing?&nbsp; Talking to himself about a
totally unrelated topic?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Was there a movie or music on at the same time?&nbsp; Was he
sculpting or just&nbsp;
engineering?

Sandra</pre></blockquote>He is 9, almost 10. <br>We are required to keep a log 
  of shool type activities in our State. We live in Mo. My motivation is that 
  the amount of work he was putting into it should go toward school hours. 
  <br>He had an imaginary setting he had created. He was making up a story about 
  what the cars were to be used for, and was designing a building to go along 
  with the story line. When I asked how he was doing, he told me all about it in 
  great detail.&nbsp; When he plays with Legos, he typically does this.&nbsp; I 
  am thinking as I answer you that I could also use it&nbsp; as Language Arts. 
  <br>There was no music or TV on at that time. It just worked out that way 
  today. <br>I am beginning to see what you mean about there not being much of a 
  difference between Math and Science. The reasoning/logic skills are similar. 
  As he gets older, it is hard to tell how to separate them. It gets to be a 
  real judgement call. My rule of thumb is that if in doubt, I give him credit 
  for both. <br>I asked him what he thought itwas and he said he thinks it 
  should be both science and math. The science is &quot;how it will hold together and 
  the math is &quot;how it will do it.&quot; I understand what he saying because I heard 
  him thinking out loud while he was designing the building and analyzing the 
  shapes of the Legos and their geometric&nbsp; relationships. <br>What do you 
  think? <br>Norma <br><br><tt>Message

I know what you mean. We have lot of&nbsp; them in some Tupperware and
Rubbermaid conatiners that are out to the original boxes. They lead to
so many adventures. I enjoy playing with them as much as my son does.

Don&#39;t let me kid you, we had a relaxing day too. We had an Easter/Birthday
celebration at my Mother-in Law&#39;s house on Saturday and ate too much, including
candy. Yesterday we all goofed off for a large part of the day. My son
chose Legos while I surfed on the internet and my husband took a turn playing
an adventure game on the Playstation.

You should be able to find some unschoolers in Missouri

When you get more comfortable with unschooling you&#39;ll

I know you are right about relaxing... Unschooling is definitely the way
to go for us. I will also&nbsp; feel better when we start the summer and
I have all year to make sure I meet the state&#39;s requirements. My concern
is that since I pulled him out of school&nbsp; in the middle of the year
that I want to have all of my bases covered. I have talked with some homeschoolers
in our area who have given me a bit of help in the are of recording. I
am still learning how to translate our everyday activities into educationalese.
