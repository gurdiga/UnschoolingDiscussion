<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813133129"><html><font SIZE="2">I just thought i would add my 2 cents here. What happens to be so terribly <br>bad about shopping the day after Thanksgiving? I feel if its done as a family <br>it can definatly be a fun thing. I personaly love to take advantage of the <br>*low* prices offered through specials the day after Thanksgiving. I have 3 <br>children and a very very limited budget so this shoping day with all its <br>specials really helps me out tremendously. Plus it&#39;s just all part of the <br>Christmas feel. Almost like snow. It just seems to me to make things more <br>Chrismasy.
<br>But this is just my opinion of course and everyone is entitled to do their <br>*own*thing, but I feel it might be more of a crusade to protest something of <br>value instead of one shopping day a year:-)
<br>Hope all had a wonderful Thanksgiving.....

<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
That fateful biggest-shopping-day, I bought cloth for Holly&#39;s girlscout <br/>
uniform, and I went to a Salvation Army thriftstore which was having a <br/>
$1-per-garment sale.   Both sales were on because it was the Thursday after <br/>
Thanksgiving.  Had I needed or wanted to go to one of the malls in which I&#39;ve <br/>
been shopping since I was a teenager (and that was the 1960&#39;s/70&#39;s) I would <br/>
have been pretty miffed if I&#39;d had to face people yelling at me about <br/>
ANYTHING.  <br/>
<br/>
Christmas gift-giving is one of my best things.  My siblings and cousins used <br/>
to call me &quot;Sandra Claus&quot; even when we were kids because I could do something <br/>
cool without a bunch of money.  It&#39;s one of my few creative talents.  I&#39;ve <br/>
fallen down some with being older and having other things to think about, but <br/>
shopping sales is a very good thing to do.  It would be &quot;better&quot; (not good at <br/>
all) to protest those who wait until December 23 or 24, but some of them do <br/>
so because they have no days off earlier, or no money earlier.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I split little matching (matching length) cedar sticks to dip in <br/>
wax to bundle to give to friends as fire-starters.  I&#39;ll pack them in little <br/>
baskets (thrift store, garage sale, things gifts were given to me in--they&#39;re <br/>
all out in the garage, and I&#39;ll just dig through for some good sizes) and <br/>
stick a bow on them and maybe put a little bag of cookies.  <br/>
<br/>
But I did go shopping Thursday, and I&#39;m not evil nor stupidly mesmerized by <br/>
advertising.<br/>
