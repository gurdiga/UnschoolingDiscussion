&gt; whatever you wrote initially.  I didn&#39;t read that post... my response<br/>
&gt; was to what someone wrote about corporal punishment.  I still believe<br/>
&gt; spanking is abusive and if you don&#39;t that&#39;s ok, that&#39;s what you are<br/>
&gt; comfortable with.  However I notice you spend a lot of time defending<br/>
&gt; it and being outraged that other people think spanking is abusive.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s life... People in this world seem to all have differing<br/>
&gt; opinions about things and just because they don&#39;t jive with yours<br/>
&gt; does not mean they are offensive, rude or whatever you want to call<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>

<br/>
I think that the outrage that you noticed came more from being jumped on so<br/>
severely for holding a view that contrasted with those of others on this<br/>
list. In other words, it was a REACTION to the reactions of others. It&#39;s<br/>
human nature that when we feel attacked, we will suually return the favor,<br/>
especially if we feel blindsided, which may have well been the case with the<br/>
author of the original post. After all, after having seen any number of<br/>
posts on any number of wide ranging topics, she felt free to bring a concern<br/>
to the table, so tospeak. And promptly got stomped on. Repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
As it happens , I don&#39;t agree with her views on spanking, but I don&#39;t agree<br/>
with some of the venom that has been slung in her direction either. A little<br/>
more civility and a little less self-righteousness would be a real nice<br/>
addition to the discussion right about now. Dontcha think?<br/>
