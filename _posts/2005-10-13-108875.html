<div id="ygrps-yiv-576971837">Here is a link for the person who posted that they might move to the U.S. or <br/>
Canada to help narrow it down, and for others, either for fun or if you are <br/>
longing for a different place to live.<br/>
It&#39;s a quiz that takes about 10 minutes and they give you a list of the 24 most <br/>
compatible places in the U.S. for you to live:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.findyourspot.com/default.asp?NewQ=3">http://www.findyourspot.com/default.asp?NewQ=3</a><br/>
Then you could narrow it down to fewer places and repost your question <br/>
about homeschooling laws and such, since they varry from state to state. <br/>
Have fun!<br/>
