<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819003763">***The shooting and killing used to bother me and maybe still does a bit<br/>
but I think it&#39;s really the gore that bothers me the most especially for<br/>
dc so young.***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok that it bothers you.  As I get older I&#39;m less interested in gore.<br/>
 I used to go to every slasher film I could, in my younger days.  While<br/>
I&#39;m less intrigued with arterial spray for art&#39;s sake I&#39;m still<br/>
fascinated by disgusting things in real life.  I stop to view dead birds<br/>
and such when I find them.   I like to think I&#39;m building a model of<br/>
death in my own mind for later reference.  Much later, hopefully.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s ok that it bothers you and it&#39;s ok that it&#39;s not bothering your<br/>
kids.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of people have felt television and video game violence would<br/>
desensitize kids to actual violence.  I think we are and need to be<br/>
desensitized to general violence or we&#39;d never survive with our minds<br/>
intact.  I think it&#39;s instinctual self preservation to not be overly<br/>
alarmed by natural disasters in China (assuming we don&#39;t live in China)<br/>
or shooting sprees in Miami (long as it&#39;s not our neighborhood.) <br/>
<br/>
I think being desensitized to images of dead bodies on the news is<br/>
normal.  What are we going to do about that poor expired person now<br/>
anyway?  How long do we grieve over a lost person we don&#39;t know when our<br/>
lives are filled with living people who need us?  I think we&#39;d react with<br/>
the ordinary and appropriate amount of horror, sympathy and dread if we<br/>
found one on our front lawn.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids *are* far removed from violence and death.  They should be.  They<br/>
should not be in fear of it.  It should seem like impossible fantasy<br/>
stuff to them. <br/>
<br/>
I think a lot of parents hope their kids will be sensitive, caring people<br/>
and are afraid this enjoyment of violent video games or movies is a sign<br/>
they won&#39;t be.  It&#39;s not so much fear they&#39;ll be harmed by the images of<br/>
violence as concern liking it in the first place means something sinister<br/>
in their characters.  <br/>
<br/>
I think Dylan was around eight when he started playing games with<br/>
shooting and such.  By then he&#39;d seen bugs mashed on windshields and dead<br/>
birds in the yard and crunched critters by the side of the road. <br/>
We took care of my dad at home when he was dying of cancer, and Dylan sat<br/>
by his bed and read to him. <br/>
By eight he&#39;d already been exposed to a lot of death.  The stuff on video<br/>
games wasn&#39;t real and he knew it. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s so good at shooting games he could go to public school, but he&#39;s<br/>
kind and ethical and doesn&#39;t even swat mosquito&#39;s.   <br/>
<br/>
This is changing the subject some, but if I can&#39;t ease your mind about<br/>
loss of innocence maybe this will comfort you on some other level.   <br/>

Video-Game Killing Builds Visual Skills, Researchers Report<br/>
By SANDRA BLAKESLEE<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And now, the news that every parent dreads. Researchers are reporting<br/>
today that first-person-shooter video games 혰 the kind that require<br/>
players to kill or maim enemies or monsters that pop out of nowhere 혰<br/>
sharply improve visual attention skills. <br/>
<br/>
Experienced players of these games are 30 percent to 50 percent better<br/>
than nonplayers at taking in everything that happens around them,<br/>
according to the research, which appears today in the journal Nature.<br/>
They identify objects in their peripheral vision, perceiving numerous<br/>
objects without having to count them, switch attention rapidly and track<br/>
many items at once. <br/>
<br/>
Nor are players simply faster at these tasks, said Dr. Daphne Bavelier,<br/>
an associate professor of cognitive neuroscience at the University of<br/>
Rochester, who led the study. First-person action games increase the<br/>
brain&#39;s capacity to spread attention over a wide range of events. Other<br/>
types of action games, including those that focus on strategy or role<br/>
playing, do not produce the same effect. <br/>
<br/>
While some researchers have suggested possible links between video games<br/>
and other abilities, this study is thought to be the first to explore<br/>
their effects on visual skills. Though the number of subjects was small,<br/>
Dr. Bavelier said, the effects were too large to be a result of chance.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We were really surprised,&quot; Dr. Bavelier said, adding that as little as<br/>
10 hours of play substantially increased visual skills among novice<br/>
players. &quot;You get better at a lot of things, not just the game,&quot; she<br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
But Dr. Bavelier emphasized that the improved visual attention skills did<br/>
not translate to reading, writing and mathematics. Nor is it clear that<br/>
they lead to higher I.Q. scores, although visual attention and reaction<br/>
time are important components of many standardized tests. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Please, keep doing your homework,&quot; said Dr. Bavelier, the mother of<br/>
6-year-old twins and a 2-year-old. <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Jeremy Wolfe, the director of the Visual Attention Laboratory at<br/>
Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the study, said he was<br/>
intrigued at the idea that &quot;socially dubious games might improve<br/>
something like general intelligence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It might give every 14-year-old something to tell his parents,&quot; Dr.<br/>
Wolfe said. &quot; `Hey, don&#39;t make me study. Give me another grenade.&#39; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Still, he noted that an increased capacity for visual attention was<br/>
helpful in tasks as diverse as flying, driving, radiology and airport<br/>
screening.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Bavelier is an expert on how experience changes the brain,<br/>
particularly the effects of congenital deafness on visual skills and<br/>
attention. A few years ago, a Rochester student, Shawn Green, asked to<br/>
work on a senior project in her laboratory. They agreed that he would<br/>
help design visual attention tasks for the deaf.<br/>
<br/>
But when Mr. Green tried out the tests, he found they were ridiculously<br/>
easy, Dr. Bavelier said. So did his friends, who were all devoted to<br/>
video games. <br/>
<br/>
The professor and her student decided to study the connection between<br/>
video game playing and visual attention. They carried out four<br/>
experiments on undergraduates, all of them male because no female shooter<br/>
game fans could be found on campus.<br/>
<br/>
The first tested the ability to localize targets in a cluttered<br/>
environment and spread visual attention over a wide area 혰 a skill that<br/>
many elderly drivers lose. Gamers performed at least 50 percent better<br/>
than nongamers, Dr. Bavelier said.<br/>
<br/>
The second involved the ability to say, instantly, how many objects were<br/>
flashed on a screen. Most people can do this with up to four objects, Dr.<br/>
Bavelier said. Above that, they start counting. Gamers could identify up<br/>
to 10 items on a screen without counting. <br/>
<br/>
The other two experiments tested the players&#39; ability to process<br/>
fast-occurring visual information and to switch attention. Again, players<br/>
were far superior to nonplayers. <br/>
<br/>
A fifth experiment trained nonplayers, including some women, for 10<br/>
consecutive days on one of two video games 혰 either Medal of Honor:<br/>
Allied Assault, a first-person-shooter game that simulates World War II<br/>
combat situations, or the slower-moving puzzle game Tetris. Only the<br/>
shooter game improved visual attention, Dr. Bavelier said, and it did so<br/>
in both sexes. Among novices, the effects waned within a couple of<br/>
months, but superior visual attention skills seemed firmly rooted in game<br/>
addicts. <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Bavelier said the next step would be to tease the games apart to find<br/>
out what aspects promoted brain changes. Are violence and danger<br/>
necessary? Does this sort of brain plasticity change with age? Will it<br/>
affect certain measures of intelligence? <br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, she said, the military is already exploiting action games to<br/>
train special forces.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;To enter territory you&#39;ve never seen and detect where your enemies are,&quot;<br/>
she went on, &quot;you need an accurate understanding of the visual scene.&quot;</div>

Marty, who had never touched a real gun before earned &quot;Top Gun.&quot;  They used <br/>

electronic guns with recoil, but no bullets whatsoever) and paintball guns (which Marty <br/>
had done on one occasion, a couple of years ago, with his dad and brother).<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s experience to that point had been Duck Hunt, at which he&#39;s the best <br/>
in the house.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is honestly interested in police work.  He might change his mind, but <br/>
at the moment, guns and gore would be of more use to him than some other things <br/>
he could find an interest in.   (Come to think of it, a good friend of ours <br/>
is assistant district attorney in charge of violent crimes, and I might get him <br/>
to talk to Marty.)<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, Marty&#39;s more interested in tactical games lately and nothing <br/>
biological or physically dangerous.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is interesting and makes sense. But on another aspect, my area has had <br/>
a huge increase in teen traffic fatalities this year. Apparently the <br/>
traffic fatality rate is just about double what it was last year, and the <br/>
majority of them have been teens, with speed as a factor. (only sometimes <br/>
alcohol or road conditions)  People are shouting for all kinds of measures <br/>
such as lengthening (even further - it now takes 3 years for full <br/>
licensing) the graduated licensing system, speed governors (sp?) on new <br/>
drivers&#39; cars, bans on advertising really fast cars and, predictably, bans <br/>
on fast-driving video games.<br/>
<br/>
Now I can see that in some ways the games could improve driving ability <br/>
because of the ability to take in more visual data quickly. But are they <br/>
realistic enough in the actual driving techniques that they could improve <br/>
that as well? Or are they likely to produce cockiness in a new driver who <br/>
does well at them? Lars has never much used the N64 system he bought a few <br/>
years ago, so I really don&#39;t know. I&#39;m curious what the people whose kids <br/>
play these games think, especially since Lars is both a new learning driver <br/>
and thinking of buying a new game system.<br/>

There are several teens I know who are driving now.   One, female, has had an <br/>
accident.  She lives way out in the country, got sleepy at night, and <br/>
half-missed a turn.  Her dad&#39;s older Suburbanish or Ramchargerish thing (I just <br/>
remember it&#39;s raised up tank-like appearance &lt;g&gt;) went into a shallow place.  It <br/>
was hurt but she was not.<br/>
<br/>
Of the boys who play video games, Eric owns his own zippy red car; no <br/>
accidents and I&#39;ve always trusted him to drive my boys around.  Brett tends toward <br/>
trucks, and has had not the least scrape on a post.     Renee lost a tire, but <br/>
in a surprisingly safe place and it was a lack of experience changing tires, <br/>
not speed.  (Maybe there should be pitstop video games.)   Holly said the other <br/>
day that when she rides in the front seat with Kirby driving, he has never <br/>
scared her.  That&#39;s pretty good.  He has scared me a time or two, but it was just <br/>
from taking a turn a little too fast or too wide.  It was a matter of going <br/>
out of his lane a bit, not of rolling a car.  <br/>
<br/>
These kids are careful and they remind each other of things, and point out <br/>
oncoming this&#39;r&#39;that, pedestrians, etc. to each other.<br/>
<br/>
I think bravado, posturing and low self esteem will cause accidents before <br/>
video games ever will.  If a kid with those other problems also plays video <br/>
games, why will the parents want to BEGIN to analyze the role of their treatment <br/>
or the realities of school in why a sixteen year old boy would want to show off <br/>
for other kids?  They won&#39;t.  They&#39;ll blame the game.<br/>
<br/>
There are other regulars, mostly homeschoolers I could name, but either they <br/>
don&#39;t have their own regular vehicles or I haven&#39;t ridden with them.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Sadie (19) has her own truck, used to have a Volvo her mom gave her.  No <br/>
accidents, and she drives an hour or two at a time to get places (also lives <br/>
rurally).<br/>

they&#39;re better drivers than they really are? It sounds like not.<br/>
That was my only concern.<br/>
I think Lars is probably going to be a good driver. He&#39;s careful in <br/>
general. Even though he participates in extreme mountain biking, he tends <br/>
not to try things until he&#39;s pretty sure he can manage them. I&#39;ve seen some <br/>
very slight signs of over confidence in his driving so far, but nothing at <br/>
all major. When people make the usual comments about new teen drivers (in <br/>
his presence) I&#39;m going to tell them that he&#39;s too smart to treat a motor <br/>
vehicle like a toy. Hopefully that gets my message across.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, the crazy one with the van and shooting people that people complain <br/>
about so much.  Grand Theft Auto.  Eric is the one who owns it (the one with the <br/>
red car).   Holly&#39;s friends London and Romeo play it.   Crystal (who had the <br/>
accident) has one (a different one) at her house.  Her brother plays it most <br/>
but isn&#39;t driving yet.  (Holly is feeding me these details.)  Theirs talks about <br/>
hitting homeless people, but as Holly&#39;s quoting me that part it&#39;s clearly <br/>
humor.  Goofy humor.  <br/>
<br/>
Brett owns TONS of games (once he got a job, those were his first many <br/>
purchases, as he had been deprived before that) but I&#39;m not sure if he has one of <br/>
those.  The boys are off at a Lord of the Rings tournament so I can&#39;t ask.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty have borrowed or rented and played driving games, but haven&#39;t <br/>
bought them.    They like the long RPG games better.  Knights of the Old <br/>
Republic (I think?  Star Wars) and Prince of Persia and Zelda/Link stuff, where it <br/>
takes weeks to finish.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Even though he participates in extreme mountain biking, he tends <br/>
not to try things until he&#39;s pretty sure he can manage them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would think real involvement in dangerous motion-things would make a kid a <br/>
careful driver.  And he&#39;d be super careful of bicyclists, I think.  More aware.<br/>

You know, that&#39;s a good point and one I hadn&#39;t thought of. Paul has to requalify every three months with pistol, shotgun and M16 for the Coast Guard. He grew up hunting though, but often plays what I call &quot;shoot &#39;em up&quot; games. <br/>

I had never seen a real gun before boot camp, but qualified as marksman right off the bat. I never thought that all the time I played Duck Hunt or anything could have helped that....<br/>

My parents were both hunters and my dad had a small gun collection.  They <br/>
taught hunter safety a couple of years, and my friends thought they were great, <br/>
but I had no interest in guns.  I only shot a serious rifle one time, and did <br/>
NOT enjoy it (it was a 38, I think).  Outside a very little experience with <br/>
pellet guns and BBguns I had borrowed for a moment, I stayed away from guns, yet <br/>
I was around them (if that makes sense).<br/>
