&lt;&lt;  A mile of<br/>
<br/>
straight earth has always been a mile, we just invented a way to measure it.<br/>
<br/>
And we&#39;ve invented ways to play with that measurement. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I loved your post up to that point.<br/>
(No, I still loved it, I just had to say &quot;WAIT!!!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
A mile wasn&#39;t a mile until we (somebody, not us now) invented the ideas and <br/>
terminologies of measuring the ground.<br/>
<br/>
The other day Holly asked me if certain streets (on the gridlike new part of <br/>
town) were half a mile apart.  I said yes, they drew it on paper first, with <br/>
a ruler.<br/>
<br/>
Well what about the hills? she asked.   Did they take into account where the <br/>
ground went up and down?<br/>
<br/>
(For the benefit of those who know Albuquerque, we were at Tramway and <br/>
Montgomery, headed south and could see the intersections/lights at Comanche <br/>
and Candelaria, out in front of us, half a mile apart.)<br/>
<br/>
I said no, they were on paper, so it wasn&#39;t the same mile they would have had <br/>
if someone walked along rolling a rotary measuring tool.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there was a mile there before those roads were there.  And even <br/>
now, it&#39;s a questionable mile!! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, that was a burst of non-clarity on my part. I meant that the earth was<br/>
there, the whole mile of it was there, but we just didn&#39;t measure it or call<br/>
it a mile.<br/>

as a kid and haven&#39;t been back in a couple of decades. I&#39;d really like to<br/>
see it again now.<br/>
