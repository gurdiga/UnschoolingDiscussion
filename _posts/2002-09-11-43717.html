&lt;&lt;    Whether or not your Karma Sutra game does that, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
 I just assumed it was more of a *kinky* game not for Christians.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

That&#39;s the problem when one assumes. As one of my teachers said &quot;assume<br/>

making an ass out of u and me&quot; LOL<br/>
I suppose it depends on your definition of kinky.<br/>
I think it&#39;s an incredibly sensual game....very into communication, tender<br/>
touching and helps couple be not only creative, but more in touch with each<br/>
others feelings.<br/>
It&#39;s classy in my view, but you have to be very comfortable with your bodies<br/>
and talking openly about what you like.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to say it is a parents place to teach how to pleasure your<br/>

can be important aids in the process.<br/>

Subject: Unschoolers and college<br/>
<br/>
I have this link to a young lady&#39;s webpage that was unschooled her entire<br/>
life and chose college.<br/>
She ended up winning all sorts of awards, being on the deans list and such.<br/>
She&#39;s done with school for the time being, but you can contact her and read<br/>
a<br/>
bit about her if you go to her page.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/nikleba">http://www.geocities.com/nikleba</a><br/>
<br/>
So there is one example. Peter Kowalke recently wrote an article about a<br/>
girl<br/>
that unschooled her college, I think? I&#39;ll look in my recent HEM issues to<br/>
see if I can find it for you.<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion is that unschoolers are going to be a LOT more creative<br/>
in regards to getting the knowledge and training they need for whatever they<br/>
do in this life.<br/>
If college becomes interesting/important to them, they&#39;ll do great at it.<br/>
I suppose many will become entrepreuners too.<br/>
It&#39;s going to be interesting to see what route my kids go...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I still don&#39;t have rules.  But I fear I&#39;ve done as much damage in talking<br/>
&gt; about this being less nutritious than that as my friends did in having all<br/>
&gt; those rules.  How do others handle these kinds of issues?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Slowly stop buying the products that you don&#39;t approve of (or suddenly<br/>
stop buying them!).  We have, over the past 6 years, become very<br/>
conscious in what foods we put in our mouths.  In the store and at home,<br/>
I talk to my kids about what different foods do to our bodies.<br/>
Different foods make us feel differently.  I should stress the *us* in<br/>
that sentence, because some people seem to be able to eat anything and<br/>
everything to no ill effect (lucky bums!).  Anyway, sugar makes us need<br/>
to use the restroom more frequently.  Lack of protein makes us starving<br/>
lunatics.  Lack of fiber makes us constipated.  I could go on.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (only 6) knows that it is good to eat when you are hungry, but<br/>
to not eat when you aren&#39;t hungry.  She has understood this her whole<br/>
life.  I breastfed her on demand as a baby and she feeds herself on<br/>
demand now.  She understands her bodies cues.  If only we all did!  (I&#39;m<br/>
still relearning my own body cues.)<br/>
<br/>
As for unhealthy ingredients (partially hydrogenated oils, etc.), if you<br/>
don&#39;t buy it, they can&#39;t eat vast quantities of it (while they are<br/>
little).  We buy lots of snack foods in this household, but my 6 yo<br/>
would rather have a piece of fruit.  The inevitable goldfish cracker (or<br/>
whatever) will show up around other people (Grandparents, Girl Scouts,<br/>
etc.) and I don&#39;t forbid it and I usually have a few myself, but we have<br/>
discussed it and consider those foods to be foods that are only eaten<br/>
once in a while (and not every day).  I &quot;forced&quot; my infants/toddlers to<br/>
have a vegetarian diet, but as soon as my 6 yo started asking about<br/>
foods that other people were eating, we allowed her to make that choice<br/>
herself (at first she thought that it was a joke that people ate meat,<br/>
she just couldn&#39;t fathom someone wanting to eat a chicken).  She has<br/>
chosen vegetarianism on her own and should she change her mind I will<br/>
voice my opinions, but it is her life ultimately.  (And I won&#39;t shame<br/>
her, afterall I ate all meats until just before she was born)<br/>
<br/>
It is our responsibility as parents to let our children know how we feel<br/>
about various issues, whether that be food, religion, schooling, or<br/>
whatever.  We cannot force our children to have the same views, but they<br/>
should be aware of why we are living the way we are (they have a right<br/>
to know what makes us tick!).  I don&#39;t lecture my kids, but they see me<br/>
looking at bags in the grocery store and ask what it is that I am<br/>
looking for and I tell them and they help find the alternatives that are<br/>
the healthiest for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that my children are at a huge food advantage over myself.  I<br/>
truly had no idea what a healthy diet looked like as a child and most<br/>
children nowadays still don&#39;t.  It is a shame since that information is<br/>
so readily available.  Funny story:  kids and adults were talking about<br/>
Ding-Dongs and Ho-Hos and Twinkies in front of my daughter.  She asked<br/>
what they were and we told her, she thought that it might be fun to try<br/>
them sometime.  So, next time we saw them in the store, we bought some.<br/>
She tried a bit of each and about gagged.  She thought the Twinkie<br/>
tasted like air and the Ho-Ho and Ding-Dong tasted like plastic.  She<br/>
wonders why anyone would want to eat things with virtually no flavor and<br/>
she immediately stopped eating them.  DH and I, however, remember how<br/>
these were the best food in our childhoods (and how they were rationed<br/>
out and made out to be SO GOOD).<br/>

Hi Mary, it&#39;s probably not relevant to you in the US but our organisation<br/>
here called Australian Vaccination Network has a website www.avn.org.au  and<br/>
they will sell you a conscientious objector pack which is what we need to do<br/>
here. It may have helpful ideas in for you. It&#39;s a terrible fear to live<br/>
with that by doing what you believe to be right you may lose the ones that<br/>
you are working so hard to protect. I send you a &quot;spirit link&quot; to the<br/>
universal parents of all places and ages who I call upon whenever I need<br/>
parenting help of the most dire kind. They have helped me frequently. All<br/>
the best to you in your difficulties.<br/>

Subject: siblings<br/>

Mine are also  4.5 yrs apart - now 5 and 9. I agree that this is a tough age<br/>
gap because their interests are so different, and reading out loud is<br/>
especially difficult because of varying interests and attention spans.<br/>
However, mine have become very good friends -- the older guy is a<br/>
responsible older brother, the younger one prefers his company to anyone<br/>
else&#39;s, and they love to play games together (video, cards, imaginary,<br/>
chasing, etc.).<br/>
<br/>
It is really hard to feel like you don&#39;t have time for what everyone needs.<br/>
That includes kids, husband and coworkers. To say nothing of oneself --<br/>
another topic altogether. I  have had to make what once seemed like major<br/>
compromises. When I worked at night, I used to read stories at breakfast<br/>
because I wasn&#39;t home at bedtime. Today, by the time work and dinner were<br/>
over, it was dark, but the guys wanted to go to the park so we went, in the<br/>
dark. (It was fun -- we had it to ourselves.) Their dad is home with them<br/>
during the day, but of course since I&#39;ve been gone all day, there&#39;s a<br/>
thundering race to the front door when they hear my key in the lock and then<br/>
a wrestling match to see who can hug me first (the upside of a job outside<br/>
the house!).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should feel bad about giving one less attention if the<br/>
other needs more for the moment. It balances out over time. The reality is<br/>
that people have to satisfy their own needs sometimes and often must wait<br/>
for what they need. The family is an organic unit and parts  must always<br/>
accommodate each other.<br/>
<br/>
And the younger child makes up for less parental attention with all that<br/>
sibling attention. They learn a lot from their older siblings.<br/>
<br/>
Our younger child has definitely gotten less of the concentrated attention<br/>
than his older sibling did. I can&#39;t say he&#39;s worse off for it. He&#39;s learned<br/>
to find things to do on his own and he&#39;s much more self-sufficient and<br/>
easy-going than our older one, who always seemed to need someone to help him<br/>
figure out how to keep busy.<br/>

Subject: food choices<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to add something about the whole food issue. Just in case anyone<br/>
is wondering about the choices their children are making.<br/>
<br/>
Tara, my oldest was a great eater as a baby. She ate everything put in front<br/>
of her, veggies and whatever it was. When she turned 2, it was like a<br/>
different child. Within a week, she cut out all meat to only meatballs.<br/>
Within the next month after that, she cut out just about everything else she<br/>
ate. She cut out milk, meat of any kind, veggies except for corn, fruit<br/>
except for baby peaches. (I mean baby food) She started to survive on french<br/>
fries, spaghettio&#39;s without the meatballs, pasta with sauce and no meat in<br/>
the sauce. Lunches were a chore as she was going to school. From the 2nd<br/>
grade up to last year, (she&#39;s almost 17)she took peanut butter and jelly to<br/>
school every day of her life. When she was young, I thought it was phase.<br/>
Whn I realized it was going to be a very long one, I let her go. What was I<br/>
going to do, force food into her?? I would feed her before going anywhere<br/>
else to eat like someone&#39;s house and even would send her with food if she<br/>
went visiting. Very gradually she started to add some things on her own. She<br/>
started with chicken tenders from BK and went from there.<br/>
<br/>
Now she can eat out at any restuarant and manages quite well. She added some<br/>
veggies and fruit along the way. She doesn&#39;t &quot;pig out&quot; on snacks, drinks<br/>
only water and ice tea, and has even gone as far as to eat steak now. The<br/>
only other meat from chicken she&#39;ll touch. Doesn&#39;t eat any kind of seafood<br/>
at all. Point is it all worked for her. Even though she&#39;s a school kid,<br/>
she&#39;s healthier than most I know. Most of the time, the whole house can<br/>
catch a cold and she gets nothing. So it certainly hasn&#39;t hurt her any and<br/>
we&#39;ve saved countless hours of fighting over nothing.<br/>

&gt;Gosh, that&#39;s how I feel about it too :) How do you (the universal you) feel<br/>
&gt;about your kids using it (or other such words for that matter)? For us, if<br/>
&gt;they us the words *in context* and not as a slur, or insult, then we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;okay with them saying them. Oddly enough, it *very* rare for them to use<br/>
&gt;swear words anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And how old are your kids? My 16 year old is like that and we&#39;re okay with<br/>
it, as long as it&#39;s not in front of the little ones. The little ones hear<br/>
some in movies and know it&#39;s not something they use. If they hear the word<br/>
shit from anyone, which is mostly daddy, they make him pay a dollar. Not<br/>
sure where this came from, maybe something on TV. I would feel uncomfortable<br/>
hearing my 6 year old use the word shit or anything else without saying it<br/>
was a word she heard or asked what it meant. But for the 6 and 7 year olds<br/>
to actually talk that way right now, would make me feel uneasy.<br/>

&gt;Hi Mary, it&#39;s probably not relevant to you in the US but our organisation<br/>

because<br/>
I don&#39;t make a fuss over it, my kids see it as no big deal and as such they<br/>
don&#39;t cuss too much either. Although the other day, Moly dropped a heavy<br/>
book<br/>
on her foot, tripped over it, fell and hit her elbow on the side of the<br/>
coffee table. She said f*** very loudly and began to cry. Darin called out<br/>
from the computer room and asked if she was okay, and then said &quot;Did she<br/>
just<br/>
say what I though she said!&quot; Jack said, &quot;Yeah Dad, Moly said f***!&quot; The<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mary - that&#39;s exactly what I was thinking. Maybe you can try to catch him<br/>
having self-control and point THAT out to him, so you&#39;re supporting what he<br/>
IS able to do rather than focusing on the times he blows it.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing -- when he DOES blow it, I&#39;d assume he feels bad about doing<br/>
so<br/>
and I&#39;d comfort him specifically for that. If you punish him in some way,<br/>
he&#39;s going to feel punished for something he didn&#39;t actually have control<br/>
over and that is going to just add to the pressure on him when he&#39;s next<br/>
faced with a similar situation.<br/>
<br/>
Try to articulate reasons why it isn&#39;t acceptable behavior- go deep, beyond<br/>
just that it isn&#39;t nice. What is it about hitting that is so bad? What<br/>
feelings is he having when he hits? I&#39;d bet on &quot;frustation&quot; --- notice<br/>
frustration happening in stories you&#39;re reading -- use the word<br/>
&quot;frustration&quot;<br/>
as in &quot;Wow, so-and-so was probably really frustrated when his freckle juice<br/>
didn&#39;t work &lt;G&gt;, what would you do if that happened to you?  --- make up<br/>
stories together about frustrations that happen to kids, make it only thinly<br/>
veiled about him - use his name, even. Let HIM finish the stories<br/>
sometimes -<br/>
and don&#39;t cringe if he finishes them violently on occasion.<br/>

Curfew<br/>

Trust<br/>
If she has done some things in the past that makes you not feel trustful,<br/>
that needs to be addressed seperately. A curfew is just an arbitrary time<br/>
that doesn&#39;t prevent anything &quot;bad&quot; from happening. I know for a fact that<br/>
kids have sex in the afternoon, smoke pot in the basement at 7:30 pm and<br/>
drink beer at the river while their parent&#39;s think they are at the Library<br/>
doing homework. My high school best friend had the earliest curfew of us all<br/>

Don&#39;t you all think this web site and also Pam S. post Digest Number 2357,<br/>
regarding her experience with college and unschooling would be great<br/>
material for those doubting in-laws, friends and such.  I know Pam&#39;s post is<br/>
going up on my fridge for my ps teaching inlaws to read.<br/>
Also thought I&#39;d mention that my dh is coming around to our thinking, he is<br/>
now sounding like me(to his dad).  They were eating dinner last night and<br/>
his father brought up the old socializing thing and dh asked him to think<br/>
back to his own school days.  I think it really hit a chord with him.<br/>
People always jump on the socializing bit when they hear hs.  But I think<br/>
its because its the only thing they know of to ask.  I love pointing out<br/>
that all the kids are told that they aren&#39;t supposed to socialize in school.<br/>
That my kids get to do more socializing!  I was just so excited to hear my<br/>
dh be excited about our unschooling!!!<br/>
OK,  now this might be a stupid question but would anyone feel like<br/>
informing me on some abbreviations?  I&#39;ve been reading posts for many months<br/>
now and still don&#39;t know what the d stands for in dh, dd, ds, and don&#39;t know<br/>
alot of other abbreviations.  Thanks to anyone who has the time to explain<br/>
these to me.<br/>

My personal opinion is that unschoolers are going to be a LOT more creative<br/>
in regards to getting the knowledge and training they need for whatever they<br/>
do in this life.<br/>
If college becomes interesting/important to them, they&#39;ll do great at it.<br/>
I suppose many will become entrepreuners too.<br/>
It&#39;s going to be interesting to see what route my kids go...<br/>

<br/>
Thank you Lisa for this post,  I am constantly struggling with the food<br/>
issue in our family.  I am just now at 34 figuring out my body signs.<br/>
Because my upbringing was like yours, the dessert was for good behavior or<br/>
eating everything.  And I feel like I&#39;ve been on a diet my whole like(which<br/>
is a whole &#39;nother post).  But I think its because I was never allowed to<br/>
eat on queu with my own hunger.  Had to fit into my mothers schedule.  I am<br/>
also going to stop buying certain things, my problem is when dh goes<br/>
shopping.  He likes a &#39;good&#39; deal, so when he finds the cheap sugared<br/>
cereals on sale, he goes crazy.  And my kids and he will eat it for<br/>
breakfast and  1 hour later they are starving maniacs, so they eat some<br/>
white bread or something else sugary(sp).  Duhhhh,  I have to try and help<br/>
them see how this kind-of eating makes us feel.  I would easily be a veg. if<br/>
I could only have a good enough arsenal of recipes to fix for my fam.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Slowly stop buying the products that you don&#39;t approve of (or suddenly<br/>
stop buying them!).  We have, over the past 6 years, become very<br/>
conscious in what foods we put in our mouths.  In the store and at home,<br/>
I talk to my kids about what different foods do to our bodies.<br/>
Different foods make us feel differently.  I should stress the *us* in<br/>
that sentence, because some people seem to be able to eat anything and<br/>
everything to no ill effect (lucky bums!).  Anyway, sugar makes us need<br/>
to use the restroom more frequently.  Lack of protein makes us starving<br/>
lunatics.  Lack of fiber makes us constipated.  I could go on.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest (only 6) knows that it is good to eat when you are hungry, but<br/>
to not eat when you aren&#39;t hungry.  She has understood this her whole<br/>
life.  I breastfed her on demand as a baby and she feeds herself on<br/>
demand now.  She understands her bodies cues.  If only we all did!  (I&#39;m<br/>
still relearning my own body cues.)<br/>
<br/>
As for unhealthy ingredients (partially hydrogenated oils, etc.), if you<br/>
don&#39;t buy it, they can&#39;t eat vast quantities of it (while they are<br/>
little).  We buy lots of snack foods in this household, but my 6 yo<br/>
would rather have a piece of fruit.  The inevitable goldfish cracker (or<br/>
whatever) will show up around other people (Grandparents, Girl Scouts,<br/>
etc.) and I don&#39;t forbid it and I usually have a few myself, but we have<br/>
discussed it and consider those foods to be foods that are only eaten<br/>
once in a while (and not every day).  I &quot;forced&quot; my infants/toddlers to<br/>
have a vegetarian diet, but as soon as my 6 yo started asking about<br/>
foods that other people were eating, we allowed her to make that choice<br/>
herself (at first she thought that it was a joke that people ate meat,<br/>
she just couldn&#39;t fathom someone wanting to eat a chicken).  She has<br/>
chosen vegetarianism on her own and should she change her mind I will<br/>
voice my opinions, but it is her life ultimately.  (And I won&#39;t shame<br/>
her, afterall I ate all meats until just before she was born)<br/>
<br/>
It is our responsibility as parents to let our children know how we feel<br/>
about various issues, whether that be food, religion, schooling, or<br/>
whatever.  We cannot force our children to have the same views, but they<br/>
should be aware of why we are living the way we are (they have a right<br/>
to know what makes us tick!).  I don&#39;t lecture my kids, but they see me<br/>
looking at bags in the grocery store and ask what it is that I am<br/>
looking for and I tell them and they help find the alternatives that are<br/>
the healthiest for all of us.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that my children are at a huge food advantage over myself.  I<br/>
truly had no idea what a healthy diet looked like as a child and most<br/>
children nowadays still don&#39;t.  It is a shame since that information is<br/>
so readily available.  Funny story:  kids and adults were talking about<br/>
Ding-Dongs and Ho-Hos and Twinkies in front of my daughter.  She asked<br/>
what they were and we told her, she thought that it might be fun to try<br/>
them sometime.  So, next time we saw them in the store, we bought some.<br/>
She tried a bit of each and about gagged.  She thought the Twinkie<br/>
tasted like air and the Ho-Ho and Ding-Dong tasted like plastic.  She<br/>
wonders why anyone would want to eat things with virtually no flavor and<br/>
she immediately stopped eating them.  DH and I, however, remember how<br/>
these were the best food in our childhoods (and how they were rationed<br/>
out and made out to be SO GOOD).<br/>

Subject: Autism (was different children)<br/>
<br/>
Autism is a spectrum disorder - meaning that the symptoms have a<br/>
wide range of severity.  The extent to which a person with autism<br/>
is able to function in typical surroundings can vary from being<br/>
entirely dependent on supports for all activities of daily living<br/>
to the weird computer geek down the street.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Non verbal kids with autism definitely need early intervention,<br/>
because autism frequently leads to explosive behavior if the kids<br/>
can&#39;t communicate.  Other than the non-verbal kids or the ones<br/>
with such deficits that they need tube feeding, diapers, and the<br/>
like, separating them from the mainstream of life has never been<br/>
demonstrated to benefit the kid (although it does keep folks from<br/>
seeing weird kids).<br/>
<br/>
Rather than addressing the issue globally (&quot;I think your kids has<br/>
a disability&quot;) how about more specific bits and see how it goes:<br/>
&quot;I was uncomfortable that Jane wandered away from where we were<br/>
and went into another part of the house; you might want to expose<br/>
her to more social setting so she can pick up those cues<br/>
asily.&quot;  -or- &quot;It seemed like Jane had a hard time settling down<br/>
to play &#39;with&#39; Mary and Sue, why don&#39;t we go to the park and see<br/>
if they interact more easily when there are fewer distractions of<br/>
an unfamiliar place.&quot;  Lots of folks seem to have great social<br/>
skills hard wired into them, but tips and techniques can help the<br/>
rest of us, LOL.<br/>

|<br/>
| &gt;&gt;The autistic child wouldn&#39;t have been in the normal range for<br/>
his age in<br/>
| the &quot;your seven year old&quot; books, but because my kids were aware<br/>
that there<br/>
| are some things younger kids are still not good at and they<br/>
were able to<br/>
| treat him as being at an earlier developmental stage, it worked<br/>
out.&gt;&gt;<br/>
|<br/>
|<br/>
|<br/>
| Now that this has been brought up, I have another question.<br/>
What a<br/>
| shocker!!!<br/>
| My kids also have no problem with children that are different<br/>
in so far any<br/>
| kind of way they have encounterd. Autistic, special needs or<br/>
CP. I had a<br/>
| fellow homeschooler come over to our house for a day of play<br/>
and swimming.<br/>
| She has a 6year old daughter that my daughter was thrilled to<br/>
meet. Most her<br/>
| age are boys in our group. I hadn&#39;t remembered this child but<br/>
for once at a<br/>
| park when she was 4. At that time I did notice she was happier<br/>
to be alone<br/>
| but when the mother said she was immature for age, I never<br/>
thought twice<br/>
| about it. She just seemed like she wasn&#39;t into playing with<br/>
other kids at<br/>
| that time.<br/>
|<br/>
| Well as soon as the mother and daughter walked into my house, I<br/>
knew there<br/>
| was something different. At the end of our play day, the mother<br/>
and daughter<br/>
| had fun, I was uncomfortable and my kids really didn&#39;t seem<br/>
different aside<br/>
| from the fact that they had no one to play with when they<br/>
thought they were<br/>
| going to. The child to me, as far as the info I have which<br/>
isn&#39;t much, seems<br/>
| slightly autistic. She doesn&#39;t interact at all with anyone. She<br/>
talks but<br/>
| not to anyone, not the kids or me or even her mom. She never<br/>
makes eye<br/>
| contact and just goes very quickly from one thing to another<br/>
like no one<br/>
| else is around. It was a bit uncomfortable for me because her<br/>
mother doesn&#39;t<br/>
| really watch her as if there is a problem. (my mother has a<br/>
connecting MIL<br/>
| quarters to our house and this little girl just walked right in<br/>
never saying<br/>
| a word and went into my mother&#39;s bedroom for awhile and then<br/>
just left) I<br/>
| found this out later. I&#39;ve never had any child, whether<br/>
schoooled or not go<br/>
| through my house like that. So I had to watch her and make<br/>
comments when she<br/>
| did what we don&#39;t do here in the house. Like push people and<br/>
grab things<br/>
| from others and so on.<br/>
|<br/>
| My kids tried to play with her but it just wasn&#39;t possible.<br/>
They had nothing<br/>
| to say other than she seemed to not like them. The mother gives<br/>
no<br/>
| indication at all that she sees a problem. She just says being<br/>
an only<br/>
| child, that the girl is immature. Now the only autistic<br/>
children I know go<br/>
| to special classes daily. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s the best thing<br/>
or not but I<br/>
| can&#39;t help but wonder that maybe this child could benefit from<br/>
some other<br/>
| type of help the mother isn&#39;t giving. The mother unschools in<br/>
as far as I<br/>
| know of, only not having work to do. I know nothing else of how<br/>
she is with<br/>
| the child.<br/>
|<br/>
| Do I say something to this mother? She frequently calls me for<br/>
advice and<br/>
| marvles at how I do it with 4 kids and thanks me greatly for<br/>
suggestions I<br/>
| have made that help her. Now I see things differently and<br/>
realize why she<br/>
| seems to need help with things. Not usre if it&#39;s for me to say<br/>
something or<br/>
| what I would exactly say.<br/>

If you aren&#39;t sure what message someone is replying to, go to the<br/>
messages on yahoo, and click threads.  It will sort everything by<br/>
threads so you can see where everything started.  What I do is click<br/>
on the message that I want to see, then go back to the message index<br/>
and then click thread.  Then I don&#39;t have to go all over the place<br/>
looking for the thread I want, it&#39;s right there.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Hi Mary, it&#39;s probably not relevant to you in the US but our<br/>
organisation<br/>
&gt; &gt;here called Australian Vaccination Network has a website<br/>
www.avn.org.au<br/>
&gt; &gt;and they will sell you a conscientious objector pack which is what<br/>
we need<br/>
&gt; &gt;to do here. It may have helpful ideas in for you. It&#39;s a terrible<br/>
fear to<br/>
&gt; &gt;live with that by doing what you believe to be right you may lose<br/>
the ones<br/>
&gt; &gt;that you are working so hard to protect. I send you a &quot;spirit<br/>
link&quot; to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;universal parents of all places and ages who I call upon whenever<br/>
I need<br/>
&gt; &gt;parenting help of the most dire kind. They have helped me<br/>
frequently. All<br/>
