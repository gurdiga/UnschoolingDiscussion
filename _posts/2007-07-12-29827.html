<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464750796">I had emailed Sandra this question:In one of your posts you said that<br/>
you thought it was evil for<br/>
parents to charge their adult children &quot;rent&quot; or board for remaining<br/>
at home.<br/>
Why?-=-<br/>
Sandra replied:<br/>
It penalizes them for growing up, for having a birthday.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her because I read in one of her posts that she thought it was<br/>
evil that some parents will charge their children &quot;room and board&quot; or<br/>
&quot;rent&quot; when they reach an *adult* age.<br/>
 It happened to me when i turned 18yo.<br/>
 I had to get a job and pay my parents a certain amount each week.<br/>
Even tho i agree with Sandra, i had to know the &quot;why&quot; behind her<br/>
statement...in order for me to learn. I would like to hear from others<br/>
too what they think.<br/>
I know my son will never have to leave home or pay me when he turns is<br/>
older.Now, what i can hear people (mainstream) people saying about her<br/>
reply is....well, kids HAVE to grow up sometime and learn adult<br/>
responsibilitys(sp)! What would you say to people who come back with that?<br/>
thanks,Heather</div>

<br/>
They have responsibilities when they leave their parent&#39;s homes and  <br/>
have to pay rent and utilities.<br/>
<br/>
Pretending, at home, is an exercise, a drill, &quot;practice.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Charging kids rent is pretend. It can look the same. The parents  <br/>
might even kick the kid out if they don&#39;t pay. But the parents are  <br/>
*choosing* to ask for rent. (And choosing to kick the kid out.) They  <br/>
could just as easily not ask for rent. Is the kid taking up a room  <br/>
that was previously rented? When the kid leaves, are they going to  <br/>
advertise and rent the room out to someone else? The only reason  <br/>
they&#39;re asking for rent is because the kid turned 18.<br/>
<br/>
Not so with a landlord. You can&#39;t get an apartment without paying rent.<br/>
<br/>
Same with tying allowance to chores. It&#39;s not the same as having a  <br/>
job. It&#39;s pretend. The parents aren&#39;t a company where their income  <br/>
depends on their employees&#39; output. The parents have the money  <br/>
already, regardless of what the child does. They could just hand it  <br/>
to the kid. But they choose to make the kid jump through a hoop to  <br/>
get it.<br/>
<br/>
Psychologically a totally different situation and it&#39;s why kids don&#39;t  <br/>
act like employees who have freely chosen a job knowing they could go  <br/>
find another job at any point. Because they aren&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did that help you generous or helpful to your parents?  I doubt much <br/>
that it did.  If we are able to support our daughters until they <br/>
decide to leave home, then I think we should do that.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 yo, is already very generous with her allowance, and I don&#39;t <br/>
see that changing.  If she were 18, working, earning money, I could <br/>
see her sharing her money with us.  She&#39;s just like that.  It <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be expected or asked for, she would just do it because we <br/>
have been generous with her, so she is in turn generous.<br/>
<br/>
If I expected her to share her money, she wouldn&#39;t graciously share <br/>
it.  She gets money every month, and spends some of it on her sister <br/>
all the time.  Her sister gets money and generously shares hers too.  <br/>
When one runs out, the other shares.  It&#39;s really nice!  If I made <br/>
one or the other share their money, they would likely try to hide it <br/>
from me, or keep it to themselves, holding on tight, knowing it could <br/>
be taken away.<br/>
<br/>
Those ideas about money being freely shared, even when there isn&#39;t <br/>
much to go around, have had a huge impact on our kids.  I imagine, <br/>
that either one of them would graciously share money with their <br/>
parents wether it was needed or not.<br/>
<br/>
Making an 18 yo pay rent just seems mean to me, given that we have <br/>
been sharing all along.  I would much rather see my kids have the <br/>
opportunity to save up money in their young adult hood, for eventual <br/>
moving out or buying a house or whatnot.  That would be a nice <br/>
blessing that I could give them.</div>

<br/>
My kids went to a concert in another town today, Marty and Holly.   <br/>
Warped Tour, in Las Cruces, a four hour trip.  It&#39;s a little less if  <br/>
they speed, which Marty did, unfortunately, and he wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
gotten a ticket if Keith had signed the registration.  So Keith will  <br/>
probably pay that ticket, because the police officer said she  <br/>
would&#39;ve given Marty a warning only, but the unsigned registration  <br/>
tipped the balance.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the story I started to tell, but I think it counts, here.   <br/>
I knew that story because I called to see how Holly was.  They were  <br/>
in the town but not at the concert yet, when I called.  I heard  <br/>
several stories, and the four people there (Holly&#39;s 13 year old  <br/>
friend and Marty&#39;s 22 year old friend, too; Sadie, a friend of the  <br/>
whole family)...  the four were laughing and joking, and Holly did  <br/>
feel better.  She&#39;s been feverish and sore-throatish.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
At one point they were planning to stay overnight, when we thought  <br/>
the concert would end late.  I offered to pay all or some of the cost  <br/>
of the motel room.  The two older kids (who are going because Holly  <br/>
wanted to see Cute is What We Aim For and wanted to be taken there)  <br/>
said they could cover it.  Holly said she would put in up to a half,  <br/>
for her and her friend.<br/>
<br/>
They could have taken my money, but they didn&#39;t.  I gave Marty my  <br/>
debit card and said to use it in case of emergency or car repair need.<br/>
<br/>
Before they left, we were up and Kirby hadn&#39;t gone to sleep yet (they  <br/>
got up at 6:00 to leave at 7:00, and Kirby works until 3:00 a.m.).   <br/>
He and Marty and I were talking about what video game systems he&#39;s  <br/>
talking with him when he moves in August.   He&#39;s leaving the X-Box,  <br/>
which he and Marty bought together.  He&#39;s taking the original  <br/>
Playstation, which Marty bought with his own money.  Marty has a  <br/>
Playstation 2, also, so doesn&#39;t mind Kirby taking the older one.    <br/>
Kirby will take the Wii, which he bought himself, and some of the  <br/>
game cube games (which they told me will play on the Wii).  There was  <br/>
no unhappiness and no arguing in the whole conversation.  It was very  <br/>
friendly and pleasant, and I was impressed.<br/>
<br/>
 From my own childhood I remember lots of resentment, argument,  <br/>
crying, deprivation, parents telling kids to shut up, kids telling  <br/>
other kids &quot;It&#39;s not fair...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Being generous with our kids seems to have made us generous.<br/>
<br/>
Holly bought all the tickets with money she made babysitting, last  <br/>
spring.   The two older kids paid her back.  The mom of the other  <br/>
girl said she/mom wasn&#39;t going to pay for this concert, the girl  <br/>
would have to.  The girl babysits lots, but doesn&#39;t get paid.  The  <br/>
tickets were $37.50.  Meals are, say $5 each.  Part of a motel would  <br/>
be $15 to $25.  Gasoline?  Marty will probably just pay for that.<br/>
<br/>
The girl&#39;s mom gave her $20.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing this wasn&#39;t going to be forthcoming from the other family, an  <br/>
adult friend of all involved gave Holly the price of that concert  <br/>
ticket as a birthday gift to the other girl.  I don&#39;t know if the  <br/>
other mom knows.   The girl got $50 for her birthday, and her mom  <br/>
told her she could not take it to the concert, but had to spend it on  <br/>
clothes.<br/>
<br/>
All around us my kids see other families handle money in arbitrary  <br/>
and seemingly vindictive ways.<br/>
<br/>
I see the good results of avoiding those bad decisions (or those bad  <br/>
follow-the-crowd lack-of-thought &quot;decisions&quot;).<br/>

My daughter&#39;s boyfriend is 16 and just graduated from high school.   Very <br/>
mainstream family...curfews that seem to change depending on the mom&#39;s  mood, <br/>
lots of rules and it has been quite unsettling for my daughter.  <br/>
 <br/>
His family expects him to move out in August because he has graduated from  <br/>
high school.  He skipped a couple of grades so I can just imagine he&#39;s  wishing <br/>
he hadn&#39;t now.  He could have at least stayed home a couple more  years.  I <br/>
don&#39;t really know the whole story but I just am so sad for  him.  I can&#39;t <br/>
imagine an 18 year old much less a 16 year old having to deal  with this.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids both know that they can live at home until they are ready to leave  <br/>
and they are welcome back at any time for as many times as they want.  This  is <br/>
their home as well as my home.<br/>

It&#39;s not that Kirby is Kirby (well, in some ways it *is* ::g::) -- his<br/>
actions, his perspective, who-he-is and how he is not afraid to share<br/>
himself, comes directly from having the relationship he does with his<br/>
family. It irks me when folks write off a kid with a good relationship with<br/>
their folks as a rarity and yet do *nothing* to inspire that kind of bond<br/>
with their own-- in fact, most work hard to do quite the opposite.<br/>
Not just the parents who miss out, the rest of us (adults who are written<br/>
off as *just like my folks*) do, too!<br/>

We said OK we&#39;d get a camper to travel (our dream retirement)  and he could have the house - <br/>

&quot;Free ride&quot; sounds bad, too.  Whose phrase is that?   How is that you  <br/>
come to resent a gift?<br/>
<br/>
And I believe the writing above refers wholly to a &quot;school kid&quot;-- <br/>
someone who went to school, and then college, and then (seemingly,  <br/>
from this... ) ...   but wait.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think now that if I had been<br/>
transitioned into paying my own bills gradually over time, it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been so bad. I struggled with &quot;adulthood&quot; for many years before I<br/>
actually took full financial responsibility for myself. I think this<br/>
could have been avoided.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is someone resentful because of the effects of school, I think,  <br/>
and of traditional parenting.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Struggled into &#39;adulthood&#39;&quot; can&#39;t begin to apply to the grown  <br/>
unschoolers I know.  They have had the opportunity to have  <br/>
responsibilities since they were young.  Not &quot;given responsibilities&quot;  <br/>
as practice or training, not false responsibilities, but real, that  <br/>
they chose themselves, when they wanted to, that they worked with on  <br/>
smaller scales.<br/>
<br/>
People communicate more with their words than they mean to, very often.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ll post a different way, next time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950370308">-=-Ok, so what about other bills incurred by your teen living at  <br/>
home? -=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids have lived at home since they were born.  Sometimes they took  <br/>
classes (ice skating, karate, dance, theatre), and sometimes they had  <br/>
expensive hobbies they couldn&#39;t afford on their allowance.  We could  <br/>
have said no, but we were actively and consciously trying to provide  <br/>
a rich environment in which they could grow up and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Because we had NONE of the school expenses (meal plan, uniforms, art  <br/>
fees, lab fees, field trip costs, new notebooks every year or twice a  <br/>
year, brand-name clothes to impress the other kids), that money was  <br/>
freed up to be used for REALLY good learning opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
There was no point at which we thought &quot;Okay, NOW you&#39;re done  <br/>
learning, and we don&#39;t have to provide you with diddly.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As a reminder, my kids are 15, 18 and 20.<br/>
As a reminder, they were once 1, 4 and 6.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Should you also pay for their car insurance...-=-<br/>
<br/>
We chose (didn&#39;t &quot;should&quot; and didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot;) to pay for insurance.<br/>
When Kirby started driving, he was driving himself to work and karate  <br/>
(where he studied and also taught).  I had to drive him before that.   <br/>
When he could drive, he drove.  He also delivered his brother and  <br/>
sister to places they needed to be sometimes.  This was a service to  <br/>
the family group, to the system we had been developing for years.  He  <br/>
was learning to drive in short, safe trips to familiar places.  That  <br/>
practice was very, very good, and I&#39;m sure saved him lots of grief  <br/>
and money, as he&#39;s never had an accident short of a rear-ending when  <br/>
the others fled the scene, and hitting a concrete bumper at work  <br/>
(gently).   So that practice is good for his safety and his overall  <br/>
lifetime automotive costs.  It&#39;s safer for other people&#39;s kids and  <br/>
families that our kids have gotten lots of good, safe practice.<br/>
<br/>
  -=-...and gas (for the car you bought for them)?-=-<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t buy any cars for our kids specifically, though if we had  <br/>
more money we cheerfully would have.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I have usually had three automobiles between us, since we  <br/>
met in our early 20&#39;s.  After Kirby was driving and Marty was  <br/>
learning, a friend of ours needed to sell her Saturn with a standard  <br/>
transmission, to buy a four wheel drive because she had moved into  <br/>
snowy mountains.  We bought it, partly so our kids could learn to  <br/>
drive a stick shift.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s Saturn has been a great extra car.  Yesterday four people went  <br/>
to Warped Tour in Las Cruces (last New Mexico city before El Paso and  <br/>
Juarez).  They were 22, 18, 15 and 13.  The middle two were mine.   <br/>
The older two drove.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I went out and peeled off an old torn up &quot;Trogdor the  <br/>
Burninator&quot; bumper sticker, cleaned the bumper with soapy water and  <br/>
409, and put on a brand new Trogdor sticker in a better spot.  I  <br/>
won&#39;t tell Marty.  He&#39;ll discover it at some point.  He and the 22  <br/>
year old will go up to northern New Mexico today where his dad and  <br/>
other friends of theirs are already camping, and spend the rest of  <br/>
the weekend there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Cell phone? -=-<br/>
<br/>
A friend of Kirby&#39;s who works for a cellphone company got Kirby his  <br/>
own phone years ago, but Kirby&#39;s upgrading and will pay fully for his  <br/>
own, starting this week or so.<br/>
<br/>
Marty pays for his and for the text messaging, on a family plan I  <br/>
share with him and Holly.<br/>
We pay for Holly&#39;s.  That was her Christmas gift last year.<br/>
<br/>
Keith the dad doesn&#39;t have a cellphone; doesn&#39;t want one.  We all  <br/>
wish he did.<br/>
<br/>
-=-What about their entertainment money?-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never had the concept &quot;entertainment money&quot; here.  Because  <br/>
everything is a learning opportunity, we&#39;ve paid for all kinds of  <br/>
things for them, from video games (at arcades, at home) to museum  <br/>
memberships to Disneyland to action figures.  But something happened,  <br/>
because we were generous and didn&#39;t sort things into &quot;educational&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;entertainment.  Lots of things  happened, but one thing was that  <br/>
our kids were happy to pay for such things themselves when they had  <br/>
money, and to pay for their siblings and friends.<br/>
<br/>
We modelled a way to be generous and sharing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Guitar lessons?-=-<br/>
<br/>
By the time Kirby was 18, we weren&#39;t paying for karate because he was  <br/>
teaching and earning his dojo membership.<br/>
I haven&#39;t paid for lessons for anyone over 18, but would be willing  <br/>
to.  If I had a friend who really wanted lessons and couldn&#39;t pay for  <br/>
it, I&#39;d consider helping him pay for it, too, if I couldn&#39;t teach him  <br/>
myself (and guitar I could, but I know that was just an example).<br/>
<br/>
-=- Their every indulgence? -=-<br/>
<br/>
In an unschooling situation, guitar lessons wouldn&#39;t be &quot;an indulgence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I want to look at &quot;indulgence.&quot;  It has a religious meaning, and  <br/>
has to do with making someone more whole, safer, sin-free.<br/>
<br/>
So when it&#39;s used as an insult, to name something the speaker wants  <br/>
to suggest the target listener (or non-present target) shouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
doing, it means that they are unfairly making someone else&#39;s life (or  <br/>
their own) bigger, better, safer, sin-free.  And THAT is a sin.  To  <br/>
alieve suffering is a sin, in most people&#39;s eyes.  Or a waste of  <br/>
time.  Or martyrdom.  But in our culture, it&#39;s generally not  <br/>
considered to be a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
If, instead of &quot;indulge,&quot; one said &quot;assist&quot; or &quot;care for&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;maintain,&quot; then the taint of sin fades away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-683132421">-=-Ok, so what about other bills incurred by your teen living at home?<br/>
Should you also pay for their car insurance and gas (for the car you<br/>
bought for them)? Cell phone? What about their entertainment money?<br/>
Guitar lessons? Their every indulgence?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Does it matter if they&#39;re working or not (so they HAVE money to<br/>
contribute to their own bills)?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It happened so gradually with my kids that there was never a time to  <br/>
decide.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was offered a job at 14, because he was helping voluntarily, so  <br/>
they started paying  him (at a gaming shop, where he became at first  <br/>
the Pokemon Gym-whatever, running the Saturday Pokemon League games,  <br/>
which was a pretty hefty project with lots of rules to learn and  <br/>
expensive pins and prizes to keep track of, and reports to write to  <br/>
the company).   He had a discount, then, on the gaming supplies he  <br/>
was already buying with his allowance before that.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose we could have penalized him by taking some of that money  <br/>
away, but he was learning and thriving, and that was part of our goal  <br/>
and desire for him, so we kept feeding and housing and clothing him,  <br/>
just as we would have if he had been in school or unemployeed.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was offered a job at 15, working for a man who made boots and  <br/>
pouches of leather, for re-enactors and historical reproduction  <br/>
this&#39;n&#39;that.  Marty learned LOTS, and lots.  And he was being paid.   <br/>
He was making money learning.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose we could have taken some of that money away, but darned if  <br/>
we didn&#39;t start paying for his insurance so he could drive himself to  <br/>
work.   And then, darned if he didn&#39;t often prefer to go up the bike  <br/>
trail on his roller blades instead of driving (though sometimes he  <br/>
took the bus back, because it was uphill and he was tired after work,  <br/>
and darned if I didn&#39;t always make sure he had quarters in his pocket  <br/>
for the bus).<br/>
<br/>
The way it works at our house is that all our kids have earned money,  <br/>
and they go out to eat, buy games, go to movies with it, and treat  <br/>
their friends if their friends are  poorer.  When they were younger  <br/>
and poorer, older or richer friends often paid for movies or meals or  <br/>
arcade play for them, and it flows back.  Marty saves more than Kirby  <br/>
does.   Kirby makes more than Marty made when Marty was last working,  <br/>
but Marty saved thousands of dollars and used some of it to go to  <br/>
Oregon and Washington.  Holly saved hundreds of dollars from a  <br/>
babysitting job and used some of it to go on a trip to visit friends  <br/>
in Rhode Island (she paid her airfare and took her own spending  <br/>
money, of her own choice).  Some of it she used to go to a big music  <br/>
concert yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Next month we&#39;re paying for Marty and Holly to go to an unschooling  <br/>
conference across the country.  They want to go, we want them to be  <br/>
able to go, the whole family can&#39;t go, but they can.  And another  <br/>
family is going to take care of them while they&#39;re there, and I&#39;m  <br/>
assuming my kids will be helpful and generous, because they have been  <br/>
that way for years, in other situations.<br/>
<br/>
I think I could have made them mean and stingy and we could have  <br/>
created a situation in which they didn&#39;t get to use real money in  <br/>
real ways and make their own decisions about their money, but I&#39;m  <br/>
THRILLED that we didn&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is moving, and I&#39;m not worried that he&#39;ll screw up his  <br/>
finances.  If he gets in debt, we&#39;ll help him by lending him money  <br/>
cheap to get him out, but he would probably borrow directly himself,  <br/>
from the credit union.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Kirby has a car and is paying his own insurance now.  His uncle  <br/>
died, and Kirby was given the car.  It&#39;s in his name.  He didn&#39;t have  <br/>
to buy it, and we didn&#39;t buy it for him.   He&#39;ll turn 21 soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742134901">So, I just wanted to add that I am 36 and my Mom currently pays my <br/>
car insurance.  I know how to pay my own, I could probably afford to <br/>
pay it myself, but my Mom likes to pay for it.  She also likes to pay <br/>
for art classes for my daughter and me. My Dad pays for my cell phone <br/>
because he likes to be able to get ahold of us (his grandaughter, <br/>
really) at any time! Further, we are still always welcome to move in <br/>
with her and my Dad.  I don&#39;t think generousity should end at a <br/>
certain age.  There were times when I was younger that I didn&#39;t <br/>
appreciate it, but now I look back and appreciate them for so much.  <br/>
Sometimes you don&#39;t get immediate gratification.  We think it&#39;s fun <br/>
to sneak in to her house and clean it to show her our appreciation.  <br/>
If I have extra money, I check to see if they need anything first.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s most important to my parents is that everyone is doing okay.  <br/>
Better than okay.  Happy, satisfied.  What&#39;s most important to me?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745714894">My mom used to say to me &quot;The longer you stay home, the more money you can<br/>
save for your first place.&quot;  She also paid for my share of my first<br/>
apartment while I was at university because she figured she&#39;d be paying for<br/>
room and board if I had stayed in the dorms.  <br/>
 <br/>
When my younger brother was in school she bought a condo near campus for him<br/>
instead of spending the money on RB at the college.  His part was to manage<br/>
the place and he put alot of work into keeping it up and upgrades etc.  He<br/>
got a great education just being the landlord for his roommates and then he<br/>
kept living there for several years after school.  The original idea was<br/>
that it would be an investment for her but by the time he was ready to move<br/>
my mom was retired and in an OK place financially.  She signed the condo<br/>
over to him so he could use the money as a down payment for his first house.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
My mom&#39;s generosity was completely cheerful, and without strings.   She<br/>
always made us feel like she was proud to help us out and when the time came<br/>
we should help our own kids as we are able.  She grew up with a loving<br/>
generous family in a little house with aunts and uncles and grandparents and<br/>
a dirt floor.   I am sure in her old age (she&#39;s pretty young still) she will<br/>
be welcome to live with any of us kids.  None of us would allow her to be<br/>
left alone in a home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect that some might react to Sandra&#39;s reply with &quot;Well, yeah,  <br/>
it works for her kids because that&#39;s their personality. But most kids  <br/>
aren&#39;t like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s true! Most kids are schooled. Most kids are conventionally  <br/>
parented.<br/>
<br/>
The success of mindful parenting isn&#39;t because it&#39;s done on  <br/>
thoughtful kids. The success is because it nurtures thoughtfulness in  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who grow up with generosity become generous.<br/>
<br/>
I think, though, that &quot;generosity&quot; might conjure up false images of  <br/>
&quot;indulgent&quot; parents, parent who are always giving their kids stuff,  <br/>
&quot;indulging their whims&quot;. But that comes from a mindset of &quot;It&#39;s mine.  <br/>
I&#39;ll dole it out as I want to.&quot; And that mindset affects the  <br/>
relationship. Kids know what they&#39;re given isn&#39;t given without  <br/>
strings attached. There *will* be moments of resentful reckoning when  <br/>
the kids have &quot;gone too far.&quot; &quot;Do you know how much I spent on that?&quot;  <br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t know how good you&#39;ve got it!&quot; That&#39;s because its not being  <br/>
given out of heart but because the parents think they should.<br/>
<br/>
But with mindful parenting, helping each other is just part of living  <br/>
life together. In the beginning parents will be doing the most  <br/>
helping, but when help is freely given with no strings attached, then  <br/>
we become people our kids want to help. It just becomes a way of life  <br/>
to be generous with each other.<br/>

Chamille routinely spends money on her own clothes willingly.  It <br/>
goes about half and half here.  Sometimes, I don&#39;t have the money <br/>

pay her back when I have it.  She voluntarily offers money up when <br/>
we don&#39;t have enough to do something that everyone wants to do.  <br/>
She&#39;s used gift cards on other people many times.<br/>

In 2 weeks my son will be 13.  I can&#39;t believe how many &quot;he&#39;s a great<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041974882">-=-We pay her way all the time because the parents won&#39;t and Chamille<br/>
really wants her to come, and so I work that expense in as part of<br/>
taking Chamille to whatever it is we are doing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done that with various kids at various times, too, but it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a problem.  Sometimes we didn&#39;t go somewhere because we  <br/>
couldn&#39;t afford to take all our kids and their friend or three, but  <br/>
we just tried never to get grumpy about it, either way, and that helped.<br/>
<br/>
Some of their friends who were hosted by us in various forms and ways  <br/>
when they were 12, 14, 16, are well employed now, one owns a house,  <br/>
and they&#39;ve QUITE sufficiently &quot;paid us back&quot; in helping our kids  <br/>
out, being friends with our family, helping me with various little  <br/>
things when they&#39;re around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030697945">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The way it works at our house is that all our kids have earned money,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and they go out to eat, buy games, go to movies with it, and treat<br/>
&gt; their friends if their friends are  poorer.  When they were younger<br/>
&gt; and poorer, older or richer friends often paid for movies or meals or<br/>
&gt; arcade play for them, and it flows back. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just in case anyone who has never met Sandra is doubtful about the true <br/>
generosity residing in her children&#39;s hearts, I can tell a Marty story that <br/>
happened right in front of me at L&L.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was about to join some friends for a meal out at a restaurant, and <br/>
Sandra offered him some money, reaching under the sales table for her purse. <br/>
He said to my best recollection, with his huge grin which I do remember, &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t need (or &quot;you keep&quot;) your money. I&#39;m a working man.&quot; And off he went.<br/>
<br/>
Teenager refuses freely offered cash from mom. Alert the media.<br/>
<br/>
It warmed my heart - again as so many Dodd family stories do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Transitioning from the &quot;free ride&quot; to paying my<br/>
own bills was quite a shock. I think now that if I had been<br/>
transitioned into paying my own bills gradually over time, it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have been so bad. I struggled with &quot;adulthood&quot; for many years before I<br/>
actually took full financial responsibility for myself. I think this<br/>
could have been avoided. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Making the kids pay for stuff, with the whole nasty feeling underlying <br/>
suspicion that the parents have been waiting all these years for the chance <br/>
to get some of their hard earned, possibly begrudged, money back at last, <br/>
does not have to be &quot;the way&quot; a shock could have been avoided. There are <br/>
other ways to avoid it, kind ways. Openess about the family finances is one <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever there is an insistence, or coercion, or threat, or expectation, <br/>
what is lost is the opportunity for a gift, for an offering, from the <br/>
feeling of generosity and the enjoyment of taking responsibility - from and <br/>
by the child, I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Every time we tell them what to do, we are preventing them from choosing, <br/>
evaluating and deciding what to do for themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431175002">&lt;&lt;&lt; &gt; That&#39;s something I&#39;ve thought of, too, that maybe *I&#39;d* be the one<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to move out and leave the house to one of my kids. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother moved out - she moved to Texas and I stayed in our condo in <br/>
Sydney. But then she sold the condo and I stayed in one of the two little <br/>
houses she bought.<br/>
<br/>
It never felt good though. There was always the reminder that I was living <br/>
rent free under her sufferance. She soon sold that one too. It wasn&#39;t like a <br/>
long beloved family home with any security of tenure. When I paid my own way <br/>
I was buying freedom from her controlling attitudes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377220244">I forgot to answer the question about who pays for the gasoline.<br/>
<br/>
Usually the kids, sometimes us.<br/>
<br/>
If I ask Marty to do errands for me or take Holly somewhere (which is  <br/>
not necessary  much anymore, as she&#39;s driving now), I&#39;ll offer him my  <br/>
debit card to get gas if he needs it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Keith, when he&#39;s going to Costco, will the car with the  <br/>
least gasoline and fill it up while he&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby pays 1/3 of the DSL line (and now that he&#39;s leaving... I don&#39;t  <br/>
know if we&#39;ll renegotiate with Marty or what).<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have &quot;a rule&quot; about who pays for what, but there&#39;s an  <br/>
assumption that someone using a car will not bring it back empty.<br/>
<br/>
For a while Kirby was always driving our biggest car (a Chevy  <br/>
conversion van) which wasn&#39;t really fair gas-wise.  He ported gamer  <br/>
friends, and kept a store of board games in the back all the time but  <br/>
it&#39;s WAY expensive, so once in a while Keith would put a tank to it.<br/>
<br/>
Lately it costs $90 to fill that van, so nobody&#39;s driving it casually.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby leaves, Marty will be the primary driver of the Saturn,  <br/>
because Holly can&#39;t drive a stick shift.  But our old mini van (my  <br/>
most regular vehicle) doesn&#39;t have working air conditioning, so for  <br/>
the rest of the summer I&#39;ll be using the Saturn some, if I know I&#39;ll  <br/>
be back before Marty uses it.  So I&#39;ll offer him money sometimes, for  <br/>
having driven up some of the gas he bought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19596291">-=- So, I just wanted to add that I am 36 and my Mom currently pays my<br/>
car insurance.  I know how to pay my own, I could probably afford to<br/>
pay it myself, but my Mom likes to pay for it.  She also likes to pay<br/>
for art classes for my daughter and me. My Dad pays for my cell phone<br/>
&lt;snip&gt; What&#39;s most important to my parents is that everyone is doing<br/>
okay. Better than okay.  Happy, satisfied.  What&#39;s most important to<br/>
me? Same thing.  My family will always be taken care of. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Same here. We&#39;re married with 2 kids and my mom still pays for our<br/>
cell phone bill occasionally. We&#39;re on a family share plan with her,<br/>
my dad and my sister. Sometimes we pay for our part, sometimes she<br/>
wants to pay for the whole thing. Until last year she also paid our<br/>
car insurance and did so for several years just because she wanted to.<br/>
She&#39;s loaned us money and let us put things on her credit cards.<br/>
<br/>
We lived with dh&#39;s family for a while and they never let us give them<br/>
$$ although they were happy to let us contribute in other ways. Both<br/>
sides of our extended family have been generous to us - over the years<br/>
they&#39;ve paid electric bills when times were tight and have even helped<br/>
us buy a car. DH&#39;s mom used to slip twenties into our coat pockets<br/>
just because she could. The things we need but can&#39;t afford often<br/>
&quot;magically&quot; manifest themselves in the form of birthday and holiday<br/>
presents.<br/>
<br/>
We really appreciate all they&#39;ve done and are glad we aren&#39;t made to<br/>
feel guilty about accepting or needing help from time to time. We plan<br/>
to continue that goodwill with our own kids. I can&#39;t imagine kicking<br/>
them out or &quot;cutting them off&quot; at 18 or 21 or 30 or...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602953355">Interesting responses from everyone. Thanks. Some things I asked <br/>
about our 18 (almost 19) year old pays for already (gas, guitar-<br/>
related gear, entertainment - meaning eating out with his friends, <br/>
dating, movies, etc.), but I was interested to know where everyone <br/>
else stood on them. <br/>
<br/>
Other info about our situation is that he just graduated from high <br/>
school in June, is working full-time, and does not plan to attend <br/>
college. He received about $10,000 cash as gifts from family & <br/>
friends for his graduation, which he used to buy a car (since the one <br/>
we gave him died about a month before graduation), and a new guitar <br/>
amp. He still has some in his account. We asked him to start paying <br/>
for his own car insurance with his new car, but were able to get him <br/>
an incredible deal by putting the car in my husband&#39;s name and adding <br/>
it to our policy with our son as the primary driver. He pays about <br/>
1/3rd of what his friends pay, and he has better insurance. He&#39;s <br/>
happy with that arrangement.<br/>
<br/>
Last summer he and I did a little budget for him that included <br/>
calculating how much gas it cost to go from an apartment of his <br/>
choice to work/church/guitar lessons/downtown/etc. and it was a real <br/>
eye-opener for him. He decided then and there that he would just <br/>
continue living with us for a while. Fair enough. I told him he was <br/>
always welcome in our home, and that he could stay as long as he <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
What I had been thinking was that in the fall we might sit down with <br/>
him and talk about handing over some of his other bills that he will <br/>
take with him when he moves out (guitar lessons, health insurance), <br/>
but not go so far as to charge him rent or board (things he would not <br/>
take with him).<br/>
<br/>
What I can see now is that my negative feelings about my late <br/>
transition into financial responsibility for myself have more to do <br/>
with the strings that always came attached to the money my parents <br/>
provided for me. Their money meant their control over me, and it <br/>
still bothers me even now to think about how it was. Even though we <br/>
don&#39;t do that to our kids, I guess I have been thinking (heavily <br/>
laden with my own baggage) that surely our 18 year old would want <br/>
more independence from us by paying his own bills. Thanks for opening <br/>
my eyes to that. I&#39;ve decided to just leave everything the way it is <br/>
for now. If we&#39;re still in the same spot in a couple of years, <br/>
though, we&#39;ll have to talk. :)  (I can&#39;t really see that happening. <br/>
Things always change.)<br/>
