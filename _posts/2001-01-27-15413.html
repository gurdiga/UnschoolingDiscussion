<br/>
A lot of people here WILL agree with you, but at least one will question the <br/>
proviso &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is fascinated by and engrossed in something, what are legitimate <br/>
reasons to make him stop?  I&#39;ve heard a hundred spurious ones over the years.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said several times to me, in the tone of voice you&#39;d think would be <br/>
saved for people doing something really disgusting, &quot;Get your nose out of <br/>
that book and go outside and play.&quot;  Because she couldn&#39;t see the value in <br/>
what I was doing, and it didn&#39;t involve her, she wanted me to stop.   It <br/>
didn&#39;t matter to her what was going on in the book when she swooped in and <br/>
changed my life, it only mattered that she felt for a moment that she was <br/>
being a good mother by directing my activities.<br/>
<br/>
How would any of you like it if you were right in the middle of writing one <br/>
of the best things you ever wrote (no matter how long you had been at the <br/>
computer) and someone twice your size (or just your mother) blasted in <br/>
without even waiting politely to see if you were at a stopping place and <br/>
commanded you to turn it off or said &quot;That&#39;s enough&quot; or &quot;your brain will rot&quot; <br/>
or &quot;isn&#39;t there something better you could be doing?&quot;  Probably there&#39;s <br/>
something better SHE could be doing.<br/>
<br/>
And if nothing else in the house is more involving or alluring than that <br/>
video game, maybe your child knows what he&#39;s doing, sticking with the best <br/>
thing available to him, or maybe you need to look at his options and improve <br/>
the competition.<br/>
<br/>
But limiting it will make it more valuable, and will affect our child&#39;s <br/>
opinon of your judgment for good or ill.  Don&#39;t imagine that the kids are <br/>
unaware of the relative value (to them) of things including moms&#39; opinions.<br/>
<br/>
If you let him quit when he&#39;s done, he WILL quit, and he will have been <br/>
empowered to finish things when he&#39;s finished instead of living by the <br/>
clock--and that&#39;s one of the coolest things about unschooling, is going by <br/>
interest and self-motivation instead of daily and weekly and monthly <br/>
schedules.   Quitting because you&#39;re finished gives a huge feeling of <br/>
satisfaction which quitting because the bell rang or your mom said &#39;stop&#39; <br/>
doesn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987081190">Hi, I must admit that around here the kids are not allowed to play video <br/>
games or watch tv as much or whenever they want. First off, we only have two <br/>
pcs (and one is older which I use for work and does not run games well), and <br/>
we have one playstation and one tv with vcr. If I let the kids use the pc or <br/>
tv as much as they wanted then there would be an endless fight over who&#39;s <br/>
turn it was and fights get really old, really fast. Recently my kids decided <br/>
to raise dogs and have bought breeding stock and have puppies that need <br/>
constant care. We also believe that dogs need exercise (no matter how many <br/>
you nave), so that is another chore that needs to be done daily. Although the <br/>
kids were gung-ho to do these chores in the beginning now it is not as much <br/>
fun. Some days it is cold, or they just got a new game that they are dying to <br/>
play. The kids tried the &quot;lets play playstation or pc first before doing <br/>
morning chores&quot; routine but I could not allow this, animals need care first. <br/>
And the dog thing was their idea not mine. I do help out but it is their <br/>
business. Yesterday the kids went (with own money) and bought two more pups, <br/>
more work and responsibility. The kids have more pens to build and just <br/>
finished repairing an old doghouse. It has turned into a lot of work. And now <br/>
the kids are reading dog books aloud, learning how to manage their new <br/>
business and housebreak pups. But still the video games and tv call to them <br/>
to come and play, they are so much fun.  I make sure the kids at least get <br/>
half an hour to play these video type games and some days they may each play <br/>
an hour and they watch tv in the evenings with Dad, (while taking turns <br/>
taking pups out). If I did let them out of their chores to do as they wanted <br/>
then that means I would have to do their chores and mine and what would they <br/>
learn from that? That Mom or someone will be there to cover for them? <br/>
<br/>
Many unschoolers like to read about the Colfax&#39;s or Holt&#39;s ideals but neither <br/>
had these types of distractions to deal with. <br/>
<br/>
If I was totally involved in writing my best piece I would hate to have to <br/>
stop but in reality this happens all the time. If I am totally involved in <br/>
something and the kids, animals, chores, meals or whatever needs my attention <br/>
I stop and take care of it. Isn&#39;t that something that too needs to be learned?<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter that can read for hours. I have no problem with that at all <br/>
as long as she is handling her share of the chores. You can imagine how much <br/>
her siblings complain if they have to take her turn at doing a chores because <br/>
she is reading. It just doesn&#39;t work. I do require that the kids help out <br/>
with housework, garden, and yard work. I try to make it a minimum, I know <br/>
kids need free time and I am not picky or a perfectionist, making them work <br/>
all the time. But it is next to impossible for me do it all with four kids <br/>
and a husband that works 60 hrs a week. I need their help and if the kids and <br/>
I get after the work it does not take long to finish. <br/>
<br/>
We have a new game for the pc, Age of Empires 2, really a cool game. So I try <br/>
to work it out so the kids can play a little more. I know it takes a long <br/>
time to get set up in it. This morning I got up early and did the dog chores <br/>
for them. That gives the kids some extra free time and so they are taking <br/>
turns with the pc. I like to do that sometimes but I do not have time to do <br/>
it all the time. I love the game Age of Empires 1 but I only let myself play <br/>
once a week. It is too time consuming. <br/>
<br/>
I think that it is great that many kids have lots of free time to spend with <br/>
their friends, projects, games, etc. I think it is important that every <br/>
family decide what is best for their family. Or do you disagree and think I <br/>
should still allow my kids to do what they wish whenever they wish? <br/>

We&#39;ve always rented the games from the video store. They&#39;re very expensive to <br/>
buy. That way also there&#39;s a built in time limit and if the game is really <br/>
great you can take it back out. When my son was younger he had a Sega that he <br/>
bought with his own money. Now he has a PlayStation that he and a friend <br/>
bought from another friend that came with a lot of sports games. Mostly these <br/>
days he plays games on the computer but now that he has a job he has less <br/>
time to play. He got a football game for Christmas from us and his older <br/>
sister.<br/>
<br/>
My kids say that first of all if your son&#39;s cousins have a Nintendo 64, he <br/>
will probably not be satisfied with a SuperNintendo. If they have a <br/>
SuperNintendo then that would probably suffice. Nintendo 64 is somewhat older <br/>
than the newest models from other companies but still popular. One issue with <br/>
old models is finding games. You could find second hand games but not rentals <br/>
for a Super Nintendo. My kids have always had to buy these things for <br/>
themselves. My now 15yo son saved Christmas and Birthday money for a year to <br/>
buy his Sega when he was 7 or 8 yo. He says you should not torture your son <br/>
in this way and should buy the Nintendo for him (LOL) ;.)<br/>

I, too have many reservations about t.v, video games, and computers for<br/>
young children.  My son is 4 y.o., and we rarely watch t.v ourselves, so<br/>
it&#39;s not a big issue so far.  He does watch t.v. at my parents house,<br/>
usually PBS or Jeopardy, and it&#39;s amazing how much he memorizes from the<br/>
little time he watches.  Once in awhile we use the computer together, but we<br/>
don&#39;t have any game software.<br/>
<br/>
I am concerned from a neurological perspective, he does have some neuro<br/>
problems as it is and I didn&#39;t want to add to that situation.  He does have<br/>
a great attention span, he plays very well by himself, and is highly<br/>
creative in his play.  I have no idea if things would have been different<br/>
with more electronic media exposure or not.  Sometimes I think we&#39;re the<br/>
only homeschoolers around who limit this, nice to know we&#39;re not alone.<br/>

all share space and I just don&#39;t want to hear it going all day. I like peace, <br/>
or a little background music, or even something interesting on the <br/>
television. I just don&#39;t want to hear constant chatter from the box all day. <br/>
Same goes for the video games and the cheers and jeers that always accompany <br/>
them.<br/>

loved it. I&#39;m all for it, but there are also times<br/>
that he keeps playing not cuz he is still all that<br/>
into it, but just cuz he is addicted. Haven&#39;t you sat<br/>
at the computer for just an hour or so too long<br/>
sometimes not cuz you don&#39;t want to get on with doing<br/>
other things that you like but just becuz there is<br/>

pretending....you&#39;re SHOOTING someone. Maybe older<br/>
kids or grown ups even are able to separate &quot;real&quot;<br/>
guns and &quot;pretend&quot; ones, but in my mind little kids<br/>
can&#39;t make that definition yet (as in my 5 year old<br/>
son)...He knows that it would be wrong to shoot<br/>
someone, but if there were a real gun in front of him<br/>
and he was already accustomed to &quot;pretend guns&quot; in<br/>
games...(that are actually very graphic with blood and<br/>
everything flying everywhere and it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>
entertaining)...how would he justify that it&#39;s ok to<br/>
pretend you&#39;re shooting someone to bits and not to<br/>
touch a gun in real life? I&#39;m just not comfortable<br/>
with the idea of teaching him that these weapons that<br/>
are used primarily for taking life are ok to &quot;pretend&quot;<br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
ahem. sorry, I tend to get a little carried away on<br/>
this subject which I have oft discussed with my<br/>
sister, whose son has no restrictions about games and<br/>
owns a bb gun etc. at age 13. <br/>
<br/>
 but at<br/>

would be if no one questioned anything. :)<br/>

&gt; My mom said several times to me, in the tone of<br/>
&gt; voice you&#39;d think would be <br/>
&gt; saved for people doing something really disgusting,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Get your nose out of <br/>
&gt; that book and go outside and play.&quot;  Because she<br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t see the value in <br/>
&gt; what I was doing, and it didn&#39;t involve her, she<br/>
&gt; wanted me to stop.   <br/>
&gt; How would any of you like it if you were right in<br/>
&gt; the middle of writing one <br/>
&gt; of the best things you ever wrote (no matter how<br/>

&gt; computer) and someone twice your size (or just your<br/>
&gt; mother) blasted in <br/>

&gt; a stopping place and <br/>
&gt; commanded you to turn it off or said &quot;That&#39;s enough&quot;<br/>
&gt; or &quot;your brain will rot&quot; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>AAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!<br/>
what a horrible story! I&#39;ll probably have a nightmare<br/>
about it! &lt;g&gt; that&#39;s awful. And I never do that to<br/>
Satori, as I consider myself more a kid than a grown<br/>
up in all the good wayz (I have fought &quot;crossing over&quot;<br/>
quite determinedly), and I do know the value of never<br/>
turning his video game off when he&#39;s just about to win<br/>
a world, etc. He works so hard at it and is able to<br/>
concentrate on it without any effort. He actually<br/>
likes it much better when i play WITH him. I get<br/>
constant updates on how he&#39;s doing and where secret<br/>
worlds are. Ds and his &quot;second daddy&quot; (instead of<br/>
&quot;step daddy&quot;)just came running in to let me know that<br/>
one of them had found a secret barrel in Donkey Kong<br/>
Country that took them past the WHOLE cart world! cool<br/>
beans. No, I don&#39;t think his brains will rot, but I do<br/>
want him to not be limited to just ONE thing he<br/>
enjoys, as there are so many things he wants to do. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And if nothing else in the house is more involving<br/>
&gt; or alluring than that <br/>
&gt; video game, maybe your child knows what he&#39;s doing,<br/>
&gt; sticking with the best <br/>
&gt; thing available to him, or maybe you need to look at<br/>
&gt; his options and improve <br/>
&gt; the competition.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the contrary he runs around trying a little of this<br/>
a little of that, not knowing which he wants to do<br/>
first, he&#39;ll fight with his sister to be able to do<br/>
their JumpStart Math Game and then starts Donkey Kong<br/>
and forgets he was waiting for that, and then gets on<br/>
the computer (after I remind he asked for it) and<br/>
forgets he made it very clear to everyone that HE had<br/>
dibs on the tv for wishbone and dragontales. :) Then<br/>
draws in his &quot;how to draw superheroes&quot; book while he<br/>
watches them and waits for me to &quot;get things ready&quot;<br/>
for &quot;making stuff&quot; or baking cookies, etc.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you let him quit when he&#39;s done, he WILL quit,<br/>
&gt; and he will have been <br/>
&gt; empowered to finish things when he&#39;s finished<br/>
&gt; instead of living by the <br/>
&gt; clock<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA!<br/>
my boyfriend always jokes that I have NO concept of<br/>
time. The only clocks I ever see are here on the puter<br/>
and on my phone. We do things til we&#39;re done (and<br/>
sometimes beyond, it&#39;s in our natures). Including<br/>
video games, but sometimes those things get<br/>
frustrating if you don&#39;t take a break and do something<br/>
else. Like getting a fresh perspective. Like curing<br/>
writer&#39;s block when you&#39;re stuck in the middle of a<br/>
piece you&#39;ve been working on for dayz and dayz on end.<br/>
But whatever we switch to, we tend to get caught up in<br/>
for longer then we want to be and so I try to keep<br/>
things moving so that we don&#39;t end up getting bored<br/>
with things we like.<br/>
Many times I&#39;ll remind Satori that he wanted to do<br/>
something else to, or suggest a new activity for<br/>
awhile, and then find myself saying &quot;wait! don&#39;t just<br/>
turn it off, you&#39;ll lose all those levels you won!&quot;<br/>
&lt;g&gt; and for two days one time we kept the Nintendo on<br/>
and just turned the monitor off, cuz we just needed to<br/>
beat ONE more castle so we could save the game and not<br/>
have to start all over. We all took turns having a go<br/>
at it. FINALLY won it. Jeez. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18685427">I agree with you in alot of wayz here Candy. When I<br/>
was younger I was never forced to do any chores. We<br/>
(parents and me and sis) went thru several attempts at<br/>
some sort of a program but what can i say, my parents<br/>
were big softies and plus I always knew (not<br/>
consciously at first) that if I left it undone long<br/>
enough that mom would do it cuz to have it undone<br/>
drove her crazy (that whole compulsive<br/>
cleaning/straightening thing). But this carries into<br/>
our dealings now even. It also unintentionally<br/>
instilled in me that she didn&#39;t trust me to get it<br/>
done on my own. I think you are conveying to your kids<br/>
that you have faith in their abilities and they know<br/>
that if they don&#39;t do it then you aren&#39;t going to do<br/>
run thier dog business for them. good form.<br/>
And I also agree that alot of things written on hs/us<br/>
are mostly written from the assumption that every<br/>
family is one that has  ideal circumstances. I don&#39;t<br/>
know ANY of those personally.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Some who support more coercive strategies assume that children will run<br/>
wild if they are not controlled.  However, the children for whom this is<br/>
true typically turn out to be those accustomed to being controlled--those<br/>
who are not trusted, given explanations, encouraged to think for<br/>
themselves, helped to develop and internalize good values, and so<br/>
on.  Control breeds the need for more control, which is then used to<br/>
justify the use of control.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15185948">I am confident that children know the difference between reality and <br/>
fantasy; and anything that happens in adult reality they process through <br/>
their play. The way you play guns is by pretending to shoot. Sometimes you <br/>
might pretend to kill. For my son playing with toy guns was something he <br/>
wanted to do. He never remotely thought it was real.  (&quot;Look Mom, there&#39;s a <br/>
gun store over there. Why would anyone want a real gun???&quot; ) When he got <br/>
older he sometimes played violent video games and watched violent movies with <br/>
his older sister, stuff I wouldn&#39;t watch. Whatever it was all about he seems <br/>
to have gotten it out of his system. Now, at age 15 he watches and plays <br/>
games about sports.</div>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Marty says Game Force or Software Etc. in Winrock<br/>
&gt; (both have used stuff) and <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a used store near WalMart on Eubank:  Game<br/>
&gt; Stop  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; or Replay Games on Eubank and Candelaria (SW side)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; but if you can wait a few days, ordering from<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gamestop.com/jump/">http://www.gamestop.com/jump/</a><br/>
&gt; might give you more choices.  (buying locally&#39;s good<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599370173">my thoughts exactly. how can I explain to them that<br/>
it&#39;s ok to PRETEND they are doing something that they<br/>
would never ever do in real life cuz it&#39;s &quot;bad&quot;?<br/>
I understand it&#39;s easier for some other families and<br/>
moms and what not and that&#39;s great if they can find a<br/>
way to explain it to the kids, but mine say &quot;why can<br/>
we PRETEND we&#39;re being bad people if we don&#39;t want to<br/>
be bad people for real?&quot; I don&#39;t let them pretend they<br/>
are stealing or smoking or any of the other things I<br/>
would prefer they don&#39;t grow up to do in real life, so<br/>
I just don&#39;t let them play with guns either. <br/>
just my own opinion though. <br/>

&gt; &gt;&lt;&lt; Maybe older<br/>
&gt; &gt;  kids or grown ups even are able to separate<br/>
&gt; &quot;real&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  guns and &quot;pretend&quot; ones, but in my mind little<br/>
&gt; kids<br/>
&gt; &gt;  can&#39;t make that definition yet (as in my 5 year<br/>
&gt; old<br/>
&gt; &gt;  son). &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;When my son was little I let him play with toy<br/>
&gt; guns. One day when he was 4 <br/>
&gt; &gt;or<br/>
&gt; &gt;5, we were driving along when of a sudden he<br/>
&gt; pointed out the window and <br/>
&gt; &gt;said<br/>
&gt; &gt;with utter astonishment, &quot;Look Mom, there&#39;s a gun<br/>
&gt; store over there. Why <br/>
&gt; &gt;would<br/>
&gt; &gt;anyone want a real gun???&quot; That cleared up any<br/>
&gt; concerns I had:&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819098791">I might not have a problem with any target shooting<br/>
games, but it&#39;s just that I&#39;ve never seen a game where<br/>
they shoot targets that aren&#39;t live creatures. I let<br/>
my son have bows and arrows (little plastic ones) and<br/>
they usually come with a target and there are shows<br/>
that show archery as a sport where you shoot a TARGET,<br/>
but I&#39;ve just never seen that done with toy guns.<br/>
unless the target is in the shape of another human. <br/>
Good point though, if it isn&#39;t something VIOLENT then<br/>
I&#39;m fine with it, but thanks to media and other<br/>
children wanting to play like they are shooting EACH<br/>
OTHER, that&#39;s what my son thinks of when he sees a<br/>
gun, he thinks of bad guys shooting other people or of<br/>
hunters and poachers shooting animals. He&#39;s still<br/>
fascinated with the mechanics of things like guns, and<br/>
I try not to discourage that and be all fanatical, but<br/>
I still don&#39;t want him playing at something violent. <br/>
to each his own.<br/>

son, at age 3, came up to me and spoke to me like I was addled and pointed<br/>
out that there was no trigger on his stick and that a stick couldn&#39;t hold<br/>
bullets, and that &quot;it is just *pretend* mom....no one is really going to<br/>
get hurt....&quot;  We don&#39;t have toy guns more than a few centimeters long<br/>
(the ones with playmobil and max steele), but lots of gun play has taken<br/>
place in the form of sticks, legos, tortillas, whatever.  Yet, when my<br/>
boyz were confronted with a real gun at someone&#39;s house, they were the<br/>
first to leave and go to their safe place while all the other kids<br/>
clustered around to look at it (it was a faux replica and the man who had<br/>
it told the kids that, but mine decided to not trust him and go someplace<br/>
safe just in case).  their fascination with gun play has waxed and waned.  <br/>
the 8 yo is nearly done with it and the 5 yo has hit the peak, I think.<br/>
