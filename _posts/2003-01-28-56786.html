who is his son, born on earth to save humanity. It might even<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have the virgin birth, star and crucifixtion. Or that might be Tammuz who<br/>

star, wise men, evil king who killed kids under 2,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; crucifiction and resurrection too.<br/>
&gt; Mithras did all those things too. And he&#39;s coming back. As is Tammuz and<br/>
