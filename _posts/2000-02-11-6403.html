<div id="ygrps-yiv-908755752">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am having a little difficulty today with my reactions to my childrens<br/>
sudden interest in guns.  It has become a thing with the neighbours boy as<br/>
well.... and they are all here at my house building toy guns out of lego.<br/>
The only real guideline I have given is &quot;no shooting at people&quot; but I still<br/>
feel sick to my stomach when I watch them making gun noises and &quot;playing&quot;<br/>
with them.  (And by the way spouting off a surprisingly vast body of<br/>
knouledge about different kinds etc.)<br/>
    I have talked to my boys often about how guns are tools for either<br/>
protection or hunting, or weapons of war, but definately not toys.  But<br/>
short of making a no-holds barred rule of &quot;no toy guns of any sort&quot; I am<br/>
figuring I will have to just accept their gun play as more of my problem<br/>
than theirs.  We also don&#39;t have any &quot;real&quot; toy guns which I think helps a<br/>
lot.  I would greatly appreciate hearing how other families have dealt with<br/>
this issue...<br/>
    Has anyone gone the rout of taking up guns as an topic to study more in<br/>
depth??</div>
