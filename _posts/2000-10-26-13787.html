<div id="ygrps-yiv-181981078">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
I live in Michigan so the rules are loose here, no testing or anything<br/>
else I can find.   Someone said we are suppose to register but I checked<br/>
with a friend who&#39;s up on things and she said, &quot;don&#39;t unless asked&quot;.  I<br/>
know some folks are registered with Conlara which may work as an<br/>
umbrella organization.  I believe they have a websight.  It&#39;s very<br/>
Unschooly in flavor.<br/>
