<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088806408">Dear Unschoolers and others not yet &quot;there,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Luz and I  have been hosting gatherings of homeschoolers at our home for<br/>
about eighteen years. It began with wanting to meet with others doing<br/>
similar things. As followers of the writings of John Holt, we were, and<br/>
still are, surprised to find so many people who believe that homeschooling<br/>
actually means &quot;doing school at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In our travels, we&#39;ve met many people who agree with us (and Holt), but<br/>
along the way it has become evident that many people (most, in fact) simply<br/>
cannot imagine growing up without having a school-like experience. The first<br/>
impulse of many people who are dissatisfied with their public school is to<br/>
do the same thing at home. They haven&#39;t yet seen the truth in Holt&#39;s message<br/>
that IT&#39;S THE SCHOOLING THAT&#39;S THE PROBLEM.<br/>
<br/>
That exact thing happened to me twenty-five years ago. When my older son<br/>
(then 9yo) came to live with me, I sent for the box of books (from Calvert).<br/>
On the second morning, my son looked up and said, &quot;Dad, this is stupid.&quot; I<br/>
replied, &quot;You&#39;re right, let&#39;s send it back for a refund and go out and<br/>
play.&quot;  He agreed, and that&#39;s what we did.<br/>
<br/>
 Luckily for me, the transition from school-at-home to unschooling was quick<br/>
and easy. For others, it&#39;s not so...the fears, intimidation and pressures to<br/>
have a &quot;school&quot; experience (no matter how stupid it is) are strong, and it<br/>
usually takes time and courage and unusual trust of both one&#39;s self and<br/>
one&#39;s child to jump off that cliff into total unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In our gatherings, we know that some families are using school books, and<br/>
that some children are more secure if they occasionally fill a workbook or<br/>
take a test or read a textbook. So what. We don&#39;t give out pedigrees, we<br/>
don&#39;t check anyone&#39;s teeth or diet or degree of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
To us, UNschooling is a weaning process that parents need to go through. We<br/>
(parents) need to learn that the school experience is not only unnecessary,<br/>
but can be, and often is, damaging both for children and parents. Therefore,<br/>
Unschooling simply means learning not to take schooling seriously. I believe<br/>
that, with that attitude, many families have gradually weaned themselves<br/>
from &quot;schooling their kids&quot; to a much more relaxed form of homeschooling.<br/>
Not everyone can get &quot;there&quot; quickly and/or easily.<br/>
<br/>
For Luz and me, unschooling was extreme, but not fanatical. It was merely in<br/>
agreement with our kid&#39;s desires. He liked Churchill&#39;s expression, &quot;I love<br/>
to learn, but hate being taught.&quot; Somehow, we learned to trust him early on,<br/>
that he could be in charge of his own learning. By not going to school, he<br/>
had plenty of time to do it. He&#39;s now 23, graduated from college Magna Cum<br/>
Laude, and seems to have good prospects.<br/>
<br/>
People tell us...&quot;Well, you are good parents and Cassidy must be bright.&quot;<br/>
The one thing I have come to realize is, &quot;Nobody dumbed him down.&quot;<br/>
