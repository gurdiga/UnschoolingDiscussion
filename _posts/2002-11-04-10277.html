<div id="ygrps-yiv-48534782">I was at the local teacher supply store today, getting loaded up on <br/>
stickers, and I saw two interesting posters in the window.  <br/>
The first was a sign called &quot;Respect&quot;  with a list of meanings. One <br/>
was  &quot;treating others the way you want to be treated.&quot;  <br/>
The second poster was one with &quot;Teacher&#39;s Rules&quot; across the top.  <br/>
Handwritten in the following lines were these rules (among <br/>
many):  &quot;Recess is a privilege, I can take it away.&quot;  and another <br/>
lovely one about getting permission to use the restroom.  I know it <br/>
was partly tongue-in-cheek, but still, I can picture a teacher <br/>
saying these!  <br/>
<br/>
I wondered if a teacher would find it respectful for the principal <br/>
to require the teacher to earn breaks or get permission to use the <br/>
restroom.  <br/>
I see something a little crazy-making nearly every time I am in the <br/>
store, but these ones really rubbed me the wrong way. Ugh.  <br/>

When I was a kid, recess was physical education, and they couldn&#39;t take it <br/>
away! &lt;g&gt;</div>
