<div id="ygrps-yiv-214657323">aaaahhhhh, struggling with peace in my home, in my children... <br/>
It&#39;s a tough time of transition for us, we&#39;re moving in with another <br/>
family and giving up a lot of taken-for-granted freedoms we&#39;d not <br/>
considered. The move is my responsibility alone and the burden <br/>
has not left me with much physical energy, let alone the <br/>
emotional space to deal with the *now* with my kids.  <br/>
Hayden, 7, is the most visibly agitated: his voice often has a <br/>
grumpy, growly tone, even when saying *yes* to something.  After <br/>
a few days, it&#39;s become hard to ignore the tone and listen to the <br/>
message underneath, especially when his friends and their <br/>
parents focus on the tone and ignore the message.  Hannah, 9, <br/>
has also become needier than I expected, with unbeforeseen <br/>
levels of whining and clinginess.  <br/>
hmmmm, has *MY* voice been on edge and crabby? does *MY* <br/>
inner child want to whine and cling?  Am I seeing the fruit of my <br/>
own struggle blossom in my children?  YOU BETCHA!! <br/>
I see that &quot;taking my time&quot; with the move has not been the <br/>
benefit I anticipated, a quick clean break would have left me with <br/>
less ruminating time and more time to deal with what&#39;s at hand <br/>
now.  <br/>
<br/>
As I wandered about on Sandra&#39;s website, I found a great story <br/>
about a family interaction where she has an &#39;aha!&#39; moment -- <br/>
realizing she is more &quot;my children&#39;s mother than my mother&#39;s <br/>
child&quot;  This really resonated with me as I, too, realize how easy it <br/>
is to give in to the really loud voices in my head (revert to <br/>
standard/authoritarian parenting) even though they aren&#39;t the <br/>
ones that make the most sense (they&#39;re just the loudest and <br/>
most practiced of the voices &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
So today, I will be their mom, the product of what I&#39;ve learned <br/>
since they&#39;ve come along, not the product of my parents.  I will <br/>
breathe, smile and cuddle; find every opportunity to say yes; and I <br/>
will get our things organized and moved so to make the rest of <br/>
the transition easier.  <br/>

This was nice to read this morning, Diana.  While we aren&#39;t moving in  with <br/>
another family, we did just move from our home in Florida (leaving my  sister, <br/>
my mom and my sister&#39;s two children who are my kids best friends) to New  <br/>
Mexico.  We&#39;re in a rental house next door to my in-laws while we look for  a <br/>
house.  For the most part, we have stayed busy and positive but last  night Brenna <br/>
and I just gave in for awhile. We were both close to tears sitting  on the <br/>
couch  and we looked at each other and at the same time said...&quot;This  stinks!&quot;   <br/>
It&#39;s been hard.<br/>
 <br/>
I miss my mom, my sister, our house, my running trails, all the  kids from <br/>
the neighborhood running in and out, our pool, my husband (he had  a home office <br/>
in Florida), how to get to all my familiar places....... Most of  all, I miss <br/>
the joy in my children as they ran back and forth visiting and  hanging out <br/>
with their cousins. (Whine, Whine, Whine...I&#39;m done  now..&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
We planned it for a very long time and I was sure it was the right  decision. <br/>
 The reality of it has been so much more difficult than I could  have ever <br/>
imagined.  I get up every day so determined to do just what you  have said above <br/>
and so far haven&#39;t been very successful..<br/>
 <br/>
Moving and change are just hard.  I&#39;m realizing that moving with older  <br/>
children (12 and 16) has different challenges in meeting new people. It&#39;s  not <br/>
quite as easy when you can&#39;t just go to a park day to meet other  families.  I <br/>
keep telling my kids it takes time but I think at any given  moment we would all <br/>
move back to Florida.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m so glad we are unschooling as we can sleep in, explore, discover our  new <br/>
surrounding to our hearts content.  We&#39;re fortunate to have another  <br/>
unschooling family close by who have welcomed and included us...(Thanks  Sandra!)  I <br/>
look at the mountains and I really don&#39;t miss Florida at  all.  It was never <br/>
home to me and this is where I want to be.  I do  however, miss our lives there. <br/>
 I&#39;m realizing that I have to grieve and let  go of that before I can truly <br/>
be joyful here.<br/>
 <br/>
I know all the right things to do and we&#39;re doing them....I just want  things <br/>
to be better right now!! &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;m hoping things get easier for  you soon, <br/>
Diana, and that you enjoy your new home.<br/>
 <br/>
Gail (not known for either her patience or adapting to change but is  working <br/>
on both :-)<br/>

<br/>
Keith wanted use to move to Minneapolis at one point, and it horrified me.   <br/>
I think I might have died.    That makes me feel like an oath-breaking wimp <br/>
(having sworn marriage-stuff in public and all), and I would probably adapt if I <br/>
had to, but there&#39;s something about being around familiar air and familiar <br/>
food that makes me feel alive.<br/>
<br/>
I feel so bad for the displaced hurricane survivors who are plopped hither <br/>
and yon with foreign water and pillows and strange weeds and   newscasters they <br/>
don&#39;t recognize and weather maps they don&#39;t understand.    Some of them might <br/>
not mind as much as others.   Some people thrive on galavanting and on <br/>
mysterious newness.   Some don&#39;t.   <br/>
<br/>
The only place I&#39;ve ever wanted to go and stay was England.   Is still think <br/>
about it.   I think I wouldn&#39;t last three months, but I like to wish I could.  <br/>
  I would probably curl up and cry, wanting high dry-desert air and a green <br/>
chile enchilada.<br/>
<br/>
Diana&#39;s at least in the same town, but sometimes it&#39;s what one sees going to <br/>
sleep or waking up that can be joy or discomfort.   So even a different room <br/>
in the same house can be disconcerting for someone who likes sameness.   Kirby <br/>
and I are both like that.   I see it in Holly and Marty a little less, but <br/>
some.   It&#39;s probably somewhat genetic.   Maybe gypsies who didn&#39;t want to move <br/>
were less likely to find a mate (or would find one who also wanted to buy a <br/>
house and get a steady job &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I watched The Field last night (for Richard Harris, and I&#39;m kinda sorry I did <br/>
because it was disturbing) but part of it dealt with the benefits and also <br/>
the silly (and in this case deadly) futility of attaching oneself to a piece of <br/>
land, instead of to people and lightness of being.   The grown son takes up <br/>
with a tinker/traveller, who&#39;s never had land and will never want any.    My <br/>
sympathies were all over the place, with all the characters and all their <br/>
referenced ancestors.    It made my own attachments seem wrong.   (Then I went to <br/>
sleep in my own bed, comfortably. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705083932">We all love board games at our house.  We just got a new one and I love it<br/>
so I thought I share about it here.  It&#39;s called The Amazing Labyrinth.<br/>
It&#39;s a game where you plan your moves ahead and use logic and it&#39;s really<br/>
fun.  Both my girls (ages 9 and 10) and I really got into it today.  We just<br/>
got it and I can tell it&#39;s a keeper.   You can google it and read more about<br/>
it.  I know they sell it on Amazon but I got it at a Discovery toys party.<br/>

 And we&#39;ve been here for 3 years.  Well, I don&#39;t curl up so much. <br/>

<br/>
One of the coolest things about it is that you can handicap dads and teenaged <br/>
game/puzzle whizzes by just giving them more goal cards.   That way younger <br/>
kids or those newer to strategy games, having fewer cards to &quot;win,&quot; will still <br/>
have a fair chance.<br/>

Gail, New Mexico has no hurricanes expected, nor earthquakes.<br/>
<br/>
Do NOT, though, think of England and then order &quot;fish and chips&quot; at Shoney&#39;s <br/>
at Menaul and Louisiana.    The first question they will ask you is &quot;what kind <br/>
of potatoes do you want?&quot;   Because mashed or baked is okay-fine with them.   <br/>
And the fish was wrong and the chips were french fries.   I nearly curled up <br/>
and cried.   Should&#39;ve ordered green chile stew.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028663714">Hi from Wales, UK.   :o)<br/>
 <br/>
When I&#39;m having down days about moving (mostly from times I didn&#39;t<br/>
understand the different culture and it caused some kind of<br/>
extra stress).  I often think of what people in the AF often say while still<br/>
getting settled in somewhere new.  They have a saying<br/>
that people say &quot;The last base or place you just left was always the best!!&quot;<br/>
(even if you really disliked it while you were there &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
   <br/>
I moved about 5 times while in the military (in 10 years) and have now done<br/>
two major moves (next 10 years) since getting out and everytime <br/>
this has been true even though we wanted to move everytime.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
 <br/>
It does get better and easier as you find all the good things about the new<br/>
place and all the unknowns of the new place are replaced.<br/>
 <br/>

life became much easier once I figured out that Hayden&#39;s self-imposed <br/>
end of caffeine use may have had a *bit* to do with his grouchiness <br/>
:::duh, mom::: My attitude adjustment + end of withdrawals = a very <br/>
joyful weekend for everyone! <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also excited to have our 14 year old calico kitty, Patches, rejoin <br/>
our family after more than a year at my parents&#39; home.  She gained more <br/>
than 10 lbs during her stay (I think it was depression) but is shedding <br/>
it quickly as she becomes active and social again.  It&#39;s so nice to have <br/>
her back (or nice to have *us* back, for her)<br/>

had an end date already decided, and when that time came he had a Dr Pepper and <br/>
went on without fanfare, with caffein.<br/>
