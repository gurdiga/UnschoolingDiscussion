&lt;&lt; Ick!  But aren&#39;t there some cultures that feel it is bad luck to praise<br/>
children that it makes the gods jealous and is just &quot;tempting fate&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not that I know of.  There are some who don&#39;t want to say &quot;My child is just <br/>
perfect,&quot; but it&#39;s a far reach from qualifying praise (&quot;He&#39;s really fast, but <br/>
sometimes he&#39;d rather run in the shade!&quot; so everyone can have a little laugh at <br/>
his expense without it belittling his true running speed) to just tearing <br/>
them up out of habit.<br/>
<br/>
And a lack of praise is still not the presence of insult.<br/>
<br/>
If someone takes a principle to mean they shouldn&#39;t talk about their child&#39;s <br/>
positive characteristics, like a religious stricture against gossiping,, that <br/>
should DEFINITELY keep them from listing their shortcomings.<br/>
<br/>
And often what parents are saying to each other doesn&#39;t even involve their <br/>
individual children. It&#39;s just that &quot;MY aren&#39;t we put-upon,&quot; attitude with &quot;YOU <br/>
know how kids are,&quot; and they want all the rest to agree tacitly or by nodding <br/>
and muttering that kids are awful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same kind of lame non-conversation as &quot;So, where do you go to <br/>
school? (response, not really listened to) &quot;What grade are you in?&quot;  (whatever <br/>
response, doesn&#39;t matter, the adult doesn&#39;t really care anyway), which is reported <br/>
later as &quot;I talked with your son.  Nice kid!&quot;<br/>
