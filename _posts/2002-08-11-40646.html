<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200925362">Recently I was asked by a friend to watch his two children. His daughter is <br/>
16 months, doesn&#39;t walk, talk and is obviously still in diapers. (she is <br/>
slightly developmentally delayed) His son is 5 months. I have wavered back <br/>
and forth. (His wife met him at the door one day last week, handed the baby <br/>
to him, said &quot;I need a break,&quot; and he hasn&#39;t seen her since.) I used to watch <br/>
my bestfriend&#39;s two children, her daughter is just 3 months younger than Jack <br/>
and her little boy is 22 months younger than her daughter. At one time I had <br/>
my two nursing, her two drinking the warmed up breast milk she stored in my <br/>
freezer, three in diapers and one in the process of potty training. I never <br/>
thought twice about loading them all up, going to the store or the park, or <br/>
carting them all around the library. It never occurred to me that life could <br/>
be any different with two toddlers or four. Not taking a shower until lunch <br/>
was over and everyone was asleep was standard for me. Board books, water <br/>
mats, finger paints, play-dough in the carpet, upchuck in my hair, I was <br/>
queen of my domain! I still had time to make a hearty soup and fresh bread <br/>
for all of us to enjoy at the end of the day, and my toilets sparkled. Why <br/>
now does the prospect of two more babies scare me? Now I can&#39;t imagine <br/>
including two little ones in all the activities my two are involved in. My <br/>
bestfriends kids are my kids, mine are hers. And although she and I don&#39;t see <br/>
eye to eye on the unschooling, we still support everything each other does. I <br/>
can&#39;t see myself taking my two and two babies to see her daughter dance, or <br/>
Moly act, or Jack to the skateboard park. Am I being selfish? I don&#39;t see <br/>
myself devoting large amounts of time to two new children and still giving <br/>
all the time I give now to my own kids. I feel like something would have to <br/>
give. How do those of you who still have babies at home find the time to *be* <br/>
and *do* with your older ones? I guess my problem is I&#39;m not quite the queen <br/>
of my domain that I used to be. My bread doesn&#39;t get baked as often as it <br/>
used too, I find that cleaning the bathroom once a week with a wipe down <br/>
sometime, gets it *almost* as good as cleaning it three times a week used to <br/>
get it. I so badly want to say, &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll watch your kids, no problem!&quot; but, <br/>
my brain says NOOOOO!!!! What to do? And I feel bad.<br/>

Max only did one out of the three which was walking and at 16 months, he had<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I know 16 month olds aren&#39;t usually potty trained, walking or talking <br/>
well. Jack didn&#39;t walk till he was 15 months, he didn&#39;t talk until way after <br/>
his second birthday, and then not well until he was past three. But we know <br/>
she is developmentally delayed. She just learned to sit up, she doesn&#39;t crawl <br/>
well yet, and she is very rigid. She lays in what I call the frog position, <br/>
on her back, legs bent at the hips and knees so that her legs are splayed <br/>
out, but her feet are close together, arms bent at the elbows, fist closed <br/>
and up by her head. She even keeps that position when sitting up, for the <br/>
first few minutes until she is sure she has her balance. <br/>
These are great, beautiful kids. I guess I just needed to rant, enough to <br/>
convince myself it was okay to say no. (I have a hard time with that.) <br/>

could all get together a schedule of taking the kids until he can find<br/>
something more permanent. That way no one person shoulders the whole burden.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1140230604">I have two nephews and a niece that have &quot;issues&quot;. It is very hard to watch<br/>
the difficulties they face and not want to sweep them up and take care of<br/>
them.<br/>
My niece is the best off, she is only sad about life. (!)<br/>
one dnephew has pretty severe issues steming from Fetal Alcohol syndrome,<br/>
his older brother has experienced sexual abuse, emotional abuse and has tons<br/>
of learning differences.<br/>
Their mother is a disgusting creature. I despise her. My Step-mom told me<br/>
that she has been panhandling in the intersections for money with a homeless<br/>
sign around her neck. She&#39;s hardly homeless She&#39;s a heroin addict and at the<br/>
end stages of Alcoholism. She&#39;s 36 years old and needs a liver transplant<br/>
yet can not be considered a good candidate because she drinks still.<br/>
My brother is so weak he enables her (Although she is not living with them<br/>
now, Thank goodness.)<br/>
Wow, what a vent. I have been faced with this daily since moving back to the<br/>
family compound.<br/>
We are living in a unit in the building my Dad lives in and my brother and<br/>
his kids live inthe building also.<br/>
His kids spend the majority of time in our tiny apartment, I am honored for<br/>
them to be so trusting of me. I just wish when we move to W.Va I could bring<br/>
the two who are here so much with us.<br/>

~Nancy<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I&#39;m envious that your bathroom gets cleaned once a week,<br/>
mine gets &quot;wiped down&quot; by the kids once a week and a good cleaning from<br/>
either me or my husband every other week.  As far as the bread goes, I<br/>
use a bread machine now.  My father says that I must be the only person<br/>
in the world who actually uses their bread machine everyday, I&#39;m not so<br/>
sure about that, but it sure has saved me a lot of time.<br/>
Now, as for watching other people&#39;s children.  I did that for a year,<br/>
for a very good friend of mine.  Our kids were close in age, I thought<br/>
that would help.  They were going to school, so we really only had them<br/>
in the afternoon and on their days off.  But it was hard.  Most of our<br/>
days were cut in half because my kids and I would have to sit outside<br/>
their school waiting for them at 1:30 everyday.  No longer could we go<br/>
to the beach for the day, or take off for the children&#39;s museum (we are<br/>
kind of culturally isolated here and need to travel for an hour for a<br/>
museum or the like).  Besides that, since we unschooled and they didn&#39;t,<br/>
they would spend their afternoons doing homework (actually with me<br/>
reminding them that their mom wanted their homework done, while they<br/>
struggled with sitting there and not playing).<br/>
We don&#39;t watch them anymore, we still play with them a lot, but we were<br/>
starting not to like each other anymore.  So the best decision for us<br/>
was to say no, sorry.  I felt guilty for a while, I watched their mom<br/>
struggle with what to do with them, watched her dole out a lot of money<br/>
for a private school that would keep them extra hours.  It was hard and<br/>
I felt bad.  But we remained friends and I&#39;m not sure we would have if I<br/>
had kept watching her kids.<br/>
And for the icing on the cake, they are now being homeschooled.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nancy, <br/>
As someone whose parents raised two of my cousins, I hope for your children&#39;s <br/>
sake you won&#39;t say yes too easily.  Yes, it was a generous and big-hearted <br/>
thing for my parents to do, but it wasn&#39;t always best for me and my sister.  <br/>
I did NOT have a relationship with my sister until we were nearly grown, <br/>
because when we played or did or sat or whatever, she was with the younger <br/>
cousin and I was with the older cousin.  Otherwise, I would have done lots of <br/>
things with my sister, but we didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The ages were (in a snapshot moment):  <br/>
Nada 11 months<br/>
ME    10 and four months<br/>
Nadine 8<br/>
Irene 7   (my sister)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It kept me from being the oldest.  It made Irene the youngest of four instead <br/>
of the younger of two.  Irene never had her own room, ever.  (I had a <br/>
half-underground canning room for my room after I was 14, and it was better <br/>
than sharing, but it wasn&#39;t the real bedroom I would have had to myself the <br/>
whole time otherwise.)<br/>
<br/>
Nadine sexually abused Irene.  We didn&#39;t know until Irene was grown because <br/>
she was legitimately afraid to tell.<br/>

I have 3 children, ds (8), dd (4) and ds2 (2).<br/>

<br/>
For the first year or so I did the school-at-home approach which left my son free when the daycare girls got home from school.

Involving them doesn&#39;t work (maybe this is a product of them being in ps?). This has been a particular problem over the summer.

My advice is, Nancy, that unless you absolutely HAVE to take on someone else&#39;s children it is probably wiser not to, especially if you are doing so out of a sense of duty or obligation.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2065900045">I can imagine that having a home daycare is difficult - <br/>
<br/>
For me - I can&#39;t wait until the neighborhood kids go back to school - although I have to say - I would rather have them all here than my kids somewhere else - <br/>
<br/>
In any case - I sometimes feel like I would like to have my kids to myself. Anytime we set foot outside we are swarmed with the neighbors kids - they are back and forth over each other&#39;s houses - but sometimes I&#39;d like to just do playdough - or whatever with my 3 - instead of 6.  I guess I would make a really bad ps teacher  :)  can&#39;t imagine 30 at a time!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For the first year or so I did the school-at-home approach which left my son <br/>
&gt; free when the daycare girls got home from school. Now with an unschooling <br/>
&gt; approach I find it very difficult to engage my children in any meaningful <br/>
&gt; activity or conversation when the girls  are around. Involving them doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; work (maybe this is a product of them being in ps?). This has been a <br/>
&gt; particular problem over the summer. So many great opportunities for my kids <br/>
&gt; have had to take a backseat to allow me to be available to provide daycare. <br/>
&gt; We can&#39;t go very far because we have to be there for someone to arrive or <br/>
&gt; be picked up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is exactly what I am afraid will happen. I am afraid it will be a snowy <br/>
day, Jack won&#39;t be able to walk or ride his bike to the community center for <br/>
his early morning Karate, and I won&#39;t have enough seat belts in the car for <br/>
two carseats, my kids, me and (sometimes) one or both of my bestfriends kids. <br/>
The only one old enough to leave at home for the 5 minute trip is Moly, and I <br/>
hate to do that. So I think I will take everyone&#39;s advice and not do what I <br/>
wish in my heart I could do, but know in my brain would be bad for my family. <br/>
Joyce had a good suggestion to help him co-op his child care and I know of <br/>
many low-income resources through the mother-to-mother program I volunteer <br/>
with. Most are for children and mothers, but I think I can help him get <br/>
around the mother part. <br/>
Thanks to all for listening to my vent! It really helps to bounce things off <br/>
better minds than mine! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

;) So it doesn&#39;t ever quiet down? - Well, I keep telling myself I&#39;d rather have them all here - then my kids somewhere else... although I wasn&#39;t to happy when my 4 year old and his friend somehow made off with my digital camera into a &quot;secret hiding place&quot; that is so secret they can no longer find it! I guess you just have to laugh about it!<br/>
