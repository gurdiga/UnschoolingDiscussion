The lolly van gave me and my dh a good laugh! Never a dull moment! I found my <br/>
17 month old atop the computer munching chips when i left the room for a <br/>
second!LOL! This weekend the real ice cream truck started making its rounds <br/>
around here and i caught my 5 yo son just in time as he turned the corner to <br/>
cross the street at top speed, clutching his tupperware container filled with <br/>
pennies!LOL!~Spring is here!<br/>
