<div id="ygrps-yiv-618032331">Nancy,<br/>
<br/>
Congratulations!  On both your baby and for the way unschooling is <br/>
working for your family!  That is sooo terrific that your daughters <br/>
have adjusted so quickly and that you are comfortable with <br/>
unschooling them!<br/>
<br/>
Our 4th child is scheduled for c-section on Friday morning and I <br/>
could relate to your description of your recent pregnancy.  <br/>
Unschooling just seems to fit into all of the rhythyms of life and <br/>
even allows Mom to be sick or busy with the baby or a million other <br/>
things, while the other children are free to do the things that <br/>
interest them.  They also really seem to learn how to help each other <br/>
and take care of the people around them.  I couldn&#39;t even imagine <br/>
having this baby and being on my children&#39;s school timetable!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and I&#39;d love to hear more about how your days are going!<br/>
<br/>
Chris<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  One of the things my children like is doing mad-libs on the <br/>
internet or the ones from Scholastic.  They are fun for all of us!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-236188801">Hi Nancy...you are doing fine. Just let them keep doing it. There are a<br/>
lot of free worksheets you can download and print off the internet. Do a<br/>
search on yahoo for worksheets. Here&#39;s a few to get you started...<br/>

My daughter Naomi would like a couple more penpals and would be willing<br/>
to email or snail mail with your daughters. She is 10 and I pulled her<br/>
out of ps 5 weeks ago. She&#39;s pretty much doing the same thing as your<br/>
girls...barbies, playing catch, walks with mom, learning how to cook<br/>
(today we made chocolate cake from scratch and a loaf of homemade bread).<br/>
She hasn&#39;t really done a lot of things with worksheets but she does like<br/>
the puzzle mazes and word finds that I have gotten for her from online.<br/>
Oh...there&#39;s another one you might want to check out...its called<br/>
suite101. I think the link is:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am new to this list. I am a sahm/wahm from Michigan (Detroit area) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; and I just took my girls out of public school in January. My <br/>
&gt; daughters <br/>
&gt; are almost 11 years old (12 in April) and almost 9 years old (9 in <br/>
&gt; May). I also have an almost 7 week old son.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I noticed, after reading some of the postings, that some of you have <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; daughters who are my kid&#39;s ages. Would any of your girls want to <br/>
&gt; become e-mail pals with my girls? They have been asking me every day <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; about finding some pen pals who also home school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I fell into this unschooling thing --- I was pregnant, miserable and <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; tired, so they pretty much guided themselves to what they wanted to <br/>
&gt; learn when I first took them out of public school in January. Then, <br/>
&gt; when my son was born, well ... you all know what it&#39;s like having a <br/>
&gt; newborn --- so they kept pursuing their own interests because of the <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; demands of the baby. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This unschooling thing seems very natural --- just like it felt when <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; they were very small and I taught them throughout the day --- or <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; investigated the world around them on their own. However, on the <br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; hand, I feel like I should be giving them more structure and so do <br/>
&gt; they --- they want worksheets and assignments. I bought some <br/>
&gt; worksheet books and they use them occasionally. But mostly they love <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; to play Barbie&#39;s, make doll clothes, draw, write, read, do computer <br/>
&gt; games or play with Lego&#39;s. Hmmm. I&#39;m just new to this and trying to <br/>
&gt; adjust ...  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any advice? I&#39;m thinking I&#39;m doing okay and should just keep doing <br/>
&gt; what I&#39;m doing, but then the guilt sets in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>

Thanks so much for all those links! A few of them look familiar --- I <br/>
think I printed off a few things from homeschoolzone.com and <br/>
freeworksheets.com. I can&#39;t wait to check the others out!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll contact you via e-mail about the pen pal thing.<br/>

<br/>
Good luck with the C-section. I had one with my second child, who is <br/>
now almost 9 years old. Is this your first C-section? My son was born <br/>
on Jan. 25 vaginally (VBAC) after 27 hours of labor that was <br/>
induced...OUCH! But when it came time to push, THAT part only took 15 <br/>
minutes!<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the decision to home school,ummm,I mean, unschool...was made at <br/>
the right time. It was wonderful during the last month of my<br/>
pregnancy <br/>
and during the first weeks of our son&#39;s life, to have my girls around <br/>
all day long. We didn&#39;t have to wake up early and head out into the <br/>
ugly Michigan winter early in the morning, either! And they would&#39;ve <br/>
had a hard time leaving their precious baby brother and heading off<br/>
to <br/>
school! They have enjoyed him so much ... my 11-year-old, Natalie, <br/>
said that she could just sit and look at him all day long.<br/>
<br/>
And I can actually get a shower in, or sometimes, a nice, long hot <br/>
bath (if I let myself) during the day while they keep him entertained.<br/>
<br/>
Again, good luck on Friday and let us know how you are doing <br/>
afterward!<br/>
<br/>
~Nancy<br/>
P.S. I&#39;ll check out that Mad Libs thing you mentioned! I don&#39;t know <br/>
what they are, but I&#39;m sure my kids do and they&#39;ll roll their eyes at <br/>
me and say &quot;you don&#39;t know what Mad Libs are?&quot;<br/>
