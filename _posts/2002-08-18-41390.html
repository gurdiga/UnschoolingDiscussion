 </span></blockquote>Hey, Dar!<br/>
<br/>
If you fly into Frankfurt (lots of cheap flights come into there), drop me<br/>
an email.  I could meet you at the airport and head you off onto the trains<br/>
or whatever.  (The digs at my place ain&#39;t fancy, but durn cheap!)<br/>
<br/>
FYI, if you&#39;re looking at train tickets: unless you actually figure out the<br/>
days, prices, etc, and know that Eurorail passes will be worth it for your<br/>
family, it may be cheaper to take advantage of special fares from in<br/>
country.  (Family &quot;Happy Weekend&quot; tickets are about $25, for example)  Email<br/>
me off line for more info.<br/>
