<br/>
Not really. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You feel a need to know something exactly which doesn&#39;t exactly exist!<br/>
<br/>
Is there one moment in which she can get into college, after which she has <br/>
missed the boat forever and ever?<br/>
<br/>
NO.  *That* is an important thing to know!  She&#39;s twelve years old.  When <br/>
she&#39;s fifteen, maybe she could take a course or two at a community college <br/>
and see how she likes it.  Maybe she&#39;ll love it and be a sophomore by the <br/>
time she might want to take an SAT test.  And she might never ever need to <br/>
take one.<br/>
<br/>
If you live for six years from now, you could mess up today!<br/>
<br/>
And she might not want to go to college when she&#39;s 18.  Maybe later.  Maybe <br/>
never.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174235238">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I just had a conversation about this with two of my friends. Their <br/>
agita about homeschooling is that their kids (who are just 5 years <br/>
old) will never get accepted into college. SIGH! Anyhow, one of my <br/>
jobs while working on my BA was at the admissions office of NYUs <br/>
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences. I also worked as a Spanish & <br/>
Portuguese Adjunct Instructor who was also a mentor for both <br/>
undegrads and beginning graduate students. Granted, I worked for 3 <br/>
years at the graduate school admission&#39;s office, but because the <br/>
office shared information with the undergraduate admissions office; <br/>
and because my department would make me the &#39;mamma&#39; of many lost <br/>
souls, let me clue you into a couple of things:<br/>
<br/>
+ Universities have a dirty little secret when it comes to the <br/>
admissions process. There are those that come through the <br/>
&quot;floodgates&quot; (the admissions office) and there are those who get in <br/>
&quot;pre-accepted&quot; by the heads of the departments. What does this mean?<br/>
<br/>
THE INTERVIEW is the unwritten rule for getting into a lot of <br/>
universities I worked in or had friends working in (NYU, Columbia <br/>
Univ, Yale, Hardvard, all the CUNYs, Rutgers Newark & New Brunswick).<br/>
<br/>
Getting admittance into a department is just like getting a job: The <br/>
higher up in the eschelons you get, the more likely you are to get to <br/>
the right person that will accept you. In the world of colleges, that <br/>
means:<br/>
<br/>
Research not only the place but the people: Kids should not go <br/>
&#39;green&#39; to college --they really should have an idea of what their <br/>
major is going to be. This does not only mean reading the catalog of <br/>
courses, but getting familiar with the work of their future <br/>
professors. This means, reading their articles or books and, if <br/>
possible, even sitting in some classes. The more they get to know a <br/>
place or a department, the less likely your son or daughter will <br/>
waste their time (and your money) in what we used to call at the <br/>
admissions office a &#39;bs BA&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Never underestimate the power of a handshake: Time and again I would <br/>
hear some of my bosses say, &quot;wouldn&#39;t it be nice if more kids came in <br/>
so we could meet them&quot;. The ones that detested the idea were the ones <br/>
that, well, were the &#39;superstars&#39; who would have to do the tour of <br/>
duty of chairing the department but could not wait to get holed up in <br/>
their lairs to ponder about the pluperfect. It is from those <br/>
interviews (and not from &#39;connections&#39;) that came a lot of the kids <br/>
accepted with scholarships. I cannot begin to stress how important it <br/>
is to not only have an interview but to grill them about what they <br/>
have to offer. It shows determination and commitment. Two people are <br/>
key for these interviews:<br/>
<br/>
Chairperson of the Department<br/>
Department&#39;s Undergraduate Director<br/>
<br/>
At big schools like NYU this is crucial because the Dean of <br/>
Undergraduate Studies can only offer guidance to the College at <br/>
large. In some instances they have a division that deals with <br/>
school-wide scholarships but these might be separate from the ones <br/>
that could be arranged through a department. Also, the DUS cannot <br/>
really counsel most of the time on which would be the best program to <br/>
join (within a department).<br/>
<br/>
+ Then there is the revered &#39;high school diploma&#39;. I am going to go <br/>
with the big school analogy here again. A lot of colleges have 2 <br/>
undergraduate programs: one for high school kids and one for people <br/>
with &#39;unconventional educational backgrounds&#39;. These programs offer <br/>
day and night courses and nowadays even e-courses. A student that <br/>
does not get into NYUs conventional BA/BS colleges can still get a <br/>
diploma from Gallatin or the School of Professional Studies. And in <br/>
most cases you can still get student aid or even scholarships (there <br/>
are not as many as in the conventional colleges but there is still <br/>
some --you have to research it based on the intended field of study).<br/>
<br/>
Given the job market that we live in (and my years at the GAS) I can <br/>
tell you that, unless your son or daughter is going into a sales or <br/>
marketing job, for professional advancement, almost all jobs nowadays <br/>
require graduate course degrees. The only jobs that I know of that do <br/>
not are as &#39;creatives&#39; in advertisement (although you need to have an <br/>
art/writing background) and certainly in the worlds of software and <br/>
web development ---a good software programmer or information <br/>
architect is worth her weight in gold no matter what kind of degree <br/>
(if any) she has.<br/>
<br/>
SATs are important for the &#39;grind&#39; of admissions offices. Transcripts <br/>
and SATs are for the bureaucrats --they are there anyway, to weed <br/>
away the thousands of applicants colleges like Columbia of Rutgers <br/>
get in a year. A portfolio, an interview and if possible an auditing <br/>
relationship with professors of a department are most likely going to <br/>
open more doors than just a high SAT score and a perfect transcript.<br/>
<br/>
Which begs the question --yeah, but what if my kids wants to go to <br/>
college to a whole other time zone? Again, it all comes down to: can <br/>
you afford it? Because if they want the kind of college experience <br/>
most kids have (the bs BA), it might not be worth to get a second <br/>
mortgage on the house for that. They will probably end up in jobs <br/>
that will anyway require them to go to graduate school (there is such <br/>
a demand for jobs nowadays that a diploma, nor even a perfect BA <br/>
transcript is likely going to get yor kids a high paying job).<br/>
<br/>
Still, by the time they do have to go for a graduate degree, the Ivy <br/>
League or top-ten graduate school diploma would make sense. At this <br/>
time also, either the job will pay for it or your kid will be able to <br/>
claim it as a professional deduction on their tax returns. And if you <br/>
do choose then to go for that second mortgage to help them, you will <br/>
have the piece of mind to know that with a JD or MD they will be able <br/>
to pay it back.<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t worry about your child&#39;s unconventional education. There are <br/>
still a lot of options for them at the top colleges of the nation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219469856">Hey Tuck,<br/>
<br/>
He he he he. You may be right. I am just relaying my experience. As <br/>
we say in Puerto Rico, &quot;así es como se bate el cobre&quot;. That&#39;s how you <br/>
forge ahead  --it may not be nice, but it is an honest take on this <br/>
process.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that an Ivy League graduate diploma can have a HUGE <br/>
impact on your starting salary for certain jobs. Not in the computer <br/>
tech world, though; but certainly in most traditional professions <br/>
(medicine, law, architecture, engineering, business). I am talking <br/>
about a 20-50K difference in pay per year (race and gender are also <br/>
factors in the equation). I know this for a fact because one of my <br/>
sisters in law graduate from Yale and her offers were 20K higher than <br/>
for guys coming out of NY Law School but 30K lower than guys from her <br/>
class with no job experience. It is insane.<br/>
<br/>
In some CompTech jobs having a CompSci or engineering degree is not <br/>
seen necessarily as an advantage. But you&#39;re right, my experience <br/>
comes from the NY and from friends scattered about in the Northeast.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, I don&#39;t take it personally. Higher education is a class <br/>
&#39;thang&#39; in NY, though. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t want to have anything to do <br/>
with it. But for those who want to tread in those waters, it is the <br/>
most honest advice I can give.<br/>
<br/>

Lindsborg, Kansas. In the fall of my junior year, which was my last semester <br/>
of highschool, (I hated my home life and worked extra hard to get all my <br/>
credits and finish school early) I went to Bethany and sang for the music <br/>
department-heads and took samples of my art work to the art department. I was <br/>
accepted by both. I explained that although I was only 15, I would be turning <br/>
16 in November and would be graduating at the end of the semester and, &quot;Could <br/>
I please enter Bethany at the spring semester, rather than waiting until the <br/>
next fall?&quot; They had absolutely no problem with me doing so. Only one <br/>
professor had reservations that I would be much younger than many of my dorm <br/>
mates, and did I think I would be able to handle the pressures? I responded <br/>
that I had worked so hard to make this goal and that I thought no pressure <br/>
could be as hard as what I had just about finished. Although I never <br/>
finished, having dropped after 2 1/2 years, I have always been glad of the <br/>
pre-acceptance. I would have had to wait another year to go to college <br/>
traditionally.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I will take this as a resounding thank you for being able to provide <br/>
you with some insight into that world. There are not thousands, but <br/>
millions of people for whom this kind of elitist world is a reality <br/>
(whether at school or work). If your kids want to step into it, they <br/>
might as well do it well informed.<br/>
<br/>
I am particularly of the school of thought that not everybody should <br/>
go to college in their teens. Nowadays, even public higher education <br/>
is getting to be expensive. Many kids do not understand the cost of <br/>
incurring in all those student loans just to get to college (believe <br/>
me, I am one of them). If anything, teenagers should spend 3-4 years <br/>
looking for jobs in industries they may be interested in. Even if it <br/>
means working in a hospital cafeteria because one day he or she may <br/>
want to become a doctor. So many kids go to college without knowing <br/>
anything about the professions they want to join. It&#39;s really sad and <br/>
infuriating because the business of universities is to keep students, <br/>
hopefully, for ever.<br/>
<br/>
If you did not like the business of primary education, you will be <br/>
horrified at the business of higher education. It is after all a <br/>
trillion dollar industry supported by the government and industry. <br/>
Even your tax dollars go to private universities with billion dollar <br/>
endowments like New York University (yep, that&#39;s 1billion in private <br/>
endowments, not counting what they get in tax-supported money from <br/>
the government).<br/>
<br/>
The good news is that homeschoolers seem to have the skills necessary <br/>
for going to college. They have the people, researching and inquiring <br/>
skills needed to seize the day. Many have some kind of first hand <br/>
experience on what they want to major. Again, I can&#39;t even begin to <br/>
stress how important this is.<br/>
<br/>
The interesting thing for me are the kids who are unschooling their <br/>
way through college. In this month&#39;s HEM there is that article I <br/>
mentioned and I hope Peter gets to write a more in depth article <br/>
about this phenomenon. One young woman finished 4 years of college <br/>
without a diploma --she took all the courses she wanted; in effect, <br/>
she unschooled her way through 4 years of college.<br/>
<br/>
I find this interesting because, if she decides to go to the route of <br/>
getting a graduate degree; she would actually be able to do so. Yes, <br/>
even without high school and BA diplomas. There is a whole side of <br/>
the private higher education industry ---NYU, Yale, Columbia and <br/>
Harvard have programs that I know of--- that caters to these <br/>
untraditional students (and have been doing it for about 15 years <br/>
now). Their admissions process is completely different from the one <br/>
traditional students go through AND YET they all end up in the same <br/>
courses. What is different is the name of the division or college <br/>
they graduated from (within the university) and who ends up caring if <br/>
you graduated from the Liberal Arts (or whatever they call it) <br/>
program of Harvard? It is still Harvard.<br/>
<br/>
Do I want my kids to go to Harvard? I want my kids to do whatever <br/>
they want --even if it means never setting foot at a university EVER. <br/>
Again, my husband and I have chosen to live an untraditional life <br/>
--and I have more degrees than most people. Actually, I think it <br/>
would freak me out a bit if they chose to be plain 9 to 5ers --we are <br/>
considered to be professional slackers after all (notwithstanding the <br/>
fact that I work an average of 7 hours a day ON TOP OF HOMESCHOOLING <br/>
and homemaking). I barely sleep, but that is a whole other matter.<br/>
<br/>
