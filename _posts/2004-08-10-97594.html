<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048077775">Wow Pam. Good list.<br/>
Reading these words brings back so many memories for me.  I did my student<br/>
teaching as a ps music teacher back in Delaware and left the field shortly<br/>
thereafter.  The word that jumped out at me reading your list was<br/>
enrichment.  When you see the word &quot;enriched&quot; on a package of bread at the<br/>
store it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s healthier than the other breads.  Rather it means<br/>
the flour they used was so processed it had practically nothing of any<br/>
nutritional value left so they had to add some vitamins back in to make it<br/>
better.  Still, way worse than a nice whole grain bread.  It&#39;s the same at<br/>
school.   Enrichment, when you can get it, is only there to try to<br/>
ameliorate the woeful inadequacies of schooling children.<br/>
<br/>
The other word that jumped off the screen for me was Socializing.  I can<br/>
just hear the tone of voice used by my fellow teachers when they&#39;d say that<br/>
word.  &quot;I had to move his seat because the kids in the back are always<br/>
socializing.&quot;</div>

Sometimes I think that  so many adults  don&#39;t know what to make of  children.( especially active, enthusiastic  kids.<br/>
 The ones that don&#39;t act detached  from the adults  around them.   I see so many people look at them with bemusement, surprise.<br/>
The  &quot;100 School Terms&quot; list makes me think of children as &quot;consumer products&quot;. Have them, feed, clothe them, educate them according to the products available. Give them to the &quot;state&quot; to  provide  an income  from managing them (bldgs. staff. experts-seminars-products-producers-)<br/>
&quot;Children  are to use&quot; even provide &quot;reasons&quot; for  some women to justify themselves-then off  to public school when having them around all day is  annoying.<br/>
I am sure this is too vague but the &quot;100&quot; just   has me babbling on.<br/>

We never had personal development, but I know there is a campaign in the <br/>
schools here lately, which Senator Pete Dominici initiated, and as he&#39;s a New <br/>
Mexico senator, I don&#39;t know whether it&#39;s local or not.   It&#39;s called &quot;Character <br/>
Counts&quot; and there are billboards, and I know it&#39;s a school program.   There <br/>
will be virtuous attributes put up on billboards, like integrity, <br/>
trustworthiness, honesty.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s that.  Morality.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123628106">One of the women at my job had made a tree out of construction paper <br/>
and hung it on the wall.  The leaves were individual hearts with <br/>
inspiring words on them.  One word that stuck out was &quot;obedience&quot;.  <br/>
I&#39;ve looked at this tree over and over, but I just can&#39;t see how <br/>
obedience fits in with words like faith, love and happiness.  My co-<br/>
worker is a devout Pentecostal who believes that God created us and <br/>
he can destroy us if we make him mad, therefore we should be <br/>
obedient to Him.  To me, it sounds strange and maybe even far-<br/>
fetched to believe that our God, who is supposed to care about us, <br/>
would have a temper bad enough to destroy us.  I just don&#39;t buy the <br/>
whole obedience thing.  <br/>
<br/>
But, isn&#39;t it similar to what we feared in school?  That if we <br/>
weren&#39;t obedient to the school we would be punished or worse?  Are <br/>
teachers, who are supposed to care about their students, God with <br/>
the power to create or destroy them?  I know there are even parents <br/>
out there that think they have the power to create or destroy their <br/>
children.  <br/>
<br/>
The sad part is that teachers and some parents really can destroy a <br/>
child simply by throwing a label on them such as gifted or learning <br/>
disabled or a behavior problem, which will follow them the rest of <br/>
their lives.     <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014705766">These &quot;100 terms&quot; remind me of the first grade teacher my youngest child had.  It was a horrible year, where she learned a lot  of &quot;academics&quot;, but had recurring tummy aches all year long.  The teacher ended up accusing her of faking it, so I took her to the doctor and discovered she had a bladder infection.  She had deep circles under her eyes all year long.  I deeply regret not pulling her out.  Since she was a &quot;good girl,&quot;  I kept hoping she&#39;d stay under the radar and survive.    <br/>
<br/>
This teacher has never been a mother herself, was a complete control freak, thought she had the most organized program in the world (which she did ~ very anal).  She expected high school level discipline and attention spans from those first graders (made them sit at their desks for up to 2 hours on Friday mornings taking tests), and her classroom management techniques were very harsh (she had this weird &quot;reward&quot; system where she passed out baseball tradering cards that none of the kids cared about).  As I said, my daughter was a &quot;good girl&quot; and learned to stay out of trouble, but as a former special ed teacher my heart bled for the slow learners or those with minor &quot;behavior problems&quot; made to feel they were bad, eventually losing hope of ever pleasing her.  <br/>
<br/>
We parents complained to the principal, who did nothing that year or the next.  But because parents finally threatened lawsuits, she was transferred out.  I once witnessed a kid (diagnosed as ADHD, assigned a full-time aide who the teacher wouldn&#39;t let sit with him) wheeled away on a stretcher in a straight-jacket (with his mom sobbing behind and not allowed to ride in the ambulance), taken to the mental health ward of the local hospital where he was kept for a week with a bunch of nutty adults ~ all because this teacher had called 911 and said the kid was out of control and the office wouldn&#39;t help her (they told her to manage until they could find an administrator to come to the room.  She said he was throwing chairs around the room, but my daughter said he was just scooting around the room on the teacher&#39;s chair with wheels.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m told that a number of kids in her second grade class last year started wetting their pants. I will always regret not pulling my child or taking a stronger stand against this woman who did so much harm.    <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, my kids can heal from their negative experiences in school, and from the damage done by their recovering control-freak mom!!  This will be my first year homeschooling.  I&#39;ve been fascinated by all the info on unschooling I&#39;ve learned through this discussion group.  Thanks to all of you for sharing such eye-opening, thought-provoking postings!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-478029850">&lt;&lt;&lt;Getting ready to talk about unschooling at the HSC conference and I <br/>
went through some websites designed to help teachers - and pulled off a <br/>
hundred terms that appeared frequently and which I have something to <br/>
say about, in relation to unschooling. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had revisited the list of words again, and was trying to think of<br/>
something clever - without success. I was suddenly struck by some words in<br/>
the above paragraph. &quot;Designed to help teachers&quot;. Not &quot;to help students&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder teachers find their work difficult. Look at the number of words on<br/>
this list that are negative - the focus is absolutely on problems and the<br/>
expectation of an endless series of problems and difficulties. Even the<br/>
neutral seeming words like &quot;Grading&quot; certainly have a negative component -<br/>
eg the bell curve means someone has to get an &quot;F&quot;, &quot;Solutions&quot; - there must<br/>
be a problem for there to be a solution to it. BTW I don&#39;t know what<br/>
&quot;Pull-Outs&quot; means, I guess nothing to do with Pull-ups. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Probably from an Unschooling perspective, almost the entire list represent<br/>
horrible circumstances for schooled children, and yet remain for us an<br/>
irrelevant multitude.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting you cull the School Terms list, since I know that is not<br/>
your intention. I was just kind of auditing the list. The above words would<br/>
be the subset from the main list that are surely negatively predictive -<br/>
seen from a schooling context. (I include Special Needs as negative *only*<br/>
from that perspective - something that needs correcting with special<br/>
attention).<br/>
<br/>
No wonder our lives look so extraordinary (to bring in an idea from another<br/>
thread) since we focus constantly on strengths and good stuff - as the<br/>
difficult to cull list of unschooling words shows.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that you are making a presentation to a largely mixed group of<br/>
homeschoolers and possible future homeschoolers, with a few Unschoolers<br/>
thrown in, with a view to showing how great Unschooling can be. How it<br/>
differs both from school and curriculum based homeschooling. Is this right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s interesting to investigate words that are intersecting - the<br/>
same word with hugely different meanings in the two contexts. Boredom,<br/>
Expectations, Experts (whom we tend regard either as service providers,<br/>
ourselves, or with a very jaundiced eye), Learning, Instructions (like for a<br/>
video game?), Limits (a great discussion on U/B recently), Progress, Work<br/>
(&quot;Play is the work of childhood&quot; - who said that?), Structure.<br/>
<br/>
How to cull the other list:<br/>
<br/>
Acceptance  active  appreciation  artistic  attention  authentic  available<br/>
awareness  beauty  brilliant  caring  challenge  choice  closeness<br/>
community  companionship  compassion  confidence  connections  contemplation<br/>
conversation  courage  creative  curiosity  dabbling  easy  empowerment<br/>
endeavors  energy  engaged  environment  everything  excitement  experience<br/>
experimentation  explore  facilitator  family  feelings  figure out  flow<br/>
focus  freedom  games  generosity  gentleness genuine  growing-up  growth<br/>
hands-on  happiness  help  home  honor  ideas  imagination  immersion<br/>
independence  individual  information  integrated  interest  joy  kindness<br/>
knowledge  learning  life  lifestyle  listening  living  love  mastery<br/>
model  natural  needs  notice  nurture  observation  offer  opportunities<br/>
Passion  pathway  patience  perception  personality  philosophy  places<br/>
play  pleasure  preferences  presence  pretend  process  protect  questions<br/>
Quiet  real life  relationships  resources  responsible  rest  right  safe<br/>
serious  sharing  siblings  situations  songs  strengths  strew  success<br/>
Suggestions  support  talk about it  thinking  thought  time  together<br/>
Toys  trust  truth  understanding  unique  validate  value  voluntary<br/>
Whole  wisdom  wonder  work it out  world  yes<br/>
<br/>
(Yes I reformatted it by hand - you can thank me later, or not. ;) )<br/>
<br/>
Vijay suggested 12. Given the interesting discussion the word &quot;dabbling&quot;<br/>
aroused, maybe not that - OTOH if the aim is to entice people to explore<br/>
Unschooling further maybe you shouldn&#39;t scare them off with words that are<br/>
too school-negative, even if they are Unschool-positive. Again the idea of<br/>
looking at the intersections could be interesting. &quot;Environment&quot;,<br/>
&quot;Suggestion&quot; and &quot;Immersion&quot; are words that mean something different in<br/>
school and in Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I think one way to cull could be to look at some that are almost<br/>
redundancies - or to cheat by grouping some words as if they were one. The<br/>
idea behind Life/Lifestyle/Living/real life/situations could be represented<br/>
by one word on the list, but expanded on in the talk.<br/>
Integrated/connections/relationships - again maybe the word &quot;connections&quot;<br/>
would be enough. Family/siblings/home/closeness/relationships; talk about<br/>
it/questions/listening/presence/available; notice/observation/perception;<br/>
personality/unique/acceptance; strew/offer/opportunities/available;<br/>
pleasure/passion/happiness/joy; kindness/compassion/caring/gentleness;<br/>
artistic/creative/beauty/imagination (another set of concepts that is<br/>
totally different in school); Truth/authentic/genuine;<br/>
curiosity/dabbling/explore<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like &quot;Work it out&quot; - too much like &quot;sound it out&quot; - like being sent<br/>
to the encyclopedia instead of answered. I guess if a word or phrase would<br/>
require a lengthy explanation as to why it is a positive word if initially<br/>
it seems to have a negative connotation it might be better off the list. How<br/>
much time do you have for your presentation?<br/>
<br/>
This culling is tough work. I keep thinking of more words to add instead! <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it, Pam. I&#39;m sorry I won&#39;t be there to hear you. I&#39;ll miss<br/>
you in Peabody also (assuming you are the Pam not going).<br/>

list was made for teachers, not students.<br/>
<br/>
Pull-outs are what kids are pulled out of class for -- speech therapy, <br/>
gifted program, reading recovery, etc.<br/>
