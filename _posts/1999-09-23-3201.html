<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831477951"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Play is what kids (who are fortunate) get to do to sort out the world.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And here I thought play was the best route that EVERYONE had at their<br/>
disposal as a means to understanding the world.  For young children it is<br/>
the best tool at their command (although they also use &quot;acting out&quot;<br/>
&quot;Behavioral problems&quot; &quot;role reversal&quot; and all that other stuff)  but I<br/>
think it is one of the better tools for adults as well.  It&#39;s at the top of<br/>
MY list!  Reason, exploration, discussion, education, are all great and<br/>
wonderful things, but PLAY is right up there too, and sometimes better than<br/>
those.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-36477842">&quot;Play is the highest level of child development.  It is the spontaneous<br/>
expression of thought and feeling...It is the purest creation of the child&#39;s<br/>
mind as it is also a pattern and a copy of the natural life hidden in man<br/>
and in all things.&quot;--Friedrich Froebel<br/>

learning unfold yesterday with my 5yo dd.  She and her<br/>
brother were trying to make swings with chairs and<br/>
fabric. Using two points(two chairs) wasn&#39;t working so<br/>
she realized that she needed something else, third<br/>
point, to give the swing/chair more support. It was<br/>
cool to watch. (Or maybe that&#39;s how I saw it and my<br/>
kids were thinking something else entirely:)<br/>
