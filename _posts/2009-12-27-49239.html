<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072669911">Peace to you,<br/>
<br/>
You know I am one who feels that sometimes I have to call for no technology time.  I just have to.  When technology (wii, ds, computer, tv) begins to make my children act beastly and I am breaking up one fight after the other the technology is going off.<br/>
<br/>
I also did not sign up for technology to take over spending time with my kids.  So when I find that our person to person time is being eclipsed I will call no technology time.  They can do whatever they want in that time.<br/>
<br/>
Usually they finally tune into their body and realize that they are hungry, need to use the bathroom and then they will actually begin to talk to one another.<br/>
<br/>
I have often thought that this technique may be a bit out of line with unschooling philosophy but in my own experience i have had times when i have spent too much time doing something...like surfing the net or writing e-mail and time has passed and nothing has gotten done and i need to change what i am doing totally.<br/>
<br/>
I find that there are other choices in the world and am grateful that have finally pulled myself away to even realize this.<br/>
<br/>
My older son used to spend massive time but since getting time away from technology he is more balanced.  I don&#39;t even really have to call for down time for him.  He simply takes it and has other interests that he pursues passionately.<br/>
<br/>
My younger son is 6 and is just like my older son used to be.  He get drawn in to technology and will stay there hour after hour after hour....as a responsible mother...i have to get him up and moving after a while.  even if that means we go to the park or to the science museum.  I seek to educate my children and help them understand that technology cannot cause us to get tuned out from the world.<br/>
<br/>
but...again it is about balance...i need it and so do they.  i impose very few limits because i will get us up and going to the Y or park or wherever to get us up and doing other things besides engaging in technology everyday.<br/>
<br/>
This is what works for me.  I will say that I don&#39;t sweat it.  I don&#39;t worry.  I did worry more with the first son but eventually decided that worry is a waste of time.  My kids love being on the move so I schedule fieldtrips and go other places and go play with friends to create more balance.<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling I feel that it is all about the child staying in touch with his/her own innate wisdom.  I just don&#39;t have much to teach my kids and find that they learn just fine if I allow it.  However, as a leader in this family I will offer guidance especially if I see that there is some negative effect.<br/>
<br/>
An 8 year old who can&#39;t make eye contact due to a game will make me seek to connect with him more.  I might invite him to cook with me or to read with me or to go outside with me or garden with me.  I will extend invitations to give them choices.  I find that my kids take me up on it.  That way the option is always there to stay but there is another option to help them shift their energy.<br/>
<br/>
Hope I even make sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133763967">My son MD loves video games and plays a lot of it since he was a little over 4 and a half<br/>
I always say he learned to read playing Roblox on line.<br/>
He is 7 and a half years old.<br/>
This Summer he started playing basketball a lot with his dad. He had played some the year before and liked it but no major passion for it. <br/>
This Summer he really got into it. This is something that he does with dad and dad is a big time basketball guy. He always played and has even been a coach so he loves it.<br/>
THey go many times a week to play in the club now that there is too much snow to play many times a day at home.  <br/>
Dad is not a video games type o guy and even thou he sits there to watch him play many times it is not the same as basketball.<br/>
For Christmas MD got  3 games he really wanted to get and spent most o the day playing his games.<br/>
Brian turned to me on Christmas day and said that MD would be playing nothing but video games , meaning that he would not want to go play basketbal with him anymore for a while until the newness of the video games wore off.<br/>
I told him that maybe but that I think MD would still want to go play with him.<br/>
So yesterday after Brian was done with chores late morning he asked MD if he wanted to go play basketball with him ( that is a normal thing for them to do ). MD got ready in 5 minutes and was happy to go with dad not only play basketball but run some erands. He took his Nintento DS with one new game to play while in the car and running erands.<br/>
Because MD has NEVER been limited in his video game playing I think is much easier for him to let go now.<br/>
Brian was fearful that video games were going to keep MD from basketbal but his fears did not materialized.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191028503">-=-Here is what I believe.. &quot;There is nothing that you cannot be or do  <br/>
or have. And your work here�your lifetime career�is to seek joy&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
You have quotes around it as though it&#39;s someone else&#39;s words, but I  <br/>
want to address the stated belief.<br/>
The second half I don&#39;t mind, except &quot;career.&quot;  Why is there &quot;a  <br/>
career&quot; separate from being?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe &quot;There is nothing that you cannot be or do or have.&quot;<br/>
I believe that is dangerous mythology at best and cruel nonsense at  <br/>
worst.<br/>
<br/>
I cannot be anyone but myself.  If anyone encourages me to want to  <br/>
&quot;be&quot; anything other than what I am, then what&#39;s wrong with me?  Or by  <br/>
&quot;be&quot; is what is meant &quot;a gold medal olympic champion&quot;?  Do you think  <br/>
anyone can be a gold medallist?  Tell that to all the noted and  <br/>
recorded silver and bronze medallists over the years.  Can anyone be  <br/>
president?  John McCain?  Hilary Clinton?  Hell, even John Kennedy  <br/>
couldn&#39;t be president once he&#39;d been shot by a nutcase.<br/>
<br/>
If people are made promises by people who don&#39;t have the power to  <br/>
deliver those things, it&#39;s a setup for disappointment, frustration and  <br/>
mistrust.  Why should people &quot;seek joy&quot; as though it&#39;s lost or has to  <br/>
be hunted down?   People can find and share joy.  They can learn to  <br/>
recognize or induce or inspire joy.<br/>
<br/>
But to video games:<br/>
<br/>
-=-My 8 year old son has trouble even making eye contact with us after  <br/>
a full day of video games. How do I really let this go for once and  <br/>
for all?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is he tired?  Probably.  Hungry?   Do you need to make eye contact  <br/>
with him for some particular reason?  During that full day of games,  <br/>
were you nearby, watching him play?  Encouraging him and making sure  <br/>
he was comfortable and had something to drink?<br/>
<br/>
Did you make him stop playing and then he had trouble making eye  <br/>
contact?  Many people blame the end of a video gaming session on the  <br/>
game itself, but maybe the kids stopped because parents made them, or  <br/>
someone else talked them out of the TV, or because they were really  <br/>
tired or hungry or sore or sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know that playing video games brings my kids joy. They also love  <br/>
to go on fieldtrips, play outside with friends, play inside with  <br/>
friends, but their number one, hands down, all time favorite adventure  <br/>
is playing video games. Given the choice, that&#39;s really what they will  <br/>
do all day, even when presented with many other options.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Although my kids&#39; lives have always had a lot of fun, and joy, what my  <br/>
goal was that they learn.  And they have unquestionably learned from  <br/>
playing video games, from watching videos, from playing board games  <br/>
and talking to friends and digging holes in the back yard.  But what  <br/>
they learn when parents try to manage their time, and try to make them  <br/>
feel bad about their choices, is probably not what you want them to be  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of &quot;seeking&quot; your joy in your imagined visions of what your  <br/>
life with your children should be, maybe practice making eye contact  <br/>
with what it actually is!   Seriously.  In each moment, there is  <br/>
probably learning and joy, and your nervousness will put a damper on  <br/>
that.  Share the positive feelings they&#39;re having!<br/>

one and she wasn&#39;t going to spend $200 on that.  I asked her if she  <br/>
would rather spend that much money on something not worth fighting  <br/>
over.   If they&#39;re fighting over it, it must be good!   Rather than  <br/>
take it away, maybe help them find ways to get along in the presence  <br/>

If you make them turn off the games or computers because you miss  <br/>

do whatever they want in that time, you mean they don&#39;t have to hang  <br/>
out with you?  But they can&#39;t use the TV or computer?   How old are  <br/>

<br/>
Ah.  So because he does other things, you&#39;re taking credit for his  <br/>
decision?  You don&#39;t have to now, but at one point you did.<br/>
Had you not &quot;called for no technology time&quot; you probably would have  <br/>
seen (as many others her have) that the children would have done that  <br/>
on their own.  Then you could have been more confident about other  <br/>
decisions they would make in the future, and in their natural ability  <br/>
to make good choices without moms stepping in and putting limits on  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
He will never have credit for being &quot;more balanced&quot; if you feel it was  <br/>
your doing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of the very best things about a child learning to read  <br/>

were little.  I didn&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; get them up and moving.  They were  <br/>

they would play video games for a long time, or watch videos they had  <br/>

I think you meant to say CAN cause, not cannot cause.  I do agree with  <br/>
what you wrote there at the end.  I don&#39;t think you do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only people I have seen who were &quot;tuned out from the world&quot; were  <br/>
people like my cousin Nadine, who had suffered abuse and abandonment  <br/>
and had been sent 600 miles to live with our family, against her  <br/>
will.  Kids I went to school with who were picked on and who had  <br/>
meanness and violence at home could tune out any place, any time.   <br/>
Video games weren&#39;t even invented yet.<br/>

As a mother, you chose to.<br/>
As a contributor to this list (which I hope you will continue to be!)  <br/>
you&#39;ve suggested that others here aren&#39;t responsible mothers.<br/>

Please re-read your posts before you send them to check for things  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437259020">Peace Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Your point is well taken on proofreading.  In terms of the intent of what I am writing I thought that I was only sharing perspective not suggesting anything about others. I will probably sit back and see if I can get a better vibe for this group.  In the first rad unschooling group of which I was part I could never fully get into how to speak on the group with out feeling like I was wrong.<br/>
<br/>
But okay.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding choices as I see it life is choice.  So the &quot;have to&quot; was more for dramatic effect.  None of you know me so I can see how that was taken in a way that I did not mean it.  I simply seek to shift the energy of my home.  I am not perfect at not getting too bogged down in technology.  Like right now...I really feel that I need to be doing other things that I had planned to do but instead I am writing this email.<br/>
<br/>
When I find that this is the energetic vibe of my family then I won&#39;t choose to stay there.  One of the major lessons that I have learned from other unschoolers is the importance of modeling.  So I get up and go and so do my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==&gt;My sister said that after her kids had played at another house, years <br/>
ago, where there was a Sega Genesis system.  She told me (with her <br/>
accustomed dramatic feeling) that her kids would NEVER have a video <br/>
game system, because they fought over it everytime they were around <br/>
one and she wasn&#39;t going to spend $200 on that.  I asked her if she <br/>
would rather spend that much money on something not worth fighting <br/>
over.   If they&#39;re fighting over it, it must be good!   Rather than <br/>
take it away, maybe help them find ways to get along in the presence <br/>
of something that absorbing and wonderful<br/>
I don&#39;t disagree with you.  I agree with you on this.  I work with my sons to find balance.  But at some point when I see we need to choose to do something else for peace sake...then we shall.  It&#39;s break to help shift the energy as I see it.  More of a time out than a take away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I also did not sign up for technology to take over spending time <br/>
with my kids.-=-<br/>
Are you suggesting other families did?<br/>
Nope.  I am merely speaking on the thoughts that have crossed my mind regarding me and my family.<br/>
<br/>
-=- So when I find that our person to person time is being eclipsed I <br/>
will call no technology time. They can do whatever they want in that <br/>
time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
==&gt;If you make them turn off the games or computers because you miss <br/>
being with them, does that make them want to be with you?  If they can <br/>
do whatever they want in that time, you mean they don&#39;t have to hang <br/>
out with you?  But they can&#39;t use the TV or computer?   How old are <br/>
they again?<br/>
No.  That does not make them want to me with me.  I don&#39;t mind that though at times they do seek to spend time with me.  Mostly they play with each other and when they go back to playing with computers and what have you they tend to be more in synch with each other.<br/>
They are 6 and 9 years old.  First of all it is rare that I will say no technology.  It is when it feels like we are in a rut and beast wars is happening between the two of them that I tell them we will are ALL pulling back.  I get off it all, too, so as to not be a hypocrite and to live what I am calling them to do in that moment.  And at times I don&#39;t take a break from tv and computers and at times i call for us to do so.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

time doing something... like surfing the net or writing e-mail and time <br/>
has passed and nothing has gotten done and i need to change what i am <br/>
doing totally.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Who decides for you?<br/>
<br/>
I decide for me.  I am assuming that you are saying that they should decide for themselves.  Mostly they do but when the rut happens...I feel called to do something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My older son used to spend massive time but since getting time away <br/>

<br/>
==&gt;He will never have credit for being &quot;more balanced&quot; if you feel it was <br/>

I don&#39;t feel it was my doing.  I just so happen to take note that this what is going on with him.<br/>

Because of John Holt and other unschoolers...maybe even some of your work because I have read your site in previous years...I have had this experience with my older son.  I trust their innate wisdom.  I don&#39;t always profess to be perfect as unschooling is a new paradigm for me.  But I know that children learn to read without being taught.<br/>

I agree with you.  This is my experience.  Even if...not meant to mean anything really.  Maybe should have said &quot;we do many things such as...&quot;  I get myself up and moving and so they end up getting up and moving too.  Yes, we are all interested in life in general...I agree with you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I seek to educate my children and help them understand that <br/>
technology cannot cause us to get tuned out from the world.-=-<br/>
<br/>
==&gt;I think you meant to say CAN cause, not cannot cause.  I do agree with <br/>
what you wrote there at the end.  I don&#39;t think you do. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I wrote what I meant but do agree with &quot;can cause&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
The only people I have seen who were &quot;tuned out from the world&quot; were <br/>
people like my cousin Nadine, who had suffered abuse and abandonment <br/>
and had been sent 600 miles to live with our family, against her <br/>
will.  Kids I went to school with who were picked on and who had <br/>
meanness and violence at home could tune out any place, any time. <br/>
Video games weren&#39;t even invented yet.<br/>
<br/>
==&gt;It is interesting to me what you say.  There is some issue with technology at times though.  It can be positive and negative just depending on the use.  Do I see my kids use of it as detrimental.  No.  I just don&#39;t.  As a matter of fact I think it was writing you posted about your children that made me okay with it.  But I have had my own issues with it.  It can tune me out to the world and at times it is good but there are problematic times, too.  That is the point I was making.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-as a responsible mother...i have to -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==&gt;As a mother, you chose to.<br/>
Yep..choose to.  Have to was more for dramatic effect.  I hear you.<br/>
<br/>
==&gt;As a contributor to this list (which I hope you will continue to be!) <br/>
you&#39;ve suggested that others here aren&#39;t responsible mothers.<br/>
In my perspective it is how you are seeing it.  I am not suggesting that other mothers are not responsible.  I am only talking about me.  I don&#39;t judge other mothers.  I am not suggesting that others are not responsible.  If that is how these words are coming across then let me clear it up now that that is not my intent.<br/>
==&gt;Please re-read your posts before you send them to check for things <br/>
like &quot;I had to...&quot; and such.   Proofreading and deciding whether it&#39;s <br/>
really what you meant to say is better for your own thinking and for <br/>
those who come to read!<br/>
<br/>
Again...I will have to step back and read more.  I am merely sharing<br/>
not suggesting anything.  But in honoring your request I will be more<br/>
mindful of what I post.<br/>
Peace<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps if instead of seeing it and calling a &quot;rut&quot;, you saw it and called <br/>
it &quot;absorbtion&quot;, &quot;engagement&quot;, &quot;enthusiasm&quot;, &quot;passionate learning&quot;, &quot;a <br/>
beloved hobby&quot;. Then perhaps you would feel called to do something <br/>
different - like bring some snacks and drinks, sit down nearby with your own <br/>
book or craft project, watch a DVD you&#39;ve been saving, write something, call <br/>
a friend for a nice long chat, and later on when they are taking a break, <br/>
ask them all about how the game is going, and invite them to take a walk <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps your kids are desperate to grab all the intense gaming time they can <br/>
because they know that sooner or later you are going to put a stop to their <br/>
enjoyment, and it is going to be on your timetable, not theirs. Perhaps they <br/>
are not going to listen to their own body saying &quot;pause, move, rest, eat&quot; <br/>
because they figure your louder voice will come along any moment anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My dd is 10. She plays a lot of games. Her emotional volatility is always <br/>
connected to decompressing from spending time with other kids in other <br/>
(stricter) homes, never with playing electronic games. I encourage her to <br/>
take a break only when she is very frustrated, and only for a couple of <br/>
minutes to look at the walkthrough or check out cheat codes. Other than <br/>
that, my experience is that she is always happy, relaxed, eager to talk and <br/>
move around physically, and full of a desire to connect whenever she puts <br/>
away her devices on her own timetable.<br/>

Sometimes kids won&#39;t stop to go to the bathroom for fear that if the  <br/>
mom sees them away from the game/tv/computer, she&#39;ll make them do  <br/>
something, or otherwise keep them from returning to the activity.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My parents  were super good about letting us kids play and play for <br/>
hours and hours. That&#39;s what children did, in the 50&#39;s and early 60&#39;s (I <br/>
was born in 1952). Long hours of uninterrupted playtime was the norm.  <br/>
When my friends and I would be playing out in the neighborhood or in my <br/>
backyard or bedroom, if my mom showed up it usually meant something good <br/>
- she&#39;d be bringing us snacks or (just like in the commercials) a <br/>
pitcher of cold cool-aid.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY time I kind of dreaded hearing her footsteps coming down the <br/>
hall toward my bedroom was when I was &quot;just reading.&quot; Conventional <br/>
parenting wisdom of the time said that children needed to be active - <br/>
they needed to &quot;go outdoors&quot; and play.  I knew that I sometimes wanted <br/>
to &quot;just lay around and read&quot; beyond my mom&#39;s comfort level and so I&#39;d <br/>
take a book outside with me and hide up in a tree or behind the garage <br/>
so that she&#39;d think I was somewhere playing with other kids, being <br/>
active.  My sister did the same thing. Once, she squeezed in behind a <br/>
bunch of wood piled against a wall - it didn&#39;t look like there was any <br/>
space behind it. She fell asleep and it got dark and nobody could find <br/>
her and my parents called the police.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - it wasn&#39;t even like they were trying to discourage us from <br/>
reading. We went to the library weekly, my parents read a lot, too. My <br/>
dad was an English major in college and owned lots and lots of books of <br/>
his own.  But it wasn&#39;t considered &quot;good for children&quot; to spend too many <br/>
hours reading, so we were pretty often told to put the book down and go <br/>
outside.<br/>
<br/>
I remember being in my room, reading comfortably on my bed, but not <br/>
wanting to go down the hall to the bathroom or to the kitchen for food <br/>
because I was afraid my mom would suddenly realize that I&#39;d been in <br/>
there reading for hours and would make me go outside.<br/>

<br/>
In contrast, I was telling one of my kids just the other day that  <br/>
school expected me to sit for an hour or two at a time.  ME!  So I  <br/>
became expert at needing to sharpen my pencil, needing to go to the  <br/>
bathroom, volunteering to take notes to the office, DOing something.   <br/>
On the other hand, at home I could become engrossed in a book (if I  <br/>
were fortunate enough to have a new book) to the point that it could  <br/>
get too dark to read and I didn&#39;t notice, or I REALLY needed to pee,  <br/>
but I didn&#39;t notice.<br/>
<br/>
Forgetting to take care of one&#39;s  needs is a sign of wonder and  <br/>
fascination, whereas having nothing to do but eat and go to the  <br/>
bathroom and make eye contact with other humans just to do it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
sound like ideal conditions for learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807899730">I got a surprize from my sil and bil for Christmas.  A DSI.<br/>
<br/>
My kids and I are loving Animal Crossing, together.  It is the first time I<br/>
could really *enjoy* a game with them.  Before I was supportive and<br/>
interested, but now my little Marina Doppelganger is moving on screen and my<br/>
kids are enjoying teaching me how to harvest fruit, meet the locals,<br/>
decorate my house and pay my mortgage, as well as urging me to plant more<br/>
flowers and go fishing.  We don&#39;t blow anybody up and its non-competitive.<br/>
There are no points involved. This is a game for me...purely skill  and fun,<br/>
but I love Wii bowling, tennis and skiing, too.  Most of the games the kids<br/>
play are too complex for me lol  I can appreciate their reflexes,<br/>
persistence and the ability to delve into and memorize a vast array of<br/>
characters and information...but heck I am forty-two my brain can&#39;t possibly<br/>
be as good, and though I knit and type, my fingers don&#39;t move as quickly as<br/>
theirs.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy watching my kids exercise choice and revel in their discoveries.<br/>
 Choices are great.  But I have never been able to share their interests as<br/>
fully as this one.  I am currently struggling to build virtual snowmen with<br/>
the encouragement of my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Today we went out to a mall to try on shoes, eat sushi, bbq, and Thai food.<br/>
My middle son whom I am constantly being &quot;warned about&quot; ate sushi, with<br/>
oj. I think his choices are great.  He enjoys a variety of food.  I don&#39;t<br/>
dole it based on faulty logic.  Over the course of a week he eats less of<br/>
what other parents consider junkfood than the kids who need to ask and<br/>
have it doled out.  Those parents never believe me, because if ever they<br/>
relax their kids will grab the cookies and disappear in a closet until the<br/>
bag is all gone.  They are just sure we live in chaos because my kids don&#39;t<br/>
need permission to eat food in particular.  I don&#39;t moniter the treats.  I<br/>
just make sure lots of bread, peanut butter, meat, eggs, fruit and veggies<br/>
disappear too.  If they don&#39;t I offer platters!<br/>
<br/>
I had bought a large wheel of brie to give to my brother for Christmas, but<br/>
I found out when I went to the fridge to pack the hamper the kids had<br/>
devoured it!  They ask with most things that might be an ingredient in<br/>
something else.  (Cream, sour cream, chocolate chips generally are<br/>
ingredients in other dishes and I have been tripped up after discovering<br/>
minutes after assembling all the other ingredients that someone ate whatever<br/>
it was and need to get more)<br/>
<br/>
This happened slowly over the course of years.  We spent time in candy shops<br/>
and bought home lots of ice cream.  Sometimes they love a<br/>
particular food for ages.<br/>
<br/>
Other times the combinations strike me as odd.  One night three years ago, I<br/>
think, we had a chocolate fondue and I remember telling my son, Marty, we<br/>
don&#39;t dip carrots in chocolate.  I couldn&#39;t think why, so I backed off right<br/>
away;) We were working together to set up a plate of fruit to dip in<br/>
chocolate and he started arranging baby carrots on the platter.  It was<br/>
strikingly beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
His response was he liked carrots and we all love chocolate.  He<br/>
wondered what is so great about strawberries dipped in chocolate.<br/>
Strawberries are great alone, especially when ripe and in season,<br/>
strawberries don&#39;t need anything.  But carrots taste really really good<br/>
dipped in chocolate.  True wisdom indeed.<br/>

I&#39;m on his side, about chocolate.<br/>

Years ago, pre-kids, I mentioned at work that chocolate could make  <br/>
anything better.  A co-worker said he didn&#39;t think so.  We got to  <br/>
talking about what would or wouldn&#39;t be better with chocolate.  That  <br/>

work the next day, and it was actually pretty good!<br/>

probably frequently sprayed with pesticides).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching Mad Men. I am the exact same age as Don and Betty <br/>
Draper&#39;s daughter. My dad was a businessman - vice president of <br/>
marketing for an industrial construction company. We weren&#39;t as wealthy <br/>
as the Drapers, but scale the house down to a normal tract home size and <br/>
that was pretty much my life. Luckily, my parents were quite a bit <br/>
nicer, but the overall attitude toward children and women was still <br/>
exactly as depicted in Mad Men.<br/>
<br/>
My dad, who loved me and admired me, told me I was very smart, for a <br/>
girl, and should be sure to learn to type well, that I&#39;d make a <br/>
wonderful administrative assistant (a new term in those days).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564045360">Okay... I&#39;m the one who started this topic.<br/>
<br/>
Since that day, a few days ago, I have given my kids free choice on video games.  One is playing My Sims Agent and the other is building Bionicles and really going to town with his imagination.  I love it when they pretend and play and I get to watch them do this.  It&#39;s so fun.  I was so excited to let everyone know my comfort levels at watching my kids make choices for themselves and not make choices because they are afraid they are not going to get to make the choices they want... Hope that made sense to you all.<br/>
<br/>
I really thought that video games would be the only choice that they would ever make.  WOW!!  They are showing more interest in doing things even besides video games.  One of them found a pop up timer for a roast.  We had so much fun experimenting with different water temperatures and this got us started on all other kinds of measuring tools and we had a blast. <br/>
<br/>
In summary, I believe that by me relaxing up and letting them make their choices, they have been free to actually decide all on their own when not to play video games and pursue their other interests.  I&#39;m fine with them playing video games now and enjoy watching and interacting with them, or just being near finishing a knitting project, reading or chit chatting with them.  So far, so great!!!</div>

&gt; yep! the local chocolatier makes bacon chocolate too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i have started a &quot;tradition&quot; in my family recently of making crepes on<br/>
&gt; sunday, kind of borrowed from a friend...and next weekend i am going to make<br/>
&gt; the crepe batter flavored. i found a recipe for a mango one - and i am going<br/>
&gt; to make a chocolate one too. maybe raspberry as well. i also saw a recipe<br/>
&gt; for a chocolate pie crust for apple pie i want to try. i get that that&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; carrots - but still. i think a chocolate crepe with bacon and cheese would<br/>
&gt; be amazing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; mole sauce has chocolate...<br/>
