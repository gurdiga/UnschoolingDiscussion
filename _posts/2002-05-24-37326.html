<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609692407">Reading all of the posts about being bored, I thought it was my turn to chime <br/>
in on this conversation. My boys were considered problems in school. They <br/>
weren&#39;t huge behavior problems, but they were always distracting the other <br/>
children in the class because they would complete their work before anyone <br/>
else. To the boys, that meant play time and nothing else. The teacher would <br/>
give them referrals out of class, make them write sentences, tell them to <br/>
wait in the hall or go to the office until they could behave. Actually the <br/>
boys were bored. So, what I did to fend off some of that boredom was to send <br/>
work to school with them. I even had it worked out to where they would <br/>
receive extra credit for reading an extra book and sharing it in class with <br/>
the other students.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that children should be given a chance to express themselves.. And <br/>
maybe a child being bored is just thier way of saying that they would like <br/>
some attention, or they just need something to interrupt their neuro <br/>
associative connection with the boredom they are experiencing at that moment.<br/>
<br/>
My four year old is constantly &quot;in to&quot; things. He goes from one thing to the <br/>
next, in this and in that. He just can&#39;t sit down for a minute out of the day <br/>
unless he is really engrossed in something on television. Other than that he <br/>
is up and running around as though this was his last moment on earth :) I <br/>
have found that I had to adjust my schedule and make it my business to be <br/>
readily available for him when he experienced this. I have found ways to <br/>
basically keep him &quot;down&quot; some of the time, but I must admit that i am &quot;up&quot; <br/>
most of the time. I hope it is okay to say that he basically has me on a <br/>
schedule. My family tells me that maybe he needs to be on some medication, or <br/>
maybe he needs to &quot;have his butt beat&quot; or he needs to be taught some manners. <br/>
But that is not the case at all. He is very bright and he is so intuned to <br/>
what he desires. I feel like I should not listen to my family only because <br/>
first of all I don&#39;t believe in spanking a child for being himself. Yes, I do <br/>
think sometimes he should be redirected and that is fine. But the negativity <br/>
I receive from others when it comes to his so-called lack of discipline is <br/>
just upsetting to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that he is interested in things that I am not necessarily <br/>
intersted in and I must admit that I do try to divert his attention away from <br/>
certain things, such as blood and gore video games, movies, and guns. He is <br/>
so into what he wants to be in to.<br/>
<br/>
I said all of this to say...how do you teach a four year old about guns? <br/>
Blood and gore movies? Blood and gore video games? Dying? I have no clue. My <br/>
thoughts are to just say, not right now honey, mommy is busy and then hurry <br/>
and busy myself quick, fast and in a hurry as to leave no room for him to <br/>
remind me...but he always does. <br/>

perhaps they need to be on some medication or to have their butts eat, or to <br/>
be taught some manners.  You can give them my phone number or e-mail if they <br/>
want to see if I actually said that.  Or heck, print this out and mail it to <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I have an idiot friend who told me when Kirby was little that I needed to <br/>
spank him more.  The reason was that she had her own kids&#39; spirits broken <br/>
early, and Kirby was a disruption to their quiet, cynical, bored routines.   <br/>
If I wasn&#39;t going to break his spirit, she didn&#39;t really want him around her <br/>
kids.  If I DID break his spirit, she wouldn&#39;t feel so guilty about the way <br/>
she was being.<br/>
<br/>
Send this to your relatives too!! If they&#39;re just jealous that their own <br/>
childhoods were stifled and that they were shamed for being curious and <br/>
joyful, they should try to remember that, and NOT pass it on.<br/>

<br/>
Well it&#39;s time for you to turn and answer his questions, at his level, and as <br/>
briefly as you have to, or at length when you can.<br/>
<br/>
You just discuss those things with him as they come up, and answer his <br/>
questions.  He doesn&#39;t want to know EVERYTHING, just a little bit at a time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This approach (avoiding his questions) will only teach him not to ask you <br/>
questions or rely on you for information.  You also may teach him to avoid <br/>
your questions if you&#39;re asking him about something he&#39;s not comfortable <br/>
talking about (this is probably not the effect you were after).<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you be direct with your son and answer his questions <br/>
as honestly as you can.  If you don&#39;t have the information, get it for <br/>
him.  If he&#39;s interested in guns, you will not be able to diminish his <br/>
curiosity by avoiding his questions and hoping they&#39;ll go <br/>
away.  Eventually, he&#39;ll look elsewhere for the answers, and the <br/>
information may not be so reliable.  It may not be the information you <br/>
would want him to have.<br/>
<br/>
My friend&#39;s son was very interested in guns at a very young age, and she (a <br/>
pacifist, like me) did not belittle him at all.  She encouraged his desire <br/>
to learn.  Since she knew nothing about guns, she took him to the police <br/>
department and asked them to answer his questions honestly and directly <br/>
about guns.  He wanted to know how they worked and all that.  They answered <br/>
his questions, and they were sure to pass on information about gun safety, <br/>
too.  I thought it was a great idea.  He still really digs guns, but he <br/>
understands how dangerous they are.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this was helpful!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The understanding he&#39;ll get at 4 isn&#39;t the same understanding he&#39;ll have at<br/>
6 or 10 or 15.<br/>
<br/>
If the part that concerns you is that he has a fascination with firepower<br/>
without the understanding of the effects, you can make the message that guns<br/>
kill real people available but it&#39;s not important that he truly understand<br/>
it yet. If you try to make him understand that guns kill people he&#39;ll be<br/>
able to parrot that back but he won&#39;t get that guns kill *people* like mom<br/>
and dad and little kids and someone&#39;s beloved pet because his understanding<br/>
of death and the devastation and permanence of the loss just isn&#39;t the same<br/>
as it will be later. If the message is heavy handed he may even tune it out<br/>
even when it would be natural for him to understand from seeing the<br/>
emotional effect gun use has in movies and TV. It may come across like the<br/>
world is conspiring against him to make him dislike guns.<br/>
<br/>
(Sort of like if every time you plugged in the Christmas tree someone felt<br/>
compelled to remind you that Christmas trees burn houses down every<br/>
Christmas time. You&#39;d eventually tune it out.)<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d treat the weapon interest neutrally as you would any other interest.<br/>
The police idea was good! Dorling Kindersley has a good book (or two) on<br/>
weapons with loads of pictures.<br/>

<br/>
Marji, that second part is a really good point and hadn&#39;t occurred to me. <br/>
<br/>
Thinking back to kids I knew well when I was young, the one family in which <br/>
the parents just ignored questions (it was eerie) was the one family in which <br/>
the parents knew the least about what their kids were really doing.  It <br/>
seemed that by mutual agreement, nothing real and substantial and personal <br/>
would be discussed.<br/>
<br/>
The mom went through pregnancy and birth with a 13 year old daughter in the <br/>
house (who was my best friend, which is why I know the play by play), and two <br/>
younger kids.   It was a Down syndrome baby, and the mom and dad never said a <br/>
word in front of those girls about it, and when we were 15 or so DiAna <br/>
commented that her brother didn&#39;t walk yet although he was nearly two.   I <br/>
thought she had known the deal!  I helped her look stuff up (after telling <br/>
her what it was called, which in those days was still often &quot;Mongolism&quot;), and <br/>
began to pay more attention to how silent things in a family could really be. <br/>
 The kids did not even ASK about that baby, because their questions had never <br/>
been answered before, so they had learned not to ask anything.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying at all that this would be the situation in the home of the mom <br/>
who wrote about how to answer difficult questions, and this HAD to be a <br/>
really extreme case. But I liked your point a lot, Marji.<br/>
<br/>
These parents were bright, responsible physically (nice house, cars in good <br/>
repair and clean, orchard always irrigated, meals always ready, dad was <br/>
respected in the community (a Bataan Death March veteran), and from the <br/>
outside it looked like an enviable family.<br/>
<br/>
They got better later, and I don&#39;t know why.  The mom because an activist in <br/>
Down Syndrome issues and even gave public speeches.  For some reason, some <br/>
lights went on.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t try so hard to avoid the questions. He probably doesn&#39;t want as <br/>
involved an answer as you&#39;re afraid he does anyway. Like the kid who asked <br/>
his mom where he came from and got the lecture on sexual reproduction. Turns <br/>
out the kid wanted to know, was it Brooklyn or Queens? &lt;g&gt; If you avoid the <br/>
questions it makes it a big dark secret that&#39;s even more interesting and <br/>
somewhat forbidden. If you answer his questions, with as much info as he <br/>
*really* wants, you&#39;ll make it just another piece of informtion to learn and <br/>
store.<br/>
<br/>
My son Conor has always had a fascination with guns and warfare and such. <br/>
He&#39;s a gentle soul who cries at sad stories, but he loves firepower. I think <br/>
it gives *him* the feeling of power. He&#39;s almost 13 now.<br/>
<br/>
I have always tried to support his interest at whatever level was <br/>
appropriate at the time. I let him play with toy guns, found books in the <br/>
library, rented him movies if he asked. We made bows and arrows, rubberband <br/>
guns and hundreds of different swords. We played castles, Robin Hood, Peter <br/>
Pan conquers Captain Hook, Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers, GI Joe and on and <br/>
on. All the while I talked and observed and listened to where he was. (Oh <br/>
and blew away a few bad guys in the process. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Movies like Star Wars were good sources of shooting without any blood. He&#39;s <br/>
watched more realistic ones as he&#39;s gotten older and we&#39;ve talked, talked, <br/>
talked. I&#39;ve talked a lot about the difference between real guns and toy <br/>
guns and what to do if you come across a real one. He has a cousin who <br/>
accidentally shot himself, so that story came out when it was appropriate. I <br/>
tried not to lecture, or sound dissapproving of his interests. But I am his <br/>
Mom and I&#39;m concerned for his safety. I like the idea of going to talk to a <br/>
police officer. I want to take him to a shooting range to get a gunsafety <br/>
course. He&#39;s also going to be doing paintball guns.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still sweet and gentle and cries at sad stories.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420840603"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Whoa!!   I must DISAGREE with this line of thinking!  IMO, a four year old <br/>
&gt;&gt;should NOT be watching blood and gore movies and video games especially if <br/>
&gt;&gt;you have no clue as to how to teach one that young about this. Why put <br/>
&gt;&gt;yourself in the position of having to deal with it?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anyone is advocating blood and gore movies or games for 4 year <br/>
olds. But sometimes, despite our best intentions, our little ones do get a <br/>
glimpse of something-through an older sibling, visit to a friend&#39;s house, a <br/>
look at a newspaper or magazine, or a video playing in Blockbuster. They ask <br/>
questions. They get interested. And the more precocious or verbal the 4 year <br/>
old is, the more questions or interest they may have. That&#39;s when you need <br/>
to be prepared to deal with the difficult questions. IMHO it&#39;s best to <br/>
answer those questions and requests as simply and honestly as possible.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW my son&#39;s interest in weapons started with the movie Peter Pan. Other <br/>
kids saw it and wanted to fly. Conor wanted Peter Pan&#39;s sword and Captain <br/>
Hook&#39;s gun.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But that is the purpose of guns. That and blowing animals away.<br/>
