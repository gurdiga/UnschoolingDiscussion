<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833315050">Kelly, I use to work at an acute psych rehab unit and this is NOT what you<br/>
should expect NOR should you accept it!  Is this person a psychiatrist or a<br/>
psychologist?  Her behavior was totally inappropriate and in fact, one part<br/>
could get her slapped by the medical association that is appropriate (be<br/>
she an &quot;rist&quot; or a &quot;gist&quot;).  To diagnose ADD/ADHD has absolutely nothing to<br/>
do with school.  It is now being recognized that children in school that<br/>
are so readily given the label of ADD/ADHD are more than likely not.  To<br/>
diagnose ADD/ADHD takes a whole battery of tests which include among<br/>
others, sleep deprivation<br/>
<br/>
I am not sure I would trust her with my own care as she is obviously off in<br/>
her own personal LaLa Land which has nothing to do with reality or<br/>
professional ethics.  No professional shrink would make any recommendation<br/>
based on a short chat with you.  In fact, most shrinks want to see someone<br/>
for 3 to 6 months before they start making hard core decisions.<br/>
<br/>
This broad is a flake and your reaction was appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read the book done by the Kaiser doc about diet for kids who might<br/>
be ADD/ADHD??  This is a definitive work and was done many years ago but is<br/>
really quite good.<br/>
<br/>
Also, being so close to the situtation, you might be &quot;making mountains out<br/>
of mole hills&quot; because you are afraid of what you might see.  I know I did<br/>
this when eldest son was diagnosed as ADHD and then second son was<br/>
diagnosed as ADD.  Poor third son felt like he was under a microscope as I<br/>
examined every little thing he did worrying about whether or not he was ADD<br/>
or ADHD.  Both the kidlets who were diagnosed have only had to manage their<br/>
diets and do some education on their condition and know what they need to<br/>
do.  They have learned vocusing lessons and we did their rooms &quot;soft&quot; which<br/>
gave them a place to desensitise and destress themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Lynda, wishing you good luck in finding a real shrink.<br/>

&gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; I am on digest mode of this list, and have not been active on the list<br/>
&gt; either, for some time, due to time constraints.  I am writing now to ask<br/>
&gt; for some much needed understanding and support(help?).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Something happened yesterday, that made me realize my need for support,<br/>
&gt; which will require a bit of background information, so here it is:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What, if anything, should I do about this?  Is this sort of thing to be<br/>
&gt; expected from a psychiatrist?  I am just so shocked.  Maybe I am living<br/>
&gt; in a bubble and this is common discrimination.  Do the rest of you deal<br/>
&gt; with this sort of nonsense?  If so, how do you deal with it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to all who read this whole thing, and thanks in advance to all<br/>
&gt; who respond.  This has really upset me and I feel so alone right now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
