&lt;&lt; Ask him what happens to the schooled kids who don&#39;t get a certain score.  <br/>
Do<br/>
 they then have to be homeschooled? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now that would be fair, wouldn&#39;t it?<br/>
It always bugs the heck out of me that homeschoolers are under such scrutiny <br/>
and supposedly made to keep to a certain &quot;standard&quot; while the public schools <br/>
are harming and not educating masses of people but not forced to quit what <br/>
they&#39;re doing.<br/>
Turn about&#39;s fair play....<br/>
