<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239281715">We are a family with lots of animals too.. my oldest dd raises guinea pigs<br/>
and gerbils..(she wants a rat, so I have been passing on all the info to<br/>
her) We also have milk goats, sheep, horses, chickens, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and a<br/>
budgie that belongs to my middle dd.<br/>
<br/>
My children have learned so much from these animals. It definatly encourages<br/>
lots of reading and researching whenever they get a new type of critter. We<br/>
have also had reptiles, an Iguana and various snakes and lizzards and a<br/>
Sugarglider for a time.  I love feeding the wild birds and do so year round.<br/>
Right now my feeders are over run with Goldfinch and House finch..<br/>
Bluebirds, and Indigo Buntings are common in my yard, but only come to the<br/>
bird bath as they are not seed eaters. I love the animal discussions! Had to<br/>
come out of lurkdom for this.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and a brag story.. my oldest dd just got a job at our local state park..<br/>
all without a diploma..(if any of you remember my brother in law and his<br/>
comments about no one being able to do anything without that piece of paper)<br/>
She starts next week.. doing park maintence this summer (lots of mowing and<br/>
cleanup and work on the trails) and then after taking a few college<br/>
correspondence classes...will move up to assistant park biologist next year.<br/>
She is so excited! She will be 18 this Fall.<br/>
