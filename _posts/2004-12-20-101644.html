<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469120028">I need some guidance regarding my highly sensitive son, age 7. I&#39;ve<br/>
read Raising Your Spirited Child, and I&#39;m getting a handle on my son&#39;s<br/>
intense and wonderful personality, but the holidays do add some stress. <br/>
<br/>
Some background:  he very rarely wants to leave the house, and we<br/>
respect that.  I never ask him to go grocery shopping or errand<br/>
running -- even when my husband is out of town, I hire someone to<br/>
watch my boys so I can get those things done.  I offer only things<br/>
that might be fun to him, and he usually refuses those as well.  If<br/>
it&#39;s something that we&#39;ve planned with other people (extremely rare --<br/>
less than once per month), I gently work with him through his crying<br/>
and resistance (let him wear his pajamas in the car, take a snack and<br/>
GameBoy and stuffed animal)  -- and then when we get there, he has a<br/>
*great* time.  So often, it feels like an outing is just what he<br/>
needed, but I respect that the transition is very difficult for him<br/>
right now, and I don&#39;t push it.<br/>
<br/>
Being around other people seems hard for him right now, too.  The last<br/>
few times we&#39;ve been at extended family gatherings, he&#39;s played for a<br/>
bit and then really locked into &quot;I want to go home.&quot;  We haven&#39;t even<br/>
finished our meal, so we try to find things for him -- the TV in<br/>
Grandma&#39;s basement is a big one -- until we can finish up.<br/>
<br/>
Now the holidays are here.  During present opening and dinner, his<br/>
grandparents and aunts and uncles would, I&#39;m sure, really like to<br/>
interact with him, at least a little.  I&#39;m guessing that they&#39;ll try,<br/>
and he knows them all quite well.  But right now he&#39;s very shy, and it<br/>
comes across as &quot;rude.&quot;  I&#39;m a bit worried (breathe) that he&#39;s going<br/>
to get overwhelmed and have an awful time, and cause quite a bit of<br/>
irritation in others at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
At Live and Learn 2004, Anne Ohman talked about how she prepared her<br/>
son for such gatherings, and then helped him through it, and then<br/>
debriefed with him afterwards.  I&#39;m looking for some specifics along<br/>
these lines.<br/>
<br/>
Also:  much of Fisher&#39;s spirited personality became apparent to others<br/>
right around the time that we began unschooling.  I&#39;m starting to pick<br/>
up hints that people think that our &quot;lenience&quot; is the cause of this<br/>
&quot;unpleasantness.&quot;  (I don&#39;t think he&#39;s unpleasant, but I think they<br/>
are starting to.)  To be honest, it hurts to see my son not<br/>
appreciated by his own family -- usually a pretty loving group.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for some suggestions in answering their concerns.  There&#39;s<br/>
so much content to the belief and philosophy of unschooling, and I&#39;m<br/>
trying to find the focus in relation to this.  Here&#39;s where I&#39;m going<br/>
so far:  I think unschooling will give him the room to learn to deal<br/>
with his own personality and sensitivity.  In a few years I expect<br/>
that he&#39;ll be a lot more comfortable in social situations -- but he<br/>
needs this time to work through it on his own terms.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts on that?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154854191">** Now the holidays are here...**<br/>
<br/>
Are your family gatherings pretty predictable?  Can you start talking <br/>
about the events that happened last year in a way that will help him <br/>
anticipate what will happen this year, in a mostly positive way?<br/>
<br/>
(I probably wouldn&#39;t take a kid into a situation that I thought was most <br/>
likely to be negative.  I have a history of unpleasant scenes with my <br/>
father&#39;s family and I&#39;m visiting them without my kid this year.)  (But <br/>
he has a health issue that helps me duck the direct insult.)<br/>
<br/>
** Also:  much of Fisher&#39;s spirited personality became apparent to others<br/>
right around the time that we began unschooling.  I&#39;m starting to pick<br/>
up hints that people think that our &quot;lenience&quot; is the cause of this<br/>
&quot;unpleasantness.&quot; **<br/>
<br/>
I would probably do gentle redirecting or suggesting better behavior <br/>
loudly enough that the audience can hear it.  This shows that you aren&#39;t <br/>
just accepting and promoting that behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I live in a relatively warm state, so just stepping outside and walking <br/>
around the block is feasible when we have &quot;too much family&quot; and too much <br/>
noise at the holidays.  I realize this is a less attractive option where <br/>
it&#39;s wetter or colder.  But I do have one adult relative who will <br/>
routinely go to one of the bedrooms and rest or nap halfway through <br/>
family events.  Some people might think &quot;How rude!&quot;, but I think &quot;How <br/>
sensible!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
** I&#39;m looking for some suggestions in answering their concerns.**<br/>
<br/>
I think you may have to break it into two parts.  The first part would <br/>
be just hearing their concerns, when your son isn&#39;t around.  Letting <br/>
them talk for a long time or asking follow up questions can help make <br/>
things clearer.  (The first sentence they offer may be the harshest <br/>
one.  It doesn&#39;t necessarily get worse as the conversation continues.)  <br/>
Taking their comments back to their personal experience or their core <br/>
values can help you comprehend their point of view, even if it is <br/>
strange or obnoxious.  Sometimes letting the conversation get deeper can <br/>
also narrow down the criticism, and I think focused criticism is easier <br/>
to discuss than broad criticism is.  I think at this point maybe the <br/>
best you can hope for is to say &quot;I understand your concern&quot;.   Take time <br/>
until the next gathering to get perfectly calm and offer &quot;answers&quot; to <br/>
the concerns, if you feel you have to.  You don&#39;t *owe* them answers, <br/>
and you can&#39;t always change their minds about how *they* would approach <br/>
parenting even with the best damn answers ever written.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  Don&#39;t let them play &quot;pin the blame on the mommy&quot; with you.  <br/>
Everything your child does is not caused by you (or by unschooling).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558346229">***Being around other people seems hard for him right now, too.  ***<br/>
<br/>
Will the festivities be at your house this year? <br/>
<br/>
Do you have enough room and a place he&#39;d feel comfortable by himself so<br/>
he could escape the crowd if he needed to?  If you could set up a room<br/>
that was his hide away, make a cozy place to sit, good lighting if he<br/>
wanted to read or play, a TV, etc. he might feel better.  He might not<br/>
need to use it, just knowing it was there might be enough. <br/>
<br/>
You could stash it with a cooler and drinks and snacks before guests<br/>
arrive.  And when you notice he&#39;s slipped away you could sneak in with<br/>
top secret cookies or something so he knows you&#39;re connected to him, even<br/>
when he&#39;s removed himself from the rest of the group. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan used to go under the eaves.  Upstairs we have these little Hobbit<br/>
doors that allow access to the long storage space under the eaves and we<br/>
kept toys in there.  He had a little inflatable mattress and his favorite<br/>
blankets and when we had a lot of people over he liked being able to slip<br/>
away for little bits of time.   Sometimes I or his dad would go up and<br/>
knock on the door and visit a bit and usually he&#39;d come down shortly<br/>
after, ready to participate again. <br/>
<br/>
If you won&#39;t be at home will you at least have your own room where you&#39;re<br/>
staying?  You could let him know he could hang out in there if he needed<br/>
to. <br/>
<br/>
Or in your car, if it&#39;s warm enough outside.  <br/>
<br/>
We used to take a little tent along, a kid tent, and set it up for Dylan<br/>
in some out of the way place and put his blankets and favorite toys in<br/>
there.  <br/>
This might not work as well if there are other kids around.  They might<br/>
want to be in the tent too, but if it&#39;s mostly big people the tent can be<br/>
really cool because he can still listen in on conversations, but be in<br/>
his own secret place. <br/>
<br/>
Let him know you&#39;ll go outside with him if he needs to get out.  Go for a<br/>
walk.  Arrange with your partner to manage things while you&#39;re gone and<br/>
take off for twenty or thirty minutes.  The people in the house are going<br/>
to have each other and be busy with conversation or whatever and won&#39;t<br/>
really be thinking of how long you&#39;re gone. <br/>
<br/>
Does he ride a bike?  Can you take it with you.  If it&#39;s snowy, take a<br/>
sled.  You can pull him around in the yard or street if there are no<br/>
hills. <br/>
<br/>
This is an age thing and it will pass for the most part.  There are<br/>
family members that just aren&#39;t that much fun to be around let alone have<br/>
to make nice with when you&#39;re seven.  (Or forty one&lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
***I&#39;m looking for some suggestions in answering their concerns. ***<br/>
<br/>
If your son is getting frustrated or excited and you think it might<br/>
escalate you can sneak a away to a quiet part of the house and talk a bit<br/>
until he seems calmer.   <br/>
<br/>
If the problem is mostly the expectation others have of how your kid<br/>
should be, just stop them. <br/>
I once said, very sweetly to my brother in law, when he was expressing<br/>
his concern Dylan was playing PlayStation too much (on Christmas day, the<br/>
day he received it!)   &quot;I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re not having a good time, if you&#39;d<br/>
like to go that&#39;s perfectly ok with me.&quot;  &lt;G&gt;  He stayed and he was<br/>
nicer.   <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t spend a lot of time discussing the unschooling philosophy<br/>
unless it was really apparent someone was genuinely interested.  Most<br/>
people who feel the need to tell us there&#39;s something wrong with our kids<br/>
don&#39;t really care about our philosophy.  They care about getting the kid<br/>
to do what they want him to do at the moment.  That&#39;s not a kid problem. <br/>
 I&#39;d probably just say, &quot;Look, it&#39;s Christmas, things are hectic, give<br/>
him a break.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
You know your son is wonderful.  You understand him and you&#39;d like<br/>
everyone to be able to understand him.  If it&#39;s too hard this year make<br/>
different plans next year.   And it probably won&#39;t matter to your son. He<br/>
likely will not even notice if people think he&#39;s being antisocial.   If<br/>
you can get past it in a calm and direct way you&#39;ll feel better.  <br/>
Everyone is feeling more stress at Christmas, with travel and late hours<br/>
and too much food and excitement.   A loving pat on your concerned<br/>
uncle&#39;s arm and a reminder your son is only seven might be all it takes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334317951">Hi- my name is Kirsten and as recommended, I&#39;ve just been reading the <br/>
messages posted for a few weeks without posting.  This is partly because I&#39;m new to <br/>
homeschooling in general and even newer to the concept of unschooling, though <br/>
it seems to be close to what we&#39;ve been doing from the start.  Anyway, after <br/>
reading Amy&#39;s story about her sensitive son, I simply had to write back.  I too <br/>
have a highly sensitive son, and without going into detail about his <br/>
condition, let me recommend a book that gave me the greatest insight into his <br/>
personality and how to make his environment more user friendly.  It&#39;s called The <br/>
Explosive Child by Dr. Ross Green.  There is also a website for Parents and Teachers <br/>
of Explosive Kids  at www.explosivekids.org.  We struggled with my son having <br/>
meltdowns at school, due to his inability to change gears, and low threshold <br/>
for frustration.  After discovering this book, we had a better understanding <br/>
of Skyler and what he needed, but it took me until the beginning of this school <br/>
year to realize the school could not think outside the box enough to provide <br/>
for him.  Thankfully you are already unschooling- which has helped Skyler <br/>
truly draw upon his strengths, rather than highlighting his weaknesses.  It sounds <br/>
as if you already have a grasp of your son&#39;s temperament and are probably <br/>
doing all the right things to help him.  Perhaps this book can give you the <br/>
language to explain his needs to your family.  If you can&#39;t convince them that your <br/>
methods are best, at least they can be respectful of the way you are helping <br/>
him.  Try to have confidence in your choices.  That confidence will be more <br/>
convincing to unsure relatives.  As for your specific problems with the <br/>
holidays, the book will describe a process called collaborative problem solving where <br/>
your child can help you find alternative solutions.  You will be amazed how <br/>
well the child knows what he needs and can handle.  I liked the advice of giving <br/>
him an escape from the crowds and noise.  And if you decide the whole thing <br/>
would be too much, let your relatives know that he becomes painfully anxious <br/>
during these events, and perhaps you can bring him to visit them separately.  <br/>
Small, one on one visits may be more enjoyable for everyone involved.  Design <br/>
the visit around an activity your son enjoys, in an environment he feels most <br/>
safe and in control.  Discuss with him ahead of time what behavior is expected- <br/>
as long as that behavior is within his consistent ability.  For those <br/>
relatives who lack the compassion, or education to understand your son&#39;s needs, you <br/>
could resort to giving it a name like anxiety disorder.  I&#39;ve found that medical <br/>
labels, while otherwise useless, can serve to impress and silence those <br/>
cherished but ignorant relatives and friends.  Well, anyway, please check out that <br/>
book and website.  It sounds like you are way ahead of me- it took so long for <br/>
me to get where you are already.  I had to unlearn so much of my own <br/>
upbringing.  OK, I&#39;m done now- good luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-616241088">In a message dated 12/20/04 8:44:12 AM, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:arcarpenter@...">arcarpenter@...</a> writes:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Here&#39;s where I&#39;m going<br/>
<br/>
so far:  I think unschooling will give him the room to learn to deal<br/>
<br/>
with his own personality and sensitivity.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But too much room can be uncomfortable, and you already know he likes being <br/>
home and in familiar circumstances, where things are quiet.<br/>
<br/>
So if you&#39;re out and about what is the most enclosed and familiar place he <br/>
could be for a re-charge and a rest?  Your lap.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s too old to sit in your lap, find times every half hour or so to get <br/>
him aside and sit with him, hug him, touch his hair maybe (for lots of people <br/>
that&#39;s comforting--maybe you could comb his hair, and smell it, and say nice <br/>
things to him, and then go back out into the fray).   Sometimes still, with my <br/>
kids all teens, if it looks like one is starting to be uncomfortable or <br/>
agitated, I&#39;ll ask for help to get something out of the car, or ask him or her to <br/>
come in the back yard to see something. My mother-in-law has desert tortoises in <br/>
her back yard, and that makes a peaceful break and opportunity for me to chat <br/>
with a kid who otherwise might start to get antsy to go home.  Those things <br/>
were even easier when they were littler.  &quot;Let&#39;s go play with the dog,&quot; or if <br/>
there&#39;s an ice run or grocery store trip needed, volunteer and take your kid(s).<br/>
<br/>
Even during the event you can take a little time out to review what&#39;s <br/>
happening next and what&#39;s expected of them, so that it&#39;s in shorter units than all <br/>
day.  Young kids aren&#39;t clear on lengths of time like four hours or six hours or <br/>
&quot;until tomorrow.&quot;  They need smaller blocks of preparation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-right now he&#39;s very shy, and it<br/>
<br/>
comes across as &quot;rude.&quot;  I&#39;m a bit worried (breathe) that he&#39;s going<br/>
<br/>
to get overwhelmed and have an awful time, and cause quite a bit of<br/>
<br/>
irritation in others at the same time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s really sensitive he might sense if you&#39;re worried about it too, which <br/>
will make a feedback loop back and forth between you.   If you coach him with <br/>
even a few specific phrases to use, you can both feel more comfortable.   <br/>
Maybe one of the coaching moments could be what to do if he can&#39;t think of <br/>
anything to say at all and starts to panic. Maybe he could say &quot;Just a minute&quot; and <br/>
go and talk to you for a bit.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little and going to birthday parties we would talk about <br/>
things to say when you get there, and that way they weren&#39;t just reciting what I <br/>
had said, but had a range of reasonable greetings and the reason for them.   <br/>
&quot;Happy Birthday&quot; or &quot;Thanks for inviting me.&quot;  Then when they were leaving, <br/>
they would (if they remembered) say &quot;I had a good time,&quot; or something more <br/>
specific.   Sometimes I would (and still) say something like that when entering or <br/>
leaving their rooms, and that reinforces the little courtesies some people <br/>
don&#39;t easily figure out on their own.  If Holly invites me in to see something <br/>
she&#39;s arranged, or drawn, or to see something new in her rat cage, I often say <br/>
&quot;Thanks for showing me that!&quot; or &quot;That was fun, thanks,&quot; when I&#39;m leaving.<br/>

Everything your child does is not caused by you (or by unschooling).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is true, but I will admit to having seen some people just not watch <br/>
their kids or not coach them very well at all and say it&#39;s because they&#39;re <br/>
unschooling, and that&#39;s unfortunate for all concerned.  &quot;They&#39;ll grow out of it&quot; is <br/>
another probably truth, but leaving them to grow out of it without direct and <br/>
regular assistance seems cruel to me.<br/>
<br/>
Social situations do have some requirements that anyone who attends should be <br/>
aware of, and I don&#39;t see an advantage of a parent saying &quot;That&#39;s just the <br/>
way he is&quot; while she&#39;s in the other room visiting with adults.  I&#39;m not saying <br/>
that&#39;s happening here or being recommended, but there IS the other side of the <br/>
situation, which is that if the child can&#39;t  be happy and productive in and of <br/>
a social gathering, either the mom should hold him the whole time or have him <br/>
sit next to her the whole time or not have him there until he can handle it <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
We found public places better than homes.  In a person&#39;s home there be <br/>
unguesseable rule and expectations.  Our kids violated protocol just too much at my <br/>
in-laws&#39; when they were little, but if we went to a miniature golf course or a <br/>
restaurant with things for kids to do, everyone got along better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125869067">I agree.  In the heat of the moment, I find myself torn by 1) a<br/>
feeling of helplessness and 2) trying to respect where Fisher is and<br/>
3) wishing I could find the magic button to just make the tantrum<br/>
noise (which hurts my ears) go away.<br/>
<br/>
The helpless feeling comes from this:  once Fisher is upset, it&#39;s very<br/>
unlikely that he&#39;ll go into another room, away from others, without<br/>
being physically put there (which feels like punishment to him -- he<br/>
hates it).  He also will hit me if I try to touch him when his mood is<br/>
wrong, or yell if I try to talk to him or even look his way -- but a<br/>
minute later, still crying the same way, he clings to me.  It&#39;s hard<br/>
to know what to do sometimes.  To those watching, I may seem like I&#39;m<br/>
being too &quot;hands-off&quot; during a tantrum, because in my experience the<br/>
worst of it has to blow over before I can be helpful at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying this to complain -- his feelings are strong and he&#39;s<br/>
doing the best he can.  I&#39;m saying that this is why it&#39;s so important<br/>
that I get as skillful as I can at coaching and observing and finding<br/>
solutions before he gets really upset.  And when I do feel helpless, I<br/>
know that he will grow out of it, and that helps me remember that me<br/>
punishing him or getting upset will NOT be the magic button that makes<br/>
him stop.  I still work to help him as much as I know how.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all who responded -- I love the idea of having a room for<br/>
him with snacks and comfortable things.  I will check in with him<br/>
often.  I think we will bring two cars (we live 5 minutes away) so<br/>
that if he really needs to go home, one person can bring him and the<br/>
others can stay.<br/>
<br/>
And I love the idea of sometimes gently redirecting him in a voice<br/>
loud enough so that others can hear.  Sneaky. &lt;G&gt;  I often try to be<br/>
private when talking to him, but I think it will be helpful for family<br/>
to see how we&#39;re dealing with things.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Social situations do have some requirements that anyone who attends<br/>
should be <br/>

not saying <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s happening here or being recommended, but there IS the other<br/>
side of the <br/>
&gt; situation, which is that if the child can&#39;t  be happy and productive<br/>
in and of <br/>
&gt; a social gathering, either the mom should hold him the whole time or<br/>
have him <br/>

get away from the party or outing for a few minutes. I get to keep <br/>
being social and--well, the other benefit is obvious!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the ideas about talking about things ahead of time. One <br/>
thing especially is talking about what the house is like, where a <br/>
special place to curl up might be, etc. Maybe since it&#39;s close by you <br/>
could take a couple things over ahead of time to make it special or <br/>
plant a couple suprises if that would help.<br/>
<br/>
I knew our issues at MIL&#39;s house would be food for ds. We had a <br/>
gentle talk ahead of time about how long we&#39;d be there and how he&#39;d <br/>
really need to eat something to keep from feeling grumpy. He didn&#39;t <br/>
eat more than a few bites of bread and some fruit (and almost skipped <br/>
that when dh refered to it as fruit salad, heaven help us), but a <br/>
while after that I suggested milk with dessert and that was enough. <br/>
He felt bad when everyone started telling how he needs to eat more, <br/>
but he just curled up with me and then was okay. His first box of <br/>
Lincoln Logs and older cousins to help build really helped too.<br/>
<br/>
Dd ended up running around the house hysterically chasing BIL&#39;s dog <br/>
for about 15 minutes before we left. Everyone was really nice about <br/>
it...especially the dog who only nipped her gently once. I kept her <br/>
from hurting the dog and otherwise tried to stay out of her way. I <br/>
was really, really relieved that no one gave me a hard time and told <br/>
me what I should be doing to her. They just laughed about how much <br/>
she&#39;s like her aunt...<br/>

beforehand -- sometimes he has too long to dwell on something and gets<br/>
himself worked up that way. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
He has been doing a great job identifying which situations are tough<br/>
for him, and some of the reasons why.  It&#39;s hard to express how proud<br/>
I am of him for that -- it&#39;s tough work. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope it encourages you to know that my now-17 yo was EXACTLY like <br/>
this - and she&#39;s now an accomplished young woman who can go anywhere <br/>
and people constantly tell me how poised and delightful she is. Only <br/>
her immediate family really knows how sensitive she STILL is and how <br/>
explosive she can be and how much harder life seems to be for her than <br/>
for most other people. That temperament doesn&#39;t just &quot;go away&quot; - but <br/>
she uses it in her theatrical life and that helps a lot. And she is <br/>
smart and has learned to see the repercussions of her own behavior, so <br/>
she is learning to take care of herself and her relationships.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to suggest the possibility that a LOT of dramatic play would <br/>
be really useful - maybe make a special effort just before you have to <br/>
go to your family&#39;s to have lots of unstructured pretend play time <br/>
available for him. In other words, think of him as needing to be filled <br/>
up before you go, because he&#39;s going to be drained while you&#39;re out. <br/>
Roxana&#39;s ability to escape into her own pretend play was such a <br/>
critical element of her life - if she didn&#39;t get enough of it she <br/>
became far far more difficult to live with for others.  She was happier <br/>
if she was in costume, too, most of the time - even when going to <br/>
relatives&#39; homes for holidays,etc.<br/>
<br/>
I remember just nodding and agreeing - &quot;Yeah, she&#39;s an odd kid, isn&#39;t <br/>
she?&quot; I mean - so what?<br/>
<br/>
I also had to leave her alone a bit when she had a tantrum - <br/>
approaching her would make things worse. And the worst part was <br/>
convincing other people to just leave her alone - because, like you <br/>
said, they&#39;d think I was awful not to go comfort her and they&#39;d just be <br/>
sure THEY could do it. HA.<br/>
<br/>
A suggestion - talk openly with him before you go - about how draining <br/>
it can be to be around all those people for so long and then the two of <br/>
you come up with signals -- one signal he can give you when he thinks <br/>
he really needs to get away for a little while and another signal you <br/>
can give you him to ask him if he&#39;s &quot;okay.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And - - make a HUGE effort to connect deeply with him very very often <br/>
while you&#39;re there - look deeply into his eyes every chance you get, <br/>
touch him - even if just to brush his hand, and mouth &quot;I love you,&quot; at <br/>
him. You can&#39;t do this too much - even every 15 minutes during times <br/>
you feel are more stressful. Mostly just be sure to catch his eyes and <br/>
look deeply into them!!! That&#39;s home and comfort - more than anything <br/>
else you can do, probably.<br/>
<br/>
Personal cd players are fantastic - they can let a kid escape into <br/>
their own world - either with books on cd or music.<br/>
If he&#39;s a movie watcher - even a personal dvd player might be WELL <br/>
worth the expense.<br/>

made myself, but now that you say it, it makes total sense.  That is<br/>
*so* the kind of kid he is.  I&#39;ve written it on the calendar so I will<br/>
schedule my own day around it (he usually needs me for a playslave,<br/>
YKWIM?) -- an hour or more of Pretend before we leave the house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267412543">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who aren&#39;t aware of the *Shine* list, it&#39;s for <br/>
Unschooling Highly Sensitive/Out of Sync/otherwise non-typical <br/>
children.  For the past few months, we&#39;ve been discussing the <br/>
holidays and our children...<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/shinewithunschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have time to read all of the posts, but I did want to talk <br/>
about not only helping the child to get away to a place alone, but <br/>
bringing with you (at ALL times, not just holiday gatherings) <br/>
something that can be a place where he can escape in his mind.  I <br/>
refer to items like these as *safe zone* items...Jake never leaves <br/>
the house without his gameboy, sketch pad, books, or magazines.  <br/>
These things are what he LOVES, the things that his heart holds a <br/>
deep connection with.  And these are the things that he *needs*, <br/>
especially when he&#39;s feeling overwhelmed and anxious.<br/>

Be Well ~<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is EXTREMELY crucial.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often talked about how Jake seems to *fly away* from his body <br/>
during overwhelming occassions.  I have done this *connection* with <br/>
him since he was a small child.  This connection brings him back to <br/>
Who He Is, grounds him, and keeps him from behaving in a way that <br/>
will make him feel bad about himself afterwards ~ because that&#39;s the <br/>
very thing I&#39;m trying to avoid.  It&#39;s not so much for the social <br/>
gathering...it&#39;s for my child&#39;s Spirit.  I want him to feel good <br/>
about himself, and when he does something that he&#39;s not happy with, <br/>
he re-lives that moment and lives with deep guilt long afterwards <br/>
(really...sometimes it&#39;s YEARS).<br/>
<br/>
My child deserves to Shine, so I put my life&#39;s energy into making <br/>
sure that he does.  Carefully selecting what social situations we go <br/>
into along with a huge amount of preparation ~ emotional, mental and <br/>
physical ~ is absolutely necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803226107">My DS is 6 1/2 and a SK with high energy as a bonus. Two big things <br/>
I&#39;ve been learning are (a) learn his cues - meltdowns don&#39;t really <br/>
come out of nowhere even if it seems like it. There&#39;s something <br/>
that&#39;s been building somewhere if you look for it (b) learn *my* <br/>
issues - for example, I have more trouble focusing on him and tuning <br/>
out others and being calm if *I&#39;m* hungry and tired.<br/>
<br/>
When we *know* it&#39;s going to a long drawn out time before we eat <br/>
(Christmas Eve at SIL&#39;s is notorious for starting the gathering <br/>
around 3 and not getting to dinner until after 7!), we make sure to <br/>
pack snacks for DS - yes, there&#39;ll probably be tons of food BUT it&#39;s <br/>
often mostly cookies and chips and sodas and such. We make sure to <br/>
pack some protein - sometimes we&#39;ll even make a big whatever (ham <br/>
and cream cheese rollups for instance) and bring that as an <br/>
appetizer for everyone - that way we *know* there will be *protein* <br/>
for DS - a major component, we&#39;ve found, in helping him maintain <br/>
equilibrium.<br/>
<br/>
Finding those particular things that are calming is important too. <br/>
For my DS, for instance, rubbing his back helps to keep him tuned <br/>
in. And it helps me tune in to him as well and anticipate how things <br/>
are going. If he&#39;s been going and going, I&#39;ll try to make a space <br/>
near me and call him over for a short rest - and I&#39;ll blow across <br/>
his hair - he likes that and it is calming to him. Then he can go <br/>
back to running but in control of himself again. If there&#39;s not a <br/>
lot of space for him to move (he HAS TO exert his muscles some), <br/>
we&#39;ll play &quot;basketball&quot; - I hold out my hand at his head level and <br/>
he bounces up and down just tapped my hand with his head so it looks <br/>
as if I&#39;m &quot;dribbling&quot; him. A little of that, a hug, and he&#39;s off <br/>
again, but back to himself. One time I asked him what was going on <br/>
with him (it was one of those days) and he said his energy gauge was <br/>
too full. So we worked out ways to get his energy gauge back into a <br/>
better range.<br/>
<br/>
If you know in advance that folks will be trying to interact, stick <br/>
close. I&#39;ve found that physical contact with me kind of bolsters him <br/>
when he&#39;s having a hard time sociably. Just as I know that being <br/>
close to DH helps me because I&#39;m not a naturally social person.<br/>
<br/>
It really will work out over time. Stay your course with confidence -<br/>
 do what you and your family need.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642375915">Have you ever tried Rescue Remedy??  For us, it&#39;s great for when that <br/>
meltdown begins and you just don&#39;t know what to do (as either the melter <br/>
or the watcher) - I don&#39;t know how, but it brings back focus in the <br/>
situation.  When it&#39;s not appropriate to squirt the stuff (sometimes in <br/>
the belly button is just the distraction Hayden needs) I put some on my <br/>
fingertips to rub onto any pulse point, it quietly calms us both.  When <br/>
we&#39;re going anywhere we *know* is stressful, I&#39;ll put a few drops in <br/>
everyones water bottles to &#39;keep the edge off&#39; -- even if you have it on <br/>

Yes!  In my own thinking, I was starting to deal with this exact issue<br/>
-- Fisher feels like a freak when he loses it (like I felt when I was<br/>

broght a laptop so she could either watch dvd&#39;s or<br/>
play games...and that kept her busy and happy (with<br/>
mom and dad and sister each checking in on her every<br/>
10 minutes or so) until the party wound down...oh, and<br/>
we also took a walk, all of us and an adult friend, to<br/>
the co-op about 11:30, and that was a fun adventure<br/>
just about the time the room was getting boring.<br/>

we had been to last year, and they had kids menus<br/>

phased out the kids menu due to lack of interest, and<br/>
although she searched the waitress couldn&#39;t find one<br/>
in the back, and Emma and I ended up coming home early<br/>
as that just set the mood for the whole evening...<br/>

Crayons and paper are cheap and worth carrying with you.<br/>

ok that you set Johnny up in the rec room, or the back<br/>

<br/>
True.  But even if she agrees and you pass that on, something could happen to <br/>
make it unavailable.  Even is someone chose a kid-friendly restaurant, they <br/>
might be out of children&#39;s menus and crayons.<br/>
<br/>
Helping a child who doesn&#39;t like change to accept the possibility of change <br/>
is a good thing.<br/>
Making them promises you can&#39;t (nor anyone else could) keep is assured to <br/>
make the situation worse.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby hated change as a kid.  (Still, at 18, prefers to avoid it if that&#39;s <br/>
convenient.)  He wanted to know what was happening in advance and he wanted it <br/>
to be like the last time.   I learned to qualify statements with &quot;might&quot; and <br/>
&quot;probably&quot; and &quot;I&#39;ll try.&quot;   I was telling the truth AND being helpful when I <br/>
suggested what was possible or likely.  Once I moved into &quot;will&quot; and &quot;yours&quot; and <br/>
&quot;for sure,&quot; I was part of the problem and not the solution.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;will&quot; and &quot;for sure&quot; a mom is most likely to be able to ensure is her <br/>
own availability and attention, and there even could come a day when that fails.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dd has been like this since age 2 (she&#39;s 5 now). If she is in the <br/>
midst of a meltdown (and the slightest thing in my eyes can set her off <br/>
- like me opening the door when she (in her mind) thought she was going <br/>
to do it) I pretty much need to stay close but NOT touch her. If I do <br/>
she will usually hit me in the face. I have no idea why except that she <br/>
is so overwhelmed she can&#39;t control it. She screams, growls, kicks, <br/>
clenches her teeth etc, I am a very mild-mannered person but also <br/>
highly sensitive so her outbursts really freaked me out in the <br/>
beginning. I tried to &quot;fix&quot; her for a year. It was awful. I felt like a <br/>
failure and she became neurotic. Luckily I saw Anne O speak (thank you <br/>
Anne!) and now try and just help her cope before she is overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
I have a bizarre family with lots of cousins who yell at their kids and <br/>
it makes her (and me) very uncomfortable. I am always checking in with <br/>
her and it definitely helps - as does lap time. Some relatives have <br/>
learned to respect that she&#39;s sensitive, others probably never will. <br/>
Those are the relatives I would never leave her alone with and try to <br/>
avoid while she&#39;s young.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55229264">Wow! Your description of your daughter sounds so much like mine! She <br/>
LIVES for costumes too, will wear several a day, and takes on other <br/>
personalities in her imaginary play - male and female roles. She&#39;s very <br/>
outgoing, very perfectionist, and very intense. I want to keep that <br/>
intensity alive but help her learn to channel it into positive outlets <br/>
- like acting (which she is very good at - I really believed she was <br/>
crying yesterday and I said, &quot;What&#39;s the matter?!&quot; and she immediately <br/>
grinned and said, &quot;Mom, I&#39;m acting!&quot;)!<br/>
