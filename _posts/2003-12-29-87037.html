&lt;&lt;  I AM one of those organized people, and my point was that just because <br/>
*I* want things &#39;organized&#39; doesn&#39;t make it IMPORTANT.  I think it&#39;s almost <br/>
always the organized people that hold the resentment towards the <br/>
less-than-organized.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my husband cleans the kitchen.  Not often.  If he did it often, or <br/>
did it with me, that might be better.  He doesn&#39;t like to be in the kitchen <br/>
with another person, though.  It really bothers him to bump into somone, and I <br/>
don&#39;t like it when he puts things away, generally, because he&#39;s irritating.<br/>
<br/>
I have places things go.  Muffin pans are just stacked in with pizza pans and <br/>
cookie sheets.  The organization has two priorities:  (1) the thing last used <br/>
goes on top, unless (2) that will make the pile unstable, in which case it <br/>
goes wherever keeps it from falling.<br/>
<br/>
Keith thinks that&#39;s wrong.  But his new improved way will take more room or <br/>
result in an unstable pile.<br/>
<br/>
I have a drawer for sharp things and another drawer for things used for <br/>
stovetop purposes that aren&#39;t sharp.  This is a safety thing.  We only have one <br/>
danger-drawer.    Keith doesn&#39;t understand the danger-drawer concept and <br/>
sometimes a knife or can opener or peeler is in the safe drawer.   <br/>
<br/>
I have old bowls stacked separately from matching sets of bowls.  Keith <br/>
stacks them mixed up.<br/>
<br/>
He loses things.  He makes places up.  It&#39;s more important to him that the <br/>
counter is cleaned off regardless of what he shoves where.   I thing &quot;shoving <br/>
where&quot; is rude, and the counter doesn&#39;t need to be clean.   <br/>
<br/>
His stuff in the garage is really well organized, and sometimes I hesitate to <br/>
use something because I know I can&#39;t put it back the way it was wrapped up <br/>
and I probably can&#39;t reach the place he had it anyway.  So years ago I figured <br/>
out that I use it, I arrange it artfully in the middle of a space, and I <br/>
apologize to him for not having put it back.  That makes him happy.  He puts it <br/>
back.  It&#39;s better for me than the result of my having put it back in the wrong <br/>
place, or turned righty instead of lefty.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted to use our old computer.  I cleaned off about eight square feet of <br/>
desk space (it&#39;s a door on short filing cabinets).  That made him happy.  I <br/>
totally removed the hamster and most of my regular stuff so he could lay whole <br/>
folders out on flat space.  Cheap thrills for him, that I did a totally <br/>
&quot;counter-cleaning.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Lucky for me I remembered where I put the hamster.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been together 25 years, so I guess he&#39;s survived the organization I <br/>
have which really looks like no organization, and I&#39;ve survived his <br/>
looks-like-organization which is sometimes just &quot;clean some flat space at any cost.&quot;<br/>
