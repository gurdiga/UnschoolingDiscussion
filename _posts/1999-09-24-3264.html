 Tami, try acidophilus milk. It is easier to digest and it tastes the same.<br/>
 It may help. Worth a try anyway. &gt;&gt;<br/>
Both my kids are allergic to dairy--we tried lactaid--that might work for <br/>
you.  Also soy milk--There is a product called Silk-it&#39;s in the dairy case, <br/>
that both my kids love. One will drink soy milk, the other vanilla rice <br/>
dream(enriched), I bake with soy milk, though. It&#39;s much more like cow&#39;s <br/>
milk, and you can add a little lemon to make &quot;buttermilk&quot;<br/>
