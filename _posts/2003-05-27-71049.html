<br/>
Thank you for posting this page again. I have it saved but I forget it is <br/>
there. I forwarded it on to a friend who is beginning to HS. I think she wants to <br/>
Unschool but is buying a few subjects.  : / I keep explaining the Deschooling <br/>
and she is convinced it will happen over the summer. <br/>
I almost feel like she doesn&#39;t think that our Unschooling is learning. Or <br/>
that im dumbing my kids but not using anything.<br/>
I caught myself flipping through a &quot;complete curriculum&quot; the other day at the <br/>
store.  I didn&#39;t plan on buying it but it was reassuring to look in it and <br/>
know that the 11 yr. old already knows all the junk in it from living.  I guess <br/>
some of the conversations are rubbing off on me: / <br/>
Or maybe she thinks this way because of the below paragraph.  I don&#39;t speak <br/>
my concerns to her about this because I don&#39;t think it will help her along the <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
My kids pick at each other so much that I worry about what I am doing wrong <br/>
as far as Unschooling goes.  The competition between the two is maddening. They <br/>
are 3 . 5 and 11.  My 11 yr. old was in school for 3 . 5 years and some of <br/>
the issues where that he was always a target. Why is he doing this at home if he <br/>
hated it so much?<br/>
<br/>
This is major concern in our home that causes so much parental involvement. <br/>
What I mean is I know how we deal with it is no good.  I do try to show him the <br/>
flip side, how would he like it if someone said that to him and sending him <br/>
to his room.  Its just non stop he comes into a room and jumps on the couch or <br/>
bed while she is involved in something or makes teasing comments like &quot;I have <br/>
an Ice Cream&quot; or &quot;Cassidy look what I have Na na na na bo bo&quot; Then she <br/>
screams, wakes the baby its a mess..........<br/>
 He is fine with other kids it&#39;s just his sister.<br/>
The 3 . 5 yr. old isn&#39;t as un-knowledgable as he thinks.  She has him figured <br/>
out and knows what he is doing is wrong.  He at times spells something to her <br/>
and she knows what he has spelled. So I guess I dont look at her as 3 . 5 but <br/>
more intellectually as a 5 or 6 yr. old.  She can tell time, spell certain <br/>
words and can read me like a book.<br/>
<br/>
I may be answering my own question but did we (DH and I) cause this? I have <br/>
tried to be fair in what and when I speak to each child and how far I let <br/>
things go.  When they begin to hit and hurt each other I step in.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone see this in their home and then it went away? <br/>
Suggestions?<br/>

<br/>
I think most of the time I know in my gut what needs to be done/what I should <br/>
address and what not. I think I get into the thinking that it will work <br/>
against our Unschooling.  <br/>
What I mean is that I paint a picture in my mind of what someone or a group <br/>
looks like. I almost make it look super human.  For instance I may think <br/>
Unschoolers dont have sibling issues, spouse disagreements, untidy homes and so on. <br/>
The only way I know is to read the emails.<br/>
I dont know of more than a couple total Unschoolers here. Here some say <br/>
unschooling but the fact is that they still schedule music, swimming or some kind <br/>
of class for their kids. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess I take a person or a group I respect hold them up high and follow <br/>
as much as I can.  I may take some or all whatever applies to my family that <br/>
isn&#39;t working for us at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
I love my kids and I want to do right by them. I also know that Nicholas is 1 <br/>
and I do not want to go though all the bickering again.<br/>
<br/>
My son just came down and gave me a kiss and a hug (he does every night). <br/>
Kinda makes all the issues of the day drift away : )<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You must have about the same gap between the 6 mo and the 3 as I did.  I dont <br/>
think we had that too much. Cassidy loved when I nursed as she was able to be <br/>
on the bed/chair with me. She would often talk to him or rub his head.  She <br/>
is always with me still and he is 1 on Wed.<br/>
If I put him to bed before she is able to go through her kiss hug routine she <br/>
freaks out until I let her go in. If he wakes during the day she asks if she <br/>
can go see him while I prepare his cup or bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Does she have her own baby to feed? Can you pump any so she can feed her <br/>
also?<br/>
It does get better.  Cassidy and Nicholas get along very well. I only wish <br/>
she and the oldest got along like that.<br/>
They do have their moments:<br/>
Last night they washed dishes and played in the water together. (11 & 3.5) I <br/>
just listened in it was great.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>we have a similar age difference; andre was 2 years 4 months old when his <br/>
sisters were born.<br/>
<br/>
does the tackle-hug happen when the little one is on the floor?  that <br/>
always seemed awkward to me, because the older child has to get to the <br/>
younger&#39;s level, and it&#39;s easy to topple over.<br/>
<br/>
when rose & joelle were about that age & on the floor, i&#39;d suggest that <br/>
andre show them toys or sing to them.  i tried to explain that this was <br/>
their play time, and they&#39;d love to have cuddle time later.  that seemed to <br/>
help.<br/>
<br/>
we made sure andre special hugging time with each of his sisters, as well <br/>
as alone with us.  he always loved what he called &#39;family hugs&#39; (mommy, <br/>
daddy & andre before the girls were born), so we did our best to include <br/>
everyone in some hugs.<br/>
<br/>
(of course, i was in a sleep-deprived fog most of the time, so i hope i&#39;m <br/>
remembering correctly!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>is sadie exploring nora&#39;s face and/or reactions?  we had some of <br/>
that.  when i was just nursing one baby, i could have andre on the side of <br/>
me where her feet were, so he couldn&#39;t reach her face, and we&#39;d read or <br/>
talk or sing or make funny faces...  when double nursing, it was harder to <br/>
get him cuddled in too, but some of the other things still worked.  i seem <br/>
to recall having him show me parts of his own face & body, and point to <br/>
mine, as well.  and asking him if he wanted to pat the girls&#39; faces & heads <br/>
gently when they weren&#39;t nursing.<br/>
<br/>
how does nora react?  my kids all went through a stage around 4-6 months <br/>
old where they were easily distracted while nursing.  it made each session <br/>
take longer & sometimes frustrating to me.  on again, off again, etc.  i <br/>
remember trying to explain that to him, e.g. the girls will be done sooner <br/>
if we don&#39;t play with them while they nurse.  i can&#39;t remember when it <br/>
worked.  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-210709231">your kids are the same span as mine! I have all girls, 10.5, almost three and 6 months and the funniest thing to me is the fights my three year old and ten year old have! What a surpise that was to me! I thought for sure that they would have too far of a span to really fight about anything. My dh and I try hard not to laugh as my ten year old and three year old try to have a serious debate. I am so grateful for my ten year old though. She is a huge help with them both. Last night I cooked for ten and my dd entertained the little ones for me. What a blessing to have her in my life and theirs. I told my dh this morning what a great mother she would be some day... maybe I shoudl tell her this later:) Anyhow, that toddler, oh she will be a fabulous adult... but for now, I just practice patience, patience, patience. She is so strong willed. I will try the bottle idea. My dh gives her a bottle on tues and thurs mornings while I work, that would be fun for Sadie. Kelli<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You must have about the same gap between the 6 mo and the 3 as I did.  I dont <br/>
think we had that too much. Cassidy loved when I nursed as she was able to be <br/>
on the bed/chair with me. She would often talk to him or rub his head.  She <br/>
is always with me still and he is 1 on Wed.<br/>
If I put him to bed before she is able to go through her kiss hug routine she <br/>
freaks out until I let her go in. If he wakes during the day she asks if she <br/>
can go see him while I prepare his cup or bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Does she have her own baby to feed? Can you pump any so she can feed her <br/>
also?<br/>
It does get better.  Cassidy and Nicholas get along very well. I only wish <br/>
she and the oldest got along like that.<br/>
They do have their moments:<br/>
Last night they washed dishes and played in the water together. (11 & 3.5) I <br/>
just listened in it was great.<br/>

I too thought the 11 and 3 yr. old would get along but they often do not.  My <br/>
11 yr. old is a boy and does help a lot especially around dinner and things <br/>
like holding the baby so I can get a bottle or put my coat on.<br/>
The 3 yr. old will be 4 in October. She is a big helper also.  I see such a <br/>
large difference between the oldest and middle child. She is an independent <br/>
player and he has more of a difficult time with that. My guess is it si from <br/>
being in school. Wish I could turn back time and do it right. <br/>
I have watched the two of them the past couple days and I have to say he does <br/>
try to help her with things but she just screams.  I think she knows she can <br/>
control situations by screaming cuz we all let her have her way so she doesn&#39;t <br/>
wake the baby. That in it self has created a big screamer. Just have to <br/>
reverse it now.<br/>

&gt; your kids are the same span as mine! I have all girls, 10.5, almost three <br/>
&gt; and 6 months and the funniest thing to me is the fights my three year old and <br/>
&gt; ten year old have! What a surpise that was to me! I thought for sure that they <br/>
&gt; would have too far of a span to really fight about anything. My dh and I try <br/>
&gt; hard not to laugh as my ten year old and three year old try to have a <br/>
&gt; serious debate. I am so grateful for my ten year old though. She is a huge help <br/>
&gt; with them both. Last night I cooked for ten and my dd entertained the little <br/>
&gt; ones for me. What a blessing to have her in my life and theirs. I told my dh <br/>
&gt; this morning what a great mother she would be some day... maybe I shoudl tell <br/>
&gt; her this later:) Anyhow, that toddler, oh she will be a fabulous adult... but <br/>
&gt; for now, I just practice patience, patience, patience. She is so strong <br/>
&gt; willed. I will try the bottle idea. My dh gives her a bottle on tues and thurs <br/>
&gt; mornings while I work, that would be fun for Sadie. Kelli<br/>
