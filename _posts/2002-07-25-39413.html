<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142272757">My kids are young yet so I have only one reader. He learned to read on his <br/>
own just before his fourth birthday. I never pushed it- he loved to have <br/>
books read to him and I just answered his questions about, &quot;What does this <br/>
word say? &quot; He&#39;s now approaching 5 and reads many books per day, and some of <br/>
them are books that I&#39;m sure he wouldn&#39;t have been introduced to in school <br/>
for several years. <br/>
