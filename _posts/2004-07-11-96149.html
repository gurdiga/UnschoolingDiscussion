<div id="ygrps-yiv-292857283">I had this book about 8 years ago and was so outraged I called  social <br/>
services where they live. I cannot believe that this book is still in  existence. I <br/>
happened to find a copy at Goodwill last week. It is the most  disgusting, <br/>
sick handbook on how to torture your children. These people cannot  be sane. I <br/>
will do all I can to get it off of Amazon and anywhere else it is  sold.<br/>
