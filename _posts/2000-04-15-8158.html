&gt; Q: How many homeschoolers does it take to screw in a light bulb?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A: Gasp! Is it legal to change your own?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shouldn&#39;t you let a trained professional do it? Won&#39;t your little lamp<br/>
&gt; be brighter if someone who studied for four years (after barely being<br/>
&gt; able to turn on their own<br/>
&gt; lamp) changes your light bulb? What if you screw it in wrong? What if<br/>
&gt; you leave something out? Don&#39;t you think you should give your little<br/>
&gt; nursery lamp a chance to<br/>
&gt; be part of a huge, glowing marquee or chandelier? Bulbs do need to hang<br/>
&gt; in groups, you know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Besides, why do you think light bulbs come in multi packs? You don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; just go out and get a single light bulb! If one light bulb needs fixing,<br/>
&gt; then you know the others<br/>
&gt; are ready for it, too. Give your professional a 12 pack and let him/her<br/>
&gt; change them all at once. It&#39;s much more efficient and gets you on a<br/>
&gt; schedule with all your light<br/>
&gt; fixtures. And yes, I know you will end up sending some perfectly good<br/>
&gt; light bulbs to the trash that way, but on the whole it&#39;s best. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; regret the ones that are lost<br/>
&gt; to the dump. They were probably pretty dim anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Look, I sent my lamps to the shop for light-bulb changing and my lamps<br/>
&gt; work okay, don&#39;t they? Oh, well, except for that three-way lamp in the<br/>
&gt; living room which<br/>
&gt; got a stupid 40 watt, low-lumens bulb put in when it should have gotten<br/>
&gt; a three way bulb with up to 200 watts. I was a little peeved at that at<br/>
&gt; first, but I just put the<br/>
&gt; lamp over in the corner where I never sit to read, so it&#39;s okay.<br/>
