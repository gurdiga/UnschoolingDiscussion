<div id="ygrps-yiv-108635358">Following The Lord of the Rings success at the 2004 Academy AwardsTM-where <br/>
the film picked up 11 Oscars-the Museum of Science, Boston announces June 1 <br/>
ticket sales for The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy-The Exhibition. <br/>
Ticketing Information<br/>
May 1, 2004: Priority ticket sales for members begin at 9 a.m.<br/>
June 1, 2004: Public ticket sales begin at 9 a.m.<br/>
August 1, 2004: The Lord of the Rings Motion Picture Trilogy<br/>
-The Exhibition opens in Boston.<br/>
<br/>
 Members: Non-members:<br/>
Adults: $3 Adults: $19<br/>
Seniors: $3 Seniors: $17<br/>
Children: $3 Children: $16<br/>
<br/>
Admission to the exhibition will be by timed ticket only and includes a <br/>
separate ticket for General Exhibit Hall admission that can be used on the same day <br/>
or within six months. Members enjoy year round free General Exhibit Hall <br/>
admission.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This summer travel to Middle-earth...<br/>
 The exhibition features hundreds of pieces of memorabilia from the epic film <br/>
trilogy including original costumes and jewelry, as well as the One Ring. <br/>
Immersed in film props, visitors can explore the groundbreaking technology used <br/>
in the films such as computer-generated special effects and animatronics, and <br/>
hear from cast, crew, and director in exclusive 〓behind-the-scenes〓 interviews <br/>
shown on videos throughout the exhibit.<br/>
 The exhibit includes massive models, an 〓armor corridor〓, and a display on <br/>
prosthetics including Hobbit feet and Orc teeth. An interactive scaling <br/>
activity reveals how filmmakers can make the actors appear to be tiny Hobbit-sized <br/>
or large wizard-sized, using an ingenious mix of trick photography, forced <br/>
perspectives, and props made at different scales. Visitors can also see themselves <br/>
transformed as Hobbit or wizard-sized in their own photo.<br/>
 The exhibit was developed by the Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in <br/>
partnership with New Line Cinema, the producers of the film trilogy. Following <br/>
its run at the Science Museum in London on January 11, 2004, the exhibit will <br/>
show in Singapore before coming to the Museum of Science, Boston in August <br/>
2004. The next city on the tour after Boston is Sydney.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137264752">Not sure how young your kids are, but when I was in middle <br/>
school/high school my dad often took me down for musicals and we&#39;d <br/>
spend the day.  At that age what I loved most was that he&#39;d let me <br/>
plan the agenda, so I looked at a good tourist&#39;s map of Boston and <br/>
picked the agenda, and we&#39;d ride the T from place to place (I think <br/>
you can still get a day pass for like $5).  My favorites were <br/>
browsing Faneuil (sp?) Hall, which is a big marketplace with <br/>
vendors, restaurants, etc. and lunch at Chinatown.  The map also <br/>
shows &quot;music district,&quot; etc., as far as shops.  I&#39;m not sure <br/>
what &quot;inexpensive&quot; is for you, as I consider the aquarium to be very <br/>
expensive for a family outing (it&#39;s our &quot;big&quot; summer outing we&#39;ve <br/>
planned), but of course there&#39;s also the Boston Children&#39;s museum, <br/>
the Museum of Science (where Morgaine and I had a blast on our <br/>
special day out a few months ago -- another big expedition for us <br/>
since she&#39;d been asking to see so many things from it), there&#39;s the <br/>
art museum, and lots of other things.  The aquarium is easily a half-<br/>
day&#39;s trip at least for most kids taking their time.  Really a good <br/>
tourist&#39;s map is your best bet though.  Show it to the kids and see <br/>
what catches their eye!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879880056">When thinking of taking in Boston sites, look to your local museum and zoo <br/>
memberships for ideas and reciprocity!  In fact, check out the *connecting* <br/>
agency for a list of all the participating museums and zoos.  The children&#39;s <br/>
museum here charges $70 for a family membership and the zoo is $60... on <br/>
line, I found a zoo in KS where the family membership is $40 and a <br/>
children&#39;s center in Pierre, SD with a $35 family membership; neither had <br/>
issue with taking money from someone who didn&#39;t live there.  Both <br/>
memberships allow me to go locally AND nationally!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-336231669">One of our favorite things to do in Boston is the contemporary art <br/>
museum <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.icaboston.org/Home">http://www.icaboston.org/Home</a> (And it&#39;s free on Thursdays <br/>
after 5!).  <br/>
<br/>
The science museum is cool too. And remember, if you have a <br/>
membership to another science museum you can probably get into <br/>
Boston&#39;s science museum free.  We have a membership at the Whitaker <br/>
center (Harrisburg) and got into Baltimore&#39;s and Boston&#39;s science <br/>
museums free.  (I think you can get into the Boston children&#39;s museum <br/>
with the science museum membership too).  For those with younger <br/>
children, the children&#39;s museum in Boston is AWESOME!  <br/>
<br/>
Boston&#39;s aquarium is okay.  If you&#39;re used to going to Baltimore&#39;s <br/>
though, Baltimore&#39;s is better.  <br/>
<br/>
This summer (In July) I&#39;d like to take my kids to Blue Man Group <br/>
show, which is supposed to be a fun show.  <br/>
<br/>
The Duck Tours are fun if you&#39;re new to Boston.  <br/>
