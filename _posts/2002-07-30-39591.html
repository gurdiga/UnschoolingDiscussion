<div id="ygrps-yiv-450028857">Dear List,<br/>
  I&#39;m all for waiting &#39;til the kids are ready to learn things &#39;n all, <br/>
but when they are out of the &quot;norm&quot; like my non-reading 9 year old, <br/>
what kind of protection is there against the school system?  If a <br/>
nosy neighbor reports an unschooler to the school board, what can <br/>
they do?  I&#39;m a little nervous about the wrong person finding out <br/>
that Kaitlin doesn&#39;t read yet and then I end up with someone from the <br/>
local school system looking into the situation.  If that hypothetical <br/>
person isn&#39;t understanding of unschooling, I could possibly end up <br/>
with my kids taken away or something.<br/>
<br/>
  Realize this is all hypothetical.  My family is in no danger, but <br/>
it does make me a little nervous at times.  Especially this late at <br/>
night.  For some reason it seems like everything is worse in the <br/>
dark.  In the day I don&#39;t even think about this kind of thing, <br/>
usually.<br/>
<br/>
  BTW, I live in Illinois, which is one of the easiest states to HS <br/>
in.  No reports, testing, home visits, or anything.  I&quot;m just a <br/>
little worried about the wrong person finding out and then trying to <br/>
report us as being negligent.  I&#39;m basically looking for reassurance <br/>
that it will be okay, but I need to be realistic about things too.  <br/>

<br/>
First, because you&#39;re in Illinois you don&#39;t need to worry for a fraction of a <br/>
second about &quot;having your kids taken away or something&quot;. In Illinois there is <br/>
a law that says that DCFS (Department of Children and Family Services) is not <br/>
empowered to investigate allegations of educational neglect. Period. <br/>
<br/>
As for the folks who COULD investigate - your local school board has no <br/>
power. The regional superintendant might check you out if there were a <br/>
complaint . The best defense is a good offense. The superintendant doesn&#39;t <br/>
have the authority to approve your curriculum or test your child or anything <br/>
else. If contacted you send a registered letter asserting that the child is <br/>
being educated in accordance with the law (there&#39;s a sample letter at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage.bushnell.net/~peanuts/illaws.html">http://homepage.bushnell.net/~peanuts/illaws.html</a>  &quot;All the Illinois <br/>
Homeschool Laws.&quot;). You might or might not want to address the reading issue <br/>
if it was addressed to you by saying something like &quot;she is participating in <br/>
age-appropriate reading instruction.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Does she read not a word? Do you know other 9yos to be around them in casual <br/>
situations? She might or might not actually be far below the average for her <br/>
age, you know.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t put her in situations where &quot;the wrong person&quot; would end up quizzing <br/>
her and putting her on the spot, for her sake. She doesn&#39;t need the <br/>
aggravation. If she&#39;s in situations where she&#39;ll need help reading, where she <br/>
really wants to be there, try to take the iniative and address it before it <br/>
comes up. Tell the adults you don&#39;t want her put on the spot because it will <br/>
hinder her learning to read, figure out how to support her in doing what she <br/>
wants to do.<br/>

ahead of time.  He said they get lots of boys who don&#39;t read well at that <br/>
age, even though they go to school.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s something to remember on the reading issue.  My son has a couple of <br/>
friends whose reading skills have pretty much mirrored his . . . and they <br/>
both have always gone to school.<br/>

Illinois doesn&#39;t have a homeschooling law at all. We have fifty year old case <br/>

I can chase it down further for you when I get back in two weeks. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389180120">I talked to her Sunday School teacher the past two times she&#39;s gone <br/>
into another class and they haven&#39;t had a problem yet.  We don&#39;t do <br/>
scouts, so that isn&#39;t a problem.  She was in Vacation Bible School <br/>
last week and there wasn&#39;t a problem there, either.  It helped that <br/>
her teacher is a HSing friend of mine and is supportive of <br/>
unschooling. :)<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m starting to think that lots of kids her age (9 or so) don&#39;t <br/>
really do a lot of reading outside of what they have to do for <br/>
school.  It just doesn&#39;t seem to come up much when the kids are in a <br/>
group.  They mostly talk, they don&#39;t read.  I&#39;m probably worrying for <br/>
nothing, as usual!  Thanks for the posts.  Djuana<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948667713">Deborah,<br/>
  Thanks for the reply and the link.  I bookmarked it for future <br/>
reference.  There&#39;s a whole lot of information there.<br/>
<br/>
  Kaitlin reads a few words by sight and attempts to sound some out <br/>
but that&#39;s about it.  Her pattern with things, though, is to go from <br/>
what looks like not knowing about something to immediately doing the <br/>
thing perfectly.  Thats how she learned to ride a bike and how to tie <br/>
her shoes.  There&#39;s definitely a precedent here!  :)  I really think <br/>
she&#39;ll just start reading one of these days and amaze us.  Its just <br/>
the waiting that bugs me!  Everything else she&#39;s done, too,  has been <br/>
on the late side of normal, but that&#39;s just because she wants to be <br/>
right on the first try.<br/>
<br/>
  She actually pulled out our &quot;Teach your child to read...&quot; book a <br/>
few days ago and did really well with it on her own.  I asked her to <br/>
read some to me, though, but she doesn&#39;t want people to watch her <br/>
(unless she WANTS someone to watch her - LOL!) and she also doesn&#39;t <br/>
want anyone to make a big deal about it.  Its just how she is, and me <br/>
being nervous about it is how I am.  The best thing for me to do is <br/>
to relax.  Easier said than done sometimes, though.  Someday I&#39;ll <br/>
look back at it and laugh - at myself for over-reacting. ;)<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks for the info and support.  Djuana<br/>
