<div id="ygrps-yiv-437098076">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
The homeschooling community in our city has a registry and membership, <br/>
regardless of your style of homeschooling, that families can pay a small fee <br/>
for and then receive a membership.  In our city, this entitles you to some <br/>
discounts etc. as well as ability to borrow from the homeschool library and <br/>
also &quot;kits&quot; on various topics.  This group also has a yahoo group, and all <br/>
messages pertaining to homeschoolers are sent through e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
I am in the midst of setting up an unschooling discussion group, and have <br/>
used the local e-mail forum to find unschoolers.  Perhaps you can find <br/>
similar set-ups in cities close by, and look for unschoolers there?  Or, <br/>
start a similar group in your area for all homeschoolers, with the intent of <br/>
(eventually) finding unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
best of luck!<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you who know other unschoolers in your local area, how did <br/>
&gt; you find them?  Or if you started your own group, how did you get the word <br/>
&gt; out about your group?  The kids, and I, really want to find other <br/>
&gt; unschoolers in our area, but I just don&#39;t seem to know about how to find <br/>
&gt; them.  I would could really use any advice anyone might have.<br/>

There&#39;s my small collection of links, and as of last night the first one <br/>
there&#39;s no good. Unschooling.com&#39;s message board has been closed up.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone here has other ideas for that page, please share them here for <br/>
Brandie&#39;s sake in Kentucky, and I&#39;ll add them to that page.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Well shucks. But at least there is still www.unschooling.info/forum and<br/>
maybe that will get more traffic now. Any clue if the archives have been<br/>
preserved?<br/>

Alison Broadbent has started a group in Santa Monica, CA, beginning with a<br/>
Yahoo group, publicizing it around all the local h/s e-lists in Los Angeles,<br/>
choosing a park and taking a semi-scientific vote for which day was<br/>
preferred, deliberately avoiding those days that other nearby support groups<br/>
meet. It has been a wonderful experience to meet up on non-raining Fridays<br/>
for companionship and kids&#39; playing. It has truly become my favorite day of<br/>
the week.<br/>
