&lt;&lt; My immediate concern is the fact that I have a 10 year old who is still<br/>
 not reading.  I am hanging on by my fingernails waiting for the<br/>
 lightning bolt of compregension to hit her.  She knows &quot;how&quot; to read (ie<br/>
 she can sound out words and recognize a few on their own) but she<br/>
 steadfastly refuses to spend any time really getting comfortable with<br/>
 it.  She LOVES to be read to.  She is outrageously creative<br/>
 artistically &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it makes you feel any better, I have a child like this too.<br/>
He has been drawing very well since he was four, and has amazing talent at <br/>
age nine still.  He knows some letter sounds but just doesn&#39;t care about <br/>
sounding out words or trying to read.<br/>
That&#39;s ok. He has other talents/interests that are more important right now <br/>
and as we explore those he will find opportunities and need for reading <br/>
skills.<br/>
It&#39;s hard to swim upstream, but you aren&#39;t alone!!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

way now that I know better)  He still doesn&#39;t like to read.  That may be<br/>
partly because of the pushing, but he&#39;s also very physical, like the girl in<br/>
the original question.  I think he would have gotten it if I left him alone<br/>
about it.  Maybe a little later, but he would have gotten it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>See, that&#39;s what I love about this group....I am lazily floating downstream <br/>
and enjoying life, and it&#39;s OK!<br/>
BUT, if I floated down regular societies stream, I&#39;d be living a lie. I much <br/>
prefer to swim upstream.<br/>
Thing is, it doesn&#39;t feel like work anymore. Unschooling has brought so much <br/>
freedom and joy to each day, that it feels like a lie to say it&#39;s &quot;swimming <br/>
upstream&quot;....UNTIL I talk to average folks and then remember just how werid <br/>
we really are.<br/>
<br/>
I was observing some men removing graffiti vandalism at the park today and <br/>
lamenting that anyone would mess up the park  equipment so badly.<br/>
A mother said &quot;It&#39;s those teens&quot; as if she instantly knew only a teen would <br/>
be BAD enough to do something so mean.<br/>
I said, &quot;well, I know lots of teens that wouldn&#39;t do things like this, and my <br/>
teen wouldn&#39;t&quot; she snorts and says &quot;You HOPE&quot; as though I couldn&#39;t possibly <br/>
know that my child wouldn&#39;t do something like that.<br/>
Trevor was very annoyed as he was standing right there.<br/>
<br/>
Later we hear her yell very rudely at her child. Trevor commented that she <br/>
didn&#39;t seem to like her kids very much.<br/>
<br/>
Moments like this make me glad we aren&#39;t swimming downstream with the rest of <br/>
society...but I&#39;ll float with y&#39;all anyday!!! :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some people wrote to me off list about these. I&#39;m pretty much baffled. And<br/>
searching the internet turned up mostly people asking what was going on and<br/>
no answers. The only thing I did find out is that Lotus Domino is a web<br/>
server host so my guess is that is what Yahoo uses.<br/>
<br/>
It should be a transient thing. If it isn&#39;t, I suggest you navigate through<br/>
Yahoo help to get to the &quot;Was this enough help&quot; question which will let you<br/>
write to the help desk. You&#39;ll get back a form letter that says it&#39;s<br/>
probably a transient thing ;-) But you&#39;ll get an address to reply to if it<br/>
continues.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very good point. If we still feel like we&#39;re always swimming aginst the <br/>
current, then we&#39;re probably still focusing too much on what everyone else <br/>
is doing. We&#39;re still comparing to the school model somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Much better to look within, to look into the eyes of our beautiful children <br/>
to see what *they* need right now, in this moment.<br/>

Let the good times flow. :o)<br/>
