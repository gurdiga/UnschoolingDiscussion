<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680046531">Lucy,<br/>
I read your family&#39;s situation, I want to know what about the teacher&#39;s responsibility?� Why was it okay for the teacher to take away your nephew&#39;s lunchtime?� What was the reason for this?� What about taking the test after school, so that your nephew could have had his lunch when he was suppose to?<br/>
Just some points that may need to be approached when the judge hears his case.<br/>
Wishing your family well.<br/>
