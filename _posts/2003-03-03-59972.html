<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378879120">Hello,<br/>
About a week or so ago, mention was made of a discussion or article or <br/>
archive on unschooling.com regarding how to really be with your child.I  <br/>
could really use this right now! If anyone can help me I would really <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
I am so enjoying the discussions on this list, and feel so fired up and can <br/>
not stop checking the computer to see if there is more to read. I suspect <br/>
this is similar to how my son feels when he just HAS to play a computer game <br/>
over and over or do a puzzle over and over or he has an insatiable appetite <br/>
for one particular subject.(Not school subject!)<br/>
My brain hurts but I must have more information!! I am now reading John <br/>
Holt&#39;s How Children Fail, and my friend is going to lend me a whole box of <br/>
Growing Without Schooling issues from long ago.<br/>
Thank you all for your inspiration. Now I must get some sleep!<br/>

exact URL for it.  It was a great discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322634510">Hello Tia, I am in Prince George. There are very few of us up here doing this <br/>
unschooling way, and it is a relief to find a group of people on the internet <br/>
tolisten to and learn from.<br/>
My dad is in Saanichton and my brother lives on Shawnigan Lake, so we get to <br/>
Victoria now and then. Are there other unschoolers in your area?<br/>
Bye the way, I am jealous of your flower count, we have snow falling and <br/>
about -6C right now, to get colder this week.<br/>

know her, I can ask her if I can pass her addy on to you or vice versa.<br/>
She&#39;s pretty much an unschooler, though due to Tina being a single parent,<br/>
Kallysa has been in and out of school a bit.<br/>

we had the blizzard of 96 to cope with.  It would have been nothing to you<br/>
northerners, but it was major for us.<br/>
