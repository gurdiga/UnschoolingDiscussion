<br/>
Thank you, thank you, Mary for this link!!!!<br/>
<br/>
I just spent a few hours exploring this site, and it was the best investment<br/>
I could have made for my sanity and my family sake.  I have four young<br/>
children, and they all are quite spirited.  It is so wonderful to affirm<br/>
these positive qualities, and work with the child instead of against them.<br/>
I found a lot in this site that really spoke to me, as well, and the<br/>
frustration i suffered for years and years in public school.  I was so<br/>
burned out by school by the time I got to college that I took a year off<br/>
after my first semester.<br/>
<br/>
I am starting a spirited child study group, and this site had some excellent<br/>
book suggestions.  I am going to make a reading list now, and get a flyer<br/>
together to hand out tomorrow at the LLL meeting.  I have a group of moms<br/>
with preschoolers and young kids waiting to hear about this group.  I think<br/>
I have found a good focus for it.<br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>

you!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Five years ago, when the kids were still in school, we saw an ADD<br/>
&quot;diagnosis&quot; slapped on ds and were encouraged to medicate him.  The speed<br/>
with which all this was done by totally unqualified teachers and one<br/>
off-the-wall pediatrician horrified us.  Instead, we started hsing and have<br/>
never looked back.  BTW, he&#39;s almost thirteen now and a totally great kid,<br/>
if I do say so myself &lt;g&gt;.  Same for 13 yo dd who I&#39;m convinced would have<br/>
been targeted in the same way had we remained where we were.<br/>
<br/>
One thing though from my quick read at this site, if creativity and &quot;ADD&quot;<br/>
are linked (as I believe they may very well be), what are the consequences<br/>
of drugging a sizeable chunk of the population into conformity?  Twenty<br/>
years down the line are we going to be wondering where the artists, writers,<br/>
inventors, entrepreneurs, etc. have gone to?<br/>

  Well said, Maura.My dh and I are both artists. when he was in 1st grade, <br/>
the school called my mil to say that they were &quot;terribly sorry, but your son <br/>
has an IQ of 54&quot;  My mil agreed with his teacher that it made no sense. The <br/>
school retested him and came up with an IQ of 56!!!   <br/>
   I was told that i had a great potential that I wasn&#39;t meeting. <br/>

like a chant.  When we began homeschooling very suddenly, I did a lot of<br/>
soul-searching to try to figure out if my willingness to jump into it head<br/>
first was really meeting the kids&#39; needs or just reflective of my own<br/>
loathing of school.  Five years down the line, I still don&#39;t know the answer<br/>
to that. I&#39;m just glad it&#39;s working out so well.<br/>
<br/>
Because we&#39;ve been out of the school culture for five years, I hadn&#39;t kept<br/>
up on the increase in Ritalin, etc. use in kids.  Frankly, the situation<br/>
seemed so bad back when I was aware of it that I didn&#39;t think in terms of it<br/>
getting worse. Wrong!  A friend of mine who teaches tells me the most<br/>
bizarre thing she sees happening is kids being rushed to get on line to get<br/>
their &quot;meds&quot; so they can get back to class in time for their DARE program.<br/>
Huh???<br/>

&gt; I think all of you who are bashing parents of ADD children should<br/>
&gt; think long and hard about what  it is like for these children and<br/>
&gt; their families before placing this kind of judgement on them,<br/>
&gt; obviously you do not have  ADD children, &quot;busy &quot; children and ADD<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hello,  i&#39;m pretty new here but want to comment on your above <br/>
statement &quot;busy&quot; children and &quot;ADD&quot; children are two completely <br/>
different species.  i think that was exactly the point that some <br/>
people were trying to make in pointing out how quickly the school <br/>
systems and other professionals are eager to slap an ADD diagnosis on <br/>
a &quot;busy&quot; kid!   I agree that this happens far too often for the <br/>
convenience of the schools.  i have a busy kid and i&#39;ve already had a <br/>
taste of this recently.  We were at the park and a gal who had been <br/>
off in the distance watching my 3 yo son play with her 5 yo son came <br/>
over and struck up a conversation with me.  they were having fun and <br/>
getting along but she had been closely watching his behavior - or <br/>
should i say &quot;energy level&quot;.  turns out she works at the &quot;Head Start&quot; <br/>
school and was suggesting that i should look into getting Sterling <br/>
enrolled.  we were on the subject of how advanced he is and she <br/>
proceeded to tell me about how they have &quot;free testing&quot; 3 times a year so <br/>
you can find out where your child is at even if you don&#39;t plan on <br/>
enrolling them into the school.  i took it as being more of <br/>
a skills and academic test combined with developmental skills so that <br/>
they know how to place them with other kids of the same level.  well, <br/>
just for kicks, i decided to look into it further for the testing <br/>
even though i had no plans to enroll him.  funny...  they test in <br/>
November?  h-m-m-m.  so what is covered in this testing i ask!  and i <br/>
quote &quot;Oh, we are looking for any deficits or learning disorders the <br/>
child might have!&quot;  URGH!!!!  so this &quot;teacher&quot; who is not qualified <br/>
to make this sort of diagnosis had concluded in 15 minutes of <br/>
watching Sterling on the playground that he needed to be tested for a <br/>
learning disorder??  she obviously concluded ADD just because of his <br/>
spontanity and energy level!  NO THANK YOU!  <br/>
<br/>
i hope this helps with the other side of the picture and why some of <br/>
us go bonkers over the idea of &quot;busy kids&quot; being diagnosed as ADD and <br/>
being drugged into submission for the convenience of the schools.  <br/>
and yes i do agree that some kids truly are ADD and can benefit <br/>
greatly from the proper treatment whether it be Ritalin or some other <br/>
alternative method that works and that is appropriate for the degree of <br/>
the ADD.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d love to respond to more of your message but it is LATE and i need <br/>
some sleep.<br/>

while also trying to convince them not to turn to (illegal) drugs as a<br/>
solution to life&#39;s problems.  and BTW, Ritalin is only one of the drugs<br/>
being given and ADHD/ADD is only one of the reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad Ritalin works for your daughter and I&#39;m sure there are others for<br/>
whom it&#39;s equally helpful. But I remain convinced that it and other drugs<br/>
are being prescribed for many children far too often and without proper<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928250254">Tanya, <br/>
    I can see how the comments could be seen as bashing people who put their <br/>
children on medication. I truly believe that some children are severe enough <br/>
that the meds are beneficial. I feel the point that was being made is that a <br/>
lot of those people who do put their child on meds when it is not necessary. <br/>
With that course of action being so widely accepted, it&#39;s not bad to talk <br/>
about alternatives, but you are correct in saying that we should be more <br/>
sensitive in how we say it. I am sorry you were hurt. Please accept my <br/>
apology. Only you truly know your daughter and what she NEEDS. <br/>

THE MISDIAGNOSIS OF ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER<br/>
By Samuel Joehl<br/>
Psychology 105<br/>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ? it&#39;s the &quot;virus of the 90&#39;s,&quot;<br/>
afflicting some four-and-a-half million children in the U.S. alone<br/>
(Baughman 1997). With the numbers of afflicted children escalating at<br/>
epidemic proportions each year, just like the pre-Salc era there is<br/>
reason to believe that parents must fear for their children contracting<br/>
this disease. The U.S. National Institute of Mental Health predicts that<br/>
by the year 2000 ten million children will be consuming psychiatric<br/>
drugs for the treatment of this disorder (Nun 1998). Identified by the<br/>
main characteristics of inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity, it<br/>
ruins the lives of many, tearing families and schools apart. But<br/>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is not a real disease.<br/>
There is no scientific evidence to identify its existence, nor are there<br/>
scientific means available for its identification, detection and<br/>
treatment. Rather ADHD is an invention designed solely for the financial<br/>
benefit of psychiatrists, drug manufacturers and schools who capitalize<br/>
on the misfortune of others. Worst of all, treatment of this fake<br/>
disorder usually involves the prescription of powerful, addictive<br/>
stimulants such as amphetamines to young children, adolescents and<br/>
adults. The adverse effects from these drugs can be unbearable,<br/>
debilitating and even potentially fatal. Using propaganda and coercion,<br/>
psychiatrists and psychologists have duped well-meaning parents,<br/>
teachers and politicians who are unaware of the truth of the ADHD scam.<br/>
Psychiatry is creating a dangerous situation that will affect the<br/>
totality of society.<br/>
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a set of behaviors<br/>
which have been classified as a disease by the American Psychiatric<br/>
Association. The official standard for ADHD requires any combination of<br/>
eight out of fourteen symptoms, the first five being the most useful or<br/>
discriminating (Breggin 1994, Wiseman 1995). They include:<br/>
1. often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat. In adolescents<br/>
this may be limited to subjected feelings of restlessness.<br/>
2. Has difficulty remaining seated when required to do so.<br/>
3. Is easily distracted by extraneous stimuli.<br/>
4. Has difficulty awaiting turn in games or group situations.<br/>
5. Often blurts out answers to questions before they have been<br/>
completed.<br/>
6. Often does not seem to listen when spoken to directly.<br/>
7. Often has difficulty organizing tasks and activities.<br/>
8. Often loses things necessary to tasks or activities.<br/>
9. Is often forgetful in daily activities.<br/>
10. Is often on the go or often acts as if driven by a motor.<br/>
11. Often talks excessively.<br/>
12. Often has difficulty following instructions.<br/>
13. Often has difficulty playing quietly.<br/>
14. Often interrupts others.<br/>
While many may be amused by the above catalog of common childhood<br/>
behaviors, these have been defined by the American Psychiatric<br/>
Association in their Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental<br/>
Disorders as legitimate symptoms of a physical disease. This disease is<br/>
diagnosed by observing the behavior of children and adolescents and<br/>
choosing any combination of eight of the above symptoms which are being<br/>
manifested. ADHD is commonly diagnosed by elementary school teachers who<br/>
use a behavior check list to identify a biologic defect in the brain<br/>
(Baughman 1996). It is also measured by giving a child a series of tests<br/>
that are completed on a piece of paper, or by testing the child&#39;s<br/>
ability to perform tasks and follow directions. Dr. Fred Baughman is a<br/>
35-year pediatric neurologist and a fellow of the American Academy of<br/>
Neurology. In response to these various methods of diagnosis of ADHD he<br/>
states: &quot;For all their talk of chemical imbalance in the brain,<br/>
psychiatrists order no blood, urine or spinal fluid tests and do no<br/>
brain scans of the sort that their researchers claim validate disorders<br/>
or diseases.&quot;<br/>
Contrary to Baughman&#39;s opinion, many<br/>
psychiatrists and psychologists will assert that ADHD has biochemical or<br/>
neurologic etiologies. These doctors will claim that scientific studies<br/>
exist that give reason to believe that some abnormal defect may exist.<br/>
To these experts Dr. T. P. Nun, M.D., Th.D. responds &quot;To this day there<br/>
is not one study done by anyone that proves that hyperactivity is caused<br/>
by brain damage or a chemical imbalance.&quot; Dr. Theodore J. La Vaque,<br/>
Ph.D. concurs by asserting that &quot;to date, there is no substantive<br/>
medical evidence supporting the &#39;brain disorder&#39; hypothesis.&quot; Even the<br/>
American Psychiatric Association admitted in its Diagnostic and<br/>
Statistical manual of Mental Disorders that there are &quot;no laboratory<br/>
findings that have been established as diagnostic&quot; for Attention Deficit<br/>
Hyperactivity Disorder. Dr. Baughman commented: &quot;Confronted with<br/>
children whom psychologists, psychiatrists and teachers claimed had<br/>
ADHD, I have not been able to find any physical abnormality, no disease<br/>
whatsoever.&quot; According to Paul Leber, M.D. of the U.S. Food and Drug<br/>
Administration, &quot;As of yet no distinctive pathophysiology for the<br/>
disorder has been delineated.&quot; &quot;We are also unaware,&quot; notes Gene Haislip<br/>
of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, &quot;that ADHD has been validated as a<br/>
biologic organic syndrome or disease.&quot; Dr. Lawrence Diller, M.D. was a<br/>
conferee at the 1996 DEA conference on stimulant use in the treatment of<br/>
ADHD. In a letter to Dr. Baughman, he wrote: &quot;The reason why you have<br/>
been unable to obtain any articles or studies presenting clear and<br/>
confirming evidence of a physical or chemical abnormality associated<br/>
with ADHD is that there is none.&quot; And yet despite the overwhelming<br/>
evidence that ADHD has yet to be proven as having any physical etiology,<br/>
many biopsychiatrists still assert that it does. Their beliefs are<br/>
founded on the idea proposed in 1865 by Zurich psychiatrist Wilhelm<br/>
Griesinger who claimed that since the majority of nerve coverage was in<br/>
the brain, all mental problems must be brain diseases. Conduct,<br/>
therefore, though viewed for centuries to be an independent function<br/>
from the body was now declared to be symptoms of an illness. Unverified<br/>
even today by the scientific method, these suppositions form the<br/>
underpinning for most psychiatric practice and theory (Wiseman 1995).<br/>
Amil Kraepelin was one of the first psychologists to work on a system<br/>
for codifying human behavior while simultaneously acknowledging that<br/>
psychiatry had no effective treatments or cures for most psychiatric<br/>
disorders. In 1932, Frankwood E. Williams, director of the U.S. National<br/>
Committee for Mental Hygiene confessed: &quot;The basic question with which<br/>
psychiatrists and particularly those interested in mental hygiene start<br/>
is what are the causes of mental and nervous disease. This question has<br/>
been repeatedly raised during the 22 years of organized mental hygiene<br/>
until it almost becomes a ritual, and like a ritual has led to nothing<br/>
but repetition, not even a start.&quot; Dr. Rex William Cowdry, director of<br/>
the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health in 1995 testified before a<br/>
Congressional committee: &quot;We don&#39;t know the causes � we don&#39;t have the<br/>
methods of curing these illnesses yet.&quot; And yet despite &quot;not knowing the<br/>
causes,&quot; psychiatrists continue to prescribe drugs for abnormal conduct<br/>
which they haven&#39;t even identified as having any physical connection.<br/>
The basis for their prescription is the much touted neurobiologic<br/>
disorder theory, which claims that abnormal behavior, emotions and<br/>
thoughts are due to chemical imbalances in the brain, usually improper<br/>
neurotransmitter levels. On this theory psychiatrist David Kaiser<br/>
comments: &quot;Modern psychiatry has yet to convincingly prove the genetic<br/>
and biologic cause of any single mental illness. Patients have been<br/>
diagnosed with chemical imbalances despite the fact that no test exists<br/>
to support such a claim, and there is no real conception of what a<br/>
correct chemical balance would look like.&quot; New York psychiatrist Ron<br/>
Leifer states his view quite clearly: &quot;There is no biological imbalance.<br/>
When people come to me and say they have a biochemical imbalance, I say,<br/>
&#39;Show me your lab tests.&#39; There are no lab tests, so what&#39;s the chemical<br/>
imbalance?&quot; &quot;What they have done is medicalize many problems which don&#39;t<br/>
have demonstrable biologic causes,&quot; explains one California<br/>
psychiatrist.<br/>
Despite the overwhelming lack of evidence to support the biochemical<br/>
theories, those diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder<br/>
are usually given drugs to treat their behavior problems. The drugs<br/>
given are usually stimulants in the same classification of amphetamines<br/>
like speed and cocaine. The most common drugs prescribed for ADHD are<br/>
Ritalin, Dexedrine and the central nervous system stimulant Cylert. The<br/>
psychiatrists prescribing these drugs to their patients and the<br/>
manufacturers of these drugs insist that they are &quot;safe,&quot; however<br/>
substantial evidence has suggested that the adverse reactions to these<br/>
drugs are probably far more common than the literature suggests. Except<br/>
when a drug is brand new, physicians usually don&#39;t report or publish<br/>
their negative side effects, and many are unaware that there is a<br/>
mechanism of informing the drug manufacturers and the FDA of these<br/>
effects (Breggin 1994). In addition, advocates of the psychiatric<br/>
drugging of children have proven themselves to be especially unwilling<br/>
to examine or underscore their effects. Ritalin is the most<br/>
commonly-prescribed drug for someone with ADHD. Ritalin is<br/>
pharmacologically classified with amphetamines. It has the same effects,<br/>
side effects and risks. Scientists report that Ritalin affects the brain<br/>
exactly like Cocaine does. The APA&#39;s 1989 Tome Treatment of Psychiatric<br/>
Disorders observes that cocaine, amphetamines and methyl phenidate<br/>
(Ritalin) are neuropharmacologically alike, citing evidence of similar<br/>
abuse patterns. The clinical effects between Ritalin and cocaine cannot<br/>
be differentiated in laboratory tests, and they can substitute for each<br/>
other and cause similar behaviors in addicted animals. The DSM III-R<br/>
lumps Ritalin, cocaine and amphetamine abuse into the same category. The<br/>
U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency classifies Ritalin into the same addiction<br/>
category, Schedule II, as other amphetamines, cocaine, morphine, opium<br/>
and barbiturates. A California study of adolescents diagnosed with ADHD<br/>
found that those who had been treated with Ritalin were three times more<br/>
likely to use cocaine as adults. Even Ciba-Geigy Pharmaceutical Company,<br/>
manufacturer of Ritalin admitted that their drug was a &quot;drug of<br/>
dependency.&quot; In 1985 they published the following warning: Drug<br/>
Dependence: Ritalin should be given cautiously to emotionally unstable<br/>
patients such as those with a history of drug dependence or alcoholism<br/>
because such patients may increase dosage on their own initiative.<br/>
Chronically abusive use can lead to marked tolerance and psychic<br/>
dependence with varying degrees of abnormal behavior. Frank psychotic<br/>
episodes can occur especially with parental abuse. Careful supervision<br/>
is required during drug withdrawal since severe depression as well as<br/>
the effects of chronic overactivity can be unmasked. In the 1980s<br/>
Ritalin was a very popular street drug before being replaced by other<br/>
stimulants. Today Ritalin is used illegally in combination with other<br/>
drugs by drug addicts. In 1986 the International Journal of The<br/>
Addictions published over 105 adverse reactions from the drug. These<br/>
include nervousness and insomnia, hypertensivity (high blood pressure),<br/>
anorexia, nausea, dizziness, headaches, drowsiness, blood pressure and<br/>
pulse changes, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), angina (sudden pain),<br/>
abdominal pain, loss of appetite, weight loss and toxic psychosis. Some<br/>
children can develop involuntary ticks and twitching from using the<br/>
drug, known as Touret&#39;s syndrome. The number of emergency room cases<br/>
related to methyl phenidate for children ages 10-14 in the United States<br/>
increased ten times since 1990 and surpassed the level of<br/>
cocaine-related emergencies for the same age group in 1950. More harmful<br/>
than the side effects, however, are the withdrawal effects from missing<br/>
even one dosage. Like any other stimulant, these effects include<br/>
crashing with depression, exhaustion, irritability and suicidal<br/>
feelings. Even the American Psychiatric Association admitted in 1987<br/>
that &quot;suicide is the major complication of withdrawal from Ritalin and<br/>
similar drugs.&quot; (DSM III-R). Many parents are not informed that as a<br/>
stimulant, Ritalin causes the very behaviors it is supposed to cure,<br/>
such as inattention, hyperactivity and aggression. When this occurs the<br/>
child is often given a higher dosage or an even stronger agent such as a<br/>
neuroleptic, resulting in a vicious circle of increased drug toxicity.<br/>
Ritalin can also suppress growth, height and weight. These facts are<br/>
often explained to parents in a way so as not to frighten them. What<br/>
parents often are not told, however, is that it can also cause permanent<br/>
brain damage from long-term exposure. Cylert and Dexedrine both share<br/>
many of the common adverse effects of other stimulants. In addition,<br/>
Cylert can also cause liver toxicity. A 1997 &quot;Dear Doctor&quot; letter cited<br/>
ten reports over 21 years of acute liver failure in children taking the<br/>
drug.<br/>
ADHD --is not based on scientific proof or evidence, but rather opinion<br/>
of behavior. In countries where drugs are rarely given to children such<br/>
as Denmark, Norway and Sweden, ADHD is rarely diagnosed. Doctors working<br/>
for Britain&#39;s National Health Service are prohibited from prescribing<br/>
Ritalin in routine practice because it is not on the approved drug list<br/>
of the British National Formulary. In 1995 the International Narcotics<br/>
and Control Board reported an increase in worldwide production of methyl<br/>
phenidate from 3.0 tons in 1990 to 8.5 tons in 1994, with the United<br/>
States accounting for 90 percent of the consumption and a small<br/>
percentage of doctors accounting for the majority of prescriptions. In<br/>
addition to ADHD having a cultural bias, males are far more frequently<br/>
given a Disruptive Behavior Disorder i.e. ADHD classification. This is<br/>
because male children are trained by society to act resentfully or<br/>
rebelliously towards female authority. In fact, most adult men resent<br/>
being told what to do by women. Girls are conditioned by society to<br/>
listen attentively to whatever authority says, and what any male says.<br/>
There is no &quot;compulsive obedience disorder&quot; for girls because labeling a<br/>
child with a DBD is an instrument of control. Even researchers at the<br/>
NIMH confirm that short-term effects of Ritalin are limited to<br/>
&quot;behavioral control.&quot; As girls receive increasingly confusing messages<br/>
from modern society about assertiveness, more and more young girls are<br/>
being diagnosed with DBDs. Often these girls share potential leadership<br/>
qualities (Breggin and Breggin, 1984). As it&#39;s name implies, Attention<br/>
Deficit Disorder is a disease who&#39;s symptoms go away when children are<br/>
given a minimal amount of attention or when children have something<br/>
interesting to do. This is agreed upon by all observers (Breggin 1984)<br/>
and even finds its way into the DSM III-R, which specifies that the<br/>
symptoms may not be apparent while a child is playing a video game, in a<br/>
novel setting or being examined by a doctor. And yet despite the<br/>
disappearance of symptomatology during examination, psychiatrists still<br/>
claim they have scientific validity for ADHD. ADHD did not come into<br/>
existence by scientific means, and it does not serve any medical purpose<br/>
for the patient. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder was literally<br/>
voted into existence in 1987 by a committee of the American Psychiatric<br/>
Association. Thus by a show of hands, a new disease had entered as a<br/>
medically-valid disorder into the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of<br/>
Mental Disorders. Understanding the purpose that inventing a disease<br/>
serves can be determined by examining the results that it created. In<br/>
1952 the first DSM was published by the APA, listing 112 maladies. The<br/>
1994 edition lists more than 370 different mental disorders. A new<br/>
category was created for the DSM II, published in 1968, entitled<br/>
&quot;Behavior Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence.&quot; In 1975 the<br/>
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act was passed, providing<br/>
special education classes and state and federal funding for students<br/>
with &quot;learning disabilities.&quot; There were only 782,000 children with<br/>
learning disabilities in 1977. In 1989 there were 1.9 million children<br/>
diagnosed with learning disorders, and in 1996 there were 2.6 million<br/>
with this affliction. And were these diagnoses scientific? According to<br/>
Kevin P. Dwyer, assistant director of the National Association of School<br/>
Psychologists in the U.S., the diagnosis of learning disorders is &quot;not a<br/>
science.&quot; He added, &quot;we&#39;re not sophisticated enough to do a perfect<br/>
diagnosis.&quot; After the invention of ADHD in 1987, there were 500,000<br/>
children already diagnosed with it a year later. In 1990 federal<br/>
legislation created welfare programs for low-income parents to receive<br/>
$450 per month for each child diagnosed with ADHD. Parents would<br/>
intentionally coach their children to behave in a manner to receive the<br/>
diagnosis. In 1991 federal education grants gave $400 a year to schools<br/>
for each child with an ADHD diagnosis. The U.S. Department of Education<br/>
recognized ADHD to be a handicap and directed all state education<br/>
officers to establish procedures to identify and screen children with<br/>
ADHD and to give them educational and psychological services. According<br/>
to Baughman, the frequency with which ADHD and LD are diagnosed in<br/>
schools is &quot;proportional to the presence and influence within the<br/>
schools of mind-brain behavioral diagnosticians, testers and<br/>
therapists.&quot; Schools today in the U.S. spend more than one billion<br/>
dollars a year combined on psychologists and psychiatrists working<br/>
full-time to diagnose students. In 1996 15 billion dollars was spent on<br/>
the diagnosis, treatment and study of these learning disorders. In 1998<br/>
British Columbia Health Minister Ms. Penny Priddi, asked the college of<br/>
physicians and surgeons to find out why the number of children diagnosed<br/>
with ADHD had tripled since 1992. &quot;I&#39;m trying to picture what I would do<br/>
if the school said about this child that I adore, &#39;either you put him on<br/>
this drug or he can&#39;t come back.&#39; It feels a bit like blackmail,&quot; she<br/>
said. Penny was referring to schools forcing children to take Ritalin at<br/>
the risk of expulsion. This problem was not limited to Canada. In 1991 a<br/>
U.S. District Court ruled that state and local educational officials<br/>
violated a student&#39;s rights by insisting he take Ritalin to attend<br/>
mainstream classes. In his book Prescription for Disaster, Thomas Moore<br/>
said that Ritalin is given &quot;for short-term control of human behavior,<br/>
not to reduce any identifiable hazards to children&#39;s health. Such<br/>
long-scale chemical control of human behavior has not previously been<br/>
undertaken in our society outside of nursing homes and mental<br/>
institutions.&quot; Schools and psychiatrists are obviously placing these<br/>
children on the drugs for their own financial incentive. If the<br/>
stimulants truly were beneficial to the child, then school performance<br/>
would improve. This is not the case. At least five different scientific<br/>
studies indicate that no improvement in academic learning occurs from<br/>
these drugs, and stimulants can actually impair cognitive processes and<br/>
academic competence, making a child more docile and compliant (Wiseman<br/>
1995). Canadian psychologist Tana Dineen says in her book Manufacturing<br/>
Victims that &quot;psychology is neither a science nor a profession, but an<br/>
industry that turns healthy people into victims to give itself a<br/>
constant source of income.&quot; Professors Herb Kutchins and Stuart A. Kirk<br/>
of Scientific American describe the DSM as &quot;primarily about being a<br/>
guide to filling out insurance forms.&quot; Jeffry A. Schaler, adjunct<br/>
professor from Philadelphia also warns legislators and the general<br/>
public to &quot;not be hoodwinked&quot; by psychiatry&#39;s labels and diagnoses.<br/>
Despite the lack of proof that ADHD exists as a legitimate medical<br/>
disease with a characteristic pattern of recurring symptoms that can be<br/>
identified, measured and treated, numerous literature exists to support<br/>
its advocates and their claims. Much of this literature originates from<br/>
an organization called CHADD, Children and Adults with Attention Deficit<br/>
Disorder, a group of parents who have kids with ADD and ADHD. CHADD&#39;s<br/>
official policy views children with ADD as suffering from genetic and<br/>
biological problems. According to CHADD president Sandra F. Thomas, &quot;Our<br/>
kids have a neurological impairment that is pervasive and affects every<br/>
area of their life, day and night.&quot; CHADD believes that emotional upset<br/>
and anger at children with ADHD is in no way caused by families, parents<br/>
or schools, but is entirely the fault of the child. This was illustrated<br/>
by a brochure which stated that &quot;Frustrated, upset and anxious parents<br/>
do not cause children to have ADD, on the contrary, ADD children usually<br/>
cause their parents to be frustrated, upset and anxious.&quot; The reason for<br/>
CHADD&#39;s decision to blame the victim rather than the culprit in the<br/>
typical psychiatrist&#39;s fashion became clear when it was discovered that<br/>
CHADD has joined forces with biologically-oriented psychiatrists, many<br/>
of whom sit on the advisory board. The most devastating enditement to<br/>
CHADD, however, is the receipt of large contributions to enable<br/>
high-pressure lobbying, media campaigns and up-scale national<br/>
conventions from Ciba-Geigy, leading manufacturer for the leading ADD<br/>
drug, Ritalin.<br/>
If there is no biologic basis for ADHD, then something else must be<br/>
creating the symptoms. There must be an even darker force at work than<br/>
genetic make-up or chemicals or physical defects to explain the increase<br/>
in inattentive, impulsive and hyperactive behavior. That darker force is<br/>
a psychologically-based educational system, collectively known as<br/>
outcome-based education. Advocated in the United States by psychologist<br/>
Dr. William Coulson and implemented throughout the world, outcome-based<br/>
education consists of programs that have replaced standard academic<br/>
curricula. These include whole language (invented by psychologist James<br/>
Cattell) to replace phonics-based reading, new math, invented spelling<br/>
and values clarification classes. The purpose of these programs along<br/>
with the goals of world psychiatry were expressed by Dr. G. Brock<br/>
Chisholm, Co-founder for the World Federation of Mental Health in 1945:<br/>
&quot;The re-interpretation and eventually irradication of the concept of<br/>
right and wrong which has been the basis of child training, the<br/>
substitution of intelligence and rational thinking for faith, are the<br/>
belated objectives of practically all psychotherapy. With the other<br/>
human sciences, psychiatry must now decide what is to be the immediate<br/>
future of the human race. No one else can.&quot; In outcome-based education,<br/>
the focus rests on trying to bring about certain outcomes from the child<br/>
by modifying his behavior and altering his beliefs. This is very similar<br/>
to the materialistic stimulus-response philosophies on which psychiatry<br/>
was founded. Author William Kilpatrick explains that &quot;feelings, personal<br/>
growth and a total nonjudgmental attitude&quot; are emphasized and &quot;no time<br/>
is spent providing moral guidance or forming character. The virtues are<br/>
not explained or discussed, nor models of good behavior are provided. No<br/>
reason is given why a boy or girl should want to be good in the first<br/>
place. They come away with the impression that even the most basic<br/>
values are matters of dispute.&quot; As a result of OBE being firmly in place<br/>
by 1987 in the state of Arkansas by Governor Bill Clinton, homicide<br/>
rates by 14-17-year-olds increased by 435 percent, surpassing the number<br/>
for the same age group in the entire country by 1990. Between 1989 and<br/>
1995, arrests of minors in Arkansas increased by 180 percent. The<br/>
authors of the text for values clarification state: &quot;It is entirely<br/>
possible that children will choose not to develop values. It is the<br/>
teacher&#39;s responsibility to support this choice also.&quot; As Chisholm<br/>
stated, values clarification has the objective of clarifying and<br/>
redefining the meanings of right and wrong so that there are no<br/>
objective moral values, only personal opinion. Another aspect of<br/>
outcome-based education is the whole language method developed by<br/>
psychologist James Cattell. Whole language replaces phonics-based<br/>
methods by forcing the child to learn words by memorizing the<br/>
arrangement of the letters rather than learning their correlation or<br/>
significance. The state of California replaced their phonics-based<br/>
programs with whole language in 1987. As a result, in 1992 California<br/>
fourth graders tied for last place on the National Assessment of<br/>
Education Program tests, and in 1994 California came in last place, with<br/>
86% scoring below proficient levels (Baughman 1996). Dr. Baughman has<br/>
noted a correlation between learning disabilities and illiteracy, noting<br/>
no physical abnormality and noting that competency improves with<br/>
phonics-based training. Many other parents who have put their child<br/>
through phonics-based programs because the child was unable to read<br/>
after having gone through school have also noted significant<br/>
improvements in school performance. President Bill Clinton has enacted<br/>
legislation granting federal funds to state and local schools for<br/>
implementation of outcome-based education programs in the entire<br/>
country. The &quot;Goals 2000&quot; program was designed to further advance the<br/>
influence of psychiatry in society, requiring all schools to implement<br/>
OBE programs in order to receive federal grants. The program also<br/>
establishes the creation of mini-psychiatric clinics in every public<br/>
school in the nation by the year 2000. Acting legislation at that time<br/>
will allow a psychiatrist to place any child in the school on<br/>
psychiatric drugs without parental consent. Author Beverly Eakman<br/>
describes the educational situation today as follows: &quot;Most people today<br/>
suspect that education is not really about literacy basics or<br/>
proficiency in anything. What is less well-understood is that there<br/>
exists in this country and indeed throughout the industrialized world<br/>
what can best be described as an illiteracy cartel, ostensibly aimed at<br/>
furthering mental power. This cartel derives its power from those who<br/>
stand to benefit financially and politically from ignorance and<br/>
educational malpractice, from the frustration, the crime, the<br/>
joblessness and social chaos that miseducation produces.&quot; ADHD ? a<br/>
complete contrivance of the APA with no scientific validity. While<br/>
psychiatrists will argue that there is scientific evidence or that there<br/>
are scientific studies that support the existence or validity of ADHD,<br/>
the dictionary defines scientific as &quot;systematic, accurate, exact.&quot;<br/>
These words have nothing to do with the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD,<br/>
or with psychiatry, for that matter. There is not one laboratory test or<br/>
clinical finding that has been established as diagnostic for<br/>
identification and treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity<br/>
Disorder. This contrivance invented by the American Psychiatric<br/>
Association purely has the motives of capitalizing off of the sale of<br/>
powerful, addictive and potentially dangerous psychotropic drugs. And as<br/>
further demonstrated, the psychiatrist is also involved in the creation<br/>
of many of the symptoms of ADHD by pushing his drugs into society and<br/>
implementing his behavior-altering, nonacademic education programs.<br/>
According to psychiatrist Thomas Szasz, &quot;Thrusting fake intimacy and<br/>
pretended care on them (children) as professional child-enslavers do is<br/>
our distinctively modern method of harming children in the name of<br/>
helping them. The child psychiatrist&#39;s authority is altogether beyond<br/>
the reach of his denominated patients. This elementary fact makes the<br/>
child psychiatrist one of the most dangerous enemies, not only of<br/>
children but also of adults who care for the two most precious and<br/>
vulnerable things in life, children and liberty. Child psychology and<br/>
child psychiatry cannot be reformed; they must be abolished.&quot; And who<br/>
are these &quot;experts&quot; who pontificate on TV about behavior, the mind and<br/>
the various social problems of the day, advising millions? Psychiatrists<br/>
are criminally charged disproportionately more than any other section of<br/>
the health care industry. At least ten percent of psychiatrists,<br/>
psychologists and psychotherapists admit to sexually abusing their<br/>
patients, according to one of their own studies. Psychiatrists top the<br/>
list of medical doctors least likely to sustain a successful marriage,<br/>
and the suicide rate for psychiatrists is twice that of other<br/>
physicians. Psychology Today reported that psychologists and other<br/>
mental health professionals are more insane than the rest of the<br/>
population. Dr. Michael Chavin, M.D. does offer us some words of<br/>
encouragement, however: &quot;I thought I had seen psychiatry at its worst<br/>
with its fixation on barbaric practices such as electroshock treatment.<br/>
I was wrong. Nothing compares to the viciously covert mental and<br/>
physical abuse that is dealt innocent children through psychiatric<br/>
drugging and psychology-based curricula today. Parents have the right,<br/>
the responsibility and all the power they need to reverse this hideous<br/>
situation, and they must, for who else can our children turn to?&quot; It<br/>
becomes clear, then, that it is up to the parents and those who care<br/>
about children to insure that they receive sound educational and medical<br/>
attention. It becomes clear that a child manifesting behavioral problems<br/>
should receive quality treatment that does not involve treating an<br/>
abnormality in the brain that has never been discovered or can never be<br/>
tested for. The 1986 book Ill, Not Insane lists 140 medical problems<br/>
that can cause mental and emotional trouble including suboptimum<br/>
nutrition, exposure to antinutrients, overuse of sugar, stimulants and<br/>
depressants and food allergies or intolerances. It becomes clear that<br/>
other factors must be examined to determine the true cause of the<br/>
behavior. The educational curriculum must be examined to insure it is<br/>
academically-centered. Finding the real cause of a child&#39;s inattention,<br/>
impulsivity and hyperactivity and addressing that cause will lead to a<br/>
child that pays attention, behaves and does well in school because he<br/>
wants to, not because a drug forces him to do so. End Notes for &quot;The<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think all of you who are bashing parents of ADD children should<br/>
&gt; think long and hard about what  it is like for these children and<br/>
&gt; their families before placing this kind of judgement on them,<br/>
&gt; obviously you do not have  ADD children, &quot;busy &quot; children and ADD<br/>
&gt; children are two completely different species!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>  Hello,  i&#39;m pretty new here but want to comment on your above<br/>
statement &quot;busy&quot; children and &quot;ADD&quot; children are two completely<br/>
different species.  i think that was exactly the point that some<br/>
people were trying to make in pointing out how quickly the school<br/>
systems and other professionals are eager to slap an ADD diagnosis on<br/>
a &quot;busy&quot; kid!   I agree that this happens far too often for the<br/>
convenience of the schools.  i have a busy kid and i&#39;ve already had a<br/>
taste of this recently.  We were at the park and a gal who had been<br/>
off in the distance watching my 3 yo son play with her 5 yo son came<br/>
over and struck up a conversation with me.  they were having fun and<br/>
getting along but she had been closely watching his behavior - or<br/>
should i say &quot;energy level&quot;.  turns out she works at the &quot;Head Start&quot;<br/>
school and was suggesting that i should look into getting Sterling<br/>
enrolled.  we were on the subject of how advanced he is and she<br/>
proceeded to tell me about how they have &quot;free testing&quot; 3 times a year so<br/>
you can find out where your child is at even if you don&#39;t plan on<br/>
enrolling them into the school.  i took it as being more of<br/>
a skills and academic test combined with developmental skills so that<br/>
they know how to place them with other kids of the same level.  well,<br/>
just for kicks, i decided to look into it further for the testing<br/>
even though i had no plans to enroll him.  funny...  they test in<br/>
November?  h-m-m-m.  so what is covered in this testing i ask!  and i<br/>
quote &quot;Oh, we are looking for any deficits or learning disorders the<br/>
child might have!&quot;  URGH!!!!  so this &quot;teacher&quot; who is not qualified<br/>
to make this sort of diagnosis had concluded in 15 minutes of<br/>
watching Sterling on the playground that he needed to be tested for a<br/>
learning disorder??  she obviously concluded ADD just because of his<br/>
spontanity and energy level!  NO THANK YOU!<br/>
<br/>
i hope this helps with the other side of the picture and why some of<br/>
us go bonkers over the idea of &quot;busy kids&quot; being diagnosed as ADD and<br/>
being drugged into submission for the convenience of the schools.<br/>
and yes i do agree that some kids truly are ADD and can benefit<br/>
greatly from the proper treatment whether it be Ritalin or some other<br/>
alternative method that works and that is appropriate for the degree of<br/>
the ADD.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d love to respond to more of your message but it is LATE and i need<br/>
some sleep.<br/>

I seem to have missed a great deal of this debate, I think I am glad that I <br/>
did.  Having read your post just now, it just emphasizes the need for people <br/>
to know what they are talking about before they sound off on ANY subject.   <br/>
Superiority is a killer to any caring and loving group, no matter what the  <br/>
subject.  I am so sorry that your child has to go through this, that any <br/>
child does for that matter.  In all fairness to others, I think that the <br/>
reason so many people get so upset about these meds, is because so many <br/>
Doctors and school systems have mis handled these terms and meds, to make it <br/>
a convenience.  We all know someone who has a perfectly normal child that <br/>
their parents really don&#39;t want to bother with, and they push for the meds.  <br/>
This is most likely what everyone has been talking about, but, again, we <br/>
should never make blanket statements about anyone or any group. Everybody <br/>
laughs and groans and jokes about preteens, how they have smart attitudes, <br/>
mouhts and mood swings.  But we know it is because hormones are going wild in <br/>
their body, heck, their body is going weird on them, and they don&#39;t <br/>
understand what is happening, why they smart off and can&#39;t stop.  We know <br/>
that will change as they grow, we won&#39;t have to deal with that for a long <br/>
time, but you parents, I don&#39;t know if I could have the patience to deal with <br/>
what you have to go through all the time.  I wish you so much luck and love <br/>
and happiness.<br/>

I find the section i quoted below of all the traits especially<br/>

the fact that his behavior mimics ADD on the surface and would be a<br/>
perfect candidate for misdiagnosis.  I&#39;ve never seen &quot;the list&quot; that<br/>
is used before.  it is incredible that a child only has to fit into<br/>
eight out of the fourteen!  if this is the case, then what on earth<br/>
is a child that fits all 14 and not &quot;often&quot; but &quot;constant&quot;? a<br/>
lunatic? Sterling IS all fourteen but for each one, i can site the<br/>
source and cause of the behavior and in most cases can provide a few<br/>
methods of approach to apply to either minimize the intensity of that<br/>
behavior or avoid it entirely - a proactive approach to getting the<br/>
preferred results and responses.  Some i wouldn&#39;t want to elimate or <br/>
tone down. 11. talks excessively.  He never stops talking.  Begin <br/>
talking very early.  Has an amazing vocabulary for his age.  Uses <br/>
words that most don&#39;t comprehend their usage until around age 5-6 <br/>
(actually, probably, perfect, etc). The way i see it, all this <br/>
non-stop talking is just an art of practicing a wonderful skill.  He <br/>
even talks in his sleep lots of times! Sterling is &quot;spirited&quot; (and<br/>
possibly gifted - i&#39;m not sure)<br/>
<br/>
   If i had to rate which ones were the strongest and weakest, i <br/>
honestly couldn&#39;t do it.  ALL of them are equally intense and <br/>
constant except maybe 8. and 9.  i had to smile at number 10.  I&#39;ve <br/>
actually had people ask me where his &quot;off switch&quot; is.  I boldly <br/>
respond &quot;he doesn&#39;t have one&quot; and make sure i beam with proudness <br/>
when i say it.  <br/>

eight out of the fourteen!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worse than you know.  Take a look at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.chadd.org/facts/add_facts01.htm#Definition">http://www.chadd.org/facts/add_facts01.htm#Definition</a> and you&#39;ll see there<br/>
are actually four types of ADD defined, each with its own list.<br/>
<br/>
Are you &quot;easily distracted&quot;? Do you make &quot;careless mistakes&quot;? Appear not to<br/>
listen?  Lose something you need to complete a task?  You&#39;re well on your<br/>
way to an ADD/inattentive diagnosis.<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps you fidget, like to run about, have difficulty sitting quietly,<br/>
or interrupt? Two more and you get ADD/impulsive.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you even make the grade on both lists.  In which case, you&#39;re<br/>
ADD/combined.<br/>
<br/>
Not to worry though if you don&#39;t get the right score.  You can still be<br/>
ADD/not otherwise specified, not enough checkpoints on either list but still<br/>
experiencing symptoms that &quot;disrupt everyday life.&quot;  Whose &quot;everyday life&quot;?<br/>
The life of a child in a rigid and repressive school environment where the<br/>
most natural impulses of youth are consistently stifled?<br/>
<br/>
Disclaimer:  This is not intended as a slur on any parent who has struggled<br/>
to help a child whose life is truly disrupted by pervasive symptoms of ADD<br/>
and who has found vital help through medication and other methods. I<br/>
understand such children and adults really do exist, and I am glad there is<br/>
help for them. I just think the ADD diagnosis is being applied to far too<br/>
many people, especially children, to suit the convenience of a culture that<br/>
is markedly anti-child.<br/>

Michele,<br/>
thanks for reposting this list of awfuls!  by accident I had deleted the <br/>
original.  I feel so sorry for the parents who have perfectly fine children <br/>
and then have their school or dr. tell them this.  <br/>
LOL, most of these &quot;oftens&quot; characterize most normal little boys, don&#39;t you <br/>
think?  I bet, if you took every little boy you know, and put him to this <br/>
test, between the ages of 2 and 8yrs, they would fit the criteria somewhere, <br/>
at some time.  What a bunch of bull.  They should better title this list the <br/>
list of a teachers worst nightmares!   ROFL<br/>
<br/>
Keep on being proud of that &quot;no off button&quot;, and channel that energy into <br/>
lots of fun and learning, and get that great feeling when YOU have taught <br/>
your child a concept, and you see that child get the concept and light up <br/>
with it!  <br/>
