<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001036022">**And Shakespeare is too intense for young kids, or at least my young <br/>
kids.  But when they&#39;re older, I would read Shakespeare with my kids. <br/>
Books and even some tv shows and movies are  more comfortable for me <br/>
because I can sit and pause the reading or pause the movie and <br/>
discuss what is immoral with my kids. I can say this person is acting <br/>
wrong and these were the consequences of their behavior.**<br/>
<br/>
I remember a discussion (in the &#39;70&#39;s!) that said that in the<br/>
Shakespearean histories and tragedies care was taken to introduce the<br/>
victim characters as sympathetic people before killing them.  The<br/>
comparison made at that time was that in Baretta (a show about a street<br/>
cop) characters just popped up on the screen, often with no dialog, and<br/>
were mown down unceremoniously.  The implication was that without<br/>
showing the victims of violence as sympathetic humans the viewer would<br/>
feel less empathy and become more callous.  What do you think?  Are<br/>
there more and less moral ways to depict violence and death?<br/>
