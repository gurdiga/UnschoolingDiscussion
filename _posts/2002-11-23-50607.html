My kids didn&#39;t develop any interest in the books, but I read them all four <br/>
myself.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has been playing the CCG (collectible card game) version for almost a <br/>
year, and Kirby just started (she was thrilled to teach Kirby a game!)<br/>
<br/>
They like the movies, though, and Holly will probably read them someday when <br/>
she doesn&#39;t feel that people are expecting her to or will make a big OOh AH <br/>
deal if she does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-365377045">My whole family is ga-ga over the books and movies.   My 9ds, Alec, has read all the books 3 times.  I have read the first one and almost done with the second, reading it with my 8dd.   <br/>
 <br/>
We went to the movie this week,  my daughter wants to go again and again.  I liked it, but not enough Snape&lt;g&gt;.   We had to come home and watch the first one again, just because we could.  <br/>
 <br/>
We even had two Pre-Potter parties to go to in the last month that were so much fun.  One was at a friends house,  and the other was at our Science Center in town.  They got to do all sorts of things that you would do as a student at Hogwarts, even get sorted.  It was a blast.<br/>
Alec is part of the science club there so he was part of organizing and helped run the booths.  <br/>
 He also has all the different games,  alot of times they just play &#39;Harry Potter&#39;  fantasy stuff.   We keep saying we want a pet owl,  but know that won&#39;t happen. <br/>
 <br/>
The movie gave me a little fix,  I only have a month now until Two Towers!<br/>

Your dd might like a book I listened to on tape recently, A Girl Named<br/>
Disaster by Nancy Farmer.  It&#39;s about a barely pubescent girl in Mozambique<br/>
who is about to be married off to a much older man who already has 3 wives.<br/>
Her grandmother helps her make her escape, and most of the book is about her<br/>
travelling and living all by herself on her way to Zimbabwe, where her<br/>
father&#39;s family lives.  It&#39;s a great adventure with the added bonus of a lot<br/>
of interesting cultural info.<br/>
The Redwall books tend to feature strong female characters, though they<br/>
aren&#39;t usually the main character.<br/>

Inuit girl (13?) who runs away after she is married off and loses herself <br/>

That said, my children all love the books, and movies, from my 21 year old down...well, my 3 likes the movies, she isn&#39;t into the books really yet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, although fundies are begining to appear in the UK. A scary <br/>
thought.<br/>
Fortunately the fact that our schools have religious assemblies and <br/>
are taught religious education appears to pput people off for life or <br/>
else they are &#39;live n let live&#39; Church of England goers.<br/>
Fundies are generally known as &#39;happy clappy&#39;s&#39; and seen as a bit <br/>
odd.<br/>
So far.<br/>

women as the main character. I don&#39;t remember how old<br/>
your dd is because some of the content does start<br/>
getting kind of intense (violence/war and sex).<br/>

Here&#39;s her web sight:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh but missionaries can be fun ;-)<br/>
We used to get young American mormons. I would ask them if <br/>
they were upset that they got somewhere as boring as England <br/>
when they could have been converting cannibals in Papua New <br/>
Guinea.<br/>
Sometimes I would invite them in. They are remarkebly congenial. <br/>
One set mowed my lawn, raked the leaves and cleaned the <br/>
guttering for me. A different one fixed my bike.<br/>
All I had to do was look helpless, listen to what they had to say <br/>
and suggest jobs :-)<br/>
