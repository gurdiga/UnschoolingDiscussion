and I took out Pre-Paid legal coverage so that we would never have <br/>
to worry about the legal stuff.  It&#39;s only $26 per month.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there is some way to avoid it on &quot;religious&quot; grounds, <br/>
or....what if you just don&#39;t take the test?  Is someone going to <br/>
come knocking on your door?  Around here, if you say you are <br/>

have to stay out of your business.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Renee!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about being radical on this list!<br/>
I found the laws for NY at Unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com/resources/states/newyork.shtml.">http://www.unschooling.com/resources/states/newyork.shtml.</a><br/>
<br/>
They really do sound like a pain! You have to work on their schedule, submit <br/>
a plan, take tests. They even specify exactly what &quot;needs&quot; to be studied in <br/>
each grade! If by not registering with the school district you mean not <br/>
submitting a &quot;declaration of intent to utilize a homestudy program&quot;, then <br/>
yes that is illegal. However, there are homeschooling families who do that <br/>
and you probably could and get away with it but..... If you think they would <br/>
notice or if the idea just strikes fear into your heart you might like to <br/>
look into Clonlara School&#39;s Home-based Education Program (www.clonlara.org). <br/>
Clonlara&#39;s a nationally accredited private campus school and if you register <br/>
with them you are officially considered a private school student by The <br/>
System,and Clonlara takes care of everything. And they don&#39;t force a <br/>
particular curriculum or even a structured school like system on you. You do <br/>
your thing, Clonlara gives credit for it. There&#39;s a $550 dollar tuition, but <br/>
if you have no alternatives or like the support it&#39;s well worth it and, hey, <br/>
it&#39;s cheaper than private school!<br/>
I can&#39;t think of another way you could do it within the law, because it&#39;s <br/>
awfully strict, but I&#39;m sure the others have some good ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
Erin Mills<br/>

you.  I am speaking only about my state (Oklahoma).  I know this <br/>
is true because I have talked to a social worker at DHS.  I worked <br/>
for a Christian school before unschooling, and was told straight out <br/>
by a social worker that if the parent says they are homeschooling, <br/>
the social worker can&#39;t do anything, her hands are tied legally.  <br/>
Perhaps that is because Oklahoma is the only state which grants <br/>
parents the express right to homeschool in the State Constitution.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know.  This particular social worker told me that they KNEW <br/>
a child was &quot;not being taught&quot; but that because the parent said <br/>
they were homeschooling, legally they were not allowed to <br/>
investigate.  <br/>

<br>I didn&#39;t think that was the way it actually worked. &nbsp;I think the way it goes 
<br>is you are still responsible and you get to call HSLDA (is that who you use?) 
<br>if you get in some sort of trouble and then they decide whether to take on

reports abuse or neglect.  For families whose relatives and neighbors aren&#39;t <br/>
hostile, whose kids are smiley and peaceable, who have no ex-spouses with <br/>
custody issues, homeschooling is just about totally safe, registered or <br/>
unregistered.  But one crazy relative or one neighbor who really hoped paying <br/>
school taxes would mean total silence for six hours a day could cause you <br/>
trouble.<br/>
<br/>
And legal insurance won&#39;t do you any good if when you go for help they say <br/>
&quot;You knowingly broke the law?  Intentionally?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand, few states&#39; homeschooling laws are criminal kinds of <br/>
things where they will really do much to you except to say &quot;You&#39;re not <br/>
registered, you need to register.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico it can build all the way up to a $50 fine if you ignore them <br/>
twice (and if they&#39;ve followed their own too-strict little guidelines).    <br/>
The laws here make it harder for the state or district to figure out how to <br/>
deal with unregistered homeschoolers than it is to homeschool.<br/>

You know what, we lived in a lot of different states when we were in <br/>
the military, and we just didn&#39;t worry about what the state <br/>
requirements were, no matter where we lived.  We just did what we <br/>
wanted to do.  In the majority of cases, though you may get <br/>

you can get legal backup.  <br/>

This really does vary from state to state (and, I assume, country to <br/>
country). Some states make it very easy to homeschool (sounds like OK is one <br/>
of those). Others require much more. For instance, NH requires a written <br/>
notification letter and curriculum at the beginning of the &quot;school&quot; year and <br/>
some sort of testing or evaluation at the end. I haven&#39;t yet figured how to <br/>
make the work with unschooling, since I have a few years before my kids <br/>
reach compulsory education age.<br/>
<br/>
You really need to look at the laws where you are, including what the <br/>
consequences of non-comliance would be.<br/>

No, homeschooling is not proof against charges of sexual abuse or physical <br/>
abuse in ANY state or anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
Educational neglect, perhaps.  <br/>
<br/>
There are things outside the educational purview which are within the purview <br/>
of social workers.  If I know of a homeschooler who is whipping up on a child <br/>
or (heaven forbid) a homeschooling family in which a child is being sexually <br/>
molested, that is not something they can say &quot;We Homeschool&quot; and send <br/>

other illegal activity&quot;.We weren&#39;t even allowed to see our children until the 
court case was heard. It took us a week of fighting before we got them back! All 
because a nosy neighbor called the police when my daughter was babysitting and 
they couldn&#39;t contact us immediately. We were driving at the time. End note was 
the judge threw it out of court, saying the charges were unfounded but it was a 
terrifying experience! we have since moved away from that neighborhood and that 
state. If you follow the law you have a defense, but if you disobey the law, 
realize you do it at your own risk, and most &quot;insurance&quot; would say that violated

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1403627159">Hi Renee,<br/>
Where in NY are you?  I have an 8yog and have never been told she needs to <br/>
take any kind of test.  You may want to check into that.  My 10yog will be <br/>
taking the IOWA test since she&#39;s a &quot;5th grader&quot;.<br/>
I&#39;m near Canandaigua.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hi everyone,my name is Renee and I homeschool my 8 yob. I would like<br/>
&gt;to be an unschooler. I think he would get much more out of<br/>
&gt;learning.Right now we are just banging heads with school books. I<br/>
&gt;live in upstate NY and he has to take the Metropol. Test in May, we<br/>
&gt;are craming so to speak.I do not want to register him next year, I<br/>
&gt;want to go our own way. Is that legal? I hate being on a time<br/>
&gt;schedule with the school district.I hate the school district. I know<br/>
&gt;that sounds radical,I dont mean it that way.How do i procede? Someone<br/>
&gt;PLEASE help.   Thanks, Renee<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t worry about being radical on this list!<br/>
I found the laws for NY at Unschooling.com<br/>

They really do sound like a pain! You have to work on their schedule, submit <br/>
a plan, take tests. They even specify exactly what <br/>
&quot;needs&quot; to be studied in <br/>
each grade! If by not registering with the school <br/>
district you mean not <br/>
submitting a &quot;declaration of intent to utilize a <br/>
homestudy program&quot;, then <br/>
yes that is illegal. However, there are homeschooling families who do that <br/>
and you probably could and get away with it but..... If you think they would <br/>
notice or if the idea just strikes fear into your heart you might like to <br/>
look into Clonlara School&#39;s Home-based Education <br/>
Program (www.clonlara.org). <br/>
Clonlara&#39;s a nationally accredited private campus <br/>
school and if you register <br/>
with them you are officially considered a private <br/>
school student by The <br/>
System,and Clonlara takes care of everything. And they <br/>
don&#39;t force a <br/>
particular curriculum or even a structured school like <br/>
system on you. You do <br/>
your thing, Clonlara gives credit for it. There&#39;s a <br/>
$550 dollar tuition, but <br/>
if you have no alternatives or like the support it&#39;s <br/>
well worth it and, hey, <br/>
it&#39;s cheaper than private school!<br/>
I can&#39;t think of another way you could do it within the law, because it&#39;s <br/>
awfully strict, but I&#39;m sure the others have some good <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

www.goddessmoon.org have an &#39;umbrella school&#39; set up, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re &#39;authorised&#39; (or whatever the <br/>
correct term is) by NY.  I think they&#39;re free, too, <br/>
though a donation would be nice :-)<br/>
