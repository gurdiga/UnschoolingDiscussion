<div id="ygrps-yiv-1842053874">It&#39;s a gorgeous day in VA. Eric, Carly and I just had the best walk in the <br/>
woods. Carly spotted a large barn owl fly and land in an evergreen. <br/>
Fascinating to watch. This led us to look for owl pellets. Carly went inside; <br/>
she&#39;s not into &quot;owl puke.&quot; Found pellets filled with jaws, teeth, a skull, <br/>
vertebrae, and extremities. Looked like two separate animals; no way the jaw <br/>
matched the skull. Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Then we found a &quot;crime scene.&quot; Finch feathers and blood scattered around a <br/>
log. Obviously something had eaten it. Eric collected the beautiful yellow <br/>
feathers. He made his own dream catcher out of the last batch he found. We <br/>
brought everything home and dissected the owl pellet. He plans to add it to <br/>
his nature shelf (a shelf filled with all the stuff he finds outside, <br/>
including a dried bat, skulls, and a dried sparrow). After our walk, he <br/>
worked on his Lego version of SIMS (he was inspired watching Carly play the <br/>
SIMS computer game she got for Christmas). <br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m going to help Carly with our own Trading Spaces. We&#39;re sanding, <br/>
priming and painting her bedroom furniture aqua. <br/>
<br/>
Tonight we&#39;re going to watch UVa play Duke in women&#39;s basketball.<br/>
<br/>
A fun day,<br/>
