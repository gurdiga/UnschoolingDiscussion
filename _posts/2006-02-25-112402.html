<div id="ygrps-yiv-168222305">But Shannon, charge cards are only a scam if you let them be.  If you stay within the rules (pay off the cards in full each month, on time - don&#39;t get a card with an annual fee) then they don&#39;t cost you a penny.   <br/>
<br/>
Just as *ice cream* doesn&#39;t make someone fat, just as *knives* don&#39;t kill people, just as *mirrors* don&#39;t make one vain.... charge cards can&#39;t *get* you into trouble.. the trouble is gluttony, or hatred or pride or greed, or denial or any of those human character flaws...   <br/>
<br/>
What credit cards do do, however, is leave a trail.  Some people want to live more &quot;off grid&quot; as it were -- without that paper trail that corporations may use and that now the government may view from time to time.  That is what creeps me out.  <br/>
<br/>
But still, we use them.  Cheers  :-)<br/>
