<div id="ygrps-yiv-2090168740">***I longed for her to ride up with me and hold hands and talk <br/>
when she was younger and I felt like a taxi-driver as she was an only <br/>
child for seven years. ****<br/>
<br/>
Everyone thinks we&#39;re odd because when we ride together as a family dh (Stuart) rides in the back with Brogan rather than in the front with me.  We however, love it.  Brogan gets to play/ read with her daddy and isn&#39;t left &#39;alone&#39; back there. <br/>
