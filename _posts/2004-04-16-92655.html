they have and play with occasionally for stuff they haven&#39;t asked for<br/>
and may or may not play with?  I don&#39;t have much storage space for<br/>
rotating large groups of toys; we live in a trailer.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556468140">Hi Kristi,<br/>
Since your question is about a space issue and you are considering removing some toys that are not used - i would reply to this by asking you what your kids think and want.  In a similar situation, I&#39;ve talked to my girls about my concerns and considerations and together we&#39;ve come up with solutions that work for all.  (Actually - they almost always come up with great solutions - better than i left to my own devices)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-879277112">Hi Kristy,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying your opinions and that you understood<br/>
what I&#39;ve meant. Thank you. :)<br/>
<br/>
I think there might be a problem in pressuring<br/>
children to get rid of their things. My mum did that a<br/>
lot, and now I&#39;m sorry many of my books and toys are<br/>
gone. They would have been wonderful to play with my<br/>
child now. I also feel a bit ressented she didn&#39;t get<br/>
rid of one piece of her huge china collection, you<br/>
know what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
But if you really have too much stuff lying around<br/>
that is a real problem. Maybe you can ask your<br/>
children what are the toys they want to play with more<br/>
now, and box the others? Then ask a relative with more<br/>
space to keep them for you. You can always get them<br/>
back later.<br/>
<br/>
Get rid of some of your things, as an example, it<br/>
might inspire selection of toys in your children. My<br/>
child always joins in my activities.<br/>
<br/>
I also wouldn&#39;t be shy to say to my family to stop<br/>
offering so many toys. It&#39;s not an uncommon<br/>
charicature the poor bored child with thousands of<br/>
toys. Presents can be suffocating too.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s libraries that have toys. You can go<br/>
there, your children can play with them, and they stay<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
When my child really wants something, I usually buy<br/>
from Ebay - always informing my child it&#39;s usedfor<br/>
respect - but this way of buying it goes more with my<br/>
ecological ideas.<br/>
<br/>
We can treat ourselves to the toys we like to play<br/>
with our children. I do that. I buy a nice wooden dice<br/>
game and we play it together. It&#39;s good to share our<br/>
ideas. That&#39;s what the pro-toy-gun parents are doing,<br/>
they just don&#39;t get it that their ideas are not our<br/>
own. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just my random thoughts, hope it helps.<br/>
<br/>
Leo<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-44907448">I don&#39;t have a problem with others who choose to let their children own<br/>
toy weapons.  Those are not my children to raise, nor my choices to<br/>
make.  I make choices for myself and my family, and I feel strongly that<br/>
I do not want toys in *my* home whose sole purpose is to enact wounding<br/>
and killing.  I try hard not to judge the decisions of others, though I<br/>
am only human and not always successful.  I hope this, too, this<br/>
unwillingness to be judgemental of other people, is a value I&#39;ll pass to<br/>
them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes we pass on our values in surprising ways.  It did sadden me,<br/>
for example, when Morgaine one evening commented, &quot;Wow daddy, your steak<br/>
looks really good.&quot;  And I said, &quot;You know honey, if you want to try it<br/>
it&#39;s okay with me.  I think you&#39;re old enough to choose whether to eat<br/>
animals or not,&quot; and she decided to be a meat eater.  But what was<br/>
interesting was the discussion that came later - one value I&#39;ve tried to<br/>
share is the idea that all life is equal; we live in an intricate web<br/>
and no one life is more important than another.  When we discussed it<br/>
later, the choice of eating meat, I told her that if she wanted to try<br/>
other kinds of animals she&#39;d have to talk with her daddy or her<br/>
grandparents, because, I reminded her, I choose not to buy or cook them.<br/>
She looked out her windows and started a line of thought - &quot;I&#39;d like to<br/>
eat squirrels, and fish, and seagulls.  But I couldn&#39;t eat a cat,<br/>
because cats are people&#39;s pets.  But tigers aren&#39;t people&#39;s pets, and I<br/>
could eat tigers.  And what about mice, mommy, do people eat mice?&quot;  Of<br/>
course nobody will agree to kill and cook a squirrel or seagull for her,<br/>
so I&#39;ve told her that when she&#39;s 10 (hunter safety age in Maine and New<br/>
Hampshire) she can ask her grandfather to teach her to hunt, and she can<br/>
kill the animals and take the skin off and cook them if she wants to.<br/>
Some days she&#39;s a vegetarian again, but when she decides to be an<br/>
omnivore she looks forward to this.  So I went from being sad to being<br/>
glad - she didn&#39;t share my value of not eating animals, but she shared<br/>
the larger, more important value of the equality of life. <br/>
 <br/>
Incidentally (was it Sandra?) had mentioned we have to kill to eat.  Not<br/>
true.  There are people who only eat food that does not require the<br/>
killing of a plant - for example, eating animal products that do not<br/>
require killing of animals, eating vegetables and fruits that do not<br/>
require death of a mother plant (eat a strawberry but not a potato;<br/>
broccoli but not a head of lettuce, etc.).  Not the lifestyle I lead,<br/>
but one that is possible.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262696073">&lt;&lt;Aside from super-frugal we also<br/>
have small space.  Right now it&#39;s pretty full.  I&#39;m wondering if I<br/>
should get rid of some of the stuff, such as the VTech, and get<br/>
something else, such as tinkertoys, to get more bang per square foot.<br/>
Or if, on the other hand, it really matters all that much.  Because part<br/>
of my question involves how strongly I should try to influence the gifts<br/>
they get from mom and MIL, who, in spite of my protests, keep buying<br/>
Orion stuffed Elmos and Morgaine more and more Barbie stuff.  They like<br/>
these, but it takes up space.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We live in a small space too, although admittedly perhaps not as small as<br/>
you - one bedroom apartment. Nor do we have room for visitors - one more<br/>
reason why we are hoping to move soon. Boy I remember when she had only 15<br/>
Barbie&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I can only go back to what we do with Jayn - we only get her toys she asks<br/>
for. Last Christmas Jayn wanted a particular baby doll. I asked my parents<br/>
to get it for her, and Jayn knew they were bringing it (rather than us). Her<br/>
anticipation and excitement was only matched by her delight when she finally<br/>
got it. She told everyone what she would be getting and who was giving it to<br/>
her. On a similar note, for her birthday she wanted a particular doll only<br/>
available at Disneyland. Our tradition is to go there for family events like<br/>
birthdays. She was very excited at the thought of getting this doll on her<br/>
birthday trip. She actually refused to let me buy it for her when we went to<br/>
Disneyland the month before her birthday! <br/>
<br/>
Jayn doesn&#39;t like surprises much. She also has been reluctant to allow me to<br/>
get rid of any of her baby toys - she sometimes gets them out and uses them<br/>
for something or other. Rarely, she offers me something for the Goodwill<br/>
bag. I make room in the home by continually renouncing my own unused stuff<br/>
or done with clothes. I find it very freeing, but I guess neither Jayn nor<br/>
DH feel encumbered by their stuff in the same way I do. We turned the living<br/>
room coat closet into her play/storeroom, and I am assiduous in my sorting,<br/>
tidying and organizing - with her permission when she is done with a game. I<br/>
am going increasingly vertical with storage. I guess we have just adjusted<br/>
to living with our space taken up with kid stuff, instead of our stuff. <br/>
<br/>
What about asking your folks for gift certificates to the stores that you<br/>
may not be able to frequent as often? Then your kids could have the<br/>
opportunity to make their own choices. You can certainly use your lack of<br/>
space as a good reason that they might find understandable.<br/>
<br/>
Personally we never toss/remove technologically based toys unless they have<br/>
become totally broken and even then we sometimes take them apart or to the<br/>
infrequently organized take-apart days at our local HS group. Jayn goes back<br/>
to old computer games in the same way that she goes back to old dvd&#39;s - on<br/>
no particular schedule and in response to who-knows-what external stimuli.<br/>
Actually she rotates through all her toys like that, including the vast<br/>
seeming supply of stuffed animals she has. I&#39;m excited that she responds to<br/>
techno toys as well as &quot;creative&quot; toys like construction stuff and art<br/>
stuff. <br/>
<br/>
At one point you wrote &quot;Strewing is great, but you need space in which to do<br/>
it.&quot; It is also a state of mind as well as a physical action. (Trying to<br/>
think of an example and failing!)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I make choices for myself and my family, and I feel strongly that<br/>

&gt; and killing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(This is really more directed towards what Leo&#39;s been saying, but I couldn&#39;t<br/>
find a good quote that summed up what she was saying as succinctly.)<br/>
<br/>
Choosing for ourselves is good.<br/>
<br/>
And we can&#39;t *not* choose for our families. We&#39;re all going to choose to<br/>
provide for our children things we think are important.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s useful to examine our reasons when making choices for others. It&#39;s<br/>
useful to examine whether our decisions are based on reality or fallacy or<br/>
&quot;better safe than sorry.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Better safe than sorry&quot; is not a bad policy for decisions that affect only<br/>
ourselves. Sometimes we can&#39;t get access to better data to make a more<br/>
informed choice. We might choose to give up something to avoid something<br/>
that might or might not be true.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s not so good -- and should be examined thoroughly -- when used to<br/>
make decisions for other people.<br/>
<br/>
If my husband decided it was better to be safe than sorry to not eat refined<br/>
sugar, he&#39;s welcome to give up a lot of foods to get something that may be<br/>
better. But if he decided the whole family needed to give up refined sugar<br/>
because *he* had come to the conclusion it was better to be safe than sorry,<br/>
then that&#39;s more problematical.<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense that playing acting violence, playing violent video games,<br/>
role-playing violence will reinforce violent tendencies. It makes sense that<br/>
by not allowing children to use toy weapons and by discussing play that<br/>
looks violent and how real violence is bad, that they will be peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
There is data that *seems* to support that theory: Not uncommonly people who<br/>
have committed horribly violent acts have enjoyed watching violence or<br/>
enjoyed playing violent games.<br/>
<br/>
It seems reasonable to assume that violent play leads to violence in real<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
But is it true?<br/>
<br/>
Better to be safe than sorry? That&#39;s not a good enough place to stop on a<br/>
discussion list!<br/>
<br/>
What people take *away* from the list and *do* is up to them. People are<br/>
free to read all the arguments about not controlling our children&#39;s values,<br/>
participate in the debate, and yet still decide to control at home.<br/>
<br/>
Here on this list we discuss and examine what *really* happens in real<br/>
unschooling families. *Real* data that&#39;s applicable to unschooling families<br/>
for people to ponder and turn over to make decisions for their families.<br/>
<br/>
What happens in my home isn&#39;t necessarily what will happen in someone else&#39;s<br/>
home. But the outcome of what I do in my home is more likely to apply to<br/>
someone whose values are similar, than the outcome of some criminal from<br/>
who-knows-what home life.<br/>
<br/>
You and Leo are theorizing that preventing violent play will yeild peaceful<br/>
children. You have two experiments going (your families) and so far your<br/>
results support that theory. But you both have young children so the results<br/>
are, scientifically speaking, not conclusive.<br/>
<br/>
What you don&#39;t have are a large pool of families who are preventing violent<br/>
play to see the range of outcomes. What you don&#39;t have are families where<br/>
children are loved and treated with respect *and* have violent play (toy<br/>
guns, boffers, video games, etc.)<br/>
<br/>
One of the pieces of data being offered is that control is widely used. It&#39;s<br/>
one of the more common parenting techniques so there are lots of examples of<br/>
outcomes. Sometimes control works and children adopt their parents values.<br/>
Sometimes control doesn&#39;t work and children choose differently. Sometimes<br/>
control fails miserably and children choose what&#39;s been forbidden *because*<br/>
it&#39;s been forbidden. Since control doesn&#39;t universally work, there is some<br/>
other factor that caused the children to adopt their family&#39;s values.<br/>
<br/>
(There are families here who use to control and now don&#39;t and they can tell<br/>
you what the differences are that they&#39;ve seen if you ask.)<br/>
<br/>
Control doesn&#39;t work. People *think* it works because it appears to work for<br/>
some families (sometimes it really does and sometimes the kids are very<br/>
different people when out of their parents&#39; sight) and it makes sense that<br/>
it should work. But control often doesn&#39;t work. Unfortunately when it fails<br/>
people don&#39;t usually conclude that control doesn&#39;t work. They conclude that<br/>
they just didn&#39;t control enough.<br/>
<br/>
The other piece of data being offered is many real unschooling familes who<br/>
have allowed their children to explore the pretend violence to the extent<br/>
that intrigues them, and their children are peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
What *isn&#39;t* happening, and what you theorize will happen, is that children<br/>
would extend that violent play into real life.<br/>
<br/>
What will happen in your home is unknowable. There are so many factors. But<br/>
Trust and Respect are seeming to be very big factors in allowing children to<br/>
become the decent loving children we hope for them.<br/>
