&gt; had company and I haven&#39;t had much time to post until last weekend.  <br/>
&gt; Wow!  The last few days were not the best days to try to catch up and<br/>
&gt; participate.   It must have affected my tiny little mind because I<br/>
&gt; dreamed Kelly sent me a private e-mail telling me to proof read. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s good advice, Kelly, thank you.<br/>
