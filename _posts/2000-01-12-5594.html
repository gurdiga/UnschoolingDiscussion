<div id="ygrps-yiv-413740695">Just wanted to quickly introduce myself as a new member of this list. <br/>
My name is Kerry, I live in Western North Carolina and I&#39;m a relaxed<br/>
homeschooling mom of two (ages 5 and 3).  My oldest has an autoimmune<br/>
disorder where even a cold can be devastating for him, so going to<br/>
school wasn&#39;t really an option for us, but we really didn&#39;t like the<br/>
idea of &quot;school at home&quot; either, so we&#39;ve finally relaxed into letting<br/>
the boys follow their own interests and learning at their own pace.  I<br/>
must say it is working out splendidly so far, except perhaps that on<br/>
some days they have SO many interests they aren&#39;t sure what to do<br/>
first!!  At the present, we&#39;re into money from around the world,<br/>
magnets, and dinosaurs. We also have fun with a lot of educational<br/>
software and playing some really cool board games we got for Christmas. <br/>
Oh, and I can&#39;t forget to mention the battery operated jeep that Santa<br/>
brought that will probably kill every flowering shrub and bush in our<br/>
back yard before spring is here!  :-)  Looking forward to getting to<br/>
know you all.  God bless!<br/>
