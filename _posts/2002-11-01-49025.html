&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t understand why any woman would defer the circ issue to the father. <br/>
 <br/>
Men aren&#39;t exactly objective about it.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I deferred to Craig about the ultimate decision because I don&#39;t have a penis. <br/>
<br/>
First we talked about all the issues, including the one about me and my kids <br/>
being Jewish. I was generally against circ. but felt I could be persuaded by <br/>
Craig. However, he was totally against it himself. So, as if we weren&#39;t out <br/>
of the box enough, we have a Jewish boy who is not circumcized! (I know some <br/>
folks will argue if this is even possible, but I&#39;m not interested in talking <br/>
about that in this forum).<br/>

<br/>
I just couldn&#39;t mutilate my children.  <br/>
