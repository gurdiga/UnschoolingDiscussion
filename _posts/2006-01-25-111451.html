<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877246124">Thanks for posting this, Joyce.  When I read your post to him, my son <br/>
got so excited that he had me mark the days on our big calendar so <br/>
that we won&#39;t forget. <br/>
<br/>
We just bought a North American bird book about two weeks ago and <br/>
we&#39;ve been having fun trying to identify the birds in our yard (we <br/>
have the only pesticide free yard in the neighborhood and even our <br/>
neighbors notice that we have more birds, butterflies, dragonflies, <br/>
etc. than they do ;) <br/>
