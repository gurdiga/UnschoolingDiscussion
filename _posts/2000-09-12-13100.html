<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141070598">Yesterday I was filling out my absentee ballot and came to &quot;superintendent<br/>
of public instruction&quot;. Since they&#39;re all non-partisan and I couldn&#39;t tell<br/>
by their written profiles how they felt about homeschooling, I emailed all<br/>
of them to ask. (this was a great lesson for my kids)<br/>
<br/>
The first to respond was David Blomstrom. I give him points for promptness<br/>
and honesty...as he said he never really thought about homeschooling, but<br/>
could understand why people would leave the p/s system. He wanted to &quot;fix&quot;<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Then came Neil T. B. Helgeland, who rambled almost as bad as in his on-line<br/>
profile. He then asked me for money.<br/>
<br/>
While on-line  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dnet.org/wa/">http://www.dnet.org/wa/</a>  (thanks to Blomstrom) I read that<br/>
Arthur Hu is in favor of homeschooling and any other alternative to<br/>
traditional p/s also, but gives no details. (IOW, regulated homeschooling or<br/>
hands-off homeschooling?) He has yet to respond to my email so I can&#39;t say.<br/>
<br/>
As you can imagine, Terry Bergeson didn&#39;t say anything meaningful in her<br/>
profile and has not emailed, either.<br/>
<br/>
The winner for me is Don Crawford. His response to my question &quot;What is your<br/>
position on homeschooling?&quot; is below.<br/>
<br/>
---Valerie (sorry for any duplicates...I&#39;m sending this to all my<br/>
homeschooling lists)<br/>
<br/>
I am in favor of home schooling.  It should be totally deregulated (as<br/>
should the public schools-back to local control).  I also would support a<br/>
tax credit for anyone whose child is not schooled at taxpayer expense, which<br/>
would include homeschoolers as well as private schoolers (like our family).<br/>
I&#39;m a Libertarian so I&#39;m firmly committed to such ideas.<br/>
