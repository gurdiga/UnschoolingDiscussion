<div id="ygrps-yiv-396738334">Okay, this is difficult for me to explain, and it may take a few clarification, but here goes:<br/>
<br/>
I have been consciously trying to change some habitual reactions I have when my children quarrel or whine, etc...I&#39;ve also been working hard to say yes wherever possible and not to lose my cool when I&#39;m really frustrated.  Of course, I&#39;m still working on this, but I am, I think, noticeably different to my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m noticing, and I&#39;ve noticed this before when I have tried to get a handle on my behavior and make significant changes in the way we are living together, is that my 4 yo daughter Stella seems to get more pointedly petulant (like that alliteration!?).  I mean, it seems like she wants to see just how far she can push things with me.  It&#39;s as though she senses a weakness or maybe just doesn&#39;t like the unfamiliar change in my overall demeanor.  It&#39;s not like I was an ogre all the time before, but my attitude is different in general and she seems suspicious.  I can see her wheels turning before she does something that before would really set me off, like suddenly snatching something Annie&#39;s been happily playing with and screeching in her face, &quot;That&#39;s mine!&quot; when just five minutes before she could care less that Annie had it.  She looks at me first and then afterwards to see what my reaction will be.  I swear she is doing this to get a rise out of me, not Annie! That&#39;s only example I can think of at the moment, and it isn&#39;t even the best one. <br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m wondering is if anyone else saw this kind of thing when they started being more connected and aware?  Do you think it will last long?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795413931">&lt;&lt;Do you think it will last long?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The more you react, the longer it will last.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter had a &quot;map of the world&quot; before.  She would do &quot;A&quot; and you<br/>
would do &quot;B&quot;.  Suddenly, the map changed.  &quot;B&quot; doesn&#39;t happen.<br/>
<br/>
Being a smart and inquisitive child, she wants to know what happened, why<br/>
the cause didn&#39;t have the same effect.<br/>
<br/>
Your dd isn&#39;t testing you....she is performing a social psychology<br/>
experiment &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
No really, she isn&#39;t defying you....she is trying to understand what is<br/>
going on.  If you go back to raving, even once, she will need to experiment<br/>
longer to find out what is going on.<br/>

<br/>
You know this more of what I&#39;ve been suspecting...didn&#39;t know how to word<br/>
it.  Stella has always tried hard to understand the &quot;why&quot; of things,<br/>
especially why people say and do the things they do.  She is very<br/>
smart...nothing seems to get by her!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll just have to try hard to stay on track so that the new way makes sense<br/>
and she trusts it.<br/>
<br/>
Today has been a really fun day of &quot;yesses&quot; by the ways!<br/>
