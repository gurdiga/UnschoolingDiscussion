<div id="ygrps-yiv-538259633">Someone mentioned something about the value of computer <br/>
games a few threads ago. I have this quote sent to me from a <br/>
student that made me crack up.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The most explicit level of learning that takes place as one plays <br/>
a video or computer game is that one is learning how to do <br/>
something. As one plays one learns, gradually or quickly, the <br/>
moves of the game Â– how the various characters, pieces, or <br/>
anything else operate and what you can make them do. One <br/>
learns how to drag tiles to build up a virtual city or theme park. <br/>
One learns how to virtually fight and protect oneself. One learns <br/>
how to train a creature and make it evolve. And of course one <br/>
learns the physical manipulations of the controllers involved in <br/>
doing all this. &quot;<br/>

(McGraw-Hill) and founder and CEO of Games2Train<br/>
<br/>
I love that this quote validates the value of computer gaming as <br/>
having merit *in and of itself* rather than always having to say <br/>
that computer gaming is only of value as it relates to other *more <br/>
esteemed* activities.<br/>
