<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When I go to conferences I like to hear people talk, though,  I don&#39;t mind <br/>
&gt; hearing them answer questions, but I don&#39;t want to go to a conference to <br/>
&gt; hear <br/>
&gt; everybody else say what they think, because some of the people at <br/>
&gt; conferences <br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t even unschooled, and so their opinions are kinda time-wasting if <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; get the mike for too long. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The REALLY cool thing about the Live & Learn Conference is that it is SOLELY <br/>
UNschooling. All the presenters are unschoolers you&#39;ve either &quot;met&quot; here or <br/>
on the unschooling.com message boards. You will find no better panel of <br/>
UNschoolers anywhere!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 And if an hour of a conference is spent answering <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; things like &quot;what about socialization&quot; and &quot;how can they learn to read <br/>
&gt; without phonics&quot; then those who paid money aren&#39;t getting much good <br/>
&gt; information, and those asking those questions could have them answered by <br/>
&gt; just looking around at the kids and by reading any beginning unschooling <br/>
&gt; article, or picking up two or three homeschooling magazines until they find <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; an article on reading.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And most of the attendees are ALREADY hard-core unschoolers or are &quot;almost <br/>
there&quot; wannabees. It&#39;s very exciting to have THAT many folks who &quot;get it&quot; in <br/>
one building. There&#39;s NO discussion of &quot;socialization&quot; (I can&#39;t remember <br/>
any)---it&#39;s obvious if you just look around. Reading and math are usual <br/>
concerns with newbies, so those subjects DO come up. The philosophy of <br/>
unschooling seemed to be a popular &quot;subject&quot; last year.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t love panel discussions much either, because too often it granulates <br/>
&gt; the information down into little reactionary bits and there&#39;s  not enough <br/>
&gt; cohesion to get a good point.  There was an unschooling panel at last <br/>
&gt; year&#39;s <br/>
&gt; HSC conference.  There were some good moments, but overall it seemed very <br/>
&gt; disjoint to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>AH! But if the panel members are all on the same wavelength---what a cool way <br/>
to get your questions answered! A panel set up at the end *shouldn&#39;t* have to <br/>
answer a lot of those exhaustive questions &#39;cause many should have been <br/>
answered throughout the weekend (I would think). <br/>
<br/>
Panel discussion this year? Yay? Nay?<br/>

had all the presenters.  So I say Yay.  It really was not focused on the <br/>
socialization etc issues that we have all had to answer.<br/>

Is unschooling fairly common in California? I know that California is big on separation of school and state. Get more from the Web.  FREE MSN Explorer download : <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://explorer.msn.com">http://explorer.msn.com</a><br/>

&lt;&lt; I liked the way it was handled last year.  Near the end of the weekend and <br/>

<br/>
I heard Marty was on it last year! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Something like that is different from what&#39;s happening this year at HSC which <br/>
is more presentations than not will be panels.  One or two are fine, and <br/>
giving people choices seems fine to me and me being on a panel discussion (or <br/>
not) is fine, I just don&#39;t like them better than I like a presentation on a <br/>
topic by a person I actually really want to hear.   <br/>
<br/>
If I want to hear Richard Prystowsky or Pam Sorooshian (people I&#39;ve wanted to <br/>
hear in Caliornia, for examples), I&#39;d rather hear them for some sustained <br/>
period of time without four or five others having a chance of disputing them. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;    On the other hand (or on a totally different hand, rather) I like <br/>
joint workshops with Richard, and Pam and I are doing a joint thing in South <br/>
Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
With two people who know each other and feel a complementary relationship, <br/>
presenting together can be more powerful than either one alone, in my <br/>
experience.  And with Richard, we plan who will lead into the other&#39;s points, <br/>
and that has worked out really well three times.  We did a fourth <br/>
presentation (our first) which was one person asking us both questions.  <br/>
Since we didn&#39;t do the planning, it didn&#39;t have the really smooth flow we&#39;ve <br/>
tried to get the other times.<br/>
<br/>
What Pam and I are thinking of doing is telling stories about the other <br/>
person&#39;s kids or family.  Our families have been together, whole and in <br/>
various partial combinations, several times.<br/>
 Pam&#39;s been to my house and I&#39;ve been to hers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-737432151">I have to say that the whole panel thing, or even whole room discussions <br/>
are my favorite bits of &#39;education&#39; conferences (only been to HSC&#39;s, so <br/>
there&#39;s that as well.)  While it&#39;s nice to sit on one&#39;s duff and listen to <br/>
an &#39;expert&#39; hold forth,  I generally find my mind wandering in the first 10 <br/>
or 15 minutes.  It&#39;s just not as engaging as a whole-room or panel <br/>
discussion where you might yourself have a question, suggestion or <br/>
challenge.  With a whole-room/panel, there&#39;s a variation on <br/>
philosophies.  Maybe that&#39;s part of it.<br/>
<br/>
When many people are responsible for sharing, the session seems somehow, <br/>
well, more robust, more interesting.  Maybe it&#39;s that there&#39;s more <br/>
engagement, more challenge to the faculties with panels/whole-room <br/>
conversations than head-bobbing in agreement with the lone speaker (or <br/>
head-shaking and not being able to question their thinking.)<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I&#39;m just too cantankerous to deal with &#39;experts&#39; anymore. (grin)<br/>

Usually the people who have the least interesting things to say are <br/>
those who dominate the panel discussions. It is some kind of law &lt;G&gt;!<br/>
