<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267996761">Hey!  I think that&#39;s a great idea!  Maybe the kids could hook up with each <br/>
other as pen pals.  They could learn about each other&#39;s hometowns and <br/>
practice their typing and spelling skills!  Sounds like a great unschooling <br/>
project!  My 11 year old daughter would love this.   Jackie</div>

 My girls are also looking to chat online with someone.  Our eldest <br/>
 daughter will be 14 in less than a month, and our youngest <br/>
 daughter is 81/2.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
I know my oldest (11) would like to.  Let us know when!<br/>
