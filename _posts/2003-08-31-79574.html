<div id="ygrps-yiv-122429123"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Well, I&#39;m sitting here thinking how I&#39;ve tried to do the absolute <br/>
&gt; very best by my kids by unschooling them, and letting them make their<br/>
&gt; own choices about what they want to study.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of unschooling that is helpful to many people is to stop thinking in<br/>
terms of &quot;letting them make their own choices about what they want to<br/>
study&quot;. Let them just live their lives and pursue their interests and change<br/>
their interests when they want to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So when my son said he<br/>
&gt; wanted this, I had no reason to not believe him.  No reason to think<br/>
&gt; that he wouldn&#39;t complete the work, because in the past when he has<br/>
&gt; asked to do something, he&#39;s always completed it.  He&#39;s always been<br/>
&gt; very responsible, so no reason to think he wouldn&#39;t be again.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have the opportunity to learn something good and valuable here if you&#39;ll<br/>
let yourself. He very likely did not start this course thinking, &quot;I&#39;ll trick<br/>
my Mom into paying a huge amount of money and then I&#39;ll just QUIT!<br/>
Hahahahaha.&quot; He probably thought he&#39;d enjoy it and found that he didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m sitting here thinking, how could I ever have known that this<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t the right choice for him, when he told me it&#39;s what he wanted?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can&#39;t. Everyone makes mistakes. Continuing to do something we don&#39;t want<br/>
for the sake of money is putting money ahead of humans. Bad idea. Your son<br/>
will make mistakes, being human and all. If you can look at him and his<br/>
needs first and &quot;money and contracts&quot; second, you can heal what was done to<br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I guess the &quot;right thing&quot; is for me to just suck it up and pay the<br/>
&gt; money, but for my son to not have to do anything.  Wish I could get<br/>
&gt; the people in MY life to let me get away with that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They might, if you give them the opportunity and example.<br/>
<br/>
If you try something new in a restaurant and don&#39;t like it, do you finish<br/>
the plate anyway because you paid for it? If you&#39;re full, do you keep eating<br/>
anyway, because you paid for it?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to be that way. Still am to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s really a horrible burden to obligate myself to myself not to waste<br/>
anything. As Sandra pointed out, once a meal is paid for is it less wasteful<br/>
to eat beyond your capacity and grow fat or to throw the food away? At<br/>
restaurants we can&#39;t choose how much food they bring us. We&#39;re at the mercy<br/>
of restaurants and that isn&#39;t fair to ourselves to enslave our waistlines to<br/>
the retaurant&#39;s choice of how much food is put on our plates.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found it more freeing to do what I can to prevent waste -- turning off<br/>
lights when I see them on, not taking more food than I can eat -- than to<br/>
&quot;use up&quot; waste in a situation that was out of my control. I can&#39;t control<br/>
how much food I get at a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>
And I can&#39;t control the content of a class once I sign up for it. I owe it<br/>
to myself to find out as much as I can about a class to see if I&#39;ll enjoy<br/>
it, but once the money is spent, if the class isn&#39;t what I hoped it would be<br/>
then the money is gone whether I&#39;m sitting at home or sitting in misery in a<br/>
class I dislike.<br/>

****************************************************<br/>
So, if you absolutely absolutely hate something you order at a restaurant, <br/>
you force yourself to eat it anyway because you don&#39;t believe in wasting <br/>
anything? That makes no sense whatsoever! If you are full, you keep putting the fork <br/>
in your mouth? Take it home! They allow that!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to waste things either, BUT if I don&#39;t like what I ordered, I <br/>
don&#39;t look at it as a waste, I know that I won&#39;t order that again. No waste. If <br/>
I buy a book for my kids and they don&#39;t use it and it sits on a shelf, did I <br/>
waste my money or a tree or my time? NO. Maybe someday, they will look at the <br/>
book, maybe someday I will have another kid who will, or a grandchild, or my <br/>
husband, or a niece, or maybe one of you will post one day that one of your kids <br/>
is looking for this certain book and just can&#39;t find it... Just because <br/>
something isn&#39;t what you thought it should be initially, does not mean it is <br/>
valueless, or wasted. I bought a different brand of that boxed mac-n-cheese stuff, I <br/>
don&#39;t like any of it, but my kids do and it is easy for them to fix. Turns <br/>
out that *on sale* doesn&#39;t translate into *my kids love it* good thing though. I <br/>
forgot to buy dog food and wasn&#39;t getting back out until later that evening. <br/>
The dog was hungry, the kids said YUCK and the dog got mac-n-cheese at a cost <br/>
to me of thirty-three cents. Well, worth it if you ask me. Other wise I would <br/>
have had to call Darin, ask him to come home to give me the car so I could go <br/>
back out, buy the dog food, then go back out again to get Darin when he was <br/>
done with work. Cost? More than thirty-three cents I assure you. <br/>
<br/>
Granted your cost was way more than thirty-three cents, BUT can&#39;t you turn <br/>
this around somehow? Others have suggested just quitting, someone else suggested <br/>
keeping the things, maybe he will use them later, nothing wrong with that. <br/>
You have to set this right in your mind by yourself. It isn&#39;t your kids fault <br/>
that he doesn&#39;t like the class. He thought he might like it, he didn&#39;t, end of <br/>
story. I thought my kids would like the mac-n-cheese, what do I know? I don&#39;t <br/>
eat it. Obviously this is comparing apples and oranges, but really it is the <br/>
same thing, after all they are both fruit. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360715895">Well you could always send the dish back to the kitchen if it was<br/>
truly awful or see if someone else in your family did like it or<br/>
want to finish the meal. That&#39;s not wasting anything either.  There <br/>
isn&#39;t just one way to look at that.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the home course on photography.... same suggestions apply <br/>
here.  If there is a time limit on the course see if someone else in <br/>
your family would rather have a go at it instead.  If there&#39;s no time <br/>
requirements there&#39;s loads of options.  1) Do nothing for a bit,  2)<br/>
wait and see if your DS gets interested in it again at a later date, <br/>
3) &lt;as others suggested&gt; sit down with it and check it out together, <br/>
4) sell the damn thing on eBay and get some of your money back.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
The list of options can go on and on.  Take a deep breath, take a <br/>
step back, and remember that this is only &quot;stuff&quot;..... shouldn&#39;t your <br/>
SON and his feelings come first?  :)<br/>

Sounds like you don&#39;t like to admit having made a mistake maybe?<br/>
<br/>
A gift you might give your son is the ability to say, &quot;I blew it that time.&quot; It is quite a useful ability to have!! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It sounds, though, like it might be difficult for him to admit to you that he simply messed up and though something would be cool, but it turned out he didn&#39;t feel like doing it after all.<br/>
<br/>
OR - maybe there were underlying reasons he thought he wanted to do it - maybe he was trying to please you and hoped that once it was in front of him he&#39;d feel more motivated, but he doesn&#39;t and now he might be feeling embarrassed or defensive about saying so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a good point.<br/>
<br/>
When we want our kids to make the decisions we would and they know we&#39;ll be<br/>
disappointed if they choose differently we&#39;ve put up a road block between us<br/>
and them. If they only feel comfortable telling us what we want to hear what<br/>
do they do with the stuff we don&#39;t want to hear? They can not talk about it.<br/>
(It sounds like he&#39;s doing that now. He can&#39;t tell you he doesn&#39;t like the<br/>
course because he knows you&#39;d be disappointed in him for not sticking it out<br/>
or having made a bad decision.) Or they can tell friends. Or they can lie.<br/>
Or they can pretend.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re lying to ourselves if we think we can *make* them want what we want,<br/>
think like we think, value what we value. We can create an emotional<br/>
environment so they feel the most comfortable option is to *pretend* they<br/>
are what we want them to be. And that can give us false feedback that they<br/>
are taking on our values.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean we have no influence, that we should just give up, though!<br/>
We can *live* our values joyfully and talk about why we feel those values<br/>
are important *to us* (not why *they* should think they&#39;re important). They<br/>
trust us and love us and they&#39;ll take seriously what we value if we present<br/>
it as *our* values rather than how we want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
We can talk to them about how something is making us feel rather than<br/>
bringing down the law on their heads with &quot;Here&#39;s the problem and here&#39;s<br/>
what you need to do to fix it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And our feelings are an area we need to examine. All our feelings feel<br/>
legitimate! ;-) But sometimes we&#39;re basing feelings on limitations that<br/>
exist only in our heads, like how clean the house &quot;needs&quot; to be. I think<br/>
that&#39;s where this list is so valuable. The people here make us question what<br/>
we think is right and true and necessary and we can see things in ways we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have thought to on our own :-)<br/>
