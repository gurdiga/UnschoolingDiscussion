<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731155858">Long before I decided to homeschool or even unschool, I wondered about<br/>
this issue. And unschooling has only complicated the matter, so I<br/>
thought I&#39;d see what the tendency is here.<br/>
<br/>
While growing up, the only lessons I ever had and the only &quot;sport&quot; I<br/>
was in were piano playing and Bible quizzing. The piano playing, as I<br/>
found out just recently from my mother, was because &quot;You used to<br/>
tinker on it at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, of course we (my sister and I) did. It was all there was besides<br/>
my dad&#39;s trombone! And getting an embrasure out of a 6 year old would<br/>
be hard enough but LIFTING the trombone would have been near<br/>
impossible! And even 6 month old babies pound away on a keyboard.<br/>
<br/>
So we were subjected to lessons for 8 years, of which I gained a great<br/>
understanding of music theory, but no more talent than I did when I began.<br/>
<br/>
The Bible quizzing was something *I* picked and loved, as it gave me a<br/>
place to meet friends which I didn&#39;t have at my private school. And<br/>
even after I switched to the public school (which I LOVED since people<br/>
didn&#39;t make fun of me!) I still loved the competition and memorization<br/>
of quizzing.<br/>
<br/>
But if my parents had suggested or offered or shown me other choices,<br/>
I might have tried soccer, softball, volleyball, maybe ANOTHER<br/>
instrument, dance, who knows?<br/>
<br/>
And so when my daughter was about 3 (she&#39;ll be 6 in a month) and some<br/>
of her peers started joining dance classes or swimming classes or<br/>
whatever, I wondered if I should be putting HER in a class.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that I want my kids to be aware of their options for ANY<br/>
skill, but I&#39;m not sure how to show them all of them with the<br/>
knowledge that they can actually TRY them if they want (in other<br/>
words, watching grown men on TV to my kids doesn&#39;t translate to &quot;Oh,<br/>
can we do that, too?&quot; - they see it as  &quot;big person&quot; activity for when<br/>
they grow up.)<br/>
<br/>
I did watch America&#39;s Got Talent with them a few times to show them<br/>
all the different things people can do, and told them, &quot;If you ever<br/>
want to do something you see other people do, let me know and maybe<br/>
you can  learn it&quot; (maybe being defendant only on if there are classes<br/>
or videos or books or money to find a way to learn it.)<br/>
<br/>
But I argue two ways in my head: <br/>
<br/>
One: The earlier they start something, then they won&#39;t be behind when<br/>
they are doing it for competition or something<br/>
<br/>
Two: The earlier they start they will burn out sooner and hate the<br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not sure either is true, or for that matter if classes of any<br/>
nature at this age is good or bad or neither...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new enough to this, and having had not background with activities<br/>
that were chosen by me from many choices, I&#39;m not sure what to do, if<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that some day out of the blue they will say to me, &quot;I<br/>
want to learn how to tap dance&quot; if they&#39;ve never seen it. I wish so<br/>
much that my parents had at least given me the option or chance to be<br/>
involved in SOMETHING other than piano because maybe I would have<br/>
gained confidence from team sports or found friends from it.<br/>
<br/>
I did sign Amber up for Girl Scouts, and I&#39;ll probably be her leader.<br/>
She&#39;s looking forward to that as she&#39;s my social butterfly. She also<br/>
seems interested in karate, which starts at age 6 at the YMCA here,<br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t mind that at all, if I can wing it with the twins somehow.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t know what the WISE thing to do would be.<br/>
<br/>
What have you guys done as far as activities or sports?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471063396">Embouchure is &quot;the mouth thing&quot; (sometimes referring to the  <br/>
mouthpiece of a wind instrument, and more often to the whole set of  <br/>
factors about the position and muscle set and positioning of lips to  <br/>
whatever flute or reed or brass-mouthpiece situation is at hand.<br/>
<br/>
I had to look up the spelling because I hadn&#39;t heard or thought that  <br/>
word for decades, but I used to play clarinet.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It was all there was besides<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Embrasure is a word, but it&#39;s about castle construction and arrow  <br/>
shooting and oil pouring... I&#39;ve heard that word many times since  <br/>
I&#39;ve heard the other.  I&#39;ve managed to help lots of people learn to  <br/>
play recorder without ever using that &quot;embouchure&quot; word, but largely  <br/>
because with playing recorder one holds the mouthpiece lightly and  <br/>
loosely and no biting or lip pressure at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...  Sorry to people who just glossed over the word as something  <br/>
they didn&#39;t understand and wondered what a trombone playing dad might  <br/>
be wanting to get out of a six year old.<br/>
<br/>
Me too, about piano curiosity and access leading to lessons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll answer the other stuff in another note.<br/>

Megan is still taking Taekwondo and really enjoys it.  She only goes when she wants and I try not to worry about the cost (we are charged for the classes even if she doesn&#39;t go).  Past that post....our local Parks & Rec offered a four week horseback riding class.  I really thought Megan would enjoy it.  But she didn&#39;t even want to talk about it.  So I dropped it.  Megan says Taekwondo is enough &quot;school&quot; for now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But for some kids it would be. That&#39;s why getting to know what each  <br/>
of your kids need is more important than a consensus of what other  <br/>
people would do :-)<br/>
<br/>
Rather than a commitment to something that sounded fun, trying things  <br/>
out, knowing they can quit is good. Just telling kids about their  <br/>
options isn&#39;t enough for all kids but for some kids it is.<br/>
<br/>
Trying something is learning too. They learn a little more about  <br/>
something and a little more about who they are and what they like (at  <br/>
the moment).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One: The earlier they start something, then they won&#39;t be behind when<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unless a child is driven to do something, competition is really more  <br/>
about adult egos than what children enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
The more you expose them to, the more likely they&#39;ll find what floats  <br/>
their boats. But be prepared to let it be *their* boat. Let go once  <br/>
they take the wheel and let them explore as far as they want to go.  <br/>
Open the locks for them, but let them decide.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Two: The earlier they start they will burn out sooner and hate the<br/>
&gt; activity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s too easy for parents to see a child who is really good  <br/>
at something when young and start projecting greatness into the  <br/>
future. Not always in a grasping way, but thinking how much fun it  <br/>
will be for the child to excel at something they enjoy. So when the  <br/>
child is done, the parent can feel their own hopes for that happiness  <br/>
crushed.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t a reason for a child to burn out unless there&#39;s pressure.  <br/>
(Usually it&#39;s external, though not always.) There are lots of reasons  <br/>
for a child to feel they&#39;re done for now and move onto something else.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I&#39;m not sure either is true, or for that matter if classes of any<br/>
&gt; nature at this age is good or bad or neither...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Depends on the child :-)<br/>
<br/>
But I think exposure in a nonpressure way is more important than  <br/>
classes. Attend performances. Go to Saturday night dances. Read  <br/>
books. Watch movies. Talk to people.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter started guitar lessons when she was 15. And she went  <br/>
through the motions, wanting to be good but not really fired up about  <br/>
it. It wasn&#39;t until she watched old videos of Eddie Van Halen that  <br/>
she &quot;caught the bug&quot;. *Then* the lessons had meaning.<br/>
<br/>
Lessons are more likely to feed a fire that&#39;s already lit than to  <br/>
light the fire themselves.<br/>

<br/>
-=-The more you expose them to, the more likely they&#39;ll find what floats<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Organized activities - is there a good, or better time?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think of one-on-one lessons as &quot;organized activities.&quot;   <br/>
Classes with projects, yes.  Camp.<br/>
<br/>
The time for any of that is when a kid thinks it will be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Last night when I was full of adrenaline, after I *finally* had read  <br/>
all my e-mail, I played Clementi.  I would say I played sonatas, but  <br/>
I only played the fast and hard movements that involve speed and  <br/>
banging.  Soft, quiet, peaceful movements would have just frustrated  <br/>
me.  I needed something physical and a little big furious.  And I  <br/>
found myself swinging my leg in time with the music--and my WHOLE  <br/>
leg, knee down.<br/>
<br/>
If I were a runner, I would&#39;ve run and run, but I&#39;m more a leg- <br/>
breaker and a fall-downer, unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
When I was five my parents found a piano teacher.  About a year  <br/>
later, 14 months, I&#39;m not sure, I quit, in tears, insisting I didn&#39;t  <br/>
want it anymore.  Y&#39;know what I wanted?  To watch Wagon Train.  But I  <br/>
didn&#39;t have the idea that maybe they could&#39;ve rescheduled my lesson.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 12 or 13 I started lessons again, because I wanted to.  I  <br/>
still had practiced the things I had learned, and expanded on them.   <br/>
I had started playing clarinet at the age of 11 (5th grade band) and  <br/>
I was reading music at church, in choir.  So I wasn&#39;t needing the way- <br/>
difficult part of learning to read notation or of learning where  <br/>
things were on the piano.  I knew all that.  I went for several reasons:<br/>
<br/>
direction<br/>
<br/>
coaching<br/>
<br/>
to get good enough to play at church, because I had become very  <br/>
religious<br/>
<br/>
I was never really good enough to play at church.  I subbed a couple  <br/>
of times for unimportant services, and I made mistakes and I hated that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I have had an interest in music my whole life, and in the  <br/>
history and connections and theory and internationalness and  <br/>
snobbishness of &quot;formal musicianship,&quot; and traditions of folk music,  <br/>
and there is a UNIVERSE of music that doesn&#39;t involve lessons.<br/>
<br/>
Try to look at it (music, everything) as learning, instead of  <br/>
&quot;activities.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584885818">Until this fall ( Naruto my son turned 6 this Summer) we have only tried a class once.<br/>
It was supposed to be a French class in one of his best friends home with only playing, songs and games.<br/>
He is a very social guy that craves beeing  around his friends. They also told me if he was not interested he could walk away and go play in the play room..<br/>
The other kids were all homeschooled.<br/>
Needless to say when he was bored and ready to move on he was &quot;encouraged&quot; to stay still and &quot;pay attention&quot;<br/>
So we went to a few classes because he wanted to go but it was  bittersweet for both of us.<br/>
This fall he is doing tons.<br/>
He is doing theater once a week.<br/>
TaeKwon Do whenever he wants ( we pay per month and you can come as much or as little as you want)<br/>
He joined Cub Scout.<br/>
We are part of a homeschool group that gets together for field trips and lots of great stuff once a week.<br/>
We also just started in a co-op where they have classes 2-3 times a month from 1PM until 3:30PM<br/>
for Chess, Lego, Theater and Arts.<br/>
We did our first session yesterday and he loved it so far.<br/>
I cringe about it a bit but he loves being around other kids.<br/>
He will go when he wants to. It is early to say if he will keep a busy schedule like that.<br/>
Organized activities would not have been fun for him even a few months ago.<br/>
But now he wants those and wants to be around other children.<br/>
As long as he does those without expectations from my part I think we will be OK.<br/>
I read that one of Pam&#39;s daughters had the same needs and that they did a lot of group activities.<br/>
Any input and ideas would be appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-691521520"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; And so when my daughter was about 3 (she&#39;ll be 6 in a month) and some<br/>
&gt; of her peers started joining dance classes or swimming classes or<br/>
&gt; whatever, I wondered if I should be putting HER in a class.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest, now 14, took a lot of classes when she was little.  I taught<br/>
dance classes at a rec center and she came along for the ride, so to<br/>
speak, so while I was teaching, she was taking classes.  This started<br/>
about the age of almost 5.  She took dance classes with me, gymnastic<br/>
classes, sport classes, spanish classes, craft classes, whatever looked<br/>
fun to her, she did it.  She was there in the building with me, so she<br/>
did stuff.  She loved it a lot!  There was a huge multi-level jungle gym<br/>
thing too that she spent a lot of time exploring as well.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; One: The earlier they start something, then they won&#39;t be behind when<br/>
&gt; they are doing it for competition or something<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I really don&#39;t like the idea of being behind or ahead, even for<br/>
competitive sports.  If a kid has the talent and drive they will do it. <br/>
I know parents that push and help their kids get there, but it seems<br/>
that the kids that end up really making it, did it because they wanted<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter is taking ice skating lessons right now.  It gets<br/>
really competitive as you get older and more advanced.  I see parents of<br/>
young children, forcing them to practice and visibly see their faces go<br/>
blank and sad with the pressure, while all their friends are playing and<br/>
having fun.<br/>
<br/>
When Chamille was little and took ice skating lessons, this was a big<br/>
factor that made her stop taking classes.  She didn&#39;t like the way some<br/>
of the parents treated their kids and it was enough to make the<br/>
experience unpleasant for her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Two: The earlier they start they will burn out sooner and hate the<br/>
&gt; activity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure that all of that is external pressure.  If a kid is happily<br/>
enjoying an activity at any age, they will do it until it is no longer<br/>
enjoyable and stop doing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; What have you guys done as far as activities or sports?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Margaux and Chamille have been involved in, either both or one or the<br/>
other, Girl Scouts, tennis, swimming, dance, gymnastics, gym games, ice<br/>
skating, martial arts, foreign language, art, and many other things. <br/>
Those were just the organized things that they&#39;ve done or are doing. <br/>
There were other things that we&#39;ve done that have been active and fun<br/>
that weren&#39;t in classes.</div>

don&#39;t have a lot of shows and stuff here (very rural area) and for now<br/>
it&#39;s hard to go to things with the twins. I can determinately wait<br/>
another year, but I just wanted to see if other unschoolers had their<br/>
kids in organized things this young or not, and why.<br/>

I got pretty good at finding ways to let her sample lots of different  <br/>

&gt; But how do they know what&#39;s out there? I&#39;d like to get them exposure<br/>
&gt; so they can see the choices, since I never got that chance. But short<br/>
&gt; of signing them up, how to I expose them, then, is the question? We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have a lot of shows and stuff here (very rural area) and for now<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s hard to go to things with the twins. I can determinately wait<br/>
&gt; another year, but I just wanted to see if other unschoolers had their<br/>
&gt; kids in organized things this young or not, and why.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of your job, if you are serious about unschooling, is to find ways<br/>
to expose your kids to lots of things.  Books and organized classes are<br/>
not the only way to find information.  It&#39;s how schools do it, and<br/>
people get locked into thinking that&#39;s how it&#39;s done.<br/>
<br/>
Living rurally doesn&#39;t mean you live in a vacuum.  Nature is all around<br/>
and can lead to all kinds of things.  TV, movies, drives, stores, all of<br/>
those things can be jumping off places of more discovery about the<br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Really look at your kids and see what they really like doing right now,<br/>
here today, and expand on that.  If they like to sit and color in<br/>
coloring books, find more things to do with crayons, or different<br/>
coloring utinsels, or make stained glass paper art, or use blank paper<br/>
instead for a change, then see what else you can do with blank paper,<br/>
cut it, fold it, burn it, whatever, etc. etc.  If that feels<br/>
overwhelming, maybe your not a crafty person, make all those things<br/>
handy and available and let the kids at it whenever they want.<br/>
<br/>
Every family and every person in that family will have things they like<br/>
to do, even if they live in the middle of nowhere, and they will find<br/>
ways to do them.  An unschooling parent&#39;s job is to help kids get what<br/>
they want and need and explore and expand on that.  Every kid is going<br/>
to have a different set of wants and needs, some easier attained than<br/>
others, but really everything is possible if you really set your mind to<br/>
it.  Even if it never happens, it&#39;s the attitude that makes it or breaks<br/>
it.  You really have to have that &quot;can do&quot; attitude!</div>

don&#39;t understand that *kids* can do all the things they see or read<br/>

enjoy the finished piece, and I like doing it anyway, so I finish it<br/>
for them (I&#39;ll ask if they want me to, and they always say, &quot;yes&quot; - if<br/>
it&#39;s something they CAN do, they usually do it just fine to<br/>
completion.) It&#39;s the other stuff that I can&#39;t do as easily, like<br/>
guitar lessons or tai kwan doe.<br/>

wondered if organized classes or sports, etc. at an early age will do<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m taking out 2 things from this post because there is something here<br/>
that could hinder the process of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
All this talk is about a finished product, the finished product of a kid<br/>
growing up with an aquired skill, the finished craft project, that leads<br/>
to the finished product.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t as much about a finished product.  It&#39;s about a<br/>
process.  Doing crafty projects can result in something finished, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to, it can be open ended with no finishing of any kind. <br/>
Sometimes just having lots of things available with no specific project<br/>
in mind will lead to some creative doing.<br/>
<br/>
Kids needing to do organized activities early is about creating a<br/>
finished product of a person that is well trained to do something<br/>
specific.  I&#39;m thinking about competitive sports here or highly<br/>
competent musicians and child prodigies.  I think many of these<br/>
individuals, while remarkable, aren&#39;t driving their own life to make<br/>
themselves this way.  I think there are a lot of driven parents that<br/>
want their kids to &quot;succeed&quot;.  At some point in that journey there has<br/>
to be a certain amount of drive and talent in the child that is pushed.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that, what I want for my kids is to enjoy their lives and<br/>
what they are doing.  If they end up doing something really remarkable,<br/>
then that&#39;s really cool, but it isn&#39;t what my goal is as a parent.  My<br/>
goal is to help my kids achieve what they want.  If they have absolutely<br/>
no interest in anything remarkably huge and significant in worldly<br/>
standards, then I wouldn&#39;t push them.<br/>
<br/>
Exposing kids to lots of intersting things is different than becoming<br/>
accomplished in lots of interesting things.  I want my kids to reach<br/>
adult hood happily doing something that they like to do.  The best way<br/>
that I know how to do that, is to allow them to do what they want to do<br/>
right now that interests them and makes them happy.<br/>
<br/>
A very young child may not know that tap dancing exists, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
mean that we have to make sure they know of it&#39;s existence.  It will<br/>
come up eventually, and if not, then it really isn&#39;t relevant to their<br/>
lives.  My feeling is to relax and enjoy the small play and exploration<br/>
and add to it, because one day they WILL want more and you will have to<br/>
find a way to provide it and it&#39;s bigger and more time consuming and<br/>
often more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Kids aren&#39;t empty vessels waiting to be filled, they are people that<br/>
will naturally lean towards what their natural talents and abilities<br/>
are.  Anything else in their lives will be peripheral, cool maybe,<br/>
interesting maybe, but not lasting.</div>

If you think they won&#39;t know what tap dancing is, watch some Shirley  <br/>
Temple movies.  You don&#39;t need to sit down as a family and watch  <br/>
them.  YOU watch them.  When there&#39;s a cool dance scene, pause it and  <br/>
show whichever kid is nearly.<br/>
<br/>
Or go to YouTube.  There are undoubtedly tapdance things there.   <br/>

around.  Things will lead to other things.<br/>

&gt; missed out on so many things I would have enjoyed, and it&#39;s too late<br/>
&gt; to go back to do them, even though to some extent some day I may be<br/>
&gt; able to enjoy certain elements of these activities, I now have a<br/>
&gt; family of my own which is my priority, and that takes precedence. So<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll never get to enjoy those sports or possibly dance or what-not as<br/>
&gt; a kid. I don&#39;t want my kids to say, &quot;How come you never told me I<br/>
&gt; could do that?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not trying to fill up their day, or even their lives. I KNOW they<br/>
&gt; have plenty to do and will find plenty to do on their own. My question<br/>
&gt; is how to I expose them to things they may not know are available to<br/>
&gt; them, and if they want to join in an organized activity, vs. just<br/>
&gt; playing in the backyard, is that something that will promote open<br/>
&gt; learning, or hinder it?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>School boxes in many kids because most kids don&#39;t have a choice about being <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak for common agreement amongst unschoolers, just for myself. My <br/>
thoughts on this are that it depends on the individual child&#39;s temperament <br/>
and on the authenticity of the free choice in engaging in the activity. I <br/>
mean are they doing it, or staying in it, to please someone else or gain <br/>
someone else&#39;s approval, however subtle?<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s activities are totally self chosen. She can leave anything as soon as <br/>
she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
She has in the distant past had what I would call a negative internal <br/>
reaction to being in a formal class (swimming lessons). This made me very <br/>
cautious about what I would offer in terms of the structure of the activity. <br/>
Now she is much more able to tell me if she is considering something.<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely do not believe that she needs classes or structure for any of <br/>
her *current* passions. Other than the gentle improv based modern dance <br/>
which she does because of affection for the teacher and her classmates, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t do any organized things right now - by her own choice. If that dance <br/>
class collapsed, she might or might not want me to find an alternative, and <br/>
everything would depend on how the teacher is.<br/>
<br/>
The older and more mature Jayn gets (9 in 3 weeks) the stronger her sense of <br/>
self is, the less she would permit any class or organized activity to box <br/>
her in or change who she is. I don&#39;t have any fear of that happening now <br/>
even though I would have been somewhat worried when she was 4 or 5. However <br/>
she had no desire to be separated from me at that time, so it was actually <br/>
rather easy to make or find fun activities for us to be at together.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, right, but, why can&#39;t you do those things now?  When I was a kid I<br/>
really wanted dance classes but didn&#39;t get them until I was in high<br/>
school, but I went to college and got a degree in dance.  It didn&#39;t stop<br/>
me from exploring dance.  I didn&#39;t get to own a horse either, which is<br/>
something I wanted as well, but I didn&#39;t get to travel in outer space<br/>
either and I thought that would be cool too.<br/>
<br/>
If you never tell a kid they Can&#39;t do something then, they may never<br/>
realize they can&#39;t.  If you help them get whatever it is they DO want<br/>
right now, they will grow up feeling full and happy with their choices. <br/>
It sounds like you grew up feeling a huge lack of opportunity and that<br/>
perhaps you missed out on things.  BUT you are still alive and kickin,<br/>
so I imagine you can still do stuff you want to do.  Life doesn&#39;t end<br/>
for an adult when they have kids, nor should it, far from it really! <br/>
You should be doing stuff and inspiring your kids to do stuff and doing<br/>
stuff with your kids and letting your kids inspire new ideas to do and<br/>
explore with you!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646388801">-=-Yes, in the same sense that one can &quot;predict&quot; that schools will tend<br/>
to shut down a child&#39;s natural curiosity and drive for learning, I<br/>
wondered if organized classes or sports, etc. at an early age will do<br/>
so as well, or if instead it seems to be a positive place to learn,<br/>
for most kids-=-<br/>
<br/>
The reason school shuts kids down is that they are there against  <br/>
their will.<br/>
<br/>
If children are in classes or sports against their will, the same  <br/>
thing will happen.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t talk about &quot;most kids.&quot;  The list is for talking about  <br/>
unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
So the question is this:  Will an unschooled kid find sports to be  <br/>
positive?  I&#39;ve seen many do so<br/>
<br/>
Will unschoolers find organized classes a positive place to learn?   <br/>
It depends on the kid and the class.  We can&#39;t even say that dance  <br/>
classes are more positive than photography classes, because each case  <br/>
will have to do with what that child likes, wants and needs and what  <br/>
the teacher is like.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m not asking you to predict if my child will enjoy it, but  <br/>
rather if the common agreement among unschoolers is that these things  <br/>
don&#39;t seem to box a child in as much as a public school classroom  <br/>
might.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Where would the common agreement be on record?  We don&#39;t vote on what  <br/>
is common agreement, and if 90% of some group of unschoolers said yes  <br/>
or no about something, it doesn&#39;t mean that one of the remaining nine  <br/>
might not make a statement that swayed everyone&#39;s point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t look for rules or consensus.  Look at the principles by which  <br/>
you want to live.  Do you want your child to have choices?  That&#39;s  <br/>
how you don&#39;t box a child in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533777209">When/If I hear about an opportunity for my kids, I&#39;ll consider my<br/>
ability/willingness to make it happen for her.  Most likely I&#39;m willing and<br/>
able to take her, get her the required equipment etc.  Then I bring it up<br/>
with her and ask her if she wants to do it.  Sometimes she says yes, lately<br/>
the answer has been no.  She declined to try a ballet class this fall, but I<br/>
may bring it up and ask her again in January when the new session starts and<br/>
see if she feels like it then.<br/>
<br/>
I personally like the slightly less organized activities, like weekly story<br/>
times at the library.  We can choose to go (or not) each week without<br/>
worrying about missing anything critical.  Those also work well because both<br/>
my kids can attend.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-865018651"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I actually find crafting very easy, to the point were I&#39;m afraid<br/>
&gt; they&#39;ll get tired of crafts. But I&#39;m always doing stuff because *I*<br/>
&gt; want to try it. Most of the time, when they see an idea, I&#39;ll end up<br/>
&gt; finishing because they get bored or it&#39;s a skill they haven&#39;t mastered<br/>
&gt; completely, yet. I&#39;d leave the project undone, but I know they want to<br/>
&gt; enjoy the finished piece, and I like doing it anyway, so I finish it<br/>
&gt; for them (I&#39;ll ask if they want me to, and they always say, &quot;yes&quot; - if<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s something they CAN do, they usually do it just fine to<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You sound very project focused.  That is one way to do arts and<br/>
crafts, but I know it isn&#39;t the one that works best with my 5 year<br/>
old.  We have a nice big (permanent) art table with LOTS of things for<br/>
her to work with all the time.  We still do projects sometimes (tried<br/>
soap carving recently - very fun) but most of the arts and crafts that<br/>
she does is at her table.  As you said your kids get bored and don&#39;t<br/>
finish it most of the time, I thought maybe the project thing isn&#39;t<br/>
working that well for them.  Perhaps a different approach would be<br/>
more enjoyable for them.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is something that I have been concerned about as well.  Some<br/>
teachers treat children in a way that I do not like.  I think that<br/>
when she is older it won&#39;t be as much of a problem, but it is<br/>
something that I pay a lot of attention to now as it is hard to stand<br/>
up to a teacher when you are 5.<br/>
<br/>
An example:  her first swim lesson was a private lesson.  My daughter<br/>
loves swimming and was excited about the lesson, but the teacher had<br/>
her in tears within 5 minutes.  No empathy and telling her to use her<br/>
words and ignoring the tears.  My daughter is VERY good at explaining<br/>
how she feels so she had to be really upset for this to happen. (I<br/>
went over as soon as I saw that she was crying, but her back was to me<br/>
so it took a minute)  I went over and invited her to come out of the<br/>
pool.  After a very wet hug and some snuggles I had a talk with the<br/>
teacher.  Rebecca did want to keep going so we finished the lesson and<br/>
the teacher was nice and didn&#39;t push her this time.  Some classes<br/>
don&#39;t let you be in the room to watch and you can&#39;t be there for your<br/>
kid to help if something like that happens.  I don&#39;t like those<br/>
classes.<br/>
<br/>
As for choosing classes, I have looked at her and what she does and<br/>
thought about what she might like.  I tell her about it and if she is<br/>
interested, we can give it a try.  The local gymnastics classes offer<br/>
a free trial class.  Other places do as well.  You may be able to go<br/>
watch a class or ask if you can pay for one class and then decide<br/>
after that.  Parks and Rec classes and teams are less likely to do<br/>
that as there is a spot that fills up... but perhaps on Saturdays you<br/>
can drive by the fields and watch a game for a few minutes every few<br/>
months - whatever is in season.  I&#39;ve been thinking about taking the<br/>
kids to high school games, too.  I think it might be fun to watch.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t do any classes at all until she was 4.5.  We tried story<br/>
time at the library and I just didn&#39;t think she would be all that<br/>
interested in a structured activity based on our experience there.<br/>
I&#39;ve done some mommy and me classes with my son (he wanted to do<br/>
gymnastics too) and they did really want him to sit and listen a lot<br/>
more than he wanted to, but since the moms are there they leave the<br/>
&#39;discipline&#39; to the moms so it worked out fairly well.  He enjoyed<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also stayed away from classes like art b/c we can do it at home<br/>
and I don&#39;t want an art teacher telling my daughter that only a<br/>
certain way is right.  I&#39;m worried about it boxing her in and<br/>
curtailing her creativity.  I&#39;ve also been wary of sports teams...<br/>
competitiveness can bring out a very unpleasant, aggressive negative<br/>
streak in some coaches.  If she wanted to be on a team, I would<br/>
probably see if my husband or I could try coaching (you don&#39;t have to<br/>
be that skilled when they are 5 :)<br/>
<br/>
At this point classes aren&#39;t a huge part of what we do, but she has<br/>
tried gymnastics, dance, swimming and soccer.  She wants another swim<br/>
class so we are starting that in a couple weeks.  She has been asking<br/>
for dance, but in her dance camp she was sobbing almost every day (but<br/>
still wanted to go - 5 day camp, 90 min classes) and the teacher<br/>
didn&#39;t want me in the class.... she wants to go back and I really<br/>
don&#39;t think it is a good idea given how hard things were last time.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate - that is how classes have worked around our house so far :)<br/>
