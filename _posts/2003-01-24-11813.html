<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665502674">I&#39;ve been criticized twice in one day.  One for having an opinion about <br/>
religion and suicide at www.unschooling.com, and the other for answering <br/>
someone&#39;s question about how we homeschool (asked to a whole list) on the New <br/>
Mexico list.  <br/>
<br/>
Rough day.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought maybe my confidence makes people feel uncomfortable.  Maybe I <br/>
should list some doubts and fears.<br/>
<br/>
So here are some doubts and fears I still have. <br/>
I left out &quot;might never read&quot; because I got over that one years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;m afraid my kids will resent not having school stories to tell.<br/>
No prom, no team sports, no horrible teacher tales.<br/>
<br/>
I wish they had had the opportunity to be in school band or orchestra or <br/>
chorus, which they WOULD have done if it had been a better choice than <br/>
another write-a-report class.<br/>
<br/>
I think of friends I still have from school, and realize I would never have <br/>
met them if I&#39;d been homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that Marty and Kirby will blame me forever for their handwriting <br/>
being scrawly printing.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Marty won&#39;t do well if he&#39;s on Jeopardy.<br/>
<br/>
Once in a while I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll get in trouble with the state, but then I <br/>
remember that all they&#39;ll do is notify me that I&#39;m not in compliance, and <br/>
then I&#39;ll just comply.<br/>
<br/>
I worry that I&#39;ll die and they&#39;ll have their peaceful unschooling disrupted.<br/>
<br/>
I worry that they&#39;ll think they&#39;re not as smart as kids who go to school are. <br/>
 They&#39;ll get over that eventually (if they get that feeling, as Marty once <br/>
had when the neighbors bugged him when he was six or so).  <br/>
<br/>
But they remind me not to worry, by knowing things I don&#39;t know.<br/>
I see things they&#39;ve written or hear snappy come-backs and I know they think <br/>
fast, and well.<br/>
<br/>
I got a book out of the library called Houses and Homes, a COOL kids&#39; book <br/>
with see-through pages, with stuff from prehistoric hunting camps to <br/>
Biosphere 2, with archeological stuff that&#39;s new in the past few years.   And <br/>
one of the big layouts is Sargon&#39;s Palace.  An Assyrian king I&#39;d never heard <br/>
of.  Marty said, &quot;Mom, are you serious?  You&#39;ve never heard of Sargon?  I&#39;m <br/>
ALL about that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if Marty and I are on Jeopardy and one of the items is about ancient <br/>
Assyrian cities or Sargon, Marty will win and I will stand like a deer in the <br/>
stagelights.<br/>

Unschoolers for suggesting that forcing a child to use a curriculum *might* not<br/>
be unschooling. Every single person on that list used coercian and did<br/>
school-at-home but called themselves unschoolers.<br/>
Then I got hate mail.<br/>
Now half of Virginia ain&#39;t speaking too me.<br/>
<br/>
You keep having an opinion m&#39;dear. It&#39;s good for the rest of us.<br/>
And if other people can&#39;t handle it, well tough titties on them ;-)<br/>

<br/>
My fears right now are that Brit will be made to feel bad, by my nincompoop<br/>
family or Wally&#39;s, that she doesn&#39;t read (much) and probably won&#39;t (much)<br/>
for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
And I worry sometimes about the state as well, because California is showing<br/>
signs of incipient silliness.<br/>

&gt;Rough day.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, Sandra.  I&#39;m sorry you had a rough day.  That sucks.  Maybe it&#39;ll help <br/>
(a wee bit) to know that I frequently send snips of your insightful and <br/>
wise writing to my husband, who thoroughly appreciates them and thinks <br/>
you&#39;re really smart (I agree), and that I shamelessly quote you a lot to a <br/>
friend of mine who is unschooling but gets assaulted by  doubters in her <br/>
life and then starts to have doubts herself.  She takes solace in and gets <br/>
reassurance from your words, too.<br/>
<br/>
I hope it helps a little to know that I think that what you say makes so <br/>
much sense to me that I have turned around in a lot of my thinking and my <br/>
son is enjoying his life a whole lot more now than he was a year ago at <br/>
this time when he was still enduring school.  (He was yakking on the phone <br/>
with a homeschooling friend of his today, and he said, &quot;I&#39;m feeling a <br/>
little sick today.  It&#39;s good to be feeling sick if you go to school, but <br/>
it&#39;s not so good when you&#39;re homeschooling.&quot;  Well, that about says it all, <br/>
no?)<br/>
<br/>
And, I hope it helps a little to know that it&#39;s good to know that other <br/>
folks who I consider to be &quot;there&quot; in the unschooling world are having <br/>
fears and some of the same fears and worries I have.  I ain&#39;t gonna let <br/>
those fears and worries run my life for sure; I&#39;m gonna let &#39;em go.  But, <br/>
there&#39;s a comfort to me in knowing I&#39;m having a common experience with <br/>
someone who I respect so much.  Well, I hope the knowledge that you are a <br/>
comfort to me is a little bit of a comfort to you!<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t ask me to say all that again; I&#39;m not sure I could!<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that happy and amusing thing about my kids too.  THEY HATE TO BE <br/>
SICK.<br/>

When I was a kid I thought being sick was a great blessing.   I could watch <br/>

school food. <br/>

THAT is sick!<br/>

REALLY wanting to stay home (probably to avoid a test or something like <br/>
that).  I knew I could *act* sick, but I thought if I could only get my <br/>
face to look sick.  So I put baby powder on my face thinking it would make <br/>
me look pale.  They saw right through it (no pun intended), and I had to <br/>
go.  Oh well.  At least I tried!<br/>

    I mostly lurk & learn &lt;BWWG&gt; but I just had to post to say think you.<br/>
Yes your confidence does show through. I love it! You have shaken me up a<br/>
few times. I&#39;ve changed my thinking which has changed thing around here for<br/>
me and my boys for the better. We are happier and movin&#39; right along. Thank<br/>
you for being there and thank you for posting those fears too. I think about<br/>
what ifs sometime and start to worry. Then one of my boys does or says<br/>
something and it&#39;s all gone. *or* I read something on list. Then I put it<br/>
out of my mind. I haven&#39;t caught up on dotcom but I *really* appreciate your<br/>
cander and spirit. I left a long time list last week (don&#39;t have the time<br/>
for all) and now see a few from there joining (dotcom). You help a lot of<br/>
people out here. <br/>
    When I left I just couldn&#39;t quitly leave. I told them that they were<br/>
basicly all eclectic and the list wasn&#39;t unschooling or challenging me<br/>
enough. You watch I bet someone from there will change and turn around their<br/>
thinking. Even without ever meeting you. ;-) Please don&#39;t change a think.<br/>

tall Brit and her husband, Patrick (big belly and grey beard) will take the <br/>
boys. Gillian teaches, but is a HUGE John Holt follower. She&#39;s still trying <br/>
to &quot;convert&quot; all the schools to be non-coersive. She KNOWS it won&#39;t work (but <br/>
then what was her doctorate for?).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they&#39;ve agreed to be &quot;UNparents&quot; and continue to unschool the boys if <br/>
Ben and I kick the bucket together. And that&#39;s how they&#39;re introduced---as <br/>
the boys&#39; UNparents. They totally understand our philosophy and agree to <br/>
allow the boys total freedom of education and choice. It&#39;s in our new wills <br/>
with a trust fund set up for the boys.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s doable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140424736">I went to school for 16+ years and got mostly A&#39;s, but I still feel dumb sometimes.  AND I know I am ignorant of many things that were supposedly taught to me in school.<br/>
<br/>
In college organic chemistry, first term I got a B.  This was really scary, because I did not get it at all.  It was graded on a curve.  Second term, I got a D, because I was already lost going into it from first term.  The D still earned me &quot;credit&quot; for the course, which enabled me to move on to organic chemistry where I was clueless from the get go.  Managed to eke through with another B and D though.  That all seems really dumb to me!  Even with those two D&#39;s my final grade point was 3.7 or something like that.  One more thing, the folks in my program who graduated with C averages found jobs just as easily as those with the A&#39;s and B&#39;s.<br/>

reassuring her that we were all gonna be fine, we started talking <br/>

I think about this too.  I believe that my DH would somehow make it work but <br/>
if something happened to the both of us I am not sure what would happen.  I <br/>
have no one close to me that would even consider looking at unschooling or <br/>
even homeschooling for that matter.  But we are never apart.  There is never <br/>
a time that the two of us are alone, without the boys.<br/>

 Ben and I kick the bucket together. And that&#39;s how they&#39;re introduced---as <br/>
 the boys&#39; UNparents. They totally understand our philosophy and agree to <br/>
 allow the boys total freedom of education and choice. It&#39;s in our new wills <br/>
 with a trust fund set up for the boys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not so worried if Mark and I died at the same time. My sis would take <br/>
them and she is really into non-spanking/non-coercive/eclectic homeschooling. <br/>
She&#39;s ALMOST a total, radical unschooler....I&#39;m workin on her. <br/>
She has also said that if anything happened and she got our kids, she <br/>
wouldn&#39;t foist any curriculum on them, ever.<br/>
It&#39;s if I died that I worry. Mark would revert to his structured methods I am <br/>
quite sure. AND he&#39;d put them in school. Mainly because I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be <br/>
creative enough to think of a way to keep them out.<br/>
At least he wouldn&#39;t torture them over their grades or anything.<br/>
AND he&#39;d honor any of their interests...he&#39;s enough of a rebel to give them <br/>
advice like &quot;don&#39;t go to a music teacher that won&#39;t let you play the kind of <br/>
music YOU like&quot; and such.<br/>
