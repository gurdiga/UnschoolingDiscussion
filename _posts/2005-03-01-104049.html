Hey, is this like &quot;flammable&quot; and &quot;inflammable&quot;?<br/>
 <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t unlimitless be the opposite of limitless?<br/>

<br/>
This word is a play on words, just like that of the play on words we<br/>
utilize when &quot;labeling&quot; children with things such as ADD, autism, etc.<br/>
Therefore this is the reasoning behind the word unlimitless.<br/>
<br/>
If you read Chapter Twelve in my book on Labels, maybe this will clear<br/>
the confusion!:)<br/>

There will be a few people who won&#39;t get to chapter twelve because they don&#39;t <br/>
want to read something &quot;unlimitless.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The problem with making up words of operational parts is that the parts have <br/>
meanings, and &quot;un&quot; negates.  So &quot;unlimitless&quot; (regardless of what it the <br/>
author hoped others would think it would mean) means limited.<br/>
<br/>
Flammable and inflammable aren&#39;t errors, they&#39;re words that came from two <br/>
different uses (the verb &quot;to inflame&quot; and the prefix &quot;flam-&quot;) in two different <br/>
contexts.    When I was doing document preparation years ago for archeologists, <br/>
it bothered me that what normal humans call shards of pottery, they call <br/>
&quot;sherds.&quot;  It took me a while to enter that word right and not shudder.  They&#39;re <br/>
related words, but not used by the same groups for the same purposes.   (Shards <br/>
go in the trash, and sherds are numbered and put in drawers in museums, I <br/>
finally told myself to feel better about it.)<br/>
<br/>
Some people are not as sensitive about language as others, not as careful, <br/>
not as excited about how wonderful it can be.  <br/>

<br/>
=========<br/>
 <br/>
Probably so!<br/>
 <br/>
English, in England, hundreds of years ago, was three different dialects,  <br/>
and some words have remained from those days so that we have two versions of a  <br/>
word that came from Germanic (probably) and both were retained.  Then the  <br/>
U.S. was populated with people from one linguistic English area in the south,  <br/>
and a different one in the north, so the U.S. has vocabulary clashes sometimes  <br/>
too (because England did).  It&#39;s a joyous mess. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
 <br/>
Not an unlimitless mess, though.<br/>
