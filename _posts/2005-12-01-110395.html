<div id="ygrps-yiv-156031745">Thanks everyone :)<br/>
<br/>
Reading everyone&#39;s responses has helped me be more<br/>
aware of the very distinct difference between a<br/>
consequence and a punishment. It was easy for me to<br/>
fall into the fake natural consequence crap, not so<br/>
easy to do anymore *BWG*<br/>
The cushions suggestion is a really good one.<br/>
Definitely something I can do, as well as the reminder<br/>
to be a calm presence as opposed to an anxious one.<br/>
(Thank you Deb and Su)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe you could tell them next time that you&#39;re being<br/>
supremely <br/>
selfish, <br/>
because you want to have kids who will love you for<br/>
life and do things <br/>
for your <br/>
grandchildren and be generous with you and others,<br/>
rather than kids who <br/>
learn to <br/>
leave home at 18 and hardly look back. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOVE that :) SO fantastic :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone :)<br/>
<br/>
