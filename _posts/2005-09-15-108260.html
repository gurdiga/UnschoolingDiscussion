<div id="ygrps-yiv-1585460374">&quot;Do you think unschooling is more or less stressful than not<br/>
homeschooling in any way, just sending your kids to school?&quot;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we thought unschooling was more stressful, why on earth would we <br/>
be doing it? Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
If sending my kids to school was less stressful, I&#39;d do it! <br/>
<br/>
Think about it though, by the time children are school age, they&#39;re <br/>
just getting &quot;easier&quot; as far as all the messes and high need for <br/>
Mom&#39;s attention. If you&#39;re happy having them home as babies and <br/>
toddlers, why would you have less stress by sending them away at age <br/>
5?<br/>
<br/>
To me, school causes all kinds of new stresses that unschooling <br/>
families don&#39;t deal with. Putting children into a peer situation <br/>
other than their family, creates separation and social situations <br/>
children shouldn&#39;t have to deal with. The negativity a child deals <br/>
with in school spills over to home, the schoolwork invades family <br/>
life even further...school causes families to separate, not get <br/>
closer!<br/>
<br/>
Then you can factor in living by an institution&#39;s schedule, <br/>
transportation and not having the freedom to travel when you <br/>
choose...sounds like a whole load of stress I&#39;d rather avoid. Not to <br/>
mention the stress the child deals with if they don&#39;t want to be <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
LIFE has stresses. Living the unschooling life does not shield me <br/>
from reality. But at least our reality is what we choose, not what <br/>
society decided to dish out. Our lives are pretty stress free <br/>
overall. Unschooling has a lot to do with that....a LOT.<br/>
