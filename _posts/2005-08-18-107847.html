<div id="ygrps-yiv-25145377">I know that there are all kinds of issues around this and I do <br/>
sympathize with your situation and I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d handle it if <br/>
my kid wanted to go, but sometimes I&#39;m surprised that more <br/>
homeschooled kids don&#39;t want to at least see what it&#39;s like since <br/>
there&#39;s soooo much reference to school in our culture and society... <br/>
My son Nick has never evinced any interest in going, I think because <br/>
he loves being master of his own time...<br/>

channel) make it look sooooo fun. And if there is a slight problem it<br/>
is solved in 30 minutes and happily ever after.<br/>
