BTW Holly, I thought that was a great article, too.  You know, they <br/>
always have to counter EVERY homeschool article with some less than <br/>
enlightened school administrator - fortunately for the reporters, they <br/>
are very easy to find. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
We were interviewed for TV, once, for a weekly parenting segment, a few years <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
The night it was to have come out, something else was there.  The next week, <br/>
something else.  I called and they said they might use it somewhere else.  <br/>
Finally it showed, on another night (I guess they were saving it for a night <br/>
without a car wreck or a stabbing).<br/>
<br/>
I though our parts were really pretty good!  But what they had been stalling <br/>
about, I guess, was &quot;balancing&quot; it.  So there were two inserted pieces where <br/>
they had gone to the office of some education professor at the university of <br/>
New Mexico, and in her dark office at her cluttery desk, probably without having <br/>
seen the footage of us at all, she made two damning pronouncements:<br/>
1. homeschoolers won&#39;t get to socalize with other kids<br/>
2. homeschooled children are limited to  the knowledge their parents have<br/>
<br/>
THAT&#39;s the crap that needed a rebuttal, but all in all she had a PhD and I&#39;m <br/>
&quot;just a housewife.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of people I know (not homeschoolers) saw it and said so.  We taped <br/>
it, but accidently erased it one day, which was a little sad, but not TOO sad.  <br/>
The ignorance of the professor was the really sad part.  SHE needed to <br/>
socialize with some people who weren&#39;t education-bound, and maybe to get some <br/>
knowledge other than what her journals were providing (if she even reads journals).<br/>

Houston Press didn&#39;t give it to me.  I expected the union lady.  <br/>
She&#39;s the one all the press in Houston go to because, unlike the <br/>
school district officials, she can be mean and lie. <br/>
