    Yes I think I do know what you mean. After all these year it really<br/>
quite cool to share the wonder of discovery with all my children. Whatever<br/>
that may be.<br/>
<br/>
    Michael reads a lot and he is a very private person. I feel religion and<br/>
beliefs are very personal. I do know, from our conversations, that he&#39;s not<br/>
doing anything more organized than finding his own beliefs. He&#39;s just<br/>
recently got his drivers license and he spend all his limited, because of<br/>
college and his choices, spare time with friends on the weekend. I hope he<br/>
does find what he is looking for. Whether it is my held belief or not. He&#39;s<br/>
the only one that knows his heart.<br/>
<br/>
    You asked someone else if they would go to different rituals. Well I&#39;d<br/>
feel honored to join in something so personal and intimate. I hope my<br/>
children continue to trust and share with me all these thing they discover<br/>
fascinating and that speaks to their heart.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just don&#39;t see how you can have this faith that they don&#39;t need &quot;fixing&quot;<br/>
&gt; (and I agree!) and reconcile it with original sin.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not trying to be challenging, I&#39;m honestly asking about something I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t understand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>    The way I see this is that I really don&#39;t have much to do with it. God<br/>
is the only one that can speak to our hearts. It&#39;s a personal relationship.<br/>
I can explain my faith in the ways I beleive but my children have to make up<br/>
their own mind. I&#39;ve seen, myself included, and heard of too many children<br/>
turning their back to their parents religion and beliefs. I no longer<br/>
practice in a church. Way to segregated and legalistic for me. I tryed as an<br/>
adult but still didn&#39;t find what I was looking for. I&#39;m much happier with<br/>
Christ and my beleifs being a personal relationship and leaving it as that.<br/>
I hope that may have answered you question even though it wasn&#39;t really<br/>
directed at me.<br/>
