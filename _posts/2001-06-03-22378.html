&lt;&lt; You know, at least a part of me is pulling for the kids.  The older sister<br/>
 is 16, not exactly a baby and they are obviously able to take care of<br/>
 themselves.   Do any of you have any idea how traumatic it is to have a<br/>
 police force insert themselves into your live when you have not asked for it<br/>
 and do not desire their &#39;help&#39;?  Take my word for it, no matter how this<br/>
 ends, it will never end for these children.  They will have this event as a<br/>
 turning point for their entire lives.<br/>
 <br/>
 &lt;sigh&gt;  No easy answers.  Here&#39;s hoping the kids manage to not make their<br/>
 circumstances so bad in the eyes of some authority person that this haunts<br/>
 them for the rest of their lives AND that no one is seriously injured<br/>
 (family under &#39;siege, law enforcement OR neighbors)!<br/>

   In a way yes I agree,leave them alone. But letting 20 some dogs go on <br/>
someone is  not acceptable conduct. they were also reportedly eating lilly <br/>
pads (or something) and pond water soup. These people need help. Then again <br/>
let them live like this and suffer the consequences. Then that may lead to <br/>
hospitalization which leads to medicade and tax money. All b/c they didn&#39;t <br/>
seek help sooner or learn to live differently.<br/>
<br/>
   Seems to me a family living like that (if it is true) needs help. No one <br/>
in their right mind has such a large pack of dogs and lets them run as a pack <br/>
and hunt their own food. Something is wrong here folks.<br/>
<br/>
   I am all for living off the grid if someone so chooses but, do it wisely <br/>
and responsibly. Truely learn to live.<br/>
