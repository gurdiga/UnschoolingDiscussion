<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659839457">Speaking of wands!!!  I ordered Ethan a great wizard wand from the wand <br/>
shop.  www.thewandshop.com  They have a picture that your child can click on <br/>
and you get a custom wand made just for them!  Ethan&#39;s had a dragon wisker <br/>
in his and came in a felt scabbard!  Ooooh Ahhhhh! LOL  The prices are <br/>
great, considering they are handmade.  Anywhere from cheap to big bucks! :)<br/>
<br/>
If nothing else, there&#39;s a lot of great info on the site if you have a young <br/>
wizard at heart.  Fairy wands, wizard staves, cloaks, scabbards for the <br/>
wands, wizard lesson kits, quill and ink sets, the list is endless!  Great <br/>
fun!<br/>
