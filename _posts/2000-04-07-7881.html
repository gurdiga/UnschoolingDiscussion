<div id="ygrps-yiv-847256843">With all due respect to the wonderful LLL leaders on this list, I think posts <br/>
such as the ones I&#39;ve read give LLL a bad name. If women have a view on <br/>
breastfeeding, I think it is important to state that it is your own opinion <br/>
and not related to La Leche League&#39;s views. Some women come on stronger than <br/>
others and I don&#39;t think it honestly reflects the true mission of LLL. And <br/>
since this probably should be a private discussion, I&#39;d be happy to <br/>
correspond privately.<br/>
