sampler style quilt, with each mom who wanted to participate contributing a<br/>
block out of the same set of fabrics.<br/>
<br/>
It was a great project, because we had  5 or 6 moms working together at<br/>
several sewing parties.  I was new to the group, and this gave me a great<br/>
chance to get to know the other (sewing) moms better.  We did encourage and<br/>
coach non-sewers who wanted to participate.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1853870584">I&#39;m also a lurker and a quilter.  I made my first quilt 21 years ago when I <br/>
was expecting child #1 since then I&#39;ve made mostly baby quilts and have <br/>
given most of those away - unless they were for child #2 & 3!!  In the past <br/>
couple of years I found a list for quilters, got involved in that and the <br/>
next thing I knew I was making more and more quilts.  In the past 2 years <br/>
I&#39;ve put together 4 charity quilts and an almost full size quilt for my dd <br/>
for her very blahhhh dorm room and I&#39;m in the process of handquilting an <br/>
Amish style quilt for ds #1.  Should have that finished in a couple of <br/>
months!<br/>
<br/>
Terri, I found your comments about the quilt guild your MIL attends very <br/>
interesting.  I just starting attending a local guild and most everyone <br/>
there machine quilts.... they just put together so many tops that there <br/>
isn&#39;t enough time to hand quilt them.  In fact at least 2 of the members are <br/>
professional long-arm machine quilters.  I guess they&#39;d never fit in with <br/>
your MIL&#39;s group!!<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think they both have a place.  Machine quilting is beautiful, <br/>
accepted by the judges at most shows and is quick!  Hand quilting has <br/>
history and there are some quilts that just &quot;need&quot; to be hand quilted.<br/>
<br/>
I love all kinds of designs, too.  Like I said the one I&#39;m making right now <br/>
is a traditional style design.  The one I made for ds was a little newer, <br/>
geometric design.  And then I have the Maple Leaf blocks calling my name in <br/>
my sewing room - they seem to want me to put them together into one quilt!  <br/>
LOL!!  And the ones I&#39;ve been enjoying lately are the watercolor designs.  <br/>
I&#39;ve tried a block-of the month of one of those and just loved the look!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now it&#39;s my turn to apologize.  I got a little carried away, but this <br/>
is my passion - next to my kids and I can spend hours playing with fabric!!!<br/>
<br/>
In fact, ds #2 (13 yo) wants to make a quilt this summer.  I love the idea <br/>
but have wayyyyyy too many patterns to choose from.  I don&#39;t want him to get <br/>
bored by doing the same pattern over and over but I want it to be fairly <br/>
quick - something we can actually complete this summer!!  Any <br/>
suggestions????<br/>
<br/>
I have a ton! of novelty prints and was thinking of an I Spy type of quilt, <br/>
but I don&#39;t know if I have enough patterns he&#39;d enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
TIA for the ideas!<br/>
Jeanmarie<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dear Jeanmarie<br/>
Let him choose! Or make up his own! Only make one or<br/>
four blocks and strip piece the rest of it by machine.<br/>
Like a giant log cabin.  Then machine quilt only the<br/>
corners and tie the middle.  That way he can finish it<br/>
in one summer, won&#39;t take over your sewing area all of<br/>
the time, and learns lots of techniques as well as<br/>
mostly creates it himself.  If he begins to loose<br/>
interest, make the strips wider and tie the whole<br/>
thing. Use the thickest batting you can find for<br/>
tieing, then it is more comforter like, and any<br/>
&quot;mistakes&quot; (like gathered seams) don&#39;t really show up.<br/>
They usually look like part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun.......let HIM choose his colors.  He may<br/>
surprise you!<br/>
