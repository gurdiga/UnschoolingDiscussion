<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In Iowa,  huh?  But just for scholarship purposes?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Full scholarship.  The music department wanted to be sure they had us before<br/>
they forked out the money.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; How sad for the kids, at 17 or 18, to be fored to declare before they could<br/>
&gt; check out the things they had never heard of.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was possible to not declare a major, but it made it harder to get any<br/>
courses you really wanted to take.  Smart people with no monetary<br/>
obligations changed majors every semester or year -- that way they got<br/>
priority for the handful of classes they wanted, and in the end, they<br/>
declared a General Studies major or something and got a degree.  People who<br/>
learned to play the game!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope they weren&#39;t making it too horribly difficult to change majors.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simple form to change.  But that&#39;s why my BA is in music -- if I had changed<br/>
majors, I would have lost my scholarship.  That was the difficult part of<br/>
the decision.<br/>
