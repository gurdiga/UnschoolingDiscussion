<div id="ygrps-yiv-273394246">You intelligent people crack me up!<br/>
How much time can be wasted insanely arguing back and forth <br/>
with a bunch of us trying to have decent discussions.<br/>
Get each others private emails and email your arguments to each other, would <br/>
you?<br/>
I am not wanting &quot;to hear about it&quot; really.  (I only get the emails in <br/>
groups, not individually..)<br/>
<br/>
I like the stimulating conversations that engage us all.<br/>
Have you ever heard your neighbors yelling outside at each other and wished <br/>
they&#39;d keep it private?<br/>
That is how it feels here, IN MY OPINION!<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s start talking about something new!<br/>
<br/>
New Topic:<br/>
<br/>
** unschooling ideas for historical interests of 9 yr. old boys.<br/>
Any ideas or stories are welcomed.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I live in Iowa.  Are you all aware of the Underground Railroad being <br/>
prominent here in our state?  I just recently learned about this.  Very <br/>
fasinating!  Even went to a house/museum and toured it.<br/>
<br/>
How about Hoyt Sherman?  Any one ever hear of him?  His mansion is set up <br/>
here in Des Moines and has a fasinating story of women in Iowa in the late <br/>
1800s wanting to get away from the prarie talk and more into prestigious <br/>
topics from their lives back east, including the art and paintings.  It ends <br/>
up now, 100 yrs. later, the women still hold on to his home and have millions <br/>
of dollars of art in it.<br/>
It is awesome.  I just heard of it and toured it this summer.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s chat!<br/>

something specific he&#39;s interested in historically or are you just <br/>
trying to find ways to get him into history?<br/>
<br/>
I have a 9 year old daughter, and historical sites tend to bore her.  <br/>
We recently went to Boston and started doing the Freedom Trail.  We&#39;d <br/>
see a few sites and she said stuff like, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s nice. Uh-huh, <br/>
when is this going to be over...&quot;  So we ditched the freedom trail <br/>
and went to Chinatown. :) She does like some historical fiction, <br/>
though.  American Girls, My America, Dear America, among others.  <br/>

       I had to laugh at this. We traveled the Freedom Trail last summer, 100 <br/>
degrees plus humidity. My daughter said that if she had to look at one more <br/>
smelly, old church that she&#39;d scream. Part of the trail went through the <br/>
Italian North End; that was fascinating. Old Ironsides was a hit too. <br/>
       We&#39;re going back to Boston in September. How was Chinatown? We thought <br/>
about taking the Duck Tours. The people on them looked as if they were having <br/>
fun. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe we&#39;ll do the other half of the Freedom Trail next time we go <br/>
back.  We didn&#39;t see Old Ironsides either.  <br/>
<br/>
Chinatown was fun.  We ate at a restaurant and bought cookies at a <br/>
bakery.  The cookies were no good! lol  It&#39;s the first Chinatown I&#39;ve <br/>
ever been to.  My brother said that it&#39;s not as nice as some <br/>
Chinatowns.  <br/>
<br/>
Any other recommendations for Boston?  We&#39;ll be going back too since <br/>
my brother lives there.  We just take our sleeping bags and camp out <br/>
in his livingroom! <br/>
<br/>
We did a whale watch which was fun.  That was a good experience for <br/>
my daughter especially.  She was under the impression the boat would <br/>
take us to this place where the whales lived and they would be <br/>
jumping all over the place putting on a little show for us!  She <br/>
didn&#39;t realize we would be running to one side or the other of the <br/>
boat trying to spot them in the distance.  <br/>
<br/>
We ate at a lot of ethnic restaurants.  Malaysian, Japanese, Thai, <br/>
Chinese<br/>
<br/>
The children&#39;s museum and science museum were great.  Friday nights <br/>
the children museum has a cheap admission deal.  We have a membership <br/>
to our local science museum so we got into the Boston science museum <br/>
for free.  The rollercoaster science display was awesome and that&#39;s <br/>
where they spent most of their time.  <br/>
<br/>
The art museum was nice too, except when you go there with kids they <br/>
automatically treat you like a criminal and stare you down the whole <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
We also liked the frog pond and running through the fountains at the <br/>
Christian Science Center.  The kids got a kick out of the swan boats <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, and the FAO Schwartz toy store and the Curious George goes <br/>
to Wardsworth store. <br/>

<br/>
Plymouth (Plimouth Plantation and Mayflower)<br/>
<br/>
Salem. It&#39;s tacky but it&#39;s fun. And there&#39;s some real pagan/wiccan stores<br/>
there for the real witches that are cool :-) There&#39;s also the House of Seven<br/>

<br/>
Sturbridge Village. (A recreated 1800&#39;s (?) New England village.)<br/>
<br/>
The Old North bridge and Lexington Green. Which are about as much fun as the<br/>
Freedom Trail ;-)<br/>
<br/>
John Hancock or Prudential buildings -- I can&#39;t remember which is the taller<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
I think at the Old State House there&#39;s a light up map that shows how much<br/>
smaller the land used to be before it was all filled in with landfill.)<br/>
<br/>
Faneuil Hall (neat little stores and carts and eating)<br/>
<br/>
Province Town at the tip of Cape Cod. (For those who don&#39;t mind traffic in<br/>
the summer! The Cape is *wonderful* before June 24 when the season starts.<br/>
But lots of the shops and restaurants are closed. The ocean side has bigger<br/>
waves than the bay side. But it depends where on the Cape you go. The water<br/>
is warmest in September. Warm, of course, being a relative term.)<br/>
<br/>
Aquarium.<br/>
<br/>
If you love books, New England Mobile Book Fair in Natick. (Go directly to<br/>
the remainder room.)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of off the top of my head.<br/>

but not that far out. We were in Las Vegas on Aug 3 when it happened and<br/>
apparently the gift shop burned and that was the only entrance to the ship.<br/>
But the ship wasn&#39;t damaged so it wasn&#39;t that big of a deal. I assume they<br/>
must have moved the ship.<br/>
<br/>
I went looking for a story on the internet. There are incredibly few which<br/>
is why this rather bizarre and ironic connection to the Christianity<br/>
discussion was near the top. It&#39;s part of Bible Doctrine - A Grace Oriented<br/>
Divine Viewpoint of Current Events <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.biblenews1.com/">http://www.biblenews1.com/</a><br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; August 3 (Day 215, Cover):  During a severe thunderstorm in Boston that<br/>
&gt; flooded some areas and started some fires from lightning, the Boston Tea Party<br/>
&gt; Complex caught fire.  The gift shop in the complex went up in flames and was a<br/>
&gt; total loss, but The Boston Tea Party ship itself, a replica of the historic<br/>
&gt; vessel from which colonists tossed tea overboard to protest high British<br/>
&gt; taxes, was not damaged.  Firefighters arrived at the scene about 9:00 PM EDT.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Boston Tea Party occurred on December 16, 1773 when American<br/>
&gt; revolutionaries disguised as Mohawk Indians and Negroes boarded three East<br/>
&gt; India Company ships and threw 342 crates of tea overboard to protest British<br/>
&gt; tax on tea.  The three ships, which had arrived on November 27, 1773 were the<br/>
&gt; Dartmouth, Eleanor and the Beaver.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dartmouth is named for the English town at the mouth of the Dart River, which<br/>
&gt; is famous in British naval tradition.  The name is derived from darthe, the<br/>
&gt; Celtic word for oak.  The mouth of a river with its delta is the symbol of a<br/>
&gt; female.  Eleanor is a famous French female name from Ailenor, which is<br/>
&gt; possibly a form of Helen.  Eleanor of Aquitaine was the wife of King Louis VII<br/>
&gt; of France.  The beaver is an industrious animal that dams up streams.  It is<br/>
&gt; noted for its tail and hair.   Beavers spend a lot of time grooming themselves<br/>
&gt; and are symbolic of females whose long hair requires much attention like the<br/>
&gt; long hair of the women who anointed the feet of Jesus (Luke 7:38; John 12:3). <br/>
&gt; Thus, the three names all refer to females.  And the ships were in Boston<br/>
&gt; harbor, which is also a symbol of a female.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The three ships, however, were symbolic of Ecumenical, Political, and Cosmic<br/>
&gt; Babylon.  They were in the Cosmic System.  There could be no compromise. <br/>
&gt; Their cargo must be destroyed.  November 27, 1773 stood for:  11th month- a<br/>
&gt; witness; 27- a horn, which gores; 77- Reverse Process Reversionism, a symbol<br/>
&gt; of the goddess of love; and 73- freedom.  There were 342 crates of tea<br/>
&gt; destroyed, where 300 is for judgment, and 42 for Baal, the bear, and Russia. <br/>
&gt; England had been overcome by the power of Baal.  December 16, 1773 stood for: <br/>
&gt; 12th month- authority; 16- sanctification.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boston is at 42 N., for Baal, the bear, and Russia, and 71 W., for a strait. <br/>
&gt; The American revolutionaries were fighting to throw off the yoke of Baal.  The<br/>
&gt; Boston Tea Party marked the change in American resistance from talk to violent<br/>
&gt; resistance.  After the Boston Tea Party, Britain was not about to back down<br/>
&gt; either, and there was harsh British retaliation.  The Boston Tea Party was<br/>
&gt; about Baal, Marriage Culture, and freedom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427424192">So the term &quot;beaver&quot; has to do with a woman&#39;s HAIR!<br/>
Oh!<br/>
<br/>
So when Kurt Vonnegut&#39;s character Kilgore Trout&#39;s stories are published in <br/>
magazines with pictures of wide open beavers that&#39;s Biblically sound?<br/>
<br/>
Good.<br/>
<br/>
And on South Park when Cartman (thought he had) started his period and went <br/>
to buy sanitary supplies called things like &quot;cotton cork&quot; and &quot;beaver dam&quot; <br/>
that too is explained by the virtuous and clean river-damming mammals?<br/>
<br/>
I sang a ballad at the talent show at the HSC conference Saturday.  I learned <br/>
the ballad when I was a teenager.   It&#39;s a version of The Twa Sisters, which <br/>
sometimes leads up to a magical harp.  Not this version.  But I learned <br/>
something new about it just last week.  I was looking something up on google <br/>
(which means mostly that I was home and the computer was on and I had a <br/>
thought I couldn&#39;t complete to my own satisfaction), and looked up &quot;beaver <br/>
hat&quot; so I might could say something intelligent.<br/>
<br/>
In the song the young man &quot;gave his love a beaver hat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had thought since 1970 or so that this line must mean that this version <br/>
dated from the late century or early 18th century.  It&#39;s found in Nova Scotia <br/>
and somewhere more southerly (I&#39;d have to get up and go look and I&#39;m tired, <br/>
but I think Kentucky) that I know of.  I thought it needed to be early in <br/>
American-days for it to be that similar in those dissimilar places.<br/>
<br/>
WELL!!!  As to beavers, I did not know until last week these things:<br/>
<br/>
There were beavers in Europe but they had killed them out this way and that, <br/>
but in part by the popularity of felt made of beaver fur.   So when the <br/>
southern Europeans were knocking over central and southern &quot;new world&quot; <br/>
cultures for their gold, northern Europeans were knocking over beavers for <br/>
their pelts, and felling trees for masts for ships.  The beaver hat was a big <br/>
fad in Elizabethan England, and since beavers were becoming scarce-to-none <br/>
there, but they were still common in northern-new-world, the fad grew.<br/>
<br/>
So my ballad-dating can be backed up to the early 17th century and if the <br/>
song existed in England (nothing suggests it didn&#39;t; other versions are there <br/>
and points north into Scandinavia, I think), then the fact that it&#39;s in more <br/>
than one Canadian/U.S. place isn&#39;t a problem at all.<br/>
<br/>
