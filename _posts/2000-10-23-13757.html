Sounds to me like it isn&#39;t either one, but closer to unschooling depending on <br/>
how you define it. Most kids, and often even adults, need someone to help <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147466656">With an e-mail address like _yet will I trust Him--I wonder why you would be<br/>
so judgmental. Christ came to heal--even the depressed---Have you led your<br/>
friends to trust Him or only shown a hypocritical Christianity?  Maybe<br/>
unschooling or any type of schooling is not the priority in their family<br/>
right now, rather love which stands with them and offers help. Maybe<br/>
cleaning house or preparing a meal for the mom who for some reason can&#39;t get<br/>
beyond the tears today. Possibly that example would teach your child a<br/>
&quot;lesson for the day&quot; in compassion as well as unconditional love which I<br/>
believe all Christians are called to are they not?<br/>

I wanted to say I agree with Candice. Depression is debilitating. This<br/>
family needs support and shouldn&#39;t be used as a yardstick on what&#39;s &quot;normal&quot;<br/>
or not in unschooling. Sounds like the husband of the depressed woman is not<br/>
getting her the help she needs, as in medical help and also help at home.<br/>
Maybe he&#39;s in denial about it all. Have the children ever seen their mother<br/>
in any other condition? Imagine what that would do to them, growing up only<br/>
knowing a mother who closes herself in her room and cries...it would have<br/>
made me &quot;difficult&quot;, too.<br/>
<br/>
If this is the only unschooling family you know personally, hang out here<br/>
for awhile and/or get yourself into a local group and/or read about<br/>
unschooling. It will change your husband&#39;s perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-271553655">When a parent is clinically depressed, I&#39;d rather see them unschooling than <br/>
taking their debilitated emotional state into a structured situation where <br/>
they might end up being emotionally abusive to a child about something as <br/>
dumb as spelling lists.  And depression isn&#39;t made better by failure, or by <br/>
bad relationships, and so going through structured homeschooling motions (or <br/>
worse--a full-blown actual push to live school-at-home) would help nobody.  <br/>
That type of homeschooling has a high failure rate.<br/>
<br/>
If the family doesn&#39;t believe in psychiatry, my personal next recommendation <br/>
(not knowing them, and imagining the worst families I can, which isn&#39;t really <br/>
fair) would be for the kids to go to school.  That way the mom could at least <br/>
sleep, and the kids could be around perky, smiling, optimistic people some of <br/>
the time.  (And some bullies too, and some dimwits too, but the tradeoff <br/>
might be worth it in such a case.)<br/>

It&#39;s somewhere between just an opinion and documentable.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years I&#39;ve been involved in homeschooling hundreds of families that <br/>
I&#39;ve seen/heard from/read accounts from have gone from absolute structure to <br/>
looser/unschooling or put their kids back in school.  A  handful (fewer than <br/>
ten) that I know of/have read from have gone from unschooling to structure <br/>
(and I know of none that went to structure and loved it and stayed there).<br/>
<br/>
Of those families that just flat give up, it seems highly full of accounts of <br/>
school-like school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there ARE any stats on such things, and I&#39;m not sure there <br/>
could be.  So it&#39;s educated guess, informed anecdotal evidence, and I <br/>
probably should have qualified it as such.  By &quot;failure rate&quot; I didn&#39;t mean <br/>
failure to produce text scores, but failure of the family to maintain that <br/>
lifestyle in peace and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of families do.<br/>
<br/>
So what WAS I trying to say?  That of failures (if we could somehow amass a <br/>
set of homeschooling families who considered homeschooling to have failed, <br/>
and they gave up or changed their approach) it is, in my experience, often <br/>
the attempt at reproducing school at home which fails to create happy people <br/>
who believe in homeschooling.  <br/>

If that approach worked, school would be the greatest learning environment in <br/>

The &quot;school at home&quot; people almost *all* have returned to the system within a

(we&#39;ve homeschooled for nearly 10 yrs now). So even though it would be difficult 
to have a statistical count on this, I think a hand count via a poll using the

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well,  I guess I&#39;m kind of an expert, having met and talked to literally<br/>
thousands of homeschooling families coast to coast in my travels.<br/>
<br/>
It is almost universally true that homeschooling families, even those of<br/>
fundamentalist persuasion (Christian or Moslem or Jewish) tend to loosen up as<br/>
time goes on -- some might even end up calling themselves unschoolers (I don&#39;t,<br/>
so I can provide some even-handed perspective).<br/>
<br/>
There are three major exceptions that I&#39;ve seen:<br/>
-- Somewhere in the homeschooling experience, parents find their child is<br/>
suffering from Asperger&#39;s Syndrome (a minor form of autism), or something akin to<br/>
ADHD and benefits from more structure.<br/>
-- A child (or parents) decides s/he needs to accomplish specific kinds of<br/>
tasks/courses, etc. for college or technical school entry, and finds it most<br/>
easily accomplished through structure.<br/>
-- A family gets larger quickly (multiple adoptions; a death of a sibling results<br/>
in children joining a new joint family, etc.), and the parents find unschooling<br/>
too exhausting.<br/>
<br/>
There may be more exceptions, but the vast majority move the other way.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. -- I&#39;m going to be speaking at various locations in Florida (Orlando, West<br/>
Palm, Fort Lauderdale, etc.)  E-mail me if you&#39;d like details.<br/>

<br/>
This is really interesting to me, because I am still<br/>
in the trying hard to relax more about homeschooling<br/>
category, but when I read your exceptions, I realize<br/>
that our family kind of fits into to all three of<br/>
these...<br/>
<br/>
-I have a 7 year old with major attention/focus<br/>
problems who would most likely be diagnosed ADHD if I<br/>
let him be.  <br/>
-My eldest at 14 has real aspirations toward an<br/>
advanced degree in the Math and Science field; she&#39;s<br/>
even leaning toward medical school<br/>
<br/>
-My family has grown from three children to seven in<br/>
the eight years we&#39;ve been homeschooling.  Even though<br/>
that might not be as rapidly as some...it has produced<br/>
exhaustion in this Mom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been really tempted, especially with these<br/>
circumstances, to turn back to more structure, but I<br/>
know what a more &quot;unschooled&quot; focus has done for our<br/>
family as far as creativity, so I keep hanging in<br/>
there.  Believe me, though, sometimes I want to dive<br/>
back into those boxed curricula, just to bring some<br/>
order into our lives!<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that though I agree with Sandra&#39;s<br/>
comments, I know a lot of people who stick with the<br/>
school at home mode through years and years.  But,<br/>
what I look at are the children.  Maybe they are<br/>
testing well, but at what price?  While I can&#39;t judge<br/>
anyone else&#39;s situation, I see a lot of anger produced<br/>
in some of these very controlled situations and I just<br/>
gotta believe that somehow, somewhere, sometime, that<br/>
rebellious spirit is going to come out.<br/>
<br/>
I think the path to the inner spirit is the road less<br/>
travelled and though cirumstances make living that way<br/>
more difficult-it&#39;s definitely what I want my kids to<br/>
possess when they leave home.  Whether you call that<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; or simply learning to listen to your<br/>
inner voice, to me it means letting go of control and<br/>
sometimes structure in order to let children find<br/>
their own voices within.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this makes a bit of sense...I&#39;m pretty<br/>
bleary-eyed right now!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right on the money, there, Sandra.  He has<br/>
rejected structure since Day 1.  This child was my<br/>
experiment into total unschooling even before I knew<br/>
what it was.<br/>
He&#39;s always shocking me.  Everything he has learned<br/>
has been on his own timetable and from his own<br/>
devices. <br/>
He&#39;s writing a book on the computer. This is teaching<br/>
him to read and spell...things that he says he does<br/>
NOT want to know.  He keeps stats for every NFL<br/>
football game (especially the Packers...we are from<br/>
Wisconsin.  He does mulitiplication, division,<br/>
addition and subtraction in his head, but if I write<br/>
down the problems, he looks at me as if I&#39;m a nut<br/>
expecting him to do such &quot;hard&quot; work.  He records play<br/>
by play imaginary football games on his tape recorder<br/>
in the basement and draws sheets of illustrations to<br/>
go with them.  His latest fascination is King Tut&#39;s<br/>
tomb and all things Egyptian, so he wrote a letter to<br/>
his aunt all in heiroglyphics.  He would watch<br/>
television or play on the computer for hours at a<br/>
time.  <br/>
He has a wholly innocent way of looking at life which<br/>
makes us smile often!<br/>
<br/>
The down side is...<br/>
He doesn&#39;t tie his shoes, zip his coat or pay much<br/>
attention to where anything goes.  He has a very low<br/>
tolerance level and is always griping about others<br/>
being out to &quot;get him.&quot;  He eats like a horse and<br/>
constantly requires good whole food because he burns<br/>
up calories so fast.  He played organized sports for<br/>
the first time this Fall (soccer) and though he talked<br/>
like he was the star, he really had a tough time just<br/>
staying in position (or even on the field, for that<br/>
matter).  He loved it so much, that we let him play,<br/>
and thank God he had a wonderful coach who made it a<br/>
great experience.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is that these are the type of kids<br/>
that everybody says...structure, structure, structure<br/>
for and my relatives tend to think I&#39;m doing him a<br/>
disservice by keeping him at home. And you know, even<br/>
though this one of all my kids frustrates me the most,<br/>
he&#39;s the one who I know I have to do this for...I<br/>
would fight anybody tooth and nail who tried to take<br/>
away his special-ness and make him conform.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening, all.  I guess I need to de-lurk<br/>
for awhile!  Lots of thoughts boiling in the pot<br/>
upstairs!<br/>
<br/>
Have a good one-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55411760">In a message dated 00-11-13 09:49:10 EST, you write:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; -I have a 7 year old with major attention/focus<br/>
  problems who would most likely be diagnosed ADHD if I<br/>
  let him be.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 This one, I think, is a prime  NON-structure candidate.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ADHD is often an extreme reaction to the structure of school.   Then school <br/>
treats it like a big &quot;condition&quot; which requires drugs and special education <br/>
intervention, when all they&#39;d need to do would be to quit trying to put that <br/>
quick-thinking, busy spinning-round peg in that dull square hole.<br/>
<br/>
ADD and ADHD are more baffling than the simple &quot;hyperactive&quot; or &quot;does not pay <br/>
attention&quot; (which are in English, not jargon, and therefore can be discussed <br/>
by laymen, so the education experts take that language back and call them <br/>
secret names so we won&#39;t understand anything about it).<br/>
<br/>
I have always been that way myself.  I did my work and then did other <br/>
things--read, made things with paper and glue, or wrote, or did things less <br/>
productive.  Lots of home-job tattoos came out of my school (I didn&#39;t have or <br/>
make any but I saw a lot), and desks were carved and kids cut themselves to <br/>
make interesting scars or just to bleed to get out of class (I used to teach <br/>
Jr. High; I vividly remember BEING in Jr. High), and whole storage shelves or <br/>
drawers of desks were filled up with sunflower seed shells, or interesting <br/>
chewing gum formations.  That was all caused by the teachers expecting kids <br/>
to sit still for 55 minutes, and ideally to take the same amount of time to <br/>
the minute to read their stupid chapter and answer their stupid questions (or <br/>
whatever).<br/>
<br/>
In an environment in which finishing a task is GOOD, and not a sign of <br/>
troublemaking or a lack of checking one&#39;s work, then a child can go on to <br/>
something else, and that jittery &quot;must DO something&quot; activity never needs to <br/>
show up. <br/>
<br/>
On the other side of the same coin, a child (same kind of child) who can <br/>
become obsessively fascinated with a book or a project doesn&#39;t get <br/>
interrupted by the Bell from Hell within an hour and get force marched to <br/>
another room to spin straw from gold for another 55 minutes.  (Okay, I dibs <br/>
that as a book title or at least a chapter title---everyone else leave it for <br/>
mine.  &quot;Spinning Straw from Gold&quot; copyright Sandra Dodd [unless anyone knows <br/>
of it already being published].)<br/>
<br/>
If a child who might (in school) be called hyperactive (or some jargonish <br/>
version thereof) is allowed to change tasks or stay on one task indefinitely, <br/>
there will be no symptoms to see.  <br/>

bathrooms, left campus, but everyone liked me including my teachers and<br/>
