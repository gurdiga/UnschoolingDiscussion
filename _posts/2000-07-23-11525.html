<br/>
Poor baby!  The both of you!  Isn&#39;t it gut-wrenching to have to decline<br/>
your baby&#39;s request for a nursing, when you know you can provide her<br/>
with what she needs?  Several years back I had a similar situation with<br/>
my daughter who needed major dental work, under general anesthesia.  It<br/>
broke my heart to hear her crying in the night and I had to ignore her<br/>
pleas!  (My husband slept with her as I thought that might make it<br/>
easier for her to not expect a nursing...)  Thank goodness it&#39;s over<br/>
with and you can make it up to Casey...Hope you&#39;re both feeling better<br/>
soon!<br/>
<br/>

PS...The other difficult thing I had to deal with back then was when I<br/>
tried to nurse my daughter in recovery and later at home, and after all<br/>
the work that had been done to her mouth, she couldn&#39;t nurse very well! <br/>
We both cried when she lamented to me, &quot;Mama, I can&#39;t nurse anymore!&quot; <br/>
It took her a week to make the adjustment and learn to nurse again.<br/>

&gt; Hi all. Just wanted to let you know that our littlest darling (2 yo<br/>
&gt; Casey) had surgery-ear tubes-this morning. All went well and she came<br/>
&gt; through with flying colors. We were home from the hospital by 9:30<br/>
&gt; a.m. The only thing that was a prob. was that she couldn&#39;t nurse after<br/>
&gt; midnight, so when she wanted to at 3 am she got really upset. In her<br/>
&gt; anger she manged to wake up fully and kept us up from that point on.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m typing this at 1:30 pm and it feels like the end of the day. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; already had a 2 hr. nap. :)<br/>
