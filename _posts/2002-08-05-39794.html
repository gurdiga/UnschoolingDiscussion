<div id="ygrps-yiv-1105171340">well, i dont know about you, but i spent a long time last year in a district where this is very true.. in some very poor neighborhoods where the parents are very uneducated.. <br/>
i too, think that much much more energy should be spent on this.. but there is not quick fix.. .. and there will always be need for safe places for children.. that is just a fact.. humans are never perfect and there are always all kinds of them.. with all kinds of ideas of how to treat kids and what is right adn wrong etc etc.. <br/>
<br/>
i mean, if i was queen of everything and everyone would do what i said, i have some ideas.. but shit.. theres no way to change the entire way of centuries of thinking very quickly.. cultures change slowly and for many different reasons.. doing what we are doing now is one of the steps.. we are working to strengthen our own convictions and let others know when possible what works and what doesn&#39;t .. but we cannot wipe out child abuse .. until human evolution takes another big step perhaps.. <br/>

<br/>
You can try.<br/>
I&#39;m having enough to do with my own family and just helping people unschool.<br/>
<br/>
I would have chosen school over unschooling as a kid, given my own real-life <br/>
mom.<br/>
School was good for me.  And even if there had been a homeschooling option, <br/>
school would have been good for me.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just imagine if we could spend all the money now<br/>
spent on schools on programs that truly made life better for kids who<br/>
needed it....&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s already spread thin enough at school.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It&#39;s kind of like saying I&#39;m glad we have huge housing projects, because<br/>
even though the kids living there may have no hot water or heat and have<br/>
roaches everywhere, at least they&#39;re not homeless. And then you can be<br/>
complacent...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They built low-income apartments in my neighborhood when I was a kid.  Some <br/>
families moved out of two room adobe houses with wood stoves and outhouses <br/>
(late 1960&#39;s) and no electrical outlets except in hanging light fixtures, <br/>
into two bedroom apartments with heat, bathtubs, showers, flush toilets, <br/>
washers and dryers!!  Instead of having a laundry room, each apartment had a <br/>
washer and a dryer.  For a few months.  Those who didn&#39;t sell their own had <br/>
them stolen and sold by their neighbors.  <br/>
<br/>
If a chid has alcoholic or drug-abusing parents in a ratty hovel, taking the <br/>
drunk/druggie problem with them to a better apartment doesn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
And those who are NOT abusers (of substances or people) are surrounded in the <br/>
new place by those  who are.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What am I saying!?  Yes it helps the kids some.<br/>
But it doesn&#39;t solve the parents&#39; real problem.<br/>
<br/>
But if a kid is the victim of parents whose habits are more important to them <br/>
than their kids are (and addictions have a way of doing that), at least maybe <br/>
the kid can have a bath and plug in a radio (not at the same moment) while <br/>
he&#39;s waiting to grow up.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My biggest problem with public schooling is that it&#39;s compulsory.  My <br/>
second biggest problem is that it&#39;s paid for by tax dollars.  But if <br/>
we must use social programs to solve the problem of bad parenting, <br/>
why make it school?  Why not just have a place where kids can get 3 <br/>
hot meals a day if they WANT to, go play with educational toys and <br/>
games (or even toys that wouldn&#39;t be labeled as &quot;educational!&quot; if <br/>
they WANT to, have a cool staffed playground available for kids who <br/>
WANT to be there.  Have adults available to answer questions for kids <br/>
who WANT to ask them.  Maybe even a few OPTIONAL classes available <br/>
for older kids who WANT to sign up for them.  <br/>
<br/>
But that wouldn&#39;t ever happen because there are always strings <br/>
attached to government money, and those are always strings of control.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who hasn&#39;t read any of John Taylor Gatto&#39;s books, I highly <br/>
recommend them!<br/>

If it weren&#39;t compulsory lots of those theoretical or real bad parents <br/>
wouldn&#39;t LET their kids go.  If the kids just wanted to go the parents would <br/>
say no.  Because lots of parents think saying no is being a good parent.<br/>
