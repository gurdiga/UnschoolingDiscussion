<div id="ygrps-yiv-1917032955">Quinn, 9, is watching The Two Towers for the manyeth time. When I am off the<br/>
computer, I will probably continue reading to him from &quot;The Family Tree&quot; by<br/>
Sheri Tepper (a great book!).<br/>
<br/>
Zoe, 13, is staying at my sister&#39;s for 3 days to babysit while she is in<br/>
California (my mom will sleep there at night too). Have no idea what she&#39;s<br/>
doing though I know that a partial list of what she brought to read while<br/>
they are in school includes: Herodotus, Sophocles, The Poisonwood Bible, and<br/>
Foxtrot &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
