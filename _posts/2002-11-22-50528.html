I know it&#39;s very hard to believe this, but scheduling their time will lead to <br/>
more problems than you want to deal with!!<br/>
Let them use it when they want to, as long as they want to. This sounds <br/>
strange, but it&#39;s the advice I got here and it&#39;s working beautifully.  <br/>
Recently, we moved a tv out of Trevors room and into the living room. I made <br/>
a deal in which the N64 became family property instead of his (now I have to <br/>
figure out how to afford that Gamecube which was part of the deal) and <br/>
everyone has access to it more easily now.<br/>
Jared was spending hours on it, and Sierra was getting mad. I would gently <br/>
remind him that if he wasn&#39;t sensitive to the fact that she wanted time, then <br/>
she might have a hard time being sensitive also.<br/>
I&#39;ve asked them to focus on a way to solve the problem if two want it at the <br/>
same time, instead of focusing on how long the other person had it or any <br/>
other challenge at the moment.  It&#39;s interesting to see how they deal with it.<br/>
Sometimes I have to mediate, but most often, without undue pressure, the <br/>
person playing will hand it over to the other person eventually and everyone <br/>
is fine.<br/>
The longer you let them use it where, when and how they want, the less needy <br/>
they&#39;ll act about it. The more you regulate, schedule and time them, the less <br/>
they will problem solve and the more obsessed they will act about their time <br/>
on it.<br/>

&quot;The answers aren&#39;t important really...<br/>
What&#39;s important,  is knowing all the questions.&quot;<br/>
