<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419253261">Did you even notice how people are always so concerned<br/>
that our kids will be &quot;different&quot; because they are<br/>
homeschooled? Yep, they might not be into the latest<br/>
clothing fad. Oh NO! What will we do? LOL<br/>
It&#39;s funny how the same things that people complain<br/>
about kids in ps are the same things we should WANT<br/>
for our kids? They should be lacking if they don&#39;t<br/>
quite &quot;fit in&quot; with the juvenile delinquents who are<br/>
hanging out downtown? <br/>
I&#39;ve come to the realization that, no matter how much<br/>
explaining I do, people are still going to be<br/>
closed-minded about something they don&#39;t understand.<br/>
Heck, I&#39;ll never accept the KKK, so I dont really care<br/>
if anyone agrees with my choice to homeschool my kids.<br/>
Socialization?! Who on earth wants their kids to be<br/>
just like everyone else, anyway?! <br/>
My point is (do I actually have one here?lol), on my<br/>
sons hockey team there are 12 kids. Twelve hockey<br/>
players, not 11 public school kids and one<br/>
homeschooled kid. The only time my son is singled out,<br/>
its by adults , ignorant, rude adults. When hes grown,<br/>
in whatever job he chooses, I sincerely doubt that his<br/>
coworkers will know, or care if he was homeschooled.<br/>
The big picture for me is his happiness and security,<br/>
2 things he never felt during the 2 years I allowed ps<br/>
to undermine everything I believe in. Never again.<br/>
Jeez, did I make any sense? Keep in mind I&#39;ve only<br/>
just begun to sip my first cup of joe!<br/>

&gt;Make sense?  Kerry - you just explained word for word, exactly my feeling and<br/>
&gt;my experience.  My son had just completed 2 months of 3rd grade though when I<br/>
&gt;whipped him out of ps.  I wish I did it sooner.  His happiness (I have never<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would like to second that!  I know our son was learning some really <br/>
negative things in school: racism, lying, fear, peer pressure, <br/>
manipulation, the list goes on and on.<br/>
<br/>
I still do not get where people think that putting children of the same age <br/>
in a box of a classroom where they are not ALLOWED to interact, help each <br/>
other, or work together is socialization.    Here in St Louis city all of <br/>
the school grounds are these big slabs of asphalt, most have no play <br/>
equipment, grass to sit on or anything.  High schoolers are not even <br/>
allowed outside during the day.  When is there time to socialize?  If you <br/>
help the kid in the neighboring desk, you are cheating.  If you ask too <br/>
many questions you are being selfish and wasting the classes time.  If you <br/>
try to be any different than the &#39;cookie cutter&#39; mold they try to stuff you <br/>
in, you are ridiculed.<br/>
<br/>
My kids do not get exposure to other kids every day (though we are working <br/>
on that).  But once they grow up it is adults they have to deal with, not <br/>
really kids.  To me, a child&#39;s ability to socialize with adults is just as <br/>
important being able to run screaming with other kids.  Schools do not give <br/>
a good balance of that.  You have ONE teacher (sometimes one per subject, <br/>
but that is still ONE authority on a topic) that you deal with.  Going to <br/>
ask for help from other teachers is looked down upon.  Heck, in most <br/>
schools asking too many QUESTIONS period is frowned upon (one of the <br/>
problems we had with our kids in school, how lame is that?!?!).<br/>
<br/>
So, yes, my kids will be different.  They will probably not fall easily <br/>
into the trappings of peer pressure (which I think teachers and schools <br/>
really start because of all of the competitiveness of it all).  They will <br/>
not have to deal with self esteem crushing failure, but rather will learn <br/>
how to deal with their mistakes and how to fix their own problems.  They <br/>
will know kindness instead of hatred and bigotry.  They will care about <br/>
other humans and not just be suspicious of others.  They will be self <br/>
reliant and not co-dependent.  They will know how to trust themselves, and <br/>
not just take directions from some nameless authority.  Most of all, they <br/>
will know how to be themselves, and not just some carbon copy of the kid <br/>
sitting next to them in a desk.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to socialize your kid, EXPOSE THEM TO THE WORLD,  do not trap <br/>
them in a box.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion!<br/>
