<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776893098">&lt;&lt; But what really gets to my husband is the fact that sometimes my boys <br/>
 won&#39;t go to bed until I do.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
WOW! Can I relate to this! My sons are only 8 but they are on my schedule <br/>
also! It&#39;s hard to explain to other people why my kids and I are watching the <br/>
Discovery Channel at 11:30 at night. One of my sons says &quot;that&#39;s when all the <br/>
good shows are on,&quot; meaning &quot;INSECTIA&quot;, his favorite show! We all wake up by <br/>
9:00 and start working by 11:00. We get it all done, so I must be doing <br/>
something that works!<br/>

&lt;&lt; as i was reading your schedule with the laaaate nights i wondered about <br/>
the <br/>
 spousal agreeableness, then later you mentioned it!  i guess it is on my <br/>
mind <br/>
 because i often stay up late (like now) just to get some solitude after a <br/>
 long day with the four children.  but hubby wishes i would snuggle in with <br/>
 him....   all these needs to deal with (including my own!)<br/>
 erin &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
OK, I had a wonderful response to this all typed out and got booted from the <br/>
computer!  In short, what I said was that a man cannot expect a woman to run <br/>
all of the household duties and service him too.  The old, you can&#39;t have <br/>
your cake and eat it too thing.  My hubby would try desparately to sit on the <br/>
couch by at least 9:00 and remain there for the evening.  this is not my idea <br/>
of romance, relaxing, or good use of time.  So I took this time to do <br/>
something I needed to do.  he can&#39;t come back now and complain about it... I <br/>
tried to get him out of it, he demands that he is entittled to that time.  <br/>
So, isn&#39;t it somewhat strange that the time I demanded for myself is indeed <br/>
spent working.<br/>
<br/>
I doth think that some of the hubby population gets too comfortable and sees <br/>
us more as furniture than as partners.  You can&#39;t ignore me, then when I go <br/>
away, call me back.  I&#39;m out of here!<br/>
<br/>
But for us, I will not sacrifice my boys&#39; day anymore for the work, that is <br/>
why I quit a year ago...to be with the boys and be an active parent.  So now <br/>
that I am back, I do have to make sure that the work schedule doesn&#39;t prevent <br/>
my parenting or their exploration and branching on interests.  Though I did <br/>
not want this schedule, I do seem to be able to get more of my household <br/>
duties done and keep on top of things better.  The work I do is good too <br/>
because I am very creative after the sun goes down.  All in all, I do feel a <br/>
bit more focused and somewhat more productive.<br/>
<br/>
It may be scary for my hubby to have to interact with the boys so much <br/>
now...I say tough!  He should have been doing it a long time ago...and not <br/>
just during baseball season!  He will get used to it, he will find other cool <br/>
little people to snuggle with &lt;g&gt;.  And he will be loved and remembered as a <br/>
good Pop to his boys.  And he will be able to play a lot more now too and <br/>
have more fun.  I do think hubbies have to learn their are other ways to <br/>
relax and interacting with your family isn&#39;t work!  I don&#39;t get to play, I <br/>
have to work :o(<br/>
<br/>
I may have gone to the opposite extreme here on being harsh with the hubby.  <br/>
But I know a lot of us homeschooling moms don&#39;t get the help and support we <br/>
need from our spouses to do this.   Asking Dad to take over bedtime routine, <br/>
even if we aren&#39;t working another job, isn&#39;t asking too much in my book.  We <br/>
do have to work on our partnership that we committed our lives to.  But that <br/>
partnership does have to work for her as well as him.<br/>
<br/>
I can sacrifice myself into a hole where I simply don&#39;t exist for myself <br/>
anymore.  or I can demand to have some value for myself and enjoy some of <br/>
what life has to offer too.  I have supported and helped my husband get more <br/>
joy out of his life.  I insisted he do no more side work, just his straight <br/>
40, and that he take his moments to re-energize and heal from the day.  He is <br/>
a good man and he does love his job.  I also got back into this job to ensure <br/>
that he would not have to take on side work to meet any of our needs and we <br/>
can live comfortably, enjoy traveling and learning on the road, and do big <br/>
projects like we have dreamed of.<br/>
<br/>
I do love my hubby intensely, and he loves me intensely.  we have a good <br/>
marriage.  Bu things can&#39;t just work for him, they have to work for me too.  <br/>
This sometimes means sacrifices and biting your tongue for the good of the <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
So I will try to get my work done as quickly as possible in as few hours as I <br/>
can.  That I can try.  I don&#39;t work the weekend evenings and usually let one <br/>
weeknight fly also.  Now I am behind and am in panic to catch up.  So I need <br/>
to commit to my time for my work and stop worrying about hubby.  he is a big <br/>
boy now, he can handle it.<br/>
<br/>
And just as an example to those who may feel I am being unfair or unloving to <br/>
my hubby.  I took Friday night off..we watched a movie... nothing else.  I <br/>
took Saturday night off, the boys spent the night over friends .... and we <br/>
watched TV, until 12:30 AM...nothing else.  I took Sunday night off, our 12th <br/>
wedding anniversary, we got home from my folks around 10:00 PM, he watched <br/>
some TV so i went online for a bit...nothing else.  So, tonight I am going <br/>
back to my work schedule, guilt-free, and wanting to hear no more on this <br/>
&quot;but you don&#39;t spend time with me&quot; nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he will miss me by Thursday &lt;g&gt;.  he and the children have me from 5:00 <br/>
Pm till 8:00 Pm too.  So I don&#39;t think this deal is too bad for any of us.  <br/>
Except me who has to start work at 8:00 Pm at night!  Well, hubby has to take <br/>
the boys to Pokemon League on Tuesdays and Thursdays starting this week.  And <br/>
the boys spend Wednesday evening at church.  So maybe all of this will <br/>
actually smooth itself out in the next couple of weeks.  My schedule should <br/>
actually slow down after this intitial development and grantwriting crunch.  <br/>
Then 3 nights a week may be all I will need to get my work done ... maybe.... <br/>
or am I just dreaming....<br/>
<br/>
Sorry so long.  I just feel very strong about this subject.  I have given so <br/>
much to others that there is very little left of me.  And what is left is <br/>
screaming out in defense of her existence.  Sorry she is so loud right now &lt;g&gt;<br/>
