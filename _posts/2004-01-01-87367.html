<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664101321">Thanks for all your feedback :) I apprecite it. I did ask Joey if it <br/>
bothered him and he said well I get them off my back he sees it as <br/>
an annyonace just like I do. I will talk to him about what we can <br/>
say which is what we do now when people ask him about homeschooling. <br/>
People always ask him what grade level he is in and he says none I <br/>
just teach myself things when I want to know them but mostly I play <br/>
video games because I really like them LOL................. I love <br/>
all the ideas that were presented - thanks again !! I really enjoy <br/>
hearing from all of you.<br/>
