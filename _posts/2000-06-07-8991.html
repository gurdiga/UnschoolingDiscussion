the others to hatch, it should all take around 24 hours till she&#39;s <br/>
satisfied that all that are going to hatch have done so, then she will <br/>
take her babies off in search of food.   Chicks don&#39;t need any food <br/>
or water for over 24 hours, in fact I generally leave mine in the <br/>
hatcher for about a day.<br/>

If you have taken that one away you may not be able to return it to <br/>
her, but she may accept it.   If you need to feed it a little rolled oats <br/>
is a good food to start it on.   We feed ours laying pellets instead of <br/>
chick starter as we are avoiding medications.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with  the chick,<br/>

Farm moms, we watched our very first newly hatched baby chick yesterday and<br/>
it was quite an experience for all of us. The mama hen is ignoring it while<br/>
she is still setting on her other eggs. Right now, I have it inside under a<br/>
lamp, but don&#39;t know how/what to get it to eat and drink. Please advise.<br/>
<br/>
Liz, or anyone from Arkansas, do you know if there&#39;s any way to get those<br/>
notice of intent forms without going to the local public school? I got one<br/>
mailed to me last year, but don&#39;t remember where I called. Also, do we have<br/>
to actually write down that we have school for 6 or 7 hours a day? It bugs<br/>
me to even have to say that, since she&#39;ll only be a first grader. By the<br/>
way, I&#39;m in the southwest part of the state (Polk County).---Becky</div>
