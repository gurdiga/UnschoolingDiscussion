<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541144712">OK. so it was my own personal initiation into this group. lol.. I   <br/>
joined this group on the suggestion from a member of another HS group <br/>
I am on.  I read 100 messages!  I wanted to respond to every one of <br/>
them, but I dutifully &quot;lurked&quot; and waited.  I love the &quot;unschooling&quot; <br/>
ideas and attitudes that I have seen presented here. I think I have <br/>
found my new home!   I have not actually started homeschooling my <br/>
children yet.  I have 4 children, 16, 13, 11, 7..  I am taking the <br/>
younger 3 out of a charter school as soon as my HS registration <br/>
arrives in the mail.  Our family is pretty.. hmmm.. I dont <br/>
know.. &quot;non traditional&quot;?  &quot;unconventional&quot;?  &quot;eccentric&quot;?  Whatever <br/>
you want to call it..  We&#39;re definitely unique, and I wouldnt have it <br/>
any other way.   Ive been posting and reading on another group that <br/>
is for HS&#39;ers in my state.  Ive already had a run in on that group <br/>
with a lady who personally attacked me (I really never understood <br/>
why) Anyway, hopefully this group is a bit more accepting and open to <br/>
diversity.   Here&#39;s looking forward to getting to know everyone <br/>
better.. <br/>
