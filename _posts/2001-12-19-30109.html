<div id="ygrps-yiv-44531423">My husband sent this to me today, after I sent him one of the Santa posts. He <br/>
and I went a few rounds on this when we  first met. . . I have come to see <br/>
his side of it. He asked me if it was too harsh. . .I said, you are <br/>
passionate about it. . . nothing harsh about that. . . anyway, here it is.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
Every year there seems to be a debate on whether/when to tell children that<br/>
Santa Clause does  not exist.  What an asinine debate.  For those who are to<br/>
small minded not to see Santa Clause as he is, you deserve not to believe.<br/>
Belief in Santa is a right that all children, of any age, have.  How dare<br/>
any of you try to tell me that there is no Santa.  I&#39;m 32 years old and have<br/>
known Santa since I was 6 months old.  I was one of those lucky children to<br/>
have his picture in the paper sitting on Santa&#39;s lap.  I defended him<br/>
throughout my junior/senior high school years when my other friends fell by<br/>
the wayside.  And yes, he still visits my house every December.  Santa<br/>
Clause is more than a man in a red suit.  He is the spirit of Christmas.  He<br/>
is giving to children everywhere, without ever asking anything in return.<br/>
He is joy.  He is charity.  He is love.  He is Christmas!!!!  Those of you<br/>
who deny his existence, deny Christmas exists as anything other than any<br/>
other day.  You deny that Christmas is special and unique.  If you feel that<br/>
way about Christmas, you have my pity.  As for myself, I look forward to<br/>
Santa&#39;s visit next Monday night/Tuesday morning.  Have a happy holiday<br/>
season.<br/>
