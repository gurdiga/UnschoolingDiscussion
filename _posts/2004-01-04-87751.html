<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289811802">I have a son who was 4 years old in September.  He&#39;s been dry for over 2 years now, but will NOT poop in the potty!<br/>
<br/>
He will bring me a diaper when he needs to go and then ask to be changed.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve tried telling him we aren&#39;t going to buy any more diapers and he&#39;ll take his own saved money and buy them! <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve tried telling him that we aren&#39;t going to change him any more and he&#39;ll go for 5 days + without pooping until, in desperation, I put a diaper on him -- and he goes within 30 minutes!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried sitting in the bathroom with him....I&#39;ve tried asking him to use a little potty (which he refuses to do).<br/>
<br/>
Any advice out there from anyone, especially anyone who&#39;s been through this in their family??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>

This is something you can&#39;t control, as he has demonstrated.  I suggest <br/>
you just let go.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve been through this, too.  My approach was to just wait it out. <br/>
  But it was hard not to feel that we were both &quot;behind&quot; in this.  (No <br/>
pun intended.)<br/>

to help you,&quot; with the same attitude you&#39;d give him if he&#39;d brought you a<br/>
book and asked you to help him read.<br/>
<br/>
What if you went to your husband with something really important that you<br/>
wanted his help with, trusting that he&#39;d do so lovingly and willingly. What<br/>
if he returned the attitude you do with your son? What would that do to your<br/>
relationship?<br/>
<br/>
Basically what you&#39;re saying to him is &quot;Don&#39;t come to me when you have a<br/>
problem.&quot; *Is* that what you want?<br/>
<br/>
What if you went to your son when he was older and asked him to help you<br/>
with something and he returned the attitude you gave to him? You&#39;re modeling<br/>
that when someone asks for help that it&#39;s okay to grump at them, let them<br/>
know what a pain in the neck it is to help them and to make their life more<br/>
difficult so yours can be less difficult.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something you can control. Let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Give him lots of hugs and apologize. Tell him you were wrong and will be<br/>
happy to help in anyway he needs you to.<br/>

<br/>
I had the exact same situation with my oldest, William. His brother was <br/>
born when he was 2 years, nine months and William was still in diapers. He <br/>
started peeing in the toilet just before his third birthday but refused to <br/>
poop in the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
I have read in several places that children see the feces as part of them <br/>
and don&#39;t like to have it flushed away, but I am sure this was not <br/>
William&#39;s concern. I think that he was comfortable in the position he could <br/>
use for pooping in a diaper, and uncomfortable sitting down - if not <br/>
uncomfortable then unused to it.<br/>
<br/>
He has never been a fast pooper. When he used a diaper he liked to lean <br/>
against a chair or bed and look at a book for at least 20 minutes. He still <br/>
likes a leisurely sit, just like his dad :-)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Gross alert!&gt;He started pooing in the toilet when he was four. He had a <br/>
bout of diarrhea with high fever and I convinced him to sit on the toilet <br/>
because the diapers weren&#39;t holding anything in. He didn&#39;t like it but I <br/>
stayed with him and he was okay. After that he went on the toilet all the time.<br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally, my friend Pat has a daughter three days younger than <br/>
William and the same thing happened with her. I didn&#39;t know Pat then but it <br/>
would have been nice to talk to someone about it.<br/>
<br/>
I tried some things that I am unhappy about now, things like you suggested. <br/>
Both of us felt much better when I just let it go, realizing there was <br/>
nothing I could do to change the situation that wouldn&#39;t shame William.<br/>
<br/>
My next son refused diapers completely at 22 months and never had an accident.<br/>

<br/>
It will be fine, he really won&#39;t be in diapers forever. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Help him go comfortably the way he needs to.   He trusts you and needs<br/>
your help and it&#39;s better for both of you if he knows he can come to you.<br/>
  The trust you share is so much more important than the date he&#39;s out of<br/>
diapers forever. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733516970">Maybe he had a painful bowel movement when using the pot or toilet one time and fears a repeat...   Myself I&#39;m not sure what I&#39;d do, I have a somewhat weak stomach for cleaning up shit, other than with a baby.  So while not wanting to hurt or upset the child I think I would need to explain that I can&#39;t clean him up any more, provide him with a diaper and whatever he would need to clean himself... a warm bath if necessary.  He would then need to decide which he prefers, to have to clean himself or attempt to use a potty.<br/>

maybe closer to 4, when she finally decided to start pooping in the potty; <br/>
she would bring me a pull-up prior to that. She was fully potty trained for <br/>
months before this.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, my kids have all been day-time trained well before <br/>
they were night-time dry. We have always just let them call the shots, <br/>
provided the pull-ups and cleaned up any messes. Dh had tried to &quot;bribe&quot; <br/>
Emily into pooping in the potty, and it quickly became very clear that it <br/>
was accomplishing nothing except turning the whole thing into a power struggle.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>All I can say is that my brother and his wife waged the battle of wills with <br/>
their son and forced him to use the potty.  Now he poops once every ten days - <br/>
which is an improvement - after much agony, screaming, crying, etc.  Not a <br/>
good option, in my opinion.  It&#39;s in his control, not yours.  He&#39;ll be five in <br/>
May.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my kids have always preferred to poop on the potty, so I <br/>
can&#39;t give any more advice than the others and to point to the example above as <br/>
what will not work, in my opinion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716345001">&lt;&lt;He will bring me a diaper when he needs to go and<br/>
then ask to be <br/>
changed.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son, when little, liked to &quot;hang on&quot; to solids in<br/>
his diaper, but was peeing in the potty.  I&#39;m not sure<br/>
why, but I have my theories! <br/>
<br/>
We also didn&#39;t do pull ups, we just used diapers until<br/>
he stayed dry in them enough to use underwear.  We<br/>
used diapers at nite for a while until those stayed<br/>
dry too. <br/>
<br/>
We would put the poop in the potty, from the diaper,<br/>
and flush it and say good bye, and explain that it<br/>
could go down the potty pipes just like pee.  <br/>
<br/>
My son trained in about a week for pee, and about a<br/>
month later, he was having BM&#39;s on the potty.  I think<br/>
for boys especially, standing and sitting at different<br/>
times, for different purposes, can be confusing, and<br/>
they may attach value to the more &quot;substantialness and<br/>
specialness&quot; of a BM.  I didn&#39;t see anything wrong<br/>
with that, and we dealt with it differently and that<br/>
worked fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Why some kids attach value to a BM is a mystery to us<br/>
adults, right?, but it&#39;s part of them, and they might<br/>
have any awareness of &quot;grossness&quot; like we do, to them,<br/>
it&#39;s natural. I tried to keep that in mind and stayed<br/>
relaxed about it.  Simple explanations offered often<br/>
and consistently worked well for us.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153952442">Lots of good advice on this thread.  Wish I&#39;d had you guys when my son went<br/>
through this.  At age 4 1/2 I&#39;d not only lost my (usually abundant) patience<br/>
but *I* had been shamed as well by well meaning friends and relatives<br/>
suggesting it was my lackadaisical parenting style which was to blame.<br/>
