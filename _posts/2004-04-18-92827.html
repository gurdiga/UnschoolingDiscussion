<div id="ygrps-yiv-241004903">I don&#39;t think saying &quot;if you decide you want to eat animals&quot; is<br/>
manipulative.  &quot;Meat&quot; is not a word my kids are much exposed to.<br/>
Besides, &quot;meat&quot; is usually used to mean cow/sheep/pig, as opposed to<br/>
&quot;poultry&quot; or &quot;seafood.&quot;  &quot;Animals&quot; encompasses all of these ideas.  And<br/>
when I explain to people that I am lacto-ovo veg., I usually just say<br/>
(in the presence of my kids) that &quot;I don&#39;t eat any animals.&quot;  This has<br/>
eliminated the &quot;but you eat chicken and fish, don&#39;t you dear?&quot;  Or the<br/>
awkward mixup when I&#39;m served seafood in deference to my veg-ism.   I<br/>
want my kids to know what&#39;s going in their mouths.  Teenie drinks are<br/>
not ever called juice, they&#39;re &quot;sugar drinks&quot; and Morgaine can&#39;t drink<br/>
them.  Her sugar is fairly limited due to yeast issues.  I wouldn&#39;t slip<br/>
a tomato into her salad (which she doesn&#39;t like) by cutting it up and<br/>
calling it &quot;fruit.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Furthermore, I didn&#39;t suggest she eat seagulls.  I told her later in her<br/>
room that she was old enough to make her own decision about being<br/>
vegetarian.  She looked out the window thoughtfully, saw a squirrel, and<br/>
went through her list of animals.  Quite frankly I found the whole thing<br/>
hilarious because my dh and mother were appalled.  The &quot;old enough&quot; bit<br/>
needed clarification because when I tell my kids &quot;when you&#39;re older,&quot; as<br/>
in &quot;when you&#39;re a little bit bigger you can choose to be an omnivore<br/>
like Daddy,&quot; I usually add an age, &quot;like maybe when you&#39;re six.&quot;  It<br/>
gives her more control.  Also makes &quot;older&quot; a more acceptable answer.<br/>
So, thr clarification comment was necessary; letting her know there was<br/>
one more area of her life over which she has autonomy.  She likes very<br/>
clear boundaries, so I keep them that way when the boundaries are clear<br/>
enough for definition.  <br/>
 <br/>
Also, regarding the blood type diet - it&#39;s only one theory of eating.<br/>
There are many, many others, each with their own compelling arguments<br/>
and ideas, as well as counterarguments and ideas.  It&#39;s likely that,<br/>
since I do a lot of reading in this area, my kids will end up with their<br/>
own very strong, well-researched conclusions which I will document under<br/>
&quot;science&quot; as &quot;nutritional studies.&quot;  I include them (mostly Morgaine so<br/>
far; Orion&#39;s still learning to speak in sentences and Isaac is still a<br/>
baby)in my thoughts and processes.  I tell them when I think I&#39;ve made a<br/>
mistake, when I&#39;ve changed my mind because I learned something new, etc.<br/>
Morgaine&#39;s already heard a bit about blood-type theory when she was<br/>
talking to a friend of mine who&#39;s following the diet.  She didn&#39;t yet<br/>
seem impressed.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think saying &quot;if you decide you want to eat animals&quot; is<br/>
manipulative.  &quot;Meat&quot; is not a word my kids are much exposed to.<br/>
Besides, &quot;meat&quot; is usually used to mean cow/sheep/pig, as opposed to<br/>
&quot;poultry&quot; or &quot;seafood.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
At one time, in the 17th century and before, &quot;meat&quot; meant things people eat <br/>
(not just animal products) as opposed to &quot;drink.&quot;  &quot;Meat and drink&quot; were all <br/>
the things, solid and liquid, that people consumed.  So as a vegetarian defense, <br/>
it might help you to know that anytime anyone quotes King James Bible at you, <br/>
&quot;meat&quot; meant nuts and cherries the same as chicken.   What we call meat now, <br/>
they called &quot;flesh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But in 2004, the word for animal flesh when prepared for eating, is &quot;meat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I do think if you use an emotional twist when you respond to young <br/>
children, that it was done for a purpose.  <br/>
<br/>
I care a lot about English, and am always sad and sometimes suspicious when <br/>
people twist it and deny they did.  (Or they don&#39;t realize they did.)<br/>
<br/>
Words have connotations (shades of meanings) and denotations (the objects the <br/>
point at).  If I call my neighbor&#39;s dog a mutt or a mongrel, I&#39;m conveying <br/>
meaning by having chosen that word.   If people call children brats or kidlets <br/>
or young&#39;uns or drape apes (not that those all have the same level of disdain, <br/>
but they have some disdain) it is an indication of their thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Worth considering, anyway.<br/>
