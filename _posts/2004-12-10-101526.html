&lt;&lt; Buy him Donkey Konga for Christmas? With two sets of drums? One for each <br/>
of you? &lt;g&gt; <br/>

Play long. It&#39;s fun! &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

Be sure you have a Game Cube and a memory card for it before you go there.<br/>
Memory Card!!! Very important.  I failed to get one when we first bought <br/>
Kirby a game cube for Christmas.   Very bad error.  Spent hours finding out how <br/>
many stores are closed on Christmas, and how hard to find something like that on <br/>
short notice.<br/>
