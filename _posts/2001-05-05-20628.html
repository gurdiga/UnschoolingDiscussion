<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466519521">I agree...OTOH, it helps when the subject changes to have the subject line<br/>
change as well!<br/>
<br/>
Not that I&#39;m complaining...I&#39;m not saying I&#39;ve found it to be a particular<br/>
problem on this list!  Just that we are a friendly lot and I find this is a<br/>
list I can delete readily from when needed.  Love the chatter!  Just can&#39;t<br/>
read it all when I&#39;m busy.  Changing subject line helps me a LOT when I&#39;m<br/>
pressed for time and/or energy.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion, FWIW,<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] A request<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Having a lot of posts has not kept me from posting, but has<br/>
&gt; encouraged me.  Personally, the thing I need most is the<br/>
&gt; reassurance that when your kids grow up, they will not have been<br/>
&gt; damaged by unschooling, and that is what I am getting from<br/>
&gt; Valerie&#39;s posts.  It is very easy to delete those posts you don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to read by looking at the subject line, so that you don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; to read them all and can keep up with those subjects you are<br/>
&gt; interested in. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1470862601">I was getting the digest, and was literally beginning to have eye and<br/>
dizziness problems from scrolling through the digests.<br/>
<br/>
I figured out how to make my e-mail program put e-mails into separate<br/>
folders, based on the subject line.  I switched to individual e-mails. <br/>
If the subject contains &quot;unschooling-dotcom&quot;, the e-mail goes directly<br/>
into that folder.  It makes it so much easier to scan, read, or delete<br/>
e-mails.  When I get really behind, I delete the folder and start over.<br/>

no one is thinking about where kids can play.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t generate tax revenue.</div>
