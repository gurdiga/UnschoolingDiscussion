Re: heparin lock<br/>
<br/>
I just didn&#39;t want to have a needle stuck in my arm while I was having a<br/>
baby.  This was 5 1/2 years ago.  They (the medical establishment) said I<br/>
should have the hep lock in place in case my uterus ruptured during<br/>
labor, that I was more at risk for that because of the previous cesarean.<br/>
 Well, I did some research.  Uterine rupture is incredibly rare and is<br/>
not more likely in women who have had a cesarean, especially with low<br/>
horizontal cuts.  The hep lock is supposed to provide instant access to<br/>
an IV.  But, you can have a hep lock and the vein behind it can collapse,<br/>
so that wouldn&#39;t guarantee IV access after all.  In emergencies, an IV<br/>
can be placed in the scalp or somewhere in the neck (can&#39;t remember -<br/>
clavicle vein or something?)  I figured that in the event I became<br/>
unconscious because of a hemmoraghe (sp) from uterine rupture, I<br/>
certainly would not care where they stuck the IV!  And I knew it was very<br/>
highly UNlikely for that to happen anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1243373240">Sounds like they put in a pic line which is a little more invasive than a<br/>
hep lock.  Also, hep locks can be put in most any good sized vein and the<br/>
pic is usually put in that vein on the inside edge of your elbow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632184316">Generally speaking, any needle stick has a very good potential to be an<br/>
infection waiting to happen.  IVs of any nature can create sites for<br/>
throwing clots and create inflammations of the veins.  Hep locks are<br/>
routinely the site of staph infections. Needle sticks also have the<br/>
potential to set you up for forms of cellulitis.<br/>
<br/>
Less invasive is always better unless there is a real need for the<br/>
precaution.  This is just one more area where patients are not informed, nor<br/>
usually asked for their permission.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349542985">Wups, sent that one by accident before I was done...   Sorry...<br/>
    As I was saying, I&#39;m not comfortable thinking my oldest is getting<br/>
all she needs for the rest of her life...  On the other hand, I&#39;m a<br/>
firm believer that when you need something, you will do what it takes<br/>
to learn it.  At least, that&#39;s been my personal experience.  But my dd<br/>
is very timid, afraid of new things, afraid of failure...<br/>
    Meanwhile, I am glad I joined this list.  It has been encouraging<br/>
to be in the company of other unschoolers.  But it would be nice to<br/>
read posts from parents of older kids.  I don&#39;t have much time to read,<br/>
let alone post, and I&#39;m doing this online which is slow, so I often end<br/>
up deleting lots of things without reading them.  If anyone sends a<br/>
post about teens, I hope it says so in the subject!  I usually read new<br/>
threads (but not posts with &quot;digest&quot; in the subject, alas...).<br/>
    I hope to find even more encouragement here.  Thanks for letting me<br/>
say my piece...<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698332899">Sounds like they put in a pic line which is a little <br/>
more invasive than a<br/>

Well, I saw someone else (might have been on telly) <br/>

<br/>
     Hi, I am unschooling kids ages 4, 9, almost 13 (2, twins), and almost <br/>
17.  I have found that it gets easier as they get older because they develop <br/>
their own interests more and more and lead themselves into things they want <br/>
to learn more about.  My oldest is very serious about music and spends 2 to 3 <br/>
hours playing guitar  plus more time studying his Music Theory books.  We are <br/>
in California so he is taking the high school proficieny exam this month and <br/>
if he passes, he&#39;ll have the legal equivalent of a diploma.  From there, he&#39;s <br/>
planning to take community college classes in things that interest him, <br/>
primarily music, but some other things as well.  He spends about 2 hrs a day <br/>
on the internet usually and has developed strong opinions about many issues <br/>
from reading others&#39; and posting his own on the bulletin boards that interest <br/>
him.  He also reads a lot.  I do recommend books sometimes and he has read <br/>
books he probably wouldn&#39;t have read on his own but ended up loving.  He said <br/>
his favorite is a book called Disobedience by Jane Hamilton (one of my <br/>
suggestions).<br/>
     One of our almost 13 yr olds loves writing and gardening.  Yesterday he <br/>
got to spend part of the day with a family in our h/s group that does organic <br/>
gardening and got to help harvest and learn a lot.  He will go back again <br/>
when they&#39;re ready for him.  He also spends many hours writing long science <br/>
fiction novels on the computer.<br/>
     My other almost 13 yr old loves history, reading fantasy, and activism.  <br/>
He knows the Civil War really well and has many books on it (including the <br/>
huge volumes by Shelby Foote, his favorite).  He loves the Harry Potter books <br/>
and King Arthur and other fantasy series.  He is planning to join me and his <br/>
dad in volunteering for Habitat for Humanity (his will have to be fund <br/>
raising and other off building site activities until he&#39;s 14 according to the <br/>
rules).  He recently read The Jungle about the meat packing plants at the <br/>
turn of the previous century and has strong views about that and other <br/>
injustices.<br/>
     All of this sounds good (even to me) in print and in fact, I am excited <br/>
about many recent developments in all of our lives.  But there are many days <br/>
that wouldn&#39;t look very impressive to an observer.  And when I read one of <br/>
the John Holt books a few years ago about some of the accomplishments of <br/>
unschoolers, they sounded incredible to me, not something I could picture our <br/>
family doing.<br/>
     I believe if you just trust your child and yourself enough, all of you <br/>
will find your own best paths.  I do think it is good to expose kids to <br/>
enough for them to find the things that catch their interests but these can <br/>
be the normal things in your own life and the lives of people you know.  <br/>
Sorry this was so long!<br/>
