<div id="ygrps-yiv-336307917">**<br/>
Ned asks: Is this (the following) what the list is about?**<br/>
<br/>
**Looks like we need a PRE - UNSCHOOLING  list<br/>
Things are sounding desperate in the suburbs, these days.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why should we limit ourselves to the ages that are contained in<br/>
government schools? (K-12)<br/>
<br/>
Besides, if we kick people off the list for having kids who are &quot;too<br/>
young&quot; (and I wouldn&#39;t) then we can just as well kick people off for<br/>
having kids who are &quot;too old&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
If a post isn&#39;t of personal interest to you, that&#39;s what the delete key<br/>
is for.  Posting posts expressing your own personal boredom with what<br/>
other people have to say strikes me as very conceited.  You are wasting<br/>
the time of 800 people when you do it.  Doing it twice in a week shows<br/>
me that you dwell in an extremely Ned-centric world.<br/>
<br/>
Could you please show a little more self-control in what you chose to<br/>
share?  Thank you.<br/>
