<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &quot;Children As Pets - The Cat Years&quot; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just realized that while children are dogs - loyal and affectionate -<br/>
&gt; teenagers are cats. It&#39;s so easy to be a dog owner. You feed it, train<br/>
&gt; it, boss it around. It puts it&#39;s head on your knee and gazes at you as<br/>
&gt; if you were a Rembrandt painting. It bounds indoors with enthusiasm when<br/>
&gt; you call it. <br/>
&gt; Then around age 13, your adoring little puppy turns into a big old cat.<br/>
&gt; When you tell it to come inside, it looks amazed, as if wondering who<br/>
&gt; died and made you emperor. Instead of dogging your doorsteps, it<br/>
&gt; disappears. You won&#39;t see it again until it gets hungry -- then it<br/>
&gt; pauses on its sprint through the kitchen long enough to turn its nose up<br/>
&gt; at whatever you&#39;re serving. <br/>
&gt; When you reach out to ruffle its head, in that old affectionate gesture,<br/>
&gt; it twists away from you, then gives you a blank stare, as if trying to<br/>
&gt; remember where it has seen you before. You, not realizing that the dog<br/>
&gt; is now a cat, think something must be desperately wrong with it. It<br/>
&gt; seems so antisocial, so distant, sort of depressed. It won&#39;t go on<br/>
&gt; family outings. <br/>
&gt; Since you&#39;re the one who raised it, taught it to fetch and stay and sit<br/>
&gt; on command, you assume that you did something wrong. Flooded with guilt<br/>
&gt; and fear, you redouble your efforts to make your pet behave. Only now<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re dealing with a cat, so everything that worked before now produces<br/>
&gt; the opposite of the desired result. Call it, and it runs away. Tell it<br/>
&gt; to sit, and it jumps on the counter. The more you go toward it, wringing<br/>
&gt; your hands, the more it moves away. <br/>
&gt; Instead of continuing to act like a dog owner, you can learn to behave<br/>
&gt; like a cat owner. Put a dish of food near the door, and let it come to<br/>
&gt; you. But remember that a cat needs your help and your affection too. Sit<br/>
&gt; still, and it will come, seeking that warm, comforting lap it has not<br/>
&gt; entirely forgotten. Be there to open the door for it. <br/>
&gt; One day your grown-up child will walk into the kitchen, give you a big<br/>
&gt; kiss and say, &quot;You&#39;ve been on your feet all day. Let me get those dishes<br/>
&gt; for you.&quot; <br/>
&gt; Then you will realize your cat is a dog again!<br/>
