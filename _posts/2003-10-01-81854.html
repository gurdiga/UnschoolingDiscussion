<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems you&#39;re saying that those of us who aren&#39;t fundamentalist <br/>
&gt; Christians<br/>
&gt; are the ones who are desiring the separation from the Christian groups and<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re causing the rifts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Perhaps it&#39;s different in your little pocket of Missouri. But you also say<br/>
&gt; you&#39;re a Christian which is perhaps like a white person commenting on the<br/>
&gt; state of race relations. Does your group have Pagans and Buddhists and<br/>
&gt; families with same sex partners and Asians and Hispanics and African<br/>
&gt; Americans? And what do they honestly say about how included they feel?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In our organization we have absolutely all faiths represented, all <br/>
domesic-type partnerships represented, all races represented.  We&#39;ve learned there is a <br/>
key in forming a  group and still operate as individual &quot;families&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t ask for any information except a waiver form to protect from <br/>
liabilities (name/address/emergency contact) that is signed 1 time and good for any <br/>
and all FIELD TRIPS!!! the family desires to participates in.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve laughed, cried, had some excellent conversation and enjoyed exploring <br/>
the world.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I agree there is a very large group of &quot;Christian Homeschoolers&quot; which <br/>
unschoolers are not aware of.  As far as WHO is causing the rift?? I don&#39;t <br/>
think this is the issue.  Both sides have not been &quot;nice little&#39; boys and girls&quot; <br/>
and no one party is innocent.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;I <br/>
But<br/>
people should be aware that fundamentalist Christian Homeschoolers exist and<br/>
what their beliefs are and what their goals for homeschooling are because<br/>
they are a large politically active group. The legislation they may push for<br/>
-- that may on the surface seem to be good -- could hamper how we as<br/>
unschoolers can homeschool.<br/>
<br/>
On the &quot;Jesus Christ&quot; point, many religions believe he was a Son of God, but <br/>
many do not believe He was God&#39;s Son.  Again, both of these terms &quot;Son of God&quot; <br/>
and &quot;God&#39;s Son&quot; have several different meanings in different religions.  <br/>
Than, the person of &quot;God&quot; has several meanings also, in many religions.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is &quot;sin&quot; is a term used in religion.  It is not an <br/>
educational methodology, such as &quot;unschooling is sin&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I really believe that the &quot;testing and assessments&quot; legistlation is not the <br/>
core of Fundamentalist Christians.  Most of us, really would not want the <br/>
govt&#39;s hand in any of our educational choices.  We&#39;ve steered away from public <br/>
schools and govt assistance programs.  We&#39;ve seen our kids grow through their <br/>
educational endeavors and really don&#39;t need Uncle Sam&#39;s help.  <br/>
<br/>
In my personal opinion, the large majority of persons who want &quot;tests, ect&quot; <br/>
are ex-professional teachers who have taught in an actual &quot;school&quot; environment, <br/>
such as a public school or a private school, or has gone through &quot;teaching <br/>
college&quot; and earned teaching credentials to actually &quot;teach&quot;.  It&#39;s the &quot;you <br/>
need to be trained&quot; mindset.  I don&#39;t agree that the &quot;blame&quot; is to be placed in a <br/>
religious group connotation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually been the member of a &quot;secular&quot; group.  I was banned from the <br/>
group for this reason:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I liked you at first, you really enjoy unschooling.  But we want more <br/>
structure in our group, and you don&#39;t seem to input into the planning, &#39;school at <br/>
home&#39; group activities.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
What do you think &quot;secular&quot; means?<br/>
I&#39;m guessing because you wrote this, that your current group is not &quot;secular.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; In our organization we have absolutely all faiths represented, all <br/>

<br/>
ALL!  Wow.  <br/>
All.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s pretty good!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, I agree there is a very large group of &quot;Christian Homeschoolers&quot; which <br/>
unschoolers are not aware of.  As far as WHO is causing the rift?? I don&#39;t <br/>
think this is the issue.  Both sides have not been &quot;nice little&#39; boys and <br/>
girls&quot; <br/>
and no one party is innocent.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve ignored what Joyce wrote, so I&#39;m assuming you would ignore what I <br/>
might write too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The bottom line is &quot;sin&quot; is a term used in religion.  It is not an <br/>
educational methodology, such as &quot;unschooling is sin&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What do you mean?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really believe that the &quot;testing and assessments&quot; legistlation is not the <br/>
core of Fundamentalist Christians. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t read what Joyce wrote, or maybe read it and misunderstood it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;They recognize that tests or the like -- since they know they can get <br/>
their kids to do well on tests -- will keep the government from looking into what <br/>
they&#39;re doing.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;what they&#39;re doing&quot; is coaching their children well on enough math and <br/>
vocabulary to pass the tests with high scores.  They are NOT teaching history <br/>
or science as the state would like for them to do.  They&#39;re teaching <br/>
revisionist and particularly written-for-Christians history and science.    Because <br/>
their test scores are high, they don&#39;t figure anyone will question what else <br/>
they&#39;re teaching their kids.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;That is both reality and their right to do so. And people should be aware <br/>
of<br/>
that reality or the opinions they express about homeschooling in general --<br/>
often from an unschooling point of view -- can be very very wrong.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think what Joyce meant by this is that Homeschoolers should know that when <br/>
they speak of homeschoolers in general, if they are unaware of the extreme <br/>
behaviors and beliefs of the Christian Homeschooling Movement, their statements <br/>
are likely to be incorrect.<br/>
<br/>
This is about where this discussion began. <br/>
<br/>
I said unschoolers need to be aware that those groups exist.  Otherwise, if a <br/>
reporter (for example, or could be a politician or anyone) says &quot;I understand <br/>
that homeschoolers are keeping their children isolated,&quot; and if a <br/>
homeschooler says &quot;WHAT!?  That&#39;s ridiculous and couldn&#39;t be further from the truth,&quot; <br/>
that homeschooler has just made a very incorrect statement.  The best way to <br/>
respond would be to say &quot;Some do, but we don&#39;t, and the families we know are out <br/>
here, there, (wherever).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth knowing. <br/>
<br/>
Whether we agree that it&#39;s good, or whether some want to blame unschoolers <br/>
for a &quot;rift&quot; with separatist homeschoolers, each person reading this should look <br/>
into that information for herself, or himself, OR if someone doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
know, then just be aware that there is something big out there you don&#39;t know, <br/>
and don&#39;t defend someone or something without even looking at it.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In my personal opinion, the large majority of persons who want &quot;tests, ect&quot; <br/>
are ex-professional teachers who have taught in an actual &quot;school&quot; <br/>
environment, <br/>
such as a public school or a private school, or has gone through &quot;teaching <br/>
college&quot; and earned teaching credentials to actually &quot;teach&quot;.  It&#39;s the &quot;you <br/>
need to be trained&quot; mindset.  I don&#39;t agree that the &quot;blame&quot; is to be placed <br/>
in a <br/>
religious group connotation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is not a matter for personal opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Read what HSLDA thinks about tests and measures.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;the large majority of persons who want &quot;tests, ect&quot; <br/>
are ex-professional teachers who have taught in an actual &quot;school&quot; <br/>
environment, <br/>
such as a public school or a private school, or has gone through &quot;teaching <br/>
college&quot; and earned teaching credentials to actually &quot;teach&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The large majority&quot;?  You&#39;re using numeric language with no numbers to back <br/>
you up.<br/>
<br/>
There are a dozen or twenty ex teachers on this list, a few current teachers <br/>
at college level, and they&#39;re not testing their kids.  I earned &quot;teaching <br/>
credentals to actually &#39;teach&#39;&quot; and I know the damage testing does.<br/>

ready and willing to embrace alternative ways - they KNOW what a wasted <br/>
effort preparing for tests is.<br/>
