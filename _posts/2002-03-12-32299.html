<div id="ygrps-yiv-255936733">Hi everyone.....I&#39;m a used-to-be contribitor,  butno time to even hardly lurk lately.<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
had an experience e few weeks ago.....dh bought some oranges at our local big-chain grocery.  I was peeling them that evening....and they were being ingested heartily by my youngsters and me.  Ahen I began peeling the second one,  I noticed an object in the pile of peels.  Turned out to be a straight pin.  There was some little dark brown blob on the pointed end.  <br/>
    So I call the grocery,  who requested I drop it iff for themn to have analyzed in their lab.  AS I hang up,  I envision a whole troop of corporate attorneys who will never allow me to find out what my family ingested.<br/>
Dh and I decided to call the police,  who came,  interviewed,  took all the oranges,  peels, etc. and left.  The officer later told dh he examind the others,  found a pin-prick on one of them.....and that he delivered the *evidence* to .......drumroll, please......the grocery where we had purchased them!<br/>
    Back to dealing with the grocery,  I was informed we&#39;d get some results within 7 days.  The next day I called them and requested a rush i=on whatever they knew, as my toddler had begun vomitting and diarrhea.  Someone called me that afternoon,  left a message,  and a phone # to her (though the number she left was not even a number in her Department!)  Anyhow,  it&#39;ll be three weeks Thursday...and I still cannot get a return phone call from anyone but the mgr of the local store,  who just puts me off with....&quot;I can&#39;t believe they haven&#39;t called you.  I&#39;ll do what I can.&quot;<br/>
    So I&#39;m really frustrated.  DH doesn&#39;t think I should call the media,  I&#39;m thinkng I at least need a stringly worded letter of dissapointment. <br/>
Sheeeeeesh!  Guess I&#39;m gonna hafta learn to grow my own food.......<br/>

I would call the media. Nothing loosens up those tongues faster than the old camera in their face. That is awful and I am so sorry for you having gone through that. Is your toddler ok now&gt;?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210442694">Susan, you need a lawyer and it shouldn&#39;t cost you a thing.  You also need<br/>
to turn the store into the state department of health.  They have broken the<br/>
law by not doing so themselves.  CDC also needs to be notified as your<br/>
police department is not suppose to turn that sort of thing back over to the<br/>
store but rather to give it to either public health or CDC for<br/>
investigation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d definately think about the media.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726573070">Thnaks for the viewpoint,  Lynda.  I have left a message for the police<br/>
officer to call....and he hasn&#39;t yet.  I will contact the local health<br/>
dept - I hadn&#39;t though t about that.  And will check out the CDC.<br/>
    The toddler is recovered.  It&#39;s possible he had a bad virus......though<br/>
no one else here got sick (and there are six of us! - and most everyone got<br/>
exposed to him and his &#39;output&#39; at some point)<br/>
Though the timing clearly makes the produce incident relevant and suspect.<br/>
    I am grateful he&#39;s better now....and really feeling able to imagine how<br/>
crime victims of more serious incidents must feel completely bowled over by<br/>
their lack of rights!<br/>
