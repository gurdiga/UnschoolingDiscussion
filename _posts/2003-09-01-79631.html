<br/>
&lt;&lt; One summer I was with my grandparents and they bought me a <br/>
<br/>
craft project. That night I lay in bed terrorized by the prospect of <br/>
<br/>
failure again. I couldn&#39;t sleep and got up to tell my grandparents <br/>
<br/>
that I felt guilty for buying a craft I might never complete. It was <br/>
<br/>
after 11 p.m. My grandfather got out of bed and said, &quot;Let&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
complete it right now.&quot; I was shocked! He said, &quot;This is important <br/>
<br/>
to you and I&#39;ve got the time to help.&quot; We worked on it for several <br/>
<br/>
hours into the night and I kept that little project for years as a <br/>
<br/>
reminder that with help, I could complete projects. I was cured. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
HOW wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten up at night sometimes when a kid needed something, but never that <br/>
wonderfully.<br/>
<br/>
I happened to be up the other night because I couldn&#39;t sleep, and Marty had <br/>
cramps in his leg in his sleep and wasn&#39;t waking up, so I woke him up because <br/>
he was whimpering and twitching, and helped him stretch his leg.  I was REALLY <br/>
glad, then, that I had been up at 4:00 a.m.  Before that it seemed dumb and <br/>
wrong to be up, but sometimes up is better whether we know it or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046163305">Your Grandpa sounds like quite a guy.  This story reminds me a bit of my<br/>
dad, who always had the knack for just *knowing* what was important to<br/>
me and how to fix it.  Sometimes he’d tell a story from his childhood,<br/>
sometimes he’d make a simple suggestion, sometimes he’d leave me alone<br/>
to work through it myself, and sometimes he’d walk me through it step by<br/>
step.  But he was always there, in the background, and it’s from him I<br/>
learned how to ask for help without shame or embarrassment.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your story Julie, it brought tears to my eyes and warm<br/>
fuzzies all over.  <br/>
