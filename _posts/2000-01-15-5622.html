Military Survey Fact Sheet<br/>
<br/>
Problems raised by the recent survey on military recruitment of<br/>
homeschoolers that was sent to many homeschooling organizations will be<br/>
addressed in Larry and Susan Kaseman&#39;s next &quot;Taking Charge&quot; column in the<br/>
March/April issue of Home Education Magazine. However, because you may need<br/>
information on this topic now, they have written this overview we are<br/>
distributing.<br/>
<br/>
Summary: Many homeschooling support groups and organizations have recently<br/>
been sent a survey designed to help the military recruit homeschoolers.<br/>
This survey could cause serious problems for homeschoolers and undermine<br/>
our homeschooling freedoms, as explained below. If you receive a survey<br/>
form, please read the following information before deciding whether to<br/>
submit it. Also, share this information with other homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Background: A recent law establishes a five-year pilot program during which<br/>
the military will treat homeschoolers the same way they treat graduates of<br/>
conventional high schools if the homeschoolers have a diploma from their<br/>
homeschool or another institution and &quot;a transcript demonstrating<br/>
completion of high school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The survey is supposedly intended to help the military (1) &quot;reach out to&quot;<br/>
and recruit homeschoolers and (2) &quot;identify genuine home school graduates.&quot;<br/>
Each of these causes problems.<br/>
<br/>
(1) Problems Created by Homeschoolers Helping the Military Recruit<br/>
Homeschoolers<br/>
<br/>
* To help the military recruit homeschoolers, the survey asks homeschool<br/>
organizations to provide specific information about their newsletters,<br/>
conventions, radio programs, and web pages. Since the data from this survey<br/>
belong to the federal government, the survey will enable the government to<br/>
begin developing a more extensive data base about the homeschooling<br/>
movement than currently exists anywhere. Do we want the government to have<br/>
this kind of information?<br/>
<br/>
* Under the Freedom of Information Act, the survey results may be available<br/>
to anyone who wants them. People targeting the homeschooling market would<br/>
certainly be interested.<br/>
<br/>
* Should homeschooling support groups and organizations help the military<br/>
or anyone else target or market to homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
* Information about enlisting in the military is already widely available.<br/>
Homeschoolers do not need more recruiting directed at us.<br/>
<br/>
(2) Problems Created by Homeschoolers Helping the Military Define<br/>
Homeschooling and Identify &quot;Genuine&quot; Homeschool Graduates<br/>
<br/>
* If the government defines homeschooling, it will have much greater<br/>
control over homeschoolers, because we will be expected to live by whatever<br/>
definition the government chooses.<br/>
<br/>
* Question 9 on the survey says, &quot;To help military recruiters define home<br/>
schooling, check the statements that apply to home schooling.&quot; People who<br/>
complete the survey are indicating that they agree that the military should<br/>
define homeschooling. If homeschoolers participate in the survey, the<br/>
government will be able to claim that homeschoolers voluntarily<br/>
participated in the development of the definition and therefore have<br/>
implicitly agreed to it.<br/>
<br/>
* At present, education (including homeschooling) is covered by state laws,<br/>
regulations, and definitions. A definition of homeschooling by the federal<br/>
government would be much more rigid, harder to change, and might over time<br/>
become the definition that states use, especially since it would<br/>
undoubtedly mean greater regulation in many states.<br/>
<br/>
Points to Remember<br/>
<br/>
* This survey is unnecessary. Part (1) above is unnecessary because the<br/>
military can reach homeschoolers through the recruiting campaigns it is<br/>
already conducting via television advertising, etc., and homeschoolers are<br/>
enlisting. In addition, the military does not need a formal definition of<br/>
homeschooling. Employers are hiring homeschoolers, colleges and<br/>
universities are accepting them, the federal government is giving them<br/>
student loans, all without formal definitions. The military can recruit and<br/>
enlist homeschoolers in ways that are similar to the ones used by others<br/>
and spare homeschoolers the problems caused by having a government agency<br/>
create a formal definition of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
* The survey is misdirected. Very few people will try to falsely claim that<br/>
they are homeschool graduates when they actually are high school drop-outs<br/>
who lack the background and skills necessary to serve in the military. The<br/>
number of problems that might be prevented by having a formal way in which<br/>
the military can identify &quot;genuine homeschool graduates&quot; is infinitesimal<br/>
compared to the number of homeschoolers who will lose substantial<br/>
homeschooling freedoms through such a definition. Put another way, &quot;hard<br/>
cases make bad law.&quot; That is, a law designed to take care of the worst<br/>
possible hypothetical case is almost certain to be long, difficult to<br/>
enforce, and more likely to prevent good people from doing good than bad<br/>
people from doing bad.<br/>
<br/>
* To maintain our homeschooling freedoms, we need to minimize the<br/>
opportunities that the government has to define and in this way control<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
* The number of people currently enlisting in the military is decreasing.<br/>
Proposals have been made that the military lower its standards to increase<br/>
enlistments. Therefore, it seems likely that this attempt to identify<br/>
&quot;genuine home school graduates&quot; is simply the latest example of the general<br/>
notion that homeschools need to be regulated more strongly than they are<br/>
currently being. As homeschoolers who want to maintain our homeschooling<br/>
freedoms, we need to counter this attempt as we have countered previous<br/>
ones.<br/>
