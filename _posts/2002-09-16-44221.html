Beginning Your Journey<br/>
By Karen M. Gibson<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What curriculum do you suggest for Kindergarten?&quot;This is a question I am <br/>
frequently asked by parents. It is also a question I find particularly <br/>
difficult to provide a quick, easy response to. The truth is I do not <br/>
believe that a curriculum is necessary for Kindergarten, but that usually <br/>
is not the answer parents are looking for or expect. They are certain that <br/>
Kindergarten is that magical time when suddenly what was &quot;life&quot; must become <br/>
&quot;education&quot; and therefore needs to include workbooks, textbooks, and <br/>
organized lessons. So they are hoping I will have ideas and suggestions for <br/>
an organize course of study all laid out in black and white.Many parents <br/>
have this rosy, magical, idealized vision of public school Kindergarten and <br/>
believe they need to recreate that at home. My children attended public <br/>
school kindergarten and believe me, there was nothing magical about it. <br/>
Kindergarten is geared towards the lowest common denominator (surprised?). <br/>
Any child that already knows their letter sounds, how to write the alphabet <br/>
and numbers 0-9, and do simple addition like 2+2 = 4 is going to be a very <br/>
bored child in Kindergarten.A primary goal of kindergarten is to make good <br/>
little soldiers/workers out of children. Their most important lessons <br/>
include learning that they must ask permission before doing anything <br/>
(in-cluding bathroom privileges). They are trained to follow the schedule <br/>
at all costs. They learn to eat, play, learn, and even nap according to <br/>
schedule with no consideration given to the individual child&#39;s needs or <br/>
requirements. They learn to follow directions, stand in line quietly, and <br/>
get along with other children and the teacher without resorting to <br/>
violence. And probably the most important lesson is to break the emotional <br/>
bonds with home and family. This is one result of the institution of public <br/>
school that I believe few parents realize until they remove their child <br/>
from that system. Only then does one fully appreciate the extent to which <br/>
authority and control of one&#39;s children were given away.You are probably <br/>
thinking, &quot;But what about reading and mathematics? I need a textbook to <br/>
teach those subjects!&quot;A formal textbook curriculum follows a scope and <br/>
sequence, a list of objectives that the child should attain by the end of <br/>
that particular school year through the lessons and activities provided. <br/>
Here is a bit from a scope and sequence for <br/>
Kindergarten:1Reading/Writing·Hold books right side up and turn pages in <br/>
the right direction. ·Locate parts of a book such as beginning, middle, and <br/>
end. ·Recognize and interpret familiar signs and symbols from the <br/>
environment, such as stop signs. ·Recognize and say the sounds of most <br/>
letters of the alphabet. ·Recognize their own first name ·Use letters, <br/>
drawings, scribbles, and gestures to tell a story. ·Retell and act out <br/>
stories as an activity before writing. ·Begin to write left to right and <br/>
top to bottom. ·Begin to use one or two letters, especially initial <br/>
consonant sounds, to represent whole words. ·Show understanding of stories <br/>
read to them. ·Learn and practice using new vocabulary. Math·Use ordinal <br/>
number names from first to tenth. ·Compare two groups to determine which is <br/>
more, less or the same. ·Develop the concept of first, middle and last <br/>
within a set of three objects. ·Respond to directions about location (e.g., <br/>
above, below, between). ·Compare objects based on size and capacity. <br/>
Science·Begin to observe, describe, and record daily and seasonal changes <br/>
in weather. ·Become aware of and develop appropriate habits, which will <br/>
lead to good personal health, such as washing hands before eating. ·Begin <br/>
to ask questions and construct explanations based on observations of <br/>
objects and events. History·Speak about themselves, including gender, <br/>
ethnicity, talents, and abilities. ·Distinguish between land and water <br/>
masses on maps and globes. ·Hear and retell stories that show how people <br/>
make economic choices. ·Recognize the flag of the United States. What part <br/>
of this &quot;kindergarten learning&quot; can not be done at home? And how much of it <br/>
requires a textbook? How are the above &quot;requirements&quot; any different from <br/>
the things a parent has already very capably assisted their child in <br/>
learning, such as sharing with siblings, knowing when to wear a rain coat, <br/>
brushing teeth to prevent cavities, making good food choices, counting <br/>
plates when setting the table, sorting laundry by colors or types of <br/>
material, selecting the most economical brand of soap, signing their name <br/>
to Grandma&#39;s birthday card?Does a parent really need a textbook to help <br/>
their child &quot;begin to ask questions and construct explanations based on <br/>
observations of objects and events?&quot; Does that not just mean they can look <br/>
out the window, see the ground is wet and know that the rain causes it? If <br/>
they do not understand what causes the rain, will they not ask anyway, <br/>
without having to wait for a textbook to ask and answer that <br/>
question?Really, a parent needs only to continue what has obviously worked <br/>
successfully the first five years of their child&#39;s life ­ be patient, be <br/>
observant, answer their questions, read to them, play games with them, and <br/>
just include them in your daily activities. Kindergarten, after all, is <br/>
only a label given to a group of children who happen to be the same age, <br/>
and is as meaningless as all other labels. There is no age at which Life is <br/>
not an essential part, if not THE essential part, of education, and <br/>
Kindergarten is no exception.Here are some ways in which Life can be your <br/>
Kindergarten curriculum, things you can do with your child:·Plant a garden <br/>
·Raise a pet ·Create a family newsletter ·Keep a scrapbook of pictures and <br/>
other memorabilia ·Attend the local community theatres ·Purchase a <br/>
membership at the local YMCA ·Go hiking at a nearby National/State Park <br/>
·Read poetry and fairy tales and fables and history and whatever else your <br/>
child might be interested in ·Do hands-on arts and crafts ·Find a simple <br/>
science experiment book at the library and try some of the experiments. <br/>
·Play an instrument ·Take dance lessons or karate lessons or learn yoga <br/>
·Buy some binoculars, put out some birdseed, and learn to identify birds <br/>
·Visit museums - hands-on science, history, art, marine, planetariums, <br/>
aviation, racing, naval, automobile, etc. ·Plan a trip, using maps and <br/>
other resource ·Make a grocery list and then go shopping ·Start giving an <br/>
allowance ·Open a bank account ·Visit a farm ·Build a deck/porch ·Collect <br/>
rocks ·Identify all the trees in your neighborhood ·Read a newspaper ·Make <br/>
a quilt ·Buy a few shares of stock ·Visit the ocean ·Visit a dam ·Hold a <br/>
scavenger hunt 1A Standards-Based Scope & Sequence for Learning, New York <br/>
