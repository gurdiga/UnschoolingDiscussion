<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998389143">Here is a message that I sent to Kelli off list about getting into medical <br/>
transcription.  If you are interested in hearing more or have questions <br/>
about this, please let me know.  I&#39;d be more than happy to help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing medical transcription now for five and a half years, five <br/>
of them from home.  The story of how I got into it and all that is <br/>
below.  The thing is that medical transcription is definitely skilled <br/>
work.  When a person is starting out, the pay is pretty low until they can <br/>
get up to speed.  The overhead is low, though, and that&#39;s a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing about medical transcription is that it is very demanding of <br/>
a person&#39;s attention.  It requires the full dedication of a person&#39;s eyes, <br/>
ears, hands, and brain.  And, as you know, so does being with a small <br/>
child.  Sometimes I can work while Liam and I are alone together, but many <br/>
times I have to wait for him to fall asleep or be occupied in some other <br/>
way.  He understands that I have to work, and he understands that if I <br/>
don&#39;t work here, I&#39;d have to work somewhere else, and that would put his <br/>
being at home in jeopardy.  So, he&#39;s fairly cooperative about my <br/>
working.  My favorite, though, is when he wants me out of his hair for some <br/>
reason (like he&#39;s going to do something he&#39;d rather I wasn&#39;t privy to), and <br/>
he&#39;ll say, &quot;Mom, shouldn&#39;t you be working?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had answered the question about getting started at medical <br/>
transcription for several people in the past, and then got wise and stopped <br/>
re-typing it each time.  So, below is that canned response.  But, please <br/>
please please feel free to ask me more specific questions about it, if <br/>
you&#39;d like!  No kidding!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

-----------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
Here&#39;s how I got started in medical transcription. Understanding that MT is <br/>
pretty skilled work requiring a thorough knowledge of anatomy, physiology, <br/>
pathology, pharmacology, and grammar, I started out by taking a course at <br/>
home when Liam (my son) was a tiny baby.  I think he was about 5 months old <br/>
and still in arms when I took the course.  I did some research to find a <br/>
good course, and the one I went with was PCDI (Professional Career <br/>
Development Institute). Here&#39;s a link to their site:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pcdi-homestudy.com/courses/yy/">http://www.pcdi-homestudy.com/courses/yy/</a><br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I went with this school was I was able to finance the <br/>
course and pay a very reasonable amount per month interest-free.<br/>
<br/>
I completed the course in about four months, and I thought I&#39;d be able to <br/>
contact the local doctors and get work at home right away.  But, I had no <br/>
takers, even though I did very well in the course.  What I did not know <br/>
when I completed the course (and I have since learned that to be true no <br/>
matter what kind of a course you take, whether at home or at a college) is <br/>
that a big part of an MT&#39;s education is done on the job through a <br/>
combination of mentoring and trial and error.  There is so much to know, <br/>
and it&#39;s really vital to be in some kind of a situation where you have <br/>
someone who can look over your shoulder, review your work, and answer all <br/>
the questions a person is going to have. This is true even for people who <br/>
are already in the medical profession (like RNs who become medical <br/>
transcriptionists).<br/>
<br/>
I waited until Liam was about 2-1/2 years old and I felt I could leave him <br/>
at night and then I lucked into a part-time job overnight at a local <br/>
hospital. After about 7 months of working at the hospital, I really lucked <br/>
into getting a job working from home. About a year later I quit the <br/>
hospital and now I work exclusively at home.<br/>
<br/>
This is just my experience. There are companies that will hire folks with <br/>
no experience. But, it takes a long time to make a decent income because <br/>
most companies pay on production. For example, I earn $0.11 per line (but <br/>
companies usually start a person without experience at around $0.06 per <br/>
line). I know that sounds pretty low, but I make between $17 and $35 per <br/>
hour. When I started working at home, I think I was lucky if I was making <br/>
about $3 an hour, so there is quite a learning curve associated with this <br/>
work. That&#39;s because in the beginning you have to look everything up, and <br/>
you have to listen over and over again. Some doctors don&#39;t really try to <br/>
make it easy for us MTs and sometimes it&#39;s a real struggle.  Sometimes I <br/>
get a doctor who is very clear, but that&#39;s not always the case.  That&#39;s one <br/>
reason why I was very grateful to have the part-time job at the hospital <br/>
(which paid me a flat hourly rate, though it was low) at the same time as I <br/>
was beginning to work at home so I could continue to earn while I was learning.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a very informative web site called MT Desk:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mtdesk.com/">http://www.mtdesk.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to browse around the site. It&#39;ll give you an idea of <br/>
what MTs do, what their struggles are, and how folks break in to it. In <br/>
fact, I got my job at home through a website called MT Daily <br/>
www.mtdaily.com (which is now only available by subscription).  I had been <br/>
using that site frequently for networking and supporting other MTs.<br/>
<br/>
