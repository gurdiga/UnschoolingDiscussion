My SIL was <br/>
lamenting about her middle child failing every class but one and he got a D <br/>
in it. He will have to do summer school again next summer if his grades don&#39;t <br/>
improve by Christmas break. She wondered aloud what she could do and I again <br/>
offered to have him &quot;do school&quot; with us. &lt;g&gt; I think one day she may take me <br/>
up <br/>
on it, but then I might have to explain exactly what it is that we &quot;do&quot;. &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just enjoyed spending a day with Carol Doose, the conference coordinator <br/>
for HSC, and her son, Brian.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about friends and other teens (as well as TONS of conference-speak! <br/>
&lt;g&gt;). We both have an identical situation with teen friends: they are in <br/>
school making D&#39;s and F&#39;s, cutting school, and being &quot;uninvolved&quot;.  Both teens and <br/>
parents feel that a high school diploma is the ONLY way to get into a <br/>
college. Carol&#39;s take was simple: which do you think a college would prefer? A <br/>
schooled child with D&#39;s and F&#39;s who was miserable and uninvolved and who missed more <br/>
school than he attended (which would also mean summer school to make it up) <br/>
OR a homeschooled child---free and happy and interested in learning (but <br/>
without grades)?<br/>
<br/>
Easy decision for a college admissions, I would guess! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
