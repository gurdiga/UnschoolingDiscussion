<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136465841">My son and daughter asked to join a class, arranged by our local <br/>
homeschool support group at a nearby college, on &quot;Microscopes&quot;.  They <br/>
were able to use the college-quality microscopes once a week for six <br/>
weeks ($80 per child) to check out all kinds of &quot;stuff&quot;.  They <br/>
learned how to use the microscopes, and were very excited about <br/>
seeing &quot;stuff&quot; they had gathered at home (our dog&#39;s hair, etc.).  <br/>
<br/>
To my horror, one day they came home quite upset because they had <br/>
been told that their drawings of what they had seen under the <br/>
microscope weren&#39;t good enough.  Four of the children (my two, and <br/>
two friends we carpool with) were asked to draw their pictures over <br/>
and over again (five-seven times) before they were aloud to &quot;view&quot; <br/>
the next item.<br/>
<br/>
I audibly sucked in air when they told me they had been tested on the <br/>
last day of class.  I thought I would pass out when they started to <br/>
compare scores, &quot;How many did you get right?&quot;.  So, yes I learned my <br/>
lesson........    BUT, as for the kids.......  they were excited <br/>
because the teacher gave them the same identification test as she <br/>
gives her college students, and as a group they performed better <br/>
(elementary-aged kids).  They stated that she apologized for her <br/>
tough drawing standards in the previous sessions, and now my son <br/>
wants to take her next &quot;science class&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So what would a true unschooler do?  Do I go with the idea that he <br/>
understands what kind of teacher she is, and must really be <br/>
interested, so let him take the class?  Or he&#39;s young and forgiving <br/>
and doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;ll probably revert to her usual teaching <br/>
style & he&#39;ll come home crying again, so he shouldn&#39;t take the class?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113927127">Have &quot;you&quot; talked to the teacher and explained what your children&#39;s<br/>
expectations were from this class?  Is your local &quot;home&quot; schooling group<br/>
just that or an UNschooling group?<br/>
<br/>
If it is being set up by a &quot;home&quot;schooling group, then their expectations<br/>
from the class may be very different from yours and that may be where the<br/>
confusion comes into play.<br/>

I would let your children take any class that is within your means, as<br/>
long as you don&#39;t think it will damage them to do so.  I would encourage<br/>
them to express their feelings to the teacher if they think the teacher<br/>
is wrong.  You might even accompany them to observe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72252454">I don&#39;t think there would be harm to their self-image if they know what they<br/>
are going to experience before they get there.  If they are aware of the<br/>
&quot;teacher&#39;s&quot; style and that it is all about the teacher, not about them as<br/>
far as grades and doing things a certain way, they should be fine.<br/>
<br/>
None of the kidlets have suffered from attending various classes but they<br/>
always know going in that ps is all about competition and, as far as we (the<br/>
kidlets and our family) are concerned, a false set a parameters to determine<br/>
the worth (did you or didn&#39;t you learn) of a class.  They feel sorry for<br/>
kids that have to attend these classes and that don&#39;t have any choices.  In<br/>
fact, a couple of the kidlets have expressed sorrow for the teachers because<br/>
they don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; real learning (which we define and as wanting to know<br/>
something, finding the answers and enjoying the process).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; were able to use the college-quality microscopes once a week for<br/>
&gt; six<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weeks ($80 per child) to check out all kinds of &quot;stuff&quot;.  They<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; learned how to use the microscopes, and were very excited about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing &quot;stuff&quot; they had gathered at home (our dog&#39;s hair, etc.).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To my horror, one day they came home quite upset because they had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been told that their drawings of what they had seen under the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; microscope weren&#39;t good enough.  Four of the children (my two, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; two friends we carpool with) were asked to draw their pictures<br/>
&gt; over<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and over again (five-seven times) before they were aloud to &quot;view&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the next item.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I audibly sucked in air when they told me they had been tested on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last day of class.  I thought I would pass out when they started<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; compare scores, &quot;How many did you get right?&quot;.  So, yes I learned<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lesson........    BUT, as for the kids.......  they were excited<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because the teacher gave them the same identification test as she<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gives her college students, and as a group they performed better<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (elementary-aged kids).  They stated that she apologized for her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tough drawing standards in the previous sessions, and now my son<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wants to take her next &quot;science class&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So what would a true unschooler do?  Do I go with the idea that he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; understands what kind of teacher she is, and must really be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; interested, so let him take the class?  Or he&#39;s young and<br/>
&gt; forgiving<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and doesn&#39;t realize she&#39;ll probably revert to her usual teaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; style & he&#39;ll come home crying again, so he shouldn&#39;t take the<br/>
&gt; class?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
