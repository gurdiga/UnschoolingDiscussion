&lt;&lt;For me personally, I would rather my kids had seen casual sex scenes (not <br/>
porn, but hugging, the idea of undressing and getting in bed, not the <br/>
nastiness, but the happiness, in the course of a story) before they&#39;re <br/>
pubescent.  If they get the itches and urges and have no clue THEN when they <br/>
see the scenes I think they&#39;ll have an overly charged importance.  If they <br/>
see it as just a part of adult life when they&#39;re too little to care one way <br/>
or the other, it&#39;s not as powerfully alluring or exciting.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now I&#39;m wondering about the whole sex talk and what to say and when to <br/>
say it. Never really thought about it before but now I am. This will kind of <br/>
be a first because Tara was raised so differently than the other 3. I also <br/>
think I handled the whole sex thing wrong with Tara too. So now I guess I&#39;m <br/>
starting from scratch. So to help me in my thinking and wondering how to go <br/>
about things, I&#39;m wondering how others handle the topic. Someone said that <br/>
their child made a remark about a couple on TV having noisy sex. It seems <br/>
like I remember the child being rather young. Did the child actually know <br/>
what sex was, or just given the word and responded as such? My kids haven&#39;t <br/>
asked really about anything yet but it&#39;s getting close I believe. Not really <br/>
sure how I want to handle it and I know this group will help me make my <br/>
decision.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626837029">I plan on just following Jason&#39;s lead...he&#39;s only 5.5. Our sex talk so far has been because<br/>
he asked questions while reading one of his human body books that talked about how the<br/>
man makes sperm and the woman makes and egg and when the come together it makes a baby.<br/>
We had read it several times before, this time however, I could see his mind working.<br/>
He sat there and thought and thought and then asked me how the sperm and the egg got <br/>
together. I told him and he looked at me and said basically no way and crinkled up his<br/>
nose. I told him it was true and he wouldn&#39;t believe me LOL! So we left it at that for<br/>
now. I figure that it will come up again eventually. <br/>
<br/>
I plan on talking openly with the boys (especially around puberty) and following their <br/>
lead. I figure that it will probably not be just one sex talk, but a series of<br/>
talks about our bodies and sex etc as they get older. I would guess that if you <br/>
are always open about it (just like any other subject) when they need more info they<br/>
will ask. <br/>
<br/>
Jason still seems pretty comfortable seeing me naked (I am still nursing his 2.5 <br/>
yo brother) and comes into the bathroom etc with me.<br/>

LOL!! That is funny and cute too. Mine haven&#39;t asked yet about anything like <br/>
that and they also have the books and even tons of animal stuff, some <br/>
showing copulation. I guess it just doesn&#39;t interest them yet. And yes the <br/>
&quot;talk&quot; will not be just one but should continue on for as long as they ask <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189306778">***Someone said that <br/>
their child made a remark about a couple on TV having noisy sex. It seems<br/>
<br/>
like I remember the child being rather young. Did the child actually know<br/>
<br/>
what sex was, or just given the word and responded as such? ***<br/>
<br/>
That was my kid!<br/>
I was responding to a post about TV and the original posters child was 5<br/>
years old.  I talked about what my five year old watched, etc.   Dylan<br/>
was actually a little older when he saw the sex scene, maybe a year<br/>
older.<br/>
The first talk about sex came early for him, I think because we had two<br/>
friends who were pregnant and there was much baby talk going on.  He<br/>
asked the inevitable - what&#39;s the baby doing in there... how&#39;d it get in<br/>
there... How&#39;s it getting out...and I started with simple answers<br/>
thinking he didn&#39;t want or need more than that.  But he kept asking, not<br/>
satisfied until it was making perfectly clear sense to him.  <br/>
There wasn&#39;t just one sex talk.  There were many, and sometimes he comes<br/>
up to one of us now and asks one question, kind of out of the blue, and<br/>
we answer. I don&#39;t assume he wants to know everything, I just answer what<br/>
he specifically asks.  If he wants more information he lets me know.   If<br/>
he hears something from one of his friends he checks it against what we<br/>
say.   One thing I noticed about ps kids is they have the idea sex is<br/>
nasty.  Dylan thinks of sex more like eating or sleeping or pooping, just<br/>
one more thing everybody does.   He can&#39;t really imagine he&#39;ll ever be<br/>
interested even thought we&#39;ve talked about body chemicals, etc.  But he&#39;s<br/>
ok with things so far, and not afraid or embarrassed to ask questions.  <br/>
<br/>
Sex talk has to include the emotional side of things.  We have talked<br/>
about this some, how people might confuse sex with fondness or love, how<br/>
people with emotional problems can be confused by their feelings about<br/>
sex, etc.   But the talking doesn&#39;t happen all at once.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not worried about this for Dylan.  <br/>
The kids I remember being sexually active very early were kids who&#39;s<br/>
lives were unpleasant and unhappy. <br/>
The Catholic girl from a very cold and strict family who was having sex<br/>
by age 12 and pregnant at 15.   Another whose mom was not affectionate at<br/>
all and whose father was and abusive drunk who finally left for good. <br/>
 <br/>
When kids are wanting love and not getting any they can confuse sex and<br/>
love.   <br/>
I don&#39;t worry that Dylan will be sexually active before he&#39;s ready.<br/>
I think a lot of parents want to pick a safe age when there kids will be<br/>
sexually active but that&#39;s not how it works.  The kids will decide and<br/>
I&#39;d rather mine had all the right information before hand.<br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of responsibility that goes with that type of relationship<br/>
and I think it&#39;s the kids who don&#39;t understand that, who aren&#39;t as<br/>
emotionally mature and secure who are more likely to go there early.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been afraid of knowledge and information.  I think it&#39;s the<br/>
lack of those things that gets people into trouble.<br/>
And I don&#39;t see any good coming from warnings and scare tactics and half<br/>
truths about sex and emotional needs.  I don&#39;t think we can keep our kids<br/>
physically and emotionally safe with bad information or shaming.<br/>

I happen to agree pretty much with your whole post. I also think though that <br/>
parents can&#39;t make it seem like sex it something that is just like sleeping <br/>
and eating. You need to do those things from birth. Sex is a big deal, a <br/>
very big deal. Not to scare them or make them think it&#39;s dirty and taboo. <br/>
But to take it very seriously and not just think &quot;oh it&#39;s what everyone is <br/>
doing, no big deal.&quot; I think there are the parents who try and scare the <br/>
crap out of the kids and then the other ones who just say this is what it is <br/>
physically and don&#39;t worry about the whole responsibility part of it both <br/>
physically and emotionally. I think that&#39;s just as bad. There&#39;s so much more <br/>
to it than just the what is sex part.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180634140">*** Sex is a big deal, a very big deal. ***<br/>
<br/>
Yes and no.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are potential partners out there for our kids who might think one<br/>
encounter means a life time commitment.  Or who think sex is a tool for<br/>
bargaining or manipulation., or that sex is a solution to a problem,  and<br/>
I think all young people need to be aware of that.  But approached from a<br/>
healthy mind and body and with reasonable good judgement and precautions<br/>
for health and pregnancy, sex is just sex.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think sex has to  be with someone you love for it to be<br/>
meaningful and wonderful and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to tell kids this. <br/>
They&#39;re going to find out differently anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It seems a really bad idea to build sex into either some kind of sacred<br/>
shrine of love or some kind of dirty, guilty secret with no option in<br/>
between for normal people with normal desires.  <br/>

<br/>
I agree with you again. But I still think sex is a really big deal.  <br/>
Especially in this day and age. It isn&#39;t just the whole physically giving <br/>
and emotional part of it. There&#39;s a whole safety issue to it too. Not just <br/>
pregnancy but with all kind of other possibilities.<br/>

<br/>
There are things babies do that older humans don&#39;t.  Like lie on their backs <br/>
and gaze adoringly at their own feet and hands.<br/>
<br/>
But it is as normal as sleeping and eating.<br/>
<br/>
Biologically speaking, sex is a biological function.  Anatomically speaking, <br/>
there is a reproductive system.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But to take it very seriously and not just think &quot;oh it&#39;s what everyone is <br/>
doing, no big deal.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ideally it&#39;s what all married humans are doing with some frequency.<br/>
If they&#39;re not, there&#39;s an unhealthy dynamic going on.  Maybe their parents <br/>
made sex seem unnatural, not a normal function, not a necessary and important <br/>
function for health.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I think there are the parents who try and scare the <br/>
crap out of the kids and then the other ones who just say this is what it is <br/>
physically and don&#39;t worry about the whole responsibility part of it both <br/>
physically and emotionally.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see ANYONE recommending that latter part of that.  Not anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been open with my kids about sex AND because I have teenaged boys, about <br/>
how sometimes it is used to entrap boys into arrangements they&#39;re not really <br/>
old enough to understand.  I&#39;ve shown them two (pointed out to them, not <br/>
procured for them) examples of females anxious to marry, who would be willing <br/>
to do or say just about anything to get one of my boys or one of their <br/>
friends into a relationship that could lead to marriage and QUICK.<br/>
<br/>
One, I&#39;ve lost track of.  When this batch of boys didn&#39;t pan out for her, she <br/>
went hunting elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
One came from out of state, bought four of the boys here gifts (spent over <br/>
$250 easily on these gifts), hung out with them.  I never met her.  I thought <br/>
about pressing that, but decided to warn and get the gossip instead.   What I <br/>
knew before she came to visit was she was in her mid 20&#39;s and had a severely <br/>
disabled child.  Diapers at 12, not walking, some neurological thing which <br/>
leaves her as helpless as an infant.    They met through online gaming.<br/>
<br/>
I found out two days ago that a friend&#39;s unschooled only son met and has <br/>
already MARRIED a woman he met online.  She moved to Canada from Hong Kong.  <br/>
She&#39;s about ten years older.  I think he&#39;s 17.   The parents actually really <br/>
like her and seem to think it&#39;s a viable situation.  Partly because the <br/>
parents are themselves of a similar age difference and the mother is from a <br/>
wholly different country (one of the Eastern European nations).<br/>
<br/>
So with all that, what I&#39;m trying to say is that the technicalities of sexual <br/>
relations themselves might not be as important to know as the surrounding <br/>
realities.  Before having teenaged boys I had an entirely &quot;girl-centric&quot; view <br/>
of the dangers of teenaged hormone storms.  I knew which boys were dangerous <br/>
and didn&#39;t much think girls could be dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
While &quot;just right&quot; is everyone&#39;s goal, I&#39;d rather my kids had too much <br/>
knowledge than too little, about things as important as this.<br/>

Well there you have our entire culture, though.  Sex outside of marriage is <br/>
sin and sex within marrige is a sacred shrine of obedience and obligation.  <br/>
(Started to say love, but it didn&#39;t seem right in this context.)<br/>
<br/>
The history of our religion, school system, and psychology come from late <br/>
19th century Germany, Austria and England.   &quot;Uptight&quot; hardly seems a strong <br/>
enough word.  <br/>

loved, unschooled child would have the need to bemarried at the age of 17?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He and the woman corresponded a long, long time.  He had become a born-again <br/>
Christian, although neither of his parents are.  This woman was likewise a <br/>
born-again Christian, and they found they had lots in common.<br/>
<br/>
The boy&#39;s adopted.  I don&#39;t know whether that matters.  I was always <br/>
fascinated seeing his life unfold, because all the parents knew about the <br/>
birth parents was that they were musicians.  And this child was and is VERY <br/>
musical.  Picks instruments up easily, composes...<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he had a need to get married and then looked around.  I think <br/>
he found someone he felt was a soulmate, and the desire to marry grew later.<br/>
<br/>
He has always seemed happy, well adjusted and loved.  He left school when he <br/>
was 12 or so, because the dad and I have known each other for a long long <br/>
time.  I don&#39;t think there was ever any strife between him and the parents.   <br/>
He unschooled merrily and intently, writing music and working on an elaborate <br/>
Christian website.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I hope the woman isn&#39;t just using him to be Canadian instead of <br/>
HongKong-newly-Chinese.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;So with all that, what I&#39;m trying to say is that the technicalities of <br/>
sexual relations themselves might not be as important to know as the <br/>
surrounding realities&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Exactly.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;While &quot;just right&quot; is everyone&#39;s goal, I&#39;d rather my kids had too much<br/>
knowledge than too little, about things as important as this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again exactly. And my point as important as this is yes it is a big deal.<br/>

&gt; I agree with you again. But I still think sex is a really big deal. <br/>
&gt; Especially in this day and age. It isn&#39;t just the whole physically<br/>
&gt; giving and emotional part of it. There&#39;s a whole safety issue to it<br/>
&gt; too. Not just pregnancy but with all kind of other possibilities.<br/>

The Dr. Phil show (yeah, I watch it, having only 8 channels at present) <br/>
yesterday was all about teenage girls giving oral sex to boys at parties and <br/>
at school, and it not being any big deal and it&#39;s not *sex* at all.  @@  <br/>
Young teenagers, 15 yo&#39;s having become experts since they started at the age <br/>
of 12 and stuff like that.  <br/>

I realize that not *all* 13 yos are doing such things, but some are.  It&#39;s <br/>
sad.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When didn&#39;t kids &quot;go at it&quot;? There have always been precocious sexual teens<br/>
and children, for various reasons: early sexualization by adults, needs for<br/>
approval or power, pressured by peers or older teens are some reasons. And,<br/>
the possibility does arise for early sexuality to just be a normal part of a<br/>
teens individual or cultural background.<br/>
<br/>
This was as true in our mother&#39;s or our generation as it is today. Sex has<br/>
always been a big deal in our culture or any culture where women and children<br/>
are considered the property of a man. Keeping one&#39;s hoohoo safe for that<br/>
perfect someone is always about property. Not to say there are not significant<br/>
physical and emotional risks involved in early sexuality for both boys and<br/>
girls in this culture, but early sexuality taken out of our cultural context<br/>
is not necessarily destructive. <br/>

<br/>
I absolutely agree with you. I think everyone has some kind of idea that it might be okay for their child to become sexually active, in all honesty for me it is much later. Early adulthood. I feel it is about responsibility and emotional well being. I would certainly encourage my children to wait a while. Off course in the end they will make their own decisions - but they will make it will all the information, and all the information will include why I think it is a good idea to wait a little longer.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t believe it is wise to say the general population will do it, not our homeschooled kids. I would never have thought an unschooled child would go off and marry someone that he met on the internet at the age of 17, without telling his parents. Homeschooled children are not armoured against harm or bad decisions for life. Wouldn&#39;t it be wonderful if they were.<br/>

Did we have a point? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I said my son, at ten, thinks of sex as a normal human function.   I&#39;m<br/>
glad about that.<br/>
Eating is a normal function but we don&#39;t just eat any old thing.  We<br/>
don&#39;t eat the family cat, we don&#39;t eat rocks, we don&#39;t eat our neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
We all poop but we don&#39;t poop in the grocery store or in the street or in<br/>
the car.  (No fair telling cute baby pooping stories about salad bowls!)<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say I would tell my son &quot;have at it there kiddo!&quot;   I tried to<br/>
say (must not be doing so well)  that we view sex as a perfectly natural<br/>
part of life.  Within the framework of our (relatively) normal and<br/>
healthy family, he&#39;ll learn healthy attitudes about sex like he learned<br/>
about all the other stuff. <br/>

it doesn&#39;t hurt to stall off, because once it starts, it&#39;s not so easy NOT to <br/>

every few months or so? Especially if he keeps it in his wallet. Condoms tend <br/>
to dry up and get brittle. You could open one and think it looks and feels <br/>
okay, but it really isn&#39;t. Somewhere it got poked and a small hole is <br/>
lurking. The spermicidal has lost its efficiency. Did you give him a cucumber <br/>
and have him practice? At the class I teach at the health center for teens, I <br/>
blindfold them, turn on a timer for 25 seconds, hand them a cucumber (we do <br/>
have some *toys* but some parents objected) and a condom still in its <br/>
wrapper. They have to get it out of the wrapper and onto the cucumber, right <br/>
side out by the time the timer goes off. We also do it one handed. Because <br/>
sometimes the hands are occupied. <br/>

&gt; teens, I <br/>
&gt; blindfold them, turn on a timer for 25 seconds, hand them a cucumber <br/>
&gt; (we do <br/>
&gt; have some *toys* but some parents objected) and a condom still in <br/>
&gt; its <br/>
&gt; wrapper. They have to get it out of the wrapper and onto the <br/>
&gt; cucumber, right <br/>
&gt; side out by the time the timer goes off. We also do it one handed. <br/>
&gt; Because <br/>
&gt; sometimes the hands are occupied. <br/>
