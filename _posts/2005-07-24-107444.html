11:30 every night, and because of that discovered that<br/>
Garfield is also in the Sunday paper, and then<br/>
discovered that our library also has his<br/>
books....Those are his favorites.  He also likes Magna<br/>
books based on Kim Possible, Fairly Odd PArents, and<br/>
Spongebob Squarepants.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure hoe old your kids are, but I have a great love, bordering on <br/>
obsession for Neil Gaiman&#39;s comics....and Neil too.<br/>
That would be the whole Sandman series (that&#39;s 11 trade paper backs <br/>
beginning with Preludes and Nocturnes, my 13 year old really likes them <br/>
too.), 1602, Stardust (which is both a graphic novel and just a novel) <br/>
and Death;The High Cost of Living and Book of Magic (which has a hero <br/>
that is strangely reminisant of another young wizard with glasses...but <br/>
came out a few years before Harry Potter) are my favorite of what he has <br/>
done. 1602 and Books of Magic are ones folks would feel comfortable not <br/>
previewing for their non-teens. The other ones are considered adult <br/>
comics which means there is in one form or another graphic violence, <br/>
sex, nekkidness, or just really, really gruesome. These are all in trade <br/>
paperback (which would be a collected story arc) or graphic novel form <br/>
now and a lot of libraries have them.<br/>
I still buy Hellblazer comics as they come out, if you saw the movie <br/>
Constantine that is the character in them...even if Hollywood screwed <br/>
him up some. Horror and supernatural. These are also adult.<br/>
Priest...also adult but sooooo good.<br/>
Plastic Man is funny.<br/>
There is always X-Men and such.<br/>
The Grimore was a new series that came out a few months ago with a <br/>
female heroine that we liked but did not continue buying.<br/>
<br/>
Most comic-book store owners and clerks are really help-ful and can <br/>
steer you and your children toward what will fit the bill depending on <br/>
what you like....action, adventure, horror, supernatural, or just plain <br/>
funny.<br/>

form, he&#39;s fond of Garfield, Dilbert and Foxtrot and he&#39;s got several<br/>
storybook types of SpongeBob, Jimmy Neutron, ScoobyDoo and Fairly<br/>
Oddparents.<br/>
<br/>
He likes the covers of DragonBallZ but isn&#39;t interested in looking<br/>
inside when we find them at the bookstore.<br/>

Kathryn is drawn to humorous comics with well drawn <br/>
characters:<br/>
<br/>
Calvin and Hobbes<br/>
Garfield<br/>
Foxtrot<br/>
<br/>
Webcomics:<br/>
<br/>
RÁRÓMON and CaRlMaCs (which my daughter Kathryn has <br/>
been writing for about 6 years since she was about 7 &lt;g&gt; It&#39;s <br/>
now a webcomic at http://avnhisky.keenspace.com  So far there <br/>
are 4 3-page chapters of her comic up there.<br/>
<br/>
Keenspace provides free space for anyone who wants to put up <br/>
a regularly updated comic. (They just changed their name to <br/>
ComicGenesis (http://www.comicgenesis.com) They host over <br/>
8000 webcomics so there&#39;s lots to choose from. :-) Click on the <br/>
&quot;locate more GUIDE&quot; graphic to the right of the Search box.<br/>
If you <br/>
scroll about halfway down there&#39;s a box with categories. If you <br/>
click on one of the categories it takes you to a page with <br/>
descriptions.<br/>
<br/>
Dominic Deegan: Oracle for Hire (www.dominic-deegan.com/) <br/>
Medieval fantasy. Though it&#39;s a 4 panel gag strip it has an <br/>
ongoing and complex story line. (It starts off as just gags for <br/>
several strips until he finds a story for the characters and it takes <br/>
off. Michael &quot;Mookie&quot; Terracciano is also a funny interesting <br/>
speaker about writing if you ever happen across a comic/anime <br/>
convention where he&#39;s a guest. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The Mows (rhymes with cows): They&#39;re kitties. They&#39;re<br/>
adorable. <br/>
(Kathryn would say that&#39;s redundant. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Megatokyo: American manga. It&#39;s a very popular webcomic (http://<br/>
www.megatokyo.com) that&#39;s been released in 3 books so far. <br/>
Angsty lighthearted story about two polar opposite guys stranded <br/>
in Tokyo without enough money to get back home. The <br/>
subcharacters and subplots are mysterious and intriguing. It&#39;s <br/>
much easier to read in book form since his pace of updating the <br/>
site is widely complained about -- but people still keep reading :-<br/>
)<br/>
<br/>
Manga:<br/>
<br/>
Oh, My Goddess: a guy makes a wish and gets a goddess as a <br/>
girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
Rurouni Kenshin: historical samurai fiction, at the end of the <br/>
Meiji era a former assassin for the Emperor&#39;s side has vowed <br/>
not to use his sword for killing again but others would rather use <br/>
his incomparable skills for their own purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Aria: sci-fi fantasy taking place on a recreated ideal Venice on <br/>
Mars about finding joy in living basically :-) Very sweet.)<br/>
<br/>
Case Closed: teen genius detective turned by a poison into a 6-<br/>
yo boy genius detective -- but he can&#39;t let anyone know since the <br/>
bad guys are still out to get him so he has to let the arrogant <br/>
incompetent &quot;professional&quot; detective get the credit.<br/>
<br/>
Et Cetera: young Chinese girl in the wild west with a mysterious <br/>
gun created by her grandfather that many villains are trying to <br/>
acquire.<br/>
<br/>
Sgt. Frog: a frog alien part of an invading force bent on taking <br/>
over the world is goes it alone when he&#39;s abandoned but keeps <br/>
getting side tracked. Goofy fun.<br/>
<br/>
Vampire Game: a former vampire killed generations ago is <br/>
reincarnated in the body of a cat. He seeks revenge on the <br/>
reincarnation of the king who killed him. Despite the description, <br/>
it&#39;s lighthearted fun. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Ph.D.: A seemingly naive girl searching for a ring joins a school <br/>
for demons. But she&#39;s more than she seems. And the ring is <br/>
more than it seems. And there&#39;s more going on than many <br/>
realize.<br/>
<br/>
Tactics: A demonologist and the demon-eater he&#39;s released.<br/>
<br/>
Legendz: Similar to Pokémon with kids owning creatures they <br/>
care for and battle against each other.<br/>
<br/>
Pita-Ten: a goofy angel watching over a boy. The boy is going <br/>
through the motions of being normal but he lost his mother in an <br/>
accident and his father has become a workaholic. It&#39;s zany fun <br/>
overlaying a deeper story. (Not that you&#39;d know that from the first <br/>
book which seemed to be just zany and plotless. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Angelic Layer: Similar to Pokémon but with battling dolls. Very <br/>
sweet and a good beginning to manga since it&#39;s a short series, <br/>
only 4 books.)<br/>
<br/>
Saiyuki: based loosely on the ancient and still popular Chinese <br/>
Monkey King tales in Journey to the West. A world where <br/>
demons and humans lived peaceably until someone began <br/>
releasing the confined demon who wanted them to live <br/>
separately.<br/>
<br/>
InuYasha: a school girl is thrown into the medieval past to find <br/>
she&#39;s the reincarnation of the priestess and former love of a half-<br/>
dog demon. They have to work together to reclaim all the shards <br/>
of the Shikon Jewel that give great powers to demons, and battle <br/>
one half-demon in particular who has nearly all of the shards.<br/>
<br/>
Tokyo Mew Mew: school girls who turn into part furries and battle <br/>
evil.<br/>
<br/>
Maniac Road: Story about a passionate manager and the <br/>
inheritors of a little anime/manga shop with big ambitions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-609035243">People aren&#39;t writing about comic books proper here. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
I don&#39;t have recommendations.   My kids go for the bigger books too, rather <br/>
than the individual comics.   <br/>
<br/>
Both my boys discovered ElfQuest a few years back and then were excited to <br/>
further discover their dad had the first several books already on a shelf in the <br/>
library.    (And he was excited to find there were new ones being produced, <br/>
so they were all on an ElfQuest binge for a while, and Kirby bought a CD of <br/>
Elfquest songs.)<br/>
<br/>
Marty had read all the Sin City stuff before the movie came out recently.<br/>
<br/>
Bone was one they read some years back too.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly was reading Futurama comics for a while.<br/>

titles that look good.<br/>
At the moment, except for Hellblazer, I don&#39;t buy anything monthly. <br/>

For the comic novice:<br/>
It is hard to get into a comic after it is being produced. You can go <br/>
back to issue #1 (and I don&#39;t mean like Superman #1, but right now Joss <br/>
Whedon is writing Astonishing X-man and is on issue 11 or 12, so you <br/>
could go back to issue #1 of those or they are doing a story arc right <br/>
now for each of the X-men and you could start at issue #1 of <br/>
Nightcrawler) or you can start within a specific comic, but at the <br/>
beginning of a new story arc and follow it through.Comic book shops have <br/>
backissues or you can order online.....<br/>
<br/>
The reason I forgot the other comic I&#39;m buying monthly is that a lot of <br/>
times I don&#39;t buy monthly. Sometimes I really need a fix and buy from my <br/>
local comic book store (which everyone should.... these guys are mostly <br/>
scraping by and its nice to be able to stop in and have a warm body to <br/>
talk too about new issues and such) or I will go a few months and then <br/>
order all the issues I have missed from::<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mycomicshop.com/">http://www.mycomicshop.com/</a><br/>
Decent shipping prices and a ok turn around time. You can also get onto <br/>
their subscription service where they will send you a monthly package <br/>
with all the new issues of the comics you are reading.<br/>

Yes folks there are those out there who really find comic books <br/>
offensive (especially ones written for adults) and could care less about <br/>
your rights to read and view what you want and since its comic books the <br/>
ACLU (cause really comics are just not that important in a number of <br/>
folks opinion) really does not get involved in all the cases out <br/>
there...that&#39;s where CBLDF comes in. Mostly they fight for comic book <br/>
store owners who get hauled in on local obscenity charges...sheesh.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-755042027">Excellent post. And a great idea about the Joss Whedon books. It&#39;s hard for me to get my hands on comic books (distribution really sucks these days. When I started every corner store ha a rack, now I rarely see them outside a comic book store) but I have coveted the Astonishing X-Men since I saw it in Wizard Magazine. His writing seems fantastic, the art is wonderful and respectful and it&#39;s got Kitty Pryde (whoo hoo!). <br/>
  But the story arcs and multiple titles are more of the reason why I don&#39;t buy anymore. It would take a lot to get back into those books again. <br/>

  Whedon is writing Astonishing X-man and is on issue 11 or 12, so you <br/>
  could go back to issue #1 of those or they are doing a story arc right <br/>
  now for each of the X-men and you could start at issue #1 of <br/>
  Nightcrawler) or you can start within a specific comic, but at the <br/>
  beginning of a new story arc and follow it through.Comic book shops have <br/>
  backissues or you can order online.....<br/>
<br/>
  The reason I forgot the other comic I&#39;m buying monthly is that a lot of <br/>
  times I don&#39;t buy monthly. Sometimes I really need a fix and buy from my <br/>
  local comic book store (which everyone should.... these guys are mostly <br/>
  scraping by and its nice to be able to stop in and have a warm body to <br/>
  talk too about new issues and such) or I will go a few months and then <br/>
  order all the issues I have missed from::<br/>

  Decent shipping prices and a ok turn around time. You can also get onto <br/>
  their subscription service where they will send you a monthly package <br/>
  with all the new issues of the comics you are reading.<br/>
  There are also a few places online to read comic reviews and keep up <br/>
  with industry information:<br/>

  Yes folks there are those out there who really find comic books <br/>
  offensive (especially ones written for adults) and could care less about <br/>
  your rights to read and view what you want and since its comic books the <br/>
  ACLU (cause really comics are just not that important in a number of <br/>
  folks opinion) really does not get involved in all the cases out <br/>
  there...that&#39;s where CBLDF comes in. Mostly they fight for comic book <br/>
  store owners who get hauled in on local obscenity charges...sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
  I think I&#39;m done.<br/>
