 Ren, other Floridians--- at what age is a child required to be registered in <br/>
 FL? Until then, relax and enjoy his learning! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not until they turn six by Feb. <br/>
So Sierra, turning six this month, won&#39;t need to be registered until this <br/>
fall.<br/>
I agree with you...four is all about PLAY (and by the time they&#39;re older <br/>
you&#39;ll see that play is the best way for ALL humans to learn)<br/>
But I figured if Sunny came to our group she&#39;d be surrounded by a bunch of <br/>
relaxed types and maybe we could influence her that way!!! :)_<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1146344589">I joined the list about a month ago and � wow! � I�ve discovered a new<br/>
way to look at things.  For a few weeks I was lurking and feeling<br/>
hostile (like you guys were being �mean�), but still reading, and then I<br/>
started to really �get� it and see the wisdom in what everyone was<br/>
writing.  The TV and food discussions were particularly meaningful to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I really, truly believe that kids will do what�s best for them at that<br/>
moment.  And that�s pretty easy for me right now � my son is 11 months.<br/>
I�ll probably need some pep-talks by the time he�s school age and I�m<br/>
getting pressure from family/SO.  Anyway, I�m really trying to create an<br/>
open, welcome environment for Rory in my home.  He is basically allowed<br/>
to wander about at will.  He eats when hungry, never on a schedule.  I<br/>
really �pick my battles� with him � there are things that my SO feels he<br/>
shouldn�t do that I think are ok.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And therein lies the problem.  He�s exploring his world and I feel that<br/>
when he�s reprimanded by his dad for something like making too much<br/>
noise banging spoons in the bathtub, or slapping the fish tank or some<br/>
other such non-dangerous activity, that if he continues to be<br/>
�corrected� or warned or reprimanded it will eventually curb his natural<br/>
enthusiasm and joy and sense of exploration.  His dad is a great guy, he<br/>
just thinks a big part of parenting is teaching Rory how to behave.  I<br/>
think Rory will learn by our modeling of appropriate behavior.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I�m probably getting myself too worked up about this.  But I really want<br/>
to foster that trust in my son that so many of you have with your<br/>
children.  And I want our environment to be one of unschooling from the<br/>
beginning.  How would you deal with the unnecessary overcorrecting and<br/>
instruction?  Or am I just thinking way too far into this whole issue,<br/>
seeing as Rory is still so young?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-561634872">Ask his dad to come up with one or two definite &quot;no&quot;s and let the rest<br/>
go.  Like hitting the fish tank might be a definite no because for one<br/>
thing it could break and for another thing it sounds like the end of the<br/>
world to the poor fish.  But making too much noise in the bathtub<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be a problem unless there are grumpy neighbors trying to sleep<br/>
on the other side of the bathroom wall.<br/>
<br/>
We had one big &quot;no&quot; for our son (who just turned two yesterday).  That<br/>
was hitting the TV.  There are kids who have gotten injured or killed<br/>
when TVs fell on them, so when my son would get over-excited and hit it,<br/>
that was his only no.  When he was getting into the cat litter, we found<br/>
another place to put the litter box.  When he was writing on the walls,<br/>
we kept telling him we&#39;d rather he write on paper and providing paper.<br/>
I can&#39;t think of any other issues we&#39;ve had with him, because really,<br/>
what does a baby do that&#39;s &quot;bad&quot;?  Most of the issues can be stopped by<br/>
the parents changing the environment a little.  Like kids used to stick<br/>
things in outlets and now you can buy 12 outlet covers for $1.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when my husband starts getting all authoritarian and making<br/>
arbitrary rules, I tease him about being &quot;1950s dad&quot; and he gets the<br/>
point without getting into an argument.<br/>

downtown in Belleville, Illinois. He VERY rarely heard &quot;no&quot;. But if Ben or I <br/>
yelled, &quot;NO!&quot;, Cameron would immediately drop and sit. And it&#39;s an <br/>

My &quot;NO!&quot; will stop you in your tracks. And we used it for a reason.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t allow the fish to be disturbed---that&#39;s just unkind. Our &quot;NO!&quot; was <br/>
to prevent harm to Cameron or to others, fish included.<br/>

Oooh, that sounds like nails on a chalkboard even in email.  My mom does<br/>
that too.  I have no idea why.  When I see her with my kids, I see that<br/>
she&#39;s not actually interacting with them at all and it&#39;s as though she<br/>

 <br/>
Exactly.  Kids learn to tune out the constant &quot;no&quot;s, so parents need to<br/>
sit down and agree on the big &quot;NO&quot;s and then avoid the word &quot;no&quot; if it<br/>
isn&#39;t a &quot;NO&quot;.  My mom loves to tell people about how when I was two I<br/>
used to go through the house saying, &quot;No, no, no, no, no&quot; all day long.<br/>
She thinks it&#39;s the funniest thing.  My husband and I both cringe when<br/>
she tells that (apparently her only memory of me being two) because if I<br/>
really said it in the tone of voice that she tells it in, then I must<br/>
have picked it up from hearing an adult say it that very way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286500298">. &quot; I don&#39;t believe in the complete<br/>
structure that seems to go hand in hand with homeschooling, but complete<br/>
unschooling would not fit my family&#39;s situation either. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s ok....that&#39;s what my family did before we went to total, radical <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
But you&#39;ve got to remember, THIS list is about unschooling and how to get <br/>
there the best/fastest way.<br/>
Just because someone decides it won&#39;t work for them doesn&#39;t mean the list <br/>
should change to include all ideas. So I suppose people are going to feel <br/>
criticized when we all question them, but that isn&#39;t the point at all.<br/>
No one is critcizing you, just breaking down the IDEAS being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....if you haven&#39;t been to our group, it&#39;s run with unschooling <br/>
philosophies, but it IS inclusive. So we have radical unschoolers, school at <br/>
home types and some that are somewhere in between.<br/>
So I hope you don&#39;t feel funny about joining up with us sometime.<br/>
If you ask advice it WILL be with unschooling in mind, but we don&#39;t push <br/>
anything that somebody doesn&#39;t ask for. :)<br/>

about the child&#39;s age.  For him it is age appropriate behavior.  He IS <br/>
behaving, like an 11 month old.  Sometimes it is hard for adults to see that, <br/>
and sometimes all it takes are a few reminders. <br/>

<br/>
Can you give him softer tub toys and distract him when he&#39;s slapping the fish <br/>
tank?  Just coming up behind him and reminding him it will break and holding <br/>
his hands while you talk about fish?  That kind of thing?  Then you&#39;re not <br/>
saying &quot;no&quot; or &quot;bad,&quot; you&#39;re just preventing the noisy and offensive (to his <br/>
dad, and the fish) action but still not shaming or removing him as is the <br/>
usual response of many, with babies.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;His dad is a great guy, he<br/>
<br/>
just thinks a big part of parenting is teaching Rory how to behave.  I<br/>
<br/>
think Rory will learn by our modeling of appropriate behavior.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s right, and you&#39;re right, and Rory&#39;s right to be wanting to touch and <br/>
bang and try stuff out!  <br/>
<br/>
My mom used to throw away any noisy toy anyone gave us.  I think it was <br/>
terrible.  Instead of figuring out a way for us to be noisy, she just <br/>
prevented it, often, by removing the means.   When Kirby was little I made up <br/>
to myself and the universe for that by purposely finding and encouraging <br/>
noisy stuff, but we went with a &quot;good time!&quot; and &quot;not now&quot; system so he got <br/>
to be really loud when it was a good time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  How would you deal with the unnecessary overcorrecting and<br/>
<br/>
instruction?  Or am I just thinking way too far into this whole issue,<br/>
<br/>
seeing as Rory is still so young?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think you could talk to your husband about replacing an object or activity <br/>
instead of forbidding one.  And about saying &quot;Yes, sometime&quot; or &quot;yes, <br/>
tomorrow&quot; or &quot;yes, but not on THIS bed, on the old bed&quot; or &quot;Yes, when you&#39;re <br/>
this tall&quot; instead of no, no, no, no.<br/>

I knew that we would unschool, and I found that there was really no <br/>

There is an unschooling teen here in Pensacola that plans to do just that.<br/>
She wants to start an unschooling zine based mainly on Graces&#39; book, to <br/>
educate people about unschooling and help them see into the lives of <br/>
unschoolers and show there ARE choices.  Her goal is to spread it around <br/>
locally to reach the general public. Brave soul!<br/>
She&#39;s written Graces secretary to ask permission, I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll hear <br/>

read for a while.<br/>
It just disrupts the list unecessarily.<br/>
Because at this point unschooling is not being discussed....posting styles <br/>
are.<br/>

I can see why you think that, but what we&#39;re TRYING so hard to explain is <br/>
that it is all about unschooling and helping people avoid anything that isn&#39;t <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
It&#39;s not just for die hard unschoolers, how else would I have learned and <br/>
learned and learned until I &quot;got it&quot;?<br/>
The point is, DON&#39;T defend what is NOT unschooling on an unschooling list. <br/>
Your ideas will be torn apart. Not you, not you personally at all. Your IDEAS.<br/>
If people want to learn, they ask, others answer and you take what you like <br/>
from the answers.<br/>
If you want to defend things that are NOT unschooling, it isn&#39;t going to fly <br/>
here. That&#39;s all.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;In what ways are we to influence our children? At all? &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES! Of course we do, just by how we live every day of our lives.<br/>
A parent that is very curious about the world around them, interested in <br/>
whatever comes along, passionate about their own interests, passionate about <br/>
learning in general is the best kind of unschooler in my opinion.<br/>
My own attitude about learning is a huge factor.<br/>
I often start projects that interest me and in only moments I have four <br/>
smaller people asking &quot;what are you doing Mom?&quot; &quot;how does that work?&quot; and <br/>
such.<br/>
I believe it is our job, our duty, to expose children to as much of the <br/>
world/people/ideas/beliefs as possible.<br/>
How can they find their passions if they don&#39;t even know what is out there?<br/>
<br/>
If you have a math phobia or any other wall in your learning due to pressure <br/>
from school (or any other bad experience) I think it is your job to get over <br/>
it.<br/>
To find ways to make that topic joyful to you. Explore things with the <br/>
abandon of a toddler, with ZEAL! That has made the biggest difference in our <br/>
own household...MY attitude about learning and exploring the whole wide world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944153702">Try to think of it this way: suppose you&#39;re about to have a baby and you<br/>
join a breastfeeding list.  In the intro, you announce how excited you<br/>
are and that you plan to do a combination of breastfeeding and<br/>
bottlefeeding, because you know breastfeeding is wonderful but it&#39;s not<br/>
quite right for your family and your husband wants to feed the baby too,<br/>
etc etc.  So your plan is to breastfeed during the day while your<br/>
husband is at work and then when he gets home, you plan to spend some<br/>
time to yourself while he watches and feeds the baby, and at night<br/>
you&#39;ll alternate.  One night you&#39;ll breastfeed and the next night you&#39;ll<br/>
let your husband get up and bottlefeed the baby.<br/>
 <br/>
Now imagine what the breastfeeding mothers are likely to say.  That you<br/>
can&#39;t introduce any other type of nipple if your goal is breastfeeding,<br/>
that you won&#39;t build up your milk supply if you use formula, that it<br/>
will be harmful to the breastfeeding relationship to breastfeed one<br/>
night and let your husband bottlefeed the next (not to mention how much<br/>
your breasts will hurt when you wake up after the second night!).<br/>
 <br/>
You could go on and on about how they have no right to judge your<br/>
choices and that you know what&#39;s right for your family and that there<br/>
are lots of people who use a combination of breast and bottle.  And<br/>
they&#39;ll still tell you that what you&#39;re planning to do is dangerous to<br/>
the breastfeeding relationship, will probably fail, and within six weeks<br/>
or sooner you&#39;re going to be saying breastfeeding didn&#39;t work for you<br/>
and you&#39;re completely bottlefeeding.  That&#39;s what&#39;s going on with this<br/>
list.  Alternating between curriculum and unschooling is as damaging to<br/>
unschooling as alternating between formula and breastmilk is to<br/>
breastfeeding.  And having that curriculum &quot;just in case unschooling<br/>
doesn&#39;t work&quot; is as damaging as having bottles filled with formula &quot;just<br/>
in case you don&#39;t make enough milk&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1752013634">Hmmm…  It won’t work to give him softer tub toys – he gets things from<br/>
the rest of the house and takes them to the bathroom to drop in or bang<br/>
on the side of the tub.  If he starts doing that I could replace the<br/>
loud toy with a softer one, but I’m certain that would lead to a<br/>
meltdown.  I can’t keep the bathroom closed because that’s where the cat<br/>
litter is.<br/>

And with the fish tank he SCREAMS if you try to hold his hands.  But I<br/>
could pick him up and hold him a few feet away, he’d probably be ok with<br/>
that if I remained standing while we talked about the fish.<br/>

activity <br/>
instead of forbidding one.  And about saying &quot;Yes, sometime&quot; or &quot;yes, <br/>

If the thing you hold out is attractive, he&#39;ll drop what he has to reach for <br/>

That&#39;s the best baby-trick I ever learned.  If a baby has a knife or scissors <br/>

For some people it&#39;s real hard not to automatically say no when you see a<br/>

with no&#39;s and hear it from so many others every day. Ever go to the grocery<br/>

the child was doing. Instead of just saying no and then give an explanation.<br/>
Like oh sweetie are you looking at the fish and trying to get their<br/>
attention? Are you playing drums on the fishy tank today? Anything so you<br/>
get your childs attention without a no. Then maybe you can put some fish<br/>
flakes in the lid of the container and help your son feed the fish. Then you<br/>
could hug him while you watch them eat and he can&#39;t bang on the tank. Which<br/>
could lead you to asking him if he&#39;s hungry or he could come and help you<br/>
make something because now you are hungry too. Or how about seeing some<br/>
other fish and go find a book or plastic fish to play with. Kids are pretty<br/>

<br/>
We (a radical unschooling family) have a rule- if it is out- it is FAIR<br/>
GAME.<br/>
<br/>
We didnt/dont say no to my baby.  The trust thing that everyone is always<br/>
talking about on this list works for babies too.  You might be surprized to<br/>
know my baby even explored knives and scissors.  And just tonight was<br/>
cutting up a bunch of hard boiled eggs with a seven inch steel knife (he is<br/>
2.5 now).  They care even more for their safety than you do- and they are<br/>
ALWAYS with themselves!  They also can know themselves and their abilities<br/>
and interests WAY WAY more than this society gives them credit for.<br/>
(we can train this awareness out of them - we pretty much &quot;school&quot; (direct,<br/>
coerse, control, &quot;teach&quot;, mistrust, etc.) our babies in this society).<br/>
<br/>
about the fish tank- you can try all the distraction techniques - or you can<br/>
just pay no attention and when he has learned enough from it, he will stop-<br/>
almost ALWAYS quicker than trying to coerce him to stop.<br/>
<br/>
However, you might be dealing with him knowing he gets negative (NO NO) or<br/>
positive ( look at this sweety!) attention from the behavior, in which case,<br/>
it will take him banging on the fish tank and looking to you, and you<br/>
showing no response (just pleasantly minding your own business), and him<br/>
banging MORE, and looking to you, and you still minding your own business<br/>
(thinking to yourself &quot;this shock is nothing compared to bringing them home<br/>
from the fish store&quot;, and maybe him banging more, until he starts to<br/>
experience it without thinking of you- and then he will stop.  he will move<br/>
on to new things to learn about.<br/>
