<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537775976">Hi  Heidi (and all) This is so familiar to me.  I have a dd 14 who is editing a book that she has written (I think it&#39;s 427 pages now), and she has it planned out to be a trilogy.  When she was 10 I could not interest her in reading anything until I bought every &quot;Pokiman&quot; book I could find.  From there she jumped to Tolkien and adores him.  Tolkien led to Medieval History and this led to a desire to write her own book of fantasy.  She is very dedicated to this and can&#39;t wait to try to get it published.  She has developed a love of History,  medieval weapons, fantasy, geography, and who knows what else thanks to Tolkien.  Of course &quot;Pokiman&quot; started her interest in reading.  I always tell people it doesn&#39;t matter what they read as long as they read, they will branch out on their own. <br/>

  It started with her reading Tolkien, from there into a love for <br/>
  Medieval history, and early English literature, including Chaucer and <br/>
  of course, Shakespeare. She&#39;s got several monologues memorized, and <br/>
  opens on Saturday night as Narissa, from A Merchant of Venice. <br/>
  Because she started reading Tolkien when she was 7ish. <br/>
<br/>
  Besides Shakespeare, this kid has forgotten more about English <br/>
  history than I&#39;ve ever known, from pre-Norman days through the <br/>
  Tudors. She also knows a bit about Norse mythology...thank you <br/>
  Tolkien! <br/>
