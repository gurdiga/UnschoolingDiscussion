&lt;&lt; I would say something about reading all the time.  We read LOTS of books, <br/>
 about dinosaurs, space, we read the math problems he does, and he has <br/>
learned <br/>
 TONS about the sports he is interested in....  He will soon &quot;break the code&quot; <br/>
 for reading himself, and then he will take off even more.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thats a great answer, Mary.  THANKS<br/>
