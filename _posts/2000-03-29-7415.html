&gt;      My son is an only child, and when the cable was on I think he used the <br/>
&gt;tv alot for company. His friends are all in school during the day and we <br/>
&gt;have met very few unschoolers in Topeka, KS. Does anyone else have a &quot;lonely <br/>
&gt;only&quot;? How do you deal with it? My husband and I did not choose to not have <br/>
&gt;more children, we have just been unable. It was amiracle that we got Gary. <br/>
&gt;We might adopt someday but are not financially able now.<br/>

<br/>
This subject could not have been raised at a more perfect time, since this<br/>
is the issue I am struggling with right now. My son will be 7 next month<br/>
and this has been our first year officially homeschooling. He has been<br/>
feeling more lonely lately, and has been turning back to the TV as a<br/>
result. He has expressed that  there is nobody to play with because<br/>
&quot;everyone else is in school&quot;, and that he wished he had a friend around all<br/>
the time. We have joined two homeschooling groups and participate in<br/>
several regular activities, but I think he misses a daily or one-on-one<br/>
friendship with someone other than me. We haven&#39;t had many playdates with<br/>
other homeschoolers because they all have their own busy schedules, and a<br/>
lot of the kids are older by 2-3 years. Plus, there aren&#39;t any other kids<br/>
his age in the neighborhood and his best friend from school last year has<br/>
become distant; they don&#39;t seem to share the same interests anymore. He<br/>
hasn&#39;t really complained too much about wanting more friends until this<br/>
spring. I think it&#39;s because a lot of our regular activities are ending for<br/>
the year. Perhaps I am overly sensitive to how he feels because I was an<br/>
only myself. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t always provide him with a friend for<br/>
all our field trips and outdoor activities. <br/>

That is the way my 5 yr old son is. He&#39;s an only child. Most of the time he <br/>
won&#39;t even want to paint without me! I try not to dwell on him being <br/>
dependent, and I just jump in if I have time. Sometimes he just needs a <br/>
start with me and I can leave him. I think he sees me as a friend to play <br/>
with, too. Not just a provider or a guider!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is usually true for us as well. So I feel badly when basic household<br/>
duties (cooking, cleaning) leave him with large blocks of alone time.<br/>
(Although I know kids need plenty of free time to think and be bored too.)<br/>
Sometimes I try to make suggestions for things that he can do to occupy his<br/>
time (he reads well but won&#39;t yet sit down and read alone), but he rejects<br/>
them all and turns on the TV. I say no TV and he turns it back on. I think<br/>
I&#39;m going to need to pull the plug or remove the TV for a while to break<br/>
the habit. It&#39;s my own fault for turning the TV on 7 years ago! I have<br/>
tried putting aside the household stuff and offering to do anything he<br/>
wants (games, puzzles, etc.), but lately he seems to prefer TV watching. Is<br/>
this just a phase of homeschooling, or is it a function of being an only<br/>
child homeschooling without benefit of sibling play? I&#39;m hoping this is<br/>
just a spring slump before a surge of new interests.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but I just needed to worry and wonder out loud here...<br/>
