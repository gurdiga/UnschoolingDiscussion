<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865748473">I shouldn&#39;t have been so cavalier about spider bites.  Probably as with ants <br/>
and bees and wasps, I&#39;m guessing, some people are probably way more sensitive <br/>
and at risk for one reason or another.  I get really irritated and <br/>
uncomfortable but it didn&#39;t disable me.<br/>
