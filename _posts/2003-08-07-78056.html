  **Holly saw a &quot;sneak preview&quot; last night and got a free t-shirt.  She was not <br/>
  prepared to like it, out of loyalty to the older version, but she LOVED it.**<br/>
  Ditto for me.<br/>
<br/>
  I really was only going for the girls,  they wanted to go.  <br/>
<br/>
  I remember going to the original when I was like 10 or 12 yrs old.  I shared with the girls that it was so popular and the theater was so packed that I didn&#39;t get to sit with whoever it was that I went with.  Which was kind-of weird for me at that age.<br/>
<br/>
  I really liked the new one too.  It surprised me.<br/>
<br/>
  Now we are going to bunk down in the basement and watch the old one.   Boy does it bring back memories!  <br/>
<br/>
  We had a great day.  :)<br/>
