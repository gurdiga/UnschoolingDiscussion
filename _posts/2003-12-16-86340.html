<div id="ygrps-yiv-1663175609">First of all I want to say thanks to the person who had posted that link to the eBook of The Prophet. I&#39;ve skimmed through it, read a couple more passages here and there and as much as I was struck by the writing &quot;On Children&quot; I have been regarding &quot;On Teaching&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I thought I&#39;d share it for those who may not have read it, it seems to me to fit very well with unschooling. I&#39;m going to print this out, rewrite it onto card-stock, maybe illustrate it, and frame it. <br/>
 <br/>
****************************************************************************************************<br/>
 <br/>
Then said a teacher, &quot;Speak to us of Teaching.&quot; <br/>
And he said: <br/>
No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in the dawning of our knowledge. <br/>
The teacher who walks in the shadow of the temple, among his followers, gives not of his wisdom but rather of his faith and his lovingness. <br/>
If he is indeed wise he does not bid you enter the house of wisdom, but rather leads you to the threshold of your own mind. <br/>
The astronomer may speak to you of his understanding of space, but he cannot give you his understanding. <br/>
The musician may sing to you of the rhythm which is in all space, but he cannot give you the ear which arrests the rhythm nor the voice that echoes it. <br/>
And he who is versed in the science of numbers can tell of the regions of weight and measure, but he cannot conduct you thither. <br/>
For the vision of one man lends not its wings to another man. <br/>
And even as each one of you stands alone in God&#39;s knowledge, so must each one of you be alone in his knowledge of God and in his understanding of the earth. <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660871433">I read a LOT of Gibran when I was a teenager, and I re-read The Prophet over <br/>
and over.  I loved the one on Jesus, too, &quot;Jesus, the Son of Man.&quot;   <br/>
Beautiful, beautiful stuff.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was worried about it.  He didn&#39;t like that book title.  He thought it <br/>
should be &quot;son of God.&quot;  I soothed him and pointed out Bible truths.  He was <br/>
nervous about my soul.  <br/>
<br/>
Lebanon&#39;s officially Christian, and Gibran was Christian, but he sure wasn&#39;t <br/>
Southern Baptist!   I love his writing because it&#39;s like poetry, but it&#39;s not. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;No man can reveal to you aught but that which already lies half asleep in <br/>
the dawning of our knowledge. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It fit right in with the open classroom and the cognition classes I was <br/>
taking in college too.   It seemed so much like truth, and the traditional messages <br/>
around me seemed so punitive and cold.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163978024">I forwarded this to a friend I have recently reconnected with after four years, and it turns out that my friend is well familiar with Gibran&#39;s writings, was glad to hear I&#39;d found them because he&#39;d been about to suggest them to me..!<br/>
