<div id="ygrps-yiv-1094187018">I am not sure how we would &quot;classify&quot; ourselves.  We frequently and publicly <br/>
say that we believe all people are learning all the time with or without <br/>
direct instruction.  Privately, we debate how much or little we should <br/>
intervene (when one of our children does not recognize the alphabet, for <br/>
instance.)  Usually we decide it&#39;s way to early to be concerned and we just <br/>
heighten our awareness for opportunity.  We like the idea of classes and <br/>
instruction by others (i.e, karate instruction or a special arts program) but <br/>
only if our son wants to participate.  As parents we love learning all kinds <br/>
of new things so we&#39;re frequently aware of opportunities because of our <br/>
interests.  Finally, there are times we do get more focused and structured <br/>
but I fear it is due to our insecurity rather than a need on the part of the <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest is 6 and I&#39;ve been thinking a lot lately about mathematics and <br/>
what our approach might be.  Imposing worksheets and algorithms will never <br/>
ever work IMO with our 6 yr old.  I also have a bias against arithmetic and <br/>
mathematics being learned out of context of any practical application.  <br/>
However, I am skeptical that much mathematical grounding is occurring with <br/>
the sporadic questions about price and time and height etc.  I think my <br/>
approach will be to lay low and hang back for now but keep my eyes open for a <br/>
(math related) project we can fall in love with.  Then we&#39;ll take that as far <br/>
as we care to.<br/>

&lt;&lt; one more abstract thought... i wonder how many of you <br/>
 have an unschooling <br/>
 approach that reflects the active learning, conscious <br/>
