The toddler stage is definately one of my favorite stages!   My biggest piece of advise would be to just stop and enjoy.  Don&#39;t feel that you have to have alot of activities scheduled.  Usually children that age like to take it slow and explore.  Like when they go on walks and have to stop every two steps to examine something interesting on the ground...stop with him and look too.  When he asks &quot;why&quot; (a toddlers favorite question) and you don&#39;t know research the answer together.  It will do him good to see that adults don&#39;t know everything and also where to look for answers.  He will open up your world and make you wonder again, if you allow it. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753013083">Hi Eileen,<br/>
My kids are also little.  7, 5 and 3.  We are unschoolers, and we really mostly play.  I have tried structured things occasionally, but realized unless it was something they really wanted to do and had begged to do, I should just save my time.<br/>
I am learning that I just need to follow them.  If I don&#39;t, we all suffer.  It isn&#39;t easy though.<br/>
It is a fun time of life though, so just play alot!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549109701">I agree with everyone so far, just allow lots of time for play, free and <br/>
unstructured play especially.  At three I didn&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything in the way<br/>
of structure or specific educational value.  We mostly still just play (95%) <br/>
unstructured and my children are 6 1/2, 5 and 2.  My dd is teaching <br/>

minutes of counting/adding is a lot -- when you are in the backyard and <br/>
having fun playing Monopoly and it sort of &quot;comes up.&quot;  If you don&#39;t have to <br/>
spend 10 minutes lining up to go to the backyard and then back into the house <br/>
and wait for 20 other  kids to get settled down and listen to lots of <br/>
material that does not apply to you, then 10 minutes is enough (maybe too <br/>
much -- I do get carried away sometimes).<br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes people forget how convenient it is to hs/unschool.  You do <br/>
things as they arise -- that means it fits your schedule, by definition. <br/>
<br/>
My son wanted to confirm his understanding of adding negative numbers this <br/>
morning.  So he asked me about it.  I was starting a load of laundry and <br/>
having a cup of coffee and getting my daughter&#39;s cereal, but . . . he didn&#39;t <br/>
have to wait until it was &quot;math time&quot; -- he just asked, gave his examples, we <br/>
talked, the whole conversation took, maybe, one minute.  But it could have <br/>
been dragged out to a half hour or longer in an institutional setting.  So to <br/>
get this one grain of information, my son would have had to spend a whole lot <br/>
more of his valuable time waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway . . .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62128772">It really works and our youngest who is now 7 is a real good example.  She<br/>
taught herself to spell and then read (yes, in that order) by watching<br/>
Wheel of Fortune of all things.  And, she did this when she was about 4. <br/>
We only found this out because eldest at home kidlet was working on some<br/>
project or other and asked me how to spell &quot;encyclopedia.&quot;  She chimes in<br/>
with e-n-cy-c-lo-pedia.  I thought, o.k., Disney and Jiminy Cricket.  Then<br/>
a little later he hollers down from his room wanting us to spell something<br/>
else and she knew that one too and it was NOT something she could have<br/>
learned from singing her tapes.  Soooo, when we picked our jaws up off the<br/>
floor, we asked and she said she saw it on the Wheel.<br/>
<br/>
Which is a long way to saying that they learn buckets more than we realise<br/>
simply by playing.<br/>
