<div id="ygrps-yiv-472573157">Thanks Amy,<br/>
I know I seem to be going way too fast just that I was so completely thrown <br/>
off guard by the whole situation. My mom Never explained anything to us so I <br/>
think my sisters and I tend to go overboard on certain subjects. Especially <br/>
the kind &quot;you dont talk about, its just not nice.) Glad I grew up in the 80s <br/>
and the info wasnt hard to come by even if I would have rathered  hear it <br/>
from mom. Anyway I think your right that she dosnt need a Dr. right now, and <br/>
Im so relieved to hear you say that because getting her into the Dr. office <br/>
of the ped. she has had since she was 2 is a process. She really hates it. <br/>
She wont even pee in the cup, we have to bring it home. I also do not think <br/>
it is an injury as she tends to be somewhat of a hypercondriac(sp) (thats <br/>
just my way of saying she loves to make sure I tend to all her boo bos.) She <br/>
definately would have said something to me. And as for utis and fisures Im <br/>
not sure so I think well just keep and eye on it and see if we need to see <br/>
the DR. <br/>
Thanks for keeping me grounded.<br/>
I really appreciate it.<br/>

     You said that so well.  I was going to say I would not recommend that a <br/>
child of 8 1/2 use tampons when they are not good for anyone!  I was also <br/>
going to say that some studies show that a diet of dairy products and meats <br/>
can lead to early puberty.  This is due to all of the hormones that are <br/>
injected into the cows.  Jackie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141840584">I&#39;m just curios to know... how many of the people that are against the use<br/>
of tampons use or have used disposable diapers on their children?  It is a<br/>
fact that the chemical in the gel used to make disp. diapers so absorbant is<br/>
the same chemical that was removed from tampons in 1988 because it was<br/>
linked to TSS. And we have this pressing against our children&#39;s reproductive<br/>
oragans 24/7? I don&#39;t want anyone to think this is a personal slam. It&#39;s<br/>
not. I use them for my kids from time to time. I&#39;m just saying that perhaps<br/>
we should rethink our stance from time to time. FYI this gel is also the<br/>
same one that is used to coat Tylenol and other gel caps. Is it really<br/>
objective to make blanket statements about the use of tampons when we all<br/>
can&#39;t be so noble to say we&#39;ve never used any of these other products. I<br/>
hate conflict and don&#39;t want anyone to think I&#39;m looking for a fight. I just<br/>
think we all need to examine oue daily practices  a liitle closer.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Well, I started at 9, back in the dark ages (50&#39;s) as did several other<br/>
&gt; members of my family.  So, some<br/>
&gt; pre-spotting prior to that age doesn&#39;t sound too out there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, as to the tampons.  That whole business about it being o.k. is simply<br/>
&gt; manufacturers trying to get more customers.  When I went through the<br/>
&gt; classes back in the dark ages, we were told they were definately not o.k.<br/>
&gt; for anyone who wasn&#39;t sexually active and were really not designed for<br/>
&gt; anyone who hadn&#39;t had a child yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We now know that they contain Dioxin and this push for younger and younger<br/>
&gt; girls to use tampons would seem to correlate with the increase in various<br/>
&gt; cancers and the younger and younger age that women are getting cancer<br/>
&gt; (ovarian, cervical, uterine and breast).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, this is really weird because this seems to be a topic on several<br/>
lists<br/>
&gt; right now so I have my whole Dioxin speel down.  Dioxin is in the top 10<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; known carcenogens.  It is the &quot;evil&quot; from Love Canal, etc.  It is fat<br/>
&gt; soluable, not water soluable which means it resides in fatty tissues and<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; found in humans, mammals, birds and fish and seeks them out, so to speak.<br/>
&gt; Dioxin is the by-product of the bleaching process that cotton goes through<br/>
&gt; and is residual.  Rayon is also another problem as are the chemicals that<br/>
&gt; are put in tampons.  There are unbleached tampons available that are<br/>
&gt; chemical free.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; &gt; This board has been quiet for a while. But I hope all you supportive<br/>
moms<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere near your computers. I am having a Mother Moment I think and<br/>
&gt; need<br/>
&gt; &gt; some real good advice soon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; okay here is the situation.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My dd is 81/2.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Over the weekend while she was at my girlfriends house, I went on a<br/>
&gt; cleaning<br/>
&gt; &gt; spree. In the process I found a pair of undies that I just bought for<br/>
her<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; last weekend, rolled in a ball under her bed. There was signs of<br/>
&gt; &quot;spotting&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; on them .<br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay I know this is normal but 81/2? Isnt that a bit young , I was 11<br/>
&gt; myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; my sisters were both 14, my bestfriend was almost 16. Although I believe<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; husbands sisters were younger than that?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway I asked her about it and she seemed to not know what I was<br/>
talking<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; about. I told her it was okay to tell me , even if it was a little<br/>
&gt; &gt; embarrassing but she insisted so I didnt push the issue. I called my<br/>
&gt; &gt; bestfriend who has a 12yod that went through this over the summer. Her<br/>
10<br/>
&gt; yod<br/>
&gt; &gt; just had a class on this in school she had some booklets tha she gave me<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bring home to my dd. which I did and she read them on her own , I left<br/>
&gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; out for her. when I asked her about it , she said &quot;Mom that is sick!&quot;  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to make light of it and giggled and said I know but do you have<br/>
any<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; questions? She said no and I thought maybe I should drop the subject for<br/>
&gt; now<br/>
&gt; &gt; .What do you guys think? I know shes a bit young to be able to grasp<br/>
this<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; concept , so I dont want to freak her out, but at the same time I want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; make sure she knows what shes doing too. She absolutely hates to go to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Drs. and I think she is too young for that kind of Dr. Does anyone<br/>
agree?<br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; booklet also said that its okay to use Tampons for swimming, ?????? For<br/>
&gt; an 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; yo? I think not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anybody have answers or ideas as to handle this situation?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; HELP!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; Not ready Mom<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2066176203">Tamie, I just read this post and need to back up some but thought from the<br/>
sounds of this one, you could use a book title that has been wonderful for<br/>
my daughter its from the American Girl Library collection it is called the<br/>
care and keeping of you the body book for girls.  it covers washing, eating<br/>
healthy and periods including how to use pads and tampons  along with pics<br/>
to help, it in my opinion is not to graphic, but very very helpful, when my<br/>
daughter started she had 0 questions for me and knew just what products she<br/>
wanted and how to use them properly she has been very comfortable with it<br/>
from day one and I think this book played a major part in it she reads the<br/>
book over and over I think just for self assurance.<br/>
good luck, now I will go back and read your original post!<br/>

 For those that don&#39;t have a store that carries the organic tampons and<br/>
 pads, you can order them from Harmony.  Their website is www.gaiam.com<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
