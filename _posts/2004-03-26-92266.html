<div id="ygrps-yiv-728587780">My 8.5 yo daughter asked me how the United States was formed and became free.  I used to have a link in my favorites to a really cool flash presentation on the timeline of how the US was formed.  Since moving I have lost that link.  Can anyone help me with a site that would be suitable for her age or other neat resources?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Look down at the bottom of that page, to the link <br/>
&quot;User&#39;s Guide for the Declaration of Independence!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Clicking takes you to  www.founding.com It has a<br/>
timeline, the &quot;user&#39;s guide&quot; ( I find that very<br/>
amusing, don&#39;t know why!)  and other good stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-249292150">You&#39;re welcome!  Good thing I had sent in that link to<br/>
unschooling-resources, and could find it in the<br/>
archives,  or I would never have been able to find it,<br/>
it was not in my favorites!  <br/>
<br/>
Does it go under social studies or history, I wonder? <br/>
Havta manage all those links I have in some method of<br/>
madness.lol I should start sending em into<br/>
Unschooling-resources, besides spam,  that list is<br/>
dead.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe those who have been talking about video games<br/>
could send in some links?  My son would love it if I<br/>
could forward them to him, and it might get the list<br/>
going a little, and not take up time on this list?  <br/>
