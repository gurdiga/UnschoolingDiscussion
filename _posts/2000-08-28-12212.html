<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935308687">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
Some very good news to report from Japan today!<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s edition (Aug. 28) of the Asahi Evening News, an English-language <br/>
daily paper with nationwide circulation, features a wonderful spread on <br/>
its Education page about home-based learning. The spread fills about <br/>
two-thirds of the whole page.<br/>
<br/>
There are two stories in the spread. The main one is a translation of an <br/>
earlier Asahi Shimbun Japanese-language story. This story includes quotes <br/>
from Yoshiko Kubo, a Japanese veteran homelearning parent near Tokyo, as <br/>
well as from Kyoko Aizawa of the Otherwise Japan group in Tokyo. The <br/>
overall tone of the story comes across as positive and respectful of <br/>
homelearning in Japan, despite a couple of misleading points about the <br/>
so-called &quot;difficulties&quot; and &quot;illegality&quot; of home-based learning in this <br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
The spread also features a sidebar story written by yours truly. It&#39;s a <br/>
first-person account of why and how our family does homelearning in <br/>
Japan. I don&#39;t remember seeing any other such stories in Japan&#39;s <br/>
English-language press -- that is, original articles written by a <br/>
homelearner FOR homelearners) in recent times, so this may well be the <br/>
first in Japan. Let us hope it is by no means the last.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are excerpts from the two stories:<br/>
<br/>
(1)<br/>
More and more parents are rejecting the idea of sending their children to <br/>
school, and are instead taking direct responsibility for educating them <br/>
at home.<br/>
<br/>
As homeschooling gradually wins broader acceptance here, a community <br/>
movement is building to provide support for parents who choose to go down <br/>
this route. As well, even an Education Ministry advisory group has <br/>
recommended support for &quot;learning in the home.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(2)<br/>
For our family, homeschooling as a way of life began last year on a beach <br/>
in northern California during a summer break away from Japan, after my <br/>
5-year-old son and I were invited to join a &quot;support group&quot; of <br/>
homeschooling families on one of their regular outings.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve noted often in the past, the Japanese news media is becoming <br/>
increasingly open to homelearning as a serious alternative to mainstream <br/>
schooling. The Asahi spread today is further proof of that. The climate <br/>
for press coverage of homelearning these days may well be more hospitable <br/>
in Japanese society at this early stage than in other countries where <br/>
homelearning is more firmly established.<br/>
<br/>
Why is that? Well, when in doubt, look close to home: News media people <br/>
in Japan have families of their own, and they are no doubt struggling <br/>
with the same kinds of educational problems that everyone else in society <br/>
is struggling with. Covering homelearning -- overseas and domestically -- <br/>
as a legitimate news story allows reporters and editors in Japan to <br/>
explore the wild idea of alternative education for their own families as <br/>
well. <br/>
<br/>
Things may change as time goes on and homelearning in Japan becomes less <br/>
of a novelty and more of a threat to the educational powers-that-be (as <br/>
it most certainly will). But for now, the climate for press coverage of <br/>
homelearning issues in Japan is good.<br/>
<br/>
My deepest hope is that more Japanese families will be encouraged, after <br/>
reading these two Asahi articles, to indeed seriously consider home-based <br/>
learning as an alternative to conventional schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Just my humble contribution to The Cause, of course....<br/>
<br/>
