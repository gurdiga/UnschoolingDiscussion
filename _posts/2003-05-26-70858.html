I had a decent small business going oh half.com. That would be where you list the books.<br/>
Shipping is included in the final price. Half.com (or Amazon) will figure out the shipping.<br/>
A few tips;<br/>
make sure you are very sure about the ISBN & the edition<br/>
I&#39;ve had books returned because the buyer wanted this edition but got that edition. Many customers do not check ISBNs and editions.<br/>
If you can&#39;t find the book at half.com; check out Amazon - I&#39;ve sold many books and videos there.<br/>
<br/>
Be very honest about the books & the condition.<br/>
If you are a non-smoking home - say so.<br/>
I used these phrases;<br/>
read once<br/>
non-smoking home<br/>
gently read<br/>
ready to ship<br/>
read once otherwise brand new<br/>
<br/>
If there are creases - say so<br/>
if there are folds - say so<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241322261">We have had a great time both buying and selling. Sometimes there are<br/>
shipping snafu&#39;s when something is coming from Canada. Another way to<br/>
sell used books is Amazon.com. Check to see if the book is available<br/>
new, and then you can sell it used for less. They help set the prices<br/>
and with descriptions. On E-bay set shipping $$ by looking at other<br/>
peoples for sale offerings - don&#39;t forget it is handling too, the time<br/>
it takes to pack up the book and go to the post office, so it is usually<br/>
a round figure rather than the exact cost of the stamps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-147496188">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this; which is better? I&#39;ve sold items on both eBay and Half.com.<br/>
I guess for books, videos and cds, half.com is better.....but I&#39;ve sold autographed books on eBay....I sold an autographed Douglas Adams book for $42.00; I never would have gotten that on half.com. The problem with ebay is you pay whether you sell or not. On Half.com, you pay only if and when you sell.<br/>
<br/>
What is your store address??<br/>
May I see it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006316825">I&#39;ve actually sold several things on ebay and currently have several<br/>
things that I just listed.  What I usually do is try to find out how<br/>
much something weighs (since that&#39;s the way that the post office<br/>
calculates postage).  I used to have a post office across the street<br/>
from me with a scale so it was easy.  Now, I package what I&#39;m selling<br/>
in a shipping box (which you can get for free from the usps website)<br/>
and put it on the bathroom scale.  Then I go to the usps website and<br/>
calculate the postage from my zip code to any other zip code (usually<br/>
I use a zip code that is farthest from me).  That&#39;s the postage that I<br/>
list on ebay.  <br/>
<br/>
I have seen some listings (and have done the same things on some of my<br/>
auctions) where they just say that they will give a quote on postage<br/>
if someone emails them.  Then you can weigh the item and give them the<br/>
exact cost of shipping.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps and good luck (we&#39;ve made quite a bit of extra money<br/>
in this way)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087226691">I forgot about Amazon.com for selling used books.  I&#39;ve sold many<br/>
books that way and it works great.  Just click on the I have a copy to<br/>
sell link and fill out the form.  Then you are notified by email when<br/>
someone purchases your book and the shipping is already figured for<br/>
you.  MUCH easier to do it that way then ebay but, you don&#39;t always<br/>
get as much money.  Just depends on the book.  On Amazon, you list the<br/>
price you&#39;re willing to sell the book for and that it, no bidding.<br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] Re: How to sell on ebay?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve actually sold several things on ebay and currently have several<br/>
  things that I just listed.  What I usually do is try to find out how<br/>
  much something weighs (since that&#39;s the way that the post office<br/>
  calculates postage).  I used to have a post office across the street<br/>
  from me with a scale so it was easy.  Now, I package what I&#39;m selling<br/>
  in a shipping box (which you can get for free from the usps website)<br/>
  and put it on the bathroom scale.  Then I go to the usps website and<br/>
  calculate the postage from my zip code to any other zip code (usually<br/>
  I use a zip code that is farthest from me).  That&#39;s the postage that I<br/>
  list on ebay.  <br/>
<br/>
  I have seen some listings (and have done the same things on some of my<br/>
  auctions) where they just say that they will give a quote on postage<br/>
  if someone emails them.  Then you can weigh the item and give them the<br/>
  exact cost of shipping.<br/>
<br/>
  Hope this helps and good luck (we&#39;ve made quite a bit of extra money<br/>
  in this way)<br/>

  I forgot about Amazon.com for selling used books.  I&#39;ve sold many<br/>
  books that way and it works great.  Just click on the I have a copy to<br/>
  sell link and fill out the form.  Then you are notified by email when<br/>
  someone purchases your book and the shipping is already figured for<br/>
  you.  MUCH easier to do it that way then ebay but, you don&#39;t always<br/>
  get as much money.  Just depends on the book.  On Amazon, you list the<br/>
  price you&#39;re willing to sell the book for and that it, no bidding.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650251217">Go to usps.com, at the top of the page there is a link titled Buy<br/>
stamps and shop (click on it), at the middle of the next page under<br/>

of links, highlight shipping supplies and click on personal use, then<br/>
order whatever you need.  I promise that they are free.  You have to<br/>
order in multiples of 10 and 25 (depending on the box you want).  When<br/>
you get your first order, I remember that there was a form I had to<br/>
sign saying that I was actually using the boxes for shipping and not<br/>
some other purpose (moving?) and that was it.  You can get any size<br/>
boxes, labels and stickers too.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes all say Express and Priority Mail.  If you don&#39;t want to<br/>
ship that way just wrap the box in brown shipping paper and send it<br/>
regular.  You&#39;ll probably want to send the books Media Mail since that<br/>
is soooo much cheaper than regular mail.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-732054741">Amazon has a set shipping dollar amount that they charge people.  You<br/>
don&#39;t have to package it up or weigh it in advance.  And, if it costs<br/>
less than the amount they charged, you get to keep the difference.  Of<br/>
course, if it costs more, you have to make up the difference.  But,<br/>
I&#39;ve never had it cost more.  Usually it is less.<br/>

wrapped in heavy brown paper, not boxed.  I&#39;ve also seen manilla<br/>

We get such an immense quantity of stuff coming in to the house that we<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about this; which is better? I&#39;ve sold items on both eBay <br/>
and Half.com.<br/>
<br/>
I guess for books, videos and cds, half.com is better.....but I&#39;ve sold <br/>
autographed books on eBay....I sold an autographed Douglas Adams book for $42.00; I <br/>
never would have gotten that on half.com. The problem with ebay is you pay <br/>
whether you sell or not. On Half.com, you pay only if and when you sell.<br/>
<br/>
What is your store address?? May I see it?&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Actually you can get into big trouble for altering a USPS box! We have a USPS <br/>
account and they do not allow this and if a customer happens to complain you <br/>
can&#39;t get out of it. We had a couple of store owners on ebay get in trouble <br/>
for doing just that and even worse turning the boxes inside out which is <br/>
illegal. It may be cheaper but it is not worth anyone getting in trouble by breaking <br/>
the law.<br/>

They come flat and  you can fold them inside out, plain brown.<br/>
Sandra&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is altering their (USPS) property and is considered to be illegal if you <br/>
do that or if someone who you send an item to turns you in. Wish we could do <br/>
that, it is much easier to have the customers pay for shipping that way <br/>
nothing comes out of our pockets and we&#39;re not breaking the law.<br/>

<br/>
I just sold two Konos volumes.  I listed them with the &quot;buy it now&quot; feature and they sold like hotcakes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still very new to all of this, but it seems like it would depend on how much you expect to get for them.<br/>
<br/>
I made an instant 110.00 overnight.  I tried listing them with Half.com but you can&#39;t do it without an ISBN or UPC, neither of which these books had.  WHen I did a search for title, they didin&#39;t have that either so I couldn&#39;t even list it.<br/>
<br/>
Amazon wanted a 15% commission.<br/>
<br/>
Ebay charged me $1.40 for the listing and will get a commission, but it isn&#39;t much.  I thought it seemed like a pretty good deal, considering how much the books sold for.  I listed with Pay pal as an option and didn&#39;t realize I didn&#39;t have to do that and could have avoided the paypal fees associated with &quot;buy it now&quot; but even those fees aren&#39;t that bad, and Buy it Now really helps them sell in my opinion.<br/>

  I&#39;ve been thinking about this; which is better? I&#39;ve sold items on both eBay <br/>
  and Half.com.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess for books, videos and cds, half.com is better.....but I&#39;ve sold <br/>
  autographed books on eBay....I sold an autographed Douglas Adams book for $42.00; I <br/>
  never would have gotten that on half.com. The problem with ebay is you pay <br/>
  whether you sell or not. On Half.com, you pay only if and when you sell.<br/>

This is true, I also have an account and there is actually a disclaimer I <br/>

&gt; I entered an essay contest to win a FARM<br/>

 I just KNOW I will win one one of these days.. I figure my chances at that <br/>
are a lot better than winning the lottery<br/>

&lt;&lt;(When I shop Ebay, I always use Buy it Now.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it depends on what you buy. I am not into Ebay at all and really<br/>
don&#39;t know much about the whole process. But I have some cousins that sell<br/>
mostly clothes on there. They&#39;ve been doing it for years and literally make<br/>
a thousand or more a week between the two families. My cousin told me he<br/>
never lists with the buy it now. He gets a much higher price the other way.<br/>
But like I said, he only really does clothes.<br/>
