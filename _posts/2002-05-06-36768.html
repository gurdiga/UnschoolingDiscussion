&gt;My 3.5 yr old, Shawn, seems to be only really interested in factual books<br/>
&gt;and videos. How &quot;normal&quot; is this? When we go to the library he picks books<br/>
&gt;that are way advanced--which mom and dad have to read--like the Big Book of<br/>
&gt;Bones, and Eyewitness book on Volcanoes and Earthquakes! The videos are the<br/>
&gt;same thing..all about volcanoes, spaceships,animals, mummies, etc. etc. His<br/>
&gt;interests seem oddly diverse for only having been around 3 yrs!!! Has<br/>
 </span></blockquote>anyone<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;else had a child this interested in the realities in the world at such a<br/>
&gt;yound age??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All 4 of my kids loved books like that at a very young age as well as TV<br/>
shows and videos like that. And they still do. They especially like the<br/>
Eyewitness books. Our librarian at the air force base where we live, who is<br/>
a big supporter of homeschooling, knew of my kids love of Eyewitness books,<br/>
and when the library was given a grant she ordered an enormous set of them!<br/>
My kids went crazy checking them out.<br/>
<br/>
Suzanna, who is rather fond of Eyewitness books herself.</div>
