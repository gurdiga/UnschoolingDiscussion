<div id="ygrps-yiv-677053733">Sandra, When I tell my daughter she&#39;s &quot;stuck with me&quot; it&#39;s in the<br/>
context of we, her family, will not abandon her.  No matter what.  She&#39;s<br/>
come up with some rather interesting &quot;Even if...&quot; questions, and<br/>
sometimes that becomes a game, but it&#39;s also very very serious.  With<br/>
her recent query into belief systems (swim team locker room discussions<br/>
with a &quot;fundy&quot; teammate has triggered a rash of conversations!) plus our<br/>
current health issues (my cancer recurrence/current chemo & DH&#39;s<br/>
upcoming major surgery), the &quot;stuck with me&quot; has expanded into<br/>
discussing what will/may happen after death does separate us. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
We&#39;ve had some really amazing talks.  Yes, including running, suicide,<br/>
murder, going to jail, heaven/hell/reincarnation/etc, how would I<br/>
feel/what would I do if she died, she&#39;d like to live with Aunt P but<br/>
Aunt P&#39;s even older and what if she dies, wills & inheritance, oh my, on<br/>
and on.  Addressing a lot of things, curiosity, security, laws, her<br/>
sib&#39;s trials growing up (one legal name change at 18) and my own (my<br/>
father died when I was 4), what it takes (& means) to earn a living...<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; He tested us unbelievably,...my husband (ex-marine) finally looked<br/>
him straight in his eyes, after a major<br/>
meltdown on son&#39;s part, and said, &quot;get it all out, give us all you&#39;ve<br/>
got, but you&#39;re not going anywhere.  You&#39;re stuck with us.&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I missed the original of this, but wanted to point out just on principle<br/>
that<br/>
kids are NOT stuck.  They can run or they can kill themselves.  I&#39;ve<br/>
known<br/>
kids who&#39;ve done both.  Trapping and holding them too hard isn&#39;t<br/>
guaranteed<br/>
to raise them to adulthood.<br/>
