<div id="ygrps-yiv-522950276">I just had to share what has happened! As most of you know, we have <br/>
had our son out of PS for about a year and since then he has had no <br/>
contact with any children. When I came to this list, we were having <br/>
him write to children online and pushing him to be around other <br/>
children. Since my first week here I took the plunge into unschooling <br/>
(thanks to many of you) and have read day and night, every day, <br/>
anything and everything I can about unschooling (and still do). I <br/>
threw out restrictions, bedtime, punishment even the therapist&lt;g&gt; all <br/>
at once. I have to say it was such a drastic change that it left my <br/>
husband and the dog confused! Our son really loves it. We laid off our <br/>
son about his fear & anger of children and our need for him to be <br/>
around or write to children. This past week he came to us on his own <br/>
and said, Mom, I was thinking I may like to have my friend Chris over, <br/>
do you think he&#39;ll come over even though I wouldn&#39;t let him before? I <br/>
said I didn&#39;t know, he could give him a call if he liked and I left <br/>
the room (holding my breath). When I came back he was just hanging up <br/>
the phone and said, he&#39;s coming over Thursday. When yesterday came, <br/>
you would think our son saw a ghost. He was so scared. He hasn&#39;t <br/>
played with another child in a year. His friend came and a bit after <br/>
our son was okay and he was so happy. I can&#39;t tell you the happiness I <br/>
felt watching my son run around outside in the sun with his friend, <br/>
laughing and just being a kid again. I can&#39;t tell you how choked up I <br/>
was after his friend left and he said to me, mom thanks for letting me <br/>
go about things in my own way, I love my old mom but I really love my <br/>
new mom. He invited another friend to come over today. Just thought <br/>
I&#39;d share with the list that helped make that happen. Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-949798854">Yes, some chose to e-mail me off list to give me their views on <br/>
parenting and to slam me as to the parent I was. I don&#39;t feel I am a <br/>
bad parent. I was bought up in a strict family and the only way to <br/>
learn was to go to school and if you had any problems in school then <br/>
they just had to be dealt with. This is how I raised our son and I <br/>
wish that once I knew more about homeschooling that I would of just <br/>
did it instead of being scared. Yes, I will be forever sorry for what <br/>
happened to our child and yes, I know that I am to blame. I did not <br/>
leave him in school to be hurt, I love my son with all of my heart. I <br/>
don&#39;t feel I should be ashamed to post on this list when I have <br/>
finally been able to bond with my son again! To me, it is a big deal <br/>
because he is my son, the only child I&#39;ll ever be able to have in <br/>
life. Sorry, I upset people here with my language (which I didn&#39;t<br/>
feel <br/>
was that bad compared to some of the language I see others using), <br/>
sorry if I don&#39;t use such elegant words in my writting and I am not<br/>
so <br/>
very well educated, and sorry I am considered to be out of your click <br/>
because I am such a bad parent! Sorry I even said anything. Won&#39;t let <br/>
it happen again.<br/>

Not meant for everyone on the list please<br/>

Perhaps this will help you put it into perspective. The people who wrote to<br/>
off list don&#39;t feel confident enough to present their opinions with their<br/>
names attached in public. So they had to sneak off to whisper in your ear<br/>
where no one else would hear them or see them. If *they* don&#39;t feel<br/>
confident enough in what they believe, then their beliefs don&#39;t have much<br/>
meaning, do they?<br/>

There will always be people who disagree with the choices we&#39;ve made. We<br/>
have no control over what they feel or believe. What&#39;s important is that we<br/>
do the best we can with what we know and believe at the time in order to be<br/>
true to *ourselves*.<br/>
