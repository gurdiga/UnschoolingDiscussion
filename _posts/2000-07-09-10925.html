<div id="ygrps-yiv-859570900">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
More questions....  I went to a 4 yr old birthday party today with Zak... <br/>
We&#39;ve known most of the people about 3 years and there&#39;s a core group of us <br/>
(5 women) that we all go to a lot of the same events, same parties (whether <br/>
adult or child).  Because we are now unschooling Zak rather than sending him <br/>
to preschool, I found it difficult to enter conversations.  My &quot;friends&quot; <br/>
spent most of the time going over and over which school they were going to be <br/>
sending their kids to (which I couldn&#39;t relate now)... At one point, one of <br/>
them said &quot;you know 8 out of 10 teachers are no good&quot; to which I said &quot;then <br/>
why are you sending them to school?&quot;  they said things like &quot;well they have <br/>
to go. I&#39;d kill them if I kept them home, you have to know how they are doing <br/>
in the world&quot;  I didn&#39;t say anything to these answers just felt sort of sad <br/>
that there seemed to be a parting of the ways.  I only mentioned to one &quot;the <br/>
only guy there&quot; that we are homeschooling (dare not even go there with the <br/>
unschooling) and he said &quot;oh that would be too much work for my wife with <br/>
having 2 kids at home for 24 hours&quot;  My impression is that people think <br/>
homeschooling means you keep your kids locked up in the house for 24 hours a <br/>
day, 7 days a week and that they never go anywhere, see anything or learn <br/>
anything..  Again I didn&#39;t respond to his comment, I didn&#39;t see any point.  <br/>
The other night when one of my friends questioned how we would know whether <br/>
Zak was where he was supposed to be I asked &quot;according to whom?&quot;  By the way <br/>
she is a middle school teacher....  She kept on going on about tests and when <br/>
I questioned who set these tests, and why and what was it based on she seemed <br/>
to get defensive.  I was only trying to gather information.  When I said that <br/>
I didn&#39;t think I needed the government to determine my sons abilities in life <br/>
she then went on about poor people who use homeschooling as an excuse to not <br/>
send their kids to school and that she knew all about this... (As another <br/>
friend pointed out, how would she know that if the kids don&#39;t go to school)...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying very little except the words &quot;we are going to homeschool him&quot; and <br/>
this seem to be provoking all kinds of reactions.  I felt quite lonely <br/>
sitting among women I&#39;ve known for 3 years and having nothing to say on the <br/>
subject of school.  I must say I was glad to leave and go home to hubbie who <br/>
commisserated with me and said he&#39;d go to the next party.<br/>
<br/>
Did any of you have similar experiences?  Did you find that the ones that had <br/>
sent their kids to school and then stopped lost friends or changed friends?  <br/>
Did those of you who didn&#39;t send their kids to school from the beginning lose <br/>
the friends you had from &quot;playdates&quot; when the kids were about 3?  Any <br/>
encouragement and feedback you can give me would be helpful... Is this just a <br/>
transition phaze that I&#39;m going through?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-890537750">It really is hard to know what to say in such situations.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
build up that many contacts from those &#39;preschool&#39; days, since I <br/>
already knew that I disagreed with so much of the parenting going <br/>
on, and I found my company here &lt;g&gt; but I&#39;ve had some very <br/>
sensible discussions with the people I&#39;ve spoken to about it, though <br/>
maybe that&#39;s their British politeness, (perhaps it&#39;s yours that&#39;s <br/>
stopping you from just walking out on such situations &lt;big grin&gt;)  I <br/>
don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve changed any minds, but that&#39;s not my remit <br/>
here, I do my best for my kids and try not to look stupid when I&#39;m <br/>
talking to other folk.  Actually, having a regular weekly (in <br/>
term0time) meeting with home-edders of whatever persuasion has <br/>
been a great help to me, I can sound off and vent with folk who <br/>
understand the sadness (and occasionally rage) at the <br/>
unintentional damage being done to so many kids.  I get more <br/>
p***ed off at the politicos and journo&#39;s who haven&#39;t a clue what <br/>
they&#39;re talking about when it comes to parenting and &#39;education,&#39; <br/>
(the opium for the higher classes???) and the big corps who are <br/>
mucking up the world...<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(good post...and I think we&#39;ve probably all been there at one point or <br/>
another)<br/>
<br/>
I am learning that the best response is to just state you are homeschooling.  <br/>
If they ask questions and seem geniunely interested, answer or not (as YOU <br/>
choose).  <br/>
<br/>
I really get a chuckle out of people telling me they couldn&#39;t stand having <br/>
their children around all the time.  My response to them is that is EXACTLY <br/>
the reason I homeschool.  I&#39;m selfish and like being around my kid!  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it backfires and they start on about socializing.  At that point I <br/>
simply point out that ds has friends of many ages and lifestyles.  How much <br/>
more socialized could he get.  Besides that, I&#39;m not interested in the other <br/>
kids teaching him how to call names, provoke anger, tease, swear, etc.  He <br/>
gets enough of that socialization being around his cousins!<br/>
<br/>
As for how will you know if your child is keeping up...I simply tell them we <br/>
monitor his progress regularly.  Which we do...after all, we talk to each <br/>
other every single day!<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for a good retort for the cousin that likes to get his goat by <br/>
claiming that homeschool kids are stupid.  If they were smart they&#39;d be in <br/>
public school.  (don&#39;t know where he gets this from...his parents aren&#39;t <br/>
anti-homeschool and have been fairly supportive of our decision to educate at <br/>
home.)  We already tried pointing out the success of homeschooler&#39;s in the <br/>
national spelling and geography bees...sure enough, cousin&#39;s comeback was <br/>
they have extra time to study!  That tells me someone is feeding this to the <br/>
cousin...I&#39;m guessing his ps teacher.  While I don&#39;t want to stir things up, <br/>
there are times that being prepared with a snappy comeback would be helpful.  <br/>
Got any ideas?  Not something intimidating or rude, just something that helps <br/>
him stand firm on his own feet.<br/>
<br/>

How about &quot;I am so smart I don&#39;t need to go to school!!!!  Sorry it&#39;s a bit <br/>
of put down to the ps kids, if they get it, which they probably won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;best response is to just state you are homeschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the short and sweet and simple answer... That&#39;s what I need to <br/>
remember, plus they are all getting defensive about the choices they have <br/>
made or are making.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Besides that, I&#39;m not interested in the other kids teaching him how to call <br/>
names, provoke anger, tease, swear, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes the joys of instituionalization in any form be it ps or private.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for your post... it gives me courage to keep going.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of going, Max is in my office eating the map of England, so I&#39;d <br/>
better rescue both he and the map....<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dawn, one thing to keep in mind, is that many people do feel somewhat <br/>
threatened by others that decide to homeschool.  One of the best things that <br/>
I have found, is to be very confident in my stating that we homeschool.  I <br/>
deliberately will not be too quiet around others that do not homeschool, <br/>
because I want them to know I am happy and proud of the choice made.  But, in <br/>
no way do I shove it down their throats.  For example, What I do, is casually <br/>
add to educational conversations how we are studying tadpoles and frogs this <br/>
summer, and how we branched that off into learning about fish.  Usually <br/>
people are very interested, and often will remark how homeschooling sounds so <br/>
great.  I express how excited the kids are in their learning, and the various <br/>
activities they can participate in  within our community.  Overall, the more <br/>
enthusiastic I am, the more interested others are too.    When I a have been <br/>
asked the &quot;socializaton&quot; questions, I tell them about the co-op we have here, <br/>
where kids can join a band, choir, drama team, book review club, sports, <br/>
etc...Most people are amazed that there are so many choices out there.  Maybe <br/>
you can see yourself as someone to &quot;enlighten&quot; others!  :)  ~Karen</div>

Thanks for the great feedback Karen... I guess it just takes some getting <br/>
used to..  Telling them about what we are doing is an excellent idea.  At the <br/>
moment we are just having lots of playdates with other kids and so there&#39;s <br/>
lots of socialization going on this week an learning about different <br/>
cultures.  His best friend is from India, his other friend is an Orthodox Jew <br/>
and so we have been asking questions about beliefs and cultures.  The kids <br/>
are really enjoy playing...<br/>

&gt;Dawn F<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!!  I used to go to a play group but that is one of the reasons that I stopped going, the conflict over daycare/school.  They were all full time SAHM with husbands who made a LOT of money  They were all absorbed with their diets, their kids &quot;classes&quot; and &quot;groups&quot; and their marital problems.  Almost every opinion I expressed or issue that was important to me was contrary to their views or outside of their experience.  They were the rich, yuppie types, with multiple newer cars, HUGE homes in the &quot;Right&quot; neighborhood, and a LOT of high opinions of themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Another reason I stopped going was that it was just too much overstimulation for my kids.  They had meltdowns every week.  The other moms were also not very good about paying attention to the foods that were dangerous for my child.  They would consistently bring snacks that would make him ill on skiin contact alone and then let the other toddlers run around with them.  I ended up policing EVERYONE&#39;s children (10 or more toddlers) and cleaning up spills and abandoned bits, washing hands, etc, while the other moms talked, just in the interests of keeping Thomas safe.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564790321">One reaction we are finding is the other kids are very jealous that our&#39;s <br/>
homeschools.  I invariably get that reaction from children when they learn we <br/>
homeschool.  &#39;really?  how cool!&#39;  and even &#39;can you homeschool me?&#39;.  DS <br/>
gets the same reaction when meeting someone new.  Then some children decide <br/>
to tease him about it...but that&#39;s mostly a cousin and another child at <br/>
church.  They are both decidely jealous!<br/>
<br/>
This jealousy on the part of the children has caused them to ask their <br/>
parents why they don&#39;t homeschool.  I do know it has caused some friction in <br/>
their homes.  One cousin teases my 11 yo ds, another has refused to go to <br/>
school.  His mother has to literally drag him (age 10) to his class and hand <br/>
him over to the teacher.  She has gone so far as to call the school and ask <br/>
that an intervention specialist come to her home and get her child.  At that <br/>
point she was informed that they would have to call the sheriff&#39;s office and <br/>
him picked up by the sheriff and then the family would have to appear in <br/>
family court to answer charges!  So, (in her mind) her choices are to drag <br/>
the kid to school or fear that she will be charged with truancy at $25/day.  <br/>
I feel sad for her.  Sometimes I feel guilty that our homeschooling &#39;seems&#39; <br/>
to cause her problems.  <br/>
<br/>
The real irony here is that when they were pregnant with their first child <br/>
(14 months between her oldest and my youngest), they were determined that <br/>
they would homeschool their children.  They are the ones who sent me in the <br/>
right direction to find answers about state laws.  Yet, I&#39;m the one that took <br/>
my teenager out of ps and have never sent my youngest to ps.  Go figure.  <br/>
<br/>
(of course, I am the one that wanted to homeschool all along, but when it was <br/>
time to send my oldest to school they were arresting parents in my area <br/>
(Omaha at the time) for refusing to send their kids.  I wasn&#39;t up to the <br/>
challenge.  We had no funds and it would have been the end of my husbands <br/>
military career....although we left the military a year later anyway...&lt;BEG&gt; <br/>
they threatened him with court martial if I didn&#39;t enroll the child.  I am <br/>
very grateful to those that took the chance and spent the money and energy <br/>
and paid high personal prices to pave the way for my homeschooling <br/>
experience!  But, I digress...sorry.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, Dawn, it is hard sometimes, isn&#39;t it? I work in a restaurant and talk to <br/>
a whole lot of different people all the time. Teachers are the worst-I <br/>
rarely ever even mention to them that I homeschool. The only ones who have <br/>
been supportive are the Talented and Gifted teachers-they know how tough <br/>
school can be on kids who don&#39;t fit the mold. One lady that I waited on for <br/>
years got really uptight about it until the first week of school when I <br/>
commiserated with her about how hard it is to figure out where all the kids <br/>
really are-what they know and don&#39;t know. Of course, I only had that problem <br/>
once, she has it every year.<br/>
<br/>
I rarely ever try to explain unschooling-it is just too much for anyone who <br/>
doesn&#39;t homeschool. If they all want to think that we have school around the <br/>
kitchen table every day, I let them. My good friends know about it now, and <br/>
most of them will give me the benefit of the doubt, but we really don&#39;t talk <br/>
about it much.<br/>
<br/>
It was worse when I first started hs, but I think the difference now is just <br/>
that I don&#39;t talk about it to as many people. I don&#39;t know that alot of my <br/>
friends agree with it, but I don&#39;t care either.  My kids are older than <br/>
yours and I don&#39;t have the same problem with the preschool mommies, but I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of them are coming to you in a couple of years <br/>
when they find out that school is not the best thing for thier kids either.<br/>

sister is totally supportive, my sil is not.  They think that I am trying to <br/>
shelter my kids (which in a way, I guess I am, but that&#39;s not the whole <br/>
reason).  When we are in the presence of any of my il&#39;s we don&#39;t talk about <br/>
it.  They all like to keep things nicey-nice so if it&#39;s not mentioned, we&#39;ll <br/>
just all pretend that it doesn&#39;t exist.  However, if I am talking about my <br/>
hsing group or whatever, I say that that is what it is.  I&#39;m not going to <br/>
call it a playgroup so that they can feel comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Just how we have handled it so far...<br/>

&gt; &gt;Did any of you have similar experiences?  Did you find that the ones that<br/>
&gt; &gt;had<br/>
&gt; &gt;sent their kids to school and then stopped lost friends or changed <br/>
&gt;friends?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Did those of you who didn&#39;t send their kids to school from the beginning<br/>
&gt; &gt;lose<br/>
&gt; &gt;the friends you had from &quot;playdates&quot; when the kids were about 3?  Any<br/>
&gt; &gt;encouragement and feedback you can give me would be helpful... Is this <br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt; &gt;a<br/>
&gt; &gt;transition phaze that I&#39;m going through?<br/>

&gt;Oh, Dawn, it is hard sometimes, isn&#39;t it? I work in a restaurant and talk <br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;a whole lot of different people all the time. Teachers are the worst-I<br/>
&gt;rarely ever even mention to them that I homeschool. The only ones who have<br/>
&gt;been supportive are the Talented and Gifted teachers-they know how tough<br/>
&gt;school can be on kids who don&#39;t fit the mold. One lady that I waited on for<br/>
&gt;years got really uptight about it until the first week of school when I<br/>
&gt;commiserated with her about how hard it is to figure out where all the kids<br/>
&gt;really are-what they know and don&#39;t know. Of course, I only had that <br/>
&gt;problem<br/>
&gt;once, she has it every year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I rarely ever try to explain unschooling-it is just too much for anyone who<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t homeschool. If they all want to think that we have school around <br/>
&gt;the<br/>
&gt;kitchen table every day, I let them. My good friends know about it now, and<br/>
&gt;most of them will give me the benefit of the doubt, but we really don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;talk<br/>
&gt;about it much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was worse when I first started hs, but I think the difference now is <br/>
&gt;just<br/>
&gt;that I don&#39;t talk about it to as many people. I don&#39;t know that alot of my<br/>
&gt;friends agree with it, but I don&#39;t care either.  My kids are older than<br/>
&gt;yours and I don&#39;t have the same problem with the preschool mommies, but I<br/>
&gt;wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some of them are coming to you in a couple of <br/>
&gt;years<br/>
&gt;when they find out that school is not the best thing for thier kids either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763173197">I was in this situation once in a babysitting co-op that a friend talked <br/>
me into trying but I usually avoid those types of groups.  I find that I like <br/>
my friends to be a big mix of people, not just moms with kids the same ages <br/>
as mine.  It&#39;s kind of along the same lines as the unschooling effect of <br/>
kids, where we point out to people that there&#39;s nothing natural about them <br/>
being segregated by age all day.  I feel like I don&#39;t automatically have <br/>
anything in common with people because they happened to have kids near the <br/>
same times that I did.<br/>
     I really hate those groups where all everyone talks about are recipes, <br/>
good places to shop, schools, daycares, etc.  It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t like <br/>
hearing about a good recipe sometimes but I really love talking about things <br/>
that have meaning to me and I get bored when it&#39;s just 3 or 4 hrs of <br/>
chitchat.  So I try to have friends based upon our having common ground on <br/>
issues that mean a lot to me.  Now with hsers it&#39;s different, especially <br/>
unschoolers, because we do have that common ground and so that&#39;s a big help.<br/>
     When people get into the hsing bashing, I will argue the point pretty <br/>
strongly if I&#39;m in the mood for it.  Sometimes I don&#39;t say much but those <br/>
times are usually in those social gatherings where I think, &quot;I&#39;m never doing <br/>
this again.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-545040231">Thanks everyone for your feedback... It&#39;s so helpful to have a place to go <br/>
and express things that have happened and ask for opinions and experiences <br/>
and get them.  I know this is a transition stage for us and I am also very <br/>
sure this is the right thing for us.  I have no idea how it&#39;s going to look, <br/>
except that it feels right and I just my intuition 100%.<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks to all you gave me their 2 cents/2 pence worth.<br/>
