<div id="ygrps-yiv-1343069700">Hi All,<br/>
I have been on this list for some time now, and have posted on occasion<br/>
when I felt I had anything to offer. However, I have never posted an<br/>
intro, mostly because I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to stay. In a lot of<br/>
ways, this list has been much like a car wreck. You drive by, and even<br/>
though you know it will upset you, you look in anyway. You just can&#39;t<br/>
help yourself. You know you will see pain and bickering, and sometimes<br/>
(almost always) a lack of common sense that caused the wreck to begin<br/>
with. On the other hand, you see the good Samaritan helping victims, <br/>
total strangers trying to make the whole ordeal as painless as possible,<br/>
giving advice, soothing wounds, just being there. Well, I will continue<br/>
to look in at this list, trying to ignore the bickering, etc. and soak in<br/>
the advice, and the good Samaritans&#39; offers of help. Now for the intro:<br/>
        I&#39;m a 34yo stay at home mom with two girls 3 & 5, and married to<br/>
a wonderful husband for 13 years. We had both decided before we had<br/>
children that we would school-at-home, and after reading as many books as<br/>
I could find on the subject, came across this thing called &quot;unschooling&quot;.<br/>
Mary Griffith and John Holt made the whole idea very attractive, and it<br/>
looked complimentary to our sporadic lifestyle. Now for the confession:<br/>
        I don&#39;t *get it*. After reading these various books I thought  I<br/>
*got it*. But reading this list has me convinced that I don&#39;t. I<br/>
understood &quot;unschooling&quot; to be child-led, not child-controlled. I thought<br/>
that unschooling was a way to do away with the mainstream&#39;s way of<br/>
pigeonholing children into a particular set of standards and learning<br/>
methods, only to find out that there are the militant unschoolers that<br/>
say there is only one way of unschooling.  I thought unschooling involved<br/>
giving your children all the resources they need to accomplish what they<br/>
want, whether it be textbooks, videos, pots and pans, whatever. I guess<br/>
my question is, can bits and pieces of mainstream educational methods be<br/>
used, if at the leading of the child or the suggestion of the parent, and<br/>
this still come under the definition of unschooling? Does &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
have a standard definition, or is it conditional on what works for any<br/>
given family? The intro letter says how it is *not* defined.<br/>
&lt; as the free learning kids do outside of parent-directed<br/>
learning, nor is it done on a part-time basis&gt;<br/>
What if a child is temporarily unmotivated and wants (and enjoys) some<br/>
but not all of his learning to be parent directed? Does this come under<br/>
the definition of &quot;unschooling&quot;, and can it be discussed on this forum? <br/>
I really want to *get it*, but am having trouble because of the mixed<br/>
signals on this list lately. I have to admit, the whole idea is very<br/>
appealing to me on the outside, but I am skeptical of the outcome. I have<br/>
never met or spoken to (to my knowledge anyway) anyone who grew up this<br/>
way, and I guess I need some success stories to help encourage me. How<br/>
can I be assured that my children will grow up into bright,<br/>
compassionate, successful adults? I know it is a control thing, and I<br/>
have to get past this aspect, but we only get one chance to do this<br/>
right. Like I said, I don&#39;t *get it*. Thought I did, really want to, just<br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I understood &quot;unschooling&quot; to be child-led, not child-controlled. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
With a lack of any &quot;control&quot; things look very different.<br/>
One of the regular put-downs of unschooling involves people saying &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>
willing to let my children call the shots,&quot; or &quot;My children aren&#39;t going to <br/>
run the house.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those describes unschooling as I&#39;ve seen it work.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I thought unschooling involved<br/>
giving your children all the resources they need to accomplish what they<br/>
want, whether it be textbooks, videos, pots and pans, whatever. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And freedom, respect, flexibility, and less tangible things too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;can bits and pieces of mainstream educational methods be<br/>
used, if at the leading of the child or the suggestion of the parent, and<br/>
this still come under the definition of unschooling?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If the child is leading that way because he knows it will please the parent <br/>
or he has not other experiences to compare the traditional method to, it&#39;s <br/>
not a choice to unschool or not to, it seems maybe more a choice of formal <br/>
school at home or informal (relaxed) homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If the parent is suggesting the mainstream method because the parent doesn&#39;t <br/>
realize the same learning can happen in more natural ways, that&#39;s probably <br/>
still the parent hoping unschooling will look like school to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if a child is temporarily unmotivated and wants (and enjoys) some<br/>
but not all of his learning to be parent directed? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unmotivated to live his life?  <br/>
Or unmotivated to do schoolwork?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really want to *get it*, but am having trouble because of the mixed<br/>
signals on this list lately. I have to admit, the whole idea is very<br/>
appealing to me on the outside, but I am skeptical of the outcome. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mixed signals, as in new or potential unschoolers coming in and arguing <br/>
against experienced unschoolers&#39; reports, is unfortunate but happens.<br/>
<br/>
At www.unschooling.com there are lots of stories of older unschoolers.<br/>
At sandradodd.com/unschooling there are pages on my individual never-schooled <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How can I be assured that my children will grow up into bright,<br/>
compassionate, successful adults&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How can you?<br/>
Will school help?  Money?  Counseling?  <br/>
Which insurance company would be issuing this guarantee you want?<br/>
<br/>
If you plant a tree, how can you be assured that it will grow up into a <br/>
strong, big, healthy tree?<br/>
The best thing you can do is keep it watered and keep other factors from <br/>
tearing it up.<br/>
<br/>
Same with kids.<br/>
<br/>
My children are bright, compassionate and successful people.  I have no <br/>
reason to think anything will change between now and the time they&#39;re adults. <br/>
  They&#39;re 16, 13 and 11, and are trusted and well liked by other children, <br/>
families, and adults.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible they would be just the same if they had gone to school.  It <br/>
will never be proven.  I suspect, though, that each would carry some shame <br/>
and lack about some physical aspect of themselves (at least) or some subject <br/>
area which they didn&#39;t get on schedule, or some bullying or teasing they were <br/>
just tired to the bone of.  They&#39;ve avoided those things.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a little weeping willow tree once.  My cats scratched the bark and it <br/>
died.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve guarded to see that my children&#39;s bark is intact.<br/>

&gt; pigeonholing children into a particular set of standards and learning<br/>
&gt; methods<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is a way to do away with the pigeon holing. But it&#39;s a great<br/>
deal more. It&#39;s based on the philosophy that children -- people really! --<br/>
will learn what they need when they need it. And we have to accept that what<br/>
they need may not match what we think they need.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t cut parents out of the picture. We&#39;re there walking along with<br/>
them as they explore the world, getting to know them and their world. And<br/>
exploring the world ourselves too!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I thought unschooling involved<br/>

&gt; want, whether it be textbooks, videos, pots and pans, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yup. Though saying &quot;helping them find&quot; or &quot;making available&quot; might make it<br/>
clearer than &quot;giving&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can the child say no thanks? That&#39;s often a good test. Another good test<br/>
might be to ask if you&#39;re treating their use of it the same as you would<br/>
their &quot;use&quot; of a comic book. How much of yourself do you have invested in<br/>
them using the mainstream educational methods, and using them in the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
way?<br/>
<br/>
Another good test is to see if you would be feeling the same way or doing<br/>
the same things if it were your husband you were relating to. Would it be<br/>
okay if he used a textbook? It sounds kind of ridiculous when said that way!<br/>
;-) Would it be okay if you used mainstream educational methods on him?<br/>
Again it seems ridiculous. Is that what he&#39;d want you to do to help him?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does &quot;unschooling&quot;<br/>
&gt; have a standard definition, or is it conditional on what works for any<br/>
&gt; given family?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The philosophy is the same for every family. But it will look different for<br/>
each family. Which makes it hard to describe! Obviously people want real<br/>
examples not just philosophy. But we can&#39;t lift examples from one family and<br/>
drop them into another family and expect them to work. So discussing the why<br/>
is as important as the what.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What if a child is temporarily unmotivated and wants (and enjoys) some<br/>

&gt; the definition of &quot;unschooling&quot;, and can it be discussed on this forum?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But what do you mean by unmotivated? Do you mean he doesn&#39;t get out of bed<br/>
in the morning? Do you mean he watches TV all day? Do you mean he isn&#39;t<br/>
doing anything that resembles learning in school?<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the standard approaches to learning (and parenting) the what is not<br/>
nearly as important as the why. And quite often the what has more to do with<br/>
us and our needs for our children than with their needs for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have to admit, the whole idea is very<br/>

&gt; never met or spoken to (to my knowledge anyway) anyone who grew up this<br/>
&gt; way, and I guess I need some success stories to help encourage me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The message board might be a good place to read about unschoolers who have<br/>
gone on or are getting ready to move on. The stories come out slowly in<br/>
response to specific incidents. On the message boards you can read several<br/>
years&#39; worth of those stories without waiting the years for them to wander<br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
Peter Kowalki writes in HEM and has a website. (Perhaps someone can post the<br/>
address.) He just got married to another unschoolers who has her own<br/>
website. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.maeshell.com/">http://www.maeshell.com/</a> will get you there. I don&#39;t know if<br/>
that&#39;s the address she moved to or moved from.)<br/>
<br/>
Helen, the list owner, has grown children (and she was unschooler herself!)<br/>
and she tells us about them when she pops in :-)<br/>
<br/>
There really aren&#39;t any guarantees with unschooling. It&#39;s not a formula as<br/>
school supposedly is that you can run kids through to get to a particular<br/>
outcome. It&#39;s really helping them grow into who they already are. The goals<br/>
are different than standard schooling: to help our kids be who they are and<br/>
trust that they will learn what they need.<br/>
<br/>
I think embracing that goal is key to getting unschooling and getting it to<br/>
work. If we expect the kids to progress in a particular direction,<br/>
unschooling will be frustrating -- and obviously not work! It&#39;s not designed<br/>
to do that!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But what do you mean by unmotivated? Do you mean he <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; doing anything that resembles learning in school?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>May I ask you a question Joyce?<br/>
<br/>
The difficulty I see in  the picture of unschooling often <br/>
characterized in books and websites is that we see the &quot;shining <br/>
examples&quot;--kids anyone would be proud to have, building boats <br/>
in the basement, cross breeding fish in a creek, designing <br/>
computer games from scratch and selling them...<br/>
<br/>
What most of us experience are kids who undulate in their <br/>
passions and evident learning. I want to allow them to learn the <br/>
way I learn but sometimes lose my confidence. I know that I go in <br/>
hot streaks and then take breaks. I tend to focus on one area at a <br/>
time, not break my interests into seven neat chunks that get daily <br/>
attention. So I have wanted to do that with my children too.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I suppose that what is tough is that kids really do appear to <br/>
be wasting time to us. And I do lose my confidence when the <br/>
chief interest of a child is to chat all day on the computer with <br/>
friends or play James Bond on the X box all day.<br/>
<br/>
Is direction a part of unschooling at all? Any suggestions of how <br/>
to spend time taboo?<br/>
<br/>
Do most of you simply rise in the morning and your kids live their <br/>
parallel lives around you? When my kids were younger, so much <br/>
of what we did we did together and there was a natural <br/>
confluence between what they were interested in and how I <br/>
could faciliate that. As they&#39;ve gotten older, that has changed.<br/>
<br/>
In our home, we&#39;ve always had a read a loud time (for literature <br/>
or historical fiction) and do some regularly scheduled activities <br/>
that do appear schoolish. (From another unschooling list I was <br/>
on, this was considered table time for the basics). We&#39;ve done <br/>
math consistently and language arts based on the Charlotte <br/>
Mason approach.<br/>
<br/>
But they do have lots of time to pursue their interests.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I find myself juding their interests. I look ahead and <br/>
think that they ought to be making the most of these teen years <br/>
for more than social life or X Box!<br/>
<br/>
Well, there&#39;s my bias. But does no one else feel it? I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading this list for two weeks and I guess I&#39;m wondering if no <br/>
one goes through dissatisfactions or worries about how their <br/>
kids spend their time. Would anyone be willing to discuss this? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; There really aren&#39;t any guarantees with unschooling. It&#39;s not a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>formula as<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; school supposedly is that you can run kids through to get to a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>particular<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; outcome. It&#39;s really helping them grow into who they already <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; are different than standard schooling: to help our kids be who <br/>
 </span></blockquote>they are and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trust that they will learn what they need.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That doesn&#39;t sound like a goal to me. That sounds like a <br/>
framework. Iow, I would say that a goal would be to help our kids <br/>
find a meaningful place in the adult world as responsbile, <br/>
competent adults. But I don&#39;t know if &quot;trusting that they will learn <br/>
what they need&quot; is a goal in the same way. It is a philosophy for <br/>
achieving a goal.<br/>
<br/>
And I suppose at this point, I really do want that philosophy to <br/>
continue in my family. It has worked so far. But now I am feeling <br/>
that anxiety that comes with things not looking how I expected... I <br/>
wonder if that is sufficient for that preparation for adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
And I am dealing with their new desires--to go to school, for <br/>
instance. Does that fall under the category of &quot;trusting they will <br/>
learn what they need&quot;? What if the child is now saying &quot;I think I <br/>
need school&quot;? Do I honor that?<br/>
<br/>
Okay. Stopping now. Don&#39;t mean to overdo it, but I really do need <br/>
to talk about this stuff and am hoping this is the place to do it.<br/>

said.  For us unschooling is more than &quot;schooling&quot;.  By that I mean it is <br/>
more than your approach to education.  It is the way we live.  How we treat <br/>
our children.  For us it means that our children are people already living <br/>
and being. ( I hate that question:  &quot;what are you going to be when you grow <br/>
up?&quot;) We treat our children with respect and I believe that they are doing <br/>
the best they can all the time.  I let them decide how they want to spend <br/>
their time each and every day.  They are intelligent people and learn what <br/>
they need to learn to do what they want to do.  I am just a facilitator.  I <br/>
have more life experience and may have more ideas about where the information <br/>
they need is located, someone that can help, books, museums, classes, etc <br/>
etc.  I may be able to help them locate what it is they are searching for.  <br/>
And we learn together.  <br/>
Just some of the thoughts rambling around in my head.<br/>

him LOTS of hours to persue his interests. But since he has to spend so many <br/>

put on the back burner.<br/>

If I had to listen to Joe read out loud to me one of his many books on <br/>

<br/>
My kids don&#39;t do anything like that.  But they&#39;re happy with the things they <br/>
do do.<br/>
I think the happiness is better than the measurable &quot;success.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What most of us experience are kids who undulate in their <br/>
passions and evident learning. I want to allow them to learn the <br/>
way I learn but sometimes lose my confidence. I know that I go in <br/>
hot streaks and then take breaks.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t keep them from learning so how can you &quot;allow them to learn&quot;?<br/>
Maybe what&#39;s undulating is the parental desire to see natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
I think learning happened better here when our focus changed to their mental <br/>
health and feelings of contentment.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Still, I suppose that what is tough is that kids really do appear to <br/>

<br/>
If you play James Bond with them a while you&#39;ll see it&#39;s really not easy, and <br/>
there are all kinds of strategies and decisions.  Schools pay people to write <br/>
lesson plans to help children think and strategize.  Don&#39;t tell your kids <br/>
that.  But YOU should know that.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Chatting with friends&quot; is how I learned most of what I&#39;ve learned in my <br/>
whole life.<br/>
<br/>
Is this message board just &quot;chatting with friends&quot;?<br/>
Is there any other source in the world where you could learn so much <br/>
abchooling, or even get three hours of college credit.  THIS IS IT!  But it <br/>
looks like chatting with friends.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Any suggestions of how <br/>
to spend time taboo?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If your suggestions serve to sort out, for them, what things are &quot;better&quot; <br/>
than others (&quot;better&quot; meaning more educational) it&#39;s very likely you&#39;re wrong <br/>
anyway.  Instead of trying to change them to do things YOU perceive as <br/>
learning moments, spend some energy seeing the learning in all moments.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do most of you simply rise in the morning and your kids live their <br/>
parallel lives around you? When my kids were younger, so much <br/>
of what we did we did together and there was a natural <br/>
confluence between what they were interested in and how I <br/>
could faciliate that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Today Kirby needed to go to work at 11:30, and Holly is having friends over <br/>
for videotaping, and I&#39;ve cooked some and cut Holly&#39;s hair (she&#39;s thrilled <br/>
with the haircut, so I&#39;m relieved), talked to a friend with personal trauma, <br/>
done some exercises with my husband and some rubber straps the hospital gave <br/>
me--his knee is hurting, so he showed me some things for stretching various <br/>
tendons and helped me interpret the little chart they gave me for leg <br/>
exercises.<br/>
<br/>
Now Keith&#39;s off at fighter practice.<br/>
<br/>
Marty just got up at 1:00, and made his own breakfast and went to play a <br/>
newish video game he has.  <br/>
<br/>
People will start showing back up here over the course of the afternoon.  <br/>
Keith goes back to work tomorrow for the first time since about December 10.  <br/>
Long, good vacation, just being home.  I think Kirby and I are watching DVDs <br/>
tonight together, so we can send some back to Netflix.  Holly and I made a <br/>
list of things to rent at Hollywood video, and most will only be on tape.   I <br/>
was supposed to go with Keith to Costco, but with Holly&#39;s friends being here, <br/>
I probably won&#39;t get to.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a typical day.  The determining factors are people&#39;s personal checklists <br/>
and time schedules.<br/>

&gt;pigeonholing children into a particular set of standards and learning<br/>
&gt;methods, only to find out that there are the militant unschoolers that<br/>
&gt;say there is only one way of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe I shouldn&#39;t.<br/>

&gt;used, if at the leading of the child or the suggestion of the parent, and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When our electrician kid decided he wanted to learn to drive <br/>

&gt;but not all of his learning to be parent directed? Does this come under<br/>
&gt;the definition of &quot;unschooling&quot;, and can it be discussed on this forum?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is the best of all places to discuss it, but be aware <br/>
that the concept makes some people here upset. That said, I&#39;ll broach <br/>
the topic: When our oldest son was little he always wanted more <br/>
direction and interaction than any of the other kids. He&#39;d ask me to <br/>
buy workbooks because he just loved filling in the blanks - <br/>
especially math-related books - was he unschooling? Was I <br/>
&quot;sabotaging&quot; his unschooling by buying him the silly workbooks? His <br/>
Christmas wish list included what I considered pretty structured <br/>
computer learning programs - was he unschooling when he played them? <br/>
In the years since he&#39;s the one who&#39;s been in charge of building <br/>
steel frame commercial buildings, actually changing the blueprints <br/>
when necessary - it seems like that has taken a certain headset for <br/>
figures and calculations that I can now see he has been cultivating <br/>
since he was old enough to hold a pencil. Was he unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I really want to *get it*, but am having trouble because of the mixed<br/>

&gt;never met or spoken to (to my knowledge anyway) anyone who grew up this<br/>

&gt;can I be assured that my children will grow up into bright,<br/>
&gt;compassionate, successful adults?<br/>

something about trusting ourselves, which is difficult to do because <br/>

website for some excellent resources on the whole concept, mostly <br/>
drawn from Home Education Magazine, which our family publishes. Some <br/>

we&#39;re working to make it even better in the coming weeks and months.<br/>

<br/>
I would say &quot;Yes, if your child doesn&#39;t mind&quot; or &quot;yes, if your child<br/>
values those methods&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
To me &quot;child-led&quot; can mean &quot;parent-inspired&quot; but it can&#39;t mean &quot;parent-imposed&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
(However, I have made my child brush his teeth.)<br/>
<br/>
There is a big spectrum between strictly following a curriculum and<br/>
complete unschooling.  Just because a person tossed their curriculum out<br/>
the window doesn&#39;t make them an unschooler.  They may be at one of the<br/>
points in between.<br/>
<br/>
If complete unschooling doesn&#39;t appeal to you, there&#39;s also &quot;relaxed<br/>
homeschooling&quot; and &quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot;.  (Or you can make up your<br/>
own new name.) Even though I unschool, in real life most of the people<br/>
in my support group are &quot;relaxed&quot; or &quot;eclectic&quot;.  <br/>

falsehood. The falsehood is that children need to be guided to learn certain <br/>
things in life that are deemed important by somone other than the child.<br/>
But before I came to this understanding, before I could see the falsehoood <br/>
for what it was, I had to take away the school. Completely. I had to take a <br/>
leap of faith.<br/>
In myself, in my parenting mentors, in the books I&#39;ve read, and most <br/>
importantly, in my children.<br/>
I had to step back and let them BE. For a long time.<br/>
It took at least a year of trust to see that there is no stopping natural <br/>
learning, in all forms, academic, social, physical.<br/>
Immerse yourself in Unschooling Philosophy, read on line and off. Get rid of <br/>
(at least box up and put into a closet) anything that reminds you of that <br/>
falsehood.<br/>
Get out and play with your kids. Teenagers still play, you know! Stop reading <br/>
homeschooling mags,a nd read unschooling ones. Throw out the curriculum <br/>
catalogs and visit the Discovery Channel Store. Go for walks and looks for <br/>
animal skulls or Owl Pellets to examine.<br/>
PLay and Learn. They go together and when the two are not interfered with, <br/>
can&#39;t be torn apart.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; trust that they will learn what they need.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;That doesn&#39;t sound like a goal to me. That sounds like a <br/>
framework.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a GREAT goal!<br/>
<br/>
It give the parents something they CAN do.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent thinks &quot;I am going to see that my child is an olympic swimmer,&quot; <br/>
the odds of parental success are very small.<br/>
<br/>
I used that example because years ago one of the people writing about <br/>
unschooling had friends whose kids were really structured.  Here&#39;s how <br/>
structured:  There was a long chart like a timeline on the wall of one of the <br/>
kids rooms.  At the end was &quot;olympic gold medalist&quot; and it worked back to the <br/>
present with all kinds of goals and measures and all their lives were <br/>
focussed on that.<br/>
<br/>
What are the odds that person grew up to be a failure?<br/>
And if the goal hadn&#39;t been &quot;gold medal,&quot; then the odds of success would have <br/>
been better. <br/>
And if the goal had been &quot;olympic try-outs, still success would be more <br/>
attainable.<br/>
<br/>
But if the goal had been &quot;enjoys swimming, gets classes and coaching and has <br/>
opportunities to compete&quot; all of a sudden EVERYBODY could have been <br/>
successful.  Every class teacher, coach and meet would have been a successful <br/>
completion instead of a potentially weak link in a chain stretching beyond <br/>
anyone&#39;s sight.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Iow, I would say that a goal would be to help our kids <br/>
find a meaningful place in the adult world as responsbile, <br/>
competent adults. But I don&#39;t know if &quot;trusting that they will learn <br/>
what they need&quot; is a goal in the same way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Trusting them is helping them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What if the child is now saying &quot;I think I <br/>
need school&quot;? Do I honor that?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First, I would try to see what is lacking at home that makes school seem <br/>
better than being home.<br/>
<br/>
And WHY do they want to go?  Are they afraid it&#39;s the only way to &quot;reach a <br/>
goal&quot; for themselves of their parents?<br/>

<br/>
If you give kids choices all along and treat them as people, then the whole <br/>
thing is a continuum and they start making those balancing decisions when <br/>
they&#39;re six, or eight, or ten (all along, but they increase in weight).<br/>
<br/>
MAYBE the idea that has you stuck is &quot;preparing for adulthood.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t &quot;preparing for adulthood.&quot;  They&#39;re living life, just as <br/>
legitimately as any adult is.  They  make real decisions involving time, <br/>
money, laundry, being prepared for deadlines (even if it&#39;s as small as being <br/>
ready for friends to take them to the movies, it&#39;s real), people&#39;s feelings, <br/>
their own health, all the time.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re aware of and facile with such decisions when they&#39;re younger, <br/>
there will be no &quot;becoming an adult&quot; when someone else stops making their <br/>
decisions and they start making their own decisions.  Turning 18 or 21 will <br/>
be just as smooth and non-remarkable as turning 12 or going from  one evening <br/>
to any other morning NOT their birthday.<br/>

be a childless young woman with a wealthy benefactor who has tons of time to <br/>
paint! Homemaking is my choice so I do it. If I had married a man who told me <br/>
that I must quit my job and homeschool my children, I would probably do just <br/>
what he wanted and no more since It was not my choice in the first place. I <br/>
no longer do things in my life that are not my choice. Sometimes there are <br/>
steps to a coice that are boring or downright unpleasant (such as cleaning <br/>
the catbox) but they are steps toward the choice I did make (having sweet, <br/>
beautiful cats that sit on my lap and purr).<br/>
Anyhoo, The point I was trying to make in the quoted text above, was that If <br/>
I had to do what my husband (or mother or best friend or neighbor) wanted me <br/>
to do, I would have less energy left over to do the things *I* want to do. If <br/>
my kids had to do what *I* wanted them to do, if they had to study stuff that <br/>
*I* felt was important, but to them was boring, inane, unrelated to anything <br/>
in their life, they would have that much less energy to persue an interest <br/>
that they may have.<br/>
It sounds as if they haven&#39;t really had a chance to unschool joyfully and <br/>
trustingly. If you are working toward joyfull unschooling, start by trusting <br/>
that what they ARE doing is good and right and important to THEM. Because <br/>
THEY are the ones who will be taking that knowledge with them for the rest of <br/>

&lt;&lt; Okay. I have played their games on the computer and know they <br/>
are challenging. I suppose I have split feelings about the <br/>
violence and the point of those skills. So my maternal bias is <br/>
interfering. I did concede to the purchase of the X box just for <br/>
those reasons, but I guess it&#39;s clear I haven&#39;t bought in fully. I am <br/>
still ambivalent. &gt;&gt;<br/>

I would NOT tape that to the refrigerator.  Maybe carry it around in your <br/>
pocket a while, but I would take steps not to have ANY visible or audible <br/>
divisions of educational vs. non-educational.  Also it suggests you could be <br/>
wrong, and while it might be true in that little instance, why tape THAT to <br/>
your refrigerator?     <br/>
<br/>
If you go to www.unschooling.com and search for AnneO or Zenmomma stuff, <br/>
you&#39;ll find LOTS of things worthy of refrigerator doors, and really uplifting <br/>
stuff about how RIGHT you are!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sometimes there are <br/>
steps to a coice that are boring or downright unpleasant (such as cleaning <br/>
the catbox) but they are steps toward the choice I did make (having sweet, <br/>
beautiful cats that sit on my lap and purr). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow. <br/>
I clean mine so the cat doesn&#39;t crap in the corner!<br/>
<br/>
Your life is way better than mine.<br/>
<br/>
My cats sit in my face and purr when it&#39;s nearly time to feed them, though!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been using disposable cat boxes--the trays the canned cat food comes <br/>
in.  Input and output in the same box!  When it&#39;s too  yucky to keep using I <br/>
take out the last of the solid output and pour the rest on the driveway to <br/>
absorb the automotive output from the leaking VW.  <br/>
<br/>
Someone&#39;s job is to dance on that kitty litter to take oil off.  Not MY job <br/>
lately, but will be again someday.  Whoever&#39;s out there talking to Keith or <br/>
throwing a frisbee for the dog will scoot around on the kitty litter and when <br/>
the oil spot is better Keith sweeps up and throws it away.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just about like every other thing in our lives.  One thing leads to <br/>
another, and nothing is entirely any one person&#39;s responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Our two female cats go outside and do their bizness but the male wants a <br/>
private corner toilet of his own inside.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;he point I was trying to make in the quoted text above, was that If <br/>
I had to do what my husband (or mother or best friend or neighbor) wanted me <br/>
to do, I would have less energy left over to do the things *I* want to do. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And it also would divide the world into what you did want to do and what you <br/>
did NOT want to do.    I WANT to do the dishes, when I can&#39;t find a bowl, or <br/>
when I need counterspace to make bread.  If I did the dishes on a schedule, <br/>
7:00 every evening, I would never &quot;want&quot; to do the dishes.  <br/>
<br/>
I WANT to do the laundry when my favorite sweatshirt is unavailable!<br/>

&gt; examples&quot;--kids anyone would be proud to have, building boats<br/>
&gt; in the basement, cross breeding fish in a creek, designing<br/>
&gt; computer games from scratch and selling them...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, absolutely! For one thing, it&#39;s not particularly interesting to describe<br/>
days of a child watching TV for 3 weeks straight ;-) But, yes, it is<br/>
comforting to hear about kids doing things that, well, don&#39;t make good<br/>
reading for troublesome inlaws ;-)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helps is to come here and tell everyone what you&#39;re kids are<br/>
doing and that it&#39;s bothering you. And people can sympathize and tell you<br/>
their kids did exactly that and how it came out for them. They can perhaps<br/>
help you see the situation in a way that you hadn&#39;t. Perhaps people can help<br/>
you see that you aren&#39;t involved enough, or not offering them better things<br/>
to do, or that looking for what they aren&#39;t learning is blinding you to what<br/>
they are learning. It&#39;s going to depend on the situation, but usually a<br/>
variety of good stuff comes out of someone asking for support/help with<br/>
something that&#39;s bothering them. (Not to imply that it&#39;s easy to put<br/>
yourself out there!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Still, I suppose that what is tough is that kids really do appear to<br/>
&gt; be wasting time to us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. Sometimes it helps to join them! Sometimes it helps to come here and<br/>
get some perspective.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is direction a part of unschooling at all? Any suggestions of how<br/>
&gt; to spend time taboo?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would you want your husband to do to you what you&#39;d like to do for your<br/>
kids?<br/>
<br/>
Would you want your husband to see you reading a trashy novel and have him<br/>
tell you there were better ways to spend your time? Would you want to get<br/>
that feeling as you sat down that if he saw you reading a trashy novel that<br/>
you knew he&#39;d make &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions on &quot;fun&quot; things you could be doing?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to divorce the need to suggest from the judgement of how<br/>
they&#39;re using their time. Suggest things because the kids might like them<br/>
not because you feel it&#39;s better than what they&#39;re doing. (Again, this isn&#39;t<br/>
meant to suggest anyone can just turn off the feelings and do unschooling<br/>
&quot;right&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do most of you simply rise in the morning and your kids live their<br/>
&gt; parallel lives around you? When my kids were younger, so much<br/>
&gt; of what we did we did together and there was a natural<br/>
&gt; confluence between what they were interested in and how I<br/>
&gt; could faciliate that. As they&#39;ve gotten older, that has changed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For us it has changed back and forth. There for a while my daughter (11yo)<br/>
was getting up to watch TV all day. It must have lasted for 2 or 3 months.<br/>
(Or it felt that way!) Now she wants to do things with me. Or she works on<br/>
projects on her own. I only have one child so the dynamics are a lot<br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
But it should feel like a family living together, not separate people<br/>
sharing the same roof. The parents aren&#39;t there just to provide access to<br/>
the world. We&#39;re all part of a family.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m talking about connections and staying connected and being<br/>
responsive to their needs. And getting in there and mixing things up,<br/>
perhaps, if things are feeling to routine. Or letting things be if it feels<br/>
comfortably homey.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s something that comes out better inadvertently when people<br/>
describe how their lives work.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In our home, we&#39;ve always had a read a loud time (for literature<br/>
&gt; or historical fiction) and do some regularly scheduled activities<br/>
&gt; that do appear schoolish. (From another unschooling list I was<br/>
&gt; on, this was considered table time for the basics). We&#39;ve done<br/>
&gt; math consistently and language arts based on the Charlotte<br/>
&gt; Mason approach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But they do have lots of time to pursue their interests.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And unschoolers here suggest nothing but interests and things that might<br/>
interest them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I suppose I find myself juding their interests. I look ahead and<br/>
&gt; think that they ought to be making the most of these teen years<br/>
&gt; for more than social life or X Box!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some of it&#39;s jealousy! I mean what adult *wouldn&#39;t* want to be able to spend<br/>
all day doing whatever they want and not having to make decisions and stop<br/>
to tend to the needs of others? :-)<br/>
<br/>
Part is natural worry. Reading helps. Being aware of the connections you&#39;re<br/>
helping them make with the world helps.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well, there&#39;s my bias. But does no one else feel it? I&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; reading this list for two weeks and I guess I&#39;m wondering if no<br/>
&gt; one goes through dissatisfactions or worries about how their<br/>
&gt; kids spend their time. Would anyone be willing to discuss this?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes lots of people feel that. I think it doesn&#39;t appear that they do because<br/>
they act as though they don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so much a matter of not feeling that way or stopping from feeling<br/>
that way as what to do when you do feel that way. Some people are really<br/>
sold on the benefits of unschooling and just push on past the feelings,<br/>
knowing that what they&#39;re gaining is better than what the feelings are<br/>
trying to pull them back to. Or some people come here and talk about it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That doesn&#39;t sound like a goal to me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope, that&#39;s the goal: helping them be who they are. Everything else is a<br/>
side effect. A *good* side effect :-)<br/>
<br/>
So, who are you kids? (That&#39;s a rhetorical question but you can tell us if<br/>
it would help you figure it out. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And I am dealing with their new desires--to go to school, for<br/>
&gt; instance. Does that fall under the category of &quot;trusting they will<br/>
&gt; learn what they need&quot;? What if the child is now saying &quot;I think I<br/>
&gt; need school&quot;? Do I honor that?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why do they want to go? What do they think school can accomplish that they<br/>
can&#39;t get out of school?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter wanted to go to kindergarten. It turns out she wanted to ride<br/>
the Big Wheels like she did in preschool. She recently asked for a math<br/>
tutor and I pointed out all the programs and made some suggestions on how<br/>
she could get the same effect. She hasn&#39;t taken any up, yet, but she&#39;s more<br/>
aware of them now. And she *really* didn&#39;t want a tutor. She hates classes<br/>
where the teacher tells the kids how to do things the &quot;right way&quot; and makes<br/>
them demonstrate that they got it!<br/>

They learn what they need now. The nows just naturally keep coming along and<br/>

time? Borrow a game and return it? Get up on time for something they want to<br/>
do?<br/>
<br/>
I think what adults worry about is that how kids who&#39;ve been given freedom<br/>
will handle doing things they dislike. But don&#39;t we want something better<br/>
than to prepare them to do boring things? Don&#39;t we want them to figure out<br/>
how to spend their lives doing what they enjoy?<br/>
<br/>
And are there things you do because you&#39;re obligated, or because you want to<br/>
avoid the consequences of not doing them?<br/>

When you put it like that...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think the hardest indoctrination to get over is that kids <br/>
can&#39;t be trusted to make good decisions for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
My dh was commenting that he feels we ought to seize this time <br/>
(late high school/college) of life to give them a broad/liberal <br/>
education in the humanities simply for the exposure even if they <br/>
aren&#39;t keenly interested. If they go into a science field, they may <br/>
not get the chance again.<br/>
<br/>
I countered that I have been giving myself an education superior <br/>
to my college education independently during my thirties and <br/>
forties due to my own passion and interest.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I regret that I was ever taught American lit in high school <br/>
because I hated it. It made me avoid it for twenty-five years. I am <br/>
not just reading those books again and am loving them. But it&#39;s <br/>
taken getting over my aversion from school to even face those <br/>
authors and titles.<br/>
<br/>
In that, I have no problem waiting or allowing my kids to make <br/>
those decisions.<br/>

learners--all five. It&#39;s this teen stuff this is throwing me for such a <br/>
loop!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, thanks for asking. I will share who the two oldest are so I <br/>
can at least get them out on the table here.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is male, 15. Noah is incredibly gifted with anything that <br/>
requires his hands. He has done string games, origami, <br/>
puzzles, computer games, clay sculpting, piano, guitar, wiki <br/>
sticks, rock climbing and drawing. His interest in piano is a true <br/>
depiction of his personality.<br/>
<br/>
He heard the song Rondo Ala Turka (Mozart) on the Pride and <br/>
Prejudice videos four years ago. Suddenly he wanted to learn to <br/>
play the piano. I told him he could take lessons. He brought the <br/>
sheet music to his first lesson and never did use the intro to <br/>
piano music. He started with Mozart. and immediately learned to <br/>
play. Played non-stop all the time, no reminders to practice.<br/>
<br/>
In three years time, he became her most gifted student. <br/>
However, conversely, he stopped practicing and kept forgetting <br/>
his lessons during the last six months. I finally stopped the <br/>
lessons (not wanting to pay for what he wasn&#39;t doing). Broke my <br/>
heart. His talent and passion all gone by the way side. No more <br/>
playing for the joy of it.<br/>
<br/>
Then suddenly, since Christmas, he took up playing again, but <br/>
on his own. This time he is playing Vanessa Carlton round the <br/>
clock. And he&#39;s playing extremely well. I asked him what was <br/>
going on. His words: I like this music. I got tired of my teacher.<br/>
<br/>
That is Noah all over. He is completely self taught in electric <br/>
guitar. And is doing that well too. He loves heavy metal and <br/>
wants to be in a rock band. <br/>
<br/>
He reads widely and well. He acts in plays, loves Shakespeare, <br/>
has written a screenplay, he&#39;s on the teen board for the library... <br/>
He&#39;s been a model of what I thought unschooling would yield.<br/>
<br/>
Socially it&#39;s been another story. He is extremely intimidated by <br/>
his peer group. He has friends, and he&#39;s very chatty when with a <br/>
group of kids his age, but he hates phone calling and complains <br/>
about not having a buddy... yet does nothing to cultivate <br/>
relationships. This has been our biggest concern for him. he <br/>
gets sort of paralyzed about pursuing friendships.<br/>
<br/>
And like a typicl kid whose been doing what he wants for most of <br/>
his life, he has little patience to follow through on anything that <br/>
he doesn&#39;t feel like pursuing. Sometimes that looks like laziness <br/>
to me. I remember being pushed to finish things and being glad <br/>
for that push... so where to draw the line? Is there a line?<br/>
<br/>
My 13 dd is another story. She wants to go to school because it <br/>
is a universal experience that most people have had and she&#39;s <br/>
never had it. She wants a locker, friends to chat with in the halls, <br/>
boys to flirt with and dances to go to. She wants the football <br/>
games and the homework and teachers.<br/>
<br/>
She really wants the school experience. <br/>
<br/>
She is also wanting to make friends outside of the homeschool <br/>
world (which feels extremely narrow to her).<br/>
<br/>
She is active online with an international community of Elijah <br/>
Wood fans. She&#39;s got friends all over the world sending her <br/>
letters and gifts and invitations to visit. :) She reads voraciously. <br/>
And she&#39;s written two novellas.<br/>
<br/>
This is a highly gifted girl in relational skills (opposite her <br/>
brother). She used to have stronger interests (i.e. vintage dance, <br/>
art, costume deisgn). She is more interested now in acting and <br/>
singing.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly what I worry about is that I feel a pulling away from <br/>
family in all this social pursuit. I&#39;d be for it all (I am highly <br/>
extroverted too) if it didn&#39;t seem to mean that she was less happy <br/>
being with us.<br/>
<br/>
Argh.<br/>
<br/>
This is too long already. Even as I type, I think, &quot;These are cool <br/>
kids. What am I worried about?&quot; Sigh. I guess that&#39;s why I write it <br/>
out. :)<br/>
<br/>
So schoo may be on the horizon. We may do part ttime <br/>
enrollment to see if that is enough.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the input today. My head is swimming. But this is <br/>
just what I needed.<br/>

Heck YES you should do that.  How could they not be keenly interested in <br/>
that?!<br/>
<br/>
If he means getting a humanities book and talking to them about how history <br/>

 My kids aren&#39;t &quot;preparing for adulthood.&quot;  They&#39;re living life, just as <br/>
 legitimately as any adult is.  They  make real decisions involving time, <br/>
 money, laundry, being prepared for deadlines (even if it&#39;s as small as being <br/>
 ready for friends to take them to the movies, it&#39;s real), people&#39;s feelings, <br/>
 their own health, all the time. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This was the concept that took me the longest to &quot;get&quot;....Once I started <br/>
seeing that right now, this moment being lived for what it is, is the true <br/>
goal, then everything else started to make sense.<br/>
I quit trying to prepare them for an imagined future (how does any of us know <br/>
anything about what the future could hold?) and started living life just to <br/>
be happy and fulfilled. It was the paradigm shift that changed everything for <br/>
me.<br/>
We went from the mostly-unschooling-nervously type of family to the joyfully, <br/>
bubbly unschooling family (well, most days anyway...dh is still trying to get <br/>
it).<br/>

<br/>
I agree.  I think school is an artificial way to prepare for the future.<br/>
 Trying to learn something &quot;because you&#39;ll need to know this later&quot; is a<br/>
recipe for forgetting.  (Studying foreign languages in high school is a<br/>
prime example.)  I think it&#39;s much better to learn things when you need them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050069734">First of all,  welcome to the list Julie!<br/>
 <br/>
I been reading through all the resonses that you have been getting and there is such a great amount of knowledge here.  As I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve seen.<br/>
 <br/>
I think that there are lots and lots of people here who have had your doubts and still have your doubts.   They, the doubts, come and go, yet,  the more I read and learn the less they come around!   Which is great.    <br/>
 <br/>
Seriously,   read all you can on unschooling.com,   it especially helped me on the TV/video game restrictions thing.    As Sandra said,  read Mary Gold&#39;s article.    I was extremely against watching TV or playing video games.    Then I started learning about unschooling,   we can not even begin to understand what our children are learning while they are doing those things.      I know I learned a ton watching different situations on TV as I was growing up.   <br/>
I think you&#39;ll be surprised at how your children will actually shut off the TV,  or video game (if they have one)   give them the choice and its amazing.    Of course if there is a new show they like or a new game they want to play,  they might play/watch for hours.  I know I spend alot of time on new things when I get them, a new book, a new video.  And isn&#39;t their stick-to-itiveness (sp?&lt;g&gt;) showing then?  And so many worry about kids being quitters and all.    Its all perspective.   And if you look from theirs,   its a whole new ball game!<br/>
<br/>
 It is hard to let it go,  our judgement of what is worth doing.  But the sooner we can do it, the sooner our children can begin this wonderful life of unschooling.    And then all of a sudden you&#39;ll just stop and see it all happening.   I think this links right to unschooling as living life.   Stop thinking about what is &#39;educational&#39;;  just play,  have fun,  and the one idea that really got me was--try to go a day and not learn something.  That concept is amazing,  learning is continual, always happening.      Live and be joyful within the day, the moment,  and don&#39;t think about what they are going to be doing  10 years down the line.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sorry for going on and on,  but I get so excited when I start writing or talking about it!!<br/>
 <br/>
Get ready for a wonderful, eye opening journey,  its just beginning!<br/>
 <br/>
Take care,<br/>
 <br/>

I countered that I have been giving myself an education superior <br/>
to my college education independently during my thirties and <br/>
forties due to my own passion and interest.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, I regret that I was ever taught American lit in high school <br/>
because I hated it. It made me avoid it for twenty-five years. I am <br/>
not just reading those books again and am loving them. But it&#39;s <br/>
taken getting over my aversion from school to even face those <br/>
authors and titles.<br/>
<br/>
In that, I have no problem waiting or allowing my kids to make <br/>
those decisions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thank yo for validating that others do have these feelings. I was <br/>
starting to think I was a wimp all by myself.<br/>
<br/>
You see, I&#39;ve had no trouble following this mindset with young <br/>
kids. They&#39;ve been robust, enthusiasitic, self-motivated <br/>
learners--all five. It&#39;s this teen stuff this is throwing me for such a <br/>
loop!<br/>
<br/>
There for a while my daughter (11yo)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; was getting up to watch TV all day. It must have lasted for 2 or 3 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>months.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (Or it felt that way!) <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Confession: I would utterly freak out if this were the case. I can&#39;t <br/>
have the TV on all day or I would go totally batty! That&#39;s one <br/>
boundary I don&#39;t think I could give up yet.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, who are you kids? (That&#39;s a rhetorical question but you can <br/>
 </span></blockquote>tell us if<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it would help you figure it out. :-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, thanks for asking. I will share who the two oldest are so I <br/>
can at least get them out on the table here.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is male, 15. Noah is incredibly gifted with anything that <br/>
requires his hands. He has done string games, origami, <br/>
puzzles, computer games, clay sculpting, piano, guitar, wiki <br/>
sticks, rock climbing and drawing. His interest in piano is a true <br/>
depiction of his personality.<br/>
<br/>
He heard the song Rondo Ala Turka (Mozart) on the Pride and <br/>
Prejudice videos four years ago. Suddenly he wanted to learn to <br/>
play the piano. I told him he could take lessons. He brought the <br/>
sheet music to his first lesson and never did use the intro to <br/>
piano music. He started with Mozart. and immediately learned to <br/>
play. Played non-stop all the time, no reminders to practice.<br/>
<br/>
In three years time, he became her most gifted student. <br/>
However, conversely, he stopped practicing and kept forgetting <br/>
his lessons during the last six months. I finally stopped the <br/>
lessons (not wanting to pay for what he wasn&#39;t doing). Broke my <br/>
heart. His talent and passion all gone by the way side. No more <br/>
playing for the joy of it.<br/>
<br/>
Then suddenly, since Christmas, he took up playing again, but <br/>
on his own. This time he is playing Vanessa Carlton round the <br/>
clock. And he&#39;s playing extremely well. I asked him what was <br/>
going on. His words: I like this music. I got tired of my teacher.<br/>
<br/>

She is active online with an international community of Elijah <br/>
Wood fans. She&#39;s got friends all over the world sending her <br/>
letters and gifts and invitations to visit. :) She reads voraciously. <br/>
And she&#39;s written two novellas.<br/>
<br/>
This is a highly gifted girl in relational skills (opposite her <br/>
brother). She used to have stronger interests (i.e. vintage dance, <br/>
art, costume deisgn). She is more interested now in acting and <br/>

Good!  That&#39;s what I wanted to say.  Learning is definitely not<br/>
something that stops just because people leave school.<br/>

And I often think that history and literature are more delightful to an<br/>
