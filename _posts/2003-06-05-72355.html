<div id="ygrps-yiv-444529301">My husband just found out that his company is more likely than not<br/>
moving to NV.  That means, so are we.  I&#39;ve just gotten used to<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling in CA where the laws are so flexible.  I<br/>
checked out the Nevada homeschool association website the other day<br/>
and tried to read the laws and OMG!  They sounded so confusing and<br/>
complex.  Of course, reading the law always sounds that way. <br/>
So....I&#39;m hoping someone from NV might be able to help me.  I&#39;m not<br/>
asking for legal advice, I&#39;m just wondering what the NV homeschoolers<br/>
are required to do, from people who actually live there and are doing<br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Melissa<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  anyone in the Las Vegas area?  That&#39;s where we would be moving<br/>
to and we know no one there.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50835665">There is a conference happening in Las Vegas in a couple of weeks -  <br/>
maybe you could go. It&#39;ll be a good one and  a GREAT way to meet  <br/>
homeschoolers and get up-to-date info. They had a legislative victory  <br/>
there in the past year - so you&#39;d need to be sure your info is current.<br/>
<br/>
To find the info - go to the NHEN website (www.nhen.org) and click on  <br/>
networking on the top menu on events on the dropdown. You&#39;ll see all  <br/>
the June conferences listed there.<br/>
