&lt;&lt;  I can&#39;t remember the last time I needed to recite my ABC&#39;s. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY time I have seen an adult recite their ABC&#39;s is for a sobriety test. <br/>
 hehehehe.  And that is DEFINANLTY nothing to aspire for.<br/>

schoolers do you know what color this is??  While pointing to object<br/>

They also love to ask them to say the ABC&#39;s.  My six yr old can&#39;t do<br/>
this, and who cares?  I can&#39;t remember the last time I needed to recite<br/>
my ABC&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
ABC&#39;s aren&#39;t the be all end all, but they are helpful for filing and the library, and finding a fav movie at the video store.<br/>
<br/>
ABC&#39;s come with time, reading and experience - I wish folks (in-laws, nosy neighbors, etc.) would realize that.<br/>

Actually my parents used to do this even before we started homeschooling. I <br/>
am not sure if they were actually quizzing my kids, to find out if I was <br/>
preparing them for school, or if it was just a natural part of looking at <br/>
books and asking questions.  Come to think of it, I have done this myself <br/>
with my own kids, and with other kids I am reading to.  I am not sure why I <br/>
even do it.  Do I do it as part of our natural conversation while reading, or <br/>
is it so engrained in me from being exposed to years of public school myself? <br/>
  Hmmmmm  It is something to think about!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979400607">Well, that kind of discussion is normal, I do that too.  What I object to is the<br/>
obvious quiz about nothing.<br/>
Just is so pointless and unfair to my kids....or any kids.<br/>
