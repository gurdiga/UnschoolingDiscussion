<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490311464">I honestly think all people manipulate one way or another. Not in a <br/>
mean, nasty way. It&#39;s not like a conscious thing most people do. We <br/>
learned it as children... actually, I think we just figured it out. <br/>
And then we just grew up with it and developed it. It&#39;s not a word <br/>
to be avoided because so much can be learned about oneself from it. <br/>
How do I do this? Why? Do I know I am doing this?<br/>
<br/>
There was a radio show that has a Buddhist monk on it. I can&#39;t <br/>
remember the monk&#39;s name, I&#39;m so sorry. But he talked about how we <br/>
all use manipulation and that people have really thrown it into such <br/>
a negative light they don&#39;t see it for what it is. It is the art of <br/>
getting one&#39;s needs met according to one&#39;s personal ideals. Mostly <br/>
they are such an undercurrent and so everyday, the person is not <br/>
aware of it. His idea was that one should not fear it or get angry <br/>
over the word and give it a negative tone unless it something that <br/>
you do fear because you do it yourself. Follow me? I hope I&#39;m being <br/>
clear with this. Pardon if it&#39;s confusing. <br/>
<br/>
Basically, to get to know yourself and how you function (many times <br/>
through mistakes, embarrassing moments, or small lessons in the <br/>
mundane) we accidentally discover our forms of mild to major <br/>
manipulation and how to deal with them accordingly, if at all. It <br/>
was quite interesting and wish I had more information to give you <br/>
all about that radio show and the monk. But wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>
interesting to understand bettet?<br/>
<br/>
I know I use manipulation and I&#39;m not thrilled when I do it. It&#39;s <br/>
embarrassing and feels negative to me. I caught myself doing this <br/>
when I first became ill. I wanted help and needed help but wasn&#39;t <br/>
use to asking for it and wasn&#39;t use to telling my son I expected it <br/>
from him, so it went something like this: I wanted my son to do the <br/>
laundry and he&#39;s playing games. Instead of just asking him to do the <br/>
laundry after he&#39;s done with the level he was on, I would say <br/>
something like:&quot; I wish I had someone who could help me with <br/>
laundry. It&#39;s so hard to do this all the time on my own when I can <br/>
barely get up and down the stairs.&quot; What was that all about? Why did <br/>
I feel I would be getting a better response from him than being <br/>
direct? Where did I learn it? Did it just develop naturally because <br/>
it&#39;s a human thing to do? <br/>
<br/>
I analyzed it, apologized to my son about it and then we talked <br/>
about it. I don&#39;t do that anymore...it took realizing it, though, <br/>
and not being afraid to admit it to myself. Though it stings. A <br/>
friend of mine pointed out that all we (people as a whole) do is <br/>
manipulate. He didn&#39;t mean it in a negative tone, either. So... can <br/>
we really call it all manipulation? Isn&#39;t it interesting how hung up <br/>
we get on a word? Does it have that much power or only the power we <br/>
give it?<br/>
<br/>
Okay... spent enough time on the putie for the day... you all take <br/>
care!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

But how sad that this is true.  I know that in the context of parenting an infant most folks from my parents&#39; generation think that a crying baby is trying to manipulate his parents.  And, at least in my circle of friends, we think that is absurd and many docs and other professionals will plainly state that an infant is not capable of true manipulation.  But I think when we look at what this word means, really, that babies are attempting to manipulate their parents by crying.  They are attempting to manipulate their environments to get their needs met.  They are crying because they need to be held, or whatever.  Later they may cry not simply as an expression of sadness but because they are trying to communicate that they have a need and want someone to attend to it.  If the child is hungry, this is clearly not a negative thing.  But they are trying to affect others&#39; behaviors to meet their own needs.  What is this if not manipulation?  Even in situations that would normally be seen in a negative light, such as a toddler or preschooler &quot;acting out&quot; to get the parents attention.  They are trying to meet their own need for more attention from the parents and are willing to be persistent and try out all sorts of strategies to get those needs met.  I see that as a great thing.  So while I agree that the word manipulation is going to have a negative connotation attached to it, I feel sad about that and regret it, because I do not know of a positive connotation counterpart word.  Maybe strategizing?  I am not sure at what point taking efforts to meet our own needs became such an ugly thing?  Are we supposed to be forever self-less?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;:&quot; I wish I had someone who could help me with <br/>
laundry. It&#39;s so hard to do this all the time on my own when I can <br/>
barely get up and down the stairs.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t see this as being a problematic way to communicate that you need help.  YOu are stating that it is hard for you and that you wish you had help.  What is wrong with that?  Now, if you were saying it with a tone of shame, that would be different, but stating it as a wish rather than a demand leaves your son to have compassion for you and then to either choose to help or not.  I think you might be too hard on yourself for this.  It is okay to ask for help directly, and I think it is okay to just state you are having a hard time and then leave it to others to deduce an action that might be helpful to you.  Another alternative helpful action your son could have taken would be to move your landry machines upstairs :-)  Maybe not realistic, but it&#39;s another strategy he could have used to help you from his own heart, which might have been inspired by your comment.<br/>
<br/>
Something to think about.<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;d seen him on TV or video, you might remember his name by the way he <br/>

Kirby&#39;s really interested in the memory tricks he&#39;s learning in a college <br/>
success class he&#39;s taking.  They talk about how many ways something can be <br/>
remembered, and if there are two aspects or more, even better.  The world really IS <br/>
taken in through all our senses, and the more we taste, touch, smell, hear and <br/>
see, the more we know.<br/>

This is not a good definition of manipulation:  &quot;It is the art of <br/>
<br/>
getting one&#39;s needs met according to one&#39;s personal ideals.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Not at all.<br/>
Or I do, but I neither like where it&#39;s going nor comfortably believe a <br/>
Buddhist monk on the radio said manipulation isn&#39;t a word with a negative tone.   <br/>
For one thing, English dictionaries outrank all the buddhist monks on earth when <br/>
it comes to the meanings of words in English, and manipulation has more to do <br/>
with marionette puppetry than with Buddhism.<br/>

Luckily, you have a world of options, not just martyrly hinting, and not just <br/>
&quot;turn that off now and do this because I said so.&quot;    Communication can be <br/>
honest AND compassionate, and our children&#39;s needs don&#39;t have to take a back <br/>
seat to ours all the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=A friend of mine pointed out that all we (people as a whole) do is <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Why didn&#39;t he say &quot;persuade&quot; then, or &quot;convince&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-= So... can we really call it all manipulation? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Your friend did, and you&#39;re defending that.<br/>
You think you heard a Buddhist monk defend it on the radio, and you&#39;re <br/>
defending that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Isn&#39;t it interesting how hung up we get on a word?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Only people who care about words and ideas and thoughts bother to get hung up <br/>
on words.   Others say &quot;this is only semantics.&quot;  (Another way to phrase that <br/>
is, &quot;I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re talking about because I can&#39;t tell the <br/>
difference between those two ideas, and I think I&#39;m about to lose an argument.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Does it have that much power or only the power we give it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If I fall in the tiger pit at the zoo, it won&#39;t matter later how much power I <br/>
gave the tigers.  If they&#39;re hungry, I&#39;m gone.<br/>
<br/>
With words, words become thoughts (ideally) or they represent thoughts.   <br/>
Clear thoughts need clear words.  Carefully considered thoughts deserve carefully <br/>
considered words.<br/>
<br/>
One important word-thought for unschoolers is to separate clearly &quot;teaching&quot; <br/>
from &quot;learning.&quot;    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
<br/>
That has to do with how much power one gives what regarding how people learn.<br/>
<br/>
I think words are important.   Discussion lists exist because of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069311356">** Isn&#39;t it interesting how hung up we get on a word?  **<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;manipulative&quot; definitely has a negative connotation when <br/>
applied to how people treat people.  There is an important distinction: <br/>
we all manipulate objects, but it is considered sneaky and nearly <br/>
dishonest to manipulate people.<br/>
<br/>
My mom labled me as &quot;manipulative &quot;as a young teen when I was trying to <br/>
persuade her to drive me somewhere on a busy weekend.  I was surprised <br/>
and hurt, because I was just trying to meet my needs (or if not needs, <br/>
wishes).  I wasn&#39;t deliberately trying to make her feel guilty.  I was <br/>
trying to get past the logistical problems that she told me were the <br/>
reason that she wasn&#39;t going to do it.  (I remember asking whether one <br/>
activity could be moved from Sat to Sun, and whether my brother could <br/>
take BART to get either to or from the activity that she was taking him <br/>
to.  The rest of it is gone from my memory, but the word &quot;manipulative&quot; <br/>
is burned in, because I was so surprised at the put down and I didn&#39;t <br/>
think it was fair.)  I think she just wanted to say &quot;no&quot; to me and <br/>
wanted my only response to be &quot;okay&quot;.  I didn&#39;t think I could get where <br/>
I wanted (at least 30 miles away) without going through her, but she <br/>
shamed me about trying to &quot;use her&quot; to get what I wanted.  But what was <br/>
I supposed to do ?  Be completely independent when I was still <br/>
dependent?  Not want anything that wasn&#39;t really, really convenient?  Is <br/>
that feasible? <br/>
<br/>
Like babies, kids too young to transport themselves and to earn money to <br/>
pay for their own activities need and/or want help from their parents.  <br/>
I&#39;d be interested in discussing what&#39;s reasonable and unreasonable in <br/>
how to ask and how to deal with an initial response of &quot;no&quot;.    What&#39;s  <br/>
a legitimate way to ask and what&#39;s skunky?  Obviously I know that <br/>
arguments that resemble the old line &quot;if you LOVED me, you&#39;d have sex <br/>
with me&quot; ARE manipulative.  (And really strange examples when I started <br/>
off talking about my mom.)  Are there some principles of honest <br/>
communication that we can elaborate here?<br/>
<br/>
I think if I heard a &quot;justification&quot; or &quot;manipulative argument&quot; from my <br/>
spouse or my kid, I would point out the flaws in the argument, not the <br/>
flaws in the person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071091375">Yup, I believe you&#39;re right. It does have a highly negative tone.  <br/>
What would be the word one would use instead of manipulation? I <br/>
mean, honestly, I don&#39;t know which word to use. When the Buddhist <br/>
monk used the word manipulation and spoke about it, it did not give <br/>
it a negative sound at all. It honestly didn&#39;t. It had a very <br/>
innocent ring to it. It&#39;s so hard to explain it. Has anyone read <br/>
anything on Buddhism and the way they view emotions and human <br/>
actions? Do you know what I am trying to hint at here? Cuz I&#39;m <br/>
having a heck of a hard time putting it into words. Maybe someone <br/>

I just started the list and Im sorry i didnt see the original post on SID. I have an aspie,possible add 5 year old and a nonverbal autistic 3 year old. I use several different sensory therapies with both of them. <br/>
 <br/>
If you want to give examples/expand more on your question of how does a parent offter the world to a child who is overstimulated through some senses and barely gets anything through others I would be more than happy to share therapies I use for different situations and others that may work for your child. How old is your child btw?<br/>

have gone through what I am now going through. As well, it is nice to have <br/>
those same people willing to open up their lives to a stranger.<br/>
My heart is filled every moment of every day that I spend with my son or <br/>
think about him or share stories about him. So when I can share a bit about <br/>
him and benefit from the imput I get back, it is a win/win situation (well <br/>
for me at least, hope that&#39;s not too selfish).<br/>
So that leads me to my next question...<br/>
..If the world is taken in through all our senses, how does a parent offer <br/>
the world to a child who is overly stimulated (I hope that is the correct <br/>
word) through some senses and gets very little from the others?<br/>
I swear sometimes I make my life more difficult by disecting the silliest of <br/>
things to a state that is unrecognisable to the rest of the world. But if <br/>
you get me, then good. I obviously need alot of HEELLLPPPP!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-405816447">Thank you, Sandra, for this list of words.  Sometimes I need a vocabulary lesson &lt;g&gt;.  I do definitely agree that the word manipulate has negative connotations to it.  But I have been at a loss for a word that equals that without the negativism.  &quot;Communicate&quot; I am not sure carries the same idea of being a strategy to meet a need, but I think all together the list does.  But, does persuade have a negative feel to it too?  What about influence?  In any case, I am happy to have a bigger bag of words from which to pull.  And yes, I absolutely agree that the thoughtful choice of words makes communication efficient and effective and shows caring about the people involved and the subject matter.  It is definitely important.  Though sometimes I think people attribute their own unique nuances to words.  Like differing cultures do, but I think this happens even within micro or sub cultures as well.  I&#39;ve found that saying the words sir or maam bring smiles to faces where I am from, however, they are likely to get you slapped where my husband is from.  <br/>
<br/>
How is this related to unschooling?  I am not sure, but it is interesting discussion anyway.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Has anyone read <br/>
anything on Buddhism and the way they view emotions and human <br/>
actions? Do you know what I am trying to hint at here? Cuz I&#39;m <br/>
having a heck of a hard time putting it into words. Maybe someone <br/>
else might know what I am very poorly trying to get at...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have not read anything on Buddhism past what I learned in a college comparative religion class.  Yet I believe NVC philosophy is loosely similar.  NVC believes that all actions are in attempt to meet needs, and see detriment in conversation to apply judgment to actions, outside of the context of one&#39;s own opinions.  I am not sure I can express any better than you have, but I think I hear what you are saying.  I agree that sometimes I have heard the word manipulation used in ways that it really didn&#39;t sound negative, and perhaps sometimes the tone and/or context in which a word is used holds as much weight and meaning for the word as the simple definition alone.  I am thinking now after more thought that my words above about nuance in culture is what is at work here.  In Buddhist and NVC culture, manipulation would probably be defined as strategy to meet needs, and not carry a negative tone.  But I agree with Pam and Sandra and others here that in the popular culture the word has a negative meaning related to being sneaky or .... perhaps strategy to meet needs that disregards the needs of others.  Meaning, the manipulator attempts to influence the behavior of another person to his own benefit, without regard for the probably negative impact on that other person.  Very different meanings, attributable to differences in culture.  I personally prefer to live (in my consciousness) within the NVC culture, but I do physically need to live and get along in the popular culture.  I think that choosing to not hear the negative aspect of such words helps subscribers to the philosophy to live with more internal peace and to affect less violence on the world around them.  I think this applies to unschooling in that I personally find it to be a nicer environment in which to grow up, hearing and respecting the needs of others without violent thoughts, as opposed to school culture which is full of judgment and criticism and shame and pressure and violence.<br/>
<br/>
Susan, am I getting close at all?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126657306">I&#39;ve had situations lately where I&#39;ve wondered if I&#39;m being too <br/>
manipulative.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day, I scheduled a playdate for my 5 year old Luke.  He <br/>
knew about it and was excited about it the day before.  We were <br/>
supposed to meet 2 of his friends at a children&#39;s museum but it <br/>
didn&#39;t work out for one of them and so the other one invited us to <br/>
their house to play.  He was asleep when I worked all this out, the <br/>
morning of the playdate, but I figured a playdate at a house with <br/>
different toys would be just as much fun as a children&#39;s museum.  <br/>
<br/>
He woke up and said he wasn&#39;t going.  What was I going to do?  I <br/>
really didn&#39;t feel comfortable calling back and saying, &quot;Ooops, so <br/>
sorry, he doesn&#39;t want to come anymore&quot;.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have made <br/>
a change in plans without his consent, but honestly, he really wanted <br/>
to go on this playdate the day before, and I think he would have <br/>
said &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; even if the plans hadn&#39;t changed at all.  He <br/>
does the &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; thing quite often before we go somewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
So I bribed him with stopping for a hot dog and hot chocolate at a <br/>
Turkey Hill on the way (He loves hot dogs).  He said he&#39;d go to the <br/>
turkey hill but not to the house.  I said okay, knowing at least it <br/>
would get him in the car.  If I had said, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to do <br/>
both&quot;, I couldn&#39;t have gotten him in the car. But after we got the <br/>
hot dog I said, &quot;Let&#39;s just go to their house and if you don&#39;t like <br/>
it you don&#39;t have to stay long&quot;.  We got there and he refused to go <br/>
in. I carried him in thinking that if he saw the toys and his friend <br/>
he&#39;d be okay.  He ran out of the house and back into the car. So I <br/>
told him I wanted to go in and that he could wait in the car.  The <br/>
house was out in the country, I parked right by the front door, and I <br/>
sat by a window in the house where I could see the car.  He sat out <br/>
in the car for I&#39;d say 20 minutes before he came in.  I went out to <br/>
check on him once, the little girl went out to ask him if he wanted <br/>
to play, the other mom went out to try to tempt him with toys.  He <br/>
eventually came in and warmed up to everything and had a wonderful <br/>
time.  He didn&#39;t want to leave when it was time to go.  <br/>
<br/>
So I manipulated him I guess, by tempting him with a hot dog and <br/>
going in the house and letting him in the car, knowing that he&#39;d want <br/>
to come and join me eventually.  <br/>
<br/>
I manipulate my kids almost every time they give me the &quot;I&#39;m not <br/>
going&quot; &quot;Why can&#39;t we just stay home&quot; stuff before something we <br/>
planned to do.  (And I don&#39;t over-schedule stuff at all, so that&#39;s <br/>
not the issue--they just like to stay home).  <br/>
<br/>
Another time when I think I manipulate a bit is at bedtime.  They <br/>
don&#39;t want to go to bed, but I do.   Yet they want me to tuck them <br/>
in, including reading to each of them individually, singing to them, <br/>
etc.  If I don&#39;t start tucking in before midnight, I&#39;m up until 3 am <br/>
or later, and I need to go to bed earlier than that sometimes.  If <br/>
I&#39;m not going to be grumpy while I&#39;m helping them get to sleep, it&#39;s <br/>
got to be earlier than that.  Lately they&#39;ve been whining &quot;Oh, not <br/>
yet!&quot;  when I say I&#39;m ready to start tucking someone in.  So I <br/>
say, &quot;Okay, but I&#39;m going to bed.  You can stay up if you want, but <br/>
then you won&#39;t be tucked in&quot;.  And they do NOT want to go to bed <br/>
without being tucked in so they grudgingly allow me to do it.  I&#39;m <br/>
getting sick of hearing, &quot;It&#39;s not fair, I&#39;m not tired yet, why do I <br/>
have to get tucked in before him, etc.&quot; every night.  Is it <br/>
manipulative for me to say, &quot;If you want to be tucked in, it has to <br/>
be now, because I&#39;m not going to stay up until 3 am tonight. You can <br/>
stay up on your own if you want&quot;, when I know very well that they <br/>
don&#39;t want to stay up on their own and they will go to bed when I say <br/>
because they want to be tucked in.  If I don&#39;t manipulate them into <br/>
going to bed earlier than they want, they manipulate me into staying <br/>
up later than I want.  Both happens, and it&#39;s manipulation either <br/>
way.  <br/>
<br/>
And the other night, my 5 year old wanted to take a shower at 1 am <br/>
and I was going to bed.  I&#39;m not comfortable with him being in the <br/>
tub while I&#39;m asleep.  I *can&#39;t* sleep with him in the shower.  I <br/>
actually can&#39;t sleep when he&#39;s awake at all.  My other two (older) <br/>
kids I&#39;m okay with them being up later than me, but I just can&#39;t <br/>
sleep when my 5 year old&#39;s up.  I outright refused to turn the shower <br/>
water on for him and told him that he can&#39;t take a shower when I&#39;m in <br/>
bed.  I told him I&#39;d help him get the shower water on in the morning, <br/>
but not now.  So that&#39;s an arbitrary rule I have going for him I <br/>
guess.  His 11 year old sister could get up and take a shower while <br/>
I&#39;m asleep and I&#39;m cool with that.  Luke gets an arbitrary, &quot;No, you <br/>
cannot take a shower if there aren&#39;t any adults awake in the house&quot;.  <br/>
I don&#39;t like having that rule, but I can&#39;t get around the &quot;What if he <br/>
falls asleep in the tub&quot; thoughts going through my head.  <br/>
<br/>
I genuinely am getting tired of them complaining about going to bed <br/>
every night.  It feels like I&#39;m making them go to bed, even though <br/>
they know they have the freedom to stay up longer than me if they <br/>
want to.  I really would like things to go more smoothly, and I would <br/>
really like them to not look back on their childhoods with memories <br/>
of me manipulating them into going to bed earlier than they wanted <br/>
to.  <br/>

<br/>
================<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d see it as helping him keep an appointment, in the situation you  <br/>
described.  Yeah, plans changed and he didn&#39;t know, but waking him up to  ask wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have helped.<br/>
 <br/>

going&quot; &quot;Why can&#39;t we just stay home&quot; stuff before something we <br/>
planned  to do. =-<br/>
 <br/>
My husband and I do that to each other.  If we had cancelled every  time one <br/>
of us sighed or expressed hesitation about going to a party or a  meeting, <br/>
we&#39;d&#39;ve missed some good stuff.  Sometimes I don&#39;t want to do a  singing thing <br/>
(practice, or a party) and sometimes he doesn&#39;t, but unless BOTH  of us are <br/>
foot-dragging, we go ahead and do it, and almost always have a great  time.  We <br/>
know this after years of togetherness.  And with group  singing, it just doesn&#39;t <br/>
happen without lots of people there, and we know if we  want people to keep <br/>
getting together we&#39;re going to have to be there a  lot.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-<br/>
Another time when I think I manipulate a bit is at bedtime.   They <br/>
don&#39;t want to go to bed, but I do.  -=-<br/>
 <br/>
If you say &quot;I&#39;m tired and the only way we can do these things is to do them  <br/>
soon,&quot; how is that manipulation?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Is it <br/>

be now, because I&#39;m not going to stay up until 3 am tonight. You can  <br/>
stay up on your own if you want&quot;=-<br/>
 <br/>
Not at all.<br/>
 <br/>
-=- If I don&#39;t manipulate them into <br/>
going to bed earlier than they  want, they manipulate me into staying <br/>
up later than I want.  Both  happens, and it&#39;s manipulation either <br/>
way.  <br/>
=-<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think so.  If you all see what&#39;s happening and aren&#39;t tricked  or <br/>
blindsided, how is it manipulation?<br/>
 <br/>
-=- I told him I&#39;d help him get the shower water on in the morning, <br/>
but  not now.  So that&#39;s an arbitrary rule I have going for him I  <br/>
guess. =-<br/>
 <br/>
Sounds like a safety rule and that&#39;s not arbitrary.<br/>
 <br/>

really  like them to not look back on their childhoods with memories <br/>
of me  manipulating them into going to bed earlier than they wanted <br/>
to.   <br/>
=-<br/>
 <br/>
IF they want to stay up, and if they can do it quietly, they can.<br/>
IF they want to go to bed with you or get tucked in, those have to happen  <br/>
earlier.<br/>
If your youngest wants to take a bath he needs to do it when you&#39;re  <br/>
available to check on him and help him get out and all.  <br/>
 <br/>
None of that is manipulation.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s arbitrary Sheila, I think you&#39;re concerned about his<br/>
ability to take care of himself.<br/>
<br/>
How long is he usually in the shower?  Could one of your older kids<br/>
shower with him?  Would one of them look out for him if he showered while<br/>
you were in bed?   Could you go to bed with a walkie talkie and he could<br/>
have the other and he could buzz you when he&#39;s out? <br/>
<br/>
Someday you&#39;ll know he&#39;ll be ok in the shower on his own.   <br/>
<br/>
***And they do NOT want to go to bed <br/>
without being tucked in so they grudgingly allow me to do it. ***<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re ok with them being up later than you but *they* want to be tucked<br/>
in, is that right?   Could you create some other ritual instead of the<br/>
tucking in?  Could you wind them up in a blanket and kiss them all over<br/>
their faces and they can all to snore like they&#39;re asleep so you can go<br/>
to bed, but then they can scramble out and play a little longer? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the tucking in isn&#39;t as important as a little time with you at the<br/>
end of the day and that time could be changed from *you* tucking them in<br/>
to them tucking *you* in? <br/>
<br/>
***So I manipulated him I guess, by tempting him with a hot dog and <br/>

<br/>
Lots of moms would have dumped him there never mind his feelings. <br/>
All along he had choices whether to participate or not.  He finally made<br/>
the choice to play and he had fun.  If he&#39;d stayed in the car you&#39;d have<br/>
taken him home, right?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;d be easier on him to have kids come to your house? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think what you described is manipulation.  I think that&#39;s how<br/>
people live together. <br/>

ourselves to help ourselves when talking to others. But it doesn&#39;t help us<br/>
communicate with others any better. We can choose to not hear negatives in<br/>
words others use towards us, but we can&#39;t prevent others from hearing the<br/>

But I think it&#39;s a huge leap to expect someone trying to get to unschooling<br/>
to also adopt the philosophy of not hearing negativity in words! It&#39;s lots<br/>
easier to find words that are positive and more descriptive.<br/>

&gt; supposed to meet 2 of his friends at a children&#39;s museum but it <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t work out for one of them and so the other one invited us to <br/>
&gt; their house to play.  He was asleep when I worked all this out, the <br/>
&gt; morning of the playdate, but I figured a playdate at a house with <br/>
&gt; different toys would be just as much fun as a children&#39;s museum.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He woke up and said he wasn&#39;t going.  What was I going to do?  I <br/>
&gt; really didn&#39;t feel comfortable calling back and saying, &quot;Ooops, so <br/>
&gt; sorry, he doesn&#39;t want to come anymore&quot;.  Maybe I shouldn&#39;t have made <br/>
&gt; a change in plans without his consent, but honestly, he really wanted <br/>
&gt; to go on this playdate the day before, and I think he would have <br/>
&gt; said &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; even if the plans hadn&#39;t changed at all.  He <br/>
&gt; does the &quot;I&#39;m not going&quot; thing quite often before we go somewhere.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So I bribed him with stopping for a hot dog and hot chocolate at a <br/>
&gt; Turkey Hill on the way (He loves hot dogs).  He said he&#39;d go to the <br/>
&gt; turkey hill but not to the house.  I said okay, knowing at least it <br/>
&gt; would get him in the car.  If I had said, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to do <br/>
&gt; both&quot;, I couldn&#39;t have gotten him in the car. But after we got the <br/>
&gt; hot dog I said, &quot;Let&#39;s just go to their house and if you don&#39;t like <br/>
&gt; it you don&#39;t have to stay long&quot;.  We got there and he refused to go <br/>
&gt; in. I carried him in thinking that if he saw the toys and his friend <br/>
&gt; he&#39;d be okay.  He ran out of the house and back into the car. So I <br/>
&gt; told him I wanted to go in and that he could wait in the car.  The <br/>
&gt; house was out in the country, I parked right by the front door, and I <br/>
&gt; sat by a window in the house where I could see the car.  He sat out <br/>
&gt; in the car for I&#39;d say 20 minutes before he came in.  I went out to <br/>
&gt; check on him once, the little girl went out to ask him if he wanted <br/>
&gt; to play, the other mom went out to try to tempt him with toys.  He <br/>
&gt; eventually came in and warmed up to everything and had a wonderful <br/>
&gt; time.  He didn&#39;t want to leave when it was time to go. </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482796918">I would say that is not manipulative to have some limits in what you do <br/>
for your kids as long as you are honest with them.  (&quot;I need to go to <br/>
bed soon.  If you want me to read a story tonight, let&#39;s start it now.&quot;) <br/>
<br/>
I do relate to what you said about a kid who wants to back out of doing <br/>
things at the last minute, when up to that point he&#39;d been fairly <br/>
willing.  That happens at my house.  And my son is remarkably resistant <br/>
to coaxing.   I&#39;m working a bit on figuring out at the end of outings <br/>
what was enjoyable and what was just endurable.  (Say we went to a <br/>
museum with friends enjoyed 20% of the museum exhibits and 95% of the <br/>
friends.  I&#39;m aiming to figure out how to make future outings and <br/>
playdates better, so that he can look forwards to them.  When he&#39;s <br/>
reluctant, I&#39;d like to know what his concerns are more clearly.  But my <br/>
kid is almost 11, he can explain himself really well, if he has specific <br/>
concerns and not just free-floating anxiety.)<br/>
<br/>
**but I just can&#39;t sleep when my 5 year old&#39;s up.**<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t either when my son was that young.  But maybe my kid was more <br/>
clingy at that age?  He wouldn&#39;t stay up alone (so siblings).  But I <br/>
think that advice that has been offered here about kids staying up alone <br/>
is mostly aimed at kids older than 5.  (And I really can&#39;t imagine 3 <br/>
year olds staying up alone.)  I agree that I&#39;m not comfortable with <br/>
young kids having lots of time awake when the parental supervision has <br/>
fallen asleep.  (My ten going on eleven year old&#39;s &quot;staying up pattern&quot; <br/>
is just watching one TV episode and going to bed.  He&#39;s not cooking, <br/>
bathing, playing in the street, or running with scissors &lt;g&gt; while I&#39;m <br/>
sleeping.  At least that&#39;s not the plan.)  Some people may have a much <br/>
higher tolerance for risk than I do, or more adept children, or more <br/>
childproof homes.  My 2 cents.<br/>
<br/>
**I genuinely am getting tired of them complaining about going to bed <br/>
every night.**<br/>
<br/>
I think you should examine your feelings and try to figure out why you <br/>
aren&#39;t comfortable with their feelings.  (I haven&#39;t had to listen to it, <br/>
and I&#39;m not you, so I don&#39;t know.)  Do you want them to have different <br/>
feelings, different behavior, or to just get through the bedtime <br/>
resistance faster?  A more pleasant bedtime would be great for <br/>
everybody.  Are there other ways (than staying up forever) that you can <br/>
contribute to making it more pleasant?<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
**but I can&#39;t get around the &quot;What if he falls asleep in the tub&quot; <br/>
thoughts going through my head.**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll fall asleep if he is taking a stand up shower.  If <br/>
he slips you wouldn&#39;t be there much faster awake or asleep.  (Unless you <br/>
normally stay in the bathroom with him.)  BUT, my husband had huge <br/>
insomnia Thursday night and did fall asleep in the bathtub Friday night <br/>
right after getting home from work and 36 hours of being awake.  <br/>
Fortunately he&#39;s pretty tightly wedged in there and couldn&#39;t slip down <br/>
under the water.)</div>

&lt;&lt; <br/>
Could people who have opinions on the play date hot dog bribe story<br/>
(excerpted below) please elaborate a bit on why they think it was or<br/>
wasn&#39;t manipulative?  If I&#39;m counting right I saw two &quot;non-manipulative<br/>
method of persuasion&quot; and no &quot;manipulation&quot; votes, and I was a bit<br/>
surprised.  Was it primarily the happy ending, or do people just not<br/>
find the series of events manipulative? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Manipulation would&#39;ve been saying, &quot;No, I&#39;m just going to get gas, come on,&quot; <br/>
and then saying, &quot;Oh!  I think I left my glasses in Susie&#39;s mom&#39;s car!&quot; and <br/>
then pulling up and saying, &quot;Gosh, since we&#39;re here, you want to play?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
If my  husband wants me to go with him somewhere, he might try to sweeten the <br/>
deal by offering to go with me to something he usually avoids, or offering <br/>
dinner at my favorite restaurant on the way.  <br/>
<br/>
If Holly wants a friend to come over, she might offer to guarantee to play <br/>
the thing the friend likes best, even if it wouldn&#39;t be Holly&#39;s first choice.  <br/>
It would only be manipulation if she weasled out of it after the friend got <br/>
here, I think.  If she actually DOES play Barbies or house for two hours, that <br/>
was negotiation, not manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
I have physically carried kids before, mostly out, rather than in.   With <br/>
really young kids who arent&#39; so far removed from being carried by their mom, it&#39;s <br/>
not so off.<br/>
<br/>
Marty, even in the past few years, has a habit of panicking before he does <br/>
something.  We applied for and got him accepted into the junior police academy, <br/>
which he loved and I knew he would love, and he wanted to do.  The weekend <br/>
before, he started reciting the reasons he should just not go.  I countered them <br/>
all.  I told him he needed to go and SEE, not just decide based on his <br/>
imagination.  It was one of the best weeks of his life so far, and he thought so <br/>
within an hour of getting in there.  Had I let his hesitation stop the whole <br/>
thing, I wouldn&#39;t have been a very good partner.  I didn&#39;t carry him, but I said, <br/>
&quot;NO, they let you in, not everyone got in, you have an obligation to do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby wanted to quit karate, I was disappointed but I remembered being <br/>
18 and so I didn&#39;t press very hard.   He went that Tuesday intending to talk to <br/>
his teacher and say he needed a break.  When he got home four hours later <br/>
(having stayed for two other classes after he taught the beginning class), he was <br/>
totally energized and said when he saw the little kids he just couldn&#39;t quit.<br/>
<br/>
So a slump, whether it lasts days with a teen or minutes with a toddler, can <br/>
be overcome by persuasion and inspiration, and if a mom is honest and says &quot;I <br/>
think you&#39;ll have fun, let&#39;s at least go and try for a minute,&quot; that&#39;s a <br/>
useful mom thing to do.   I don&#39;t like it about spinach, but in most cases it&#39;s <br/>
kinda reasonable with social situations or museum displays or climbing equipment <br/>
or swings.  (Kids with serious aversions or conditions are excepted from my <br/>
&quot;most cases.&quot;)<br/>

Exactly.  It&#39;s about not having arbitrary limits, not about encouraging kids <br/>
to stay up as long as they possibly can.  Not enforcing an 8:00 bedtime isn&#39;t <br/>
the same as saying &quot;I don&#39;t care if or when you sleep.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That was pretty much how I read it.  I felt bad for the boy.  I personally<br/>
think it isn&#39;t very respectful to carry an unwilling child into a house or<br/>
to trick him (even by omission) to get him to go somewhere.   If I knew it<br/>
was pretty likely that my child would change his mind about wanting to go<br/>
somewhere at the last minute, I would only accept invitations to things that<br/>
it&#39;s o.k. to not go to at the last minute.  Things where the other people<br/>
aren&#39;t affected if you don&#39;t go, as in a park day. The stage he is in won&#39;t<br/>
last forever.  I would stop asking him if he wanted to arrange play dates at<br/>
all unless he approached me first with that need. Sometimes kids say yes<br/>
because they think that is the answer you are looking for. If you have the<br/>
need to be with other moms, maybe they would be willing to come to your<br/>
house to visit for a while.  Perhaps you can explain your situation to them<br/>
and they&#39;ll understand.  <br/>

She agreed that that was the only place they would go.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
20 minutes of sitting in the car is a long time to a 5 yo.  I&#39;ll bet he felt<br/>
like he had stayed long enough to be able to home at that point, because she<br/>
said if you don&#39;t like it, you don&#39;t have to stay long. <br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt; We got there and he refused to go<br/>

he&#39;d be okay. He ran out of the house and back into the car. So I<br/>
told him I wanted to go in and that he could wait in the car.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am not so sure you can compare a 5 yo&#39;s play date at a friend&#39;s house,<br/>
which he didn&#39;t agree to go to in the first place, with a teenager&#39;s<br/>
pre-planned application and acceptance to the junior police academy, which<br/>
he then was unsure of attending after being accepted, possibly out of<br/>
nervousness.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If my  husband wants me to go with him somewhere, he might try to<br/>
sweeten the <br/>
deal by offering to go with me to something he usually avoids, or offering <br/>
dinner at my favorite restaurant on the way.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But if he agreed to go to ONLY one place and then when you refused to go to<br/>
a second place, he proceeded to carry or drag you in, it wouldn&#39;t be very<br/>
respectful. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;If Holly wants a friend to come over, she might offer to guarantee to<br/>
play <br/>
the thing the friend likes best, even if it wouldn&#39;t be Holly&#39;s first<br/>
choice.  <br/>
It would only be manipulation if she weasled out of it after the friend got <br/>
here, I think.  If she actually DOES play Barbies or house for two hours,<br/>
that <br/>
was negotiation, not manipulation.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I agree with that.  It&#39;s all about working things out.  Give and take.<br/>
I&#39;ll do this for you, if you&#39;ll do that for me.  But it wasn&#39;t like that.<br/>
The mom agreed to only go to the hotdog place.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I have physically carried kids before, mostly out, rather than in.   With<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kids can be having a great time sometimes and not want to leave when you<br/>
really have to go.  But what drives me nuts with some people is that they<br/>
don&#39;t give the kids warning, they don&#39;t talk to the kids,  they don&#39;t<br/>
reflect their feelings back to them, letting them know they understand how<br/>
hard it is to leave when they are having fun, they often just pick them up<br/>
kicking and screaming and take them out.  Even the smallest child feels<br/>
better when you reflect their feelings back to them and tell them you<br/>
understand and maybe help them to plan ahead when they can come back again.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;So a slump, whether it lasts days with a teen or minutes with a toddler,<br/>

<br/>
True, then.<br/>
After they were in the car, there were other decision points.  <br/>
<br/>
We go to folksinging parties.  Sometimes Holly has wanted to leave before I <br/>
was ready to go, or Keith (husband) has been having less than usual fun.  I <br/>
usually let that signal me to start wrapping it up, but I dont jump up and leave <br/>
the second one of them gives me the eye.  Neither do I stay until midnight <br/>
once I know one of us has lost interest.<br/>
<br/>
With kids and playing, maybe I was coming at it from the point of view of the <br/>
other child&#39;s mom.  It&#39;s very sad when a kid is looking forward to playing <br/>
and the other kids stands her up, or says &quot;Yes, I&#39;ll come play&quot; and then comes <br/>
so late they only have half an hour or something.    And what&#39;s WAY worse (but <br/>
totally changes the subject) has been when the other kid is &quot;grounded&quot; and so <br/>
can&#39;t come and play.  WHAT!?  They violated some rule the parents just <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have had and now MY kid is punished!?   That frustration has colored my <br/>
world about the other families wimping out on keeping a playdate, maybe, and <br/>
maybe I&#39;m too tainted by disappointments and my own kids&#39; sorrow to think it&#39;s <br/>
evil for another mom to say, &quot;Let&#39;s just DO it.&quot;  Because the kids almost always <br/>
do have a lot of fun once they start playing.<br/>
<br/>
Dishonesty&#39;s no good, though, either.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t like the tone of how it was done, either.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t hear the mom saying, straight out, to the son: &quot;I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
have assumed you&#39;d want to go to the house instead of the museum. I&#39;m <br/>
really sorry. I made a mistake.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
   I also didn&#39;t hear the mom saying to the son: &quot;I feel responsible <br/>
now, for saying we&#39;d go. And I know I&#39;d be irritated if they did that <br/>
and then backed out on us, so I feel obligated to go. Is there some way <br/>
we can do that? How about if we just stop in for 20 minutes or so and <br/>
then we have a secret signal that you can give to me as soon as you <br/>
want to leave?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or whatever - but, yeah, it didn&#39;t sound from the report that the kid <br/>
was spoken to honestly.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes one sibling wants to go and another doesn&#39;t - that&#39;s always <br/>
been hard for parents. I know sometimes that happens with park days, <br/>
for example. I&#39;d hate to have them say, &quot;Well, let&#39;s go get a hot dog <br/>
and we don&#39;t have to go to park day,&quot; and then have them drive to park <br/>
day and say, &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to go sit with the other moms but you can <br/>
stay in the car if you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather they&#39;d say, &quot;Tell you what - I REALLY want to go, so what if <br/>
we get you a hot dog on the way- you can eat it in the car and I&#39;ll go <br/>
sit with the moms. If you want to stay in the car, you can have some <br/>
books and games in there. Or you can come out and sit on a blanket <br/>
beside me with some things to do. What do you think? Can we work this <br/>
out?&quot; &quot;Okay - how about we take a timer and I promise to stay only 20 <br/>
minutes?&quot; Etc. -- negotiation has to be two way.<br/>
<br/>
And with my reluctant kid, I also said, straight out, &quot;You know <br/>
sometimes you are not wanting to go, but when you get there you have a <br/>
blast. So I&#39;d like to ask you to give it 10 minutes and then I promise <br/>
we will just leave immediately if you&#39;re still not wanting to be <br/>
there.&quot; Give the kid a watch so they can be in charge of the time.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I am not so sure you can compare a 5 yo&#39;s play date at a friend&#39;s house,<br/>
which he didn&#39;t agree to go to in the first place, with a teenager&#39;s<br/>
pre-planned application and acceptance to the junior police academy, which<br/>
he then was unsure of attending after being accepted, possibly out of<br/>
nervousness. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I can, I just did! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Marty has always had that last minute hesitation, and I know he does, so even <br/>
in his teenaged guise I see it and I know it and often I drag him on through <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;ve been times I took an &quot;I don&#39;t feel like it&quot; too early in the <br/>
morning, only to have a crying kid at 4:00 saying, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you take me to <br/>
[wherever]?  I&#39;m bored.  I wanted to play.&quot;    Morning whining is often just not <br/>
awake or needs to eat, in my experience with my kids.  <br/>

Not to make light of it but one of my grandsons would have and did sit in the car for hours rather than go in someones house-very shy-not homeschooled.<br/>
My ggds- at 5  ( that we raise and Unschool now) would have sat in the car till hell froze over  and probably kicked your teeth in if you tried to carry them.<br/>
They still still would  (age 9) (but they wouldnt kick your teeth in now but you wouldnt get them physically anywhere (g)<br/>
grace<br/>
not being much help here.<br/>
But I  am getting much better  at realizing  and dealing with the fact that they really prefer to stay home these days and even if they wanted to do it yesterday they might not today.<br/>
I can almost always get myself mentally prepared with an alternate plan if they change their mind.<br/>
Beats the alternative.<br/>
