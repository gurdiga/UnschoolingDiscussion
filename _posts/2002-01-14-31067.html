<div id="ygrps-yiv-950127626">I love this idea.  I&#39;m changing my ways and instead of having this huge<br/>
library here at home with tons of bookshelves all over and boxes of<br/>
books in the garage, I&#39;ve been posting and selling at half.com and ebay<br/>
and using the public library.  I&#39;d be happy to add some books to the<br/>
unschooling lending library.<br/>
<br/>
My first idea is that I could list available books and anyone interested<br/>
could send me their address (offlist).  Then I&#39;d send that request list<br/>
along with the book to the first person who requests it.  Future<br/>
requests could be sent via email to the person who currently has the<br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe someone can think of a more clever way.  An online request list<br/>
without addresses?  Posted at yahoo?  That might be better.  I played<br/>
around a little there and made a test file.<br/>
<br/>
It costs $1.33 for the first pound, which is most books, sent via media<br/>
mail.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else interested?  Ideas?<br/>

&gt; books or<br/>
&gt; start a lending library of sorts.  Then we could read all these books<br/>
&gt; and we<br/>
&gt; all wouldn&#39;t have to go out and rob a bank!<br/>
