<div id="ygrps-yiv-526198954">I vote that it&#39;s sorbitol that gets them going.  It is known to cause<br/>
osmotic diarrhea in adults with ingestion of 30-50g (of sorbitol),<br/>
because of its incomplete absorption in the liver.  It is found in many<br/>
sugarless gum and candies.  It&#39;s classified as noncariogenic and is<br/>
metabolized by the same pathway as fructose (which is metabolized in<br/>
liver and does not require insulin to enter liver cells).  Persons with<br/>
diabetes should restrict their intake of sorbitol.  (Mayo Clinic Diet<br/>
Manual, 1988)<br/>
<br/>
Spelling and grammar: I think these tend to improve when people see<br/>
(read) and hear lots of correct examples.  My sixth grade teacher used to<br/>
&quot;punish&quot; the class by making us copy pages out of the dictionary! <br/>
Writing used to be taught by copying good writing.<br/>
<br/>
Handwriting: Mine is good if I write REALLY slow.  Otherwise, give me a<br/>
WP anyday!<br/>
