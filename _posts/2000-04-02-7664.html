<div id="ygrps-yiv-422557879">In our college degree obsessed culture, we may forget that many<br/>
great career fields don&#39;t require an entrance fee of four years of cramming<br/>
for tests and forking over $50,000 plus to pay for tuition, books, and room<br/>
and board.<br/>
<br/>
        Recently, our family visited a lovely botanical garden near our<br/>
home. We learned about some of the over 2,000 species of plants growing<br/>
there. We also learned a little about the field of horticulture.<br/>
<br/>
        Horticulture offers many great ways to earn a living. You create<br/>
beauty for people to enjoy. Most likely, you&#39;ll work outdoors. You may<br/>
escape office politics. You may enjoy the intrinsic simplicity of manual<br/>
labor; the chance to sweat, to always wear grubbies, and to get plenty of<br/>
exercise without paying for a health club membership. You may enjoy a<br/>
fascinating life-long journey of learning and discovery about plants, soil,<br/>
and the environment.<br/>
<br/>
        Our local botanical garden office had a rack of brochures including<br/>
one from the horticulture department of a community college. We learned that<br/>
a person can earn a certificate in horticulture after just nine months of<br/>
study. At the current tuition rate, that would cost right around $1600! Not<br/>
a bad price for some fourteen courses in subjects such as chemistry,<br/>
landscape design, plant identification, mathematics, and writing.<br/>
<br/>
        On the other hand, if you connect with someone already in the field<br/>
who can be your mentor, you may be able to learn the trade without attending<br/>
classes. For the disciplined self-learner with a share of passion, this<br/>
could be the ideal way into the field.<br/>
<br/>
        Along with many job opportunities, horticulture offers more than a<br/>
few entrepreneurial possibilities. I knew a woman in Indianapolis who had a<br/>
successful business which supplied offices with indoor plants. She would<br/>
deliver the plants to the offices, tend to the sick plants, and handle any<br/>
other plant needs of her customers. As a carpet cleaner, I&#39;ve had many<br/>
financially successful customers, including self-employed florists, an<br/>
arborist, a lawn care specialist, and a nursery owner.<br/>
<br/>
        Some years ago, I spent a summer working for a lawn care service. It<br/>
was tough work, but always immensely satisfying to see the finished product.<br/>
These days while driving around town on carpet cleaning business, I can&#39;t<br/>
help but notice the many groundskeepers, including specialty gardeners who<br/>
design, plant, and tend beautiful landscapes. Such businesses are solid<br/>
year-in-year-out businesses. Typically, once customers discover that you are<br/>
conscientious, hard-working, and charge a fair price, they may become your<br/>
customers for life. And they send their friends to you as well.<br/>
<br/>
        Horticulture is just one of many examples of honorable, soulful, and<br/>
financially rewarding fields of work which don&#39;t require high entrance fees.<br/>
It proves that you needn&#39;t take on debt, earn a degree, or be in a status<br/>
career in order to have an interesting occupation, and succeed financially.<br/>
