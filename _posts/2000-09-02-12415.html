<div id="ygrps-yiv-598586406">Corallyn and all,<br/>
<br/>
Please, please, please read Aletha Solter&#39;s work of &#39;Aware Parenting&#39;.  Her<br/>
web site is www.awareparenting.com.<br/>
Personally I cringe every time someone talks about how they think there is a<br/>
place for spanking.<br/>
<br/>
Following are some samples of Aletha&#39;s work. I am sorry, if this is too long<br/>
for some of you, but I feel so passionate about this. I just can&#39;t help<br/>
myself; I have to get this information out there.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t hit children! I may be overstepping some boundaries here, but I<br/>
happen to believe that all children are all adults&#39; responsibility, not just<br/>
the parents&#39;; now more so than ever, because since the decline of villages<br/>
and the extended family, couples are pretty much raising children in<br/>
isolation, even if they have some sort of &quot;village&quot; around them. I believe<br/>
one of the purposes for having a village for raising a child is to prevent<br/>
abuse, such as spanking, by giving parents the option for taking a break<br/>
when things get too intense and overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just me and my personal opinion. Take it or leave it.<br/>

TWENTY ALTERNATIVES TO PUNISHMENT<br/>
<br/>
1. LOOK FOR UNDERLYING NEEDS. ex: Give your child something to play with<br/>
while waiting in line.<br/>
<br/>
2. GIVE INFORMATION & REASONS. ex: If your child colours on the wall,<br/>
explain why we colour on paper only.<br/>
<br/>
3. LOOK FOR UNDERLYING FEELINGS. Acknowledge, accept & listen to feelings.<br/>
ex: If your child hits his baby sister, encourage him to express his anger<br/>
and jealousy in harmless ways.<br/>
<br/>
4. CHANGE THE ENVIRONMENT. This is sometimes easier than trying to change<br/>
the child. ex: If your child repeatedly takes things out of the kitchen<br/>
cupboards, put a childproof lock on them.<br/>
<br/>
5. FIND ACCEPTABLE ALTERNATIVES, and redirect your child&#39;s behaviour. ex: If<br/>
you do not want your child to build a fort in the dining room, don&#39;t just<br/>
say no. Tell her where she can build one.<br/>
<br/>
6. DEMONSTRATE HOW YOU WANT YOUR CHILD TO BEHAVE. ex. If your child pulls a<br/>
cat&#39;s tail, show her how to pet a cat. Do not rely on words alone.<br/>
<br/>
7. GIVE CHOICES RATHER THAN COMMANDS. Decision-making empowers children;<br/>
commands invite a power struggle. ex: &#39;Would you like to brush your teeth<br/>
before or after putting your pyjamas on?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
8. MAKE SMALL CONCESSIONS. ex: &quot;I&#39;ll let you skip brushing your teeth<br/>
tonight because you are so tired.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
9. PROVIDE FOR A PERIOD OF PREPARATION. ex: If you are counting on company<br/>
for dinner, tell your child how you expect him to behave. Be specific.<br/>
Role-playing can help prepare children for potentially difficult situations.<br/>
<br/>
10. LET NATURAL CONSEQUENCES OCCUR (when appropriate). Don&#39;t rescue too<br/>
much. ex: A child who does not hang up her bathing suit and towel may find<br/>
them still wet the next day.<br/>
<br/>
11. USE ACTIONS WHEN NECESSARY. If your child insists on running across<br/>
streets on your walks together, hold his hand tightly (while explaining the<br/>
dangers).<br/>
<br/>
12. GIVE &#39;I-MESSAGES&#39;. ex: &quot;I get so tired of cleaning up crumbs in the<br/>
living room.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
13. HOLD YOUR CHILD. This expression of love enables children who are acting<br/>
aggressively or obnoxiously to channel their pent-up feelings into healing<br/>
tears.<br/>
<br/>
14. REMOVE YOUR CHILD FROM THE SITUATION, AND STAY WITH HER until she is<br/>
ready to act appropriately. Use the time for listening, sharing feelings,<br/>
and moving toward conflict- resolution.<br/>
<br/>
15. BE PLAYFUL. Turn the situation into a game. ex: &#39;Let&#39;s pretend we&#39;re the<br/>
seven dwarfs while we clean up.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
16. DO IT TOGETHER. ex: If your child refuses to take a bath, offer to take<br/>
one with her.<br/>
<br/>
17. MAKE A DEAL, NEGOTIATE. ex: If you&#39;re ready to leave the playground and<br/>
your child is having fun, reach an agreement on the number of times she may<br/>
go down the slide before leaving.<br/>
<br/>
18. DEFUSE THE SITUATION WITH LAUGHTER. ex: If your child is mad at you,<br/>
invite him to express his anger in a playful pillow fight with you. Play<br/>
your part by surrendering dramatically. Laughter helps resolve anger and<br/>
feelings of powerlessness.<br/>
<br/>
19. REVISE YOUR EXPECTATIONS. Young children are naturally loud, curious,<br/>
messy, wilful, impatient, demanding, forgetful, fearful, self-centred, and<br/>
full of energy. Try to accept them as they are.<br/>
<br/>
20. TAKE A PARENTAL TIME-OUT. Leave the room, and do whatever is needed to<br/>
regain your sense of composure and good judgement (ex: cry, call a friend,<br/>
meditate, take a shower, ad a poem).<br/>

The Disadvantages of Time-Out<br/>
by<br/>
Aletha Solter, Ph.D.<br/>

and Tantrums<br/>

As concerned parents and educators have become aware of the dangers of<br/>
physical punishment, time-out has emerged as a popular disciplinary tool.<br/>
Misbehaving children are told to sit quietly on a chair or go to their rooms<br/>
to calm down and think about what they did. After a period of time, they are<br/>
allowed to come back to the group or join the family, provided that they act<br/>
&quot;appropriately.&quot; The designated period of time is usually one minute per<br/>
year of age, and children who leave the chair or room before their time is<br/>
up are told to return for the full allotment once again. Some books<br/>
recommend an added rule of silence, and suggest that the timing be repeated<br/>
if the silence is broken. In either case, parents who use this method are<br/>
promised quick and easy results.<br/>
Time-out stems from the behaviorist movement based on the work of<br/>
psychologist B.F. Skinner. His theory of operant conditioning asserts that<br/>
children will behave in certain ways if they receive rewards for doing so<br/>
(&quot;positive reinforcement&quot;), and that undesirable behavior can be diminished<br/>
by withholding the rewards or by invoking pain (both of which are termed<br/>
&quot;punishment&quot;). Skinner himself believed that all forms of punishment were<br/>
unsuitable means of controlling children&#39;s behavior [1]. Even so, while<br/>
spanking is on the wane in the United States, the withholding of love and<br/>
attention has persisted as an acceptable means of control.<br/>
Beneath the Surface<br/>
Using time-out appears less injurious than hitting, spanking, or yelling,<br/>
because it does not involve physical or verbal abuse. It is therefore<br/>
thought to represent some degree of progress in our continual striving to<br/>
make this world a better place for children. According to many educators and<br/>
psychologists, however, time-out is not as innocent as it seems and is,<br/>
moreover, an emotionally harmful way to discipline children. In fact, the<br/>
National Association for the Education of Young Children includes the use of<br/>
time-out in a list of harmful disciplinary measures, along with physical<br/>
punishment, criticizing, blaming, and shaming [2].<br/>
Beneath the surface, time-out is an authoritarian approach and, as such, can<br/>
work only among children trained to comply with the power and authority of<br/>
adults. Children trained to conform to such measures know that the<br/>
consequences of disobeying are worse than adhering to the injunctions.<br/>
Children who have not been brought up in an authoritarian environment will<br/>
most likely refuse to go to another room or sit in a chair.<br/>
How does a child learn about the consequences of disobedience? Proponents of<br/>
time-out advise parents to remove all privileges such as TV, toys, music,<br/>
and so forth until compliance has been achieved. Always there is the threat<br/>
of deprivation or further penalty. In some families there may even be an<br/>
unspoken threat of violence. Although the method seems innocent enough, it<br/>
requires a past history of punitive authoritarianism to produce children<br/>
docile enough to obey.<br/>
Proponents claim that time-out is not a form of punishment. They use terms<br/>
such as &quot;consequence,&quot; &quot;renewal time,&quot; or &quot;down time&quot; to make the approach<br/>
sound benign. The term &quot;time-out&quot; itself has pleasant connotations of a<br/>
sports team taking a well-deserved break. Regrettably, this non-threatening<br/>
terminology has deluded parents into thinking that the approach is harmless.<br/>
From a child&#39;s point of view, time-out is definitely experienced as<br/>
punishment. Who wants to be isolated from the group and totally ignored? It<br/>
is quite likely that children view this form of isolation as abandonment and<br/>
loss of love. And while parents are often careful to provide reassurances of<br/>
their love and to distinguish between the child and the unruly behavior (&quot;I<br/>
love you, but you need to go to your room for five minutes because what you<br/>
did is not acceptable&quot;), their actions speak much louder than their words.<br/>
Children under the age of seven simply do not have the capability to process<br/>
words in the same way that adults do [3]. Concrete experience and<br/>
perceptions of reality impact more strongly than language. Being isolated<br/>
and ignored is interpreted as &quot;Nobody wants to be with me right now.<br/>
Therefore I must be bad and unlovable,&quot; and no loving words, however well<br/>
intended, can override this feeling of rejection.<br/>
Nothing is more frightening for a child than the withdrawal of love. Along<br/>
with the fear come insecurity, anxiety, confusion, anger, resentment, and<br/>
low self-esteem. Time-out can also cause embarrassment and humiliation,<br/>
especially when used in the presence of other children. In the child&#39;s realm<br/>
of experience, time-out is nothing short of punitive.<br/>
Painful feelings are one consideration; the information conveyed about human<br/>
relationships is another. What message are we giving our children in<br/>
demonstrating that love and attention are commodities to be doled out or<br/>
withheld for purposes of controlling others? Is this a conflict-resolution<br/>
skill that will be useful to them? How will it influence their ability to<br/>
interact with friends, and some day with a spouse and coworkers? Wouldn&#39;t it<br/>
be better to teach children useful conflict-resolution skills right from the<br/>
start, rather than convey the message that the only way to solve conflicts<br/>
is to cut off communication?<br/>
Although the trouble with time-out is in large part invisible, one aspect is<br/>
glaringly obvious: at some point it stops working. Proponents of the<br/>
approach admit that it is effective only up until the age of about nine. Can<br/>
you imagine telling your teenager, who may be taller than you, to sit in a<br/>
chair while you ignore him? Teens who have any sense of their own self-worth<br/>
will laugh at such a command. The adolescent version of time-out is the<br/>
practice of &quot;grounding&quot; teenagers by not allowing them to go out on the<br/>
weekends or in the evenings. But this method only leads to resentment,<br/>
resistance, and sometimes even lying.<br/>
Indeed, any method based on power and authoritarianism must eventually be<br/>
abandoned, simply because parents run out of power [4]. Parents of teens<br/>
face an entirely new set of difficulties when their tried-and-true methods<br/>
of control prove utterly ineffective. Parents who adopt non-authoritarian<br/>
methods right from the start, on the other hand, are able to prevent the<br/>
power struggles, as well as the discipline problems, that so often come with<br/>
adolescence.<br/>
Hidden Consequences<br/>
The use of time-out leads to a host of hidden problems. For one, when we<br/>
enforce a time-out for children who are crying or raging, they get the<br/>
message that we do not want to be around them when they are upset. Certain<br/>
that we will not listen, they may soon stop bringing their problems to us.<br/>
Furthermore, such children may learn to suppress their feelings, especially<br/>
if we insist on time-out in silence. Have we forgotten that crying and<br/>
raging are healthy tension-release mechanisms that help relieve sadness and<br/>
frustration? [5,6,7] Have we ignored the research showing that stress<br/>
hormones are excreted through tears, thereby possibly reducing the effects<br/>
of stress and restoring the body&#39;s chemical balance? [8]. In teaching our<br/>
children to suppress their tears, we may actually be increasing their<br/>
susceptibility to a variety of emotional and physical imbalances. Swiss<br/>
psychotherapist Dr. Alice Miller states that one of the most devastating<br/>
things we do to children is deny them the freedom to express their anger and<br/>
suffering [9].<br/>
An additional problem is that the use of time-out does not address the<br/>
underlying cause of the &quot;inappropriate behavior.&quot; Children act in specific<br/>
ways for good reasons, even though the youngsters themselves may not be<br/>
aware of them. Most undesirable behavior can be explained by one of three<br/>
factors: the child is attempting to fulfill a legitimate need, the child<br/>
lacks information or is too young to understand, or the child is feeling<br/>
upset (frustrated, sad, scared, confused, jealous, or insecure) [10]. When<br/>
we try to change a behavior without addressing these feelings and needs, we<br/>
do not help our children very much at all. Why? Because the underlying<br/>
problem will still be there. Teaching children to conform to our wishes does<br/>
not resolve the deeper issues.<br/>
For example, siblings who are repeatedly separated and sent to their rooms<br/>
when they fight may eventually learn to stop fighting in front of their<br/>
parents. Their unresolved feelings of jealousy and hatred, however, may come<br/>
to expression in more devious ways, or they may carry their resentments into<br/>
adulthood. Curtailing the symptoms of a problem does not solve the problem.<br/>
Parents have been led to believe that children will use time-out to think<br/>
about what they did and regain some modicum of self-control. In reality,<br/>
when children act in inappropriate, aggressive, or obnoxious ways, they are<br/>
often harboring such strong pent-up feelings that they are unable to think<br/>
clearly about their actions. Far more helpful than isolation is an attentive<br/>
listener who can encourage the expression of honest feelings. The healthy<br/>
release provided by talking, crying, or raging may even prevent the<br/>
recurrence of unwanted behavior.<br/>
Holding children who hit or bite is much more effective than isolating them.<br/>
Firm but loving holding creates safety and warmth while protecting other<br/>
children from getting hurt. It also invites the expression of genuine<br/>
feelings (through crying and raging) while reassuring the child of the<br/>
indestructible parent-child bond. [10]. It is paradoxical, yet true:<br/>
children are most in need of loving attention when they act least deserving<br/>
of it. Telling a violent child to sit quietly rarely accomplishes anything<br/>
constructive and only further contributes to the child&#39;s pent-up anger and<br/>
feelings of alienation.<br/>
It is not necessary to isolate children and withdraw our love to teach them<br/>
how to &quot;behave&quot;. In fact, it is entirely possible to help children learn to<br/>
be cooperative and decent members of society without ever issuing<br/>
punishments, rewards, or artificial consequences of any kind. No quick and<br/>
easy method will solve every conflict. Instead, we need to treat each<br/>
situation as the unique challenge that it is, and try to be flexible and<br/>
creative, all the while giving our children the love and respect they<br/>
deserve.<br/>

PRINCIPLES OF AWARE PARENTING<br/>
by Aletha Solter, Ph.D.<br/>
<br/>
1. Aware parents fill their children&#39;s needs for physical contact (holding,<br/>
cuddling, etc.). They do not worry about &quot;spoiling&#39; their children.<br/>
<br/>
2. Aware parents accept the entire range of emotions and listen<br/>
non-judgmentally to children&#39;s expressions of feelings. They realize that<br/>
they cannot prevent all sadness, anger, or frustration, and they do not<br/>
attempt to stop children from releasing painful feelings through crying or<br/>
raging.<br/>
<br/>
3. Aware parents offer age-appropriate stimulation, and trust children to<br/>
learn at their own rate and in their own way. They do not try to hurry<br/>
children on to new stages of development.<br/>
<br/>
4. Aware parents offer encouragement for learning new skills, but do not<br/>
judge children&#39;s performance with either criticism or evaluative praise.<br/>
<br/>
5. Aware parents spend time each day giving full attention to their<br/>
children. During this special, quality time, they observe, listen, respond,<br/>
and join in their children&#39;s play (if invited to do so), but they do not<br/>
direct the children&#39;s activities.<br/>
<br/>
6. Aware parents protect children from danger, but they do not attempt to<br/>
prevent all of their children&#39;s mistakes, problems, or conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
7. Aware parents encourage children to be autonomous problem-solvers and<br/>
help only when needed. They do not solve their children&#39;s problems for them.<br/>
<br/>
8. Aware parents set reasonable boundaries and limits, gently guide children<br/>
towards acceptable behavior, and consider everyone&#39;s needs when solving<br/>
conflicts. They do not control children with bribes, rewards, threats, or<br/>
punishments of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
9. Aware parents take care of themselves and are honest about their own<br/>
needs and feelings. They do not sacrifice themselves to the point of<br/>
becoming resentful.<br/>
<br/>
10. Aware parents strive to be aware of the ways in which their own<br/>
childhood pain interferes with their ability to be good parents, and they<br/>
make conscious efforts to avoid passing on their own hurts to their<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Baby, Helping Young Children Flourish, and Tears and Tantrums (available<br/>
