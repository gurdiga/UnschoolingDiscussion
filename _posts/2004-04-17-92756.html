&lt;&lt; Better to be safe than sorry? That&#39;s not a good enough place to stop on a<br/>
discussion list!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What people take *away* from the list and *do* is up to them. People are<br/>
free to read all the arguments about not controlling our children&#39;s values,<br/>
participate in the debate, and yet still decide to control at home.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Here on this list we discuss and examine what *really* happens in real<br/>
unschooling families. *Real* data that&#39;s applicable to unschooling families<br/>
for people to ponder and turn over to make decisions for their families.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I knew when I approved the first batch of Leonor&#39;s posts that they were <br/>
inflammatory and would not in themselves help anyone to unschool.  I trusted that <br/>
the responses to her, though, WOULD shed light on some of the depth of trust <br/>
that unschoolers have for human nature in general and their own children in <br/>
particular.<br/>
<br/>
Someone dropped off the list yesterday (which has 1518 members this morning) <br/>
because she came to learn more about how to unschool, not for people to <br/>
discuss their politics.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think considerations of how to treat our children are primarily <br/>
political.  There can be an aspect of that.  Conservative Christians make similar <br/>
decisions about childrearing sometimes.   But we&#39;re not discussing the ultimate <br/>
outcome as much here as we are the affect various attitudes and behaviors <br/>
have on helping create or maintain an unschooling atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone can unschool.  Not everyone should try.  Some parents just can&#39;t <br/>
let go of enough control or fear to let life flow.  Some are too stiff, too <br/>
uncompromising, too humorlous.  Not curious.<br/>
<br/>
Those who DO want to try can be benefitted by discussions of why people have <br/>
decided and then sometimes changed their decisions, and how that went.<br/>
<br/>
Instructions on unschooling don&#39;t work very well.  (Not that we all don&#39;t <br/>
keep trying to write them. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
What works really well is making yourself an unschooler.<br/>
