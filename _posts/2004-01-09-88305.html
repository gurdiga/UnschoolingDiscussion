 </span></blockquote>What about sending one child out of the room?  In our house I do this<br/>
because someone is &quot;bothering&quot; people purposely?  For Exampe;  8yo Sydney<br/>
teases 10yo Trayton (and sometimes 3yo Anika) mercilessly. Sometimes it is<br/>
only teasing, which will abate with just a reminder but sometimes it is more<br/>
persistent and she seems willing to go to great lengths to make others<br/>
unhappy.  I have taken to telling her that I just don&#39;t want to be around<br/>
teasing (or yelling or whatever) and would she please go somewhere else.  I<br/>
have occasionally offered to go away myself but this is often quite<br/>
inconvenient to me or the offended sibling.  And she may just follow that<br/>
person to the new location.  I&#39;m not sure this is as much a choice for her<br/>
as a command.  For example, I don&#39;t say &quot;gee, Syd, would you be happier<br/>
doing that in your room?&quot;  It&#39;s more like &quot;Hey! You guys are way too loud<br/>
you may talk more nicely to your brother or you may go to your room.&quot; If I&#39;m<br/>
feeling especially patient I may help her explore other things she could be<br/>
doing but for the most part It is basically me sending her to her room. Of<br/>
course there is the council of the wise one (me) if they truly are having a<br/>
problem that they are having a hard time solving but usually it&#39;s just a<br/>
very loud pastime.<br/>

<br/>
Sent to their room as a punishment means, for example, they were <br/>
blowing bubbles in their milk and were told to stop, but did it one <br/>
more time. Mom or dad says, &quot;GO to your room and while you&#39;re there <br/>
think about being obedient and doing what I tell you the FIRST time I <br/>
say it. And no playing in there.&quot; There are people with rules about <br/>
what &quot;crimes&quot; will result in how many minutes in the kid&#39;s room. I&#39;ve <br/>
heard people suggest one minute for each year old the child is.  What <br/>
do you think the kids REALLY think about while they are in there - <br/>
waiting to be released?<br/>
<br/>
Protecting other people from a kid who is being destructive or <br/>
purposely causing a problem - a kid who is overtired and overstimulated <br/>
and being super loud and disruptive and pestering, for example - is <br/>
something we have to do. Ideally, of COURSE, we&#39;d do it sweetly and <br/>
brilliantly - figure out that a soothing bubble bath is just what the <br/>
child needs - or a bowl of hot soup or a backrub or whatever -- but in <br/>
real life there are times we just say, as you described, Krisula, &quot;Be <br/>
more quiet or go in the other room.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For a kid who is overstimulated - being too rough - being rude or mean <br/>
to the rest of the family - asking them to &quot;Go in the other room and <br/>
get yourself calmed down before you come back,&quot; is not a punishment - <br/>
it is an attempt by the parent to protect other family members and let <br/>
the child know that he/she is being rude and an opportunity for the <br/>
child to get in control of him/herself.<br/>
<br/>
I know - it isn&#39;t the pinnacle of great parental creativity either - <br/>
but it is real life - especially when you have 3 young kids and a busy <br/>
life -- there are times that telling them to go in the other room is <br/>
the best we can come up with under pressure. Its a whole lot better <br/>
than yelling, swatting, telling them that &quot;just for that you get no <br/>
dessert tonight,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll tell your father and he&#39;ll get his belt out&quot; <br/>
and so on.<br/>
