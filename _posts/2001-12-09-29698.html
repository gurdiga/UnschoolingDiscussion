&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Now, it&#39;s selling used and rare books. BK (Before Kids &lt;g&gt;) it was<br/>
&gt; dog<br/>
&gt;&gt; training.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Pam<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perfect timing . . .<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a question for you.  My sil just dumped her 7 month old dog on<br/>
&gt; us.  (Okay, we did agree.)  Anyway, she says he is part Lab and part<br/>
&gt; Husky and I suspect part Rottweiler from his coloring.  They got him<br/>
&gt; at 8 weeks or so and kept him in a cage most of the time.  Needless<br/>
&gt; to say, he is a behavioural nightmare.  He is very strong and very<br/>
&gt; exuberant.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My question, will it be possible to get him calmed down and trained?<br/>
&gt; My thought is that he is still pretty young and he is not mean just<br/>
&gt; boisterous, so he is probably not a lost cause.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>7 months is adolescence. If he isn&#39;t neutered, that&#39;s the first thing (at<br/>
home with a pair of pliers if necessary. NO, just kidding. Mostly.)<br/>
<br/>
If he isn&#39;t biting people, there&#39;s hope (sometimes there&#39;s hope if they are<br/>
biting people, but frankly I wouldn&#39;t waste time with a biting dog in a<br/>
house with kids and their friends when there are so many non-biting dogs<br/>
killed in shelters).<br/>
<br/>
My favorite training book is Good Owners, Great Dogs by Brian Kilcommons<br/>
(available through Amazon.com and elsewhere). If you can find a dog training<br/>
class near you and keep taking him through 8-week courses until people are<br/>
stopping you on the street to ask how you got your dog to behave so well,<br/>
that&#39;s good, too.<br/>
<br/>
Most of it is owner training.<br/>
<br/>
Calm is relative. You can train him to be calm on command (stay commands,<br/>
bed commands, etc.) but the rest is his personality. Young male dogs of<br/>
working breeds tend to have a lot of energy. He needs to get out and RUN<br/>
(flat out run, not just a nice walk for a few miles) for an hour or so every<br/>
day if you can manage it (fenced yard if he&#39;ll play hard chasing a ball or a<br/>
lure on a stick, or doing consecutive low hurdles for treats, or a dog park,<br/>
etc.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1881659363">How To Be Your Dogs Best Friend by the Monks of Skete is another good book.<br/>
<br/>
If he is indeed part Husky......my experience with Huskies is that they tend to<br/>
have an extended puppyhood. Look for at least a year before he settles into<br/>
maturity instead of the 6 month range of some breeds.    Lots of chewing, a<br/>
seeming lack of self control............maybe like what some might view as a<br/>
hyperactive kid.     But it DOES get better.   Mature huskies are actually<br/>
pretty laid back (towards people at least.......they ARE predators and I doubt<br/>
chickens are even sheep or goats would ever be completely safe without a<br/>
barrier).<br/>
I find Huskies to actually be very good as &quot;inside&quot; dogs once grown.   They bond<br/>
with the &quot;alpha wolf&quot;  in the household and, as I said, as adults they spend<br/>
LOTS of time just denning up  or being the equivalent of a wolfskin rug.<br/>
<br/>
They are incredibly strong as well as intelligent.  And patient if trying to<br/>
determine a way out of unwanted confinement.   Best to make them WANT to be with<br/>
you or to WANT to stay in a fenced yard.<br/>
Oh yes...........they are generally not vicious dogs and their only usefulness<br/>
as a &quot;guard dog&quot;  or &quot;watch dog&quot;  is visually!    Also, huskies don&#39;t generally<br/>
bark.   They may howl  or sing (I have one who speaks a few words in English!)<br/>
but not the woof-woof or yapping one associates with other breeds.<br/>
<br/>
Now a part Husky, particularly if Rottweiler is in the mix................I<br/>
don&#39;t know.<br/>

need for neutering now if it&#39;s going to do any good behaviorally.<br/>
