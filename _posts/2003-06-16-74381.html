&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Homeschool License Plate     4/29/2003<br/>
Orders are being taken for the first issue of newly approved homeschool <br/>
license plates in Virginia. The 2002 General Assembly approved two bills sponsored <br/>
by Del. Bob Marshall (R-13th), creating several faith and family-friendly auto <br/>
license plates. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One bill authorizes license plates bearing the phrase &quot;Education Begins at <br/>
Home.&quot; The state of Virginia requires the specialty plate sponsors to collect <br/>
350 pre-paid orders before a production run is authorized. Currently, the Home <br/>
Educators of Virginia are collecting orders for these plates. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;!--EndFragment--&gt;<br/>
