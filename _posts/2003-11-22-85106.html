<div id="ygrps-yiv-38848126">Hi Tia,<br/>
I just want you to know that you are not alone.<br/>
I have a 7 year old son who sleeps on an air mattress at the foot of <br/>
our bed in our (mine and my husbands)room.  It all started in our <br/>
old house when we had very loud banging pipes when the heat would <br/>
kick on (over 200 year old house). Anyway, he also has fears and <br/>
will not go to sleep for fear of being alone.  Thankfully we have a <br/>
small ranch house that we can see down the hall. I am usally wanting <br/>
to read a book so I will lie down and read with the light on while <br/>
my husband watches sports - (yuk). His sleep patterns also have been <br/>
crazy in the past and he is a VERY LIGHT sleeper and will wake <br/>
easily.  We have let it go because it has not caused a problem for <br/>
us because he goes to bed when I do and then wakes up later than I <br/>
do. I am into natural remidies so I srpay lavander water or rose <br/>
water and inside I put a Bach&#39;s Five Flower Remedy in it - it calms <br/>
him immediately. I lavander is suppose to be relaxing also sleepy <br/>
time tead before hand could help as well. I don&#39;t tell him that I <br/>
put something in the water I sray and he always asks for it.  I have <br/>
noticed a real difference when I spray. He alwyas asks &quot;MOM can you <br/>
spray the sleepy time spray&quot; ?<br/>
<br/>
There are other remidies you can give children for fear. They are <br/>
suppose to be used in the mouth but I put drops on his wrist and it <br/>
tickles him and he gets a kick out of it.  I tell him that they are <br/>
fairy flower medicine.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I do notice it is more common for boys to have this problem <br/>
that girls.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610283434">When Sarah was a year old, we moved from NC to FL. We spent six weeks living with my SIL in Georgia until housing was available in FL. During that time Sarah slept in a bed with me. So when we got our household goods, she no longer wanted to sleep in her crib. All we had for her to sleep on for about a year was a large queen sized air mattress. She loved it! She had all the room she needed to roll around in her sleep (she&#39;s a rough sleeper like me). It was comfortable to her. It was the only period in her life until she was 6 that she would just take herself to go to sleep when she was tired and lay down on her bed. That&#39;s not including a period when she was 3 in which she preferred to sleep on the living room couch for about 3 months.<br/>
 <br/>
Our two year old, Megan, has slept on the couch since this past summer when she was seriously ill. We have no intention of forcing her back into her bed. She&#39;s comfy where she is.<br/>
