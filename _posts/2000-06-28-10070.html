<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lucy, you make some good points here about work at home.  My question is,<br/>
where have the church supported programs gone that used to help women left<br/>
in difficult circumstances?  When a woman is left alone with children, it is<br/>
going to be especially difficult for the children to have to spend the day<br/>
away from mom.  If dad has just left, they need mom even more!<br/>
<br/>
If a mother *has* to work, then it is by far best (for the children) for<br/>
their mother to work at home.  It is not always the easiest thing, but the<br/>
needs of children come before the desires of adults.<br/>
<br/>
There is the problem of starting a home business.  It does take time, and<br/>
mom and the kids need to eat and pay bills in the meantime.  A few possible<br/>
solutions here.<br/>
Mom goes out to work part time while trying to establish a business.  If<br/>
friends care for the children during the day for no charge, then the high<br/>
cost of day care is eliminated.  Stress can be relieved for the single mom<br/>
by preparing a hot supper for her and her kids.  Maybe spend a weekend<br/>
showing her how to cook large batches of food and freeze them so inexpensive<br/>
meals are quickly available.<br/>
<br/>
If there is family nearby then perhaps mom and kids could move in while she<br/>
tries to establish a business.  Again, this is not always a wonderful<br/>
choice, but it is far easier on the children involved than being away from<br/>
mom all day.<br/>
<br/>
There are some church related organizations still around that help mothers<br/>
to get back on their feet.  Not enough, but some.  Check in to these and<br/>
find help.<br/>
<br/>
For those of us who are fortunate enough to be able to stay home, why aren&#39;t<br/>
more of us supporting these organizations?  Are we so busy that we can&#39;t<br/>
give one day a month to help hurting mothers stay with their kids??  Or is<br/>
it that too many of us think that it just isn&#39;t that important for moms to<br/>
raise their kids??  It comes down to what we value.  That which we value, we<br/>
support.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811184446">I found it pretty easy to do medical transcription because I have a <br/>
B.S. in Health Related Professions and worked for about 6 years as a <br/>
registered occupational therapist.  So, I had some anatomy and was <br/>
familiar with quite a bit of hospital jargon.  A friend from our <br/>
homeschooling support group hooked me up with my employer and <br/>
mentored me awhile in style, etc.  After a few months they cut me <br/>
loose to work on my own.  I do internal medicine, family practice, <br/>
plastic surgery and ENT notes.  I would highly recommend some kind of <br/>
training.</div>
