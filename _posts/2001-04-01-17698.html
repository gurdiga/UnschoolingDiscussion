<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268954449">My son is &quot;highly spirited&quot; multiplied by 3. :) I love<br/>
him to death, but sometimes I wonder if he actually<br/>
could just run around in circles for 3 or 4 dayz<br/>
without stopping once. He also seems to ...be more<br/>
&quot;spirited&quot;... when he gets embarrassed about<br/>
something...like if someone notices, for example, how<br/>
&quot;much energy he has!!!&quot; or if someone gets annoyed<br/>
with him for literally bouncing off the walls, he just<br/>
does it even moreso. Not to spite, but out of<br/>
embarrassment and he &quot;can&#39;t handle it&quot; (my words) and<br/>
just acts bonkers. He gets an insomniatic (my very own<br/>
word) hair from me, and I give him &quot;sleepytime&quot; tea<br/>
(Celestial Seasonings makes it) with lots of honey,<br/>
and now he loves it and actually asks for it,<br/>
especially when he&#39;s sick. Also I got one time at the<br/>
health food store here a &quot;bar&quot; (like a candy bar..or<br/>
to him anyway) that is called &quot;Pedi-Active&quot; or<br/>
something like that, and there were little<br/>
&quot;Pedi-Active&quot; chewable pills too, that we tried. They<br/>
seemed to help somewhat, but not as much as the bar.<br/>
Who knows why. Maybe the bar had more EFA&#39;s in it.<br/>
Also my most favorite thing in the whole world (aside<br/>
from Rescue Remedy, of course, which we share) is<br/>
called &quot;Humphrey&#39;s 3&quot;...and they are &quot;teething/colic&quot;<br/>
homeopathic tablets and I gave them to ds when he<br/>
first started teething and to dd when she was a very<br/>
gas-filled cranky baby and now when they have tummy<br/>
aches or are getting restless (oh, it&#39;s also for<br/>
&quot;wakefulness&quot;), and sometimes 30 minutes before bed.<br/>
ds takes 5 now (he&#39;s a very skinny almost 6yo), and dd<br/>
still takes 3, she doesn&#39;t need more. I have taken<br/>
them sometimes, for a stomach ache and I took 7...(I<br/>
weighed about 115 at the time, to give you some idea<br/>
of dosage for you dd) and they worked immediately.<br/>
The ingredients are:<br/>
chamomila coffee belladonna and sugar. <br/>
they dissolve on the tongue and taste ...like sugar.<br/>
I get them at wal-mart or any pharmacy open...you have<br/>
to ask for them at the counter. It&#39;s about 3-5 dollars<br/>
for a bottle of 135 pellets.<br/>
Hope that helps a little.<br/>
