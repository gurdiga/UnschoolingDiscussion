<div id="ygrps-yiv-141699335">Hi folks...<br/>
<br/>
I am getting on the planning for the New England Live and Learn Conference in <br/>
2004. It looks like it will probably be in August, but the exact dates and <br/>
location aren&#39;t final yet. In the meantime, I have a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
Picture your fantasy Unschooling conference. What workshops would it have? <br/>
What speakers would absolutely motivate you to come?<br/>
<br/>
If there were a few extra things your family could sign up for that had an <br/>
extra fee (like a whale watch) would you like that?<br/>
<br/>
And would you like one (again optional, again with an additional fee) <br/>
Conference dinner or lunch planned?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks....I&#39;m getting excited about this!<br/>
Kathryn<br/>

<br/>
That would be awesome!! I&#39;ll be in Oregon next August, but a whale <br/>
watch with a  bunch of unschoolers could motivate me into finding my <br/>
way there. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I think both Sandra and AnneO are wonderful keynote speakers.<br/>
 <br/>
Life is good.<br/>

different aspects of their life etc. I know Peter Kowalke does conferences. And I know <br/>
you can rent the documentary to show to an audience. Has anyone heard him <br/>
speak?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26327880">Hi Kathryn -<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;d be the speakers that would draw me as much as what fun<br/>
things were planned. We would be interested in the optional activities and<br/>
meals.  That&#39;d be a more &#39;natural&#39; environment to get to know people in,<br/>
IMO.  ~Rue<br/>

something that, even though I live in the Florida Keys, will be easy for me to <br/>
attend.   ~Kris<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I second this suggestion.  I know plenty of families just wading into <br/>
homeschooling ( and who claim they don&#39;t have time to read message boards <br/>
and lists &lt;G&gt;) who might  be inspired to take the leap all the way into <br/>
unschooling if they could hear some real stuff about &quot;success&quot; from IRL <br/>
people who&#39;ve been through it.<br/>
<br/>
Also I live in RI and would like to offer assistance to you, Kathryn, in the <br/>
planning of this conference.<br/>
email me?<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Picture your fantasy Unschooling conference. What workshops would it have?<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

&gt;Kathryn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Me, too!  It&#39;s so wonderful that you&#39;re doing this, Kathryn!  I adore this <br/>
community so much that~in my book~just having a roomful of unschoolers to <br/>
jaw with would be enticing enough for me, and I&#39;m sure that alone would be <br/>
really fun and wonderful. Anything else you can throw on top of that will <br/>
make it that much better.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for doing this!<br/>
