signatures.  That is nice that you are working as a team for your son.<br/>
<br/>
I am also not familiar with seeing the subject of an email changed to the<br/>
name of a person.  Typically, when people reply to an email, they leave the<br/>
same subject as the email they are replying to.  That makes it easier for<br/>
people to go back through the archives and search for messages on particular<br/>
topics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868048053">About the over perscribing of Ritalin. <br/>
Note before a potental flaming: I understand if some find it<br/>
necessary for Ritalin. But as I said before, I also know personally<br/>
as a teacher&#39;s daughter that it is becoming increasingly<br/>
overperscribed to children who really don&#39;t need it at all.<br/>

&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
In some schools, Dr. Sax said, mandated tests have eliminated recess<br/>
altogether. He also said standardized testing has compelled<br/>
elementary-school curriculum to speed up, forcing children in<br/>
kindergarten to put down their blocks, dress-up clothes, and<br/>
show-and-tell items in order to master reading and writing.<br/>
<br/>
Demanding attention all day<br/>
<br/>
The problem, Dr. Sax said, is 5-, 6- and 7-year-old children,<br/>
especially boys, are not at an appropriate age to sit through a day<br/>
that consists entirely of reading, writing, and arithmetic. They<br/>
find it difficult to pay attention. �I�ve seen this happen many<br/>
times,� Dr. Sax said. �Sometime around the end of first grade or the<br/>
beginning of second, the boy�s parents are summoned to the school<br/>
for a team meeting. �Johnny isn�t reading at grade level,� the<br/>
counselor tells the parents. �He doesn�t pay attention,� the teacher<br/>
adds. �He may have ADD,� the psychologist warns. �We think you<br/>
should speak with your child�s doctor about getting your son on<br/>
Ritalin.�� <br/>
<br/>
&lt;I also agree with this snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 �We�re literally knocking out our brightest and most active<br/>
children,� he said. �We are the first adults to handle the<br/>
generation gap through the wholesale drugging of our children,� <br/>
