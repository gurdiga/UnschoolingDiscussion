<div id="ygrps-yiv-840052753">My son Echo is almost 5 yo.  We came to unschooling about a yr and a half<br/>
ago and that has led us closer to TCS and radical unschooling.  I recognize<br/>
that it is a journey and dh and I have lots to learn but more than anything<br/>
I want/try to be respectful, patient and understanding.  Now for my dilemma<br/>
- Echo has a friend Aanaleese, she is 5.5 and homeschooled in a very relaxed<br/>
way, her mom and I have been friends for about a year and I consider her<br/>
very dear and I see our friendship as a very important one that I want to<br/>
nurture and grow old with - I hope that makes sense.  I have lots of<br/>
girlfriends but I see her and her family as special.<br/>
<br/>
Aanaleese and Echo play together about once per week, sometimes more.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In the past couple of mos, when she visits they play &quot;family&quot;, where Echo is<br/>
the dad, Aanaleese is the mom and my 2 yo daughter is either the gma or more<br/>
recently the daughter.  Echo and Aanaleese are very loving and nurturing to<br/>
their &quot;daughter&quot; and honestly I have teared up over some of the sweet<br/>
situations that have come up in their &quot;parenting&quot; of their &quot;daughter&quot;.  I<br/>
can go into more detail as needed.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My question is this.Echo has never expressed any type of romantic feelings<br/>
or play with any other kids so this is all very new for me.  I have noticed<br/>
lately that lately when they play &quot;family&quot; Aanaleese always likes to bring<br/>
the role playing into bedtime.where the mom and dad are going to bed.  So<br/>
this basically means 2 5 yo  going to bed in the middle of the day.  What do<br/>
they do - they lie in bed.  There has been talk of &quot;would you like to take<br/>
your wedding ring off and put it on the table with mine&quot; etc.  It&#39;s all very<br/>
innocent and sweet and I feel proud that they both have loving relationships<br/>
to model.  Dh and I are very affectionate and always have been without<br/>
feeling shameful or as if we should not kiss/hug in front of the kids.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Again, I am happy to divuldge any info to help you understand the goings on<br/>
without typing it all out now.  I&#39;m just wondering in a nut shell if this<br/>
all sounds okay and if you would be comfortable with all of this.  In my<br/>
heart I am okay with it but not sure &quot;how&quot; to handle it or if I should<br/>
&quot;handle&quot; anything in th e first place.  We have a 2 story house where the<br/>
kids have 2 bedrooms and a bath upstairs.  When my kids are home without<br/>
friends over, they choose to be downstairs with me ut when they have<br/>
Aanaleese over, they choose to be upstairs.I do pop in and visit with them,<br/>
I also invite them down to do other things with me but when Aanaleese is<br/>
over they are almost always in character it seems.  There are 3 beds<br/>
upstairs as well as a pretend kitchen, living area, dinette, dress up box<br/>
etc.so that is the &#39;family&#39;s&quot; homestead and when I try to involve myself<br/>
they obviously do not want/need me there.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
On Friday.the kids came down for a snack and while I was preparing it, I<br/>
peeked into the living room to see Echo and Aanaleese in eachother&#39;s arms.<br/>
Well ithought it was very sweet but at the same time (was it MY upbringing<br/>
that triggered these feelings?) it did make me a tad uncomfortable.  Again,<br/>
it was very innocent and loving looking.Echo says she is his best friend<br/>
ever and he loves her very much OR do I need to have a talk with my son.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess I am just a bit confused.are they too young?  My parents shamed me<br/>
for this sort of thing and I don&#39;t want to make them feel shameful - they<br/>
really do love eachother, but they are 5!!!!  Gotta go now but I look<br/>
forward to some feed back and hearing what you all would do/ have done in<br/>
this situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-369310217">Geneva, <br/>
<br/>
I say pat yourself on the back for fostering what sounds like a wonderful,<br/>
healthy, realistic friendship and roleplay between two 5 year olds.   I<br/>
understand your feelings of discomfort however, as I recall the years my<br/>
kids did the same thing with their best friends.  I think observation is<br/>
everything.  As a mom, you watch your kids, listen to them and are ready to<br/>
involve yourself in their lives as a knowledgeable parent whenever they need<br/>
you to.  When something seems confusing or amiss, you find a way to talk to<br/>
them about it - not in an admonishing way, but in a way that helps you<br/>
understand what they are thinking and what their plans are.  You can help<br/>
guide their thinking and behavior with your questions and suggestions.  Be<br/>
conscious about whether your concerns are fear-based (not good) or rational.<br/>
I also recommend talking to the other mom involved (I think you already<br/>
are?) so she knows what the kids are up to.<br/>
<br/>
One of the most meaningful experiences I&#39;ve ever had was in attending a<br/>
weekend seminar with Ashley Montague (now deceased) who is a British<br/>
anthropologist.  He&#39;s written many wonderful works and has traveled and<br/>
studied cultures worldwide extensively.  One of the things he talked about<br/>
was how important it is to the development of healthy behaviors in adults<br/>
for them as children to observe the behavior of adults and to freely mimic<br/>
behaviors through roleplaying.  He was adamant that no good behavior could<br/>
be learned from a book.<br/>
<br/>
Because this list seems to love controversy and shock quality information,<br/>
Montague was also adamant that children observe their parents having sex.<br/>
He claimed that in other cultures where parents are unafraid of their<br/>
children seeing them during sexual activity, and children are free to share<br/>
a family bed, walk into a room where parents are having sex, etc. that such<br/>
children grow up without the need to experiment with sex prematurely and<br/>
they have healthy sexual relationship(s) as adults.  This was shocking,<br/>
monstrous news for me years ago when my kids were babies/toddlers, but I<br/>
heard it at the right time.<br/>
<br/>
I think a responsible parent needs to dissect and evaluate the roots of<br/>
anger, depression, dysfunction and rethink what is necessary to grow a child<br/>
that is comfortable and thriving in her own space, free to state her<br/>
opinion, disagree and act in accordance with her own inclinations, etc.  It<br/>
can be real challenging trying to overcome all that our culture feeds us<br/>
with regard to what our kids need, what we need.  The wonderful thing about<br/>
being an unschooler is that we already have so much practice thinking for<br/>
ourselves and bucking traditional &quot;wisdom&quot;.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t you always talk with him?   Ask him about the game, just <br/>
conversationally.<br/>
You could maybe mention that in some families games like that would make the <br/>
moms nervous, but that Aanaleese seems really nice.   (Something, I don&#39;t know <br/>
what...)<br/>
<br/>
You could give him the beginning of a clue that some families don&#39;t let boys <br/>
and girls play together alone without giving him tons of details.   And you <br/>
could give him an opportunity to express any discomfort he might have, and maybe <br/>
he has none!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve already had some talks about bodily privacy, and you <br/>
could remind him of that, that sometimes parents sleep naked, but it wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
nice for him and his friend to get naked; they should keep their clothes on.    <br/>
That might be too much to say too, if you&#39;re sure they&#39;re not getting feelie <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d talk just a little and see whether the next move seems necessary.   <br/>
Conversations with kids about touchy subjects are like chess games.   If you were a <br/>
lawyer in court, you might be able to win with just a few moves.   But it&#39;s <br/>
not court, and you don&#39;t want to &quot;win.&quot;   You want your son to win.    So move <br/>
gently and give him a chance to move.   It might take years to get through <br/>
that whole conversation, but you have years.   Give him every opportunity to be a <br/>
winner.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384445089">Something to consider is your belief system about human sexuality. Do you believe children are sexual beings? If so, and a &quot;sexual&quot; experience arises with the children, how will you and your friend handle it. I suggest the moms talk to each other, discuss the possibilities and how they would want to handle it rather than bringing social issues with girl/boy play to the kids. I feel its better to be prepared than to wait for an issue to arise and possibly handle it in a way that could be later regretted (scolding, making the kids feel shamed, etc...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010206256">I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d worry, but only because I was in this predicament myself - as the child!  When I was about 6, my best friend was a little boy I had grown up with.  (Literally!  Our mothers were pregnant with us together and our birthdays are only a week apart.)  His father was transferred out of country, making us extremely unhappy, so he and I announced to our parents that we were getting married so they couldn&#39;t separate us.  We even insisted on a little &quot;wedding&quot; bowl of macaroni and cheese with a birthday candle in it!!!  &lt;grin!&gt;<br/>
