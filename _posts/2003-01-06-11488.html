&lt;&lt; The easiest way I know of getting flaxseed oil into us is using it in <br/>
 baking.  Pancakes, for instance, or brownies, cakes, cookies.  Anything, <br/>
 really.  Just make sure you adjust the liquid to get the consistency you&#39;re <br/>
 looking for. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh no, no , no!!! Heating it at all makes it lose most of it&#39;s good. Please <br/>
don&#39;t cook with it ever.<br/>
Putting it in salad dressing is ok (you don&#39;t heat it) and stirring it into <br/>
smoothies is great. But if you heat it, you are just wasting your money. <br/>
Because you could just use olive oil or some other oil just as well and save <br/>
money.<br/>
It&#39;s only doing the good you need if it&#39;s taken straight from the bottle.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
