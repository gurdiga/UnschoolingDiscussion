<div id="ygrps-yiv-1280204748">&quot;I think I could make a MOM&#39;S to do list and post it on the wall or<br/>
fridge or something. Then explain to the kids that if there is<br/>
anything they think they might want to do to help out then I would<br/>
welcome the help.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I used to have an &quot;idea&quot; list hanging up for days when we needed<br/>
inspiration. In the very back was a list of &quot;helpful<br/>
things&quot;...basically ways people could help me out (take out the<br/>
garbage etc..)<br/>
<br/>
I had a list of things I was willing to pay for too!  I think lists<br/>
are a lovely way to get help without turning it into any kind of issue.<br/>
It hangs there ignored sometimes...most of the time in our case, but<br/>
it&#39;s nice to have if the kids want some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I usually find that asking for help when I need it works best. Give<br/>
the list a try.<br/>

***For &quot;paying jobs&quot; I will put cash in an envelope.  On the <br/>
envelope I&#39;ll list exactly what I am looking for and how much cash <br/>
is in the envelope.  That way they know what exactly the job entails <br/>
and how much it pays.  And the cash is in their hand, right then and <br/>
there!<br/>
<br/>
Like &quot;Clean up the yard - 1. pick up outside toys and put in bin 2. <br/>
take trash can down to driveway 3. bring bikes into garage $5.00 &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes there&#39;s a couple envelopes hanging up (I use a metalic <br/>
clip that hangs on the fridge) and sometimes there&#39;s none.  <br/>
Sometimes they come to me asking for one :)<br/>
<br/>
If it is something that I *need* done by a certain time or <br/>
something, I still plan on doing it myself.  But if someone does it, <br/>
it really is a gift.  No issues if they don&#39;t cause I&#39;ve already <br/>
planned to do it anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-680550339">My 13 year old daughter wants a job and over the past week or two, she has been cleaning vigourously.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking about &quot;hiring&quot; her as my cleaning lady mainly because I really *could* use the help and she really *could* use the money.<br/>
