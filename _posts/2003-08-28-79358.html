a pond<br/>
a bar<br/>
tents <br/>
tunnels &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First I want to say that National Talk Like a Pirate Day is coming soon, <br/>
according to my son Kirby, and he is preparing for that.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty had a pirate birthday for his fifth or so.  It was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has gone to work so I can&#39;t get those pirate details from him.  I&#39;ll <br/>
try the internet...<br/>
<br/>
There is an online site to pick a pirate name too.  Create one, I mean.<br/>
<br/>
Be back...</div>
