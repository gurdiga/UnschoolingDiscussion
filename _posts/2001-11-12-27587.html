<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178262929">Hi everyone. <br/>
I read a book a few years back about a woman who started a mother-dtr. book<br/>
club for 12-13 year olds (I htink it was called the &quot;Mother Daughter Book<br/>
club&quot;...). <br/>
It is set up  not a book-report-type book club but as a forum designed to<br/>
allow moms and dtrs as they grow together to discuss  various life issues.<br/>
Sounds good to me and I would like to start one. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to know if anyone out there has done this or is contemplating<br/>
it or just has some great ideas. <br/>
We have about 5 hsing moms&#39; plus dtrs. lined up. I have the book &quot;100 great<br/>
books for girls to grow on to source material for a start.  <br/>
Just need some more input...<br/>
Thanks, Brooke <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827083180">Susannah Sheffer, former editor of Growing Without Schooling, has written a<br/>
couple of books about writing with children, and about adolescent girls. Go<br/>
to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://holtgws.com">http://holtgws.com</a> &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://holtgws.com/">http://holtgws.com/</a>&gt; , link to FUN books, and look<br/>
for her name  I cant remember the exact titles right now. Theres also a<br/>
publication for teenage girls called New Moon  dont know how to track that<br/>
down. Grace Llewellyns books, The Teenage Liberation Handbook and Real<br/>
Lives, might be of use, too.<br/>
<br/>
If anybodys interested in writing, as opposed to reading, I recommend<br/>
Natalie Goldbergs Writing Down the Bones. Ive heard of a book called<br/>
Questions for My Father, written by a man who compiled the questions he<br/>
wished hed asked his father before he died. Seems applicable to mothers,<br/>
too  I havent read it.<br/>
