<div id="ygrps-yiv-1097416880">Hi Nanci...<br/>
I can certainly understand your concern about ADHD and meds.  One thing I<br/>
would ask, about a child diagnosed with ADHD, is HOW was that diagnosis<br/>
determined?<br/>
<br/>
In many cases, the diagnosis is made too quickly....only by asking the<br/>
parents/caretakers questions about the childs behavior.<br/>
<br/>
When we went to have our son diagnosed, it took nearly 3 months.  Our<br/>
pediatrician first did a complete physical..including blood work and<br/>
urinalysis to rule out any PHYSICAL causes for his behavior (which included<br/>
hyperactivity and distractability nearly ALL the time in ALL situations).<br/>
<br/>
We were then referred to a counselor who exclusively works with ADHD<br/>
kids....she interviewed us and our child....went over all the<br/>
forms/questionaires filled out by us and all of Tims&#39; teachers.  Her opinion<br/>
was he was ADHD...but she wanted to do further testing to determine if there<br/>
were any audio and/or visual perception problems, along with aptitude and<br/>
achievement testing.  Unfortunately, our insurance forced us to see a<br/>
psychologist for this testing.  (It took us going through 3 of them before<br/>
we found one we liked).<br/>
<br/>
The psychologist we worked with had us and all the other adults in his life<br/>
fill out forms/questionaires again.  Then, he met with Tim and us several<br/>
times...just to get to know us.  Last, he had our boy take the TOVA test (a<br/>
two part computer test which measures the attention of our son...both audio<br/>
and visual).  Based on ALL the tests, meetings, and forms, and given the<br/>
fact we could not find a physical cause (such as epilespy or thyroid<br/>
condition), it was determined that Tim is ADHD/gifted.<br/>
<br/>
We did NOT have our school case study evaluate him for ADHD initially.<br/>
However, the district did do a full case study evaluation....the outcome was<br/>
the same.  The only difference was the recommended treatment:  the school<br/>
wanted him drugged...the rest of the professionals we worked with said NO<br/>
(we did meet with the psychologist for many role-playing and behavior<br/>
modification sessions.).<br/>
<br/>
I would not shy away from a child with ADHD because he/she is on meds.  I<br/>
would ask if the child is also in counseling....meds alone is NOT enough.<br/>
The child needs to be taught how to cope.  Our psychologist is also<br/>
ADHD....he was on meds at one time...and now only uses ritalin occasionally.<br/>
Not all ADHD&#39;ers need meds, but ALL need counseling.<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I are also considering becoming foster/adoptive parents...I feel<br/>
the experience with our son as made us able to be in a position to help<br/>
another youngster.  Good luck to you!!  Let me know if we can be of further<br/>
help!!  I would also suggest the CHADD website at www.chadd.org   ...there<br/>
is a wealth of information there regarding ADHD!!<br/>
