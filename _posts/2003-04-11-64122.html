<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t feel insulted.  If was very apparent that it was <br/>
classifying an entire group of people &quot;Christians&quot; as exhibiting behaviours <br/>
that I would certainly not want associated with me at all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that on this list you need to be especially clear what you are <br/>
talking about or who you are referring to in order to make your point clear <br/>
and get the answers you are looking for.  It does make a difference in how <br/>
others respond to you.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I&#39;m VERY glad that others have decided to not lump me in with <br/>
that group of radical &quot;christian homeschoolers&quot; that I suspect would probably <br/>
STILL raise their children the very same way they do without a church or <br/>
&quot;religion&quot; but find the church a comfortable excuse or the acceptance of <br/>
their behaviours somehow reassuring.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that Sandra would not be offended if I were to tell you all about <br/>
the two unschooling families that I am familiar with who now have children <br/>
who are 19 and 20 (and a handful of younger ones too) that can&#39;t read, can&#39;t <br/>
write, can barely be verbal in any social situation.  They know nothing about <br/>
getting along in the world.  It&#39;s very sad really.  There are lots of things <br/>
I could tell you about them, but there is no need because it wouldn&#39;t change <br/>
their circumstances for them.<br/>
<br/>
BUT if I were to say things about these unschoolers as fact, I&#39;m sure that <br/>
Sandra would feel the need to point out that they are NOT unschoolers in her <br/>
sense of the word.  You don&#39;t want others to misunderstand or think you <br/>
approve or accept things like rods with names, whipping babies to change them <br/>
and the like.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I&#39;m gonna try to explain why it is offensive to be grouped in with <br/>
these radicals.  If it didn&#39;t offend you, I&#39;m glad, it does bother me enough <br/>
to make sure no one thinks I am a part of that.<br/>

If anything, you&#39;re associating yourself more and more the more you<br/>
carry on and protest.  Nobody lumped anyone on this list in with that<br/>
group, and you&#39;re the one who keeps going on and on about how you never<br/>
heard of such a thing and at the same time how you were spanked brutally<br/>
and went to a Christian school where girls were expected to sleep with<br/>
the administrators in order to graduate.  Which is it?  You never heard<br/>
of that sort of thing?  Or you know all about it because of how you grew<br/>
up?<br/>

Do you even unschool???  I&#39;m getting a headache here.  If you unschool,<br/>
then you yourself should be offended by people who neglect their<br/>
children and call it unschooling.  If you don&#39;t unschool and you think<br/>
unschooled kids will grow up unable to read, write or even speak, why<br/>
are you here?  To argue, right?<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never knew they were an organized threat to the unschooling/homeschooling <br/>
movement.  I didn&#39;t think there were many people like that.  MOST of the <br/>
families in my church were loving caring people.  There were those that were <br/>
just sick, like mine, but I didn&#39;t for one minute think they were all like <br/>
that.  I thought they just stayed hid in their own little churches trying to <br/>
cause as little reaction as possible.<br/>
<br/>
I know what I lived and while my parents were avid church goers I believe I <br/>
would have lived the exact same life if they never darkened a church&#39;s door.  <br/>
They were control freaks, they were sick in many ways.  I don&#39;t really think <br/>
it came from church doctrine at all in my particular case.  Now the perverted <br/>
behaviours of my FIL, the church didn&#39;t advocate that either.  He did get <br/>
caught in that and put out of the church for it, it was some years after I <br/>
was completely gone from there though.<br/>
<br/>
So my ignorance was that they were organized enough to speak out and try to <br/>
have anything to do with legislation.  Most times when people are that <br/>
controlling and abusive they want no one prying in their business and knowing <br/>
what&#39;s going on.<br/>
<br/>
I also was ignorant of the church advocating whipping young children and the <br/>
things I read about in the last few days.<br/>
<br/>
I was not ignorant that abuse takes place at all.  I know very well first <br/>
hand about that.  But I wasn&#39;t abused because I was willfully disobedient or <br/>
wore make up or short dresses or didn&#39;t do chores or was disrespectful.  I <br/>
made sure I did nothing to make my father angry.  But nevertheless, I walked <br/>
too loudly across the floor, I took too long in the shower.  I didn&#39;t scrub <br/>
the baseboards just right, the dish water wasn&#39;t quite hot enough.  Not <br/>
anything to do with church doctrine or their religious beliefs at all.<br/>

were the example of &quot;unschooling&quot;.  They were the only people I had ever come <br/>
in contact with that used the term unschooling.  They are definitely not <br/>
unschoolers after I&#39;ve come to read and read and listen and learn here.<br/>
<br/>
But you are right, if they don&#39;t cause a big enough problem, then it&#39;s not <br/>
really a problem.  Other than I only found out about REAL unschooling quite <br/>
by accident  (or maybe not)  when I was reading Sandra&#39;s website as offered <br/>
by someone in a regular homeschool group.  So there are probably others who <br/>
think the same thing I did about unschooling.  Probably not enough to hurt <br/>
unschooling as a group, but maybe enough to keep someone else away from the <br/>
true joy that can come from it.<br/>
<br/>
No way to control what people call it though, you are right.<br/>

go to Sunday School and Church.  They most definitely exist.  When the mother <br/>
decided to return to work a few years ago she asked me to let the one child <br/>
stay with me during the day.  I asked about school.  She told me that the <br/>
child (then 14 and court ordered to be supervised) really needed nothing in <br/>
the way of school.  He would find a way to amuse himself all day. She went on <br/>
to tell me that if I needed something done, dishes, lawn mowed, vacuuming, <br/>
ANYTHING, I was to ask him, that&#39;s what he was used to.  It was short term, <br/>
the child asked me to help him learn to read.  She didn&#39;t like that and <br/>
explained they were &quot;unschoolers&quot; and what it meant to her.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to apologize for speaking for you to the group.  It was wrong. I <br/>
should have just said that it MIGHT offend anyone who lovingly raises their <br/>
children in an unschooling environment to have people describe this kind of <br/>
environment as unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, I am very sorry for even attempting to speak for you or anyone else in <br/>
the group.<br/>

okay if you put &quot;radical&quot; in front of it?<br/>

That does NOT work  because there are quite a few &quot;radical Christians&quot; <br/>

opinion, Christians. Then LEAVE it at that. Sheesh.<br/>

of us on this list who are Christians find those behaviors just as <br/>
appalling as you do.&quot;  If you felt it necessary to say ANYTHING, why <br/>
not just say that one thing? Why carry on and on? As it turns out, you <br/>
didn&#39;t know what you were talking about. Now you know more. That has <br/>
happened before. Maybe you should learn to ask questions, politely, <br/>
before you get all defensive and post inflammatory messages.<br/>

&gt; enough<br/>
&gt; to make sure no one thinks I am a part of that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hundreds of posts later -- I do not believe you really honestly felt <br/>
that this post was necessary to make sure nobody thinks you are part of <br/>
that. I don&#39;t believe it. I don&#39;t know why you felt it necessary to say <br/>
this again, but there is simply no way you could still honestly think <br/>
that anybody on this list is not already aware of your position.<br/>
