to be an example to other people but to be there for my children.  This same <br/>
Mom approached me to &quot;homeschool&quot; her child a year or so ago.  As much as I <br/>
would like to help other people, my boys come first.   <br/>

There are so many out there that think you are home so you couldn&#39;t possibly <br/>
doing anything important.  Wanting me to be a baby sitter, chaperone, etc.  <br/>
Have to say no.  That is not why I am at home.<br/>

approached to do emergency respite care all the time, and it&#39;s such a disruption.  I <br/>
think once our  adoption of our 2 foster boys is final, we&#39;ll bring them home <br/>
then kiss the system and the school board goodbye.<br/>
