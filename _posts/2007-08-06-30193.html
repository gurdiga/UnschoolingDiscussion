I found that page to send it to someone I&#39;m working with who&#39;s  <br/>
neither involved in unschooling nor the SCA.  The page is from an SCA  <br/>
context, but many of the ideas are from unschooling discussions.<br/>
<br/>
I think it might have ideas to help people involved in ANY kind of  <br/>
change or confusion, whether about daycare or freedom or moving past  <br/>
a mourning stage or helping boys to get along.<br/>
