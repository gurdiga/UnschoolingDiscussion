&lt;&lt; This year we are putting together a Christmas <br/>
 wish list for everyone.  At the top of the list, we are saying we would <br/>
 prefer &quot;no toys that require batteries&quot; and lots of books.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We went even further than this.  This year (2000), my extended family finally <br/>
got our heads together (after too many years of buying too many extravagant <br/>
gifts) and decided that the only gifts we would exchange (kids included) <br/>
would be those that we made ourselves or bought at a rummage sale...we&#39;re all <br/>
interested in teaching the kids the economics of recycling!  So my kids are <br/>
thinking ahead because in WI rummage sale season is only in the summer, and <br/>
they&#39;ve already made some neat purchases.  My son bought a Cubs outfit for <br/>
his little nephew (with the tags on!) at a sale yesterday for 50 cents and he <br/>
also bought his Dad a coffee mug (still in its box) for the same amount.<br/>
I&#39;m hoping this way of thinking rubs off when we&#39;re trying to adjust the <br/>
amount of &quot;junk&quot; in our own home...at least its a step in the right direction!<br/>
Have a great weekend-<br/>

What a wonderful idea... Firstly we only do presents for grown ups that are <br/>
present at Xmas where we live... So first the last couple of years it&#39;s been <br/>
mum,dad,steve,me, my brother and fiancee and we put out names in a hat and we <br/>
only buy a gift for the name of the person we get.  This has cut down the <br/>
spending drastically.  Plus we have a limit of $25 on each person.  (My new <br/>
M.C. Beaton, murder mystery books come out at Xmas and I invariably get the <br/>
newest one then from someone).  I buy things periodically through the year, <br/>
hoping to get someone that I can use the gift for.  Last year I got an $80 <br/>
value book all about the History of England in the past 100 years for $8.00 <br/>
on clearance at Barnes and Noble.  Luckily I got my mother&#39;s name at Xmas and <br/>
that was her gift.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to have my dad build a computer desk for Zak this year and my <br/>
brother can buy the small chair for it.  I don&#39;t want any gifts for Max as <br/>
he&#39;s too young and has tons of his older brother&#39;s stuff that we are going to <br/>
box back up and give him.  He won&#39;t know the difference only being 1 at that <br/>
time (LOL)<br/>
