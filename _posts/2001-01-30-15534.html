<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501584923"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Do you <br/>
&gt;  think that you have some &quot;God Given&quot; right to shove your beliefs down our <br/>
&gt;  throats, while we have no rights since we don&#39;t all prescribe to the rules <br/>
&gt;  of your god.  This seems totally unfair and hypocrital of you.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow.  I think the poor woman was saying SHE does not, and unless she emailed<br/>
you and crammed her belief down your throat, you can&#39;t call her hypocritical.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I&#39;ve been on here a couple of weeks.. I obviously don&#39;t fit in the <br/>
clique.<br/>
I&#39;ve seen a few others that don&#39;t either.  We newbies post an introduction and<br/>
are completely ignored and unwelcomed by everyone..<br/>
I thought mine didn&#39;t go thru the first time.  I re posted.  I was greeted <br/>
with<br/>
a &quot;Yes, we saw it&quot; and a belated &quot;hello&quot; from one nice person, and totally<br/>
ignored again by everyone else.<br/>
<br/>
At first, I thought this was neat.. there was actually discussions on <br/>
unschooling<br/>
going on.  Now there is religion and politics.  And before a bunch jump in <br/>
here to<br/>
say that unschooling encompasses all of these subjects.. I agree with that.<br/>
BUT, to ignore the unschooling posts because everyone is in fight mode.. <br/>
I don&#39;t have time for that.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m on digest form, to save time.  This digest was nothing but one long <br/>
argument.<br/>
I can&#39;t simply delete the &quot;hot&quot; threads, as the message titles don&#39;t reflect <br/>
what&#39;s<br/>
inside, and they come all together with the good ones.<br/>
The ol&#39; Delete button doesn&#39;t work so great under these circumstances, I have <br/>
to<br/>
scroll past all of this....<br/>
<br/>
So I think I will unsub... and that is kind of sad.  I am Christian, but I am <br/>
open minded to all beliefs IF that belief calls you to a higher ground.  I <br/>
respect anyone that has<br/>
a belief system that changes their behavior for the better.  <br/>
I just am not seeing that here, I&#39;m seeing people trying to drag each others <br/>
beliefs<br/>
thru the mud.... it&#39;s very sad and against every &quot;religion&quot; or belief system <br/>
of which I am aware.<br/>
<br/>
We have a LOT in common.  We love our kids and give up a lot to stay with them<br/>
and make them the best people they can be.  We share a controversial method <br/>
that<br/>
we KNOW works... people think we&#39;re nuts..  ;o)<br/>
I had hoped that this would be enough to sustain a group.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to preach and run.. I just needed to get it off my chest instead <br/>
of<br/>
just disappearing.<br/>
<br/>
All the best to everyone!<br/>

Please don&#39;t make such a generalization.  I&#39;m Christian and I think for myself<br/>
and I know others can think for themselves, too.<br/>
If you hit an overbearing, over zealot lot of Christians, I&#39;m sorry.<br/>
But please don&#39;t think you are describing Christian beliefs here... I hate<br/>
to think that some non- christian people are going to take your statements<br/>
as fact for ALL Christians.<br/>

<br>Laura,
<br>
<br>I believe I just said the same thing in my recent post on this subject. &nbsp;I, 
<br>too, enjoy it much more when the subject is actually on unschooling, however 
<br>part of the unschooling belief is that all subjects in life are part of the 
<br>learning process etc and we are learning all the time. 
<br>
<br>I am curious - are you from the northeast or another Metropolitan area (ie: 
<br>Los Angeles, Chicago) because I think we tend to be more accepting of all 
<br>kinds of ideas and types of people than those from more rural areas of the 
<br>country.
<br>
<br>Like I said, just curious, and we tend to be, that doesnt mean that there 
<br>arent very open minded people in rural areas so please dont attack this. 
<br>
<br>Thanks,
<br>Dawn</b></font></font></html>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715245785">I agree here. People have alot of wierd misconceptions<br/>
about Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses. I&#39;ve had anywhere from<br/>
people feeling bad for me cuz I supposedly wasn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;allowed to drink coke or wear make-up&quot; to people<br/>
thinking we get booted out of our organization if we<br/>
talk to a non-JW person, to people refusing to even<br/>
speak civil words at a library or some other<br/>
non-related public casual setting, cuz they had heard<br/>
such awful things about &quot;us&quot; being close minded people<br/>
who couldn&#39;t carry on conversations without trying to<br/>
shove our beliefs down peoples throats and &quot;convert&quot;<br/>
them. I&#39;ve known a few witnesses like that, but I&#39;ve<br/>
also known a few Baptists, Mormons, Wiccans, Victory<br/>
Love goers, etc etc etc that are that way too. <br/>
I&#39;m not. So it&#39;s insulting to me when people who are<br/>
NOT me take it for granted that they know what my<br/>
beliefs and life are all about just cuz they hear the<br/>
words Jehovah&#39;s Witness. I&#39;m sure that people on the<br/>
list who consider themselves &quot;christian&quot; or &quot;pro-life&quot;<br/>
are insulted by people thinking they are narrow minded<br/>
induviduals who are obviously misinformed. No more<br/>
than pro-choice people like to be labeled as<br/>
&quot;murderers&quot;. Let&#39;s give each other a little credit<br/>
here.<br/>
Let&#39;s not be judgmental and stereotype people becuz of<br/>
what religious beliefs they have. That&#39;s just as bad<br/>
as psers judging all of us on this list becuz of our<br/>
schooling choices. It makes me very sad to see people<br/>
having to be on the defense all the time, even when<br/>
they don&#39;t need to be. &quot;Can&#39;t we all just get along?&quot;<br/>
-Bobbie<br/>
(who really enjoys hearing everyone&#39;s different<br/>
beliefs and traditions/rituals that are in thier<br/>
homes, as in comparison, this is a relaxed setting and<br/>
non- argumentative way of sharing these things.<br/>
Speaking your mind is great. The key is to encourage<br/>
EVERYONE to share, and not only make welcome those who<br/>
will agree with you, lest they be bombarded with<br/>
criticism.)<br/>
