 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;At what age would you feel comfortable letting a child in the car<br/>
alone?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well for me it would depend on the child. I couldn&#39;t just say a certain age. <br/>
And to think about it, I never really had an opportunity where I needed to <br/>
think about it!! If my kids don&#39;t want to go, they stay home, if they want <br/>
to come, they get out of the car. Of course I do have the luxury of having a <br/>
16 year old to watch them if no one wants to go with me and my mom is also <br/>
in connected seperate living quarters. But I wouldn&#39;t leave any of my 3 <br/>
youngest in a car now without my oldest.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why wouldn&#39;t you feel comfortable leaving your kids 15 feet away?<br/>
What if the car was locked, the air conditioning or heat was on<br/>
(depending on the weather), and the children were instructed to not<br/>
unlock for anyone but you?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t leave my younger ones in a car that was running, locked or not 15 <br/>
feet away or not. I&#39;ve seen and heard way too much to do that. If someone <br/>
wanted to get into a locked car, they could do it less than 5 seconds. If <br/>
the car is running, they&#39;d be gone. Probable, no, possible, yes. If I border <br/>
on the paranoid side about this, I&#39;m okay with that. I live just a couple of <br/>
miles from where Adam Walsh was taken. I remember that very vividly and Tara <br/>
was just a little one then. I remember having to explain that to her when <br/>
she heard about it. I&#39;ll be paranoid and it works for me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Didn&#39;t John Holt advocate allowing children home alone, or out<br/>
walking to the library alone, at very young ages?<br/>
I know a lady who was reported for leaving her child in the car alone<br/>
while she made a quick run into the store.  I think the oldest was<br/>
10.  I think she was able to get rid of CYS after the first visit,<br/>
but it was still very stressful for her.<br/>
Sometimes you have to make decisions not based on what you think is<br/>
ok for your kids but based on what nosy people might or might not<br/>
report.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about the John Holt idea. And as far as making decisions based <br/>
on what other people think, I just don&#39;t do it.<br/>
