My son has the tics associated with TS.  He has eye blinking and it&#39;s<br/>
remained the same since he was younger.  He does not have the vocals, so I<br/>
can&#39;t really call it Tourette&#39;s.  A doctor noticed it when he was about 3<br/>
and sent us to a behavior therapist, but luckily after our initial meeting<br/>
she was going on a three month vacation and told us to book an appointment<br/>
when she got back.  We never did.  She had planned on all kinds of testing<br/>
and then who knows what after that.  He was on Neurontin for an unrelated<br/>
matter and his tics completely disappeared.  He didn&#39;t need the medication<br/>
for the other matter anymore, so he went off it and the tics returned.  I<br/>
wish he would stay on the Neurontin, but he is 14 and he doesn&#39;t want to<br/>
take any medications for it.  I had transient tics when I was a kid, but<br/>
they&#39;re all gone now.  Sean&#39;s haven&#39;t changed at all but they have gotten<br/>
more pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
My kids could have so many labels, I couldn&#39;t stand it.  Erica, sensory<br/>
issues and Aspbergers.  Sean, sensory issues (to the other extreme),<br/>
Tourette&#39;s tics, physically handicapped--he walks with a limp and a crutch,<br/>
asthma (which he hasn&#39;t had an attack since he became handicapped and<br/>
inactive).  Huge scare and deformed leg where they did surgery.  The poor<br/>
kid even wears glasses!  The lists can go on and on if I let it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When doing a history for Abba after her onset of PANDAS, we realized <br/>
that what we thought was an allergic post nasal drip throat clearing <br/>
was her vocal tic.  We had even gone to the dr. for allergies to <br/>
clear it up and nothing worked. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Now it seems to be *singing* at inappropriate times!  I can live with <br/>
that.<br/>

with any that.<br/>
