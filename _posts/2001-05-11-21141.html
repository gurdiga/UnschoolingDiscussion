<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133788688">O.K., here&#39;s curiosity question No. 2.  As someone who knows what it takes<br/>
to loose a medical license, and believe me nothing short of charges of<br/>
sexual abuse or attempted murder gets those things yanked, if this person&#39;s<br/>
son was not a homeschooler, what would everyone think of her expectations<br/>
for folks to support her.  And let&#39;s do the math here, how many folks do you<br/>
know that don&#39;t work that can afford several computers and still pay the<br/>
rent on a house, particularly in CA.  So unless the hubby sent the<br/>
computers, it isn&#39;t child support buying them because women on AFDC or<br/>
whatever they call it now only get the first $50 and then the amount over<br/>
the assistance amount (including food stamps).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, btw, in CA at least, if you are physically able, you don&#39;t get to stay<br/>
home full-time with the kids.  You are required to go to seminars, attend<br/>
classes and actively seek employment.  And you get two years.  When the two<br/>
years run out, you are off the aid.<br/>
<br/>
So something just doesn&#39;t ring right with this whole story.  Besides which<br/>
it is bad press for homeschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616192895">Thank you for sending the link.  Besides the boy, there is a 16 yr old<br/>
girl and an 8 yr old girl.  The boys father lives in Texas.  The boy was<br/>
not homeschooled his entire life.  It doesn&#39;t say how long the parents<br/>
were divorced.<br/>
<br/>
From the article:<br/>
&quot;Before moving to Sonora two years ago, Trevor had attended 13 different<br/>
public schools in 13 years from Austin, Texas, where his father still<br/>
lives, to Grass Valley. <br/>
   &quot;Hamilton is a divorced pediatrician who lost her license, she said,<br/>
because she ran out of the patience and finances required to fight<br/>
&quot;ridiculous, false accusations.&quot; Before the license was pulled, she tried<br/>
running a private practice that failed and then for several years she was<br/>
unable to find any work.&quot;<br/>
On the surface, it seems that a parent should be willing to do just about<br/>
anything to keep her children from being homeless.  I like to think that<br/>
I would, but who can ever say what the details of life will bring to us? <br/>
 I am just bothered by the idea that this mother should have been<br/>
working, rather than being with her kids, because she had once had a high<br/>
paying job.<br/>
And, I think the father should be ashamed of himself that his children<br/>
ended up homeless.  Maybe he should have been working two jobs and<br/>
sending the extra money to his kids!  Why should any children end up<br/>
homeless?  The circumstances were certainly not their fault.<br/>
I am reading &quot;The Price of Motherhood&quot; , by Ann Crittenden.  While I<br/>
don&#39;t agree with everything she says, she makes some excellent points<br/>
about the fact that our society does not value motherhood as a career. <br/>
We (as a society - I am not referring to any specific individual) tend to<br/>
view it more as volunteer work that women do by choice.  The chapters on<br/>
divorce and it&#39;s effects on women and children are very thought-provoking<br/>
and downright scary.<br/>
Mary Ellen<br/>
In the huge rush to build shopping malls and banks,<br/>
no one is thinking about where kids can play.<br/>
That doesn&#39;t generate tax revenue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485028598">I&#39;m sorry to be harsh, but I agree here... the loss of<br/>
a medical license takes more than &#39;ridiculous&#39; charges<br/>
by a long shot.  More importantly, although<br/>
homeschooling is a wonderful and beneficial thing, I<br/>
find it offensive that a person with her education is<br/>
asking a person like my husband to pay for her to<br/>
homeschool her kids... *he* works two full time jobs<br/>
to limp us along on a shoestring, because he doesn&#39;t<br/>
have the advantages that she had.  She has an<br/>
education that would allow her a decent job (even<br/>
without the license) with which to decently house and<br/>
clothe and feed her kids *and* allow her to homeschool<br/>
them when she was home.  Something is very hinky<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400649757">I agree.  My husband works full time and so do I.  I work in a grocery<br/>
store.  I am sympathetic to those who &quot;I&quot; feel truly need assistance. It<br/>
amazes me how many adults( I use this term loosely, since alot are teenaged<br/>
mothers and fathers) on assistance use their allotments to get cash and then<br/>
spend it on alcohol and cigarettes.  I know I am probably bias in this area.<br/>
I was a single mom and no one assisted me.  It was my decision to  raise my<br/>
child and I intended to do so.  I do sympathize with those parents with<br/>
children with special needs, special diets and high cost foods.  What amazes<br/>
me the most is the amount of grandparents that have to raise their<br/>
grandchildren because their child wasn&#39;t responsible enough to do so.<br/>
I find the homeschool story a little unsettling.  I don&#39;t want the state to<br/>
support me when I choose not to work.  They may feel the need to control<br/>
other areas of my life.<br/>
