<br/>
There are differences in religion and we should have acceptance......Same <br/>
thing with homeschooling....<br/>
In schools the have the certain groups or cliques. If you don&#39;t belong to <br/>
that certain group than you are not accepted or you mean nothing.....We talk <br/>
about how damaging that is to some of the kids.....<br/>
We don&#39;t want them feeling left out or not worthy because we don&#39;t belong to <br/>
a specific clique or group. People don&#39;t realize that they are doing the same <br/>
things to each other when it comes to religion........If you don&#39;t belong or <br/>
believe a certain way.......then you are ousted.......<br/>
I am learning to care less....It&#39;s been a hard thing to learn and accept that <br/>
this the way that it has to be.<br/>
I really appreciate Joyce & Brenda for their words and support.<br/>
I have said today..........ENOUGH!!!!!!<br/>
I have to draw the battle line......I have to start swinging back...I have <br/>
the power to win for myself and what I need to do for me. Just gotta use <br/>
it.......<br/>
