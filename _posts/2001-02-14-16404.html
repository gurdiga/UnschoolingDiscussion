<br>It&#39;s probably a more mature version of the journey you&#39;ve been on since 
<br>your 
<br>20&#39;s, though. &nbsp;That was my point. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>There are certain ways of being that are my personality and belief. &nbsp;When I

<br>Well, I am still pretty baffled by many things. &nbsp;I hope I am more mature in 
<br>my reactions to things but still not at all certain about a number of things. 
<br>&nbsp;Some people seem to reach a degree of certainty about things in general 
<br>earlier than others. &nbsp;Some never figure it all out. &nbsp;Perhaps I am a late
