<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731830248">hi everyone. my name is cindy and i&#39;m from south jersey. i have a 15 <br/>
yr old daughter and this will be our second year h/s. the first year <br/>
was kinda mixed. we tried i guess you call it school at home with <br/>
textbooks and workbooks and stuff like that and it was a complete <br/>
mess. it justs seem like we were always fighting about what was and <br/>
wasnt getting done. (suddenly i was having the old homework wars <br/>
coming back) having &quot;well meaning&quot; relatives putting in their two <br/>
cents wasnt helping either. they kept saying how my daughter was too <br/>
lazy and unreliable to homeschool. (huh?) by the beginning of summer <br/>
i was ready to throw in the towel and send her back to public school. <br/>
but then i sat and thought of the positive things she had accomplish <br/>
this year. we kept a list of all the books she read this year and <br/>
there was over 60 (and a few were actually &quot;classics&quot; LOL ) she self <br/>
taught herself webdesign and html, drawing, and cooking.  once i <br/>
started to focus more on the positive and less on the negative i <br/>
realized we did accomplish alot this year. and the biggest thing that <br/>
all the relatives seem not to focus on (cuz we know academics is so <br/>
much more &quot;important&quot; LOL ) is when i took my daughter out of school <br/>
she was so depressed and unhappy. now she&#39;s like a differnt person <br/>
she volunteers at a teen hotline center and makes reassurance calls <br/>
to elderly shutins. she has so many friends now and is so cheerful. <br/>
so i know this was a good decision and we will continue with it. <br/>
though i will admit i am a little nervouse about unschooling high <br/>
school. is anyone doing that now? and how do you manage things like <br/>
science, math, and history? sorry this was so long i just got so <br/>
excited when i found this list. thanks and any info would be great <br/>
most of the people i know who h/s use books and curriculm .  thanks <br/>
again  cindy</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cindy! My name is Michele, I&#39;m from North Jersey,<br/>
am fairly new to this list too, and am homeschooling a<br/>
13 year old daughter and we started last year too and<br/>
also started with the whole curriculum route. (Most of<br/>
my family would probably describe my daughter as<br/>
unmotivated as well.)  Since I&#39;m as new as you I only<br/>
have 2 possible suggestions: 1) I really liked the<br/>
Teenage Liberation Handbook. Don&#39;t know if my daughter<br/>
read it, but it sure helped me to relax!! (And sort of<br/>
addresses some of your concerns re: &#39;subjects&#39;.) 2) I<br/>
also read Clonlara&#39;s info about what they consider<br/>
math, science, etc. in everyday life.  It&#39;s taking me<br/>
a while to see &#39;subjects&#39; in everyday life, and<br/>
reading their info helped.  <br/>
Michele<br/>
