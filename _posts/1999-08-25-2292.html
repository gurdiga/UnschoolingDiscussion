<div id="ygrps-yiv-858534726">On the way to meet some friends for a day at the beach, my son (6yo) and I<br/>
started talking about the fact that his best friend will be going back to<br/>
school next week, and we won&#39;t be able to see him before late afternoon<br/>
anymore. My son then asked &quot;why don&#39;t more people homeschool?&quot;  It seemed<br/>
like such a simple question that I had a hard time answering it. I am<br/>
wondering if anyone has any great answers to this question that a young<br/>
child can easily grasp?<br/>

We are re-adjusting here, too,  as playmates return to school.  I have<br/>
generally answered this question fairly simply with comments like...many<br/>
families don&#39;t know how homeschooling works and so won&#39;t try it.....or,<br/>
most parentss send their children to school because they went to school when<br/>
they were children.<br/>
    It can be hard because the &#39;schooled&#39; children are often strapped with<br/>
hours of homework and don&#39;t get nearly as much free time to explore and play<br/>
what they want.  For my dd,  seeing others &quot;have&quot; to return to school<br/>
affirms her joy in being unschooled.<br/>
Susan<br/>
Who&#39;s somewhat glad for more time for dd to &quot;get bored&quot; (i.e., jumpstart her<br/>
imagination)<br/>

This is sort of what I told him. I also told him he always has the choice<br/>
of returning to school if he finds he really wants to, but he said &quot;no<br/>
way!&quot;  It will be interesting to see how our first &quot;official&quot; HS year turns<br/>
out, especially after the bus starts rolling past our house four times a<br/>
day next week. Of course, he probably won&#39;t see the bus in the morning<br/>
anyway because he can sleep late now that we are homeschooling! :-)<br/>

My dd says &quot;No Way!&quot;  Also, if the issue of going to school arises.  (She<br/>
did attend kindergarten in a school).  She says she wants to be homeschooled<br/>
all the way through.<br/>
