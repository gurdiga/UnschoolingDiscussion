<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309456494">I want to say a thanks to all the many voices on the various sister<br/>
unschooling lists and this one especially.  I have been soaking up the<br/>
words they&#39;ve been speaking for over 3 years now.  Not a long time but<br/>
enough to make a difference.  Let&#39;s just say it&#39;s been a journey I<br/>
have no wish to forget.  Rather I wish I could remember all the words<br/>
that help the most, more often and with greater clarity than I<br/>
actually do.  Sometimes I haven&#39;t felt able to breathe, at least not<br/>
freely.  But I&#39;m beginning to and beginning also to feel confident<br/>
that I can do this thing called unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Katherine</div>
