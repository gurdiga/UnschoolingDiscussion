<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460093032">Hi folks,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the volcano ideas, it was our &quot;curriculum&quot; today.  Didn&#39;t<br/>
find that the pop and salt worked well.  We had lots of fun with making<br/>
salt mountains and using vinegar and baking soda to make the volcanoes.<br/>
Fortunately I buy in bulk.  We made a whole scene on a large plastic<br/>
tray with houses (from a game).  We also looked at volcano related words<br/>
and looked up volcanoes in the encyclopedia.  Didn&#39;t have much luck with<br/>
the web sites. It was a fun morning.<br/>
