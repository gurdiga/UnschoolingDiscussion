<div id="ygrps-yiv-363225068">I have one word of advice for you: Homeopathy. Works wonders. Your son&#39;s temper is beyond his *will* at this point. You have great homeopathic resources in VA. Let me know if you need any more info.<br/>
<br/>
Yol<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Looking for some advice on moderating a child&#39;s behaviour. My<br/>
&gt; youngest has a temper (must be the red hair) and loses it quite<br/>
&gt; often. When he does he will lash our at other kids if they approach<br/>
&gt; him and adults too and call people who try and speak to him &#39;f****<br/>
&gt; bastards&#39;<br/>
&gt; At home I&#39;ve fiound the only thing that works is to ignore him until<br/>
&gt; he comes out of the temper. He can&#39;t be reasoned with, or jollied<br/>
&gt; out of it or even threatened (which I treid in the past). Punishment<br/>
&gt; and consequences mean nothing while his temper lasts.<br/>
&gt; When it has passed we&#39;ve discussed it many times and he<br/>
&gt; promises to try better in the future. None of this is a problem at<br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
&gt; While we&#39;re out this is a different matter. One friend tried to jolly<br/>
&gt; him out of a temper and he called her a name and tried to hit her.<br/>
&gt; He hit another friends dog when the dog tried to pinch his dinner.<br/>
&gt; We are finding that we&#39;re not welcome anywhere which is affecting<br/>
&gt; my other kids and me. I feel we&#39;re going to be alone, stuck in the<br/>
&gt; house like social pariahs.<br/>
&gt; My friends use time out and sending kids to their room which I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t agree with personally but in their own house I would never say<br/>
&gt; anything. While I tell him that his behaviour isn&#39;t acceptable I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; obviously not going to beat him and I feel uncomfortable dicsiplining<br/>
&gt; him in a way I would not do so at home. I really don&#39;t want to be<br/>
&gt; friendless until he matures enough to stop, like the other two did.<br/>
&gt; In some ways it is a cultural thing too, peope at home would have<br/>
&gt; ignored the behaviour or laughed it off as a stage some kids go<br/>
&gt; through.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any advice in how to deal with a stubborn 7 yo would be<br/>
&gt; apreciated. Before I have to leave Virginia ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is something he has done pretty much since he was 2 months old...<br/>
he used to reach up and twirl my hair while nursing. When anyone held him,<br/>
he would reach up and twirl the hair around their neck. When he was younger<br/>
it was always just twirling, either his or mine, usually when he wanted to<br/>
fall asleep. Since last spring though he has progressed to actually pulling<br/>
it out, had a huge bald spot (2 inches or so). We cut it really short over<br/>
the summer and that seemed to help but now he is back to pulling it out again.<br/>
He pulls at it without even thinking about it, kind of a nervous, calming habit.<br/>
We have tried lots of things, giving him alternatives, reminders etc. nothing <br/>
really seems to help much. Part of it is that he is not overly motivated to <br/>
stop. It is a way that he internalizes stress, I think, so I have been trying<br/>
to help him find other ways...progressive relaxation and such.<br/>
<br/>
He also has a slight bit of eczema on his arms that went away this summer (I think)<br/>
that is back now, so maybe a skin problem? I really don&#39;t know. But he has<br/>
been doing this for about 6 years now and it seems to be progressing and getting worse.<br/>
I just feel like something is off and he needs something but I don&#39;t know what.<br/>

<br/>
I do not know any of these people personally, so you&#39;d have to find out <br/>
more about each by calling and asking the following questions:<br/>
Does the practitioner specialize in homeopathy? Does the practitioner <br/>
use only classical homeopathy and constitutional treatment?  How long <br/>
has the practitioner actively been using homeopathy?<br/>
<br/>
Your best choice is the one that specializes in classical homeopathy and <br/>
treats constitutionally. Some NDs mix and match things and I would not <br/>
recommend them if that&#39;s the case. When they start talking about <br/>
nutrition and supplements and stuff like that, forget it. Next... A real <br/>
homeopath uses only homeopathy and does not try to sell you anything else.<br/>
<br/>
A homeopathic consultation takes about 1 to 1-and-a-half hours and is <br/>
basically like an informal interview where you express your ailments, <br/>
concerns and perceptions. The homeopath usually asks questions that <br/>
cover physical, emotional and mental aspects, as well as other features <br/>
of your personality (cravings, dreams, habits, etc.), along with your <br/>
family&#39;s and your medical history and such. From the information s/he <br/>
gathers s/he can find a remedy similar to what s/he perceives needs to <br/>
be cured. There is no judgement whatsoever, it&#39;s more like finding clues <br/>
to understand how you perceive the world as an individual. The <br/>
homeopathic interview is therapeutic in itself.<br/>
<br/>
Then s/he gives you the remedy of choice and you come to the next <br/>
follow-up about 3 to 4 weeks later.<br/>
<br/>
Many things  can happen after you take a constitutional remedy. It&#39;s a <br/>
little bit like cleaning house... things shift, past emotions can come <br/>
up, past physical symptoms come back temporarily, and anything that <br/>
hasn&#39;t been resolved properly shows up for a brief period and gets <br/>
finally resolved. Depending on the particular case and sensitivity of <br/>
the person, there are subtle to major changes at all levels.<br/>
<br/>
Homeopathy is based on the premise that your own vital force knows what <br/>
is best for you. And the remedy&#39;s goal is to gently stimulate your own <br/>
vital force so that it can restore harmony in te best possible way.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
Regards,<br/>
<br/>
Yol<br/>

&gt;Many things  can happen after you take a constitutional remedy. It&#39;s a <br/>
&gt;little bit like cleaning house... things shift, past emotions can come <br/>
&gt;up, past physical symptoms come back temporarily, and anything that <br/>
&gt;hasn&#39;t been resolved properly shows up for a brief period and gets <br/>
&gt;finally resolved. Depending on the particular case and sensitivity of <br/>
&gt;the person, there are subtle to major changes at all levels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Homeopathy is based on the premise that your own vital force knows what <br/>
&gt;is best for you. And the remedy&#39;s goal is to gently stimulate your own <br/>
&gt;vital force so that it can restore harmony in te best possible way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope this helps. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any <br/>
&gt;questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Regards,<br/>

&gt;&gt;I live in northern virginia, outside of Washington DC. Annandale to be exact. <br/>
&gt;&gt;In Fairfax county. The larger areas around me are Springfield, Fairfax, and Falls Church.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Any tips on what to look for in a homeopath and what to expect would also be greatly<br/>
&gt;&gt;appreciated.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Thanks!<br/>
