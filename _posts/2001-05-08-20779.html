<div id="ygrps-yiv-607842826">Actually, it is a generality.  It is not uncommon, though infrequent, for<br/>
breast milk to be too acid and, in fact, be deadly to the off-spring of<br/>
mammal mommies.  And, in some mammals, specifically some breeds of dogs, to<br/>
be frequent enough that litmis paper tests are done before the puppies are<br/>
allowed to nurse.<br/>
<br/>
Also, some mammals, including humans, are a sieve.  In those cases, milk<br/>
from a mammal who has had antibiotics can also be deadly as some, again<br/>
including humans, send the substance straight through the milk in quantities<br/>
that might be o.k. for the mother but can be deadly for the off-spring.<br/>

&gt; &gt;The same type of<br/>
&gt; &gt; sweeping generality, for instance, would be that all<br/>
&gt; &gt; children benefit from breast feeding in their infancy<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ummmm, sorry but I don&#39;t understand why this &quot;generality&quot; would be a<br/>
&gt; problem. I mean, we&#39;re mammals! It isn&#39;t a &quot;sweeping generality&quot; to say<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; any other mammal should be breastfed  - that&#39;s how babies of all mammals<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; food and survive.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s not so much a question of human babies &quot;benefitting&quot; by<br/>
breastfeeding -<br/>
&gt; breastfeeding is what the human body is designed for and breastmilk is the<br/>
&gt; food that the human body is supposed to have (biologically speaking).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry, just couldn&#39;t resist this particular soapbox... :-), getting off<br/>
&gt; now....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630538230">Human breastmilk is the food of choice for the overwhelming majority of<br/>
human infants.  Of course there will be the rare case where this isn&#39;t<br/>

you can&#39;t breastfeed your baby if you NEED an antibiotic or some other<br/>

of the substance on your own body and what other options might be<br/>

<br/>
Yes, substances found in the blood stream can be secreted in human milk. <br/>
There are many factors to consider.  How much of this substance will make<br/>
its way into the milk and for how long will it be secreted?  (There is a<br/>
book written by Thomas Hale that contains information about that.)  How<br/>
old is the baby and what is the baby&#39;s health status?  Is the drug<br/>

routinely prescribed directly to infants.)  Are there alternatives to the<br/>
mother taking the substance?  Is there another drug that might be a<br/>
better choice because you are breastfeeding?  Can treatment be delayed<br/>

accustomed to finding comfort at your breast and you can not do so while<br/>
taking the substance?  What will you feed your baby instead of your milk?<br/>
 What effect will that substance have on your baby?<br/>

Many people avoid antibiotics, and even many doctors will admit that they<br/>
are over prescribed.  However, there are situations in which ingesting an<br/>
antibiotic, even if some of it will get to the baby through breastmilk,<br/>
is the right choice in a particular situation.  Yes, there are nearly<br/>
always exceptions...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26412292">Also if your doctor is sensitive to you and your child there are antibiotics that are ok to nurse with. I got a breast infection while I was nursing my second youngest and I just didn&#39;t nurse on the side of the infection. I expressed the milk and discarded it until the infection was gone. My son still got breastfed, although it was more difficult to meet his need. <br/>
