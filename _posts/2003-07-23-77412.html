<div id="ygrps-yiv-445852220">All this trouble that Jeva has caused lately seems to stem from a <br/>
judgement she formed almost immedietly about this list. This post was <br/>
at another unschooling list, the same DAY she joined this one. It&#39;s <br/>
too bad not a single post was stuff like the following...seems she <br/>
had an agenda here all along:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m Jeva, 39, and I am an unschooling mother of 1 beautiful son who <br/>
was born at<br/>
home, unvacc. uncirc., who has been at home with me since birth, no <br/>
daycare<br/>
ever, attachment parented, family bedded, the whole shebang... lol! <br/>
and is now<br/>
9 years on the planet earth. <br/>
<br/>
I am glad to have found you all and you appear to be a lot friendlier <br/>
than the<br/>
last list I just checked out and left. This list appears much more <br/>
serene with<br/>
fewer egos involved.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So quit posting here. HURRAY!! You found your internet home. <br/>
