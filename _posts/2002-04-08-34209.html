<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598889767">Hello all,<br/>
All this talk of mice reminds me of a remedy that I use and have discovered <br/>
that many of my acquaintances are not aware of.  If you have ant problems, <br/>
CINNAMON is the cure.  Sprinkling it around areas they invade with drive them <br/>
away.  Trust me, it works!<br/>
