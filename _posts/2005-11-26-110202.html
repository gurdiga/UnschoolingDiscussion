<div id="ygrps-yiv-552518955">&quot;He passed by and saw Joshua crying a little, as I undertstand it <br/>
(third hand)<br/>
and said something like &quot;Stop crying, boy,&quot; and connected it with some <br/>
short<br/>
comment to the earlier accident which that same cop had been dealing <br/>
with at<br/>
the time, and assumed Josh had been driving this time too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not going to have much affect on stopping the behavior by telling <br/>
the poor kid not to cry! Sheesh. I hate boys being treated like they <br/>
shouldn&#39;t cry.<br/>
The fact that he was crying shows he was concerned about what happened <br/>
and felt badly. I know the cops see a lot of crap, but I think he was <br/>
wrong.<br/>
Yeah, Josh needs to realize how very serious his behavior is...but <br/>
things like this happned in my life, to people that were CRAZY in HS, <br/>
but were never alcoholics.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28274849">The purpose  of my last post was to point out that even young adults can be <br/>
in situations  that they know nothing about how to handle or are not able to <br/>
for a variety of  physical reasons.<br/>
 <br/>
The police are not always going to be helpful and kind and about &quot;teaching  <br/>
lessons&quot; or anything else.<br/>
 <br/>
Yes, kids that survive accidents probably know how lucky they are,  <br/>
especially with all the media attention when a young person dies tragically in a  car <br/>
accident.<br/>
 <br/>
Sure the under age boy should have known it was wrong to be riding after  <br/>
midnight in a car with an even younger driver breaking all kinds of rules and  <br/>
laws but I&#39;m sure he was scared (the crying) and maybe hurt in some way and he&#39;s <br/>
 a kid.  I think he deserves some amount of care and concern and sympathy  <br/>
just for the circumstances.  There is time to have a discussion about his  <br/>
implication in the matter.  After all the immediateness of the accident is  <br/>
attended too.<br/>
 <br/>
Just like in my son&#39;s case, had the officer sought medical treatment for my  <br/>
obviously injured son or allowed him to even get care before three hours had  <br/>
gone by, I think my sons and myself would not have such bad thoughts about  <br/>
police and their goals.<br/>
 <br/>
Mistakes are made, by teenagers, young adults and even trusted to protect  <br/>
and serve state troopers.<br/>
 <br/>
My son wasn&#39;t a known drug user or abuser and has no prior tickets or  <br/>
anything, so this officer had no reason other than my son being 21 and it being  <br/>
midnight to behave like he did.  He could have just impounded the car and  had it <br/>
gone over later but HE wanted to make the big bust if there was one to  make. <br/>
 Even the car my son drove, a 95 Park Avenue (grandma car they call  it) that <br/>
he had inherited from us wouldn&#39;t have made him think this was a big  time <br/>
drug dealer with drugs hid in the headliner of the car and elsewhere.   BUT he <br/>
HOPED.<br/>
 <br/>
Had my son died from a more serious head injury that had been long delayed  <br/>
it would have been a tragic mistake this trooper would live with forever.   <br/>
Lucky for him it didn&#39;t happen that way.<br/>
 <br/>
Lucky for my son he lived after slamming into that tree and not wearing a  <br/>
seatbelt.<br/>
 <br/>
Lucky for the nephew his heart is still soft enough to cry during a  scary, <br/>
glad we are all ok situation.<br/>

<br/>
Had there been an innocent person killed instead of that girl just rolling a <br/>
car full of her also-drunken friends down a little dirt embankment, then THAT <br/>
would have been something to cry about for life.<br/>
<br/>
My sympathy was not with Joshua, even though I like him when he&#39;s sober.   <br/>
He&#39;s too young yet to have ruined anyone else&#39;s life, and I hope SOMETHING will <br/>
inspire him to take steps now to avoid doing that.   (What I wrote just now <br/>
isn&#39;t true, though, is it?   He IS old enough to ruin other people&#39;s lives.   He <br/>
needs to stop taking that risk.)   If a cop knows who you are in the <br/>
emergency room because he dealt with you in ANOTHER accident, I think he easily has <br/>
the right to make a comment.   Joshua&#39;s dad argued to get him off the charges <br/>
the time before instead of letting him accept the consequences.   He didn&#39;t even <br/>
lose his license.<br/>

<br/>
OK, for that I would take the dad outside and give him a talking to <br/>
guaranteed to make him cry.<br/>
<br/>
(Easy for me to see in hindsight.)<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, driving has serious consequences and anyone who doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand that drunken driving has even more serious consequences need <br/>
to walk or ride the bus or stay home, IMNSHO.<br/>
