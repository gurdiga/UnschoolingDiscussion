<div id="ygrps-yiv-113598774">Another good thing about Netflix is that if you get interested in one thread <br/>
of movie-element, you can use their search function to find related movies.  <br/>
You can certainly do that with Google, but if you&#39;re inside netflix and you <br/>
search and find something, you can just click &quot;rent&quot; which adds it to your queue, <br/>
which can be re-ordered and editted easily, any time.<br/>
<br/>
For those who are keeping portfolios or other kinds of records, you could <br/>
print out a list of all the movies you&#39;ve ever rented from them, whenever you <br/>
need to (or lift it and edit it and then print it).<br/>
<br/>
The site is set up with recommendations and cross references, too.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve used it mostly lately for things my husband wants to watch.  Science <br/>
Fiction, mostly, but sometimes he and the boys agree on something and it stays <br/>
in the house a few days before going back.  Few of the things we rent from them <br/>
are available in town here.  Most of the artsy video stores are out of <br/>
business, or just have videos left, not DVDs.  That leaves the mainstream (Bloc<br/>
kbuster, Hastings, Hollywood) which tend to sell off their older things or not <br/>
replace them when they&#39;re lost.<br/>
<br/>
Disadvantages of Netflix:  You don&#39;t get the box, just an envelope with a one <br/>
or two paragraph blurb.   If a DVD is a set, you have to request them <br/>
separately.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had this service for a couple of years, and we&#39;ve received one broken, <br/>
one unplayable, two have been lost after we mailed them back (and are listed <br/>
in the missing section, they didn&#39;t charge us for them, though they might if we <br/>
seemed dishonest or habitual).  Compared to the number that were received <br/>
quickly and in perfect shape and returned, that&#39;s a very small number of <br/>
failures, considering they go through the mail in a flat envelope at pre-sort rate <br/>
(and back postage paid).<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m getting used to looking the movies up for more information instead of <br/>
relying on the DVD case, and it&#39;s really better that way.  We all have <br/>
internet.   <br/>
<br/>
They e-mail when a DVD shows back up there, and then they send another e-mail <br/>
when they have one packed and in the outgoing mail.  They estimate when they <br/>
think it will arrive, and ours come usually one day sooner, sometimes two.  <br/>
One single time, one came several days after the estimated arrival date.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a perfect system, but it&#39;s pretty good, and it&#39;s certainly less <br/>
trouble than spending a lot of time at a video store.  You can choose your movies <br/>
in the middle of the night from your own home.<br/>

Am I the only one that got scratched DVD&#39;s?<br/>
We had a few come so screwed up we never got to finish the movie. Overall it was a great service, and we plan to try it again. But it was extremely frustrating to deal with a movie you can&#39;t watch.<br/>
I did write them about it, so maybe it&#39;s better now?<br/>
Anyone else run into this problem?<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve had one unplayable.<br/>
<br/>
I think anyone with CDs or DVDs needs to buy a disk doctor, though.  It&#39;s a <br/>
resurfacing tool.  Marty is our disk doctor engineer and tech crew here.  It&#39;s <br/>
about the equivalent of having cleaning equipment for LPs and 45s.  Discwash <br/>
and a nice dust-brush.  But for DVDs and CDs, the little hand-cranked <br/>
resurfacer seems to work well.  I bought ours online from a video gaming store (because <br/>
they&#39;ll also clean playstation media), but they have them at video stores <br/>
too.  They cost some money, but they keep DVDs, CDs and games clean and working.<br/>
<br/>
There are also little bottles of the resurfacer stuff for about $6 some <br/>
places, but you have to learn the way to use it by hand (not around and around, and <br/>
I don&#39;t do it anyway, I ask teenagers to).<br/>

Yeah, I got some DVDs that skipped or wouldn&#39;t play, probably due to <br/>
scratches.  But I have the same problem with DVDs from the library and <br/>
with some DVDs from the chain video store.  I think my DVD player is <br/>
perhaps more picky than the average player.  (I&#39;ve even had some <br/>
problems with purchased DVDs.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chiming in - after much silence due to the new-ish baby - on the Netflix <br/>
thing.  We&#39;ve had some that are scratched and wont play on the cheaper DVD player <br/>
downstairs, but will play on the upstairs one.  So, it could be your DVD <br/>
player has a lower tolerance for scratches.<br/>
<br/>
Netflix has been wonderful for our family - both through the last grueling <br/>
month of my pregnancy and the early few months of Elliott&#39;s life.  We&#39;ve gone <br/>
through a whole Looney Tunes phase here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917488371">Only once did that happen to us.  I reported it online and put it in <br/>
the next day&#39;s mail and they were already sending the replacement.  I <br/>
also received one broken and it was handled the same way.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
really a hassle and it was taken care of very quickly.  I&#39;m very <br/>
pleased with this service.  :)<br/>
