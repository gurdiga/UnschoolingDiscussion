<div id="ygrps-yiv-274386820">Hi-<br/>
My 13yog and 11 and 9yob would be very interested in a<br/>
Harry Potter story sharing group.  Thanks for sharing<br/>
the role playing group.  <br/>
Let us know the details or if we can help start a<br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Carol B.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1311660702">There is a folder on the unschooling message boards where the kids are<br/>
talking about Harry Potter.  You might want to hook up with them.  It sounds<br/>
as if there might be enough kids right here to form their own HP group.<br/>
Would the children want to do this by email, message boards or in chats?<br/>
