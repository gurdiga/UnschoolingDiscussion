<div id="ygrps-yiv-1826829249">Hi!<br/>
I&#39;m new to the list and I was just skimming through the new posts.  I noticed <br/>
a response to someone who lives in Oklahoma.  I&#39;m also in OK and would love <br/>
to chat with any unschoolers here.  We&#39;re new homeschoolers (this is our <br/>
second year) and we&#39;re most definitely leaning toward unschooling, although <br/>
to tell you the truth we&#39;ve basically been unschooling from the start, I just <br/>
didn&#39;t know that I didn&#39;t have to feel guilty about it.  I&#39;m still a little <br/>
nervous, but I do think &quot;talking&quot; to others who have chosen a similiar path <br/>
will help calm my fears.  <br/>
<br/>
By the way...my kids are 12, 9, 5 and 1.  I had the first one at 23 and the <br/>
fourth one at 34.  My fourth child was injured at birth (she has a brachial <br/>
plexus injury) so I have to say that the past year has been a challenging <br/>
one.  Still, in some ways it&#39;s easier for me to be a mother now than it was <br/>
12 years ago.  Of course there are other things that were easier when I was <br/>
23, but mostly they&#39;re physical things.  Every child is different, so there&#39;s <br/>
something else to figure in.  I think the kind of mother a woman is has very <br/>
little to do with age, and lots to do with maturity, understanding, wisdom, <br/>
and experience (not necessarily with kids, although that kind is helpful, but <br/>
the experiences we&#39;ve had in life in general).  <br/>
<br/>
The baby&#39;s crying - gotta go.  Nice to &quot;meet&quot; you all.<br/>
<br/>
