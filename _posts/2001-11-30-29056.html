<div id="ygrps-yiv-1815279241">Someone recently posted about feeling that many new or seemingly <br/>
moderate ideas are attacked as not being &quot;pure&quot; unschooling. Another <br/>
responded that since this is an unschooling list, that is to be <br/>
expected. <br/>
<br/>
I say that unschooling is about freedom to do what works and to explore <br/>
new ideas. Unschooling is the opposite of adhering to any rigid <br/>
philosophy, even a supposed definition of &quot;pure&quot; unschooling. It&#39;s just <br/>
an oxymoron! Like &quot;jumbo shrimp&quot; or &quot;honest politician&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
So please don&#39;t anyone use the defense that they&#39;re just trying to <br/>
preserve the core or purity of the inherently diverse experience of <br/>
unschooling. Remember that many of us parents are unschooling ourselves <br/>
about the whole thing. Many of us have been in the system ourselves for <br/>
so long, that it takes a while to de-school, relax, and have fun. So <br/>
don&#39;t grade us on our progress please.<br/>

There are many things that will help kids learn, but that doesn&#39;t make those<br/>

that kids aren&#39;t asking for but that doesn&#39;t make that technique<br/>
unschooling.<br/>

unschooling then there isn&#39;t much point in calling this an unschooling list.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m having a  deja vu moment, since I had this same discussion here a<br/>
month ago. This is a catch 22 situation the way you have it set up.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, now that I think about it, being free should be the null<br/>
hypothesis, and things a parent would actually *do* would necessarily<br/>
interfere with that freedom... so the only decision is not to interfere,<br/>
and since I also chose not to interfere with the learning process of a<br/>
billion other children in the world, it&#39;s not really an issue.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is that I&#39;m doing what I think works best *for all<br/>
children*. I think that when parents start saying that sure,<br/>
non-interference is fine for some kids, but *mine* needs this bribery or<br/>
coercion or whatever to learn... that&#39;s a sign that they&#39;re no longer<br/>
unschooling. There are no exceptions to freedom.<br/>

&gt; Joyce <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I never meant that it was all about curricula or lack thereof. <br/>
I mean that unschooling is more like child lead learning (or adult self <br/>
led for us on ourselves) instead of any method or <br/>
dogma. If my kid chooses to do a project (that I&#39;m working on for my <br/>
own interest) with me sometimes, that is unschooling too. If she wants <br/>
to read her choice of book that is unschooling. I mean that alot of <br/>
things that she chooses <br/>
can be unschooling even (gasp) a workbook or something once in a while. <br/>
Unschooling is my not judging her progress or testing or output. I <br/>
never said that unschooling was about a parent <br/>
imposing any knowledge or using any specific technique. But you might <br/>
admit that even the act of our answering our kid&#39;s questions will <br/>
reveal our bias on the topic. I mean the kind of <br/>
hidden bias, like if we think it&#39;s important to know or not. Maybe I <br/>
cannot phrase that correctly right now. We demonstrate our values in <br/>
how we live our lives. The kids will be affected by <br/>
that no matter what we say otherwise. As long as we don&#39;t judge them, I <br/>
think that can be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The freedom I am talking about includes you. You don&#39;t have to support <br/>
any path someone takes. You are not there in their real life to know if <br/>
it works or not.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have some really different definition of &quot;pure&quot; unschooling that <br/>
you would say is carved in stone and will work for every family at <br/>
every point in their lives? Some magic path the list <br/>
should follow? I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible in the context of <br/>
what I believe unschooling to be.<br/>

even though I started out totally committed to the concept.  But there *is* <br/>
a goal out there, and it&#39;s to trust our kids to make their own educational <br/>
decisions, with our help and support.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it&#39;s fine to not be all the way there, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s <br/>
fine to enlarge the definition of unschooling to include the things we do <br/>
that aren&#39;t unschooling.  I don&#39;t beat myself up for panicking and <br/>
insisting that my son work on phonics when he was 12, but I don&#39;t call that <br/>
unschooling either.  If he had *asked* for help with his reading, and I had <br/>
worked with him on phonics for as long as *he* felt it useful, then that <br/>
would have been unschooling.<br/>
