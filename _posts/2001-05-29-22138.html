<div id="ygrps-yiv-1795821583">Dear Kim and Norma,<br/>
  I&#39;d like to meet you too!  I live in Granite City, Illinois, which is<br/>
across the river from North County.   Are you anywhere close?  I really<br/>
don&#39;t go into St. Louis much (I&#39;m a big chicken when it comes to the<br/>
traffic), but I can make exceptions.  Could I bring an unschooling friend<br/>
or two along, if we do manage to get together?    Djuana</div>
