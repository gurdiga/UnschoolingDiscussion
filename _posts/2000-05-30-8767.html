<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219804698">If you haven&#39;t tried it yet, and she eats chocolate/cocoa, you may want to<br/>
think about that.  Many people don&#39;t realize that is on doctor&#39;s lists for<br/>
severe allergic reactions.  I&#39;m allergic, however I have an anaphalactic<br/>
reaction (can&#39;t breathe, total body rash, etc).  There are other reactions<br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever the case, elimination is definately the way to go.  Especially if<br/>
the reactions are getting worse.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Figuring out what triggers allergies has been one of my biggest parenting<br/>
 </span></blockquote>challenges yet. My 4 year old&#39;s reaction to things is a rash all around her<br/>
mouth. She recieves no dairy or nuts (2 products that I know set her off)<br/>
and she still breaks out quite often. Sometimes the reaction is so delayed I<br/>
can never pinpoint the food.  -Amy</div>
