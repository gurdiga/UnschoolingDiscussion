<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129479398">Hi Shannon,<br/>
My name is Tamie and Im new here. I just wanted to say that I believe <br/>
the comet you are talking about is Haley&#39;s Comet. I like astronamy <br/>
also, but never pursued it. I used to work for a woman who lived on <br/>
the ocean, in Marblehead, Ma. It was beautiful. I used to just sit <br/>
out on the back porch and watch all the stars and shooting stars. <br/>
Also it was beautiful to watch all the boats lights. They seemed to <br/>
reflect off of eachother.<br/>
