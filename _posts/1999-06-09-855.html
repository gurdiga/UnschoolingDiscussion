<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535884236">I thought I should mention to Floridians specifically, that &quot;Butterfly<br/>
World&quot; in Coral Springs sells butterfly attracting plants, as well as many<br/>
helpful things.<br/>
I believe you can shop there even if you don&#39;t pay admission to walk around,<br/>
but call first, because I could be wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
I know a few people who are trying to start businesses in raising<br/>
butterflies to release during weddings instead of throwing rice or birdseed.<br/>
I&#39;m not quite that ambitious. :)<br/>
