This isn&#39;t the quote yet.  A couple of years ago at a conference in England, another speaker (who had pre-school children, but worked with troubled teens as a social worker) was cheerily assuring everyone that attachment parenting could prevent future problems, but he repeatedly used the term &quot;impulse control&quot; as something wonderful that attachment parenting would gift children with.  I suggested &quot;choices,&quot; but he didn&#39;t understand what I meant.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is what I meant two years ago, and earlier today:<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s as important to turn away from &quot;self control&quot; and &quot;self regulation&quot; as it is to turn away from schoolishness itself.<br/>
<br/>
When people have the opportunity and encouragement to make real decisions for real reasons, and they know why the&#39;re doing what they&#39;re doing, and they&#39;re not doing things that don&#39;t seem to have a purpose, then &quot;control&quot; and &quot;regulation&quot; don&#39;t factor in at all.<br/>
<br/>
I know it sounds crazy, and I also know a LOT of families who thought it sounded crazy and now have that same feeling about serious discussions of &quot;self control&quot; or &quot;impulse control.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805528254">I liked this the best from the page linked:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&#39;Self-regulate&#39; means &#39;eventually do what the mom wanted, spontaneously,&#39; sometimes, and other times means that the child will begin to have &#39;self control&#39; and tell himself no. A lot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 7 year old is beginning to play with the idea of choices and control in a funny way. He&#39;ll say something to me like &quot;I&#39;m not asking for another bowl of ice cream, but if I were, you&#39;d probably say no, right?&quot; He&#39;s so sincere about it, and every time I want to smile! Sometimes, the answer is, &quot;Sure, have another bowl,&quot; And other times, it&#39;s &quot;I wanted to save the last bowl for dad when he gets home. I&#39;ll pick up another half-gallon tomorrow,&quot; or &quot;Maybe ask your brother first he wants to split the last of it with you.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think if we had a relationship characterized by control, he&#39;d be one of those kids who told himself no a lot--he&#39;s really concerned with doing the right thing. But he&#39;s learning how to identify his choices AND get the information he needs to make a choice that he feels good about, not guilty or deprived or martyr-ish. <br/>
