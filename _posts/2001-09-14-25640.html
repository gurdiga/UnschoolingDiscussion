regretted, and many have said having children. I think most of it comes from <br/>
not having choices. If you have no choice (or perceived choice) but to stay <br/>
home and raise children, that&#39;s very different than choosing to do so. I love <br/>
my life...and I&#39;m glad it was a choice I had (and that I knew it was)<br/>

I stay at home, dh works &quot;outside the home&quot;.  I used to be employed and much<br/>
prefer staying home.  Dh used to stay home and much prefers working.  I do<br/>
the vast majority of housework.  Why?  Because I&#39;m the one in the vicinity<br/>
most of the time.  Dh does most of the yard work.  Why?  Because he likes<br/>
having quiet time to think.  Does dh ever do house work?  Yes, probably at<br/>
least something daily.  Do I ever do yard work.  Yes, I like mowing the<br/>
grass and do it when I have time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, you&#39;re not dense at all. And I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t see me as &quot;free help&quot; in my own house. LOL! <br/>
I mop the floor because *I* do it best. The kids and DH have tried it. There are streaks and dirt left so I just have to go and finish the job anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too. I do most of the housework. I&#39;m just home much more than DH is and there is a time factor involved. When he is home, he does help with the housework, too. No, he doesn&#39;t mop the floors! He sometimes does the dishes, cleans toilets, empties all the garbage (2 times a week), helps with laundry, picks up after himself, vacuums, etc. He also mows the lawn most of the time. I do it sometimes, not too often. I do most of the cooking, that&#39;s how it&#39;s always been, even before kids. If it were up to DH, we would be eating pre-packaged frozen food every night. Although, when I was recently sick as a dog, he made me a huge pot of vegetable soup, from scratch, just brimming with a variety of vegetables. It&#39;s just what I wanted. NOW THAT&#39;S LOVE! The kids help out here and there spontaneously. They mostly help me out by picking up after themselves. This somehow works out to a smooth flowing balance of running a household. We all do what we can to help each other, while taking on our own responsibilities.<br/>
