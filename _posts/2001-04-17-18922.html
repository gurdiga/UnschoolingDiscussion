<div id="ygrps-yiv-532157566">Farms that are up and running can be expensive.  Land in some states that<br/>
could be a farm is not.  First order of business would be what kind of farm<br/>

<br/>
Now, on to your garden.  Cats and dogs do NOT provide fertilizer for gardens<br/>
for human consumption.  Compost piles should not bother your neighbors if<br/>
they are done right, so shouldn&#39;t be a problem no matter where you are.<br/>
Compost doesn&#39;t have to have any &quot;fertilizer&quot; in it.  You need dirt and<br/>
green material.  Layers of yard clippings, vegetable &quot;stuff&quot; (peelings from<br/>
potatoes and carrots, that kind of stuff) and dirt.  Then turn occasionally.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to get the book called the Square Foot Garden.  It has lots<br/>
of helpful info on getting lots of good food out of a small space.  Another<br/>
good one is Tomatoes Love Carrots (I think that&#39;s the name).  And, of<br/>
course, one must have a good Rodale book on organic gardening &lt;g&gt;<br/>

If you don&#39;t want to &#39;do&#39; compost (and you don&#39;t have <br/>
to) you can use mulch, I have an old book by Ruth Stout <br/>
called the No-Dig Garden Book (now why did I buy <br/>
this??...  hmmm...) she used hay, about 8in at a time, <br/>
it very quickly softens down, and it works as a weed <br/>
suppressant, the worms and soil structure aren&#39;t <br/>
damamged by digging, and you can plant seeds directly <br/>
out, they&#39;re protected by the mulch.  I believe it is <br/>
(was?) known as the Stout Method...<br/>

<div><font face="Pooh">You can also buy aged manure at the farm feed stores or at 
a garden store. You might also want to consider container gardening and french 
square gardening. Any kind of land an acre and under might work...maybe an acre 
and half. I&#39;m sure you can get a nice low-cost mortgage for that if necessary 
and just plop a small trailer/tent out there in the summer as you improve the 
land and build a temporary A frame house for the winter until you decide how you 
want your permanent housing to be.</font></div>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Farms that are up and running can be expensive.  Land in some states <br/>
&gt;that<br/>
&gt;   could be a farm is not.  First order of business would be what kind of <br/>
&gt;farm<br/>
&gt;   then you could figure out where and how much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   As to socialization, farms aren&#39;t necessary out in the boonies and most,<br/>
&gt;   oops, better make that lots &lt;g&gt;, of farmers have children and children <br/>
&gt;play<br/>
&gt;   with other children regardless of where they live.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Now, on to your garden.  Cats and dogs do NOT provide fertilizer for <br/>
&gt;gardens<br/>
&gt;   for human consumption.  Compost piles should not bother your neighbors <br/>
&gt;if<br/>
&gt;   they are done right, so shouldn&#39;t be a problem no matter where you are.<br/>
&gt;   Compost doesn&#39;t have to have any &quot;fertilizer&quot; in it.  You need dirt and<br/>
&gt;   green material.  Layers of yard clippings, vegetable &quot;stuff&quot; (peelings <br/>
&gt;from<br/>
&gt;   potatoes and carrots, that kind of stuff) and dirt.  Then turn <br/>
&gt;occasionally.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   You might want to get the book called the Square Foot Garden.  It has <br/>
&gt;lots<br/>
&gt;   of helpful info on getting lots of good food out of a small space.  <br/>
&gt;Another<br/>
&gt;   good one is Tomatoes Love Carrots (I think that&#39;s the name).  And, of<br/>
&gt;   course, one must have a good Rodale book on organic gardening &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;   Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] farm questions<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; First of all, how does one go about buying a farm?  I mean, I hear<br/>
&gt;   &gt; about kids fresh out of high school go to be farmers.  Boy wouldn&#39;t I<br/>
&gt;   &gt; love to be able to afford to be a farmer.  We looked into it, but<br/>
&gt;   &gt; it&#39;s soooo expensive!  I mean buying the land.  (still, my husband&#39;s<br/>
&gt;   &gt; first problem with buying a farm - even before the money is...<br/>
&gt;   &gt; ahem ... &quot;What about socialization??&quot;)<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; Question #2:  I just did something stupid, and think I washed all the<br/>
&gt;   &gt; nutrients out of the soil I&#39;m planning to use as a garden (very small<br/>
&gt;   &gt; as we don&#39;t have much yard).  I&#39;d like to be able to plant some<br/>
&gt;   &gt; lettuce, but can&#39;t do compost (neighbors are too close) and no<br/>
&gt;   &gt; animals nearby (except dogs and cats) for cheap/free fertilizer.  Any<br/>
&gt;   &gt; ideas for something quick?<br/>
&gt;   &gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-821027816">I dug up lawn for my  front garden in just as<br/>
unconventional a way! I pushed the shovel into squares<br/>
of lawn, and the kids came behind me and yanked them<br/>
up with their hands. Then they just shook the dirt<br/>
loose and threw the sod clumps in the compost pile.<br/>
But they were slow, so I had to do some of that, too.<br/>
The neighbors must have thought we were insane,<br/>
crawling around in the dirt every afternoon for days.<br/>
I could have DUG the clumps up with the shovel, but I<br/>
have a bad back and it was easier to just get down and<br/>
use our hands. Juli<br/>

Hey, I&#39;m doing this with ours, I&#39;m doing a border, but <br/>
not planting anything in it atm cos the lawn had <br/>
basically been put down on top of the builders&#39; rubble, <br/>
ther&#39;s no top-soil to speak of.  So I&#39;m digging it up <br/>
and sticking cocoa-shell mulch down.   The worms can <br/>
feast :-)  A good way of using the turves as ready-made <br/>
compost/topsoil is to turn them over when you dig them <br/>
up.  <br/>
