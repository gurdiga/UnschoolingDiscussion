<div id="ygrps-yiv-1252482043">Hi all you pagans out there!<br/>
<br/>
Can you help me? I just found out that someone that matters to me is pagan <br/>
(Wiccan), and I don&#39;t know what to/not to do or say. That is, I don&#39;t know <br/>
what he would consider offensive, or just plain stupid. I said to one pagan <br/>
friend &quot;I guess you don&#39;t do Easter eggs&quot; and found out later how truly <br/>
stupid that probably sounded.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested, but not interested enough to read a book, so book <br/>
recommendations probably won&#39;t help. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Basically, I want the FAQ. Not that I&#39;m thinking he&#39;s a devil-worshipper, or <br/>
anything, just totally in the dark.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
<br/>
:-) Diane</div>
