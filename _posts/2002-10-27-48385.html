<div id="ygrps-yiv-235414116"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt; Just tonight I asked my 2 year old to &quot;come here&quot; and she was dawdling<br/>
 </span></blockquote>over<br/>
something much more interesting than me wiping chocolate ice cream off her<br/>
face. I repeated twice more and ended up meeting her half way. First thing I<br/>
thought of was some kids would get a spanking for that. I hugged her before<br/>
the chocolate was wiped off!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how many adults there are - I&#39;m 50 years old - who were raised <br/>
without even a threat of violence, but my sisters and I were. We were never <br/>
spanked and never shamed and not even punished almost at all. I knew when <br/>
my dad wasn&#39;t happy with me - he&#39;d be very very quiet and have a certain <br/>
look in his eyes - but he never threatened any kind of punishment at all. <br/>
The only thing I can remember is my mom walking me to my room and hugging <br/>
me and talking to me about what was going on - and trying to work it out. I <br/>
was sent off to my room a few times when I was really out of control like <br/>
screaming/yelling/throwing things at my sisters, but just to cool off and <br/>
wait for her to come talk with me, not as a punishment. There was no <br/>
blaming - just figuring out what was happening and  what to do about it. I <br/>
remember, once, my mom just totally lost her temper with my youngest sister <br/>
(who was about 5 or so) and she grabbed her by the arm and started to swing <br/>
one hand like she was going to swat her bottom. Totally freaked my sisters <br/>
and me out to see her do that. But at the last minute she didn&#39;t do it - <br/>
she avoided actually hitting her - and she hit her hand on the underside of <br/>
our couch and broke a bone in a finger. She always said that she&#39;d deserved <br/>
it, to lose her temper like that and ever think of striking a child.<br/>
<br/>
So - what happens to kids who are never spanked, shamed, punished?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all fine, happily married with great children of our own and not one <br/>
of us ever ever has spanked any of our children and none of us &quot;punish&quot; our <br/>
children either.<br/>
<br/>
My mother died this week. It was unexpected and sudden and took her from us <br/>
while she was still in the prime of life, active and happy and working and <br/>
traveling. She gave all of us so much love and support and encouragement <br/>
and more wonderful memories than anyone can possibly imagine. We all cared <br/>
more about her opinion and having her respect than anybody else&#39;s. She <br/>
didn&#39;t earn that by being controlling or punishing, she earned it by giving <br/>
us space to make our own decisions and mistakes and NEVER criticising, <br/>
always supporting our strengths and seeing only the good in us.<br/>
<br/>
This didn&#39;t come &quot;naturally&quot; to my mom. Her parents were strict and harsh <br/>
and she was orphaned at 15 and was in a strict and harsh and controlling <br/>
boarding school for a few years after that. She was only 21 when I was <br/>
born. I&#39;m sure she made mistakes along the way -- but she just didn&#39;t have <br/>
it in her to be punishing to us kids - she adored us and did everything she <br/>
could for us and stood beside us as our advocate and our supporter no <br/>
matter what we got ourselves into.<br/>
<br/>
She spent her whole life advocating for children, her own and all children, <br/>
and she was living proof that it is possible to overcome one&#39;s own <br/>
childhood conditioning and change the way generations of a family live and <br/>
will live together.<br/>

I am so sorry for you loss. What a wonderful story to share with us. It made <br/>
me smile to know that you were raised so well and even more, that your mom <br/>
overcame so much to do that. She certainly stepped outside of her upbringing <br/>
to do the very best for her children. What wonderful memories you must have <br/>
of her. Even though I don&#39;t know you or your mom, there will be a memory of <br/>
her in my mind now because of what you have shared. Thank you.<br/>
