stay home from school and get into video games and different kinds of <br/>
computer things.  Right now he&#39;s in a state job that he hates but <br/>
gives him good pay and security, and at least he&#39;ll get to retire <br/>
early. (I think when he&#39;s 50). But he often wonders how different his <br/>

games.  <br/>

It was no excuse, but total honesty on my part. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You said you always put fw: on your mail to the list.<br/>
That isn&#39;t true.  The only two which had fw: were the two you answered when <br/>
this discussion started, both of the subject lines of which I quoted in the <br/>
post in which I mentioned their having been forwarded.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t think in this instance, I deserved this type of response from you.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry the criticism and meanness made me angry.<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t just let other people defend me, but what happened was <br/>
other people being attacked for defending me, and that is what sparked my <br/>
anger.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I deserved the response I got from you when you rushed in to <br/>
defend Teresa from something maybe she just really needed to think about.   <br/>
Helping people NOT think is never in my top hundred things to do, so I was <br/>
frustrated that you  seemed to be doing that.  I know I didn&#39;t deserve the <br/>
response from the &quot;I&#39;m-new-here / I&#39;ve been here before&quot; drive-by poster.   <br/>
<br/>
Accusing people of being followers isn&#39;t about unschooling.<br/>
Talking about how people write here isn&#39;t about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I want to read about unschooling and I want to share my family&#39;s unschooling <br/>
experiences with other people.   I appreciate any help with that and I don&#39;t <br/>
appreciate attacks and disruption of the list.<br/>

did not understand where you were comming from when<br/>
you wrote about modeling behaviors. To me Teresa&#39;s <br/>
original post caught me eye as it was very honest. The information<br/>
back that she was getting was fantatic, I could not understand<br/>
your reasoning for your response, genitic was ok, but the modeling<br/>
just didn&#39;t fit. And if it was modeling behavior for instance after me<br/>
or my husband, I don&#39;t think I would have even wanted to share it with the <br/>
group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467048882">&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;  Is it fine to let <br/>
him explore his interest in animals and animals only?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  exploring an interest in animals isn&#39;t going to be &quot;animals only<br/>
Wow, we never really looked at it like that. That is all he is learning about <br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; But in one paragraph you say he always kept on task and in the next that <br/>
he <br/>
doesn&#39;t like sit-down busywork.   <br/>
Yes always on task in school. When we first took him out we tried the sit <br/>
down work just like school and he was very bored.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Instead of looking at what he&#39;s doing in schoolish terms, try just <br/>
seeing what he&#39;s learning and what makes him happy.<br/>
Actually looking at it this way we can see that he is learning a lot and is <br/>
very happy with what he is doing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We do have him on-line talking to some other children that do <br/>
not go to school and that seems to be helping..slowly.<br/>
YOU have him online?  Or he&#39;s online of his own choice?  <br/>
He is online because we told him he had to. 2 therapist that we have been to <br/>
said a lot of his problem is that he is home and that he is not facing his <br/>
fear of children that he should be in the public school instead of us <br/>
teaching him to run away. They then continued to tell us that if we were to <br/>
homeschool him and there was no choice but to get him penpals, online <br/>
buddies, etc., for his own mental well being. How are we supposed to know? We <br/>
are trying to do what is best for our son and like I said before we have a <br/>
lot to learn.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; We need to hear from unschoolers such as you, how a day of unschooling is<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Read what&#39;s been written already at www.unschooling.com<br/>
and if you finish the good parts of that (meaning the parts you like)<br/>
you might look at sandradodd.com, where lots of articles and families&#39; <br/>
websites are collected and linked.<br/>
Thank-you! I&#39;m sure we will FINISH all the parts and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll find that <br/>
we like them all!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kim, you sound to me like a compassionate, loving, protective mom.  After <br/>
the experience he had in school, I&#39;d say that any fear he has of other <br/>
children is a reasonable response to a bad situation.  We are all made of <br/>
different stuff.  Some folks might want to rush back into a situation like <br/>
that with their chests all puffed up; others would not (I&#39;m one of the <br/>
&#39;others&#39;).  Your honoring Who He Is by allowing him to approach this <br/>
situation in the way that works best for him is not the &quot;problem,&quot; as those <br/>
two therapists told you.  I think it&#39;s part of the solution.  Another thing <br/>
that I think would be part of the solution is for him to be able to talk to <br/>
you ~ in his own time ~ about what he&#39;s feeling and thinking and how he <br/>
views the world.  You are his safe harbor.  You can be his nonjudgmental <br/>
sounding board who listens compassionately and only gives advice when asked.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They then continued to tell us that if we were to homeschool him and there <br/>
&gt;was no choice but to get him penpals, online<br/>
&gt;buddies, etc., for his own mental well being. How are we supposed to know? <br/>

&gt;have a lot to learn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;No choice&quot; as THEY see it from their limited perspectives.  Their <br/>
prescriptions for his &quot;mental well being&quot; may be helpful and may not (i.e., <br/>
what if one of the online penpals turns out to be not such a nice <br/>
person?).  I hear that you are trying to do what is best for your son, but <br/>
I think you can give yourself a lot more credit; we all have a lot to learn <br/>
(that&#39;s what we&#39;re doing on this Earth, I believe).  You have the gift of <br/>
your instincts and your obvious love for your son.  I think that following <br/>
your instincts, listening to your heart, and relying on the knowledge that <br/>
no one knows your son better than you do will help you help him more than <br/>
anything or anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
If your son is enjoying his time online, great.  If not, how would you feel <br/>
about letting him let it go?  How would you feel about letting him choose <br/>
when and on what terms to welcome other children back into his life?<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Mary (I think :-):  Your son is a lucky boy who&#39;s learning <br/>
compassion from compassionate people (you!).<br/>
<br/>
All the best to you!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To put this in perspective, very few therapists have any clue what children<br/>
are naturally like. They only know what *schooled* kids are like. They know<br/>
the &quot;normal&quot; way that kids adapt to being forced to spend 6 or more house a<br/>
day in an artificial environment.<br/>
<br/>
When school is taken out of the mix, then therapists are lost without<br/>
realizing it. The personalities and reactions of homeschooled kids are<br/>
different than schooled kids. Without having to compensate for forced<br/>
socialization and forced learning, kids behave differently. And some of<br/>
those different behaviors would be irrational and unworkable in school.<br/>
(Like an 8 yo who still clings to her mother in social situations.) So<br/>
therapists are going to assume that the child has problems when the only<br/>
&quot;problem&quot; the child has is not having to adjust themselves to the unnatural<br/>
environment of school.<br/>
<br/>
Society thinks it&#39;s normal for 4, 5 and 6 yos to be out navigating the world<br/>
on their own for 6+ hours a day. But when it&#39;s expressed like that, why<br/>
*would* it be normal? Why would a 4-6 yo need to be away from his or her<br/>
family? Kids adapt. But kids adapt to being homeless too. Just because kids<br/>
can find a way to cope, doesnt mean that something is good for them.<br/>
<br/>
There are two problems mixed together. There&#39;s the damage that school did to<br/>
your son. And there may be personality factors. First I&#39;d deal with the<br/>
damage done by school. I&#39;d help him feel safe at home. (And if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
enjoy online relationships and your making him, then he isn&#39;t going to feel<br/>
safe. Home won&#39;t feel like a haven for who he is. It&#39;s going to feel like<br/>
another place where he needs to be something he&#39;s not in order to be<br/>
accepted.)<br/>
<br/>
Later I&#39;d help him find a comfort level of being with other kids. It could<br/>
be he&#39;s an introvert and really doesn&#39;t need other people much. Being an<br/>
introvert I can asure you enjoying being alone is perfectly normal! It could<br/>
be he much prefers one on one with another child who shares his interests.<br/>
That could be more difficutl to find but it may be what he needs and well<br/>
worth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How are we supposed to know? We<br/>
&gt; are trying to do what is best for our son and like I said before we have a<br/>
&gt; lot to learn.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s not an easy question to answer. We&#39;re kind of trained to accept what<br/>
experts tell us. We&#39;ve learned to accept that &quot;truth&quot; may not make much<br/>
sense and just trust experts that know a lot more than we do.<br/>
<br/>
So perhaps look at who your son is right now and help him be who *he* wants<br/>
to be. Give him opportunities to stretch and grow, but make the focus not on<br/>
what you want for him, but on what he wants for himself.<br/>

<br/>
In addition, I would work on having him form one new, good, relationship at<br/>
a time.  <br/>
What you may want to do is contact a local homeschooling group, explain the<br/>
situation, and ask the leader of the group if she can talk to parents of<br/>
children your sons age (11-16) and help arrange to meet just one or two<br/>
children at a time.  <br/>
<br/>
Homeschooled kids are much more open to other people, and other people&#39;s<br/>
needs, and they are more apt to be receptive and understanding of his<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas may be a small extra-curricular class or activity  that isn&#39;t a<br/>
competitive group activity...e.g. Art class, music class, chess club ,<br/>
palentology club, zoo club or similar clubs where they aren&#39;t rough and<br/>
tumble (if he is suffering from post-traumatic shock, then even an innocent<br/>
game of rough housing could upset him.) and anything group is cooperative by<br/>
nature.  <br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestion from this neck of the woods...<br/>
<br/>
Hugs to you and your son...<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>
