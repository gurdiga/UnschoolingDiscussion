I made a first  edition of the new podcast!  It was pretty easy once I got to <br/>
the  recording part of it. <br/>
Please have a listen,  and send feedback or suggestions for next time to <br/>
_unbridledlearning@..._ (mailto:unbridledlearning@...)    Also, if you <br/>
think it is worthwhile, please feel free to let others know (I am  only on so <br/>
many lists ;)  <br/>
You can get to the  show from my site listed in my signature, or go directly <br/>
there at _http://unbridledlearning.podomatic.com_ <br/>
(http://unbridledlearning.podomatic.com/)    Once you are there, click on download to get the audio file.  <br/>
I am  working on getting listed in itunes as well. <br/>
If there is interest,  I will make more.  I already have a couple posts I <br/>
like for the next  one. <br/>
Thanks for the  feedback so far J<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I loved it thanks so much for doing it.  Keep up the  good work, i cant wait <br/>
to hear the next one.<br/>
