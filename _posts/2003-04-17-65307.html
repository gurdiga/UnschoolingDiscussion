Somewhat.<br/>
Most of the day to day stuff falls on my shoulders. But we run a home <br/>
business and I work part time outside the home, so we tag team it.<br/>
He usually gets home right before or after I leave (13 y.o. helps out on the <br/>
in between times) and he&#39;s usually ready to fall asleep by the time I get <br/>
home from work around 9:30pm. That&#39;s the start of another segment of our day <br/>
though. The kids and I watch tv, draw, eat and play games until 11pm or so.<br/>
Dh mostly just plays with them at home, I do the away from home lessons and <br/>
such most of the time.<br/>
But in a pinch, he helps out with the running too.<br/>
It&#39;s worked out really great most of the time. I&#39;m only working 12-18 hours a <br/>
week though, that helps a lot.<br/>

magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

Yes, we&#39;re an unjobbing, unschooling family. We run our own business, my DH<br/>
does most of the actual business work though I do some of the computer stuff<br/>
for the business. He&#39;s usually gone from home about 30 hours a week. For my<br/>
part, I&#39;m working on my first novel, editing it, finding an agent, and that<br/>
takes about 10 - 25 hours a week of my time, and I do part-time swim<br/>
coaching as well.<br/>
For most of the day-to-day activities, I&#39;m the main reference point. I&#39;m the<br/>
keeper of the schedule - what activities we&#39;re going to, what playdates we<br/>
have during the week, etc. I&#39;m the one who organizes any homeschool group<br/>
activities that we&#39;re going to sponsor - field trips or the like. DH<br/>
sometimes takes the kids to playdates or group activites - park day or<br/>
whatever, and he&#39;s usually home for a good chunk of the daylight hours, so<br/>
he spends a lot of time with the kids. Yesterday, he baked cookies, for<br/>
instance. Housework and things like grocery shopping are done by whomever is<br/>
home at the time. I do the bedtime routine with the kids, except for nights<br/>
that I have something like my writer&#39;s group meetings.<br/>
I think it really helps that our homeschool group has a large number of<br/>
families with similar schedules or ways of juggling time, so there are a lot<br/>
of involved dads. Last week at park day, there were five dads there, for<br/>
instance. So my husband never has to feel like the lone male in the group.<br/>
When we lived in the Seattle area and he was a full-time SAHD, he was often<br/>
the only man at the park.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892413449">Robin, it was great to hear your news about you and your husband. Gary is really excited about unschooling our children together. I am particularly interested, however in your remarks about writing your novel. I am attempting to do some writing now as well and could really use some support... ie. mentoring. Maybe we could talk some time off the list. Thanks, Kelli<br/>
