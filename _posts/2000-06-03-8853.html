&lt;&lt; What do you say? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, things slow down over the summer.  But, of course, we are sort of in <br/>
the habit now of going to the library once a week and there are all those <br/>
science experimetns we still want to get to.  But, it is summer, so the beach <br/>
calls too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I try not to rub it in too much that we actually went to the beach whenever <br/>
we wanted to during the year.  :)<br/>

&gt; I have a question.  How do you and your kids respond to the question, &quot;So<br/>
when are<br/>
&gt; you done with school?&quot;  This is our first year of homeschooling and<br/>
halfway through<br/>
&gt; we switched to unschooling.  So I guess we are always done with school,<br/>
but never<br/>
&gt; done with learning, but that just doesn&#39;t sound right.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What do you say?<br/>

<br/>
We just say that we school year-round, and that we focus more on inside or <br/>
outside activities based on the season and the weather (lots of inside stuff <br/>
today since it hit 96 degrees!).<br/>
<br/>
Where are you in NC?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Another one that I get asked is, &quot;Doesn&#39;t homeschooling take a lot of your<br/>
 time?&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Reply:  &quot;And what a wonderful way to spend my time - discussing fascinating <br/>
subjects with the people I love most.&quot;<br/>

Same here, and I add that we do more inside learning in the summer and winter <br/>
and take advantage of the beautiful weather in the spring and fall.  When it <br/>
starts hitting the mid-90&#39;s here in NC in the summer, people understand that <br/>
one!<br/>
