<div id="ygrps-yiv-833806048">I think there is an unparallelled opportunity to send letters to the Times<br/>
about the superiority of home education.  They report today:<br/>
<br/>
School is supposed to be boring, French Pupils told<br/>
<br/>
French schoolchildren who are weary of their country&#39;s rigorous education<br/>
system were told yesterday that school was not supposed to be fun and that<br/>
they should not confuse it with entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
Luc Ferry, the Minister for Youth, National Education and Research, made his<br/>
point as experts and bureaucrats met to address an epidemic of boredom that<br/>
is said to be afflicting France&#39;s centrally controlled school system.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The culture of school is not made to be entertaining.  Some apprenticeship<br/>
is difficult,&quot; he said.  M. Ferry, 51, who was a celebrity philosopher [now<br/>
there&#39;s a thing!] until President Chirac appointed him to the Cabinet last<br/>
May, admitted that in his own schooldays &quot;80 per cant of us were as bored as<br/>
dead rats&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Tedium has always been part of school and boredom in the classroom is said<br/>
to be rampant everywhere in the video age.  France has made efforts in<br/>
recent years to involve pupils in more creative activities.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more but I can&#39;t find the link.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Shyrley, this is interesting timing. I have friends in town who are <br/>
French. I&#39;ve lived in France and speak French. I went to college in <br/>
France for a year.<br/>
<br/>
One of the French moms invited a number of homeschoolers <br/>
over to meet other French mothers. They didn&#39;t know anything <br/>
about homeschooling and asked us all kinds of questions. The <br/>
most startling response to all our sharing was when one mother <br/>
said,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Even if the education is inferior and even if the children don&#39;t <br/>
enjoy it, I would not want to pull my children out of the state <br/>
funded programs to make them better than other people. We <br/>
should all have the same education and not make some <br/>
superior to others.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well tie my shoelaces!<br/>
<br/>
Right there I saw the cultural absorption of the ideals of <br/>
socialism. all the motehrs basically agreed with this position, yet <br/>
they couldn&#39;t let go of their fascination with our way of doing <br/>
things. It was enlightening.<br/>
<br/>
One thing they also said was that their kids loved going to school <br/>
in the states! They loved the way the students could get up and <br/>
move around a classroom, the encouragement of group projects <br/>
and the absence of ridicule as a method of motivation (very <br/>
prevalent in France). They also preferred the way teachers used <br/>
multi media to the typical workbook program all day.<br/>
<br/>
That was interesting. France made these poor kids keep up with <br/>
their French grade levels in addition to their schooling here so <br/>
these kids were literally doing two times the work of our kids in <br/>
school here. I felt so badly for them. :(<br/>
<br/>
University in France was a kick! Classes began in Sept. but the <br/>
students didn&#39;t show up until mid Oct and sometimes not until <br/>
the New Year. Classes lasted all year. I actually enjoyed my <br/>
classes there very much, even though they weren&#39;t that rigorous. <br/>
I was used to UCLA which is a pretty academic school.<br/>
<br/>
There is a painful apathy in French children and they are <br/>
notoriously mischevious. It&#39;s something that we&#39;ve noticed over <br/>
the years (we lived in Morocco too and knew French families <br/>
there...). But the mothers are actually quite wonderful in many <br/>
ways too. They don&#39;t believe in corporal punishment, are very <br/>
affectionate and they lead rich artisitc lives compared to what I&#39;m <br/>
used to here.<br/>
<br/>
Strange mix.<br/>
<br/>
All that to say that I&#39;m not at all surprised that the government <br/>
would say school isn&#39;t meant to be fun. :)<br/>
