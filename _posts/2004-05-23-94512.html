<div id="ygrps-yiv-500561270">The recent posts on video games drew my interest quickly, because <br/>
I&#39;m struggling somewhat with a problem (?).  Maybe the &#39;problem&#39; is <br/>
really just &#39;me&#39;, and how &#39;I&#39; see the situation ;o).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve made peace with the whole video game experience in our <br/>
household as far as length of time spent on video games, and even <br/>
the violence in video games, believing that if I trust my child to <br/>
be his own &#39;monitor&#39; in what he can personally be comfortable with, <br/>
he will make the right choices for himself....BUT...<br/>
<br/>
When he and dad play together, which is almost daily, my husband <br/>
becomes a &#39;child&#39; during play, and the two of them can become fairly <br/>
verbally abusive to each other during game play, and get VERY LOUD <br/>
in their verbal attacks on each other.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about this so much, and are each aware of each other&#39;s <br/>
thoughts and feelings on it, but I&#39;m interested in hearing other&#39;s <br/>
views on this.<br/>
<br/>
Our child doesn&#39;t have siblings to play with every day, so my <br/>
husband feels he is playing the role of &#39;sibling&#39; during thier <br/>
playtime, whether it be video games, wrestling, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Our son has friends that he plays with on a regular basis, and I <br/>
believe he learns what he needs to learn about getting along with <br/>
other kids, without dad having to become a &#39;child&#39; and engage in <br/>
such childish behaviors....<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if this activity makes it difficult for our son to &#39;know&#39; <br/>
when dad is being &#39;dad&#39; or when he&#39;s being &#39;sibling&#39;....for <br/>
instance, when dad is ready to &#39;quit&#39;, our son doesn&#39;t...he will <br/>
continue to try to incite arguements, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve actually sought out counseling for this, but haven&#39;t been <br/>
entirely honest with the counselors, because the counselors I&#39;ve <br/>
come across don&#39;t even think our son should be spending so much time <br/>
on video games, shouldn&#39;t be exposed to the violence of the games, <br/>
and blah, blah, blah...in other words, I &#39;feel out&#39; the counselors, <br/>
and decide before I even get into discussing the conflict, that the <br/>
counselor will have the &#39;usual&#39; conventional opinions regarding kids <br/>
and video games, so I don&#39;t get any further in resolving the issue.<br/>
<br/>
There are other issues at play here that make it difficult for me to <br/>
reach a peaceful end to this conflict.  <br/>
<br/>
For one thing, my husband resents all the time I spend with our son, <br/>
all the energies I put into raising him, which means less time for <br/>
him and me.  Which leads me to believe that he is &#39;using&#39; the <br/>
opportunity to let some of his frustrations out on our son....<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s the issue of our son being so much better at video <br/>
games than dad, that our son gets VERY annoyed at dad&#39;s lack of <br/>
expertise, and starts yelling at dad for being so &#39;stupid&#39;....(our <br/>
son has been playing since he was 4 (he is now 8), and is very <br/>
skilled, and can do a lot of it while at the same time, carrying on <br/>
a conversation with someone else about something entirely unrelated <br/>
to the game).<br/>
<br/>
When they are playing, I often go in and put a stop to it, because <br/>
it has become too verbally abusive IMO.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was raised with two older brothers who overpowered him a <br/>
lot and, in my opinion, was very abusive to him.  But much of what <br/>
happend in his life, he sees as &#39;boys being boys&#39;.  Some of it he <br/>
realizes was abusive, but most of it he attributes to just &#39;being <br/>
boys&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
The main reason all of this concerns me so greatly, is that I don&#39;t <br/>
want our son growing up feeling &#39;overpowered&#39; by ANYONE for ANY <br/>
REASON.<br/>
<br/>
Although our son holds his own in conflicts with dad, and treats his <br/>
dad like another kid, I&#39;m not so sure all of this is healthy.  I <br/>
know my son feels great frustration at times because his dad is so <br/>
much bigger and stronger than he is, and he knows that if push comes <br/>
down to shove, he will lose.  On the other hand, I guess he needs to <br/>
know that he WILL lose sometimes in life.<br/>
<br/>
My husband normally doesn&#39;t &#39;overpower&#39; our son, unless our son has <br/>
become &#39;unmanageable&#39;, but *I* think the &#39;unmanageable&#39; comes from <br/>
frustration in their relationship.<br/>
<br/>
There are other issues involved, and I have plenty of other thoughts <br/>
on it, but this is getting rather long. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to &#39;use&#39; this list as a &#39;counseling&#39; experience, but I <br/>
do need advice and greatly appreciate other&#39;s views on this.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any input!</div>

obnoxious. At least it would feel that way to me. I don&#39;t think I&#39;d <br/>
want another child in my house if they acted in that manner and I <br/>
can&#39;t imagine my kids&#39; friends acting like this when they are over <br/>
playing video games. Is there a way that the three of you can sit <br/>
down and come up with some principles you&#39;d like to live by? In our <br/>
house, we don&#39;t verbally or physically abuse or attack another person <br/>
(unless it&#39;s things like wrestling or pillow fights, where all <br/>
parties are in agreement). This isn&#39;t a &quot;rule&quot; and there aren&#39;t any <br/>
punishments for breaking a rule, it&#39;s just how we&#39;d all like to treat <br/>
each other and be treated. In the scenario you describe, what I&#39;d <br/>
worry about is your husband showing your son a behavior that could <br/>
get him in considerable trouble outside of your family. After all, if <br/>
you are verbally abusive to an adult or other child, it&#39;s possible <br/>
that they will retaliate physically. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the power play aspect of your husband&#39;s behavior, which <br/>
seems like it is coming out in several unhealthy ways, but you&#39;re <br/>
aware of that. That&#39;s a very hard problem to solve. I would keep <br/>
looking for a good counselor though. When I needed a counselor <br/>
several years ago, a friend referred me to a therapist who had been a <br/>
relatively relaxed parent - extended nursing, family bed, <br/>
homeschooling. It helped that we were on the same page with these <br/>
things so that it didn&#39;t hamper any interactions or cause the <br/>
counselor to give advice that I wouldn&#39;t take. <br/>
<br/>
On the issues with your husband resenting time you spend with your <br/>
son, maybe you can make more time just to be with him? Since your son <br/>
is 8, you can probably make some time for dates just with your <br/>
husband. We trade off with other parents in our HS group - our <br/>
friends watched our kids Friday night for instance and we went out <br/>
together, just for a few hours. Also, we stay up after the kids go to <br/>
bed and watch movies, or talk, or whatever ;-). Making time for the <br/>
two of us to do things together is important. There were a few years <br/>
when the kids were very small when it was hard or impossible, but <br/>
those years pass and it&#39;s important to renew the parents&#39; <br/>
relationship too. Perhaps your husband would feel less resentment if <br/>
you both focused on togetherness as well as parenting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-606414082">Thank you for your very thoughtful and encouraging reply, Robin.  My <br/>
husband and I had a very indepth discussion here last night <br/>
regarding all of this.  <br/>
<br/>
The messages in your reply helped me to stand more firm in my <br/>
convictions, without me becoming abusive or whiney in my language to <br/>
him.  It helped a lot to know there was someone (although <br/>
unseen) &#39;in my corner&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
He was surprisingly receptive, I think because I didn&#39;t approach him <br/>
from a &#39;victim&#39; stance, but from a stance of firm conviction.  He <br/>
KNEW I was &#39;right&#39; in this.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been very hard to remain &#39;firm&#39; in some things &#39;out here&#39; where <br/>
there is little support, and the &#39;mainstream&#39; thinks I&#39;m a bit &#39;off&#39; <br/>
in my beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how a little support goes a long way in resolving inner <br/>
conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Dad and son played for two hours last night, and the only screaming <br/>
that took place was from my son when he got frustrated with the <br/>
game.  Dad mostly &#39;advised&#39; son in some moves, which helped son to <br/>
win the game.  Afterwards, son was very loving toward dad, and <br/>
vice/versa, and that was truly wonderful to see.<br/>
<br/>
There is hope;o)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
