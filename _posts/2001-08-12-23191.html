&gt; I just don&#39;t think anything a person does, whether its an engineer, an<br/>
&gt; accountant, or anything else is separated into subjects. An accountant<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t only do math, a massage therapist doesn&#39;t only do massages, etc. Hope<br/>
&gt; I am making my point clearly. . . NAK<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad you wrote this, as I was about to post something similar.<br/>
<br/>
I was a cost accountant. I learned entirely on the job. It takes very, very<br/>
little &quot;math&quot; as is presented in school. You need a good calculator and need<br/>
to learn how to use it. You need an obsession with orderliness, and that&#39;s<br/>
pretty much it.<br/>
<br/>
Schools, colleges, separate things into &quot;subjects&quot;. Life does not.<br/>
Separating what a person does all day into &quot;subjects&quot; can be a fun<br/>
unschooling party trick, but life goes on and doesn&#39;t care whether you do<br/>
it. Life goes on and we learn whether we do it.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra had a good point with the percentages: I didn&#39;t learn how to do<br/>
percentages, mathematically on a worksheet, until this year. I glazed over<br/>
them in school, and quickly learned the few real life ones needed by using<br/>
them (tips). I learned how to plug them into the computer for my job as an<br/>
accountant, and later didn&#39;t need them so much for my job as a dog trainer,<br/>
or my job now as a bookseller.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I was thinking about them the other day, but I said to my<br/>
husband, &quot;if I do this, then is it that?&quot; and he said, &quot;yes&quot; and I thought,<br/>
&quot;oh, so THAT&#39;s how you do that&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 35 in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t need to know how to do percentages up till now. I still don&#39;t,<br/>
really, but for some reason it caught my interest at this time. It is no<br/>
more &quot;vital&quot; for me to know than how to fit a collar on my dog. In fact,<br/>
less vital. But I doubt anyone here would suggest that I need to sit my<br/>
daughters down and teach them &quot;collar fitting&quot; before lunch.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing that is necessarily more important than anything else.<br/>
There is no way to prepare children &quot;in advance&quot; for what they want to do in<br/>
20 years, because we don&#39;t know what that is. The only ones who have SOME<br/>
inkling (and we have to accept their right to change their minds and<br/>
directions 400 or 40,000 times) are our kids. THEY know what speaks to them<br/>
and sings to them. They know it when they do it, and we don&#39;t get to choose<br/>
what is right for them. We can choose to force what is wrong for them, but<br/>
we don&#39;t get to choose what is right.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to spend all his time playing basketball, then that&#39;s what<br/>
he needs to learn. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll grow up to play basketball. Might,<br/>
might not.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to spend all his time taking things apart, then that&#39;s what<br/>
he needs to learn. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll grow up to be a mechanic. Might, might<br/>
not.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to spend all his time playing computer games, then that&#39;s<br/>
what he needs to learn. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll grow up to be a programmer.<br/>
Might, might not.<br/>
<br/>
If a child wants to spend all his time doing math worksheets, then that&#39;s<br/>
what he needs to learn. Doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;ll grow up to be a professor of<br/>
mathematics. Might, might not.<br/>
<br/>
School has fed us a line about children being prepared. Class time on<br/>
percentages was wasted on me. Class time on fine literature was wasted on my<br/>
brother in law. Class time on home ec was wasted on my sister.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike schools, we don&#39;t have to waste our children&#39;s time. We can accept<br/>
that time is theirs, not ours, to spend how they choose, and just make sure<br/>
there are plenty of choices so they can choose well -- for them, not us.<br/>
