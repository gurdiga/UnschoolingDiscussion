&lt;&lt; My Dad make me eat my peas when I was <br/>
 little. I tried to eat them with milk and I vomited. Never touched a pea <br/>
since.<br/>

That happened with me with ham. My step mother was a bitch, hehehe, I eat it <br/>
now, tho.  <br/>
<br/>
My grandpa once left me in the dark at the dining room table after everyone <br/>
had gone to bed because I refused to eat my peas.  My grandma came and got me <br/>
after he was asleep.  She knew I wasn&#39;t going to eat them, lol I  wish now she <br/>
had left me til morning, I would&#39;ve shown him!  LOL  He wasn&#39;t the only <br/>
stubborn one in that house! <br/>

If you&#39;re ever going to try peas again, btw, cook onions in lots of butter <br/>
til they&#39;re transluscent, then add Le Seure ( Sp?) baby peas til heated, with a <br/>
little salt.  Totally unhealthy but the only way to eat peas, I say.  <br/>
