of the &quot;hamburger&quot; comes from Australia in the form of bull meat and that<br/>

Safeway, Kroger, etc. and all the hamburger/fastfood joints) get their&#39;s<br/>

can you imagine what a burger would cost today if they didn&#39;t use the<br/>
&quot;cheaper&quot; parts of the cow?!?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know but I am starting to get nauseous! Why do I like the taste so<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358443054">The origin of the hamburger is unknown (according to Brittanica). However, it is believed to have been brought over by german immigrants...later to become an american icon!<br/>
  Just a bit of history: Back in the 50&#39;s & 60&#39;s when my dad was a short order cook, they would take RIB-EYE STEAKS,run them through a grinder,and add fat because they were so dry....can you imagine what a burger would cost today if they didn&#39;t use the &quot;cheaper&quot; parts of the cow?!?<br/>

I guess I should get my meat strictly from the mom and pop farm stores<br/>
around here even though it is a lot more money if I can&#39;t help myself on<br/>
those days when I seem to crave it! Do you still own that butcher shop?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045200365">Sold it to a cousin.  There are a couple of big chains that buy from places<br/>
like Harris Ranch (organic beef) that only do their own grinding also.  We<br/>
have a chain out here called Ray&#39;s Food Place (CA and Oregon) that sells<br/>
Harris Ranch beef and it is no more expensive than Safeway, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900543043">Oh geez, I&#39;m probably going to be in BIG trouble for this one.  Oh, what<br/>
the heck, call it an unschooling learning moment &lt;g&gt;  Actually, a good % of<br/>
the fast food joint burgers probably are &quot;cow&quot; burgers because that is what<br/>
happens to dairy cows when they no longer make their quotas.  Now, for the<br/>
higher grades of burger that you buy in a super market (not the basic<br/>
ground beef), you are quite likely to get &quot;beef&quot; burgers, mostly steer with<br/>
a little heifer, a smidge of cow and a lot of bull thrown in.  Oh, bad<br/>
Lynda!  And, since most of the beef that is &quot;grown&quot; in the US is usually a<br/>
cross between &quot;beef&quot; breeds and &quot;dairy&quot; breeds, you&#39;d need to call them<br/>
&quot;cattle&quot; burgers.<br/>
