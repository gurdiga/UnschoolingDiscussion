Subject: DEA getting close to *banning* hemp foods and cosmetic products!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Dear Friend,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The DEA has now officially announced that it intends to ban most hemp<br/>
&gt; products in the United States, including food made from sterile (non-<br/>
&gt; psychoactive) hemp seeds and hemp-based personal-care products.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Whether or not you expressed your outrage in October when we first<br/>
&gt; heard about the DEA&#39;s plans, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.SaveHemp.org">http://www.SaveHemp.org</a> now<br/>
&gt; to send an updated pre-written letter to all of your elected officials<br/>
&gt; and the DEA.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Many legislators who are now in office were not in office in October.<br/>
&gt; In addition, legislators who contacted the DEA in October on behalf of<br/>
&gt; their constituents were told that there wasn&#39;t any official proposal<br/>
&gt; to ban hemp -- which is no longer true. Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.SaveHemp.org">http://www.SaveHemp.org</a><br/>
&gt; to send your second round of letters today!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Under the DEA&#39;s proposed regulation, literally millions of Americans<br/>
&gt; will be criminalized for possessing shampoos, lotions, and soaps that<br/>
&gt; have the slightest amount of naturally occurring THC, the primary<br/>
&gt; active ingredient in marijuana. (It is impossible to get a<br/>
&gt; psychoactive effect from hemp-based shampoos and soaps, but the DEA is<br/>
&gt; proposing to ban them nevertheless.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those who are arrested for shampoo or soap will face up to one year in<br/>
&gt; federal prison and a $10,000 fine -- the same penalties they would<br/>
&gt; face if they were arrested for possessing a small amount of marijuana.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone is arrested with a stockpile of (currently legal) hemp<br/>
&gt; products that weighs hundreds of pounds, it stands to reason that<br/>
&gt; the defendant would face a 5- or 10-year mandatory minimum prison<br/>
&gt; sentence -- or even the death penalty -- under federal law.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are already 700,000 arrests every year in the U.S. for marijuana<br/>
&gt; offenses. Our nation&#39;s beleaguered criminal justice system doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; need the additional strain of processing 100,000&#39;s of additional<br/>
&gt; arrests that will result from the illegal possession of non-<br/>
&gt; psychoactive shampoos and soaps.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We don&#39;t need another front in our nation&#39;s failed war on drugs.<br/>
&gt; Please oppose the DEA&#39;s hemp ban before it is allowed to take effect.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In urgency,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; P.S. Please distribute this message as widely as you can. Thank you!<br/>
