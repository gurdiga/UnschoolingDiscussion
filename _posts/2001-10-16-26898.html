Children schooled at home have better social skills<br/>

 <br/>
Children who are educated at home have better social skills and achieve<br/>
higher grades on standardized tests than students in private or public<br/>
schools, according to a new report.<br/>
<br/>
Contrary to the popular belief that children educated at home are<br/>
disadvantaged because of a lack of peers, the study by the Fraser Institute<br/>
shows they are happier, better adjusted and more sociable that those at<br/>
institutional schools. The average child educated at home participates in a<br/>
range of activities with other children outside the family and 98% are<br/>
involved in two or more extracurricular activities such as field trips and<br/>
music lessons per week, the report says.<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooled children also regularly outperform other students on<br/>
standardized tests.<br/>
<br/>
Children taught at home in Canada score, on average, at the 80th percentile<br/>
in reading, at the 76th percentile in languages and at the 79th percentile<br/>
in mathematics, the report shows. Private and public students perform, on<br/>
average, in the 50th percentile on mandatory tests in the same subjects.<br/>
<br/>
In the United States, students educated at home also achieve the highest<br/>
grades on standardized tests and outperform other students on college<br/>
entrance exams, including the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), according to<br/>
the study.<br/>
<br/>
Parents of home-schooled children in both countries are generally higher<br/>
educated when compared to the national average.<br/>
<br/>
They tend to be in two-parent families and have a higher-than-average<br/>
number of children than the overall population.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick Basham, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a conservative<br/>
public policy group in Washington, and author of the report, said he was<br/>
surprised to see such positive results linked to home schooling.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;People think these children are neurotic, unsocialized and can&#39;t function<br/>
in normal society. But the opposite is true. I think the fact children<br/>
educated at home do better than private school students would also surprise<br/>
people. It is not something that is widely debated or studied,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooled children are still a tiny minority in Canada, although an<br/>
increasing number of parents are opting for this style of education. In<br/>
1979, 2,000 children were educated at home. By 1996, 17,500 students --<br/>
0.4% of total enrollment -- were home schooled. The most recent figures<br/>
show the number has risen to 80,000 children.<br/>
<br/>
Parents educate their children at home for a variety of reasons, including<br/>
the desire to impart a particular set of beliefs and values, an interest in<br/>
higher academic performance and a lack of discipline in public schools,<br/>
says the report.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Although parents home school their children for myriad reasons, the<br/>
principal stimulus is dissatisfaction with public education,&quot; said Claudia<br/>
Hepburn, director of education policy at the Fraser Institute, a<br/>
Vancouver-based conservative think-tank.<br/>
<br/>
Home schooling is legal throughout Canada, but most provinces require<br/>
parents comply with provincial education legislation, which means they must<br/>
provide satisfactory instruction. Alberta is the only province that funds<br/>
home-based education.<br/>
<br/>
None of the provinces requires that parents have teaching qualifications.<br/>
However, having one parent who is a certified teacher has no significant<br/>
effect on the achievement of students educated at home, the research shows.<br/>
<br/>
Gary Duthler, executive director of the Federation of Independent Schools<br/>
in Canada, the association for non-public schools, said children educated<br/>
at home likely do better and are more sociable because of the smaller<br/>
student-teacher ratio and the fact students of all ages learn together.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In institutional schools, there is social pressure for 10-year-old<br/>
children to behave like other 10-year-olds and they tend to not play with<br/>
any older children at school.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In a home setting, that same pressure is not there, so it helps the<br/>
children mature.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said they probably also do well because they have access to education<br/>
resources and teaching expertise over the Internet but their parents are<br/>
controlling their education.<br/>

would never learn the social skills she needs to get a job.<br/>
My ds went to ps, and is academically gifted.<br/>
