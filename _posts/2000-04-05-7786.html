<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058823833">Good Morning Everyone,<br/>
Has anyone heard of or used the Pass Test? I live in NH and we are supposed <br/>
to give some form of evaluation. I was going to do a portfolio, because I was <br/>
doing &quot;School at Home&quot; at first then I switched to Unschooling (Lucky Me) So <br/>
anyway now Im afraid I wont have enough material for the portfolio, and Im <br/>
afraid that any evaluators around here would not understand Unschooling. Any <br/>
ideas? I would much appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
