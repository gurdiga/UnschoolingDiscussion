<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451241853">**One of the problems with self-declared experts or those who must have<br/>
someone they can declare an expert is that inorder to keep the title, the<br/>
parameters of their expertise must be sharply defined.**<br/>

Lynda,<br/>
I like what you said here.   I have developed a tendency to avoid those who<br/>
consider themselves &quot;experts&quot;.  In gact,  one of the reasons I quit my part<br/>
time job at the local Alzheimer&#39;s Association invoved this &#39;philosophical&#39;<br/>
difference in approach between my supervisor and I.<br/>
    I all my speaking with families coping with the disease,  groups,  and<br/>
individuals...I (and my co-workers)  emphasized that while we may have a<br/>
detailed knowledge and large information base...the individual/family is the<br/>
only one who can utilize that information in the &quot;best&quot; way for their<br/>
particular situation.  I usually reffered to them,  pr asked of them,  to<br/>
become (if I felt they weren&#39;t *there* yet)  the *expert* of their<br/>
situation.  And to utilize the knowledge of professional as it fit their<br/>
needs.<br/>
    My hope was to have that onus of responsibilty on them....mostly to<br/>
&quot;empower&quot; them (now there&#39;s a Social Work word for ya!) to have confidence<br/>
in dealing with Drs., Lawyers, Social Workers,  nurses,  etc....I tend to<br/>
have less respect for the ones who portray themselves as &quot;experts&quot;,  then<br/>
don&#39;t give a family or individual the time,  the listening ear,  etc.  Plus<br/>
it puts themn in the &quot;I&#39;m *helping* you&quot; position rather than the &quot;I&#39;ll<br/>
listen and provide information that you may be able to help yourself&quot;<br/>
position where people are equals.<br/>
    Those oare my thoughts on *experts*...they generalize to other areas.<br/>
More ramblings,<br/>
