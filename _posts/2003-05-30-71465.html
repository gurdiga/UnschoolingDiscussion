&lt;&lt; &gt; It&#39;s not words, it&#39;s the intent. Remember the above words (&#39;f*****<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; b*****&#39;) could be used in a fairly innocent sentence about one&#39;s<br/>
&gt; female dog copulating with the neighbor&#39;s studly mutt. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>heehee<br/>
Not in Stepford they couldn&#39;t. The neighbours would swoon if anything that <br/>
crude went on :-)<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t intend to rub Keith&#39;s nose in it when I mentioned &quot;poopy diaper,&quot; <br/>
but you&#39;d think I had smeared it all over her newly painted kitchen just because <br/>
I uttered the word &quot;poop&quot; (in reference to &quot;poop,&quot; in the presence of a <br/>
diaper baby who hardly understood any words whatsoever).<br/>
<br/>
Some people DO swoon easily.<br/>
