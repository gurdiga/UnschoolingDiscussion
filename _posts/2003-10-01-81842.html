<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568040924">I cannot remember who it was that posted about bird watching. I don&#39;t <br/>
have the link but if you type birdsource.org you will pull some <br/>
pretty neat links to the birds :) There is a Great Backyard Bird <br/>
Count which has some pretty neat things to click on to. <br/>
ENJOY :)<br/>
