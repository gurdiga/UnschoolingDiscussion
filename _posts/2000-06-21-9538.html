<div id="ygrps-yiv-304680847">Just want to say Karen, that I really respect you and all the other<br/>
moms/dads who have given up a second income to be home raising your<br/>
kids!  It&#39;s very true that too many others seem threatened by that<br/>
choice...perhaps hit with a pang of guilt with the awareness you are<br/>
doing the &quot;right thing&quot;.  My husband and I are having to re-explore that<br/>
choice again for ourselves...with dramatic changes in our income/career<br/>
situation.  There&#39;s no doubt life can be easier in a lot of ways with a<br/>
few extra $$thousand$$, but I think it&#39;s far too easy to under-estimate<br/>
what other price is paid for a second income.  And besides, I thought<br/>
the whole feminist movement for equality was about &quot;Choice&quot; for women. <br/>
Why are we so often pressured by society that we don&#39;t measure up and<br/>
aren&#39;t real women if we prefer the domestic life and make our children<br/>
our priority?<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; Something one of them told<br/>
&gt;  me was that I would probably end up changing all my friends as the ones I<br/>

&gt;  what I&#39;m doing and to expect a backlash.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     There is always a chance that this could happen-- it did happen with one<br/>
&gt; of my friends.  She first knew  me and my husband as &quot;dinks&quot;- dual income, no<br/>
&gt; kids-- then we adopted our first child, and my friend was thrilled about it;<br/>
&gt; then I decided to quit my job as a teacher to stay home full time, and our<br/>
&gt; relationship began to change from this point.  Then I became pregnant when my<br/>
&gt; first son was about 17 mos, and we grew apart more, but I don&#39;t really know<br/>
&gt; why.  She had a baby before I adopted, so it&#39;s not that she couldn&#39;t be a<br/>
&gt; mother.  After we tried the preschool routine for a few months and decided to<br/>
&gt; homeschool, she must have thought I&#39;d gone off the deep end.  Her child has<br/>
&gt; always gone to daycare before going to preschool and onto reg. school, so we<br/>
&gt; approached child rearing completely differently.  Well, then I got pregnant<br/>
&gt; when my second child was 2, and she commented that she couldn&#39;t believe that<br/>
&gt; I was pregnant AGAIN, as if I had 12 children already. So, we still are<br/>
&gt; &quot;Nice&quot; to each other, but we do not really socialize any more, as we just do<br/>
&gt; not have much in common.  Our kids, however, do play almost daily!   I guess<br/>
&gt; to her I have probably changed so much.  I probably seem like I&#39;m trying to<br/>
&gt; be &quot;mother earth&quot; as I restrict  refined sugars from our foods as much as<br/>
&gt; possible; I cook/bake/sew/garden as much as I can, too.  We used  to shop<br/>
&gt; more, eat out more, wear new clothes more often, travel more, etc... but it<br/>
&gt; is not as possible now with three little ones .  My dh is a police officer,<br/>
&gt; so he is able to work off duty to supplement our income, since I do not earn<br/>
&gt; an income now.  I think this irritates my friend, too.  It would seem to her,<br/>
&gt; that I am being selfish or something, and that my &quot;poor&quot; husband is working<br/>
&gt; all of the time.  He has said that this is what he wants, and that he would<br/>
&gt; not want our kids in daycare, but still, she will think what she wants to.<br/>
&gt; Oh well, I have other relationships that have not changed at all, or have<br/>
&gt; gotten stronger, after my staying home and our deciding to homeschool, and I<br/>
&gt; have met people through homeschooling; so overall, I think it is working out<br/>

As usual a wonderful inspirational message for me to remember...  I talked to <br/>
my best friend yesterday who is having marriage problems, compounded by the <br/>
fact that he kids are really wild since attending pre-school and she was sort <br/>
of quiet about the whole thing (except for the screaming and shouting she did <br/>
to her kids, while we were on the phone)... She did say she couldn&#39;t do it <br/>
because she would kill them as they drove her crazy now without being with <br/>
them all day and of course that brought up all fears in me of being &quot;stuck&quot; <br/>
with 2 screaming children and I&#39;d be helpless.  That thought quickly passed <br/>
when I realized I was in a different kind of marriage to her and had 2 very <br/>
different children to her.  My husband decided this morning to devise a plan <br/>
to give to his boss where he trains somebody else up to the next level <br/>
whereby they can have the office covered (he&#39;s in computers) from 5am - 9pm.  <br/>
He is also going to suggest that he works from 5am -1pm and the other guy the <br/>
other 8 hours.  This way he&#39;ll be able to be at home as well in the <br/>
afternoons with the kids.  This has also helped with my fears of &quot;can I <br/>
cope&quot;...  Hubbie says if they won&#39;t go for it, I&#39;ll quit and start my own <br/>
business, which is the goal anyway.  It&#39;s all change in this household (LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587276314">I can relate! My poor dh has lost his bf cuz we had a child. We do not<br/>
know the details but after years of trying, they announced that she<br/>
cannot have children. They then told us that being childless was better<br/>
and all their friends with kids were miserable. A month later (you<br/>
guessed it!) we got pg. They have been nothing but supportive and sent<br/>
cards and think she&#39;s adorable, but since we got pg, they simply can&#39;t<br/>
seem to find the time to see us. We see them once a year at Christmas<br/>
and that&#39;s it. I feel bad for her and do understand why she might not<br/>
want to be around us. Luckily, every now and then dh gets to see his bf<br/>
(the dh) when his wife goes out of town. <br/>
<br/>
I had a very good friend in college who was devastated when I announced<br/>
I was getting married. She thought I was selling out or being too<br/>
&quot;mainstream&quot; or something. When I told her I was pg, she never even<br/>
replied to my email (I did not, and still do not have her phone number).<br/>
We get a card once a year on Christmas. She includes dd in her<br/>
greetings, but does not call, no longer invites us over and does not<br/>
return letters. <br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s just natural that you drift apart from some people. I was<br/>
saddened this past Memorial Day weekend when I realized I was drifting<br/>
from my old college friends. We got along really well when I was<br/>
drinking and partying. Now that I&#39;m married and a mom, I have nothing to<br/>
talk about with them (how many times can you listen to the same &quot;I was<br/>
soooooo drunk&quot; story?).<br/>
<br/>
I think if you are real friends then the friendship survives. If you are<br/>
only friends cuz of something external (go to the same college, both<br/>
like to drink, both breastfeed etc.) then that friendship will not last<br/>
when that external factor is gone (graduate, go on the wagon, the child<br/>
weans, etc). Boy, do I sound like an after school special? LOL! :-)<br/>

&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; my best friend yesterday who is having marriage problems, compounded by<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fact that he kids are really wild since attending pre-school and she was<br/>
&gt; sort<br/>
&gt; &gt; of quiet about the whole thing (except for the screaming and shouting<br/>
she<br/>
&gt; did<br/>
&gt; &gt; to her kids, while we were on the phone)... She did say she couldn&#39;t do<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; because she would kill them as they drove her crazy now without being<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; them all day and of course that brought up all fears in me of being<br/>
&gt; &quot;stuck&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; with 2 screaming children and I&#39;d be helpless.  That thought quickly<br/>
&gt; passed<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I realized I was in a different kind of marriage to her and had 2<br/>
&gt; very<br/>
&gt; &gt; different children to her.  My husband decided this morning to devise a<br/>
&gt; plan<br/>
&gt; &gt; to give to his boss where he trains somebody else up to the next level<br/>
&gt; &gt; whereby they can have the office covered (he&#39;s in computers) from 5am -<br/>
&gt; 9pm.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He is also going to suggest that he works from 5am -1pm and the other<br/>
guy<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; other 8 hours.  This way he&#39;ll be able to be at home as well in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; afternoons with the kids.  This has also helped with my fears of &quot;can I<br/>
&gt; &gt; cope&quot;...  Hubbie says if they won&#39;t go for it, I&#39;ll quit and start my<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; &gt; business, which is the goal anyway.  It&#39;s all change in this household<br/>
&gt; (LOL)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730595514">Way to go, Dawn!  I too go nutz with the idea of daycare and<br/>
institutionalizing children.  Thanks for speaking up to your friend<br/>
too.  That took guts.  My husband and I are fairly worried about our<br/>
financial future as our income is about to drop by $20,000.00 - and we<br/>
weren&#39;t earning the &quot;big bucks&quot; at that either!  My husband isn&#39;t happy<br/>
with his current position and is considering a career change.  He just<br/>
earned his MCSE and will see about a new job in the computer field as<br/>
well...It&#39;s a tough sacrifice to leave one position to start at the<br/>
bottom and break into a new one.  But I am determined to not put the<br/>
kids in public school (for &quot;free&quot; babysitting) or daycare if I have to<br/>
start working again.   My husband and I are prepared to work shifts too.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My husband and I didn&#39;t give up our second income, we found a way to have<br/>
&gt; both the kids and the work.  I started an at home business that is very<br/>
&gt; successful, that I work around my kids.  Now I could probably make twice as<br/>
&gt; much if I went back to my old profession and went out of the house and dumped<br/>
&gt; them in daycare, but I just can&#39;t bring myself to do that.  When our son Zak<br/>
&gt; was 11 months old we moved from Las Vegas to Tucson, to be close to my<br/>
&gt; parents and so that Zak would have grandparents.  I was also not willing to<br/>
&gt; do daycare and needed to find something else.  My husband got out of the<br/>
&gt; airforce and got unemployment for a while of $156 per week.  I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
&gt; job and we just bought a house with $800 mortgage payment.  We had $5000 in<br/>
&gt; savings and I said to people &quot;I&#39;m going to start a new business&quot;  The<br/>
&gt; response was you are crazy, you should go work for someone else.  My husband<br/>
&gt; then announced he hated being a Fireman and wanted to get into computers and<br/>
&gt; so that&#39;s what he was going to do.  So in effect we both changed our careers.<br/>
&gt;  What started off as one thing for me has moved into something different.  I<br/>
&gt; now help people with making sure their careers and relationships are moving<br/>
&gt; in the best direction for growth in all other aspects of their lives.  This<br/>
&gt; is not quite what I started out to do.  My husband got a seasonal job<br/>
&gt; learning computers with Intuit (tax people) went on to another company to do<br/>
&gt; technical support, went back to school with the GI Bill and graduates on<br/>
&gt; Saturday with his BA in Computer Managment.  He then kept taking new jobs<br/>
&gt; every 9 months that gave him more money and paid for him to take more<br/>
&gt; certifications.  After 4 years he&#39;s a Network Manager with a very large<br/>
&gt; company here in Tucson.  Did we have problems with not paying our credit<br/>
&gt; cards and mortgage???  Sure we did... But so what.. We are not our credit<br/>
&gt; report and eventually that all got sorted out to where our credit is in good<br/>
&gt; standing (seems to be very important in this country).  We didn&#39;t do daycare<br/>
&gt; in all of this and at the beginning Steve worked from 2pm-11pm and I worked<br/>
&gt; in the mornings, so our son had both of us.  This continued until he was<br/>
&gt; about 3 and Steve started working more regular hours.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that we have Max as well we are re-evaluating how simple life was when we<br/>
&gt; just had Zak and how much time we put into him.  We&#39;ve noticed that it&#39;s easy<br/>
&gt; to get caught up in the money and what it can get us.  But for us it take us<br/>
&gt; away from the basics of what we wanted to do which was raise our own kids,<br/>
&gt; hence the idea of unschooling for us.  So now we are spending our time<br/>
&gt; figuring out how Steve can get back to the place he was at so that he&#39;s more<br/>
&gt; involved and that we do this as a shared experience, which will benefit our<br/>
&gt; boys enormously.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the things I abhore about the feminist movement is this idea that<br/>
&gt; raising children is somehow beneath women and that the goal of a woman should<br/>
&gt; be to make money.  When did the almighty dollar become the most important<br/>
&gt; thing in life.  Doesn&#39;t seem to make Donald Trump, Demi Moore, Bill Gates or<br/>
&gt; anyone else who has buckets of it, very happy.  I believe you can have both<br/>
&gt; the stimulation of working with adults and children if you do what it is you<br/>
&gt; love and turn it into a career that you fit around your family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of my clients asked me last night about having more children and I asked<br/>
&gt; her &quot;what would be the point?  You already have an 8 yr old and 5 yrd old<br/>
&gt; that dumped in daycare at 6 weeks and you went back to corporate america, so<br/>
&gt; how would having anymore benefit that child?&quot;  She said she&#39;d never thought<br/>
&gt; about it that way.... (Daycare is a big issue for me)..<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway that&#39;s enough rambling for me... It&#39;s thunder and lightening at 5:30am<br/>
&gt; here in Tucson and here I am with my cup of tea knowing that all my boys<br/>
&gt; (including hubbie) are safely asleep in their beds.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;Just want to say Karen, that I really respect you and all the other<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;moms/dads who have given up a second income to be home raising your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;kids!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Thanks  :-)  I&#39;m one of those.  I was making over $10 an hour full time and<br/>
&gt; &gt;had full benefits and Employee Stock Ownership and was soon to be vested in<br/>
&gt; &gt;the 401K.  But I quit when I was 8 months pregnant with my first, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt;always knew that I would, for my children.  Luckily my husband was able to<br/>
&gt; &gt;support us, also had investment and benefits, and enjoyed his work a great<br/>
&gt; &gt;deal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;It was a natural choice and a very easy one.  I sometimes regretted the<br/>
&gt; &gt;loss of working friends and getting out of the house, etc, but it was just<br/>
&gt; &gt;a lifestyle change that required an adjustment for me.  I am happily<br/>
&gt; &gt;adjusted now.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Why are we so often pressured by society that we don&#39;t measure up and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;aren&#39;t real women if we prefer the domestic life and make our children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;our priority?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I agree.  My parents are especially bad about this.  I have 4 sisters, and<br/>
&gt; &gt;they are all working professionals.  One is an Engineer at NASA, one is a<br/>
&gt; &gt;Doctor (Surgeon), One is a Para-Legal, and One is an Environmental<br/>
&gt; &gt;Engineer.  Three of them are mothers, and their children were in daycare<br/>
&gt; &gt;from almost the first day they were home.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am the family &quot;Faliure&quot; because I didn&#39;t finish college with a degree and<br/>
&gt; &gt;I didn&#39;t choose a high status, high priority career over my family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839805556">Unfortunately, the so-called &#39;feminist&#39; movement decided that <br/>
&#39;equailty&#39; meant everyone equal, but masculine :-(  Doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
very &#39;feminine&#39; to me...  I&#39;ve never been that good at making <br/>
friends and keeping in touch with folk, but at least I&#39;ve made more <br/>
contact with like-minded people since having babies, LLL and <br/>
home-ed groups are great! &lt;g&gt;  I have to admit, too, to giving off <br/>
&#39;attitude&#39; to people who choose to have children when they know <br/>
others will be raising them, but I must be getting mellow...<br/>

Our story is somewhat similar to Dawn&#39;s, though we &quot;downsized&quot;.  I was 80-hour a<br/>
week publishing executive, and my wife&#39;s schedule was not much better.  We lived<br/>
in Santa Cruz, California, where housing prices were impossible (and the quality<br/>
of life not as high as one might expect.)  We both recareered, moved to Olympia,<br/>
Washington, where we could have bought 3 houses for the price of one in Santa<br/>
Cruz (but we only bought one little one) -- my wife went back to school to become<br/>
a massage therapist, and we attached an office to the house.  I started working<br/>
for the Governor and the state board of health on the strength of my writing<br/>
skills (had no background whatsoever.  I work within 5 minutes of home, and get<br/>
home for lunch everyday, and NEVER work more than 40 hours a week.<br/>
<br/>
Our quality of life as a family soared, we have lots of time with our kids, and,<br/>
oddly enough, our available income went up even as that reported on our tax<br/>
returns went down.<br/>

&gt; I must admit there are some days when I think about getting a job and a<br/>
&gt; nanny.  Then I stop and think about what it was like working.<br/>
&gt; Some things are priceless and sharing my children&#39;s lives is one of them.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Why are we so often pressured by society that we don&#39;t measure up and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; &gt; &gt;aren&#39;t real women if we prefer the domestic life and make our children<br/>
 &gt; &gt; &gt;our priority?<br/>
 &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree and think it&#39;s really sad that our culture has come to this where <br/>
making money is such a priority compared to raising children.  I think the <br/>
feminist movement has done so much harm to children.  I have so many clients <br/>
who ask me questions about their careers and when they are giving me bith <br/>
information about their kids, many of their kids are under 4 years old.  So <br/>
we all know where they are everyday from 6am-7pm...<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m different in the way that I never wanted to be the stay at home <br/>
mum.  I was always the career woman and had children because my husband <br/>
wanted them.  However, not that I have them, I cannot imagine leaving them <br/>
with anyone (save my mother for a couple of hours).  I went and got my hair <br/>
cut yesterday and I have a mother&#39;s helper (she&#39;s 16) who comes one afternoon <br/>
a week for 3 hours.  I&#39;m here as well usually, but it gives me the ability to <br/>
catch up on my filing and phone calls in the daytime, make dinner without <br/>
having to stop and paint or build something etc and Zak loves to play with <br/>
her.  I was late in getting back from the hairdressers and so she was here on <br/>
her own (hubby had gone back to work) for 30 mins and I felt guilty as hell.  <br/>
Now she&#39;s been with us for over 1 year, since before Max was born and <br/>
consistently comes every week and my guilt was rushing in.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway just some feedback here at 5:16am in the morning, just before I&#39;m off <br/>
to walk 3 miles with my friend before it gets up to 100 degrees.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032806095">you might want to try soy &quot;nut&quot; butter. It&#39;s 100% nut free, but tastes just<br/>
like peanut butter. I have 2 w/peanut allergies (1 life threatening) and<br/>
they do fine w/it. You can find it at Trader Joes and other supermarkets.<br/>
