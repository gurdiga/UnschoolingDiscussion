<div id="ygrps-yiv-400548386">Take a look at John Goldhammer&#39;s book: &quot;Under the Influence: The Destructive<br/>
Effects of Group Dynamics.&quot;  It&#39;s very much on the topic of what I describe<br/>
as &quot;teamplayermania.&quot;  There is also a related book called &quot;Corporate Cults&quot;<br/>
by Dave Arnott.<br/>
<br/>
Goldhammer&#39;s book is filled with interesting quotes at the beginning of<br/>
chapters and subchapters.  Here is one from Erich Fromm:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The danger of the past was that men became slaves.  The danger of the<br/>
future is that men may become robots.  True enough, robots do not rebel.<br/>
But given man&#39;s nature, robots cannot live and remain sane, they become<br/>
&quot;Golems,&quot; they will destroy their world and themselves because they cannot<br/>
stand any longer the boredom of a meaningless life.<br/>
<br/>

Usually it&#39;s easier to be a &quot;success&quot; than to be a human.</div>
