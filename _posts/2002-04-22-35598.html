<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894588794">Tia - I don&#39;t know why but reading this letter that you wrote to your son<br/>
just made me cry.<br/>
What a very sweet mom you are!<br/>
I hope it makes him feel better about himself and his future.<br/>
I think every kid deserves a loving, supporting letter like this at some<br/>
point, from their parents.<br/>
Thanks for sharing it with us.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I&#39;m the one who convinced him that he was &quot;behind&quot; and needing to be<br/>
&gt; &quot;caught up&quot;. . . sigh.  Since he&#39;s a kid who doesn&#39;t like to give much<br/>
&gt; feedback during a conversation, I&#39;ve written him a letter.  I gave it to<br/>
&gt; him last night, and so far he hasn&#39;t said anything about it.  That&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>pretty<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; normal for him.  He tends to like to think about things for a while.  This<br/>
&gt; is what I wrote to him.  Maybe it will give you some ideas.  Maybe someone<br/>
&gt; will have more ideas for me.  Who knows.<br/>
&gt; ****************************************************************<br/>
&gt; I want to explore this desire you have to get &quot;caught up&quot;. I wonder if you<br/>
&gt; believe what the school system believes, that kids are empty vessels who<br/>
&gt; need certain kinds of knowledge poured into them.  They have to be made to<br/>
&gt; learn things because learning isn&#39;t any fun.  Well Dad and I don&#39;t believe<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s true.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve watched you absorb knowledge like a sponge since you were<br/>
&gt; little.  You probably didn&#39;t realize you were learning things because it<br/>
&gt; was so easy to do.  When you were in preschool, I realized that the other<br/>
&gt; kids knew the colours, and you didn&#39;t.  I made a mental note to play some<br/>
&gt; colour games or something with you but didn&#39;t get around to it.  A couple<br/>
&gt; of months later, I noticed that you knew the colours.  It&#39;s been like that<br/>
&gt; with all kinds of things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You still amaze me with your ability to do mental math.  You&#39;re way better<br/>
&gt; than I am at that. I know that you have more trouble with written-down<br/>
&gt; math, but most kids do at first.  It&#39;s just a different skill that you can<br/>
&gt; learn when you need it.  In fact, I&#39;ll bet you could just start right now<br/>
<br/>
&gt; with, say, algebra, and work your way through any gaps in your math<br/>
&gt; knowledge as you learned it.  (You couldn&#39;t do that in school because the<br/>
&gt; class would be moving too fast.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That brings me to purpose for learning.  You seem to have little trouble<br/>
&gt; finding out what you want to know about bikes and riding.  You watch.  You<br/>
&gt; ask.  You read your magazines.  You read web pages.  You have a purpose,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you learn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The kids in school have a purpose for learning the stuff they learn.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; called grades, and it&#39;s totally artificial.  Grades don&#39;t even show what<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve actually learned.  They&#39;re just an average of all the scores you<br/>
 </span></blockquote>get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on homework and tests in a class.  You can sort of learn everything that&#39;s<br/>
&gt; offered in a course and get a C.  You can also be really good at part of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; while not understanding the rest at all, and you&#39;ll still probably get a<br/>
&gt; C.  You can ask your brother or sisters how much of it you&#39;d remember next<br/>
&gt; year, or even next week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We follow a different philosophy of learning.  It&#39;s called<br/>
&gt; unschooling.  Some people call it real learning.  Real learning is wanting<br/>
&gt; to know something, finding the answers, and enjoying the process.  You<br/>
&gt; actually do that all the time, though you haven&#39;t done it much so far in<br/>
&gt; the academic areas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the reason you want to get caught up is that you are concerned about<br/>
&gt; your future, we can work with that. The first thing to do is think about<br/>
&gt; your strengths. What are you good at? I&#39;ve started a separate list for<br/>
&gt; that, which we can add to. Then you think about what you like doing. Once<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve thought about what you&#39;re good at and like doing, then we can help<br/>
&gt; you start thinking about your goals. You take what you like and are good<br/>
&gt; at, and explore careers that use those strengths and interests.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The next step is to figure out what you need to do in order get started in<br/>
&gt; that career. If there&#39;s an academic requirement, we can help you meet it.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s only at that point that you need to be concerned with &quot;catching up&quot;<br/>
&gt; and then only in the areas that you&#39;re going to need.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What about university or technical school? Don&#39;t assume that graduating<br/>
&gt; from high school and going on to university is a good way into a career.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; rarely is. If you want to be a doctor or lawyer or veterinarian or<br/>
&gt; something like that, you&#39;d need university (and a lot more). But there are<br/>
&gt; lots of university grads who still don&#39;t know what they want to be when<br/>
&gt; they grow up. A lot of them are flipping burgers to pay off their student<br/>
&gt; loans. University is expensive. And for a person who doesn&#39;t use reading<br/>
&gt; and writing as their preferred way of learning, it can be painful.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; sure you could do it if it was your only path into your chosen career, but<br/>
&gt; there are probably ways that would work better for you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are lots of jobs that pay well that don&#39;t involve university.<br/>
&gt; Electricians, plumbers, welders, sound technicians, for instance. Those<br/>
&gt; usually involve a short college course and then maybe an apprenticeship.<br/>
&gt; You get paid during an apprenticeship, and you learn by doing. The book<br/>
&gt; learning is minimal for those kinds of jobs. They are also physical jobs,<br/>
&gt; which you seem to lean toward. I know you don&#39;t want to plant trees for a<br/>
&gt; living, but there are physical jobs that aren&#39;t so hard on your body and<br/>
&gt; pay better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You also have a very good business sense that could be developed if you<br/>
&gt; chose to start your own business. I could see you opening a bike store one<br/>
&gt; day or running eco tours. (Taking groups of people mountain bike camping,<br/>
&gt; for instance.) I could see you building furniture or houses or . . .  Once<br/>
&gt; you really start exploring your strengths and interests, you&#39;ll be able to<br/>
&gt; think of lots of ideas. We can help you figure out how to make your dreams<br/>
&gt; come true, but you have to find the dreams.<br/>
