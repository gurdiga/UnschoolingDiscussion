<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199390466">We have a policy of asking those who join the list to read for a couple of <br/>
weeks to get a feel for the tone and opinions and all.     Someone who waited <br/>
over a week has asked the following question.   I&#39;ve removed names and am just <br/>
bringing the raw questions. <br/>
<br/>
A whole week has passed without us discussing such things!?   Yeah, it&#39;s <br/>
summer, but unschooling doesn&#39;t stop for the summer.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
What links and resources and responses are good for people with such <br/>
questions?   Have at it:<br/>
<br/>
====================================================<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for all the seasoned unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
How do you get your kids to do things they hate but need, like Algebra or<br/>
Biology? I have a high school junior who only does Algebra when I make her<br/>
and only does Biology if you count watching Animal Planet. She never writes<br/>
a sentence. No journal, no letters, heck she doesn&#39;t even IM or e-mail<br/>
people. She play a computer game or watches cartoon all day every day. My<br/>
son is following her lead. He&#39;s 11 and can&#39;t say his times tables up to 5.<br/>
What am I doing wrong? My children have zero curiosity about anything. I<br/>
even took all electronic gadgets away from them for two weeks hoping boredom<br/>
would make them pick up a book or go outside and explore something, nope,<br/>
they slept or fought until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
HELP,,,,,, PLEASE<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; HELP,,,,,, PLEASE<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First question: have they always been unschooled or are they <br/>
recently removed from institutional schooling or school-at-home? My <br/>
guess is they have been &quot;schooling&quot; in some form until now (or <br/>
pretty recently) since you &quot;define&quot; your DD as a &quot;high school <br/>
junior&quot; instead of a 16 yr old (or whatever age she is).<br/>
<br/>
Next question: why is algebra or biology (or whatever) right now <br/>
important to -you-? Is it anything she can&#39;t do next week, next <br/>
year, 5 yrs from now? Does her brain have an &quot;expiration date&quot; when <br/>
no new learning can occur? Odds are, you&#39;re racing (mentally) to <br/>
when she gets to be 18 and goes to college and... but reality is she <br/>
*may* choose to postpone college and work. I&#39;ve got a BS degree and <br/>
I&#39;ve been in the &quot;career world&quot; for 20+ years and I&#39;ve *never* used <br/>
my high school biology (except maybe playing trivia games and such) <br/>
and with a business/IS degree, didn&#39;t need much science in college <br/>
either (I can&#39;t remember ever taking a science course - maybe I did, <br/>
maybe I didn&#39;t, either way it means little if I can&#39;t remember it). <br/>
My DH went right from public high school to work - started with <br/>
stock boy and mailroom clerk type jobs through managing 2 or 3 <br/>
people in a &#39;shop&#39; environment for an office supply company to doing <br/>
high tech work at software companies(phone support, web design, <br/>
etc). A decade after high school, he choose to start college (as a <br/>
freshman) and tested out (via the CLEP tests) of ALL the 101 <br/>
science, math, history, fine arts, and English courses - for a <br/>
little $ and a few hours of testing he ended up as a 2nd semester <br/>
sophomore after 1 semester of classwork. He said he knew most of the <br/>
stuff on the tests from living life and from watching Jeopardy and <br/>
playing Trivial Pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
Odds are taking away the electronics then giving them back has led <br/>
to them spending MORE time on electronics just in case they get <br/>
taken away again (just guessing).<br/>
<br/>
How do you know they have &quot;zero curiosity about anything&quot;? They <br/>
probably do - it&#39;s just not formed, communicated, packaged into <br/>
something that looks like a school subject. What are they watching? <br/>
What games are they playing? Have you sat with them and watched? <br/>
Asked about it (with TRUE interest) - what they are doing? what they <br/>
like? what they don&#39;t like? (most gamers have ideas about &#39;how I <br/>
would do it differently&#39; as well as &#39;this is a really cool part&#39;). <br/>
Do you interact with them - bringing snacks perhaps, folding laundry <br/>
in the same room, *be*ing together? <br/>
<br/>
Take a &#39;vacation&#39; from &#39;school&#39; thoughts and go do something fun for <br/>
yourself, ask what they might want to do that&#39;s fun (no fair <br/>
limiting things to &#39;educational&#39;) - a day at the skateboard park? a <br/>
trip to the store for a new game? a matinee movie? a picnic in the <br/>
living room? a whole day without mom hovering over them with a <br/>
worried look?<br/>

====================================================<br/>
<br/>
I have a question for all the seasoned unschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
How do you get your kids to do things they hate but need, like Algebra <br/>
or<br/>
Biology? I have a high school junior who only does Algebra when I make <br/>

and only does Biology if you count watching Animal Planet. She never <br/>
writes<br/>
a sentence. No journal, no letters, heck she doesn&#39;t even IM or e-mail<br/>
people. She play a computer game or watches cartoon all day every day. <br/>
My<br/>
son is following her lead. He&#39;s 11 and can&#39;t say his times tables up to <br/>
5.<br/>
What am I doing wrong? My children have zero curiosity about anything. I<br/>
even took all electronic gadgets away from them for two weeks hoping <br/>
boredom<br/>
would make them pick up a book or go outside and explore something, <br/>
nope,<br/>
they slept or fought until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, I think that my boys KNOW what they need. And because they&#39;ve not <br/>
learned any different, they don&#39;t even know to hate some things.<br/>
<br/>
Well, Cameron (17 and schooled for nine years) DID, but he&#39;s all healed <br/>
now and enjoys many different things---but that took time and patience.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, we don&#39;t divide the world into subjects. Biology IS <br/>
algebra ID hstory IS language IS art. It&#39;s all related and <br/>
inter-related. My boys don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; algebra or biology, but those things <br/>
are huge parts of their lives because we see them in every day things. <br/>
Caring for our dogs and cats and rabbit and rats and bees---not to <br/>
mention ourSELVES!---IS biology. So&#39;s caring for our garden and <br/>
houseplants and the wild birds that we&#39;ve really grown to know and <br/>
love. Cooking and grocery shopping is biology. Our visits to the doctor <br/>
this summer for strep and a bad reaction to a bee sting qualify as <br/>
biology too. We stopped to look at the armadillo on the side of the <br/>
road---armadillos are NOT local! We don&#39;t know how he got here! <br/>
Biology! Cooking a mushroom soufflee tonight for Ben&#39;s little Tour de <br/>
France party is biology. Watching all this rainfall and the jungle it&#39;s <br/>
turned our yard into----and keeping track of hurricanes that were <br/>
threatening our friends&#39; homes---uh huh---that too!<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know how my boys could avoid biology in their lives. <br/>
Seriously! And Animal Planet is FULL of biology! Duncan has collected <br/>
sooo much info from that channel! Things even I didn&#39;t know! Don&#39;t <br/>
under-estimate that!<br/>
<br/>
As for algebra: what&#39;s that line you use, Sandra? Why do we need to <br/>
study algebra? Because it&#39;s part of our every day world? Well, then we <br/>
don&#39;t need to set up artificial algebra because it&#39;s naturally a part <br/>
of our every day world! If it weren&#39;t part of our world, why study it? <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt; We use algebra every day. It&#39;s simply figuring &quot;x&quot;---a variable. <br/>
I use variables to do almost everything! So do the boys. In almost <br/>
everything we do there&#39;s a variable! How we deal with that variable <br/>
proves how well we understand it. That&#39;s why schools use word problems! <br/>
Because we use them in real life every day! &lt;g&gt; The formula is EASY <br/>
after you understand the principle of variables!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Duncan (9) knows what the times tables are, but he knows <br/>
what eight sixes are---and thirteen sevens. He can figure it out <br/>
probably *because* he isn&#39;t familiar with the times tables. He&#39;s <br/>
figured his own algorithms. Don&#39;t ask me how. I&#39;m still in the dark, <br/>
depending on my times tables! or my fingers. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t refer to my children as &quot;students&quot;---they are nine and 17. <br/>
Haven&#39;t you heard? Grades are for meat and eggs, not children! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How much writing do mine do? Very little, I guess. But what they DO <br/>
write is essential and meaningful. They can both write thank you notes. <br/>
They can write grocery lists. Cameron writes love letters to Carly and <br/>
keeps a sporadic journal. Duncan dictates wild, fun stories; he keeps a <br/>
journal too, but it&#39;s become filled more with artwork than words <br/>
lately. The big differnce here is that none of these things are <br/>
required, expected, or forced. They do these things because they are <br/>
important to my boys. Their writing has meaning to *them*.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t discount cartoons either!!! Duncan&#39;s vocabulary is HUGE because <br/>
of cartoons! First, with Ed, Edd, & Eddie---he learned many words that <br/>
most six-year-olds don&#39;t know! &lt;g&gt; Now, his favorites are: The <br/>
Simpsons, South Park, Futurama, and Family Guy. Because these are <br/>
soooooo incredibly current and in-your-face--and rather *adult*, we&#39;ve <br/>
had all SORTS of discussions about all KINDS of topics---some which <br/>
many may not considder appropriate for a nine-year-old. But we talk a <br/>
LOT, and I answer many, many questions. And I LOVE TiVO!!! It makes <br/>
discussions of these shows so much easier!<br/>
<br/>
Do you watch TV *with* them??? That makes a difference! Mine have so <br/>
many questions---and I know what interests them and how certain things <br/>
make them feel. Cameron is into That 70&#39;s Show. Hell, I LIVED That 70&#39;s <br/>
Show! &lt;g&gt; So that has brought up a lot of subjects and the history <br/>
(ugh!&lt;g&gt;) of my childhood!<br/>
<br/>
The boys often join me and Ben while we&#39;re watching the Tour de France. <br/>
Cool things there to learn! History, geography, geometry, physics, <br/>
nutrition, statistics, sportmanship,...ALGEBRA! &lt;g&gt; All inter-related <br/>
in a bike race!<br/>
<br/>
Are YOU fascinating? Are YOU curious? What do YOU do during the day? <br/>
Maybe they&#39;re simply following *your* lead and modelling *your* <br/>
behavior. I was recently described as a shark---if I stop moving, I&#39;ll <br/>
die! &lt;g&gt; I model that for my boys. Cameron is a bit more busy than <br/>
Duncan. But he&#39;s 17 and has wheels! And four jobs, a girlfriend, and a <br/>
band. For all of their lives, they&#39;ve watched me be in &quot;into&quot; a zillion <br/>
things. I have a friend who is very sedentary: I really don&#39;t think she <br/>
should expect much more from her kids. Mine see &quot;busy&quot; and interested <br/>
and interesting as normal.<br/>
<br/>
As for taking away their entertainment---that&#39;s just mean. I would <br/>
become angry and resentful if you did that to me. So---after you did <br/>
that, what did you offer them? To go out for Japanese food for lunch? A <br/>
trip to the beach with a picnic? To tie-dye shirts and sheets? Did you <br/>
toss a pork shoulder into the oven and have each of you make up <br/>
personal BBQ sauces? Did you do to Lowe&#39;s and pick out a new color of <br/>
paint to re-do their rooms? (That&#39;s also a sure-fire way to get a room <br/>
clean! My room is next on our list! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that you just left them to do nothing and expected them to <br/>
produce. Anger. Resentment. Fighting. Yep.<br/>
<br/>
BE interesting! BE interested! BE curious! BE fascinating! BE *with* <br/>
them! DO *with* them! You don&#39;t get another chance! You&#39;re going to <br/>
miss them when they&#39;re gone! Have FUN....NOW!!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and come to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference near St <br/>
Louis October 6-9, 2005 and watch other unschoolers in action. Let them <br/>
see what they&#39;re missing. Let yourSELF see it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1827093978">**I&#39;ve been in the &quot;career world&quot; for 20+ years and I&#39;ve *never* used <br/>
my high school biology **<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I had a well-paid job in engineering for 12 years, and never took Biology in high school or college. Weird story, as I took &quot;science&quot; every year in high school.  But I moved back and forth from my dad to my mom and my dad moved, so I went to three different high schools.  When I was a sophmore my science class for the year was Health and Drivers Ed.  Students at that school took Biology as Juniors.  By the time I was a Junior, I was at a different school where Juniors took Chemistry, so I did.<br/>
<br/>
Someday I may want to learn Biology, for my own satisfaction, or a future career, but I figure the field has changed amazingly since 1975, and some of the &quot;facts&quot; will be different now.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; She play a computer game or watches cartoon all day every<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d encourage the computer game - learn something about it - find other <br/>
games that are similar - find out if there are online multiplayer <br/>
versions - make connections to the game - spinoff movies? . Maybe see <br/>
if there are any video game conventions around that she&#39;d enjoy - plan <br/>
a trip. SUPPORT her interests and broaden her horizons by building off <br/>
of her interests.<br/>
<br/>
(Parents need to read the video game section of Sandra&#39;s website.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cartoons - this is just TOO easy. Watch them with her, first of all. <br/>
Talk about them. Cartoons are filled with allusions to all kinds of <br/>
history and geography and sociology and often politics, too. Notice <br/>
which cartoons she seems to enjoy - learn about those a bit so you can <br/>
share a little information. RENT cartoons - get into them. Expand the <br/>
interest in cartoons to include all kinds of animated stuff -- have you <br/>
see Spirited Away? It is incredible! Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service, too. <br/>
Watch The Simpsons and King of the Hill and Futurama -- all animated - <br/>
all FILLED with social commentary, horizon-broadening material.<br/>
<br/>
AND - plan a vacation to Los Angeles or New York to visit the Museum of <br/>
Television and Radio -- you can visit Nickelodeon Studios, Disney <br/>
Studios, etc.<br/>
<br/>
AND - once you start supporting your kids - be FLEXIBLE - don&#39;t get <br/>
your heart set on them being fascinated by cartoons and animation, it <br/>
might turn out that they&#39;re not at all interested. It might turn out <br/>
that while you&#39;re in the middle of planning that trip, looking at <br/>
information about Los Angeles, that they get excited about, say, <br/>
amusement parks, or the beach, or Hollywood, or whatever -- so GO with <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
But -- I&#39;m cringing thinking that they&#39;re probably seeing their choices <br/>
as veg out in front of the tv versus do algebra or biology or memorize <br/>
times tables.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a concrete example would be good --<br/>
<br/>
Kids are watching cartoons - you sit down and watch with them. Say <br/>
they&#39;re watching Yogi Bear &lt;G&gt;. You say, &quot;You know Jellystone Park is <br/>
really based on Yellowstone Park - we should go there someday.&quot;  Or you <br/>
say, &quot;I went to Yellowstone Park once - and the bears were all lined up <br/>
along the road into the park, begging for food. Some people actually <br/>
lowered their car windows and handed them food.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all. Unless it just happens that you see a spark of interest - <br/>
or unless one of the kids asks a question - or unless you think they&#39;d <br/>
be INTERESTED in knowing about the geysers there. And so if you tell <br/>
them about Old Faithful -- you can wonder out loud if any of that <br/>
geothermal energy is being used to make electricity.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to RESEARCH all this - and you don&#39;t have to say what I <br/>
just said. And you don&#39;t have to go get them a book on Yellowstone to <br/>
read or build a model of a geyser out of papier-mache, or explain to <br/>
them how geothermal energy is used to make electricity or anything else <br/>
- you can just allude to things - just mention little bits of related <br/>
&quot;trivia&quot; that you might happen to know and think of while watching <br/>
cartoons with your kids. BUT don&#39;t interrupt the cartoons - I mean <br/>
don&#39;t be annoying.<br/>
<br/>
You have to judge how much to say, how far to take things.<br/>
<br/>
But the point is that it really truly doesn&#39;t matter WHAT the kids are <br/>
into - watching tv and playing computer games is fine! It is how well <br/>
the parents are able to create a rich environment that supports and <br/>
expands on and respects and builds on the kids&#39; interests that makes <br/>
for a great unschooling life.<br/>
<br/>
Or - think about other aspects of life. They do EAT right? So - bring <br/>
home something unusual from the grocery store. &quot;Look at this, guys! It <br/>
is a fruit from south america that I&#39;ve never had before.&quot; They don&#39;t <br/>
have to TASTE it - just introduce it to them. Now they know that there <br/>
are things in the grocery store they didn&#39;t know about before, that <br/>
fruit might come from South America and that the US imports food.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I saw a guy on the street corner selling coconuts - he&#39;d <br/>
drilled a hole in them and there was a straw sticking out. I should <br/>
stop and buy one and bring it home. And I should just mention that a <br/>
coconut is grass seed. And we should talk about where they guy on the <br/>
street corner got it and why he&#39;s selling them on the street corner and <br/>
that when I was growing up NOBODY sold anything on street corners.<br/>
<br/>
Or not.  If we&#39;re in the middle of a fascinating conversation about <br/>
fashion or cartoons or something else, I might not want to interrupt <br/>
that with stopping to buy a coconut right then.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - but, for kids interested in cartoons, maybe get started watching <br/>
all the Disney movies! Plan a trip to Disneyland and go to California <br/>
Adventure where they have a huge Animation area - with lots of <br/>
activities related to making animated movies. And, at Disneyland, go <br/>
into the little theater that shows the very earliest silent cartoons <br/>
with Steamboat Willie and so on. It is great.<br/>
<br/>
I just sounds like mom is not doing HER job as an unschooling parent - <br/>
like she&#39;s waiting around for the kids to get tired of tv and say, <br/>
&quot;Mom, I want an algebra book.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
THAT can happen - it happened at my house. But only when algebra was <br/>
something that came up in the swirl of everything else, just one more <br/>
really interesting thing along with cartoons and video games.<br/>

I think the best part is framing things so a 6<br/>

<br/>
I think you may be confused about what unschooling is.   It&#39;s not a<br/>
method of schooling at home.   I recommend you read the introduction to<br/>
this list which briefly explains unschooling.  Read at<br/>
www.sandradodd.com/unschooling  and read at www.unschooling.info   you<br/>
can read the message boards and a collection of articles and posts.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not schooling.  Unschoolers don&#39;t school their children at<br/>
home.  Unschoolers believe learning is a natural part of living life. <br/>
Unschoolers  provide their children with an interesting environment and<br/>
interesting opportunities and do not make their children study formal<br/>
academics.<br/>
<br/>
***How do you get your kids to do things they hate but need, like Algebra<br/>
or<br/>
Biology? ***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m forty two and can&#39;t recall the last time I *needed* algebra or<br/>
biology.  I believe the only person qualified to determine what my son<br/>
needs (and what he will need in the future) is my son.  I came to believe<br/>
this after examining my own schooling and after talking with many people<br/>
who went to school and after reading for years about school, learning and<br/>
unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
So I would not try to get my kid to do something he hated.  I think<br/>
that&#39;s an unhealthy practice.  There are probably a lot of reasons people<br/>
become full of hate and being forced to do what one doesn&#39;t want to is a<br/>
big one.   <br/>
<br/>
***She never writes a sentence. No journal, no letters, heck she doesn&#39;t<br/>
even IM or e-mail<br/>
people.***<br/>
<br/>
Neither does my husband.  He never learned to type and e-mail and IM<br/>
don&#39;t interest him.  We got a microphone for our computer and he can IM<br/>
his sister in Germany via voice.   My husband can write, he just rarely<br/>
has a reason to.  His job requires little writing.  He has a good life in<br/>
spite of not keeping a journal, not writing letters.   He knows the<br/>
secret.  Talk! Telephone!<br/>
<br/>
***She play a computer game or watches cartoon all day every day.***<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s doing those things because she&#39;s interested in them then she&#39;s<br/>
doing fine.  If she&#39;s doing them because they&#39;re the best things<br/>
available right now, make more things available.  Go places, experience<br/>
new things, get busy. <br/>
<br/>
***My son is following her lead. He&#39;s 11 and can&#39;t say his times tables<br/>
up to 5.***<br/>
<br/>
Neither can I and since leaving school I&#39;ve never been required to do so.<br/>
 Not once has my life been in jeopardy nor my fiendish plans foiled<br/>
because I couldn&#39;t recite times tables.   My son is thirteen and cannot<br/>
recite the multiplication tables.  He has never needed to.  The only time<br/>
people ever have to do that is in school.  If your children are not in<br/>
school, forget about memorizing multiplication tables.   My son can<br/>
multiply though and keeps score in cribbage and other games where<br/>
multiplication is the fastest way to confirm he&#39;s winning. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
***What am I doing wrong?***<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re thinking like school.  You don&#39;t have to think like school when<br/>
you&#39;re kids are home.  Live like you never heard of school.   Do things<br/>
with your kids, enjoy them, make life interesting. <br/>
<br/>
***My children have zero curiosity about anything. ***<br/>
<br/>
You just told us they like video games and cartoons.   Do you mean<br/>
they&#39;re not curious about things you&#39;d like them to be curious about? <br/>
It&#39;s not the same thing.   My son is not at all interested in algebra but<br/>
he is interested in movies and cartoons, WWII, insects, fine art,<br/>
animals, driving, hiking, music, cooking...<br/>
<br/>
***I even took all electronic gadgets away from them for two weeks hoping<br/>
boredom<br/>
would make them pick up a book or go outside and explore something, nope,<br/>
they slept or fought until I couldn&#39;t take it anymore.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be pretty angry if someone took away the things I really liked.  I<br/>
think your kids responded in a normal way when they tried to escape a sad<br/>
and dull period in life with sleep and I think you&#39;re lucky they didn&#39;t<br/>
try to escape with something else.   <br/>
<br/>
You wanted their world to be bigger so you made it smaller.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>
make any sense at all.  <br/>
People are rarely inspired by punishment.  If you&#39;d like them to have a<br/>
broader world provide more, not less.  Be inspiring.   <br/>

<br/>
I use algebra and biology almost daily, but I didn&#39;t learn any of it until after I graduated high school.  Some of it I learned in college, some in job training courses, most on my own just because I liked it.  I am great at calculus, algebra, geometry, etc, but I am terrible at arithmetic.  I don&#39;t think I remember most of the times tables.  My son though, is great at it.  He plays YuGiOh a lot and keeps score, it gets pretty complicated.  He figures out things in his head that I have to pull out a calculator to do.  If they need it they will learn it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102026244">My initial response was really snarky, but I have toned it back (I hope)....<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;How do you get your kids to do things they hate&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t generally - but I am shortly going to post about a medical situation<br/>
that has stretched our commitment to respectful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; but need, like Algebra or<br/>
Biology?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t (yet) or they would seek to discover it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have a high school junior who only does Algebra when I make her&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then she is learning: that you can make her do stuff she hates, and since<br/>
you are making her then it must be difficult or dull stuff she should hate,<br/>
so she may never not hate it. <br/>
<br/>
This unfortunate logic can extend to all sorts of &quot;subjects&quot; that you feel<br/>
called to impose, some of which may actually be more useful to most people<br/>
than Algebra. BTW if she already gets the concepts she doesn&#39;t need to<br/>
continue to explore it unless she really digs it for reasons of her own.<br/>
&quot;It&quot; can be anything. Forced drill detracts from anyone&#39;s ability to get the<br/>
concepts.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;and only does Biology if you count watching Animal Planet.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It would count *if* I were keeping score, which I am freed of by living in a<br/>
non-assessing State. But who is choosing that channel? You, because you are<br/>
in an &quot;at least this is educational&quot; mindset, or her because she genuinely<br/>
likes the programming.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She never writes<br/>
a sentence. No journal, no letters, heck she doesn&#39;t even IM or e-mail<br/>
people.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
All of these are essentially private or personal communications. Maybe she<br/>
doesn&#39;t because she fears she would be required to share them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; She play a computer game or watches cartoon all day every day. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Envious? <br/>
<br/>
Seriously though, it sounds like a fairly typical deschooling process<br/>
continuing. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My son is following her lead.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
How nice for you to have siblings who like each other. How nice for a<br/>
younger boy to admire his big sister. How nice for them to have shared<br/>
interests.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; He&#39;s 11 and can&#39;t say his times tables up to 5.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is magic about the number 5 in this context? I suggest a calculator if<br/>
he is wanting to do math - and for you: patience while he plays computer<br/>
games and one day suddenly &quot;gets&quot; the usefulness of multiplication.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What am I doing wrong? My children have zero curiosity about<br/>
anything.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Judging your children and seeing them in negative terms.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing the world through a schoolish lens - expecting curiosity to manifest<br/>
in schoolish looking ways.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I even took all electronic gadgets away from them &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Another answer to your last question.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; for two weeks &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is special about 2 weeks? All this has done is insert a giant snake<br/>
into the snakes and ladders game that is deschooling. 2 weeks to remove any<br/>
trust and empathy that you may have built up with each other.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; hoping boredom &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about facilitating what your children want to do and how they<br/>
want to spend their time, not placing barriers in their way.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;would make them&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t try to &quot;make&quot; my dd do activities, either coercively or through<br/>
subtle manipulation.<br/>
<br/>
Something that occurs to me here is that while ever you are living in this<br/>
judgmental headspace, it will be tough for you to let go of control as a<br/>
broader paradigm. For example now you want them to &quot;pick up a book&quot;. Suppose<br/>
they start to do so. The next phase for a controller is to start judging the<br/>
quality, or worthiness, or educational value of the books they are choosing.<br/>
There will always be something else to want to take control of. <br/>
<br/>
Without exploring the wider idea of Trust and examining the way people learn<br/>
best, in other words researching Unschooling more, it will be tough to let<br/>
go of the fears in your mind and heart that are prompting a desire to manage<br/>
and control. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; pick up a book or go outside and explore something &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They were exploring the computer games. They were exploring Popular Culture<br/>
via the TV. <br/>
<br/>
How hot and glaringly sunny or muggy or dry is it outside in your town? How<br/>
much time did you spend engaging in your own interests outside, or exploring<br/>
new ones while they were both pleasantly occupied on the computer?<br/>
<br/>
If you want them to get outside, one good way is to be so interesting to<br/>
them, and for what you are doing outside to be so interesting, that they<br/>
choose to spend time with you there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; they slept &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They may have needed the escape time for uninterrupted dreaming and mental<br/>
consolidation - or a kind of personal rebellion and withdrawal. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; or fought &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is one of the most unfortunate parts of the experience. The friendly<br/>
relationship that they apparently had before has been eroded a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Fortunately these setbacks can all temporary. You could start by apologizing<br/>
for not trusting them and trying to take back control of their time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HELP,,,,,, PLEASE &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My best suggestion concurs with some others that you have received which is<br/>
to focus on your own learning, your own attitudes and your own actions and<br/>
to research more about Unschooling and think about your goals. The goal of<br/>
Unschooling is not an education that resembles a High School transcript or<br/>
even covers the usual curriculum but via a different route. The goal, or I<br/>
should say one of the main goals, of Unschooling is to create an enhanced,<br/>
close relationship between us and our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Suppose you spend the next month reading all you can about Unschooling, from<br/>
positive rather than critical sources, and just let your kids spend their<br/>
time as they wish without making suggestions to them. Even if at the end of<br/>
that you are not convinced that it is a great lifestyle, all you have &quot;lost&quot;<br/>
is a month over the summer. <br/>

Algebra  &lt;snip&gt; She play a computer game==<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already gotten great responses to this, so I&#39;ll just point this<br/>
out.  Programmers can&#39;t build computer games and video games without<br/>
mathmatical and logical concepts.  Those concepts are often built into<br/>
the game play.  My son (8 y.o.) understands &quot;math&quot; (though we usually<br/>
don&#39;t call it that) at a *much* higher level than his &quot;grade-level&quot;<br/>
peers often do.  But he doesn&#39;t know his times tables.  He does know<br/>
multiplication, and uses it.  <br/>
<br/>
My son has done algebra, he just didn&#39;t know it was algebra. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
while he was sitting down with a textbook and paper and pencil, it was<br/>
within a nice conversation we were having at the kitchen table. The<br/>
way he talked about it let me know that he&#39;d been thinking about it<br/>
for a while, working it out, and now he was ready to share it with me<br/>
and check it against my experience.  It was in relation to his<br/>
Pokemon&#39;s stats in his video game.<br/>
<br/>
I think computer games and video games help along a very systemic<br/>
understanding of math -- as in, the numbers, stats, scores, formulas<br/>
for game reactions and such are all interrelated and the player starts<br/>
to comprehend them that way, holistically.<br/>
<br/>
So make sure to bring those electronics back. How else will they learn<br/>
the math they need? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I know how to work them out and that&#39;s all that matters to me. I know how to work the problem and find the answer.

Right.  We use the concepts called algebra and biology as a natural part<br/>
of living our lives but most of us will never need to refer to algebra or<br/>
biology text books or to pass an exam in order to successfully use those<br/>
concepts.    <br/>
<br/>
My husband failed algebra in high school, never could understand what<br/>
they wanted from him and yet when he built our fence he understood how to<br/>
calculate the number of boards needed for the pickets to span the<br/>
distance between our garage and the neighbors fence with equal spacing<br/>
between each picket. <br/>
<br/>
I left high school before biology was required but I know which trees and<br/>
shrubs make their own rooting hormones and what kind of break in a bird<br/>
wing can be fixed allowing the bird to fly again, which birds are more<br/>
susceptible to shock and other complications and all kinds of other<br/>
things that are the natural result of the pursuit of my interests.   <br/>

<br/>
But I should talk about an unschooled kid.<br/>
<br/>
Dylan has never had formal math instruction.  A friend gave us a Saxon<br/>
math book awhile back and Dylan looked at it briefly but he didn&#39;t do a<br/>
page of math or study it.  <br/>
<br/>
He did make bad jokes about the ordinal number of Cardinals during the<br/>
news coverage of the selection of a new Pope. <br/>
As a bird watcher I was glad (for the first time ever) we don&#39;t get<br/>
Cardinals in western Montana.  I think he got &quot;ordinal&quot; and &quot;cardinal&quot;<br/>
from that book because I don&#39;t recall it ever coming up before.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan can add, subtract, multiply and divide.  As far as I know he<br/>
doesn&#39;t know the written formula for long division and as I said before,<br/>
he can&#39;t recite multiplication tables.  <br/>
<br/>
But he can figure interest on his savings account.  He can figure a<br/>
fifteen percent tip at a cafe.  He can figure whether he has enough money<br/>
for the books he wants to buy.   He can draw plans for bird and bat<br/>
houses, measure and cut the wood and put the pieces together.  He just<br/>
built a nice bookshelf for his bedroom. <br/>
<br/>
To my knowledge he&#39;s never looked at a biology textbook.  He has field<br/>
guides that he refers to often, and he looks things up on-line.  He can<br/>
identify hundreds of birds local to our area and he can identify almost<br/>
any insect, bug or spider he comes across in our area.  With regard to<br/>
spiders specifically he can usually identify them at least to the genus<br/>
if he can watch them for awhile or see what kind of web they make.   He<br/>
can recognize many plants and trees.  When we&#39;re hiking he can tell the<br/>
difference between Douglas fir and spruce, lodge pole and ponderosa pine,<br/>
etc.   My teacher neighbor calls every evergreen tree a &quot;pine tree.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the thing about Dylan.  He likes bugs and birds and growing<br/>
things.  So when he comes across a thing he hasn&#39;t seen before he is<br/>
curious about it.  He wants to know what it is.  He finds a way to get<br/>
his questions answered.  I think it is -or could- be this way with all<br/>
people if they haven&#39;t had their curiosity killed by school.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532947174">My husband provided an opening for me to drive the<br/>
unschooling bus straight down the middle of the gap<br/>
yesterday.  A brief history:<br/>
<br/>
He has never been an interested student in the world<br/>
of academia.  Like me, he changed his college major<br/>
repeatedly.  He finally found his &#39;thing&#39; and, seven<br/>
years ago, began down the road of a doctoral degree.<br/>
<br/>
He finished his coursework almost three years ago,<br/>
leaving only the qualifying exams and dissertation. <br/>
He cancelled his scheduled exam dates three times over<br/>
the past two years.  Poor sweetie - just HATES this<br/>
stuff.  And I&#39;d say, &quot;Then don&#39;t do it.&quot;  And he&#39;d<br/>
say, &quot;But I&#39;m so clooooooose...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s taking his quals FOR SURE in 10 days.  Yesterday,<br/>
he came into the kitchen and said, &quot;I&#39;m just a bad<br/>
student.  I hate this crap.&quot;  (I rev my unschooling<br/>
bus engine...)<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;No, honey.  You just don&#39;t care about this<br/>
stuff because you don&#39;t need it.  If you did, you know<br/>
you&#39;d be gobbling it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He paused.  (unschooling bus engine roars...)  I<br/>
hugged him and said, &quot;It&#39;s so unfair - just like what<br/>
happens to kids all the time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the little light over his head began to glow.  I<br/>
think we both understand a little more now.  Oh, how I<br/>
hate to see him in such pain.  He&#39;s a grownup and he&#39;s<br/>
crumbling.  What chance do little punkins have in that<br/>
environment/those situations?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584364874">**I believe the only person qualified to determine what my son<br/>
needs (and what he will need in the future) is my son.**<br/>
<br/>
And even he doesn&#39;t need to know what he needs for the future. <br/>
He only needs to know how to get what he needs right now.<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with schooling is that it convinces people <br/>
that things like Biology and Algebra are so hard (and dull) that <br/>
the only way to learn them is to have someone riding herd over <br/>
you as you go through the text..<br/>
<br/>
A child who will be a doctor won&#39;t not learn biology any more than <br/>
a child who will be an artist will not draw. They will be drawn to <br/>
what they need because it&#39;s what interests them. And if they find <br/>
a college wants them to have more math, for instance, they&#39;ll be <br/>
faced with a class without the 12 years of preparation for further <br/>
dullness.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling happens the way kids learn to speak English. They <br/>
learn it as a side effect of getting what they want and persuing <br/>
what interests them.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re looking for is akin to expecting toddlers to pick up <br/>
English textbooks and work through them ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Compare how well learning English as a side effect of living <br/>
works with how well learning works in a high school Spanish <br/>
class.  The first is so effortless we don&#39;t take it seriously. The <br/>
second is so full of effort that if we end up with nothing more than <br/>
a few words we must assume we were at fault or all the work <br/>
was for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
(Unfortunately all the work was pointless.)<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect unschooling to look like kids doing school without <br/>
someone making them. Unschooling looks like playing. It looks <br/>
like kids using tools (like writing and biology and so on) to get <br/>
what they want.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re part is to bring interesting things in their lives. *Don&#39;t* <br/>
equate interesting with things you think they &quot;should&quot; be <br/>
interested in. If they&#39;re interested in anime, seek out anime <br/>
conventions. If they&#39;re interested in model car racing, find ways <br/>
for them to pursue that.<br/>
<br/>
Expand their worlds with things you think will interest them. But <br/>
be careful! If you slip into thinking in terms of what will be &quot;good <br/>
for them&quot; they won&#39;t trust you after a while! You only get so many <br/>
chances with &quot;Trust me, I really think you&#39;ll like this.&quot; :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A child who WANTS to be a doctor, or a vet, or a zookeeper, or a botanist, or <br/>
a photographer of the rainforests for national geographic articles, will <br/>
learn biology.<br/>
<br/>
There are unfortunately &quot;children&quot; (in their 20&#39;s) who are going to medical <br/>
school because their parents declared long ago that that was the only thing the <br/>
parents would support and pay for, regardless of the &quot;child&quot;&#39;s interest in <br/>
biology.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just never known it to happen that parents told a 22 year old &quot;You will <br/>
be an artist, and you will like it, or we&#39;re cutting off your inheritance and <br/>
calling in all your debts to us immediately.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know at least one who was told that about medical school, and I&#39;m pretty <br/>
sure he was not the first, last or only of that subset of humans.   Luckily, he <br/>
really DID like biology and chemistry and was good at them.       He also <br/>
loved rooting exotic plants from cuttings, and playing guitar, and reading about <br/>
the Renaissance, but those were wastes of time in his parents&#39; eyes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known parents to pressure kids to play sports or take music lessons too, <br/>
but luckily art is still not one of the &quot;Paint with oils right now or go to <br/>
your room without supper&quot; areas of pressure.<br/>

I think this is one of the hardest things to &quot;get&quot; about unschooling.  Would you all be willing to toss out some examples of interesting things that you&#39;ve done recently, or are getting ready to do?  (Sure, our kids are likely to diverge in what they are interested in, but I think examples help us readers start generating our own ideas.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not particularly great at leading a high-interest and high-action life, so I don&#39;t hold myself up as an example, but here&#39;s the most interesting current stuff at my house.  We&#39;ve been reading Harry Potter 6 recently, and that&#39;s strongly compelling for my son.  We&#39;re planning a camping trip to the beach in a couple of days.  And Mythbusters last night was about sharks.  Other than that, playing with the hose and eating ice cream are our strongest summer interests.<br/>
<br/>
I bet the rest of you are doing quite a range of other interesting stuff.  And thinking other interesting thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283112623">Let&#39;s see - last year I started learning to play piano. And DS <br/>
sometimes jumps in and plays around with it. DH is making a working <br/>
replica light saber (using clear plastic rod, slices of colored <br/>
plastic, and copper plumbing bits and flashlight innards - once this <br/>
one is done, he&#39;s going to try one with clear plastic PVC pipe <br/>
and &#39;cool neon&#39; rope). DS is enjoying playing with assorted leftover <br/>
bits and pieces. We went to see Fantastic Four on Friday, DS picked <br/>
up a volume of Fantastic Four episodes/issues (compiled into one <br/>
book) at the library Saturday. DH and DS are mucho into Starcraft <br/>
lately. We&#39;re considering a weekend trip in August - it will either <br/>
be a sleepover for DS at my sister&#39;s house (DS and his cousin would <br/>
love to spend a whole weekend together playing; DH and I would get a <br/>
hotel nearby and either have a whole weekend alone or we&#39;d be able <br/>
to grab up DS if things got too hard for him) or it will be a trip <br/>
up to see Niagara Falls, possibly from the Canadian side - DS loves <br/>
waterfalls of all sorts. Oh, we found wild black raspberries growing <br/>
out behind the shed last week. That was fun. Not a whole lot <br/>
of &#39;wild and crazy&#39; stuff going on - just life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611410837">Roxana is 17. She&#39;s in two musical theater shows at the same time <br/>
(Anything Goes and You&#39;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown) and taking dance <br/>
and vocal classes. Doing two shows also means a fair amount of time <br/>
spent shopping - for the right tights, leotard, shoes, make-up, <br/>
strapless bra, hairspray, etc., etc., etc. &lt;G&gt;  In between all that, <br/>
she role plays on Desperate Fans (Live Journal community).<br/>
<br/>
Roya is 20 now - I don&#39;t know if she really counts anymore as an <br/>
example of an unschooler, but SHE thinks she does so:<br/>
she is working two days a week in an adult education program through <br/>
the community college - she&#39;s an aide in a sign language class for <br/>
developmentally disabled adults, she tutors math to adults who are <br/>
wanting to get their GED, she works in the office sometimes, and has <br/>
even taught knitting and crocheting to the developmentally disabled <br/>
adults classes when they did units on &quot;hobbies.&quot;<br/>
She&#39;s taking summer classes at Cal State Long Beach where she&#39;s a <br/>
full-time student now. She finished one class already - it included a <br/>
week-long trip to a completely undeveloped island fifty miles off the <br/>
coast (the island next to the Island of the Blue Dolphin one).  She&#39;s <br/>
taking a class now on managing recreation programs (majoring in <br/>
Recreation and Leisure Studies). She&#39;s discovered she has a HUGE <br/>
advantage in her major over other students because she unschooled and <br/>
doesn&#39;t have any arbitrary lines in her mind dividing <br/>
leisure/recreation activities from work or learning activities. She <br/>
also has been doing a lot of working out - kickboxing class, aerobics, <br/>
swim fitness, and going to a gym.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie is 14 and doing a LOT of hanging out with friends. Spent <br/>
yesterday all day at Downtown Disney with another girl and 4 or 5 boys <br/>
- all of these are kids who do karate at the same studio. They made a <br/>
bear at a place where you stuff and dress a stuffed animal yourself, <br/>
they ate, they went to a movie (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory). The <br/>
kids are 14 to 19 years old. Last week she was in Palm Springs with a <br/>
friend&#39;s family for a few days - just swimming and playing games and <br/>
reading and - hanging out. She did take a voice class a couple of times <br/>
a week, for 4 weeks, but that&#39;s done now.  Tomorrow she&#39;ll go to karate <br/>
at noon and then stay and - you guessed it - hang out with her friends <br/>
- play games, listen to music, talk, eat, until another karate class at <br/>
7:30 pm. Wednesday she&#39;ll, hmmm, hang out at the park with her friends, <br/>
all day. Thursday would be a repeat of Tuesday except Roxana&#39;s got a <br/>
show in the morning and a bunch of us will go see that. Then, back to <br/>
--- hanging out. &lt;G&gt; When she isn&#39;t physically WITH her friends, she&#39;s <br/>
mostly talking to them by IM or emailing or live journaling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids are mostly like me - high energy and not usually comfortable <br/>
sitting around the house much. Like to be on the go and involved in a <br/>
lot of outside stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I do not necessarily recommend it - more down time would probably be <br/>
healthier! We get stressed and cranky - probably need more time spent <br/>
relaxing. But we do have fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938474100">We ( me and dds 8 and 10) just got back from a short visit to Saratoga<br/>
Springs, NY, where dh is working.  We drove from ME and stayed in his hotel<br/>
with him.  My sister also lives in the area so we visited with her.  We took<br/>
the kids to their first drive-in movie (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory),<br/>
we went to a rodeo, we tried to go to polo again, but it was cancelled<br/>
again.  :(  We visited with my sister and dyed Queen Anne&#39;s Lace.  We also<br/>
shopped in a really cool horsey store in downtown Saratoga and walked the<br/>
streets looking at all the horse statues and went to the local county fair<br/>
there and watched a horse presentation and talked at length with a man who<br/>
was building furniture with early American tools who was clearly passionate<br/>
about what he was doing and sharing it with others.  We&#39;ve also been<br/>
watching the series on TNT called Into the West.  It&#39;s very good, although<br/>
sad.  Daily we care for our horse, ride her, and work at the farm we board<br/>
her at.  We also just went to our family reunion a couple weeks ago at a<br/>
local campground.  That was fun!  We are seriously thinking of selling our<br/>
pop-up camper for a second horse.  One of my dd&#39;s isn&#39;t sure she is ready to<br/>
make that change, but change always comes hard for her.  She keeps changing<br/>
her mind.  We&#39;ll wait a bit longer and see what happens.  Maybe wait and get<br/>
one with our tax return next year.  I am reading All Things Wise and<br/>
Wonderful to me and I am reading some other horse series books to the girls.<br/>
We have been playing Scatagories lately too and that&#39;s been fun and we also<br/>
played Beyond Balderdash at my sister&#39;s and that was fun too.  We are off to<br/>
ride the horse with some other girls from the barn.  Got to run but I&#39;ll try<br/>
to think of what else we&#39;ve been doing while we&#39;re gone.  :)<br/>

(coming up).   My sister will be there.   She hasn&#39;t been for 20 years.   I&#39;m not <br/>
going.   Kirby&#39;s staying home too.<br/>
<br/>
Marty (and sometimes Holly) have been involved in once or twice a week <br/>
sessions of a kind of basketball/volleyball-like made up game in a friend&#39;s swimming <br/>
pool.   He designed the game (Ryan did) when he was younger, but never had <br/>
full teams to play it with.   It&#39;s three on a side.   Holly bought him a new <br/>
ball (with bumps) last week.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s planning a birthday party for which people are supposed to dress as <br/>
movie characters.   He was planning to be Jaba the Hut (so Sadie would do <br/>
Princess Leia &lt;g&gt;), but he&#39;s starting to see how impractical it is.   I have the <br/>
wheel chair from when my leg was broken.   We talked about maybe dressing up the <br/>
couch and he could get in and out of the costume (a front-opening couch cover <br/>
of some sort).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has some new friends from &quot;the other gaming store,&quot; and I met a couple <br/>
of them briefly, but it&#39;s been months now, so he&#39;s finally with a batch of <br/>
people I didn&#39;t meet first or approve.   They&#39;re gamers, though, and when the <br/>
gameshop&#39;s closed they hang out at one&#39;s home and it&#39;s not too far from here.   <br/>
So that&#39;s new but I didn&#39;t plan it.<br/>
<br/>
Holly spends most of her time on Halo2 (chatting and playing) and MSN, <br/>
chatting with some of the kids she met at HesFes and some of their online friends.<br/>
<br/>
The grandparents were here for two days.   It wasn&#39;t too bad.   They took the <br/>
kids out to eat, and we played Five Crowns (Holly and the adults).   They <br/>
hung out with the kids some, where they were.   Even watched Holly play Halo2 <br/>
without criticizing her.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith and I have been working on the yard and house, and that&#39;s fun for us.   <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Lately hasn&#39;t been so much all-family stuff, but more in twos and threes.   <br/>
Marty and Holly and I went to the zoo one day and will go again before long <br/>
because a friend of ours is telling stories in the new Africa center.    Marty <br/>
and I went out to lunch one day after he had an ortho appt, and another day we <br/>
went shopping for electronics parts and took our time.   Holly always wants to <br/>
go to the store with me lately.   We walk slowly and talk and buy things that <br/>
weren&#39;t on the list that we know others in the family will like.<br/>

We&#39;re busy but not our normal &#39;busy&quot;.  We&#39;re moving in 2 weeks...all  the way <br/>
from Jacksonville, Florida to Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Just us and  a U-Haul <br/>
pulling one car...I&#39;ll be driving the van....with 4 kids....a dog, a  cat and <br/>
a rabbit.  We&#39;ll take 2 of the kids back to their home in Austin,  <br/>
Texas,....and then on down the road.  I think it&#39;s about 2000 miles.<br/>
 <br/>
Today, we went to the beach.  Broc and I and Brenna and Logan...my two  <br/>
stepkids, Tyler and Lindsay (my older stepson had to fly back to Texas  yesterday) <br/>
and two wonderful unschooling friends that Brenna knows from Live and  Learn <br/>
Conferences.  Julian is here from the Boston area and Chris from  Chicago. <br/>
(Thanks to their wonderful families for sharing their sons with us  :-)  They flew <br/>
in yesterday and on Friday I&#39;m driving Brenna, Julian and  Chris to Not Back <br/>
to School Camp in West Virginia.  One week later I&#39;ll  drive back up to get <br/>
her and then we head for New Mexico.<br/>
 <br/>
I was so worried about the riptides and sunburns for those &quot;northern  boys&quot;.  <br/>
We got home and the only ones with sunburns are the Florida  people!  :-)  We <br/>
watched some of Woodstock tonight...the teens are all  playing their guitars. <br/>
   The younger kids are in the pool.  I  think we have 3 Harry Potter books <br/>
being read.  Lots of boxes half packed  here and there.  It&#39;s so nice having <br/>
the kids about.  I love the sound  of their music and their voices and laughter. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Many changes for me this summer.  Huge.   Some of it  sad....some very <br/>
hopeful and  I&#39;m thinking that the music  and children&#39;s  voices and the laughter <br/>
will be with us in New  Mexico also. <br/>

interesting things that you&#39;ve done recently, or are getting ready to<br/>
do?  ==<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re listening to Harry Potter on books-on-tape -- we&#39;re a little<br/>
behind, so we&#39;ll be picking up Book 4 from the library tomorrow.  But<br/>
last Friday we went to our local bookstore&#39;s HP6 party, just for the<br/>
party -- we didn&#39;t stay for the book. &lt;G&gt;  Fisher (8) dressed up in<br/>
his wizard&#39;s hat and a homemade cape, made a sparkly wand, touched a<br/>
hedgehog at the &quot;Care of Magical Creatures&quot; booth, and brought home,<br/>
not a Harry Potter item, but a Pirate&#39;s Treasure Chest that had a lot<br/>
of historical information and knot-tying information &lt;G&gt;.  So since<br/>
then we&#39;ve been playing pretend pirates quite a bit.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been playing lots on our new birthday trampoline -- both kids (8<br/>
and 2) can do way more with their bodies than they could a few weeks<br/>
ago.  <br/>
<br/>
We also pretend to drive the cars a lot -- Riley in particular, but<br/>
Fisher often joins in.  Our minivan is alternately a space ship, a<br/>
pirate ship, and an actual car being driven by crazy people on the<br/>
freeway.  Riley likes to turn the radio up loud and blow me kisses as<br/>
he&#39;s driving -- I think he&#39;s been watching his papa.<br/>
<br/>
Our area has some free water parks (not slides -- just water shooting<br/>
out of the ground at different places and different intervals), so we<br/>
visited one of those last week.  There are summer programs there that<br/>
include having board games and crafts materials available, so we used<br/>
those as well.<br/>
<br/>
Fisher has switched from playing Pokemon on his GameBoy to playing<br/>
MegaMan.  He is reading the game guide and telling me all the ways<br/>
that the stats and the various pieces of information interrelate.  We<br/>
play pretend MegaMan and come up with some pretty tough Net<br/>
Navigators, thanks to his incisive analysis.<br/>
<br/>
Fisher saw a new Bionicle advertised that he&#39;s interested in, so we<br/>
may be checking that out tomorrow or the next day.  We just picked up<br/>
some MadLibs and some of the Invisible Ink books, so we&#39;ve been<br/>
playing around with those.  Fisher got a big stuffed snake, so he&#39;s<br/>
been carrying that around his neck and we tell all sorts of snake<br/>
stories together.  <br/>
<br/>
Riley&#39;s new fascination is pouring his own soda and putting ice in it.<br/>
 If I have any carbonated drink that I&#39;m not using, I take it out to<br/>
the deck with a cup and a small tub of ice, and let him go to it.  The<br/>
fizz just fascinates him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been writing more and getting my Tarot cards out some.  Sometimes<br/>
Fisher comes by and asks about the pictures, so we talk about world<br/>
religions and mythology and symbols.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been watching Dragonball Z on Cartoon Network with great<br/>
interest, as it&#39;s the first time we&#39;ve seen this part of the series. <br/>
Well, Riley isn&#39;t as interested in DBZ.  Riley and I love the Boobahs<br/>
and the Wiggles.  Very trippy, all of it.  Riley likes to blow us down<br/>
and to wake us up, Wiggles style.  We have lots of games on the<br/>
trampoline of falling over and bouncing back up again.<br/>
<br/>
Our life in a nutshell -- lots of learning and connections and<br/>
interests, coming from all over.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Rosie is 14 and doing a LOT of hanging out with friends. Spent<br/>
yesterday all day at Downtown Disney with another girl and 4 or 5 boys<br/>
. .  &lt;snip&gt;. . Tomorrow she&#39;ll go to karate<br/>
at noon and then stay and - you guessed it - hang out with her friends<br/>
- play games, listen to music, talk, eat, until another karate class at<br/>
7:30 pm. Wednesday she&#39;ll, hmmm, hang out at the park with her friends,<br/>
all day. Thursday would be a repeat of Tuesday except Roxana&#39;s got a<br/>
show in the morning and a bunch of us will go see that. Then, back to<br/>
--- hanging out. &lt;G&gt; When she isn&#39;t physically WITH her friends, she&#39;s<br/>
mostly talking to them by IM or emailing or live journaling.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Did anyone else read this and think that the &quot;But, kids NEED socialization!&quot;<br/>
people would suddenly be very focused on how much kids need academics if<br/>
they heard about all this &quot;hanging out?&quot; &lt;g&gt; Maybe I&#39;m just cynical! LOL<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I get those thoughts - frequently lately as we&#39;ve been at the drive <br/>
in just about every Friday night for the last month - DS favorite <br/>
thing because WE can control the volume and such so he can watch <br/>
movies he wants to see without the dark, loud, crowded issues. This <br/>
last time, it was interesting to see because there was a little boy <br/>
(maybe 5? DS is 7) in the car next to us. About 20 minutes until <br/>
movie time. DS had been playing with some other kids (he brings his <br/>
pair of light sabers to battle with) but they had to go with their <br/>
mom (pre-movie bathroom and snack stuff). So, this other little kid <br/>
had been watching them from his seat at the open window of his <br/>
vehicle. He started talking to DS about the light sabers and DS <br/>
asked if he wanted to come out and play. Kid&#39;s dad shook his head <br/>
no. DS came over to me. I said &quot;Well, it looks like his dad doesn&#39;t <br/>
want him to come out of the car.&quot; DS talked to the kid another <br/>
minute then went around to the driver&#39;s side window and quite calmly <br/>
and coolly asked the DAD if it would be okay for the boy to come out <br/>
and play. I guess something got to him (maybe courtesy and <br/>
politeness?) because the mom apparently convinced the dad and she <br/>
and the boy came out. She leaned on their vehicle while DS and her <br/>
son had a grand time with the light sabers - DS even let the boy be <br/>
Anakin (the good Jedi Anakin) while he was Darth Vader with the red <br/>
light saber. Then they switched. And when we signalled that the <br/>
movie was about to start, they calmly packed up, said goodbye and <br/>
went back to their respective spots (we sit inside the pickup - big <br/>
bench seat way more comfortable than beach chairs for one). <br/>
<br/>
Gee, so DS &#39;should&#39; go to school to learn sharing, courtesy, <br/>
politeness, respectful address for others,...? LOL<br/>
