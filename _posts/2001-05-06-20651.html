<div id="ygrps-yiv-698371299">Hello everyone;<br/>
  I was wondering if there are PA homeschoolers on the list. I have <br/>
some questions about homeschooling/unschooling there, and would <br/>
appreciate any information. Please feel free to email privately.<br/>

I just hear this horror stories to only find out details that make me see <br/>
where the whole mess could have been avoided.<br/>
Not that it makes what happened excusable!<br/>
I have been on the PA track lately with questions coming to the Altlearn Map <br/>
project about that state, I just remember the Bryant family as being <br/>
there......feeling like Tia with Swiss cheese for brains. :)<br/>
You couldn&#39;t pay me enough to live in that state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574839874">A few months back, someone had said they were in PA and would love to find some other unschoolers. Was it at this list? I got in touch with an unschooling aquaintance in PA and he gave me a couple of links...one for the eclectic support group his family attends (in the Scranton/Wilkes-Barr area) and one for the PA unschoolers network.<br/>
If it was someone at this list, could you write me and I&#39;ll email the links to ya?<br/>
