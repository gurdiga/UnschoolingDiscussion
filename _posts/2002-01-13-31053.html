<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240687721">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Carrie, WAHM (work-at-home mom) to Oren (4.5) & Elke (2) and<br/>
partner to dh Jesse for almost 12 years.  We live in Jackson County,<br/>
Kentucky (SE KY in the foothills of the Appalachians).  We have a<br/>
non-working farm and hope to add goats, horses and pigs when we are done<br/>
with babies.  We have been unschooling since birth, as I found John Holt<br/>
during my pregnancy with my son and recognized myself, lol!  My sworn agenda<br/>
is to keep them out of public school!  I&#39;m a self-taught jewelry artist.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have been unschoolers from birth, figuring out what that little<br/>
scooter thing was and could do on their own, and all of the other learning<br/>
children begin at birth.  I can honestly say that they have figured out all<br/>
on their own which colors are which (with NO QUIZZES, imagine that), what<br/>
different animals are, how to count, etc.  It has been incredibly<br/>
eye-opening for us because I never realized just how early the inane quizzes<br/>
and tests start (example - grandma: what is your name, how old are you, what<br/>
color is this, and on and on).  Okay, yes, I&#39;m a hardcore unschooler.  I<br/>
always resisted forced learning myself and absolutely abhor tests, so it is<br/>
really personal for me.<br/>
<br/>
We are pretty isolated and my son is needing more challenging and<br/>
stimulating things in his life.  I am always looking for activities, etc. to<br/>
do which will challenge him in his new learning phase (he is beginning to<br/>
learn letters/words in a very holistic approach, is unwittingly doing basic<br/>
addition and subtraction and has even showed an understanding of<br/>
multiplication in our daily lives, and has an incredible vocabulary (english<br/>
and spanish) to rival most adults.  He is just very ripe and starting to<br/>
show frustration because he is not stimulated enough in our daily lives.  I<br/>
am looking for something to stimulate my creativity so that I can make a<br/>
more stimulating, learning rich environment for us. (any and all suggestions<br/>
appreciated!)<br/>
<br/>
I am also looking for a good place to go to learn specifically about state<br/>
mandated homeschooling laws.  Can anyone point me in the right direction?<br/>
<br/>
I am mostly a lurker because I have so much going on, but I hope to<br/>
participate when I can.  I&#39;ll definitely be soaking up the ideas!<br/>
<br/>
Carrie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-615671394">Well, I&#39;ve answered a few posts, but not taken the time to introduce myself <br/>
and my family and I guess I&#39;ll do that now.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Caroline (Caro) for short.  I have seven children...five boys, two <br/>
girls ranging in age from 15 to 2.  <br/>
<br/>
We have been through the whole range of homeschooling styles, but I started <br/>
out as an unschooler many years ago.  In fact, when I was introduced to <br/>
h/sing, I thought Holt was all there was.  I remember remarking to my hubby <br/>
after we&#39;d read articles about h/sing in the newspaper...&quot;Do you believe that <br/>
people actually set up little schools in their own homes...then why don&#39;t <br/>
they just send the kids to school?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then, somehow, maybe it was the number of kids we had, insecurity, health <br/>
problems (I&#39;ve got a ton of excuses), we got rigid.  Really rigid.  And I was <br/>
one of those h/ser&#39;s who was setting up the little school and ringing the <br/>
bell and scheduling my kids right down to when they were supposed to use the <br/>
john.<br/>
<br/>
And I defended myself by saying...but look what they&#39;re learning...and the <br/>
relatives are so impressed.  But, at the same time, our home life was falling <br/>
apart.  The kids were always tense.  I was ALWAYS tense.  I felt like my life <br/>
was slipping away...I never even got outside because I was so busy making my <br/>
home into a school and then just trying to keep my home from falling apart.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to exaggerate here.  It&#39;s really been stressful, and always a <br/>
voice nagged at me...but you know another way!  And I did try, different <br/>
times, to respond.  I joined other unschooling lists, attended a conference, <br/>
but I wasn&#39;t ready to get out of my &quot;safety zone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;ve realized that I have to.  It&#39;s no longer become important that I do <br/>
it or not because of what others think.  My house has literally been falling <br/>
apart from the stress of trying to keep up this &quot;system&quot; that none of us <br/>
truly believed in.<br/>
<br/>
In the weeks since I&#39;ve come back here and read through my old, dusty copies <br/>
of Holt and other things, I&#39;ve seen changes at home.  I&#39;d like to report that <br/>
everything is hunky-dory, but that&#39;s not true.  But, I saw my husband laugh <br/>
with the kids tonight and tell them silly riddles.  And I took my nine year <br/>
old and his brother to Wal-Mart tonight to buy Star Wars toys which they <br/>
don&#39;t need, but love to play with.  I played ball outside with my kids <br/>
yesterday.  I saw the full moon with them tonight.  I&#39;ve gone for a walk with <br/>
my dh four nights in a row.  <br/>
<br/>
To wrap this up, I want to say thanks.  For all the straightforward, <br/>
jolt-me-out-of-my-reverie type comments and for the &quot;be easy on <br/>
yourself...one step at a time&quot; comments.  They have all been helpful to me.  <br/>
Even the discussion about unschooling, which some of you deemed a fight, has <br/>
been fascinating for me, and really helped me to clarify things.<br/>
<br/>
I know that I will have frequent questions, doubts and pulling my hair out.  <br/>
I know I&#39;ll be able to sound them out here.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Caro<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270435990">Wow, Caro!  Reading your post really touched me.  We&#39;re still in the <br/>
beginning stages of unschooling/deciding to unschool right now, and that has <br/>
to be up there with one of the more inspirational things I&#39;ve read about it, <br/>
honestly!  Thanks so much for sending it and good luck with your unschooling! <br/>

&lt;&lt; We&#39;ve lived happily under this &quot;system&quot; for years. But I&#39;m finding that <br/>
 I don&#39;t have the energy to do the amount of cleaning up after other <br/>
 people that it would take for me to be comfortable, anymore. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe in this system theoretically, and most of the time it works fine <br/>
here.<br/>
I ask, they usually help.<br/>
But we had a couple of tough days and I lost it.<br/>
We had two extra kids stay over, kids that I really, really like and love <br/>
having over.<br/>
I made food for the kids and brought it to them, they stayed on video games <br/>
from afternoon to the next morning (finally falling asleep about 6am) which <br/>
is no problem.<br/>
They were pretty quiet while I slept and did their own thing.<br/>
The problem was when dishes kept stacking up all over the living room and the <br/>
only kids bringing them to the kitchen were our guests! I cleaned up after <br/>
everyone a few times, reminding them that I&#39;d like their dishes brought out <br/>
to the kitchen so food wouldn&#39;t dry onto them.  Their friends left. They <br/>
continued for the next two days doing pretty much nothing but video games. I <br/>
got a little pushy today.<br/>
There was food all over the floor, dishes still being left even though I&#39;d <br/>
requested them to be brought out several times, blankets and pillows <br/>
everywhere, yogurt containers half eaten all over...I LOST it!<br/>
I pointed out how very inconsiderate they were being by expecting me to clean <br/>
up and not lift a finger. I told them how stressed out all the mess makes me <br/>
(NO, I can&#39;t be happy in total disasters, I&#39;ve tried) and they needed to shut <br/>
the tv off and help me gain some sanity.<br/>
They did of course.<br/>
But it pissed me off that I didn&#39;t get help until I was totally stressed.<br/>
I am fine with them being focused on their friends/video games....I&#39;m fine <br/>
with doing most of the housework.<br/>
But I work outside the home, dh runs a business and we NEED help sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time we have a happy flow of my requests being met willingly, <br/>
because I don&#39;t bother them with it most of the time. And they do appreciate <br/>
all the clean up I do for them. But once in a while this &quot;system&quot; fails me, <br/>
or maybe I fail it.<br/>
And I get really, really cranky and feel like no one cares unless I get <br/>
cranky.<br/>
which I DON&#39;T want to be.<br/>
So we held a meeting today to try and figure out some way to make sure <br/>
everyone&#39;s needs get met. I&#39;m still not sure we&#39;ve got much figured out, but <br/>
we all feel better having talked about it. :)<br/>
I know that chore lists suck. I will not resort to that lame system again.  I <br/>
will not dictate how the house is kept unless I just simply do it. They live <br/>
here and have a right to decide these things too...and most of what they do <br/>
is WAY more important than cleaning.<br/>
But sometimes it all falls apart in chaos and I resort to &quot;We are going to <br/>
get this disaster cleaned up right now, I&#39;m going crazy!!&quot;<br/>
They probably think I&#39;m nuts (ok, I am) but some order helps me be a lot more <br/>
creative and fun. If it helps me be a better Mom, that&#39;s good for all of us.<br/>
This doesn&#39;t mean they have to keep the house the way I like it, that&#39;s my <br/>
job.<br/>
But if bringing dishes out or at least letting me know when food spills helps <br/>
me be sane, they should learn to think about that.<br/>
It&#39;s not an issue most days, but I&#39;d like to find some way to avoid the <br/>
occasional meltdown. sigh.<br/>

<br/>
Give a child a house with rooms that are full of chaos and mess and<br/>
rooms that are bright, open and spacious AND, I feel, 9 out of 10 they<br/>
will pick the CLEAN room. That is a natural response. That is why one<br/>
feels good when a house is in order and tidy. Albeit, mothers seem to<br/>
need that more than the rest of the family!<br/>
<br/>
Children need to realize that living together requires a  effort from<br/>
all members of the family. Yes I let my kids get the house in totally<br/>
disarray, but they are held to tidy it up (and not tomorrow either,<br/>
unless it is late).  I can relate to your blowout as I have done the<br/>
same. There is a saturation point. <br/>
<br/>
Children are children, they are human. If someone can get away with<br/>
someone else cleaning up after them, they will take it. I think it comes<br/>
down to consistency. I often find it &quot;easier to clean up myself, but<br/>
have to realize that they need to know that they can do it too and be a<br/>
part of the cycle of life.  The more consisten I am with asking them to<br/>
help the more I see them doing things on their own accord. <br/>
<br/>
Keep the faith.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586326521">***There was food all over the floor, dishes still being left even though<br/>
I&#39;d <br/>
requested them to be brought out several times, blankets and pillows <br/>
everywhere, yogurt containers half eaten all over...I LOST it!***<br/>
<br/>
The hard thing for some people to remember is that kids really don&#39;t see<br/>
&quot;mess&quot; when we see it.   When they&#39;re busy and happy they&#39;re not looking<br/>
at the dishes or spilled food the same way we are.   <br/>
<br/>
I think what sometimes happens to parents is they start to make a<br/>
judgement about what the child is doing.   We might look and say to<br/>
ourselves &quot;he&#39;s just sitting there, he couldn&#39;t take two minutes and take<br/>
the dishes to the sink?&quot;   and THAT begins in some kind of twisted<br/>
magical way to become some version of  &quot;he&#39;s ignoring me, or he&#39;s trying<br/>
to make me mad, or he doesn&#39;t care about me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What it really is though, is a comfortable child, happily doing what he<br/>
wants, oblivious to the &quot;mess&quot; that&#39;s freaking his mom out. <br/>
<br/>
I think the responsibility is on us, as adults, to convey what we would<br/>
like them to do in the clearest, calmest way, before we&#39;re mad.    We<br/>
sometimes think they should be able to sense our stress level going up<br/>
and that we shouldn&#39;t have to explain exactly what we want, they should<br/>
just be reading our cues, but that almost never works.   <br/>
<br/>
When you saw your first or second or third&lt;g&gt; request for help wasn&#39;t<br/>
reaching them maybe you could have stood in front of the action and said,<br/>
sorta friendly like, (while gripping a butchers knife&lt;G&gt; ok, maybe not)  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m sorry guys but I need five minutes of your time to get these dishes<br/>
taken care of, then I&#39;ll leave you alone.&quot;   If you are right there,<br/>
where they HAVE to notice you (not just a background noise that fades<br/>
away after a few minutes)  and you don&#39;t move until they are showing some<br/>

If you want, I&#39;ll loan you Dylan&#39;s friend Aryel for a few days.   I<br/>
actually said to her last Thursday, &quot;if you clean one more thing I&#39;m<br/>
taking you home!&quot;   My husband said I probably upset the balance of the<br/>
whole universe by saying those words to a child, so maybe that&#39;s what<br/>
happened at your house.  Cosmic imbalance.<br/>
I&#39;ll give her the broom next time she comes over and you&#39;ll live happily<br/>
ever after. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

My husband gets neurotic about things more than I do.  I&#39;ve started letting him know each day what the kids have been up to to help me out.  Too often he assumes that they made such and such a mess (because thats what he sees) and then he doesn&#39;t see the other area of the house that they cleaned or the dishes they put away, or the toilet they scrubbed.<br/>
<br/>
It helps *me* to think of them that way too.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think what sometimes happens to parents is they start to make a<br/>
 judgement about what the child is doing.   We might look and say to<br/>
 ourselves &quot;he&#39;s just sitting there, he couldn&#39;t take two minutes and take<br/>
 the dishes to the sink?&quot;   and THAT begins in some kind of twisted<br/>
 magical way to become some version of  &quot;he&#39;s ignoring me, or he&#39;s trying<br/>
 to make me mad, or he doesn&#39;t care about me.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think this is very true.<br/>
And not only with a parent/child relationship, but any relationship in life.<br/>
As soon as we take behavior and read a message into it, we usually warp what <br/>
is truly being said or not said.<br/>
I try to remember this, but it takes a lot of retraining......and patience, <br/>
which I don&#39;t come by naturally. :)<br/>

<br/>
Ren, what would have happened if you went to the children, had them <br/>
excuse themselves from their guests and the video games, and point <br/>
blank stated what you would like? Would they have gotten the idea <br/>
then that you wanted and needed some help?<br/>
<br/>
I know sometimes if I ask something while the kids are busy, even if <br/>
for most people they don&#39;t look busy, they can answer but not really <br/>
get what I&#39;m saying. If I take a minute to go to them, have them look <br/>
at me and really hear what I&#39;m saying, then it sinks in. Not sure if <br/>
you did that or not. <br/>
<br/>
I had a meltdown of some sorts the other night, although I was proud <br/>
of the way I handled it. I just couldn&#39;t take it anymore with how the <br/>
playroom looked. I&#39;ve been doing so well with not having clean up <br/>
time anymore. But I guess with the kitchen in disarray, (Joe got sick <br/>
half way through the paint job) the things on the floor of the <br/>
playroom for a week just got to be too much. I was able to reasonably <br/>
explain my discomfort and ask for some clean up. It was all cleaned <br/>
up in no time. Sierra even got Alyssa to help clean up the bedroom by <br/>
making it a time game. It was even nicer that I didn&#39;t ask for the <br/>
bedrooms to be cleaned. Of course now we&#39;ve decided to incorporate <br/>
the dogs in the whole house, which makes the kids really clean up the <br/>
floor now! I think there may have been an ulterior motive for me <br/>
letting the dogs out. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>

I guess I can&#39;t see keeping *my* house the way *I* like it as an example of <br/>
my being taken advantage of by my children.  Yes, even when they mess it up.<br/>
<br/>
Which leads to another question.<br/>
Is it possible to be &#39;taken advantage of&#39; by one&#39;s own children in an <br/>
unschooling family?<br/>
What would that look like?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t for the life of me think what that would look like because at the <br/>
first feelings of it, we&#39;d start talking about it and trying to figure out <br/>
why the person (adult or child) felt that way and how that feeling came <br/>
about, etc.<br/>

<br/>
That is an excellend question.<br/>
<br/>
Am I taking advantage of my family when I come in the house and do what I <br/>
want to do?  Am I taking advantage of them when I just assume that if I rent <br/>
a movie one of them has expressed interest in that he&#39;ll probably sit and <br/>
watch it with me?  When I expect my husband will go to Costco when the <br/>
shopping list is long enough, is that me just assuming?<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re all smiling and nice to each other through all that assumption, <br/>
maybe we&#39;re assuming correctly that the others LIKE us and will help us out, <br/>
and that of course we&#39;ll help them too.<br/>
<br/>
Another similar philosophical question came up again last weekend.   Cheating.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid&#39;s involved in tests and homework and grades and science fairs, it&#39;s <br/>
possible to cheat.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is only involved in learning for the sake of learning, there is no <br/>
such thing as cheating.<br/>
Unschoolers can&#39;t cheat, in unschooling, because getting help makes more <br/>
sense than not getting help.  Looking in books IS the way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I see them as related items, but I doubt that many brand-new-to-unschooling <br/>
readers will see the connection.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is one thing my husband seems so afraid of. He has a hard time with the <br/>
whole philosophy of unschooling and letting go of his old mentality <br/>
concerning &quot;raising&quot; children. Most of the time he goes along with what I <br/>
suggest. Every once in a while, he&#39;ll come out with thinking out loud to me <br/>
that maybe the kids will end up walking all over us. Or he might suggest <br/>
some kind of punishment like taking something away from them. There are <br/>
times in the past when he&#39;s actually stated that to one child who upset him. <br/>
He never followed through and we&#39;ve talked about what that does. Now his <br/>
questions about it all are directed at me. He was raised in a strict <br/>
household to one extent, he got spanked with spoons and belts. Then on the <br/>
other hand, his parents were never there for him. Never attended one <br/>
baseball game he played in. How sad. He would go and come back to his games <br/>
all alone. He was also a latch key kid and ended up heavy in drugs and <br/>
alcohol. This whole unrestricted attitude is hard sometimes for him to <br/>
understand. But he&#39;s starting to see we have great kids. They don&#39;t take <br/>
advantage of us at all. We haven&#39;t been unschooling that long, but even my <br/>
oldest at 17 doesn&#39;t walk all over us. It&#39;s the way you talk to your <br/>
children and what they see and hear that matters. Does Tara clean the house <br/>
or do the laundry? Well yeah, sometimes but most of the time it&#39;s my job. I <br/>
have no problem with that. She has a lot on her plate. She cooks for herself <br/>
and sometimes does laundry and keeps her room spotless. All by her own <br/>
accord and standards. She watches and plays with the kids and takes care of <br/>
the litter box. She does dishes. And anything I ask of her is done with no <br/>
problems. Now the younger ones don&#39;t do as much, but I really never have a <br/>
problem with them doing something I ask. They will ask if it can wait until <br/>
later sometimes. That&#39;s never a problem here. The little one of course says <br/>
no all the time so I do what I asked of her and then just keep trying!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think respecting our children turns them into self centered adults.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think respecting our children turns them into self centered <br/>
adults. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t either.  With apologies to those who might&#39;ve seen this, and as an <br/>
offering to those who haven&#39;t, here&#39;s a recent HEM column:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How to Raise a Respected Child <br/>
<br/>
Holly says the ice cream we have in the freezer is too sweet. She had <br/>
chocolate milk last night and said there was too much chocolate in it, so she <br/>
divided it and made chocolate milk for someone else with half of it. She <br/>
usually prefers plain milk. <br/>
<br/>
Plain milk tastes WAY better if it&#39;s your choice than if does when it&#39;s plain <br/>
because someone else wouldn&#39;t let you put chocolate in it. <br/>
<br/>
Without free choice, how can a person choose what is plain and good? <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling begins with a choice between going to school or not. How many <br/>
millions of people are never given that choice? <br/>
<br/>
Next is the choice between &quot;doing school-work&quot; or not. Sometimes new <br/>
unschooling parents are hoping that holding their breath and waiting might <br/>
lead to children studying a curriculum, just as the <br/>
mathematically-allegorical monkeys might type Hamlet. <br/>
<br/>
In the success-bearing phase, unschoolers stop looking for Hamlet or even for <br/>
English history. But knowing that Ian Holm, who plays Bilbo, plays Polonius <br/>
with Glenn Close in a Mel Gibson movie causes it to be worth a look for lots <br/>
of people. And he was Fluellen in Kenneth Brannagh&#39;s Henry V, too. If they <br/>
watch Hamlet or Henry V because of Lord of the Rings, is that like chocolate <br/>
milk, or like plain milk? If they don&#39;t watch Hamlet yet, or ever, that&#39;s <br/>
fine too. <br/>
<br/>
The most peaceful unschooling families have loosed the ropes that held <br/>
learning at the dock. They have developed faith in the idea that humans learn <br/>
best in freedom. <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s just a pretty truism, about unschooling families. Maybe it is as <br/>
real as granite. Here are some other patterns for your consideration, though: <br/>
Unschooling families with young children often fear for the neighbors to <br/>
&quot;test them&quot; and find them wild or &quot;behind.&quot; Unschooling families with older <br/>
children politely try to hide their smugness at the positive responses of <br/>
others to their older unschoolers. How does that change come about? <br/>
<br/>
There are traditional dialogs adults have with stranger-children. They ask <br/>
what school they go to. They ask whether the child likes his teacher, and <br/>
what his favorite subject is. My children haven&#39;t gotten past the first two <br/>
questions, because if &quot;I don&#39;t go to school&quot; doesn&#39;t stump the interviewer, <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t have a teacher&quot; usually does. And so an adult who succeeds in having <br/>
a conversation with an unschooled child finds himself speaking with a person, <br/>
and not &quot;a student,&quot; not &quot;a child.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
For some, this is their first real conversation with a person who isn&#39;t grown <br/>
to adulthood. My kids are used to being the first, in that way. They&#39;re used <br/>
to the look in people&#39;s eyes when they realize that here is a child who has <br/>
something to talk about and who will confidently and guilelessly speak. <br/>
How does that confidence arise? <br/>
<br/>
I really believe unschooling works best when parents trust a child&#39;s <br/>
personhood, his intelligence, his instincts, his potential to be mature and <br/>
calm. Take any of that away, and the child becomes smaller and powerless to <br/>
some degree. <br/>
<br/>
Give them power and respect, and they become respected and powerful. <br/>
Is it just that simple? That a parent can GIVE a child power and respect? Can <br/>
a parent give a child freedom? <br/>
<br/>
With the freedom to choose what they eat, my children have bypassed sweets <br/>
more times than I could have counted, and eaten hearty, real food. I saw <br/>
those choices working before they were old enough to go to school, or not to <br/>
go to school. They had all the food they wanted. <br/>
<br/>
With the freedom to choose to stay up or to go to bed, I saw toddlers ask to <br/>
go to bed because they were tired, and then saw them go to sleep smiling, and <br/>
wake up happy. They had all the waking they wanted, and all the sleep they <br/>
wanted, instead of feeling deprived of either. <br/>
<br/>
Of my childhood, I remember tears over pancakes. EAT THEM NOW. I didn&#39;t eat <br/>
them again for fifteen years, after that forced-pancake day. Was that good <br/>
for nutrition? Discipline? Love? Respect? No, it was destructive. I remember <br/>
being forced at school and at home to drink milk. Was one glass enough? Then <br/>
is half a glass enough? Will a child drink not one drop more than he HAS to? <br/>
Is milk better than peace? <br/>
<br/>
For many children, information is treated like cold pancakes. Skills are <br/>
forced like too-warm milk. <br/>
What if hot pancakes, served with a smile, would taste really good with milk? <br/>
What magic happens when it&#39;s fully acceptable for a child to say &quot;No thanks&quot; <br/>
to hot pancakes? <br/>
<br/>
Neediness expresses itself differently with different kids. Abundance <br/>
expresses itself similarly in all. <br/>
Neediness creates various interpersonal problems, health difficulties, <br/>
psychological stress and sorrow. Chronic neediness becomes a vacuum that <br/>
cannot be filled. <br/>
<br/>
Abundance in one person provides benefits for others. A child with all the <br/>
trust he needs can trust others. A child with all the time he needs can share <br/>
that time with others. One who has freedom won&#39;t begrudge freedom in others. <br/>
<br/>
Most people have never known a kid who has experienced true abundance. Most <br/>
have never met a child who had been given a full measure of respect, so that <br/>
the child was respected (already) and full of respect (respectful). It is <br/>
easy to respect someone who has that respect already, and who has so much <br/>
that he can spread it around to others. <br/>
<br/>
An abundance of love, of confidence, of self and of freedom will create a <br/>
flow of respect from and toward a person. <br/>

Sandra Dodd&#39;s children are Holly (11), Marty (13) and Kirby (16). They have <br/>
never been to school, and they eventually came to amaze the neighbors. Their <br/>
abundance is shared with others, usually in Albuquerque, New Mexico. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe what we need is the same kind of <br/>
 email list encouragement/reminders and a system - that is more in tune <br/>
 with being respectful of the so-called junk which is really somebody&#39;s <br/>
 &quot;stuff.&quot; I know I could use encouragement and some sort of system to <br/>
 get me moving. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have found the perfect solution!!<br/>
An angel by the name of Aimee Streeter started a column in our local <br/>
newspaper that is helping me dig myself out one baby step at a time.<br/>
No flylady emails, no constant fuss, just one project at a time that helps me <br/>
gain my sanity back.<br/>
The first month I spent on just the kitchen, one project per week.<br/>
After a year, she promises a fairly organized, enjoyable home.<br/>
I believe her.<br/>
If you want to see all the projects up until now, the weekly &quot;assignments&quot; <br/>
are at pensacolanewsjournal.com<br/>
I can do the projects as it is convenient for me, skip a week if I need to , <br/>
but overall I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s small enough steps I don&#39;t feel overwhelmed <br/>
and the good feeling I get helps me maintain the little places I&#39;ve mucked <br/>
out.<br/>
 I LOVE it!!<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
