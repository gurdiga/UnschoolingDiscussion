I am replying privately as I think this has been talked to death on the<br/>
list.  Continuing will change nothing.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been rude, defensive, or condescending in any of my messages.<br/>
And no, I do not need any attntion from you.  The tone of your missive is<br/>
very patronizing and is not appreciated.  You do not agree with my position,<br/>
and you are perfectly entitled to to that.  I am afforded that same right, I<br/>
do not have to agree with you.<br/>
<br/>
There is a very real double standard on this list.  The majority of the<br/>
people here do not believe in spanking, and made some very strong statements<br/>
regarding it, even to calling spanking abusive.  Those statements were not<br/>
called &quot;judgmental&quot; , nor were the posters called names.  Why is it any<br/>
different to say that parents who spank are abusive than to say that leaving<br/>
children in full time care is harmful?  There is no difference, except in<br/>
your perception.  It would appear that what you agree with is okay to say,<br/>
and what you don&#39;t agree with is judgmental.  That is a very narrow view.<br/>
<br/>
It is, and has been, my stand that children are harmed by being abandoned by<br/>
their parents.  I never said the parents were &quot;bad&quot;or &quot;abusive&quot;.  I said it<br/>
is a wrong action because it harms the children.  I firmly believe that the<br/>
rights of children supercede the wishes, or even rights, or adults.  If you<br/>
choose to disagree with this then so be it.  Your disagreement does not make<br/>
my view &quot;judgmental&quot;, it makes it different.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to be very clear, and have been repeating myself for days here,<br/>
to no avail.  If you enjoy attacking those who hold different views than<br/>
yours please attack elsewhere.  If you would like to engage in a discussion<br/>
on the different sides of the issue I would be happy to do that.<br/>
