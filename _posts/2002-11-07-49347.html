<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070692007">We do.  We used to attend a Lutheran church but it took a definite<br/>
fundamentalist turn with the new preacher so...<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes drive the 30 miles to the closest UU church and the kids and dh<br/>
are free to come or not.  We say blessings at meals and the kids often join<br/>
in.  (The only rule is to be respectful, like sitting quietly while the<br/>
blessing is said if you do not want to join in).  We talk of God, Jesus,<br/>
Wicca, atheism, Mohammed, etc. with the kids and whatever path they choose<br/>
will be fine with us.  I believe that as long as you are seeking the &quot;higher<br/>
power&quot; whether you call that God, Goddess, enlightenment, etc., then the<br/>
&quot;higher power&quot; will find you.<br/>
<br/>
We belong to a very fundamentalist support group, a group that  started<br/>
their own  girl group because Girl Scouts wouldn&#39;t openly discriminate<br/>
against gays.  The ladies were shocked that I told them I would have to<br/>
discuss joining their group with my then 10yo dd because we have no problem<br/>
with people being gay, but it kind of set the stage for my relationship with<br/>
these people.  I have always been very proud and very straightforward with<br/>
the members about my religious and educational beliefs and practices.  There<br/>
are a few families that suddenly don&#39;t speak to us but for the most part, we<br/>
have been very much welcomed.  I was allowed to write a little article for<br/>
the support groups newsletter, &quot;A day in the life&quot; kind of thing, and was<br/>
contacted by another family that is interested in beginning unschooling.  I<br/>
was asked to direct the teen drama group&#39;s Spring play and run 3 4-H<br/>
projects with kids from the support group.  I teach karate and much of my<br/>
student base is made up of kids and adults from this group.  Of course, I<br/>
also would gently but insistently not allow any of them to &quot;dis&quot; my family.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly it is ok, sometimes my kids feel sorry for the other kids who can&#39;t<br/>
celebrate Halloween, can&#39;t have a Christmas tree because mom just discovered<br/>
it had pagan roots (no pun intended), can&#39;t watch Harry Potter, can&#39;t date<br/>
but must court, can&#39;t play because haven&#39;t finished PE, can&#39;t dance, ad<br/>
nauseum.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I do believe that I am quite spiritual,  but I don&#39;t know what church I <br/>
belong in or if I do belong in any church. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Same here!<br/>
I like Unity for that reason....it doesn&#39;t preach any doctrine or anything. <br/>
Just there as an aid in your personal spiritual journey.<br/>
But I don&#39;t go to church anymore either.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know of a book specifically about many world religions, but a great <br/>
book for children (and adults!) is the DK one called &quot;Celebrations&quot; in their <br/>
&quot;Children just like me&quot; series.  It shows wonderful, full color photographs <br/>
of regular kids in other countries and talks about their biggest celebration.<br/>
From Carnival in Brazil to Rahsha Bandhan in Suman, you get a feel for many <br/>
cultural celebrations and the beliefs surrounding them. Which involves a lot <br/>
of religion in many cases.<br/>
It&#39;s a great intro. and the beautiful photographs make it a lot of fun.<br/>

  Usborne books has a pretty decent new full-colour book called &quot;World Religions&quot; or &quot;Religions of the World&quot; --covers all the major world religions and some smaller ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-848973300">I want to know how others help their children come to religion.  I <br/>
have had books in the house about a few religions and read them to <br/>
the boys so when they hear things they are not confused and get <br/>
slammed with other people&#39;s opinions and told what to believe. (The <br/>
right or wrong thing)  They have relatives that are VERY religious <br/>
and have felt a bit out of place (cousins telling them they are <br/>
going to hell because they don&#39;t believe) and I try to tell them <br/>
that MANY people believe in various things and whatever they choose <br/>
to believe is fine.  Last year Justice was of a Shamanic nature <br/>
while Credence loved Jewish traditions.  This year their best friend <br/>
has made it quite clear that they *need* to believe in god and the <br/>
boys made a decision to attend the AWANA program with their friend.  <br/>
I have no problems with this because they do have fun and it&#39;s their <br/>
choice, but I do hate that to get the merits they have to memorize <br/>
things that they don&#39;t really believe in.  They ask me if it&#39;s ok <br/>
that they don&#39;t believe but still go because they like to play the <br/>
games and get the candies and are now confused about what to <br/>
believe.  They think just because this group is telling them to <br/>
believe that they somehow have to even though they don&#39;t want to.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know how to help them get over this peer pressure.  Any advice <br/>
would be greatly received.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659733792">Sounds like you are doing o.k. by explaining that different people believe<br/>
different things.  Do you believe anything?  If you do, you could share that<br/>
with them too.  I have come to realize over the years, that you can be a<br/>
spiritual person without being a religious person.  I took my kids to a very<br/>
open accepting small church for a few years because I felt some sense of<br/>
duty to do it. (I am glad I was able to let that go.) They liked it while I<br/>
taught the religious ed,  but when I had had my fill of that,  they decided<br/>
they didn&#39;t want to go anymore, so we stopped.  My kids went to Awana with<br/>
some friends for a while and it made me really uncomfortable.  I was there<br/>
with them when they explained to them (around Halloween) how witches are<br/>
real and you could have someone who is a witch living right beside you, how<br/>
a witch is a worker of the devil etc.  It was scare tactics to get them to<br/>
believe what that church believes and that started some interesting<br/>
conversations between us but it made me very uncomfortable.  They went as<br/>
long as they wanted to but when they started to want to stay home, I didn&#39;t<br/>
push it.  I was glad that they stopped.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I taught my kids to pray (their own words, mostly thankful prayer) because I<br/>
feel prayer helps me to focus on the positive in my day.  They enjoy the<br/>
ritual of prayer before bed.  They know that different people believe<br/>
different things and if they want to explore different religions one day,<br/>
I&#39;ll help them to do that.  When I was finally able to let go of the guilt<br/>
of not going to church, it felt so good, so freeing. If you had asked me if<br/>
I went because I felt a sense of duty, I might have said no, but it was<br/>
there, beneath the surface somewhere.  I don&#39;t believe that God, in all his<br/>
power, could be a jealous or angry  or vengeful god who would be angry if<br/>
you missed Sunday service.  Those are human traits that we&#39;ve put upon our<br/>
image of God.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion, obviously,<br/>

<br/>
We talk about religion and churches and philosophies, but it hasn&#39;t been to <br/>
try to help them come to religion.   We have several kids&#39; books, and some of <br/>
those would be great for adults too.  Usborne&#39;s Religions of the World (I <br/>
think, some Usborne dealer feel free to name it and give us a price and e-mail, if <br/>
you want &lt;g&gt;) is very clear and wonderful, and deals with art/iconography even <br/>
in the borders of the pages of the different sections which is a valuable way <br/>
to show the depth of a religion&#39;s effect on the culture in which it exists.  <br/>
You can find your own religion or notice which are very foreign just by <br/>
flipping the pages of the book and not reading a word.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t know how to help them get over this peer pressure.  Any advice <br/>
<br/>
would be greatly received.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids think the pressure is just silly.  And it plays out in very silly <br/>
ways.  Holly has a friend who&#39;s the most religious person in her family of five.  <br/>
The mom is my friend, and she&#39;s the least religious of the five, which is all <br/>
very interesting in itself. &lt;g&gt;  The friend indicated that her dad didn&#39;t <br/>
want her listening to a certain song, so I turned off the radio.  The horribly <br/>
offensive song in question?  &quot;Under the Boardwalk.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When she was over during the season that Holly and Marty were playing the <br/>
Harry Potter cardgame, they wouldn&#39;t have dreamed of bringing it out while she <br/>
was over, but when a mention came up in passing (like &quot;We can&#39;t play Tuesday <br/>
because of the card tournament&quot; or &quot;I know that family from Harry Potter days&quot;), <br/>
the friend would hum loudly and look pointedly away to mask the very sound of <br/>
the words, or the very contact with someone who had had contact with something <br/>
about Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
Still, what they had in common made the relationship worth it for Holly.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s dropped off since, but from other factors.  That&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something about Holly and the Bible.  She really likes religious <br/>
questions and traditions, and is curious about them as history and human factors.  <br/>
She&#39;s asked lots of questions after certain Simpsons episodes that touch on <br/>
church and the Bible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030589860">I am an atheist.<br/>
<br/>
They know what I believe, and I think I have made it clear why I <br/>
believe the way I do.  But I think it&#39;s more important for them to <br/>
explore what they might believe in.  I would rather they come to their <br/>
own beliefs because they feel it in their being instead of because it <br/>
was what they were taught.<br/>
Thanks for the advice.<br/>

I&#39;ve also really enjoyed the Dorling Kindersley books on religion. We <br/>
have the Religions of the World book and the Children&#39;s Bible, and we&#39;ve <br/>
checked out Buddhism and Islam, I think it is, from the library. They&#39;ve <br/>
all been very interesting, packed with information and very well done, imo.<br/>
