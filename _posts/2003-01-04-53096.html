&gt; time I try to cook something new.  I need more encouragement!  I&#39;ll take<br/>
&gt; fake encouragement if that&#39;s all I can get.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; While I (sometimes) appreciate honesty, the time may have come to have a<br/>
&gt; talk with my son about tact at the dinner table.<br/>

I personally appreciate all the new things you&#39;ve been trying in your<br/>
kitchen, even though I&#39;ve never eaten there.  I think it&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
If nobody ever tried new recipes, there would be no market for cooking<br/>
mazagines and cookbooks.  Since I like those things, I appreciate anyone<br/>
who&#39;s working to keep the machinery rolling!<br/>
