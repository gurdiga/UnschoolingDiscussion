<div id="ygrps-yiv-714658615">Yup, Yup you&#39;re right Lynda!.......and I have some<br/>
more opinions, but I always suspect that there are<br/>
cyber monitors cued to pick up on and trace key<br/>
phrases or words. Having been a teen in the late<br/>
sixties, I tend to be hyper-alert to Big Brother. <br/>
<br/>
When my DS#3 did a cyber-search on the Brady Law a few<br/>
years ago I kept expecting the Tobacco, Alcohol and<br/>
Firearms folk to tap on (bust in)the door. <br/>
<br/>
Must be that independent pioneering spirit that allows<br/>
us all to explore so many avenues of thought and to<br/>
choose our own way(s) of of expression. I am HAPPY to<br/>
be made aware of the many points of view available to<br/>
such beautiful families.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Sharon<br/>

&gt; I myself believe in our forefathers &quot;right to bear arms.&quot; If guns were<br/>
&gt; outlawed only outlaws would have guns! Studies can be and are often skewed<br/>
&gt; to the studiers opinons. Guns have a real and necessary place in our culture<br/>
&gt; and I believe total removal from a childs experience would only cause undue<br/>
&gt; curiosity and future problems.<br/>
&gt; I think it might be a good idea to drop the gun issue. We all have widely<br/>
&gt; different opinons and this topic is getting heated.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love this topic, because I don&#39;t feel strongly that guns are a great thing<br/>
or an evil thing, BUT I know quite a bit about them &quot;by osmosis&quot; from my<br/>
husband.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, by the way (the gun rights advocate) asked me read the WHOLE<br/>
amendment once when I off-the-cuff mentioned it to someone (he, my husband,<br/>
was a little embarrassed about the way I threw it out there, the same way I,<br/>
Pit Bull defender, would be embarrassed if he told someone Pit Bulls were<br/>
harmless). The &quot;right to bear arms&quot; is only a sound bite. Wally agrees with<br/>
the anti-gun crowd that the founding fathers MAY (or may not, but may) have<br/>
meant firearms only for well-regulated militias, not every Tom, Dick and<br/>
Pam. And it doesn&#39;t mean he agrees with the founding fathers if this was<br/>
their intent &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I think in debate that giving out bumper sticker slogans like &quot;if guns were<br/>
outlawed only outlaws would have guns&quot; (which isn&#39;t true anyway, police and<br/>
military would have them, no matter what other laws were made) isn&#39;t helpful<br/>
to your cause. And anyway, my favorite is, &quot;I will fight for the right to<br/>
keep and arm bears!&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196577435">i agree with this....i sort my mail by subject. if there&#39;s a topic i&#39;m not <br/>
interested in or have no info to share, i delete it. this back and forth on <br/>
the gun issue is really helping me. i&#39;m the one who posed the question and <br/>
i&#39;m in a transition with a lot of things with my son. there are only 2 people <br/>
in my personal environment who i relate to on parenting issues, and they&#39;re <br/>
anti gun. so having this forum really opens a lot of doors for me to listen <br/>
to different opinions.<br/>

everytime it got heated we would be dropping lots of them! I just got back <br/>
into town after a few days away and maybe it has petered out by now, but I <br/>
like the explorations of issues and trying on different points of view to see <br/>
if they fit for me, or if any part of them fits. .. .<br/>
