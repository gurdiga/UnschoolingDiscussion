<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804318454">I suggest, if they can afford it, they leave town.  Blow off the end  of the <br/>
school year, be a thousand miles away (or at least 200).  Go to some  place of <br/>
interest to him, eat in interesting cafes, watch cable TV in some air  <br/>
conditioned hotel room, sleep, smile...<br/>
 <br/>
Her sorrow and fear are tearing him up.  His teen-stuff (and school  <br/>
ruination) are tearing her up.  They need time off and away from that just  as if they <br/>
had broken legs or horrible pneumonia or both.  They need to be  in a <br/>
different environment (like a hospital, but a hotel is cheaper) and have  some time <br/>
to breathe different air without the same routine that&#39;s dragging them  into a <br/>
pit.<br/>
