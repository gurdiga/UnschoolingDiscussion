You&#39;re not going to say ANYTHING about Christianity that I don&#39;t already <br/>
understand.<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to be arrogant, just to let you know it&#39;s been one of the main <br/>
things I&#39;ve followed in my life, asking people of all denominations what and <br/>
why, reading the histories of sects and why changes came about.  I know the <br/>
Bible very well, and stories about various translations.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can say &quot;I&quot; but you can&#39;t say &quot;we&quot; about Christians.<br/>
<br/>
I can give you websites about the fear of God if you want, or I can spare you <br/>
that &quot;horror.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380065509">I personally don&#39;t think of them contradicting one another. As I said my MIL is a Christian but also believes people come back again and again to learn new lessons, a lot of times they want to comeback sometimes it is a lesson in the fact of &quot;what you do to others you may get back&quot;<br/>
It tied together for her {we were just talking about this today} some of the going ons in the world some of the bad things that happens to kids {as she puts it they are souls after all} they may have to have that experience to realize they shouldn&#39;t do it to others {form of hell as it were}<br/>
Anyway it&#39;s not saying people don&#39;t go someplace after death, pagans call Heaven, Summerland {all our pets and loved ones are welcome} and some stay and some after a while there decide {or however your beliefs understand it, } God may send them back. <br/>
I personally don&#39;t think of it as much as instant I think there is a waiting period where some may go to &quot;Heaven&quot; . But that is totally my views and I can&#39;t speak for anyone, other then to say on that she and I very much agree.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116517544">I obey God becaues I love Him, not because I fear hell if I don&#39;t <br/>
obey.  I&#39;m sure fear of hell had something to do with my decision to <br/>
become saved as a child, but now that I am saved and know I can&#39;t <br/>
lose that salvation, fear of going to hell isn&#39;t a factor. <br/>
<br/>
This reminds me of a Christian song I haven&#39;t listened to in a long <br/>
time: <br/>
<br/>
No excuse, no one to blame, no where to hide<br/>
The eyes of God have found my failure, found my pain <br/>
He understands my weaknesses and knows my shame,<br/>
But His heart never leaves me<br/>
<br/>
Chorus:<br/>
It&#39;s your kindness that leads us to repentence, Oh Lord<br/>
Knowing that You love us, no matter what we do<br/>
Makes us want to love you too<br/>
(repeat)<br/>
<br/>
Waiting for angry words to sear my soul<br/>
Knowing that I don&#39;t deserve another chance,<br/>
But suddenly the kindest words I&#39;ve ever heard<br/>
Come flooding from God&#39;s heart<br/>
<br/>
One aspect of this strict Christian parents thread that I haven&#39;t <br/>
seen anyone point out is that there are degrees of strictness among <br/>
Christians.  I grew up in a denomination called Evangelical Free.  <br/>
Definitely fundamental, believing in inerrancy of Scripture, <br/>
salvation through faith, would agree with the statement of faith <br/>
homeschoolers in theology.   In denominations such as this, the <br/>
parents are often spankers (although not always).  However, they&#39;re <br/>
the James Dobson style-spankers and not the Pearl To train up a child <br/>
style-spankers.  That might sound like a slight difference--after all <br/>
a spanker is a spanker.  But there IS a difference.  I really think <br/>
that the no mercy style of the pearls is MUCH worse.  Kids in those <br/>
denominations often go to Christian schools but just as often go to <br/>
public school (and more and more are starting to homeschool too of <br/>
course).  But kids are more often than not allowed to listen to <br/>
regular radio music (although Christian contemporary is encouraged), <br/>
watch r rated movies, etc.  They are ok with different versions of <br/>
the Bible.  They often have modern praise choruses and praise bands. <br/>
<br/>
Then, you have what my family would have called &quot;legalistic&quot; <br/>
Christians.  They are the independent Baptist churches, among <br/>
others.  King James version only.  No rock music, even if it&#39;s <br/>
Christian, because the evil is in the rhythm.  Women must wear <br/>
dresses so that they don&#39;t look like men.  Women must submit to their <br/>
husbands.  Women must not work. Women must never teach a man.   <br/>
Children are spanked with rods if they even question a command.  <br/>
Sometimes women wear headcoverings, sometimes not.  Children are <br/>
taught they must not date, only court.   Two year olds are made to <br/>
memorize Scripture.  Absolutely no alcohol.  These are the families <br/>
you read about in those Christian horror story links that were <br/>
posted.  MOST evangelical, fundamental Christians would read those <br/>
links and be disgusted.  The horror story links don&#39;t represent most <br/>
fundamental Christians.  <br/>
<br/>
So when looking for a name, most in Christian circles would use the <br/>
word legalistic to describe the ones responsible for the horror <br/>
stories.  <br/>

from the outside but not from the inside:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Legalism: <br/>
&gt;  * The belief that one&#39;s salvation depends upon strictly following religious<br/>
&gt; laws and rituals.<br/>
&gt;  * The belief that salvation is at least partly dependent on one&#39;s good works.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I remember they made it very clear that salvation was given freely and<br/>
didn&#39;t depend on anything but accepting Jesus Christ as your personal<br/>
savior. All the other stuff is done out of love of God because that&#39;s the<br/>
way God wants them to live. (From the outside it looks like one up manship<br/>
to show who loves God the most.)<br/>
<br/>
They call themselves Christian. And if your beliefs don&#39;t jive with theirs<br/>
then they&#39;re True Christians and you aren&#39;t Christian at all.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re the ones the anger and upsetness should be directed at. You should<br/>
be angry at them for appropriating a word that has meaning for you, not at<br/>
the people who are just calling them what they call themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-535464511">Here&#39;s something from the Religous Tolerance website about hell and some<br/>
statistics about numbers of Christians. This is a really good page and<br/>
discusses the basics of the main segments of Christianity. In fact the whole<br/>
site is really great.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://religioustolerance.org/chr_intr.htm">http://religioustolerance.org/chr_intr.htm</a><br/>
A prime belief: life after death:<br/>
<br/>
Christian beliefs about one&#39;s destination after death vary greatly:<br/>
<br/>
* Many conservative Protestant Christians believe that people are born and<br/>
remain sinful; they will end up being eternally punished in Hell unless they<br/>
are &quot;saved&quot; by trusting Jesus as Lord and Savior. <br/>
<br/>
* Roman Catholics also believe that salvation comes from God. But they<br/>
believe that it is channeled through church sacraments to sinful but<br/>
repentant persons. Most people, at death, go to Purgatory, which is a type<br/>
of temporary Hell; a few go directly to Heaven; others go permanently to<br/>
Hell.<br/>
<br/>
* Religious liberals generally interpret hell symbolically, not as an actual<br/>
place. They reject the concept of a loving God creating a place of eternal<br/>
torment.<br/>
<br/>
Current status of Christianity:<br/>
<br/>
About 33% of the world&#39;s population regard themselves as Christian. This<br/>
percentage has been stable for decades. (The second most popular religion is<br/>
Islam at about 20%. It is growing. If its present growth rate continues, it<br/>
will to become the dominant religion of the world during in a few decades.)<br/>
About 75% of American adults and a similar number of Canadians identify<br/>
themselves as Christian. This number has recently been dropping about one<br/>
percentage point per year. This is mainly due to:<br/>
<br/>
* The sudden increase in non-theists, such as Agnostics, Atheists,<br/>
Humanists, etc. They are growing about one percentage point per year.<br/>
<br/>
* An increase in the numbers of followers of minority religions, largely<br/>
caused by immigration from regions of the world which are predominantly<br/>
Buddhist, Hindu, and Muslim.<br/>
<br/>
* The emergence of new spiritual/religious movements like New Age, Wicca and<br/>
other Neopagan religions. Wicca, for example, is doubling in size about<br/>
every 30 months. <br/>
<br/>
Christianity in North America is a severely divided faith, consisting of <br/>
over 1,000 denominations, which are often categorized into conservative,<br/>
mainline and liberal wings:<br/>
<br/>
* Many Fundamentalist and other Evangelical Christians regard saved<br/>
individuals as the only true Christians. They maintain separate religious<br/>
denominations, radio stations, publishing houses, book stores, local<br/>
ministerial associations, etc -- even exercise videos. They tend to look<br/>
upon Christianity as a living relationship with their Savior. <br/>
<br/>
* Mainline Christians tend to be much more inclusive. They accept as<br/>
Christian anyone who follows the teachings of and about Jesus Christ.  <br/>
<br/>
* Liberal Christians agree with mainline Christians, and are even more<br/>
inclusive. Some liberal theologians, particularly those who are members of<br/>
the Jesus Seminar, have abandoned or completely reinterpreted most<br/>
traditional Christian beliefs.<br/>

all kinds of stuff.  Whether Christians who unschool understand it all or <br/>
not, it&#39;s all out there.  So grumping at US about it is like looking for <br/>
money under a streetlight in the whole wrong town.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1214756182">I&#39;m asking, not attacking:<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe God punishes people? Do you believe in hell?<br/>
I&#39;m wondering about what it means when people say they are Christians <br/>
who believe in a loving God - and don&#39;t fear Him.<br/>
<br/>
I can get the idea of both - love and fear can go hand-in-hand, of <br/>
course. I understand God as a parent who both loves and punishes, for <br/>
His children&#39;s own good. I have trouble understanding how anybody can <br/>
be Christian but say there is no fear involved...just wondering what <br/>
they do with the stuff in the Bible about God punishing and what they <br/>
think happens to people who don&#39;t accept Jesus, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Or do you mean you don&#39;t fear Him because you are saved and so you <br/>
don&#39;t need to fear Him? But the rest of us should? Or?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m asking for information - not arguing about it - trying to learn. <br/>
Please do not take anything I said here as an &quot;assumption&quot; - it is just <br/>

this discussion but my DH and I were talking about this last night.  I follow <br/>
the teachings of Jesus Christ, that is why I consider myself a Christian.  <br/>
But I believe that the Bible was written by man and thus should be taken with <br/>
a grain of salt, so to speak.  I think you need to consider the possibility <br/>
that man was doing the best he could to make sense out of what was being told <br/>
to him and written documentation needs to be viewed keeping in mind the <br/>
era/culture in which it is written.  I do not take the Bible literally but <br/>
use it as a guide.  I believe in God as the creator but do not think that <br/>
creation and evolution are mutually exclusive.  You don&#39;t have to believe in <br/>
just one.  For just one example.  I believe in Jesus born to Mary but don&#39;t <br/>
believe in the immaculate conception. I believe in a loving God that saw fit <br/>
to send Jesus as one messenger of peace, but possibly not the only messenger <br/>
(I say possibly as I have not really studied other religions) I don&#39;t believe <br/>
in Hell.  I don&#39;t believe that Christians are the only people that will <br/>
experience a glorious afterlife.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway this is WAY longer than I intended but I think it may give some <br/>
insight into what I believe and how someone could be Christian and not <br/>
believe in Hell etc. I think we need to make our own interpretations about <br/>
anything written.  And I hope my boys will learn that there are many ways to <br/>
see and interpret things.<br/>

These days, people with beliefs like yours aren&#39;t even considered real <br/>
Christians by the people we&#39;re talking about. I sit at the soccer field <br/>
and HEAR people say things like, &quot;Is she a Christian?&quot; And their point <br/>
is to exclude exactly what you&#39;ve described - they mean to exclude <br/>
those who don&#39;t believe the way they do. I know lots of people who are <br/>

<br/>
This kinda varies from language to language.  Christianity itself is <br/>
different in different languages, with the perceived distance between people <br/>
and God affected by the particular terminology used.  One reason it&#39;s so easy <br/>
to argue about it in English is that English has SO many words for the same <br/>
thing, being such a pack-rat language, so when English speakers argue about <br/>
&quot;grace and mercy&quot; or whatever, they often have no idea that in some other <br/>
languages Christians couldn&#39;t possibly argue it because they don&#39;t have so <br/>
many different ways it could have been translated.<br/>
<br/>
On the &quot;Dress to Kill&quot; DVD, there&#39;s a bonus performance, which Eddie Izzard <br/>
did in France, in French, and I was greatly amused to see he noted something <br/>
I noticed when I was studying French long ago.  <br/>
<br/>
Le mot pour le chrétien est comme le mot pour le crétin. <br/>
<br/>
In French. the word &quot;Christian&quot; is almost just like the word &quot;cretin.&quot;<br/>
Almost the same.<br/>

That typo&#39;s not going to happen in English but must happen in French lots.<br/>

after death.  I may call it &quot;Heaven&quot;  but, I cant really say what it will be <br/>

burning lake of fire.. brimstone, etc etc.  ( and this is my personal <br/>
interpretation)  I think that those words, descriptions, images, are the only <br/>
tangible things that the writers of the bible could come up with to describe <br/>
the feelings of despair and agony that we will feel if we are seperated from <br/>
God.    Hell could be many different things to different people, just like <br/>
Heaven could be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll keep my answers brief, since this probably isn&#39;t the forum for a <br/>
crash-course in Catholicism &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I do not believe that God punishes people; people punish themselves.  <br/>
If I deliberately hurt someone, any retribution or consequence of <br/>
that act, is my punishment.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that hell is the state of eternal separation from God; in <br/>
this state there is no light, no sound, no touch; you are completely <br/>
alone in an eternal void.<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, referencing another post, Purgatory is the state of <br/>
purification that a soul undergoes before entering the state of <br/>
heaven.  It is for those who die in God&#39;s grace, therefore assured of <br/>
salvation, but burdened by sin.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have trouble understanding how anybody can <br/>
&gt; be Christian but say there is no fear involved...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>God loves and God IS love.  You cannot fear love.  The word &quot;fear&quot;, <br/>
in Catholic teaching, is meant to convey the feeling of overpowering <br/>
awe and absolute reverence when contemplating the almighty being of <br/>
God.<br/>
<br/>
I love God because He has called me to love Him; I have felt His love <br/>
move in me, and my soul - my being, or essence - responds by loving <br/>
Him.<br/>

From the Catechism of the Catholic Church, Chapter 2, Article 3, <br/>
section 105:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The divinely revealed realities, which are contained and presented <br/>
in the text of Sacred Scripture, have been written down under the <br/>
inspiration of the Holy Spirit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Catholic Church teaches that:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In Sacred Scripture, God speaks to man in a human way.  To interpret <br/>
Scripture correctly, the reader must be attentive to what the human <br/>
authors truly wanted to affirm, and to what God wanted to reveal to <br/>
us by their words.<br/>
<br/>
In order to discover the sacred authors&#39; intention, the reader must <br/>
take into account the conditions of their time and culture, the <br/>
literary genres in use at that time, and the modes of feeling, <br/>
speaking, and narrating then current.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have already answered about my beliefs in Hell in another post in response <br/>
to someone else.  My posts are moderated, so, I apologize for the delay in <br/>
thier transmission.. It seems like my responses are untimely since they don&#39;t <br/>
post as soon as I send them.. Anyway, as to the rest of your question.  I do <br/>
not live in fear of God.  I DO believe that God has mighty, omnipotent power, <br/>
and he CAN bring his wrath on folks if he choses.. But, he is a loving and <br/>
forgiving God.  It is VERY much like the parent relationship you describe.  <br/>
My concept of God is just like the attachment parenting/unschooling ideals of <br/>
parenting.  We are good stewards, good ministers, good people in general beca<br/>
use we love God, we want to please him and bring  him Joy. WHY?  Well, its <br/>
simple, because he first showed ( and continues showing) his love for us.  He <br/>
is our role model.    When we are not &quot;good people&quot;, it hurts him, and it <br/>
hurts us to be seperated from God and to cause him greif.  It is really all <br/>
so simple.  It should be especially simple to unschooling folks.  If one has <br/>
a close, intimate relationship with God,  If one seeks him out, prays, reads <br/>
and communes with him, then the &quot;right&quot; way is easy to see.  Just like we <br/>
trust our children to make the right choices because we have talked with <br/>
them, loved them, modeled for them,  God trusts us to do what is right  if we <br/>
walk and talk with him.  We &quot;are good people&quot; out of principle, not out of <br/>
fear.<br/>
<br/>
Now, granted, I fall VERY short of this goal often.. It seems I fall short of <br/>
it most often on this list.  I can&#39;t say exactly why, but something &quot;here&quot; <br/>
seems to   bring out the worst in me.   I was recently blessed to be a part <br/>
of a physical manifestation of the love of Christ, and the love of the Body <br/>
of Christ for others.   I suppose this spirtual renewal caused me to take <br/>
offense at the labeling of &quot;Christians&quot; in a category with folks who <br/>
restrict, control, and abuse thier children.   And, that resentment caused me <br/>
act in an un Christian manner.  I apologize for not being a better example.  <br/>
As I said earlier, its a continuing process to be a better person. <br/>

Believer which is basically what you said here <br/>
&quot; I think we need to make our own interpretations about anything written.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
As we are each our own &quot;priest&quot;, we are given the authority to interpret the <br/>
scriptures as we understand them.  And, we are not required to have a &quot;middle <br/>
man&quot; between ourselves and God.. We have a direct line straight to him <br/>
through prayer and meditation.  God does speak to us through others, through <br/>
nature, music, etc,.. But he also speaks to us directly as we are priests in <br/>
his eyes.  ( IF we believe in him)<br/>
<br/>
All that is JMO<br/>

Orwell kind of tweaked it with _1984_.<br/>
<br/>
I remember when we had the restaurant and an unpleasant, vulgar, unsually <br/>
drunk, REGULAR guest named Thurmond Brandon. Our head waiter, Jerome, used to <br/>
say that HIS version of hell was to repeatedly explain the dessert cart to <br/>
Thurmond Brandon! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt; I believe that hell is the state of eternal separation from God; in <br/>
<br/>
this state there is no light, no sound, no touch; you are completely <br/>
<br/>
alone in an eternal void. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That sounds heavenly to me.<br/>
<br/>
I told the last Jehovahs Witnesses I talked to that if one of the options was <br/>
a quiet dark grave, I&#39;d like that one, please.<br/>
<br/>
They want me to want eternity, but I get tired, y&#39;know?  And if the lights go <br/>
permanently out, for how long and with what biochemistry would I mourn?  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t even get out the last famous-last word.  I hear the most common last <br/>
word is &quot;Shit.&quot;<br/>

preserved from original sin at the time of her conception.<br/>
