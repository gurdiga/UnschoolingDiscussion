<div id="ygrps-yiv-1050452372">Hello everyone.  I&#39;m a new member but have been watching the list off and on for a couple weeks now.  I am a single mother of a 13 year old son who is finishing up seventh grade this year at public school.  We are both completely fed up with the public school system and want out.  I&#39;ve been doing some reading/researching on homeschooling, which is how I discovered the concept of unschooling.  I am completely intrigued by the idea and really wish that I had learned about it years ago when my son was still young.  I am concerned that it may be too late now for it to be of value to him.  <br/>
<br/>
I am determined that this is going to be his last year in public school, but I&#39;m facing several challenges, not the least of which is that I have to work full time to support us.  I am desperately trying to find a way to make a living from home, which has always been my goal/dream anyway, but so far nothing viable has come to light.  Even if my son has to stay home by himself during the day, I still feel that he will be better off than he currently is in the school system.<br/>
<br/>
From the posts I&#39;ve read thus far, it seems as though most of you either have younger children or started your children with homeschooling/unschooling at a young age.  Do any of you have any advice about starting with a young teenager and how to move from a schooling type of mentality to a self-learning mentality?  He is a very intelligent child, but he has absolutely no motivation to put it to use at this stage in his life.  Considering some of the things I&#39;ve been learning recently about the school system I can understand why, but I&#39;d like to help him overcome that.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the other major question I have is, is it possible to make this work for him if I&#39;m not able to be home with him during the day?  As much as I desperately want to be, I have to pay the bills somehow, so there is a strong possibility that it just won&#39;t work out that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Chris</div>
