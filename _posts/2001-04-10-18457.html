<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808731610">I haven&#39;t read &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; yet, but I&#39;ve heard so many good things<br/>
about it, it&#39;s on my &quot;must read&quot; list. As a child in a small semi-rural<br/>
Oregon town (&lt;2000 people), we had pretty much unlimited freedom. Sometimes<br/>
I&#39;m surprised that we didn&#39;t really get hurt - not by kidnappers or child<br/>
molesters but just because we were in dangerous places with no adult<br/>
supervision - old mine shafts, old wells, etc. were all over the places that<br/>
we played. One of the mine shafts that we played in collapsed (fortunately<br/>
not while anyone was in it). But I digress.... one of our goals for moving<br/>
here was to be in a community where we will eventually feel safe with our<br/>
children having freedom. Living here, we often see kids walking or riding<br/>
their bicycles alone or in groups, and I like seeing that. Our own<br/>
neighborhood is very community-like and people know and watch out for<br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
The things we do that I think will help our children out the most to keep<br/>
them safe...<br/>
<br/>
1) We respect our own boundaries, so we teach respect. Even with my (18<br/>
m.o.) daughter, I will politely say &quot;I don&#39;t want you to touch me there,<br/>
that&#39;s private, that makes me uncomfortable&quot;. Or if DH and I are argueing<br/>
and it gets a little too heated, I will say &quot;I don&#39;t like the way you&#39;re<br/>
talking to me, I don&#39;t want to be around that right now&quot; and I&#39;ll walk into<br/>
another room. Showing our kids how to have self-respect, and politely but<br/>
firmly deal with others crossing our boundaries is a good first step<br/>
<br/>
2) We respect our children and their bodies. If they don&#39;t want to be<br/>
hugged, kissed, tickled, rough-housed, we don&#39;t do it. We respect their &quot;no&quot;<br/>
and we are advocates for them with others until they&#39;re old enough to do it<br/>
themselves. Even with our own relatives, we have had to occasionally say<br/>
&quot;Mom, Mackenzie is saying he doesn&#39;t want to be kissed and I&#39;d like you to<br/>
respect that&quot;. My son is naturally very protective of his body. Even when he<br/>
was 2, and I was going to the YMCA, the nursery workers there got a bit<br/>
peeved that he wouldn&#39;t let them change his diaper. I just told them<br/>
&quot;Respect his wishes, you can call me at anytime to change him if it&#39;s<br/>
necessary. I don&#39;t mind at all&quot;. Personally, I&#39;m glad that even at such a<br/>
young age, he was adamant about his body limits. My daughter on the other<br/>
hand would probably walk off contentedly hand-in-hand with a stranger and<br/>
only miss me when it was &quot;nummy&quot; time :-).<br/>
<br/>
3) We always let them know that they can tell us anything, and they will not<br/>
be blamed, shamed, or punished. This is something a child can only learn<br/>
after years of consistent behavior from the parents.<br/>
<br/>
4) We are with them, or people we trust are with them at all times. This<br/>
means that they&#39;re never left alone with even many of our close family<br/>
members. They do go to the nursery at our gym, but it has glass windows and<br/>
I can observe them anytime I wish during my workout.<br/>
<br/>
So they know from example and verbalizing that they can respect their<br/>
bodies, that we will respect their bodies, that they can tell others to<br/>
respect their bodies, and that we will be advocates for them to others about<br/>
their own limits. As far as trusting us, we have always given them the<br/>
message that they can trust us implicitly. I&#39;ve thought a lot about what<br/>
someone posted this week about telling their kids to go to someone else if<br/>
they felt their own parents weren&#39;t treating them right. That was great food<br/>
for thought and discussion. I think for us, that wouldn&#39;t be the right thing<br/>
to do (though I respect that it may be for others). We put in a lot of work<br/>
preparing to be parents (not that you&#39;re ever fully prepared, LOL) and both<br/>
my husband and I feel that if didn&#39;t trust ourselves to always do the right<br/>
thing for our kids (to the best of our knowledge) then we would not have<br/>
made the decision to have kids. In fact, for years I didn&#39;t want to have<br/>
kids because I wasn&#39;t in that place in my head where I thought I would be a<br/>
good parent. So we came to parenthood later than some (though earlier than<br/>
many, esp. these days), but fully trusting in ourselves to be good and just<br/>
parents. If we ever knew that we were hurting our kids, we would seek help<br/>
ourselves, I know this. I feel strongly that the initial parent-child<br/>
attachment is the bond of safety from which all other good relationships<br/>
spring. I don&#39;t want them to lose the magic of being able to totally rely on<br/>
that bond without question. At some point in their lives they will have to<br/>
have more complex and questioning relationships (with us as well as with<br/>
others), but the ultimate innocence, trust, and intimacy that they bring to<br/>
this initial one is unique, I feel I don&#39;t want to change that.<br/>
