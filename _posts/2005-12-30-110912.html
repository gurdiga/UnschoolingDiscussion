<div id="ygrps-yiv-439119097">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I have very little money right now, especially after Christmas!!!<br/>
<br/>
Can you give me some ideas for what I can do to keep life interesting around here on a daily basis?  My kids are 10, 13, and 17.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks1<br/>

There are probably lots of internet sites with projects and &quot;boredom  <br/>
busters&quot; and ideas for things to do on car rides (that wouldn&#39;t need  <br/>
a car ride).<br/>

Are you urban, suburban, rural or remote?   <br/>
<br/>
Hiking is a year round activity and it&#39;s free.  If you live where weather<br/>
conditions are extreme go prepared and tell someone where you&#39;re going,<br/>
but really all you need for a good time is an adventurous attitude and<br/>
some food.  <br/>
There&#39;s probably a book at your library with maps for day hikes, or you<br/>
can blaze your own trail.   If you have deep snow borrow snowshoes. <br/>
<br/>
Collect some movies from the library and have a movie marathon.  We<br/>
recently watched The Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness.   <br/>
<br/>
Get random music CD&#39;s from the library and listen to stuff you&#39;ve never<br/>
heard before.  <br/>
<br/>
Borrow a video camera and make a movie.  There&#39;s a great movie on Encore<br/>
this month called &quot;The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra.&quot;  It will inspire you.<br/>
(Or make you sick, could go either way.&lt;g&gt;)    <br/>
<br/>
Can you make a fire in your back yard and roast marshmallows?  Do you<br/>
live near a park that has a fire pit?  <br/>
<br/>
Google your town and state for an events calendar, see if anything<br/>
appeals to you.   We have found star parties, concerts, plays, frontier<br/>
challenge events,  tours, all kinds of things.  <br/>
<br/>
Have friends over.  You don&#39;t have to cook a big fancy meal.  Put out<br/>
some snacks, play games, listen to music, talk, dance, tell jokes. <br/>
<br/>
Borrow some new games from friends or find some different ones at the<br/>
thrift store. <br/>
<br/>
Paint a mural on a wall in your kitchen.  (or somewhere)  We painted<br/>
pictographs on the basement walls. <br/>
Paint teeny little spiders on your window sills or lizards on your<br/>
ceilings.  Paint a naked guy on your shower door with tempura paints. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have snow, build a snow man.  Give him two heads or six arms. <br/>
Shoot arrows at him when your finished.  Put a hatchet in his head and<br/>
spray him with red food coloring.    Make snow corpses on your front<br/>
lawn.  Or a herd of zombies.  Take pictures and send them to your<br/>
newspaper.  Or if you&#39;re not so gruesome, build a polar bear or a snow<br/>
totem pole.   We made snow geese one year.  They were beautiful.  <br/>
<br/>
Fill large storage containers with water and let them freeze, then carve<br/>
ice sculptures.  (ask Bruce Campbell to help. &lt;snort&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
Tell us where you live, you might get better ideas.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897866555">LOL...<br/>
<br/>
We do many of the things you suggested routinely.  I had to laugh at the fire in the backyard and roasting marshmallows!  We do that a lot in the summer.<br/>
<br/>
I live in PA, no snow right now.  And we do have trails etc, but none of us love to be out in this weather.  We live along a river, and railroad tracks.  We are in a rural area, a small river town.<br/>
<br/>
I am itching to up and go to Washington DC where all the museums are free.  You know what?  maybe we&#39;ll just do that!<br/>
<br/>
The kids&#39; current interests are burning cd&#39;s (we just got a new burner, the other one didn&#39;t work).  I&#39;ve been looking for legal websites to use for downloading.<br/>
<br/>
They also do a LOT with IM and Xanga.  Sometimes neopets.<br/>
<br/>
AND...they love food.  Maybe I&#39;ll capitalize on that by having us try out different kinds of foods and different kinds of cooking based on different countries/cultures.<br/>
<br/>
We have friends overnight routinely.  Sometimes I buy new things to eat for breakfast, like cinamon rolls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Currently I&#39;m trying to download pan flute music so I can play it during the day.  I want to hear all kinds of music.<br/>
<br/>
I love movies, so I will check out the one you mentioned, sounds like a good one!<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of museums etc around here, but at the moment many of them cost more money than I have.  There is one free one in Harrisburg.  Maybe we&#39;ll go there next week.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps. These are many of the routine things we do, though not every day.  And yet the kids complain they are bored.  I want to spice it up but I&#39;m not sure how.<br/>

Many museums have a reciprocal policy with membership that allow free <br/>
access to museums in other areas. Some people have been successful in <br/>
keeping costs down by joining museums in a far-away city and having <br/>
reciprocal membership with more than one museum in their home city. From <br/>
what I understand, they simply went online to research reciprocal <br/>
memberships and found the city with the lowest membership fee to join <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
We just join museums in our own area and more than make up the <br/>
membership fee by going just 2 or 3 times over the course of the year, <br/>
and we travel enough that we&#39;re almost always able to use our <br/>
memberships in other cities.<br/>
<br/>
IMO, memberships are more than worth the cost in the freedom they <br/>
provide to go at our own pace, see only what we&#39;re interested in or feel <br/>
up to in the moment--especially wonderful for young kids who don&#39;t have <br/>
the interest or stamina to do whirlwind tours. I&#39;ve always just figured <br/>
that school-at-homers are spending a fortune on canned curriculum; <br/>
membership fees are just part of our &quot;curriculum&quot; costs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677601474">We used to have a reciprocal membership but the museums that offer this have become kind of &quot;boring&quot; to us.  The closest ones don&#39;t change their stuff very often.  The exhibits that do change are small.<br/>

The ones I *wish* had reciprocal memberships (like the National Aquarium) don&#39;t.  I will look into it again though.  I wouldn&#39;t mind having it if it would be worthwhile.<br/>

membership in another city. Sometimes those will have reciprocal <br/>
membership with more than one museum in your home town.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure that would really play out, though, because those I belong <br/>
to are members of larger associations like Children&#39;s Museums or Science <br/>
Museums or Zoos, which don&#39;t really overlap within a given city.<br/>
<br/>
For someone like me, who lives equi-distant from 2 cities and relatively <br/>
close to a couple more, it can be worthwhile because I have multiple <br/>
options from which to choose.<br/>
<br/>
*shrug* Maybe worth looking into; maybe not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324164814">***...had to laugh at the fire in<br/>
the backyard and roasting marshmallows! We do that a lot in the<br/>
summer.***<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fun in the winter too!  But you said you don&#39;t like the outdoor<br/>
stuff so much... Really? &lt;g&gt;  No feeding ducks, no flying kites?  No<br/>
Frisbee on skates?   <br/>
<br/>
***I am itching to up and go to Washington DC where all the museums are<br/>
free.***<br/>
<br/>
Go! If you can afford the gas.  You can always take a cooler with snacks.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Antique shops, vintage clothing stores, art galleries and hobby shops are<br/>
free.  Take a camera to the vintage clothing store, try the clothes, take<br/>
pictures.  <br/>
Sit, read and browse at a book store or linger in the coffee shop. (with<br/>
cookies) <br/>
If you go to six different places in one afternoon you don&#39;t have to stay<br/>
at any one place long enough for it to become boring. <br/>
<br/>
Stop at a local cafe and share a big order of French fries. <br/>
<br/>
Ethnic restaurants, for a treat, when you can afford it, -maybe just<br/>
order the appetizers- are so fun because you get the atmosphere along<br/>
with the food.   And when you make different foods at home you could rent<br/>
corresponding movies to help supply atmosphere for your meal.    <br/>
<br/>
Have adult friends over for conversation.  Dylan enjoys our adult friends<br/>
I think more than some of our young friends.  Adults get to do more and<br/>
talk more freely about what they&#39;re doing than a lot of younger people.<br/>
(unless you&#39;re lucky enough to know lots of young unschoolers&lt;g&gt;)   Play<br/>
Buzzword or Taboo. <br/>
<br/>
Volunteer at the animal shelter one or two mornings a week, if your heart<br/>
can take it. <br/>
Become a foster parent to a puppy from the pound?   <br/>
<br/>
Dylan is lately interested in refinishing furniture and is just starting<br/>
on a little rocker.  <br/>
Maybe, if you have some wooden side chairs each of your kids could<br/>
customize one with paints.  We have a customized chair painted different<br/>
colors, and we&#39;ve written different quotes down the stiles and spindles<br/>
and on the seat and stretchers and crest rail.  It&#39;s quite artistic. (in<br/>
an &quot;oh my god what have we done to this nice old chair&quot; kind of way. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could bake cookies for all your friends and then go deliver them,<br/>
stay and visit and eat cookies. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
When we&#39;re feeling like a day isn&#39;t interesting enough we usually leave<br/>
the house.  Lots of times, destination unknown.&lt;g&gt; <br/>

<h4>Have a Nice Day!</h4>
<p><small><time>31 Dec 2005, at 11:07am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-145238420">Thank you..I&#39;ll be sure to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
I spent some time last night looking up stuff online &quot;things to do in......&quot;.  I found some interseting stuff that I wouldn&#39;t have thought of (how DO I get stuck in such ruts???).<br/>
<br/>
So, I wrote down a few for each month.  I want to take the kids on a tour through the Harely Davidson plant in York.  And the Farm Show is coming up, which I had forgotten about.  I never liked the farm show because its so dang crowded.  But thinking of it in a new light (all the opportunities) makes me like it more.  You have to pay for the farm show, but I don&#39;t think its a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the National Civil War museum.  I think its a bit pricey though so that might have to wait.<br/>
<br/>
And  I came across a contest to build a rollercoaster using rollercoaster tycoon.  If your rollercoaster is chosen to be built, you win 100,000 for college.  WOW.<br/>
<br/>
Then as I was looking through the schedule for Discovery Theater in Wash DC, I came across performers that are called &quot;Panmasters&quot; I think.  They do a steel drum routine, and they will be in PA in August I think at the Musikfest.  We will go see them.  I think that will be awesome.  They are also having a Pan Jamboree in May.  I don&#39;t know where though, so I have to wait and find out.  I&#39;d really like to go to that because it will be Steel drummers from all over NY, Baltimore, and Washington DC.  That ought to really be something to see!<br/>
<br/>
This is the first summer that I won&#39;t be working weekends, so I&#39;ll be able to take the kids to more festivals, etc.  but thats a few months from now.  So, I&#39;ll keep looking for stuff for now.<br/>

<br/>
  It is Boonshoft and I&#39;ve heard they have a very long list of other zoos, <br/>

  I love outdoor stuff, but not in the winter. BUT...you&#39;ve convinced me. I&#39;ll try it.  WHERE do you come up with all these wonderful ideas????  Im saving your emails!<br/>
<br/>
  It doesn&#39;t help either that the kids all sleep until past noon.  By the time they get up, there isn&#39;t much time to go do anything.  They hop on the computer, and then the day is gone.  And we get stuck in ruts like these for a long time.  <br/>
<br/>
  They did agree a while ago (before my semester break) to getting up earlier, like around 9:30/10.  So, maybe we&#39;ll give that a go and do these interesting things to keep us motivated (I&#39;m a night owl too when I&quot;m not teaching, so getting up early is rough for me too!).<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Antique shops, vintage clothing stores, art galleries and hobby shops are<br/>

  These are great ideas. Do you really manage 6??  Wow.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  LOL, yes, the appetizers, and that would be about it.  My kids will probably turn their noses up.  But this is something I&#39;d love to do just for fun.  We&#39;ll do it &quot;just for fun&quot; and not to eat when we&#39;re hungry, so that nobody feels like they are getting jipped out of a real meal.<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Volunteer at the animal shelter one or two mornings a week, if your heart<br/>
  can take it. <br/>
  Become a foster parent to a puppy from the pound? &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Oh my, no way.  I wanted to do this last year.  But I just can&#39;t see all those animals in cages.  HOWEVER.....We raised a litter of puppies this year, which was fun.  We have two left and I guess we&#39;re keeping them (yay!!)    <br/>
<br/>
  &gt;&gt;Dylan is lately interested in refinishing furniture and is just starting<br/>
  on a little rocker.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe we could find something like that at a thrift store and do it.  I&#39;ll check.  My girls would absolutely love that idea.  In fact, maybe we&#39;ll do that today.<br/>
<br/>
  Deb, I love your ideas!  I am downloading different kinds of music to play for when the kids get up in the mornings.  I figure maybe we&#39;ll hit upon something that sparks an interest.  I know it sparks mine!<br/>
  I have one daughter that wants to go to France, so maybe I&#39;ll expand on that a little bit too.<br/>

Contact your nearest French Consulate and get a list of their lending<br/>

We had snow all November and December until last week.   We built snow<br/>
dogs peeing on our bushes.  <br/>
It&#39;s forty two degrees and thawing here after two days of freezing rain,<br/>
but we did take the sled down the ice in my mom&#39;s driveway and I have the<br/>
bruises to prove it.  Dylan has one scraped and punctured elbow but all<br/>
in all it was a thrilling afternoon. &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
And in the hills there&#39;s always enough snow for sledding or snow shoeing<br/>
or cross country skiing, even in the sparse years.  This winter has been<br/>
the first really normal winter, with early snow for about nine years. <br/>
<br/>
I hear it&#39;s been an ok year for skiing, too, but I&#39;m not a downhill kind<br/>
of girl.  Bad knees. <br/>

Maybe you could do some of the same cheap-to-free things, but stop a  <br/>
while at each place and everyone do a sketch and date it.  Keep them  <br/>
in folders or a box or a drawer.  People will get better at drawing  <br/>
and you&#39;ll have a cool record of what you&#39;ve done and maybe a cool  <br/>
hobby.  And you could photocopy them and the paint on the photocopies  <br/>
for additional fun along the way.  One might become the art for a  <br/>
family letter or next year&#39;s Christmas card, or for a blog page or...<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t need fancy paper or fancy pencils.  Used clipboards from  <br/>
the thriftstore and any old paper and pencils (also probably  <br/>
available at the thrift store).<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve felt that way too.<br/>
Unschooling&#39;s not going to be absolutely cost-free nor should it be.<br/>
<br/>
If you had kids even in public school there would be absolute costs  <br/>
that you couldn&#39;t get around.  To spend less than you would spend if  <br/>
they were in public school is just not morally or ethically right.   <br/>
(Spending less than you would if they were in private school or  <br/>
daycare... heck yeah!)<br/>

The way a six year old sees a model train museum won&#39;t be the same  <br/>

Maybe you could split up, make sketches, come back and exchange them,  <br/>
and wander around and find what the other person drew.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to use a museum as it was intended.  Sometimes I used  <br/>
to make a map of a city park we were playing in, put it in a plastic  <br/>
sheet protector, and put an X on it with a crayon.  I&#39;d bury some  <br/>
plastic toy there in the sand, or hide it in or at the base of a  <br/>
tree, and then give the map to the kids (who had been doing something  <br/>
else).  They would have to figure out what direction to hold the map,  <br/>
and find the toy and then I&#39;d hide it again, wipe that X off with a  <br/>
tissue and put a new one on.  There are lots of ways to keep the same  <br/>
old park from being the same old thing.<br/>

yeah, it seems it can be fun!  We have some of their photos. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Do the photos near the dressing room, not posing on the street.  That  <br/>

By the time they get up, there isn&#39;t much time to go do anything-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an unfair argument.  Many of the suggestions were quite doable  <br/>
at night and later.<br/>
<br/>
People sometimes get into the habit of defending their positions to  <br/>
the point that they will say &quot;can&#39;t&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t work&quot; even to people  <br/>
they&#39;ve ASKED for ideas.  Hmmm.... think about that.  Because a list  <br/>
like this doesn&#39;t need to have people explaining exactly why the  <br/>
ideas won&#39;t work.  Once Deb pours forth her very-many brilliancies,  <br/>
we can all just wallow in the glorious possibilities.  No lists of  <br/>
why it won&#39;t work are helpful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My kids will probably turn their noses up. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Defeatism in advance is not the least bit of movement toward learning  <br/>
or experiencing.  The don&#39;t need to eat a single thing to have fun  <br/>
sitting in a restaurant with you.   And what if they taste  <br/>
something?  Cool.  Drinks and appetizers, I think was the general  <br/>
suggestion, not full expensive meals.  And IF a child doesn&#39;t like an  <br/>
expensive meal, it is possible (in the U.S.) to request a box to take  <br/>
it home in.   [Do not try this in Europe; there it&#39;s rude and nasty.]<br/>
<br/>
-=-If you go to six different places in one afternoon you don&#39;t have  <br/>
to stay<br/>
   at any one place long enough for it to become boring. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
  -=- These are great ideas. Do you really manage 6??  Wow.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;if.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In response to a claim that your kids were bored, someone said  <br/>
&quot;If...&quot; and you saw &quot;six.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The point was you don&#39;t have to go to a place for two or three hours  <br/>
and call it a big outing.  You could browse, shop-hop, count the  <br/>
lunch spot, the parking place, the walk in between them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We&#39;ll do it &quot;just for fun&quot; and not to eat when we&#39;re hungry, so  <br/>
that nobody feels like they are getting jipped out of a real meal.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is another indication of negativity.  Without even thinking of  <br/>
which restaurant, and with people SAYING to do it just for fun,  <br/>
you&#39;re bringing up the possibility of future feelings of deprivation.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t work from deprivation and assuredness of defeat.<br/>
Don&#39;t see a failure if you &quot;only manage five.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
See the joy in a moment when you step out of the house and the clouds  <br/>
are beautiful and the air feels sharp and clean, and a bird swoops  <br/>
by.  See the good and the timeless in that, rather than standing  <br/>
there blind to the world feeling deprived because your kid are still  <br/>
in bed and they won&#39;t like foreign food and you can&#39;t afford a museum.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  Maybe we could find something like that at a thrift store and do  <br/>
it.  I&#39;ll check.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Think (without telling us; it&#39;s not important to the list) what you  <br/>
meant by &quot;I&#39;ll check.&quot;  You&#39;ll ask the kids?  You&#39;ll call the store  <br/>
and ask?  Just go to the thrift store with your kids!  If you think  <br/>
you&#39;re looking only for a piece of furniture because some far-away  <br/>
kid named Dylan is said to be  messing with a little rocking chair,  <br/>
how many hundreds of things will you ignore?<br/>

&gt; Zoos too! If you go to the nearest (largish city) zoo, you should be able<br/>
&gt; to find info on becoming a *Friend of ____ Zoo* and a list of reciprocal<br/>

By the time they get up, there isn&#39;t much time to go do anything.**<br/>
<br/>
**My kids will probably turn their noses up.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The tone and content of these really rang a bell with me, because last <br/>
winter I was feeling similarly &quot;stuck&quot; and defeated.  People called me <br/>
on that on the list, which helped me realize that I was dipping down <br/>
into a bit of a seasonal depression.  (I put a lot of effort into <br/>
preventative steps this year, because I do tend to feel &quot;dark&quot; in the <br/>
dark part of the year.)<br/>
<br/>
My son&#39;s an evening person.  Even when he wakes up earlier, he&#39;s not <br/>
fired up and happy to do things in the first couple hours that he&#39;s up.  <br/>
It took me awhile to realize that he is more enthusiastic later in the <br/>
day.  This can be tricky as I&#39;m peppy from 7am to 11am-ish, and I tended <br/>
to slowly melt and stop offering things as the day went on.  (But one of <br/>
our most fun outings last year was an evening movie outdoors in the park.)<br/>
<br/>
Another difference between my son and me is that I&#39;m less content <br/>
staying home than he is. (I can only read email for so long!&lt;g&gt;)  One <br/>
way I can deal with that is to go out by myself when it is feasible.<br/>
<br/>
What can you offer the kids that you KNOW they wouldn&#39;t turn down?  My <br/>
son went through one age when it seemed like the only place he wanted to <br/>
go was the toy store.  We went there a lot, but didn&#39;t always make a <br/>
purchase.  Even when it seemed like he didn&#39;t want to go out at all, he <br/>
was always positive about going to parkday with friends and going to <br/>
friends houses.  I&#39;ve sometimes said that we don&#39;t go to many museums, <br/>
but the last time I offered my son a trip to the Monterey Aquarium he <br/>
literally jumped for joy, performing a fairly spectacular vertical <br/>
maneuver.  (This would be at least our 15th trip in 10 years.  Depth is <br/>
more appealing than breadth to some people.)<br/>
<br/>
(The dynamics are different if your kids want different things and are <br/>
competing rather than trying to cooperate.)<br/>
<br/>
Watch out for the potential trap of offering outings that are <br/>
&quot;improving&quot; or &quot;educational&quot; or that advance an agenda of your own.  (I <br/>
like errands that take me past the fabric store -- NOT a good way to <br/>
reinforce my son&#39;s enjoyment of the day. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>

PS  My brother&#39;s start-up company has an events database for the San <br/>
Francisco Bay Area that is searchable, and people in my neck of the <br/>
woods can use it for outing ideas.<br/>

Oh, I&#39;d join you in Columbi hell in a heartbeat.  I LOVE warmer weather but not <br/>
so hot that you roast either.<br/>
<br/>
What is your weather like most of the year.  Maybe we&#39;ll move there!<br/>
<br/>
-==-=-=-<br/>
Hot, Hot, and HOT. Columbia&#39;s built directly over the entrance to hell. We roast from <br/>
mid-April through October. Never a white Christmas---just 69 and sunny. Ice storms in January and February. <br/>
 <br/>
But today, I have on jeans and a t-shirt. Bare feet. <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t recommend it here. I&#39;m trying to move! &lt;g&gt; Western VA mountains keep calling my name, but we&#39;re <br/>
here for 5-10 more years. Ben&#39;s job is too good. We&#39;ll sit tight until the boys are out on their own.<br/>
 <br/>
But you&#39;re welocme to join me here! &lt;G&gt;  If you like HOT!<br/>

Your email rang true for me and my dd.  She often sleeps until noon or <br/>
so and my best time is in the am.  Because I have Fibromyalgia it is a <br/>
real struggle for me after 1 or 2 pm to get out and doing stuff.  I <br/>
make an effort, my dd loves to shop, she&#39;s 11.  We may not buy <br/>
anything but the time together is very precious to both of us.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not much of a museum person, but she wants to be a vet.  We have <br/>
been talking to our vet trying to find one that will let her volunteer <br/>
in their office.  Also, I&#39;ll check out the LA Zoo, they might be <br/>
willing to let us volunteer together.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra;  your post about the cost of PS or private school - how about <br/>
the cost of homeschool curriculum.  My dd was so unhappy the year I <br/>
brought her home, I tried all kinds of stuff.  It seemed that each <br/>
month I was ordering new curriculum.  The cost of any museum, zoo or <br/>
other activities including the cost of gas is far cheaper.  Let alone <br/>
the advantages of having a very happy child.</div>

I&#39;ve often had an internal dialogue about costs of things. When my <br/>
kids want to use up my kitchen flour and other ingredients <br/>
for &quot;experiments&quot;, my inner reaction is &quot;NO, that&#39;s food, it costs a <br/>
lot&quot;. Luckily logic kicks in and I think &quot;what would you pay for <br/>
something they were interested in learning about...what would <br/>
curriculum cost if we homeschooled?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So many things are really not that costly when you think of it that <br/>
way. We can have these inner &quot;talks&quot; without our kids ever knowing <br/>
too!:)<br/>
