<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457034539">I am becoming increasingly aware of the number of questions that are asked to me about my kids, in front of them.  <br/>
For ex.  I took one of my sons with me to the dentist today.  I had to have some work done and I knew it wouldnt take long.  He is not always comfortable talking to people.  The hygenist asked him a few questions, he really didnt answer but i tried to kind of help him. She was just trying to be nice and helpful. Then she asked me, &quot;is he shy?&quot;.  Honestly, I felt very uncomfortable.  I am becoming increasingly aware lately of how questions like that make him feel and the incident at the pool I wrote about last week started in much the same way.  How do you respond to a question like that.</div>

I would say &quot;Sometimes.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499574800">I sometimes answered, &quot;Sometimes he&#39;s reserved around people he doesn&#39;t know.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I felt like this answer might help the person realize that it was their expectations (&quot;all children happily talk to total strangers&quot;) that were off base, and not my son&#39;s reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I said, &quot;He likes to take some time to scope out new situations,&quot; as a way of helping people (and maybe me, and my son) see the positive side of a kid who didn&#39;t jump into things or conversations right away.<br/>
<br/>
You could ask your son, too, what would make him most comfortable in that situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1001280181">I understand how you are feeling. I get asked that about my daughter too. After it happening a few times I talked with my daughter about how she&#39;d like us/me to answer it. I asked her because I know she wants to be included when asked about her but can&#39;t always find the words or doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
She said it was OK for me to answer but if she wants to she will.<br/>
So far so good! :)</div>

<br/>
I usually said, &quot;she sometimes takes a while to warm up to new people.&quot;<br/>
That way I felt like I wasn&#39;t labeling her in a negative way.<br/>

Yes.  My version has been: &quot;Oh he&#39;s a real observer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it *is* positive.  Think about that old adage: Look before you leap.<br/>
