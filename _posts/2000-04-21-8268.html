<div id="ygrps-yiv-249242425">Hi Myra,<br/>
When I read your post I couldn&#39;t help but think that this could have gone<br/>
along with the unschooling fallacies thread. It is true that you may not get<br/>
a lot af time for yourself, but you will probably get more than you think. I<br/>
get mine before my kids get up in the morning. Others get it at night,<br/>
naptime, etc. Getting involved in a local group may get you time out too.<br/>
Between parents meetings, parents night out and games nights, etc. I get at<br/>
least 3 nights/month (almost 1/week) out. I also sell Pampered Chef and my<br/>
kids are very good about giving me time to prep for a show if I just tell<br/>
them &quot;mommy&#39;s working now&quot;. I recently hired a mother&#39;s helper and she plays<br/>
with the kids while I do housework and i enjoy shutting my bedroom door,<br/>
turning on the T.V. and just folding laundry or cleaning in peace. My<br/>
husband and I are going on our first &quot;date&quot; in 3 years tonight, because we<br/>
found a girl in our hs group that babysits. I&#39;m very excited.(Of course<br/>
we&#39;ll prob. talk about thekids all night-LOL) Boy, I get more time out than<br/>
I thought&lt;g&gt;. Good luck.<br/>
Amy</div>
