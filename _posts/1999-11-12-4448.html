<div id="ygrps-yiv-426644261">I&#39;m beginning to revise my thinking on reading books.  One year a few years<br/>
back I set a personal record by reading 122 books.  That was a lot of fun,<br/>
but after awhile, the tallying took on a life of its own, overshadowing<br/>
perhaps some of the other more important reasons for reading such as mind<br/>
broadening or relaxation.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m still a book lover.  I go to the library at least twice a week.<br/>
Non-fiction is my preference by far.  I pick out all sorts of books which<br/>
interest me: travel, hiking, history, poetry, social issues, books on<br/>
photography, etc.<br/>
<br/>
These days, however, I rarely read a book from cover to cover.  I simply<br/>
read the bits which interest me.  This is because my time for reading is<br/>
limited, and once I&#39;ve gleaned what I want to from one book, I&#39;m usually<br/>
anxious to move on to the next.  Practically the only books I read cover to<br/>
cover are the ones I read to my children at night before they go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more and more apparent to me that while books are still excellent<br/>
sources of information, the Internet is quickly becoming a worthy rival.<br/>
The Internet enables easy access to a mind-boggling array of news and<br/>
information sources.<br/>
<br/>
Personally,  I get my news from several respected American sites as well as<br/>
a few foreign websites.  Often when a story hits which piques my curiosity,<br/>
I go directly to the news website of the city where the event is happening.<br/>
It&#39;s great fun to get foreign perspectives on news happening in the United<br/>
States.  I love the availability of demographic and geographic information<br/>
as well.  My growing network of Internet friends/acquaintances is also<br/>
invaluable in that we send each other links, articles and other discoveries<br/>
we find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
In the long run, electronic information sources will diminish the relative<br/>
importance of printed books, but won&#39;t eliminate them entirely.  I&#39;m just<br/>
happy to live in an age when the number of easily accesssible information<br/>
sources has exploded.  Surely there has never been a better time in the<br/>
history of the world to undertake the task of self-education.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420085042">I have been thinking a lot lately about the role the internet plays in our<br/>
lives these days. As I sit here researching something for my son, I think how<br/>
wonderful it is to have all this information available at my fingertips. On the<br/>
other hand, I hope we don&#39;t lose the experience of reading a book cover to<br/>
cover, an experience that I have always enjoyed and hope my son will also<br/>
always relish. Reading a full length book or story is something you can&#39;t<br/>
really do online. What is online consists mostly of short pieces of<br/>
information, much like TV reports. This is the same reason my husband likes<br/>
magazines like Popular Science: mostly short articles that are quickly<br/>
dispatched and he moves on to the next topic. Do you think our experiences with<br/>
the types of information (lots of short pieces) from TV and the internet have<br/>
affected the way we read printed materials? Has it affected our concentration<br/>
for longer pieces of information? It is a shame that reading something<br/>
cover-to-cover is a luxury these days because of time constraints. Although I<br/>
admit I too find myself spending more of my free night time researching things<br/>
online rather than reading because that &quot;mind-boggling array&quot; of information is<br/>
luring me to the keyboard!<br/>

There&#39;s really no reason to limit ourselves to printed books.  We live in a different age and should take full advantage of what&#39;s now available.<br/>

<br/>

There are museums, walks, and other outdoor things which can be just as stimulating as a good book.  Once again, I believe our choices are more numerous and this is one of the reasons why reading full length books is diminishing in importance.<br/>

information, or that my son should sit inside every day and do nothing but<br/>
read. I was mostly thinking of books as another type of art form or<br/>
entertainment, rather than as sources of information alone. Books for fun<br/>
rather than books solely for learning. True, &quot;educational&quot; activities abound,<br/>
and we should make full use of all our resources. But I still enjoy the printed<br/>
form of storytelling for one part of my recreation. I guess I liked reading and<br/>
dreaming too much as a kid!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes Laura,   There is a definate cycle to internet addictions.  :)   I<br/>
have handled it in many ways over the years.  At times I have limited myself<br/>
to just a morning time, or just an evening session.  Other times I have used<br/>
it throughout the day, but made sure I spent time doing other things.  My<br/>
time is also seasonal.  In winter, most especially during snowed in times we<br/>
use the computer more than we do in spring or summer.<br/>
<br/>
I once turned off the computer and told myself I wouldn&#39;t turn it back on<br/>
until I really, really wanted to. It stayed off 7 days. It was a good 7<br/>
days.  :)  These days I make sure there is one 24 hour period during a week<br/>
where I stay offline.  NHEN has sort of ruined that plan, but I will return<br/>
to it soon.<br/>
<br/>
It is something you learn to juggle.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I have only recently started using E mail and the Internet and I am <br/>
&gt;beginning to feel that it takes up far more of my time than I&#39;d like. I am <br/>
&gt;seriously considering signing off completely. Have any of you felt this way? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been online since the summer of 1994 and I have *definitely* gone<br/>
through stages of being way overboard with being on line. It&#39;s such an<br/>
incredible place, I find it amazing some people are able to regulate<br/>
themselves at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Basically, you can strike a balance. Think about what is most important to<br/>
you, what you would most like to spend your time on. Being a homeschooler,<br/>
that&#39;s probably #1 your kids. :) Think about what times of day are<br/>
*reasonable* for you not to be with them, doing things with them, and you<br/>
may have found your internet time (during their naps, or while they are at<br/>
Boy Scouts, or when your husband takes them out bike riding, or when they go<br/>
to bed).<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you feel that at this time in your life and their lives you<br/>
really *can&#39;t* handle it, do sign off completely. I was basically offline<br/>
for the first year of my second daughter&#39;s life. She defined &quot;high need<br/>
baby&quot; &lt;g&gt; and I never mastered the fine art of nursing at the keyboard. So,<br/>
I turned off the computer and put my attention where it was really needed.<br/>
And you know what? When I had some time again I turned the computer back on<br/>
and I hadn&#39;t missed much. :) The Internet will be here next week, next<br/>
month, next year.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Up until late last year I almost never used the computer. I never used email. I<br/>
complained that my husband spent too much time online. Then my son went to<br/>
kindergarten and I found myself at loose ends. I started using the computer<br/>
more during the day; it was great for researching homeschooling and for<br/>
connecting to people in general. <br/>
<br/>
Then, after the initial internet oversaturation period, I started dropping<br/>
online activities and usage until, during the spring of this year, I lost<br/>
interest. It didn&#39;t satisfy my needs like it did at first. Plus, once we<br/>
decided to homeschool, we were spending more time doing things because my son<br/>
was now at home. So I guess you do go through stages, as with any new project.<br/>
You can reach a compromise. I still use the email because it is so fast, I can<br/>
respond to people at my leisure (late at night), and I can leave longer<br/>
messages than I can on an answering machine. (That&#39;s why I like these email<br/>
lists!) And I still use the computer for information research. But I make sure<br/>
I turn it off too. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;John Andersen<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would agree with that.  I am getting so much information these days on<br/>
the areas that I am actively studying from participating in lists I am on,<br/>
reading information on websites, and having conversations with other<br/>
(online and off.)  I would hate to think that this information was any less<br/>
important or worthy than info I got from a book.  Some books are, to say<br/>
the least, really lame and a waste of time, whereas if you feel you are not<br/>
getting what you need from the internet, you can turn it off and you don&#39;t<br/>
have to wait until you get to the &quot;end&quot; to determine it&#39;s value.<br/>
<br/>
With my schedule the way it is, I have a very limited amount of time in<br/>
which to read books, but I also have essential reasons to need to gather<br/>
information right now.  We are adopting a child and are required to do<br/>
educational reading and classes on special needs children.  But I also get<br/>
a great deal of wonderful information from internet sources.  I am also<br/>
taking classes (in the real world) focusing on theology and spiritualism<br/>
for my own personal growth and find more info and a place to discuss<br/>
classes and ideas with others on the internet.  That is an opportunity I<br/>
really cherise, because I do not get out much when I spend all my days<br/>
caring for two babies.     <br/>
<br/>
I am also discovering medical information for my &quot;special needs&quot; eldest<br/>
child who has severe allergies and sensativites, and I am able to educate<br/>
myself about his conditions and how various approaches may affect him, or<br/>
how I can make sure he gets a nutritionally complete diet while avoiding<br/>
his allergens.  Not to mention the medical information that I find for<br/>
myself.  <br/>
<br/>
Then there is the fact that, with 2 toddlers in diapers at home, a part<br/>
time job on the weekends, an adoption ongoing with all the work it entails,<br/>
and a house that is in the process of being remodeled, I have no time to<br/>
shop for the holidays.  I also have a three year old&#39;s birthday to plan<br/>
(12-22) and my DH&#39;s birthday (12-16) to shop and plan for.  So I shop<br/>
online!  And I just bought the greatest slightly used London Fog full lenth<br/>
winter coat for DH and a big toy castle for the almost three year old.  It<br/>
is next to impossiible for me to get out and shop without the boys, and<br/>
forget about DH not knowing what I am up to if I have to arrange special<br/>
time to go out and shop by myself.  Plus the fact that I HATE shopping in<br/>
general, crowds, malls, sales people, etc.  ICK!<br/>
<br/>
So there is so much information and so many opportunities on the internet<br/>
that make my life easier and more enriched.  <br/>

laura,<br/>
when i first signed on this list in sept i couldnt believe the amount of mail <br/>
and time it included.  (for those of you who are on several, you are <br/>
laughing, right?)  i personally dont do the internet part but about once <br/>
every 4-6wks (i save up links to check out, etc.)  i use the automatic mail <br/>
retreival to get the mail daily without more than a push of a button <br/>
(timesaver) and then usually take most of the wknd off just bc i am ready to <br/>
shift gears a bit.  i think when it is new the novelty is too much fun, but i <br/>
too initially felt it was a bit much.  i decided however that i do find it <br/>
beneficial to me overall, so i didnt want to give it up.  most days the mail <br/>
gets at least scanned, and many days i dont open the long list of <br/>
&quot;unschoolingdotcom&quot; mail...  and read it all at another time...  one last <br/>
note.  if you leave town, dont forget to unsub for your own sanity.  i was <br/>
gone a wk (and apparently a very happenin&#39; wk on this list!) and came back to <br/>
an overwhelming number of emails that i just had to take the time to <br/>
delete.....<br/>

&gt;I&#39;m beginning to revise my thinking on reading books.  One year a few years<br/>
&gt;back I set a personal record by reading 122 books.  That was a lot of fun,<br/>
&gt;but after awhile, the tallying took on a life of its own, overshadowing<br/>

&gt;interest me: travel, hiking, history, poetry, social issues, books on<br/>
&gt;photography, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;These days, however, I rarely read a book from cover to cover.  I simply<br/>

&gt;limited, and once I&#39;ve gleaned what I want to from one book, I&#39;m usually<br/>

&gt;cover are the ones I read to my children at night before they go to bed.<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s more and more apparent to me that while books are still excellent<br/>
&gt;sources of information, the Internet is quickly becoming a worthy rival.<br/>
&gt;The Internet enables easy access to a mind-boggling array of news and<br/>
&gt;information sources.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally,  I get my news from several respected American sites as well as<br/>
&gt;a few foreign websites.  Often when a story hits which piques my curiosity,<br/>
&gt;I go directly to the news website of the city where the event is happening.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s great fun to get foreign perspectives on news happening in the United<br/>
&gt;States.  I love the availability of demographic and geographic information<br/>
&gt;as well.  My growing network of Internet friends/acquaintances is also<br/>
&gt;invaluable in that we send each other links, articles and other discoveries<br/>
&gt;we find interesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In the long run, electronic information sources will diminish the relative<br/>
&gt;importance of printed books, but won&#39;t eliminate them entirely.  I&#39;m just<br/>
&gt;happy to live in an age when the number of easily accesssible information<br/>
&gt;sources has exploded.  Surely there has never been a better time in the<br/>
&gt;history of the world to undertake the task of self-education.<br/>
