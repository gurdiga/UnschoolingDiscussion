&lt;&lt; So, have you ever found something that interested your child by <br/>

<br/>
Usually.<br/>
I see that as the heart of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When life is busy and swirly, all KINDS of ideas and connections sparkle up <br/>
to the surface.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
Rachel is busily nagging me about ordering her stepping stone molds.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can make some of your own if you have an electric saw, by getting one of <br/>
the giant cardboard tubes used for concrete molds for columns.  They can be <br/>
12&quot; in diameter, or 24&quot; or probably all sizes, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve seen.  We <br/>
got some and sliced sections about 8&quot; thick, put cement in, and when it was <br/>
nearly set we put handprints, our names in rocks, the dog&#39;s paw print, etc, <br/>
on different ones, and we brought them from our old house to our new one too.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s big accidental (or gradually burgeoning) interest in the past few <br/>
months has been the 1930&#39;s.  It started from a discussion of making change, <br/>
and me renting Paper Moon for her.  She loved the music, so we found some <br/>
full recordings of some things which were only snippets in the movie.  That <br/>
led to Top Hat, and other dance movies, and to Irving Berlin, which tied back <br/>
to Annie Get your Gun, and other Bernadette Peters stuff, to discussions <br/>
about the depression, Shirley Temple movies, Judy Garland (who was nearly in <br/>
a movie of Annie Get your Gun, and they do have some of the songs recorded by <br/>
her).  And Annie (the musical, a review of that storie and related sub-bits). <br/>
 I&#39;ve learned more about the 1930&#39;s and Roosevelt than I had ever known <br/>
before, because Holly wanted to know more and more.<br/>

<br/>
Margaret Atwoods Handmaids Tale<br/>

Midwives by Chris Bohjalian<br/>
The Dark Side of Christian History by Helen Ellerby (not a novel, but she<br/>
still might enjoy it)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Rachel is busily nagging me about ordering her stepping stone molds. &gt;<br/>
We have a few of those and basically, theyre just cheap plastic something<br/>
you could easily replace by using those foil pie pans from the grocery<br/>
store.  I dont know how much they cost in catalogs it could be they arent<br/>
that expensive anyway.<br/>

1999, when I was wondering about the Y2K thing.  I&#39;ve told my daughter <br/>
she&#39;ll like Midwives, but she&#39;s not to read it until *after* she delivers <br/>
the next grandchild (at home).<br/>

<br/>
Kidlet #5 (14) was playing some game on the computer in the next room and<br/>
heard us talking.  He asked about Hitler and the next time we went to the<br/>
library he checked out about a dozen books on Hitler.  He tried slogging his<br/>
way through Mein Kaumf but gave that up.  He finally settled on &quot;The Horns<br/>
of the Moon&quot; and read the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
This was particularly amazing as he is not a big reader unless it is a<br/>
manual for a video game.<br/>

superpowers were about to put in motion strategies for preventing the <br/>
terrorists from moving money around the world about 6 months before the WTC <br/>
attacks.  Dubya scotched the plan because it would make it harder for his <br/>
rich buddies to avoid taxes by moving their money offshore.  Who knows <br/>
whether they could have pulled off the attacks if their money supply was <br/>
cut off.  So does that make him at least partially responsible?  I think so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683278333">Well, being from a segment of the population that is feeling quite a few<br/>
more backlashes from Dumbya than most, and since Hitler loved American<br/>
history and used the U.S.&#39;s First Nations genocidal policies as the model<br/>
for his genocidal policies, I guess we kinda think of him being a close<br/>
cousin to Hitler.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing the kidlets (this would be the older boys) were discussing,<br/>
o.k., so they were taking bets on it and they won cause dh still gives the<br/>
press and Dumbya much too much credit, is how long Enron would stay front<br/>
page news and whether a special prosecutor would be used.<br/>
<br/>
The boys gave Enron a month and no special prosecutor.  DH said Enron would<br/>
be &quot;dealt with.&quot;  The boys also said that they bet old Spin Doctor O&#39;Reilly<br/>
would stop talking about Enron and go back to hollering about Whitewater.<br/>
They won that bet also.<br/>
<br/>
All of which was an unschooling moment because our neighbors were over that<br/>
night and their boys go to ps.  Jill sat there with her mouth hanging open<br/>
muttering about how she wished her sons took an interest in politics and<br/>
asked how they knew all that stuff and how many hours did we spend studying<br/>
it.  Son #3 said &quot;we don&#39;t do &#39;studying&#39; like in a school.&quot;  Jill then asked<br/>
&quot;well then how do you know.&quot;  And all the boys chimed in with  &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
important to know about these guys because we are voting in the next<br/>
election.  We read newspapers, watch the news and use the net.&quot;<br/>
