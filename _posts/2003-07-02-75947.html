<div id="ygrps-yiv-369695186">We are having a problem I don&#39;t know how to deal with.  My youngest,<br/>
Storey is 5 1/2, is a handful.  I don&#39;t mean that in a disrespectful<br/>
way, I mean she is curious about everything, into everything, and wants<br/>
what she wants right now.  She is bright and funny and a good mother to<br/>
her guinea pig.  She considers herself an artist (I consider her one<br/>
also, she&#39;s got a talent for it) and seems to have the temperament of a<br/>
true artist (dedicated, true to her vision, etc...).<br/>
<br/>
We have never spanked, but we used to give time outs (they don&#39;t work by<br/>
the way.  Since we&#39;ve stopped doing that both of my kids behavior is<br/>
more pleasant and they don&#39;t misbehave as they used to).  My husband<br/>
thinks we need to go back to the punishing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why:  Storey has only ever wanted me to comfort her.  When she<br/>
was a baby only I was allowed to hold her.  She would scream if anyone<br/>
else did.  She would wake up if she was set down to sleep (even though<br/>
she was sleeping right next to me, I needed to have my arms around<br/>
her).  She nursed and would never take a bottle of breast milk (my<br/>
husband still has a hard time with this - our oldest allowed him to<br/>
bottle feed occasionally).  I spent many years being &quot;touched out&quot;<br/>
because of the amount of time that Storey needed from me.<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law says that Storey is spoiled and rude because Storey<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to be around her (whereas our son is perfect and easy - she<br/>
actually says that in front of the kids).  I say that mil has made it<br/>
very clear to Storey that she doesn&#39;t like her.  Storey responds to mil<br/>
by not wanting to be near her, not answering her when spoken to.<br/>
<br/>
We spent the afternoon at my in-laws this Sunday and Storey sat on my<br/>
lap.  Mil kept telling her that she was too big to be on my lap and to<br/>
get off.  I kept repeating that she was fine and to let her be.  Finally<br/>
I&#39;d had enough and asked Storey to sit next to me, but that meant that<br/>
she would be sitting next to her grandmother and Storey did not want to<br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
Storey had a melt down and was crying saying she didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
there, didn&#39;t want to come in the first place and could we please go<br/>
home.  Instead of punishing her for what mil thinks was manipulative<br/>
behavior, I held her and talked calmly with her explaining that daddy<br/>
and Robin were having a good time, we had just gotten there and were<br/>
there to have lunch with the grandparents and that we would be leaving<br/>
soon, but not right now.  (By the time we were ready to go Storey and<br/>
Robin were making pots - my in-laws are potters - and neither of them<br/>
wanted to go.)<br/>
<br/>
Mil was pissed and spent the next 1/2 hour talking to my husband in<br/>
private about how Storey needed professional help to learn how to behave<br/>
properly and how we were too lenient with her (my mother thinks this<br/>
also) and needed to punish this sort of behavior, about how she&#39;s raised<br/>
7 kids and knows what she is talking about (btw, of those 7, all except<br/>
my husband have been divorced at least twice, 2 of them have been in and<br/>
out of jail, at least 2 of them are alcoholics/drug abusers,  and 1<br/>
doesn&#39;t even speak to her.  Maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence, but my<br/>
husband says they were never told they were loved or hugged and punished<br/>
harshly and often.).<br/>
<br/>
So now my husband is saying that maybe we should have her professionally<br/>
evaluated, maybe there really is something wrong with her.  We ended up<br/>
in a long heated discussion over this.  I disagree with him.  Yes Storey<br/>
is needy, but she&#39;s 5, not 30.  Yes Storey is a handful, but it&#39;s ok<br/>
because she is my daughter and I want to help her and be with her.<br/>
<br/>
So, to sum up a very long story, what do you think about the idea of<br/>
professional evaluations?  Do they do any good?  I say we should just<br/>
raise her the way we have been, she&#39;s gotten easier to be around so we<br/>
seem to be doing something right.  But maybe my husband has a point?<br/>
I&#39;m really confused.  (Maybe I&#39;m just looking for people to agree with<br/>
me?  To help me back up what I think is the right way?)<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are in marriage counseling right now and I was thinking<br/>
of asking the counselor about this.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for the length, thanks for letting me get this off my chest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185108821">Wow, Kate. From reading your post - and my *only* perspective comes <br/>
from that so please keep this in that context - I don&#39;t think the <br/>
problem is with your lovely daughter (what a wonderful image!), but <br/>
with others who don&#39;t want to take the time or make the effort you&#39;ve <br/>
made to understand what&#39;s happening - and why. It seems to me that <br/>
you&#39;ve got a good handle on the situation, so my advice would be to <br/>
keep doing just what you&#39;re doing and try to keep the MiL from <br/>
negatively affecting your daughter any more than she already has.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned being in marriage counseling - could Storey be picking <br/>
up on the vibes between you and your husband and reacting in the only <br/>
reasonable way she knows? As far as professional evaluations, I&#39;ve <br/>
never had - or wanted - any experience with those, so I can&#39;t advise <br/>
in that department. But my instincts have always been to listen to my <br/>
kids when I wasn&#39;t sure how to proceed. Even when they were small and <br/>
seemingly inexperienced they knew an awful lot about what was going <br/>
on, and why, and what could or should be done to make things right.<br/>

seem to be doing something right.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You could easily give someone $100 to tell you you should put her in school.<br/>
<br/>
You KNOW that&#39;s not the answer, but what other answers could possibly be <br/>
expected to come from a professional who became &quot;professional&quot; by 18 or 20 years <br/>
in school?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think drugs or daycare would help?<br/>
<br/>
First brainstorm with your husband what &quot;professional help&quot; he thinks would <br/>
help.  Play therapy?  (Are there serious home problems?  I doubt it--you said <br/>
this was from birth, and play therapy isn&#39;t going to get to a genetic <br/>
level--they&#39;re looking for trauma or odd relationships or behaviors on the part of <br/>
other family members in her life which she would act out with dolls or puppets.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a compromise would be discuss it with your husband, get some books to <br/>
read together, and say if she&#39;s still having such problems at eight, or nine, <br/>
you&#39;ll consider having someone else talk to her.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;My husband and I are in marriage counseling right now and I was thinking<br/>
of asking the counselor about this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d mention it.<br/>
<br/>
Two friends of mine are in counselling and the counsellor has a GREAT plan.  <br/>
One of their major problems is the relationship between the dad and the middle <br/>
child, older of two boys.    That child is most like the mom (hmmmm) and the <br/>
dad is MEAN to him.  So instead of first working on the marriage and later, <br/>
maybe, move on to the child, the counsellor uses 20 minutes of each session to <br/>
discuss how it&#39;s going with that child, and how the dad&#39;s changing his approach <br/>
and how the mom feels about it.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the marriage stuff shows in that.<br/>
And if that&#39;s changed, the husband will see changes in the relationship with <br/>
his wife, because part of his focus is that he doesn&#39;t WANT the boy to be so <br/>
much like his mom.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kinda flashingly (embarrassingly) obvious from the outside, but close up <br/>
the dad can&#39;t see any of it.<br/>
<br/>
So 1/3 is that, 1/3 is personal relations, and I think the other 1/3 might be <br/>
finances.  (I forget.)<br/>
<br/>
That might apply not one bit, but then it might, a touch.<br/>

Helen****<br/>
<br/>
Well, both of our kids have certainly seen some tension around the <br/>
house in the past few months.  Maybe it&#39;s been happening longer than my <br/>
husband and I realize.  But the counseling is really helping and we all <br/>
see the changes for the better in our family.<br/>
<br/>
As far as Storey&#39;s behaviour, it&#39;s only gotten better over time.  She <br/>
is much less difficult to be with now, compared with even a year ago.  <br/>
So I don&#39;t think that her &quot;rude and disrespectful&quot; (mil&#39;s quote) <br/>
behaviour is related to our marriage.  Storey has never (even as a <br/>
baby) put up with people who don&#39;t like her, she has a great bullshit <br/>
meter and refuses to be with or talk to people who she feels are <br/>
condescending toward her or her brother.  <br/>
<br/>
I really feel that my mil is just demanding something (respect?) from <br/>
some one who feels that she doesn&#39;t deserve it.  I mean, why would <br/>
Storey want to be kind to her grandmother when her grandmother has <br/>
never hugged her or said any kind word to her?  The kind words are <br/>
reserved for our son.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203040385">-=-We are having a problem I don&#39;t know how to deal with.  My youngest,<br/>
Storey is 5 1/2, is a handful.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a dd who is of similar temperament - she&#39;s even illustrated a cover for a homeschooling book, so there are great outcomes when you are blessed with such a child! - but this is NOT an &quot;easy&quot; child.  Good for you for taking this senstive approach! (And good for my wife, Maureen for leading me to this point of view because I was NOT in agreement at first) The irony is I&#39;m like this myself and wasn&#39;t able to understand it.  I think it had been beaten out of me with Dad&#39;s belt and A LOT of &quot;those&quot; looks that threaten more violence if not complying with their wishes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We have never spanked<br/>
<br/>
We did in the early days to no good results, esp. with the &quot;difficult&quot; child - IMHO it destroys people & it does NOT build them or &quot;character.&quot;  I think you know this, but I hate the JUDGEMENTS out there. &gt;:O(<br/>
<br/>
Now that our dd is 15, our respective mil&#39;s are realizing that this IS the right way - tho they could not do it themselves now and could NOT buy the concept when she was 5.  My mom is so uptight and Maureen&#39;s mom is too rash/used to hitting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-When she was a baby only I was allowed to hold her.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe try the &quot;Highly Sensitive Child&quot; book so often recommended here!  Might helps you and maybe your husband undestand her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Mil was pissed and spent the next 1/2 hour talking to my husband in<br/>
private about how Storey needed professional help to learn how to behave<br/>
properly and how we were too lenient with her (my mother thinks this<br/>
also) and needed to punish this sort of behavior, about how she&#39;s raised<br/>
7 kids and knows what she is talking about <br/>
<br/>
Maybe take a look at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bullyonline.org">http://www.bullyonline.org</a> generally and maybe <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bullyonline.org/familybully/index.htm">http://www.bullyonline.org/familybully/index.htm</a> for help with mil.  Great site!  Helped me see where the lines of help/hurt are a lot more clearly.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-(btw, of those 7, all except<br/>
my husband have been divorced at least twice, 2 of them have been in and<br/>
out of jail, at least 2 of them are alcoholics/drug abusers,  and 1<br/>
doesn&#39;t even speak to her.  Maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence, but my<br/>
husband says they were never told they were loved or hugged and punished<br/>
harshly and often.)<br/>
<br/>
I see a crisis in parenting in this world - very sad to me  :O(<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-So now my husband is saying that maybe we should have her professionally<br/>
evaluated<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s my belief that this will help if you feel there is a need.  If not, it will likely do damage.  No one wants to be under the microscope for acting naturally, of course.  Our dd has been assessed for CAPD and has some counselling but only as a teen.  It&#39;s a hard choice because intervention by &quot;authorities&quot; can hurt as much as help, IMHO. It&#39;s like back surgery - might work - might be worse.  :O)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my humble thots are those brilliant, interesting, wonderful type people,<br/>

When there&#39;s tension at their house, I take a kid for a walk, either in the <br/>

ditch, lots of interesting alley-stuff), or out the front, into the neighbornood.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe MIL thinks Storey made it clear she didn&#39;t like her or anyone else much <br/>
by clinging only to you, her mother all the time.  It would make it difficult <br/>
to develop a relationship with a child that only wants to be with her mother.<br/>
<br/>
My son was like this.  He NEVER wanted to be with anyone but me.  His dad did <br/>
feel left out.  With the other babies he could at least bathe and dress them <br/>
and play with them and do things but not this one.  He wanted only ME.  Made <br/>
it difficult for anyone to make a bond or have any type of relationship with <br/>
the child.<br/>
<br/>
I really couldn&#39;t blame it on the adults and there was no blame for my son <br/>
either.  It was just how he was.  It was frustrating to others that wanted him <br/>
to play/do things with them and get to know him on a different level other than <br/>
the clingy child that only wanted his mother.<br/>
<br/>
I think at five I would point out that it is rude not to answer Grandma when <br/>
she is speaking to you, if it&#39;s just because she feels she doesn&#39;t want to.  <br/>
It goes back to manners/rank/respect and while I don&#39;t want to revisit that <br/>
thread, I would at least ask my child at five to acknowledge that Grandmother is <br/>
speaking to them.  If they don&#39;t want to engage in conversation well they can <br/>
say I don&#39;t feel like talking right now.  But at least don&#39;t ignore someone <br/>
who is making an effort to speak to you.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they are just trying to coax your daughter to come join them and give <br/>
you a break by saying she&#39;s too big for your lap.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s the wrong way <br/>
to go about it, but they probably have good intentions by wanting her to engage <br/>
with them.  Otherwise they&#39;d just ignore her.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about having her evaluated but I&#39;d try to encourage her to get <br/>
to know her family and others.<br/>
<br/>
My son was hospitalized for a fairly serious illness.  I never once left him <br/>
day and night, I changed in his room, I ate in his room.  When he was mostly <br/>
better and we were hoping he&#39;d go home soon, the doctor asked to meet with me <br/>
and it seemed serious.  I said before I send him home, you have to do a few <br/>
things.  One was to go have lunch AWAY from the hospital and be gone at least an <br/>
hour.  Another was to allow others to have a part of his life, help my son to <br/>
see that others are valuable and trustworthy and he can rely on them.  He said <br/>
if something should ever happen to me, how desperate would my child be?  That <br/>
made me think.  At first I was very angry that he would tell me I had to do <br/>
these things before my child could come home.  Then I thought about what he <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
What IF something God forbid happened to me.  How lost would my son be?  I <br/>
worked hard on getting him to be comfortable with others.  I realized that I had <br/>
never really encouraged it, just thinking it was his personality and he would <br/>
be fine and one day would be like the other children.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, there are lots of in betweens and you have to trust your instincts <br/>
for sure, but I wanted you to know that other children are like that and are <br/>
fine.  My son is now almost 19, he&#39;s still a &quot;momma&#39;s&quot; boy and depends on me a <br/>
lot more than the other children but is perfectly capable of being on his own as <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
He was just in Myrtle Beach for eight days without any adult and did just <br/>
fine.  He still prefers to have me make his lunch and sometimes fold his laundry, <br/>
but he&#39;s more than capable of taking excellent care of himself and has lots <br/>
of friends.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m sure your daughter will do just fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-141883864">Dear Kate,<br/>
<br/>
Let me ask you a few questions.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter were to be evaluated &lt;shudder!&gt; by a professional psychologist/counselor, would you change your behavior, say, if she said your daughter were ADHD or some other childhood disordered.  Would you put her on Ritalin or some other drug?  Would you put her in Time Out?  Would you treat her differently?  Would you give her less love than she desires? Would you have in your mind that your child is somehow defective or disordered?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry that your husband and MIL are not giving you the support and your child the support that you both need.  I bet the entire situation would be so much better if they were both treating her with respect and loving kindness instead of demanding that she behave differently.  <br/>
<br/>
All these people, even your mother, are seeing your lovely daughter through a different filter, one that is normally used by public schools, and society at large.  They want her to be NORMAL, so it&#39;s easier for them.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a degree in counseling, but I am by no means a professional counselor.  I recommend against professional evaluation of your lovely 5 1/2 year old daughter.  Labels stick.  I encourage you to continue to love and support your daughter the way you have been doing.  Continue to show her your unconditional love.  It sounds like you are the only source of it in her life.<br/>
<br/>
This situation must cause you profound sadness, that your husband wants to punish your daughter for wanting you to love her up.  I was in a situation like this one briefly and it made me sick.  Yep, I&#39;m married now for the third time, but I&#39;d rather be married 3 times than be with someone who has totally different ideas about love and family than I do.  My daughter&#39;s safety and security is A#1 in my book and everyone in my life knows that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep you in my thoughts, Kate.<br/>
<br/>
Nichole<br/>

  Subject: [Unschooling-Discussion] my lovely daughter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  We are having a problem I don&#39;t know how to deal with.  My youngest,<br/>
  Storey is 5 1/2, is a handful.  I don&#39;t mean that in a disrespectful<br/>
  way, I mean she is curious about everything, into everything, and wants<br/>
  what she wants right now.  She is bright and funny and a good mother to<br/>
  her guinea pig.  She considers herself an artist (I consider her one<br/>
  also, she&#39;s got a talent for it) and seems to have the temperament of a<br/>
  true artist (dedicated, true to her vision, etc...).<br/>
<br/>
  We have never spanked, but we used to give time outs (they don&#39;t work by<br/>
  the way.  Since we&#39;ve stopped doing that both of my kids behavior is<br/>
  more pleasant and they don&#39;t misbehave as they used to).  My husband<br/>
  thinks we need to go back to the punishing.<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s why:  Storey has only ever wanted me to comfort her.  When she<br/>
  was a baby only I was allowed to hold her.  She would scream if anyone<br/>
  else did.  She would wake up if she was set down to sleep (even though<br/>
  she was sleeping right next to me, I needed to have my arms around<br/>
  her).  She nursed and would never take a bottle of breast milk (my<br/>
  husband still has a hard time with this - our oldest allowed him to<br/>
  bottle feed occasionally).  I spent many years being &quot;touched out&quot;<br/>
  because of the amount of time that Storey needed from me.<br/>
<br/>
  My mother-in-law says that Storey is spoiled and rude because Storey<br/>
  doesn&#39;t like to be around her (whereas our son is perfect and easy - she<br/>
  actually says that in front of the kids).  I say that mil has made it<br/>
  very clear to Storey that she doesn&#39;t like her.  Storey responds to mil<br/>
  by not wanting to be near her, not answering her when spoken to.<br/>
<br/>
  We spent the afternoon at my in-laws this Sunday and Storey sat on my<br/>
  lap.  Mil kept telling her that she was too big to be on my lap and to<br/>
  get off.  I kept repeating that she was fine and to let her be.  Finally<br/>
  I&#39;d had enough and asked Storey to sit next to me, but that meant that<br/>
  she would be sitting next to her grandmother and Storey did not want to<br/>
  do that.<br/>
<br/>
  Storey had a melt down and was crying saying she didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
  there, didn&#39;t want to come in the first place and could we please go<br/>
  home.  Instead of punishing her for what mil thinks was manipulative<br/>
  behavior, I held her and talked calmly with her explaining that daddy<br/>
  and Robin were having a good time, we had just gotten there and were<br/>
  there to have lunch with the grandparents and that we would be leaving<br/>
  soon, but not right now.  (By the time we were ready to go Storey and<br/>
  Robin were making pots - my in-laws are potters - and neither of them<br/>
  wanted to go.)<br/>
<br/>
  Mil was pissed and spent the next 1/2 hour talking to my husband in<br/>
  private about how Storey needed professional help to learn how to behave<br/>
  properly and how we were too lenient with her (my mother thinks this<br/>
  also) and needed to punish this sort of behavior, about how she&#39;s raised<br/>
  7 kids and knows what she is talking about (btw, of those 7, all except<br/>
  my husband have been divorced at least twice, 2 of them have been in and<br/>
  out of jail, at least 2 of them are alcoholics/drug abusers,  and 1<br/>
  doesn&#39;t even speak to her.  Maybe it&#39;s just a coincidence, but my<br/>
  husband says they were never told they were loved or hugged and punished<br/>
  harshly and often.).<br/>
<br/>
  So now my husband is saying that maybe we should have her professionally<br/>
  evaluated, maybe there really is something wrong with her.  We ended up<br/>
  in a long heated discussion over this.  I disagree with him.  Yes Storey<br/>
  is needy, but she&#39;s 5, not 30.  Yes Storey is a handful, but it&#39;s ok<br/>
  because she is my daughter and I want to help her and be with her.<br/>
<br/>
  So, to sum up a very long story, what do you think about the idea of<br/>
  professional evaluations?  Do they do any good?  I say we should just<br/>
  raise her the way we have been, she&#39;s gotten easier to be around so we<br/>
  seem to be doing something right.  But maybe my husband has a point?<br/>
  I&#39;m really confused.  (Maybe I&#39;m just looking for people to agree with<br/>
  me?  To help me back up what I think is the right way?)<br/>
<br/>
  My husband and I are in marriage counseling right now and I was thinking<br/>
  of asking the counselor about this.<br/>
<br/>
  Sorry for the length, thanks for letting me get this off my chest.<br/>
<br/>
  Kate<br/>
  who is a little confused right now<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I might mention the fact that your mil seems to have some enormous influence over your dh, to the detriment of your relationship!<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d want any &quot;professional&quot; advice about the dd, you already feel comfortable meeting her needs. The problem is the dynamics between you and dh...he should be backing you up with mil, especially in light of her own miserable parenting choices.<br/>
Some children are very needy, it will change.<br/>
My 2.5 y.o. is pretty much only happy with me. If I am at work, then Dad is just fine, but when I&#39;m here, I am the only one he wants.<br/>
He sleeps right next to me, he nurses frequently and I don&#39;t see how changing any of that is going to make him a better person in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Sierra is six, and still doesn&#39;t take to people readily. She doesn&#39;t like talking to anyone that isn&#39;t very familiar, but she talks my ear off! :) Everyone has their own time table, your dd is just fine!!<br/>
<br/>
I would however, try to strengthen the family dynamics so everyone can tell the mil to butt out when she gets rude again.<br/>

<br/>
If their behavior is more pleasant, why does he think you need to go back to punishing?  (You don&#39;t have to answer here, just something to think about or ask him why.)<br/>
<br/>
As for your dd wanting to sit with you rather than Grandma, I happened to glance at Dear Abby this am.  Someone wrote in about child sexual abuse, and Abby wrote back that children need to be taught to say no to things that make them uncomfortable.  I thought what irony it is that our society usually teaches children to do whatever it takes to please adults, especially relatives (who are in the category of those most likely to sexually abuse children!).  I&#39;m not suggesting that your mil has any of those intents, just that if we expect children to say no when they are uncomfortable, we need to allow the children to be the judge of when they are uncomfortable!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I might try to soften a situation like that by making a joke about it or reminding others that children grow so quickly and before you know it she won&#39;t want to sit on your lap and doesn&#39;t she (your mil) miss those days when her little children wanted to cuddle with her?<br/>
<br/>
It really helped my mom to understand some of my parenting decisions when I compared a parent making a child eat their vegetables (the child may eat the vegetables to please the parent, but learns that we do things we don&#39;t want to do in order to make those we love happy) to a teenage friend urging a child to try drugs (the child may try the drugs to please the friend because they have learned that is more important to please others than to trust their own wants/needs.)<br/>

I&#39;m not really answering what you asked but commenting on the post. If<br/>
that&#39;s not what you want, just toss this. I won&#39;t be offended. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Since we&#39;ve stopped doing that both of my kids behavior is<br/>
more pleasant and they don&#39;t misbehave as they used to).  My husband<br/>
thinks we need to go back to the punishing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was why??? Does you husband not see the difference? Maybe<br/>
pointing out specifics would help. To him only. Like remember when Storey<br/>
would...... and now she doesn&#39;t do that? Maybe he&#39;s just not seeing it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I spent many years being &quot;touched out&quot;<br/>
because of the amount of time that Storey needed from me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I spent years feeling like I was doing something totally different than<br/>
anyone else in this house! &lt;BG&gt; Seemed like no one could comb hair, tie<br/>
shoes, put on socks, you name it, like I could. Joe would try and the kids<br/>
would freak and it was just easier and way more peaceful for me to just do<br/>
it. Joseph and Sierra are now 8 and 7 and Daddy is very good at all those<br/>
jobs he could never do before. &lt;BG&gt; They got out of it. Alyssa doesn&#39;t do<br/>
that with her dad but once in awhile. Joseph and Sierra were notorious for<br/>
&quot;I want Mommy to do it.&quot; For them it passed. If I would have forced &quot;no<br/>
daddy will&quot;, I do believe it would have been worse. You&#39;re doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We spent the afternoon at my in-laws this Sunday and Storey sat on my<br/>
lap.  Mil kept telling her that she was too big to be on my lap and to<br/>
get off.  I kept repeating that she was fine and to let her be.  Finally<br/>
I&#39;d had enough and asked Storey to sit next to me, but that meant that<br/>
she would be sitting next to her grandmother and Storey did not want to<br/>
do that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering what you had enough of? Was it Storey on your lap or you<br/>
MIL? If it was MIL, why make Storey get off? If it were me, I would have<br/>
gotten up and moved me and my kid away from MIL. Knowing me, I may have just<br/>
packed up the whole family and left. I&#39;ve done that before. My kids need to<br/>
know, that no matter who in the family is being a pita, I will protect my<br/>
kids. My mom has a tendency to pester Joseph and not the girls. I&#39;ve had<br/>
words with her about it. It wasn&#39;t nice. But things are better because she<br/>
knows I won&#39;t stand for it. He&#39;s better because he knows I won&#39;t stand for<br/>
it. My in laws would say awful things in front of my kids. It was their<br/>
house, but my kids. I won&#39;t tell them what to do, but I won&#39;t stay there if<br/>
my kids aren&#39;t safe.<br/>
<br/>
I see the issue, from what you wrote as your MIL. I don&#39;t suppose you can<br/>
force a professional on her can you?? I&#39;m pretty up front when it comes to<br/>
my kids. I avoid conflict a lot, but not when it has to do with them. I<br/>
would let my MIL know (and I have) that they are not her kids and I will not<br/>
stand by while she hurts them in anyway. So you either keep your mouth<br/>
closed and see them or don&#39;t see them. But that&#39;s just me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see where you daughter needs professional help. It may help to bring<br/>
it out in your own counseling. Depends on the therapist. It may not help and<br/>
they may suggest school or some such silly thing. You can probably figure<br/>
out where they may stand.<br/>
<br/>
Again I see the only one that needs handling is MIL. You seem to be doing<br/>
fine with your daughter. Good luck with the family.<br/>

going on in that original post.  The husbands relationship with his mother,  your <br/>
relationship with the MIL.  But in just focusing on your daughter, I know I <br/>
have never pushed my boys into doing something they were not comfortable with.  <br/>
Giving great grandma a hug.  Saying Hi to anyone.  Shaking hands with anyone. <br/>
 Answering anyone who had a question.  If they were not comfortable I did not <br/>
push and now my oldest is such a good judge of people.  He is not introverted <br/>
and clingy, like some people told me he would be.  People always said he was <br/>
old enough for this or that but I listened to him.  He let me know when he was <br/>
ready to venture away from me.  I want my boys to know what that gut instinct <br/>
is and what it feels like and that it is OK to follow that instinct.<br/>

to deal with.  Zoë, like Storey, has been this way SINCE BIRTH.  If she had<br/>
been an &quot;easy&quot; baby, we never would have learned the joys of the family bed,<br/>
or extended breastfeeding, or unschooling.  She and her personality are what<br/>
opened up my world to the possibility of homeschooling.  She has taught me<br/>
more than anyone else has.  Whenever she has a bad day, I look back to how<br/>
it was a year ago.  Now there are at least a day here and there that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t have some sort of a breakdown.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to post this publically.  I actually posted a question similar to<br/>
yours about a year ago to this list.  Dealing with a child that seems<br/>
illogical and irrational at times is very challenging.  She is literal<br/>
minded and a true genius (IMO, we&#39;ve never had her tested and we won&#39;t<br/>
ever), with the personality that goes with it.  She questions everything and<br/>
everything has to be &quot;just right always&quot; and &quot;perfect according to her<br/>
standards&quot; or she&#39;ll throw a major fit that affects everyone within hearing<br/>
distance.  I&#39;m sounding like I hate her, which I don&#39;t.  Yesterday was a<br/>
particularly difficult day for her and I wasn&#39;t feeling very sympathetic<br/>
(she was in the wrong every single time- seriously).  However, these days<br/>
with multiple meltdowns only happen a couple of times a month now, versus<br/>
EVERY SINGLE day for her entire life under age of 4-4.5 or so, so it does<br/>
get better and I can see that.  She still complains about things that<br/>
happened to her when she was 2 (she has a great memory).  For example, one<br/>
day when she was 2, I picked out a blue dress for her to wear (we were in a<br/>
hurry).  Well, she wanted the green dress.  So, I immediately put the blue<br/>
dress away and got the green dress, only to have her say, &quot;You didn&#39;t fix<br/>
the problem, I wanted the green dress first and you have forever ruined it<br/>
because you got the blue dress first and it will always be that you got the<br/>
blue dress first.&quot;  (She was very verbal from a very early age.)  That was<br/>
when she became in charge of forever more picking out her own clothing.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m convinced that if we had sent Zoë to school that she would either be on<br/>
drugs for ADD (or something) or she would be punished every single day.  I<br/>
am also convinced that she wouldn&#39;t have the sparkle and excitement for life<br/>
and learning new things that she has if she had been forced to attend<br/>
school.  I can say without hesitation that she is the smartest and most<br/>
alive 6.75 girl that I have ever met, and I&#39;ve met a lot of girls her age.<br/>
I can say this for every stage of her life thus far.  DH and I have gotten<br/>
really good at heading off some of her breakdowns, but people like my mother<br/>
have a way of making them worse and making them last for days and days and<br/>
days.  We didn&#39;t speak to DH&#39;s parents for several years because they<br/>
thought that we were/are parenting so horribly (they ignore it now and we<br/>
only see them about once a year or so).  I&#39;ll never forget the day that they<br/>
screamed, &quot;SHE&#39;S NOT NORMAL!&quot; when Zoë refused to immediately go to them<br/>
after she hadn&#39;t seen them for 3 or 4 months (they thought that they could<br/>
&quot;fix&quot; her if and they demanded to take her away from us for a week- we<br/>
refused).  Be forewarned that if you confront anyone on their issues with<br/>
your daughter, they might possibly not be in your life ever again (or for at<br/>
least a really long time- not that this is a bad thing necessarily).<br/>
<br/>
Zoë just had her first play date away from home without DH or I there also,<br/>
last week.  She is 6.75 years old.  I realized that this is a much older age<br/>
than most kids, but we waited until she was ready.  We&#39;ve spent a lot of<br/>
time with this family and they&#39;ve seen Zoe during some of her lesser<br/>
breakdowns.  They have a new baby, and were only comfortable hosting with<br/>
both of the parents home.  Anyway, after discussing it a lot by all parties,<br/>
we (Zoe included) decided on a 3 hour time limit.  It went fantastic.  So<br/>
well, in fact, that everyone wants to do it again.  It was hard for DH and<br/>
I.  We were a good 10-15 minutes away from her and we were nervous the<br/>
entire time that she would have a breakdown and no one would be able to<br/>
handle it and she would get so out of control that they&#39;d never want<br/>
anything to do with her again.  I think that she sensed this and was more<br/>
aware of herself and her emotions than she usually is with us.  We are<br/>
actually planning a sleep over now, but since she isn&#39;t quite ready for<br/>
this, our whole family is going to sleep over at their house.  Everyone&#39;s<br/>
needs will be met this way.<br/>
<br/>
Long story, I know, but I wanted to let you know that I commiserate and I am<br/>
convinced that Unschooling-type parenting is the ONLY solution for<br/>
&quot;spirited&quot; or &quot;high needs&quot; children.  Really, these children NEED us MORE.<br/>
We have the responsibility to give them that more.  Good luck dealing with<br/>
your husband.  If I was fighting my husband on this issue, I don&#39;t know if I<br/>
could handle it.  I feel for you.<br/>

never want me?&quot; I told him that I was going to take ALL the time Cameron would <br/>

Ben&#39;s attention more (sports and such---&quot;boy-stuff&quot;). I figured I&#39;d lose him by <br/>
the teen years for sure and that I might &quot;get him back&quot; in his twenties. <br/>
<br/>
I was right. Cam&#39;s still a bit of a &quot;Mama&#39;s boy&quot; (in a nice way)---we&#39;re VERY <br/>

little---sports and music and &quot;boy stuff&quot;.<br/>

 <br/>
 <br/>

about my son when I took him to a mommy-and-me class. All the other <br/>

would scream unless he was in the sling and I was walking. Every time <br/>
I stopped moving, he&#39;d scream. He didn&#39;t just accept attachment <br/>
parenting, he *demanded* it (smart kid :-). <br/>
 <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, nodding my head again. One thing I&#39;ve pointed out to my <br/>
relatives is that by giving our kids the option to decide for <br/>
themselves their own comfort levels around others, we are really <br/>
giving them the future ability to follow their own intuition in more <br/>
dangerous circumstances. A child who isn&#39;t forced against their <br/>
intuition to give a grandparent a kiss might be much more likely in <br/>
the future to stand up for the rights of their own body when tempted <br/>
with sex, drugs, or something else they don&#39;t feel comfortable with. <br/>
Most likely, it&#39;s kids who have had the &quot;respect for all adults&quot; <br/>
drummed into them who are at the biggest risk of being abused as well.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; harshly and often.).<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That unfortunately sounds familiar too. But that&#39;s the answer, right <br/>
there in that paragraph. What she believes in *doesn&#39;t work*. It just <br/>
doesn&#39;t. You can&#39;t raise kids to be respectful people by <br/>
disrespecting them. It sounds to me like she&#39;s threatened by the fact <br/>
that you&#39;re parenting differently and that probably deep in her <br/>
heart, she knows that &quot;her way&quot; didn&#39;t work out all that well in the <br/>
end. Some people are able to look the facts in the eye and realize <br/>
that there might be a better way. Some people just can&#39;t deal with <br/>
the cognitive dissonance and revert to lying to themselves and <br/>
pushing their own methods more than ever. People will continue to <br/>
believe that their methods &quot;worked&quot; even as they bail out their kids <br/>
from jail. I had a woman in a campground once expound on her theories <br/>
of parenting to me (which basically boiled down to &quot;smack &#39;em around <br/>
if they don&#39;t behave&quot;) and then she told me that her daughter had run <br/>
away, was on drugs, and was pregnant. So why would she be giving me <br/>
advice? Who knows. People are strange that way. It gets harder, of <br/>
course, when we&#39;re related to them. We have to work harder to turn a <br/>
deaf ear :-)<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So, to sum up a very long story, what do you think about the idea of<br/>
&gt; professional evaluations?  Do they do any good?  <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d say that the answer to that is not always clear. It depends on <br/>
what you want to get out of the evaluation, how good of an evaluator <br/>
you get, how supportive they are of homeschooling, what kinds of <br/>
support or recommendations they can give you, etc. We had our son <br/>
evaluated for SID (sensory integration dysfunction) and went through <br/>
OT (occupational therapy) with him, in addition to doing a lot of <br/>
stuff with him at home. I think the evaluation was helpful, it <br/>
definitely showed us areas that he was really struggling with, and <br/>
our therapist gave us a lot of things we could do to help him out in <br/>
those areas. For him, the SID was interfering with every aspect of <br/>
his life, and making things very difficult for him (and for us). So <br/>
it made a lot of sense to get help in figuring out how to help him <br/>
work through it and make things easier for him. Some of this was <br/>
stuff we were already doing, but some of it I wouldn&#39;t have known to <br/>
do without the therapist pointing it out. She was really great, and <br/>
very supportive of homeschooling. As more and more &quot;special needs&quot; <br/>
kids are homeschooling, I think a lot of the therapists out there <br/>
have become quite supportive of it.<br/>
 <br/>
If there are specific things that you/she are concerned about or want <br/>
to improve, then it might make sense to get an evaluation and therapy <br/>
(esp. if you can get a recommendation for a good therapist). If not, <br/>
then it probably doesn&#39;t make sense. I guess it depends on where on <br/>
the spectrum of &quot;special&quot; she falls. There&#39;s special that just means <br/>
a different way of being in the world, and then there&#39;s special that <br/>
interferes with the child&#39;s natural ability to grow. If she falls in <br/>
the former, then I doubt that an evaluation would help. If she falls <br/>
into the latter, then it might. For our son, many of his behaviors <br/>
were things that we could specifically address with sensory therapy. <br/>
It helped him a lot just to be able to be out and in the world (where <br/>
lights are bright, music is playing on the stereo in stores, people <br/>
are jostling in lines, etc.) without the meltdowns.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I say we should just<br/>
&gt; raise her the way we have been, she&#39;s gotten easier to be around so <br/>
 </span></blockquote>we<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; seem to be doing something right.  <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that&#39;s the case, and if there&#39;s no big hurdles in her way, I don&#39;t <br/>
see why not.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But maybe my husband has a point?<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. One thing that helped me was a book called &quot;The Out-Of-Sync <br/>
Child&quot;. It opened my eyes to the ways in which my son&#39;s brain/body <br/>
were developing, and the things that were going on that were <br/>
hindering him. It had a lot of checklists that gave me an idea of <br/>
which areas were just slightly different, and which areas he had <br/>
severe issues in. It also made me realize that just the attachment <br/>
parenting and being with him were not going to be enough. I had to <br/>
learn new ways of helping him, but nothing that I learned went <br/>
against my basic child-respecting philosophy (and our occupational <br/>
therapist did not either).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My husband and I are in marriage counseling right now and I was <br/>
 </span></blockquote>thinking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of asking the counselor about this.<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s a good idea (thinking in terms of asking the <br/>
counselor about whether or not an evaluation is a good idea). Most <br/>
marriage counselors aren&#39;t all that knowledgeable about this kind of <br/>
thing. I guess it would depend heavily on how much you trust this <br/>
counselor&#39;s general judgement. I&#39;m guessing it would definitely be <br/>
worthwhile to discuss how you want to approach dealing with inlaws, <br/>
especially in the areas where their parenting suggestions run counter <br/>
to your own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kate<br/>
&gt; who is a little confused right now<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I sympathize! There&#39;s no easy answer sometimes, and every person&#39;s <br/>
journey will be different. I&#39;ve found that following our own hearts <br/>
about what was right for our son lead us in the right direction. <br/>
There was a time when we just took it day by day and parented by <br/>
instinct, there was a time when we used therapy for him and <br/>
professionals who understand SID to help us out, and since then there <br/>
have been 2 years with no therapy but with some extra attention paid <br/>
in our own minds to his needs and to helping him get through things <br/>
that are easier for most kids but difficult for him. Remember that <br/>
whatever decision you make today doesn&#39;t have to be binding forever. <br/>
You can always re-evaluate in a day, a month, a year if circumstances <br/>
change. One phrase that often works with well-meaning relatives who <br/>
give advice is &quot;Thanks, I&#39;ll think about that&quot; (even if that means <br/>
I&#39;ll think to myself how stupid it was :-)<br/>

be flushed down the toilet.  I learned long ago to seek out people who <br/>
successfully raised kind, caring (not necessarily rich or successful) children into <br/>
kind, caring adults.  Those type of people are worth their weight in gold...I <br/>
think I&#39;d avoid your MIL as much as possible.  If she asks why she doesn&#39;t get <br/>
to see you or the kids anymore, tell her your feelings truthfully.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when I was still quite a religious person, I heard someone <br/>
elaborate on women as &quot;keepers of the home.&quot;  But instead of the same old <br/>
&quot;submissive&quot; example this person described the keeper more as a gatekeeper or warrior :o) <br/>
....keeping things and people out of the family that will harm the well-being <br/>
of the children and family, even if that meant disagreeing with your husband. <br/>
 I liked that picture.  :o) <br/>
<br/>
I had a child (1st) who clung to me like flypaper.  I was a new Mom (19) and <br/>
so unsure of myself, but everything in me told me to cling right back to her.  <br/>
I can only remember once or twice that she wasn&#39;t with me in her first 2 <br/>
years of life, and that was because hubby wanted me to get away for an hour or two <br/>
to see how she&#39;d do....she cried terribly, and he was always glad when I came <br/>
back up the driveway.  When I got pregnant with #2, she always accompanied me <br/>
to my OB visits and would stand next to the doctor while he examined me.  He <br/>
said once, &quot;I think your daughter wants to become an Obstetrician when she <br/>
grows up&quot; as she stood looking at everything he was doing while my legs were up <br/>
in stirrups...LOL...<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll be fine.  Other than mentioning it to the counselor you&#39;re already <br/>
seeing, I&#39;d stay away from taking her for an &quot;evaluation&quot;...I doubt you&#39;ll agree <br/>
with their advice anyhow.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I had my first, my sister&#39;s kids were 4 and 8.  They were 5 and 9 when <br/>
my second came.  In that time period, her youngest was no longer allowed on her <br/>
lap.  He became unbelievable jealous, because I had two kids on my lap.  Who <br/>
knew there was an age limit?  Now that my son is almost 5, I can&#39;t wait for <br/>
these discussions to happen in my family too.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when they were 6 and 18 months I finally had it with my father <br/>
telling me I was spoiling the oldest by carrying him at the same time as the <br/>
youngest.  So I gave my daughter to my father and let him hold her screaming for a <br/>
few minutes until he relented and passed her back.  <br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t get it.  But I&#39;m beyond the point of needing or seeking their <br/>
approval and have told them that.  It stopped some of their nagging, but not <br/>
all.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel for you, but agree with the other responses, follow your instincts.  <br/>
You&#39;ve had a professional enough evaluation here, tell your mil that the <br/>
judgement is that she is wrong and you are right!<br/>

I don&#39;t have experience with evaluations but I do have experience with a child who prefers only mommy.<br/>
<br/>
When my youngest was born he preferred me to anyone.  He would only be comforted by me and cried if I had to leave the house.  One time at 3years old I was going out and he headed upstairs to his room crying.  I asked where he was going and he just said I&#39;ll stay in my room til you get home.  My husband is a very sensitive caring guy.  All this hurt his feelings terribly.  I think he compensated by spending more time with our older son.  The younger responded by distancing himself even more from his dad.  Once I heard the younger one say to his brother &quot;That&#39;s my mommy YOU have a Daddy&quot;.  <br/>
The point is I think that my husband&#39;s hurt response helped create the distance between them.  Your husband thinks (or has been convinced by others) that there is something wrong with your daughter for preferring you.  That message is easily picked up by your daughter even though he may never mention it in her presence.  <br/>
Or maybe your husband wants to know there is something wrong with your daughter so that means there is nothing wrong with him.  If he could accept the fact that there doesn&#39;t have to be anything wrong with either him or her for her to prefer you it might be easier on him.  <br/>
Writing this has got me thinking about that time in our lives and I remember we were under a lot of stress.  Both Irwin and I were working - him building his business and I building my practise and both of us fighting a lot.  Since I had nursed Jordan for 13 months and spent more time with him ( I worked from home) of course he clung to me rather than to his father.  He clung because the stress and fighting made him insecure and to me rather than his father as I was the one meeting most of his needs.  <br/>
You mentioned that you and your husband are in counselling.  If there has been a lot of stress prior to your getting counselling perhaps your daughter has picked up on that and her clinginess is simply a survival strategy.  <br/>
I know that when  the stress levels in our house went down, the clinging eventually stopped. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this will help in some way. <br/>
