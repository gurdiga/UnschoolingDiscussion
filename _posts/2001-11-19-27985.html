<div id="ygrps-yiv-432438347">&lt;&lt;and don&#39;t see things happening on the list in the same way some others may<br/>
see them&gt;&gt;<br/>

I agree.  And just because something doesn&#39;t look like a flame to me,<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that it isn&#39;t....and just because something does look like a<br/>
flame to someone else, doesn&#39;t mean it is.  Perhaps that is why we shouldn&#39;t<br/>
take the comments of complete strangers so much to heart.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, I was here through the entire Bridget &quot;introduction&quot;.  And while I<br/>
didn&#39;t post my thoughts, they were very much in line with Sandra&#39;s<br/>
responses....however, now that the fur has settled it is easier to see more<br/>
of what Bridget was attempting to relay.  However, I do notice that once<br/>
again, (as we do on a very regular basis) we have returned to the discussion<br/>
of Bridgets&#39;s perceived bashing.<br/>
