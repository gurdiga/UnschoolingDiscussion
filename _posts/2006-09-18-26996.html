<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006435856">I can&#39;t even count the times I&#39;ve been asked this - and it astounds me <br/>
every time...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I was asked more than once why I  <br/>
&gt;would homeschool if I didn&#39;t have to, and why a non Christian would  <br/>
&gt;homeschool.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Saying, &#39;because I love living and being with my kids&#39; just doesn&#39;t cut <br/>
it with them. After astonishment, my next reaction is sadness - they are <br/>
homeschooling because they &#39;have to&#39; and there seems no pleasure in it - <br/>
other than a sense of smug righteousness perhaps!<br/>
<br/>
On a slightly different tack, a few weeks ago, because the christian <br/>
presence in our local support network had become all but overwhelming, <br/>
and I was afraid that new people wouldn&#39;t know it was possible to be a <br/>
non christian homeschooler (let alone unschooler!), I advertised an <br/>
Atheist and Agnostic gathering at my place: &quot;bring your kids, your <br/>
lunch, a change of clothes  (nothing bad here - it&#39;s winter and we live <br/>
in the country and kids get very muddy!) and a smile&quot;. I got an e-mail <br/>
phrased in pretend polite phrases asking, &quot;whatever could there be for a <br/>
atheism (sic) to smile about?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We do have a few christian unschoolers, but most seem to be <br/>
non-christian. Yet the few christian unschoolers I have known are some <br/>
of the most gentle, most respectful of their children.<br/>
<br/>
But mostly it seems like Christians are astounded that I, an atheist <br/>
would choose to be at home with my children, while I am astounded that <br/>
they don&#39;t want to be!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had 3 incidents in the last week that have brought me face to face <br/>
with total disrespect for &#39;kids&#39; and in 2 cases the &#39;kids&#39; included <br/>
&#39;kids&#39; as old as 25!! At times I berate myself for my mistakes and my <br/>
failure to be the respectful, gentle person I&#39;d love to be, but when I <br/>
come up against these sort of people it makes me realise that I have <br/>
come a very long way in the last 1/4 century since I had my first son. I <br/>
think I&#39;ve reached the point now when my sadness for my own shortcomings <br/>
is less than my sadness for these people who don&#39;t even seem to have any <br/>
awareness that things could be different from their miserable <br/>
relationships!<br/>

<br/>
When the best homeschooling information was to be found on a *Prodigy  <br/>
bulletin board (Yeah, slim pickin&#39;s in those days), some moms were  <br/>
speaking very harshly about their kids, how bratty and awful they  <br/>
were, and I said I had read something inspiring that said that since  <br/>
we don&#39;t know when or how Jesus will return, we should all treat our  <br/>
children as though they might be Christ (and I was most consciously  <br/>
thinking this *should* tweak the consciences of all the Christian  <br/>
homeschoolers, who made up 80% of that group of 100 or so, and should  <br/>
be able to recite &quot;inasmuch as ye have done this for least of my  <br/>
brethren, ye have done it for me&quot; (which I might have misquoted, but  <br/>
still, from memory I have the gist of it).<br/>
<br/>
No, one of the badmouthingest of them  shot back quickly &quot;TRUST ME,  <br/>
this child is not the second coming,&quot; and went on about how horrible  <br/>
he was and how resistent he was  to discipline.<br/>
<br/>
So I thought how deeply ironic it was that here I was NOT waiting for  <br/>
Jesus to return, yet treating my children as though they were the  <br/>
direct offspring of God, which in most religions they are quite  <br/>
considered to be, aren&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re still in the French or no French topic, which is fine, but it  <br/>
reminds me that in France religious talk like this seems to give  <br/>
people the willies.  (translate &#39;the willies&#39;...   the creeps.    <br/>
Shivers.  OOogie feelings.  Hairs on arms stand up and people want  <br/>
the conversation changed.)<br/>

<br/>
I forgot the caps and the LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I shudder to imagine how his next ten years went compared to Kirby&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is upstairs in the room above me, watching Lost.<br/>
Last night he was out playing drinking games until he got sick and  <br/>
passed out on a friend&#39;s couch.  That&#39;s not ideal.  But I know where  <br/>
he was and I knew at the time, and he knew I knew, and there was no  <br/>
reason for sneakiness or shame.  And he&#39;s home in his own home by  <br/>
choice, at peace, and safe.<br/>
<br/>
I survived the odd pressures of Christian Homeschoolers, and so did  <br/>
Kirby indirectly.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  People there used to make folders named &quot;Christian...&quot; this or  <br/>
that on that message board.  So not only was the place predominantly  <br/>
curriculum-using folks (ABeka and Sonlight  mostly), they would put  <br/>
up folders designed to keep others out.   So one day I started a  <br/>
topic called &quot;Heathen Homeschoolers,&quot; to discuss the problems of  <br/>
secular homeschoolers.  It got 90 posts in just half a day, and 60 or  <br/>
more were from Christians just cranky that anyone would use a word  <br/>
like &quot;heathen&quot; on what they clearly saw as their message board.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why when AOL&#39;s expansive-like-a-mall message areas came  <br/>
available there was finally, for the first time, a separate place for  <br/>
unschoolers to discuss unschooling.   It was fantastic.   Not as good  <br/>
as what we have now, but it didn&#39;t suck.  (Some kids get their mouths  <br/>
washed out with soap for saying &quot;sucks&quot; and that sucks.)<br/>

Lately, I have been asked a lot by non-homeschoolers about why I <br/>
homeschool our three boys.  We live in a school district which is <br/>
lauded for its test scores and general quality of education.  As my <br/>
oldest gets older (10yo), people become more perplexed.  Some of the <br/>
most recent remarks that leave me shaking my head are:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You must be a saint.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Wow, what alot of work THAT must be.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well, I&#39;m in the school almost every day, so I stay involved that <br/>
way.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I can&#39;t get my 1st grader to do her 15 minutes of homework, how can <br/>
you homeschool?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I could NEVER do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, most people assume that I do school-at-home.  Many people <br/>
assume I am a Christian homeschooler.  When I tell them that I <br/>
don&#39;t, and that I&#39;m not, that usually leads to the question about <br/>
how could I spend all day with them and still be sane.  <br/>
<br/>
This is starting to bother me.  The kids are playing some organized <br/>
soccer so there&#39;s lots of these random remarks at the sidelines.  <br/>
Any snappy comebacks come to mind?  I don&#39;t necessarily want to push <br/>
people away, but they feel free to give me a litany of reasons why <br/>
they choose to send Johnny to school. It&#39;s as if they have to <br/>
explain themselves so I know that they are righteous, good caring <br/>
parents too.  <br/>
<br/>
Really, any thoughts would be welcome.  I&#39;m tired of smiling and <br/>
nodding.<br/>

<br/>
The problem with religious talk is that it either degenerates into<br/>
proselytizing or bashing -- and I don&#39;t find either one an enlightening way<br/>
to converse. I don&#39;t have the pain in my life that some people attribute to<br/>
religion or a religious upbringing, although I can recognize that many<br/>
people have suffered from others using religion as a hammer.<br/>
<br/>
Descriptions of &quot;bad&quot; people of particular faiths (or lack thereof) make my<br/>
teeth hurt as much as evangelicals wanting to discuss the state of my soul.<br/>
The bashing oftentimes comes across as its own form of evangelism, even when<br/>
that&#39;s not the conscious intent.<br/>
<br/>
It happens on this and many other lists; it happens IRL. It&#39;s a personal pet<br/>
peeve. I have no interest in attempting to stop people on lists. I just<br/>
delete. In person, I either change the subject, attempt to add moderating<br/>
comments or extricate myself from the conversation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985908225">We also live in a school district that is considered one of the best <br/>
in the state, having all the bells and whistles, etc. and we are <br/>
also very involved in activities which put us in daily contact with <br/>
those that are very keen on the public school system here. My boys <br/>
are 14 and 11. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried and tried to get my kids involved with a local <br/>
homeschool/unschool group and they resist it like the plague! I&#39;ve <br/>
let them know it&#39;s available and some of the fun stuff that they do <br/>
and I&#39;ve left it up to them whether we attend or not. So far, not.<br/>
  <br/>
The response that I fall back on the most, when inquiring  <br/>
conventional  school minds want to know is, &quot;this lifestyle works <br/>
really well for our family.&quot;  <br/>
When they start inquiring re. how long we will homeschool/unschool, <br/>
I tell them, &quot;as long as it&#39;s working for us.&quot;  Then some may  take <br/>
it further and  want some details on what we do....I&#39;m honest and <br/>
will go into depth with those that seem TRULY interested in the <br/>
alternatives to public schools....many ask and don&#39;t really want to <br/>
hear the answers.  I don&#39;t waste a lot of time or energy on <br/>
answering their questions, but tell them if they really want more <br/>
info, I can email them websites, links to lists, loan them books, <br/>
magazines, etc.<br/>
I am happy to spend the time with those that REALLY want to know.<br/>
<br/>
Also, to those that think, &quot;I&#39;m a saint&quot;, etc.....my response is <br/>
usually very honest when I reply, &quot;I don&#39;t like living by the <br/>
school&#39;s schedule and find that more difficult than enjoying my <br/>
children&#39;s company all day.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

I think that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
You make them uncomfortable so they cover that uncomfortable spot  <br/>
with some rattling on about how hard it must be and how virtuous you  <br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of mammalian behavior, I think they&#39;re showing belly.   <br/>
They&#39;re saying &quot;You&#39;re bigger than me and know more about this; don&#39;t  <br/>
hurt me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So first of all, be gracious.  You won.<br/>
<br/>
Unless they say &quot;Well I actually CARE about my children so I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
do that to them,&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s fine for people who don&#39;t care whether  <br/>
their kids go to college,&quot; you&#39;ve won.  Some messages are the &quot;SNARL-- <br/>

are &quot;please don&#39;t hurt me&quot; behaviors.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could say &quot;I really LIKE being with them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they want to know more maybe you could say &quot;Part of what school  <br/>
does is put a wall between parents and kids&quot;  Then THEY might just  <br/>
want to nod and smile, or they  might think about it and find ways to  <br/>
be closer with their kids even though they&#39;re in school.<br/>

<br/>
What I wrote about treating a child as though he might be the return  <br/>
of Jesus was proselytizing or bashing?<br/>
<br/>
People who eliminate ALL religious talk from thought or speech are  <br/>
limiting their view of the world. To live as though religion didn&#39;t  <br/>
even exist is to make believe.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible to avoid thinking about it, but to (seemingly) suggest  <br/>
that no one else think or talk about it either seems naive and  <br/>
unrealistic.<br/>
<br/>
The history of homeschooling in the U.S. told without mention of  <br/>
religion would be more slanted than the slanted histories taught to  <br/>
kids by some religious curriculae.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are people who are unaware of the realities of  <br/>
fundamentalist homeschooling.  I&#39;ve been in MANY conversations in  <br/>
which liberal homeschoolers totally ignorant of the ugly sides said  <br/>
&quot;We all want the same things for our children,&quot; and things that  <br/>
equated us all.  But without knowing what they&#39;re really doing, it&#39;s  <br/>
best for people to say nothing at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-can recognize that many<br/>
people have suffered from others using religion as a hammer.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Hundreds of thousands are suffering today, homeschooled chidren,  <br/>
being spanked for not finishing their math or for complaining that  <br/>
they don&#39;t want to do &quot;homework.&quot;   Obedience is extended even to  <br/>
cheerfulness.  They are commanded to be cheerful and punished if  <br/>
they&#39;re not.<br/>
<br/>
Yet there are people who defend all homeschooling and call on people  <br/>
like me to be united and  &quot;supportive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Descriptions of &quot;bad&quot; people of particular faiths (or lack  <br/>

even when<br/>

<br/>
If I&#39;ve read their writings for years and someone else hasn&#39;t, how  <br/>
fair and true is it for the other person to refer to my comments as  <br/>
&quot;bashing&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
As I was personally in the middle of that conversation in which  <br/>
someone assured me her son was not the second coming, as a way to  <br/>
justify her intent to continue to treat him entirely disrespectfully,  <br/>
is it bashing for me to tell that story?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have no interest in attempting to stop people on lists. I just<br/>
delete. In person, I either change the subject, attempt to add  <br/>
moderating<br/>
comments or extricate myself from the conversation.-=-<br/>
<br/>
In cases as those above, would the moderating comments not be  <br/>
intended to attempt to stop people, instead of a willingness to  <br/>
accept that maybe those people actually know what they&#39;re talking about?<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;they spank&quot; is not bashing.  Saying &quot;They&#39;re child-abusing  <br/>
freaks who don&#39;t deserve to live&quot; would be bashing, but things like  <br/>
that aren&#39;t said on this list.  There&#39;s that trap door I keep oiled.   <br/>
Calling any discussion bashing is like calling any disagreement  <br/>
&quot;flaming.&quot;  That happens here too.  People will say they were flamed  <br/>
because someone asked them a question.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s anyone here who doubts the cruelty inherent in some of  <br/>
those homeschooling cultures, go and look there.  Read a few issues  <br/>
of Home Schooling Digest, or The Old Schoolhouse.  Read the  <br/>
editorials.  Read the &quot;Making them Do It&quot; chapter of The Survivor&#39;s  <br/>
Guide to Homeschooling.  Read ANY of the pamphlets the Anabaptists  <br/>
give out free at &quot;inclusive&quot; homeschooling conferences.  I wish they  <br/>
were online, but they&#39;re low-tech folks.<br/>

It&#39;s certainly possible to tell stories about religious people that aren&#39;t<br/>
proselytizing or bashing.<br/>

What I wrote about treating a child as though he might be the return<br/>
of Jesus was proselytizing or bashing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-386156979">Thanks for your responses.  You helped me reframe it.  And the image <br/>
of some of the other moms &quot;showing belly&quot; will definitely lighten it <br/>
up for me (bg). <br/>
<br/>
I will be gracious and kind and maybe a little more emphatic that I am <br/>
not burdened by living with my children all day; that I actually enjoy <br/>
it!  It&#39;s just not the language that&#39;s spoken there.  It&#39;s a breach of <br/>
the code.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
