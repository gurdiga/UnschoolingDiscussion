&gt;open casket viewing of dead bodies?  I mean, I understand that <br/>
&gt;originally a wake was to make certain they were really dead, so why do <br/>
&gt;we still do it?  I&#39;ve already told my kids that if they do that to me <br/>
&gt;I WILL come back and haunt them!  <br/>

over death. Tragic accidents are shocking. I&#39;m not talking about that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m talking about the whole death thing. The reticense to discuss wills, <br/>
not wanting children to know about it, or understand it. The whole <br/>
graveyard thing, the funeral. I mean major hang-ups!!!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a law againt being buried at sea, unless you are Navy and only <br/>
under certain circumstances.. that is a hang-up! Companys can dump tons <br/>
of garbage in the ocean but someone can&#39;t tie a rock around a carcass and <br/>
throw it overboard out in deep sea so the fishes can eat.. I mean <br/>
really.. whats the big deal!<br/>

Are you sure we aren&#39;t twins who were separated at birth?  I&#39;ve made <br/>
very similar rants about our hangups over death.  I mean, my uncle was <br/>
83 years old and in pain for god&#39;s sake.  He&#39;s better off now than he <br/>
was five days ago!  Of course showing our usual family stubbornness - <br/>
he waited until St. Paddy&#39;s day to die &#39;cuz that&#39;s when he wanted to <br/>
go out.  The docs gave him 4 to 6 months about 11 months ago!<br/>

almost 1 year old daughter be around her very sick grandfather who was <br/>
dying. Every day we went to his home to visit him. She and he had an <br/>
incredible relationship, and I am so glad that I didn&#39;t think his dying was <br/>
a reason to keep her away from him. My daughter was the only person he <br/>
would wake up out of his morphine stupor for - he asked for her kisses...<br/>
<br/>
I held my grandfather-in-law&#39;s hand when he died. Me holding one hand and <br/>
my husband holding the other. Beautiful... so glad we were with him.<br/>
<br/>
My son died inside of me during labor. I held him for 24 hours - while he <br/>
was dead. Many people were *appalled* that I did so... &quot;How could she hold <br/>
that *dead* baby?&quot; Why? Because he is my son.<br/>
<br/>
I held both of my dogs when we chose to have them euthenized. I was <br/>
literally minutes short of being with my grandmother when she died, and to <br/>
this day, regret that I wasn&#39;t holding her.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that people not being able to talk about death (before or after <br/>
it happens), not being able to be with those who are dying or who are dead, <br/>
etc. is the reason so many who are grieving are left - abandoned, isolated, <br/>
and lonely - very difficult to bare *on top* of grief.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have been berated because Alexandria knew (and knows) so much about <br/>

I cant tell you if its international or US law but its true. The Kennedy<br/>

To WHAT law please?  Who has the authority to say that no bodies are allowed <br/>
to be put into the sea?  It&#39;s not an unreasonable question, is it?  &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
true&quot; isn&#39;t reference or documentation, and the claim was it was a law.<br/>

I dont have time to go looking up a law for you. I saw it on the news at<br/>
the time of his death. That was good enough for me. If you need more proof,<br/>
I suggest you go find it.<br/>

I agree too!  My 1st born son and I lived with my mother and I helped my<br/>
father take care of her when she was dying.  My son was 3yrs old at the time<br/>
and we had lived with them about 2 yrs. before she died ... so he went<br/>
through the whole process.  And I have always been so happy that I was there<br/>
for my parents and she was able to keep her dignity and be surrounded by<br/>
loving, caring family and not strangers.<br/>

To me death is part of life, loving and learning.  It is nothing that is to<br/>
be ashamed of ... we all must go through it someday it is as much a part of<br/>
life as birth, growing and living.  It is the last thing we will do in this<br/>
