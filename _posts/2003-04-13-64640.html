<div id="ygrps-yiv-721747856">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this list to learn more about unschooling.  I have seen some articles on it and am looking for a more specific definition.  Practically, everyday, how does this work.  My oldest will be 10 in May and I have been homeschooling from the very beginning.  I started out very curriculum oriented.  Then as time passed, less and less.  I dont&#39; like lesson planning and even when i do find i don&#39;t use them.  By alot of peoples standards we haven&#39;t &#39;done school&#39; this year.  I&#39;m thinking maybe i&#39;ve turned into an unschooler?  I feel like i am teaching my children, but in no way a traditional approach.  I guess I&quot;m wondering exactly how you unschool and make sure your children are learning and how you respond to others that are very traditional in their approach.  Hope these are all ok questions to ask, I havent&#39; been on the list really long enough to read posts and see how this list is run.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, i have 4 children, Andrew (10), Aaron (4), Adam (2), and Abigail (8months)<br/>

<br/>
When you&#39;re seeing your children learn without teaching them, you&#39;ll be <br/>
closer to unschooling.  That probably sounds stupid at first, but hang around <br/>
until it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There are some definitions of unschooling here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If you just go to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>
choose library and then definitions, but the address above should take you <br/>
straight there, or this might:<br/>

Unschooling?&lt;/A&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I havent&#39; been on the list really long enough to read posts and see how <br/>
this list is run.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Please read a while, too.  It&#39;s a good place to be, and the bulletin boards <br/>
at unschooling.com  have enough reading to last you weeks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040350385">I&#39;m not sure if this got answered or not. I think it may have gotten lost in <br/>
the flurry of list activity over this past weekend.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I just joined this list to learn more about unschooling.  I have seen some <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It works beautifully and it looks nothing like school. :o) It&#39;s hard to give <br/>
a how-to on unschooling, because each days is different, each learning <br/>
moment is different and each child is different. But some principles are the <br/>
same.<br/>
<br/>
In our house, we try to live our lives as if no such thing as school <br/>
existed. We read, play games, cook, garden, go to museums, go to parks, <br/>
travel, craft, explore, experiement, you name it. I&#39;m sure you may have done <br/>
most of those things while using a curriculum too. The difference is in *my* <br/>
understanding about how learning works. I don&#39;t do all these fun and <br/>
interesting things to &quot;get to&quot; the learning. I know from experience that the <br/>
learning will come naturally just by doing all these fun and interesting <br/>
things. I sometimes pre-plan activities, but I don&#39;t pre-plan the outcomes. <br/>
I let the learning lead the way, rather than me trying to lead my kids to <br/>
the learning. Does that make sense?<br/>

rather than you teaching.<br/>

Read more and see what resonates with you. There are lots of articles at <br/>
www.unschooling.com and www.sandradodd.com. Here&#39;s a link to an article <br/>
