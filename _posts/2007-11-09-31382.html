<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563568956">OK I&#39;m having some trouble knowing how to handle certain <br/>
situations.... Today in the car Hunter asked me &quot;Mom can I have a <br/>
peice of gum please?&quot; (which in most cases I always say no because of <br/>
them throwing it on the floor or sticking it to something in the back <br/>
of the van.  But since I&#39;m trying to say No less and Yes more...I <br/>
gave them some.  Then once we got to my Mom I noticed that there was <br/>
gum stuck to the arm rest....so if I give them the gum should I still <br/>
not give a warning of &quot;I don&#39;t want to find it stuck anywhere&quot; or <br/>
should I just see what happens and when it does then address it?<br/>
<br/>
Usually my kids get told No alot but I&#39;m having alot of behavior <br/>
problems with both my kids (more with my almost 5 year old) and since <br/>
I&#39;ve been trying to listen to their needs more (just in the last <br/>
week) I&#39;ve noticed a BIG difference in him.  He has only had 1 or 2 <br/>
big break downs which I was able to help him though by knowing what <br/>
was upsetting him.  <br/>
<br/>
I was so proud this morning....I gave him is clothes so he could get <br/>
dressed in which he did and then I said for him to get his shoes and <br/>
socks on.  He told me he didn&#39;t want to wear any shoes (which <br/>
normally I would of said...You don&#39;t have a choice go get them on), <br/>
so I said OK but what happens if you decide you want to go outside at <br/>
Nanas?  You won&#39;t be able to because you won&#39;t have your shoes on.  <br/>
He says &quot;Thanks OK, I won&#39;t want to play outside&quot; I then said &quot;OK I <br/>
guess you don&#39;t have a need to wear them&quot; and proceeded to get up and <br/>
get my coat on.  He then said &quot;Well I guess maybe I should wear them <br/>
just incase&quot; :)  Wow letting him make that decision instead of <br/>
getting in a heated debate what GREAT!  Did I do this the right way?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for such a long message!  Just trying to get everything worked <br/>
out!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Did he have the wrapper?  If you gave it to him without the paper,  <br/>
and he couldn&#39;t reach kleenex, maybe he didn&#39;t have any idea what to  <br/>
do with it.   Maybe next time make sure he has a kleenex or paper  <br/>

the last time.  Our goal as parents is to help them with future  <br/>

<br/>
Last things first:   There is no one single &quot;right way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Could you do better next time?<br/>
<br/>
Does Nana&#39;s house have stickers in the yard, or broken glass, or dog  <br/>
poo?<br/>
Why couldn&#39;t he play outside there without shoes?<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a real reason, maybe it should&#39;ve been mentioned.<br/>
If there&#39;s not a real reason, maybe  you could re-think it.<br/>
<br/>
Letting him make the decision about shoes is a good one.<br/>
I think I would&#39;ve said, &quot;Well let&#39;s take them in the car just in  <br/>
case you change your mind.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same if a kid doesn&#39;t want to take a coat or a hat, if I know it&#39;s  <br/>
going to be cold or get cold.  I don&#39;t argue with them, and I don&#39;t  <br/>
say &quot;FINE, then don&#39;t take one and I hope you get cold,&quot; I just say  <br/>
&quot;Let&#39;s take it just in case.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391516387">Yes...Thanks for the suggestions on the coat and shoe<br/>
thing.  From now on I&#39;ll just say that :)<br/>
<br/>
The only reason I said that about Nanas house is that<br/>
it is only about 40 degrees here and really don&#39;t<br/>
think it is a good idea that he plays outside without<br/>
shoes since it is so cold.  During the summer...He<br/>
never wears shoes which is probably he still wants to<br/>
do it now even though it is cold.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

You might consider something like that some other time and see how it  <br/>
goes.<br/>

As you decide what you believe about all this, you can figure out  <br/>
which principles you want to live by, and then the decisions will  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-818505993">One day I picked up my near teen from home to go to park day.  She knew <br/>
that we had three or four things to do after park day, and was supposed <br/>
to have prepared for those things.  So, we get to park day and she says <br/>
&quot;mom, I forgot my shoes.&quot;  Well, you can&#39;t go into a hospital, store, <br/>
etc without shoes.  Well, we borrowed a pair froma friend who had an <br/>
extra in the car, but this sorta thing happens often.  Shoes are not a <br/>
priority. <br/>
<br/>
Once my kids got old enough, it wasn&#39;t really my job to remind them <br/>
about shoes, jackets, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, the one time that made me really mad was when I gave the <br/>
girls a packing list for the mountains, in fall, and on the way there my <br/>
9 year old says &quot;oh, mom, I forgot to pack a jacket.  I hate walmart but <br/>
it was the only t hing open. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I&#39;ve forgotten things too, so I couldn&#39;t be too mad. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-597221025">-=-Once my kids got old enough, it wasn&#39;t really my job to remind  <br/>
them about shoes, jackets, etc. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I still remind my husband.  I still help my kids get ready for trips  <br/>
even though they&#39;ve started paying for their own plane tickets.  They  <br/>
all help me too.  I think it&#39;s nicer to help than to say it&#39;s their  <br/>
job.  I remind friends who are going on trips of things they might&#39;ve  <br/>
forgotten, and remind them to take extra car keys and tell them if I  <br/>
know something particular about the weather or something they might  <br/>
need for where they&#39;re going.<br/>
<br/>
The kids will say &quot;Mom will you checklist me?&quot;  and that involves  <br/>
going through all the parts of the trip and naming what I think  <br/>
they&#39;ll need, and they&#39;ll be saying &quot;got it, have it...&quot; after  <br/>
they&#39;ve packed.  Holly has asked me the last few times I went  <br/>
somewhere &quot;Do you have the notes for your talk?  Do you have extra  <br/>
batteries?&quot; and stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404598814">My dd and I recently went somewhere & she forgot her shoes.  I had<br/>
reminded her to get her shoes, but didn&#39;t check to make sure she had<br/>
them once we were in the car.  She was upset when she realized she<br/>
didn&#39;t have shoes and said she wouldn&#39;t be able to go to ____<br/>
(wherever it was we were going, I don&#39;t remember).  Anyway, I finally<br/>
realized that she could wear MY shoes & I went barefoot instead LOL.<br/>
She&#39;s 9 and we wear almost the same shoe size.  Shoes are not a<br/>
priority for her either.  She used to just not wear shoes - even in<br/>
the HOT summers here in Tucson.  She&#39;s gone barefoot in the snow as<br/>
well.  We all shivered just watching her LOL.<br/>

<br/>
Why is planning ahead for a visit such a different skill from math  <br/>

quibble about word choice but it&#39;s profound when trying to clarify  <br/>
your thoughts about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you put &quot;making choices&quot; in the same box as &quot;school math&quot; it&#39;s  <br/>
hard to see how kids will learn by living life.<br/>
<br/>
We are supporting their exploration of the world. In the process they  <br/>
learn all sorts of things, including various strategies in making  <br/>
choices. (We can be there to supply some ideas when they get stuck.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and then we &quot;take the supplies just in case they change<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Only if it&#39;s intended that way. If you&#39;re taking a jacket while  <br/>
thinking &quot;You&#39;re wrong. I&#39;ll show you you&#39;re wrong because you&#39;re  <br/>
going to need this jacket and I&#39;ll have been the superior one who  <br/>
knew to bring it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we are their partners, we aren&#39;t in competition with each other  <br/>
over who made the better decision. We&#39;re just helping each other out.  <br/>
And they&#39;ll do the same for us.<br/>

themselves? If we are trying to teach them to make choices for<br/>

guessing their decisions? Just a thought.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teaching&quot; isn&#39;t the cornerstone of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Helping them learn how to make good choices is a better direction to go.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s wrong with second guessing?  Decision-making doesn&#39;t mean  <br/>
&quot;final answer&quot; decision making.  It means learning to use good  <br/>
judgment for real reasons.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the shoes or coats behind is punitive.  If a mom knows it&#39;s  <br/>
cold and a child is newer to the world, leaving the coat behind is a  <br/>
&quot;serves  you right&quot; situation.  It&#39;s not 1930.  Let&#39;s leave &quot;serves  <br/>
you right&quot; in the past.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not &quot;trying to teach&quot; my children to make choices for themselves,  <br/>
nor have I been making their choices for them.  Since they were  <br/>
little I&#39;ve been letting them make choices, sometimes from a limited  <br/>
set of options for one reason or another, but not for arbitrary  <br/>
reasons.  And I&#39;ll advice and coach, and provide backup options.<br/>
<br/>
When I buy a car, I will choose from a limited set of options.  When  <br/>
I eat breakfast, I will choose from what&#39;s in the house or what I&#39;m  <br/>
willing to walk to the store and buy.  When I got dressed, I chose  <br/>
from a limited set of options.  No one &quot;taught me&quot; to do that.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a function of availability and practicality.   I&#39;m not wearing  <br/>
cowgirl boots and a tutu, but when holly was little she might&#39;ve.  I  <br/>
would&#39;ve carried a coat and some other shoes for her if we were going  <br/>
out, depending on the destination and the weather.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of a coat is not training.  It&#39;s warmth.<br/>
The purpose of shoes isn&#39;t training.  They&#39;re for warmth, safety,  <br/>
sanitation, ease of dancing, noise of clogging/tapping, fashion  <br/>
(depending on the situation and the shoes).<br/>
The purpose of moms is to provide comfort and safety to children.<br/>

You might consider something like that some other time and see how it <br/>
goes.<br/>

As you decide what you believe about all this, you can figure out <br/>
which principles you want to live by, and then the decisions will <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710014274">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;.so if I give them the gum should I still<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not give a warning of &quot;I don&#39;t want to find it stuck anywhere&quot; or<br/>
&gt; should I just see what happens and when it does then address it? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rather than thinking of it in terms of a warning which is inherently <br/>
adversarial, I would offer some help.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When you have finished you can give your gum to me to throw away&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn used to drop the little wrappers off juice box straws on the floor at <br/>
home. I started asking her to give them to me instead, so that I didn&#39;t have <br/>
to bend. Sometimes I would find them on the table - still better than <br/>
bending. Over time she hands them to me less often, and puts them in one of <br/>
the appropriate trash places that are around more often. It has been a long <br/>
time since I found one on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; I was so proud this morning....I gave him is clothes so he could get<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; dressed in which he did and then I said for him to get his shoes and<br/>
&gt; socks on.  He told me he didn&#39;t want to wear any shoes (which<br/>
&gt; normally I would of said...You don&#39;t have a choice go get them on),<br/>
&gt; so I said OK but what happens if you decide you want to go outside at<br/>
&gt; Nanas?  You won&#39;t be able to because you won&#39;t have your shoes on.<br/>
&gt; He says &quot;Thanks OK, I won&#39;t want to play outside&quot; I then said &quot;OK I<br/>
&gt; guess you don&#39;t have a need to wear them&quot; and proceeded to get up and<br/>
&gt; get my coat on. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just bring along the shoes if it really is essential that he wears them <br/>
outside at Granny&#39;s instead of putting him in the position of having to <br/>
choose between two unpleasant in the moment options. This is exactly the <br/>
same as me bringing along a sweater if I know it is likely to be cold and <br/>
Jayn really didn&#39;t want to carry one. It is my chance to be her hero.<br/>
<br/>
BTW Jayn chooses her own clothes, including if she prefers to stay in pj&#39;s <br/>
all day.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Wow letting him make that decision instead of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; getting in a heated debate what GREAT! &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Getting him to make the decision that you wanted him to make, you mean.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Choosing your option after a veiled threat&quot; and &quot;getting into a debate&quot; are <br/>
not the only paths.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370447144">Its a whole mindset thing- are you saying that NOBODY should ever <br/>
remind you or suggest you might need something? And you in turn <br/>
should have the choice to say yes or no?<br/>
<br/>
The difference is kids do not &quot;get&quot; that just because it is warm and <br/>
cozy IN the house that it might be freezing OUT side the house. They <br/>
do not get it because they do not have the experience knowing that <br/>
it is so. <br/>
<br/>
I will send my 4.5 and 3 yr old out to the balcony to see if they <br/>
THINK they need jackets- If I think they may want them as soon as we <br/>
get down the stairs I take them with me-- the funny thing is the <br/>
more I help them the more they now will prepare on their own. <br/>
<br/>
Not taking a jacket and deciding it is COLD should not turn into a <br/>
punishment because the child did not take their jacket and now must <br/>
suffer- how many men lovingly turn over their jackets to silly <br/>
females who think a jacket will look silly over a nice outfit. Men <br/>
do that out of love because they care about you. How would you feel <br/>
if someone said &quot;well you must freeze because you did not bring your <br/>
coat&quot; -- why should we tell a child that-- <br/>
<br/>
you are helping them to live life not teaching them anything<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Marty asked me, when he was little, &quot;When people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count to infinity,  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is that illegal?&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Someone said &quot;You can&#39;t count to infinity,&quot; and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was thinking about  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone tells a child &quot;You can&#39;t go barefooted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when it&#39;s 40  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; degrees,&quot; he&#39;s going to think about that, but it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might not be the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best thoughts.   If he goes outside and is cold,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then he&#39;ll want to  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wear shoes for real-world shoe-reasons, not because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he &quot;has to&quot; or  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because mom thinks it&#39;s a good idea.<br/>

&gt; Same if a kid doesn&#39;t want to take a coat or a hat, if I know it&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; going to be cold or get cold.  I don&#39;t argue with them, and I don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; say &quot;FINE, then don&#39;t take one and I hope you get cold,&quot; I just say  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Let&#39;s take it just in case.&quot;<br/>

when I just grabbed a jacket for her, and she&#39;s been really grateful <br/>
that I remembered her needs for comfort when she didn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
I keep extra clothing and shoes in the car most of the time too, just <br/>
because kids don&#39;t always think about that kind of stuff.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing that for so long now, that my older daughter is starting to think <br/>
about that stuff too, not always, but sometimes.  And sometimes she <br/>
remembers for her little sister and that&#39;s really cool too.</div>

&gt; themselves? If we are trying to teach them to make choices for<br/>
&gt; themselves, and then we &quot;take the supplies just in case they change<br/>
&gt; their minds&quot; aren&#39;t we telling them subconsciously that we are second<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think kids learn by following examples.  No kid wants to be <br/>
uncomfortable.  Even if they &quot;learn their lesson&quot; from being cold, it&#39;s <br/>
still a much better lesson to learn that mom takes care of their needs <br/>
by grabbing those shoes just in case, and that they can do that too <br/>
when they are old enough to think ahead that way.<br/>
<br/>
The benefit is that one day, they will think about it all on their own <br/>
and grab an extra jacket, water bottle, pair of shoes, etc., for you <br/>
too, and you&#39;ll suddenly find yourself ready to go before you&#39;d planned <br/>
because it&#39;s all done already by your thoughtful kids that have watched <br/>
you do it for years.</div>

hadn&#39;t wanted to bring along her sweater after being told to, so the Mom <br/>
left it behind and said to me &quot;That&#39;s how they learn.&quot; The little girl was <br/>
freezing, couldn&#39;t play and in the end the whole family had to leave early.<br/>
<br/>
But what did the little girl learn? That she can&#39;t rely on Mom to protect or <br/>
help her - maybe that she should do as she is told, but you can imagine the <br/>
resentment in her heart at this mean lesson. &quot;Mom was right, darn her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What if Mom had secreted the sweater in her bag, and been able to pull it <br/>
out and hand it to the little girl. The little girl would still have learnt <br/>
that Mom sometimes has good suggestions about when it is cold, but she would <br/>
have had the memory of being loved and saved and warmed. &quot;Gee Mom was right <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re exactly right. The lesson I wanted my children to learn when <br/>
they were toddlers was, you can have what you want and I&#39;ll help you <br/>
get it. I&#39;d always bring the sweater anyway. &quot;Better to have it and <br/>
not need it than to need it and not have it.&quot; How much does a sweater <br/>
weigh? Not much.<br/>
