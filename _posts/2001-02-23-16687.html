<br/>
Thank you so much for the e-mail about debating for <br/>
NJFL. It is possible<br/>
for homeschooled schools to be members of the NJFL. <br/>
Our NFL program for<br/>
9-12th grades have programs that are members but are <br/>
homeschooled. We treat<br/>
each homeschooled program just like it is a high <br/>
school. I currently don&#39;t<br/>
have any homeschooled programs in the NJFL but I would <br/>
welcome them in the<br/>
program with open arms. The difference between the <br/>
high school program and<br/>
the NJFL is this: we allow points to be earned in NJFL <br/>
just by the work<br/>
they do within the classroom and not always out <br/>
competing each other. If<br/>
they do have debates that is just an extra plus for <br/>
them. The problem is<br/>
that when we first started this program we did not know <br/>
which 6-8th grade<br/>
students were actually out competing at tournaments or <br/>
for that matter if<br/>
the schools allowed them to travel and compete. So we <br/>
designed this program<br/>
for students to earn points not only for competition <br/>
but work done within<br/>
the classroom. The senior high program doesn&#39;t allow <br/>
this benefit they must<br/>
earn their points by competition. The things that earn <br/>
points is speeches,<br/>
book reports, class announcements, or anything that <br/>
gets them up and<br/>
speaking in front of a group of people and this can be <br/>
done all within the<br/>
classroom. Now if you do have a debate between the <br/>
only local group as you<br/>
describe they can earn points for this. It does not <br/>
matter to me to whom<br/>
they compete against or what type of group they are we <br/>
just want them to get<br/>
the experience anyway they can and earn points for it. <br/>
It does not matter<br/>
even if the homeschooled program has one student or <br/>
more everyone is<br/>
welcomed. I have schools in Texas who are members they <br/>
included schools<br/>
from Portland, Flower Mound, Highland Village, San <br/>
Antonio, and Spring. The<br/>
Spring school is Twin Creeks Middle School but I do not <br/>
know if there<br/>
program does debate but if you are interested in <br/>
contacting them I can give<br/>
you that information so you can check. Also there is <br/>
going to be a National<br/>
Speech tournament June 29-30th, 2001 in Ohio. This is <br/>
an invitational<br/>
tournament and any and all NJFL member schools are <br/>
welcomed to come and<br/>
compete with other people from around the US. The only <br/>
problem is they will<br/>
not do any debate rounds. The rounds they will be <br/>
doing is in Original,<br/>
Oratorical, Drama, Humor, Duo, Duet, Prose, & Poetry. <br/>
If you are interested<br/>
I can send you the material from our office for you to <br/>
look at but you will<br/>
need to e-mail me your mailing address. Also let me <br/>
know if you want the<br/>
contact info from any the Texas schools or the National <br/>
Tournament info.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You<br/>
