&gt;Tia, can I ask a question since you know more about it than I do? If it was <br/>
&gt;an unintentional result of another virus victim, why would it come as a <br/>
&gt;direct result of a post I made. Why did it come &quot;re: alwaylearning} <br/>
&gt;Philosophy&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because it got your address from the original and just replied.  I got <br/>
one from a friend once that had the subject &quot;Guess what we got?  A <br/>
TILLER!&quot;  lol.  So, I opened the email (not the attachment, though).  <br/>

As a former mountain climber I remember quoting &quot;because it&#39;s there&quot; when <br/>
asked why we climbed mountains.<br/>
Some famous mountain climber (I believe it was Hillary) used to say it and <br/>
many climbers use it now.<br/>
Another thing was &quot;do you climb to get to the top, or do you get to the top <br/>
to climb?&quot;, the answer would depend on how tired I was, and how far from the <br/>
top!! LOL<br/>
I already like your Grandma, what a cool lady.<br/>
