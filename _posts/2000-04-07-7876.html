<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260391887">Hi there, I happen to be one of those terrible moms who didn&#39;t breast feed <br/>
my children.  I think with my first daughter the decision was made because of <br/>
a lack of information on my part.  When my son was born 2 years later I did <br/>
try to breast feed him.  It was quite pleasurable, as long as I was nursing <br/>
on the left side.  The right side was another story.  I can&#39;t describe the <br/>
strange sort of pain I felt.  It wasn&#39;t anything like the normal pain I was <br/>
feeling on the left side, and it didn&#39;t go away.  For some reason my right <br/>
breast (especially the nipple)  is very, very sensitive (all the time).  I <br/>
talked to my doctor who dismissed me saying &quot; no one&#39;s body is perfectly <br/>
symmetrical.  We&#39;re not exactly the same on both sides - not in shape, size <br/>
or sensation&quot;.  So, I stopped breastfeeding my son.  I didn&#39;t even try with <br/>
my next daughter.  I was very discouraged at that point.  When my fourth baby <br/>
was born, 14 months ago, I did try to nurse her.  She was injured at birth <br/>
(by the same doctor who gave me the advice on symmetry) and because of low <br/>
muscle tone she had problems latching on and sucking.  I was totally stressed <br/>
out!  There was just too much going on.  It was our first year of <br/>
homeschooling, my baby was hurt, and I knew that to successfully breastfeed <br/>
her was going to take lots of time and energy (especially since I&#39;d basically <br/>
be doing it for the first time).  Besides all that I never did figure out <br/>
what the problem with my right breast was...or is.  So, I quit.  I spent the <br/>
first few months of her life avoiding some of the very people who <br/>
could/should have been supporting me.   You know why?  Because I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to hear the breastfeeding lecture...again.  I know it&#39;s best for the baby!  I <br/>
know! I know! I know!  And guess what?  I think homeschooling is best for <br/>
kids.  But I don&#39;t go around preaching about it to every person I meet.  In <br/>
fact, I don&#39;t even talk about it unless someone asks me to.  I figure that <br/>
everyone has their reasons for doing things the way they do.  Most people are <br/>
doing all they know  they&#39;re capable of doing for their families with the <br/>
circumstances they&#39;ve been given.  Notice I didn&#39;t say ARE capable of doing.  <br/>
We&#39;ve all had times when we were capable of doing more than we&#39;ve actually <br/>
done.  Maybe I just got lucky, but all of my kids have been very healthy.  No <br/>
ear infections, no allergies, and only the occasional cold.  They&#39;re right on <br/>
target for weight, and have met all of their developmental milestones at the <br/>
&quot;appropriate&quot; time ( except for my youngest, but that has nothing to do with <br/>
what I&#39;m feeding her)  Oh yeah!  They&#39;re really smart too. BG.  And when the <br/>
young daughter of an acquaintance said to me as I was bottle feeding my baby <br/>
one day last sumer  &quot; Ugh!  why are you feeding her that yucky stuff&quot;?  I <br/>
explained the best way I could. Then I said a silent prayer of thanksgiving <br/>
that she was alive and that I was able to feed her at all.  The birth of my 1 <br/>
year old was a major life altering event for me.  I no longer worry about the <br/>
trivial things in life (well, not as much as I used to anyway).  Who cares <br/>
what the house looks like?  Or, the clothes, or my hair, or the car?  I&#39;m too <br/>
busy loving the children I&#39;ve been blessed with to worry about what other <br/>
people think.  And I for one, have certainly got better things to do than to <br/>
monitor the parenting choices of others.  Okay, all that being said...I do <br/>
want to say that if there is a baby number 5 in my future I will most <br/>
definitely try again to breastfeed.  When that time arrives, I believe I&#39;ll <br/>
need lots of advice.  And I think I know just where I can find it.  Baby <br/>
needs me...gotta go.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656330431">This is totally an unschooling topic it follows that parents who choose to let there children wean<br/>
will also let there children choose when to learn any new skill. There is no way to disimate the<br/>
topics. As far as bottles go that is a personal issue too. I BF all for one month only(except #2<br/>
who BF untill I got Pregnant with #3) and they gave up there bottle when they got good and ready.<br/>
Andrew age 9 months (when he learned to walk)<br/>
Linwood age 4 (because his Baby sister didn&#39;t have one anymore!)<br/>
Felicia age 2ish (I don&#39;t exactly remember because it wasn&#39;t important to us.)<br/>
It always struck me as hipocritical that those who claimed to have there children weanned allowed<br/>
there kids to run around with a sippy water bottle or one of those koolaid bottles hanging out of<br/>
there mouth. The only difference I could see was that the bottle doesn&#39;t spill as easily! <br/>

&gt;       I am new here.  Please don&#39;t take offense, but isn&#39;t this an unschooling<br/>
&gt; list???  I have not seen a post yet that had to do with unschooling.  Since the<br/>
&gt; current topic seems to be breastfeeding/weaning, I thought I would add my 2<br/>
&gt; cents:  Why would you nurse any longer than you would bottle feed?  I think you<br/>
&gt; folks would agree that a 4 or 5 year old with a bottle would be a bit<br/>
&gt; ridiculous!  What is the difference with the breast?<br/>
&gt;       Please inform me now if this list goes off-topic habitually.  If so, I must<br/>
&gt; unsubscribe.  I find it a bit ridiculous to have to keep deleting  breastfeeding<br/>
&gt; posts on an unschooling list!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Amy!<br/>
<br/>
There are many more things you can do instead of ending the nursing session<br/>
that work much better and dont cause broken five month old baby hearts and<br/>
missed nursings.  (in fact- not nursing him could lead to other problems,<br/>
like nursing strikes and like you mentioned, engorgement)<br/>
<br/>
To really help you, I need more information- but here goes<br/>
<br/>
*pull him in towards you as he is biting, he will let go<br/>
<br/>
*a baby can not bite while he is nursing, his tongue covers his teeth while<br/>
he nurses.  put your hand right by his jaw, and be ready to feel when he<br/>
pulls his tonge back- when he does, put your finger between his jaws and<br/>
stop the bite.<br/>
<br/>
*if he acts like he wants to nurse *nurse him*, if he goes to bite, do the<br/>
above- then offer your breast again.  Listen to if he really doesnt want to<br/>
nurse or if maybe he would rather have the other side . Babies are extremely<br/>
aware of milk flow and supply- and know which breast they want and when they<br/>
want it if allowed to decide for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
* babies bite for lots of reasons: teething, maybe he has a pacifier or<br/>
sippy cup that he has enjoyed biting and tried it on you, frustration (maybe<br/>
he didnt really want to nurse, maybe your milk wasnt coming fast enough,<br/>
etc)- also it depends on the age of the baby- your little guy is a tiny one!<br/>
Don&#39;t think of this as &quot;discipline&quot; or &quot;punishment&quot;- he is trying to<br/>
communicate something to you- hanging back and listening to him will go a<br/>
long way to developing trust and solving this problem.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck Sweety!<br/>
Happy nursing<br/>

<br/>
Why do you feel she &quot;needs&quot; to wean? Is there a reason, or is there just some <br/>
societal view you are accepting that says she&#39;s &quot;old enough&quot;?<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in weaning, I think children wean themselves when they are <br/>
good and ready.<br/>
I have read that when the child gets older, you neither offer the breast nor <br/>
refuse it.<br/>
But it sounds like she is still asking. Listen to her.<br/>

Just curious why you feel that way? I think it should be the child who <br/>
decides when they are ready. Believe me they won&#39;t wait until they are 16!!! <br/>
I had unsuccessful attempts to bf my first 3 for very long. Only a few <br/>
months with each one. No support system and I really didn&#39;t know what to do. <br/>
Never even heard of LLL then. With my 4th, being in a homeschool support <br/>
group who was very pro nursing, I was ready for the long haul in spite of <br/>
what my in laws were saying. Unfortunately for me, my Alyssa weaned herself <br/>
at a year and half. I would give anything to have those days back. I would <br/>
ask her like every 15 mintues if she wanted to nurse. I was so upset. But <br/>
she was just ready to stop even though I wasn&#39;t. Enjoy this time, it won&#39;t <br/>
last forever.<br/>

Amy, Bronwen gave some great advice and I do say also to hang in there. From <br/>
my own experience and also that of others, the biting doesn&#39;t seem to last a <br/>
long time. If they are properly latched on, they can&#39;t bite so just be aware <br/>
when the baby is losing interest or just playing around. My last one did it <br/>
a couple of times I think to just try out something new. They have no idea <br/>
at that age that they are hurting you. I think mine did it like 3 times and <br/>
each time startled and hurt me so much I actually yelled out. Startled her <br/>
too and of course I pulled her away and stopped nursing. It was always when <br/>
she was ready to stop that she would fool around anyway. Then she just never <br/>
did it again.<br/>

Just for the record, I do not agree with weaning a child (unless there were <br/>

In Hawaii there was usually at least one topless female sunbathing.<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>

Wouldn&#39;t they wonder why the women in the crowd weren&#39;t getting all riled up? <br/>

There were the typical Mardis Gras scenes, with women showing their breasts <br/>
to get beads. The kids and I talked about how our country is so wacky about <br/>
nakedness.<br/>
That guys wouldn&#39;t get so riled up over seeing a pair of breasts if it was <br/>
common place or acceptable at the beach at least.<br/>
I doubt many European males will throw beads at a woman just to get a quick <br/>

tiny amount is stored between feedings, although it sure can feel like a<br/>
lot, for some women!<br/>

One of the best ways to increase production is take a &quot;baby vacation&quot;.  Wipe<br/>
everything else off the calendar, and spend all your time hanging out with<br/>
the baby, letting her nurse whenever and how much she wants.<br/>
