<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865336215">I&#39;ve been lurking for a while but I just want to thank you for this <br/>
list. I had a bad day yesterday triggered by my food allergies, but I <br/>
was focused on the lack of help I get in picking up the never-ending <br/>
messes. <br/>
<br/>
I was feeling like a failure and a victim. But I woke up early and <br/>
thought &quot;I&#39;ll search the unschooling board for advice on this&quot;. And I <br/>
found a great discussion that was SO helpful (early September 2004 if <br/>
you want to check it out).<br/>
<br/>
Now I feel equipped to try again. My new mantra &quot;I choose joy over <br/>
grumpyness&quot;<br/>

It&#39;s easy to induce grumpiness.  I could make myself and my whole  family so <br/>
miserable by the end of the day that Keith would want a divorce and  the kids <br/>
would want to move out ANYwhere else.  <br/>
 <br/>
I choose not to. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Here are lots of encouraging links along that vein:<br/>

I went looking for some place to save your post for posterity, and was  <br/>
asking Keith and Holly what was an easy-to-remember word for affirmation or  happy <br/>
thoughts.  I went to start a page, and found this one:<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chore/joy_">http://sandradodd.com/chore/joy_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chore/joy)">http://sandradodd.com/chore/joy)</a> <br/>
where I had already collected some sweet, positive happy-thoughts.  <br/>
 <br/>
So, Jennifer, if you found some things from the 2004 discussion you think  <br/>
would be good to add, please send them to me (or post them here if you  want).<br/>
