<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186871575">Hi Lisa,<br/>
I recognize your name from unschooling.com message boards. Is there <br/>
an easier way to talk back and forth without going from this site <br/>
back to email? I feel silly, but I just havent figured it out yet. I <br/>
didnt really have anything on my mind tonite. I was specifically <br/>
using tonite to make sure I did figure it out. Hehe. I wanted to make <br/>
sure I didnt miss out on any more conversations. Thanks <br/>
Tamie</div>
