<div id="ygrps-yiv-857372618">I had a recent &quot;failure&quot; in this area.  We had a warranty technician in<br/>
our home to do some minor repairs.  He was overbearing and obnoxious.<br/>
And eating up too much of our time.  All gab, very little work, did not<br/>
give me confidence in our builder/house etc.  One day as I was trying to<br/>
&quot;gently&quot; refocus this guy on his work so I could attend to the<br/>
children&#39;s needs; he ignored my gentle prodding and continued to gab.<br/>
So Abby (8yo) politely enters the conversation and says simply, &quot;Don&#39;t<br/>
you have a lot of work to do?  And don&#39;t you think you ought to be doing<br/>
it?&quot;  The guy gives her this crap about &quot;Don&#39;t you think you ought to<br/>
respect your elders? And don&#39;t you think kids ought to leave grownups<br/>
alone?&quot;  I was seething...<br/>
<br/>
In hindsight, I wish I had told him that Abby is absolutely right,  and<br/>
that he has no right to disrespect her.  I wish I had then asked him to<br/>
leave.  Abby and I have talked about it a lot since,  and I tell the<br/>
story to other adults within her earshot, so she knows I am proud of her<br/>
and that I wasn&#39;t so proud of me.  I thought I had made such progress in<br/>
this area,  but I&#39;m sliding.<br/>
<br/>
I finally did talk to the guys supervisor.  Then the guy gets pissed and<br/>
asks if I&#39;m &quot;trying to get him fired&quot;  I was a bit scared of him and<br/>
felt somewhat threatened by that.  After all,  he&#39;s been in my home,<br/>
even worked on locks.   I rationalized that I was being a bit paranoid<br/>
because it&#39;s uncomfortable to let others in your home and trust them.<br/>
(though the plumber and the carpet guy amd the heating and air people<br/>
etc never gave me that yucky gut feel) Gotta quit letting logic defeat<br/>
my intuition!<br/>

I&#39;ve told people (but friends, not strangers) that I&#39;m at work when I&#39;m home <br/>

<br/>
If I visit my friends at work, they say &quot;Just a minute&quot; for phone or talking <br/>
to co-workers, and that&#39;s how it is when others come here.  <br/>
<br/>
If they want my undivided attention, they better take me to dinner and a <br/>
movie! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve interrupted lots of adult conversations with &quot;Just a minute,&quot; and then <br/>
turned to Holly or Marty and said &quot;Did you need me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t like it they can leave.<br/>
Or kiss my ass and leave, if they&#39;d prefer.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to get that guy fired, but I WOULD request a different techni<br/>
cian next time, or ask his supervisor  to tell him in advance that you don&#39;t <br/>
want to socialize, just get your stuff fixed quickly and efficiently and <br/>
politely.<br/>

Don&#39;t do that! I am a great believer in intuition. I don&#39;t know what to<br/>
suggest beyond endorsing the idea of asking for a different person from<br/>
the supervisor - but I say do trust your intuition/feelings about people<br/>
and their behavior like this. You may be picking up subliminal clues. A<br/>
tradesman who has been to your house has a thousand ways of taking<br/>
revenge in paltry ways, and frankly I might be considering different<br/>
locks if the person who had been working on them made me feel nervous<br/>
for no logical reason. (I keep thinking of Rebecca Smart)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468718114">Robyn and Sandra,<br/>
I did talk with the supervisor.  In fact,  dh insisted we have a<br/>
face-to-face meeting.  SO the supervisor comes out and actually fixed<br/>
the locks in question, for one.  I had thought it through and did tell<br/>
him I don&#39;t want that technician again.  I was able to find some<br/>
specific behaviors that I could point out.  The primary one being that<br/>
he asked if I&#39;m &quot;trying to get him fired&quot;.  And I have actually thought<br/>
of many more specifics that built up my distrust of him.  (When he was<br/>
in our basement,  he would *look things over* and ask if I wanted to<br/>
sell them; he frequently mentions the poor quality of subcontractors<br/>
used by the builder)  I know it would come down to my word against<br/>
his...and the supervisor is very loyal to his employees.  I found myself<br/>
wishing I had recorded some of these conversations!  But I did insist<br/>
that he send a different technician.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of what gets my shorts in a bundle is the attitude even the<br/>
supervisor has about &quot;homeschooling, stay at home moms&quot;.  He says in<br/>
almost every conversation...well, you&#39;re home all the time.  I have<br/>
explained to him that I certainly am Not  and that even if I were, I<br/>
need the courtesy of a call to schedule work at the house.  However, I<br/>
find I often don&#39;t get my point across because I couch it too &quot;gently&quot;.<br/>
I asked Joe (dh) later how I did and he said he thought I was too easy<br/>
on him.  <br/>
<br/>
I had been doing so much better in this area last year!  I even got<br/>
called a &quot;hothead&quot; for the first time in my 38 (then) years!  Joe says I<br/>
need to maintain some of that &#39;hotheadedness&#39; ...meaning say what I<br/>
think and don&#39;t be concerned about how the other people feel.<br/>
<br/>
I have another test of this currently.  Our neighborhood is newly<br/>
build/building and has a Social Committee.  They were haphazardly<br/>
electing new officers at the last meeting.  Prior to the meeting several<br/>
neighbors asked me if I would be an officer.  I said &quot;no&quot;.  When they<br/>
asked, I explained that I didn&#39;t consider planning social activities to<br/>
be an area of talent for me.  To one of them I confided that I do not<br/>
want to commit to anything this year.  To one I (who knows about my<br/>
parents deaths and my exhausting caregiving experience),  I confided<br/>
that I consider myself on sabbatical (&quot;year of rest&quot;) for this year.<br/>
And that means my needs and those of my dh and children consume my time.<br/>
Specifically, it means I certainly would not make long term commitments,<br/>
though I may assist in small ways if it falls into place.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,   at the meeting, when no one was volunteering,  this neighbor<br/>
announces that she has a &#39;package deal&#39; in mind - she will be VP and I<br/>
(me) will be secretary.  I said no and said I had other commitments for<br/>
this year that do not allow time for this.  But these people continue to<br/>
ask me if I&#39;ve &#39;thought about it&#39; and the neighbor seems to think I am<br/>
the secretary. <br/>
<br/>
I know that I need to put my position in writing, but have avoided it. I<br/>
am spending way too much time wondering how pissed the neighbor will be;<br/>
will it affect our dd&#39;s (her 5yo) has become friends with my dd.<br/>
<br/>
Susan ...needs ome communication lessons!<br/>
PS. An INFP with a very strong introversion on a &#39;social committee&#39;??? <br/>
