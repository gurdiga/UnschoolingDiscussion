&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; My childhood was happy and fairly carefree &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I can say this about my childhood as well. <br/>
<br/>
And I also have to say that it was probably one of the biggest <br/>
stumbling blocks for me in changing from traditional parenting.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that if you come from a NOT good childhood, it&#39;s <br/>
fairly easy to say, &quot;DOH - I&#39;m not going to do that!&quot; and<br/>
search for <br/>
something better.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe it&#39;s not)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; so words just mean words. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think (not to dredge up past discussions - well, ok, maybe a little <br/>
shovelful) that there was a huge discussion on this list about the <br/>
words &quot;short-order cook&quot; and how those words can be used.  <br/>
<br/>
I had to think about those words for a LONG time - at first I<br/>
didn&#39;t see anything wrong with them. But then, I tried to think<br/>
of one - just one - instance in using those words where good, calm, <br/>
happy, peaceful thoughts would be felt by both the sayer and the <br/>
sayee.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t do it.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, (not always and never when there was hurt or injury <br/>
involved), when I would trip or stumble my dad would say,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you do for an encore, Grace?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I still smile to myself when I think about it. My dad died in 1992 <br/>
(way too soon) and when my brothers and I get together, that is one <br/>
of the phrases we bring up fondly.  I was always very good at sports <br/>
and not clumsy. (So was my dad.) Isn&#39;t there a <br/>
kinesthetic &quot;intelligence&quot; about moving your own body? <br/>
Anyway, I have it. <br/>
<br/>
So this comment by him was a joke to me and I thought it was funny. <br/>
He didn&#39;t say it often. I don&#39;t remember how old I was when<br/>
he first said it to me.  I do remember when it hit me what it meant - <br/>
I was probably 10 or 11 - and I laughed.  I thought it was pretty <br/>
clever.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t use that phrase now when someone stumbles.<br/>
<br/>
Not with my children and or anyone else I care about. <br/>
<br/>
( I guess maybe I might use it at an adult party or something - I <br/>
have a pretty sarcastic sense of humor and people seem to find me <br/>
amusing. )<br/>
<br/>
I just can&#39;t think of how those words would build anyone up.<br/>

who realizes now that it&#39;s always the things that I defend the<br/>
most that most need to be examined. . . . .</div>

Good story, Mercedes.<br/>
<br/>
The same words said to someone who was acutely aware of her own clumsiness <br/>
could&#39;ve been devastating.  To you it was cute, because a false step was rare <br/>
for you physically.<br/>
<br/>
On another list someone said something about me not have carefully considered <br/>
something or other I had written about (not in those very words), but it <br/>
didn&#39;t hurt my feelings at all.  It just wasn&#39;t remotely true.<br/>
<br/>
One time Marty said something, in a joking way, in a joking situation, and I <br/>
said with mock sympathy, &quot;Poor thing.  You&#39;re just not very smart, are you?&quot;   <br/>
He came straight back with mock agreement.     (I think he had accidentally <br/>
provided a straight line for someone else&#39;s zinger.)<br/>
<br/>
If I had a child who was a little slow in the mental uptake, I would never <br/>
ever joke about not very smart.  It wouldn&#39;t be a joke.  With Marty, in the <br/>
context of verbal reparte, there&#39;s no chance he will lose confidence in his <br/>
ability to bandy words.  If someone said &quot;you&#39;re not very smart&quot; and really MEANT it <br/>
to sting, I don&#39;t think it would sting him.<br/>
<br/>
If someone said to me &quot;You clearly care nothing about your children, since <br/>
you didn&#39;t even send them to school,&quot; I wouldn&#39;t respond in any frightened way, <br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t think for half a second &quot;ooh, maybe that&#39;s true.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remember being and being around school kids, and how the insults flew in <br/>
all directions, and how many struck home because of the real lack of self esteem <br/>
and confidence all around us.  That&#39;s a whole different world.  But just as <br/>
homeschoolers can do school-style damage at home if they&#39;re not careful to <br/>
avoid it, parents can inflict word-damage on children if they&#39;re not constantly <br/>
aware.<br/>

Bless his heart, he takes it all seriously, personally, doesn&#39;t laugh or if <br/>
he does, you can see it hurts him (noticed many times when it came from someone <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748428379">I was so glad to see this post.  I have been lurking for quite a while trying to get a feel for the list.  My youngest two children, a ds10 and a dd11 were also adopted at the ages of 6 and 7.  I actually don&#39;t think of them as adopted; I think of them as born from my heart, and that it just took a bit more time than usual for us to find each other.<br/>
       I&#39;m on this list because I have been home schooling them since the beginning.  My sense was to protect them and provide a safe, loving place for them to heal and to bond with their family. I knew that school would be a cruel place for them.  I also felt that we had so much time to make up for, and I didn&#39;t want to share them for several hours a day with a school system.  These are the things I knew.  However, my &#39;mommy radar&#39; tells me that there is more I can do (or maybe stop doing:0), that there is something about this whole &#39;me being in charge of the schooling thing&#39; that isn&#39;t quite a fit.  Hence I sought and found this list and I am learning.  I can&#39;t help but think of something I heard Maya Angelou say once...I&#39;m paraphrasing...&#39;I did the best I knew to do, but when I knew better, I did better.&#39;  I&#39;m seeking a way to bring my children into an even stronger place.<br/>
  <br/>
I think I&#39;ve found the sort of village that I need that may not mind helping us sort out all the healing, learning, growing, or whatever comes by.  I&#39;ve got a lot of unschooling to do, miles of head tape to erase, and two beautiful children that are worth all the effort.  So I&#39;m going to keep listening, but I also realize that it might be nice to chime in from time to time.<br/>
