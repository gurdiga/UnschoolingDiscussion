<div id="ygrps-yiv-315365985">A few days ago, I was explaining to Lars that if we want to stay on the <br/>
public school program we&#39;ve been in for years, we&#39;re going to have to <br/>
change the way we do things a bit.  (The carrot is the computer and the <br/>
internet access, along with a fair bit of money.)  I was thinking we would <br/>
have to leave the program.  Things change at grade 8, (He&#39;s registered 2 <br/>
grades back from what he &quot;should&quot; be) and they want much more specific <br/>
reporting, with certain subjects covered, etc. starting in grade 8.<br/>
<br/>
The online teacher has said that we could do an Individual Education Plan <br/>
with him.  I asked what that would involve, and he gave as an example, <br/>
&quot;Well, maybe we could contract with Lars to read 2 books per month and <br/>
write about them in his own words.  I&#39;m guessing there would be similar <br/>
things in other subjects.<br/>
<br/>
I just assumed Lars wouldn&#39;t want to do this, and I certainly would leave <br/>
the program before making him.  But he surprised me by saying that he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t mind doing that now.  (I&#39;m pretty sure that *I&#39;ve* got the <br/>
unschooling mindset, but I really doubt now that I&#39;ve gotten it across to him.)<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was that he was looking for more structure, and I tried to <br/>
explore what he might be looking for.  I told him that I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
willing to impose structure on him, but I could help him decide what kind <br/>
of structure he might be needing and asked him to think about <br/>
it.  (Remember this is the kid who doesn&#39;t like talking about feelings and <br/>
hates making decisions.)<br/>
<br/>
So today I asked him whether I had maybe jumped the gun on the structure <br/>
thing, and that maybe what he really meant was that he&#39;d be willing to do <br/>
that much to keep the computer.  He said no, he would like to start that <br/>
now.  I started going into the, &quot;I&#39;m not willing to impose structure, but <br/>
we could talk about how I could help him find what he&#39;s looking for&quot; <br/>
routine.  He listened for a minute and then asked if he could use the <br/>
computer.  Ok, end of conversation for now.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A while later, I told him that I understood that he&#39;d like to start doing <br/>
some reading and then writing about what he&#39;d read, and asked what was <br/>
stopping him from doing that now.  No answer.  Again I asked him to think <br/>
about it.  I told him that as far as I could see, the only thing needed was <br/>
motivation, and I couldn&#39;t supply that.  I left it that he needed to think <br/>
about what he needed from me.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind, especially those of you who haven&#39;t heard my stories, that <br/>
I&#39;ve tried imposing structure on him in the past at a couple of different <br/>
times.  It just turned into a battle that I&#39;m not willing to repeat.  I&#39;d <br/>
sooner send him to school.  Another thing is that he seems to be vegging a <br/>
lot, and I often think he&#39;s bored, but he seems to have no interest in <br/>
anything I suggest.<br/>
<br/>
All but one of his friends go to school, and that one is doing a rigid <br/>
correspondance version of high school.  I often think that he believes he&#39;s <br/>
stupid because of the things his friends seem to know that he doesn&#39;t.  I <br/>
try to talk about his strengths, especially to other people when I know he <br/>
can hear.  But he still seems to think he&#39;s stupid.  I think he believes <br/>
that he has to do the school structure thing sometime, that he&#39;ll need all <br/>
that stuff his friends &quot;learn&quot; in school.  This while watching his mother <br/>
learn one thing after another with no teaching or real structure involved.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas what this is about and what I can do to help him?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sound to me like he&#39;s doing a sulky teen-age thing.  Keep talking to <br/>
him.  If it felt okay, I might ask hom flat-out if he thought he <br/>
should do the school thing because everyone else does.  Maybe he will <br/>
open up.<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s a thought:  Maybe he feels overwhelmed with trying to <br/>
figure out what to learn.  There is so much stuff out there it&#39;s hard <br/>
to choose.  I know that for me, that overload always brings me to a <br/>
screeching halt - - when I get to the point where I have way more to <br/>
do than humanly possible, I can&#39;t get anything done.  I have to stop <br/>
and consciously set priorities and get rid of the stuff I don&#39;t really <br/>
want to do.<br/>
So, maybe if you bought him a book about what a curriculum should have <br/>
(the What your x grader needs to know series, I don&#39;t like the grade <br/>
level thing, but they are concise for this purpose) and he could work <br/>
through it at his leisure?<br/>
<br/>
Here another thought:  Buy him some computer software,  there are high <br/>
school programs that have english, math, science etc.  If he likes the <br/>
computer, that might be a better way for him to learn anyway.  Also, <br/>
look into cool software like, Zap and Dr. Sulphur for science.  Way <br/>
cool stuff!<br/>
<br/>
But most of all, keep him talking to you.  Ask him lots of questions, <br/>
tell him what you are doing, talk about the weather, but don&#39;t let him <br/>
shut you or the world out.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure about that.... maybe with some kids but I would put all kids who follow a lead need that talk or push...<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 kids, who are night & day each other... one is VERY strong willed, and extrememly sensitive and spirited and a whole lot of fun :), the other follows my lead most of the time (he was more my CC baby) but he knows what he likes and what he doesn&#39;t as well. Of course lately all he does is pretend he is a dog! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274450603"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sound to me like he&#39;s doing a sulky teen-age thing.  Keep talking to<br/>
&gt;him.  If it felt okay, I might ask hom flat-out if he thought he<br/>
&gt;should do the school thing because everyone else does.  Maybe he will<br/>
&gt;open up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It wasn&#39;t a sulky teen thing.  We&#39;ve had plenty of that.  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ll ask him <br/>
about the idea that everyone else does the school thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And here&#39;s a thought:  Maybe he feels overwhelmed with trying to<br/>
&gt;figure out what to learn.  There is so much stuff out there it&#39;s hard<br/>
&gt;to choose.  I know that for me, that overload always brings me to a<br/>
&gt;screeching halt - - when I get to the point where I have way more to<br/>
&gt;do than humanly possible, I can&#39;t get anything done.  I have to stop<br/>
&gt;and consciously set priorities and get rid of the stuff I don&#39;t really<br/>
&gt;want to do.<br/>
&gt;So, maybe if you bought him a book about what a curriculum should have<br/>
&gt;(the What your x grader needs to know series, I don&#39;t like the grade<br/>
&gt;level thing, but they are concise for this purpose) and he could work<br/>
&gt;through it at his leisure?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the past I&#39;ve printed out the BC curriculum learning outcomes for him to <br/>
look at.  I think they&#39;re quite overwhelming for him.  (They&#39;re <br/>
overwhelming for *me*!)  But you&#39;re probably right about his not knowing <br/>
where to start.  That&#39;s probably why he grabbed onto the reading idea.  In <br/>
a day or two I&#39;ll ask if he&#39;s found a book he&#39;d like to read or whether he <br/>
wants my help in picking something.  If he still dithers, I&#39;m going to drop <br/>
it for now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Here another thought:  Buy him some computer software,  there are high<br/>
&gt;school programs that have english, math, science etc.  If he likes the<br/>
&gt;computer, that might be a better way for him to learn anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He has yet to enjoy any of the &quot;educational&quot; software he&#39;s had access to.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Also,<br/>
&gt;look into cool software like, Zap and Dr. Sulphur for science.  Way<br/>
&gt;cool stuff!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve actually got Dr. Sulphur, but I was never able to get it to work.  It <br/>
was passed on by a friend whose kid grew out of it.  Maybe I&#39;ll have <br/>
another go at it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;But most of all, keep him talking to you.  Ask him lots of questions,<br/>
&gt;tell him what you are doing, talk about the weather, but don&#39;t let him<br/>
&gt;shut you or the world out.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks.  I need this reminder from time to time.  (It&#39;s hard to keep <br/>
talking to a brick wall, and that&#39;s just what it feels like sometimes.)<br/>

her long braid hanging out of her toque, as usual, and told me to pull her <br/>
braid.  I didn&#39;t really notice the impish grin on her face at the time.  I <br/>
pulled the braid, and it came out in my hand.  Then she pulled off the <br/>
toque, and I could see that her hair was 1&#92;4 inch all over.  I&#39;m glad she <br/>
never had it that short again, but she&#39;s also never let it get long and <br/>
beautiful again either.<br/>
