<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Have any of you noticed that if your children were in ps and now you<br/>
&gt; homeschool, that they are healthier now?  Mine used to catch every<br/>
&gt; cold or virus that came along in ps. I have h/s for 2 years now and<br/>
&gt; they have been healthy since then.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there&#39;s more to this issue than just the virus thing, although it&#39;s<br/>
definitely part of it.  I think that unschoolers get enough rest, because<br/>
they don&#39;t always have to get up in the morning.  They also, given the<br/>
chance, eat what their body is telling them it wants, when the body wants<br/>
it.  Physically, those things improve your resistance to viruses.  And<br/>
finally, the extraordinary drop in stress when leaving the ps system helps<br/>
greatly, too.<br/>
<br/>
I think this might also explain why my friend&#39;s son, who is homeschooled but<br/>
very strictly controlled both academically and physically, is often sick<br/>
despite the reduced acess to other children.  (This is the friend that my<br/>
son doesn&#39;t understand very well -- he&#39;s allowed to have candy on Friday<br/>
nights.  Is candy from the devil, too?  I missed that one in the Bible.)<br/>

I guess a lot of it does depend on the child. My oldest does and has always <br/>
gone to school. Our attitude with her at home is like it is with the other 3 <br/>
who have never gone to school. She very rarely gets sick, and she also works <br/>
around people at her job. In fact, my younger kids get sick more often than <br/>
my oldest.<br/>
