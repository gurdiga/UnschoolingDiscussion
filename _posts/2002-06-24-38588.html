<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009082076">We don&#39;t  sort colors anymore -- we use a product called a dye magnet. <br/>
 Just throw it in the washing machine with the dirty clothes and the dye <br/>
magnet magically prevents any colors that are running from sticking to <br/>
other clothes.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dyemagnet.com/">http://www.dyemagnet.com/</a><br/>

My son recently expressed an interest in learning home economics.  He&#39;s <br/>
already mastered cleaning -- he can sweep and mop a large <br/>
kitchen/breakfast room floor pretty well.  We&#39;re all enjoying that he&#39;s <br/>
really enjoying learning how to cook.  He&#39;s actually very good and isn&#39;t <br/>
afraid to try complicated recipes that require an array of skills -- a <br/>
recipe for fisherman&#39;s pie required sauteeing, chopping, pureeing, <br/>
making a pastry crust, making a white sauce.  He&#39;s learned to make an <br/>
awesome stir fry vegetables with rice, fetucinni carbonara, veggie <br/>
lasagna.  He&#39;s had to create the menus and shop for the food.  I&#39;ve only <br/>
had to run interferrence with a fish monger who questioned why this 12 <br/>
year old boy was asking for a pound each of whitefish and shrimp.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; it. There<br/>
&gt; just isn&#39;t that much to it that would have to be taught by someone who is<br/>
&gt; more expert, is there? There might be -- I might not know it (and <br/>
&gt; Sandra and<br/>
&gt; many others here have seen my house so I should say that I do know HOW to<br/>
&gt; clean a lot better than what it looks like - I really just don&#39;t like <br/>
&gt; to take<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t separate colors and whites - I separate new colors from <br/>
&gt; everything<br/>
&gt; until they&#39;ve been washed a few times so they won&#39;t bleed. After that - I<br/>
&gt; wash everything together unless it seems to be something particularly<br/>
&gt; delicate because I noticed there was a &quot;delicate&quot; setting on the washing<br/>
&gt; machine and figured that was what it was for. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
