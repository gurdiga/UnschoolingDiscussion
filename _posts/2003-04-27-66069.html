&gt; Our 3 yr. old has one she loves it. She was totally in awe when Nicholas was <br/>
&gt; born and its kind cool cuz the belly is magnetic and I had a section. Too <br/>
&gt; bad she doesn&#39;t look like I did after he was born, she is instantly skinny <br/>
&gt; again. Eleven months later and going from 200 pounds to 140 I still have a <br/>
&gt; pouch that will not go away. Barbie how did u do that? LOL<br/>
