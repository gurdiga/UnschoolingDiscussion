Not unschooling, since it&#39;s such a curriculum, but there&#39;s some info about <br/>
doing it at home.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like to read that site for crafts inspiration, but when you get to <br/>
the discussions of Legos and such, it seems like they are spending so <br/>
much energy worrying about what&#39;s good vs. bad that I get tense just <br/>
reading!<br/>

People weigh in for and against Legos, but the controlling attitude <br/>
really jumps out at you.<br/>

<br/>
Hey but aren&#39;t Lego manufactured in Denmark or some mondo-Germanic place?<br/>
Sheesh....  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that proves it&#39;s more New-Age correctness than dusty old Aryan <br/>
mysticism. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A quote from that Lego article:<br/>
-=-For me Lego has mainly straight forms and edges no curves and mixed forms <br/>
as found in nature. It seem that this is the main problem with it. As in a <br/>
computer you can only do what the soft ware and hard ware have already dictated <br/>
to the user.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like it was written by someone who doesn&#39;t use a computer much, or who <br/>
doesn&#39;t write or do any computer art.  <br/>
<br/>
But then it was found on a website, taken from a discussion list of some <br/>
sort, where it was probably written.   <br/>
<br/>
(I wonder what she&#39;s thinking computers would/should do if they weren&#39;t <br/>
limited by software or hardware?  They couldn&#39;t chop wood, or fly.)<br/>
