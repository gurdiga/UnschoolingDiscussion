&gt; chemical warfare in the colonies when negotiating a treaty with <br/>
&gt; tribes near the Potomac River, headed by Chiskiack.  The British <br/>
&gt; offered a toast &quot;symbolizing eternal friendship,&quot; whereupon the <br/>
&gt; chief, his family, advisors, and two hundred followers dropped dead <br/>
&gt; of poison. Besides, the early Virginians engaged in bickering, sloth, <br/>
&gt; even cannibalism. They spent their early days digging random holes in <br/>
&gt; the ground, haplessly looking for gold instead of planting crops. <br/>
&gt; Soon they were starving and digging up putrid Indian corpses to eat <br/>
&gt; or renting themselves out to Indian families as servants - hardly the <br/>
&gt; heroic founders that a great nation requires.&quot;<br/>

children will too as they grow older.  There is so much about American <br/>
History that I know nothing about.  Having been raising in England I think we <br/>
concentrated on everything but America.  Probably because there is so much <br/>
history in Europe and not as much here in the States.  I&#39;m always fascinated <br/>
by the things I read about the beginnings of this country with the &quot;white <br/>
people&quot; (please no one take that as a slur), because my understanding is that <br/>
America didn&#39;t need to be &quot;founded&quot;.  It was already here and belonged to the <br/>
Indians.  The &quot;white people&quot; just came in and decided they would like to have <br/>
it.  So they took it by force.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll go and read some more about the beginnings of this country.  <br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions about good books to read on that?<br/>
