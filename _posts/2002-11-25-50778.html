Everything she writes is fabulous.<br/>

Wow, the Titanic, yesterday at my favorite coffee place someone asked me<br/>
about my heritage, wondering if I had gypsy blood in me. I guess I remind<br/>
him of gypsies with the lifestyle that our family has (unschooling and<br/>
everything). Anyway, I told him that my grandparents were from Croatia. My<br/>
grandfather came over first and he kept sending my grandmother money. She<br/>
and her friends went to get on the boat, but she didn&#39;t have all the funds<br/>
she needed. Her friends got on the Titanic, my grandfather sent more money<br/>
and my grandmother took the sister ship of the Titanic which was the next<br/>
ship to come to america on.<br/>
<br/>
Just my piece of history,<br/>
