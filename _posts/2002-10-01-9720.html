&lt;&lt; My baby did not like to be confined and she wanted to see the world.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

The point is not to &quot;confine&quot; a baby.<br/>
The point is to make it easier on the Mom when the child wants to be held. <br/>
Most babies require a LOT of holding and the sling allows you to have your <br/>
hands free and breastfeed comfortably, even in public.<br/>
At the toddler stage, it holds them on the hip easier.<br/>
If they want down, no one would suggest not allowing them freedom to move <br/>
about!<br/>
