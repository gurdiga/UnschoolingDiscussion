<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731400870">We just returned from a week long family reunion with my husband&#39;s family.  They are deeply religious Pentecost....they are SURE we are going to hell.  It&#39;s really sad to see the pity in their faces for us since we haven&#39;t &quot;seen the light&quot;.  They continually try each year to save us.................<br/>
(My husband is a recovering Mormon.....a very long story....)<br/>
<br/>
BTW it was the longest week of my life!!!  It&#39;s so good to be home.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100543345"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Now I have no <br/>
&gt; reason to fear hell.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My church tells me I&#39;m not going to hell, and my school-at-home colleagues<br/>
are sure that I am.  I figure I win either way, since I&#39;ve met some pretty<br/>
facinating people here (and elsewhere) that will surely be there, too, if<br/>
the doomsayers are right.  Should be a very nice party.  (So long as there&#39;s<br/>
no dr. pepper...I agree, Mary!)<br/>
