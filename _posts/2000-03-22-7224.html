<div id="ygrps-yiv-578302731">Hi and WELCOME to the growing masses of homeschooling families!<br/>
<br/>
Take it slow and easy.  Don&#39;t place heavy-duty expectations on yourself<br/>
yet.  Just get re-acquainted with having your girls home with you and<br/>
enjoy being an intact family again.  Then, when you&#39;re ready, see what<br/>
the girls say.  What do THEY want?  What would please you as a family? <br/>
Don&#39;t fall into traps and don&#39;t feel the need to necessarily do what<br/>
everyone else is doing.  Figure out what works for you.  In reality,<br/>
that could take a year or longer to recognize.  Be spontaneous!  Cherish<br/>
every moment.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi everyone! New to the list and am seriously<br/>
&gt; considering homeschooling.  There is much more<br/>
&gt; info available than I realized!  I have three<br/>
&gt; girls and two are in school, 4th grade & kindergarten.<br/>
&gt; Until last year I felt my 9 year old was stimulated<br/>
&gt; and challenged, not anymore!  I don&#39;t think my<br/>
&gt; children are necessarily gifted but they are<br/>
&gt; certainly capable of much more than what is<br/>
&gt; currently being offered in public school.<br/>
&gt; I realize that pre-planning is the key to a<br/>
&gt; successful start in educating them at home.<br/>
&gt; I have visited many web sites and requested info<br/>
&gt; from some regarding Home school association<br/>
&gt; memberships. I have been told not to go through<br/>
&gt; my school district.  I also ordered a book titled<br/>
&gt; &quot;Homeschool Almanac&quot;<br/>
&gt; I would appreciate any suggestions or comments<br/>
&gt; from those of you who could help me make this<br/>
&gt; a smooth transition for my girls. Specifically<br/>
&gt; what I need to look for in an association,<br/>
&gt; Curriculum and other tips.  Thanks a bunch!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375731411">My only advice to you really is to read, read, read and then...read some<br/>
more! I started off wanting to be prepared too and get the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
resources, buy the &quot;right&quot; curriculum..now seven years down the track we are<br/>
unschooling and loving it!!<br/>
<br/>
However, when I was just gathering info about homeschooling this<br/>
unschooling-thing (LOL) might have seemed too scary for me. It requires such<br/>
a huge shift in our paradigms.<br/>
<br/>
Still if you read Gatto, and Holt and as many different articles as you<br/>
possibly can, you will begin to have an idea of the huge smorgasboard (sp?)<br/>
of opportunities that await you. Unschooling is life and as Auntie Mame puts<br/>
is &quot;Life is a banquet and most poor suckers are starving to death!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Academic reasons&quot;  -- when someone asks why we hs, that&#39;s what I say.  If <br/>
your kids are bright or gifted, imo, ps doesn&#39;t challenge or even offer new <br/>
material often enough to make it liveable.  At least around here!  (Martin <br/>
County, Florida).  (My kids: 6 3/4 yo son and 5 yo daughter, FYI.  So we&#39;re <br/>
pretty new to all of this too!)<br/>
<br/>
And it seems to me that&#39;s why you are headed in this direction too.<br/>
<br/>
Well, unschooling is quite different from other types of hsing.   So you will <br/>
probably want to read all about those differences.  Your library might have a <br/>
good book or 2 on the different schools of hsing.<br/>
<br/>
And, just to make your life more complicated, unschooling is done in a number <br/>
of different ways, differing from family to family.<br/>
<br/>
I think the bottom line is that you have to take some time and figure out <br/>
what works for you and yours.  Use some curriculum or not, outside lessons or <br/>
not, join a support group or not, live at the library or not, etc.  We do <br/>
some of all of the above and it is constantly changing.<br/>
<br/>
One sanity check I did at the beginning was to go online to the state&#39;s <br/>
standards (if you are in Fla I can tell you the web site, if not it&#39;s pretty <br/>
easy to find).  These are a line-by-line description of what the schools are <br/>
supposed to be teaching the kids at each age.  It was not impressive, except <br/>
in its volume.  But once I read thru what was expected at each grade level, I <br/>
KNEW we could and would do so much more.  So, that was reassuring.  And, even <br/>
if that is not your focus, and for many folks it is not, it might give you <br/>
some ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I think you have to explore and read, maybe ask your 9 yo <br/>
what she wants to do (but if she&#39;s anything like my kids it will change), <br/>
talk to everyone (you&#39;d be surprised how many of us there are out there) and <br/>
get comfortable with the whole idea yourself.<br/>
<br/>
This is a friendly list that is good for bouncing ideas off of if you run <br/>
into any questions.  So, feel free to bounce.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck with everything.<br/>

I love this quote.  Auntie Mame is my favorite unschooler!  I read that book <br/>
so many times, as a child and continuing into adulthood, that it is tattered <br/>
beyond repair.  Dontcha love it at the end when Mame wants to take Patrick&#39;s <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103397978">I too, am relatively new at unschooling.  It has helped me to ask many <br/>
questions, and to read everything I can get my hands on.  Also, because I am <br/>
a former teacher, I have to really work on relaxing, and not pushing too <br/>
much.  This is hard for me, but I am working at it, earnestly.  One thing <br/>
that I will say, is to try not to re-create school in your own home.  In my <br/>
opinion, it defeats the purpose of taking your kids out of school.  You will <br/>
not need to create a rigid schedule that cannot be deviated from, and you <br/>
will not need to have desks for your children and yourself.  You can &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
on the front porch, in the car, stretched out on the floor, etc...  Be <br/>
comfortable with each other.  If everyone is tired, do not push ; you will <br/>
have that freedom, that teachers and students do not, so take advantage of <br/>
that freedom.  Your children will benefit from it.  Also, do not think you <br/>
have to make everything into a lesson-- this can lead to burn out.  You do <br/>
not need to worry that you need to have your children doing something on task <br/>
for 6hrs a day!  Micki Colfax, author of Hard Times in Paradise, and <br/>
Homeschooling For Excellence said that  if you give your child 2 hrs a day of <br/>
one on one time, he or she will achieve in one year 3times the amount of on <br/>
task time when compared to conventionally schooled children.   You can&#39;t beat <br/>
that!     Relax, and enjoy, and congratulations on taking charge of your <br/>
children&#39;s education!                                                           <br/>

&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t think my <br/>

<br/>
The first thing I had to realize is that all children are gifted. You just <br/>
have to figure out what they are gifted at. I am not talking the gifted of <br/>
the schools but that all children, all people for that matter have strengths <br/>
and, well, gifts:) One of the best ways to do this is not tie them down with <br/>
a curriculum. It will be a big impulse for you to do this, but try to <br/>
resist..... If you are rejecting the school system, don&#39;t try to recreate it <br/>
at home. If you have taken your children out of school already I would <br/>
suggest a vacation, go to the library a lot, watch what kind of books they&#39;re <br/>
interested in, give them some time to get used to not being in school every <br/>
day. While you&#39;re at the Library, pick up the following books: The Homeschool <br/>
Reader, The Unschooling handbook, The Teenage Liberation handbook, ( Has <br/>
incredible ideas and resources on what a good education can be.)<br/>
Here are some sites you might want to check out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-793897321">Hi Jackie,<br/>
<br/>
There are many forms of playing where children do learn a lot,  <br/>
maybe your daughter is doing more &quot;learning&quot; than you think??  I <br/>
don&#39;t know you or your daughter, but I would still give the advice <br/>
[you did ask(-; ] that you not push her and that one day you will be <br/>
pleasantly surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Deprogramming, yes I believe that is what children who have been <br/>
to school need before they can be enthusiastic about anything that <br/>
looks remotely like it may be educational, I call it &quot;Deschooling&quot; <br/>
though your word is very good as school does &quot;programe&quot; children, <br/>
and it does a good job at what it aims to do... make obedient <br/>
clones who have forgotten how to think for themselves.  By taking <br/>
so many hours of our children&#39;s lives and putting them on the <br/>
school treadmill they steal so much from them.  Time is so <br/>
important, childhood does not last for very long and the mind is so <br/>
like a sponge ready to absorb all sorts of things.  School teaches <br/>
that nothing is ever so important that the bell can be ignored, no <br/>
matter how interested some children may be in a certain lesson, <br/>
the bell rings and they are meant to switch their minds off that <br/>
subject and onto another.   This programmes us well for the work-<br/>
force, do as you are told, and do it in the time frame the boss tells <br/>
you to.<br/>
<br/>
 Televison does the same thing in many ways, one half hour on this <br/>
subject, then onto another no matter how curious you may be <br/>
about what you have just seen.    The internet on the other hand <br/>
doesn&#39;t really place time limits on a child&#39;s curiosity, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
require that they sit still and &quot;watch the whole show&quot; like with <br/>
some documentary on television.  My kids prefer to have shows <br/>
taped, so they can watch them over again, rewind to rehear a <br/>
certain part of the show and be able to turn it off and return later to <br/>
see more.<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go, life is calling!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:mcmich@...">mcmich@...</a> [what&#39;s your name?],<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My advice is to just do it, take the children out of school and let <br/>
&gt; them deschool for a while, they will need it.  Then after watching <br/>
&gt; them deschooling you may find [as I did] that your children learn <br/>
&gt; lots of stuff without being taught.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This can be a difficult concept to grasp while still in the school <br/>
&gt; mindset, where we are encouraged to believe that children are <br/>
&gt; empty vessels just waiting to be filled with information, and that the <br/>
&gt; only way you can fill their heads is to force feed them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I believe that nothing could possibly be further from the truth, why <br/>
&gt; look at all an infant learns in its first few years on the planet, a <br/>
&gt; whole language, lots of complicated interactions between people, <br/>
&gt; they know so much about the world, and no-one ever sat them at a <br/>
&gt; desk and made them &quot;learn&quot;.   Real learning comes from curiosity <br/>
&gt; and needs, and schooling merely seems to limit these things.  The <br/>
&gt; flame of curiosity is all but extinguished by schools attempt to <br/>
&gt; make learning such a big deal, and when locked away from the real <br/>
&gt; world for so many hours each day children have little in the way of <br/>
&gt; needs, except maybe to escape from education.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have found that my daughter [1 1/2 years in school] and my son <br/>
&gt; [6yrs in school] have regained that natural curiosity, it took very <br/>
&gt; little time for my daughter but my son veged out and did nothing <br/>
&gt; that seemed to indicate any return of his spirit for almost a year.  <br/>
&gt; Now after over three years away from school&#39;s damaging influence <br/>
&gt; they are real learners following their interests and needs and <br/>
&gt; teaching themselves through interaction with others, real life <br/>
&gt; experiences, the internet, cd roms, books etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; UNSCHOOLING IS GREAT ! ! ! ! ! ! !  <br/>

&lt;&lt; I must say I have been very frustrated as it <br/>
 seems that she has no interest in doing anything except play!  She is a very <br/>
 creative and imaginative child;  the public school experience for her was <br/>
 like putting a bird into a cage.  I saw her spirit which I admire and envy, <br/>
 being completely stifled.  But at home she seemed so uninterested in <br/>
anything <br/>
 I would really call learning.  Even when we go to the library, she&#39;ll <br/>
 sometimes just sit there with no interest in finding a book.  I usually pick <br/>
 the books and then read them to her.  I have been thinking that the public <br/>
 school experience turned her off completely to anything that even looks like <br/>
 learning.  I have really felt that she almost needs time to be deprogrammed! <br/>
 <br/>
 Do you think this makes sense? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow does this sound like my son.  BTW, I&#39;m new to this list.  I&#39;m Yvonne, I <br/>
have 3 kids.  And in the process of  trying to learn about unschooling.  <br/>
Because regular homeschooling is not working, it works for my son about as <br/>
well as school did.<br/>
Trying to get my hubby to go for unschooling, but he won&#39;t read web sites, or <br/>
books, so having to explain it to him is a slow going process.<br/>
ANyways, thought I&#39;d pop my head up and say Hi.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
My husband was sure homeschooling was a bad idea when we started eight months <br/>
ago. He didn&#39;t tell me about his doubts until we were three months into it, <br/>
at which time the results he was seeing erased any doubts he had. Back then <br/>
we were doing a more structured school day. As of January, my 9 yod convinced <br/>
me, by way of how much she was learning during our holiday, that unschooling <br/>
was the best method for her. Dh has *major* doubts and concerns about this <br/>
style of hsing. No matter how much I explain to him, he thinks it it just <br/>
kids sitting around never doing anything. He doesn&#39;t believe kids will be <br/>
interested in doing anything that is even slightly challenging or difficult, <br/>
unless you force them.<br/>
What I have started doing, inspired by Betsy who is also on this list, is <br/>
writing down, in a daily journal,  the main topics we cover and the <br/>
activities she participates in. I even keep notes on what my 18mod does, for <br/>
sentimental value. Although I don&#39;t break things down to specific subjects, <br/>
it might be helpfu. Of course, this might not go over too well during the <br/>
deschooling period, but it&#39;s an idea for the future. Dh likes to see <br/>
quantifiable things. I am also considering a test of basic skills at some <br/>
point. It will help allay his fears and get him on board and dd has no test <br/>
anxiety.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

            Barnes and Noble is a great source for curriculums. You can get<br/>
a complete one for $40 or so. We just recently discovered five in a row. You<br/>
can check tem out at www.fiveinarow.com. We find that this works well for us<br/>
because it allows for flexability (the kids choosing what book we&#39;re going<br/>
to work on and what activity we&#39;ll do each night). It also gives us at least<br/>
one concrete thing to look at each day to give us a feeling of<br/>
accomplishment. Check it out I think you&#39;ll like it.<br/>

&gt; I have visited many web sites and requested info<br/>

&gt; memberships. I have been told not to go through<br/>
&gt; my school district.  I also ordered a book titled<br/>

&gt; from those of you who could help me make this<br/>
&gt; a smooth transition for my girls. &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi and Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
      If preplanning is the key to a successful start, a great many of us<br/>
are in trouble.   In reality I have to disagree completely. (this is not a<br/>
new trait. &lt;g&gt;)  Trying to preplan homeschooling is like trying to preplan<br/>
labor. You get this nice birth plan all written out, you get all your<br/>
assistants and care-givers on the same sheet of music. You feel that first<br/>
little twinge of impending labor and everyone gets all excited.  The first<br/>
real labor contraction hits and well..........who knew you could swear like<br/>
a sailor???  Marines blushed with the birth of my 2rd child and my goodness<br/>
I had already had one child, didn&#39;t I know what I was getting into? Birth<br/>
plans were turned into paper airplanes and sent on their way.   You can&#39;t<br/>
preplan homeschooling, because you have no real idea  of what homeschooling<br/>
will look like until you actually start.<br/>
<br/>
     Smooth transitions come by reading and thinking and talking, with<br/>
homeschoolers and with your children directly.  .  Depending on the<br/>
experiences your children have had in school, you&#39;ll need to take time to<br/>
just veg out and take a look around. Get to know each other again.  If your<br/>
children have been hurt then this transition time is a healing time.   We<br/>
need to know more about your girls to help you see what might happen at<br/>
first. All of you need to explore what you think homeschooling will be<br/>
like... what you hope it will be like.  It will take time to find your sea<br/>
legs. Don&#39;t rush.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, you&#39;ll realize that you can learn physics and environmentalism<br/>
from those paper airplanes.  ;)<br/>

You are exactly right about pre-planning.  You can pre-plan all you want, but <br/>
it&#39;s a waste of time and sometimes money.  I know that anything I bought <br/>
before we started, I ended up selling on a used curriculum board.  It is <br/>
something that you have to figure out as you go.  Just let yourself <br/>
experience it and you&#39;ll figure out you and your children&#39;s learning styles.<br/>

     This sounds so like me. I unschool my son and it&#39;s wonderful. He often <br/>
amazes me with the things he&#39;s learned seemingly &quot;all by himself&quot;. I know <br/>
this is the right path for us, but all it takes is one &quot;concerned&quot; friend or <br/>
relative to ask &quot;Aren&#39;t you going to &quot;teach&quot; him anything?&quot; or compare my <br/>
son to public school kids, and the self doubt just comes rolling in. My <br/>
advice: just roll with it , it passes. If you&#39;re truly doing what&#39;s right <br/>
for Your family, and it sounds like you are, then the doubts come and go. I <br/>
think that&#39;s probably true for all the &quot;big&quot; decisions parents make for <br/>

&gt;who are totally all for it. I love having my children home with me<br/>
&gt;all day long and enjoy being with them. I just started the<br/>

&gt;tried to keep the whole unschooling idea in the closet, hidden from<br/>
&gt;her so I wouldn&#39;t have to try to explain the idea behind it all. She<br/>
&gt;is so narrow minded on the subject and argues that the kids &quot;will<br/>
&gt;never learn beyond what I know or what&#39;s around them to know.&quot; I<br/>
&gt;tried to tell her that children will learn in any area that interests<br/>
&gt;them far beyond what I know or can tell them. That I have learned far<br/>
&gt;beyond what she or any public school has taught me. That I went on to<br/>
&gt;learn things in areas that interest me. I know I don&#39;t live my life<br/>
&gt;or raise my children to make her happy but it bothers me when I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;have her support. Does anyone know how I could handle this situation<br/>
&gt;better? I get so upset and teary eyed everytime she puts me down for<br/>
&gt;what I feel like is best for my children. Then I start wondering if<br/>
&gt;they won&#39;t learn properly. Will they learn enough by unschooling. Can<br/>

If it helps at all to know you are not alone, my relationship with my<br/>
in-laws stinks too.  They are both teachers as is my sis-in-law.  So I<br/>
can relate to the feeling of being &quot;totally nuts with our alternative<br/>
lifestyle-type&quot; decisions.  I too know the sensitive converstations<br/>
related to breastfeeding, homeschooling or vaccinations and have learned<br/>
to just not tell people what I can keep to myself.  If some people can&#39;t<br/>
handle some information then I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a (real) lie to withold<br/>
facts from them.  Like we don&#39;t always tell our kids EVERYTHING all the<br/>
time.  They&#39;re too young or immature to understand some concepts.  So<br/>
until they are ready/mature-enough they won&#39;t know everything.  If the<br/>
time comes that the in-laws have indicated their readiness for more<br/>
knowledge than we will share more with them.  It&#39;s a self-preservation<br/>
thing.  For all concerned.<br/>

&gt;     I don&#39;t really have any advice for you about your mom, but I can say I<br/>
&gt; sympathize.  I have been unschooling my daughter since September, and I have<br/>
&gt; not told anyone on my husband&#39;s side!  I am sure of the negative response I<br/>
&gt; would get and I don&#39;t want to hear it.  Luckily, they live in Fla. so it<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t too hard to hide although there have been some close calls!  It is very<br/>
&gt; hard to live a lie and I hate it.  But you have to understand that my FIL<br/>
&gt; hated that I breastfed!  He thought I was being totally selfish not allowing<br/>
&gt; anyone else to feed her!  And, when he found out that we were not vaccinating<br/>
&gt; my daughter, he told me he would kill me if anything happened to her!  He<br/>
&gt; thinks I am a total nut and often talks behind my back to other members of<br/>
&gt; the family.  So you can see why I didn&#39;t rush to tell him she&#39;s unschooled!<br/>
&gt; The only thing is, I feel like maybe now we should tell since we are sure<br/>
&gt; that she will again be home next year.  I don&#39;t know what to do- either way,<br/>
&gt; it stinks.   Jackie<br/>
