<div id="ygrps-yiv-878047888">Well, it&#39;s happened, my house actually *is* a museum. Funny that it should <br/>
have happened right as Sandra posted that &quot;House as a Museum&quot; article.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend Casey decided that she really wanted to open a museum. She had <br/>
previously wanted to open a neighborhood library, but we never could figure <br/>
out the logistics on that. We all decided that a museum could work though, <br/>
so Casey gathered up all the items she wished to include, and I donated our <br/>
guest room as the designated museum space.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all been working with her this past weekend and it&#39;s really coming <br/>
along! There is an Art Gallery, Visiting Exhibit (donated by her brother <br/>
Conor), plus permanent exhibits on Sea Life, Life in the Forest, Indian <br/>
Artifacts, and Rocks & Gems. Since we&#39;ve been collecting &quot;treasures&quot; for <br/>
years, she actually has an impressive amount of stuff. All of it is labelled <br/>
and she even included some hands-on displays for touching and exploring <br/>
under a magnifying glass.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, no museum would be complete without a gift shop. Casey put <br/>
together bead kits, snail shells from our pond and little plastic animals <br/>
and bugs for sale.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve decided that our museum will operate as a non-profit. Casey said she&#39;s <br/>
in it for the fun and opportunity to share her collections with others. <br/>
She&#39;s priced admissions to merely cover expenses-5 cents per visit or a 10 <br/>
punch pass for 25 cents. And yes, we have printed up the punch cards. We <br/>
also printed a flyer announcing the opening and distributed it in the <br/>
neighborhood yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
So, if any of you happen to be in Park City, UT and would like to visit a <br/>
fabulous museum, perhaps the only one with an 8 year old curator, please <br/>
stop by!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Too bad you don&#39;t offer virtual tours! I&#39;d really love to see your museum<br/>
but can&#39;t fathom a 2 day drive across the desert in the middle of summer<br/>
right now. Besides, the guest room is taken. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to Casey and you on her newest venture. :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well....hmmmmm...I suppose we could take photos and post them somewhere if <br/>
anyone else is interested. I&#39;ll bet Casey would enjoy writing a narrative to <br/>
go along with the virtual tour. Might be time to put up a website even. <br/>
Looks like Conor&#39;s about to get involved!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well there&#39;s a conundrum for you. Come visit our museum in the guest room, <br/>
but we have no guest room for you. :-D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ooh, we&#39;ve never read that one. We would probably enjoy it right now.<br/>
<br/>
The museum actually wasn&#39;t hard to set up at all, just time consuming in a <br/>
good way. But since it was Casey&#39;s idea she&#39;s loving every minute of it. If <br/>
you have a kid who likes collecting, sorting and labelling, then you&#39;ve got <br/>
a museum curator!<br/>
<br/>
It really has been (and Is) a fun project. We&#39;ve sorted and labelled all of <br/>
our rocks, gems, shells, coins, feathers, fossils, etc. and put them out on <br/>
some folding tables. We&#39;ve also hung up our own artwork and labelled that <br/>
too. Casey really wants people to take her seriously on this, so her dad and <br/>
I have helped with making the labels, flyers and related terminology sound <br/>
like the &quot;real&quot; museums she&#39;s visited.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Casey got her first visitors and was thrilled. So far she&#39;s sold 2 <br/>
family punchcards and 2 single admissions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll see what I can do. But you don&#39;t need me to get inspired. If you think <br/>
your kids would like to try this, then go for it! Just look at what you&#39;ve <br/>
got and what you&#39;d like to share with other people. &lt;poof&gt; You&#39;ve got a <br/>
museum in the making. :o)<br/>
