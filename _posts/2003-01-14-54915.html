 </span></blockquote>Hmmm.  Interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I think that if my life, and my son&#39;s life is happy (happy in a<br/>
healthy way), that we WILL be morally upright, kind, gentle, respectful,<br/>
humble, giving, patient, and self-controlled.<br/>
<br/>
I know that if I&#39;m feeling happy and at peace about how my life is going<br/>
along, I&#39;m more likely to do the things I&#39;m not so fond of doing.  Like,<br/>
take out the recycling and trash, scrub the bathroom, etc.  I can do things<br/>
that give of myself, and I&#39;m patient and self-controlled.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m not happy with life; when I&#39;ve struggled with depression, grief, or<br/>
whatever, I find it hard to do even the basic things I *do* enjoy, let alone<br/>
those things I don&#39;t enjoy.  I&#39;m selfish, rude, and lazy.<br/>
<br/>
So my goal is that my son grow without the wierd emotional baggage so many<br/>
people seem to have that makes them want more STUFF instead of fullfillment,<br/>
to do destructive things to be noticed, etc.  In other words, I hope that<br/>
he&#39;ll be happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I tend to think the other way around... If we are happy we tend to be<br/>
respectful and giving and loving. It&#39;s hard to be that way if we are<br/>
suffering and unhappy, because those emotions color our perception of<br/>
the world and our actions. Even criminals and such are suffering<br/>
people, not just happy and *bad*. It&#39;s the suffering that prompts them<br/>
to act violently or with no regard to others whatsoever. <br/>
