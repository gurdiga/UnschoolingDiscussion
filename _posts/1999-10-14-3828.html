Understanding and creativity a more important to me also.  Sometimes,<br/>
however,  I do ponder whether memorizing things isn&#39; t a good &quot;brain<br/>
exercise&quot;?  I realize there are many ways to develop your brain,  but it<br/>
seems memorizing something is one of them.  Those in drama do this to learn<br/>
their part.  People who learn Latin memorize a lot.  Memorizing seems to<br/>
have it&#39;s place, too.<br/>
