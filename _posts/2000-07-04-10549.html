<div id="ygrps-yiv-375706507">hello- I am new to the unschooling dotcom list. (did sign on for<br/>
a short while in the past)<br/>
I live in England. (hello Tracy)<br/>
We have 3 children. The youngest two are home educated, 7yod and<br/>
3Â½yod.<br/>
Neither have been to school. We don&#39;t follow any curriculum and<br/>
we do pretty much what takes our fancy. We have a few things that<br/>
we do on a regular basis- iceskating twice a week, twice monthly<br/>
get together with other &#39;natural nurturers&#39;<br/>
7yod attends a rainbows group (this is the precursor to brownies<br/>
in England which is in turn pre girl guides)<br/>
 Our eldest is 19yod and now at university.<br/>
looking forward to joining with you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716127831"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; but I&#39;m really struggling with the ...concept I guess<br/>
&gt; or the guilt maybe of not doing &quot;anything&quot;.  Can you tell me what you did<br/>
&gt; today?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I got up with a nasty backache of some new kind (yes, I&#39;m getting old &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
and ignored it and went and fed the guinea pigs and baby rabbits (I&#39;m<br/>
handraising one litter now that Mom doesn&#39;t want anything to do with).<br/>
<br/>
Mikey (5) was up next after me and began puttering around doing Mikey<br/>
things. There is no point in interrupting her as she does these things, as<br/>
she doesn&#39;t hesitate to show you, by answering in monosyllables (if at all)<br/>
that it IS an interruption.<br/>
<br/>
Wally (47) was up next and on the computer. Mikey eventually finished<br/>
whatever it is she was doing (to the outside eye, what she was doing looked<br/>
like staring fixedly at a dollhouse we have downstairs. To those of us who<br/>
are keen Mikey observers, we&#39;re pretty sure she was plotting the fates of<br/>
worlds.)<br/>
<br/>
I had finished playing with rabbits and guinea pigs and fixed Mikey some<br/>
breakfast. Brit (8) was up by now and playing Spyro on the Playstation.<br/>
Mikey asked for breakfast, Brit did not (Brit, like me, eschews food until<br/>
she&#39;s been up for an hour or three). I asked Mikey what she wanted and she<br/>
said, &quot;What do we have?&quot; and I recited everything I could think of and then,<br/>
as I felt she was not impressed, added, &quot;Would you like me to fix you some<br/>
nice hippopotamus?&quot; which made her laugh and say, &quot;No!&quot; and then,<br/>
thoughtfully, &quot;Besides, I don&#39;t think we *have* any hippopotamus,&quot; in a tone<br/>
of voice that tells me we may be making a trip to the Weird Meats store a<br/>
few towns away sometime. &lt;g&gt; She settled for frozen waffles.<br/>
<br/>
Then Brit and Wally and Mikey sat down at his computer to look over the<br/>
digital camera photos the girls had taken with their camera the night before<br/>
(a camera bought two Christmases ago that we all had forgotten existed and<br/>
was somehow unearthed somewhere yesterday). The photos were blurry and so<br/>
Wally and the girls all went out in the yard and practiced taking more<br/>
photos. While this was going on I was doing book orders, and left for our<br/>
storage space while they were still outside.<br/>
<br/>
When I got back, they were reviewing the new set on the computer and noting<br/>
where they&#39;d got them right and where some were still bad.<br/>
<br/>
And now I&#39;m reading email and maybe doing more work and Wally is researching<br/>
bulk upload systems and the girls are downstairs doing I-don&#39;t-know-what but<br/>
in awhile they&#39;ll come to check on us or we&#39;ll go to check on them.<br/>
<br/>
The next organized thing I can think of that we&#39;re doing is park day next<br/>
Tuesday, but we&#39;ll be doing a whole lot of things between now and then that<br/>
just come up or that we think of as we go through our days.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can  you tell me your definition of unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s aiding and abetting your children in living their lives and doing the<br/>
things they want to do, they find important, or they are curious about. It&#39;s<br/>
being on the lookout for things that fit in with their current interests, or<br/>
that might become an interest. It&#39;s being willing and ready to help them<br/>
with your time, money, interest, support and enthusiasm for whatever is on<br/>
their agenda for the day, the week, the year, their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Workbooks have nothing to do with anything. Workbooks are to unschooling as<br/>
gravity is to hummingbirds.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Right now my oldest just wants to read his Garfield comic books or watch TV<br/>
&gt; or listen to the radio or play on the computer or go sledding.  ANYTHING,<br/>
&gt; but &quot;school&quot;. So I thought, well maybe he&#39;s stressed by the workbooks, so we<br/>
&gt; cut some out of our day.  No change in him.  Sometimes I think he&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; taking this being home thing for granted and needs a dose of what it could<br/>
&gt; be like!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone have any tips?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes -- your child has it completely right and you have it completely wrong.<br/>
:) He knows what he wants to do -- in unschooling, it&#39;s your job to help<br/>
him. In an unschooling household you would be on eBay looking for more<br/>
Garfield comic books for him, watching TV with him and looking up cool<br/>
programs that fit in with what he already watches or is interested in,<br/>
making sure the radio occupies a place of importance and honor and that he<br/>
has ready access to it, that the computer has a comfortable chair and good<br/>
fast internet access, and that if a snowfall was predicted for Tuesday you&#39;d<br/>
clear the calendar and grab the mittens and the sleds.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome to unschooling -- if you&#39;re brave enough, it&#39;s a wonderful world to<br/>
live in.<br/>

<br/>
P.S. Since this morning&#39;s report we&#39;ve all played with the newest guinea pig<br/>
litter (one day old guinea pigs are nearly the cutest things possible in<br/>
nature, beat only by 3 week old rabbits) and the girls spent quite awhile<br/>
outside on their bikes on the back patio, my back feels a lot better, the<br/>
girls and I played a Little Bear card game and a Bazaar game very kindly<br/>
given to us by Sandra in August (it is easily one of our favorite games,<br/>
which Michael-Anne nearly always manages to win in spite of her magpie<br/>
tendency to hoard jewels &lt;g&gt;) and Mikey and Wally were clamoring for pizza<br/>
so I walked next door to the store (much as I hate living next door to a<br/>
store, there are significant advantages!) and bought some which is now<br/>
cooking. Mikey is looking through scrapbooks of baby photos of herself and<br/>
Brit is back where she started, playing Spyro on the Playstation. A very<br/>
typical day for us.</div>

<br/>
We have a place for workbooks in our unschooling. My son saw some at <br/>
the drugstore and fell in love with them. So I buy them for him when <br/>
he wants them (usually math, sometimes handwriting or other things). <br/>
Sometimes he works through them, sometimes he ignores them for months <br/>
on end. He must find them useful or he wouldn&#39;t ask me to get them <br/>
for him. He&#39;s never been to any kind of school, nor has anyone ever <br/>
asked him to sit down and do a workbook, he just chose them. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d bet even hummingbirds find gravity useful at times (like when <br/>
they want to land) :-)<br/>

And all the children sleeping over...<br/>
Seems like his hurt from all the abuse he suffered is coming out as a concern <br/>

families be healed, NOT having children come sleep with him!!<br/>
He seems tender and very confused.<br/>

evolved a specific way to overcome gravity, and the expenditure of <br/>
energy to overcome it rules how much they need to eat and drink, how <br/>
high and how far they can fly, how they land, and almost every facet <br/>

 I have to disagree. Gravity rules their entire existance. They have <br/>
 evolved a specific way to overcome gravity, and the expenditure of <br/>
 energy to overcome it rules how much they need to eat and drink, how <br/>
 high and how far they can fly, how they land, and almost every facet <br/>
 of their lives. The entire evolution of birds with their hollow bones <br/>
 and feathers is governed by gravity. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
As it governs us all.<br/>
Maybe it was a not-so-great analogy. But the hummingbird is seemingly <br/>
unaffected by gravity, although we all KNOW it affects everything on the <br/>
planet.<br/>

I hate to start by being negative, but you can&#39;t do that thing you said<br/>

unschooling.  By all means call it quits on the traditional classroom method<br/>
(the sooner the better!), but once you quit, you&#39;ve quit.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t have a beginning date in the fall like a curriculum<br/>
does.  It&#39;s what you do all day long when you quit trying to teach your kids<br/>
things.  Once you stop the curriculum, you&#39;ll probably see you kids<br/>
deschooling (deprogramming?) and eventually, you&#39;ll see learning happening<br/>
because your kids love learning agin.  Because nobody -- the school, you, a<br/>
teacher -- is telling them what to learn and what to care about when.<br/>
<br/>
Have you done some serious reading at unschooling.com?  There are lots of<br/>
great folks there who can explain this a whole heckuva lot more elequently<br/>
than I have!  I just wanted you to realize that you&#39;ll start right away!<br/>
That&#39;s exciting!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118340519">Brenda, Thank you for the &quot;wake-up&quot;. As you can tell, I too need to get through a &quot;deschooling&quot; process. I&#39;ve homeschooled for two years, while I loved it my son wasn&#39;t very enthusiastic with the process. So, I have 16yrs of deschooling to get over and I&#39;m afraid that won&#39;t happen overnight. But, I devouring scores of unschooling methods, diffinitions, and examples.<br/>
Don&#39;t yell at me, but probably our first year will be 20% teaching (from Math, Bible readers, and English text) and 80% unschooling. I need this re-training time for myself, mentally. What I&#39;m reading, thus far, about unschooling is so the way to go. While taking this over with my son, he&#39;s pump and excited. I&#39;ve asked him to ask God to reveal to him his talents and interest and write them down as He does. So far, he has written 7 very different interest. At the same time, I&#39;ve asked God to open my eyes to my son&#39;s talents and lead us as we move towards making our home a daily &quot;learning&quot; home. <br/>
<br/>
And dh, well he&#39;s totally flipping out on this unschooling. He was already not sure of homeschooling though we agreed that public school was not an option. He&#39;ll come around. We&#39;re take him to the conference and hopefully he&#39;ll find favorable information. Thank you for your comments. I do understand exactly what you are saying (even w/o eloquent words).

&gt; Bible readers, and English text) and 80% unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t yell on-line.  &lt;g&gt;  But, you can&#39;t really do that, either.<br/>
Unschooling is, well, unschooling.  If you&#39;re using a curriculum for math,<br/>
Bible and English, you&#39;re using an eclectic form of homeschooling.  That&#39;s<br/>
your choice, but you can&#39;t unschool without letting go.  Really, truly,<br/>
letting go.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling at its core is trusting your child&#39;s natural desire to learn.<br/>
Given the chance, children will not sit on the sofa and drool!  (As Sandra<br/>
cleverly pointed out at one point!)  They may veg in front of the TV a lot<br/>
for awhile, but that&#39;s deschooling stuff, and lots of folks here can tell<br/>
you how much their kids learn from TV anyway!<br/>
<br/>
If you tell your child that you trust him, but you don&#39;t trust him to learn<br/>
math, and despite your obvious faith you don&#39;t trust him to learn or care<br/>
about that, either, then what have you given him?  Half trust?  What does<br/>
that tell him about you?<br/>
<br/>
You might try giving him the freedom to start deschooling this summer with<br/>
the plan of unschooling in the fall.  Don&#39;t tell him you have any doubts.<br/>
Trust him.  Let him watch what he wants on TV, play on the computer as long<br/>
as he likes, read anything he wants, etc.  Act like this is truly going to<br/>
be his life forever.  Then come to the conference in August and think hard<br/>
about whether you really actually need to add math.  Whether your son won&#39;t<br/>
be exposed to Bible reading because you read the Bible together and go to<br/>
church. <br/>
<br/>
If you need structure, pick a morning for grocery shopping, one for a<br/>
library visit, and a once-a-week support group.  Plan to visit us here<br/>
between 7 and 8 a.m. every day.  &lt;g&gt;  Or, I loved the ideas recently of<br/>
alphabetizing your spice cabinet and cleaning your garage.  But try just<br/>
letting your son live.<br/>

interests and what they think their talents are! I LOVE <br/>
it...definitely going to put that idea in front of my kids, see if <br/>
they want to do it. Even a discussion about it over...pattern blocks! <br/>
or something, could prove to be valuable.<br/>

No you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to tell your children (by your actions) that you don&#39;t trust <br/>
them to learn math and English from their environment but you DO expect <br/>
science and history to come for fun &quot;when they&#39;re through with their work&quot; <br/>
(math, English and Bible), you&#39;re not going to be unschooling and it&#39;s not <br/>
going to work.  <br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;ll really be saying is that English and math are more important than <br/>
the other things AND that you don&#39;t think they&#39;re capable of natural learning.<br/>

oohh!! oohh!! I definitely understand what you are saying. I don&#39;t see it as, and I suspect they won&#39;t see it as &quot;not trusting&quot; them either. They (the children) trust us as parents to guide and teach them as much as we can. Sure I will make, well, I have made mistakes along the way -- and will probably make many more.<br/>
I see what you are saying regarding using textbooks to teach English/Math -- using the Bible with software and books are definitely a must. I need to see that reading as much as our son does equips him to write and speak English without any difficulties. As far as Math, he loves math, but not the textbooks -- I shall reconsider math another way (thank you). Actually, almost everything we do involves math.<br/>
