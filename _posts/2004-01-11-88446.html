&gt; recently added the feature of e-mail reminders when things are almost due,<br/>
&gt; but I still somehow let things go sometimes.  They recently had a program to<br/>
&gt; let you read-off your fines; a certain amount of reading would reduce your<br/>
&gt; debt, but I&#39;m not sure exactly how it worked.<br/>
