<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862949459">Oh good! Give me the slightest encouragement and see what happens . . <br/>
.<br/>
<br/>
       Let&#39;s call it peri-literacy then, and use it with our relatives and <br/>
schoolfolk as appropriate:<br/>
<br/>
       &quot;Yes, that&#39;s right, Mother Gertrude! We&#39;re so excited! She hasn&#39;t even <br/>
reached school age and she&#39;s already peri-literate! Well along in fact, and <br/>
all on her own! We&#39;ve done some checking, and your son, that smart rascal, has <br/>
discovered there&#39;s not one school program in the tri-state area designed <br/>
especially for her unique abilities! It&#39;s beginning to look like she&#39;ll  she&#39;ll <br/>
need private opportunities to develop her own gifts at her own pace --&quot; <br/>
<br/>
       &lt;this would be completely honest for my family and the school programs <br/>
here, well, except for the Mother Gertrude part!&gt;<br/>

&gt;   ***So I was wondering if there might be value in re-casting the <br/>

&gt;   I actually kinda like this idea!  I think I may start using it.<br/>
