<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274791444">Hi Everyone -<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d just like to introduce myself to the list.  I live in Virginia with <br/>
two boys ages 12 and 8, my DH, and our dog and cat.  Our homeschooling <br/>
journey began April 2001 when our oldest son finally convinced us that <br/>
we could do no worse by him.  Hsing was his idea -- and he even wrote a <br/>
proposal outlining the positive and negative aspects of hsing. <br/>
 Actually, his proposal didn&#39;t include any negatives, and he had <br/>
counterarguments for every negative that I raised.  My youngest son was <br/>
not interested in hsing and wanted to continue to attend public school, <br/>
and he just completed second grade.  After spending the past year <br/>
dealing with teachers who are hyper-focused on standardized tests that <br/>
he&#39;s not even supposed to worry about until the end of the 3rd grade, <br/>
he&#39;s not interested in returning to ps.<br/>
<br/>
I was attracted to unschooling from the very first.  After spending the <br/>
last 10+ years in the field of early childhood education, I&#39;ve come to <br/>
understand that children learn best when allowed to follow their own <br/>
paths and the proper role for the educator is to provide a safe, <br/>
learning rich environment, observe the children for their interests and <br/>
to provide opportunities to enrich their explorations of those <br/>
interests.  While I know in my bones that this is the best approach for <br/>
my children, I still struggle with a certain amount of ingrained <br/>
schoolishness.  Hanging with other unschoolers is a great counterbalance <br/>
for that.      <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, hello to all -- I&#39;m happy to be here!<br/>
<br/>

Welcome!  I am beginning to see you on most of my e-lists.  :)<br/>
We obviously have a lot in common.  We really have to get our kids <br/>
together sometime. <br/>

<br/>
The above paragragh you wrote describes me!!!  What area of early <br/>
childhood education have you worked?  I&#39;m a family child care <br/>
provider and mentor.  I just pulled my children (boy 9 and girl 7)out <br/>
of school a couple of months ago.  I&#39;ve seen how well unschooling <br/>
works with preschoolers and know it will be very rewarding with my <br/>
children in their &quot;school years&quot;.  Unschooling is one of those gut <br/>
feeling, know it in your heart, techniques that requires much trust.  <br/>
It&#39;s harder for me to trust a 9 year old than a 3 year old and I <br/>
think that comes from my public school upbringing.  That is my <br/>
challenge, to trust my children to know what they need.  Coming here <br/>
helps and meeting other unschoolers helps too.<br/>
<br/>
I find this message board very informative and challenging to many of <br/>
my beliefs, which I love and need.<br/>
