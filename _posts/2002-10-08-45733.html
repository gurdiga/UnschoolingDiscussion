Here is what an online aquaintance said about unschoolers in Atlanta:<br/>
<br/>
  &quot;I honestly, don&#39;t know a good way to meet just unschoolers.  I&#39;m on the <br/>
board of directors for one support group here, Lifetime Learners of Georgia.  <br/>
We&#39;re an inclusive group with a smattering of all styles.  There is one other <br/>
group called Atlanta Alternative Education Network (AAEN) that has a lot of <br/>
unschoolers also.  Tell her to check them out: <br/>
LLG - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://llg.freeyellow.com/">http://llg.freeyellow.com/</a> <br/>
AAEN - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindspring.com/~lei/aaen/">http://www.mindspring.com/~lei/aaen/</a><br/>
<br/>
It sounds like there are some unschoolers in the area....good luck!<br/>
