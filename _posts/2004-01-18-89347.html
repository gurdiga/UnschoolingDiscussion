<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079628718">I&#39;m a newbie at this, so i hope I do it right!  I have to agree with <br/>
the other response to Rachel about her child&#39;s problem with rage.  <br/>
ANY child can have a problem distinguishing play from reality, not <br/>
just &quot;special&quot; kids.  If you are concerned about violent behavior, I <br/>
think it would be wise not to instigate &quot;play&quot; fighting.  To a young <br/>
child, fighting is fighting.  <br/>
<br/>
I think most of us have experienced the cartoon phenomena.  When our <br/>
kids watch violent cartoons, they just naturally display more violent <br/>
behavior.  I think that would be multiplied exponentially when it&#39;s <br/>
the parent who      s the violent behavior.  As      s, we have <br/>
learned to distinguish the difference between what&#39;s real and what&#39;s <br/>
pretend.  A seven year old (again, ANY seven year old), really <br/>
hasn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Just try keeping his environment as calm and nurturing as possible.  <br/>
Eventually, by example, he will learn what behavior is acceptable and <br/>
what is not.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2113075882">I am hearing you all loud and clear.  Just so you know, play fighting <br/>
on our end tends to be throwing them onto the couches or bed, which <br/>
they love.  We don&#39;t come out pretending to punch or wrestle.  Ben, <br/>
on the other hand, will taunt any of us by calling us the craziest <br/>
wierdest names...anything...to get us to fight him.  When we endulge <br/>
him, we give him the upper hand. At least I do, I&#39;ll have to pay <br/>
attention more to my husband.  Unlike some of you, I grew up in a <br/>
house where we play fought and it was fun. So, go figure.  It&#39;s like <br/>
tickling.  A good friend of mine will not tickle her kids.  She was <br/>
tickled til almost torture by a weird uncle. We tickle our kids like <br/>
crazy, they love it, they call it &quot;tickle fun&quot;. But when they say <br/>
stop , we do. My friend&#39;s kids love it when I or Robert tickle them, <br/>
because they never get their mom (and as a result their dad) to do <br/>
it.  Of course, we make sure it&#39;s okay with them (parents)... they <br/>
don&#39;t care. We are also a very kissy/huggy family. We kiss/hug our <br/>
kids like crazy. Well, except for our 14 year old. He&#39;s not into it <br/>
anymore. :-(<br/>

boys. That is, if you mean cartoons like Bugs Bunny or Digimon.<br/>
<br/>
To comment on the original post, I think Rachel&#39;s son needs an outlet for <br/>
his overwhelming energy like karate or even any sport/activity that uses up <br/>
a lot of energy. I don&#39;t have the same issues as this child, but I do have <br/>
a lot of physical (nervous? restless?) energy. I use running as an escape <br/>
valve and it makes me a calmer woman :-)<br/>

I really can&#39;t agree with this!  My boys&#39; favorite games currently are<br/>
Warlords IV (on the computer),LOTR Return of the King and Soul Caliber II(on<br/>
game cube).  Their behavior is not any more violent than before, when I used<br/>
to only LET them watch PBS and play games like finding Nemo on the game cube<br/>
or Jump Start educational games on the computer.  I do agree with another<br/>
post, however that discussed the rage she felt at being not as strong or<br/>
powerful when wrestling with her boyfriend.  When I was little, my dad would<br/>
sometimes tickle all four of us kids.  We all liked it and would all wrestle<br/>
around and try to tickle him back.  Eventually, he would tickle me too hard,<br/>
or just too much, but wouldn&#39;t stop when asked.  He thought it was funny<br/>
when we would tell him to stop, and he would ignore us.  I remember getting<br/>
really angry that I wasn&#39;t strong enough to get away.  My lack of power over<br/>
the situation was infuriating!  Maybe the idea of no more play fighting is a<br/>
good one.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t agree with this at all.  It doesn&#39;t happen at our house.  I think it may make a difference in what someone calls &quot;violent behavior&quot; too.  Some people think raising your voice is bordering on violent behavior, and others may not blink an eye at their kid whacking the dog with a plastic baseball bat.  I think there are a lot of different levels of &quot;violence&quot;.  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Maybe the idea of no more play fighting is a<br/>

Gosh I hope so! What is difficult for some to get, and I&#39;m cool with <br/>
that, is that Ben doesn&#39;t get hurt like other people.  He loves to be <br/>
punched and kicked. Not really hard but harder than most.  According <br/>
to the &quot;experts&quot; this is called proprioceptive input.  He loves being <br/>
sat on, squooshed in a ball, etc... It&#39;s joint compression he <br/>
craves.  So, he loves to playfight.  I do think, that maybe some of <br/>
these folks may be onto something in the  no initiating the fights. <br/>
My husband should maybe just throw him around and pretend to not see <br/>
him on the couch and sit on him instead. Ben really is funny.  If I <br/>
flip him onto his tummy and press on the small of his back with <br/>
almost all my weight, til he&#39;s practically smooshed into the bed he <br/>
says, &quot;Uh, that feels so good!&quot;  This is that sensory stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I need to find more non inciting to violence ways of giving Ben this <br/>
input.<br/>

You&#39;re right, Lyle.  Maybe it should have said &quot;No more play fighting until<br/>
you can come up with a plan to stop when it starts to get out of hand...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me...When my oldest was 6 or 7 he would sometimes get very<br/>
angry, very suddenly, sometimes seemingly with little provocation.  I had to<br/>
stay nearby when he was playing in group situations, which were especially<br/>
hard for him, so that I could intervene if I saw him about to lose it.  We<br/>
came up with a plan that that I could say a &quot;code word&quot; whenever I saw the<br/>
signs of a meltdown and he would freeze and start taking deep breaths.  For<br/>
a week or two we practiced.  When he was playing or doing something low-key<br/>
I would say the code word and he would freeze.  Then, we started using it<br/>
when he had play dates or was playing at the park.  I still watched him, but<br/>
could do it at a distance.  It really worked.  On more than one occasion he<br/>
would be going for his brother, fists clenched, angry look, etc.  From<br/>
across the room or yard I could yell &quot;snowbee!&quot; and he would freeze and<br/>
start to breathe.  He realized that if he could stop and breathe for just a<br/>
few seconds he would be able to get a grip on himself and realize that there<br/>
were options other than fighting.<br/>

it&#39;s okay for them to hide what&#39;s causing the behavior and then lie about<br/>
knowing where it is.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the solution to that problem you&#39;re modeling for them.<br/>
<br/>
Surely you&#39;d want them to choose a more mature way of informing you that<br/>
something you were doing was bothering them, and a better way of working the<br/>
situation out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s behavior that&#39;s causing destruction or hurt to others, then it&#39;s<br/>
because they lack the skills to know what to do with internal feelings. And<br/>
that&#39;s something many adults have a hard time with! Especially if the way<br/>
parents handled it essentially told them to stuff down their feelings and<br/>
behave.<br/>
<br/>
How about talking to them? Talk about what&#39;s going on inside of them. Ask<br/>
them what they can do instead. It won&#39;t be an easy fix but it will be a<br/>
useful lifetime skill.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the future I will, they have not played it for a while so it has not been <br/>
an issue but I am sure due to my change in perception which has caused a major <br/>
change in our life  we can sit down and talk about it to work it out. <br/>
<br/>
 I have noticed that my 16yro is handling his anger a lot better since we <br/>
started talking more about things that bug him, especially the relationships <br/>
between the kids. I realized a while ago that even if I disagreed with his take on <br/>
my relationship with his siblings it was still how he perceived it. His <br/>
feeling was that I gave more attention to the 12yro, I feel I do my best to give to <br/>
both and to give what each one needs so it may not look the same. I realize I <br/>
also was falling into more of a protector role with the younger one which <br/>
always made the older one look bad. That was a bad trap with really no easy way <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
One day it hit me that we had been hitting this brick wall a while and I was <br/>
really not happy with it, I really did not want to see the older one so hurt. <br/>
I found that by just validating his feelings we were able to finally talk <br/>
about what was going on.  It never occurred to me before that what I had been <br/>
doing was telling him he shouldn&#39;t feel that way, I hate when people do that to <br/>
me. If it&#39;s the way I feel. it&#39;s the way I feel. Just by treating his feelings <br/>
with compassion I learned so much and we have grown even closer. I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s something we mean to do we just get stuck. Now I am trying to look at any <br/>
behavior in our lives where we just keep doing the same thing over and over <br/>
yet not getting good results. That is my cue that this is a behavior that does <br/>
not work for us and we need to figure out something different to try.<br/>

boys. That is, if you mean cartoons like Bugs Bunny or Digimon.<br/>

To comment on the original post, I think Rachel&#39;s son needs an outlet for <br/>
his overwhelming energy like karate or even any sport/activity that uses up <br/>
a lot of energy. I don&#39;t have the same issues as this child, but I do have <br/>
a lot of physical (nervous? restless?) energy. I use running as an escape <br/>
valve and it makes me a calmer woman :-)<br/>

<br/>
There are people who need a lot of physical activity to &quot;burn off&quot; or <br/>
else it comes out in emotional outbursts or physical aggression. My <br/>
oldest daughter is like this - she&#39;s a much calmer and more centered <br/>
person when she&#39;s getting enough exercise, but when she&#39;s not, she can <br/>
be explosively angry. ALL three kids need enough physical activity or <br/>
they get bickery (I don&#39;t think that&#39;s a word, but anybody with more <br/>
than one kid undoubtedly knows what I mean &lt;G&gt;).<br/>

&lt;&lt;We also use the signal word &quot;Done&quot; when something&#39;s gone on long enough.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
In our house, when somebody says &quot;Stop&quot; you stop.  Right then. Period.  We&#39;ve <br/>
had this rule for a long time, and it goes for guests as well as family <br/>
members.  <br/>
<br/>
My 11yo ds has a similar rule with his neighborhood friends.  He likes to <br/>
play fight, but he doesn&#39;t like to fight (many of them do.)  Now if anyone says <br/>
stop they stop.  No questions asked and no teasing anyone about being a wimp.  <br/>
It seem to work well here.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES!! I thought about that just a bit ago, they had sat there playing the <br/>
same game for hours on end, sometimes four of my sons at once would be at it <br/>
taking turns. It is an edge I&#39;ve seen erupt too many times.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny this was mentioned because I just told DH last night as we sat <br/>
freezing at the ski lodge that I thought for now snowboarding is the best thing <br/>
for our 16yro, he absolutely loves it and is teaching it this year. My 12yro <br/>
does not seem to need to go as often but I think the older one would go everyday <br/>
if I could take him. As it is I am making about 4 trips a week. I really <br/>
think he NEEDS to burn this energy or it drives him crazy. <br/>
<br/>
This is another one of those things I took the limit off of, I used to think <br/>
the drive too long to make more than once or at the most twice a week (40 <br/>
minutes each way) Now we just pick up and go even for just a few hours. (I prefer <br/>
just a few hours) He has told me how much he is improving going several times <br/>
a week and I remembered talking to parents back when the kids were little and <br/>
we lived at the local pool. They could not figure out why their kids did not <br/>
learn to swim well. I mentioned to them that coming to the pool more often <br/>
might help. They would come for &quot;lessons&quot; and leave, like the lessons alone were <br/>
the answer. My kids who swam well hated the lessons but lived at the pool.<br/>
<br/>
I think physical activity is really underrated in kids lives and I have <br/>
always thought that teen boys really needed LOTS of physical activity. Not trying <br/>
to slight teen girls, I&#39;ve just never had any. I feel so sad to think of how <br/>
kids have to sit in school all day.<br/>

I think a parent lying to a child is worse than any video game.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago someone on a homeschooling board said that when her kids wanted to <br/>
watch videos and she didn&#39;t want them to, she would unplug the TV, but then <br/>
put their video in and try to turn it on, but say &quot;Oh, I guess it&#39;s not working.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was presented as a reasonable recommendation for other parents.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling requires an honest relationship, and a close trusting <br/>
relationship between parents and children, and pretending something is lost or broken <br/>
when it isn&#39;t isn&#39;t going to help unschooling in any way.<br/>

I did too and it was great fun.  We do this with our kids now too.  :)  <br/>
When I suggested (since you  asked the list for suggestions ;&#39;) that <br/>
you NOT play fight with your son it was (based on your description) <br/>
just too much for him to handle.  It didn&#39;t sound fair to get him so <br/>
riled up that someone had to physically help him to calm himself back <br/>
down.   It didn&#39;t sound like he could handle that kind of excitement <br/>
and wasn&#39;t sure where to draw the line between playing and wailing on <br/>
you.  Just more calm and comfy for the whole family if y&#39;all didn&#39;t <br/>
play fight with him.  That&#39;s all I was suggesting.  :)<br/>
