<div id="ygrps-yiv-101143997">Perhaps she&#39;s interested in just taking the test, but not the results? <br/>
Perhaps just the experience of taking one will satisfy her curiousity.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, my favourite thing to do was have my dad make up <br/>
&quot;problems&quot; for me. They were always a variety of puzzles involving math (you <br/>
are going to the store and want to buy some candy. Lemon drops are 2c each, <br/>
bubble gum 3c each, caramels are 4c each, and chocolate drops are 5c each. <br/>
You have $2. What do you buy?), art (draw a dog using circles and triangles <br/>
instead of lines), language, etc. I would beg for problems, and he would sit <br/>
in his chair with his lap board making up the several problems (always on <br/>
white typing paper), then I would whisk off to my bedroom or other secret <br/>
work place with more typing paper to work on them. There was never any <br/>
pressure to finish them or to have a &quot;right&quot; answer, but I always tried to <br/>
finish them as quickly as possible, a race against myself sort of (of course, <br/>
I always got bogged down in imagining things, as I&#39;m sure my dad well knew <br/>
would happen). As I got older, he included increasingly difficult concepts. <br/>
He was also big on making up treasure hunts for us kids, which I also adored <br/>
(well, and still do ;^)<br/>
<br/>
These are sort of like test taking. Maybe they will do?<br/>
<br/>
My dad never believed in schools. He only believed in individuals. A shame <br/>
that my mom didn&#39;t listen to him more!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
