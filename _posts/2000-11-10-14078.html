 </span></blockquote>There are, thankfully, no federal laws that govern homeschooling.  You must<br/>
deal with the laws of the state you are moving to, unless you are moving<br/>
overseas and then DOD does have some guidelines.  Foreign Base Commanders<br/>
have a great deal of discretion, at least for Army installations.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668021310"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Doesn&#39;t the military have it&#39;s own homeschooling regulations? Maybe with<br/>
&gt; variations from base to base? They don&#39;t adhere to the regulations in the<br/>
&gt; state the base is in, do they?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gee, wouldn&#39;t that be logical.  No, the military doesn&#39;t have its own<br/>
homeschooling regs.  You fall under the laws of the state in which you live.<br/>
I assume that&#39;s because schools on post are part of the local school<br/>
systems, not a military system.<br/>
<br/>
Overseas, we have no regulations.  The USArmy Europe commander has a memo<br/>
that supposedly expired last year but that we&#39;re still supposed to follow<br/>
about a form to fill out.  And the Dept of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS)<br/>
system folks are &quot;working on&quot; homeschooler requirements, but that&#39;s only for<br/>
those of us who take anything from the schools.  Someday H$LDA will probably<br/>
convince them that we need strict regs, but in the meantime, there aren&#39;t<br/>
any.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice overseas, but a bit iritating every time you move.<br/>
