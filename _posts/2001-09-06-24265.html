<div id="ygrps-yiv-16286224">&quot;We all love, love, love The Sims. I am addicted to downloading new &quot;stuff&quot; &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OMG This game is so addicting!! My kids love it too!! I started out single with a small house then worked my way up to a family and a huge house!! Then our p/c crashed along with my hours,days ,months of playing :(.....<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t started a new life yet but think about it now and then!! I know how consumed I get and I don&#39;t think I have the time now!! LOL Its so much fun buliding your dream house!! and living in it!!<br/>
