<div id="ygrps-yiv-796015569">In Teach Your Own John Holt answers the question, &quot;How are we going to prevent parents with narrow and bigoted ideas from passing these on to their children?&quot; Holt asks first whether we have a right to try to prevent it. He then replies: &quot;One of the main differences between a free country and a police state, I always thought, was that in a free country, as long as you obeyed the law, you could believe whatever you liked. Your beliefs were none of the government&#39;s business.&quot; Holt explains that it is also not the government&#39;s business to decide which ideas are good and which are bad, and which will be taught to our children and which will not. He adds, &quot;From this it must follow that people not only have the right to believe what they want, but to pass their beliefs along to their children.&quot;<br/>

We might remind ourselves of this when our teaching methods and family discipline methods come under fire ... or before we &quot;fire&quot; on someone else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432927489">I used to avoid wearing a seatbelt... I have a<br/>
sensitive inner ear, and get carsick really easily,<br/>
and the seatbelt definitely makes it worse.  But six<br/>
months after I had my son my grandparents&#39; car was hit<br/>
by a truck, hit a young tree and was flipped over.  My<br/>
grandfather got a bruised knee.  He was wearing a<br/>
seatbelt.  My grandmother was thrown from the car and<br/>
then pinned beneath it.  She wasn&#39;t wearing a<br/>
seatbelt.<br/>
<br/>
My grandfather died of grief a year later.<br/>
<br/>
I have worn my seatbelt religiously ever since.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, I don&#39;t know that I believe that it<br/>
should be legislated that *adults* wear seatbelts.  I<br/>
think that insurance companies could perhaps refuse to<br/>
pay for injuries caused by failing to wear<br/>
seatbelts... that would certainly provide incentive to<br/>
wear them, and would also address the major problem I<br/>
can see with people who don&#39;t wear them, which is that<br/>
all our rates go up from paying for the much more<br/>
expensive injuries sustained by non belt-wearers (that<br/>
goes for wearing helmets on motorcycles as well).<br/>

&gt; I find it amazing that (around here anyway) you HAVE to wear a seat belt<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; yet some one can drive with children or anyone else in the back of a pick<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; truck. I saw this again today and just wigs me out!! STUPID!<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Enforced seat belt use was justified by the supposed savings to the<br/>
&gt; &gt;community in not having so many mangled bodies to clean up after an<br/>
&gt; &gt;accident.  The premise was that the community is paying for the<br/>
ambulance,<br/>
&gt; &gt;the police officers, the para-medics, the hospital bill, etc.  (yeah,<br/>
&gt; &gt;right!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I am still amazed that so many communities gave over such basic freedoms<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt;force protection.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Eiraul...who fastens her seat belt EVERY time, but occasionally has to<br/>
&gt; &gt;fight<br/>
&gt; &gt;the rebellion monster...you know, that little demon that says &#39;no one can<br/>
&gt; &gt;MAKE me do anything!&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It&#39;s been illegal over here for several years to not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wear a seat belt without an exemption.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how it was justified, but I think we&#39;ve all got used to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it.  It&#39;s funny, I wouldn&#39;t dream of not wearing my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seat belt, but talking on the phone or eating while I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; driving I do.  Hope there aren&#39;t any coppers reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this :-)<br/>
