  ang, who was doing well with undieting until I got on Paxil for PPD <br/>
  and i am finally getting back where i left off<br/>
  **************************<br/>

  Are you getting off of Paxil now?  I&#39;m going off.  I&#39;m on day three of the weaning.  If you want to go off and haven&#39;t yet tried, please don&#39;t cut it cold turkey.  Very horrible withdrawal symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
  You can write me off list if you wish.  My NP said the process of getting off will take 21 days.<br/>

  Hope you are doing well,<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it took me much longer than 21 days. I just got done in january of <br/>
this year, 2003. I was prescribed in nov of 2001. I was only given a <br/>
six month prescription. Do the math LOL. I had a history of PPD with <br/>
my second child, and was given a sample of Prozac. I didn&#39;t do more <br/>
than a month with that and thought I was fine. Well with number three <br/>
child, he was 3 months old, sept 11th happened, and a baby on the <br/>
message board born at the same time died of a heart problem. And the <br/>
lady in texas in the news who drowned her children. I thought there <br/>
must be more to life than being tormented and miserable for no <br/>
logical reason. I went to the doc and she said you have a choice, and <br/>
I said paxil because i saw commercials that paxil handles depression <br/>
and anxiety. I am suspectible to both. I didn&#39;t research it, and <br/>
started taking it. I went back a week later and told the doc of weird <br/>
symptoms, she dismissed them. Several months later I had my husband <br/>
and SIL over because I thought I was going crazy. I didn&#39;t take it <br/>
straight as dosed for more than a month. But every time I tried to <br/>
quit, I got horrible brain zaps and dizziness. They called my doc, <br/>
and she said oh you can&#39;t just quit, do half a pill every day for a <br/>
week and half a pill every other day for a week, and you will be <br/>
fine. NOPE! I was doing half a pill every four or five days for <br/>
months, because the withdrawals kept coming back over and over. It <br/>
was hell. Finally i read somewhere (quitpaxil.org?) that taking <br/>
prozac while withdrawing really helps, so i found my sample in the <br/>
linen closet from my second child PPD, and took it for ten days. It <br/>
did the trick. It wasn&#39;t easy, but easy enough for me to finally be <br/>
done with it. They don&#39;t call it Pax-hell for nothing. I hope you are <br/>
successful getting off of it in 21 days, if not, feel free to contact <br/>
me offlist! I didn&#39;t trust my doc enough to get more help from her, <br/>
after all i went through. <br/>
<br/>
Ironically, in light of all the myers briggs personality discussions, <br/>
another forum listed a personality quiz that I took, and it nailed me <br/>
as a type four individualist, who can be self hating and to the <br/>
extreme, suicidal. been there, done that, many times. just who i am, <br/>
i guess. i don&#39;t trust antidepressants, my husband knows my warning <br/>
signs, and we always get through it.<br/>
<br/>
ang-the resilient introvert, who loves life and would never want to <br/>
die, but when in the pit of despair, wishes she could just freeze <br/>
reality and not have to go through the torment anymore. more than i <br/>
intended to share, but there it is, maybe it will help someone or <br/>
give me insight.</div>

If Prozac seemed helpful once, why did you go on to Paxil?  Because Prozac <br/>
isn&#39;t advertising helping with anxiety?<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me a couple of things.  Anxiety can come from depression (trying to <br/>
reason with yourself when your brain&#39;s not functioning well, and freaking out).<br/>
<br/>
And I was on and off Prozac a couple of times in the past, once for less than <br/>
a year, once for just a few months.  When I was better, I slacked off.  Both <br/>
times the &quot;coming on&quot; and going off responses were the same as (pardon the <br/>
reference) the beginnings and ends of LSD.  Tingling in the surface of the arms, <br/>
and a kind of &quot;huh?&quot; in the peripheral vision.   Slight nerve and perception <br/>
twinges (brain kinda sending out feelers, getting used to change of chemical, <br/>
on either end) and not worse.<br/>
<br/>
The Paxil stories sound really frightening.  And for people who are already <br/>
feeling like death wouldn&#39;t be so bad, giving something that [unstable??] seems <br/>
scary.<br/>

<br/>
Having been a victi...er, patient...under another dastardly anti-d <br/>
(Effexor, or, as I like to call it &quot;Evil Effexor&quot; L) and having been <br/>
told by the NP who prescribed it (For weight loss!!! ) that it had no <br/>
serious side effects AND that getting it out of my system would take <br/>
7 days (and it took a month of cold turkey, and two days of complete <br/>
bed rest, due to the Brain Wobbles and Eyeball Jerks, in the first <br/>
few days)...I strongly believe that these Seratonin uptake inhibitors <br/>
(Such as paxil and effexor) were experimental when they were put on <br/>
the market. IOW, Effexor was not tested much before it was put out. I <br/>
was taking it in early 98, for about six months.<br/>
<br/>
And boy, HOWDY did they all LOVE these new handy-dandy cure-alls. The <br/>
NP who prescribed them to me dished em out like a PEZ dispenser. She <br/>
happened to have her office with an OB, and my best friend was crying <br/>
there one day after an appointment w/the OB...for some marital <br/>
difficulties... and this woman, NOT my friend&#39;s &quot;health practitioner&quot; <br/>
but just a bystander...said &quot;Maybe you should consider an anti-<br/>
depressant&quot; Because she was CRYING??? about a really stressful TIME <br/>
IN HER LIFE??? sheesh!<br/>
<br/>
When I was coming off, and could sit up and walk around a bit, I <br/>
found an online &quot;get off of effexor&quot; group, and the talk there was <br/>
all similar to this: bad side effects getting off, and health <br/>
professionals saying NOTHING about it...or saying the opposite, as in <br/>
my case...and it wasn&#39;t until years later that I had a Dr. tell <br/>
me, &quot;yes, they found out about (Side) Effexor&#39;s side effects from <br/>
PATIENT REPORTS.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
grrrr...the irresponsibility of the medical community still burns me <br/>
up, these five years later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649053961">Wow, I googled for more info on these drugs.  I have a friend who had a TERRIBLE time getting off of Paxil.  I, on the other hand, have taken Prozac for several years.  It has been a huge help to me.  <br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve been able to go &quot;cold turkey&quot; off and on for a few months without any problems at all.<br/>
<br/>
I just read though that prozac is easier to come off of than Paxil because it lasts longer in the body, (Kind of tapers itself).  THat explains a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought i&#39;d pass that tid bit along.  Maybe for those who need to come off of Paxil, they should switch to Prozac and go from there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758265489">This may be an odd question, but isn&#39;t is strange for an NP to be <br/>
prescribing all these meds?  That sounds a bit counterproductive to the <br/>

<br/>
I am searching for an NP, and it doesn&#39;t much matter in Tx because they are <br/>

  Somehow, an NP prescribing antidepressants and such sounds strange to me.<br/>

Episode, was the attitude of the NP when I decided to ditch it. (More <br/>
than anything, I was tired of being &quot;smooth&quot; all the time. No deep, <br/>
black lows, but no &quot;highs&quot; either. Just smoothness. Anyway, I made <br/>
the decision and she coached me about weaning from it and so forth, <br/>
and when I was on 1/8 dose for two weeks, I just dropped it. whew! I <br/>
hate to imagine what it could have been like, if I&#39;d quit cold turkey <br/>
on my (relatively small) full dose...<br/>
<br/>
anyway, she said &quot;7 days and it&#39;s out of your system&quot;<br/>
<br/>
14 days later, I told her I was still going through the withdrawals <br/>
pretty badly (not bed-ridden as I had been, but still dizzy and <br/>
spaced out)...and she said &quot;That&#39;s impossible. Effexor is gone from <br/>
your system in seven days. It must be the depression coming back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that AWFUL? A health-care professional, assuming that <br/>
everyone&#39;s system is going to respond the same way to a given <br/>
treatment!!! Ooooh...it still gets me irritated, years later. And <br/>
she&#39;s still in business, running a weight-loss clinic, bemoaning the <br/>
removal of Phen-fen from the market, and dishing out the anti-d&#39;s <br/>
like a circus barker.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556845247">Try the book _Natural Alternatives to Prozac_ By Michael T. Murray.  He<br/>
discusses working to change the causes of your  depression, taking good care<br/>
of yourself, and re-training your brain to be more optomistic, among other<br/>
things.  I read it a few years ago and got a few good suggestions from it.<br/>

Also, if you are old enough to be pre-menopausal (which some doctor on Oprah<br/>

<br/>
Raine replies: I got this list from Dr. Weil&#39;s website (www.drweil.com).<br/>
Nutritional Supplements and a Healthy Mind  <br/>
<br/>
The following are nutrients, botanicals and other compounds that the Polaris CustomPak Program recommends for this specific health condition. These ingredients are included in our product recommendations as part of the Vitamin Advisor Questionnaire. <br/>
<br/>
  a.. B vitamins - The B vitamins, especially folic acid and vitamin B6, help support the clearing of the stress hormones by the liver.  <br/>
<br/>
  b.. St. John&#39;s Wort - St. John&#39;s Wort is an herbal remedy that has been used in Europe as a treatment for mild depression. It should not be taken with antidepressant medications, especially SSRI&#39;s like Prozac or Celexa, anti-retroviral medications or birth control pills.  <br/>
<br/>
  c.. Fish oil - Recent preliminary studies suggest that omega-3 fatty acids found in fish oil may be helpful in helping to maintain a healthy mind.  We think that reasonable doses of fish oil supplements might be useful with mild temporary depression. Fish oil is an excellent source of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the most common fatty acid in nerve and brain tissue.  <br/>
<br/>
  d.. Folic acid - Recent studies have been confirming the link between this important B vitamin and a healthy mind. <br/>

<br/>
Meditation can help a lot, because some people have no mechanism for slowing <br/>
down their brains in their normal lives.   If you don&#39;t know how to meditate, <br/>
it might be worth learning.  Even if you don&#39;t dedicate yourself to doing it <br/>
every day, knowing what it feels like to really be still, and to breathe slowly <br/>
and deeply enough to put yourself in another state, you can do it pretty <br/>
quickly in a pinch.<br/>

have a doctor that is open to alternatives in medicine. He had me read the book <br/>
&quot;What your doctor may not tell you about menopause&quot;( don&#39;t be frightened by the <br/>
title!!)<br/>
It describes the use of natural Progesterone cream to  battle with the <br/>
symptoms many women my age feel. Perimenopause is what the book addresses, and the <br/>
progesterone cream has done wonders for me. I still have my moments(right <br/>
Maureen?) but am much better on the cream than off. <br/>
Just something that has worked for me. The book challenges the popular <br/>
Hormone Replacement Therapy methods. It questions the use of Estrogen , and <br/>
discusses all the ways progesterone affects us.<br/>

Hi, Nancy-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m mostly a lurker here, but I do have a &quot;natural&quot; remedy for depression. I&#39;m <br/>
also a strong introvert, and unfortunately also have a strong genetic <br/>
predisposition to depression- both parents have been medicated, <br/>
hospitalized for depressive episodes and &quot;nervous breakdowns&quot;, etc.- so it&#39;s <br/>
something I&#39;m keenly aware of and actively trying to avoid, myself.<br/>
<br/>
I recently decided to get in better shape by exercising. My original goals were <br/>
to increase muscle mass, improve bone density before my body ends its <br/>
estrogen production, improve my resting heart rate, and hopefully, lose some <br/>
excess weight in the process. I&#39;ve been going to the gym several times per <br/>
week for 5 months and have noticed a number of benefits that I hadn&#39;t <br/>
anticipated, one being that I have MUCH more energy than I&#39;d ever had <br/>
before I started exercising. I also sleep better at night, the brainfog is much <br/>
improved, and my libido--hey, it&#39;s back! <br/>
<br/>
I am not an athletic person. I don&#39;t enjoy physical activity. Picking up a heavy <br/>
book is about as strenuous an activity as I typically perform. And exercise is <br/>
really, really boring to me. My secret for sticking with it is that I take a portable <br/>
CD player and a pair of headphones with me. I listen to fast-paced, upbeat <br/>
music, and that keeps my mind off the drudgery. It also forces me to keep <br/>
pace with the music, which helps a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I know that it&#39;s very difficult for someone suffering from chronic depression to <br/>
get off their butt, but I truly believe that relying on pharmaceuticals will only get <br/>
you part-way out of it, if they help at all. I can&#39;t help but think that my mother&#39;s <br/>
lack of pysical activity contributed to her depression. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope this helps. <br/>
<br/>

people from your life.  If you can&#39;t eliminate them, the drastically reduce the <br/>
contact.  They may not be toxic to everyone, but they are toxic to you and <br/>
that has to be fixed first.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, it&#39;s one of those things where I KNOW what I need to do, and when I <br/>
DO it (Yoga, walk, exercise) I do feel soooo much better.  More energy means <br/>
the ability to get more done, which makes me feel better.  Plus when I weigh <br/>
less, I feel so much better about myself.  After the first of the year my husband <br/>
and I both went on diets.  I did the low-carb high protein thing at first, <br/>
then switched to just healthy and low fat, with lots of exercise.  I had lost <br/>
almost 30 pounds and was right where I wanted to be.  Ive since gained about 10 <br/>
back (why did I DO THAT!!) and I haven&#39;t done yoga in about 2 months.  <br/>
<br/>
You and others here are so right though, exercise does bring me out of that <br/>
&quot;funk.&quot;  I&#39;m like you, I hate exercising, I have to force myself to do it.  I <br/>
also never have the time.  I guess I&quot;ll have to just make the time again.  <br/>
