&gt; Dishnetwork, Gaming systems, you name it. But, hey, they don&#39;t call <br/>
&gt; it the &quot;plug in drug&quot; for nothing. Even I can see that. And there are <br/>
&gt; many, many times that I think to myself, &quot;How much exploring and <br/>
&gt; discovering, learning, creating-in and enjoyment of the world around <br/>
&gt; them would my kids be doing if I unplugged them from their Matrix?&quot; <br/>
&gt; My honest answer to myself is, &quot;a whole bunch more&quot;. I can&#39;t lie to <br/>
&gt; myself, TV can be a ridiculous time wasting, productivity sucking <br/>
&gt; sink. It can also be wonderful. For me, I am still trying to find <br/>
&gt; that balance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       Just reading along, I&#39;m finding this tone is turning me off. Maybe <br/>
because I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s meant as a question, or advice to others, or <br/>
neither? It seems like some kind of edgy challenge to everyone else, with all the <br/>
comments about &quot;honesty&quot; and not lying, and denigrating television <br/>
<br/>
       If it is a sincere search to &quot;find that balance&quot; by bringing it here, <br/>
maybe some descriptions of how your children do or don&#39;t respond to tv, what <br/>
they are or aren&#39;t missing by watching, and/or telling the list whether you <br/>
watch with them or plot to forcibly unplug them with your clandestine copy of <br/>
Gatto behind your back &lt;g&gt; would be less offensive and more useful?  JJ<br/>
