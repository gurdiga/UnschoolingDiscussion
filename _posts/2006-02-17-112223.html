<div id="ygrps-yiv-314231569">&quot;Because he was a bit<br/>
unsure of how you keep grades in unschooling and a bit skeptical that<br/>
she may not pass SAT&#39;s if she chooses to go to college some day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, but one doesn&#39;t need grades to succeed in college, if that&#39;s what<br/>
they choose. Truly.<br/>
<br/>
If he read about some older unschoolers, maybe he&#39;d feel better.<br/>
Google Laurie Chancey or Peter Kowalke for starters. Laurie is after<br/>
her masters degree right now, after being radically unschooled her<br/>
entire life.<br/>
And tell him not to feel bad about spending money on things you ended<br/>
up disliking, that&#39;s called learning. :) Kelly Lovejoy calls them<br/>
&quot;learningtakes&quot; instead of &quot;mistakes&quot;. I love that. <br/>
