<div id="ygrps-yiv-398998321">Came across some pages from journals, etc., that the Pilgrims kept (we were<br/>
doing Thanksgiving stuff) and thought this one would be of interest<br/>
considering this being a homeschooling list and the discussions about the<br/>
current state of juvenile delinquency:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;some of our menfolk have an English grammar school education and a few<br/>
men, like Elder Brewster, are college educated.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;we have neither school nor schoolmaster here, but our elders hope for a<br/>
schoolmaster soon to come from England.  We learn obedience from our<br/>
parents and if we are naughty we are told to &#39;go mend our manners or we<br/>
will get a proper thump on the britch!&#39;  It is our father who will find<br/>
himself before the village magistrate and, indeed, in the stocks if he will<br/>
not look to our behavior.  Then all the village shall pass by and stare at<br/>
him and make dreadful comment.&quot;<br/>
