<div id="ygrps-yiv-95261553">I find this whole issue appalling. I find it disgusting. I can&#39;t even <br/>
begin to explain the multitude of places that this issue breaks down at.<br/>
<br/>
I send my prayers to the people of Nevada for having to deal with this <br/>
issue now.<br/>
Especially since I don&#39;t find Nuclear energy to be of use in a world with <br/>
other options.<br/>

Nevada Picked for Nuclear Waste Site 01/10/2002 3:04 PM EST Email this <br/>
Story<br/>
<br/>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT <br/>
<br/>
WASHINGTON (AP) - Addressing the most troubling issue facing the nuclear <br/>
industry, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham on Thursday chose Yucca <br/>
Mountain in Nevada to be the nation&#39;s burial site for thousands of tons <br/>
of nuclear waste.<br/>
<br/>
Abraham concluded the site 80 miles northwest of Las Vegas was <br/>
&quot;scientifically sound and suitable&quot; as a repository for highly <br/>
radioactive used reactor fuel now kept at commercial reactors in 31 <br/>
states, a department spokesman said.<br/>
<br/>
A final administration decision will be up to President Bush, who has <br/>
championed the need for a central disposal site for the waste and is <br/>
expected to seek a federal license for the site in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The secretary made his decision on sound science,&quot; said Energy <br/>
Department spokesman Joe Davis.<br/>
<br/>
Nevada officials, who have fought the proposed dump for more than a <br/>
decade, have vowed to use every means available to keep the waste out of <br/>
the state. They argue that despite 13 years of intense scientific study <br/>
the federal government has not adequately shown that the public can be <br/>
protected from future radiation.<br/>
<br/>
Abraham, in notifying Nevada&#39;s governor of the decision, said &quot;sound <br/>
science and compelling national interests&quot; as well as growing concern <br/>
about nuclear materials since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks require <br/>
wastes to be consolidated at a central site.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are compelling national interests that require us to complete the <br/>
siting process and move forward with the development of a (waste) <br/>
repository,&quot; Abraham wrote Nevada Gov. Kenneth Guinn.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier in the day White House adviser Karl Rove telephoned Guinn, a <br/>
Republican and strong opponent of the Yucca project, to attempt to soften <br/>
the political concerns.<br/>
<br/>
But even a presidential decision is not expected to end the bitter debate <br/>
over siting of a national waste dump. The final word probably will come <br/>
from Congress.<br/>
<br/>
Under a 1982 law, which directed the government to assume responsibility <br/>
for the commercial nuclear industry&#39;s highly radioactive waste, only <br/>
Congress can override the expected Nevada veto.<br/>
<br/>
The site, which still faces a myriad of legal challenges from Nevada, is <br/>
not expected to be ready to accept waste until 2010 at the earliest. The <br/>
Nuclear Regulatory Commission also must issue a license, a process that <br/>
could take several years.<br/>
<br/>
The government has spent $6.8 billion to study the Nevada site since <br/>
1983. After reviewing three sites, Congress settled on Yucca Mountain in <br/>
1987 as the only location to be pursued.<br/>
<br/>
The Nevada site is a mountain of volcanic rock formed 13 million years <br/>
ago. For nearly two decades, scientists have worked to determine whether <br/>
its geology, volcanic history and hydrology are suitable for storing <br/>
materials that will remain dangerously radioactive for tens of thousands <br/>
of years.<br/>
<br/>
Power utilities have promoted the Yucca Mountain site as the most secure <br/>
and safest place to put the used reactor fuel now kept at reactor sites. <br/>
More than 40,000 tons of wastes already have built up at the plants with <br/>
2,000 tons added each year.<br/>
<br/>
The site, if finally approved and licensed, is expected to hold up to <br/>
77,000 tons of waste, buried in a labyrinth of bunkers 900 feet beneath <br/>
the surface.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915686172">Alrighty, what they left out of that report is that this nuclear &quot;garbage&quot;<br/>
will be transported to that site via railroad or trucks THROUGH HEAVILY<br/>
POPULATED AREAS without prior notice to the communities.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let me tell ya about some of the areas that these roads and tracks pass<br/>
through.  Let&#39;s take the Snake River Canyon for one.  Or the area here in<br/>
Northern California where the train went off the track and contaminated the<br/>
river FOR YEARS!  Or how about the train a couple of months ago that<br/>
necessitated the evacuation of a whole city.<br/>
<br/>
Or, how about all those drums they dumped in the ocean that they now know<br/>
are leaking!<br/>
<br/>
If they can develope nuclear energy, can someone tell me why they can&#39;t<br/>
develope a way to undo the process and thus get rid of the waste product?<br/>
Maybe if they had spent those billions on a constructive pro-active way to<br/>
deal with the waste materials we wouldn&#39;t have to worry about dumping it!<br/>
<br/>
OH, and what about the fact that the Frontal Lobotomy Boys want to start<br/>
(actually I hear they already have) testing nuclear bombs again.  Hmmmm, and<br/>
exactly how close to the dump site are the test sites???<br/>
<br/>
Ya know, I&#39;ve seen roadkill with more smarts that the boys in DC!<br/>
