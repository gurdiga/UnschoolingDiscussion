<div id="ygrps-yiv-771010368">I want to remind everyone that I have plenty of wonderful, professionally recorded CDs from the 2005 conference. I also have some tapes left from the 2003 and 2002 conferences (but not all are still available).<br/>
 <br/>
I know that CDs are really easy to duplicate, and I realize that many of you would chose to do that rather than pay *me* for originals! &lt;g&gt;  But please also understand that if I can&#39;t sell these, I will NOT be taping future conferences!<br/>
 <br/>
It was a very expensive endeavor for me, and I won&#39;t be able to make such a commitment in future years if these CDs aren&#39;t sold.<br/>
 <br/>
So....I&#39;m suggesting Live and Learn Conference CDs as gifts for that special someone on your list this year!<br/>
 <br/>
Ho Ho HO!<br/>

Did you record any sessions that were about the positives of <br/>
videogaming?  I think I need one to help me get over myself and my <br/>
lingering lack of enthusiasm for this particular interest of my son (and <br/>
my spouse).<br/>

You could reply to me offlist, or, you know, post the whole list here <br/>

 Kelly, do you have a quick and easy way of seeing what&#39;s available  and how <br/>
to order them?  Is it online?  Can we use Paypal?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417324659">I have none. I&#39;d suggest Pam Laricchia&#39;s (from the Peabody conf) and Dan Viltner&#39;s (from HSC). Both REALLY good!<br/>
