     Until AOL&#39;s fix is released, Conover said, Instant Messenger users <br/>
should restrict incoming messages to friends on their &quot;Buddy List.&quot;<br/>
     &quot;It will at least keep someone from attacking you at random,&quot; <br/>
Conover said, but it wouldn&#39;t help if the attack code is added to a virus <br/>
that propagates without the victim&#39;s knowledge. AOL said it has not given <br/>
its users any advice in the interim.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully by the time you read this the problem is fixed. BUT here is my <br/>
opportunity to talk about the inadequate code that comes from Microsoft <br/>
products:<br/>
<br/>
quote from article:<br/>
     The problem affects the newest as well as many earlier versions of <br/>
AOL&#39;s Instant Messenger program, which boasts more than 100 million <br/>
users. Only the Windows version is at risk; Instant Messengers for <br/>
Macintosh, Palm and other platforms are not. America Online Internet <br/>
access service customers are safe as well.<br/>
<br/>
quote from Washington Post article on the situation:<br/>
     Discovered by a loose team of international researchers called <br/>
&#39;w00w00,&#39; the hole is a &quot;buffe overflow,&quot; like the problem recently found <br/>
in Microsoft&#39;s Windows XP.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
FYI:<br/>
Servers that run the pre-unix based codec (pre Mac OSX) are very hard to <br/>
hack. Computers that run MacOS don&#39;t have those nasty virus problems that <br/>
go through email with executable code.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE mac viruses, but they are few and far between. And I haven&#39;t <br/>
seen any that go through the email system.<br/>
<br/>
IMNSHO, if you play with Microsoft full of hole matches, you&#39;ll get <br/>
burned.<br/>
<br/>
