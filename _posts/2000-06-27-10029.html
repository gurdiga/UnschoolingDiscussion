<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824176068">About 50/50.  It would be much simpler if we could simply refer to<br/>
ourselves as who and what we are (I for instance am Wiyot and 3 other<br/>
tribes) instead of the name &quot;Genocide Chris&quot; tagged on us or the newer BIA<br/>
designation of Native American.  We get just as much backlash from that<br/>
from folks of other ethnic backgrounds who get their bloomers in a twist<br/>
because they somehow think that is disparaging to them as they were born<br/>
here and think they have just as much right to be called &quot;native&quot;<br/>
Americans.  Can&#39;t win for losing &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the elders don&#39;t like the NA term because they were always Indian. <br/>
But, most don&#39;t refer to themselves as either but by the tribe they belong<br/>
to.  It is more a way to communicate with the &quot;white&quot; population who<br/>
haven&#39;t a clue as to who or what Hupa, Hopi and Hoopa refer to or that<br/>
there were over 100 seperate and distinct tribes in California alone.<br/>
<br/>
And, I gotta tell you, Twinki&#39;s are more likely to be offended than folks<br/>
who know what an Apple is, what a rez rocket is and what a 49 is.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; Hey Lynda,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a bit of a discussion in the &quot;letters to the editor&quot; page of <br/>
&gt; our local paper, seems a reporter used the term &quot;Indian&quot; when <br/>
&gt; referring to a &quot;Native American&quot; and some white woman who has <br/>
&gt; three adopted children that are &quot;Native Americans&quot;.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In your email you used the term &quot;Indian&quot; referring to your <br/>
&gt; Grandfather, who I believe is a Native American?   Do any Indians <br/>
&gt; you know take offence at that term being used?<br/>
