<div id="ygrps-yiv-238592924">It&#39;s my understanding you can just get ants from outside. They won&#39;t live<br/>
forever, though. The ones they send you don&#39;t have a queen.<br/>
<br/>
I just bought an Uncle Milton&#39;s ant farm, and threw out the coupon to get<br/>
ants, since surely I could find some. Well, I did, and they promptly left<br/>
the farm, figuring my sink was better territory. So if you find your own,<br/>
make sure they&#39;re too big to get through the airholes! Now, it looks like<br/>
I&#39;d have to order a whole restocking kit and I don&#39;t want to do that. You&#39;re<br/>
supposed to find harvester ants, and mostly what we have here is fire ants;<br/>
definitely not something I want to have in the house!<br/>
<br/>
If you find a source to order them from, let me know please.<br/>

Subject: Ant Farm Question<br/>
<br/>
I have an ant farm, that I would like to set up - I would like to find our<br/>
own ants. Has anyone else done this before - and have any tips. I read that<br/>
in order for the worker ants to feel like this is a real colony there needs<br/>
to be a queen. I can find lots of ants - but have yet to find  the queen.<br/>
Any ideas - or experiece would be great!<br/>
<br/>

There&#39;s an ant cam I haven&#39;t looked at yet.<br/>
I found this (and dozens of other sites which are calling me to click) by <br/>
google.com<br/>
 <br/>
ant farm queen order<br/>
<br/>
What came up for the first site was a question about why a queen couldn&#39;t be <br/>
ordered by mail.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going back to read.</div>
