<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307634466">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The book &quot;Pollyanna&quot; was fun for the kids. It is melodramatic and very<br/>
earnest. My 7yo daughter liked it a lot when I read it to her, although it<br/>
had its share of places that made *me* cringe inside.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you know that there is a sequel? &quot;Pollyanna Grows Up&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The author of the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series also wrote a series about an<br/>
aspiring writer named Emily -&quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;, &quot;Emily&#39;s Quest&quot; and &quot;Emily<br/>
Climbs&quot;. It has been about 15 years since I last read my mother&#39;s copies but<br/>
I remember it being similar to the Anne books in tone - perhaps with a<br/>
little more sadness woven into the stories in places.<br/>
<br/>
We are reading the Chronicles of Narnia at the moment - slowly. We are on<br/>
&quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; which seems to me to have the most odd<br/>
adventures. The last book might be a bit heavy for sensitive kids -<br/>
especially the betrayals.<br/>
<br/>
I bought the Mary Poppins series by P.L. Travers, because Jayn loves the<br/>
movie and I was interested in the original material. Mary Poppins turns out<br/>
to be an extraordinarily vain, rather mean and grouchy woman, whom the<br/>
children are always treading very warily around. Sure they do some cool<br/>
things - but she just seems awful. The kids seem quite fascinated by her -<br/>
and cowed also. I felt like she was using her magic to manipulate their<br/>
minds. How sad for the mother when in the first book (the only one I have<br/>
read so far) the son Michael screams to his Mom that Mary Poppins is the<br/>
only person he loves in the world. <br/>
<br/>
I had read part of it to Jayn before she fell asleep, then I finished it<br/>
off. The next day I asked Jayn if she wanted me to read some more, and she<br/>
told me she had put it back into her library, which I see as fairly clear<br/>
code for &quot;no&quot;. I think it is just too different from the movie for Jayn to<br/>
like it - especially the whole main plotline with the father&#39;s emotional<br/>
journey which is absent from the book.<br/>
<br/>
I remember liking the Heidi books as a child. There are three: &quot;Heidi&quot; by<br/>
Johanna Spyri, and &quot;Heidi Grows Up&quot; and &quot;Heidi&#39;s Children&quot; both by Charles<br/>
Tritten, Johanna Spyri&#39;s translator. I think they capture Heidi (and Peter<br/>
of course) as adults rather sweetly. I like the Shirley Temple version of<br/>
Heidi also, even though there are naturally some departures from the book.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My kids definitely prefer the most earnest kind of stories right now.<br/>
For TV, we have lousy reception and they watch videos/DVDs almost<br/>
exclusively. Little House on the Prairie has been a huge hit, especially<br/>
with the 3yo and 7yo.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did the new show include the scene from the book where Pa beats Laura with a<br/>
belt? Does the show include the endless misery that Laura feels all through<br/>
her childhood from constantly being compared to Mary, her lack of self<br/>
esteem and belief in her own &quot;badness&quot;? Did they show Ma&#39;s rigidity and<br/>
controlling nature - not to mention racism? What a shock I got when I read<br/>
the whole series (that I picked up from a vendor last year&#39;s Conference at a<br/>
great bargain) since it had always been touted as a &quot;wonderful&quot; example of<br/>
parenting and home schooling. Maybe *in comparison* to the standards of the<br/>
time. I consider those books to be historical documents giving interesting<br/>
information about how people lived, and the unremitting physical labor they<br/>
undertook, but as a treatise on gentle parenting (as I had been told) - no.<br/>
<br/>
The TV series from the seventies turns out to have only the most tenuous<br/>
connection to the books, and Pa (Michael Landon) in that is a lot kinder to<br/>
&quot;Half Pint&quot; when she makes mistakes.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I like the movie version of Heidi because of the scenery and buildings and <br/>
costumes.   I couldn&#39;t imagine those myself, living in northern New   Mexico.   <br/>
And when I watched it with Holly a few years ago, I was amused by how the <br/>
actor playing her grandfather (must be long ago dead) sounds so much like he was <br/>
doing an Arnold Schwartzenegger voice that it was fun for me just for that <br/>
reason. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I read the book too, as a kid, and enjoyed the descriptions of the scenes <br/>
with Peter and the goats and their lunches (bread and cheese wrapped in cloth, <br/>
mostly), but it was a lot of reading and I didn&#39;t like the sadness and <br/>
confusion.   <br/>

That&#39;s the horrible mean-to-her-daughters apparently immortal witch from the<br/>
candy store - she broke off two fingers and they became barley sugar for the<br/>
babies, then sold them some ginger bread. Later Mary steals the kids&#39; gold<br/>
paper stars from the wrappers, which they had been collecting (just<br/>
appalling behavior!) in order to help Mrs. Corry and her dd&#39;s to glue them<br/>
to the sky. You know the more I think about it, the more I wonder if the<br/>
writer was tripping IYKWIM. <br/>

<br/>
My copies were some of the first books I was given that were just mine, not<br/>
my mothers. The dust covers are beautiful luminous paintings, and my<br/>
editions have some gorgeous colored frontpieces, and then line drawings<br/>
interspersed that are really sweet in that &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; kind of style. <br/>
<br/>
I think I related to the idea of living with grandparents, as I often went<br/>
to stay with mine and it was a great relief to be there.<br/>

OOOh,  OOOh-  I loved these books as a girl.  Emily has a few psychic powers <br/>
and enjoys journaling.  I was inspired to start &quot;jimmybooks&quot; of my own.  She <br/>
was my heroine back then.  I still have the books somewhere- I&#39;ll have to read <br/>
them again and see how I feel now.  I also remember a big tragedy and regret <br/>
theme, stuff I was drawn to as a melancholic, and melodramatic pre-teener.<br/>

Heidi is my favorite childhood book�and I also loved the �food� parts.  I<br/>
credit �Heidi� with my love of cookbooks, and other books with vividly<br/>
descriptive food passages.  I even admit my addiction to �culinary<br/>
 mysteries�, especially the ones with recipes included.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-816422916">I just watched the Sarah, Plain and Tall set of three DVD&#39;s from our<br/>
library.  It came in one box with 2 discs and lasted for probably 6 hours.<br/>
It took me a whole day to watch what with the interruptions.  Unfortunately<br/>
neither kid (ages 10 and 12) wanted to watch it, but I really enjoyed it.<br/>
Glenn Close is Sarah and is wonderful of course.  <br/>
<br/>
Pippi was made into a tv series and then those episodes were compiled into a<br/>
movie (probably made for tv, I can&#39;t remember).  Anyway, those DVD&#39;s just<br/>
showed up at our library too and we watched the first set of the tv series.<br/>
My son loved them!  <br/>
<br/>
Also, Astrid Lindgren wrote some other stories that are really good about<br/>
the Children of Noisy Village.  These really fit into the category of<br/>
earnest books.  Stories of children growing up in Sweden and their very<br/>
normal, everyday lives- going to school, playing on the farm, holidays.<br/>
These were also made into movies that we have on video and we all love so<br/>
much.  We watch them very frequently and they are so comforting.  There is<br/>
one that takes place in the summer and one in the fall, winter and spring.<br/>
I love the holiday scenes.  They were originally in Swedish, so are dubbed<br/>
into English, but we love them anyway.  This is the Amazon link.<br/>

 <br/>
I remember this book -- really pretty funny.  The parents were a little strange, and James Thurber makes it a sweet story.  The part that&#39;s always stayed with me was the father&#39;s theory on how to find the most efficient and time-saving way to get a job done (the father was a time-saving engineer or some such title).  His method was to ask the lazy workers, on the premise that the lazy person has already found the quickest, easiest way to get his work done so he can get back to being lazy.  The way it was presented, laziness was a virtue and finding a way to have more free time on one&#39;s hands was an enviable thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169833537">my bad -- I don&#39;t know why I was thinking Cheaper by The Dozen is by James Thurber!  It&#39;s by Frank Gailbraith. Okay, so high school was way too many years ago!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1130957493">&lt; Cheaper by the Dozen&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one of my all-time favorites!  I read it many, many times as a kid<br/>
and was pleased to see a sequel several years ago (Belles on Their Toes).<br/>
There is the original movie of the first book which was pretty good.  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t too thrilled with the movie version of the sequel and the new Cheaper<br/>
by the Dozen movie with Steve Martin (many of whose movies I do love) has<br/>
nothing to do with the book at all except for the 12 kids.   Growing up I<br/>
was really fascinated with the idea of motion study and efficiency in work<br/>
places.  I was always trying to see how I could do things more efficiently.<br/>
I also loved the descriptions about listening to language records in the<br/>
bathtub and star charts and stuff on the walls.  <br/>

I also loved _The Trumpet of the Swan_ by E.B. White.  I found the boy<br/>
(Sam) who was learning to walk as quietly as an Indian (Native<br/>
American) fascinating, and Louis the swan&#39;s adventures in a Boston<br/>
hotel gave this country girl a lot to think about.  I had never heard<br/>
of watercress sandwiches before I read this book.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is a true story. The book is by two of the kids, themselves - Frank <br/>
B. Gilbreth and Ernestine Gilbreth Carey.<br/>
<br/>
The Steve Martin movie has almost nothing to do with the book - kind of <br/>
a travesty that it even had the same title.<br/>
<br/>
The older movie with Myrna Loy is very sweet and true to the book in <br/>
story and style.<br/>
<br/>
The sequel, Belles on their Toes, is just as good as the first book and <br/>
there is also a movie version of that - also with Myrna Loy and, as a <br/>
bonus, their cook is played by Hoagie Carmichael who performs several <br/>
times in the movie.<br/>
<br/>
And, just because EVERYTHING in life is connected to musical theater <br/>
(well, it is if you live at my house), there is a Broadway musical <br/>
currently in the works based on Hoagie Charmichael&#39;s music.<br/>

I was also disappointed in the SM picture - even without the comparisons to<br/>
the originals, it was not a good movie. <br/>
<br/>
I had not known about the book, however, so that is interesting, and I might<br/>
search it out when the pile beside my pillow is not about 17 books as it is<br/>
now (not counting the books I am reading for Jayn).<br/>

School as well as  The Wind Boy on audio tapes (maybe cd too).  It&#39;s worth<br/>
looking into them if you have a kid who loves audio.  I have one who will<br/>
listen to any story, loves to read too, but she listens to audio books for<br/>
hours on a daily basis.  You might also find audio books available for the<br/>
others.  I listened to The Wheel on the School and loved it too.<br/>
<br/>
Other earnest books for older readers might be James Herriot&#39;s All Creatures<br/>
Great and Small series which is also available on video as the BBC<br/>
television series.    You just have to get used to the Scottish accents.<br/>

<br/>
Jacob Have I Loved by Katherine Paterson<br/>
<br/>
The Hundred Dresses by Eleanor Estes<br/>
<br/>
Plain Girl by Virginia Sorenson (orig. published 1955, about an Amish <br/>
girl who is forced to attend public school -- accurate references to <br/>
compulsory education issues in Pennsylvania at that time).<br/>

Shabanu: Daughter of the Wind by Suzanne Fisher Staples <br/>
<br/>
A Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L&#39;Engle<br/>
<br/>
The Golden Compass by Philip Pullman<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m seeing a pattern in my reading--strong-willed young women who <br/>
persevere and remain true to who they are, in the face of difficult <br/>
circumstances.  I think the label &#39;earnest&#39; is a good one; I don&#39;t <br/>
think any of these books are at all preachy.<br/>
