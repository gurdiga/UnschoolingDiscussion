<div id="ygrps-yiv-346114510">Here&#39;s my two cents worth on visiting Harper&#39;s Ferry and Gettysburg the same <br/>
day, I think you may find it a bit much. From HF to G-burg it is about an hour <br/>
or so drive, count it as two hours door to door.<br/>
You also mentioned going to Anteitam Battlefield, I would spend a half day at <br/>
HF then head to the battlefield in the afternoon. The field is located in a <br/>
town called Sharpsburg and they have a FANTASTIC old fashioned Ice Cream shop <br/>
there. Perfect for lunch. LOL<br/>
Then I&#39;d head up to Gettysburg and get settled for the evening. Gettysburg is <br/>
an entire day visit (at least) and starting there in the morning will help. I <br/>
would love to do those two days with you, do you have an idea of when you <br/>
will be here?<br/>
