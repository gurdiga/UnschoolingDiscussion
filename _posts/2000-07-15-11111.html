&quot;Earthlink, FBI reach agreement<br/>
Atlanta (AP)--EarthLink Inc. said Friday it has reached an agreement with<br/>
the FBI to avoid future use of an electronic surveillance device called<br/>
Carnivore that disrupted Internet access for some EarthLink customers<br/>
earlier this year.<br/>
<br/>
The Atlanta-based company, which has about 4.2 million subscribers<br/>
nationwide, said it had installed the snooping software for the FBI at a<br/>
data center in Pasadena earlier this year after it lost a decision on the<br/>
matter in federal court.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Interesting, very, very interesting.<br/>
