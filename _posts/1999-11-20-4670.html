<div id="ygrps-yiv-192726435">With art, the enjoyment tends to come in the doing, rather than the end <br/>
result. We found that large brushes were much better than delicate ones for <br/>
small hands, and pots of paint, or powder paints were better than those neat <br/>
neat little tins of water colors.  Sponges, and potatoes cut in half and <br/>
carved as stamps are fun too.  Then there&#39;s cutting and sticking with <br/>
washing-up containers, cereal packets, scraps of material, kitchen roll inner <br/>
tubes, and so on..... Use edible glue.<br/>
<br/>
My children used to paint out on the back lawn, in the garden.  We used a <br/>
picnic table and a big old easel I bought at an auction.  <br/>
<br/>
On one memorable occasion, when the cousins visited and the adults were being <br/>
kept suitably entertained indoors, all the small children had a splendid art <br/>
session - painting first some delightful abstract masterpieces, then one <br/>
another, then the patio. <br/>
<br/>
The patio never really recovered, but the lawn lived to sprout another day.<br/>

My dh and I are artists  and we have found that the process is the product. <br/>
and should be.  An exploration of materials, becoming comfortable with them <br/>
and seeing how they work, where there is no right and wrong...<br/>
  How many of us made the same yellow daffodil as the other 23 kids and were <br/>
told that ours wasn&#39;t good enough...<br/>

artist, and her teenage daughter create a painting by throwing darts at <br/>
balloons filled with paint attached to a giant piece of canvas on the wall. <br/>
The results looked really cool and it looked like LOTS of fun. Can I get that <br/>
brave? I&#39;m sure Julian would play...<br/>
