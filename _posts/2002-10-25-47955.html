&lt;&lt;  And I am mad! She said if I ever have <br/>
 another baby I need to get a pump from a reputable company, and apparently <br/>
 they are expensive. But I am just mad, so mad. Do you all see how mad I am? <br/>
 Why are formula companies making breast pumps? How fair is that? So many <br/>
 women, discouraged at the 1/2 oz. of milk produced after 15 minutes of <br/>
 pumping! So many women who just quit out of frustration!  So, if you know a <br/>
 woman who is about to have a baby, and she is going to breast-feed her baby, <br/>
 help her get a really good pump! Not one of those cheepo Walmart ones!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep, that is true.<br/>
Insane isn&#39;t it? But they are more worried about selling a product than what <br/>
is best for babies.<br/>
LLL endorses that Lansinoh products. And I had good luck with all of their <br/>
stuff, which is available at Target and Wal-Mart I believe, but don&#39;t quote <br/>
me on that. I did buy the pads at Wal-Mart, can&#39;t remember if the breast pump <br/>
was there too.<br/>
I also had a Avent pump that worked fabulously.<br/>
