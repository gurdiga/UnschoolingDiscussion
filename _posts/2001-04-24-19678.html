standards like chives, terragon and basil come in lots<br/>
of really neat varieties of flavor and scent, are<br/>
pleasurable to the eye, nose and tongue, are<br/>
versatile, and can be used to teach other things as<br/>
well, like cooking and preserving!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001373133">The GREATEST book, I just LOVE it, for kids and<br/>
gardening is Roots, Shoots, Buckets and Boots. Juli<br/>
Also, my daughter took a gardening class through 4-H.<br/>
It was well worth the small fee they charged. I doubt<br/>
the fee even covered all the supplies. They actually<br/>
got a garden plot and grew stuff. It was great! You<br/>
might want to call your 4-H people in your area and<br/>
ask about that. Juli<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-607143742">We&#39;ve had great success growing pumpkins, sunflowers, beets, chard, and<br/>
sugar snap peas (which my kids will eat bucketloads of). We bombed last year<br/>
with carrots and tomatoes which I guess are a bit finickier. What grows best<br/>
for you will of course depend on your climate and soil, so asking a local<br/>
gardener might be your best bet. Many places have a county extension office<br/>
that often has publications and gives advice. 4-H gardening clubs are<br/>
another good option,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-203502393">Hi Nancy,<br/>
We are avid gardeners, I guess we would have to be, I married a Landscape Architect!  There is nothing more satisfying than to see a rose bloom for the first time in the spring.  Or to harvest a big head of cauliflower from the veggie garden.  Buy some easy to grow seeds for your kids like green beans, zucchini, corn, radishes, carrots, marigolds and sunflowers!  Sunflowers are amazing for kids because they grow so tall!  And from such a small seed!  Just plant them and water and voila!  We made a bean tee-pee which is fun for the kids, because after the beans cover the poles, the kids can climb inside and play!  As far as learning, I would get the Sunset guide for yourself.  That is our gardening bible.  Try to get as many free catalogs as you can, they always contain good helpful info.  Subscribe to gardening magazines like Sunset.  <br/>
<br/>
To start a vegetable garden, just scrape off a piece of soil, free from weeds and grass, (30&#39; x 20&#39; is a good size to start with) in your yard that gets at least 6 hours of sun, then add some amendments like compost; purchased to start with then you can make your own from green waste and kitchen scraps (no animal products).  Work the amendments into the soil, plant your seeds according to the back of your seed packets water, weed (mulching helps), feed with fertilizer and enjoy!  If you have a problem with rabbits or dogs you will need a fence around your garden.<br/>
<br/>
My DD&#39;s love to garden and my 15 yo grows chile peppers and has quite an extensive collection of cacti and succulents!  My 11 yo loves perennials and has started her own flower garden behind the grapefruit tree complete with a fence for protection from the bunnies!  They even spend their own money on plants!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1205778292">Try your state extension office and the 4H club. Our 4H club is having a<br/>
garden contest for kids and first is having a workshop and giving free<br/>
plants. They also can give you pamphlets on gardening probably for her age<br/>
level. It is a good organization. <br/>

I loved my Sunset guide while I lived in California, but it&#39;s useless (or <br/>
nearly so) for us Midwesterners. :)  Nancy, check your library for a title <br/>
called Midwest Gardening or something similar, it&#39;s been a while since I <br/>
