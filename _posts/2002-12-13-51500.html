<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This list seems to be the place to get expert advice on this topic<br/>
&gt; lately. Rain broke two bones in her arm today, falling off a scooter<br/>
&gt; after one of her clogs came off her feet and got under a wheel. I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; there, although I arrived to pick her up a few minutes after it happened.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, Dar,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry to hear this.  Your poor daughter.  Yuck.  I have never broken<br/>
anything bigger than a finger, and I&#39;m ultra sensitive to meds, so I&#39;m<br/>
really useless on your questions.  But I hope that things get easier soon,<br/>
and quickly, too.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow I&#39;m suspicious that you don&#39;t need to say anything about the clogs.<br/>
I&#39;m sure she&#39;s painfully aware of them causing the whole problem, or will be<br/>
once she&#39;s less drugged out.<br/>
<br/>
Peace to you both,<br/>
