Hi, Christina --<br/>
<br/>
Would it cheer you up any to know that lots of people who have come to<br/>
unschooling through school-at-home at first have bought curriculums and<br/>
thrown them away?  It&#39;s common.  Even though I never bought a complete<br/>
curriculum because I&#39;ve always been an unschooler, I&#39;ve certainly bought<br/>
hundreds of dollars worth of books that my son didn&#39;t like.  Fortunately<br/>
I was able to give away the duds at my homeschool support group&#39;s park<br/>
day.  Some one was happy to get them.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I paid $70 a month for a family membership at the YMCA and<br/>
didn&#39;t go for 10 months.  For awhile I felt very guilty, but then I<br/>
decided to think of it as a charitable donation that supported a worthy<br/>
organization.  <br/>

I asked my dh if he would be willing to withdraw him after Christmas holidays and he said to go ahead and let him stay the rest of the school year. He is willing to homeschool and likes the idea of unschooling but he doesn&#39;t think we need to start right now. Over Christmas though I&#39;ll &quot;practice&quot; what I want to do when I start unschooling and I&#39;m hoping that maybe by the time school starts back he&#39;ll change his mind. <br/>

  &gt; But we will still owe for the tuition and the curriculum for the year at the <br/>
  &gt; school<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve heard people mention this alot. What do parents who change private <br/>
  schools in the middle of the year do when the first school doesn&#39;t work out? <br/>
  They pay for two schools? What if they move out of state or 60 miles away? <br/>
  Are they then expected to pey for a school they aren&#39;t sending any children <br/>
  to?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213447990">What I mean by practicing is the routine we&#39;ll follow during those days. My son will be coming to work with me for part of the morning, so he&#39;ll have to be up and dressed and ready to come with me and he&#39;ll be with me for about 2-3 hours each morning until his dad picks him up. So my plan is to have him bring some items of his own choosing to work with him and work on them as he wishes while he&#39;s with me. My mom also works with me - we&#39;re partners in a business - so that will also show her that he will be doing something and not &quot;just sitting around watching TV&quot; (her words). <br/>
<br/>
The school does give the parent the curriculum when they withdraw. I just need to have dh agree to let him stay home after the holidays. I think he&#39;s willing to do this but he wants more time to get used to it and that&#39;s why he&#39;s saying to wait. <br/>
