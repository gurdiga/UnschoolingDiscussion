&lt;&lt; ...he doesn&#39;t hit other kids or his father, just me. Gee I am soooo<br/>
 lucky that I&#39;m the one he can express his negative feelings to. This is not<br/>
 fun. I am making an big effort not to hit him (please don&#39;t slam me for<br/>
 admitting that it is an effort) and here I am getting pummeled. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Don&#39;t feel bad for your urges....the fact that you could control them is what <br/>
you should be looking at!! Pat yourself on the back.<br/>
My two y.o. has taken to hitting whenever he gets frustrated. Whomever is <br/>
closest recieves his wrath, usually me.<br/>
So far, grabbing his hands and saying &quot;I don&#39;t like being hit, use your <br/>
WORDS&quot; is working fairly well, or hugging him tightly and sympathizing.<br/>
I won&#39;t allow myself to be hurt, by anyone. But meeting anger with love is <br/>
the best difuser so far.<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
