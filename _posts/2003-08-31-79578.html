Anyway, that is what my son would call ageist.  Is that a real word? lol Alex <br/>
uses it all the time.   <br/>

There are some volunteer organizations set up for kids.  I don&#39;t know what <br/>
they do or how they do it, but it enables kids to donate their time.  <br/>
<br/>
Like this one.....<br/>

Here&#39;s from the San Francisco Zoo&#39;s web page......<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you have a sincere interest in animals and conservation, enjoy working <br/>
with people, and are enthusiastic and dependable, volunteering at the San <br/>
Francisco Zoo may be just what you&#39;re looking for. As a volunteer, you will receive <br/>
on-the-job training from staff and other volunteers in the area you choose.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Perfect example.  Doesn&#39;t say a thing about age.  *wink* <br/>
