If your messages to him are that it&#39;s his fault he&#39;s &quot;overweight&quot; you are NOT <br/>
helping. Averages and charts have to do with a range of normal and &quot;Normal&quot; <br/>
falls outside of the average (which is then CALLED normal, in mathematical <br/>
terms).<br/>
<br/>
My husband has been &quot;overweight&quot; by any chart since he was an infant.  His <br/>
mother is in her 80&#39;s and he is 46 and she STILL blames him, and me, and <br/>
maybe sometimes herself instead of EVER having just accepted in 46 years that <br/>
he&#39;s just bigger than average and that he&#39;s exactly as he should be for <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
Did ANY of her continual crap ever help one bit!???  <br/>
<br/>
Well it kept him from loving her as he might have if she had accepted him as <br/>
right instead of as wrong and flawed.<br/>
<br/>
It kept her from loving him as she might have if she hadn&#39;t seen a chart <br/>
first and then overlaid her own son on that chart and defined him as fat.<br/>
<br/>
No, it harmed them both and for life.<br/>
<br/>
If he runs because running is fun, great!  He might or might not become a <br/>
thinner human.<br/>
<br/>
If he runs to lose weight and it doesn&#39;t work, he&#39;ll just quit running, and <br/>
will resent those who press him to do so for any purpose other than that the <br/>
running is enjoyable.<br/>
<br/>
How much does he have to be harmed before you quit blaming Eminem and start <br/>
accepting him as a whole human?<br/>

Something to think about.<br/>

<br/>
Wow, I am not sure how you got this impression.  My twelve year old has an <br/>
older brother who is now tall and thin and in very good shape from being so <br/>
dedicated to cross country running.  I am sure he compares himself to him and <br/>
I point out that he is wearing the some of the same clothes his brother wore <br/>
at his age and was the same size and try to tell him he has nothing to worry <br/>
about.  He is obssessed with his weight and I keep trying to tell him he is <br/>
just fine.<br/>
I don&#39;t blame Eminem for anything.  I just wondered how far to go with the <br/>
subject matter for learning.  Is there an appropriate age for certain things? <br/>
I always had the idea there was... Comparing some of the strong sexual <br/>
content in some, not all, Eminem songs to pornography does not seem far <br/>
fetched to me.  Should I now allow him free access to that as well?  I am not <br/>
being sarcastic here.  My original question was do I draw a line and if so <br/>
where?  Maybe it is the right time for a large sexual discussion with my son <br/>
since he seems to be so unabashed in that vein.<br/>
I cannot help but worry sometimes.  I do accept my son the way he is and want <br/>
to do the best I can in raising him.  I am frightened about his buying into a <br/>
world where body is seen as object with a  subsequent loss of humanity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I agree.  However...  There is the health issue of carrying a lot<br/>
more weight than a particular body should be carrying.  This amount<br/>
varies from person to person, but in general most people have health<br/>
issues if they are 20+ pounds over their healthy body weight range.  I<br/>
view it as one of my responsibilites as a parent to model healthy eating<br/>
and exercising habits.  We are neglecting our children if we &quot;allow&quot;<br/>
them to get 100 pounds overweight by eating Ho-Hos all day long.  I am<br/>
not implying that any of you are doing this, but I do see it often.<br/>
<br/>
The mother that said her son was &quot;overweight&quot; never said how much<br/>
overweight he was.  Maybe it is just who he is, and maybe he has a real<br/>
health problem.  If the later, it would be easier for him to start<br/>
addressing a healthy lifestyle as a young man, rather than have a heart<br/>
attack at age 30!  I don&#39;t know his particulars, of course, but we can&#39;t<br/>
live in ignorance of obesity.<br/>
<br/>
I truly believe that a lot of women can be 100% healthy at size 16.  I<br/>
was one of them for a while.  However, when I got into the size 20+s, I<br/>
was NOT healthy.  My body ached and wouldn&#39;t let me do anything fun.  It<br/>
was a wake up call for me and I looked at what I was showing my children<br/>
by being unhealthy, overweight (for me), and not able to run around and<br/>
play with them.  I was not being a good role model.  I started eating<br/>
healthier (and less quantity) and exercising more and I&#39;ve lost 80ish<br/>
pounds.  I am proud of what that is showing my girls and they&#39;ve learned<br/>
a lot about nutrition along the way.  It is not good to obsess, it is<br/>
not good to be overweight, it is not good to be underweight.  This, my<br/>
girls learned while watching me take care of myself.<br/>
<br/>
Definitely be happy with who you are, but always strive to be the best<br/>
you can be (physically, emotionally, and intellectually, just to name a<br/>
few ways).  It isn&#39;t about a number on a scale or a size of jeans, it is<br/>
about the quality of life our bodies are letting us have.  For me, I<br/>
needed to get rid of excess fat in order to up my quality of life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Absolutely!  It&#39;s taken me a year to loose 55 lbs.  I have 15 more to<br/>
go to reach a (realistic) goal I&#39;ve set for myself.  I have had these<br/>
70 extra pounds on for 15 years (and six kids!).  I know everyone<br/>
still loved me but I felt the physical and emotional baggage of my<br/>
excess weight.  I tried everything and stumbled (divine intervention?)<br/>
upon a Catholic spiritually weight loss program--Light Weigh.  <br/>
<br/>
I go tonight to be fitted for clogging shoes and begin clogging<br/>
classes in a few weeks.  I am so excited to be doing something that I<br/>
loved years ago and couldn&#39;t do with the weight on.  We also leave in<br/>
2 days for a week of camping/hiking in Colorado.  I am elated to know<br/>
I&#39;ll be able to handle the physical activity.  <br/>
<br/>
So, I echo Lisa&#39;s sentiments . . . For ME, I needed to get rid of<br/>
excess fat in order to up MY quality of life.<br/>
