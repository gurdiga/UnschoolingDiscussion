<br/>
&gt; WASHINGTON - The Federal Bureau of Investigation is seeking to broaden<br/>
&gt; considerably its ability to tap into Internet traffic in its quest to root<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; terrorists, going beyond even the new measures afforded in anti-terror<br/>
&gt; legislation passed by the House today, according to lawyers familiar with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; FBI&#39;s plans.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Stewart Baker, an attorney at the Washington D.C.-based Steptoe & Johnson<br/>
and a<br/>
&gt; former general consul to National Security Agency, said the FBI has plans<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; change the architecture of the Internet and route traffic through central<br/>
&gt; servers that it would be able to monitor e-mail more easily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The plans goes well beyond the Carnivore e-mail-sniffing system which<br/>
allows the<br/>
&gt; FBI to search for and extract specific e-mails off the Internet and<br/>
generated so<br/>
&gt; much controversy among privacy advocates and civil libertarians before the<br/>
Sept.<br/>
&gt; 11 terrorist attacks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;From the work I&#39;ve been doing, I&#39;ve seen the efforts the FBI has been<br/>
making<br/>
&gt; and it suggests that they are going to unveil this in the next few<br/>
months,&quot;<br/>
&gt; Baker said of the plan.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FBI Spokesman Paul Bresson said he was unaware of any development in the<br/>
e-mail<br/>
&gt; surveillance arena that would require major architectural changes in the<br/>
&gt; Internet, but acknowledged that such a plan is possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any new efforts would &quot;would be in compliance with wiretapping statutes,&quot;<br/>
&gt; Bresson said. &quot;We would be remiss if we didn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Such a move might have been unthinkable before Sept. 11.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Last year, privacy groups and civil libertarians howled in protest when<br/>
the FBI<br/>
&gt; trotted out plans to start using the Carnivore system. The Electronic<br/>
Privacy<br/>
&gt; Information Center (EPIC) in Washington was ready to go full rounds with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; government in court over Carnivore, and House Majority Leader Dick Armey,<br/>
&gt; R-Texas, asked Attorney General John Ashcroft to take another look at its<br/>
&gt; constitutionality.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now, though, the country is asking for more, not less, law enforcement on<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Internet, and even those who once complained are coming around.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I have two minds on this,&quot; says Fred Peterson, vice president of<br/>
government<br/>
&gt; affairs for the Xybernaut Corporation, which manufactures computer<br/>
technology<br/>
&gt; for military and law enforcement. The past six weeks have left little<br/>
doubt in<br/>
&gt; most peoples&#39; mind, he said, that new measures must be taken.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I think that the threat has increased and while (FBI) demands were<br/>
unreasonable<br/>
&gt; at a time when the threat was less immediate and less fatal - it&#39;s just<br/>
not the<br/>
&gt; same story anymore,&quot; he said.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Others are still skeptical, though not as much.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t think (FBI) motives are bad, but I do think they&#39;re using<br/>
people&#39;s<br/>
&gt; current state of mind - they&#39;re using it to their advantage,&quot; said Mikal<br/>
Condon,<br/>
&gt; staff attorney for EPIC.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The new FBI plans would give the agency a technical backdoor to the<br/>
networks of<br/>
&gt; Internet service providers&#39; like AOL and Earthlink and Web hosting<br/>
companies,<br/>
&gt; Baker said. It would concentrate Internet traffic in several central<br/>
locations<br/>
&gt; where e-mail and other web activity could be wiretapped.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Baker said he expects the agency will approach the Internet companies on<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; individual basis to ask for their help in the endeavor.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But Jim Harper, staff counsel for privacy advocate Privacilla.org said the<br/>
FBI<br/>
&gt; may have a hard time convincing some companies to redesign the Internet on<br/>
its<br/>
&gt; behalf. &quot;It&#39;s not really surprising, but I would be shocked to see if it<br/>
gets<br/>
&gt; done,&quot; he said. &quot;Restructuring the Internet? I don&#39;t think so.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Others say the Internet companies will not put up much of a fight.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sue Ashdown, executive director of the Washington-based American ISP<br/>
&gt; Association, an Internet company trade group, said most Internet companies<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t healthy enough financially to take on the government in court to<br/>
protect<br/>
&gt; their subscribers&#39; privacy rights. And no one, she says, wants to appear<br/>
&gt; hostile to law enforcement right now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I know there are a lot of members in the association with feelings on<br/>
both<br/>
&gt; sides,&quot; said Ashdown.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;In the current patriotic climate, enterprises of all types will likely<br/>
play<br/>
&gt; along with the FBI in order to avoid a public relations disaster,&quot; said<br/>
Gene<br/>
&gt; Riccoboni, an Internet attorney with the Stamford, Connecticut-based<br/>
&gt; Grimes & Battersby. </span></blockquote></div>

&gt; September 23, 2001<br/>
&gt; .... Mr. President, upon listening to the message<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you gave to the Congress of your country, I have been<br/>
unable to overcome a sensation of fear for what may<br/>
come of your words. You call upon your people to<br/>
prepare for &quot;a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we<br/>
have ever seen&quot; and for your soldiers to save their<br/>
honor by marching to a war in which you intend to<br/>
involve all of us, the peoples of the world. <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

not fortunate enough to share this sense of liberty<br/>
and the benefits of the civilization you wish to<br/>
defend for your people, we who never had sympathy for<br/>
terrorism since we were its victims. We, who are proud<br/>
expressions of other civilizations; who live day to<br/>
day with the hope of turning discrimination and<br/>
plunder into recognition and respect; who carry in our<br/>
souls the pain of the genocide perpetrated against our<br/>
peoples; finally, we who are fed up with providing the<br/>
dead for wars that are not ours: we cannot share the<br/>
arrogance of your infallibility nor the single road<br/>
onto which you want to push us when you declare that<br/>
&quot;Every nation in every region now has a decision to<br/>
make: Either you are with us or you are with the<br/>
terrorists.&quot;<br/>
