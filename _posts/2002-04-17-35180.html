<div id="ygrps-yiv-257739828">&quot;Is it normal to have this feeling that if the child changes at all, even one <br/>
little bit, you&#39;ll just die of sorrow, because you&#39;re so completely <br/>
infatuated with the way they are this very minute?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, yes, yes!!!<br/>
I was just staring at the wee babsy man last night and thinking that I love a <br/>
whole different human being today, than I did one year ago.<br/>
It makes us sad, but the mystery of what they will be tomorrow makes it so <br/>
interesting.<br/>
And I have thought recently that we are all like that.<br/>
Who I am today is a vastly different person than the one my dh fell in love <br/>
with.<br/>
We change our whole lives through, in every way.......so to love a person, is <br/>
to love change.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Unschooling parents typically (but apparently not always, based on things <br/>
 said here) consider it their responsibility to their children TO expose them <br/>
 to many possibilities, to make sure that their kids have as wide experience <br/>
 of the world as possible so that they have many options, especially, but not <br/>
 only, as teens. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I totally agree.<br/>
I try so hard to offer many, many options. I do urge them to try new things, <br/>
but certainly don&#39;t insist.<br/>
They have found they can trust my information now, because there is no <br/>
ulterior motivation for me, just wanting them to have fun.<br/>
Previously they would hesitate because I might make it into a &quot;lesson&quot; or <br/>
something.<br/>
But now, I can prompt and they will try something at least once.....which has <br/>
led to some great times for us.<br/>
And new learning experiences for them that they would not have been <br/>
interested in on their own.<br/>
