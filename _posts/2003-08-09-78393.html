<div id="ygrps-yiv-162301838">Hi All,<br/>
I have a dilemma.<br/>
<br/>
Brianna & I usually set up at powwows. We often leave on Friday and set up two 10X10 tents. We use heavy buffet tables, we use a heavy wooden collapsible shelf for our t-shirts. We have a sleep tent, but usually sleep in the van (conversion).<br/>
It&#39;s a physical job.<br/>
Brianna is a BIG help.<br/>
<br/>
She used to love powwows. Now - not so much.<br/>
<br/>
Each weekend, she says she doesn&#39;t want to go.<br/>
We are picking up that financial loss by wholesaling our t-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
Now, next week is a powwow - I can make real good money. There&#39;s also a HS barbecue.<br/>
<br/>
Oh- yes, Brianna has almost no friends. She&#39;s the only HS kid in the immediate area. The schooled kids are way too &quot;advanced&quot; sexually and she simply doesn&#39;t like them.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I&#39;m torn - should we go to the powwow?<br/>
Should we go to the barbecue?<br/>
This is hard....we need to make the money - I live from week to week! But I want Brianna to have friends in the HS community! Frankly, most of the HS events that happen are approx. one hour away.<br/>
There&#39;s a sign class we really wanted to take - but we&#39;d be traveling an hour to spend 30 minutes at sign - then an hour back!<br/>
I&#39;ve thought of organizing HS classes closer to us.<br/>
Anyway, any help you can give me......<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
Janis<br/>

    I take it there isn&#39;t anyone else to take her. What about organizing<br/>
game days or some other activities on a regular basis in the fall. Is there<br/>
a library close by that has a meeting room? That&#39;s what I use. Can you teach<br/>
a class on something? Park days? Bowling? I&#39;m thinking you are out of town<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596041856">We drive 40 minutes each way to the nearest biggish town about 4-5 days a<br/>
week... it&#39;s actually not that bad when it&#39;s just 4 days a week, but it<br/>
gets really wearing when we have to go like 10 days in a row. I try to<br/>
get more than one thing done when we go - Rain might have a dance  class,<br/>
then a rehearsal, then we&#39;d stop and visit some friends. If you did the<br/>
sign class, maybe you could look into other things to do, and maybe if<br/>
she started meeting some kids there you could set up visiting times after<br/>
or before the class. Lots of groups here have park days, which are free,<br/>
and there are parks and rec classes pretty cheap, and most places offer<br/>
scholarships, and there&#39;s also stuff like hanging at the bead shop or the<br/>
coffee shop or the pool...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in kind of the same boat with book sales, except they&#39;re not as<br/>
frequent and they don&#39;t last as long. Still, it&#39;s easier if Rain comes<br/>
because she can help carry books, and guard my books, and pick valuable<br/>
books herself. It&#39;s sort of a give and take, and sometimes one of us has<br/>
to miss something, and other times she spends the night with a friend who<br/>
takes her to her thing the next day. It *really* helps to have a network<br/>
of friends, from a purely logistical POV, especially as a single parent.<br/>
I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d make things work otherwise, because Rain likes to do<br/>
lots of things, and I&#39;m only one person. I am really grateful for having<br/>
them, but you do kind of have to get involved first and the friends come<br/>
later, most of the time. I do try to me available to reciprocate, too, by<br/>
driving other kids home from stuff and taking care of pets when people go<br/>
on trips, but if one was keeping track, I probably get more than I give.<br/>
Luckily no one really keeps track...<br/>
<br/>
Would there be a way to compromise on the BBQ - powwow thing? It sounds<br/>
like the BBQ is a few hours and the powwow is a whole weekend, so maybe<br/>
you could do both, and come to the powwow late or leave early or<br/>
whatever? I&#39;m not sure how far they are from each other...maybe if<br/>
Brianna comes and helps you set up, and then you drive her to the BBQ the<br/>
next day, and she stays with one of the other families until Sunday? You<br/>
said &quot;almost no&quot; friends - is there anyone she&#39;s spent time with who<br/>
she&#39;d be comfortable staying with?<br/>

There really isn&#39;t anyone that can take her. I think the best thing for me to do is to schedule events with the HS stuff as the priority. The Coyotes Corner stuff will have to get done another way - maybe more wholesale sales and fewer powwows??<br/>
<br/>

if that is possible, but that might be a good compromise if you can.  That way <br/>
she gets time with friends and you still get to make some money.<br/>

Is there a friend who could watch your booth at the powwow  while you<br/>

Could you take one of Brianna&#39;s friends to the powwow with you?   I know<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1652618845">Hi Deb,<br/>
Brain very good!!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
Part of the problem is that she&#39;s bored with powwows. There really isn&#39;t anyone that can take care of her away from the powwow - the teens we know are there!<br/>
Brianna gets $25.00 per day for working - and she does work! She takes care of customers, she straightens things out, she watches the store while I go to the port-a-potty (in our conversion van)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is deeper I think.<br/>
Recently,  I&#39;ve spent most of my time re-building the website - then my web designer lost it all. He&#39;s rebuilding it now.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve spent far too much time on the computer, in the office and on the phone.<br/>
Now, I have to schedule it so that I&#39;m working less time and spending more time with Brianna - doing big fun things.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure we can work it out.<br/>
As for the powwow, well, I simply can&#39;t afford to walk away from $1000 - 1500 dollars in sales.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been given some real good stuff to think about, so thank you.<br/>
Janis<br/>

I hate that.<br/>

Have you talked about it with Brianna and asked what her solution to the<br/>
problem would be?   Maybe together you could come up with a reasonable<br/>
compromise.   <br/>

  Have you talked with Brianna about it?  About the money etc.  It sounds like <br/>
  you are losing the interest with the powwows as well.  You have a great web <br/>
  site have you thought about expanding that at all?  I know it must be hard <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Can brianna invite a friend along? Give them almost full free time to <br/>
roan the powwow  - just help you when you really really really need it? <br/>
So that it is mostly fun, not much work? My kids would think going to a <br/>
powwow with you would be a blast - even if they had to work a bit.<br/>
<br/>
Our big powwow - Orange County California - is the same weekend as the <br/>
L&L conference so I&#39;ll miss it this year.<br/>
