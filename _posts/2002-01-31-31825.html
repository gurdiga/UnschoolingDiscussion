<div id="ygrps-yiv-526549958">Perhaps the person should be silenced in that particular thread.  Why should<br/>
the person who has asked a &quot;group&quot; a question stop asking their question<br/>
because &quot;one&quot; member of the group refuses to be flexible?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has ever done public speaking knows that you can do one of two<br/>
things, do it your way regardless of the audience and hope that at least<br/>
someone in the audience &quot;gets&quot; what you are saying OR you can gage your<br/>
approach so that it fits the immediate situation.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I have noticed that some folks &quot;do&quot; gauge their speeches to fit their<br/>
audiences, use a very &quot;inviting&quot; personna, &quot;convert&quot; or &quot;encourage&quot; lots of<br/>
folks when they are at conferences, etc. but don&#39;t use the same skills when<br/>
they are on e-mail lists.  I&#39;ve always wondered why.<br/>

&gt; &gt; If a sender continues with an in your face, shove it down your throat<br/>
style<br/>
&gt; &gt; even when the person asking a question has made it clear that isn&#39;t a<br/>
style<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they like or appreciate, then perhaps the sender needs to look a<br/>
little<br/>
&gt; &gt; closer to home to see why they feel it is necessary for them to treat<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; &gt; people asking questions to verbal abuse.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, objectively speaking, why would a receiver continue asking questions<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; someone they felt wasn&#39;t communicating in the way they felt comfortable<br/>
&gt; with? Yes, everyone can point to specific instances and say &quot;What about<br/>
&gt; this?&quot; But that&#39;s losing sight of what the true nature of the problem is.<br/>
&gt; The problem *isn&#39;t* that someone chooses to communicate in a way he has<br/>
&gt; gotten positive feed back on, but that others decide that he shouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; communicate that way because some don&#39;t like it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I sometimes find it helpful to turn a question around and use it on<br/>
&gt; something I agree with to see if it fits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone were asking the Dalai Lama questions about Buddhism and didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like his gentle, seek inside yourself answers (or whatever style he&#39;d<br/>
use),<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t the Dalai Lama entitled to feel that the method he uses to help<br/>
people<br/>
&gt; on the path to enlightenment best? If he thought some other way were<br/>
better,<br/>
&gt; then wouldn&#39;t he use it? Or, at least, he employs his skills in the way he<br/>
&gt; feels he&#39;s best at. If a fair number of people wanted a more direct (or<br/>
&gt; whatever) style, does he have an obligation to change to meet their needs?<br/>
&gt; Should he compromise the method he feels is best in order to meet the<br/>
needs<br/>
&gt; of more people or compromise meeting more people&#39;s needs so he can meet<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; needs of those who seek the style he feels he&#39;s best at?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe that&#39;s hard to see. It&#39;s hard to get past the idea that someone<br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t be irritating other people. If someone were *only* irritating<br/>
&gt; people, then people certainly have a right to speak up. If someone is<br/>
&gt; speaking in a way that *some* find irritating and *some* find helpful --<br/>
&gt; *not* helpful because they enjoy being irritated but because they find<br/>
&gt; something in the style illuminating -- then the problem *isn&#39;t* how to<br/>
&gt; silence that person so no one gets irritated, but to create an environment<br/>
&gt; where that style *and* other styles can co-exist so that those who come<br/>
here<br/>
&gt; can have a *choice*.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps all it will take is an email reminder posted to the list that<br/>
&gt; different people have different styles of communicating, or some such<br/>
&gt; wording.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Perhaps the person should be silenced in that particular thread.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And if you grant *a segment* of the population the right to silence someone<br/>
for reasons you agree with then you grant *a segment* of the population the<br/>
right to silence someone for reasons you *disagree* with. What if a vocal<br/>
group of fundamentalists decides Harry Potter and Halloween shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
discussed here since some fundamentalists left because of such discussions?<br/>
(Or pick some other subject that might bother some people that you feel<br/>
strongly in favor of.)<br/>
<br/>
If everyone agreed (or no one disagreed) that something should be a certain<br/>
way, then it should be changed to be that way. But I think the length and<br/>
number of people involved in this particular discussion makes it pretty<br/>
clear that not everyone does agree.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about the option of *knowing* that a segment of the population that<br/>
*won&#39;t* be reached another way *is* getting it?<br/>
<br/>
I think the 2nd choice is valuable to someone whose goals are to reach as<br/>
many people as possible. What if that isn&#39;t someone&#39;s goal? What if they&#39;re<br/>
goal is to reach the type of people that are best helped by their method?<br/>
<br/>
Why should there be just one goal for everyone who speaks in public?<br/>
<br/>
But I think a suggestion should be added to the &quot;potential email reminders&quot;<br/>
that people should feel free to delete the posts of anyone whose style<br/>
annoys them.<br/>
