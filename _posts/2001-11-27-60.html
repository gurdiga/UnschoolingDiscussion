<br>We expected Marty to be in the hospital a time or two in his youth. &nbsp;&nbsp;He was a brave baby. &nbsp;But he&#39;s a cautious and skillful older kid. &nbsp;He stepped on a nail and got a tetanus shot. &nbsp;In all his skating (roller blade and icerink) and bike and skateboard stuff, he&#39;s never been hurt. He gives good advice to other kids too. &nbsp;So because he&#39;s not reckless, I&#39;m not worried.
<br>
<br>When I learned to drive I didn&#39;t even know how to start the car, an automatic, the first day of driving. &nbsp;My three car-mates had already driven some with their parents. &nbsp;I was clue-free and not great at spatial reasoning, and I&#39;ve never had worse than dents in the driveway and fenderbenders. &nbsp;I would have done better with some Nintendo practice in my own youth. &nbsp;Bummer not even Pong was invented yet.

 </span></blockquote>Ah yes. And to carry that thought a little further - it also implies that it <br/>
only MATTERS if you know something for a moment - there is no point to <br/>
deeper, richer learning --- and that there is no point to &quot;wallowing in it&quot; <br/>
-- much less any point to just enjoying it.  This results in parents asking, <br/>
with concern, about their kids wanting to read books that are too &quot;low&quot; for <br/>
them. Or always reading one kind of book - &quot;He just won&#39;t read fiction,&quot; for <br/>
example.<br/>
<br/>
Ah - and it ties back in with those obsessive qualities and how parents worry <br/>
about that in their kids --- we&#39;re TRAINED, most of us, to value learning <br/>
that is a mile wide and an inch deep and doesn&#39;t &quot;stick&quot; anyway. So it looks <br/>
weird and like, at best, a waste of time, for kids to want to stick with one <br/>
thing too much. We have many years of &quot;school schedules,&quot; too, that we&#39;ve <br/>
incorporated into our beings. So we might feel discomfort when our kids don&#39;t <br/>
do a little of everything on a regular basis - a little reading, a little <br/>
science, a little math, a little history, and so on. I know that it <br/>
encouraged me to keep a journal when we first started homeschooling - because <br/>
I observed the kids and noted what they did (on their own) that was related <br/>
to all these different subject areas. It comforted me. Nowadays, I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
care -- it wouldn&#39;t comfort me because it doesn&#39;t make me uncomfortable <br/>
anymore if I don&#39;t see them learning stuff in different subject areas. But <br/>
what Betsy said brought that back to me -- how relieved I was to see that <br/>
they did stuff that could count as history, science, math, etc., even when I <br/>
didn&#39;t plan it for them. And it was a good exercise for me to do - to start <br/>
to stretch my way of looking at what &quot;counted.&quot;<br/>
