forward these on, but it sounds like a serious potential problem :-(<br/>

(from the cnet.com website)A Trojan horse that uses ActiveX is lurking on the Internet. Trojan horse<br/>
Offensive, so named because it makes offensive <br/>
references within the Windows<br/>
registry, could arrive via e-mail as a link to a Web page ending in .html.<br/>
When opened, the Web page will display a button that says &quot;Start.&quot; If<br/>
pressed, Offensive will severely damage your Windows operating system: no<br/>
icons will be visible on the desktop, no programs will execute, you will not<br/>
be able to shut down Windows, and you will not be able to work around these<br/>
effects in the Safe Mode either. According to Symantec, if you have been<br/>
affected by Offensive, you should contact a computer <br/>
professional. Because<br/>
Offensive is not yet widely reported but may cause <br/>
serious damage, it<br/>
currently ranks as a 5 on the CNET Virus Meter.<br/>
