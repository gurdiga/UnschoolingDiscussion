all, but simply asking her to defend her position, or statement that it is ok <br/>
to use physical force on children to achieve desired results. If it is ok to <br/>
hit or slap children to change their behaviour, then it must be ok to hit her, <br/>
or other adults to change the adult&#39;s behaviour.Any other answer would indicate <br/>
a belief that children are less worthy of respect than adults. <br/>
As for the link between unschooling and non-spanking philosophies, I <br/>
personally believe that if people are choosing to follow the  unschooling way of life, <br/>
listening to your children and nurturing them fully, that to also spank and <br/>
think it is ok is a contradiction in beleifs. I am sure that people who are <br/>
less tired than I am and are far more articulate will address this question more <br/>
thoroughly for you. This is the answer of one list member.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       I&#39;ll go you one better than that. I think even schooling is <br/>
incompatible with spanking, much less UNschooling.<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;m new here, an unschooling mom of nearly 15 years, and a public <br/>
school professional for many years before that.  I was a public school policy <br/>
expert during the 80s, when schools in the South began to seriously debate whether <br/>
paddling by school deans and principals should continue. (It hasn&#39;t)<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;ve studied the history and politics of it, heard the claims and <br/>
defenses, read the research, made some mistakes, and finally lived my own <br/>
conclusions. I&#39;ve come to see the same root problem with schooling, corporal <br/>
punishment, censorship,  political correctness, factory sweatshops, apartheid, and <br/>
fundamentalism, namely the belief that behavior attitudes and performance must be <br/>
compelled. <br/>
<br/>
       (How someone can justify any form of compulsion or repression with a <br/>
&quot;free will&quot; argument is completely beyond me!) <br/>
<br/>
     Schools, prisons, represssive regimes, mental treatment institutions, <br/>
religious cults -- and to Tracey, yes, even animal experts -- have demonstrated <br/>
through horrible experience that no amount of punishment, however brutal, can <br/>
create love, learning, enlightenment, civility, or abundant life. <br/>
<br/>
       Therefore, the &quot;intolerable social behavior&quot; that concerns me is <br/>
following this failed path by responsible adults, not anything done by anyone&#39;s <br/>
small children.<br/>
<br/>
       Spanking adults to correct this unacceptable and harmful social <br/>
behavior of theirs is not the answer &lt;eg&gt;. Taking the time to explain kindly and <br/>
rationally at that &quot;teachable moment&quot; (exhausting as it is) seems to be working <br/>
pretty well, and adult attitudes are improving. This method works even better <br/>
with impressionable children btw!  JJ<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not sure about that --- here is something recent from a website on <br/>
corporal punishment in schools &lt;www.corpun.com&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the United States, the school CP picture is rather confusing. One <br/>
district, Northampton County in North Carolina, is reintroducing the <br/>
paddle, though only in the elementary grades. More remarkably, corporal <br/>
punishment returns to Tecumseh, Oklahoma, after over a decade of <br/>
non-use there. The new rules will provide for a maximum of two swats <br/>
per student per day, and only with parental consent. At the same time <br/>
CP has been entirely abolished in Galveston, Texas and, after much <br/>
debate, in Mobile, Alabama. But Dallas, Texas, having considered <br/>
abolition, has now decided against it. Instead paddling will stay, but <br/>
only on parental request - an opt-in rather than opt-out system. <br/>
Elsewhere in Texas, City View High in Wichita Falls meanwhile prides <br/>
itself on its pro-spanking policy, with a principal who keeps his <br/>
paddle on display on his desk. A few parents who disagree with the <br/>
policy, which even includes swats for such things as shirts not tucked <br/>
in, have taken umbrage and moved away. A picture shows the unrepentant <br/>
paddling principal with some of his obese 10th-grade students. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Looking through the website I came across the minutes of a school board <br/>
meeting in Lee County, Florida in which they were debating (in 2000) a <br/>
proposal to eliminate corporal punishment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-898751703">&lt;&lt;Bottom line, though, is that hitting is hurtful. It hurts a child<br/>
physically. It hurts a child psychically. It hurts a relationship. To negate<br/>
those bad effects takes a lot of relationship building.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for correcting my language (I see that is a particular <br/>
compulsion for you).... Yes, I intended to use the word anathema. Corporal meaning <br/>
having to do with the body. Did I say spanking? Or physical restraint? But, oh, <br/>
yes, I do believe in spanking. Yes, judiciously applied-but that will also be <br/>
refuted here since none among you (except perhaps those already under <br/>
moderation) can consider judicious application of physical corrections. I also <br/>
believe in capital punishment and hope Lacy Peterson&#39;s husband makes the lights go <br/>
out in California.<br/>
<br/>
There are several who consider judicious application to be &#39;creepy&#39; was that <br/>
the phrase used? But, conversely then, they must think that hitting is okay <br/>
when enraged because....why again? (said in one post). Raging and loss of <br/>
control is acceptable because it wasn&#39;t premeditated (the animal equivalent to <br/>
uncontrolled anger in humans). Really?<br/>
<br/>
I would rather apply a thought out punishment for unacceptable behavior than <br/>
be given to flights of animal rage (yes, rage is an animal emotion which is <br/>
usually called uncontrolled anger by humans). Yes, it has worked quite well for <br/>
me. Its called knowing what punishment is to be applied for a given action in <br/>
advance and making that application under those circumstances only. While you <br/>
may not find it acceptable. I call it thinking rather than reacting.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the compelling arguments against what many of you have called <br/>
spanking seem well considered, though mixed into discussions containing veiled <br/>
personal attacks which makes remaining on topic challenging. My beliefs are simple. <br/>
If a my child disregards rules that have been developed for the protection and <br/>
safety of that child, or where the property of others is concerned, then that <br/>
child is given an escalating form of punishment. Physical punishment is <br/>
applied rarely but applied when deemed necessary *to me*. You don&#39;t agree that <br/>
there is any case where a child could escalate to a point where a physical <br/>
reprimand is in order and I don&#39;t agree. You (meaning those on the list vociferously <br/>
opposed to &#39;spanking&#39;) don&#39;t see where any behavior on the part of a child <br/>
could warrant a physical reprimand. So, we don&#39;t agree. You believe that it will <br/>
lead to long term injury, psychic damage. We don&#39;t agree.<br/>
<br/>
You (again meaning the listers who have responded) don&#39;t seem to understand <br/>
that as adults we have hopefully already been trained and don&#39;t need physical <br/>
reminders ever-well unless you want to get into the aspects of socially deviant <br/>
behavior (i.e., habitual criminals, etc.), which I doubt. Children IMO aren&#39;t <br/>
mini adults. There long term consequential thinking isn&#39;t developed until <br/>
there late teens and more typically early twenties. So application of cause and <br/>
effect is far more functional until that time when the frontal lobes of the <br/>
brain &#39;close&#39; making long term consequential thinking concrete. Some actions <br/>
aren&#39;t open for debate. Period. <br/>
<br/>
I have been called in obtuse language a variety of rather colorfully <br/>
descriptive and rather unpleasant things. Many of these directed simply because of the <br/>
verbiage I choose. How sad that you must make personal, though cloaked, <br/>
attacks in order to support your self righteousness. English isn&#39;t as standardized <br/>
as you might think. <br/>
<br/>
Animal nature is well defined in humans, just denied. Every time a person <br/>
reacts to a situation rather than acts on a situation they are dealing with their <br/>
animal nature. Understanding this goes a long way to aiding many in their <br/>
change from reaction to action thinking. Exactly what Shan was talking <br/>
about-interrupting her reacting (animal) nature for her acting (human) nature. I am sad <br/>
to know that this aspect of the shadow persona so well discussed by Carl Jung <br/>
and others is so easily discounted here. Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Karma isn&#39;t an excuse. But, when one wishes to embrace a dogma it should be <br/>
fully embraced and not just the cozy parts. Its rather hypocritical to say that <br/>
only the pleasant aspects of karma should be accepted while the shadow side <br/>
is ignored. Shadow has as many lessons as light to offer. That, I believe, is <br/>
why it is manifest still on the Earth. To infer that a soul isn&#39;t part of their <br/>
own contract incarnate is to play God/dess. <br/>
<br/>
Hitting has come back time and again into the discussion being only equated <br/>
with abuse and lack of restraint. How sad is that? I think that the difference <br/>
is that we can&#39;t ever agree that there would ever be an appropriate time to <br/>
apply physical punishment. I say grey and you say no there is only the word <br/>
&quot;black&quot; there is not another word in the dictionary that could ever be tolerated <br/>
in this discussion. In other words, to be simple for your understanding, there <br/>
is not a single case where you would find &#39;spanking&#39; appropriate. And I don&#39;t <br/>
agree. <br/>
<br/>
Although apparently its fine to ignore your child while in the throws of a <br/>
&#39;tantrum.&#39; Its okay, in other words, to withdraw your emotional support and <br/>
caring to indicate your displeasure of the child&#39;s actions? I think I understood <br/>
that correctly. That was suggested several times as an acceptable course of <br/>
action. Sorry, but, I don&#39;t accept that as anything but child abuse. Setting up a <br/>
child to perform because they can only obtain love, acceptance and communion <br/>
because they act within a certain set of accepted behaviors is far to passive <br/>
aggressive for me. I see it as far more damaging than the abrupt here and done <br/>
of a physical spank. It is insidious.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who equate unschooling with no training I think you have <br/>
deluded yourselves. <br/>
<br/>
Good-day<br/>

  Look, I don&#39;t think I and the others would have had such a hard time with your verbiage if your arguments for spanking hadn&#39;t been so vague. In the post I&#39;m responding to you were clear about the circumstances under which you would spank so thank you for that. If you think it&#39;s effective in those circumstance, say that. But to drag animal nature and karma into the argument to justify it seemed bizarre. It seemed an attempt to place those who don&#39;t spank into the category of denial...as unconductive to debate as you find some of the blanket condemnations of spanking. <br/>

<br/>
  I wish those people who believe in training would ask...Who trains an infant to crawl to its mothers breast? To sit up? To smile? To walk? To talk? And why in the heck do they think that the ability they used to discover and pratice those wonderful things suddenly disapears at some point in a young childs life? I would like proof that theres some radical change in their brain that makes them incapable of learning by obervation and imitation (Which accounts for the overwhelming amount of learning babies and toddlers do) and only responsive to teaching and training. Harumph. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637176783"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Did I say spanking? Or physical restraint? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You said corporal punishment, which many assumed to mean spanking.  <br/>
Are there other forms of physical pain or harm (besides spanking) <br/>
that you consider acceptable to inflict on a child?<br/>
What else do you have in your corporal punishment &quot;tool&quot; box?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when enraged because....why again? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To me, hitting a child is never okay, rage or no.<br/>
I think what was meant is that hitting in a rage is more <br/>
understandable than a calm, calculating approach.   People who have <br/>
smacked in a moment of frustration usually feel remorse and are very <br/>
sorry that it happened- their sense of compassion is healthy and <br/>
active.  The hitting was a mistake, in other words, and as humans we <br/>
can make mistakes and be forgiven.  But to rationally endorse it as <br/>
a &quot;training tool&quot; strikes me as totally lacking in compassion.  The <br/>
very idea makes my blood run cold.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What works quite well for you?  Hitting your own children?  Or <br/>
somebody hitting *you* for &quot;unacceptable behavior&quot;- either now or <br/>
when you were younger?<br/>
Is it acceptable to you for mentally retarded adults to have <br/>
physical punishment &quot;judiciously applied&quot; for their mistakes?  How <br/>
about the elderly?  If I&#39;m having a difficult day and somehow take <br/>
it out on my husband- speaking rudely to him mabye (unacceptable)- <br/>
does he have the right to smack me?  <br/>
I&#39;m guessing your &quot;gray area&quot; has to do with children only.  You <br/>
aren&#39;t alone- there are many people who see children as second class <br/>
citizens.  It&#39;s just odd to come across one of them on an <br/>
unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let&#39;s assume this is true.  (It&#39;s not.  My 10 and 8yo&#39;s &quot;long term <br/>
consequential thinking&quot; is up and running- probably in large part <br/>
because I didn&#39;t short circuit it with spankings and other <br/>
punishments- but for the sake of the argument we&#39;ll pretend).  <br/>
So corporal punishment is necessary why?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>in their <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; change from reaction to action thinking. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So now you&#39;re saying that we should avoid this &quot;animal nature.&quot;  But <br/>
in your first post you basically endorsed smacking as okay because <br/>
animals in the wild do it, and hey we&#39;re all animals right? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For those of you who equate unschooling with no training I think <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; deluded yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are people on this list who are lifelong unschoolers with <br/>
grown and nearly grown children who were never &quot;trained&quot; and yet <br/>
are, by all accounts, lovely people.<br/>
So who&#39;s deluded?<br/>
How old are your children?  How long have you been unschooling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548758421"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;But, oh, yes, I do believe in spanking. Yes, judiciously applied-<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but that will also be refuted here since none among you (except <br/>
perhaps those already under moderation) can consider judicious <br/>
application of physical corrections.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is it that you are hoping to correct out of your children with <br/>
spanking? I&#39;m curious, really. What behaviors would result in <br/>
judiciously applied spanking?<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t obey me. But they don&#39;t disobey me either. I don&#39;t set <br/>
up the rules and hand them down. That&#39;s sets up an us vs. them <br/>
situation that I have found is not the best way to nurture love and <br/>
connectedness. I give respect and expect it in return. When I screw <br/>
up with them, I apologize. They do the same for me.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what&#39;s missing from this discussion is the fact that many of us <br/>
with older, never spanked, much or always unschooled and mindfully <br/>
parented kids, do/did not have the need or desire to spank. It&#39;s not <br/>
an overnight, magic, perfect kid kind of thing. But it is product of <br/>
many years of mindfully connnecting with our children. My kids act as <br/>
a part of our family. They like and respect me as I do them. It shows <br/>
I think.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll say it again, there has NEVER been a situation that I&#39;ve looked <br/>
back on and wished I had hit my child. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; There are several who consider judicious application to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>be &#39;creepy&#39; was that the phrase used? But, conversely then, they must <br/>
think that hitting is okay when enraged because....why again? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think the point was that no hitting is okay. Losing control and <br/>
then regretting and making amends for it is understandable, if <br/>
regrettable behavior. Judicious application sounds a lot like <br/>
premeditated to me.<br/>
<br/>
Call me a finge movement kind of gal, but planning out when, where <br/>
and why I&#39;m going to hit my child and make them hurt and cry is not <br/>
acceptable. And yes, it sounds creepy. <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I would rather apply a thought out punishment for unacceptable <br/>
 </span></blockquote>behavior than be given to flights of animal rage&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Again, what are these behaviors that you experience that would <br/>
require either hitting or rage? We don&#39;t have those here. When Shan <br/>
described what happened with her son, lots of people responded with <br/>
ways to eliminate those situations so that they don&#39;t happen for her <br/>
again either. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Children IMO aren&#39;t mini adults.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. But they are still people in their own right. I don&#39;t hit people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Some actions aren&#39;t open for debate. Period.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Such as?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; For those of you who equate unschooling with no training I think <br/>
 </span></blockquote>you have deluded yourselves. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deluded ourselves how and of what? I&#39;m living in a peaceful, <br/>
respectful, kind and generous family. We live and learn and we don&#39;t <br/>
hit. And I&#39;ve seen it time and again in other families who are <br/>
mindful and respectful of their children. I&#39;ve seen many, many <br/>
families who spank too. Have you really experienced a family that <br/>
mindfully parents?<br/>

<br/>
Do we agree about unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to know if you agree that unschooling is a great way to raise <br/>

<br/>
Right now you are acting more like a troll than like a member of the <br/>

you can&#39;t write in a normal conversational tone.<br/>
<br/>
Debating how many angels can dance on a pin, or whether there are ever <br/>
circumstances that justify spanking, or any other hypothetical <br/>
abstraction isn&#39;t the best use of this list.  We&#39;re here to help real <br/>

This is so pompous that on top of being aggravating you sound <br/>
ridiculous.  There are hundreds of parents on this list and you can&#39;t <br/>
know who spanks or who spanks &quot;judiciously&quot; or doesn&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570194599">Tracey, I&#39;m not a regular poster on this list. I&#39;ve only known these <br/>
folks for a short period of time and they may not like what I&#39;m about <br/>
to say to you... but here goes. <br/>
<br/>
They have been very cordial to you and I find it a scream that three <br/>
times in your last post you&#39;ve accused them of veiled attacks....what <br/>
a hoot! They&#39;re being pretty straight with you about what they think! <br/>
But I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t agree! :P.... And here&#39;s the kicker...from <br/>
where I stand, they all have something you&#39;ll (at this point in time) <br/>
never understand and you SHOULD be worried about that. They are so <br/>
full of insight, love, and respect for young people and you may think <br/>
you have some of these traits too but it&#39;s very obvious you don&#39;t <br/>
understand their angle. So...don&#39;t critize what you truly don&#39;t get!<br/>
<br/>
This IS an unschooling list...and it&#39;s obvious to me you have no real <br/>
reason for being here accept to pick apart others belief&#39;s. Why do <br/>
that on a list that does not support your viewpoint? Gotta wonder?! I <br/>
also wonder how your own children view you; I&#39;m sure they have a <br/>
small amount of fear of you (as I know you wish them to have.) This <br/>
list is NOT about parenting and schooling using fear. So zip yer lip <br/>
and listen or risk being challeged everytime you post the poopy you <br/>
post. It&#39;s that simple.<br/>
<br/>
Also....I want to know why you would come here and end your posts <br/>
with Hugs, then warmly, then whatever the last one was? If you&#39;ve <br/>
always been accepted in other social situations and this is your <br/>
first rebuff, I could understand it... but somehow I don&#39;t think this <br/>
is the first time you&#39;ve argued on a list that doesn&#39;t believe in <br/>
spanking. It&#39;s also clear your reading comprehension is not at it&#39;s <br/>
best, because it&#39;s having you come across as trollish. Nothing veiled <br/>
about that complaint...is there?<br/>
<br/>
My apologies to the list owners, moderators and regular posters; I <br/>
can no longer be as tolerent and explanatory as you have been. I <br/>
realize Stacey could really learn from this list but my gut feeling <br/>
says she won&#39;t. It would be good to someday see Stacey do a <br/>
turnaround of sorts because she did learn something here.  Sara in NC<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you again for correcting my language (I see that is a <br/>
particular <br/>
&gt; compulsion for you).... Yes, I intended to use the word anathema. <br/>
Corporal meaning <br/>
&gt; having to do with the body. Did I say spanking? Or physical <br/>
restraint? But, oh, <br/>
&gt; yes, I do believe in spanking. Yes, judiciously applied-but that <br/>
will also be <br/>
&gt; refuted here since none among you (except perhaps those already <br/>
under <br/>
&gt; moderation) can consider judicious application of physical <br/>
corrections. I also <br/>
&gt; believe in capital punishment and hope Lacy Peterson&#39;s husband <br/>
makes the lights go <br/>
&gt; out in California.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are several who consider judicious application to be &#39;creepy&#39; <br/>
was that <br/>
&gt; the phrase used? But, conversely then, they must think that hitting <br/>
is okay <br/>
&gt; when enraged because....why again? (said in one post). Raging and <br/>
loss of <br/>
&gt; control is acceptable because it wasn&#39;t premeditated (the animal <br/>
equivalent to <br/>
&gt; uncontrolled anger in humans). Really?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would rather apply a thought out punishment for unacceptable <br/>
behavior than <br/>
&gt; be given to flights of animal rage (yes, rage is an animal emotion <br/>
which is <br/>
&gt; usually called uncontrolled anger by humans). Yes, it has worked <br/>
quite well for <br/>
&gt; me. Its called knowing what punishment is to be applied for a given <br/>
action in <br/>
&gt; advance and making that application under those circumstances only. <br/>
While you <br/>
&gt; may not find it acceptable. I call it thinking rather than reacting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of the compelling arguments against what many of you have <br/>
called <br/>
&gt; spanking seem well considered, though mixed into discussions <br/>
containing veiled <br/>
&gt; personal attacks which makes remaining on topic challenging. My <br/>
beliefs are simple. <br/>
&gt; If a my child disregards rules that have been developed for the <br/>
protection and <br/>
&gt; safety of that child, or where the property of others is concerned, <br/>
then that <br/>
&gt; child is given an escalating form of punishment. Physical <br/>
punishment is <br/>
&gt; applied rarely but applied when deemed necessary *to me*. You don&#39;t <br/>
agree that <br/>
&gt; there is any case where a child could escalate to a point where a <br/>
physical <br/>
&gt; reprimand is in order and I don&#39;t agree. You (meaning those on the <br/>
list vociferously <br/>
&gt; opposed to &#39;spanking&#39;) don&#39;t see where any behavior on the part of <br/>
a child <br/>
&gt; could warrant a physical reprimand. So, we don&#39;t agree. You believe <br/>
that it will <br/>
&gt; lead to long term injury, psychic damage. We don&#39;t agree.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You (again meaning the listers who have responded) don&#39;t seem to <br/>
understand <br/>
&gt; that as adults we have hopefully already been trained and don&#39;t <br/>
need physical <br/>
&gt; reminders ever-well unless you want to get into the aspects of <br/>
socially deviant <br/>
&gt; behavior (i.e., habitual criminals, etc.), which I doubt. Children <br/>
IMO aren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; mini adults. There long term consequential thinking isn&#39;t developed <br/>
until <br/>
&gt; there late teens and more typically early twenties. So application <br/>
of cause and <br/>
&gt; effect is far more functional until that time when the frontal <br/>
lobes of the <br/>
&gt; brain &#39;close&#39; making long term consequential thinking concrete. <br/>
Some actions <br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t open for debate. Period. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been called in obtuse language a variety of rather <br/>
colorfully <br/>
&gt; descriptive and rather unpleasant things. Many of these directed <br/>
simply because of the <br/>
&gt; verbiage I choose. How sad that you must make personal, though <br/>
cloaked, <br/>
&gt; attacks in order to support your self righteousness. English isn&#39;t <br/>
as standardized <br/>
&gt; as you might think. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Animal nature is well defined in humans, just denied. Every time a <br/>
person <br/>
&gt; reacts to a situation rather than acts on a situation they are <br/>
dealing with their <br/>
&gt; animal nature. Understanding this goes a long way to aiding many in <br/>
their <br/>
&gt; change from reaction to action thinking. Exactly what Shan was <br/>
talking <br/>
&gt; about-interrupting her reacting (animal) nature for her acting <br/>
(human) nature. I am sad <br/>
&gt; to know that this aspect of the shadow persona so well discussed by <br/>
Carl Jung <br/>
&gt; and others is so easily discounted here. Unschooling. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Karma isn&#39;t an excuse. But, when one wishes to embrace a dogma it <br/>
should be <br/>
&gt; fully embraced and not just the cozy parts. Its rather hypocritical <br/>
to say that <br/>
&gt; only the pleasant aspects of karma should be accepted while the <br/>
shadow side <br/>
&gt; is ignored. Shadow has as many lessons as light to offer. That, I <br/>
believe, is <br/>
&gt; why it is manifest still on the Earth. To infer that a soul isn&#39;t <br/>
part of their <br/>
&gt; own contract incarnate is to play God/dess. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hitting has come back time and again into the discussion being only <br/>
equated <br/>
&gt; with abuse and lack of restraint. How sad is that? I think that the <br/>
difference <br/>
&gt; is that we can&#39;t ever agree that there would ever be an appropriate <br/>
time to <br/>
&gt; apply physical punishment. I say grey and you say no there is only <br/>
the word <br/>
&gt; &quot;black&quot; there is not another word in the dictionary that could ever <br/>
be tolerated <br/>
&gt; in this discussion. In other words, to be simple for your <br/>
understanding, there <br/>
&gt; is not a single case where you would find &#39;spanking&#39; appropriate. <br/>
And I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; agree. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although apparently its fine to ignore your child while in the <br/>
throws of a <br/>
&gt; &#39;tantrum.&#39; Its okay, in other words, to withdraw your emotional <br/>
support and <br/>
&gt; caring to indicate your displeasure of the child&#39;s actions? I think <br/>
I understood <br/>
&gt; that correctly. That was suggested several times as an acceptable <br/>
course of <br/>
&gt; action. Sorry, but, I don&#39;t accept that as anything but child <br/>
abuse. Setting up a <br/>
&gt; child to perform because they can only obtain love, acceptance and <br/>
communion <br/>
&gt; because they act within a certain set of accepted behaviors is far <br/>
to passive <br/>
&gt; aggressive for me. I see it as far more damaging than the abrupt <br/>
here and done <br/>
&gt; of a physical spank. It is insidious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those of you who equate unschooling with no training I think <br/>
you have <br/>
&gt; deluded yourselves. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they understand the rules and the rules are sensible why are they be<br/>
pushing the limits repeatedly?<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t understand the rules then hitting isn&#39;t an explanation.<br/>
<br/>
If the rules don&#39;t make sense then hitting doesn&#39;t make them make sense.<br/>
<br/>

other planets -- then we couldn&#39;t take the debate any further than agreeing<br/>
or disagreeing.<br/>
<br/>
But people who have thoughtfully chosen not to hit their children know it<br/>
isn&#39;t necessary because they have kids -- sometimes challenging kids -- and<br/>
they don&#39;t hit them. They have found ways to solve problems that don&#39;t<br/>
involve hitting.<br/>
<br/>
People can bring problems here that they would solve with hitting a child.<br/>
We can help them find ways that don&#39;t involve hitting if they want to find<br/>
ways to live more peacefully with their children.<br/>
<br/>
(A better place is the NoMoreSpanking list.<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NoMoreSpanking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">NoMoreSpanking-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>) It isn&#39;t a list to debate<br/>
spanking but a place to find other ways to solve problems.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s damaging to adults, why is it not damaging to children?<br/>
<br/>
Treating children in ways that would be damaging to adults gets justified by<br/>
the fact that children are different. But the justification isn&#39;t well<br/>
supported. Just because children are different doesn&#39;t mean they are some<br/>
other creature entirely.<br/>
<br/>
Children&#39;s understanding of the world isn&#39;t the same as an adult&#39;s but they<br/>
can understand that someone hitting them to make them stop hitting doesn&#39;t<br/>
make sense. They can understand that it doesn&#39;t make sense for someone who<br/>
says they love them and will protect them to hit them. They can understand<br/>
that it&#39;s a whole lot better to be bigger and stronger than smaller and<br/>
weaker.<br/>
<br/>
Different isn&#39;t stupid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You (again meaning<br/>
&gt; the listers who have responded) don&#39;t seem to understand<br/>
&gt; that as adults we have hopefully already been trained and don&#39;t need physical<br/>
&gt; reminders ever<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Training implies that people choose to behave acceptably because of negative<br/>
associations (from punishment) with unacceptable behavior.<br/>
<br/>
As an adult I choose behavior that makes sense, not because I&#39;ve been<br/>
trained not to make unacceptable choices.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, being human, also chooses behavior that makes sense *to her*.<br/>
She&#39;s trying to meet her needs and choosing what seems the best way to do<br/>
that. If she chooses ways that are hurtful or dangerous, it&#39;s up to me to<br/>
make sure she and others are safe and then help her figure out what she<br/>
wants and help her figure out better ways of getting it.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a thinking human being who needs help meeting her needs and figuring<br/>
out how the world works.<br/>
<br/>
There are better ways that people can solve differences than by hitting each<br/>
other. As an adult I should be able to come up with better ways to resolve<br/>
conflicts with a smaller human who lacks my understanding of the world than<br/>
by hitting her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Children IMO aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; mini adults. There long term consequential thinking isn&#39;t developed until<br/>
&gt; there late teens and more typically early twenties. So application of cause<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; effect is far more functional until that time when the frontal lobes of the<br/>
&gt; brain &#39;close&#39; making long term consequential thinking concrete.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds fancy. Doesn&#39;t match my observations though.<br/>
<br/>
True, a child doesn&#39;t experience the world the same as an adult. Their needs<br/>
are different. Their understanding is different.<br/>
<br/>
But just because they don&#39;t have the same capacity to think things through<br/>
as an adult does, doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re incapable of thought and that,<br/>
therefore, the only means to stop their unacceptable behavior is hitting<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Children will perceive the world differently when they&#39;re older, because 1)<br/>
someone is helping them understand and 2) because their brains function<br/>
differently because of age.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, we can work to understand what the world looks like to them<br/>
and work *with* their understanding rather than punishing them because they<br/>
don&#39;t have the capacities, knowledge and skills that an adult does.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although apparently its fine to ignore your child while in the throws of a<br/>
&gt; &#39;tantrum.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all. I think that was a bad idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think I understood<br/>
&gt; that correctly. That was suggested several times as an acceptable course of<br/>
&gt; action.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obviously you don&#39;t understand correctly since it was only suggested once.<br/>
If you read it into other people&#39;s suggestions you weren&#39;t reading carefully<br/>
enough. (It will help to supply quotes if you want to discuss it further.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The purpose of using English on this list should be so someone else can<br/>
understand our thoughts. If your goal was to get people to understand what<br/>
you&#39;re thinking, then when people point out they can&#39;t understand what<br/>
you&#39;re saying, you&#39;d use that to figure out how to be clearer rather than<br/>
getting defensive of the way you&#39;re writing.<br/>
<br/>
So, apparently, you&#39;re using English for a different purpose than<br/>
communicating your thoughts. Apparently you&#39;re trying to dazzle people with<br/>
a lot of intellectual sounding phrases so that it appears that you know a<br/>
lot more than the person who is reading so they&#39;d be foolish to question<br/>
what you&#39;re saying.<br/>
<br/>

purpose is to waste people&#39;s time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Embrace your dogma fully but keep the ideas that are counter to the purpose<br/>
of the list off the list.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the list isn&#39;t to provide a place for people who call<br/>
themselves unschoolers to discuss whatever they want. The purpose of the<br/>
list is to help people understand and get to unschooling. And, for those<br/>
parents who want to extend the unschooling philosophy into parenting, it&#39;s<br/>
for discussing that too. Here&#39;s the list description. Maybe you missed it:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Unschooling is not a homeschool teaching method. It refers to a philosophy of<br/>
&gt;&gt; natural learning as well as the lifestyle that results from living according<br/>
&gt;&gt; to the principles of that philosophy.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The most basic principle of unschooling is that children are born with an<br/>
&gt;&gt; intrinsic urge to explore -- for a moment or a lifetime -- what intrigues<br/>
&gt;&gt; them, as they seek to join the adult world in a personally satisfying way.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Because of that urge, an unschooling child is free to choose the what, when,<br/>
&gt;&gt; where and how of his/her own learning from mud puddles to video games and<br/>
&gt;&gt; SpongeBob Squarepants to Shakespeare! And an unschooling parent sees his/her<br/>
&gt;&gt; role, not as a teacher, but as a facilitator and companion in a child&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; exploration of the world.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Unschooling is a mindful lifestyle which encompasses, at its core, an<br/>
&gt;&gt; atmosphere of trust, freedom, joy and deep respect for who the child is. This<br/>
&gt;&gt; cannot be lived on a part-time basis. Unschooling sometimes seems so<br/>
&gt;&gt; intuitive that people feel they&#39;ve been doing it all along, not realizing it<br/>
&gt;&gt; has a name. Unschooling sometimes seems so counterintuitive that people<br/>
&gt;&gt; struggle to understand it, and it can take years to fully accept its worth.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The purpose of this list is to move out of our own comfort zones as we<br/>
&gt;&gt; critically examine our beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about learning, and<br/>
&gt;&gt; seek a deeper understanding of unschooling and more respectful relationships<br/>
&gt;&gt; with our children.<br/>

&gt; Thank you again for correcting my language (I see that is a particular<br/>

&gt; Corporal meaning<br/>
&gt; having to do with the body. Did I say spanking? Or physical restraint? <br/>
&gt; But, oh,<br/>
&gt; yes, I do believe in spanking. Yes, judiciously applied-but that will <br/>
&gt; also be<br/>
&gt; refuted here since none among you (except perhaps those already under<br/>
&gt; moderation) can consider judicious application of physical <br/>
&gt; corrections. I also<br/>
&gt; believe in capital punishment and hope Lacy Peterson&#39;s husband makes <br/>
&gt; the lights go<br/>
&gt; out in California.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are several who consider judicious application to be &#39;creepy&#39; <br/>
&gt; was that<br/>
&gt; the phrase used? But, conversely then, they must think that hitting is <br/>
&gt; okay<br/>
&gt; when enraged because....why again? (said in one post). Raging and loss of<br/>
&gt; control is acceptable because it wasn&#39;t premeditated (the animal <br/>
&gt; equivalent to<br/>
&gt; uncontrolled anger in humans). Really?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would rather apply a thought out punishment for unacceptable <br/>
&gt; behavior than<br/>
&gt; be given to flights of animal rage (yes, rage is an animal emotion <br/>
&gt; which is<br/>
&gt; usually called uncontrolled anger by humans). Yes, it has worked quite <br/>
&gt; well for<br/>
&gt; me. Its called knowing what punishment is to be applied for a given <br/>
&gt; action in<br/>
&gt; advance and making that application under those circumstances only. <br/>
&gt; While you<br/>
&gt; may not find it acceptable. I call it thinking rather than reacting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Many of the compelling arguments against what many of you have called<br/>
&gt; spanking seem well considered, though mixed into discussions <br/>
&gt; containing veiled<br/>
&gt; personal attacks which makes remaining on topic challenging. My <br/>
&gt; beliefs are simple.<br/>
&gt; If a my child disregards rules that have been developed for the <br/>
&gt; protection and<br/>
&gt; safety of that child, or where the property of others is concerned, <br/>
&gt; then that<br/>
&gt; child is given an escalating form of punishment. Physical punishment is<br/>
&gt; applied rarely but applied when deemed necessary *to me*. You don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; agree that<br/>
&gt; there is any case where a child could escalate to a point where a <br/>
&gt; physical<br/>
&gt; reprimand is in order and I don&#39;t agree. You (meaning those on the <br/>
&gt; list vociferously<br/>
&gt; opposed to &#39;spanking&#39;) don&#39;t see where any behavior on the part of a <br/>
&gt; child<br/>
&gt; could warrant a physical reprimand. So, we don&#39;t agree. You believe <br/>
&gt; that it will<br/>
&gt; lead to long term injury, psychic damage. We don&#39;t agree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; brain &#39;close&#39; making long term consequential thinking concrete. Some <br/>
&gt; actions<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t open for debate. Period.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have been called in obtuse language a variety of rather colorfully<br/>
&gt; descriptive and rather unpleasant things. Many of these directed <br/>
&gt; simply because of the<br/>
&gt; verbiage I choose. How sad that you must make personal, though cloaked,<br/>
&gt; attacks in order to support your self righteousness. English isn&#39;t as <br/>
&gt; standardized<br/>
&gt; as you might think.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Animal nature is well defined in humans, just denied. Every time a person<br/>
&gt; reacts to a situation rather than acts on a situation they are dealing <br/>
&gt; with their<br/>
&gt; animal nature. Understanding this goes a long way to aiding many in their<br/>
&gt; change from reaction to action thinking. Exactly what Shan was talking<br/>
&gt; about-interrupting her reacting (animal) nature for her acting (human) <br/>
&gt; nature. I am sad<br/>
&gt; to know that this aspect of the shadow persona so well discussed by <br/>
&gt; Carl Jung<br/>
&gt; and others is so easily discounted here. Unschooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Karma isn&#39;t an excuse. But, when one wishes to embrace a dogma it <br/>
&gt; should be<br/>
&gt; fully embraced and not just the cozy parts. Its rather hypocritical to <br/>
&gt; say that<br/>
&gt; only the pleasant aspects of karma should be accepted while the shadow <br/>
&gt; side<br/>
&gt; is ignored. Shadow has as many lessons as light to offer. That, I <br/>
&gt; believe, is<br/>
&gt; why it is manifest still on the Earth. To infer that a soul isn&#39;t part <br/>
&gt; of their<br/>
&gt; own contract incarnate is to play God/dess.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hitting has come back time and again into the discussion being only <br/>
&gt; equated<br/>
&gt; with abuse and lack of restraint. How sad is that? I think that the <br/>
&gt; difference<br/>
&gt; is that we can&#39;t ever agree that there would ever be an appropriate <br/>
&gt; time to<br/>
&gt; apply physical punishment. I say grey and you say no there is only the <br/>
&gt; word<br/>
&gt; &quot;black&quot; there is not another word in the dictionary that could ever be <br/>
&gt; tolerated<br/>
&gt; in this discussion. In other words, to be simple for your <br/>
&gt; understanding, there<br/>
&gt; is not a single case where you would find &#39;spanking&#39; appropriate. And <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; agree.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Although apparently its fine to ignore your child while in the throws <br/>
&gt; of a<br/>
&gt; &#39;tantrum.&#39; Its okay, in other words, to withdraw your emotional <br/>
&gt; support and<br/>
&gt; caring to indicate your displeasure of the child&#39;s actions? I think I <br/>
&gt; understood<br/>
&gt; that correctly. That was suggested several times as an acceptable <br/>
&gt; course of<br/>
&gt; action. Sorry, but, I don&#39;t accept that as anything but child abuse. <br/>
&gt; Setting up a<br/>
&gt; child to perform because they can only obtain love, acceptance and <br/>
&gt; communion<br/>
&gt; because they act within a certain set of accepted behaviors is far to <br/>
&gt; passive<br/>
&gt; aggressive for me. I see it as far more damaging than the abrupt here <br/>
&gt; and done<br/>
&gt; of a physical spank. It is insidious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For those of you who equate unschooling with no training I think you have<br/>
&gt; deluded yourselves.<br/>

She can still read, and if a post is sent talking about her own unschooling, <br/>
I&#39;ll let that through.<br/>

<h4>Lori</h4>
<p><small><time>24 Nov 2003, at  7:11am</time></small></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814290920">Hello, I just wanted to post a quick intro... I&#39;ve been reading for a <br/>
few weeks, and thought that I&#39;d introduce myself before jumping into <br/>
all of the good conversation.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Lori Upchurch, I live in Chicago with my family, three kids- <br/>
Louise, almost 8, Winston, age 4, and little Benji who is 7 months old <br/>
tomorrow.  Also in the house is my husband John, and our pets.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling since taking our daughter out of kindergarden in <br/>
2000.  We are fortunate to have a great community of like minded folks <br/>
to hang out with and explore the city with.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s snowing and cold here today, the first of the season.  I look <br/>
forward to reading and writing with you this winter... already a lot of <br/>
what I&#39;ve been reading has taken me further into the world of gentle <br/>
parenting.  I need that these days, we are under endless construction <br/>
(that was supposed to be done at the beginning of october!) and I am <br/>
walking around feeling like I&#39;ve been punched in the stomach worrying <br/>
about it... I have to remember to breathe and be with my kids, this <br/>
list has been helping me do that!<br/>
<br/>
Lori</div>
