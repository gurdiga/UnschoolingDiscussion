<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808076613">Q: Should I have a baby after35? <br/>
A: No, 35 children is enough. <br/>
<br/>
Q: I&#39;m two months pregnant now. When will my baby move? <br/>
A: With any luck, right after he finishes college. <br/>
<br/>
Q: What is the most common pregnancy craving? <br/>
A: For men to be the ones who get pregnant. <br/>
<br/>
Q: What is the most reliable method to determine a baby&#39;s sex? <br/>
A: Childbirth. <br/>
<br/>
Q: The more pregnant I get, the more often strangers smile at me. Why? <br/>
A: &#39;Cause you&#39;re fatter than they are. <br/>
<br/>
Q: My wife is five months pregnant and so moody that sometimes she&#39;s <br/>
borderline irrational. <br/>
A: So what&#39;s your question? <br/>
<br/>
Q: My childbirth instructor says it&#39;s not pain I&#39;ll feel during labor, <br/>
but pressure. Is she right? <br/>
A: Yes, in the same way that a tornado might be called an air current. <br/>
<br/>
Q: When is the best time to get an epidural? <br/>
A: Right after you find out you&#39;re pregnant. <br/>
<br/>
Q: Is there any reason I have to be in the delivery room while my wife <br/>
is in labor? <br/>
A: Not unless the word &quot;alimony&quot; means anything to you. <br/>
<br/>
Q: Is there anything I should avoid while recovering from childbirth? <br/>
A: Yes, pregnancy. <br/>
<br/>
Q: Do I have to have a baby shower? <br/>
A: Not if you change the baby&#39;s diaper very quickly. <br/>
<br/>
Q: Our baby was born last week. When will my wife begin to feel and act <br/>
normal again? <br/>
A: When the kids are in college. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-537907996">I thought I would share this with you all, even<br/>
tho some may know already!  My husband decided to<br/>
cut off all of his hair, about 14 inches of<br/>
it!!!!!  Anyway, Great Clips sent it home with<br/>
him.  They gave us an address and telephone<br/>
number.  Seems that there is a place that makes<br/>
wigs for children with cancer!  I thought his was<br/>
a fabulous cause and thought I would pass on the<br/>
info to anyone who may not know about it!<br/>
