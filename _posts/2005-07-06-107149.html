<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358011155">Hi Terri,<br/>
Just catching up so I dont know if you have gotten the info you&#39;re looking  <br/>
for but I asked my son who is 14 and a big Yu-Gi-Oh.  He suggested getting  a <br/>
structure deck either one called Fury from the Deep and/or Blaze of  <br/>
Destruction he says these are better than the starter decks but if you wanted a  starter <br/>
deck he suggested Kaiba Evolution.  He also said that each deck  comes with a <br/>
rule book.<br/>
Also if your son wanted to and if it was ok with you he could either email  <br/>
or IM my son with any questions etc.<br/>
Feel free to email if you would like<br/>
Lisa<br/>
