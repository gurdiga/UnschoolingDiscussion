ongoing geography project for homeschooling families.  Rather than<br/>
subsribe to; post a message then unsubscribe to 50 lists, I have decided<br/>
to ask of you a favor.<br/>
<br/>
We would like news of our project to reach homeschooling families all<br/>
over the world,and we need your help.<br/>
<br/>
The Trekker Bear project monitors the progress of Trekker T.W.T. Bear.<br/>
Host families open their homes to Trekker for one week, post his<br/>
adventues to the Trekker Bear List and send him on to his next host<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
The Trekker Bear Project is managed by Alexis Carrington (me) of the<br/>
Carrington Family, in New York State.<br/>
