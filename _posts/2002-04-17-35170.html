How do you help someone else learn something that you are not very good at?<br/>
Do you trade with somebody?  I hope not, I have nobody to *trade* with.  I<br/>
am not even personal friends with anybody doing this,,,only you people.  The<br/>
people I know are still having trouble comprehending HOMEschooling.<br/>

Major breakthroughs in reading are occurring now but this math thingy still<br/>
has me on pretty shakey ground.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094322382">I wouldn&#39;t worry about math.  Math happens.  It is only when it is forced,<br/>
and in ps it is usually by someone who was math phobic to begin with so the<br/>
math phobia goes on and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
there are tons of fun computer programs out there that incorporate math,<br/>
some specific for math, board games, video games, cooking, spending money,<br/>
checking prices at the grocery store, saving money, building things (using<br/>
tape measure, etc.).  Math is everywhere and one just relaxes, it isn&#39;t all<br/>
that hard.<br/>
<br/>
IF she wants to learn the school type stuff later when she is older, there<br/>
are lots of good computer programs.   I know a woman who was totally math<br/>
phobic and yet learned algebra and geometry right along with her daughter<br/>
because it was fun and not &quot;required.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-602324619">Don&#39;t ask me how I managed to escape unscathed from my high school <br/>
math experiences.  I never had trouble with numbers, but did pretty<br/>
poorly in algebra and geometry (which played hell with my grade point<br/>
average as I was honor roll everything else). I never had a complex<br/>
about it, I just thought &quot;this doesn&#39;t make sense and is useless to<br/>
me&quot;. I knew how to play the game and get through. My high school<br/>
math teachers took pity on me and made sure I passed.  How I have<br/>
no idea. I really did not understand most of the work.  My husband<br/>
and I run a successful business, in fact I am the Chief Financial<br/>
Officer of our corporation.  Its not just a title either, but a real job LOL!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122995709">Kathy,<br/>
You brought up something I believe in very deeply.<br/>
I could take 6 years to teach a concept to one of my children, yet if I<br/>
had waited they could learn it in a matter of minutes! I feel that&#39;s how<br/>
math works!<br/>
Honestly, folks should ask themselves, &quot;WHAT did I really get out of<br/>
grade school?&quot; Little or nothing should be the answer, or, I don&#39;t<br/>
remember. &quot;Nothing I didn&#39;t do at home.&quot;<br/>
Einstein and Newton didn&#39;t go to school. Look at what they did when let<br/>
loose of demanding curriculums!<br/>
I believe that we learn detailed things better as ADULTS than any other<br/>
time in our lives. When we set our hearts to getting something done we<br/>
get it done. Like you being the Chief Financial Officer of your<br/>
corporation. The math classes that you near failed at are nothing but a<br/>
distant memory. It didn&#39;t REALLY matter did it?<br/>
I want my children to not be lazy. I believe that if I give them the<br/>
room to do things that they are interested in they will have<br/>
self-motivation.<br/>
Too much manipulated structure creates laziness.<br/>
You sound very motivated in your work. Maybe it was a blessing that the<br/>
teachers didn&#39;t give you a hard time and found a heart to &quot;pass&quot; you, it<br/>
took the pressure off and kept you motivated, maybe?<br/>
We do use Saxon math around here. I pick and choose what to use<br/>
according to my children&#39;s bent.<br/>
Sometimes the book just sits there. There is no pressure to do the work<br/>
anymore. I found that when I required a lesson a day my 14 yr. old was<br/>
miserable and didn&#39;t have the motivation to do anything else. The<br/>
lessons literally ruined her day.<br/>
I shoved the book across the table and told her, &quot;Do it when you feel<br/>
you can.&quot;<br/>
She loves working in her math book at night, She prefers to do only 15<br/>
problems a day. She went from getting 15 out of 30 wrong to 2 out of 15<br/>
wrong and she&#39;s able to find her own mistakes. She has even begun to<br/>
reference back in her book all by herself! I remember when she was<br/>
working on a problem and I asked her what her first thought was and she<br/>
took the book and began searching back a few chapters! I almost fell on<br/>
the floor! This is a child that would well up in tears at the sight of<br/>
her math book. Her heart has totally changed!<br/>
She likes to do it now, but on HER terms. Not mine. And you know what?<br/>
If she slid it under the bed and didn&#39;t touch it again, that&#39;s okay with<br/>
me. She&#39;ll be alright, I know she will. AND she isn&#39;t lazy. She knows<br/>
where to find the information she needs. <br/>
Thanks for letting share! Sorry so long too! This is a great place to<br/>
relate. Not many homeschoolers understand someone that isn&#39;t tied to the<br/>
curriculum. I&#39;m glad I found ya&#39;ll!<br/>
Going camping.be back Monday!<br/>

 <br/>
Don&#39;t ask me how I managed to escape unscathed from my high school <br/>
math experiences.  I never had trouble with numbers, but did pretty<br/>
poorly in algebra and geometry (which played hell with my grade point<br/>
average as I was honor roll everything else). I never had a complex<br/>
about it, I just thought &quot;this doesn&#39;t make sense and is useless to<br/>
me&quot;. I knew how to play the game and get through. My high school<br/>
math teachers took pity on me and made sure I passed.  How I have<br/>
no idea. I really did not understand most of the work.  My husband<br/>
and I run a successful business, in fact I am the Chief Financial<br/>
Officer of our corporation.  Its not just a title either, but a real job<br/>
LOL!<br/>

When they are ready they learn it and until then your wasting your time and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-351242999">I hear that!  When I was young and came home from school if my mother was<br/>
working (usually she did not, that was back in the 50s, ya know, the Happy<br/>
Days, Leave it to Beaver time) I could not stand the lonely feeling in the<br/>
house.  Eventhough I did not understand what it was I was feeling I just<br/>
felt so lost.  I would dread coming home from school just because the house<br/>
seemed so empty and lonely.<br/>
<br/>
I loved elementary school.  Always got straight A&#39;s. always popular with all<br/>
the kids and staff and usually involved in everything.  School was very<br/>
different back then than it has become these days though.  Now it is not<br/>
even a safe place to me.<br/>
<br/>
That is one of the things I like best about unschooling is the fact that she<br/>
is here with me where I know she is safe and know exactly what is going on<br/>
with her.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Major breakthroughs in reading are occurring now but this math thingy still<br/>
&gt; has me on pretty shakey ground.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It took me a looong time to get unschooling math. I think because school<br/>
leads us to believe that it&#39;s all about the rote learning of arcane formulas<br/>
to manipulate numbers and the only way to learn them is by precise teaching<br/>
and hours of practice.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s necessary to get *school* math but not real math. There are loads of<br/>
kids who can muddle through the percentage problems in the percentage<br/>
chapterofthe math book but haven&#39;t a clue on how to figure out 5% sales tax<br/>
or what 20% off means.<br/>
<br/>
Which doesn&#39;t mean schools need to teach more. It means they need to teach<br/>
less and help kids explore how numbers work in their lives more. Teaching<br/>
math the way schools do without giving kids the opportunity to be immersed<br/>
in math that&#39;s personally meaningful is like trying to teach Spanish by<br/>
teaching grammar and vocabulary without ever hearing it or using it for<br/>
personally meaningful reasons. It&#39;s the difference between learning English<br/>
as a side effect of using it versus learning a foreign language step by<br/>
tedious step.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that if schools allow kids to absorb math the way they<br/>
absorbed English the schools run up against their biggest road block which<br/>
providing feedback to parents and administrators and the state that the kids<br/>
are learning. Unfortunately the best methods that allow schools to provide<br/>
the best feedback are also the methods that are the most difficult for kids<br/>
to learn through.<br/>
<br/>
I think learning to &quot;speak&quot; math can&#39;t be emphasized enough. That means talk<br/>
through the process you&#39;re going through to solve a problem in your head.<br/>
Avoid pencil and paper. If the problem seems to unweildy, break it up into<br/>
easier problems that you can solve in your head. That way kids can see --<br/>
even if they aren&#39;t &quot;getting it&quot; or paying close attention -- how numbers<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Pencil and paper math is something entirely different. Some kids love it,<br/>
like puzzles. But they (and those who are forced to do it) won&#39;t necessarily<br/>
learn how numbers work because the numbers on paper are fixed. The numbers<br/>
can&#39;t be altered and manipulated and pushed and pulled to make them tell you<br/>
the answer.<br/>
<br/>
A child who has manipulated how much allowance she has to figure out how<br/>
much more she needs to buy something, and figured out the scores in games --<br/>
and has heard her parents do these things so she&#39;s comfortable with the<br/>
process -- can &quot;get&quot; what borrowing and carrying means (say before she takes<br/>
the SATs ;-) because she&#39;s done that without realizing it. Whereas it can<br/>
take hours and hours to teach it to a child whose major experience with<br/>
numbers is problems in a book.<br/>
<br/>
People tend to think of the addition and multiplication tables as synonymous<br/>
with being able to do addition and multiplication. But they only mean a<br/>
child can do the problems faster not that they have a clue what the process<br/>
means. In fact a child counting on her fingers is showing she knows what<br/>
addition means.<br/>

Acorns. Hot wheels! ;-) Anything specifically designed for sorting and<br/>
counting has built in ways the kids are &quot;supposed&quot; to sort. They are<br/>
deliberately limited so as not to be &quot;confusing&quot;. That way when kids come up<br/>
with the built in right answer teachers can check off that they&#39;ve<br/>
demonstrated an understanding of the concept.<br/>

Real things allow kids the freedom to explore surprising similarities that<br/>
may not be obvious. Learning to observe is a much more useful skill to a<br/>
real scientist or mathemetician (or cook or automotive mechanic or ...) than<br/>
being able to notice what everyone else has already noticed!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494186589">Hi everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I started homeschooling my 4 year old on Sept 10 of last year. I can say that<br/>
I have been homeschooling and especially unschooling way before I knew<br/>
the terms. I thought of it as parenting.<br/>
<br/>
We live here in NYC. Our first field trip was to be to the top of the <br/>
WTC. After<br/>
the 11th, my husband and I became even more resolved to have our kids enjoy<br/>
life without the pressures of conforming to a 9-5 lifestyle that we do not live<br/>
as artists. So life has become our school.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;A child who has manipulated how much allowance she has to figure out how<br/>

&gt;take hours and hours to teach it to a child whose major experience with<br/>
&gt;numbers is problems in a book.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is absolutely right. At school I had to struggle to keep my grades up.<br/>
It was more a matter of pride that enjoyment. I WANTED that summa cum<br/>
laude. It did not mean I wanted to learn math. I just wanted that piece of<br/>
paper that said I was on top.<br/>
<br/>
I love shopping for clothes and have always loved to since as far as I can<br/>
remember. My parents did not talk about allowances. We had budgets<br/>
and had to manage out money for whatever we needed. Needless to say,<br/>
I became an excellent bargain shopper and that is a skill that involves<br/>
accounting, appraising and logistics.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;means. In fact a child counting on her fingers is showing she knows what<br/>
&gt;addition means.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BAKING is probably one of the best ways of incorporating math into <br/>
the mundaneness<br/>
of life. For good baking to happen, measures have to be exact. <br/>
Although US cookbooks<br/>
use spoons and cups, there are a few (live Levi-Beranbaum&#39;s Cake Bible and<br/>
Pie & Pastry Bible) that use weight measures. Cups and spoons are great for<br/>
fractions and multiplications. The pans for cupcakes and cakes are <br/>
great for showing<br/>
ratios and weights are a wonderful way of seeing the difference <br/>
between &quot;analog&quot;<br/>
and digital measures. Then, of course, there is the added bonus of having the<br/>
opportunity to go over physics, chemistry, biology and physiology <br/>
(especially if there<br/>
are food allergies involved).<br/>
<br/>
Math can be as easy as the reward of a home-baked cupcake ;-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; People tend to think of the addition and multiplication tables as <br/>
synonymous<br/>
with being able to do addition and multiplication. But they only mean a<br/>
child can do the problems faster  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
MEMORIZING them might mean a child can do the problems faster.<br/>
<br/>
But the tables (which people seem rarely to consider) are literally just a <br/>
grid.  A graph, showing one set of numbers along the bottom, another across <br/>
the top, and &quot;the answers&quot; (depending on what function is being shown) in the <br/>
corresponding (x,y) spot.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Doing a times table&quot; means making one of those up and filling it in.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean shouting the answer in response to seeing a 7x8=____ flashcard.<br/>
<br/>
Estimating is a great tool, too.  Lots of people who have memorized the <br/>
answer to 7x8 would hestitate if asked &quot;Would 7x8 be more or less than 70?&quot;  <br/>
They would probably take 70 and hold their memorized 56 up to it and see if <br/>
it was greater or lesser, instead of thinking that 7x10 is 70, so 7x8 is less <br/>
than that.  <br/>
<br/>
In other words, one doesn&#39;t have to have any idea what 7x8 equals to know it <br/>
is less than 70.  If they look at the situation and they understand what math <br/>
is for, they would know that $8 a week allowance isn&#39;t going to buy a $70 <br/>
pair of skates in seven weeks&#39; time.<br/>
<br/>
And rather than try to TEACH them any of what&#39;s above, it&#39;s better for the <br/>
parent to learn to trust that they will learn it from playing dice games and <br/>
cards and spending money and goofing with Lego or maybe knitting or laying <br/>
tile or other &quot;pattern games.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887480070">**Even better than plastic counters are *real* things! :-) Leaves. Rocks. <br/>
Acorns. Hot wheels! ;-) Anything specifically designed for sorting and <br/>
counting has built in ways the kids are &quot;supposed&quot; to sort. They are <br/>
deliberately limited so as not to be &quot;confusing&quot;. That way when kids come up <br/>
with the built in right answer teachers can check off that they&#39;ve <br/>
demonstrated an understanding of the concept.**<br/>
<br/>
My personal favorite collection is my coins. A medium large tub full of <br/>
foreign coins and &quot;almost coins&quot; (a phone token from Italy, a laundromat <br/>
token from Belgium, a Chicago Transit Authority subway token, a game room <br/>
token...). I&#39;m lucky to have relatives who&#39;ve traveled and saved their pocket <br/>
change for us, and friends who&#39;ve traded with me. Mostly my kids use them for <br/>
playing poker with their grandparents, but they&#39;ve also at various times <br/>
pulled the bin out to sort and ponder and look through the coins. Often <br/>
they&#39;ll join me if I happen to be looking through them myself. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s math and history and geography and culture and metalurgy and who <br/>
knows how many other conversations in that bin. They can be sorted by <br/>
country, by metal, by shape, by pictorial subject... And they feel good in <br/>
your fingers. :)<br/>
<br/>
I was so happy when my dad brought us some Euros in March. Another little bit <br/>
of the world in our hands. :)<br/>
