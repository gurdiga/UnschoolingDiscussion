<div id="ygrps-yiv-488402034">The video game list (which I found very funny) which led to the Acme physics list (which I found very funny) made me think of the physics warning labels from the Journal of Irreproducible Results.  Two of my favorites from that list are these two: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Process Known as &#39;Tunneling,&#39; This Product May Spontaneously Disappear<br/>
from Its Present Location and Reappear at Any Random Place in the<br/>
Universe, Including Your Neighbors Domicile.  The Manufacturer Will Not<br/>
