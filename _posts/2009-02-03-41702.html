I&#39;ll at least put up a summary and some recommendations, in a few  <br/>
days.  I&#39;m still working on the young children chat.<br/>
<br/>
Dina, or anyone, we could use some recommendations of soothing  <br/>
instrumental stuff.  I recommended Telemann sonatas.  There was talk  <br/>
of something with cello.  Handel&#39;s Water Music Suite might be good too.<br/>
<br/>
What also would be useful is recommendations of music for young  <br/>
children.  My kids are older, and there&#39;s newer more current stuff  <br/>
available.   Are there favorites here?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035348820">i have to say that logan loves what we listen to.  dh and i are both musicians and have a <br/>
pretty wide taste in music.  logan has always loved anything with guitar.  in fact, dh is so <br/>
proud that his little blonde haired, blue eyed guy loves slayer, metallica and megadeth.  so <br/>
funny.  he rocks out and dances around whenever he hears it.<br/>
<br/>
for kids stuff, i have to admit, i can&#39;t stand most of it so we don&#39;t listen to stuff that is <br/>
specifically geared towards young kids.  selfish i know.  logan seems to really like They <br/>
Might Be Giants, who have videos available (we watch them on you tube) of really catchy <br/>
songs about letters and numbers.  the animation is also awesome.<br/>
<br/>
i also have a friend, sara wheeler, who does music for babies/young kids and she is really <br/>
talented.  i haven&#39;t heard all of her stuff but she has sang some over the phone for me and <br/>
i like it a lot.  she has a very folksy sound.  she can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.littlegroove.com/">http://www.littlegroove.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
as far as soothing goes, i&#39;m probably not the one to suggest anything. most of what i <br/>
listen to *i* find soothing but others may not.  classical is always a good choice.  some <br/>
mozart piano sonatas or symphonies (in major keys) are always soothing.  like sandra <br/>
said, handel is a great choice too.  <br/>
<br/>
will also ask dh what he would suggest for soothing stuff.  bear in mind that this is a guy <br/>
that has been know to listen to 20 minutes of guys screaming.  seriously.  <br/>
<br/>
dina, who is hoping that the plug for her friend sara wasn&#39;t too shameless<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1678858262">I love classical guitar - it can be very soothing and quiet.  &quot;Angel<br/>
Romero Plays Bach&quot; is a disc that I particularly like.  There are also<br/>
quite a few Christopher Parkening that I like, but I think his Bach<br/>
Celebration disc has an orchestra and I prefer listening to one<br/>
guitar.  My mom played these to my siblings and I when we were babies<br/>
and apparently we liked them a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Yo-yo-ma playing &quot;The 6 unaccompanied cello suites&quot; by Bach is lovely.<br/>
<br/>
I find music with one or just a few instruments much more soothing.<br/>
Bach is also soothing for me.<br/>
<br/>
I have some cd&#39;s by Fritz Wunderlich singing Schubert and/or Schumann<br/>
that are beautiful and very peaceful.  I would need to pull them out<br/>
to figure out which ones... not sure if there is interest in singing<br/>
but if there is, let me know, and I will listen to them and figure out<br/>
which one I meant.<br/>
<br/>
None of these recordings are particularly new (my mom grew up<br/>
listening to Wunderlich) but they are all great.<br/>
