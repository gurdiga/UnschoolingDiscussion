 </span></blockquote>I have one of those old-timey rotary mowers! I love it. :o) We always leave <br/>
the grass clippings on the lawn. As for the leaves, well I live in the <br/>
mountains and it&#39;s pretty windy up here. Most times they just blow away. I <br/>
*do* wonder where they ultimately end up though? Is here some HUGE leaf pile <br/>
somewhere east of me? Maybe Colorado. ;-)<br/>
