<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941485941">This is my third time joining this list. I did about<br/>
six months ago. I don&#39;t remember what the argument<br/>
was, but I felt for the newcomer who was seeking<br/>
support and was getting some judgments from others.  A<br/>
month or so later, I tried again, and it was somewhat<br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
I think perhaps if all of us can remember to<br/>
interject, In my opinion, or what worked for<br/>
us...etc.,  that would go along way to help keep the<br/>
subject on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Remember, we are here because we *don&#39;t* have the<br/>
support of the larger community. Perhaps we all get to<br/>
where we hope to be, at our own pace, and our own<br/>
unique way. Whether our children have OCD, allergies,<br/>
ADD, LD, whatever, they are special and unique. And<br/>
none of us is responsible for their difficulties. <br/>
<br/>
We are all trying. I applaud all of you who are<br/>
working so hard to give your children what he or she<br/>
needs. <br/>

just my opinion and no one had to do it. &lt;big grin&gt; <br/>
