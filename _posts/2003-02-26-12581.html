<div id="ygrps-yiv-570627655">Hi all<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted here for quite a long time.  <br/>
I don&#39;t really know why I&#39;m posting now.  I think I want to try to <br/>
get back to some kind of normal here, and am hoping a little <br/>
discussion might help.  My son Sam fell through the ice at a local <br/>
park while there with a friend and his family.  He left at 1:00 that <br/>
afternoon and at 5:30 we recieved the phone call.  That was Jan. 19, <br/>
and I&#39;m still trying to accept that he&#39;s not coming home.   I&#39;m not <br/>
ready to write about it yet.  I want to write a journal, but haven&#39;t <br/>
been able to put much down.<br/>
What I do want to write about here is how absolutely grateful I have <br/>
felt about unschooling.  It was one of the first thoughts that came <br/>
into my mind when I started to be able to think again.  Thank God we <br/>
found this path.  Thank God not a minute was wasted.  I&#39;m not <br/>
religious, though I find myself in a state of transition when it <br/>
comes to my spirituality.  But I don&#39;t know who else to thank. <br/>
Though I do want to thank all of you people who have helped me on <br/>
this journey.  I don&#39;t need to explain here what I mean by all of <br/>
this.  We know what we&#39;re doing here when it comes to giving our <br/>
children real lives.  Lives spent full of joy and wonder.  That&#39;s how <br/>
Sam has been described over and over.  Full of joy.<br/>
Our whole town came out in support of us.  It was beautiful and <br/>
overwhelming.  I&#39;m still getting it.<br/>
We recieved donations and we&#39;re taking our time, but we want to give <br/>
in him name through the years.  While many people are on a campaign <br/>
to try to prevent tragedies like this from happening again, I keep <br/>
coming to the thought of trying to find a way to help parents really <br/>
understand how precious every minute is with their children.  <br/>
Appreciating the here and now.  Death comes when it will, so take <br/>
advantage of the now. <br/>
I have 3 other children and life is moving forward.  We still find <br/>
lots of joy in it.  Our picture is in the photos section here if you <br/>
want to see Sammy, (or any of us).<br/>
I wrote this here because this is the most peaceful and wise list I <br/>
know of.  I want to express my thanks and remind the people who have <br/>
selflessly given of their time and wisdom over the years just how<br/>
important they are.  You changed my life and you helped to make Sams <br/>
life so worthwhile and meaningful and full of joy.<br/>
I wrote this without crying, and am not looking for condolences.<br/>
Just giving thanks and maybe creating some discussion of how lucky we <br/>
all are to unschool.  (and &quot;un&quot; so much of the other crap that isn&#39;t <br/>
REAL in this world)<br/>
