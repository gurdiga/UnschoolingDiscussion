latched onto him and never let go. She never gave him the option, <br/>
LOL, of dating anyone else.... she is nice, but rather controlling <br/>
and they have been together since. For a long time they were in a <br/>
platonic relationship, but they told us when that changed. He had no <br/>
clue how we would react if he had premarital sex when he was living <br/>
at home because he never asked and we never even thought about it! <br/>
He never even dated till he met this gal. He was 20 when they met <br/>
and wham bam they are now together, and that&#39;s fine. He&#39;s 22 for <br/>
crying out loud and can do what he wants. At 17?? No. I don&#39;t think <br/>
most 17 yos are mature enough (and to be totally honest, I don&#39;t <br/>
think this 22 year old is very mature either, but still, he&#39;s &quot;old <br/>
enough&quot; and will mature in time.) But he was always honest with us, <br/>
and we with him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, yeah, and I know that. I could eaily have had sex as a teen <br/>
and my mom would never have known. A close friend of mine had three <br/>
clandestine abortions when we were 17-19. But we ARE honest with our <br/>
children, and forthright about this topic. And they are honest with <br/>
us. So far. I realize that they could sneak around, but the one who <br/>
is CA (he&#39;s 19) I can guarantee has never had sex and doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to till he&#39;s married, and the 16yo at home has truly never had the <br/>
chance. All his overnights (scout camp, activities at church) have <br/>
been well chaperoned. He could get away if he wanted, we don&#39;t tie <br/>
him in the room. He is free to go wherever he wants, really, but has <br/>
no desire to have sex with anyone. We are not dogmatic about our <br/>
beliefs, but we do teach them what we believe and express to them <br/>
that while they are under our roof they need to abide by our rules. <br/>
(Which are very few in number!) And they all have - so far. I&#39;m well <br/>
aware that could change with 4 more reaching those years... but I&#39;m <br/>
not worried about it. We totally disagree with so many in our <br/>
culture that sex is merely an animal instinct that &#39;needs&#39; to be <br/>
satisfied. That&#39;s not how it worked out for either of us, and we <br/>
don&#39;t expect it to be so for our children.<br/>

as long as they are in our home. Even the &quot;now rebellious&quot; one, the <br/>
22 year old, has always respected that.<br/>

&lt;&lt;The rest have not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just wondering how you really know? Because if it were me, and I knew<br/>
someone would take away my driving privileges and not allow me to go to<br/>
college, I would make darn well sure they would never find out. Even if it<br/>
was just once. And I would also wonder what was so taboo about sex that<br/>
would cause anyone to take away something so dear to me? Like driving and<br/>
college. And why sex was okay if I wasn&#39;t living with at home? But I guess<br/>
it&#39;s still not okay, just that there is no control over me. I would want out<br/>
of the house earlier rather than feel like it was a secure place for me.<br/>
That and just being really good and covering my ass. (so to speak)<br/>

I don&#39;t see it as &quot;a lifestyle,&quot; but from your point of view it might be.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They also agree with us that it is morally wrong.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can just declare video games morally wrong too, then, and there won&#39;t be <br/>
any question for you about them or from your kids, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; We do talk about it all the time and they know how we feel about it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t talk about it all the time.<br/>
We talk about it very occasionally, when it seems appropriate for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
The kids ask questions about what they see, read, hear and we discuss it.  <br/>
One of their friends (now a high school senior) has been living with his <br/>
girlfriend for nearly a year (at first with her family).  We&#39;ve discussed the <br/>
limitations, the historical comparisons, the social and financial ramifications, etc.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If they decided to go ahead and have sex, they would lose their driving <br/>
privileges and not be allowed to go to college until they were old enough <br/>
to act mature enough to be trusted. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But if they have sex and just don&#39;t tell you, they can still drive and go to <br/>
college?<br/>
That&#39;s been going on all around us all for years, hasn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s working for you that&#39;s great, but the question of whether video games <br/>
or pierced noses (or whatever all led here) lead to dangerous behaviors, I <br/>
don&#39;t believe it&#39;s true.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting -- I disagree with an &quot;animal instinct&quot; portrayal of sex as well, <br/>
but I still am open to the possibility that my children (when they are older <br/>
teens) may want to have sex.  I think sex can be an amazing gift from God.  I <br/>
think it can take a while to get to the gift part, but sometimes people want <br/>
to open it too early.  That&#39;s okay -- it can still become a gift, though there <br/>
might be some heartache on the way.  As long as they&#39;re mature enough and <br/>
supported enough to stay safe (using protection, etc.), they can survive the <br/>
heartache, learn from it, use it to mature to the point where they can actually <br/>
receive the gift.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m lucky in that I have a pastor that agrees with me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I think that pointing to such examples and saying &quot;see they <br/>

who had such problems didn&#39;t have them because they had the audacity <br/>
(or lack of &quot;morals&quot;) to experiment with sex, they had them because <br/>
they lacked a trusted advisor who could give them important support <br/>
and information.<br/>
And I just can&#39;t believe that teenagers with parents who think that <br/>
premarital sex is absolutely immoral (and that having premarital sex <br/>
indicates a lack of maturity that will result in punishment handed <br/>
down by those parents) feel as &quot;free&quot; to talk about it as you think <br/>
they do.  Free to talk about it so long as they agree and obey, <br/>
mabye, but that&#39;s not truly free.  Perhaps I just have very clear <br/>
memories of being a teenager, but I can assure you that the issues <br/>
my parents took such strong stands on were *not* the issues I felt <br/>
comfortable bringing up in an honest way.  <br/>

Uh, anything IF you want to risk the wrath of their full selves.  My parents <br/>
would have been and WERE the last people I would ever speak to about anything <br/>
regarding sex, love, lust, drugs, drinking, smoking, ANYTHING.  I KNEW were <br/>

about such stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It always makes me suspect of parents who say &quot;my children KNOW they can talk <br/>
to us about anything&quot;  or I KNOW they would NEVER think about such and such.  <br/>
Most likely they would never THINK about getting CAUGHT.<br/>
<br/>
I realize there are other cases when this might be true.  But it sends up BIG <br/>
red flags in my brain.  I never said &quot;my kids can come talk to me about <br/>
ANYTHING&quot;, but surprisingly enough, they always have.  I never pushed but they <br/>
always came forward with whatever they wanted to discuss and believe me I&#39;ve <br/>
sometimes sat having conversations looking very calm on the outside but inside <br/>
thinking very loudly to myself I can NOT believe I am hearing this, stay calm, <br/>
stay calm and LISTEN.  Them talking to me about whatever isn&#39;t something I <br/>
expected, required or even thought of but a natural act when there is not fear of <br/>
repercussions and judgment, something I never had.  <br/>
<br/>
In the absence of feeling judged by ones parents I believe it frees the child <br/>
to truly ask, listen and seek out the parents point of view and advice on <br/>
subjects others might find difficult.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know the 19yo in CA isn&#39;t having sex because of what he is doing <br/>
out there. He is with another fellow 24/7 and they have a job to do <br/>
and that&#39;s what they are doing. If they don&#39;t follow the &quot;rules&quot; they <br/>
get sent home. They CHOOSE to do this with open eyes, so I&#39;m not at <br/>
all worried that he is out there doing anything other than what he is <br/>
supposed to be. And I&#39;m 100% sure sex isn&#39;t involved.<br/>
<br/>
I went on a coed youth trip with my church youth this summer and I <br/>
can assure you athough we traveled 1800 miles by bus, camped and <br/>
stayed at hotels there was no sex. I know you think that&#39;s impossible <br/>
to claim, but with our chaperones and the way we set things up it&#39;s <br/>
impossible. And the kids have to agree to certain behavior before <br/>
they go. If they don&#39;t agree, they don&#39;t have to go! Those who feel <br/>
that they want more &quot;freedoms&quot; don&#39;t come along, and that&#39;s fine. <br/>
It&#39;s not something that is new to them and not something most of them <br/>
have any problem with.<br/>
<br/>
We do feel that sex is a fabulous gift from God and that it is <br/>
designed for the marriage relationship. I felt that way as a teen and <br/>
didn&#39;t mind my parents (mom&#39;s mostly) &quot;strict&quot; rules. As a matter of <br/>
fact, I&#39;m deeply greatful to her for keeping me from experimenting <br/>
around that way. She wasn&#39;t heavy handed, didn&#39;t keep tight reigns on <br/>
me and she talked freely about sex when the subject arose, but I knew <br/>
how she felt and respected that. And that&#39;s what I try to do with my <br/>
children. Not a one of them knows that I would react with removal of <br/>
privilidges if they started fooling around, so that&#39;s not going to <br/>
cause them to hide what they are doing. But they aren&#39;t doing it and <br/>
we&#39;ll cross that bridge if it appears in front of us. Not only do we <br/>
feel strongly about this (and all I&#39;m talking about is that I view <br/>
teen sex as extreme behavior - I don&#39;t mind if you don&#39;t - we all <br/>
have our own views after all) the kids in my home have these concepts <br/>
reinforced at our church - and they are certainly free to disagree <br/>
with the views, and when they are old enough to choose they can do <br/>
what they want. The oldest has chosen to disregard our views and <br/>
lives with his &quot;fiancee&quot;. The next son down has embraced our beliefs <br/>
and is out there doing something else. We love them both. But I would <br/>
not allow my children to knowingly put themselves in danger by having <br/>
sex early without serious consequences. It would be the same if they <br/>
were chasing each other around with knives or guns. I would step in <br/>
and put a stop to it. But I understand that there are those who don&#39;t <br/>
view sex in teens as &quot;extreme&quot;. All I&#39;m saying is that I do.<br/>

times in my recent posts.  He has said to his parents<br/>
recently, &quot;why didn&#39;t you ever TELL me&quot; in regards to<br/>
the consequences of his risky behavior.<br/>
<br/>
They never felt the need to inform him about drugs or<br/>
STDs or any of the other consequences of risky and<br/>
self-destructive behavior (unprotected casual sex,<br/>
drug abuse/use, cigarette smoking, etc.) because they<br/>
always assumed that if they brought him up according<br/>
to their beliefs and kept disciplining him, and didn&#39;t<br/>
let him listen to bad music or watch bad tv or movies,<br/>
or have friends who were not Christians, he would<br/>
never do those things.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps waiting until a child comes to us isn&#39;t the<br/>
best way to help them in some instances.  Supplying<br/>
them with the information they need to know<br/>
beforehand, as the opportunity arises and taking into<br/>
account the child&#39;s situation as well, might be a<br/>
better course.  <br/>
<br/>
Would that be in keeping with unschooling?  To supply<br/>
information that the child might not have thought to<br/>
ask about, but we as adults might know they will need<br/>
to succeed (or be safe)?  If a child starts being<br/>
interested in the opposite sex or mentions that they<br/>
like the taste of beer, or whatever...not in a<br/>
&quot;lesson/lecture&quot; kind of way, but in a conversational<br/>
&quot;have you considered&quot; kind of way?<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m not talking about math facts or spelling, more<br/>
like social information, but that might apply too, if<br/>
the child was frustrated about something and we say,<br/>
&quot;here is something you might not have considered.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I know this boy would have been spared a lot of pain<br/>
and illness and heartache if his parents hadn&#39;t said,<br/>
&quot;Thou Shalt NOT&quot; and instead said, &quot;because you might,<br/>
you need to know what the consequences might be&quot;, and<br/>
instead of saying, &quot;don&#39;t because it is a sin&quot; also<br/>
been more practical and concrete in the reasons given.<br/>

What danger? Will they die if they have sex? You have children so we all know <br/>
it happened.  Making sex look like a dirty secret may just offer you some <br/>
very confused children later in life. <br/>
This topic can fall into some gray areas depending on the ages. <br/>

Did you ban toy guns, tv, certain movies etc. I would like to think its just <br/>
this topic but something is telling me its not. Laura<br/>

I think because there are very few absolute NO&#39;s in my house my children are <br/>
more free to discuss things with me.<br/>
<br/>
Probably those who feel that way have issues that you suggested come up well <br/>
before the child is ready to experiment for themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
In my own personal experience we discussed EVERYTHING in the world around us <br/>
long before it even pertained to the children, just observations about life.<br/>
<br/>
Movies and TV bring up LOTS of opportunities for discussing real life things. <br/>
 When something personally pertains to them (i.e., drugs, alcohol, sex) we&#39;ve <br/>
probably already discussed it in many contexts and it&#39;s not some out there <br/>
abstract unknown whatif type situation.<br/>
<br/>
In the very top of my linen closet is a shoe box.  Inside said shoe box are <br/>
condoms, all varieties, all kinds and even sizes (Internet site that you buy <br/>
them buy the dozens for good prices).  I have not looked inside that box in the <br/>
six years since I put it there.  I have taken the lid off and thrown more <br/>
inside.  Sometimes finding it too full to add.<br/>
<br/>
I also know that other teens who are 19, 20 and sometimes even older visit <br/>
the linen closet before heading back to college.<br/>
<br/>
My children do NOT regal me with tales of the sexual escapades but I do know <br/>
who they&#39;ve had sex with and who they&#39;ve made love with and it&#39;s not because <br/>
I&#39;ve asked, they&#39;ve felt like sharing.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they will come and say they&#39;ve made a mistake by taking a <br/>
relationship to that level, I think it shows maturity to be able to say that.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest boy was sick for a week once at age 16, didn&#39;t want to see his <br/>
girlfriend.  I thought it must be a sickness of the heart.  Finally he confided to <br/>
me that he had &quot;done the deed&quot; and was just sick about it and worried what I <br/>
would think about it. (in regard to it being that particular girl) We talked <br/>
for a long time, he felt better, much better.  He&#39;s 22 now, he&#39;s still with the <br/>
same girl, they live together not far from here, I&#39;m pretty sure he&#39;s having <br/>
sex outside of marriage.  I&#39;ve talked to him about why NOT marry the girl.  <br/>
Makes sense to me if you&#39;ve been with someone since before your 15th birthday <br/>
and you are now 22 and you&#39;ve lived together since you were 18 that marriage <br/>
might be on the horizon or at least an engagement. But apparently not.  I don&#39;t <br/>
love him any less, there are no repercussions, it&#39;s just life.<br/>
<br/>
Same with my older girl.  I could have said if you have sex before marriage I <br/>
am not sending you to college, but WHY would you?  So they either don&#39;t or <br/>
say they haven&#39;t had sex, go off to college where there is no way in the world <br/>
that you can keep those same ground rules for your child and it just opens up <br/>
the avenue to a deceitful relationship.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I have discussed at length loving, committed relationships <br/>
with my children.  I have discussed disease and pregnancy.  I have discussed <br/>
emotional ramifications that are often associated with being sexual with <br/>
someone.  I have discussed that fornication is fornication, whether I have a <br/>
punishment for it or not, whether I see it as right or wrong or not.  I don&#39;t <br/>
necessarily think that my beliefs are their beliefs nor expect that they would follow <br/>
all of mine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Baptist, one child grew up to want to be Catholic, so she went through <br/>
all the classes and is now a practicing Catholic, not because of a spouse who <br/>
wanted her to convert or having children who &quot;must&quot; be raised in the faith, but <br/>
because she chose to embrace that particular religion.  Of course a lot of <br/>
GOOD Baptists would be glad to tell you that Catholics are going to hell... <br/>
apparently I am NOT a good Baptist.<br/>
<br/>
One son wanted to be Jewish in the worst way when he was around the seven to <br/>
nine year old age. (MANY nights of presents appealed to him more than waiting <br/>
the ONE night for Santa) We did lots of research on it, we explored Jewish <br/>
customs and participated with Jewish families, not just at Hanukkah time.  He <br/>
liked the feeling of being special, different I think.  It passed after a while. <br/>
He met a really extreme Jewish family who lobbied the school to have no <br/>
instance of &quot;Christmas&quot; in the building.  No decorating with snowmen, no Santa&#39;s in <br/>
sight, no candy canes even.  He wrongly judged Jewish people on one family <br/>
that was very fanatical and I think it was more about causing a fuss than their <br/>
religion.  He no longer wanted to be Jewish anymore.  So he&#39;s not, not really <br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
My DH&#39;s family thinks it HIGHLY extreme that I ALLOW my 23 year old daughter <br/>
to convert and be a practicing Catholic.  They think it&#39;s wrong that I serve <br/>
wine with dinner, they think a lot of things are extreme and wrong.  Some <br/>
people are like that, whatever it is that THEY don&#39;t approve of, it&#39;s extreme <br/>
behaviour if you do it or &quot;allow&quot; your kids to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Can we ever really &quot;allow&quot; our kids to do things?  I know I&#39;ve said, I&#39;d <br/>
rather they NOT do things, but that doesn&#39;t carry any threat of punishment or <br/>
consequences from me if they choose to go ahead with whatever activity is being <br/>
discussed.<br/>
<br/>
How would one stop one&#39;s child from doing something they didn&#39;t approve of?  <br/>
Do you just tell them so they stop it?  Do you hit them so they stop it?  Do <br/>
you ground them so you can watch every move?  Do you never let them out of your <br/>
sight to do anything outside the home?  Do you call the police?<br/>
<br/>
What does it look like to stop a child from doing something they want to do <br/>
but you do not want them to?  I can understand the mutual respect that would <br/>
cause a child or parent to not do something, but I don&#39;t know how it would look <br/>
to stop a child that truly wanted to do something.  Probably not a pretty <br/>
sight.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  This paragraph really bugs me, especially coming from an unschooler. I thought the basis of unschooling was trust. It has to be. You&#39;re handing your child&#39;s education over to them and trusting them to learn what they need. How can you trust your child, truly, if you&#39;ve already got punishments set up. You don&#39;t need punishmenats if you trust your children to make the right choices. <br/>
   They&#39;re also set up to disobey you. If one has sex, they can&#39;t tell you. It would put their future and freedom at risk. They will have to decieve.<br/>
      And the punishment is so strange. &#39;You haven&#39;t acted maturely so I&#39;m going to make sure you can&#39;t mature any further by keeping you under my thumb.&#39; That&#39;s fine as long as they&#39;re under your thumb, once they&#39;re out and free...What stops them then?<br/>
      Do you trust your own parenting, so that you know they&#39;d make responsible choices about sex? Do you trust that they would come to you if they needed to if it involved sex? <br/>

I&#39;ve talked to him about why NOT marry the girl.  <br/>
Makes sense to me if you&#39;ve been with someone since before your 15th birthday <br/>
and you are now 22 and you&#39;ve lived together since you were 18 that marriage <br/>
might be on the horizon or at least an engagement. But apparently not.  I <br/>
don&#39;t <br/>
love him any less, there are no repercussions, it&#39;s just life.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
*******************************************************<br/>
My little sister is getting married this weekend to a boy she has known for 1 <br/>
year. They have lost their apartment in RI and have moved in with his <br/>
parents.  She is 9 weeks pregnant.  They are getting married NOW because the boys <br/>
parents refuse to let them sleep in the same room or bed.  I have offered her to <br/>
move here she says no. I suspect the same sleeping arrangements will continue <br/>
after they are married also. She says if it does she is leaving him. I have <br/>
tried to talk to her she doesn&#39;t want to listen right now.<br/>
She was raised catholic and went to only catholic schools and daycare&#39;s. She <br/>
is pregnant and planned to be as a rebellion at my Mom.  As soon as she began <br/>
to be attracted to boys and close to sexual encounters my Mom began to treat <br/>
her poorly and later called her horrible names.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 16 she came to me and said she thought she was pregnant. I asked <br/>
for some details and found that she never had intercourse just foreplay. My <br/>
Mom never told her anything! All she knew was that my Mom said no sex bf <br/>
marriage. Laura<br/>

kids (who haven&#39;t hit puberty yet) having sex, I can&#39;t feel <br/>
comfortable with it.  Not sure why, but I definitely feel discomfort! <br/>

&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know how true or valid it is, but condoms have started having<br/>
expiration dates on them.  Six years might be too long.  (Maybe someone here<br/>
knows<br/>
the current info on shelf-life.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Latex condoms, if there is no expiration date should be used within 5 years<br/>
of the manufacturing date. If they have spermacide with them, it&#39;s 2 years.<br/>
And where they are kept makes a difference too. Cool, dry and no sun.<br/>
(before use of course BEG&gt;)<br/>

<br/>
Are you saying that you have these planned punishments of not being allowed<br/>
to drive, and being kept from college, but are keeping them secret from your<br/>
children? That doesn&#39;t seem to be a good way to foster trust. Have you used<br/>
punishments and coercion in the past as a way to enforce certain behaviors?<br/>
Hope they don&#39;t read this list - your secret may be out.<br/>

I&#39;m SURE the original contents are not still there (but just cause you all <br/>
mentioned it, I think I&#39;ll take the box down and check them but maybe not, I DID <br/>
promise to NEVER look inside, one child thought it would be WAY so <br/>
embarrassing if one or the other of them started counting and pointing fingers at some <br/>
point).  I&#39;ve bought and put MANY dozens in that little shoe box over the last <br/>
six years.  There are LOTS of young adults who know about the existence of the <br/>
box and have well utilized it over the years, no questions asked.<br/>

saying.  I think what I was trying to express is that what wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be ok with me is the desperate behavior that some people stereotype <br/>
teens with--having sex all the time as a form of rebellion or need of <br/>
love.  But unschoolers aren&#39;t likely to do anything out of rebellion <br/>
or a need of love, which is really cool. <br/>

You could just ask the kids to check the expiration dates.  Or maybe order a <br/>
new batch and get one of the kids to replace the old ones, but throw them away <br/>
and don&#39;t give them away IF they&#39;re very old.   Then you still haven&#39;t had to <br/>
look in there.<br/>
