<div id="ygrps-yiv-436894827">Have any of you noticed that if your children were in ps and now you <br/>
homeschool, that they are healthier now?  Mine used to catch every <br/>
cold or virus that came along in ps. I have h/s for 2 years now and <br/>
they have been healthy since then.  ~&gt;Chloe</div>
