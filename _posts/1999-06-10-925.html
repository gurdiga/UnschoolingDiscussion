<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880845822">SPECIAL REPRINT - HSLDA  Study:  Embarrassing and Dangerous<br/>
<br/>
A new study of a narrow segment of the homeschooling community was recently<br/>
designed, financed, and promoted by the Home School Legal Defense<br/>
Association (HSLDA). Both common sense and an analysis based on criteria<br/>
used by social scientists show that this study is seriously flawed, but<br/>
most of the report of the study, including its &quot;Summary of Major Findings,&quot;<br/>
says the findings apply to homeschoolers without qualification.<br/>
<br/>
This study has the potential to undermine our homeschooling freedoms by<br/>
presenting a very narrow and limiting stereotype of what a homeschooler<br/>
should be and by providing assistance to critics of homeschooling who want<br/>
to increase the regulation of homeschoolers. Please read this Special<br/>
Reprint, and share it with your friends, support group members, email<br/>
listmembers, and other interested parties. Please note: If you wish to<br/>
share this information with others via your support group or local library<br/>

KEY POINTS<br/>
<br/>
A study of homeschooling families was recently designed, financed, and<br/>
promoted by HSLDA.  However, as homeschoolers, we should not use this<br/>
study, publicize it in our newsletters, or send copies to legislators or<br/>
the media for several reasons.<br/>
<br/>
(1)  The sample used in this study is so narrow and unrepresentative of the<br/>
homeschooling population that its findings can only be applied to the<br/>
homeschoolers who participated in the study.  Despite this fact, most of<br/>
the report of the study, including its &quot;Summary of Major Findings,&quot; says<br/>
the findings apply to homeschoolers without qualification.  The result is<br/>
an inaccurate and dangerous report.  (See Part II.)<br/>
<br/>
(2)  The study undermines our homeschooling freedoms in several ways.<br/>
<br/>
*  The study increases the likelihood that homeschoolers will be required<br/>
to take state-mandated standardized tests.  People who are pushing for<br/>
increased state regulation of homeschoolers can say, &quot;Look.  This study<br/>
shows that homeschoolers don&#39;t mind taking standardized tests required of<br/>
public school students.  So let&#39;s require them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
*  The study measures homeschooling by the standards of conventional<br/>
education:  standardized test scores, money spent on educational materials,<br/>
family income, parents&#39; education, teacher certification, etc.  Most of us<br/>
are homeschooling so we can provide our children and our society with an<br/>
alternative to conventional education.  We do not want to be required to<br/>
use these standards.<br/>
<br/>
*  For additional information, see Part III.<br/>
<br/>
It is hard to believe that this study was designed, financed, and promoted<br/>
by a homeschooling organization, but it&#39;s a fact worth keeping in mind as<br/>
we decide which organizations we will join and support as we continue the<br/>
work we must to do maintain our homeschooling freedoms.  See Part IV.<br/>
