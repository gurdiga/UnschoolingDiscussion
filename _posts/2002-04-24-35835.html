<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989301464">About teaching algebra, we don&#39;t.<br/>
About kids learning algebra, they do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; &gt; I talked<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; her into doing it by calling the math &quot;puzzles to solve.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband is an engineer who has never met a math class he couldn&#39;t ace, or <br/>
a puzzle he couldn&#39;t figure out.<br/>
<br/>
Once we pre-kids we were talking and I said the only math I ever got was the <br/>
the word puzzles, and the laid-out sets of numbers seemed nonsense to me.  I <br/>
could do it and get a good grade, but the teachers couldn&#39;t tell me what it <br/>
was good for, so I quit taking math partway through tenth grade.<br/>
<br/>
I took one math-for-non-majors course in college, and the book was WORDS!  <br/>
Sometimes a little chart of picture, but it told math in words, and I <br/>
understood that.  But I told myself even then that it was just like &quot;math <br/>
appreciation,&quot; as non-musical folks will take music appreciation and get a <br/>
grade basically for knowing a harpsichord from an organ or knowing full <br/>
orchestra from chamber music.<br/>
<br/>
By my husband, who was able to tutor all our friend in calculus and t<br/>
rigonometry, said the word problems were the only &quot;problems&quot; there!  The rest <br/>
were solutions without the calculations having been completed.  He said doing <br/>
an algebra problem that&#39;s already laid out for you isn&#39;t algebra, it&#39;s just <br/>
computations.<br/>
<br/>
So when unschooling came into our lives, what I looked for is &quot;what are the <br/>
math problems?&quot;  And I looked for what algebra looked like in the real world, <br/>
and where division and multiplication came to the surface of the real world, <br/>
and I&#39;ve never worried about my kids as they&#39;ve grown up.  Each has come to a <br/>
point of asking what the mathematical symbols meant,  usually because of a <br/>
computer game like Treasure Math Storm or Outnumbered.    For algebra, <br/>
though, they have concepts learned from allowances (already at a <br/>
rate-per-week, so they add consider other factors in addition to the existing <br/>
&quot;problem&quot;), working at a store AND (byproduct) from everyone in the family <br/>
having had their discount at said store go up from 5% to 30% for Kirby <br/>
working there.  The boys can figure both of those in their heads.<br/>
<br/>
Card games with strategies for different amounts on different kinds of plays <br/>
(Rummy with aces high for 15 or low for 5 pts, Yahtzee, Five Crowns) have <br/>
helped me see them use their mathematical knowledge, and they don&#39;t need a <br/>
pencil and paper, either.  Holly is the quickest of any at mental <br/>
manipulation of numbers.  <br/>
<br/>
My grandfather (same one who taught me &#39;to carry&#39;) used to call it <br/>
&quot;ciphering.&quot;  That refers literally to the marks on the paper--numbers and <br/>
symbols representing other concepts.  And that&#39;s an interesting point here.  <br/>
In school, math is on paper, because teachers need proof for their bosses, <br/>
and for the parents, that children &quot;DID math.&quot;  They have the children <br/>
&quot;cipher.&quot;  But when asked &quot;What is this good for in the real world?&quot;  many <br/>
teachers told me &quot;you need good test scores,&quot; or &quot;you need to pass this test <br/>
so you can take chemistry&quot; or some other TOTALLY school-based answer.  They <br/>
weren&#39;t teaching me math, the greater language of mathematical thinking and t<br/>
heory and the joy of dancing patterns in everyday life.  They were teaching <br/>
me to cipher quickly and obediently, and so I decided math was stupid, and I <br/>
shut that door in me and quit &quot;taking math.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1070514648">Thanks for your insights. I think I understand what you are saying. <br/>
The thing I think I see too is that you knew &quot;rate per week&quot; because<br/>
your husband is very &quot;math minded&quot; and you have had some exposure. <br/>
Sounds to me like he has a very special &quot;gift&quot; in that area and he&#39;s<br/>
passed it on to your daughter! LOL<br/>
Good for them! :O) <br/>
 <br/>
I personally struggled in math as a student. Not because of the lack of<br/>
understanding the purpose, I was the type that figured, well, If they<br/>
are teaching it to me then most likely there IS a purpose for it in the<br/>
future I just haven&#39;t come across it and when I do, I&#39;ll be ready. I<br/>
guess I was easy to get a long with! LOL!<br/>
I am more &quot;literal&quot; than &quot;mathematical,&quot; I can learn math, but it must<br/>
be 3D for me. I also had to learn it in a non-threatening environment,<br/>
like Math Lab at the college. I had a great tutor, he looked funny too<br/>
with dyed orange hair sticking up fuzzy all over his head! Immediately,<br/>
broke the ice! <br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, what&#39;s the difference with playing with cards and playing with a<br/>
pencil and paper?<br/>
My daughter likes the dry erase board. He do the &quot;smartest kid in the<br/>
class.&quot; She made it up.<br/>
She made a medallion that she would push toward me if I worked a formula<br/>
faster than her. She LOVES that. <br/>
She is quite fast too! This isn&#39;t BIG math, just pre-algebra type stuff.<br/>
But it&#39;s her game, she made it up, so we do it. :O)<br/>
 <br/>
But when we go to Wal-Mart and there is a charge for tax, she understand<br/>
the percentage rate, or the surcharge at the commissary and the<br/>
different rates for food verses non consumables. But she knows it<br/>
because we took the time to investigate it. She can now move on to<br/>
something else.<br/>
 <br/>
You or your husband must have invited their attention to the &quot;rate per<br/>
week&quot; idea. How many times do we spend or day inviting our children to<br/>
moral issues? hygiene issues? social issues and news? Maybe we tug their<br/>
hearts with &quot;animal rights&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t be a litterbug.&quot; Most children<br/>
tend to throw trash down on the ground. Not because they intend to harm<br/>
the earth at all, but because they had not yet been enlightened to the<br/>
idea that collectively, throwing down trash is detrimental to the<br/>
environmentand on goes the teaching to them. We teach them to be<br/>
careful when handling the birdie because the bones are so soft and<br/>
delicate. My children didn&#39;t automatically understand that birdie bones<br/>
where so much more fragile than their doggie&#39;s. <br/>
But I enlightened them to it, I personally told them and went so far as<br/>
to discuss other bones with them too, using a Gray&#39;s Anatomy book! :O)<br/>
My hubby is a Corpsman, we have tons of those things laying around.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m saying in short is that whether we use a pencil and paper or a<br/>
game or a video or a book or a natural event, I dont think that it<br/>
always matters. We use common sense right? To decide what the best way<br/>
to teach math would be. They are acceptable ideas even the pencil and<br/>
paper. It too can be acceptable.<br/>
<br/>
I think that making up games or playing games is wonderful.  But I also<br/>
think that using a pencil and paper or markers and dry erase is equally<br/>
wonderful.  I think that there are others here that might agree?<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for letting me share and helping me think through. I didn&#39;t<br/>
proofread this~ Hubby is getting on now!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not too late!  <br/>
I&#39;ve learned lots since, accidently.  And more after I figured out one COULD <br/>
learn accidently, when it could be more conscious.  And I&#39;ve learned real <br/>
math from interacting with my kids who have learned it without a teacher and <br/>
without a book.<br/>
<br/>
If Kirby wants to take SATs or GEDs or something one of these years, we&#39;ll <br/>
get a preparation book, or go to some websites, and when he sees notations he <br/>
doesn&#39;t understand, or terminology he doesn&#39;t understand, it won&#39;t be <br/>
learning from scratch, but just a vocabulary moment for him to know what he&#39;s <br/>
seeing, and what they expect him to do with it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thanks for your insights. I think I understand what you are saying. <br/>
<br/>
The thing I think I see too is that you knew &quot;rate per week&quot; because<br/>
<br/>
your husband is very &quot;math minded&quot; and you have had some exposure.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
Don&#39;t you have an idea that a paycheck is a certain amount per hour, and so a <br/>
40-hour workweek will be a certain amount, but a 50 hour week with overtime <br/>
rate will be the base 40xhourly, plus the ten times hourly-and-a-half?<br/>
<br/>
If a child&#39;s allowance is $7.50 a week (Holly&#39;s is), she gets a good feel for <br/>
what four times $7.50 is without knowing ANY terminology.    And she knew <br/>
what $6.75&#39;s &quot;rate of gain&quot; was without knowing the phrase &quot;rate of gain.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Anyway, what&#39;s the difference with playing with cards and playing with a<br/>
<br/>
pencil and paper?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One is playing, and one MIGHT be playing, or might be &quot;doing schoolwork.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You or your husband must have invited their attention to the &quot;rate per<br/>
<br/>
week&quot; idea. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not our idea.  I don&#39;t use that terminology with the kids--we call it <br/>
&quot;allowance,&quot; but they  have a 75 cents per year of age, per week.  So Holly <br/>
at 10 gets $7.50.  Kirby, at 15, gets $11.25.  He knows his hourly wage at <br/>
work, too, and about how much they take out of it, so when he turns in his <br/>
time sheet, he can estimate what his paycheck will be.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t teach him that.  I did help provide him a happy opportunity to <br/>
figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How many times do we spend or day inviting our children to<br/>
<br/>
moral issues? hygiene issues? social issues and news?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No more than I would with anyone else at the house.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked Holly, &quot;Are you going to need to take a shower before the <br/>
rehearsal?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I honestly don&#39;t know when she last took a shower.  She said she did want to. <br/>
 It&#39;s more for hair-fixing purposes than anything else.  (Come to think of <br/>
it, she played in the bathtub a long time yesterday or Monday night... the <br/>
Barbies are still in there.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Most children tend to throw trash down on the ground. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not in my experience.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve honked at school kids and said &quot;Hey, pick that up!&quot; if they were <br/>
dropping things.<br/>
<br/>
My kids, since they were little, have helped buss tables in restaurants, and <br/>
have helped clean up parks in advance of playgroups.  They&#39;ve never been <br/>
around adults who dropped trash, but have been around lots of adults who have <br/>
spent time picking up other people&#39;s trash.  We do a lot of group camping, <br/>
and the campgrounds are cleaned up before AND after, by volunteers in the <br/>
group (kids and adults, whoever wants to help).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What I&#39;m saying in short is that whether we use a pencil and paper or a<br/>
<br/>
game or a video or a book or a natural event, I don’t think that it<br/>
<br/>
always matters. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It helps to move away from the school model when people are trying to get the <br/>
hang of unschooling.<br/>
