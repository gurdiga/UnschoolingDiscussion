<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542922588">I was reading this quote:<br/>
&quot;One of the first effects of school is to break the bond between parents and children, when the children are five or younger. It breaks bonds between siblings, and replaces them with prejudices about age and grade, with rules against playing with kids of other ages, and with social pressure to be hateful and secretive.&quot; --Sandra Dodd<br/>
<br/>
And it reminded me of when my sister (who was a year and five days younger than me) had to play on the kindergarten playground, while I had to be on the playground for kids grades 1-3.  The playgrounds were literally divided by a big fence.  Recess was at the same time for the different grade levels, so my little sister came to the fence, crying hysterically, putting her arms through the holes to touch me.  I had to stand there and reassure her that we could be together after school and that everything would be okay.  A teacher came over and tried to convince her to leave the fence and to go play and have fun with the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought much about this as an adult until reading that quote.  Children should never have to go through that.  <br/>

Where I went to grade school in Australia, there was fence between the boys&#39;<br/>
and girls&#39; playgrounds.<br/>
<br/>
Later at a different school, the dividing line was between the &quot;Infants&#39;<br/>
School&quot; - Kindergarten, Transition, First Class, Second Class - and Primary<br/>
School - 3rd through 6th. They had their own playgrounds nowhere near each<br/>
other. In fact the classrooms were in different unconnected buildings. The<br/>
High school (7-12) was in yet another part of the school grounds, with the<br/>
Seniors (11 & 12) having their own common room and bathroom on their own<br/>
floor of the main school building.<br/>
<br/>
Supervising the lower grades at morning assembly or lining up after lunch<br/>
was a chore allocated to the prefects.<br/>

--Sandra Dodd<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just yesterday I had a moment of clarity about this, and also related<br/>
to the way that school artificially extends childhood and is<br/>
separated, both in rhetoric and reality, from real life.<br/>
<br/>
Our older son Gabriel (9) was schooled until he was almost 8, when we<br/>
decided to homeschool, and quickly moved into unschooling. Our<br/>
relationship has improved so much since he&#39;s been out of school!<br/>
Yesterday, I was thinking back to when I first sent him to school. It<br/>
was when he was four (and started going to a Montessori pre-school),<br/>
and I was very conflicted about it. I had always done attachment<br/>
parenting, and it was such a break in our lives for him to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
So why did I go through with it? I now think that it was because it<br/>
made me feel like I was more of a &quot;real grown-up&quot;, sending my kid to<br/>
school from 8:30 to 5 so that I could be at work (even though I wasn&#39;t<br/>
at work, I was starting grad school.) But that last phrase shouldn&#39;t<br/>
even be parenthetical, because that&#39;s the heart of the matter. <br/>
<br/>
I had always bought into school being preparation for real life,<br/>
therefore feeling that I wasn&#39;t really living my real life as long as<br/>
I was in school. I got pregnant my last semester in college, and I<br/>
moved in with my parents right after Gabriel was born. I helped out in<br/>
their bakery, so that I could be with Gabriel, and I never went out<br/>
and got that &quot;first job out of college&quot;, thereby initiating me into<br/>
what counts for &quot;real life&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Then when he was three, I applied to and was accepted to graduate<br/>
school. But somehow, in my mind, being in grad school also did not<br/>
count as real life, and being a student again made me feel like I was<br/>
not an adult, although I had been raising my son on my own for four<br/>
years, and doing an okay job of it, I think. So I justified breaking<br/>
bonds with Gabriel in order to make myself feel better and more grown up.<br/>
<br/>
And you know, once they&#39;re in school, so many other things can creep<br/>
in, bedtimes (because they have to get up early), and homework trying<br/>
to make parents take sides with school against their kids, etc. etc.,<br/>
which chips away at the parent-child relationship every day.<br/>
<br/>
I am just so thankful that we re-evaluated our lives, and our<br/>
relationships with our kids, and took Gabriel out of school and will<br/>
never send Raphael.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this post makes at least some sense, as I&#39;ve been interrupted<br/>
many many times by a one-year-old who&#39;s super excited about learning<br/>
to walk...<br/>

<br/>
I have a friend who sent her son to school for K and 1st Grades.  After <br/>
removing him, she talked about what a terrible lifestyle it was and how <br/>
much she didn&#39;t like doing it.  Her summary was &quot;I had to make him get <br/>
up, make him get dressed and go to school.&quot;  Then, after school he was <br/>
engaged with the kids there so, as she said &quot;I had to make him go home; <br/>
make him do his homework and make him go to bed.&quot;  (On top of that his <br/>
dad got home from work every day at 7 or later, which didn&#39;t allow much <br/>
family time.)  And yet lots of people live this lifestyle and accept it <br/>
as normal!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We plan that if we have an appointment at 9, that we need to be <br/>
there at 8:45 - by targeting a time earlier, if we get running 5 <br/>
minutes behind, we still hit the appointment early/on time. We keep <br/>
a list of the month&#39;s activities and appointments (stuff we need to <br/>
be somewhere at a set time for) on the kitchen chalkboard so anyone <br/>
can check what and when and where at any time. We discuss the week <br/>
ahead on Sunday evening. We discuss the next day each evening around <br/>
dinner. We discuss the day&#39;s plans in the morning. Whenever <br/>
possible, we pack up, set out, etc whatever we&#39;ll need in the <br/>
morning the evening before. Sometimes, if we&#39;ve got 10 minutes <br/>
before leaving and we&#39;re just kind of meandering, I&#39;ll set a timer <br/>
to remind myself when we need to get going - note that the 10 <br/>
minutes is until we need to be getting stuff together and heading <br/>
out the door, not when we need to be leaving the driveway. We also <br/>
assume that there&#39;ll be 10 minutes or so worth of stopping at <br/>
traffic lights, stop signs, slow drivers, etc so if it takes 20 <br/>
minutes to drive somewhere, we leave 30 minutes beforehand and add <br/>
another 10 to 15 minutes to arrive early/on time. That way, if we <br/>
are moving slowly or something happens last minute, we&#39;ve got <br/>
leeway. We talk a lot the whole way through - &quot;I&#39;m going to get our <br/>
shoes so we can be ready to leave in 10 minutes&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll help you get <br/>
your shoes on since we&#39;re leaving in 5 minutes&quot;, &quot;Is there anything <br/>
you want to carry along now when we&#39;re leaving?&quot; Arranging things as <br/>
much as possible such that departure coincides with the ending of 15 <br/>
and 30 minute programming blocks (especially in the morning-DS likes <br/>
to &#39;wake up&#39; to familiar TV programs before he really gets going) is <br/>
helpful - no need to tear anyone away from anything (and we&#39;re <br/>
looking into DVR so we can record stuff). DS often finds it helpful <br/>
in making the transition from home to elsewhere by bringing <br/>
something along - a toy, book, some little doodad of some form that <br/>
is a &#39;piece of home&#39; to provide continuity in moving from one <br/>
activity/place/event to another. Something I&#39;ve found important for <br/>
myself is to shower, eat and get myself ready before even waking DS <br/>
(assuming we&#39;re going somewhere first thing in the a.m. which is <br/>
pretty rare except for Sunday mornings). Once I have everything set, <br/>
I can then focus 100% on DS getting ready and out the door and that <br/>
canmake a world of difference. DH goes into his own little <br/>
intersecting orbit and gets himself ready and gets stuff out to the <br/>
vehicle while I concentrate on DS. If it is just DS and DH (DH is <br/>
the at home parent) then (a) we try to avoid anything before 10 am <br/>
(b) we prep DS the night before to know that in the morning x is <br/>
happening at y time (c) we talk about what to expect, what will <br/>
happen, what might happen, what could happen (d) we include him in <br/>
the planning for the morning - perhaps they stop for a donut on the <br/>
way or they plan to get lunch afterward or the decide to go to the <br/>
park or whatever - there have been times when DS has suggested <br/>
stopping at the bookstore after an appointment - that&#39;s a relaxing <br/>
thing for him (and we like it too - we all just take a deep, paper-<br/>
and-print scented breath and relax as we walk in the door). Whatever <br/>
it is, we try to work up a plan that fits as many needs/wants as <br/>
possible. We also limit running around times so if there&#39;s a set <br/>
appointment on Tuesday, there&#39;s nothing else planned for Tuesday <br/>
except whatever free-form stuff gets added. We don&#39;t do back to back <br/>
to back appointment running. I know that in some places, where you <br/>
have to drive an hour to anywhere, that&#39;s just not practical, but it <br/>
works for us. <br/>

didn&#39;t go to Tincher, although I knew lots of kids there. I went to <br/>
Prisk, which is about a mile away. The schools are exactly identical <br/>
duplicates of each other!<br/>
<br/>

There was a HUGE amount of meanness on the playground - I can see, now, <br/>
how just the way it was set up was guaranteed to nurture conflict. Plus <br/>
- we had nothing but a huge big asphalt area to play - you might have <br/>
had some decent trees (since I know you&#39;re a bit younger than I am), <br/>
but the trees were all newly planted sticks &lt;g&gt; when I was there - no <br/>
shade. There was a rectangular grassy area - with no trees - but nobody <br/>
was allowed to PLAY on it.  My school was very very overcrowded and so <br/>
we had bungalows (temporary buildings) that were small and hot and had <br/>
terrible acoustics.  My next door neighbor, a kid named Mikey, burned <br/>
down the bungalow my 6th grade class was in - he was playing with <br/>
matches, I was told. I always hated the bungalows because they shook <br/>
when kids walked around in them - felt like a little earthquake.<br/>

***********************<br/>
By the time I was there we had a few decent trees, and we&#39;d congregate  under <br/>
them and play hand clapping games (remember those?) or &quot;Chinese&quot;  jumprope.  <br/>
I remember the grassy area too...only used for special  occasions.<br/>
 <br/>
I was the type of kid who always stuck up for the underdog, though I was a  <br/>
bit shy and a sort of underdog myself.  I would almost seek out kids  everyone <br/>
else hated and make friends with them.  Though being shy myself, I  was afraid <br/>
to fight or step in if someone threatened them.<br/>
 <br/>
There was one boy, Albert, who was fat, freckled, flaming red hair...he was  <br/>
teased (called Fat Albert) from Kindergarten up until Jr. High (and probably  <br/>
after, we went to different high schools).  When I worked at the Long Beach  <br/>
Police, I was doing filing and ran across his arrest record folder.  He had  a <br/>
bunch of arrests for being under the influence, drunk and disorderly,  etc.  I <br/>
got tears in my eyes and all I could think was &quot;we did this to  him.&quot;  (we, <br/>
meaning his peers.)  While working in PD records, I ran  across many of the <br/>
same sad stories...kids who were harassed, later ending up  with terrible lives.  <br/>
Things like this have cemented my faith in  homeschooling/unschooling.  <br/>

We had them too, though they were just used for stuff like Brownie meetings  <br/>

about 20 little girls in there all trying to talk at the same time.   <br/>
