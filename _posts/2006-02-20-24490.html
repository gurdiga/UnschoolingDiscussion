<div id="ygrps-yiv-677564339">I haven&#39;t posted here in awhile, but I wanted to see if anyone can help with this &quot;situation&quot; we are having. We recently (about 2 months ago) bought a PS2, and my boys were thrilled (age 8). They have gotten many games and have been having lots of fun. Eric is not reading yet, and I think these games are making him frustrated. I am having a hard time figuring out the problem, but I am guessing it is because he has T rated games that require reading in alot of cases. He will ask us to tell him what some things say, but other times he chooses to skip over certain parts, which I think is making it very difficult to beat the games. He was used to playing games on his game boy and beating them.<br/>
<br/>
He has become very sullen and just not the happy kid that I know. He constantly talks about how he wants this game and that game, but then when we get them he plays for awhile and then says they are stupid. He is so on edge that he will not talk about things in a very calm way. This is new ground for me and I am having a hard time. I don&#39;t know how to help him. His new idea is that the PS2 stinks and that now he wants a GameCube. It just keeps changing from new games to new systems to new this and that. He is searching for something but I don&#39;t know what! He has become mean and nasty to us and I know he is hurting,so I desperately want to help him. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas/suggestions/questions to ask myself or Eric?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There is a list for unschooled kids, about games.  Maybe you could  <br/>
join it and read the archives, and then maybe pose your question if  <br/>
you don&#39;t get ideas from that.  If you tell them what kind of games  <br/>
Eric likes that might help.<br/>
<br/>
Also you could look online for a &quot;walkthrough&quot; for the game, and  <br/>
watch him play, see what place it is where he&#39;s stuck, and read just  <br/>
that part of the walkthrough to him.  I did that with Holly when she  <br/>
was playing Harvest Moon but she wasn&#39;t reading yet.<br/>
<br/>

I would talk to him, instead of just guessing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  In general he seems discontent. It just seems like since he started <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So what did you do when you realized it?  What was your response?  Did you <br/>
stop renting games and buying them?  Did you put a limit on how many he can <br/>
have or when he can get a new one?  That would certainly feed a frustration <br/>
to think that you are stuck with this stupid game that you can&#39;t get past <br/>
level 3 on and there is no new game in sight for a while.<br/>
<br/>
You are already making value judgements, just in the words you are choosing <br/>
to use to describe it...as if he is a junkie.  My guess is you weren&#39;t <br/>
really thrilled about getting it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
He is 8 years old, with a brand new gaming system, and he is passionate <br/>
about it right now.  It has only been 2 months.  That is a relatively short <br/>
time for a new system, so he is probably still learning how it works, and <br/>
yes, they do talk about it it a lot and it is where his learning is taking <br/>
place right now.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, a PS2 is more difficult, in my opinion, than a gameboy or a <br/>
game cube or even the XBox.   But I am partial to Nintendo products, so I <br/>
might be biased in my opinion, too.  I have found that GameCube has a <br/>
better selection of games for all ages...plus I adore all things Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, have you played the games yourself?  Have you tried it?  You need <br/>
to really get into his world and his passion.  It is part of unschooling a <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
Have you sat with him while he is playing and encouraged him, brought him <br/>
his favorite snacks, empathized with him when he is frustrated?<br/>

My son also told me to recommend to you cheat codes. It&#39;s not really<br/>
cheating since the makers of the games create them and make them known. He<br/>
says it might make it easier to get through the stages of the game. My son<br/>
completely researches a game before he gets it, cheats and also checking to<br/>
see what gamers rated the games. It&#39;s great research and makes the games<br/>
more enjoyable for him. Maybe you could do it with him and see what you<br/>
find. Gaming is a wonderful asset to a child&#39;s life. He just may need help<br/>
getting started. You can find several cheat websites through Google. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1803305051">Hi Amie, <br/>
   <br/>
  We have an 8 year old &quot;gamer&quot; in our home as well.  He started slowly, needing either dh or I there to read to him (he&#39;s since learned to read), encourage him, or even to help with the games.  He sat and played and played.  Sometimes he became *really* frustrated.  Still does.  <br/>
   <br/>
  That was December of 2004.  We bought him Ty 2:  Bush Rescue on Sunday.  He&#39;s played through to the credits (he&#39;s been through the entire game) three times so far.  This morning though, we spent a good 40 minutes on line looking for a walkthrough then googling this and that for the help he needed.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve become his &quot;Minister of Information&quot;.  I read through the books that come inside the games and offer anything I think might help.  I find and deliver walkthroughs when needed.  I read things on the screen (some games have an option where they can read things to you) and from the walkthrough.  I help him brainstorm.  I listen and ask questions about his game.  We talk about how some games are similar and others stink, how some things are cool, and what we&#39;d change.  On occasion, I&#39;ve heard profanity and explained what the words meant and what profanity is.  In short, I&#39;m there with him as much as he needs me and I am able.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Play the games.  They&#39;re hard!!  I can&#39;t quite get myself past thinking &quot;if I want to jump, I have to press &#39;X&#39;&quot;, rather than just pressing the key, as ds does.  I can ram Spyro (a character from a game) into more walls and miss more jumps than you can count!!  I can also wreak a fair amount of havoc with Sly Cooper (another game character).  It may look easy, but it&#39;s not.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Ask your son questions.  Explain what the walkthrough is.  Offer it to him.  Offer him options for help, if he feels he needs it (try the Yahoo group, ask at the store, the walkthrough, google the part where he&#39;s stuck, feel free to e-mail me and I&#39;ll ask ds!!).  My son didn&#39;t want help until he became more proficient with the controller and not having to think to make a character do this or that.  Unil then, he spent a good part of his day working to master basic functions.  <br/>
<br/>
  Perhaps games which aren&#39;t &quot;T&quot; would be a better bet for him to be able to learn on?  I&#39;m thinking that since the games are geared to teens, perhaps they&#39;re also needing a higher skill set as well??  We have *lots* of games to suggest!!  <br/>
   <br/>
  Hope that helps some!!<br/>
   <br/>
  Happy gaming, :-)<br/>

<br/>
I say:<br/>
<br/>
I have tried talking to him. He gets more frustrated. I have also tried looking up the walkthroughs, and he says it doesn&#39;t help. This is what is frustrating. I keep thinking there is more to his frustration but I can&#39;t figure it out. He is pretty impatient. He wants to beat it right now. He thinks if he can&#39;t beat it within a day or so, then he can&#39;t do it at all. Trying to help him seems to frustrate him more. And, he isn&#39;t asking for my help, so if I offer, it seems to make him mad. I do try to look up the games myself and offer some suggestions, most of the time, he won&#39;t take the help. But maybe I am going about it wrong, that&#39;s what I am trying to figure out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Susan says:<br/>
&lt;What was your response?  Did you stop renting games and buying them?  Did you put a limit on how many he can have or when he can get a new one?  That would certainly feed a frustration to think that you are stuck with this stupid game that you can&#39;t get past level 3 on and there is no new game in sight for a while.<br/>
<br/>
I say:<br/>
<br/>
We did not stop renting games, we were going about every day. However, this was getting a bit expensive. The games are $7 to rent, and he has a brother that wants games too. So, we were spending about $50 a week, which we just can&#39;t continue. But the biggest factor was that he was just not happy with anything, which led to me trying to help him figure out where the frustration was coming from. I felt like I was making it worse by continuing to get new games when he was already so angry and frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Susan said:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;You are already making value judgments, just in the words you are choosing to use to describe it...as if he is a junkie.  My guess is you weren&#39;t really thrilled about getting it in the first place.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I say:<br/>
<br/>
If it sounds like I am making judgments, that is not what I intended. I think you are judging me by telling me I think he is a junkie. That is not true. I am happy to see him so excited about something. However, it seems to be making him unhappy, which makes me want to help. When I can&#39;t help him, it is difficult for me. So, I was merely stating my frustration and sadness that he seems discontent. And, I was thrilled to get it for them. They could choose which system they wanted, and they both voted for the PS2. I didn&#39;t grudgingly take them to the store and say, Ok, if you HAVE TO have this, go ahead, with a big frown on my face. It was done in pure excitement to see them get what they want.<br/>
<br/>
You said:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Have you sat with him while he is playing and encouraged him, brought him his favorite snacks, empathized with him when he is frustrated?&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I say:<br/>
<br/>
Yes, to all of these. What I am saying is, these things don&#39;t seem to be helping. I want him to enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are looking into a GameCube. I am just so hesitant because of the frustration with this. Am I just transferring the frustration to a different system? It is so hard to know what to do. Not to mention the expense. Games are not cheap. We just bought the Guitar Hero for the PS2 less than a week ago, and they are already bored with it. How does everyone else out there deal with the money issue? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887319610">I also think the games on the PS2 are harder.<br/>
   <br/>
  My daughter who is 8 does alot more with the Gamecube than the PS2.<br/>
   <br/>
  My son plays all the games and all the game systems, he  also recommends the Gamecube first, for younger kids.  We bought the PS2 first,  but ended up buying the Gamecube after. :)<br/>
   <br/>
  I would just keep reading with him and just keep voicing his frustration with him, helping him to breathe through it.   It can be soo aggravating to work on some of these for so long and still not conquer it.<br/>
<br/>
  I think you can get the Gamecubes pretty inexpensively now.<br/>

I think I mentioned it before, but if you have a Blockbuster near you he can<br/>
get a Game pass. It&#39;s less than $25 a month and they can switch out the<br/>
games as often as they want. My son switches his games out almost every day,<br/>
sometimes twice a day. We would not be able to afford my son&#39;s gaming<br/>
passion if it wasn&#39;t for the game pass. Also, every one in our family<br/>
(parents included) gets an allotted amount of money to spend every week on<br/>
anything we want. (I guess you could call it an allowance but it&#39;s not tied<br/>
to chores or behavior.)  This is how my son buys games that he wants to<br/>
purchase. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s okay, Amie.  This list is not a &quot;soothe moms and say they&#39;re  <br/>
doing great&quot; list.  If you choose to bring your unschooling concerns  <br/>

you, and they&#39;ll try to help you in ways that would make your  <br/>
relationship with your child better, and your family life better, and  <br/>
help you get unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If it sounds like you&#39;re making judgments from what you wrote, it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter what you intended.  Choose your words carefully and  <br/>
only post what you really mean to say.  It&#39;s hard, but worth it.  And  <br/>
if it doesn&#39;t seem worth it, then please don&#39;t criticize the ideas  <br/>
you get.  Just ignore the ones you don&#39;t like.  Try the ones that  <br/>
seem like they might help.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe read some other people&#39;s accounts of how they moved from  <br/>
frustration to calm, about unschooling.  Or from confusion to  <br/>
excitement.<br/>

-=-We are looking into a GameCube. I am just so hesitant because of  <br/>
the frustration with this. Am I just transferring the frustration to  <br/>
a different system?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You should be able to get a used GameCube AND a bunch of games,  <br/>
probably.<br/>
Used games might be better than rental games anyway, even for the  <br/>
playstation.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How does everyone else out there deal with the money issue? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Breathe.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe in how much you love your children and you want them to  <br/>
experience joy and learning and fun and togetherness, and breathe out  <br/>
that there are only a few years that they&#39;re young.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe in that if they were in school you would HAVE to spend money  <br/>
on supplies, backpacks, special fees, materials, musical instruments  <br/>
or sports equipment,  stylish new clothes, transportation and lunch.   <br/>
Breathe out that all those expenses dissipate when you&#39;re unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Breathe in the knowledge that holding your breath in hesitation and  <br/>
fear only adds hesitation and fear to your lives.  Breathe out peace.<br/>

or gambling, not me.   That is a way of showing how you feel about his <br/>
passion for gaming.  I wonder if you would use the same term if the lad <br/>
wanted more books or jigsaw puzzles.<br/>
<br/>
I was asking all those questions to find out what you have already tried.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&lt;Have you sat with him while he is playing and encouraged him, brought him <br/>
&gt;his favorite snacks, empathized with him when he is frustrated?&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I say:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes, to all of these. What I am saying is, these things don&#39;t seem to be <br/>
&gt;helping. I want him to enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes learning and growing isn&#39;t easy or enjoyable.  Sometimes it is <br/>
frustrating as hell.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s okay, as long as it is they who are choosing to put themselves <br/>
in that position, and are free to walk away themselves.<br/>
<br/>
It took me a while to figure it out, and it was about gaming, too.   My son <br/>
was so frustrated all the time, and angry about it, and he would yell and <br/>
scream and curse that Kirby: Crystal Shards game and snipe at anyone who <br/>
tried to comfort him instead of empathizing with him and validating his <br/>
frustration.<br/>
<br/>
I learned not to try to fix it.  I learned to let it be what it was until <br/>
he asked me to help.  I sat by him, and was just with him, even while he <br/>
was angry about it, and kept trying over and over through his <br/>
tears.    Once in a while I could say, &quot;I know you will eventually figure <br/>
this out, because I watched you figure out the last level, and it was so <br/>
frustrating but you kept trying and did it.  So I know you can do this one, <br/>
too.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And it is okay to say, &quot;I know you are really frustrated by that game, but <br/>
it isn&#39;t okay to take your frustration out on the people around you.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Frustration is okay within reason, but reminding him there are ways  <br/>
to get advice, like discussion lists (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/">http://sandradodd.com/lists/</a> <br/>
other —there&#39;s one on that page), message boards, walk-throughs,  <br/>
players&#39; guides, is also a way to point out gently that the answers  <br/>
are out there, and he is CHOOSING frustration; it&#39;s not inevitable.<br/>
<br/>
But that same overlay applies to unschooling and mindful parenting  <br/>
too.  People can try guessing with no assistance or maps or without  <br/>
finding out what others did, or they can ask.  But when they do ask  <br/>
and people say &quot;Go down the left tunnel, not the right one; the right  <br/>
is a dead end,&quot; it&#39;s pretty pointless for them to keep saying &quot;But my  <br/>
family is a RIGHT tunnel family, and we will eventually get to  <br/>
unschooling that way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

others were chipping in like Christmas and Birthdays.<br/>
We do gamefly.com for games. It is very, very seldom<br/>
that ds actually wants to keep a game after he beats<br/>
it. No overdue fees and if it really sucks or is too<br/>
frustrating for him to deal with he just sends it back<br/>
the next day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171498509">My son will be 8 already next month and we got a PS2 last year so I<br/>
can relate. What I suggest the most is to play WITH him (if he will<br/>
allow it)as much as possible, taking turns on one person games or at<br/>
the same time on two person games. And if he skips the instructions<br/>
then ask him to go back so that you could read them so YOU know what<br/>
to do. Also the cheat codes are a good idea, I make a couple of<br/>
printouts of them when we get a new game so we can refer back to them<br/>
when when we&#39;re playing the game (the computer is upstairs and the PS2<br/>
is downstairs.) My son learned how to spell all of the planets on Star<br/>
Wars (better than me btw) that way. Also perhaps now might be a good<br/>
time to introduce an allowance or a &quot;share of the pie&quot; so to speak<br/>
about how much money you can afford to spend on games, I give my son<br/>
an allowance that is what we can afford and still have money for other<br/>
necessities, but if there is money left over then we can spend it for<br/>
extra stuff or put it away for something bigger later, etc. A great<br/>
time to figure how much stuff costs, how long it will take to save for<br/>
it, etc. That way he&#39;s not going to be begging you for a game if he<br/>
knows you can&#39;t afford it currently. Not that he&#39;s probably not<br/>
getting some math on the video game though, my ds actually figured out<br/>
by himself that if he has 33,000 studs and he wants 50,000 studs to<br/>
unlock a new character then he needs to get 17,000 more studs. Before<br/>
that I had only seen him adding and subtracting to 10, mostly to 6<br/>
from the Hot Wheels Acceleracers game!  Very cool!</div>

arithmetic.<br/>
<br/>
Few parents would discuss ways to discourage kids from &quot;begging&quot; for  <br/>
more math books or spelling books, anyway.<br/>
