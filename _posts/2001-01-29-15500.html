<div id="ygrps-yiv-1022738621">I wish you weren&#39;t leaving NJ Ann!  I have also had the same problem and am<br/>
still looking for a group, although I think that we will end up being loners<br/>
in the end.<br/>

It&#39;s really unfortunate, isn&#39;t it!  There must be so many people keeping to themselves because they aren&#39;t interested/or are overwhelmed in the &quot;only show in town&quot;.  If I had the time and energy, I&#39;d start something myself...oh well... the more leaving becomes real, the more sad I am - I&#39;ve been here my whole life.  This will be a big change!  Ann</div>
