<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018807349">Stepping out of lurkerdom to say hello to everyone and to wish you <br/>
all the best in the New Year!  I must also say thank you, to all of <br/>
you that take the time to post.  This board and unschoolingdotcom <br/>
have been invaluable to myself and my family (though they don&#39;t know <br/>
it).  You all have so much to offer and I love the family photos.  I <br/>
added one too. <br/>
<br/>
I do have a desire to become a regular poster, but right now the lack <br/>
of time(it takes me to long to read all the post) and typing skills <br/>
are a hindrance....I am working on it. :o)<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to hearing more from all of you wonderful <br/>
people.  Your words do make a difference.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
This is one of my favorite unschooling/life quotes<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Kindly let me help you or you will surley drown, said the monkey, <br/>
putting the fish safely in a tree&quot;<br/>
