 </span></blockquote>       I second this endorsement!  And besides spurring thought about the <br/>
true origin of everyday words and being fun to read, &quot;Frindle&quot; plays on some <br/>
strong unschooling themes -- like finding your own voice, standing up for what you <br/>
believe against authority, even against friends and family (and <br/>
realistically, about the price that sometimes must be paid.)  In that way, it&#39;s similar to <br/>
Pam&#39;s movie recommendation of Strictly Ballroom, except with words instead of <br/>
dancing. &lt;g&gt;  JJ<br/>
