original of the toddler issue yet, but saw a response to it.  Yahoo must be <br/>
having indigestion or something.<br/>

<br/>
I stopped receiving all yahoo groups mail some time between Wednesday<br/>
evening and Thursday morning.  I think the problem is with yahoo groups,<br/>
but perhaps only for certain email programs. (I have Earthlink.)  I had<br/>
to go to groups.yahoo.com and fiddle around in &quot;my groups&quot; to fix the<br/>
bouncing problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600259672">Lots of AOL people are complaining on lots of lists that they are not  <br/>
getting all their mail.<br/>
<br/>
You can read on the yahoogroups website, if you have reasonably fast  <br/>
internet access, for group mail.<br/>
<br/>
You can get a hotmail or yahoo account and read from those, if AOL&#39;s  <br/>
problem extends to its own webmail.<br/>

You&#39;re the first person who isn&#39;t on AOL that I&#39;ve heard having <br/>
problems, though. And the others having problems are getting some mail <br/>
- just missing some in between - not missing one whole block of it.   <br/>
So - it COULD be coincidence, I suppose. Life is always so ready to <br/>
throw confounding evidence into the mix &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I think that&#39;s what happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
My purely guesswork theory is that it might have something to do with<br/>
the ads on yahoo groups now being animated.  I hadn&#39;t noticed that<br/>
before, so it seems new.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not too punctual about updating software, so maybe earthlink&#39;s<br/>
bounce problems with yahoo groups, which have happened before, don&#39;t<br/>
affect every version of the software.<br/>
<br/>
(Also, I have my preferences set to &quot;not HTML&quot;.)<br/>
