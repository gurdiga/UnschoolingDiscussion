<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702520337">Handwriting:<br/>
I learned with &quot;ball-stick-bird&quot;.  Where every part of a letter is a circle<br/>
(or part of one), a line, or a v thingy.  It is pretty clear - and it groups<br/>
similar shape letters together, so it&#39;s easier to learn.  My Mom is an<br/>
elementary school teacher, and taught me that way.  I&#39;m pretty sure they<br/>
have a website; I saw it advertized someplace(maybe in HEM).  Now, while I<br/>
know *how* to write neatly, this is not to say that I necessarily bother to!<br/>
 <br/>
Messages:<br/>
I like getting all the messages.  please don&#39;t make them go away.<br/>
*suggestion: if the sheer number of messages is overwhelming, try digest<br/>
form.  they come in blocks of 25 in one email.  in a whole day, I don&#39;t<br/>
usually get more than 6 or 8 from this list, and can scan them quite fast.<br/>
<br/>
Conferences:<br/>
where do I get into on these unschooling conferences, Sandra?  You keep<br/>
mentioning them, and I keep seeing Christian and curriculum ones instead.<br/>
Web sites, or direct info, please.  I&#39;m away from home for 3 months and<br/>
haven&#39;t seen my HEM for ages...boohoo....probably what I need is in one of<br/>
those!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the help, everybody.<br/>
