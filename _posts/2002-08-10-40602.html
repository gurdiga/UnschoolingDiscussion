Subject: Hooked on phonics?<br/>
<br/>
We are contemplating buying Hooked on Phonics for Brittany.  I looked up the <br/>
info. on the official web site & it is $299.99 + 27.50 shipping & handling.  <br/>
YIKES!  Do you know of any other places we could buy it?  If there was a <br/>
store around that sold it at least we could save the shipping & handling.  <br/>
Also, do you know anyone who has used it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try Ebay they are many people trying to sell copies for at least half of that <br/>
new price...I just checked   www.ebay.com   I have bought some used books <br/>
from ebay and got great deals.<br/>
<br/>
I am Jessica from San Diego who would like to &quot;unschool&quot; (I hate the label). <br/>
I have been lurking for at least a month. I have not started any sort of <br/>
school or unschool at home as yet, unless one counts summer and just trying <br/>
to relax, but I am not sending my 12 year old back to public school this <br/>
fall.  After years of arguing with his father,  I have finally succeeded in <br/>
at least having him agree to let me try it at home.  (divorce in progress <br/>
here)  Their father does not trust that I can handle the situation without a <br/>
&quot;facilitator&quot; so I am probably going to sign up for a Charter School, and go <br/>
from there, at least it is in a little different direction.  My son has <br/>
largely lost the joy of learning,  although I see him doing things this <br/>
summer that seem like learning to me...which I would never mention to him.  <br/>
He has never read for pleasure as a for instance.  Maybe that will come, <br/>
maybe it won&#39;t.  I really believe he needs a large break.  I am hoping with <br/>
this charter school that we may be able to choose a &quot;curriculum&quot; and do <br/>
basically what we want, yet documenting it in a way that appears to follow <br/>
said curriculum.<br/>
I have two older sons who went through the PS  system.  My seventeen year old <br/>
is doing fine by most people standards, my twenty year old really would have <br/>
benefited from a completely different situation.  I am feeling very guilty <br/>
for being so complacent for so many years.... and hope I can at least turn my <br/>
youngest&#39;s life around.<br/>
Ideally, I would like to do away with any kind of system at all. I believe <br/>
systems of all kinds are largely a mistake. <br/>
 I have enjoyed most of the posts on the list although some threads have <br/>
gotten a bit tedious for me only because there  are an awful lot of posts to <br/>
read through.  I am currently trying the digest version since I also belong <br/>
to a number of other groups.  At least that way they are somewhat sorted.   I <br/>
have not been offended by anything.  Keep up the great posts.  I thank you <br/>
all for the lively discussions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome Jessica. Label or not, the best part of an unschooling lifestyle is <br/>
that IT ALL COUNTS! The learning continues. The mind keeps on thinking, <br/>
summer breaks and all. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I really believe he needs a large break.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. In homechooling/unschooling circles this break is called <br/>
&quot;deschooling&quot; and is always recommended. I&#39;ve heard the guideline of one <br/>
month for every year of school. Like everything else of course, this is not <br/>
a rule, but a suggestion or guideline based on experience.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While you all deschool, you can also work on forgiving yourself. Lots of us <br/>
have felt the way you do. You&#39;ve done the best you could with the <br/>
information you had. Now you have more information and you&#39;re making <br/>
different choices for your youngest. Try not to let guilt get in the way of <br/>
a joyful today.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524041003">Hi Jessica! My husband and I had the same differences you seem to be having. <br/>
We are divorced now and because of a Judge that favored fathers having their <br/>
kids and vehemently opposing homeschool my ex. got custody. Yuck! <br/>
I don&#39;t know about charter schools... are they umbrella schools?<br/>
Anyway unschooling is a label that not necessarily fits what&#39;s taking place <br/>
but that&#39;s the label for now. Make up another one!<br/>
As for making learning unseen... whatever you son is interesting in, build <br/>
off of that. If he is interested in motorcycles you could ask him to draw <br/>
them, write stories about them with him in the story (even if you have to do <br/>
the writting at first), he could plan a cross country trip for himself on the <br/>
motorcycle equating the distances he must travel...whatever gets things going <br/>
and remaining interested. <br/>
Good luck!   <br/>
