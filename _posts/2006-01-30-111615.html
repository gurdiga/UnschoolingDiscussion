<div id="ygrps-yiv-139433203">&quot;I do think it&#39;s important to listen to your instincts, follow your<br/>
heart and do what you think is right, not what someone else tells you<br/>
to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course.<br/>
I think some people go into adoption or fostering with very<br/>
unrealistic expectations though. If you&#39;re going to choose this, it&#39;s<br/>
good to hear the victories AND failures...there&#39;s plenty of both.<br/>
<br/>
Some families are really suited for adoption and/or foster care.<br/>
Joanne&#39;s is such a fabulous example of a family that is making it work<br/>
beautifully, in spite of their trials. They are an inspiration to many<br/>
I&#39;m sure!:)<br/>
<br/>
But having lived through some pretty massively heartbreaking stuff in<br/>
my family, I feel I owe it to people considering this option to share<br/>
my experience. Each experience is different. But FAS and other issues<br/>
are extremely difficult to deal with, social workers aren&#39;t always up<br/>
front about this stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I have a brother that has used and abused our family, is in prison<br/>
again and absolutely broke my parents hearts. I have a sister that<br/>
does not have custody of her older two children (being raised by her<br/>
ex&#39;s folks) and is now pregnant again and planning to keep this one<br/>
too....she battles alcoholism.  My other adopted sib is a people<br/>
pleaser, draws people into her world that use her and abuse her. Sweet<br/>
as anything, but can&#39;t stand up for herself and has a hard time being<br/>
truthful.<br/>
All of them had a lot of love and nurture. I&#39;m in touch with all of<br/>
them, love them all dearly, but see the pain that has been caused too.<br/>
I don&#39;t believe I&#39;d change a thing....but my parents have said many<br/>
times they would have done it different if they could reverse time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ask Jeremy Strohmeyer&#39;s parents. They adopted him as an infant. They  <br/>
specifically requested that they not be given a child whose birth  <br/>
parents were known to have a history of mental illness.<br/>
<br/>
Jeremy grew up near me - was friends with my nephew and other kids I  <br/>
know. His family was good and warm and loving. When he exhibited  <br/>
signs of mental problems, they took him to counseling. He was  <br/>
referred to a psychiatrist who prescribed amphetamines of some kind.  <br/>
He got addicted to drugs and he got worse and worse.<br/>
<br/>
He murdered a little girl in a casino in Las Vegas.<br/>
<br/>
Turns out his mother was, at the time of the adoption, in a mental  <br/>
institution for severe schizophrenia. She&#39;d been hospitalized for  <br/>
mental illnesses over 60 times. Social workers purposely held back  <br/>
that information.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that anybody knows if his mental illness was inherited  <br/>
- but there is clearly that possibility.<br/>
<br/>
When my sister adopted her daughter, the social workers did NOT give  <br/>
her information about what my niece had been through. My sister  <br/>
slowly got some of it - but she had to piece things together and it  <br/>
was very very difficult to try to help her without knowing her history.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - which reminds me of another reason why unschooling might be  <br/>
problematic - my niece needed constant supervision and she was  <br/>
exhausting. My sister needed time away from her far more than most  <br/>
moms need time away from their kids. Something else to consider.<br/>
