&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;        What I mean is that if a belief is used as a way to decide what <br/>
&gt; &gt; others<br/>
&gt; &gt; should do or to judge others as right or wrong, then it&#39;s not really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;personal,&quot; at least not in the same sense of beliefs that are really <br/>
&gt; &gt; only about my own life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Unless the context is something like, &quot;I think it is wrong to try to <br/>
&gt; force children to learn something they have no interest in learning.&quot; <br/>
&gt; That means I think that it is generally wrong - for anybody. It has <br/>
&gt; personal application, in that I won&#39;t do it to my kids, but I do think <br/>
&gt; it is wrong for others too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thinking it is wrong doesn&#39;t mean I necessarily have any intention of <br/>
&gt; insisting on anybody else acting on my belief, of course. On the other <br/>
&gt; hand, there are some things I think are wrong enough that I&#39;ll try to <br/>
&gt; persuade people to come around to seeing it my way and there are other <br/>
&gt; beliefs that I hold strongly enough that I want to see them imposed on <br/>
&gt; everybody. (Like not blasting their music at high volumes at <br/>
&gt; campgrounds, for example &lt;G&gt;.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;    To me any truly personal belief in personal choice or <br/>
&gt; &gt; self-determination<br/>
&gt; &gt; -- like unschooling for example -- cannot rest on religious doctrine <br/>
&gt; &gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; political proclamations of what all children and parents should <br/>
&gt; &gt; believe or do, or  even what all unschoolers should believe or do.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; It sounds like you&#39;re saying that no general statements can be made <br/>
&gt; about unschooling, but I doubt that is what you meant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - I&#39;m clearly not following your point, JJ. The kinds of statements <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m thinking of, about unschooling, are not religious or political. <br/>
&gt; What am I missing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And - welcome!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>       Hmmm. It seemed very clear to me until you asked! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
       First of all, I was musing only about the beliefs themselves, not <br/>
about whether one acts on them through persuasion or advocacy, or stoning! LOL.  <br/>
<br/>
        You&#39;re right that I didn&#39;t mean no general statements can be made! I <br/>
meant only that that there are different &quot;kinds&quot; of personal beliefs and also <br/>
that claiming a belief as &quot;personal&quot; doesn&#39;t confer immunity from all <br/>
challenge. I thought Sandra and others did a good job of making this point. I was <br/>
agreeing with it.<br/>
<br/>
       I do see the facts-evidence-theory kind of belief and the personal <br/>
preference kind of belief as both being different in some sense from personal <br/>
religious and political beliefs. And unschooling beliefs could be any or all of <br/>
these, yes?<br/>
<br/>
       For example, I&#39;m guessing that your statement about it being wrong to <br/>
force children to learn involves several types of belief, maybe religious plus <br/>
practical plus a personal gut-type preference and also reasoning and <br/>
knowledge, based on lots of facts-evidence-theory that you and I might enjoy writing a <br/>
whole book about. When we were done, it certainly would reflect and be <br/>
congruent with our personal beliefs, but it would be much more than &quot;just&quot; a <br/>
write-up of our own personal beliefs or preferences.<br/>
<br/>
    As to the &quot;no loud music at campgrounds&quot; &lt;g&gt; well, there are different <br/>
ways of looking at that &quot;belief&quot; (maybe religious or political even -- let&#39;s say <br/>
some sect or campaign wanted to have a huge tent revival at your favorite <br/>
public spot over your mother-daughter back-to-nature weekend? Ack!  --)  The jet <br/>
ski people merrily destroy pristine federal parks and preserves with their <br/>
noise pollution, and in my town we have a beautiful lake where the whine of <br/>
recreational airboats disturbs regular residents (not just campers) for miles <br/>
around.<br/>
 <br/>
     My belief that all this is &quot;wrong&quot; is I guess social, or perhaps civil.  <br/>
But having said all this, I am not sure WHY I said any of it. Maybe someone <br/>
will make more sense of it than I just did!  :)  JJ  <br/>
