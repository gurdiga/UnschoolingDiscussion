<div id="ygrps-yiv-351617485">&lt;&lt; I found out that I love<br/>
broccoli! And squash and quite a few others. Wish I had figured it<br/>
out when I was younger.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of that is probably just that things taste different as we get older.  <br/>
When we&#39;re talking about liking or not liking food here, I try never to say <br/>
&quot;Marty doesn&#39;t like spaghetti.&quot;  I&#39;ll say &quot;Marty doesn&#39;t like spaghetti as <br/>
much as he likes just the sauce and garlic bread,&quot; or if a kid says &quot;I don&#39;t <br/>
like orange juice, I might say &quot;You might when you&#39;re older.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always said &quot;I didn&#39;t like that either when I was little, but when I <br/>
was a teenager I did,&quot; or &quot;I used to like Pixie Sticks (or whatever) when I <br/>
was little too, but when I got older it seemed just too sweet and yucky.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same old recommendation of simple honest communication which doesn&#39;t shut out <br/>
any part of future possibilities and tries not to make the kids feel wrong or <br/>
bad about current preferences.<br/>

a kid, especially when he hears that I felt the same way. Jason actually is <br/>
pretty open to trying things, probably because he has always been able to say<br/>
no. He just honestly does not like that much! I was an extremely picky kid <br/>
(still am to a point) and had to have lots of conversations with Jeff to get <br/>
him to understand that you can not force a kid to eat. Although I think<br/>
that sometimes Jason even has me beat (he has decided that the whole wheat<br/>
bread that we have been eating for years now &quot;smells like mint&quot; and does<br/>
not want his pb&j anymore (and no, he does not like white bread either!).<br/>
This was the staple of his diet, so I am on the search for a new brand that<br/>
he will eat...geesh! I gotta love this kid...) <br/>
<br/>
Funny, this is one area where I have actually told my mom that she did it wrong<br/>
(in a very nice way though!). We have had lots of talks about it and I realize <br/>
now that she was after the short term goal of getting nutritious food into me <br/>
(she had 2 great-aunts who had hump backs (I am assuming scoliosis) and her mom <br/>
told her it was from poor nutrition). My perspective is that I doubt the few <br/>
spoonfuls of veggies I swallowed really benefited me that much and it really <br/>
turned me off to trying new foods.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that I did do was to restrict sweets. Which I now do not. :o)<br/>
And we are definitely in the binging phase. I just keep telling myself that<br/>
this is to be expected and that they will eventually want to eat some healthy<br/>
food again. Interesting thing is that Jason has told me the last two nights<br/>
that his tummy did not feel good...we backtracked over what he had eaten the<br/>
last couple of days (pretty much living on goldfish, soda, fruit chews, smarties,<br/>
chips and gum). Today he asked for a grilled cheese and some blueberries (in addition<br/>
to all the junk) so we are making progress LOL! It&#39;s only been a couple of days<br/>
of binging, so I still have hope.... :o)<br/>

<br/>
Two of those things... well not quite.<br/>
Wait.<br/>
<br/>
By my &quot;sick bed&quot; (the couch in the den) I have some serve-yourself foods.  <br/>
Goldfish crackers<br/>
fruit bars (like big fig newtons)<br/>
fig newtons<br/>
granola bars<br/>
cashews<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pining for some jerkey Kelly Lovejoy brought me in the hospital but which <br/>
I handed back because of nausea.  It might arrive in my box of shipped stuff. <br/>
 I&#39;m hoping.  <br/>
<br/>
Letting my kids get used to sleeping until noon is okay, but when it&#39;s 8:30 <br/>
in the morning and the food is where I can&#39;t get, I wish I had more choices.  <br/>
Maybe I  need a cooler by the couch. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
yesterday morning Holly brought me a piece of toast with Muenster cheese <br/>
melted on it and it was wonderful.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to take food with the meds.  I&#39;m getting tired of dry carbohydrate <br/>
food.  And this morning all I have is half a bottle of water.  Other days <br/>
I&#39;ve had cranberry juice or cherry juice.<br/>
<br/>
So all of you who can walk to the fridge or drive to the store, think of me <br/>
when you&#39;re drinking something good today.<br/>
<br/>
And those who are afraid for your kids to cook, I share that fear of spilling <br/>
hot liquid.  I wouldn&#39;t encourage it.  But I&#39;m glad my kids can use a <br/>
microwave and a toaster so I will get SOME food today.  Later, after noon.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra the temporarily hungry.  But I CAN reach goldfish and water.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318773003">Good job Stephanie!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m at the same step, my kids are getting over the binging now, but now we are the candy house for the rest of the neighborhood!  <br/>
So this ought to be interesting.<br/>
Other kids walk in our door and first words out of their mouth, can I have a treat?<br/>
My 5dd this a.m. chose bagel with strawberry cream cheese and ghetost(norwegian goat cheese).  Hmmmm, I&#39;m first thinking, OK?  And she loved it, I have to watch what I say and watch my reactions!<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

LOL!!!! Hang in there Stephanie. I can only speak for us here. We have never <br/>
had restrictions on food, even for my first. Hey, at least I did something <br/>
right with her!!! And my kids, well actually my husband and I too, have days <br/>
when we feel like &quot;stuff&quot; and not &quot;real&quot; food. Can&#39;t say how long it will <br/>
take once the restrictions are lifted, but for us, it&#39;s an ongoing thing. <br/>
What keeps me grounded is looking at a month and seeing that all of us do <br/>
eat pretty well. Not meaning quantity but quality, at least for us! &lt;BG&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532255820">It really didn&#39;t take long,  My son still will asks if he can have stuff and I say yes and then most of the time he says, &quot;oh,  I guess I don&#39;t really want any.&quot;  So for him its a control thing,  I put it in his court and he&#39;ll decide he doesn&#39;t want it.  He has binged (with his dad)  on potato chips while watching sports or things, but it is never more than maybe a half bag or maybe a couple of cups.  Then next time he eats less.<br/>
