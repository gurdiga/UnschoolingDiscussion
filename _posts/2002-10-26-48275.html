<div id="ygrps-yiv-878477935">Ugh! I can&#39;t believe I am going to post this, but here goes. <br/>
<br/>
Usually, amongst adults saying Thank you is not something that needs <br/>
reminded. But I heard something today, (I don&#39;t think I need to say exactly <br/>
what) that really upset me. Some of you will know what I am talking about, <br/>
and others will think I am just rambling along, but that doesn&#39;t matter. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When you are in need of help and someone helps you out, out of the kindness <br/>
of their heart or just because, and they don&#39;t expect anything in return, <br/>
(and even if they do) remember to say Thank You. There are times in our lives <br/>
when things don&#39;t always go right. Sometimes we are hurt, sometimes we are <br/>
poor, or just in need for some reason. Most times people will reach out. <br/>
Sometimes we have to ask, sometimes we don&#39;t. Did someone just carry your <br/>
groceries, lend you money, take care of your kids, pay your way somewhere, <br/>
hold a door open, pay your electric bill, fix your broken fan belt, sit and <br/>
talk with you, make dinners for your family for a week? Regardless, if you <br/>
are ever helped out just remember to say Thank You. You could send them a <br/>
nice note, bake them some banana bread, when you are able do something in <br/>
return for them, or just say Thank You. Because it really matters. <br/>

*Your right Nancy it does.  I don&#39;t tend to dwell on people who are impolite<br/>
or maybe just unaware.  But I did send someone on this list a book on my dime<br/>
and haven&#39;t heard a word since.  I just hope she&#39;s ok and enjoying the book. <br/>
Thank you does make you feel good though and is an easy way to encourage<br/>
people to be generous.*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628894513">The whole book thing reminded me that I was going to buy a copy of Rachel <br/>
Anns &quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot; and then I  forgot and asked for her <br/>
address a second time and STILL forgot because I went to the conference.!!! <br/>
Sheesh.<br/>
If you don&#39;t think I&#39;m totally bonkers Rachel, I&#39;d still like to buy it.<br/>
Do you still have it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, see and I didn&#39;t even make that point! And what a good one. Because if <br/>
you do something nice for me and I say thank you, then the next person who <br/>
comes across your path, in need, gets helped too. But if I never said a word <br/>
to you, then the next Joe just gets blown off. Because you feel it really <br/>
isn&#39;t worth it anyway. And it is my opinion that if all it takes is a Thank <br/>
You to keep kindness and helpfulness going, then a Thank You must be worth a <br/>
lot! <br/>

I don&#39;t always send thank-you notes when I should.  I had some things I <br/>
needed to write thank-yous for, three addressed piled on a table a month ago, <br/>
before I went to the Houston conference.  But now I&#39;m unable to get to that <br/>
room, and it&#39;s going to be cleaned up (not by me) for Holly&#39;s birthday party, <br/>
and by the time I find those notes will those people have had their desire to <br/>
be generous totally extinguished?  Gosh, I hope not.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t personally do things for thank-you notes.  It doesn&#39;t hurt my <br/>
feelings when I don&#39;t get one.  Those who consistently and unfailingly write <br/>
thank-you notes are better people than I am.  But still I try to be generous <br/>
with my time and my things.  <br/>

toddlers are certainly more interested in teh computer at the moment <br/>
listening to me try and type fast so I can get the thoughts down and <br/>
posted.  lol  I am going to try and find some boo bahs or something <br/>
on here that trinity and epiphany like.  They love to point and <br/>
click, though they don&#39;t do good for my typing lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181044744">This is just a thank you to Tuckervill, Sandra, Pam, Joyce and others <br/>
who through their words or actions over the years have helped me have a <br/>
relationship with my 13yr old son that would allow him to cry like a <br/>
baby in front of me at the death of a very beloved pet. He has such a <br/>
tender heart.  I can tell you that I know a number of boys who would <br/>
never show that kind of &quot;weakness&quot; in front of their mom or dad.<br/>
So tonight as General Boo lay dying in my arms my son was able to share <br/>
his feelings and tears with me without feeling ashamed of them.<br/>
So here&#39;s a slightly drunk and weepy thanks.<br/>
if you want to see pics of The General I put some on my blog.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570029885">Aww, Julie.  I&#39;m so sorry General Boo died.  He was a pretty  kitty, and I <br/>
know he had a good life with you and Josh.<br/>
 <br/>
Will&#39;s last hermit crab died yesterday, too.  Hardy the Hermit Crab  from <br/>
Hawaii was the first one we got, in June, 2004.  We got him some  friends, too, <br/>
and happily painted shells to molt into.  His friends  all passed away one by <br/>
one, and we decided Hardy would have to live a solitary  life.  It was a long <br/>
one for a hermit crab, I think.<br/>
 <br/>
Will was very excited to take care of him at first, but I did have to give  <br/>
him gentle reminders to change the water and put out fresh food, etc., after a  <br/>
few months.  One day, while we were getting ready to go on a trip, I  <br/>
distractedly stuck my head in the living room and said, &quot;Will, have you talked  to <br/>
Hardy today?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Without missing a beat he said, &quot;I tried, but he didn&#39;t want to  talk.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
We all laughed hard and that broke my busy-ness tension, and from then on,  <br/>
the gentle reminders came in the form of the same question.  Or, &quot;What did  <br/>
Hardy have to say today?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Will didn&#39;t cry yesterday, although he felt really bad.  He felt  guilty that <br/>
he had been neglecting to play with Hardy and keep his habitat as  clean as <br/>
in the beginning.  He was consoled by the thought that Hardy lived  so long, so <br/>
Will must have been doing something right for him.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m glad Josh felt free to cry through his grief.  Will&#39;s not crying  much <br/>
these days, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a problem.  When he came home to  tell me <br/>
about the Star Wars movie, he said, &quot;It was really sad.  Even *I*  almost cried.&quot; <br/>
 lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-745522515">Keith and Pam for resonding to my questions about Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It is helpful to gain as much knowledge as I can, so I can put my husbands mind at ease.(As well as my own).<br/>
<br/>
I have ordered Sandra&#39;s new book and I am anxiously awaiting for its arrival.<br/>
<br/>
Much of what you said makes perfect sense. I do know that what we have been doing must be working, since she learned many of the things now, on her own, by pursuing her interests. Especially the reading aspect of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all once again. I am sure I will have more questions as I go along.<br/>
