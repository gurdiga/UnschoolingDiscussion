&gt; I wanted to get some for Satori the last trip to the<br/>
&gt; library cuz he said he wanted a detective book, and it<br/>
&gt; showed up on the computer catalog thingy but they were<br/>
&gt; nowhere to be found. :( I&#39;m not giving up though. I<br/>
&gt; sold all mine a while back. My favorite was &quot;The Happy<br/>
&gt; Valley Mystery&quot; and &quot;The Mystery of the Midnight<br/>
&gt; Marauder&quot; or soemthing like that. I aspired to be a<br/>
&gt; detective when I was younger...still have a bit in me,<br/>
&gt; I think. Harriet the Spy to the core. I was all about<br/>
&gt; secret spy clubs (even made up membership cards), and<br/>
&gt; codes and codecracking and spy tools you could make<br/>
&gt; from kleenex boxes, etc...I think I may just be so<br/>
&gt; intent on looking for Trixie Belden books so *I* can<br/>
&gt; read them again. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83353933">woo hoo! I&#39;m envious! Did you find anything<br/>
&quot;suspicious&quot;??? I always was so SURE I had uncovered<br/>
these HUGE crime rings. My parents had to talk me out<br/>
of putting myself in some probably dangerous<br/>
situations all the time. :) Have you seen the Harriet<br/>
the Spy movie? I love it. My kids love it too.  <br/>
