 FAMILY="SERIF">I feel frustrated that my efforts to take a step out and feel 
  for people like <br>Laura and to comment on our being a welcoming as well as 
  an informational <br>list have been met with rather uncaring replies by a 
  couple of people. &nbsp;Why <br>do things have to be said so harshly. &nbsp;I 
  see a lot of compassionate, <br>insightful responding going on, but the other 
  stuff is ruining it for me. &nbsp;I <br>don&#39;t understand why we can&#39;t show a 
  little diplomacy. After all, we are all <br>supposed to have a few things in 
  common here. &nbsp; <br><br>When i try to speak up for fostering a positive 
  attitude on the list and i <br>only get negative feedback, I find it very 
  discouraging. I have never <br>encountered such rudeness tolerated so well on 
  a list. <br><br>cath</font>&nbsp;<br></font></div>
  <div><font face="arial,helvetica">I&#39;ve been thinking about this subject as 
  well.&nbsp; I&#39;m on several lists, and they all have their own personality or 
  attitude.&nbsp; Personally I try to keep to the rules of each list, written or 
  unwritten.&nbsp; For example, one list I&#39;m on does effusive welcomes for 
  everyone who writes an intro, sometimes 15 or more replies.&nbsp; Then you get 
  15 thank yous, needless to say it&#39;s an active list, generating up to 300 posts 
  a day!&nbsp; Then I&#39;m on a list where they threaten to kick you off if you 
  write anything not strictly on-topic, and warm personal posts are most 
  discouraged to keep the list to a manageable size, they generate 25-40 posts a 
  day.&nbsp; Another list runs hot &amp; cold, just depending on the mood of the 
  core group, they often totally ignore newcomers and long time members alike, 
  but they can also be incredibly supportive, and people are very candid, often 
  writing heartfelt , and very personal posts of a spiritual nature.&nbsp; 
  Anyway you get my point.&nbsp; </font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial"></font>&nbsp;</div>
  <div><font face="Arial">I don&#39;t have any answers,&nbsp;I just think it depends 
  on what is going on, on any given day, and that can be unfortunate for a new 
  member who signs on , on an &#39;off&#39; day.&nbsp; Then again the list with 300 
  posts a day has people complaining and signing off all the time due to being 
  overwhelmed with mail.&nbsp; Personally there are times I am just unable to 
  post, sometimes for weeks at a&nbsp; time, otherwise I try to reply when I 
  have something that I &#39;have&#39; to say, or else if I think I can be of help to 
  someone.&nbsp; I try not to say something if it&#39;s already been said, 
  especially if it&#39;s been said so much better than I could have put it, which is 
  often on this list!&nbsp; Other times I send a personal reply when I just want 
  to say thanks, or me too!&nbsp; But like I said, all too often I just don&#39;t 
  have the chance to always respond, even when I am in total agreement or really 
  moved, then I just send out a silent reply &amp; hope others will have a 
  chance to put words in writing- this is obviously an imperfect 
  system.</font></div>
  <div><font face="Arial">And I have seen lists where people can be frighteningly 
  rude, my personal feeling is that it&#39;s better not to engage such people, but I 
  do agree there are times when it is right to come to another&#39;s defense, at 
  times it&#39;s difficult to do this without fueling the flames.&nbsp; Ultimately 
  it&#39;s up to any and all of us to make this list what we want it to be.&nbsp; If 
  we want it to be more welcoming than that is something than can be done on an 
  individual basis, and maybe the feeling will spread.&nbsp; We all look for 
  different things from these lists, and we all have unique qualities to offer, 
  anyway once again today, that&#39;s my opinion.</font></div>

Myranda,<br/>
I&#39;m wondering exactly what posts you considered flames or attacks.  Could you give me a quote or an example?  Mabye I&#39;m just dense, but I&#39;m guessing what you perceive as an &quot;attack&quot; others perceive as honest and to the point.  You also mentioned something about being disappointed about namecalling.  Who&#39;s calling anyone names?  You don&#39;t need to answer that, but if you think about it, much of this namecalling, attacking, twisting words, etc, might just be in your own perception.  If that&#39;s so, then you might want to look more closely at your reactions to these so called &quot;attacking&quot; posts to find out what exactly is bugging you so much.<br/>

I know from personal experience that having a major paradigm shift can be painful and cause much defensiveness.<br/>

  Myranda,<br/>
  I&#39;m wondering exactly what posts you considered flames or attacks. <br/>
<br/>
  ** Flaming is when the poster is criticized instead of the topic. Since spanking is so popular right now, take it as an example. People posting about it have been called sick, dumbasses, abusers, and more. That&#39;s flaming. On most lists, that would get you banned. Attacking is all of the &quot;how dare you&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re wrong&quot;, &quot;you are harming your kids&quot;, &quot;you&#39;re abusing your kids&quot;, etc comments. Also grounds for banning on almost all lists. <br/>
<br/>
   Could you give me a quote or an example? <br/>
<br/>
  ** Sorry, I don&#39;t keep posts so I can&#39;t quote but I&#39;m sure you can recall some with the same and like examples I listed above. <br/>
<br/>
   Mabye I&#39;m just dense, but I&#39;m guessing what you perceive as an &quot;attack&quot; others perceive as honest and to the point. <br/>
<br/>
  ** No, I&#39;ve been on busy mailing lists for about 5 years now, and have started several myself. Those are generally accpeted and known mailing-list definitions of the words flaming and attacking. Being honest and to the point would include &quot;spanking is harmful and this is why...&quot; while attacking/flaming includes &quot;spanking is wrong, you are wrong, you are an abuser, you&#39;re sick&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
   You also mentioned something about being disappointed about namecalling.  Who&#39;s calling anyone names?  You don&#39;t need to answer that, but if you think about it, much of this namecalling, attacking, twisting words, etc, might just be in your own perception. <br/>
<br/>
  ** Again, no. For one, I have had many, many offlist e-mails assuring me this is not in my imagination. Moderator Joyce even noticed and commented onlist on the twisting and misquoting that was going on. For another, I have seen this same spanking issue come up on many different lists, and it has been gotten thru, the same points gotten across, without all of the flaming going on. It&#39;s a huge, noticable difference that no one could miss. If you guys are used to this list, and this list only, you probably don&#39;t notice the difference as much.<br/>
<br/>
  Take the recent post from the &quot;spanker&quot;. Several people boo&#39;d her and several flamed her. WHY didn&#39;t anyone post links showing the harm it causes children or ask her if she would consider trying another method if she had help and support to do so? Like what has been mentioned time and time again, even if the original poster isn&#39;t interested or doesn&#39;t respond, someone may very well come along and read the posts later and it may help them. Or it may help people lurking. Instead, the flames and attacks are all the people will see. How sad is that? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   If that&#39;s so, then you might want to look more closely at your reactions to these so called &quot;attacking&quot; posts to find out what exactly is bugging you so much.<br/>
<br/>
  ** I know exactly what bugs me. It is that on a list that is so about treating children respectfully, a lot of people are really close-minded about giving adults respect. It is very hard for me to believe that adults who cannot keep tempers and a respectful tone on their computers while getting their point across, can turn to their families and show a respectful attitude towards them when something comes up that they do not agree with. Personalities come through online, sometimes more than people realize.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I know from personal experience that having a major paradigm shift can be painful and cause much defensiveness.<br/>
<br/>
  Patti<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  ** Then you should be able to understand that people who are going through or starting to go through a paradigm shift need help and support from friends, not attacks and flames from enemies. <br/>

<br/>
Hmmm.  I don&#39;t see much difference between &quot;spanking is harmful&quot; and &quot;spanking is wrong.&quot;  And I haven&#39;t noticed the &quot;you are sick&quot; or &quot;you are an abuser&quot; comments.  I think, though, that attacking the idea of spanking, which many here have certainly done (me included) can easily be construed by a spanker (or someone who supports spankers) as an attack on their person. <br/>
<br/>
***Take the recent post from the &quot;spanker&quot;. Several people boo&#39;d her and several<br/>
flamed her. WHY didn&#39;t anyone post links showing the harm it causes children or<br/>

to do so?***<br/>
<br/>
I recommended a specific book and I pointed out that there were other resources for Christian parents who didn&#39;t want to spank if they were open to finding them.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s probably unrealistic for anyone to post on a list like this (where respect for children is at the core of everything discussed) about spanking being a great thing and *not* expect some flames in response.  It&#39;s kind of like joining a vegan list and then cheerfully posting about how you roast a lamb on a spit every night.  <br/>
<br/>
*** I know exactly what bugs me. It is that on a list that is so about<br/>
treating children respectfully, a lot of people are really close-minded about<br/>
giving adults respect.***<br/>
<br/>
The fact is that I don&#39;t respect everyone equally even though it seems the politically correct thing to do.  I can respect that some people have more limited experience than others, or that some people believe their religion tells them to hurt their children regularly, that there are many variables that go into the choices we make as parents, and even that most of us do the best we can most of the time with the tools we have at the moment.  That&#39;s not the same thing as saying &quot;all ideas are equally wonderful, hitting your kids is just fine if that&#39;s your choice, whatever works for your family&quot; etc.  I just don&#39;t buy that.    <br/>
<br/>
***It is very hard for me to believe that adults who cannot<br/>
keep tempers and a respectful tone on their computers while getting their point<br/>
across, can turn to their families and show a respectful attitude towards them<br/>
when something comes up that they do not agree with.***<br/>
<br/>
I personally prefer authentic communication, even when emotions run high.  I definitely prefer it over polite posts about beating one&#39;s children into submission.<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t respect an adult who is being cruel to a child.<br/>
It would make me a lesser person if I aided and encouraged them to continue <br/>
doing that.<br/>
<br/>
I want them to treat their children with respect.  I&#39;ve put a lot of energy <br/>
into providing tools and ideas for them to do that.  So have many others on <br/>
this list.<br/>
<br/>
-=- ** Then you should be able to understand that people who are going <br/>

<br/>
There are many people here going through paradigm shifts.  You have assured <br/>
us you are not one of them.   You&#39;ve repeatedly told us what you&#39;re doing is <br/>
right and good, and that all our advice you&#39;d seen half a dozen times before.<br/>
<br/>
So those people who ARE coming here to consider new and different ideas don&#39;t <br/>
need to see support for spanking.  They can get that lots of other places.  <br/>
Out of respect for children none of us even know, we&#39;re trying to keep this <br/>
list on the track of living harmoniously with children, learning with them, <br/>
living with them, not over them, or in opposition to them.<br/>

  ** The first couple years were work-related and really a big time-saver. I could get in touch with almost all my employees with one e-mail, and they could chat and answer a lot of each others questions instead of me having to answer them all. Then I found a great natural parenting list that helped me expand my hobby of learning about herbs and alternative/natural medicine. Then when I quit work to stay home I started seeking out some unschooling lists, and a pregnancy list. When I don&#39;t have time, I delete. Simple as that. I also am not limited by message space, so I can save stuff as long as I want, too. <br/>

Debate is one of the best ways for people to hone their ideas, to test their <br/>

whether they&#39;re sound and whether they&#39;re keepers, or just temporary <br/>

general rule is attack ideas not people. The statements you&#39;ve presented are<br/>
to me opinions. Strong opinions, yes, but opinions nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
What I pulled out above are attacks on ideas but not attacks on people. Some<br/>
people identify strongly with their opinions so feel personally attacked<br/>
when their ideas and opinions are attacked. But here there are no rules<br/>
defending ideas from attack.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And some people who didn&#39;t get smacked feel personally attacked when their<br/>
opinions are attacked too. My dander sometimes goes up when someone<br/>
disagrees with me. And I think it&#39;s when I don&#39;t feel confident enough to<br/>
defend those opinions. Usually it&#39;s because I haven&#39;t thought the ideas<br/>
through well enough to verbalize what I mean. So it&#39;s a good wake up call to<br/>
give them some thought!<br/>
