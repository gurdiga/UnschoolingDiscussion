<div id="ygrps-yiv-1547365368">my son did the same thing.  he would say &#39;don&#39;t look at me&#39; in a very <br/>
sing songy voice - very cute.  i think curiosity must be satisfied or <br/>
they will continue having the desire.  maybe you can find a safe way <br/>
for him to explore what it is that is facinating him.  i know there <br/>
are some things which just can&#39;t be shared but i try to keep this to a <br/>
minimum because i want my son to understand that the world is his to <br/>
explore and i want him to always be curious.  i feel this is important <br/>
because both curiosity and the ability to be satisfied are things i <br/>
believe is sorely lacking in our adult society.  if children can <br/>
experience deep levels of satisfaction ( particularly at early ages) <br/>
imo they are more cooperative because they feel understood and then <br/>
they can extend a greater understanding to those around them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>yes, well put, susan... that makes huge amounts of sense... if they are <br/>
empathized with, they learn to empathize through modeling... you would think <br/>
too that unconditional or unselfish love would work the same way... when <br/>
shown it as a child, should teach the child to show it in return... and yet <br/>
it always amazes me when i meet people that were so abused as children but <br/>
are able as adults to be wonderful unselfish, unconditionally loving parents</div>
