<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136259169">&lt;&lt;Really? I never had any problem the four different occasions I went up<br/>
there.<br/>
They asked a few basic questions and except for one time we were on our way.<br/>
The difficult time was when they searched our van, they were having problems<br/>
that week with something (I think it was illegal guns coming through, don&#39;t<br/>
remember) and were being hyper sensitive.<br/>
Other than that it was ultra easy.<br/>
&#39;Course we were just passing through....are you meaning trying to live<br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
Ren&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah I was talking about relocating.  :)  Don&#39;t know of any country that you<br/>
can just relocate to - except this one.<br/>
<br/>
AND<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Switzerland. That&#39;s our choice. Ben is a Major (was Air Force) in the Air<br/>
National Guard. He may be deployed in the next week. He CHOSE the Air Force.<br/>
Free choice. If my boys won&#39;t be given free choice,  the Government will<br/>
leave ME no choice. I&#39;ll have to move.<br/>
<br/>
~Kelly&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So how do you do that?  I&#39;m just really curious... I&#39;ve wondered for years,<br/>
but now it&#39;s all at the fore of my mind.  What if I really do want to leave<br/>
here?  I can&#39;t!  I&#39;m as trapped as trapped can be.  At least from where I<br/>
sit.<br/>
<br/>
Please give me the lowdown on how one leaves if they want to.  Where can you<br/>
honestly go and stay?<br/>

New Zealand, I hear, if you have job skills they need.  Some countries will <br/>
have the  need for skilled labor or specialists, and if you fit one of their <br/>
requirements, it&#39;s &quot;Come on down!&quot; (or up, maybe).<br/>

OH, OH,       There ya go,  maybe I could get a job at the WETA workshop! &lt;g&gt;     I&#39;m sure with millions of others who would like to work there!      <br/>
 <br/>
If people are wondering what the WETA workshop is--its the group that did most of the special effects for Lord of the Rings. <br/>

wives but some did not.  Never asked how they did it though.  <br/>

Right.  Special effects seems NOT to be a lacking skill in New Zealand. &lt;g&gt;</div>
