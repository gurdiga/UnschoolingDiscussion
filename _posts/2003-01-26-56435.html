<div id="ygrps-yiv-321671564">&lt;&lt;And the kids always want to go to COSI&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the coolest place?<br/>
<br/>
We lived in Michigan a few years ago and would drive down to Toledo.  The<br/>
kids loved the ball &quot;cannon&quot; and I was crazy about the &quot;mid-air bike&quot;.  One<br/>
of the few things I miss about that cold, cold place.<br/>

Yeah, very cold.  Like 12 degrees right now.  Too cold for me to venture<br/>
outside.  Even for COSI.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297959360">Yeah,     <br/>
 <br/>
how about -10.     Let&#39;s say we are getting really good at run to the store, run to the van,  run to the house, run to the van.      There&#39;s our exercise,   <br/>
 <br/>
Sandra,   I hope it warms up for you, as far as Cananda goes.    I&#39;m thinking I would go into shock going from New Mexico to Saskachewan!            My thoughts are with you for the coldness and the school-at-homers!<br/>

Kelli,   brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr<br/>
