<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892258795"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; We are contemplating buying Hooked on Phonics for Brittany.  I looked up the<br/>
&gt; info. on the official web site & it is $299.99 + 27.50 shipping & handling.<br/>
&gt; YIKES!  Do you know of any other places we could buy it?<br/>

You might try e-bay for a used copy, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a set of phonics flash-cards at Wal-Mart when my son was at that<br/>
point.  It included 2 cards that reviewed the phonics rules for Mom (who<br/>
needed the refresher course), had pretty pictures on them, and were niftily<br/>
color-coded by vowels, blends, etc.  The song and dance routine you have to<br/>
provide yourself, of course, but Dr. Seuss books and such can help.  Total<br/>
cost: $3.50, which is good, because I didn&#39;t feel bad when I gave them away<br/>
6 months later.  <br/>
<br/>
You daughter might have just as much fun, if not more, with something you<br/>
dreamed up out of your own imagination!<br/>

The mayor of chicago was pitching a fit today on the news!!!!!! He was <br/>
having....never mind, I thought that he was going to break some blood <br/>
vessels....<br/>
He was fussing about how parents are not doing their job be having the kids <br/>
at school on the first day of school.<br/>
 He said.....It costs us our funding.....<br/>
In other words.... If the kids are absent, they don&#39;t get the money from the <br/>
state. They have to turn in their absent sheets to the state.......So, if the <br/>
kids are there, they get a certain amount and if they are not there....<br/>
they don&#39;t get the monnnneeeeeeyyyyyy....................<br/>
