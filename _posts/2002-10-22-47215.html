&gt; haven&#39;t adopted the best ways.  So the unschoolers advocate that the <br/>

&gt; Agreed.  We are born with selfish hearts.  The closest we can come in <br/>
&gt; this life is to agree on standards of what is right and what is <br/>
&gt; wrong, and discipline those who do wrong.<br/>

ourselves. Maybe you Christians NEED to find Jesus to find these things. Then <br/>
go for it. But don&#39;t assume we ALL have these shortcomings!<br/>

&gt; True Christians (I can&#39;t speak for the ones in these examples of <br/>
