<br/>
I felt that way abt the aspy comment,too.<br/>
 I guess when I say that &quot;I have a delicate sanity&quot; phrase thats what I mean, all those phrases...and this is getting way complicated for my little mind......and there goes another one.....my little mind.....and another thread....<br/>
In case anyones still reading, I think I&#39;ve discovered that my real problem with the delicate sanity part is surfacing as a control issue and I&#39;m working on that ,too.......The discovery happened on another list! See, I&#39;m using multiple sources!<br/>

one&#39;s own limits.  It&#39;s a typical unschooling and mindful parenting  <br/>
thing, and a compassionate thing, to attend to those you love with an  <br/>
eye to their comfort.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Learning our own limits and how to manage our moods and appetites,  <br/>
needs for sleep, water, visits to the toilet... no matter how much or  <br/>
how little our awareness, one step toward making better choices is a  <br/>
good step.   Any helpessness, learned or imposed or savored as a  <br/>
quirk or a disability, is an unnecessary helplessness.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who is new enough to the list not to know there are some  <br/>
collected bits about choices might want to read here.  They&#39;re short  <br/>
but important.<br/>

In any case in which advice doesn&#39;t work, there&#39;s no sense going on  <br/>
and on about why it won&#39;t work.  If I had  blind child and went to a  <br/>
list where people were recommending movies and photography books, I  <br/>
would be able to translate the gist of the recommendations (input and  <br/>
expanded experience) and tailor them to my own child.  More input and  <br/>
more choices can be given no matter what a child&#39;s circumstances are.<br/>
<br/>
As to &quot;delicate sanity,&quot; perhaps choosing another word than &quot;sanity&quot;  <br/>
would help, because &quot;insanity&quot; is neither safe nor desireable.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not kinda cute.  It&#39;s frightening.    But to discuss one&#39;s calm, or  <br/>
collectedness, or patience, or centeredness wouldn&#39;t have such a  <br/>
steep drop-off in case of failure.<br/>

Oh and while I&#39;m assmilating my new catch phrase (it reads sarcastically BUT I do NOT mean it that way), I&#39;ve been learning a wonderful amount and even printed the &quot;certificate of empowerment&quot;, &quot;the edge of unschooling&quot;, &quot;the value of choices&quot; and others to have at the ready , when the computer is NOT on....which is not the case today , for my dear husband has taken the boys out for &quot;man day&quot; and I am doing some self-help (courtesy of all you poor souls)and then I will take a luxuriously long scented bath (in the daytime!!) More than you wanted to know? ;)<br/>
<br/>
I offer My Apologies and Thanks Again,<br/>

Long bath and guys gone for a while sounds good!<br/>
It&#39;s costing this group nothing to pour forth opinions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
