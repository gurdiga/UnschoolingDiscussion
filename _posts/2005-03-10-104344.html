<div id="ygrps-yiv-553182798"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;If there are enough factors that a family isn&#39;t unschooling well, then <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;they<br/>
 </span></blockquote>should put their kids in school. Nobody here is authorized to let anyone off <br/>
the hook about compulsory<br/>
education laws.  All of us put together can&#39;t save ONE FAMILY from the <br/>
place where<br/>
they live if they are found to just be cruising in some lazy,  avoidant<br/>
fashion.  I&#39;m really unlikely to get in trouble, as my kids are  doing well <br/>
and<br/>
would impress any government officials who might question  them about their <br/>
lives,<br/>
if we had somone complain about us.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I think we are unschooling &#39;well&#39;.. but even that didn&#39;t stop us from being <br/>
&#39;hot-lined&#39; by someone...and having to turn logs in and answer <br/>
questions..and we still feel like we are being watched... even if we are the <br/>
best &#39;unschooling&#39; family ever... it still doesn&#39;t fly with the people I was <br/>
faced with talking to.<br/>
I&#39;m just not that equiped to convince authorites that what we are doing is <br/>
right and ok.. and my kids are ok..... I&#39;m glad for those that are <br/>
&#39;unlikely&#39; to get into trouble... but what about my family..I&#39;m still not <br/>
sure we have what it takes to &#39;look good&#39;  or even it that is possible? <br/>
