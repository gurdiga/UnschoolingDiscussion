 </span></blockquote>During college, I lived for a couple years with a woman who bred and showed<br/>
English Springer Spaniels, and they&#39;re a very nice medium/smallish large<br/>
dog.  You have to really watch the breeding, as they have been overbred some<br/>
and have had problems with rage and hip dysplastia.  Howevever, if you&#39;re<br/>
buying from a long-time, reputable breeder, you hopefully should have no<br/>
problem.  Or, if you get a shelter dog of mixed breed, you might want to<br/>
look for one with some springer spaniel in it.  They are wonderful,<br/>
intelligent, loving animals.<br/>
