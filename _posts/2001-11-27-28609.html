<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247020132">Each community/jr. college in CA can set its own criteria.  Up here a family<br/>
was taking advantage of the BOGGs (Board of Govenors&#39; Grants, which pays for<br/>
units) and enrolling 6 year olds, etc.  The children were not &quot;taking&quot; the<br/>
classes and were disruptive.  So now, compliments of this family, the kids<br/>
can&#39;t take classes before they are 16.<br/>
<br/>
At the jr. college where I use to work, there was no minimum age but kids<br/>
under high school age had to be interviewed.  We had some kids as young as<br/>
10 taking classes.<br/>

&gt; Do any of you have experience with your older children attending local<br/>
community colleges? At what age were they allowed to attend a few classes?<br/>
How did they fare, coming from an unschooled background?What subjects did<br/>
they take?<br/>
&gt; TIA,<br/>

&gt;   Hi Christine,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Can you briefly mention your 2 new subjects?  I&#39;ll try to respond if I<br/>
&gt;   can.  There are so many posts on this list that I simply don&#39;t have the<br/>
&gt;   time to read every one.  I&#39;m new to this list also.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;&gt;  Instead of<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt; complaining why don&#39;t you write about unschooling yourself. Get a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt; thread<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt; started on what you are interested in. These kinds of messages always<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt; give me<br/>
&gt;   &gt;&gt; a chuckle  . . . you see them on every kind of list there is.<br/>
