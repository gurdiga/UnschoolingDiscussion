<div id="ygrps-yiv-1002136393">Hello all!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Nina and I have been lurking on the board for a few days now, and<br/>
am really enjoying the conversations, and the different posts and<br/>
information that all of you have been contributing.<br/>
<br/>
My son 7 and daughter 3 have been unschooling all along... just sort of fell<br/>
into it via the way we began parenting and the books that led one to<br/>
another. It just made sense.<br/>
<br/>
We recently moved to Washington state with it&#39;s yearly testing laws which<br/>
threw me into a tizzy and I almost blew everything, coming into contact for<br/>
the first time with the anxiety over making sure kids are up for passing the<br/>
test. And then, fortunately a wonderful book was recommended  - Learning at<br/>
Home by Marty Layne and I feel that I&#39;ve come out of the fog again, found my<br/>
footing again. And I&#39;ve found you all!<br/>
<br/>
Well, I thought it was time I came out of the bushes and introduced myself.<br/>
Thanks to all who have posted insights, personal experiences and opinions...<br/>
and the great stuff about mexican beans and newspaper hats!!!<br/>

floor!)</div>

**Hi Nina. If your kids are only 7 and 3 you don&#39;t even need to register as<br/>
homeschoolers in WA. That starts at age 8. Have you looked into Family<br/>
Learning Organization (FLO) for testing? I did that last year for the first<br/>
time and it was great. Just $25. Anyway, you don&#39;t need to worry about it<br/>
yet...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-165281931">Nina, Could you tell us about the book Learning at Home?  I&#39;ve never heard of<br/>
it.  I don&#39;t think my library has it, but I&#39;m still searching.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m in Vancouver.  Moved recently from Olympia.  <br/>
<br/>
Just curious,<br/>
