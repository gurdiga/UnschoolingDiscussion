<div id="ygrps-yiv-834886962">Teens? Hi ya&#39;ll, I haven&#39;t posted for awhile, and I&#39;d really love to hear from Helen, Tia and any other &quot;long timers&quot;, who unschooled their teens, now &quot;adults&quot; (whatever that means!) children. What was it like? Do all teens need to be the opposite of thier parents (like Alex Keaton in Family Ties) at least for awhile, as they search for who they are? Was it different, and in what ways, with daughters vs sons?  How much of the yucky stuff, like peer presure, that we associate with school, was part of their growing up? Thank you in advance for your brilliant thinking...<br/>
;-) Robyn<br/>
