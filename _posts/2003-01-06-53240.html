<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162434784">I am teaching a filmmaking class this semester-- my students &quot;vote&quot; on areas of inquiry and then each of the middle grades teachers takes an area and we do an &quot;Academy&quot; on it.  (Sorry, I&#39;m hoping that my bio got through previously-- I posted it about a week ago and got no responses... I&#39;m a seventh grade teacher in a charter school that&#39;s based on inquiry-learning... I&#39;m here because I have considered/ am considering home schooling my own kids-- 8, 5 and 22 months-- and I know I can learn a lot from this list.)<br/>
<br/>
We have a digital camcorder and an IMac with whatever film software is standard on it.  Anyone have any favorite websites/ references that their kid like to use for making films?  I&#39;m not sure what kinds of gilms the kids will be making-- it&#39;s all their choice-- but it would be nice to have sources to point them to if they get stuck somewhere along the way.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
