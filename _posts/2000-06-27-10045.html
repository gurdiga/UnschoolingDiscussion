stories I have heard in a long time. Thanks for the gentle reminder to be <br/>
kind to others less fortunate than us with out perfect children, and who <br/>

&gt; This was forwarded to me from another list.  I think this is just<br/>
&gt; beautiful.<br/>
&gt; In Brooklyn, New York, Chush is a school that caters to learning<br/>
&gt; disabled children.  Some children remain in Chush<br/>
&gt; for their entire school<br/>
&gt; career, while others can be mainstreamed into conventional schools.<br/>
&gt; At a Chush fundraising dinner, the father of a Chush<br/>
&gt; child delivered a speech<br/>
&gt; that would never be forgotten by all who attended.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he cried<br/>
&gt; out, &quot;Where is the perfection in my<br/>
&gt; son Shaya?  Everything God does is done with perfection.  But my<br/>
&gt; child cannot understand things as other children do.  My<br/>
&gt; child cannot remember<br/>
&gt; facts and figures as other children do.  Where is<br/>
&gt; God&#39;s perfection?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The audience was shocked by the question, pained by the<br/>
&gt; father&#39;s anguish and<br/>
&gt; stilled by the piercing query.  &quot;I believe,&quot; the father<br/>
&gt; answered, &quot;that when God brings a child like this into the world,<br/>
&gt; the  perfection that he seeks is<br/>
&gt; in the way people react to this child.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He then told the following story<br/>
&gt; about his son Shaya:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One afternoon, Shaya and his father walked past a park where some<br/>
&gt; boys Shaya knew were playing baseball.  Shaya asked, &quot;Do you think<br/>
&gt; they will let me play?&quot; Shaya&#39;s father knew that his son was not at<br/>
&gt; all athletic and that most boys would not want him on their team.<br/>
&gt; But Shaya&#39;s father understood that if his son was chosen to play it<br/>
&gt; would give him a comfortable sense of<br/>
&gt; belonging. Shaya&#39;s father approached one of the boys<br/>
&gt; in the field and asked if Shaya could play. The boy looked around for<br/>
&gt; guidance from his teammates.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  Getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said &quot;We are<br/>
&gt; losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning.  I<br/>
&gt; guess he can be on our<br/>
&gt; team and we&#39;ll try to put him up to bat in the ninth inning.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shaya&#39;s father was ecstatic as Shaya smiled broadly.  Shaya was told<br/>
&gt; to put on a glove and<br/>
&gt; go out to play short center field.  In the bottom of the eighth<br/>
&gt; inning, Shaya&#39;s team scored a few runs but was still behind<br/>
&gt; by three. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shaya&#39;s team scored<br/>
&gt; again and now with two outs and the bases loaded with the potential<br/>
&gt; winning run on base.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shaya was scheduled to be up.  Would the team actually let Shaya bat<br/>
&gt; at this juncture and give away their chance to win the game?<br/>
&gt; Surpassingly, Shaya<br/>
&gt; was given the bat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone knew that it was all but impossible because Shaya didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even know how to hold the bat properly, let alone hit with it.<br/>
&gt; However as Shaya stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved a few<br/>
&gt; steps to lob the ball in softly so Shaya should at least be able to<br/>
&gt; make contact. The first pitch<br/>
&gt; came and Shaya swung clumsily and missed.  One of Shaya&#39;s teammates<br/>
&gt; came up to Shaya and together they held the bat and faced the pitcher<br/>
&gt; waiting for<br/>
&gt; the next pitch.  The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss<br/>
&gt; the ball softly toward Shaya.  As the pitch came in, Shaya and his<br/>
&gt; teammate swung at the ball and together they hit a slow ground ball<br/>
&gt; to the pitcher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could easily have thrown<br/>
&gt; the ball to the first baseman.  Shaya would have been out and that<br/>
&gt; would have ended the game.  Instead, the pitcher took the ball and<br/>
&gt; threw<br/>
&gt; it on a high arc to right field, far beyond reach of the first<br/>
&gt; baseman.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Everyone started yelling, &quot;Shaya, run to first.  Run to first.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Never in his life had Shaya<br/>
&gt; run to first.  He scampered down the baseline wide-eyed and<br/>
&gt; startled.  By the time he reached first base, the right fielder<br/>
&gt; had the ball.  He could have thrown he ball to the second baseman who<br/>
&gt; would tag out Shaya, who was still running.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But the right fielder understood<br/>
&gt; what the pitcher&#39;s intentions were, so he threw the ball high and far<br/>
&gt; over the third baseman&#39;s  head.  Everyone yelled, &quot;Run to second, run<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; second.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Shaya ran towards second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously<br/>
&gt; circled the bases<br/>
&gt; towards home.  As Shaya reached second base, the<br/>
&gt; opposing short stop ran to<br/>
&gt; him, turned him in the direction of third base and shouted, &quot;Run to<br/>
&gt; third.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As Shaya rounded third, the boys from both teams ran<br/>
&gt; behind him screaming,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Shaya run home.&quot;  Shaya ran home, stepped on home plate and all 18<br/>
&gt; boys lifted him on their shoulders and made him the hero, as if he<br/>
&gt; had just hit a<br/>
&gt; &quot;grand slam&quot; and won the game for his team.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;That day,&quot; said the father softly with tears now rolling down his<br/>
&gt; face, &quot;those 18 boys reached their level of God&#39;s perfection.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
