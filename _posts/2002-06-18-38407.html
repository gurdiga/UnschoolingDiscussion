&gt;&gt;&gt; I was &quot;blown away&quot; by discovering where their interests really lie, but I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; also know that I can&#39;t keep buying &quot;stuff&quot; to fit their interests.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s great to see what our kids will choose if actually given the choice.<br/>
&gt; :o) Sounds like  your kids are enjoying the freedom to choose their own<br/>
&gt; schooly, curriculum stuff and they&#39;ve managed to surprise you by their<br/>
&gt; choices. As they get used to their new UN-schooly freedom, they&#39;ll surprise<br/>
&gt; you even more with their choices of interests out there in the real world.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Reminds me of the times Cassidy at 5 or 6 years old circled everything in a<br/>
catalog he would like to buy (I got the idea from my Dad). Then we added it<br/>
all up. We both learned a lot -- and not just &quot;math.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now my friend & I go to fancy craft shows & add up all the money we&#39;re<br/>
saving by not buying all that gorgeous stuff. What fun!<br/>
