<div id="ygrps-yiv-1273471673">For starters, as any real estate agent would tell you location feeds the<br/>
designation of &quot;prime.&quot;  The only thing that would bring down that<br/>
designation would be hazardous waste cleanup being needed.  In this case,<br/>
the old advertising saying, &quot;location, location, location&quot; makes it &quot;prime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Two, no one except the woman and her children know how many dogs there are.<br/>
The papers have reported 27, then 15 and now they are saying they removed<br/>
FOUR dogs.  Amazing how the number shrinks when they got what they wanted,<br/>
which was the woman out of her home!<br/>
<br/>
The stereotyping going on with this thread is really something else.  A<br/>
child<br/>
is informed that his mother has been snatched by the police.  The cops come<br/>
and want to remove him and his siblings from their home.  He runs back in<br/>
the<br/>
house and SUPPOSEDLY says something about guns.  Not one gun has been seen,<br/>
no shots have been fired.  His mother was worried about loosing her home,<br/>
which indeed happend but that makes her paranoid.  Based on this slim<br/>
information people have LABELED then &quot;not normal,&quot; &quot;paranoid,&quot; and implied<br/>
they had survivalist mentality.<br/>
<br/>
These people don&#39;t live the way I live or the way I would want to.  They<br/>
don&#39;t live in an area I would want to live in.  They have made choices I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have made.  However, I respect their RIGHT to make their own<br/>
personal choices and I&#39;m not going to start throwing out paranoia (all the<br/>
implied survivalist boogy man stuff) and judgemental labels.<br/>
<br/>
All this labeling and judging simply amazes me on an unschooling list!  Of<br/>
all the people to be doing it, seems that those who are part of a group that<br/>
has been given the worst public image in the homeschooling community would<br/>
be a little more open to allowing others to make &quot;different&quot; choices and not<br/>
be so quick to rush to judgement with little or nothing in the line of facts<br/>
to base that judgement on!<br/>
<br/>
And, yes I have been biten.  No, I haven&#39;t been chased because I know better<br/>
than to run.  As to dogs chasing folks on bicycles, well we know where<br/>
&quot;those&quot; kinds of dogs live and we&#39;ve cured them with a little amonia and<br/>
water in a squirt bottle.  It&#39;s never taken more than two &quot;lessons.&quot;  And if<br/>
we are bicycling in an area that we aren&#39;t familiar with, we take along our<br/>
squirt bottles.  And, before the question is asked, yes, the kidlets are<br/>
very familiar with the concept and able to employee it even under duress.<br/>
No. 3 son used his quite successfully when he was under 3 yo.<br/>

&gt;     From what I read the person wasn&#39;t ON the &quot;prime&quot; property. This<br/>
&quot;prime&quot;<br/>
&gt; property would need a hell of alot of clean up to be &quot;prime&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     We weren&#39;t talking pebbles we are talking dog bites here. I have been<br/>
&gt; chased,bit at and hit  by dogs while cycling. It is in no way OK w/ me. It<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; a mazing to me that people do not take responsibility for their dogs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    This is not &quot;normal&quot; to have 20 some dogs that run wild and hunt their<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; food. let alone some one was injured by one of them or more (don&#39;t know<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; many she encountered).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     I just think it is uncalled for to pick apart the word severe in this<br/>
&gt; case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;     Have you ever been bit or even chased by a dog intent on harming you?<br/>
