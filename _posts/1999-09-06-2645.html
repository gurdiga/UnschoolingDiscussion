Mine isn&#39;t an only child, but he is the only one left at home,  so it <br/>
comes down to unschooling an only.  Chances are his electronics <br/>
obsession will end.  Before that,  you might even see a move to more <br/>
quality in what he watches on tv and what kind of games he plays.<br/>
It worried me too,  but we decided not to restrict tv or video games <br/>
and see where it took us.  Now,  I feel like ds is much more <br/>
selective about how he spends his time,  than his friends who need <br/>
the escape.  The fact that he has been bored is good.  It means he&#39;s <br/>
searching for something else.  Let him be bored and resolve it <br/>
himself.  That can lead to really creative ideas.  Deschooling may <br/>
take more than one summer.  Depending on his age,  he may test you to <br/>
see if you&#39;re really serious about this unschooling thing.  Good luck <br/>
and let us know how it progresses.<br/>

&gt;I know they are smart, and are learning, but it just seems that we are stuck <br/>
&gt;here on play, and the same play everyday.  <br/>

We had a no TV week.  Absolutely OFF (no videos or anything) for an<br/>
entire week.  Helped us to break the habit of watching without really<br/>
thinking about it.<br/>

Hoping nobody tells me to have a no computer week!!<br/>
