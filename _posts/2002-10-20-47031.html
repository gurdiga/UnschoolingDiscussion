<div id="ygrps-yiv-796244970">My 3 year old does this!<br/>
I guess to a three year old 1 is kind of young. <br/>
Lately she has taken to asking everyone when they were a baby. G-d forbid we call her little girl now.  She is a big girl! Except when she wants to be carried like a baby while nursing.  Oooooooooh my back!<br/>
