&lt;&lt; I thought it was a diet thing, and felt very smug about my daughter&#39;s<br/>
vegetarian, no bovine growth hormone lifestyle. She started developing<br/>
breasts at 7. A friend of mine with triplet daughters who are 13 or 14<br/>
now told me it was the same with her family, and they started their<br/>
peiods at 10 and 11. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Same here for dd. Organic milk always and vegetarian since 7, breasts at 9.<br/>
