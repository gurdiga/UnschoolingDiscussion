<br/>
differs in  unschooling? Or could we discuss what other see as differences<br/>

<br/>
I wrote this recently:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Generally for the purposes of discussion on these lists unschooling is<br/>
trusting that you children can and will learn all the academic skills and<br/>
information that need to live fully without enforced lessons - the &quot;not<br/>
doing school&quot; part. The parents&#39; job is to create the environment, both<br/>
physical and mental, wherein interests and passions can be discovered and<br/>
facilitated. <br/>
<br/>
Radical Unschooling is extending that Trust to all areas of your whole life,<br/>
living by general Principles such as Honesty, Kindness, Respect, Acceptance,<br/>
Generosity instead of having rules, chores, required behaviors, punishments<br/>
of any sort. It is about building relationships, respecting children as<br/>
autonomous beings and creating an environment where the freedom to make real<br/>
choices is fostered and individual preferences honored as much as possible<br/>
within real practical constraints (as opposed to having some kind of<br/>
behavioral control agenda). &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what you mean by &quot;link&quot; here. To an essay or article? To an<br/>
unschooling e-list that is not RU?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something else that I wrote once on AU - maybe something useful here<br/>
for you:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;When someone, usually a newbie or “considering it” individual comes to<br/>
these lists and wants a definition of unschooling, part of the purpose is to<br/>
not sound too terrifying, not to create a yawning black vortex of the<br/>
unknown right off the bat. Couching the definition in terms of what<br/>
unschooling is “not” academically is the simplest first step to explaining,<br/>
and allows the ideas to have the hook of the normal to hang on initially.<br/>
The oft made recommendations of being gradual in change are designed for the<br/>
comfort and ease of the children, even more so than the parents.<br/>
<br/>
It is when the descriptions and explanations of what unschooling *is* and<br/>
how it works start coming, that many people seem to retreat into the<br/>
familiar. They want to continue to use the word “Consequences”<br/>
euphemistically for punishments. They want to continue to consider<br/>
Principles as merely Rules restated gently, rather than a life altering<br/>
methodology. They want to continue to be comfortable in the standardized<br/>
research about child development and behavior – all based essentially on how<br/>
to keep kids “doing better” in school and manipulate them into acting<br/>
certain approved ways – instead of looking at their own children as<br/>
outstandingly unique individuals. Sometimes they want to continue to take<br/>
credit for their normal children’s normal accomplishments – like they<br/>
“taught their baby to walk and talk”. So they ask, nervously or defiantly,<br/>
“But isn’t unschooling really just simply not doing school? Aren’t I still<br/>
an unschooler if I’m not a radical unschooler?”<br/>
<br/>
 Long time Unschoolers answer reassuringly, “Well, yes *technically*, in<br/>
terms of a dictionary style definition, it is possible to only unschool<br/>
academics”. I have long had the sneaking suspicion that the cognoscenti are<br/>
metaphorically winking at each other and grinning behind their hands. They<br/>
already understand that the overwhelming experience and practice of people<br/>
who are posting (can’t speak about people who never post), is that over time<br/>
almost everyone ends up extending the philosophies and practices (more or<br/>
less) towards “Whole Life Unschooling”, a phrase I like to use sometimes<br/>
because it is both more descriptive, and may sound gentler than “Radical<br/>
Unschooling”. At least the ones who confide about the greatest level of<br/>
happiness and wonder in their lives have made, and are living, that<br/>
extension. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not stuck..Well in a way, I just need something to help wrap <br/>
around. I can&#39;t see how radical unschooling and unschooling differ in <br/>
the sense of school at home and discipline. Neither philosophy as I <br/>
understand it include these..... <br/>
<br/>
An email was sent to me last night saying that unschoolers do what is <br/>
best for their family (including math,discipline etc) while radical <br/>
unschoolers like me (my name was used) have a dogmatic approach to <br/>
unschooling as a radical. Dogmatic bc I have been seeking to be clear <br/>
that my understanding of unschooling is not whatever floats your boat <br/>
relaxed homeschooling/discipline focused parenting.<br/>

<br/>
So you were privately flamed by someone too cowardly to put their insulting<br/>
views here, and back them up with sane argument and real experiences. <br/>
<br/>
People do tend to get defensive when they realize that we RU&#39;ers are<br/>
demonstrating that pretty much everything they feel called to &quot;insist on&quot; or<br/>
attempt to &quot;ensure&quot; - and almost every fight they have with their children -<br/>
is unnecessary at best, counter productive at worst. Hence the offensive<br/>
implication that we are placing some dogma ahead of what is &quot;best for our<br/>
families&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry you were targeted like that. Getting information and opinions<br/>
about Unschooling from people who are hostile to the concepts is a little<br/>
like asking for a description of the philosophies and practices of Wicca<br/>
from Jerry Falwell. The results are likely to somewhat skewed.<br/>

Oh Laura, I forgot to add that if you want to forward the two paragraphs<br/>
about the difference between academic unschooling and RU to the other<br/>
person, assuming they are not subscribers here, if it will help, please feel<br/>
free to do so. I like to think those words offer a positive take on both<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&#39;unschooling&#39; and &#39;radical unschooling&#39; are by and large the same when <br/>
you are talking in the realm of &#39;academics&#39; or school like issues. <br/>
Where things start to diverge is that some folks stop at the <br/>
academics - life looks exactly the same everywhere else in terms of <br/>
parental rules and structures, discipline aka punishment (time outs, <br/>
spankings, removing privileges or possessions, etc), &#39;times&#39; <br/>
(mealtime, bedtime, bathtime, etc), and such. Other folks take the <br/>
trust developed in that academic area and extend it to the rest of <br/>
life. If Joan can set her own path (with my guidance and facilitation <br/>
as needed) in learning what she needs for her life goals, then I also <br/>
trust that (with my guidance and facilitation as needed) she can make <br/>
her own choices about what and when to eat, when and how long to <br/>
sleep, and so on...it spreads to all of life (thus a common <br/>
phrase &#39;whole life unschooling&#39; - maybe using that phrase could help <br/>
you &#39;wrap around&#39; the idea?). And some folks come at it from the other <br/>
direction - they start out trusting their babies to eat, sleep, and <br/>
develop/learn in their own unique ways and don&#39;t see any reason to <br/>
stop trusting that once the child reaches &#39;school age&#39;. Here again <br/>
it&#39;s trust extending over all of life.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve mostly focused on the academic side of things (and some <br/>
general things) above I&#39;d like to touch on this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;... sense of school at home and discipline. Neither philosophy as I <br/>
understand it include these..... &quot; <br/>
<br/>
Depends on what you mean by &#39;discipline&#39;. If you mean a person who is <br/>
following another&#39;s instructions, seeking to be like a respected other <br/>
person (becoming a disciple in the denotational sense, not the <br/>
religious context) or one who is setting themselves to accomplish a <br/>
goal and doing whatever is required (hours of physical training for <br/>
example as in a &#39;disciplined athlete&#39;), then that is very much a part <br/>
of unschooling and radical unschooling (whole life unschooling) - each <br/>
person directs their course. If by discipline you are referring to a <br/>
system of rules with punishments and rewards designed to mold or <br/>
modify behavior to someone else&#39;s standards, then I&#39;d say that <br/>
unschooling (in the academic only sense) might or might not include <br/>
this. Whole life unschooling most assuredly is moving away from this. <br/>
Here&#39;s a wonderful article <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/benrules">http://sandradodd.com/benrules</a> on Rules vs <br/>
Principles which might apply in this context (and there&#39;s a link at <br/>
the bottom to more on the subject).<br/>

TBH I&#39;m concerned that people who are not RU might see these paras from AU<br/>
as being unnecessarily combative. I wrote those with the assumption that the<br/>
readers were interested in moving towards RU or already RU at the time,<br/>
rather than with a wider audience in mind. I would be sorry if someone took<br/>
my remarks about &quot;people retreating to the familiar&quot; as support for their<br/>
notion that we were dogmatic. <br/>

Discussions about what is and what isn&#39;t unschooling are similar to  <br/>
