<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156372103">I wrote most of this last night, and then accidentally sent it to a list member instead of the list!  Sorry Mary Ellen, and thanks for letting me know.<br/>
Thanks for all of your responses.  I am a little calmer now, though still scared and confused, wondering who would do this.  Actually this morning those feelings are fading and I am getting more and more angry...<br/>
<br/>
I am in New Mexico.  <br/>
In NM we have to submit a form by April 1 every year notifying the state that we are homeschooling, maintain immunization records, maintain records that you have a diploma or GED,  and it is SUGGESTED that you keep a &quot;school&quot; calendar.  <br/>
I  have done all of these things, I am fully legal, though the calendar is really just my little day planner, it does have all of our trips and stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
As I wrote before, the report stated that Richard has never been to school and that I am not registered (I am), but it also stated that we live in &quot;filthy&quot; conditions with &quot;clutter and clothes&quot; all over the place that you can hardly walk around.  It said that my house stunk and that it was a fire hazard because of all the clutter.  This is considered personal neglect, which is why CPS is involved, and not dept of Education, though they certainly had a lot of questions about our homeschooling!<br/>
My house is cluttered, but certainly not a fire hazard!  I am in the slow process of painting the bedrooms, so most of the stuff from my bedroom is in the front room.  At the moment we don&#39;t go in there (the front room) at all, as there are two living areas.  The process is so slow because I work full time and I spend as much of my time off with Richard, not on house-related stuff.  So yes, I admit it is messy.  <br/>
<br/>
I know someone in another branch of the Children Youth and Families Department who gave me the impression that it was better to comply with letting the officer into my home, now I question that decision.  :~(  Her thought was that I had nothing to hide, so don&#39;t act like it.  I have gotten all of my paperwork together, and am going to put together a &quot;curriculum&quot; (thanks for the link Sandra).  <br/>
<br/>
When she first showed up, I had just gotten done with 3 night shifts.  I don&#39;t usually work nights, but I was covering for someone who was on vacation.   So when the officer showed up I was sleeping.  She looked around and informed me of the complaint, and said that she would come back for her formal visit.  I immediately went to the childcare and while I was there she showed up to talk to Richard, so she talked to him with me there.  I was told that in cases where child safety is concerned they don&#39;t have to allow the parent to sit in the interview with the child.   She was surprised that the police had not already contacted me, she said that in cases of suspected child neglect the police will come and inspect the property.  I have a friend who is a cop who happened to come by tonight, so I asked him about it.  He said yeah, your house is messy but it is not what they are looking for when they suspect neglect.  <br/>
<br/>
My thinking now is that as Roslynn and Sandra mentioned I did pretty much say it was ok for her to come back, so if I were to not let her in now it would look bad.   I did ask for a copy of the report, and was told that she &quot;couldn&#39;t&quot; give me a copy until the investigation was complete.  She said that the report was anonymous, and when I looked over her shoulder there was no name where the reporter would go, but I guess that really doesn&#39;t mean anything.  <br/>
<br/>
You know, before this happened to me, when I would read about things like this happening to other people I would think, well, there must be something else going on.  There must be some &quot;real&quot; reason for them to be investigated.  I am appalled at my thinking now.  <br/>
Thanks for all of your support and responses,<br/>
Katy<br/>
