<div id="ygrps-yiv-81212570">Someone who manages a smaller list wrote to ask me some questions  <br/>
about Always Learning. Here are some of my responses:<br/>
<br/>
-=-How/why you think of new topics and discussions for the group.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When something is rolling around in my head, I put it on the list.  <br/>
It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a checklist or an agenda.<br/>
<br/>
[I had said I would stir a topic back up and my correspondent said  <br/>
she didn&#39;t know what that meant.]<br/>
<br/>
I just meant I would add a response so it would come back up in the  <br/>
current mail and up higher on the list (for those who read it on the  <br/>
web) so it could get more attention.<br/>
<br/>
If the list seems to be going dark and sad, I&#39;m more likely to add  <br/>
something cheery. If there hasn&#39;t been anything for a while (which  <br/>
hasn&#39;t happened lately) I sometimes add something kind of perky and  <br/>
open-ended, just to keep people glad they&#39;re on the list.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s super busy (like last month) I&#39;m less likely to encourage or  <br/>
participate in something like a discussion of Alan Rickman. &quot;On  <br/>
topic&quot; is more important when people are getting cranky or there are  <br/>
over 100 posts a day.<br/>
<br/>

=============================================<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t touch on the approval of posts, or how to decide to let  <br/>
someone off moderations or leave them on (or put them back on), but  <br/>
that&#39;s not what she was asking about.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Alan Rickman mention referred to something a few years back when  <br/>
we got on an Alan Rickman discussion of which movies are great of his  <br/>
and what&#39;s so good about him anyway (&quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply,&quot;  &quot;Sense  <br/>
and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Galaxy Quest,&quot; and if you don&#39;t love him after  <br/>
those, just never mind)  Oh.  Harry Potter, too.)  Someone got kind  <br/>
of angry because I had sent something back for not being on topic  <br/>
because it was about curriculum or workbooks or something, and she  <br/>
was trying to shame me and call me a cheat because I didn&#39;t  <br/>
immediately stop the Alan Rickman discussion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the deal, though.  Learning to be analytical about moviemaking  <br/>
and acting and casting and the skillful use of a great voice is a  <br/>
bull&#39;s eye for  unschooling, honestly.  It wasn&#39;t like we stopped  <br/>
talking about how people learn and how to create a learning  <br/>
environment by going on an Alan Rickman &quot;explore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If anyone who has read this far wonders what I&#39;m talking about, maybe  <br/>
buy some Thinking Sticks or go to the Thinking Sticks blog.  They&#39;re  <br/>
unrelated in one way and exactly the same thing in another way.<br/>

<br/>
Those are strewing for adults, to practice unschooling on a level  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t necessarily involve kids.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something more for kids, but if you can&#39;t see the value in it  <br/>
for yourself, it won&#39;t be as easy to see it for your kids.<br/>
