<div id="ygrps-yiv-885824637">...sorry, the &quot;SANDRA!&quot; in your other post brings out the devilish in me. <br/>
You can now post to PAM! if you like.<br/>
<br/>
And please don&#39;t use the word &quot;we&quot; as you&#39;ve used it in the post below. You<br/>
can speak for yourself, not everyone here.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m glad when anyone, whether their name happens to be Sandra,<br/>
turns on lights for me. I am pretty sure that Sandra is grateful when people<br/>
turn on lights for her, too.<br/>
<br/>
Where is that poster I grumbled at yesterday for lecturing all of us on<br/>
growing up? I might have been too hasty in my cantankerosity.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, part of &quot;we&quot;<br/>

&gt;   I don&#39;t think we need you to turn on any lights for us, Sandra. Please<br/>
&gt; let people have their opinions and feelings without having to constantly<br/>
&gt; criticize them or &quot;correct&quot; them.<br/>

You are a absolute delight and I think quite a &quot;light&quot; all on your own. I <br/>
eagerly open your mail when I see it, knowing I will probably have either a <br/>
laugh or an Ah-ha. . . thanks girlfriend.<br/>
