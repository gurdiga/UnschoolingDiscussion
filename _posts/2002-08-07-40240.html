It&#39;s not about getting rid of the state-run schools (even though it would,<br/>
in the end, help everyone), it&#39;s about forcing people to pay for what they<br/>
don&#39;t approve of or use.<br/>
<br/>
In order not to violate other people&#39;s rights, the people who &quot;support&quot;<br/>
government schools should be the ones who do so financially, so that those<br/>
who do not approve of them would not be forced to pay for them, and could<br/>
afford to pay for their own choice of school (or not-school) for their kids.<br/>
As it is, the inflated cost of government school is creating the high taxes<br/>
that prevent many people from sending their kids to other schools. School<br/>
taxes force those people to pay twice to send their kids to school. They<br/>
force homeschooling parents to pay even though we don&#39;t use them.<br/>
<br/>
The argument about, &quot;It&#39;s so the poor kids will have schools...&quot; is specious<br/>
because the schools where the poor kids go are always the worst. They are<br/>
denied education and it&#39;s BECAUSE of the schools they must attend.<br/>
<br/>
Just today, on another list, came news of a new national poll about<br/>
vouchers. The results included the finding that HALF of all people who have<br/>
school age kids would accept vouchers in order to send their kids to a<br/>
school other than the gov&#39;t school. HALF think they would do better.<br/>
<br/>
Why should they be forced to pay for it? Let the field be level.<br/>
