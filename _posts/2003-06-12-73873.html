<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it takes a lot more courage to send children off to a place that has<br/>
such an abysmal record of meeting their needs.  As a homeschooer, I at least<br/>
know where my child is, what he&#39;s doing, most importantly, that he&#39;s doing<br/>
what he wants to do.<br/>
