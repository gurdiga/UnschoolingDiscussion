...<br/>
And I discovered that many of my agendas<br/>
(that I had felt were reasonable-certain chores, times for bed,<br/>
amounts of time on the Internet, how often they could go out with<br/>
friends for parties...) were actually draining energy from my kids&#39;<br/>
ability to conduct their own learning....<br/>
<br/>
 My 13<br/>
yodd was sitting at the computer reading Harry Potter and typing<br/>
IMs. I said, (can&#39;t believe it now), &quot;Honey, since you&#39;re not doing<br/>
anything, can you help me set the table?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She looked up and said, &quot;So you think reading a book and IMing<br/>
means I&#39;m not doing anything? Is that how you see it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Nailed! &quot;<br/>

Hi Julie B.<br/>
<br/>
LOL<br/>
Boy can I identify with this!<br/>
In our first year of homeschooling I was very intent on encouraging Jordan<br/>
to read more.  I remember one day saying (rather impatiently) &quot;Put down that<br/>
book, it&#39;s time to go to the library!&quot; That stopped me in my tracks and made<br/>
me reevaluate the whole &quot;school at home&quot; thing. What an eye opener! LOL<br/>
