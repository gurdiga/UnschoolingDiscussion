 </span></blockquote>Anna ( my 13 yo dd) and I were just talking about preschool and daycare the <br/>
other day.  I used to work in a preschool, and it was just like you describe. <br/>
  I loved being around the kids, but I HATED the &quot;make out your lesson plan&quot; <br/>
demands from the director ( who was really just operating under the command <br/>
of the preschool Board of Directors)   Anna and I talked about how totally <br/>
ludicrous it was to try to mold those little kids to such a structured day.   <br/>
We talked about ways to nurture and &quot;take care&quot;  of 10   2 yos at one time.  <br/>
How to handle &quot;nap/quiet&quot; time for kids who need and want to sleep and kids <br/>
who don&#39;t, meal times, outside time.. all the standard daycare routines.   <br/>
Anna had solutions and ideas that were so wise and sensitive to children.   I <br/>
said, &quot;Anna, you are so wise, you must have lived 3 lives&quot; .. :-) <br/>
<br/>
  I know that some parents have to work. They have to put thier children in <br/>
daycare. Everything   I have learned about children in my own experiences, <br/>
coupled with my recent embracing of unschooling, has confirmed to me that the <br/>
Montessori method of preschool/daycare is the best alternative IF a parent <br/>
has to put thier child in an out of the home child care situation.  My neice <br/>
and nephew go to a public Montessori school and they absolutely love it. If <br/>
they didnt go there, my sister would most likely homeschool.   <br/>
<br/>
As we discussed Montessori methods, Anna said that she wants to have a <br/>
Montessori preschool, and maybe even a Montessori  &quot;grade&quot; school, when she <br/>
grows up.  I am going to call our local Montessori school next week and see <br/>
if she can volunteer.  She is VERY excited!   <br/>
