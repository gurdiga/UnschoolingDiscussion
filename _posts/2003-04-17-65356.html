<div id="ygrps-yiv-272713305">Oooh, I just need to vent a little.<br/>
<br/>
We were supposed to spend tomorrow playing at the beach with friends of<br/>
ours who homeschool, but their oldest, Connor &quot;won&#39;t get his work done&quot;<br/>
and so they won&#39;t be joining us.<br/>
<br/>
I hate this!  First of all they are getting ready to move and the mom<br/>
had already told me that they would be stopping the school at home<br/>
bull.  Second, we hardly ever get to see them anymore because they do<br/>
school at home and are getting ready to move.  And third, we have been<br/>
talking about how much her kids learn during the summer when there are<br/>
no school requirements for them to keep up with and she still won&#39;t see<br/>
how well they would do with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I know not everyone can see it, I know it&#39;s a leap of faith for most<br/>
people, I&#39;ve seen how hard it can be for some people.  It still irks me.<br/>
<br/>
We are still going to the beach, we will have fun without them.  It just<br/>
would have been nice to share one of their last days here with them.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully we&#39;ll be able to play with them next week, but only if Connor<br/>
gets his work done.<br/>

and don&#39;t care.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That is too bad, especially since they are moving.  There are mothers like <br/>
that here.  At play group if a child doesn&#39;t get &quot;school work&quot; done they sit <br/>
there watching all the other children play while they do their work.  <br/>
Sometimes they finish and can join in and sometimes they go home and finish <br/>
there.  So sad to watch.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195087429">I will join you in that vent.<br/>
<br/>
We can never get together with other homeschoolers around here because of the very same reason.<br/>
<br/>
And it drives me nuts. They can&#39;t even get together for an afternoon of fun wihtout it having some kind of academic value.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Gawds I can relate to this. The amount of times things have been cancelled and kids disappointed cos another home-schooling child didn&#39;t do his &#39;work&#39;. Sunny days don&#39;t wait for work to be finished!<br/>
Generally I avoid the school-at-home types cos my kids (especially my middle one who is autistic and doesn&#39;t understand adults letting him down) get upset when a friend is coming to play and the parent<br/>
cancels over &#39;school&#39; work. I really fail to understand people who put getting bits of paper done over their kids enjoyment and friends.<br/>
<br/>
See, I&#39;m ranting now!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Last week, we were supposed to go to Discovery Place in Charlotte (1.5 hour <br/>
drive). My car&#39;s in the shop, so a friend was supposed to drive. Her boys <br/>
were grounded by their dad. They couldn&#39;t go. So we couldn&#39;t go. They&#39;re <br/>
&quot;relaxed homeschoolers&quot; (the mom is a former teacher, so the seven year old <br/>
had words to memorize every week/experiments to do/&quot;classwork&quot; and <br/>
&quot;homework&quot;)---but they never back off a &quot;field trip&quot; because of &quot;schoolwork&quot;. <br/>
They do it because of  &quot;groundings&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
They also spank and take things away from their kids. Bums me and Duncan out <br/>
a lot. Life could be so much sweeter---all they have to do is let it be. <br/>
Bummer.<br/>

 I&#39;ll help you.&quot;  But the mothers look at you like you have lost your mind.  <br/>
&quot;No, he needs to do it himself.&quot;<br/>

 I&#39;m 1 hour north of Santa Barbara and 1 hour south of San Luis Obispo,<br/>
 in California.  Right on the coast.  It&#39;s gorgeous here.<br/>
 (San Diego is nice too ;) ) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We so badly wanted to move to San Luis Obispo but decided we couldn&#39;t afford <br/>
it.<br/>
Moved to Florida instead. I love the beaches here SO much, but I still <br/>
daydream about that area of Cali. I have fond memories of visiting Avil and <br/>
Pismo beach areas.<br/>
Besides, John Anderson (of YES) lives in San Luis!! :)<br/>
I&#39;m envious of anyone living in that area. It&#39;s practically my utopia here on <br/>
earth.<br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
