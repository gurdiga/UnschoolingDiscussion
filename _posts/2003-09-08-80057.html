<div id="ygrps-yiv-795141893"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; It did look very expensive to me, too.  But if folks have the money<br/>
&gt; to spend and most folks have good reports on their child&#39;s experience<br/>
&gt; then it is up to them how they spend their money.  I know that when<br/>
&gt; we took a family trip to Europe when my daughter was younger it only<br/>
&gt; cost us about $4,000 for all three of us to go, to stay with hosts in<br/>
&gt; Servas host homes (a world peace traveler and host program).  And<br/>
&gt; that included airfare, Eurailpass, other train and bus travel in<br/>
&gt; Switzerland and France, Museum Pass in Paris, Metro passes in Paris,<br/>
&gt; and food.  But if cost is not a problem then this looks like a good<br/>
&gt; program.  Anyone else have any experience with this?<br/>
<br/>

names and addresses.<br/>

We get mail sometimes for Kirby just because of his age, I think, or from the <br/>
fact that we signed up for baby magazines when he was little and somebody <br/>
tracked it forward 14 years, because some go to our old address.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just going to people of that age, and not just homeschoolers?<br/>
