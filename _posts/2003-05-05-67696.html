<div id="ygrps-yiv-139793269">&lt;&lt;&lt;Virginia doesn&#39;t look kindly on kids out of seat belts!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to say Texas doesn&#39;t either, but I cannot tell you how many times <br/>
we see a car FULL of adults in belts with children crammed everywhere but <br/>
under the hood!  In our first house, we had really great neighbors.  It was <br/>
a multigenerational house from great-grandparents on down.  One of the girls <br/>
had a baby while we were living there.  I was out greeting the new baby as <br/>
they were getting ready to leave.  She has him all suggled up in his <br/>
carseat, belted in and ready to go.  As I was saying goodbye, she hopped in <br/>
the front seat, buckled up and placed the baby in her LAP, belted in his <br/>
carseat!  What the hell??  Sadly, it really changed my opinion of them.<br/>
<br/>
And to think, in Texas, as I&#39;m sure in many other states, our children ride <br/>
to school in school buses everyday without seatbelts!  They aren&#39;t even <br/>
there to have the option!  Laws are indeed strange...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269172651">I know you&#39;ve said you have a large family.  You must have a full <br/>
sized van in order for each person to have their own belt?  That&#39;s <br/>
one thing I don&#39;t like about seat belt laws--it can be restrictive of <br/>
people going places because they don&#39;t have big enough cars to buckle <br/>
everyone in.  I know I&#39;ve already not taken friends along to <br/>
activities because we didn&#39;t have enough belts, although we could <br/>
have squeezed 4 kids in the back seat of the minivan.  People with <br/>
large families might be stuck home much of the time because they <br/>
can&#39;t afford a full size van.  <br/>
<br/>
And besides that, there&#39;s the issue of freedom.  It&#39;s probably true <br/>
that seatbelts save lives--usually, at least.  I just think that we <br/>
should have the freedom to decide issues like that for ourselves <br/>
without big brother looking over our shoulder deciding for us.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think part of the argument is that it would be impossible for the driver<br/>
to help all the kids out of their belts if there were a crash.<br/>
<br/>
The other part is that buses just aren&#39;t involved in fatal accidents that<br/>
much.<br/>
<br/>
The government statistics on school bus accidents says in the 11 years<br/>
between 1990 and 2000 there were 55 accidents resulting in 83 fatalities. (I<br/>
suspect that&#39;s 55 accidents that had fatalities not 55 total accidents.)<br/>
<br/>
For comparison&#39;s sake, in 2000 alone there were 6,356,000 car accidents and<br/>
41,821 killed.<br/>
