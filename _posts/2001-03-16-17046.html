<div id="ygrps-yiv-456652231">I cancelled cable TV (due to finances), but it really limits what is<br/>
worth watching!  We get two fuzzy channels and dh is really the only one<br/>
who ever turns it on.<br/>
<br/>
This is just an idea.  &quot;Ignore&quot; your daughters TV watching, and spend<br/>
your time doing what YOU want to do.  I would love to have hours to spend<br/>
sewing or learning to play a keyboard or getting those Zoombinis to<br/>
Zoombiniville.  Mine are a bit younger, but I do find that they get very<br/>
interested in what I&#39;m doing - especially if it&#39;s something I&#39;m really<br/>
enjoying.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1223260667">Hi Marianne,<br/>
<br/>
I have to second Mary Ellen&#39;s advice. If I came down on my 13yo daughter with <br/>
some kind of limit on her television watching, she would be angry, and a wall <br/>
would go up between us, making communication difficult. It&#39;s hard to trust <br/>
that this boredom and TV watching will end. In my experience, it always has, <br/>
followed by a restlessness and search for some kind of new &quot;passionate <br/>
interest&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve probably already thought of this, but would Toni be interested in a <br/>
trip to town for interesting &quot;make-up supplies&quot;? I&#39;m thinking of her career <br/>
interest. Has she thought of writing to professional make-up artists for info <br/>
and advice (and connections)? Of course, suggesting something like this to a <br/>
teen-ager can be difficult. They don&#39;t want their mothers &quot;directing&quot; their <br/>
interests. :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642555712">uhhhhhh, Sandra?<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;your last post came through here fine.......<br/>
no html extra stuff,  words wrapped fine.....<br/>
what did it look like to you.   Maybe the problem is on the aol receiving end<br/>
not sending?<br/>
<br/>
Vicki---doesn&#39;t really know what wonky means but did not think it meant<br/>
normal.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

  Hi Sandra and everyone;<br/>
  I am just rejoining the list, after a hiatus, and I am not sure what problems you are having, but I *might* be able to shed some light on this. Recently, I had to switch back to using AOL 5.0 because one of the lists I am on rejected the messages. It seems that this version of AOL is sending out email messages in HTML and some receiving servers are interpreting the message as an attachment, and rejecting the message, if it is programmed to reject attachments. While I was using version 6.0, I would often receive messages with huge letters and other odd phenomenon. :) I have switched back to using AOL 5.0 and I am not having the problem anymore.<br/>
  Now...before the AOL bashing begins, the new Earthlink upgrade is doing the same thing, so some of them have had some problems.<br/>
   An introduction will follow in a seperate email. :)<br/>
  Regards,<br/>
    Sheree ( who still *loves* AOL after all these years) :)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696666805">Have her read &quot;The Teenage Liberation Handbook: How to Quit School <br/>
and get a Real Life and Education&quot; by Grace Llewellyn (sp?).  That <br/>
book was SOOOOOOO inspiring to me.  Then she can read &quot;Real Lives&quot; by <br/>
same author.  Great books.  Great books.<br/>
