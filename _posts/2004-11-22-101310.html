<div id="ygrps-yiv-1485837357">I joined UnschoolingDiscussion two or three days ago, but I was a <br/>
member last year.  I think I&#39;m on Sandra Dodd&#39;s website in the <br/>
unschooling a child with special needs section.  Our family <br/>
experienced a tragedy in January this year when our youngest, my 7-<br/>
year old son, died after a life-long struggle with a genetic disease.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter is 19, and a student at the local community <br/>
college.  I also have a 15-year old daughter, and a 12-year old son.<br/>
<br/>
I joined to ask for suggestions on ways to help my 15-year old <br/>
daughter.  Apparently, her friends from both public and parochial <br/>
schools are already discussing colleges and future careers.  I found <br/>
this out during a casual conversation in the car.  I was surprised <br/>
to hear her say, &quot;I know that I have to go to college.&quot;  She didn&#39;t <br/>
hear that from me or her father, but I think I know the source.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about it for a while, and my daughter summed it up nicely <br/>
but a little tearfully, &quot;How can I know what college I want to go to <br/>
when I don&#39;t even know what I want to do!&quot;  She&#39;s feeling &quot;immature&quot; <br/>
(her word) compared to her friends because she doesn&#39;t have any <br/>
career goals.  Anyway, I&#39;d like to give my daughter some information <br/>
about careers that do not require a college degree so she can <br/>
understand that she has options other than college, and I was hoping <br/>
some members on this list could suggest a few resources.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

On the flip side, I have an acquaintance who got all the way through a <br/>
prestigious college, then law school, then found out he didn&#39;t like <br/>
being a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
This is a great point in her life to learn more about the world and <br/>
about her own talents before picking a career direction.<br/>
<br/>
And I sympathize. Even when I waas 25, I&#39;d sit around and talk with some <br/>
of my closest friends about what their jobs were like and try to figure <br/>
out if I wanted to make a change.<br/>

Here&#39;s an essay on college that might help:<br/>

<br/>
Do you know anyone who has not been to college? Or who<br/>
went but ended up doing something else than what they<br/>
majored in? They might have some insight and<br/>
reassurance for her. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this will help or not, but I&#39;m a (fairly) recent <br/>
college grad who still has NO IDEA what I want to do. I was the kid <br/>
with the five-year plan all through high school and went off to <br/>
college and found I didn&#39;t like what I&#39;d planned...so I transferred, <br/>
changed majors, etc. I graduated with a degree in Anthropology with <br/>
another 5-year plan in my head...again didn&#39;t happen. I LOVED <br/>
Anthropology and am honestly very happy that I was able to study it <br/>
throughout college, but I doubt very much that anything I do in life <br/>
will be directly related to my degree - (although most of life <br/>
relates to Anth.).<br/>
<br/>
My father never finished college and has owned and successfully run <br/>
numerous businesses throughout my life - he found something he <br/>
enjoyed doing (video and radio production) and figured out a way to <br/>
make some money at it (not a lot but enough to live on). He&#39;s <br/>
currently running his own railing installation business and <br/>
transitioning back into real estate.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my point is that having a plan at 15 doesn&#39;t necessarily make <br/>
it any easier to get a job or have a life plan...If she&#39;s got an <br/>
interest I&#39;d suggest nurturing that - if she loves to read, maybe <br/>
explore careers in editing (there are a lot of freelance positions <br/>
that don&#39;t need a degree), write - explore writing or journalism <br/>
(maybe she can write an article for the local paper - get a teen&#39;s <br/>
perspective on something going on in your area), watch TV - see what <br/>
it takes to be a television critic or work with a local theater or at <br/>
the tv station. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of colleges have certificate programs - programs meant to be <br/>
taken by people working full time so they take place in the evenings <br/>
and weekends - that tend to be more geared toward real-world <br/>
application of interests and skills and not so much academia. (I&#39;m <br/>
going to take a Museum Studies one next year).<br/>
<br/>
I know it probably won&#39;t mean much to her to say don&#39;t worry about <br/>
it, but honestly, don&#39;t worry about it. As I&#39;m sure you know she has <br/>
plenty of time to figure out what she wants to do.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
