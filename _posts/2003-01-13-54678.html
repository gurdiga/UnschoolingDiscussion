<div id="ygrps-yiv-827427744">Just like in any area, there are women and there are men who are great at<br/>
either of these.  My dd has been doing hair for 4 years now, but way back<br/>
her first year whe was good enough that the professional make-up artist (a<br/>
man) who designs and does most of the make-up for the local community<br/>
theater asked for her on shows rather than some more experienced<br/>
hairdressers in the area (including one who also does movies with him).  He<br/>
also gets her to do any wigs they use.<br/>
