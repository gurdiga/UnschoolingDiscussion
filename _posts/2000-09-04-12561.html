<br/>
I usually just lurk here, but your wonderful post has brought me out of<br/>
lurkdom.<br/>
Thank you for sharing so much of yourself and your healing. As I read your<br/>
post I saw so much of myself there. I, too, was spanked (abused) as a child<br/>
and wonder about the connection and impact it has on my life and my<br/>
relationships now.<br/>
<br/>
I am an unschooling mom of three, 6yob, 2yog, 1yog and when things get<br/>
stressful I sometimes want to stop things with spanking. I hate it. I<br/>
believe no one deserves to be hit no matter how old you are, but it&#39;s so<br/>
ingrained in me to do so, I&#39;m constantly fighting the urge. It&#39;s very tiring<br/>
but it&#39;s a fight I&#39;m determined to win, for my kids sake. I know healthier<br/>
ways to prevent or stop unwanted behavior and most days I have no problems.<br/>
I just want to get rid of these violent tendencies altogether. I wish I were<br/>
never hit. There is always a non-violent solution.<br/>
<br/>
I will go out and look for that book you mentioned right away.<br/>
<br/>
And then I will look for a self-healing class near me.<br/>
<br/>
Once again thank you, I learned from your post and I know it has changed my<br/>
life.<br/>

Subject: [Unschooling-dotcom] response to Corallyn from Nicoletta (rather<br/>
long)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To be very open and honest Nicoletta, I am from an abusive family as<br/>
&gt; &gt; well. There was abuse left and right and I was the one who received<br/>
&gt; &gt; the brunt of the abuse<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Corallyn,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I empathize with you and what you endured as a child and teenager.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When I was about seven years old, one Sunday morning I got out of bed,<br/>
went<br/>
&gt; to my aunt&#39;s room and took a handful of change from her bedside table. I<br/>
&gt; went back to bed to &#39;play&#39; with the money. I basically just liked the<br/>
sound<br/>
&gt; of the coins running through my fingers; the thought that I might be doing<br/>
&gt; something &quot;wrong&quot; didn&#39;t really fully enter my mind. Then my aunt came up<br/>
&gt; the stairs, heard the sound of money and asked me what I was doing. I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; know why, but I felt myself contract when she asked the question and I<br/>
said<br/>
&gt; &quot;nothing&quot;. When she asked what it was I was playing with in my bed, again<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; said &quot;nothing&quot;. She came into the room and pulled the covers back to<br/>
reveal<br/>
&gt; the handful of change and asked me where I got it from. I don&#39;t clearly<br/>
&gt; remember, but I must have at that point realized that any further lying<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t going to get me anywhere and told her the truth. My aunt went to<br/>
tell<br/>
&gt; my grandmother.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Later that day, my aunt was sitting on the sofa in my room, I was standing<br/>
&gt; in front of her as she shared with me how it wasn&#39;t ok for me to have gone<br/>
&gt; into her room and taken money without asking. I could tell that she wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; angry, she just wanted me to ask in the future and because I felt a warm<br/>
&gt; connection with her in that moment I said to myself that I would never do<br/>
&gt; such a thing again, that I would instead ask her first as she was<br/>
&gt; requesting.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In that moment my grandmother quietly came up behind me and without my<br/>
&gt; anticipating her at all, she whacked me on the backside with a yellow<br/>
&gt; plastic carpet beater. Just once, but hard. I still remember looking at<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; red marks on me later that day. And as she whacked me she said &quot;that was<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; lying to us&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I cannot begin to adequately describe to you how utterly betrayed I felt<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; that moment, betrayed by my aunt for knowing  my grandmother was coming<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; not warning me. My connection with my aunt went to pieces, my trust in her<br/>
&gt; goodwill towards me was shattered in that very moment and never completely<br/>
&gt; regained. I felt enraged at my grandmother for being so &quot;mean&quot; to me as to<br/>
&gt; sneak up behind me and &quot;attack&quot; me like that. And I made an instant oath<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; retribution: that somehow I would make both my aunt and my grandmother pay<br/>
&gt; for how they had treated me on that one occasion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I did not make a consciously formulated oath, but my actions from there on<br/>
&gt; tell me, in hindsight that I did make the oath, even if unconsciously, and<br/>
&gt; that I carried it out on a daily basis by lying to and taking money from<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; aunt and grandmother at every opportunity; and making sure I would not get<br/>
&gt; caught.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Why am I telling you this? Because until a few weeks ago, during our first<br/>
&gt; couples&#39; group together, I had not made the connection between those<br/>
events<br/>
&gt; of my childhood and how they still affect my life and my relationship with<br/>
&gt; Fran (my husband) today: we have a major debt to deal with and we have to<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; careful how we spend &quot;our&quot; &#39;borrowed&#39; money, and yet I find myself<br/>
regularly<br/>
&gt; making purchases which are not necessary and which are above our budget,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; everytime I do that, I feel as though I am stealing, especially when I<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; inform Fran about what I am buying and why. Then a part of me waits to get<br/>
&gt; &quot;hit&quot; by Fran&#39;s reaction when the visa statement comes in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have, with Fran&#39;s help, re-created dysfunctional aspects of my<br/>
&gt; relationship with my grandmother for the purpose of healing those aspects<br/>
&gt; within myself. The rage and the sense of betrayal I felt as a child was<br/>
&gt; never healed and I keep re-creating situations in which I expect to feel<br/>
&gt; this rage and sense of betrayal which is related to feeling not cared<br/>
about.<br/>
&gt; This is where Fran comes in, because whenever my visa statement comes in,<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; just pays it off quietly without ever questioning me. The &quot;hit&quot; that I<br/>
&gt; always expect, never comes, and on some deep level I interpret that as<br/>
&quot;Fran<br/>
&gt; really doesn&#39;t care about me spending the money = he really doesn&#39;t care<br/>
&gt; about me&quot;. Then it&#39;s time for me to beat up on myself mentally to prove to<br/>
&gt; myself that I am not lovable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You see, when my grandmother hit me she was coming from a place of &quot;I am<br/>
&gt; doing this for your own good, because I care about you and because I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want you to grow up lying and stealing&quot;.  Well, with her method she<br/>
achieved<br/>
&gt; the exact opposite, and here it is 29 years later, and several years of<br/>
&gt; therapy and I am only now able to see the more subtle ways in which I<br/>
still<br/>
&gt; steal and lie about things, and the ways in which I equate love and caring<br/>
&gt; with getting hit (in some form or another).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Given my grandmother&#39;s history and the tools she had to work with, I know<br/>
&gt; that she truly believed she was doing me a favour and showing caring, even<br/>
&gt; though I did not experience it that way; and I am truly excited to have<br/>
put<br/>
&gt; these pieces of the puzzle of my life together, because now I have the<br/>
&gt; ability to choose consciously how I spend money and include Fran in the<br/>
&gt; process, rather than react out of my unconscious, and seemingly be unable<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; control my spending. And I see clearly that getting hit is not the same as<br/>
&gt; being loved and cared about. I &quot;knew&quot; that already, but some part of me<br/>
deep<br/>
&gt; down inside didn&#39;t feel it that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was my own personal experience and not at all like your experience<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; your son in the mall. My point however is that even one single event such<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; this one can have long lasting effects. In no way was I ever intending to<br/>
&gt; imply that you are &quot;a child abuser&quot;, just as my grandmother wasn&#39;t. She<br/>
&gt; really believed she was doing me a favour and teaching me a lesson. Her<br/>
&gt; method did not work, but I know absolutely for sure, that my aunts method<br/>
&gt; (of simply connecting with me at the heart level and asking for what she<br/>
&gt; needed from me) would have worked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This brings me to your question:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am curious as to some of the things you have learned in your class<br/>
&gt; &gt; with DH. How have you come to terms and found common ground with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; differences you have in your childrenrearing techniques?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We have been going to separate circles (men&#39;s group and women&#39;s group) for<br/>
&gt; over a year and a half. On my own I began serious self-healing work about<br/>
&gt; seven years ago, Fran and I have been married for four years. In these<br/>
&gt; circles we focus on &quot;how is the past coloring and affecting the present?&quot;<br/>
&gt; For example I would get furious with Fran for losing his temper with &#39;my<br/>
&gt; daughters&#39; and getting into horrendous arguments with them. Through his<br/>
work<br/>
&gt; in circle, Fran has come to realize how much he is like his own father and<br/>
&gt; grandfather, when he loses his temper like that and how much it hurt him<br/>
as<br/>
&gt; a little boy, to be reduced to tears by his father&#39;s angry voice, how<br/>
&gt; terrified he would be of his dad, how he would always have to keep his<br/>
radar<br/>
&gt; going to find out what kind of mood dad was in, if it was safe to speak.<br/>
&gt; Acknowledging how he was doing the same thing to our kids was not easy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However: since Fran has made a conscious effort to control his temper with<br/>
&gt; the children, I have been faced with an underlying reason for Fran&#39;s<br/>
anger:<br/>
&gt; he was watching my daughters treat me like their slave in many respects,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; he was furious at them for treating me that way. What he did not realize<br/>
&gt; that I had &quot;trained&quot; them to treat me that way, out of my own guilt for<br/>
&gt; leaving their father, etc. Whenever he would yell at them for something I<br/>
&gt; would immediately focus on his anger and so not be able to see what was<br/>
&gt; really going on. He was overreacting to their behaviours precisely because<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was underreacting. Once he stopped overreacting the intensity between my<br/>
&gt; daughters and myself was allowed to surface and was brought face to face<br/>
&gt; with my &quot;slave&quot;. There came a point where decided &quot;enough is enough&quot; and I<br/>
&gt; began to take steps to move out of that role with my kids.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The circle helped us in this particular issue by helping Fran to stop<br/>
&gt; overreacting to my girls while at the same time expressing to me how he<br/>
felt<br/>
&gt; when they treated me like their slave. Circle helped Fran to express his<br/>
&gt; feelings in an authentic, non-blaming, non-judgemental kind of way, which<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; was able to hear. And eventually it sunk in and I felt motivated for my<br/>
own<br/>
&gt; sake to do something about it. Since then I have been able to be a lot<br/>
&gt; clearer about what my boundaries are, when I mean &quot;no&quot; and stick to it,<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; behaviours are not acceptable to me, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Circle helps Fran and I to look at where certain reaction really come<br/>
from.<br/>
&gt; The more intensely we react to something, the older the trigger, meaning<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; further back into our own childhood we need to go to see what aspect of us<br/>
&gt; is needing healing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Circle helps us to truly dialogue about issues, rather than discuss or<br/>
&gt; argue. &quot;discussion&quot; is when everybody talks and no one really listens to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; other(s); everybody has their own opinions to defend. &quot;Dialogue&quot; on the<br/>
&gt; other hand, is when people really open up their whole being to receive<br/>
what<br/>
&gt; someone else is saying, taking what has been said inside themselves to<br/>
&gt; diligently examine if there is any objective Truth to be found in what the<br/>
&gt; other person is saying, acknowledging that Truth (if there is any) to<br/>
&gt; everyone and then sharing their own experience on the topic while everyone<br/>
&gt; else really listens in return.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is a book about this called &quot;On Dialogue&quot; by David Bohm. It is<br/>
&gt; required reading for the circles I belong to. Decisions are arrived at by<br/>
&gt; consensus through this process of sharing an experience/ opinion, the<br/>
others<br/>
&gt; suspending all judgement and really listening and then sharing their<br/>
&gt; experience in return. (i did not do this in my first post responding to<br/>
your<br/>
&gt; first post - I am not perfect at this yet, my emotions took over and I<br/>
&gt; reacted instead).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I quote David Bohm: &quot;&#39;dialogue&#39; comes from the Greek word &#39;dialogos&#39;.<br/>
&gt; &#39;Logos&#39; means &quot;the word&quot;. And &#39;dia&#39; means &quot;through&quot; - it doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
&quot;two&quot;.<br/>
&gt; A dialogue can be among any number of people, not just two. Even one<br/>
person<br/>
&gt; can have a sense of dialogue within himself, if the spirit of the dialogue<br/>
&gt; is present. The picture or image that this derivation suggests is of a<br/>
&gt; &#39;stream of meaning&#39; flowing among and through us and between us. This will<br/>
&gt; make possible a flow of meaning in the whole group, out of which may<br/>
emerge<br/>
&gt; some new understanding. It&#39;s something new, which may not have been in the<br/>
&gt; starting point at all. It&#39;s something creative. And this shared meaning is<br/>
&gt; the &quot;glue&quot; or &quot;cement&quot; that holds people and societies together.<br/>
&gt; Contrast this with the word &quot;discussion&quot;, which has the same root as<br/>
&gt; &quot;percussion&quot; and &quot;concussion&quot;. It really means to break things up. It<br/>
&gt; emphasizes the idea of analysis, where there may be many points of view,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; where everybody is presenting a different one - analyzing and breaking up.<br/>
&gt; That obviously has its value, but it is limited, and it will not get us<br/>
very<br/>
&gt; far beyond our various points of view. Discussion is almost like a<br/>
ping-pong<br/>
&gt; game, where people are batting the ideas back and forth and the object of<br/>
&gt; the game is to win or to get points for yourself. Possibly you will take<br/>
up<br/>
&gt; somebody else&#39;s ideas to back up your own - you may agree with some and<br/>
&gt; disagree with others - but the basic point is to win the game. That&#39;s very<br/>
&gt; frequently the case in a discussion. In a dialogue however, nobody is<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; to win. Everybody wins, if anybody wins. There is a different sort of<br/>
spirit<br/>
&gt; to it. In a dialogue there is no attempt to gain points, or to make your<br/>
&gt; particular view prevail. Rather, whenever any mistake is discovered on the<br/>
&gt; part of anybody, everybody gains.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s a situation called win-win, whereas the other game is win-lose - if I<br/>
&gt; win, you lose. But a dialogue is something more of a common participation,<br/>
&gt; in which we are not playing a game against each other, but &#39;with&#39; each<br/>
&gt; other. In a dialogue, everybody wins.&quot;  end of quote<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So whenever an issue arises, be it over the children, how to spend money,<br/>
&gt; how much (or little) intimacy there is between us - whatever the case may<br/>
&gt; be - circle is teaching us to use certain tools, such as: dialogue,<br/>
telling<br/>
&gt; our microscopic truth while breathing deeply (diaphragmatically),<br/>
&gt; acknowledging ourselves and each other for being truthful and taking 100%<br/>
&gt; response-ability for our own experience (= no blaming the other for how we<br/>
&gt; ourselves are feeling or perceiving something). Sometimes we get so deeply<br/>
&gt; triggered that we need help in the moment. Then we get on the phone.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t know if this answers your question, but in closing I would like to<br/>
&gt; share with you something else we learned in self-healing circles: how to<br/>
&gt; create a relationship vision and how to work towards living that vision.<br/>
And<br/>
&gt; here is our (incomplete) relationship vision:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; FRAN & NICOLETTA&#39;S RELATIONSHIP VISION<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PURPOSE:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ø To co-create a co-committed, mutually fulfilling, loving, conscious<br/>
&gt; marriage and to clear out of the way all obstacles to this end.<br/>
&gt; Ø To bring Harmony into our family life<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; PRIME DIRECTIVE:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To focus on deepening our connection:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ø to the state of being in Love<br/>
&gt; Ø to our own Essence<br/>
&gt; Ø to each other, Essence to Essence,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; before anything else and to come back to this focus as quickly as possible<br/>
&gt; whenever we notice feeling &quot;out&quot; of Love, in reaction or disconnected from<br/>
&gt; each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; INTENTIONS/AGREEMENTS:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ø We read our relationship vision often, preferably together<br/>
&gt; Ø We give and receive touch/holding every day<br/>
&gt; Ø We do whatever we need to feel connected before going to bed<br/>
&gt; Ø We express our authentic sexuality in mutually satisfying, healthy,<br/>
loving<br/>
&gt; ways<br/>
&gt; Ø We share our thoughts, feelings and fantasies with each other in<br/>
uplifting<br/>
&gt; ways (Truth with Love)<br/>
&gt; Ø We listen to each other and hear each other<br/>
&gt; Ø We acknowledge each other frequently and unconditionally<br/>
&gt; Ø We share withholds with each other as close to the moment as possible<br/>
&gt; Ø We gently remind each other to stroke and to breathe deeply<br/>
&gt; (diaphragmatically)<br/>
&gt; Ø We have fun together in and out of the house<br/>
&gt; Ø We resolve conflict through dialogue and process, always striving for<br/>
&gt; win/win solutions<br/>
&gt; Ø We support each other to reach our highest potential in all areas of our<br/>
&gt; lives<br/>
&gt; Ø We honour each other&#39;s need for closeness and time apart<br/>
&gt; Ø We create financial abundance in our lives<br/>
&gt; Ø We make decisions together through process and dialogue<br/>
&gt; Ø We keep our agreements with each other<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As parents:<br/>
&gt; Ø We focus on deepening our connection with the children (Being to Being)<br/>
&gt; before anything else and support each other in this<br/>
&gt; Ø We take 100% responsibility for our experience around the children<br/>
&gt; especially when something they did or said triggered a reaction inside us<br/>
&gt; Ø We are loving, patient, respectful towards the children<br/>
&gt; Ø We have fun with the children<br/>
&gt; Ø We keep our agreements with the children<br/>
&gt; Ø We make important decisions together, involving the children in the<br/>
&gt; process when it is appropriate<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Behaviours and Thought Pattern/Scripts, which interfere with our Vision:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Ø Withholding microscopic Truth in the moment for fear of getting reaction<br/>
&gt; back<br/>
&gt; Ø Taking on projections and identifying with scripts which correspond to<br/>
&gt; projections<br/>
&gt; Ø Withdrawing<br/>
&gt; Ø Blaming<br/>
&gt; Ø Projecting longing for a parenting onto each other unconsciously<br/>
&gt; Ø Waiting and wanting to be taken care of by the other instead of being<br/>
&gt; clear and expressing our needs and wants directly<br/>
&gt; Ø Triangulating<br/>
&gt; Ø Losing our temper with the children and/or each other<br/>
&gt; Ø Getting defensive<br/>
&gt; Ø Expecting to be abandoned emotionally<br/>
&gt; Ø Despairing and resigning to the way things are (&quot;it&#39;s no use&quot;)<br/>
&gt; Ø Harbouring resentments<br/>
&gt; Ø Criticizing/correcting without acknowledgement (Truth without Love)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;THE NEW RELATIONSHIP<br/>
&gt; MALE (FEMALE)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The King (Queen) in me aligns with the Queen (King) in you,<br/>
&gt; That the Kingdom will flourish and prosper.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Priest (Priestess) in me worships the God in you,<br/>
&gt; That the God in all may awaken.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Scholar in me learns from the Teacher in you,<br/>
&gt; That Truth may illuminate the darkness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Artist in me dances to the Music in you,<br/>
&gt; In joyful expression of Loving.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Father (Mother) in me unites with the Mother (Father) in you,<br/>
&gt; To birth Humanity&#39;s freedom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Merlin in me melds with the Merlin in you,<br/>
&gt; Through the Alchemy of Oneness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Warrior in me stands with the Warrior in you,<br/>
&gt; For mutual Cause and protection.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; From &quot;Master Angelic Transmissions -<br/>
&gt; Awakening To Our Greater Birth&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; by Michelle Andersen&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some people may not think all this appropriate for an un-schooling list; I<br/>
&gt; believe however that it all is appropriate, because where else are<br/>
children<br/>
&gt; going to learn these things if not at home from us - their parents.<br/>
