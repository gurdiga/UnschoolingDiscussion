<div id="ygrps-yiv-491771393">Hi Tracy,<br/>
<br/>
Please explain how/why stevia is illegal in G.B.?  Just curious as I&#39;m <br/>
starting to use a bit a friend supplied to me.  By the way, what kind of<br/>
product is it?  Is it a root?  Leaf?  Berry?  Where does it come from? <br/>
Here in Canada it&#39;s not altogether common.  I had never heard of the<br/>
stuff before...Will we get high?  Yikes!  Pardon my ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; That&#39;s interesting, since apparently stevia&#39;s illegal over here, we can&#39;t <br/>
buy seeds for it.  Nothing to do with the sugar growers and Nutrasweet <br/>
company at all...<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

supplement.  ~Karen</div>

        Hi--  stevia is a plant native to S. America.  It comes from <br/>
Paraguay, I think.  It has been used around many parts of the world for <br/>
hundreds of years in cooking, but never has been  well known in North America <br/>
outside of those  involved with herbal sweeteners and in the health food <br/>
businesses.  A woman who owns a health food store near me for the last 25 yrs <br/>
says that the FDA is now approving stevia, finally.  Another health food <br/>
owner told me that the FDA has said it is unsure if stevia could maybe cause <br/>
sterility.  She thought that was pretty funny.  There are stevia websites <br/>
that offer pretty complete information, too, and offer some other info as to <br/>
the delay of stevia getting approval:  like the manufacturer of Nutrasweet, <br/>
that pumps mega $ into the FDA, standing in the way of the approval for <br/>
financial reasons (of course).    I just went into   the  About.com, and <br/>
searched for articles on stevia.  If you get a chance, you might  look into <br/>
it sometime.                                                                    <br/>
