<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940362811">Well,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to sell them to the banshees but that didn&#39;t work :-(.  The banshees gave them back.  Really, it was the biggest hassle!  Never make a deal with banshees; not only do they renege, but they don&#39;t give you your money back.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt; yes the kids fight. Sometimes worse then others.  But they also love each other like crazy. I don&#39;t know if it is the ideal, but I do think it is fairly the norm for children, especially when they are together frequently, to get into fights, and I&#39;m begining to wonder if it isn&#39;t our fear of anger that makes us want to end it now, quickly, and have them *play nice* or act nice with each other that doesn&#39;t actually cause the big fights in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, telling them to sort it out on their own, especially when there is a large gap in age, or abilities (verbal or physical) isn&#39;t exactly right either.<br/>
<br/>
So I sympathise, but haven&#39;t quite found the solution yet...<br/>
<br/>
be well,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-937073101">Well my kids are 16,7,6 and 2. The 16 and 2 year olds don&#39;t fight with <br/>
anyone. The 6 and 7 year olds only fight amongst themselves. So I guess <br/>
we&#39;re not too bad!My oldest daughter has a friend who has a brother who is a <br/>
little over 3. She fights with him and my daughter is amazed how a 16 year <br/>
old can fight with a 3 year old. Not sure if it&#39;s how things are handled or <br/>
just the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if you two spend any time with each other just hanging out <br/>
and having fun? I know my daughter takes plenty of time during the course of <br/>
a month (it&#39;s sporadicx with her schedule) to play with the kids. She can <br/>
get just as silly as they can and they love it. She also spends time with <br/>
them or just allows them to hang out in her room, even when her friends are <br/>
over or her boyfriend is here. When she does want time alone with her <br/>
friends or just herself, they are very willing to leave. I&#39;m thinking maybe <br/>
if she wouldn&#39;t involve them in her life so much, they would be more likely <br/>
to pester her for the attention and she more likely to resent them intruding <br/>
on her time and space.<br/>
<br/>
I know if some time has gone by and the kids are asking her to play with <br/>
them and she doesn&#39;t have the time, I&#39;ll just remind her how important it is <br/>
for them and she will then find time in the next day or so to do something <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe just trying to explain to your oldest how a 7 year old works and what <br/>
he would like from a big sister. Just do it when she&#39;s not mad at him. I <br/>
know my oldest likes the idea that she can be a good influence on her <br/>
younger siblings. Of course she has a big sister too, so she knows how it <br/>
feels when you get that kind of attention.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260417907">Heidi,<br/>
    Welcome to unschooling. :-) One thing I&#39;d like to say is all that time<br/>
your kids were in school they could avoid facing and working out fights.<br/>
They could walk out the door and it wold be over. When they got home<br/>
well...it was buried<br/>
    Sibling Rivalry by Faber & Mazlish was really good for me. It helped me<br/>
find words to use and actions to take to help. Please don&#39;t think your 15yo<br/>
should know how or do better or understand more than you7yo. She may but<br/>
conflict is brushed over until explosion in schools. Let alone at home were<br/>
we are shuffling from one activity to another, homework, dinner, & bedtime.<br/>
    My three are 4 and almost 5 yrs apart in age. Very different kids. They<br/>
work out their problems most of the time without me now but we&#39;ve been home<br/>
now for 7yrs. I really love the one of &quot;he looked at me&quot;. LOL! Humor can be<br/>
a helping hand at times too.<br/>
    I&#39;m sure you will get some great tips and pointer here. I know I have<br/>
over the years. Oh and get that book from your library. How To Talk.. is<br/>
another one from these authors. Similar to Sibling but I enjoyed and learned<br/>
ideas from both. :-) I still work at it and I re-read them every so often.<br/>
Good luck to you and yours.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve found it is helpful to offer them alternatives so that they have <br/>
other models to choose from in the future. So if I come upstairs and <br/>
my son is saying &quot;She hit me&quot;, I might say to my daughter &quot;It looks <br/>
like maybe you wanted to get M.&#39;s attention. You can tell him &#39;I&#39;d <br/>
like to play with you&#39; or &#39;Can we do something together?&#39;&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I remember reading somewhere (maybe the excellent book &quot;Easy to Love, <br/>
Difficult to Discipline&quot;) that if you just tell kids to stop <br/>
something or change something without telling them how, it&#39;s like a <br/>
boss going to an employee and saying &quot;This report is all wrong. <br/>
Rewrite it tomorrow and make it right!&quot;. If the employee has no idea <br/>
what about it is wrong, they can never make it right. Likewise, if <br/>
kids don&#39;t have conflict resolution skills, or don&#39;t know how to get <br/>
a sibling&#39;s attention in a positive way, then telling them not to hit <br/>
each other isn&#39;t going to help anything. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get funny with my kids and say &quot;Let&#39;s rewind this and try <br/>
over&quot; and we do a funny rewind thing where we walk and talk backward, <br/>
then they try it again using the new skills. They think this is <br/>
funny, but then again they&#39;re much younger than yours (mine are 3 and <br/>
6). But still, giving them the opportunity to try again and change <br/>
their approach might work.<br/>
