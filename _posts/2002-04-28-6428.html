<div id="ygrps-yiv-494422034">I try to visit the unschooling.com message boards (though I&#39;m sporadic about<br/>
it). I am not currently subscribed to the unschooling.com mailing list, so I<br/>
don&#39;t know what the climate is there.<br/>
<br/>
I would not like to write off the AlwaysLearning list. Off and on, we still<br/>
have pretty good discussions here. But by all means re-subscribe to<br/>
unschooling.com&#39;s mailing list and if it is a good place to be, I&#39;d be<br/>
interested in knowing it!<br/>
<br/>
Bringing up a nice interesting issue here would also work for me. ;)<br/>

<br/>
Are the core posters from this list now posting at Unschoolingdotcom?<br/>
<br/>
What is your (collective) opinion on the environment at Unschoolingdotcom?<br/>
<br/>
If it is becoming a better place to be than it was, and writings there have<br/>
a greater exposure to more people, what do you think is going to become of<br/>
AlwaysLearning?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(But don&#39;t expect perfection. There&#39;s a lot of strong personalities.)<br/>
<br/>
And I do think it&#39;s just a natural lull. Even the busiest lists that you can<br/>
barely keep up with can hit quiet times.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the two lists in competition with each other, though they do<br/>
draw from some of the same people. AlwaysLearning has a different feel I<br/>
think because it tends to draw more long time unschoolers than newbies.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And bringing up chatting about unschooling and long timers. I have to say<br/>
that sometimes I get tired of talking about (gasp)<br/>
unschooling/homeschooling. That seems silly to say when I am on a list<br/>
about it. I don&#39;t mean chatting about expanding existing things or how to<br/>
handle things that can crop up with people who share your own basic<br/>
beliefs. What I mean is so often having to explain what you do to people<br/>
who are skeptical. Support groups and people new to hs always want to talk<br/>
to those who have been in this for a few years. I know that&#39;s<br/>
understandable and I can remember appreciating the people who talked to me<br/>
but just sometimes I get tired of having to defend or provide rationale for<br/>
the way we live.<br/>
<br/>
Of course when you nurse an older kid you get used to explanations:)<br/>
