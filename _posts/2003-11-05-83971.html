<div id="ygrps-yiv-1053944977">My name is Kate Jennings, and I homeschooled our two sons for eight <br/>
years, not  counting  the  years  from  birth  to  age  six!   I now <br/>
live on the coast of New Jersey with my husband in an empty nest! I <br/>
have had an idea for a book for years and am finally pulling it all <br/>
together!  The book will be a beautiful one; I have found nothing <br/>
similar in my search of books already published.  I am accepting <br/>
(very) short stories, essays/paragraphs (creative or instructive), <br/>
diary entries, poems, letters to and from family or friends, etc.   <br/>
Photos and drawings that tie in with the writing would be great -- <br/>
really, really great. The book will be a showcase of the talents <br/>
that homeschooled students possess.  Anything written by students <br/>
would be appropriate, whether it is descriptive, instructive or <br/>
creative.  Please keep in mind my plea for accompanying artwork -- <br/>
photos or sketches that relate to the written submission.  The <br/>
presentation of the writing in the book is very, very important to <br/>
me, and accompanying artwork is very important to the <br/>
presentation!   One of my favorite submissions is from a boy whose <br/>
family built their own home.  A photo and a sketch were included in <br/>
the submission.  This entry will be most effective!  Please email me <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306192693">Yes, this did come through twice. I don&#39;t want anyone to think Kate is<br/>
spamming the list with multiple postings. Sandra posted one for her and she<br/>
also tried to post. It was just offending my sense of order that the copy<br/>
was on the list and not the original so I let the original go through. So<br/>
I&#39;m responsible for the double posting, not Kate.<br/>
