<div id="ygrps-yiv-449794565">HI everyone,<br/>
   I&#39;m sorry I&#39;ve taken so long to get back on here with new information.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been gone a lot lately.  Not too much is new with his situation.  I had <br/>
a long discussion with the school district&#39;s Director of Pupil Safety and <br/>
Attendance, who is in charge for that district, but it didn&#39;t get anywhere <br/>
really.  He said he had no way of telling the D.A.&#39;s office to not press <br/>
charges because it was completely out of their hands.  He also said he would <br/>
be surprised if he actually had to go to juvenile camp for this because he <br/>
has seen others who had previous records just get probation.<br/>
   I feel like I should do something but it is difficult because I am 3 hrs <br/>
away from the town and his parents aren&#39;t doing much.  His mother is gone <br/>
almost all the time, not working, just gone with friends, and each time I ask <br/>
her if she followed up with a certain thing, she hasn&#39;t.  He is currently <br/>
back at home with them.  His older sister, who just turned 18 and is <br/>
finishing up her last year of home schooled high school, may be coming to <br/>
stay with us again.  She started home schooling a little over a year ago and <br/>
has really come a long way.  The family does have a lot of problems.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know if this sounds harsh but I don&#39;t mean it to.  It&#39;s just so frustrating <br/>
seeing the whole situation and not knowing how to really help.   The kids ask <br/>
for my help and their mom does also when there&#39;s a crisis but then she just <br/>
leaves it to me and her mom.  <br/>
     Someone, I think Joel, had asked for addresses to write.  The newspaper <br/>
for the town is the Antelope Valley Press.  If you want to do a search for <br/>
them on the Internet, they&#39;re there because I&#39;ve found them before.  I will <br/>
post their website and/or address.  I have contacted some other organizations <br/>
but haven&#39;t heard anything back yet.<br/>

Is Antelope Valley in Northern California?  I thought Lancaster was in Southern<br/>
California?<br/>
<br/>
I may try to write the newspaper.  It is frustrating when people most directly<br/>
affected by injustice are the least able to fight against it.  That however is<br/>
the nature of injustice.  Somebody with lots of resources would be down at the<br/>
court filing some kind of lawsuit against the school district, the police, the<br/>
teacher, and maybe the people in the cafeteria in addition to being on the local<br/>
call-in shows, writing letters to every elected representative,local official,<br/>
and newspaper. If that failed then pulling up stakes taking the kid and moving<br/>
from the damned regressive, repressive obnoxious, paranoid, sick twisted place.<br/>
<br/>
officious school people and criminal justice people alike pick only on those who<br/>
they can safely get away with doing so.<br/>

   Yes Lancaster and the Antelope Valley are in Southern California, just <br/>
north east of the San Fernando Valley, out in the Mojave Desert.  I agree <br/>
with your take on this whole thing, that they do &quot;pick their shots.&quot;  There <br/>
are so many things about this situation and the mass of related situations <br/>
that bother me.  I feel that there are elements of racism in the ways the <br/>
schools in this town are dealing with certain kids.  Lancaster used to be <br/>
kind of a hick town when my parents moved us there back when I was an 8th <br/>
grader.  Over the years, it built up.  For a while, many residents were happy <br/>
to see the subdivisions going in all over because it meant more jobs.  Also, <br/>
they were happy to see restaurants and malls going in so that they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have to go &quot;down below&quot; (local term for L.A.) for these things.<br/>
    The housing was a lot cheaper than L.A. so that brought a lot of people.  <br/>
Then the economy started crashing.  They were very dependent on aerospace <br/>
jobs so that was one big part of it.  Crime has increased a lot.  There are a <br/>
lot more Mexican-Americans and African-Americans.  There are also more gangs. <br/>
 Some of them are predominantly Mexican-American or African-American and <br/>
there are also a lot of skinheads.  There are a lot of people in the town, <br/>
particularly in the schools, who are very angry about this and have <br/>
stereotyped every kid in baggy clothes as a gang member if he/she is Mexican <br/>
American or African American.<br/>
    My nephew is Mexican-American.  They think he&#39;s some kind of gang-banger, <br/>
as they thought his sister was a few years back when she was in their school. <br/>
 They don&#39;t have any basis for this.  I know quite well what the true gang <br/>
style is and my nephew doesn&#39;t even dress that way.  He never goes out, goes <br/>
to parties, or anything like that.  He stays home almost all the time. <br/>
   I can&#39;t stand the way this town just throws away so many kids.  I watched <br/>
it happen to my best friend&#39;s son, who is now 19.  He was an honor student up <br/>
through 7th grade.  He found a knife one day at school and went straight to <br/>
the office with it.  He turned it in on his own.  He still got in trouble for <br/>
it.  My best friend, unlike my nephew&#39;s mom, is quite adept at arguing her <br/>
case and did so.  She explained to them that it was absurd for him to be in <br/>
trouble, that this would discourage him from going to the school authorities <br/>
the next time around.  It was useless.  <br/>
   I feel like I want to fight against this and yet sometimes it seems like <br/>
nothing changes anything.  I also do get frustrated with my cousin (his <br/>
mother, but I consider the kids my nieces and nephews) because she can&#39;t seem <br/>
to set aside her everyday all day trips to help him or the other kids.  It&#39;s <br/>
like he and the other kids have it bad from so many angles.    <br/>
    One side point I don&#39;t think I mentioned before.  I asked him where he <br/>
got the idea of the finger across the throat, if that was a common gesture at <br/>
his school or what.  He said no.  I said, &quot;Then how did you think of it?&quot;  He <br/>
said, &quot;I don&#39;t know...they do it on wrestling...&quot;  These kids have watched <br/>
wrestling for years because their dad loves it.  That even made me believe <br/>
more strongly that he was certainly NOT thinking of that as some kind of <br/>
death threat.<br/>
    I get so sick of all the injustices.  Sometimes it seems like they&#39;re <br/>
everywhere and just once (or more) you want to actually be able to DO <br/>
something instead of just rant and rave about it.  Anyway, thanks again for <br/>
caring and for your own anger at the whole thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1926878217">I truly think this kid&#39;s civil rights are being violated, not to mention human<br/>
rights.  Get some civil rights activists types involved.  I&#39;d do anything to try<br/>
and stop this kid from being ground up by a bunch of scared, ignorant, power<br/>
crazed adults. Something that you can do is start writing every elected<br/>
representative, every official, every newspaper, every youth and children&#39;s<br/>
list.  I would be happy to give editorial advice and work on the fine tuning of<br/>
whatever you want to write.  I would write amnesty international, prison reform<br/>
groups etc. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Writing is cheap and can be amazingly effective.  It lets the powers that be know<br/>
that you will be troublesome at the very least.  You will also find compassionate<br/>
sensible people in places where you wouldn&#39;t expect to find them.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know what you choose to do.<br/>

   Amnesty International is a great idea.  I hadn&#39;t thought of them but I do <br/>
admire their work.  I did try the ACLU but maybe I should just keep trying.  <br/>
I will forward some of my writing ideas to you and see what you think. <br/>
