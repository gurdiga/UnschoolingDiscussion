<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306923792">**Yeah, I think tests are a CROCK.<br/>
It serves to compare a person to other people, which I see NO point in<br/>
for <br/>
unschoolers.**<br/>
<br/>
Also, it compares them in a very one-dimensional, brief way.  And there<br/>
can be a lot of ambiguity in the way the questions are written.<br/>
<br/>
My husband swears he heard something on NPR that testing companies are<br/>
hoping to have *computers grading essay tests* with in a couple of<br/>
years.  Does this ring a bell for anyone?  I can&#39;t imagine getting<br/>
results that I would consider valid from this.<br/>
