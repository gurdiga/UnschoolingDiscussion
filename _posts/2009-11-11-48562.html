<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049937281">I would deeply appreciate your input!  I have 3 daughters, ages 6, 3, and 1.  I&#39;m having a tough time knowing what to do with sibling disputes.  I&#39;ve read all of the unschooling books I can get my hands on, and am still stumped.  My 3 year old grabs toys from my one year old.  Anything the 1 year old picks up, my 3 year old will scream, say NO!  You can&#39;t have that!  and take the oject from her.  If I try to reason with the 3 year old by empathizing, etc., she falls out in a full-blown fit, screaming and saying NO, NO, she can&#39;t have that.  This usually occurs about three times a day.  The old me (before my radical unschooling journey) would have put the 3 year old in her room (time out) and given the toy back to the baby.  I find myself just completely stumped... I&#39;m out of ideas.  The only thing I seem to be able to do is let the 3 year old have her way, and remove the baby from the situation while distracting her something else.  Since she&#39;s so young, I just pick her up, give her lots of hugs, and find a new toy for her.  (The 1 year old)  It just doesn&#39;t feel right.  I feel so horrible for the baby, and don&#39;t know how to deal with this.  <br/>
Please help!<br/>
Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900450653">When we were having a similar situation, we created a play space my DS (the elder) could get to that DD (the baby) couldn&#39;t. (We used a small play yard that DS could jump in and out of.) It was important to DS to have an area that DD couldn&#39;t access so that he could build, do a puzzle, draw without concern that she would &quot;mess things up.&quot; Once we did this, the tension between them lessened markedly, and the baby really didn&#39;t seem to mind at all. Both kids were happier and when they played together, it was much more gentle.<br/>

My first thought is that you could diffuse the situation by turning it into a game.  Let the 3 yr old grab the toy, hand a new toy to the one year old and just keep doing that.  Soon the 3 yr old will have a huge pile of toys.  If she doesn&#39;t keep them in her lap, you could start grabbing from her discarded pile to give back to the 1 yr old.  A big recycled toy pile.<br/>
 <br/>
One time my sister in law was seperating things into piles and my neice snuck up behind her and while she was grabbing from one pile, she&#39;d grab something from the other pile and sneak it back into the first pile.  It was hilarious and it took my sister in law a while before she realized what was going on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300216444">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the only thing that worked for me and my family. My son is now 5 and daughter 4.....17 months apart.  You&#39;re at the very beginning of a pattern you can radically shift now. I read a million unschool-y books too and this is the only thing that has truly helped.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read anything by Naomi Aldort yet? Reading her advice has propelled me into being the unconditionally loving Mom I am today. Here&#39;s several of her online articles to get you started.  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.naomialdort.com/discussion.html">http://www.naomialdort.com/discussion.html</a><br/>
Page down until you see &quot;Aggression&quot; and read that.  <br/>
Also on that page all the way down at the bottom is &quot;Excerpts from Naomi&#39;s Newsletter&quot;. Once you&#39;re there, page down and click on &quot;Sibling Hitting (October 2005)&quot; and &quot;When Children Fight (September 2006)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re on an awesome path of growth for yourself and your whole family! <br/>
Enjoy! <br/>
