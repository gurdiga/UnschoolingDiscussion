<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560244979"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; We have the usual games (checkers, chess, cards) and many common board <br/>
 </span></blockquote>games (Life, Scrabble, Monopoly etc), but are looking for something <br/>
cool, new, and different.<br/>
<br/>
Some of our favorites:<br/>
<br/>
Party games best played with 4+ people:  Quelf (hilarious!!!), Apples to Apples (or Apples to Apples Jr), Cranium (mix of trivia, pictionary, charades, and other party games)<br/>
<br/>
Strategy:  Settlers of Catan.   The regular board game requires 3-4 people to play.  If you want 5-6 people to play, you need to get the regular game + an expansion set.  There are also expansion sets for the game itself to add to the gameplay.  We love getting together with friends to play this game.  When my husband Ryan and I are at home, we play the Settlers of Catan card game which is for 2 players.  I like the card game better than the board game, honestly.<br/>
<br/>
Cards:  Zombie Fluxx.   Ryan and I play this frequently.  It&#39;s called Fluxx because the rules and goal of the game change while you&#39;re playing.  The zombies add extra fun in the form of anti-goals.  A similar deck is Monty Python Fluxx, if your kids prefer Monty Python to Zombies. :)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting something.  These days we play Catan and Fluxx mostly...  (except with our kids, but we&#39;re still in Candyland there.)<br/>
<br/>
Definitely check out BoardGameGeek.com.  It&#39;s a terrific site, although you can end up sinking a lot of time into it if you like games. :)  Games magazine also just published their &quot;Games 100&quot;, which has some interesting looking titles.  One of the best things to do would be to shop at a local game store instead of a toy store, if your area has them. (we have Uncles Games and some independently owned stores around here that are great for carrying top game titles that toy stores usually don&#39;t have)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100847200">Our favorite game overall ever has been Five Crowns.  It&#39;s a card  <br/>
game from the company that made Set.  You can google it.    We&#39;re on  <br/>
our third deck.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I don&#39;t like Life, Scrabble or Monopoly at all.  But I  <br/>
did see a Beatles Monopoly game at Macy&#39;s yesterday, and instead of  <br/>
streets, there were albums.  That might be fun for Christmas!<br/>
<br/>
Ravensburger is a company that makes some very good games.<br/>
<br/>
If you have kids who like mysteries and puzzles and deductive  <br/>
reasoning,  consider Clue or Scotland Yard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383882747">I really like this website for games:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.funagain.com/control/main">http://www.funagain.com/control/main</a><br/>
<br/>
One thing I love is that they break things up into categories (two<br/>
player, strategy, family games, etc.) and have recommendations in each<br/>
area.  There are also awards in those areas every year and they have<br/>
the award information.   They are a wonderful resource.<br/>
<br/>
Reading your list of games, there is a big area of games that you<br/>
haven&#39;t explored yet and that site is a good place to start.   Lots of<br/>
very cool German games that are very different from games like<br/>
Monopoly and Life.<br/>
<br/>
Some that I have enjoyed in the last few years:<br/>
<br/>
San Juan (2+ player version of Puerto Rico which is 3+ and is supposed<br/>
to be even better - but San Juan is GREAT)<br/>
Blink (quick little card game)<br/>
The aMAZEing Labyrinth (loved it as a kid and it is still fun now)<br/>
Bohnanza<br/>
Settlers of Catan<br/>
Queen&#39;s necklace<br/>
<br/>

I am thinking about Python-opoly for Christmas, looks fun.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tiny.cc/XPdx5">http://tiny.cc/XPdx5</a><br/>

<br/>
We have 3 versions of Scrabble, regular, special edition, and travel.  It <br/>
gets played weekly at our house... a while back Pam (I think) mentioned <br/>
Bananagrams.  I thought I would look it up sometime, then the next weekend I <br/>
was in Hastings and there it was.  So that game is going in Richard&#39;s <br/>
stocking for Christmas.<br/>

enjoyed a lot over the years is Rush Hour Traffic Jam by Thinkfun.  Although<br/>
it&#39;s a one person game, we always take turns and enjoy  challenging each<br/>
other.  We love a lot of the games by Thinkfun.  <br/>

<br/>
OH YES.  Definitely.<br/>
When I was writing, I was picturing someone going into Active  <br/>
Imagination (in Albuquerque) and asking for board game advice, but  <br/>
the pictures in my head didn&#39;t seem to translate into e-mail. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The games at toy stores tend to be more mainstream, less artsy.<br/>
Buying online is also a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve done well with thrift store games.  Once you know what you&#39;re  <br/>
looking for,  you might not have to buy it new.<br/>
<br/>
Labyrinth got a lot of play here when it was new to the house.<br/>
<br/>
Encore has been played a LOT, and I probably didn&#39;t think of that  <br/>
because I&#39;ve been playing it online (not as fun in writing as  <br/>
singing, but still fun!).<br/>

I&#39;m not recommending the website, it looks very expensive , it was just one<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572576170">We played KUDUUK today at park day - it is a great game, really fun.  <br/>
Simple - lots of interaction,  strategic thinking enough for the more  <br/>
serious game players, but not burdensome to those who are not so  <br/>
serious.<br/>
<br/>
I got it hanging in the toys section of the 99 cent store.<br/>
<br/>
However, there are two versions - the original version sold at  <br/>
Starbucks and is more sophisticated. The version I got was sold  <br/>
elsewhere and the rules are simplified (the game was bought by Mattel  <br/>
and they simplified it).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve played both and both are fun. I like the more complicated version  <br/>
better - but the simplified version is still really good and has the  <br/>
advantage of being quicker to learn so it works well for family get- <br/>
togethers and other spur-of-the-moment game playing.<br/>
