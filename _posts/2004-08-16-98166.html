<div id="ygrps-yiv-919755742">Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering something....<br/>
<br/>
I know there has been much discussion here lately about unschooling a child<br/>
with special needs, and why it is so beneficial to unschool in general and<br/>
also with children whom have special needs, however, I have been wondering<br/>
about something, what about unschooling for the reasons of the parent or<br/>
parents whom have special needs? How do you do it? Why do you do it? And how<br/>
do you strike a balance between your special needs and that of unschooling?<br/>
How do your children adjust to you being the one with special needs, rather<br/>
than them?<br/>
<br/>
The reason I ask this is that I have been recently diagnosed with two auto<br/>
immune diseases (Lupus and Antiphospholipid Disease) and I realize now that<br/>
what started out as unschooling my children for reasons that were so clear<br/>
to me of how their needs were not being met and how they need to learn what<br/>
they need to learn how when where and why they do, has become a mixed<br/>
blessing.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want my children to feel as if they are missing out on their lives<br/>
or learning all they want to in life simply because I am too sick to take<br/>
them somewhere or cannot play with them a sport etc....<br/>
<br/>
So, any thoughts and help on this would be great!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Patti<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982940682">Consider what a learning opportunity it is for your children to have a mother who is ill.  They will have an opportunity to learn about service and selflessness and compassion that many of us may never have.  I am not sick, yet still my children do not get taken everywhere they might like, nor do I play with them whenever they would like simply because there are other demands on my time and resources that prevent this from happening; rather than being resentful, they simply learn that one doesn&#39;t get everything in life all at once, nor do we always get what we want.<br/>
 <br/>
I am sure your children will be fine.<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck!<br/>
 <br/>

First stop looking at what everyone else is doing. There&#39;s always someone who&#39;s kids are taken everywhere, do tons of courses and build weather stations in the back garden. Will they grow up to rule the world? Probably not.<br/>
<br/>
I have multiple sclerosis, a child with cerebral palsy, no transport but I still unschool my older 3 (and the baby). About once in a month we get the energy together on a non-hospital day to go out. Last friday we went to the zoo. I was knackered as its a two bus ride journey. The rest of the time the kids do their own thing. They walk to the shops, go out on their bikes, play in the garden, play computer games, watch TV, make a mess in the kitchen while cooking, read books, play games, look up stuff on the internet, fight, squabble, fetch me cups of tea, sing to the baby, design super-wheelchairs for the baby, try and play the tin whistle etc etc.<br/>
<br/>
All sounds like great unschooling to me. Some of life is fun, some bits are boring. Learning to deal with both bits is vital.<br/>
<br/>
And the important thing...they are much happier than they would be in school having facts ground into them, being forced to play a sport they hate and having to pretend to me trendy or whatever to fit in.<br/>
