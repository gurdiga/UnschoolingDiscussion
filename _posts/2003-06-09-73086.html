Did you happen to open up Mary&#39;s Mr. Bean picture first?  Because when I <br/>
opened it I got a bunch of porn pop-ups too.  That better not be happening <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758665806">I just went to the farm (it&#39;s on my MILs property 5 min away) to get the kids, told DH about the Kyle - Mr. Bean connection and asked him what he thought.  He is so wonderfully innocent; makes him a great unschooling father.  He said &quot; I just wouldn&#39;t want Kyle to think it&#39;s a bad thing.&quot;  I said, &quot;How would he ever know?  Do you think there is any chance of him ending up at this list or someone&#39;s personal web site?&quot;  He said, &quot; No, I will tell him.&quot; (laughing at me for imagining it&#39;s a big deal to do so).  I think DH likes Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) so much that he doesn&#39;t see the possible insult, just doesn&#39;t even see it. (He was just concerned about comparing them as people.  WHAT?!  They are in diffent worlds)  I love that!  Though I will discourage him from passing this all on to Kyle.  I am afraid that when we see him again i will be exploding inside with images of Mr. Bean.  You have sooo cracked me up!  <br/>

he&#39;d probably slap me if I was pointing and guffawing and peeing in my pants <br/>

but thanx for these on Kyle C/Mr. Bean. They have lifted my spirits <br/>
tremendously.I have to agree this pic was much better, but the first one did make me <br/>
laugh. Wouldn&#39;t it be a hoot if Kyle turned out to be Mr. Beans son or <br/>
something. LOL<br/>
