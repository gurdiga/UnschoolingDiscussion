<div id="ygrps-yiv-1568274595">Hi and welcome.  I am new to unschooling also.  My name is Sandy and I am Mom <br/>
to Joshua 5 and Jordan 3.  We are just feeling our way through at the moment, <br/>
but things are going well.   The three of us just sort of learn all day and <br/>
if someone mentions an idea, we follow it.  My son asks me a question about <br/>
the different trees in our yard and why they were different etc.  So we got <br/>
some paper and a crayon and he make bark rubbings.  He collect the leaves <br/>
from each tree and also collected any berries or nuts the tree had.  We <br/>
talked about the differences for a while and bagged everything up so that we <br/>
can get a book or check online to identify the trees and find out more about <br/>
each one.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter likes to do everything her older brother does.  When I first <br/>
thought to homeschool  last summer I didn&#39;t even know about unschooling and I <br/>
had all the ideas of age appropriate lessons and so forth for my son without <br/>
even considering my daughter.  Of course I had no &quot;legal obligation&quot; to <br/>
school her.  Silly me so immersed in the ps way of thinking I had been <br/>
excluding my daughter from all my plans.  Then I found unschooling and <br/>
realize that she can learn too.  Duh!!  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is overwhelming and sometimes scary ( putting him in school <br/>
would have seemingly taken the responsibility of his education from me when <br/>
all along it was MY responsibility anyway) but always fun and always a <br/>
learning experience.<br/>
<br/>
The other day in the car my daughter said puh, puh, puh puppy starts with a <br/>
k.  Of course it doesn&#39;t, but it amazed me that she was realizing that words <br/>
are made up of sounds.  I did not sit down with her and &quot;teach&quot; her this.  <br/>
She just absorbed it by being around my son and me when we were discussing <br/>
letter sounds.  That experience really helped me to see that kids do indeed <br/>
learn naturally if given the exposure to learning opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and I look forward to learning the ropes right along with you.<br/>
<br/>
Sandy</div>
