dinner,etc..)<br/>
--it seems like all my posts are wayyy behind.......<br/>
Anyway, just a little brag--my middle daughter, Rene, just got a full time <br/>
teaching position at her dance studio! She was the first of my kids to be <br/>
homeschooled, and, after having a couple of office jobs, she finally gets to <br/>
do what she loves for a living!<br/>
I&#39;m so proud!!<br/>
