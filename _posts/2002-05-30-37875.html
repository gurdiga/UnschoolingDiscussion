<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405386605">| <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes2.com/">http://www.snopes2.com/</a> (Snopes uses java so I can&#39;t link<br/>
directly to the<br/>
| page. You&#39;ll need to type in &quot;daddy longlegs&quot; in the search.)<br/>
<br/>
Assuming you are a Bill Gates captive, you can direct link to<br/>
frames:  mouse over the frame you want - as in the results of<br/>
your snopes search and right click.  You will get a pop up menu.<br/>
One of the options is &quot;open frame in new window&quot;; another is<br/>
&quot;properties.&quot;  Choosing either will get you the direct link URL.<br/>
By opening in a new window, the URL will be in the address bar;<br/>
by choosing properties, you will get the URL in a gray dialogue<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
Right clicking is your friend - you can find out more cool stuff<br/>
doing that - it can even lead to a decision to &quot;view source&quot;<br/>
which is hands down nifty.</div>
