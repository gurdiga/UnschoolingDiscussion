<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693821909">I&#39;m sorry about this, but I&#39;m home alone with the kids, Jason is out helping my stepdad, and I just got a hour long reeming from my mom about how schools are different then I remember and how I&#39;m damaging my kids by keeping them from school and peer interaction and that Jaiden obviously has aspeech problem and if I knew what was good for him I&#39;d put him in school so he could get free speech therapy. I told her that we were commited to homeschooling (I haven&#39;t even tried to explane unschooling to her) and that no we don&#39;t sit down and do school every day. She told me that I was teaching my kids to be unable to function in the real world if I don&#39;t force them to eat when I say it&#39;s time and send them off to bed when I think it&#39;s time and all the other crap that I&#39;m sure you all have heard a million times from people in your life. I knew it would happen sooner or later, I just thought it would happen when Jaiden and Avery were old enough to actually GO to school. I feel, hell I don&#39;t know how I feel. I&#39;m angry and hurt and saddend by it all. I am a little scared of what she might do.<br/>

I&#39;m sorry about all of this I just didn&#39;t know where eles to turn. Thank you all for being here.<br/>

p.s on a happier note, I just started a local unschooling group, it&#39;s still in the early stages but as of yesterday(day 2 of the group) we were up to 25 members, I&#39;m so excited to think that ther are unschoolers in my area!<br/>

I remember when I began unschooling. My mom would continually tell me about the great school just down the road. I tried to explain what and why I was doing what I was doing and she ignored me. Granted my mom was not as vocal as yours is but my point is that 5 years later she is absolutely astounded by how amazing my children are. Self motivated, kind, strong, respectful in a way very different from a lot of kids she interacts with. Hang in strong because in my case it has been so worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Bravo to your unschooling group<br/>

Oh YES they DO!!!! :)<br/>
I think you must be looking in the wrong place or something Mary, cuz I&#39;m in <br/>
the all too conservative NW of FL and getting new people to our group every <br/>
week.<br/>
We have a workshop scheduled at the local health food co-op, an ad in the <br/>
local newsletter (of the major conservative support group--you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
believe how many we&#39;ve gotten from THAT!) and a &quot;Funfest&quot; scheduled for <br/>
September.<br/>
Maybe you could come?<br/>
Anyhoo, there ARE other radicals around, trust me.<br/>
I will check the LIFE affiliates for your area and see who is available. I <br/>
KNOW you aren&#39;t alone.<br/>

I hope she comes around, but even if she doesn&#39;t it&#39;ll be hard but I&#39;m dedicated to my kids and giving them the best I can, and that to me, is unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Bravo to your unschooling group&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, I&#39;m excited. I&#39;m really glad I decided to do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75763822">I&#39;ll post something that I gave to someone for legislators in our area of how we came to homeschooling. {They were collecting brief stories}<br/>
Tracy<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
~Both my husband and I have family members working in the school system. Because<br/>
of<br/>
this we saw many things that teachers and their co-workers wouldn&#39;t feel<br/>
comfortable doing in front of outsiders. We had open access to places such as the<br/>
teachers&#39; lounge and other places considered off limits to the general public. My<br/>
husband and I agreed, we didn&#39;t like what we observed. Despite that, we sent our<br/>
oldest child<br/>
off to school. She was only there for a short time.<br/>
Homeschooling has proven to be a wonderful adventure for our family. We spend<br/>
lots of time together. We communicate alot, and if they have a question that we<br/>
can&#39;t<br/>
answer we make it a point to look it up.<br/>
In short, we love them like no one else could and know we have their best<br/>
interests at heart. <br/>
