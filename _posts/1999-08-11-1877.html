<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332636435">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We are new to the list...and new to homeschooling as well!!<br/>
<br/>
I am a full time mom/teacher/chauffeur/referee *S* to three boys: Tim (10);<br/>
Jeff (8) and Doug (6) ....we also have our five year old niece with<br/>
us...Victoria is 5.  We began homeschooling Tim last February  (he is ADHD<br/>
and considered gifted...our school district had NO clue what to do with<br/>
him!!).  Hs&#39;ing went so well with Tim, that we decided to homeschool them<br/>
all!!<br/>
<br/>
We are planning to officially start in another week or so (my boys want to<br/>
start the same day as the public school...I think that is on 8/24).<br/>
Actually, we have &#39;schooled&#39; in a rather unschooling way all summer...lots<br/>
of reading, math and trips to the zoo and museums.<br/>
<br/>
Dh is a Carpenter, by trade.  He is also a CubMaster for our scout pack...I<br/>
am the treasurer and religious coordinator (Luckily, I was able to pawn off<br/>
the Candy Sale responsibilities on another family for this year!!).  I also<br/>
teach CCD at our church....I formerly taught 6th grade, but this next year I<br/>
am teaching 4th grade.  And, I have also signed up for two classes at an<br/>
area college this fall (Tuesday and Thursday evenings).  I am looking<br/>
forward to attending classes again.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really plan to use a set &#39;curriculum&#39;....I did get each of the kids<br/>
a math book from ABeka...but everything we are go to do on our own.  My<br/>
older two boys are in 4-H club...I plan to use their projects for a lot of<br/>
our &#39;school&#39; work.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, it&#39;s great to be part of this list!!<br/>
