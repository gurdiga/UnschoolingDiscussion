<div id="ygrps-yiv-169829350">From: &quot;Michelle&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:marriedtomony1991@...">marriedtomony1991@...</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I have alway been very careful of what I let my now 6 year old son eat.<br/>
It was never really a battle, just never had the &quot;good stuff&quot; in the house.<br/>
As we are slowly making the change to an Unschooling lifestyle, I am letting<br/>
go little by little.  My son had cereal, yogurt, and gummies for breakfast.<br/>
That would NEVER have happened before.  He did not eat till 10:30, and<br/>
breakfast time is usually around 8:00.  Now he is at the table eating<br/>
peanuts dipped in apple sauce, yuck!!!  This is lunch for him, again, never<br/>
before.  It is what he wants, so I am letting him have it.  I feel, now,<br/>
that he is making some healthy choices, and that is enough for me.  He is<br/>
happy and that is what really matters.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I borrowed this from the food post. All the unschoolers I have known have<br/>
been unschoolers before I met them. I haven&#39;t seen anyone actually *making<br/>
the change.* I know Michelle. I knew her before and after. For me, it&#39;s<br/>
incredible to see someone make such a change so quickly and get it. I&#39;m<br/>
seeing a different Michelle and a different son of hers. There&#39;s no good or<br/>
bad, just better. It&#39;s enjoyable for me to watch and in some way, good for<br/>
me too. The enthusiasm helps me with my parenting as well.<br/>
