<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921627954">Hello,<br/>
I have an 8 yr. old dd who is in first grade,and two other children at <br/>
home,13 yr. old ds(dyslexic,never been in government school)and ds <br/>
almost 7.<br/>
I need to clarify dd is in government school. She had been literally <br/>
begging me to let her &quot;try&quot; school so I did. I just cannot let her go <br/>
back next year,it&#39;s against everything I believe in concerning <br/>
learning/education.Here is where I need the encouragement. We have <br/>
always been *unschoolers* and I don&#39;t think dd is bent that way. She <br/>
loves workbooks and seatwork. She was literally driving me crazy the <br/>
past couple of years getting *bored* every time I turned around. Almost <br/>
like she couldn&#39;t entertain herself but was expecting me to. Constantly.<br/>
I can accommodate her with workbooks and such,but what about the <br/>
*bored* times? <br/>
Suffice it to say I&#39;ve experienced burnout just not knowing what to do <br/>
with her all day,every day. Do I need to add that she is very social?<br/>
The reason she likes gov. school so much is because of the <br/>
socialization issue.<br/>
I think I&#39;m starting to ramble now,so Ill sign off for now.<br/>
Blessings,<br/>

First, because of the workbook mention, I&#39;m wondering whether you&#39;re  <br/>
familiar with unschooling.  And you only joined the list this  <br/>
afternoon, and probably posted without reading the welcome e-mail  <br/>
that asks that new members wait a couple of weeks.  So please read  <br/>
this and other responses you get, read links, and hang out on the  <br/>
list a while before posting more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why would she have to literally beg to do something?<br/>
Why is she just &quot;trying&quot; school?<br/>
<br/>
It seems if she wanted to go to school, she shouldn&#39;t have to beg,  <br/>
and if she&#39;s going to school she&#39;s really going.<br/>
<br/>
If you make home more interesting than school and make sure she has  <br/>
opportunities to be around other kids (which WILL be work for you,  <br/>
but unschooling is work), maybe she&#39;ll stay home.  If you simply make  <br/>
her stay home because of what YOU believe, that seems problematical  <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
The worst thing about school is when students have no option or choice.<br/>
Some families make homeschooling just as bad, by giving their  <br/>
children no option or choice.<br/>
<br/>
If home isn&#39;t a more attractive choice, your daughter is making a  <br/>
good choice by going to school.  She SHOULD do what&#39;s interesting to  <br/>
her.  People learn when they&#39;re doing interesting things!<br/>
<br/>
Here are some ideas for making things more interesting:<br/>

<br/>
Burnout is usually a symptom of trying to do school at home.  If you  <br/>
move more toward unschooling you&#39;ll all be having more fun!<br/>
