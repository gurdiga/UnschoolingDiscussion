I&#39;de much rather &quot;fuck&quot; be avoided that &quot;practice, teach, lesson, chore,<br/>
routine, bedtime, command, NO, punish, text book, &quot;  Any more unschooling<br/>
bad<br/>
words that folks have been warned to avoid?    How utterly hypocritical to<br/>
complain and berate others who are uncomfortable with derogatory terms when<br/>
you dole out censorship on practical every day terms that do much less<br/>
&quot;harm&quot;<br/>
than calling someone a dumbass prick, even if it is behind thier back.<br/>
Curse and slang words dont bother me at all. My family and I use them when<br/>
and where ever we feel inclined to.  But, if the arguement is. &quot;they&#39;re just<br/>
words&quot; applies to some words, then it must apply to all. .. including your<br/>
no<br/>
no list for unschooling.  If more appropiate words can be used for the terms<br/>
that are inappropiate to unschooling, then surely, other suitable  words<br/>
could be replaced for the ones youve listed as &quot;bad words&quot; and made such a<br/>
fuss over thier unacceptabability by society.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I WIN THE POOL!!!<br/>
<br/>
I knew it would be less than an hour before someone without a spell checker<br/>
would use the current brouhaha to attack like a berserk flame-thrower.<br/>
<br/>
Now, to try (probably in vain) to inject a little common sense: nobody has<br/>
ever said anybody should not use the words: &quot;practice, teach, lesson, chore,<br/>
routine, bedtime, command, NO, punish, text book,&quot; on this list. If you<br/>
think they have, find me the post.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, we like to discuss such words at length!<br/>
<br/>
But it was a nice try.<br/>
<br/>
Pam<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I would much rather someone call me a dumbass prick than teach me to<br/>
practice my lessons after my chores followed by routine bedtimes on command<br/>
with NO escape from punishment if I didn&#39;t read my text book. But maybe<br/>
that&#39;s just me.<br/>
