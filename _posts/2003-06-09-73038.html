<br/>
The senses people use to help decide what to taste are sight and smell.  If <br/>
those two are not indicating that the food is appealing, shouldn&#39;t kids NOT eat <br/>
it?  But there&#39;s also a trust and experience element.  If something looks <br/>
freakish (like an artichoke) they might not naturally want to eat it, but if they <br/>
see others eating it and having fun, they might want to try it, one of those <br/>
times.  Maybe not the first two or three times.<br/>
<br/>
Are there foods you never make because you or your husband don&#39;t like them?<br/>
Be honest.<br/>
If your kids made you a plate of those things would you be willing to taste <br/>
each one?<br/>
If so, Why?<br/>
If not, why make them taste foods?<br/>
<br/>
It plays against their instinct.<br/>

&gt; Why put something on the plate they don&#39;t want?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t put foods on my kids&#39; plates that I know they do not like. <br/>
But sometimes, maybe at gramma&#39;s or at a friend&#39;s house, foods come <br/>
along that they&#39;ve never encountered. It&#39;s a matter of helping them <br/>
see that one taste isn&#39;t the end of the world. If they like it, <br/>
terrific! If not, they don&#39;t have to finish it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt; <br/>
<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t want them tasting every alcoholic drink at the bar, or <br/>
trying <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; every drug that comes along, would you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>different scenario entirely. Alcoholic beverages and drugs aren&#39;t <br/>
food. And my kids know the difference. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>kids NOT eat <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would accept one of my kids saying &quot;Please, none of that&quot; if <br/>
something were being dished up that absolutely didn&#39;t appeal. <br/>
Or, &quot;Just a little bit so I can see if I like it.&quot; something like <br/>
that. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s also a trust and experience element.  If something looks <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; freakish (like an artichoke) they might not naturally want to eat <br/>
 </span></blockquote>it, but if they <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; see others eating it and having fun, they might want to try it, one <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Be honest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are foods I never make because my KIDS don&#39;t like them.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t make a plate of my kids&#39; worst foods and make them taste <br/>
each one. Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a plate with a pork chop, a baked potato, <br/>
some peas and carrots, a spoonful of macaroni salad, and a peach half <br/>
on lettuce. Katie hasn&#39;t ever seen this macaroni salad before. <br/>
Everything else on there, she knows and enjoys to eat. She doesn&#39;t <br/>
think the macaroni looks good, but how will she know, if she doesn&#39;t <br/>
taste it? It isn&#39;t going to hurt her to take one bite, and she may <br/>
just love it. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If your kids made you a plate of those things would you be willing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>to taste <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; each one?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, I would. I do. I hate mince meat pie. It tastes just awful <br/>
to me. But every five years or so, I take a bite if there is some at <br/>
Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If so, Why?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In order to see if my palate has matured enough for me to like it. <br/>
(didn&#39;t used to like broccoli, but do now) In order to see if, this <br/>
time, I can figure out why mince meat pie tastes good to some people. <br/>
Like &quot;What do they see in this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If not, why make them taste foods?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t want them turning things down, just because they&#39;ve never <br/>
encountered them before. I want them to not be afraid of different <br/>
tastes and textures.<br/>

<br/>
Just FYI, the one bite rule has never been a power struggle. Having <br/>
them taste something new that one bite&#39;s worth, hasn&#39;t ever lessened <br/>
the family joyful atmosphere at dinner.<br/>
<br/>
But I do like the idea of tasting and testing in the kitchen. That <br/>
way, they&#39;ll know what&#39;s good or what isn&#39;t, before it comes to the <br/>
table!<br/>

thinking they would like something, then trying it, and liking it. <br/>
The first thing that came to mind was avocado. Katie didn&#39;t like the <br/>
looks of avocado, but one day when I was having a half, I offered her <br/>
a bit on a cracker. She loves avocado, now.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, Robby doesn&#39;t like avocado. He didn&#39;t like the looks of it, and <br/>
when he tasted it (I didn&#39;t force him. I asked if he&#39;d like to see <br/>
for himself whether it was any good or not) he still didn&#39;t like it. <br/>
But why didn&#39;t I &quot;make&quot; him taste the avocado?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m being inconsistent and it&#39;s ticking me off.<br/>
<br/>
Time to rest the ole grey matter awhile.<br/>

with a PhD.  LOVES to go for New Mexican food with me when he comes out here <br/>
to do special work for Los Alamos Labs.  He knows more about more things than I <br/>
ever will.<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t eat guacamole.  The restaurant we go to has great guacamole they <br/>
make tableside, fresh, but nope.  He says this terrible thing about even the best <br/>
of guacamole:<br/>
<br/>
Tastes like smegma.<br/>
<br/>
So rather than EVER have him repeat that to me while I&#39;m trying to eat, I <br/>
totally stopped ever mentioning it even a little, and if he gets a little <br/>
guacamole as part of what he&#39;s ordered, I gently remove it from his plate and eat it <br/>
smilingly.<br/>
<br/>
Keith my husband hates peas  Regular little green peas.  Will not have one in <br/>
his mouth.<br/>
My dad was the same with black-eyed peas.  Hated the smell, hated the <br/>
texture, said they taste like dirt.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in honor of those serious detestations, I&#39;ve reminded kids once in a <br/>
while they might want to try something since it&#39;s been a while, but never <br/>
pressed after they said &quot;Maybe next time.&quot;<br/>

I was never eally forced to eat food but I did eat things I didn&#39;t like just<br/>
to please my mom. Either way it was awul and at 45 I still have the memories<br/>
of it. I agree with Sandra. Just doesn&#39;t seem right to me to do. What&#39;s the<br/>
big deal to not try something?? There are many things I never tried and many<br/>
I will. One won&#39;t take away from the rest.<br/>

parents knew he didn&#39;t like it but they made him eat a small amount anyway <br/>
(dontcha know they&#39;re good for you?) He remembers gagging them down, I think he threw <br/>
up.<br/>
I never, ever put peas in anything he is going to eat.<br/>
<br/>
He also threw up when his Mom thought he was being spoiled because he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t eat an egg that had been cooked too long. He liked them yolky, and it was <br/>
solid.<br/>
He barfed right onto his plate. She never made him eat one again.<br/>
Too bad peace and emotional health weren&#39;t more important to them.<br/>
He might actually LIKE peas and hard cooked eggs today.<br/>
<br/>
I think about MY food preferences. I go through phases where peanut butter <br/>
sounds SO gross and then there are days I can&#39;t get enough of it.  Tastes and <br/>
cravings come and go, each person should listen to their own body. Parents that <br/>
want kids to try new things should simply get excited about trying new things <br/>
themselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1937302876">I have a similar experience.  My mother always made me just try things at relatives and on holidays and I never thought of it as a big deal but to this day when I think of childhood holidays especially over the relatives all I remember is *having* to try the squash and turnip again because I still didn&#39;t want it!   Amazingly I actually thought I was going to do this with my kids, I thought it was good that mom made me try stuff.   I vaguely remember trying to make my kids try things years ago but I couldn&#39;t keep doing it.

<br/>
&lt;&lt;I stand by my experience with having been forced to eat food that made me<br/>
hate that food AND made me not like my mom much either.<br/>
If others are eating macaroni and she sees them enjoying it, she might try<br/>
because she wants to.<br/>
And what if she never ever eats macaroni salad?  There are six billion<br/>
humans.  MOST have never eaten macaroni salad.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was never eally forced to eat food but I did eat things I didn&#39;t like just<br/>
to please my mom. Either way it was awul and at 45 I still have the memories<br/>
of it. I agree with Sandra. Just doesn&#39;t seem right to me to do. What&#39;s the<br/>
big deal to not try something?? There are many things I never tried and many<br/>
I will. One won&#39;t take away from the rest.<br/>

<br/>
YES!!!  By George  think she&#39;s got it! LOL  Okay, THIS is why making kids <br/>
taste just one bite is bad.  If YOU wouldn&#39;t touch the stuff and it makes <br/>
you sick, how would YOU feel if someone told you to try just one <br/>
bite...maybe your taste buds have changed....maybe this recipe is better!  <br/>
Come on, you don&#39;t have to eat it if you don&#39;t like it...(even though you DO <br/>
have to eat it to taste it, but whatever).<br/>
<br/>
So, it makes sense to you to not make them try things you don&#39;t like.  Does <br/>
it make sense to you to make them try things you do like?  Because really, <br/>
that makes no sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
I say, drop the bogus dinner rules, serve a wide variety of food, say <br/>
nothing about it, and enjoy the meal!  Maybe they&#39;ll try something new.  <br/>
Maybe they won&#39;t.  Maybe, if you don&#39;t make it such a to-do, they will have <br/>
fond memories of mealtimes in your home and think of food as comforting and <br/>
nourishing and will naturally want to try new things on their own.  Maybe, <br/>
if food is attached to so many rules and pressure, they will learn to like <br/>
new things at the expense of finding mealtimes draining and only a necessary <br/>
aside.  Maybe they&#39;ll want to go to their friends houses for meals instead <br/>
of wanting their friends over at yours. &lt;beg&gt;<br/>

I would say &quot;If you don&#39;t like it you can spit it in my hand,&quot; and would hold <br/>

Marty spit stuff in my hand three or four times.  Kirby  maybe once.  Holly, <br/>
I don&#39;t remember.  But I was serious and they knew it.<br/>

I made the same offer to adult friends a few times in those days.  They <br/>

SO!  Maybe every time you&#39;re tempted to say &quot;Go on, taste it!&quot; picture a <br/>
seven-year-old you facing a bowl of rice pudding, with tears welling up in your <br/>
eyes and your throat tightening. <br/>

Hey, messed up or not, they can come to dinner at my house!  I might even <br/>
force them to eat something gross just to see them throw up on my table!  <br/>
We&#39;d all die laughing!<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait, I&#39;m going against my principles here, just for a laugh!<br/>
<br/>
I think they sound great!<br/>

person I must have been. Why didn&#39;t I just say NO!?&quot; But I <br/>
realized that I had been trained to &quot;respect adults&quot; and to &quot;not <br/>
make a scene.&quot; Is that really what we want for our kids? I had no <br/>
sense of my own power.<br/>
<br/>
And then I realized that I absolutely *don&#39;t* want that for our kids. <br/>
In fact, I&#39;ve gone out of my way to support them when they&#39;ve tried <br/>
to express outrage or frustration because I so don&#39;t want them <br/>
&quot;bending over&quot; for obnoxious people--adults, kids, spouse or <br/>
otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve got great kids, Sandra. And I&#39;m pretty sure they won&#39;t be in <br/>
the Koolaid drinking crowd. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Depends on how you fix them, I&#39;ve had some that taste like dirt, or worse, <br/>
and some that were yummy!  Thus you run the risk when you eat others cooking.  <br/>
Out of all my family I am probably the pickiest eater.  I really dislike eating <br/>
out because I have all these thoughts about how clean was the kitchen, did <br/>
the cook or food prep or even the food handlers pick their noses or scratch <br/>
their butts?<br/>
<br/>
Some people don&#39;t really &quot;cook&quot; they open packages or cans and serve food and <br/>
that&#39;s fine too, I guess, as long as I don&#39;t have to eat it.<br/>

No problem.  Marty would probably oblige you.<br/>
<br/>
He puked Thursday of the police academy stuff, because he was kinda sick and <br/>
they did too much rolling over and upside down stuff.  Friday night I met one <br/>
of the girls he had talked about most.  I asked him whether he had taken any <br/>
more photos (he had taken ONE), and he said no.  I asked her if anyone had <br/>
taken a picture of Marty throwing up.  She didn&#39;t think it was funny.  That was <br/>
okay.  I think it was compassion for Marty, rather than just no sense of humor.  <br/>
She had just gotten the award for &quot;Most Physically Fit Female,&quot; so out of <br/>
respect for her ability to kick my ass and Marty&#39;s too, I didn&#39;t press.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oooh, that sounds totally YUM!  I just this spring discovered that I like<br/>
avacados and guacamole.<br/>
<br/>
I had to try one bite of everything as a kid, and hated having to do it, so<br/>
I it&#39;s only in the last couple years that I&#39;ve started tasting new things<br/>
again.  Took me almost 15 years to get around to it.  And I found that I<br/>
have come to like avacados!<br/>
<br/>
Tim doesn&#39;t like them yet, though.  So I don&#39;t have to share!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ya know, I read about a restaurant that does this, makes it fresh at the <br/>
table, and my first thought was, why would they *do* that?  I always make mine <br/>
ahead of time to give all the flavas a chance to get to know each other before I <br/>
eat it. lol <br/>
