 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been learning gardening and landscaping, and my yard looks pretty darn <br/>
good, if I do say so myself. You guys have already heard about my pond, <br/>
multiple times. &lt;LOL&gt; I&#39;ve researched a lot on edible landscaping and <br/>
native landscaping. We have a vegetable garden and an herb garden that <br/>
doubles as a butterfly garden. We&#39;re working on attracting as many <br/>
butterflies and birds as we can.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve also been learning American Sign Language, and I&#39;ve been brushing up <br/>
on my French (we were hoping to travel with dh, who just had a conference <br/>
in Paris, but $$$ was lacking--isn&#39;t it always!) and playing Madeline with <br/>
the kids in French. I have always been into languages. I&#39;m pretty good with <br/>
French, not fluent, but pretty good. I also took several years of Spanish <br/>
and a summer of Chinese at the community college. Looks like dh might have <br/>
a conference next December in Puerto Rico, so this next year I&#39;ll be going <br/>
back to the Spanish, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been reading lots on unschooling and, more recently, on food <br/>
allergies. I&#39;m way into Lord of the Rings--reading the trilogy was my <br/>
reward to myself after I finished defending my thesis. I had never read it <br/>
before, and I read it while we were in Key West. Dh had a conference (a <br/>
major perk! &lt;g&gt;) at a really posh resort. There was a private beach, but no <br/>
real access to the water along the beach because of the reef. But there <br/>
were lots of great tidal pools in the rocks for the kids to splash in. It <br/>
was truly a slice of heaven!<br/>

jade carvings and swords, mostly.   He uses chemistry and microscopic anaylsis <br/>

over the world, and things are shipped to his house all the time, the federal <br/>
express truck painstakingly pulling into his mountain yard and out two or three <br/>
times a week to bring priceless objects which he reports on and ships back.<br/>
<br/>
He dropped out of college many years ago, was an artist from the time we were <br/>
kids, is a musician, eventually got a bachelor&#39;s degree in studio art (not <br/>
art history) to make his dad happy, and is an unquestionable expert in something <br/>
he never studied in college.  Oh.  He also teaches Tai Chi and Kung Fu, and <br/>
knows more about Chinese medicine than most people in our state, but has no <br/>
&quot;degree&quot; in that either, and has never practiced, but he does make potioly good <br/>
husband and father.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t even start on my friends who have degrees they don&#39;t use or never <br/>

Yes, sometimes a person has a degree AND experience and is worth listening <br/>

My brother was the first one in our family to go to college.  He went to<br/>
Texas Tech and learned how to drink lots of beer and how to two-step<br/>
exceptionally well.  He dropped out as a Sophomore.  Steve was then hired at<br/>
the nuclear plant in South Texas.  He has worked there for 20 years,<br/>
starting as a technician and now as some sort of chemist.<br/>
<br/>
He is flown all over the world to help with trouble shooting at nuclear<br/>
plants.   It actually freaked me out that my dufus big brother (we used to<br/>
wail on each other endlessly) helps the world avoid nuclear accidents.  Too<br/>
bizarre.<br/>

Actually, I think the more accurate description is that no one will allow<br/>
you to do his job without being formally educated.  Is it not possible that<br/>
if your dad took an apprentice, just somebody who was really interested in<br/>
genetics but didn&#39;t have a degree, he would be able to teach them on the<br/>

<br/>
But I&#39;ll bet there was a lot more to your father&#39;s education than <br/>
simply going to school. To do the amazing work that he is doing would <br/>
seem to me to almost require a passion for the subject. (Not subject <br/>
as in school, but I can&#39;t think of a better word right now.) I&#39;m sure <br/>
the learning happened before, during and after his school years. His <br/>
advanced schooling was the culmination of all his learning, not the <br/>
beginning of it. Nor was it all of it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t think college level schooling has its place. I <br/>
do. It&#39;s just that we can get the &quot;I NEED to go to school to be <br/>
educated&quot; mentality everywhere. I saw a PSA for mentoring recently <br/>
that had the guy saying one of his biggest jobs as a mentor was to <br/>
find ways to keep the kid in school. Huh? <br/>
<br/>
On a list such as this, I think it&#39;s helpful to talk about the out of <br/>
the box ways of getting an education. <br/>

<br/>
I can see your point, but as always, it&#39;s when the phrases come out as<br/>
absolutes that folks start to get cranky.<br/>
<br/>
Formal education is not always a complete waste of time.  It is also not the<br/>
only way to get where you want to be, most of the time.  And frequently, it<br/>
isn&#39;t even the best way, by far.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s a walk then run idea.  If you are already comfortable that there<br/>
are other ways, then thinking about doing formal education for somethings,<br/>
some time, if you want, isn&#39;t a big deal.  If you are still hung up about<br/>
&quot;school&quot; being the only way, then you need to work on that first.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;You can&#39;t do my father&#39;s job without being formally educated&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Actually, I think the more accurate description is that no one will allow<br/>
&gt; &gt;you to do his job without being formally educated.  Is it not possible<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt;if your dad took an apprentice, just somebody who was really interested<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt;genetics but didn&#39;t have a degree, he would be able to teach them on the<br/>
&gt; &gt;job?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would think that it COULD be done, but would not be efficent in the<br/>
&gt; extreme.  You are, of course, technically correct.  And in the old days,<br/>
&gt; when my father would have been more of an alchemist (grin) that would have<br/>
&gt; been how it was.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But it&#39;s not reality now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So, yes, you are correct and I&#39;ll re-phrase it:  &quot;You won&#39;t be permitted<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; do some jobs without being formally educated.  So, if you want to do that<br/>
&gt; job, you will also be chosing formal education for at least a time.&quot;<br/>

considers French her 2nd language.  My other children have mostly been into <br/>
learning Spanish; I think due to the amount of media available in Spanish.  I <br/>
started learning Vietnamese and Swedish due to  Emily&#39;s interest.  We have a lot <br/>
of Vietnamese-American neighbors and our ancestors were mostly from Sweden.  I <br/>
mostly use resources from the library when studying languages.  We started <br/>
learning Swedish in September, and it has been difficult due to lack of a variety <br/>
of resources.  Emily will frequent Swedish chat rooms, and we have a real <br/>
good Swedish-English dictionary.  While thumbing through it, 11yo ds and 9 yo dd <br/>
noticed right away that it contains *all* American words, LOL!<br/>

<br/>
(If someone DID imply this and I&#39;ve missed it, come clean so we can debate<br/>
it into the ground. Be a sport. ;)<br/>
<br/>
What *does* get implied (and simply stated) here, pretty often, is that<br/>
formal education is not a be-all end-all for many of us and other mortals in<br/>
this country, is not necessary or desirable in many cases and many lives,<br/>
and that the current societal obsession with every child ending up with a<br/>
college degree is not only damaging and potentially damaging to many of<br/>
those self-same children, but it&#39;s also a bunch of hoo-ha.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO of course. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
*Careerism* is one of the reasons I started homeschooling my children.  I <br/>
think it&#39;s horrible the way schools teach that some ways of making money are <br/>
better than others and that a person is defined by their career.  Kindergarteners <br/>
often have career exploration units...and of course lots of careers are left <br/>
out.  Homemakers, small business owners, factory workers, and in general <br/>
anything that doesn&#39;t usually involve higher education.  I&#39;ve known parents who were <br/>
shocked when their 3 year old said that they wanted to be a maid or a fast <br/>
food worker or an ice cream truck driver.<br/>
<br/>
My dad has worked as a millwright in a factory all his adult life.  Although <br/>
he likes his job and makes enough money, he doesn&#39;t want to be defined as a <br/>
millwright.  When people ask him what he does, he says he reads books and fishes!<br/>

Yes, but we also drink the milk and show them.  They are way too much<br/>
trouble to have just to make soap.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested, contact the American Dairy Goat Association to see if<br/>
you can get a list of breeders in your area.  You can freeze the milk (it<br/>
stays good enough to drink for months) and make soap as is convenient.<br/>

This will happen with goat milk too if it gets too hot.  The book I<br/>
mentioned suggests putting the milk in a sink of ice water while adding the<br/>
lye and then adding it so slowly that it takes a full 5 minutes to get it<br/>
all added.  I pour perhaps a teaspoon in and stir awhile and then pour a<br/>
little more, stir, etc..  It turns a beautiful light yellow.<br/>

misinterpretation.<br/>

&lt;&lt; not only damaging and potentially damaging to many of<br/>
those self-same children, but it&#39;s also a bunch of hoo-ha.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;IMHO of course. &lt;g&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Though hoo-ha is in the eye of the beholder, generally, if a person has not <br/>
really looked but only accepted what they see with peripheral vision (must be <br/>
important; everybody&#39;s either doing it or feeling crushed with guilt if they <br/>
didn&#39;t) then I&#39;d consider the view from the eyes of the person who has really <br/>
thought and observed than the reflected view of &quot;I don&#39;t know why, but it seems <br/>
to seem important&quot; of people who are just going with the traditional flow.<br/>
<br/>
The traditional flow would have had all our kids in school, and then those <br/>
who went to college would have been successes (in the eyes of their high school <br/>
guidance counsellors and state statisticians) and those who didn&#39;t would have <br/>
been failures.  Failure to &quot;live up to potential,&quot; at the very least.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m more interested in college being one of many options availble to <br/>
thoughtful, successful humans than it being what it so often seems now:  one more test <br/>
of whether people will conform.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think going to college for fun is bad.  Going to college to get away <br/>
from home is a time-honored tradition going back to the Middle Ages, at least. <br/>
  Going because grandma wants to pay for it sounds fabulous to me personally. <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
Borrowing thousands of dollars to see if you can stand it because it seems <br/>
daddy will withdraw all love and affection otherwise seems less cool by <br/>
exponential measurement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1276873028">&lt;&lt; My dad has worked as a millwright in a factory all his adult life.  <br/>
Although <br/>
he likes his job and makes enough money, he doesn&#39;t want to be defined as a <br/>
millwright.  When people ask him what he does, he says he reads books and <br/>
fishes!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was asked what she wanted to be when she grew up and was being fed <br/>
options by the person asking.   &quot;An actress?  a teacher?&quot; (I forgot what else she <br/>
said.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly looked at her politely but steadily and said &quot;I&#39;m only ten years old.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The woman was shocked.  Most kids would have just rolled, and chosen <br/>
something from the limited list given to them, and then walked around for years <br/>
feeling at least somewhat committed to their &quot;choice.&quot;<br/>
