&lt;&lt; The book I have written is geared for this<br/>
 audience, the concerned friends and family, not so much the moms (or<br/>
 dads) who will actually be doing the &quot;schooling.&quot;  Would such a book<br/>
 have been helpful to you when you made the &quot;big announcement&quot; or would<br/>
 such a book still be helpful to you for all of the questions you still<br/>
 receive about your decision to homeschool?  I would really appreciate<br/>
 your feedback.  If I am barking up the wrong tree, I will stop my search<br/>
 for a publishing company.<br/>
 Thanks for your help,<br/>

subject anymore e than I have to. I am tired of getting the feeling I need to <br/>
prove to another that my child is doing well.<br/>
