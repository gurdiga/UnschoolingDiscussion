<div id="ygrps-yiv-468652957"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Example: Everything is broken down into subjects, and<br/>
&gt; specifically into GRADE LEVEL subjects : Social<br/>
&gt; studies includes the world around us, knowing about<br/>
&gt; local governments, American history in X grade, world<br/>
&gt; history in Y grade. How do you do this if you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; even in a grade? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or even more importantly, in my experience, why learn about something just<br/>
because you&#39;re X years old?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re often asked if Tim is studying this or that, and several folks were<br/>
distressed that he knows so little about his country (USA).  I&#39;m living in<br/>
Germany for 3 years.  Guess what we&#39;ve learned about here?  Surprise, my son<br/>
has been interested in castles and knights, and coins from countries that<br/>
didn&#39;t exist a few years ago or changed names recently.  European history.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll run into American history when we move back to America, most likely.<br/>
It&#39;ll be more relevant then, don&#39;tcha think?  Even if he is 9 and should<br/>
have learned it at 8!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I suppose if you have to give the state lots of detailed info every year,<br/>
and they&#39;re vastly concerned that you&#39;re covering the same things as the<br/>
school, the guides might have their uses.  But being able to pitch the<br/>
subject/grade level concept is freeing.<br/>
