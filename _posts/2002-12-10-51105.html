would be interested in me because I&#39;m not 10 or 12 or 8.  We&#39;re impressed<br/>
with kids who go to college at 15, but not with people who wait until<br/>
they&#39;re older and know what they want to study and why they need this<br/>

Personally, I think anyone who can handle the working world at 17 and raise<br/>
children should easily be able to tackle college classes.<br/>

All except the part where you accept oppressive and arbitrary rules and <br/>
regulations and inflexibility.  Some people are way too smart and experienced <br/>
in real life to accept the hazing abuse that happens in some classes (NOT ALL <br/>
OF THE CLASSES!)<br/>

&quot;major&quot; classes are redundant.  The topics are covered over and over and over <br/>
in each class.  My GOD.. sometimes I want to pull my hair out.  I even told <br/>
my instuctors for one class this semester that I just use my &quot;old work&quot; to <br/>
turn in.   What has taken over 2 years to cover could have been covered in 6 <br/>
weeks.  EASILY.   And, I have also found that the majority of High School Srs <br/>
that end up going to Community College are sadly lacking in any academic <br/>
skills.   Kids struggle for C&#39;s or to just pass a class.  I  am raising my <br/>
own 4 children, managing my household, and going to school, and getting A&#39;s <br/>
has been little effort.   Its not because I am some kind of super whiz.. LOL. <br/>
its just because these kids dont really know how to learn independently.. <br/>
They expect to be spoon fed.    I have taken as many classes online as I have <br/>
on campus.  I LOVE the online courses because I dont have to deal with the <br/>
instructors ridiculous rules and redundant lectures.. In one class I had.. We <br/>
had a text book..with a CD that also covered main topics.. The teacher would <br/>
lecture on the topics along with a slide presentation.   I was like <br/>
GEEZOMITEY, why cant I just read the book?????..  I will say, going back to <br/>
school myself has only made me empathize with my children in ps.    The only <br/>
reason I went back was to get the &quot;papers&quot; to prove I know what I am doing, <br/>
to help me get a job.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, folks cant go <br/>
apply for a job and just say.. Yeah, I can do that. You have to PROVE you&#39;ve <br/>
had the education or the experience ( preferrably both)    My advice to <br/>
anyone going back to college is.. You CAN do it.. Dont be intimidated.  You <br/>
will be surprised at how easy it is.. But, be prepared to have homework, do a <br/>
lot of busy work, and basically appease your instructors to prove you know <br/>
the material... yeah, just like &quot;regular&quot; school   I have been so <br/>
disappointed that adults are treated like elementary school children.  One <br/>
time,  a student quietly and politely got up during class to leave.   The <br/>
teacher stopped teaching and said &quot;excuse me, class is not over, where do you <br/>
think you are going&quot;  The student said..,&quot;i have an appointment&quot;  The teacher <br/>
said.. &quot;at 12:00?  arent most folks out to lunch&#39;?  The student was obviously <br/>
flustered and angry, . She said..&quot;Yes, I have an appt at 12:30, do you want <br/>
me to bring an excuse?&quot;  The teacher said..&quot;well, just try to schedule your <br/>
appts around class time.  .. The student left and slammed the door.  I was <br/>
APPALLED.. I swear.. I wanted to get up and leave myself. I SO wished it was <br/>
me.. I would have said something like.. &quot;Uhh, I have a highly contagious <br/>
sexually transmitted disease, I am going for my transfusion&quot;.. Or maybe.. &quot;I <br/>
have diarrreha and I just soiled myself.&quot;. Or heck, even,&quot;I have a date with <br/>
your husband to do him good during lunch&quot;.  LMAO.. Or good and simple, &quot;Its <br/>
none of your business where I am going, I paid to take this class and I will <br/>
get up and leave if I %(&%&$#) please!&quot;    OK enough rambling for me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785620465">After I take my Algebra class - which I want to do in class since math is not my strong suit - I plan to take CLEP tests. Depending on the test I can get 3 credit hours or more and can cut my time in class! I should have taken the CLEP tests for my English courses because I believe I could have passed that test. I plan to take History and Natural Science tests and get them out of the way next year after taking my Algebra class. I am also planning to take the quickie summer course. They are trying out classes like 1/2 semesters - you do all the course work in 6 weeks instead of 12. I&#39;m going to do that for my Algebra so I can get it done. What it also means is they cover a lot of info - 3 hour class - and there is homework and if a class is missed it&#39;s hard to make up as the work increases in difficulty. <br/>
<br/>
But check into the CLEP tests. That would help with the frustration with the instructors. Luckily I had some really neat instructors, even in my English 1101 course where I had car trouble and missed some classes. She just wanted you to turn in the work, she didn&#39;t have an attendance policy. <br/>
<br/>
What I like so much about being an adult in college is all the options that I have to choose from that weren&#39;t around 11 years ago. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679102261">My 18 yo&#39;s college math teacher won&#39;t let her make up an exam she missed. <br/>
She missed it because she was at the hospital with the rest of us - my <br/>
mother had a stroke on Monday morning and died on Wednesday night. Roya <br/>
missed Tuesday and Thursday&#39;s classes. She has an &quot;A&quot; average in the class <br/>
- but with that missing exam she has a &quot;C&quot; in the course EVEN if she gets <br/>
an &quot;A&quot; on the final next week. In his syllabus he says he&#39;ll drop the <br/>
lowest exam grade - she KNEW that and thought it was okay for her to skip <br/>
it. Now he says he made a mistake in the syllabus, he meant he&#39;d drop the <br/>
lowest QUIZ grade (they have lots of quizzes, but only a few actual EXAMS).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s written him a letter, including a copy of the death certificate and <br/>
his own syllabus. She says he won&#39;t budget. She&#39;s going to have to appeal <br/>
to the dean of the math/science division, who is a very cool guy - <br/>
rational, kind, reasonable - but he&#39;s in the hospital himself right now and <br/>
is very seriously ill.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh my goodness!  I&#39;ve been thinking about going to college but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; scared to<br/>
&gt; &gt; death!  I moved out of my parent&#39;s home at 17 and went right to work - <br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; had the college experience!  At 46, the thought of even going to the local<br/>
&gt; &gt; junior college is enough to give me heart palpitations :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Beth,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But Beth, just think how smart you are now!  If life is such a great teacher<br/>
&gt;that we trust our children to learn from it, you&#39;ve had a lot more learning<br/>
&gt;than most college students!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think this is a side-effect our preoccupation as a society with age and<br/>
&gt;doing things younger and younger.  Even if I played cello as well as a<br/>
&gt;couple of the prodigies now running around the world (and I don&#39;t!), nobody<br/>
&gt;would be interested in me because I&#39;m not 10 or 12 or 8.  We&#39;re impressed<br/>
&gt;with kids who go to college at 15, but not with people who wait until<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re older and know what they want to study and why they need this<br/>
&gt;degree.  Why?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally, I think anyone who can handle the working world at 17 and raise<br/>
&gt;children should easily be able to tackle college classes.<br/>

&gt;why every word processor comes with a spell-checker.Spelling is something<br/>

&gt;spelling is often more logical! If he needs to write something in life,<br/>
&gt;like a job resume, or letter, or whatever that requires correct spelling-<br/>
&gt;he can use those resources.&quot;Writing &quot; is about saying what you want to<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;We see so many AWFUL parenting examples in public places - this was a very<br/>
&gt;very nice encounter:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I was in a restaurant last week and admiring the grandparents, parents<br/>
&gt;and 3 little children at the table next to us -- enjoying watching and<br/>
&gt;listening to the sweet way they all were with each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As we were leaving, I heard the dad say to the grandparents, &quot;Well, we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;thinking about homeschooling - just keeping on doing what we&#39;ve been doing<br/>
&gt;seems like a good idea to us.&quot; OF COURSE, I stopped to eavesdrop -  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;The mom said, &quot;Seems like they&#39;re all learning all the time already and we<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t see why we need to send them off to school.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Grandpa said, &quot;Sounds like a GREAT idea to me.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Grandma said, &quot;Me too.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t say anything - just walked on - but I wanted to give them the<br/>
&gt;grandparents/parents of the year award right then and there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me know what comebacks you receive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I received a piece of advice here a while back on this, and it&#39;s worked<br/>
&gt;fairly well.  When people start in on my homeschooling, I wait for them to<br/>
&gt;take a breath and then start in on a looooong discourse about how<br/>
&gt;wonderfully things are going, how happy we all are, how much Tim has learned<br/>
&gt;lately, how grateful I am to have people in life who are supportive of what<br/>
&gt;I do, how educational life is, how many interesting things we&#39;ve read or<br/>
&gt;seen videos about lately, Tim&#39;s talents, his music lessons, his theatre<br/>
&gt;work, how helpful he is, etc. etc.  By the time I finished, only my MIL was<br/>
&gt;dumb enough to make another comment, and I just prattled on for another few<br/>
&gt;minutes and she left me alone for awhile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My own mother called CPS on me<br/>
&gt; &gt; for homeschooling my kids. She is a teacher and feels that they are more<br/>
&gt; &gt; qualified for the job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SO WHAT!  They&#39;re not her kids, so the fact that she thinks she could do it<br/>
&gt;better is totally beside the point.  And calling CPS for homeschooling is,<br/>
&gt;in my humble opinion, a waste of CPS&#39;s time.  They have better things to do.<br/>
&gt;Obviously she needs something better to do, eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have to disagree my husband has 2 1/2 yrs. of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mechanical Engineer and I am a Certified Legal Assistant in the State of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Texas. I feel that we as parents are equally qualified.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The last statement is true.  As parents, you are wonderfully qualified.<br/>
&gt;Your education is not relevant.  If someone truly wants to homeschool,<br/>
&gt;they&#39;ll find a way to do it, because they love their kids and believe in it.<br/>
&gt;You don&#39;t need any particular education to do this, just a healthy curiosity<br/>
&gt;about the world which you can communicate to your children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;brenda<br/>
&gt;snuffly with a cold and grouchy from it, too!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe my question here, as well, is does phonetic oriented exposure<br/>
&gt; &gt; complicate or enhance or can go either way depending on the child?  I <br/>
&gt; am not<br/>
&gt; &gt; always able to present myself clearly...especiallly when I am in the midst<br/>
&gt; &gt; of a ponder...hope I am making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I suppose it would depend on how it&#39;s presented.  But I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
&gt;avoid having any exposure to phonics whatsover.  They&#39;re all over the place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t teach my son phonics so he could read.  He would ask about the<br/>
&gt;sounds letters make when he saw things in print.  And when we sat down<br/>
&gt;together with easy books, sometimes I&#39;d point out something that might help<br/>
&gt;him.  For example, he tried to say the silent e&#39;s on the ends of words, so<br/>
&gt;we talked about how e is quiet but manipulative, because he changes the<br/>
&gt;sound of the other letters but doesn&#39;t say anything himself.  And Tim got<br/>
&gt;mad at c, because he&#39;s a thief without a sound but steals s or k&#39;s sound, so<br/>
&gt;you never knew which sound he was going to be!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is that phonics?  Of course.  But phonetic oriented exposure sounds very<br/>
&gt;teachy, and you don&#39;t need to teach him to read.  He&#39;ll read himself when<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s good and ready.<br/>

&gt;I live in a portfolio state, one that loves to ask for &quot;extras&quot;. Fortunately,<br/>
&gt;we also have the option of an &quot;umbrella&quot; school. I found one that is very<br/>
&gt;unschooling friendly and requires NO paper work, just a checklist once a<br/>
&gt;year.<br/>
&gt;I tried going through the county school system portfolio reviews but found<br/>
&gt;that it was very stressful to try to &quot;speak their language&quot; and a huge<br/>
&gt;hinderance to unschooling succesfully. I think the ways that schools teacha<br/>
&gt;nd compartmentalize and label, to be so false and out of life&#39;s context. I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t try to pretend to work within a system that is so wrong for us.<br/>
&gt;When we move to our new state witch has very similar laws, I don&#39;t intend on<br/>
&gt;registering my children with the state at all.<br/>

&gt;I had these same concerns,   I would have lived without TV, a couple of <br/>
&gt;years ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My son has actually lost weight in the last 6 months, since we&#39;ve started <br/>
&gt;this whole unschooling adventure,   I think for us its the whole <br/>
&gt;limit/obsession thing.   We also lifted limits on the foods-hence he <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t over eat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is something to say for vegging out, or escaping, such as, reading <br/>
&gt;or watching TV,  what-ever.  I know as a kid I did those things when I was <br/>
&gt;troubled, but I would also figure things out at the same time.  So I guess <br/>
&gt;I wouldn&#39;t call it vegging out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess for me I can&#39;t even begin to know when my kids need that time, <br/>
&gt;hopefully they will come and talk to me, but I know they won&#39;t always want <br/>
&gt;to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even tho&#39;   I was raised in quite a controlling environment,  I am very <br/>
&gt;thankful that when I was home I was allowed to do pretty much what I <br/>
&gt;wanted when I wanted.<br/>
&gt;I have to remember that right now, I have been pretty much pulling my hair <br/>
&gt;out about my Mom lately.<br/>

&gt;The mom said, &quot;Seems like they&#39;re all learning all the time already and we<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t see why we need to send them off to school.&quot;<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: TV<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Statistically,&quot; say statisticians who want to say &quot;no tv,&quot; kids who watch<br/>
&gt;more TV are fatter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;LOGICALLY and sensibly, kids who are fat and are being tormented by other<br/>
&gt;kids, or who just happen not to be jockish anyway, tend to watch TV more than<br/>
&gt;those who are out and about because they have the need to roller blade or<br/>
&gt;whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a friend years ago who was small, effeminate, weak, and his dad thought<br/>
&gt;that if he shot hoops in the driveway every afternoon for forty five minutes,<br/>
&gt;he would get bigger, butcher and stronger.   No, what he got was teased by<br/>
&gt;every by-passing neighbor, and he spent 45 minutes every day resenting his<br/>
&gt;day to the bone.  He grew up mean and evil.  One of the few people I&#39;ve known<br/>
&gt;in my life of whom I would use the &quot;evil&quot; word.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So too many times I&#39;ve noticed parents and researchers and teachers and those<br/>
&gt;badillions who are doing &quot;research&quot; to get a master&#39;s degree or a PhD in<br/>
&gt;education so they can get OUT of the classroom and into an administrative job<br/>
&gt;telling other teachers what to do.... (BREATHE! &lt;g&gt;) ... I&#39;ve seen them too<br/>
&gt;often take correlation as cause, because their paper only had to be 40 pages<br/>
&gt;and nobody made them prove cause.<br/>

&gt;All except the part where you accept oppressive and arbitrary rules and<br/>
&gt;regulations and inflexibility.  Some people are way too smart and experienced<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; After I take my Algebra class - which I want to do in class since math is not<br/>
&gt; my strong suit - I plan to take CLEP tests. Depending on the test I can get 3<br/>
&gt; credit hours or more and can cut my time in class! I should have taken the<br/>
&gt; CLEP tests for my English courses because I believe I could have passed that<br/>
&gt; test. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been a number of years since I took the CLEP tests, but suggestion:<br/>
read the rules very, very carefully.  It&#39;s possible they&#39;ve changed, but<br/>
back when I took them, you got 1 point for correct answers and lost 1/2<br/>
point for incorrect answers.  As long as you answered a certain percentage<br/>
of the questions (75% maybe?), unanswered questions did NOT count against<br/>
you.  It was like they weren&#39;t even there.  With that kind of set up, you&#39;re<br/>
penalized for guessing but not for not knowing.<br/>
<br/>
I went through and answered everything I knew for certain, then counted my<br/>
answers and answered things I had a reasonable amount of certainty on, and<br/>
then guessed on a few things that I could use process of elimination on.  I<br/>
left everything else blank, and I scored incredibly high on the math test<br/>
doing that.<br/>
<br/>
Worth checking on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-761537022">Same thing happened to me in college,  Business Statistics class, my hardest class, and my grandmother had a stoke and died, the whole process took about 2 weeks.   The prof had no sympathy,  I tried to explain that she had lived with me my whole life, she was pretty much the mom that would give me attention.  But he didn&#39;t care,  I also got a C.  That semester was sooo miserable.<br/>
 <br/>
In certain ways I hope my children don&#39;t want to go to college,  then they won&#39;t have to deal with all that.  I know there were good things too, but I just can&#39;t remember them right now.<br/>

I&#39;m tired,  been up with a puking daughter all night.<br/>

She&#39;s written him a letter, including a copy of the death certificate and <br/>

to the dean of the math/science division, who is a very cool guy - <br/>
rational, kind, reasonable - but he&#39;s in the hospital himself right now and <br/>
is very seriously ill.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh my goodness!  I&#39;ve been thinking about going to college but I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; scared to<br/>
&gt; &gt; death!  I moved out of my parent&#39;s home at 17 and went right to work - <br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt; had the college experience!  At 46, the thought of even going to the local<br/>
&gt; &gt; junior college is enough to give me heart palpitations :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Beth,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;But Beth, just think how smart you are now!  If life is such a great teacher<br/>
&gt;that we trust our children to learn from it, you&#39;ve had a lot more learning<br/>
&gt;than most college students!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think this is a side-effect our preoccupation as a society with age and<br/>
&gt;doing things younger and younger.  Even if I played cello as well as a<br/>
&gt;couple of the prodigies now running around the world (and I don&#39;t!), nobody<br/>
&gt;would be interested in me because I&#39;m not 10 or 12 or 8.  We&#39;re impressed<br/>
&gt;with kids who go to college at 15, but not with people who wait until<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re older and know what they want to study and why they need this<br/>
&gt;degree.  Why?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Personally, I think anyone who can handle the working world at 17 and raise<br/>
&gt;children should easily be able to tackle college classes.<br/>

&gt;I have been mostly a lurker here, but I just HAVE to jump in on this one.<br/>
&gt;&lt;G&gt; To the mother of Lars- he&#39;s an excellent writer! I thought he shared<br/>
&gt;his thoughts very well! So he can&#39;t spell- big deal- there are lot&#39;s of<br/>
&gt;&quot;educated&quot; adults who can&#39;t either. That&#39;s what dictionary&#39;s are for, and<br/>
&gt;why every word processor comes with a spell-checker.Spelling is something<br/>
&gt;that comes natural to some and not others, and quite frankly phonetic<br/>
&gt;spelling is often more logical! If he needs to write something in life,<br/>
&gt;like a job resume, or letter, or whatever that requires correct spelling-<br/>
&gt;he can use those resources.&quot;Writing &quot; is about saying what you want to<br/>
&gt;say, communicating your thoughts to others, NOT about spelling. In other<br/>
&gt;words, don&#39;t stress it &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;We see so many AWFUL parenting examples in public places - this was a very<br/>
&gt;very nice encounter:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   I was in a restaurant last week and admiring the grandparents, parents<br/>
&gt;and 3 little children at the table next to us -- enjoying watching and<br/>
&gt;listening to the sweet way they all were with each other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;As we were leaving, I heard the dad say to the grandparents, &quot;Well, we&#39;re<br/>
&gt;thinking about homeschooling - just keeping on doing what we&#39;ve been doing<br/>
&gt;seems like a good idea to us.&quot; OF COURSE, I stopped to eavesdrop -  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
&gt;The mom said, &quot;Seems like they&#39;re all learning all the time already and we<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t see why we need to send them off to school.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Grandpa said, &quot;Sounds like a GREAT idea to me.&quot;<br/>
&gt;Grandma said, &quot;Me too.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t say anything - just walked on - but I wanted to give them the<br/>
&gt;grandparents/parents of the year award right then and there.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me know what comebacks you receive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I received a piece of advice here a while back on this, and it&#39;s worked<br/>
&gt;fairly well.  When people start in on my homeschooling, I wait for them to<br/>
&gt;take a breath and then start in on a looooong discourse about how<br/>
&gt;wonderfully things are going, how happy we all are, how much Tim has learned<br/>
&gt;lately, how grateful I am to have people in life who are supportive of what<br/>
&gt;I do, how educational life is, how many interesting things we&#39;ve read or<br/>
&gt;seen videos about lately, Tim&#39;s talents, his music lessons, his theatre<br/>
&gt;work, how helpful he is, etc. etc.  By the time I finished, only my MIL was<br/>
&gt;dumb enough to make another comment, and I just prattled on for another few<br/>
&gt;minutes and she left me alone for awhile.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My own mother called CPS on me<br/>
&gt; &gt; for homeschooling my kids. She is a teacher and feels that they are more<br/>
&gt; &gt; qualified for the job.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;SO WHAT!  They&#39;re not her kids, so the fact that she thinks she could do it<br/>
&gt;better is totally beside the point.  And calling CPS for homeschooling is,<br/>
&gt;in my humble opinion, a waste of CPS&#39;s time.  They have better things to do.<br/>
&gt;Obviously she needs something better to do, eh?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have to disagree my husband has 2 1/2 yrs. of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mechanical Engineer and I am a Certified Legal Assistant in the State of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Texas. I feel that we as parents are equally qualified.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The last statement is true.  As parents, you are wonderfully qualified.<br/>
&gt;Your education is not relevant.  If someone truly wants to homeschool,<br/>
&gt;they&#39;ll find a way to do it, because they love their kids and believe in it.<br/>
&gt;You don&#39;t need any particular education to do this, just a healthy curiosity<br/>
&gt;about the world which you can communicate to your children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;brenda<br/>
&gt;snuffly with a cold and grouchy from it, too!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Maybe my question here, as well, is does phonetic oriented exposure<br/>
&gt; &gt; complicate or enhance or can go either way depending on the child?  I <br/>
&gt; am not<br/>
&gt; &gt; always able to present myself clearly...especiallly when I am in the midst<br/>
&gt; &gt; of a ponder...hope I am making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I suppose it would depend on how it&#39;s presented.  But I don&#39;t think you can<br/>
&gt;avoid having any exposure to phonics whatsover.  They&#39;re all over the place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t teach my son phonics so he could read.  He would ask about the<br/>
&gt;sounds letters make when he saw things in print.  And when we sat down<br/>
&gt;together with easy books, sometimes I&#39;d point out something that might help<br/>
&gt;him.  For example, he tried to say the silent e&#39;s on the ends of words, so<br/>
&gt;we talked about how e is quiet but manipulative, because he changes the<br/>
&gt;sound of the other letters but doesn&#39;t say anything himself.  And Tim got<br/>
&gt;mad at c, because he&#39;s a thief without a sound but steals s or k&#39;s sound, so<br/>
&gt;you never knew which sound he was going to be!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Is that phonics?  Of course.  But phonetic oriented exposure sounds very<br/>
&gt;teachy, and you don&#39;t need to teach him to read.  He&#39;ll read himself when<br/>
&gt;he&#39;s good and ready.<br/>

&gt;You do make it much more simpler!<br/>
&gt;I think it was the way the website presented it that seemed like so much to<br/>
&gt;do.<br/>
&gt;I live in a portfolio state, one that loves to ask for &quot;extras&quot;. We even have<br/>
&gt;the BOE considering changing the regulations due to that old excuse of<br/>
&gt;&quot;homeschoolers have been providing us with that information for a long time<br/>
&gt;anyway so we are changing the statutes to reflect that&quot;<br/>
&gt;I was thinking that I would do it the way you just said you would do it.<br/>
&gt;Since registering is an option in missouri, do you do that?<br/>

&gt;I live in a portfolio state, one that loves to ask for &quot;extras&quot;. Fortunately,<br/>
&gt;we also have the option of an &quot;umbrella&quot; school. I found one that is very<br/>
&gt;unschooling friendly and requires NO paper work, just a checklist once a<br/>
&gt;year.<br/>
&gt;I tried going through the county school system portfolio reviews but found<br/>
&gt;that it was very stressful to try to &quot;speak their language&quot; and a huge<br/>
&gt;hinderance to unschooling succesfully. I think the ways that schools teacha<br/>
&gt;nd compartmentalize and label, to be so false and out of life&#39;s context. I<br/>
&gt;couldn&#39;t try to pretend to work within a system that is so wrong for us.<br/>
&gt;When we move to our new state witch has very similar laws, I don&#39;t intend on<br/>
&gt;registering my children with the state at all.<br/>

&gt;Heidi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had these same concerns,   I would have lived without TV, a couple of <br/>
&gt;years ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My son has actually lost weight in the last 6 months, since we&#39;ve started <br/>
&gt;this whole unschooling adventure,   I think for us its the whole <br/>
&gt;limit/obsession thing.   We also lifted limits on the foods-hence he <br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t over eat.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There is something to say for vegging out, or escaping, such as, reading <br/>
&gt;or watching TV,  what-ever.  I know as a kid I did those things when I was <br/>
&gt;troubled, but I would also figure things out at the same time.  So I guess <br/>
&gt;I wouldn&#39;t call it vegging out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I guess for me I can&#39;t even begin to know when my kids need that time, <br/>
&gt;hopefully they will come and talk to me, but I know they won&#39;t always want <br/>
&gt;to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Even tho&#39;   I was raised in quite a controlling environment,  I am very <br/>
&gt;thankful that when I was home I was allowed to do pretty much what I <br/>
&gt;wanted when I wanted.<br/>
&gt;I have to remember that right now, I have been pretty much pulling my hair <br/>
&gt;out about my Mom lately.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Take Care,<br/>

&gt;to avoid the obesity problems.  We don&#39;t limit food, I do encourage healthy<br/>
&gt;snacks, I don&#39;t make him go outside, (which he hasn&#39;t really been in weeks,<br/>

&gt;Subject: Re: TV<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;Statistically,&quot; say statisticians who want to say &quot;no tv,&quot; kids who watch<br/>
&gt;more TV are fatter.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;LOGICALLY and sensibly, kids who are fat and are being tormented by other<br/>
&gt;kids, or who just happen not to be jockish anyway, tend to watch TV more than<br/>
&gt;those who are out and about because they have the need to roller blade or<br/>
&gt;whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I had a friend years ago who was small, effeminate, weak, and his dad thought<br/>
&gt;that if he shot hoops in the driveway every afternoon for forty five minutes,<br/>
&gt;he would get bigger, butcher and stronger.   No, what he got was teased by<br/>
&gt;every by-passing neighbor, and he spent 45 minutes every day resenting his<br/>
&gt;day to the bone.  He grew up mean and evil.  One of the few people I&#39;ve known<br/>
&gt;in my life of whom I would use the &quot;evil&quot; word.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So too many times I&#39;ve noticed parents and researchers and teachers and those<br/>
&gt;badillions who are doing &quot;research&quot; to get a master&#39;s degree or a PhD in<br/>
&gt;education so they can get OUT of the classroom and into an administrative job<br/>
&gt;telling other teachers what to do.... (BREATHE! &lt;g&gt;) ... I&#39;ve seen them too<br/>
&gt;often take correlation as cause, because their paper only had to be 40 pages<br/>
&gt;and nobody made them prove cause.<br/>

&gt;That&#39;s funny.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve called CPS on my own mother!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m really sorry anyone&#39;s mom would do that to anyone.<br/>
&gt;A lot of people should be called on sending their kids to schools where the<br/>
&gt;children&#39;s joy and souls are sucked dry and replaced with chalkdust.   But<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s not the parents fault.  They&#39;re innocent of any crime if they send their<br/>
&gt;kids to school.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have considered it and I may talk to my dh about him not going back <br/>
&gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; Christmas break. But we will still owe for the tuition and the curriculum<br/>
&gt; &gt; for the year at the school<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Just a thought..........Would you have to pay for what you don&#39;t use......<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;What if there was no money to pay it.......you wouldn&#39;t be able to go .......<br/>

&gt;&lt;&lt; ersonally, I think anyone who can handle the working world at 17 and raise<br/>
&gt;children should easily be able to tackle college classes.** &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;All except the part where you accept oppressive and arbitrary rules and<br/>
&gt;regulations and inflexibility.  Some people are way too smart and experienced<br/>
&gt;in real life to accept the hazing abuse that happens in some classes (NOT ALL<br/>
&gt;OF THE CLASSES!)<br/>
