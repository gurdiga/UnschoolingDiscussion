<div id="ygrps-yiv-128179038">My six year old has been saying that she wants to go to school, on <br/>
and off for several months now. She says she wants homework and to be <br/>
around other kids more. She loves to pretend she&#39;s at school when <br/>
she&#39;s home.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to do things that can help with those desires in other <br/>
ways, like playing school with her at home, inviting kids over, <br/>
taking her to Sunday School each week. She likes all those things, <br/>
but still says pretty adamently that she wants to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve told her that it&#39;s a long day and there&#39;s not a lot of talking <br/>
or playing, that it&#39;s probably different than what she&#39;s picturing. <br/>
She says she still wants to go.<br/>
<br/>
So ... we&#39;re considering maybe enrolling her in the local public <br/>
school just to satisfy this desire of hers, with her being free to <br/>
leave at any time. <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone ever done something like that? How long did your child <br/>
continue going to school? Did they enjoy the experience? Was school <br/>
like what they had pictured?<br/>
<br/>
Any advice, thoughts, or experiences would be appreciated. Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, my daughter went to 2nd grade. It lasted 2 months. She found it  <br/>
great fun at first but eventually the bad points overwhelmed the good  <br/>
points and she decided to come home.<br/>
<br/>
Overall it was a very positive experience since she found out why  <br/>
*she* doesn&#39;t want to go to school instead of, basically, me deciding  <br/>
why she doesn&#39;t want to go to school. It&#39;s ironic. We parents have  <br/>
seen both sides of school and unschool so can choose from knowledge  <br/>
but we&#39;re raising kids who&#39;ve mostly only seen one side so they can&#39;t  <br/>
speak about unschooling with the same authority.<br/>
<br/>
Not that I&#39;m advocating sending all unschooled kids to school to  <br/>
educate them about school! They have the greater advantage of not  <br/>
being damaged by school. Trying school, is of course, different than  <br/>
being trapped there for 12 years. When you know you can come home any  <br/>
time, it&#39;s lots easier to see the nonsense rather than finding ways  <br/>
to adapt and live with it as though it were the truth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-783727777">My 5.5 year old went to three weeks of Kindergarden.  This was BEFORE<br/>
my unschooling days, so please forgive my specific reasons and skewed<br/>
observations of why I took her out, but I did notice that she had<br/>
started being mean to her sister around this time (who knows, maybe<br/>
she connected going to school with her sister being born and me not<br/>
having enough time to spend with her, as I said this was before my<br/>
unschooling days) along with wanting to &quot;veg out&quot; in front of the TV<br/>
(and no wonder, huh?)<br/>
<br/>
Someone on another list said that I should have dug deeper about why<br/>
she wanted to go to school.   Maybe she wanted to own a backpack, or<br/>
go shopping for school supplies, or ride a bus (which was probably her<br/>
favorite part).  All of those can be arranged without actually<br/>
enrolling in school.  Maybe she wants to go to art class or gym class<br/>
or recess.  Perhaps you can arrange those as well.  Perhaps you can<br/>
arrange a visit?  <br/>
