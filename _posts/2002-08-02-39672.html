<br/>
Phonics is for people of all ages who encounter a word that they have not<br/>
seen before. For children starting out in reading, that includes most words.<br/>
Phonics allows them to turn printed letters into familiar sounds. When they<br/>
do that, they can &quot;hear&quot; the word.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Adults have huge databanks full of words that they already recognize and do <br/>
not need to sound out and so they only sound out words that they are <br/>
unfamiliar with.<br/>
<br/>
Kids need to build those big databanks - they don&#39;t have to start by sounding <br/>
out the words, they can just store them AS words, at first, if that works <br/>
well for them. When they&#39;ve stored enough of them, they can discern patterns <br/>
and those patterns will eventually fall into place as phonics rules that <br/>
they&#39;ve internalized, not consciously memorized.<br/>
<br/>
You keep on posting about this as if you&#39;re not reading/understanding what <br/>
others are saying. Maybe you can sound out the words, but not fully <br/>
comprehend the meaning? (Take that as gently teasing and making a point at <br/>
the same time, okay? &lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Not one person has said that people don&#39;t use phonics to sound out words. You <br/>
don&#39;t have to prove that to us.<br/>
<br/>
What they have said is:<br/>
Children do not have to be systematically taught phonics in order to learn to <br/>
read.<br/>
They can learn to sound out words in natural ways as they learn to recognize <br/>
many words and pick up the subtleties of various letter combinations, etc. <br/>
<br/>
LOTS of kids learn that &quot;STOP&quot; means stop - because they see it on stopsigns <br/>
all the time. It can be years later when they realize that the &quot;st&quot; blend <br/>
makes that certain sound in other words too. They might learn it very quickly <br/>
because they might be interested - they might ask: &quot;But WHY does it sound <br/>
like S-T-O-P and parents may say, &quot;Well, the letter &quot;S&quot; often sounds like <br/>
that and the letter &quot;T&quot; often sounds like this and when they&#39;re together you <br/>
just blend them like this and so on.... and the parent may even show them <br/>
some other words that also start with &quot;ST&quot; and they might fool with words <br/>
while driving in the car - see if you can find any other words on billboards <br/>
or signs that have &quot;ST&quot; together in them etc. And so the kid WILL learn <br/>
phonics- but only because the KID has an interest and the parents are <br/>
responsive. OR the kid may come to realize ONLY after learning to read a <br/>
whole bunch of words that HAVE the &quot;st&quot; blend in them - at the beginning, <br/>
middle, and ends of words that it always has that sound. Every kid is <br/>
different, every parent is different, every situation is different -- but the <br/>
one thing that is certain - it is not NECESSARY to teach kids phonics in <br/>
order for them to learn to read. You just cannot argue that it is necessary, <br/>
when faced with first-hand testimonials from many parents of children who <br/>
weren&#39;t taught that way and learned to read just beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
Encouraging people to teach phonics to their kids will come across to most <br/>
people like their kid won&#39;t learn to read &quot;right&quot; unless the parent imposes a <br/>
systematic instructional phonics program on them. There is ENOUGH anxiety <br/>
over the &quot;learning-to-read&quot; issue already. Kids WILL learn phonics - just <br/>
like they will learn lots of other things. Be responsive to your kids - <br/>
answer their questions, surround them with good reasons to read, read to them <br/>
a lot, listen to books on tape, use print materials to find out things they <br/>
want to know, notice written information on signs, ENJOY words, play with <br/>
words and letters and sounds as it comes up naturally. Play games that the <br/>
kids enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
 Don&#39;t endanger your child&#39;s potential ability to read pleasurably by <br/>
imposing phonics lessons because you&#39;re afraid they won&#39;t learn to read <br/>
without them. <br/>
