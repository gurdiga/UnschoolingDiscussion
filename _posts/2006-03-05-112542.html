<div id="ygrps-yiv-487560113">I really really would love to own a couple of Bearded Dragons but can&#39;t  at the moment due to an overzealous grown but doesn&#39;t know it pupster.  He thinks he is still the size he was when we brought him home and  tries to play with wildlife if we don&#39;t catch him in time it ends not  well. <br/>
  We know its play since we have caught and saved many. Thank goodness I  grew up with this breed and knew what to look for to make sure it was  not hunting behaviour.<br/>
  Our local library doesn&#39;t have any books on them. Ferrets, snakes, and Iguanas yes. Dragons no.<br/>
  I would like to read several different care and feeding of to find out what is truly needed to care for them.<br/>
  I only need titles and authors so I can ask for an interlibrary loan.<br/>
  My sn child wants to be a herpetologist too. And he has plowed through  the two shelves of reptiles and amphibians so I thought he and I could  study this together:) <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019788911">We have 2 bearded dragons that are almost a year old.  I couldn&#39;t <br/>
locate the book we have, but we bought it from a local reptile store.  <br/>
They are the best repitles we have had so far.  We had an iguana and <br/>
some snakes.  My dd wants to be a vet.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see a problem with other animals around.  We have 2 dogs, 3 <br/>
cats and the dragons.  The cats like to watch the dragons eat their <br/>
crickets.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I locate the book, I&#39;ll post the name.  Their actually <br/>
pretty easy to raise, we have had ours since they were 3 days old.  <br/>
They eat crickets everyday and they need heat and a dry environment.  <br/>
If you have any questions you can email me off the list.  Both of ours <br/>
are in 40 gallon tanks.<br/>
