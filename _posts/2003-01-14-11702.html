When I go to the dentist, I&#39;m back on my unit study about Trains!! He&#39;s a <br/>
train-fanatic, and photographs trains on trestles as a hobby.  He has great <br/>
photos he&#39;s taken, a bell off a steam engine in one of the examining rooms, <br/>
all the calendars are train stuff...<br/>

the boys aren&#39;t in school, I&#39;ll say :&quot; They are home schooling, and <br/>

I hope you&#39;re wearing a denim jumper when you say that!<br/>
And the boys should have their hair freshly combed and be wearing slacks and <br/>
dress shirts.<br/>
