<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246171159"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;Now, don&#39;t get me wrong -- he is very polite and respectful and gets along<br/>
&gt; well with adults, but he seems to think he is 16 or something, instead of 9.<br/>
&gt; He acts like he thinks the other kids are childish.  He is certainly a bright,<br/>
&gt; sharp kid --<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your son sounds like mine, only older.  Mine is 6.  He doesn&#39;t go to Sunday<br/>
school, because it&#39;s just like that.  I spent a lot of time worrying about<br/>
some of those questions a couple months ago, and then I decided that he is<br/>
who he is, he&#39;s growing up to be a perfectly fine kid, and I&#39;m ok with who<br/>
he is.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that unschooled kids ARE different than other kids, and we helped<br/>
make them that way, by choosing to unschool, so we shouldn&#39;t be vastly<br/>
surprised!  I also think that just like we have people we do and don&#39;t like,<br/>
so do kids.  I can easily see where a giggly group of girls wouldn&#39;t be your<br/>
son&#39;s style!  I disagree with the teacher, fail to see the problem and think<br/>
that your son is probably just fine as he is. (Although sitting in the<br/>
classroom once, just to be sure, might not be a bad idea),<br/>
<br/>
I would have concerns about a child who couldn&#39;t make any friends, couldn&#39;t<br/>
play in any group, or work with other kids on anything.  There would be real<br/>
issues there.  But that&#39;s not how you describe you son.  He has friends,<br/>
groups, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
I have to also disagree with the teacher that he needs to have do things he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do, and have to go along with a group.  People design theirv<br/>
lives based on their own needs.  Some people specifically choose jobs where<br/>
they don&#39;t work with other people, and most people try to do things they are<br/>
interested in, so they aren&#39;t stuck doing things they don&#39;t want to.  On the<br/>
other hand, your son isn&#39;t going to be 9 forever, either!  He will grow and<br/>
change a lot before he ever gets to choosing a job or profession.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it depends on how many waves you&#39;re willing to make, but in the<br/>
end, this is about what you believe vs. what the teacher believes.  You<br/>
could challenge the teacher and his &quot;supervisor&quot;, if your Sunday school has<br/>
one, or just let it pass.  I doubt that you&#39;ll change his mind, though,<br/>
either way.  <br/>
