&lt;&lt; Hi Liz I had to write to you on the subject of your 14 yr old. I also have <br/>
a 14<br/>
 yr old that went to ps  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Becky and Liz...<br/>
<br/>
I have a 14yodd who NEVER went to ps.....well, she went to Montessori Pre-K <br/>
and K, but that was all.  She is showing some of the same symptoms...the <br/>
difference for her is that she is a rhythmic gymnast and trains 5 hours a <br/>
day, 6 days a week, so that takes up a lot of her time.  When she comes home, <br/>
though, it&#39;s right to the computer to check her mail and talk with her <br/>
friends (some of whom she just left at the gym!!).  She doesn&#39;t watch much <br/>
TV, but music is important to her (and all of her friends).  <br/>
<br/>
I look at what she does though and I can put &quot;education&quot; of some sort to <br/>
almost everything.....gym = physical education; computer time = reading, <br/>
writing composition, spelling and typing skills; gymnastics notebook that she <br/>
is required by coach to keep = handwriting, spelling, some French terms; gym <br/>
time = socialization; injuries = anatomy and physiology and kinesiology.  I <br/>
recently got her her own ATM card for her to use to access her allowance for <br/>
expenses at the gym - drinks, etc. - and that makes her use her math/life <br/>
skills.  We recently got back from vacation and that took care of history, <br/>
geology, social studies and American Literature (we went to Key West and <br/>
studied the history and geology of the Keys, visited Hemingway&#39;s home, etc.). <br/>
 We will take the occasional trip to our Science Museum, but, compared to <br/>
others we&#39;ve been in, it&#39;s not so hot and really doesn&#39;t hold much of <br/>
anything interesting in it...so, for science we get the Experiment of the <br/>
Week from Robert Krampf emailed to us.....they&#39;re just simple science <br/>
experiments that you can do at home, but I put them in her folder and that <br/>
takes care of Science.<br/>
<br/>
I think that maybe what we&#39;re experiencing right now is just 14yo stuff ... <br/>
and I&#39;m not sure it isn&#39;t happening to all of them!!  Her friends....some are <br/>
us/hs and others are ps ... are going through pretty much the same thing.  <br/>
Maybe we should just relax and not blame ourselves or our decision to <br/>
unschool them as part of &quot;the&quot; problem.<br/>
<br/>
I think unschooling requires a certain amount of faith....faith in yourself <br/>
that you knew what was right for your child, faith in your child that he/she <br/>
will learn what they need to know, and faith that it will all turn out OK in <br/>
the end.  After all, we adults have gaps in our education...things we have <br/>
learned and forgotten or things we never learned.  What do WE do if we find <br/>
we have to learn about something?  We go out and find someone or something to <br/>
teach us.....our kids will do that too.  Maybe at 14 ... not a child, not an <br/>
adult... they&#39;re in a sort of limbo for a little while. <br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m rambling, but at least I made ME feel a little better.....LOL!!  One <br/>
thing about 14yo people....they surprise you all the time and keep you on <br/>
your toes!!!<br/>

Heck, who wants to drive when there&#39;s no parking and the trains come every<br/>
five minutes or less? LOL.<br/>
Bicycle safety , OTOH, is a big  problem. Helmets are practically unheard<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I thought this interesting, culturally speaking.  I lived in Haiti for 18<br/>
months and never drove and never planned to. If we go back to Haiti, I will<br/>
be very surprised if I will drive this time.  Too many road hazards, danger<br/>
of getting the car stolen, etc.  And I defintiely would never go anwhere<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
But, in North Dakota where I live now (and go places alone all the time), a<br/>
child can get their license at 14 years old.  But of course, there is little<br/>
traffic and half these kids have been driving tractors since they were 7.<br/>
My son who is 15 today, has no interest in getting a license and would<br/>
prefer to wait until he is 16 so he doesn&#39;t have to take drivers ed.  He<br/>
told me there is no reason to get a driver&#39;s license because there is no<br/>
where to go!<br/>

also- I ordered that book &quot;First things First&quot;  for *one dollar* -<br/>
