I had a different understanding of shele428&#39;s posting than Sandra&#39;s response. <br/>
 I understood shele428 to be saying not to judge all christian homeschoolers <br/>
as being limited in scope and that not all fundamentalist and christian <br/>
homeschoolers are pushy, school at home types.  (She being a case in point.)  And <br/>
that assuming anything about &quot;all&quot; christian homeschoolers is a form of bigotry. <br/>
 Shele428, did i get this right?  Perhaps I misunderstood.<br/>

I don&#39;t think any of us have ever said ALL Christian homeschoolers are <br/>
fundamentalists or that all fundamentalists are pushy school-at-home types. But the <br/>
majority ARE. And if someone is not aware of this very vocal movement they <br/>
should be. I am a Christian, but not a fundamentalist, and I have some views that <br/>
many Christians would probably consider unchristian, I&#39;m sure. As such I&#39;m in <br/>
a minority amongst the fundamentalist-rigid-child suppressing-Christian-Right <br/>
Wing-School-at-homers (as a Christian who homeschools particularly unschools <br/>
because most who are like the above do not unschool) and with unschoolers as <br/>
well. (But I am accepted with unschoolers; Christian or not where I would never <br/>
be with the above mentioned.) <br/>
<br/>
It is too bad that there are degrees of Christianity. And anyone who would <br/>
say there aren&#39;t is lying to himself. I am active in my church; participate on <br/>
various councils, women&#39;s group, youth leader, etc. But there are those who <br/>
would say after all that that I am not a good Christian nor am I the &quot;right&quot; kind <br/>
of Christian. I don&#39;t wear a dress every day, I don&#39;t sit my kids down at 8 <br/>
am sharp every morning for prayer and lessons, I don&#39;t go to the &quot;right&quot; <br/>
church, I don&#39;t practice wifely submission, I don&#39;t read my bible everyday ... Then <br/>
there are the things I do! I do believe in women&#39;s rights, I do listen to all <br/>
sorts of music, I do believe in listening to my kids and truly hearing their <br/>
voices and opinions, I do &quot;allow&quot; them to participate in sports and mingle with <br/>
all sorts of other motley children, I do &quot;allow&quot; interests and individualism <br/>
.... All of which make me unfit as a Christian in their eyes. <br/>
<br/>
So where I see the OP&#39;s point in that using the word fundie for <br/>
fundamentalist is a slight or slur, I must object to the insinuation that its use makes for <br/>
bigotry. Because I will be friends with you no strings attached I don&#39;t care <br/>
if you wear a dress or not, worship trees or God or nothing. But Mary down the <br/>
street won&#39;t give you or me the time of day because I have cage free kids and <br/>
no matter what committee I join, or how often I go to church it will never be <br/>
right or enough in her eyes. So who is the bigot?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, I think that was me who used the word fundie.  If the word <br/>
bothered you, I do apologize.  I didn&#39;t mean harm -- it was shorter <br/>
than typing out fundamentalist, and that was the only reason I used <br/>
it.  I didn&#39;t mean a slur, just something that wasn&#39;t for me.<br/>
