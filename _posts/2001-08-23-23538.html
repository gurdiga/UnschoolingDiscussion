<br/>
I had another thought occur to me in regards to your converstaion with your<br/>
friend. (or any teacher) Teachers are paid to teach, if kids can learn on<br/>
their own then teachers aren&#39;t needed in the same capacity. You see teachers<br/>
have to teach the curriculum to the kids because it is being introduced<br/>
before the child is ready. The mentality of the school seems to be &quot;teach<br/>
them now so when they need it they already know it&quot;. However, the heart of<br/>
the unschooler is when they need it, they will learn it. Once a child<br/>
realizes they need it they learn it very quickly. While in school, however,<br/>
they are being forced to learn something they do not need and so it takes<br/>
much longer.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize if I just confused everyone! LOL  I am trying to do three things<br/>
at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
You all have a great day!!<br/>
