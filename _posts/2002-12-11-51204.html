<div id="ygrps-yiv-884719665">At our house we have the big bed and the little bed. People (and <br/>
cats) are free to sleep where they wish. Sometimes Dad and <br/>
Nick sleep in the big bed (he loves to sleep with dad!), <br/>
sometimes Nick and I. I have even been known to shack up with <br/>
dad in the little bed. We have also been known to switch in the <br/>
middle of the night. Ever go to the bathroom just to come back <br/>
and find your spot in the bed gone? <br/>
<br/>
I grew up with lots of people in a very small house. By necessity I <br/>
slept with my parents, my grandmother, or one of my three <br/>
sisters until I was about 8 or 9. Even after I got my own bed I still <br/>
shared a room with my sis until I was 13 or 14. Even now when I <br/>
go home to visit my mom either I sleep with her, or Nick does, or <br/>
Nick sleeps with me. Co-sleeping has always been a very <br/>
pleasant and comforting part of my life.<br/>

don&#39;t know that this is why she&#39;s very needy at bedtime, it could just be a <br/>
personality thing.<br/>
I have one that in spite of being allowed to sleep anywhere, only sleeps well <br/>
in his own bed. He&#39;s a home body in a lot of ways, and he&#39;s my oldest!<br/>
If she wants to sleep over, but needs you at night, then her need for you is <br/>
outweighing her need for independence.<br/>
Eventually, if you keep on being a comfort when she needs it, she will decide <br/>
she is strong enough to do this on her own.<br/>
If she is really bothered by the fact that she can&#39;t sleep over, I would help <br/>
her with some of the ideas that were previously listed. Also have her go to <br/>
sleep overs with the knowledge that she can call you at any time to go pick <br/>
her up should she change her mind. Just knowing that she isn&#39;t stuck could <br/>
make her more confident.<br/>
Or plan on picking her up late, so she enjoys the fun parts without the <br/>
bedtime stress.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think Ren was exerting her evening or practices on anyone.   She was just sharing.  And isn&#39;t that what this list is?  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think we all know that every family does things differently,  but don&#39;t you think that those families that have done unschooling for years will know what is best to have a successful unschooling life?    They&#39;ve lived it.   Several of these long time posters have done it for 10 years or longer!        <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only been doing this whole unschooling life for maybe 6 months and I know I don&#39;t know a fraction of what Sandra or Tia or Ren (and others) know.     I probably post too much,     but you know what?   I am learning so much! I am glad that Ren posts her evenings and Sandra too.  They aren&#39;t telling me that what I do is wrong,  they are just saying that these types of things are working for them.  And these things are definitely unschooling things in an unschooling life.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve gathered on some of these struggles/conflicts, not just this one, but others that have come up also, not just you Teresa, is that when people are new to unschooling it seems that unschooling is  separate from the rest of their life.  And I am not saying your life is this way. I don&#39;t know your life.   I am talking in generalities.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know that when I started, I thought our unschooling would only be the way we learned about things,  well, for us to unschool successfully, it has come into our whole life, all aspects--parenting, working, playing--basically living life.  And perhaps this is where the conflict lies,   perhaps different parenting styles and lifestyles do work successfully, but the question is -- will these different parenting styles and lifestyles actually foster a successful unschooling environment??  And, I think, that this is what this list is all about.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would think that experience does have some benefits.    I can only look back on the last 6 months or so,  others can look back on years and years.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone can take this with an open heart, I am not trying to be preachy or anything,  I&#39;m just trying to get across what I&#39;ve seen happen a few times.  <br/>

her up should she change her mind. Just knowing that she isn&#39;t stuck could <br/>

<br/>
Holly used to call us lots, so the deal with her on overnights was how far it <br/>
was from our house.  Only once were we unable to pick her up, and the other <br/>
times Keith or I went over and got her.  Usually about 11:00 or 11:30.<br/>
<br/>
When a family let the kid stay up late, Holly was fine.  She would play and <br/>
then fall asleep talking.  But if the parents had a 10:00 go-to-sleep deal, <br/>
Holly would try and try and fail, and finally get spooked listening to the <br/>
noises in another house, and get frustrated from being wide awake and fearing <br/>
to wake other people up.  A couple of times she cried in the morning because <br/>
she would have liked to have been there for breakfast and more playing.    <br/>
When it was walking distance, sometimes she went back.  Other times, we just <br/>
comforted her and said &quot;Maybe next time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mom would have said &quot;NO&quot; to overnighters if I had gotten that way.  But I <br/>
think of it this way:  I preferred an overnight visit in a scary, <br/>
uncomfortable house to being home many times because I wasn&#39;t let out enough <br/>
and I was curious and needy for knowing about other people and other places.  <br/>
Holly isn&#39;t needy, and she feels safer and more comfortable in her own house <br/>
than I did.   So I look at what&#39;s good about it instead of what&#39;s a failure <br/>
and an irritation.<br/>
<br/>
Holly asked me when she was already pretty old, like seven or so, how people <br/>
go to sleep.  &quot;How do people go to sleep when they want to, mom?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to her about breathing more shallowly and stilling her mind, <br/>
getting comfortable and warm, thinking about feeling the way you do when <br/>
you&#39;re asleep... and somewhere in there it came up that she didn&#39;t know <br/>
people closed their eyes.  I hadn&#39;t thought to mention it.  My mom used to <br/>
say &quot;SHUT YOUR EYES&quot; at naptime so much that my mom came to settle for me <br/>
sqeezing my eyes shut and just being still on the bed to pass for a nap.   So <br/>
&quot;shut your eyes&quot; was the total given for me.  I didn&#39;t know I had never told <br/>
Holly to close her eyes and go to sleep.<br/>

open.  I now say yes, if they want to rest and not sleep, that&#39;s ok.  That&#39;s <br/>
why we call it quiet time now.  And most of the time they aren&#39;t quiet.  But <br/>

<br/>
What &quot;works&quot; for each family is going to be very different from home to home <br/>
because you have individuals with different needs/personalities etc....<br/>
But if you&#39;re talking about whether or not to give children freedom of <br/>
choice, I will always advocate for the child.<br/>
Yes, every family should take their children seriously. Every family should <br/>
consider their children important enough to have equal say in how things are <br/>
run.<br/>
Beyond that basic principle of freedom, no one is going to do things just <br/>
like my family, nor would I advocate it.<br/>
That would be ignoring the unique blend of people that makes up your family.<br/>

was married the first time, he worked nights and I worked days, so I didn&#39;t <br/>
have to sleep with him, either.  Then I was single for a few years and the <br/>
boys slept together.  Then current hubby travelled for a long time, so I <br/>
didn&#39;t sleep much with him, either.  I like it that way!  I don&#39;t want anyone <br/>
snoring in my ear or furnacing up the bed.  I&#39;ve tolerated my youngest for <br/>
these 9 years, but he&#39;s reaching snoring age, too!  <br/>
<br/>
As soon as I get these young adults out of the house for good (10 years, <br/>
maybe? &lt;g&gt;), I&#39;m getting my own room!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-836690828">This whole sleep over thing has me remembering.  My daughter has only gone<br/>
to one sleep over in her life (as in party type thing, she has stayed at<br/>
other peoples houses when we had to be out of town and such).  We had told<br/>
her she could call and tell us at anytime to come get her and we would.<br/>
Well, when everyone else was going to sleep, and she didn&#39;t think she could,<br/>
she wanted to come home.  She told her friend&#39;s mom that she wanted to come<br/>
home and she wanted to call us.  The mother did not want her to call and<br/>
kept telling her she shouldn&#39;t do that.  Of course, being our daughter, she<br/>
argued with the mom until the mom let her call us.  We of course,<br/>
immediately went and picked her up and assured her that she did the right<br/>
thing and her friend&#39;s mom was wrong not to let her call!  She has never<br/>
gone to a sleep over since.<br/>
<br/>
So, just for your info, make sure the other child&#39;s parents are willing to<br/>
let her leave if she wants to!<br/>
<br/>
many blessings,<br/>

no matter what time it is.  And to the parents who tell me this when their <br/>
kids are here I reply, &quot;I&#39;ll make sure he knows where the phone is!&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I rocked my babies at those times when they were wide-awake and staring <br/>
straight into my eyes and I just couldn&#39;t stay up with them another hour, I <br/>
would pretend to fall asleep.  Rock rock, lids drop and open, rock rock, lids <br/>
drop more slowly, rock rock, eyes lose focus, rock rock, baby&#39;s eyes begin to <br/>
mimic mine.  I swear, they would just fall right to sleep just like that, as <br/>
long as they were relaxed enough to maintain my gaze.  Otherwise, they would <br/>
have just kept those big brown globes peeled until I was too sleepy from <br/>
rocking to get out of the rocking chair!  <br/>
<br/>
Strictly the power of suggestion.  Sometimes a mom needs to get the baby to <br/>
sleep, you know?  <br/>

she didn&#39;t like it she could call and get picked up.  The teacher wouldn&#39;t<br/>
let her call.  Skye still wanted to try it the next day so Heather sent her<br/>
with a note saying to let her call.  She still wouldn&#39;t let her.  (Actually<br/>
this teacher was the perfect teacher for Skye to try school with.  There was<br/>
no way Skye wanted to stay, though she did last a week.  There was some<br/>
performance coming up that she wanted to be in.)<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;ve had a kid over here who was uncomfortable and wanted to go home,<br/>
I&#39;ve usually asked them to try for just a little bit longer to see if they<br/>
can fall asleep.  If they can&#39;t, I call the parents.  And if they weren&#39;t<br/>
comfortable with that, I&#39;d call right away.<br/>

It&#39;s the trying that&#39;s keeping them awake.  Sometimes I&#39;ll tell them to see<br/>
if they can stay awake all night.  I&#39;ve never had one be able to do it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Can&#39;t you videotape it so she can watch it the next day? &gt;&gt;<br/>

I STILL have not figured out how to record shows, and it&#39;s not like I&#39;m some <br/>
idiot with directions. It&#39;s ok though, Cuz I have no problem with her staying <br/>
up to watch something she likes.<br/>
I like staying up and watching it too.<br/>
If I was too tired it&#39;d be one thing, but I am usually happy to be up late.<br/>
And we get to cuddle in my bed, there&#39;s a tv in there. A nice time. If she&#39;s <br/>
melting down it works well because I can get her away from the boys who are <br/>
watching stuff in the living room and be in my room together. She gets Mom <br/>
loves and doesn&#39;t miss a tv show.<br/>
Most of the time when she&#39;s tired, she could care less about tv though. <br/>
Reading books or chit chat is what she prefers....<br/>

Put in a tape and hit &quot;record&quot;?<br/>
I don&#39;t mean learning to program the VCR. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
If one person&#39;s awake, it can be recorded for the little ones asleep.<br/>
<br/>
But it would need to be set up so there&#39;s input into the VCR too, not just <br/>
output.  I&#39;d come over and do it if you were in town. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

You may just have a lemon of a VCR. Try contacting the manufacturer or<br/>
looking up their website. If you have a problem chances are others do<br/>
too, and there may have been a class action suit to address it, and they<br/>
will pay to have repairs done. We had a similar issue with a CD player,<br/>
and it turns out to be a ubiquitous problem with that model that can be<br/>
fixed. BTW, do you know how fantastic a satellite dish is with its hard<br/>
drive recording capabilities (30 hours)?<br/>
