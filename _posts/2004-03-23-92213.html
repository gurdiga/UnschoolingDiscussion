<br/>
Hi Everyone, <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
When my girls were really little (say 3 and 5) they brought their <br/>
dollies to the library one day and one of them spanked the doll and <br/>
told her she was bad.  I almost died because back before I had <br/>
children, if I had seen that behavior, I would have assumed they <br/>
were mimicking what they had learned at home.  Well, they certainly <br/>
didn&#39;t get that from me and I was horrified to think that someone <br/>
might think that.  Well, now I don&#39;t worry so much about what other <br/>
people think unless it is a friend and something the girls do makes <br/>
them feel uncomfortable.  That is the case concerning the following <br/>
behaviors that I would like some insight on.<br/>
 <br/>
 My sweet little girls (ages 7 and 9) have a bit of an off sense of <br/>
humor. (ok, a lot of an off sense of humor! LOL!)  For instance, <br/>
when we first got the Sims games, while playing, a Sim accidentally <br/>
caught on fire while it was cooking and it died.  They thought it <br/>
was a riot that the grim reaper came and from that point on they <br/>
purposely caught their sims on fire.  (made sure they had No cooking <br/>
skill points so the fires would happen.)  They thought it was a riot <br/>
and anything like this just cracks them up.  Of course, they shared <br/>
this information with their friend who is 9 and she thought it was <br/>
hilarious too and she started doing the same thing.  I have <br/>
commented to the girls, as they burn their Sims, that &quot;that is just <br/>
awful.&quot; (image running through my head of children growing up <br/>
lacking empathy for others and other horrible thoughts.)  It does <br/>
make me feel bad that they think it&#39;s fun to torture their computer <br/>
people but I figure that is my issue so after several comments to <br/>
the effect that I thought it was awful, I stopped commenting on it <br/>
and really let it go.  I know they like to get a rise out of me and <br/>
that is part of the fun of doing these things but I don&#39;t think that <br/>
is their driving force..they just truly think it is funny.<br/>
 <br/>
Along the same lines, they have these beanie babies that they love <br/>
and play with *every* day. (and have for three years)  But they <br/>
think it is really funny to do torturous things to them.  When I am <br/>
brushing their hair, if I snag a not, they punch Pellet (the <br/>
beanie)  and laugh.  And when they are playing with their friend <br/>
they make their Pellets do things that are against societies <br/>
expectations (like steal or kill) and then they punch them or beat <br/>
them and tell them they are bad.  Both of the girls and their friend <br/>
think this is *so* funny.  It does make me squirm inside sometimes <br/>
but I just bite my tongue and find something else to do other than <br/>
focus on it because they are really sweet girls and I know they <br/>
would never even cut in line, let alone hurt someone.  <br/>
 <br/>
My friend has told me that she feels uncomfortable with this type of <br/>
play.  She asked me to help her come to grips with it as she <br/>
realizes the reason she feels uncomfortable are her issues.  I <br/>
really don&#39;t know what to tell her since it really makes me <br/>
uncomfortable too.  My kids have re-assured me that they would never <br/>
do that to someone in real life and that Pellet isn&#39;t real and the <br/>
Sims aren&#39;t real.  And they would never even do it to the stuffed <br/>
animals that they take comfort in and cuddle.  <br/>
 <br/>
My girls are generally seen by outsiders as quiet, shy girls.  They <br/>
adore animals and we have many pets. They are gentle with all <br/>
animals and children.   They do like getting a rise or a laugh out <br/>
of  people they are comfortable with and that is part of the reason <br/>
they do what they do.  (Can we shock Auntie? Or can we make Suzie <br/>
laugh?)  I talk to my girls about EVERYTHING and we don&#39;t have any <br/>
hard fast rules at our house.  They do respect what I say and if I <br/>
sat them down and told them that it really made my friend <br/>
uncomfortable, I am sure they would try and stop doing it. (even <br/>
though they might not understand her concern)  BUT, they really have <br/>
a lot of fun doing these things and I hate to be a the poop in the <br/>
punch bowl when they are just having fun and it really isn&#39;t hurting <br/>
anyone. At the same time, I adore my friend and I want her to be <br/>
comfortable hanging out with us.  So, do you have any advice I can <br/>
share with my friend to help her through these feelings or do you <br/>
feel that I should talk to the girls about how it is making my <br/>
friend uncomfortable? <br/>
 <br/>

That sounds worth doing.<br/>
And maybe forward the e-mail you just sent us to your friend, and let her <br/>
know you&#39;re concerned on one level, and not ultimately worried on another.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly has had fun playing Harvest Moon &quot;wrong&quot; sometimes.  She plays &quot;right&quot; <br/>
long enough that one of the girls wants to marry her character (the main <br/>
character is a young male) and then starts flirting with all the other girls to see <br/>
what happens.  She leaves her animals out in the rain to see what will <br/>
happen.  She learned that watering the chicken made it invisible.  She took a <br/>
chicken and left it in town.<br/>
<br/>
Me, I felt bad knowing this.  It was as though Holly were being cruel.  It&#39;s <br/>
a GAME!  Not even at the reality level of stuffed animals.  But I was the one <br/>
with the problem, not Holly.<br/>
<br/>
There wasn&#39;t any cruelty involved.  She was curious about whether the <br/>
programmers had considered what would happen if you did unexpected things.   <br/>
<br/>
If you leave a chicken at church, it doesn&#39;t get hungry. &lt;g&gt;  That might be <br/>
useful to people playing SNES Harvest Moon who have run out of feed or money.<br/>
<br/>
No real chickens are harmed in the playing of Harvest Moon.<br/>
<br/>
Last night she was playing Zombies Ate My Neighbors.  It didn&#39;t make her want <br/>
to go out with real power tools and fight real zombies.<br/>

Well, that was easier than I would have guessed.  I just spoke with the<br/>
girls and told them that their talk was making my friend uncomfortable.  I<br/>
asked them if they would be willing to try to stop talking like that when we<br/>
are with our friends.  They both seemed very understanding and said they<br/>
would try to stop talking/behaving like that.  They looked very concerned.  <br/>

From the time the girls were little, they have always found *creative* ways<br/>
to play games.  They have done things with their Sims (and other games) that<br/>
I just never would have thought of.  The programmers obviously thought of it<br/>
because there was always a response to their action.  They have also starved<br/>
the fish in Sims and things like that.  They just want to see what happens<br/>
really and wouldn&#39;t starve their own fish on purpose.  <br/>
 <br/>
Harvest Moon sounds like an game that would interest my girls.  I am sure<br/>
they&#39;d love to leave a chicken in town to starve.  ;0)<br/>

and admitted they have often created sims JUST to be able to kill them <br/>
off in creative ways &lt;G&gt;.  Rox says it started because you want to get <br/>
rid of the first sims you get - they are boring - but you don&#39;t want to <br/>
lose all their furniture and everything if you delete them. So - if <br/>
they die, you keep their stuff &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Then, like Holly, they want to see what the programmers have come up <br/>
with for the weirdest choices they can think of making. (And, yes, the <br/>
programmers must be even weirder, because sometimes very funny things <br/>
happen that show it had actually occurred to the programmers that <br/>
somebody might make that weird choice.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-121444053">Kids aren&#39;t the only ones that do strange things to<br/>
Sims. <br/>
My aunt (40+) takes her frustrations out on the Sims.<br/>
If she gets too upset, sometimes she will play the<br/>
Sims and put them in the pool then take away the<br/>
ladder -- eventually they drown. Also, she makes a<br/>
family, makes nice kids and horrible parents and then<br/>
enjoys watching them turn on each other and fight. <br/>
It sounds weird, but better than taking your<br/>
frustrations out on humans.<br/>
We also had ways of playing the same way as kids. It<br/>
was the GI Joe&#39;s, Barbies, etc that we experimented<br/>
with to feel out what happens & relationships. Kids<br/>
nowadays have the advantage of technology to help them<br/>
experiment :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1631831572">I was trying to think of ways that I might have played as a kid that might<br/>
have been similar and the only thing that I could think of was that we used<br/>
to chase the neighborhood boys around trying to beat them with sticks or<br/>
boards...even boards with nails in them.  LOL!  It wasn&#39;t often that we<br/>
actually caught them and I can&#39;t even remember why we were chasing them.<br/>
(Probably just because they were boys.)  <br/>
 <br/>
I also used to tie my beloved Reddy Bear (he was a red bear) on a rope by<br/>
his lovely neck and throw him into the lake so he could go swimming. (I<br/>
wasn&#39;t really trying to drown him though.)  I remember once it was a really<br/>
cold blustery day and I was doing this and the rope came untied.  He began<br/>
to float away and I asked my mother to save him. She said no and I valiantly<br/>
jumped into the cold lake in all my clothes to save him.  I really loved<br/>
that bear even though I was hanging him by the neck and throwing him into<br/>
the lake.<br/>
 <br/>
Back to Sims...My kids have the cheats to Sims and after they put a Sim in<br/>
the shower, they thought to move the shower because the Sim is only fuzzied<br/>
out when he is getting in the shower and not when he is in the Shower.  LOL!<br/>
They just wanted to see what a Sim looked like naked.  Who of thunk???  It<br/>
would have never crossed my mind.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for all the comments everyone.  I feel better about the fact that<br/>
they do these things and I feel better knowing they will try not to while<br/>
visiting with our friends.<br/>

Maybe you could explain to your friend that this is the girls&#39; way of <br/>

morbid jokes work? Faced with our own frailty, they allow us to laugh <br/>

Oh that is the absolute truth!!!!  I used to do prehospital ambulance work.  I also worked in the ER and I currently work in a Trauma ICU.<br/>

We wouldn&#39;t be able to do what we do without that sick sense of humor we have.  <br/>

Its not meant to be insensitive.  Its meant to be an experience shared among those who live it with us.  Sort of like war buddies.<br/>
