Do you happen to remember the link for that website or what the name was?<br/>
At the age of 8 my dd was reading at a 5th grade level and I am curious to<br/>

Kids need to read at grade level in school because the textbooks are written<br/>
&quot;at grade level&quot;. In real life, what&#39;s important is whether the content is<br/>
meeting their needs.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re taking a leisurely whimsical ramble through the woods and realize<br/>
there are milestones for a &quot;proper&quot; walk, what would be the reason for<br/>
checking our &quot;progress&quot; on the milestones if our walk was suiting our needs?<br/>
If we recognize that what we are discovering and exploring on our walk is<br/>
what is meaningful and someone else&#39;s milestones are meaningless, then<br/>
there&#39;s no reason to check our progress against someone else&#39;s . Our<br/>
progress is how well our exploration is meeting *our* needs. If we decide<br/>
someone else&#39;s milestones are important -- and why would we check if we<br/>
didn&#39;t think there was some importance to them? -- then how possible is it<br/>
to continue meeting our own needs without being conscious of there being a<br/>
&quot;right&quot; or &quot;more important&quot; or &quot;better&quot; agenda?<br/>

It&#39;s been over a year for us since we&#39;ve checked any of the books our DD <br/>
reads for &quot;grade level&quot;. Honestly, we don&#39;t even worry about that anymore. <br/>
I know this question wasn&#39;t really addressed to me, but I thought it an <br/>
interesting question.&lt;g&gt; But when we first saw the site way back when, it <br/>
was more of an &quot;ah, okay, she&#39;s fine&quot; kind of thing, and we&#39;ve never been <br/>
back. Besides, a lot of the books we have weren&#39;t even on the list :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree also with this line of thinking. It&#39;s just like my niece had this <br/>
big major problem with my baby being 3 months younger than hers and Alyssa <br/>
would already be crawling and walking when her&#39;s wasn&#39;t. She would actually <br/>
call her baby lazy and made a big deal out of it. I&#39;ve had 3 kids walk at 8 <br/>
months and 1 at a year. They&#39;re all walking fine now. 1 very early talker <br/>
and 3 very late talkers. The late &quot;bloomers&quot; will give the early one a run <br/>
for her money anyday with their mouths!!!<br/>
<br/>
I see it the same with learning. I know homeschool kids that started reading <br/>
at 5 and others not until 12. By the time they&#39;re 18, you can&#39;t tell the <br/>
difference and they are all reading. So why wonder what level, because I <br/>
think if it does matter, if they are &quot;below&quot; one might not unschool like <br/>
they did before.<br/>
<br/>
I had a sight from the World Book I think it was where they list for each <br/>
grade level what children &quot;should&quot; be learning. When the kids were little, <br/>
like 4, I would check this sight and see that they already knew stuff ahead <br/>
of what was mentioned. Then I started to think about what difference it made <br/>
and thought about what we are doing here and how I feel about it. Haven&#39;t <br/>
looked at it since.<br/>
<br/>
I once asked my husband, (to see if we were on the same wavelength) before <br/>
our 2 were reading, what would happen if they were 12 and still not reading? <br/>
He said he would have no problem with that. He said if they got to be 18, <br/>
then he might start worrying!!! Good thing we click on this.<br/>

In response to your questions:<br/>
   What if she isn&#39;t reading 3 levels beyond her age any more? What if she&#39;s at<br/>
   grade level?<br/>
<br/>
   Or what if she&#39;s reading *below* grade level? What will you do? How will you<br/>
   feel?<br/>
<br/>
When I first started homeschooling her,  we tried Hooked on Phonics which resulted<br/>
in tears of frustration.  Both on her part and mine.  That was the end of &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I always said that if I made sure she could read then everything else she wanted to<br/>
learn would be at her disposal.  We do not have a curriculum, or worksheets, or workbooks<br/>
for that matter.  We just live our lives one day at a time with no regard to &quot;school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So to answer your questions,  I know that she is were she needs to be to do whatever she<br/>
chooses.  If she wants to read a novel by Stephen King for example, she would do just<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever level she is at is fine with me.  She will progress at her own pace as she always has.<br/>
How I feel about that is not important.  I will not force her to read more to improve her abilities.<br/>
I won&#39;t resort to &quot;school&quot; again at any cost. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this answers your questions.<br/>

often a good time to stop and to ask yourself why! :-)<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t put much stock in &quot;reading levels,&quot; truly.  <br/>
<br/>
It works on a formula for the length of sentence and average word length.  <br/>
It&#39;s not about the ideas in the writing, or the complexity of short <br/>
sentences.   It&#39;s a very mechanical (and lame) formula.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750149078">I have lifted one little bit from another homeschooling list.  NOT an <br/>
unschooling list, but general homeschooling:<br/>
<br/>
-=-You might try the BOB series that any school supply store should have. <br/>
They are simple and you get immediate results from them I used them on some <br/>
of mine and they were all reading by age 41/2. Hope this helps -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reading a Bob book gets &quot;immediate results,&quot; perhaps, but what they are <br/>
reading (at age 4 1/2 or whatever) is...  a Bob book.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak French, but I took it for two years in high school and a year <br/>
in college.  I can interpret things in writing.  I can follow subtitles <br/>
sometimes to see how they translated something.  <br/>
<br/>
Reading a Bob book isn&#39;t fluent reading, and is (in my opinion) nothing to <br/>
get excited about. <br/>
<br/>
Someone &quot;riding&quot; a stationary bike is not riding a bike.<br/>
Someone riding a mechanical bull is not a bullrider (Kirby slipped into a <br/>
line of should&#39;ve-been-18-or-older and rode the mechanical bull at the state <br/>
fair, and hurt himself badly enough he couldn&#39;t teach karate on Tuesday, but <br/>
he didn&#39;t &quot;ride a bull.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
There is building up to reading, which can take months or years.  And then <br/>
there is reading.  Reading without regard to word length or &quot;reading level,&quot; <br/>
but picking up mail or a magazine and reading.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the rush?  Kids in school can&#39;t learn without reading.  Reading is IT <br/>
there. <br/>
<br/>
Kids at home can&#39;t STOP learning, and they don&#39;t NEED to read to learn, <br/>
because they are around people who love them enough to read to them, or to <br/>
bring in videos, or books on tape, or to take the kids out to REAL places <br/>
instead of reading about them in babyfied library books with 36 pages <br/>
designed to be easy enough for little kids to read and do book reports on.  <br/>
<br/>
Those books are a great waste of trees.  Go see some REAL trees, and don&#39;t <br/>
try to rush reading, which can and will come on its own, effortlessly, and <br/>
joyfully.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this is a good analogy or not, but let&#39;s compare it to learning to ride a bike.  To me, reading a bob book from cover to cover and calling it reading is not the same thing as riding a stationary bike and calling it &quot;riding a bike.&quot;  When my middle son learned to ride a bike he did it very gradually, and for a while he would pedal for a short time and then need to put his feet down to catch himself before he tried again.  These short stints of &quot;success&quot; encouraged him and I can&#39;t imagine saying to him &quot;you only did it a little bit, that&#39;s nothing to get excited about.&quot;  It&#39;s been the same thing with bob books in my house.  My first son picked up reading effortlessly... it seemed like he went from not reading at all to reading whatever he wanted.  My second son is approaching it differently... he *isn&#39;t* picking it up as quickly/suddenly as his brother but his interest is *much* greater.  He talks about it all the time... if he &quot;reads&quot; a stop sign, and says &quot;I just read that, didn&#39;t I?!&quot; who am I to tell him, &quot;well you&#39;re not really reading unless you can pick up any newspaper or full length novel and read it.&quot; <br/>
I think that reading a bob book *is* reading, albeit in the early stages, and for some kids it gives them a feeling of success and encouragement to be able to read something, even if it&#39;s something simple, a baby step.  I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with bob books so long as they&#39;re used according to the child&#39;s wishes and not inflicted as a lesson or necessity.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have no easy reading material in your home at all?  No Dr. Seuss or anything like it?  I&#39;m not convinced that phonetically controlled books (dr. seuss- which my kids love- or bob books or any others) are more of a waste of trees than any other reading material.<br/>

<br/>
Rain can play soccer, with kids her age. This is her forth year playing.<br/>
If you threw her in with professional soccer players, though, she<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be able to play soccer- she&#39;s be pretty much running around in<br/>
circles, out of her depth. We used to play soccer with our friend Nathan,<br/>
when he was 4. He proclaimed himself goalie whenever he wanted to pick up<br/>
the ball, and if Rain had tried she could have dribbled circles around<br/>
him. He did kick hard, and he generally kicked in the right direction. We<br/>
said things like, &quot;Hey, Nath, want to play some soccer?&quot; and played with<br/>
him...<br/>

read it (I can&#39;t. I&#39;ve tried, but my comprehension is definitely<br/>
lacking). Reading isn&#39;t a lot of non-reading steps and then a big jump to<br/>
&quot;reading (although with many kids there are &quot;jumps&quot; in fluency, either<br/>
one or more than one) -  it&#39;s a journey, from reading nothing to reading<br/>
everything, and most people are somewhere in the middle.<br/>
<br/>
And about reading levels - a couple of years ago, when Rain was 7ish, she<br/>
read some of the Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle books (although not many - the<br/>
moralism and disrespect towards children became hard to take). A friend<br/>
of mine was teaching second grade then, and she was really impressed. Her<br/>
school used a system of leveling books called the Lexile system, and she<br/>
told me Mrs. Piggle Wiggle books were very high. They are online -<br/>
www.lexile.com - so I went and looked up a few books, and it was totally<br/>
screwy. I don&#39;t remember any examples, but lots of books that had really<br/>
complex ideas and vocabulary were ranked &quot;low&quot;, and books like Mrs.<br/>
Piggle Piggle were ranked around 6th or 7th grade, if I remember right. <br/>

anything like it?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we do.  And when the kids do learn to read, most of that is drivel that <br/>
they won&#39;t read because it&#39;s not ABOUT anything.  They like books that are <br/>
funny or interesting or informative or beautiful, not just strings of easily <br/>
pronounceable words.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m not convinced that phonetically controlled books (dr. seuss- which my <br/>
kids love- or bob books or any others) are more of a waste of trees than any <br/>
other reading material.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mine love the Sneetches and Yertle the Turtle, because the language is good <br/>
and the art is attractive, and the stories are philosophical.  But those <br/>
stories designed JUST for the purposes of early reading are not attractive to <br/>
them--one fish, two fish; hop on pop; those are not in the same category as <br/>
the pale green pants with nobody inside them.<br/>
<br/>
A child who goes a few feet on a bicycle is learning to ride a bike, but when <br/>
there&#39;s a trail-ride picnic on bikes, he&#39;s not ready to go along except in a <br/>
trailer or a kid seat.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found an advantage, outside of school, of claiming a child is <br/>
reading when he or she is only just beginning to sound out &quot;Bob.&quot;  If they <br/>
can only read SOME things then they are reading some things.  <br/>

kind of magic - people looked at marks on a page and translated them into<br/>
stories. It was so amazing to her, and it was such a thrill to be able to<br/>
do it, even a little bit. A couple of years later driving the car was the<br/>

she can drive fine on a dirt country road, although probably not in<br/>
traffic. But she is *driving*.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain found a set of Bob books when she was 3 and we were hanging out at<br/>
an air conditioned  Borders during a really hot Phoenix heat spell, I<br/>
think it was the year we hit 122. She was three, and just absolutely<br/>
charmed by them, and I spent money I really didn&#39;t have to buy the set. <br/>
They were the perfect size for her little hands, and she dragged them<br/>
around for a long while, reading them over and over. This was the same<br/>
time period when I was reading various  translations of The Odyssey to<br/>
her, her Greek Myth Obsession years. <br/>
<br/>
(Now she&#39;s reading a book called Troy, loosely based on The Iliad. Anyone<br/>
read it? She just looked up and said, &quot;There&#39;s quite a bit of screwing in<br/>
this book Lindsay lent me.&quot; Hmmmm.).<br/>
<br/>
Do I think she read longer books sooner because of those Bob books? No,<br/>
probably not, but that wasn&#39;t the point. She enjoyed reading them then,<br/>
and it&#39;s not for me to decide what she reads, now or then (I probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have chosen a book with &quot;quite a bit of screwing&quot;). Later she<br/>
dragged around &quot;In a Dark, Dark Room and Other Scary Stories&quot;, which I<br/>
believe was a Step 1 Reader, and a book called Greek Myths.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t inflict my values on what she reads, or what she watches on TV,<br/>
or whatever. Just because I think a book is a &quot;waste of a tree&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1793511131">After having taught ESL to Mexican children on the border of Texas, I would<br/>
like to point out that reading ( as S.Dodd said, sounding out Bob) IS<br/>
reading. However, the true test comes with comprehension, IMHO. For example,<br/>
I can read the word  &#39;quiero&#39; as &#39;qwero&#39;. Did I READ it? SURE! Does anyone<br/>
have a CLUE as to what I am saying? NO! They just politely smile at the<br/>
gringo. If I were comprehending the word ( as in had previously heard it<br/>
spoken and knew what it meant when pronounced correctly but had never seen<br/>
it written) then I would have recognized the word IN CONTEXT and known its<br/>
meaning. Just because one can READ a word, isn&#39;t saying much, again IMHO.<br/>

Me too, this week in a Tom Clancy book, and I mentioned it to the kids (in <br/>
the process of getting them to bring me a dictionary where I was laid up on <br/>
the couch).<br/>
<br/>
Holly is learning to play fiddle, but she can only play one song.  And she <br/>
says &quot;I&#39;m learning.  I know one song and parts of some more.&quot;<br/>

At what exact point in the reading continuum do we cross the line between <br/>
just sounding out and nothing to be excited about and &quot;really reading&quot; where <br/>
it&#39;s okay to get excited?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, I guess, it wouldn&#39;t be particularly exciting if it&#39;s gradual.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the points about it being reading even if it&#39;s Cat in the Hat or <br/>
Bob.  I mentioned this discussion to the kids last night and Marty and Holly <br/>
used the example of The Bug, the Boy and the Bear books as things which are <br/>
without plot or purpose, except the art&#39;s kind of cute and they&#39;re easy.  <br/>
<br/>
In the absence of &quot;first grade reading&quot; and &quot;second grade reading&quot; and such, <br/>
where kids get good grades for doing phonics sheets and reciting chapters 27 <br/>
kids read before them, reading is real-world reading, rather than school <br/>
reading.<br/>
<br/>
Holly read me all her Harry Potter cards the other day, while I was stuck on <br/>
the couch.  She missed some words, but she was fluent and reading phrases, <br/>
not just individual words.<br/>
<br/>
I can sound out Spanish or French, reading along on the page word by word.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know what I read.  Can I read Spanish?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not so simple, and I&#39;m unwilling to go by school definitions of reading.<br/>
 &quot;starting to read&quot; it would be more comforting for those who are worried <br/>
because a child can&#39;t read.<br/>
<br/>
If we use everyday materials instead of graded readers and reading-level <br/>
books, then the definition of reading might be on a higher level because of <br/>
that.<br/>

could &quot;only&quot; read Dr. Suess on a Monday. The next day she was <br/>
reading &quot;sixth grade level&quot; books. If grade levels of books are to <br/>
be ignored, why should there be a level of book that says &quot;my child <br/>
is reading?&quot; In my opinion everyone should read what they want to <br/>
read, no matter what level experts label a book, and anyone, not <br/>
just a child, &quot;reading&quot; Bob is reading. All children are unique and <br/>
we want them to hold onto those unique qualities. Some don&#39;t want to <br/>
read the &quot;childish&quot; books while others do. Isn&#39;t that what <br/>
unschooling is all about?  Letting a child make the choices? To me <br/>
it&#39;s all rather comical. Unschoolers want to keep their children <br/>
away from the almighty preset learning routine of the school system. <br/>
So what do we do? We knit pick about grade levels and what is <br/>
reading and what is not reading. To me, unschooling was and is the <br/>
joy of seeing my daughter happy. I don&#39;t care if she was only <br/>
reading the word Fritos on a bag of chips. She was reading as far as <br/>
she was concerned. So, why shouldn&#39;t I back up her beliefs? What <br/>
does it matter if others think she&#39;s not really reading? As far as I <br/>
know, there is no one authority that determines what is and what is <br/>
not reading. All just my opinion of course.<br/>
