<div id="ygrps-yiv-320136353">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re currently homecshooling our 11 year old daughter after having <br/>
her attend a Waldorf school for four years. <br/>
<br/>
We all love the rythym of our days together since homschooling. What <br/>
a wonderful way to really get to know one another. <br/>
<br/>
Admittedly, I began with much more of a schedule and, as my <br/>
confidence has grown, I&#39;ve abandoned much of our scheduled mornings. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my dilema I&#39;d love some feedback on:<br/>
<br/>
While we hope to continue down this unschooling road, there&#39;s a <br/>
possbility that our daugther may have to go to public school in the <br/>
next year or so due to finances (I would go back to work.). We hope <br/>
that&#39;s not the case but it&#39;s always in the back of my mind as my <br/>
daughter and I sit or hours knitting or reading or just hanging <br/>
out.  I feel compelled to do some 5th grade math, keep up with some <br/>
history, etc. <br/>
<br/>
I know there are alternatives to us sending our daughter to school <br/>
but I would like to hear from others who may have had to make that <br/>
decision at some point and how you worked it out?<br/>
<br/>
How do others balance this if public school looms in the background?<br/>
Our daughter has expressed some angst over the possibility of <br/>
being &quot;way behind&quot; should she go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would be very appreciated.<br/>
Dorothy</div>

&quot;feeling compelled&quot; is a problem.<br/>

Feeling powerless is a problem.<br/>

Reading these might help.  They&#39;re not long:<br/>

LOOMS?<br/>
Your life sounds pretty scary from just that post.  Looming things  <br/>
are compelling you to have to do things.<br/>
