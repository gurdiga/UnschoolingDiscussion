<div id="ygrps-yiv-585067340">Hello.  My name is Laura and I have been reading these posts for a while now.<br/>
I have just recently started unschooling my two girls. <br/>
<br/>
We are in need of some friends to do &quot;field trips&quot; and just general fun &quot;hanging out&quot; kind of stuff.  Not to say that the list isn&#39;t fun to read.... but it isn&#39;t the same as meeting in person.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the Daytona Beach, FL area.  If there is anyone out there... we&#39;d be pleased to meet you.<br/>
<br/>
                             Thanks a million.   Laura</div>

I can check if you&#39;d like.<br/>

Hi Laura, haven&#39;t chatted with you for awhile. Boy do I wish we could go on a <br/>
field trip with you because that means we&#39;d be in Fla.&lt;BWG:)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-247440634">Hello Laura,<br/>
<br/>
    I&#39;ve noticed that you have been looking to come to FL lately.  You&#39;d be <br/>
more than welcome to spend some time hanging out w/ us.<br/>
    I just wish we could find unschoolers around here to get together with on <br/>
a regular basis.  I have a lot of hmschl &quot;friends&quot;, but they are not <br/>
flexible.  It takes a major ordeal to get together.  Most of the time they <br/>
don&#39;t even answer there phone.  And when I leave a message,  it takes about a <br/>
week for a return call.   It&#39;s very frustrating.<br/>
    Well, if any of you comes across someone near Daytona... tell them about <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
                                            Love,  Laura</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-336306818">That would be great... I haven&#39;t come across that list yet.   Maybe I&#39;ll <br/>
check it out myself too.   Thanks again Lynda.    (I guess all you have to do <br/>
is ask.... thanks for all the help)<br/>
