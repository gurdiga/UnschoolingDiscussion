<div id="ygrps-yiv-721949416">We just got into the IDEA program.  I don&#39;t know if anyone here is <br/>
familiar with it, but I&#39;ll give a quick rundown.  It is a program <br/>
offered to military families stationed in the Pacific who choose to <br/>
homeschool.  Once in the program your child&#39;s records are kept in <br/>
Alaska.  You are given $1200 per child per year to help with <br/>
curriculum costs or activities that apply to your homeschooling.  <br/>
You are also given a computer to use during your time in the <br/>
program.  You are given a teacher contact...for questions and such.  <br/>
You have to send in 2 progress reports each year as well as an <br/>
Individual Learning plan for the year.  Now, I know that I can still <br/>
unschool and be able to use the support of this program as it would <br/>
be extremely helpful financially.  The only thing that worries me a <br/>
little is that the kids must test at the end of the year (3rd and <br/>
up) which is provided by the IDEA program.  I worry that if my son <br/>
doesn&#39;t show enough progress ...well..worse case is that they drop <br/>
us.  &quot;Test&quot; always worries me, but all in all what does that do to <br/>
us?  If his test scores are really low and in his records does it <br/>
affect us adversely in any way?  Especially if we are planning to <br/>
never go back to a school?  I need suggestions on putting together <br/>
this ILP under my unschooling regime :)  I also have to send in <br/>
samples of their work quarterly which is really no big deal as long <br/>
as I keep some things they work on.  They don&#39;t require any specific <br/>
curriculum. We are happy to have gotten into the program even though <br/>
I put us on the list prior to the decision to unschool.  My husband <br/>
now reminds me that I will be &quot;accountable&quot; for their <br/>
education...arrghhh!!!   Any suggestions out there?  Thanks a bunch <br/>
in advance!  <br/>

<br/>
Are the tests self-administered?<br/>
<br/>
If so, here&#39;s my advice,<br/>
canned, pre-written, also available at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://SandraDodd.com/tests">http://SandraDodd.com/tests</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
IF YOU CANNOT AVOID STANDARDIZED TESTS...<br/>
...then just invalidate the results. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a short piece from the February 2000 issue of <br/>
Home Education Magazine&#39;s online newsletter . They unfairly called this <br/>
&quot;Sandra Dodd Cheats on Tests.&quot; I never did! I&#39;m simply and subversively <br/>
recommending that in the absence of the opportunity to avoid them altogether, <br/>
the second best option might be invalidating them. (The paragraph beneath <br/>
appeared in the newsletter too; I&#39;ve added links but not text to it.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the topic of testing: I have a very serious suggestion which will seem <br/>
like a joke, but I&#39;m absolutely soberly recommending this:  <br/>
<br/>
Cheat. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t cheat to get a better score or a worse score. Just invalidate the test <br/>
either by taking too long, or making a pattern with all the answer marks in <br/>
odd-numbered sections, or using dice to decide anything for which the answer <br/>
isn&#39;t absolutely obvious to the child. <br/>
<br/>
If the parent and child both know in advance that the scores could not <br/>
POSSIBLY actually begin to attempt to reflect the child&#39;s &quot;actual&quot; knowledge <br/>
or intelligence or aptitude or value, then that number will lose its juju and <br/>
its ability to harm the child-parent relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the things I believe strongly, one which has changed my life as <br/>
profoundly as any one other belief is my personal knowledge that test scores <br/>
can and do (can&#39;t fail to) affect the treatment a child receives at his <br/>
parents&#39; hands. High scores, low scores, average scores--no matter. Parents <br/>
cease to treat the child as his original, known self and color him soul deep <br/>
with that number. <br/>
<br/>
My life would have been different. My husband&#39;s life would have been <br/>
different, without those 5th and 8th grade ITBS scores. I venture to say <br/>
without even knowing who is reading this that your life would have been <br/>
different, and specifically I believe your life would have been better, had <br/>
not you been branded with a number on your &quot;permanent record&quot; (there&#39;s a big <br/>
mean scary joke, the &quot;permanence&quot; and important parts) as a young innocent <br/>
ten or thirteen year old full of potential, at some unknown point on a <br/>
learning curve which might soon be at its settled-out point, or might just be <br/>
beginning. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-530172389">Can you decide which grade level your child is in?  Can you put a 9 <br/>
year old in first grade?  <br/>
<br/>
I tried out a cyber-charter school for my kids.  It was tempting--<br/>
&quot;free&quot; computer, &quot;free&quot; art lessons, music lessons, and phys ed costs <br/>
(paying for soccer, basketball fees).  I was told when we signed up <br/>
we could take only foreign languages and electives.  Then they kept <br/>
adding more and more restrictions.  They said, well now you have to <br/>
take all &quot;core&quot; subjects, but you can go at your own pace, take 2 <br/>
months to finish one assignment if you want, and you can pick and <br/>
choose which activities you like.  And of course it got to the point <br/>
where you had to do all lessons assigned by the end of the year.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been skeptical of &quot;free&quot; government programs.  But I <br/>
asked these specific questions before I got involved, and figured a <br/>
public cyber charter school wouldn&#39;t lie.  Ha!  <br/>
Now I know more than ever that NOTHING is free.  I would be very, <br/>
very careful, because public money always comes with strings.  <br/>
