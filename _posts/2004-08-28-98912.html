<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776183279">I go out of town and come back to find unschooling boards down!  I&#39;m<br/>
so glad to find many of you here.  For those of you that don&#39;t know<br/>
me, I&#39;m an unschooling mother of three, ages 3, 9, & 10.  My life<br/>
changed when I found unschooling.  I have never been happier or lived<br/>
more joyfully with my family.  <br/>

at the conference! LOL.  I hope you all had a great weekend, I can&#39;t<br/>
wait to hear about it.  I hope we can make it next year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1519506152">Hi Karen,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also missing hearing from the gang on the message boards, and <br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying a fall weekend in the Yukon instead of the <br/>
conference. Nice to hear that I&#39;m not the only one not there. Sigh..<br/>
