&lt;&lt;  But, also just like you said of yourself, I dont <br/>
 throw tantrums like my children.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve thrown several in a very short time, right here on the list.<br/>
I&#39;ve never read a post where you were singled out. Ideas get questioned here <br/>
equally.<br/>
And yet, anything Sandra says, you seem to take personally. <br/>
 I got the exact same line of questioning over my beliefs and ideas that you <br/>
have, but I don&#39;t remember ever feeling &quot;singled out&quot; or acting so incredibly <br/>
rude to anyone that questioned my ideas on limits.<br/>
I really think there is some negative energy inside that is not allowing <br/>
growth or acceptance or at least the ability to not feel attacked.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think this list is a good fit for you......but maybe I&#39;m wrong.<br/>
What do you get from being here?<br/>
Is there any learning or advice that doesn&#39;t make you angry?<br/>
Or is this just negative energy for you. Because if it was just all negative, <br/>
I&#39;d find somewhere I felt a positive flow for me.<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
