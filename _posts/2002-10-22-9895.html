Do you have park meetings etc in Blackpool (I think I went to Butlins<br/>
there once when I was 13 LOL)....  What is the support like in England<br/>
for homeschooling/unschooling?  I would love to hear more about this so<br/>
if it&#39;s not appropriate to share with this list please e-mail me at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:dawn@...">dawn@...</a> .... Hubby and I have talked about moving back<br/>
to England (don&#39;t know if I could do it though) and it would be great to<br/>
know about the climate of homeschooling. (I already know the climate of<br/>
England would suit me better than the horrible over 100 degree heat of<br/>
Arizona)...<br/>
<br/>
My best friend in England (known since we were 11) has never even heard<br/>
of homeschooling in England.  She lives in the Cambridge area and has a<br/>
3 year old.  I don&#39;t think she&#39;d do it anyway but still it would be nice<br/>
to hear about that there is support over there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really??? The evening news was just on and there are nasty gale force<br/>
warnings all over (the whole map looked dark:) I love living in the British<br/>
expat community, eating Brit food, watching Brit TV -- but basking under<br/>
warm blue skies! Actually I whine about the heat but right now winter is<br/>
lovely and flowers are being planted all over the city so it will be lovely<br/>
soon.<br/>

homeschooling even though reportedly there are loads of us there. But when<br/>
we started on this path 10-12 years ago, many people in the US didn&#39;t have<br/>
a clue either. I think it&#39;s really only been the last 5 years or so that hs<br/>
has become so mainstream.<br/>

I have some links to English homeschooling sites, and they have an e-mail <br/>
list I was on while I was in East Yorkshire visiting a couple of years ago.<br/>
