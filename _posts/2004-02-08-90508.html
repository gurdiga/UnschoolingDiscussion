I have a question.  Hope its not a repeat.  I&#39;ve been reading the articles on <br/>
your site.  And I know that you started out as a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
When you had your children.  Did you start out as an unschooler?  Or did you <br/>
work your way toward that?  Do you have an article that explains how you went <br/>
from being a teacher to unschooling?<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not all collected in one place.  Maybe I should do that.<br/>
<br/>
As with all hindsight and connect-the-dots, sometimes I think of something <br/>
else that contributed to making it easier for me to unschool with complete <br/>
confidence.  Sometimes it&#39;s a small thing and sometimes a big one.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to be a teacher from the time I was six, but looking back I see that <br/>
what I really wanted was to be like teachers I knew and liked.  They had <br/>
read, they laughed, they talked about interesting things, they had travelled, they <br/>
were nice to kids.  (I saw exceptions, and those are the teachers I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to be like.  Since I had decided I was going to be one, I noticed all the <br/>
good things because that was what I wanted to emulate.)<br/>
<br/>
When I went to college I studied English and psychology.  I was young.  <br/>
17-20.  I got interested in anthropology too, and folklore.   I took education <br/>
classes kind of on the side (we were required to have a major and minor and THEN <br/>
take the education classes in addition).  It was the early 70&#39;s and the <br/>
professors I had were mostly school-reform advocates, and they talked about all the <br/>
latest studies that showed how the schools themselves caused most of the <br/>
problems and how these things were being overcome in experimental schools.  They had <br/>
us read John Holt, who was not yet a homeschooling advocate, but was pretty <br/>
radical!<br/>
<br/>
I taught where I had gone to school.  Some of the people I taught with had <br/>
been my teachers.  They liked me and had faith in me and let me be experimental. <br/>
 Still, it was school.  <br/>
<br/>
Things were being difficult in my life outside of school, my mom had become a <br/>
fulltime drunk (at the bar from 11:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m), my dad remarried <br/>
twice and then died, my mom had a little boy (my half brother) she wasn&#39;t taking <br/>
good care of and I had custody of him, I married a friend whose parents had <br/>
died and we had custody of his younger brother and sister, so when I was 21 I <br/>
had custody of a 10 and 12 year old and soon added a four year old brother.   A <br/>
lot; all had side issues, we did the best we could, and learned a lot and <br/>
things were rough.<br/>
<br/>
Time passed, and not smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
I moved to Albuquerque to go to grad school and be with Keith, who had lived <br/>
with me and my first husband for a while.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 31 I was in a whole &#39;nother situation.  Second round of custody of <br/>
my brother who was a young teen then (not doing well, fetal alcohol syndrome <br/>
featuring lack of conscience, plus poor guy had been with my mom most of that <br/>
ensuing time, and I saw more of what not to do; heended up in a juvenile <br/>
detention situation,and then I arranged for my mom to regain custody for a while, <br/>
learning too much law in the process) .<br/>
I had quit teaching when I moved to Albuquerque and for a while I worked in <br/>
the records office at the university, and then I worked fulltime as the CEO <br/>
(working from my home and travelling to board meetings) of the Society for <br/>
Creative Anachronism for a couple of years.  So I learned a lot about non-profits <br/>
and bulk mailings and printing and management and organization and management, <br/>
but also lots about the philosophy of how people can learn in the course of <br/>
&quot;just&quot; trying to put on medieval feasts and tournaments. Some people there said <br/>
we should, as a non-profit educational organization, be doing community <br/>
outreach and teaching the general public about the Middle Ages.  I argued that our <br/>
existence gave them the opportunity to come and learn if they wanted to, and we <br/>
weren&#39;t chartered as missionaries, but as studying in order to put on feasts <br/>
and tournaments by and for our own membership.<br/>
<br/>
Those discussions clarified a lot for me about natural learning.  Being <br/>
around people in that organization who were going from zero to professional outside <br/>
of school, without certificates, learning it all for fun and many ending up <br/>
with real expertise, producing amazing things, put me past ANY doubt that <br/>
learning can be just about effortless when it&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I got married in 1984 (20th anniversary coming, but we were <br/>
together six years before we married).<br/>
<br/>
   I was going to Adult Children of Alcoholics meetings, had Kirby, went to <br/>
La Leche League, and the messages of those two organizations melded to change <br/>
me.  I didn&#39;t need to be my mom; further, I needed in many ways profoundly NOT <br/>
to be my mom.<br/>
<br/>
We figured Kirby would go to school when the time came.<br/>
<br/>
Our family was one of several families in a playgroup and babysitting co-op <br/>
made up mostly of La Leche League leaders and hardcore members, invitation <br/>
only, strictly attachment parenting.   Of the dozen to 18 families, four were <br/>
homeschoolers. Two structured, two unschooling.  I knew their homes, the dads, the <br/>
kids.  Kids had been at my house without parents.  My kids had been to their <br/>
houses.   That&#39;s about as close as it gets to intimate knowledge of how the <br/>
kids are with and without their parents around.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Kirby was four, we knew school wasn&#39;t going to be a good match <br/>
for him. He was zippy yet sensitive.  He was brave, and yet clingy.   He&#39;d go <br/>
quiet and thoughtful, and then way talkative.  We decided to keep him home the <br/>
kindergarten year with the option the next year of public kindergarten, public <br/>
first grade, or continued homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d seen firsthand the problems in the school-at-home families and also seen <br/>
the calm and the happiness in the unschooling families, so I went that way.  <br/>
All the experiences in my life to that point made me confident.<br/>
<br/>
I still figured Marty might want to go to school, but when the time came he <br/>
didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it!  I went directly to unschooling, but in a way it was like <br/>
being still and letting the waters rise around me, rather than jumping off a <br/>
cliff from school into an unknown.  I worked up to it over the years, without <br/>
knowing what I was working up to.<br/>
<br/>
Much of life is like that, isn&#39;t it?  That&#39;s why unschooling works as well as <br/>
it does.  If our kids live their rich lives, it works up to something, but we <br/>
don&#39;t know what until it happens.  And if we attach to a moment or a goal, <br/>
we&#39;ll feel like failures when that passes on by.  If my only success would have <br/>
been taking care of my mom or my brother, or my first marriage, or teaching, I <br/>
would be a many-times failure.  But if my success was to keep on learning and <br/>
being a good and happy Sandra, then I was successful throughout and still am. <br/>
 I don&#39;t know what I&#39;ll be doing in five years, but if I keep focussed on <br/>
now, it should be something based naturally on what has gone before.<br/>

<br/>
I have worked as the CFO of two companies and as a quasi real estate <br/>
agent, all without going to college and without having any formal <br/>
education in either area.  It was simply something that I learned by <br/>
watching others and asking questions.  I have always loved math and <br/>
numbers so the CFO position was a no brainer as far as I was <br/>
concerned.  However, as most of you know, I couldn&#39;t just walk in <br/>
and get a CFO position with no degree or formal education.  So, I <br/>
started at the bottom and worked my way up, both times.  Once the <br/>
bosses saw that I really did know what I was talking about and <br/>
doing, that was all it took.  Of course, to cover their own butts, <br/>
an &quot;real&quot; accountant came in and checked my work once a month.  He <br/>
always told the boss that she was wasting her money having him come <br/>
in.<br/>
<br/>
The real estate agent thing was sort of an accident.  I needed a <br/>
part time job to help with money and met someone (an agent) who was <br/>
looking for an office assistant.  After working with him a week, he <br/>
had me talking to the clients and helping to arrange financing for <br/>
them (another numbers job for me).  I loved working with him and, <br/>
before I knew it (or him, for that matter), I was taking offers and <br/>
making counter offers on our listings.  The title companies that I <br/>
worked with just assumed that I was an agent from out of the area.  <br/>
I loved that job but ended up leaving because it was taking WAY too <br/>
much time away from my DD and DH.  I still have friends who call and <br/>
ask me to look over contracts before they make an offer on homes. <br/>
These are people who have their own agents!  They know that I really <br/>
do have their best interests at heart.  As a matter of fact, I just <br/>
suggested to a friend of mine the other day not to make an offer on <br/>
a house she had her heart set on.....there was just too much work to <br/>
be done and I knew she&#39;d never have the time to do it.  Once I <br/>
pointed the different things out to her, she said that I was right <br/>
and, no big surprise here, her agent didn&#39;t point any of these <br/>
things our to her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I went directly to unschooling, but in a way it was like <br/>
being still and letting the waters rise around me, rather than <br/>
jumping off a cliff from school into an unknown.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it might be a little easier for someone who starts out not <br/>
putting their kids in school at all.  I knew that I would be <br/>
homeschooling my DD before she was born.  However, I had no idea <br/>
that there were so many different kinds of ways to homeschool.  I <br/>
started to read about homeschooling and, as soon as I read about <br/>
unschooling, something in my brain yelled &quot;Yes, that&#39;s it!&quot;  I never <br/>
looked any further.  Then I went to Yahoo Groups and found this <br/>
group.  I knew that I wanted to unschool as far as education but, <br/>
you all have helped me to unschool in all other aspects of life.  I <br/>
still have my moments but I feel as though I have made great <br/>
progress.<br/>

<br/>
Bingo!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so envious of those of you who get/got it early!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s maybe right about parents who have the &quot;basics&quot; down from a year or <br/>
two of schooling---like the arithmatic and reading----&#39;cause those are two <br/>
bugaboos. At least they don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s gnawing at them: &quot;Will they ever <br/>
learn to ....?&quot;  When they leave school, those two little things are &quot;done&quot; <br/>
(well...not exactly, but in their minds).<br/>
<br/>
But at the same time, the damage has been done too. <br/>
<br/>
I have one of each. Cameron had eight years of schooling. Duncan has had <br/>
none. So I&#39;ve been able to see both sides. I got to watch the spark go out in Cam <br/>
at school---but it was  miraculous to see it come back and then burst into <br/>
flames! Duncan just keeps going. Never has been snuffed out. Both are fascinating <br/>
to watch from a &quot;sociological/psychological/educational&quot; viewpoint, not to <br/>
mention as a parent and unschooling advocate. <br/>
<br/>
I can easily see the &quot;swimming/floating&quot; into schooling as Sandra did----I&#39;m <br/>
doing it with Duncan. It&#39;s SO easy! The water (and my fat ass) hold me afloat. <br/>
But I totally understand the cliff-jumping too! It&#39;s more frightening---but <br/>
maybe more exciting and rewarding---to realize you have wings and can fly.<br/>
<br/>
Correction: it&#39;s DUNCAN who&#39;s doing the swimming/floating and CAMERON who&#39;s <br/>
doing the flying/soaring. Both are amazing! And both are unschooling, but with <br/>
different starting points.<br/>

damage to work through. I wish I had always hs&#39;d. I had never heard of hsing <br/>
and it never occurred to me though I did try hard to help/save my kids as best <br/>
I could think of while they were there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277036954">Wow Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing all of that.  I&#39;ve had bits and pieces of &quot;ahah&quot; experiences that have made me realize that learning happens best when in freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I guess for me it is still like jumping off of a cliff.  The waters just didn&#39;t have enough time to rise high enough to engulf me.<br/>
<br/>
That gives me a lot to think about.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153513617">I can easily see the &quot;swimming/floating&quot; into schooling as Sandra did----I&#39;m <br/>
doing it with Duncan. It&#39;s SO easy! The water (and my fat ass) hold me afloat. <br/>
But I totally understand the cliff-jumping too! It&#39;s more frightening---but <br/>
maybe more exciting and rewarding---to realize you have wings and can fly.<br/>
<br/>

I know exactly what you mean.  My oldest two were in school.  The oldest till 5th grade, the youngest only till half way through 1st.   But the &quot;baby&quot; of the family never went to school and she is SOOOOO easy to unschool.  In fact, it was her success that gave me more confidence to unschool the other two.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sandra&#39;s maybe right about parents who have the &quot;basics&quot; down from a year <br/>
or <br/>
two of schooling---like the arithmatic and reading---- &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it will happen in a year or two.  I was thinking more of people <br/>
whose kids are 12 or 15 and they want to unschool.  If they say &quot;My kid reads <br/>
all the time,&quot; I say &quot;Well then it will be a breeze.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We know one kid who left school in third grade and he was already good at <br/>
math and reading, so it&#39;s not TOTALLY uncommon.  But the pictures in my head when <br/>
I wrote were of tall people, not 7 yr olds (just for the record).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our situation was similar my youngest did finish first grade, I pulled the <br/>
older one at the end of 4th. They are both very unschooly now but the younger <br/>
one is, at least to me like someone who has never been to school.<br/>
<br/>
 It has been interesting watching my older boys who all attended school <br/>
interact with the younger 2. My 21yro son recently told me he wishes he had been <br/>
hs&#39;d. It has been very healing for all of us (the older boys, dh and I) to be <br/>
able to talk out a lot of the grief of their school years. I am glad for where <br/>
we are today.<br/>

Some kids go and still don&#39;t learn these things, they end up having even more <br/>

best <br/>
I could think of while they were there. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

Seriously, I *do* so wish I had found unschooling before Cameron went to <br/>
school. Sandra&#39;s path is wait until they find us. I&#39;m out LOOKING for converts! <br/>
&lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I know that I can&#39;t &quot;convert&quot; those that don&#39;t want to be unschooled (nor do <br/>
I wish to), but I CAN make an effort to be a beacon to those who are <br/>
searching. My car is a rolling advertisement for unschooling. I wear it on my sleeve. <br/>
I&#39;m MORE than happy to &quot;preach&quot; it when someone&#39;s interested. I DO say, &quot;we&#39;re <br/>
UNschooling,&quot; when people ask which school the boys are in. Then I&#39;ll tell <br/>
them EXACTLY what we do and how.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that people don&#39;t know (and many don&#39;t care); but if someone, <br/>
anyone, had mentioned unschooling to me when Cameron was a baby, I would have <br/>
latched on immediately. Instead we floundered in the private school system for <br/>
eight years. I thought you *had* to be a  right-wing, religious, Abeka/Sonlight <br/>
kind of homeschooler. I didn&#39;t realize THIS life was possible!<br/>
<br/>
So my mission is the same, but different. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
But I figure once someone DOES find us, they should do it and not waste any <br/>
time waffling and stalling and trying one more time to teach them world history <br/>
in chronological order.  Once they&#39;ve found us and asked for help getting <br/>
there, I want them to focus for a minute or a day or a week and DO IT!<br/>
<br/>
It probably seems like plain impatience on my part, but it isn&#39;t.  The sooner <br/>
it works, the better it works.  The sooner it works, the less deschooling <br/>
there will be.  The sooner it works, the sooner we have someone else to help us <br/>
say &quot;Oh look!! IT WORKS!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That is so funny!<br/>
<br/>
Last night I drove Marty to the ice rink to leave his new skates to be <br/>
sharpened.  We were listening to the radio, and trying to find something by the drum <br/>
part.  The first one had tambourine but I accidently said &quot;tangerine&quot; and we <br/>
were just laughing, and came to one that had heavy high-hat cymbals, and two <br/>
songs later, same pedal-cymbal background.  I was thinking (but didn&#39;t say <br/>
anything) about how hard drum-set stuff is (for rock or jazz) and how totally <br/>
beyond me it is, musically and spatially and mathematically.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;After six years (wow, I can&#39;t believe it has been that long)I am constantly<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
level.  LOL&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Music is math on more levels than that.  Notation is totally a graphic <br/>
representation of the music, showing the &quot;base&quot; (as in base ten, base twelve, base <br/>
two in math, but in music it&#39;s more likely to be base four, or three or six), <br/>
and the relative lengths of parts, the relative heights and series&#39; and...   <br/>
But PHYSICALLY it&#39;s mathematical.  Half a string makes a note twice as high.  <br/>
[Twice as high?  Kind of.  But all those can be measured in vibrations per <br/>
second, and the notes have physical relationships to one another.]<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more, but I don&#39;t know it all.<br/>
