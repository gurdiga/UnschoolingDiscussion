yes...<br/>
good for you taking unplugging the tv.  you must have been to that point when <br/>
you decide to step in, force some action, make a change.  it will probably <br/>
motivate both you and he to have to look for new solutions, and recognize <br/>
that you arent happy with the way things are going.  we all have to step back <br/>
and re-assess once in awhile.  find whats really bothering us and why and <br/>
discuss w/those involved.  best wishes and keep us posted on how it goes!<br/>
