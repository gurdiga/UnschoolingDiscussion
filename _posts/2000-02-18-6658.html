<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; &gt;From a San Diego Father who has identified 35 truths he learned from<br/>
&gt; his children:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; 1. There is no such thing as childproofing your house.<br/>
&gt; 2. If you spray hair spray on dust bunnies and run over them with<br/>
&gt;   roller blades, they can ignite.<br/>
&gt; 3. A 4-year-old&#39;s voice is louder than 200 adults in a crowded<br/>
&gt;   restaurant.<br/>
&gt; 4. If you hook a dog leash over a ceiling fan,the motor is not strong<br/>
&gt;    enough to rotate a 42-pound boy wearing pound puppy underwear and a<br/>
&gt;    Superman cape.<br/>
&gt; 5. It is strong enough, however, to spread paint on all four walls of<br/>
&gt;     a 20&#39;x20&#39; room.<br/>
&gt; 6. Baseballs make marks on ceilings.<br/>
&gt; 7. When using the ceiling fan as a bat, you have to throw the ball up<br/>
&gt;     several times before you get a hit.<br/>
&gt; 8. You should not throw baseballs up when the ceiling fan is on.<br/>
&gt; 9. A ceiling fan can hit a baseball a long ways.<br/>
&gt; 10. The glass in windows (even double pane) doesn&#39;t stop a baseball hit by<br/>
&gt;        a ceiling fan.<br/>
&gt; 11. When you hear the toilet flush and the words &quot;uh-oh&quot;, it is already too<br/>
&gt; late.<br/>
&gt; 12. Brake fluid mixed with Clorox makes smoke----------lots of it.<br/>
&gt; 13. A 6 year-old boy can start a fire with a flint rock even though a<br/>
&gt;      60-year old man says it can only be done in the movies.<br/>
&gt; 14. A magnifying glass can start a fire even on an overcast day.<br/>
&gt; 15. If you use a waterbed as a home plate while wearing baseball<br/>
&gt;      shoes, it does not leak. It explodes.<br/>
&gt; 16. A king-size waterbed holds enough water to fill a 2,000 sq. ft<br/>
&gt;       house almost 4 inches deep.<br/>
&gt; 17. Legos will pass through the digestive tract of a 4-year-old.<br/>
&gt; 18. Duplos will not.<br/>
&gt; 19. Play-Doh and microwave ovens should never be used in the same sentence.<br/>
&gt; 20. Super Glue is forever.<br/>
&gt; 21. MacGyver can teach us many things we don&#39;t want to know.<br/>
&gt; 22. So can Tarzan.<br/>
&gt; 23. No matter how much Jell-O you put in the pool, you still can&#39;t walk on<br/>
&gt; water.<br/>
&gt; 24. Pool filters do not like Jell-O.<br/>
&gt; 25. VCRs do not eject PB&J sandwiches, even though TV commercials show they<br/>
&gt; do.<br/>
&gt; 26. Garbage bags do not make good parachutes.<br/>
&gt; 27. Marbles in gas tanks make lots of noise when driving.<br/>
&gt; 28. You probably don&#39;t want to know what that odor is.<br/>
&gt; 29. Always look in the oven before you turn it on.<br/>
&gt; 30. Plastic toys do not like ovens.<br/>
&gt; 31. The fire department in San Diego has at least a 5-minute response.<br/>
&gt; 32. The spin cycle on the washing machine does not make earthworms dizzy.<br/>
&gt; 33. It will, however, make cats dizzy.<br/>
&gt; 34. Cats throw up twice their body weight when dizzy.<br/>
&gt; 35. A good sense of humor will get you through most problems in life.<br/>
&gt;       (....unfortunately, mostly in retrospect)<br/>
