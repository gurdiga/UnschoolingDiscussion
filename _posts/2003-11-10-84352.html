<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180181132">&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt;I&#39;d like to separate out, for this discussion, the matter of learning <br/>
from<br/>
the matter of chores. Learning is something that benefits the learner. <br/>
Chores are something that benefit the family.&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought about this half a dozen times last night and this morning.    And I <br/>
thought about the people saying &quot;unschooling is...&quot; or &quot;unschoolers don&#39;t...&quot; <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
A big part of me thinks you can separate chores and rules and food from <br/>
unschooling.  I would accept someone saying they were unschooling if they never <br/>
imposed &quot;lessons&quot; and their kids were thriving intellectually.   <br/>
<br/>
The part of me with more practical experience about unschooling and the part <br/>
of me that remembers how many people have said or written &quot;It wasn&#39;t working <br/>
until...&quot; thinks that there is a natural progression toward relaxing parental <br/>
requirements and expectations.<br/>
<br/>
If those who&#39;ve spent years gradually getting unschooling to settle and <br/>
really work say that it worked better after they quit limiting TV and trying to <br/>
control kids&#39; bedtimes and whatever all else, then it seems best to encourage <br/>
newer homeschoolers to move more quickly toward a proven set of advantages.<br/>
<br/>
If we say &quot;Hey, just mosey on this direction, trial and error, eventually <br/>
maybe you&#39;ll get there,&quot; some people will be happier.  Some of the complaints <br/>
this list has had is about people being picky, pushy and strident.  (Mostly ME <br/>
being picky, pushy and strident.)  <br/>
<br/>
But while I&#39;m happy to volunteer my time to help people move quickly out of a <br/>
dangerous building, I&#39;m way less happy to camp out by the door every day and <br/>
say &quot;There&#39;s a way out.  Just keep wandering around.  Maybe you&#39;ll find it.&quot;  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to be as efficient or as pure a use of time as calling into <br/>
the building &quot;Follow the lights on the floor; stay down low; don&#39;t stay in there <br/>
grounding your kids over chores and arguing about video games, Move!  Move!  <br/>
Move!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And the counter argument might be some people don&#39;t WANT to move fast.  The <br/>
building is dangerous in my estimation (and others&#39;) but it&#39;s not in imminent <br/>
danger of collapse.<br/>
<br/>
If the building is the public school system and its evil clone, <br/>
school-at-home, it doesn&#39;t kill ALL its residents.<br/>
<br/>
If the building is unschooling inquiry, where people come to ask for more <br/>
information, and come to see whether they think they can make their children&#39;s <br/>
lives better, then how long do they have?  If a child is fourteen years old, the <br/>
parent only has three years to turn things around.  I think they need to MOVE <br/>
on it, and change something every day.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is four years old, the parent has a long time, but it only takes a <br/>
week or two to press reading lessons to the point that the child is afraid of <br/>
or doesn&#39;t like &quot;reading.&quot;  It might only take half an hour for a child to <br/>
decide math is hard or scary or that he&#39;s just not very smart.<br/>
<br/>
Helping slowly and lightly isn&#39;t always much help.   We might just get <br/>
someone partway understanding, and they kind of try it, and it mostly doesn&#39;t work <br/>
and we say &quot;oh well, you tried.&quot;  But why do that when we can offer some serious<br/>
, real, dynamic and profound ideas?<br/>
<br/>
I woke up a couple of times thinking &quot;Chores aren&#39;t really unschooling, some <br/>
people are going too far in their definition of what&#39;s &#39;real.&#39;&quot;   Then I would <br/>
think that the change of soul and attitude that will really make unschooling <br/>
work at an unconscious level, at a molecular level, has to do with respect for <br/>
the child as a whole person.<br/>
<br/>
So I swirly inside today.<br/>
<br/>
As usual, we don&#39;t need a consensus.  But I thought I would spread the swirl <br/>
around by defending both sides of the argument, and defending those who argue <br/>
them.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with you that &quot;I would accept someone saying they were unschooling if they never imposed &quot;lessons&quot; and their kids were thriving intellectually.&quot;  I haven&#39;t been on this list (or any unschooling list) very long and dont&#39; know any other unschoolers in real life -- so I have a question:  does anyone here actually have unschooling work while controlling other aspects of their children&#39;s lifes?  or know someone who does? It seems to me unlikely coming from where I do philsophically, but I have so little actual data to work with, I don&#39;t think I can really form an opinion.  So I am genuinely curious about whether it does ever work.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I look at it this way:  I would accept someone saying they were &quot;flying&quot; if they just flapped their arms and took off into the air (as opposed to flying an airplane, helicopter etc.).  It would fit the definition of flying -- it just isn&#39;t going to actually happen.  So while it is a theorectically true possibility, it wouldn&#39;t be all that helpful to a list about ways to fly. <br/>

************************************<br/>
And honestly, Sandra, isn&#39;t it easier to help someone who WANTS to move <br/>
quickly, who WANTS to make a drastic change and really listen to people who have <br/>
spent years figuring it out?  Although many people may come here and to other <br/>
unschooling forums wanting help, I would think it&#39;s much harder to explain <br/>
things over and over to someone who wants cling to school at home, grounding, <br/>
rewards and punishments, etc.  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;If a child is fourteen years old, the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>parent only has three years to turn things around.  I think they need to MOVE <br/>
on it, and change something every day.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
***********************************<br/>
This is where I&#39;m at, only in addition to a 15 year old and 5 more children <br/>
younger than that, I have a 17 yo who&#39;s getting ready to go off to college, and <br/>
an almost 20 year old who left before I opened my eyes to non-controlling <br/>
parenting.  I guess I shouldn&#39;t beat myself up too much over her, because the <br/>
last year or so I just quit asking her to get her books done, and she actually <br/>
WAS unschooling herself.  <br/>
<br/>
But on the night I realized she was moving out I laid in bed and bawled and <br/>
bawled...I just felt like there was so much not done yet.  I spent much of her <br/>
life, with me blowing up over something, or charting chores, or spanking, or <br/>
nagging over schoolwork, and telling myself over and over, &quot;It&#39;ll get <br/>
better...&quot;  Suddenly, I was waking up to the fact that time was up, I couldn&#39;t make <br/>
right things I had done wrong...she was leaving.  Forget the wandering aimlessly <br/>
looking for a way out.  It will not be fast enough whatever age a child <br/>
is...human nature is to put off until tomorrow.  Please don&#39;t stop urging people to <br/>
MOVE MOVE MOVE!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy to say my daughter and I have an awesome relationship now.  I just, <br/>
plain, LOVE HER and accept whatever she wants to do with her life.  She <br/>
didn&#39;t go to college (has no desire to), waits tables in town at a Mexican <br/>
restaurant, and lives with a guy she works with, and is HAPPY.  She has learned <br/>
Spanish like I never could have taught her and now speaks it fluently, and is going <br/>
to Mexico for an extended vacation to work with her bosses mother at a resort. <br/>
 What an opportunity!<br/>

That is sobering and sad.  I&#39;m glad your relationship with her now is warm <br/>
and good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

unschooling forums wanting help, I would think it&#39;s much harder to explain <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a total waste of time with some of them.  Some come here in hopes that <br/>
we will, one way or another, support and help solidify their own views.  Either <br/>
they want to think the half-hearted thing they&#39;re kinda thinking of doing is <br/>
unschooling, or they want to &quot;prove&quot; that unschooling parents are just lazy, <br/>
&quot;permissive&quot; parents whose children will be drug addicts on welfare.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes one comes from that corner and DOES &quot;get saved&quot; so it&#39;s worth <br/>
keeping on.<br/>
<br/>

That is so cool.  She got paid to learn Spanish! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
