<div id="ygrps-yiv-247658610">Hi Everyone:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Im back from a hiatus of sending Zak to an alternative school.  He went<br/>
for a few months, and is finishing at the end of this month.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Zak told me the other day that he could do everything at home that he<br/>
was doing at school and not have to get up so early and go to bed to<br/>
early and have to sit still in the same place at school.  Upon asking<br/>
him more about this it seemed to make sense.  Even though this<br/>
alternative school is wonderful (its like an Unschooling school with<br/>
other kids), we are paying $640 a month for this pleasure and hes gone<br/>
for 6 ½ hours.  Im not sure its harmed him to be there in the past few<br/>
months, I guess Ill find out when I bring him home.  I have noticed<br/>
that he and Max fight a lot more (I think because they are not together<br/>
as much as they used to be).  Zak also likes to have alone time in his<br/>
bedroom more, he says its because theres so much noise at school.<br/>
Hes had to learn how to deal with a bully and Im not sure if thats a<br/>
good thing or not.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow hes staying home and we are off to one of our homeschooling<br/>
meetings and Im looking forward to that.  I still think that<br/>
deschooling ME is the hardest part of this.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Glad to be back.<br/>
<br/>

What school was Zak at? I thought about Kino for a while, when Rain<br/>
wanted to go to school...<br/>
