I can see that we have alot in common!  My dd went to a waldorf kindergarden<br/>
in RI.  It was something I was so drawn to because of the beauty and healing<br/>
atmosphere that emanates from them...very clear and holistic.  I went to the<br/>
Waldorf Antioch Teacher Training program in NH and thought that we would<br/>
send dd to a waldorf school. We actually even had a waldor initiative here<br/>
in CT that didn&#39;t quite make it.  We were working on founding a democratic<br/>
school (like Sudbury) when there was a split in the group and some parents<br/>
asked me to help get a waldorf school going...long story.  Anyway we made a<br/>
very long trek to a waldorf school for 2 years to the kindergarden...it was<br/>
wonderful and echoed the philosophy of how we were raising our dd.  We even<br/>
began a silk marrionette puppetry troupe that presented plays at the school<br/>
and for the community as a way to live more deeply with story.  When it came<br/>
time to go to the first grade, dd said pretty adamantly that she wanted to<br/>
homeschool...so we agreed.  We had always had out feet in both<br/>
worlds...homeschooling was something we were involved with in terms of<br/>
groups, friends.  I was even getting HEM before daughter was born at home.<br/>
It was in 1986 and those issues are alot different than what they have<br/>
today!!   So, I did get Oakmeadow...for a few years...we never really used<br/>
much of it...the only thing that we did really use was the introduction of<br/>
letters with stories and a beautiful book that we made.  We are unschoolers<br/>
and a curriculum was always in the way.  I think I bought it because I was<br/>
just always connected to waldorf ideals and found the resource somewhat<br/>
compelling.  Dd is now 12 1/2...we have a 6th grade Oak Meadow<br/>
curriculum...which she picks up occassionally to do some assignment out of.<br/>
It&#39;s always something she decides on her own.  I find her of late wanting<br/>
somehow more a structure in her life in terms of academic pursuits but, I<br/>
think it is just a feeling her ways in this time of beginning adolescense<br/>
and change.  Again, a trying it out kind of thing.  I think the key is<br/>
offering up the oak meadow curriculum as a resource, not a mandatory<br/>
thing...or else it becomes school. Plus, I think Oak Meadow intended you to<br/>
use it as a curriculum to get the most out of it.  I find this all very<br/>
interesting and sometimes unsettling.  I certainly have days of uncertainty<br/>
and think...Maybe a curriculum would have been easier!   That&#39;s the tricky<br/>
thing about all this freedom...it means we as parents have to let go of so<br/>
much to offer it up to our children in an unburdend way.  The Journey<br/>
continues ...<br/>

&gt; Mary Ellen&gt; hang with them there. Does anyone here combine the Oak Meadow<br/>
stuff with an<br/>
&gt; unschooling philosophy? Just curious I know they are very structured their<br/>
&gt; curriculum and teacher directed but I wonder if there is a way to use the<br/>
&gt; stuff they do without spending all the money just to get inspired. I want<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; learn how to play the recorder and also knit and think if I do it myself<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; kids may want to join me which is the Waldorf Kindergarten philosophy and<br/>
&gt; Native American of being a role model but carry it over to other aspects<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; life using story telling and teaching writing through art in a child<br/>
&gt; centered way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741919453">Linda, so many thoughts not enough time to fully respond today but I did<br/>
want to ask if you would ever want to resell any of your old stuff esp. am<br/>
interested in first and second grade! I too checked out the Antioch program<br/>
and had a personality conflict with a woman who runs the Waldorf way she<br/>
actually physically dragged me out of a class I was sitting in on due to her<br/>
agenda that I go to some other activity she had planned and I was in the<br/>
middle of talking to someone etc. I was over 35 at the time and she was<br/>
treating me as if I were an adolescent in a regular  IS Jr. High! I was in<br/>
shock and turned off to anything further but would love to get as much out<br/>
of them as a resource. Oak meadow told me they are having a sale in March<br/>
BTW for anyone interested. I don&#39;t have the money to invest in their yearly<br/>
curriculum but would love to read them or borrow or purchase resale if you<br/>
know of any for sale. Also do you still do the silk puppet troupe thing?<br/>
That must have been a great experience for you . I love to go see these<br/>
shows and watch the effect they have on myself and my children it is so<br/>
mystical and empowering of the imagination. I think we always leave them<br/>
feeling something indescribable in words but definitely a creative spiritual<br/>
and soothing learning experience for the audience at any age.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-24671705">This isn&#39;t the first time someone has mentioned preteen/teen children<br/>
wanting more structure.  Maybe they are ready to put aside the play of a<br/>
young child and begin to seek their life&#39;s work.  (Which hopefully will<br/>
be play of a different sort, if they are allowed to pursue their<br/>
interests!)<br/>
