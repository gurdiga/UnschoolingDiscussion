 </span></blockquote>Makes perfect sense.  Here at our house we don&#39;t do either.  Although we <br/>
don&#39;t really work within the limits of a budget.<br/>
<br/>
The boys help with grocery shopping too.  Adding their favorite items.  If I <br/>
go alone I always ask dh and the boys if they want me to pick up anything for <br/>
them while I am there.  I have never made them eat anything.  They eat what <br/>
they want, when they want and how much they want and I am usually there to help <br/>
them fix something if they need help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370559391">I try to use examples as I know I generally have a hard time understanding <br/>
unless someone adds a real-life example to things. Glad it helped!<br/>
<br/>
As for the limited budget we are in the same boat. I have had to change what <br/>
we buy over the years as the family has grown.  I have always made sure the <br/>
kids have snacks, if I dont we end up at the store again or they say all week <br/>
that their is no food just meals. Mac n cheese, pizzas and so on dont cut it.  <br/>
We need grapes, crackers, apples, fruit snacks or something not so bland.<br/>
<br/>
I have offered all kinds of foods in our house and nothing has been off <br/>
limits. Mostly they choose grapes, apples and fruit snacks. Though hot fries is a <br/>
hit with them all including the 18 month old.<br/>
<br/>
Great to hear this discussion helped you, that&#39;s awesome!<br/>

about a food at some point, but making them try it now to see if they like <br/>
it is not consistent with no limits on food.<br/>

We never force, or more accurately attempt to force, Jayn to eat<br/>
anything, or even to try anything. There is a good chance that there is<br/>
some kind of smell about it that she is picking up on, if her response<br/>
is an instant &quot;no&quot; to any offer. She has said no to foods that I know<br/>
she likes, and then I have tasted it and it was not good - I<br/>
particularly recall some elderly broccoli one time. She also likes a lot<br/>
of variety and won&#39;t eat the same veges every night. I feel that if a<br/>
child is forced to try things (even one bite) against their will, the<br/>
child is being deprived of the ability to trust their own instincts, and<br/>
deprived of the practice in making autonomous decisions. Chances are,<br/>
later on they will try a food and surprise you. Jayn, eg, is very fond<br/>
of asparagus. She is quite a connoisseur of candies now, and definitely<br/>
knows which ones she does not like. She will choose grapes or bananas<br/>
ahead of candies a lot of the time. About two weeks ago, she wanted<br/>
popcorn for the first time ever, and has been snacking on it every two<br/>
days or so since. I don&#39;t like it much myself, so it was a change to<br/>
have to buy micro popcorn when shopping.<br/>

We&#39;ve been the same with Will, and it&#39;s great living with him in the food and <br/>
eating department.  But I just realized we haven&#39;t been un-showering!  I just <br/>
had to make him get up and get in the shower, AGAIN.  His pits are starting <br/>
to stink every day.  He doesn&#39;t care.  I haven&#39;t made him bathe every day of <br/>
his life, really.  But it has been a struggle most of the time, since he got to <br/>
the age he could do it all himself.  Yet, he doesn&#39;t want me in there with him <br/>
anymore, either.  <br/>
<br/>
He keeps is room clean all by himself.  Yesterday he cleaned up the living <br/>
room without being asked.  He was never forced to do chores like his brothers <br/>
were.<br/>
<br/>
I know some day he&#39;s going to want to be clean and look nice.  Until then I <br/>
guess I&#39;m just going to have to put a clothespin on my nose, I guess, and <br/>
insist on a shower for the most important things.  Yuck.<br/>

that I take at least one bite. That almost never happened at my house - <br/>
my mom wouldn&#39;t have allowed it and my dad wasn&#39;t usually that way <br/>
either. But it did at least that one time and I have very very clear <br/>
memories of how it felt. I think my dad was irritated that I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even try them, because he really thought I&#39;d like them if I&#39;d try them <br/>
- they were fresh (that was in the mid-50s and we mostly ate canned <br/>
veggies then so fresh was a treat).<br/>
<br/>
A gentle urge to encourage them to try something is one thing, but <br/>
putting something on their plate and insisting they put it INTO their <br/>
mouth and chew and swallow is ....something else. ICK!!!<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t put food on their plates without asking if they want it and <br/>
how much of it they want.<br/>

alternative when the main program didn&#39;t work out for them.<br/>

[I have memories of gagging on string beans once,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Wow, Pam, we have a very similar experience with fresh<br/>
green beans.  My dad forced me to try a bite of them<br/>
while at a big family dinner at my Grandparent&#39;s<br/>
house.  I literally almost lost my meal at the table. <br/>
They tasted weird to me and their texture was<br/>
creepy... fresh string beans are sort of rough on the<br/>
outside and it seemed like I was chewing a mouthful of<br/>
cat tongues or something.  I was only 8 or so....my<br/>
imagination was  very vivid at that age.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
What ended up happening was locking myself in the<br/>
bathroom because he wanted me to come out and finish<br/>
the rest of them too.  Lucky for me my Grandpa (my<br/>
mom&#39;s dad) really let him have it and had my Grandma<br/>
take them off my plate before I agreed to come out.  I<br/>
still feared punishment when we got home though<br/>
surprisingly it didn&#39;t happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t like fresh string beans.  &gt;:&#39;P<br/>

*********************************<br/>
My beautiful, creative, sweet almost 15-year old son sometimes feels the  <br/>
same way.  He loves having freedom to follow his heart, but his little  Virgo <br/>
self will often say, &quot;Sometimes I wish you&#39;d just tell me what to  do.&quot;  <br/>
 <br/>
Freedom, and being responsible for your own life and desires is HARD  <br/>
sometimes!<br/>
 <br/>
Our solution is that I tell him what to do...AFTER we&#39;ve had conversations  <br/>
about what he wants me to tell him, how, and when. Once we&#39;ve had those  <br/>
conversations, rarely do I need to.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think that it&#39;s important for us to realize that unschooling is much  more <br/>
challenging for kids that being given lists of Must-Do&#39;s every day. You  have <br/>
to become Yourself.<br/>
