<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466786952">Today was supposed to be &quot;errand day&quot;.  As it turned out, we did make it out <br/>
to lunch at Pizza Hut, where I taught the boys how to figure out a 15% tip.  <br/>
There, Math done for the day.  I also made them tell me what food groups were <br/>
part of their pizza and their salads.  I guess that was Health class.  :-)  <br/>
On our way to go grocery shopping, the transmission in my car quit working.  <br/>
We had to push the car to park it (Adam thought it was SO cool that he got to <br/>
sit in the driver&#39;s seat and steer).  A kindly old gentlemen who lived across <br/>
the street from where we broke down came over to help me.  I learned how to <br/>
open the hood, check the fan belt and the oil.  (That was Auto Repair class <br/>
for me)  Then this wonderful elderly man gave my four children and me a ride <br/>
home.  He had hymns playing on his cassette player, and when the children and <br/>
I started singing along, I think we made his day.  He sure made mine!  I <br/>
don&#39;t even know his name, but I know where he lives, and I plan on bringing <br/>
dinner over there as soon as my car gets fixed.  <br/>
<br/>
All in all, it was a blessed day.<br/>
