<div id="ygrps-yiv-1347785649">This is my first post.  I joined over a year ago, then went &quot;no mail&quot; for<br/>
a time- I didn&#39;t get radical unschooling then, and it was annoying me to<br/>
have people talk about unschooling babies (when I had older children), and<br/>
to see their opinions and worries getting slammed...primarily, because of<br/>
the age of their unschooled children.<br/>
<br/>
My children are 7 and 3- I have been *loving* it at Always Unschooled, but<br/>
thought I would try again here now that my eldest is nearing the<br/>
(targetted) aged range at AU.  I think I will enjoy both lists for a few<br/>
more years yet.<br/>
<br/>
Now it seems I&#39;ve arrived back in the middle of an unschooling babies<br/>
discussion...I think it&#39;s fantastic that people commit unschooling so<br/>
early in the peace- I didn&#39;t.  I see now that there are people with tiny<br/>
(or even unborn) children who do, in fact, understand unschooling better<br/>
than I did a year ago, with a school-aged child...so they do belong here<br/>
as much as I do, with a 7 year old.<br/>
<br/>
However, there are some things (potties, etc) that I just don&#39;t feel any<br/>
need to hear about at this point in my life.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t recommend Always Unschooled enough, but (personally) what I would<br/>
like to read about here, is how unschooling school-aged children is<br/>
panning out...what people are getting up to each day (new ideas), how<br/>
their children are growing without school, how perspectives have been<br/>
wonderfully (and forever) changed by their children...that kind of thing.<br/>

The purpose of the list is to provide useful information about unschooling<br/>
for anyone sincerely interested in unschooling their children. The intent<br/>
is to help people move out of their own comfort zones as we critically<br/>
examine beliefs, ideas, and viewpoints about learning that get in the way<br/>
of unschooling, and seek a deeper understanding of unschooling and more<br/>
respectful relationships with our children.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-20295639">Hi Shell<br/>
<br/>
Nice to see another RUA person here. (For all of you who are unlikely to <br/>
know, RUA = Radical Unschoolers of Aotearoa aka New Zealand)<br/>
:-)<br/>
