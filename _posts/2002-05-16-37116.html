<div id="ygrps-yiv-1329763642">**Probably they were watching something really interesting.  If it&#39;s<br/>
recorded,<br/>
they can pause it without missing dialog, or rewind it.  It would be a<br/>
shame<br/>
if books couldn&#39;t be closed and picked up later, but they can, and<br/>
always<br/>
have had that &quot;pause&quot; feature. &lt;g&gt; **<br/>
<br/>
This is a new thought for me.  It tickles my brain in a nice way.<br/>
