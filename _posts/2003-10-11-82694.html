<br/>
That&#39;s one way my kids are different.  They aren&#39;t too old for very much at <br/>
all, nor did we consider them too young for much.  I think there&#39;s a direct <br/>
relation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to criticize the author/mom above, but I DO see in families <br/>
that say &quot;Wait until you&#39;re old enough&quot; that when the kids ARE &quot;old enough&quot; then <br/>
they&#39;re too old for the thing they were allowed to do.<br/>
<br/>
We tried to offer the world as a smorgasbord and so there are some favorites <br/>
my kids will still taste.  Raffi, for example.  Maybe because their dad and I <br/>
enjoyed it too, and didn&#39;t say &quot;turn off that baby stuff&quot; or any such thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly has watched Teletubbies and Rocky Horror Picture Show both on the same <br/>
day, and knew the latter before the former was created.  She watches them for <br/>
the music and the humor and the sets and costumes and production and she&#39;s <br/>
often doing something else at the same time--curling her ponies&#39; tales or making <br/>
a bag out of Levis or drawing.<br/>
<br/>
School kids, even more than kids who are given milestone permissions (not <br/>
until you&#39;re ten, not until you&#39;re 15, whatever), are told by the kids at school <br/>
what they may or may not like, what is cool and what is baby stuff.<br/>
<br/>
We have so far managed to avoid that, but we have kids who will listen to <br/>
Dave Schmave or to the new Elmo stuff because as little kids they could watch <br/>
Stand By Me and The Adventures of Priscilla, the Queen of the Desert.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I deal with this every day.  My son went to school until two years <br/>
ago (he finished 6th gr) so he does have that mentality.  It is tough <br/>
to get him to try things that he considers baby stuff or stupid or <br/>
not cool.  We have a family calendar that I have all sorts of outings <br/>
listed on.  I ask him which ones he&#39;d like to be a part of and which <br/>
ones he&#39;d rather not, so I can plan.  Most times I just accept what <br/>
he chooses, but every so often I know he&#39;ll enjoy the outing, but he <br/>
will decline because he&#39;s too cool.  Those are the ones I try to talk <br/>
him into trying &quot;just once&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago, I took my 18 yo daughter to a farm to volunteer.  This <br/>
is not just any farm, it is a farm that donates farm animals around <br/>
the world and it has mini villages set up like the villages where the <br/>
animals are going to go.  It has a lot of unusual animals like water <br/>
buffalo and camels besides regular farm animals.  There&#39;s nothing <br/>
babyish about a farm anyway unless you look at a farm the way it is <br/>
portrayed in baby books about farm animals (the cow says...).  But, <br/>
my son was adamant that he wasn&#39;t interested in visiting a farm, so <br/>
my 18-yo daughter and I went alone.  We came back with so many cool <br/>
stories that he agreed to try it out the next week.  He went, and he <br/>
enjoyed himself.  We helped out in the kitchen that day freezing <br/>
vegetables from the garden.  Now he wants to go back.  <br/>
<br/>
The same thing happened at the zoo.  My son only came with us because <br/>
he didn&#39;t want to stay home alone, but once we got there he wanted to <br/>
stay in the car and listen to music.  So, fine.  My 13-yo daughter <br/>
and I went in and we saw lots of stuff we knew he&#39;d like so we went <br/>
back to the car and told him some of the animals we saw and THEN he <br/>
came out to see them.  Once he got in there he was the one asking me <br/>
to wait while he looked at stuff a second time.  <br/>
<br/>
This is why I told the story about the kids in the car.  When I first <br/>
got the tapes, we listened to one story.  My son kept begging me to <br/>
turn on the radio instead because the stories were for little kids.  <br/>
My daughter and I enjoyed the stories.  I though maybe because we&#39;d <br/>
seen Jim Weiss in person and he didn&#39;t.  Anyway, that day in the car <br/>
that the kids were bickering, I just put the tape on and all three <br/>
settled down to listen.  He didn&#39;t even ask me change it.  <br/>
<br/>
I bought my daughter a $100 pair of Timberland boots at a second hand <br/>
store for $6 in new condition!  Actually, I bought them for him, but <br/>
now he doesn&#39;t want them.  At first he told me he&#39;d wear them if I <br/>
didn&#39;t tell anyone where I got them (no problem).  Now he won&#39;t wear <br/>
them because the color is last year&#39;s color.  Lucky for him they are <br/>
too big for him (Tim&#39;s run big) because I wouldn&#39;t have gotten him a <br/>
different pair just because he didn&#39;t like the color.  In all <br/>
honesty, he is a lot LESS brand conscious than other kids I know and <br/>
I know that is because he has not gone to junior high or high school, <br/>
but it still is there.  I bought him a hoodie (a sweatshirt with a <br/>
hood) the other day and he had a hard time picking one because it <br/>
couldn&#39;t have a zipper and it had to have pockets on the side, etc, <br/>
etc because that is what his friend has.<br/>
<br/>
Like Holly, my 13-yo daughter has no problem watching Telletubbies <br/>
and Rocky Horror Picture Show in the same day.  She is oblivious to <br/>
brand names.  She loves farm animals and the zoo.  I can only aspire <br/>
to this with my son. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I&#39;ve had to deal with kids who didn&#39;t want to go (cousins or guests) <br/>
I&#39;ve appealed to their adult feelings, and asked them to go with me to help with <br/>
the littler kids.  I&#39;ve said &quot;You&#39;ll probably know some thing about tigers I <br/>
don&#39;t even know&quot; or &quot;The restaurant has some really cool carvings I think you&#39;d <br/>
like, and we can come back sooner if you&#39;re really not having fun.&quot;  I <br/>
recruit them as other adults instead of one of the kids, and then they forget, <br/>
usually.  I have one nephew who&#39;s particularly recalcitrant, but his mom has been <br/>
reviewing his life lately in light of some stuff she&#39;s read on autism and says <br/>
maybe he&#39;s never much liked eye-contact/conversation/input stuff because of <br/>
something organic.  Could be.  He was functional but uncomfortable.<br/>

&gt; Jim Weiss is *wonderful*, but also try to find some Jay O&#39;Callahan.  Some<br/>
&gt; of his stories are hilarious, to both adults and kids.  He writes all his<br/>
&gt; own material, so it&#39;s a whole different thing from the story-telling Jim<br/>
&gt; Weiss does.<br/>
