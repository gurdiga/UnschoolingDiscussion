<div id="ygrps-yiv-528899863">Hi everyone,<br/>
I joined this list over a month ago and have enjoyed reading and <br/>
learning from all of you.  I can&#39;t seem to stay caught up on all the <br/>
posts but figured I would just jump in.<br/>
I have a ds who just turned 6, a dd almost 4 and a ds of 18 months.  <br/>
I guess we have been unschooling since our first was born.  I have <br/>
only recently discovered how unsupportive everyone can be.  Most <br/>
people thought it was great until my oldest got old enough to go <br/>
to &quot;real school&quot;  It seems many people think self learning is only a <br/>
supplement to a &quot;regular education&quot;.  I am not discouraged although <br/>
I would love to find other unschoolers in my area.  I recently <br/>
started attending monthly playgroups with a local homeschooling <br/>
group but find that the adult conversations usually revolve around <br/>
curriculums so I have nothing to offer.  At the first meeting I <br/>
mentioned that we were unschoolers and got a few polite nods and <br/>
more than a few raised eyebrows.  Later a woman whispered to me that <br/>
she was interested in learning more about unschooling.  It was <br/>
obvious that she didn&#39;t want anyone to hear us!  My kids are just so <br/>
excited to find friends that they don&#39;t have to wait until after <br/>
school to play with so we will continue to go.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve seen Florida mentioned on this list so just wondering <br/>
if anyone is near me.  I&#39;m in Palm Beach county.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Maggy<br/>
I grew up in West Palm Bch.<br/>
My parents still live there, and I was just there last week.  We come <br/>
down about 3 times a year.  We live in MD now.<br/>
I&#39;ve always been interested in finding unschoolers down there, for <br/>
when we visit.  We usually go to the Playmobile store, the fountains <br/>
on Clematis, the downtown library (which is awsome compared to ours <br/>
here) and other places around town.  Usually the free stuff.<br/>
Anyway, I hope you find a group of like minded folks.  Maybe we can <br/>
hook up next time we&#39;re down, which won&#39;t be til Thankgiving.<br/>
Good luck<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316662184">Thanks, sorry we missed you, wish I had written in sooner....definitely let me know when you&#39;re back and we&#39;ll meet!<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are other unschooling families down here, it&#39;s just a matter of finding them.  Hmmm, closet unschoolers?<br/>

<br/>
to &quot;real school&quot;  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Until he was school age, though, you were just raising babies and toddlers in <br/>
a good way.   ALL mothers should.  I wish ALL mothers felt they were being <br/>
supportive and helping their children learn in the best ways for that child, <br/>
by playing, and exploring.  <br/>
<br/>
The radical thing is when the child is old enough for compulsory education <br/>
laws to apply to him and THEN the mom wants to help him learn in his own ways <br/>
by playing and exploring at home.  <br/>
<br/>
To my mind, that is when unschooling starts.  When a mom keeps him home <br/>
instead of sending him to school.<br/>
<br/>
It was, for us, an extension of the warm and fun things we had been doing <br/>
before Kirby was schoolage.  But I never say &quot;Yeah, I&#39;ve been unschooling <br/>
since he was born.&quot;   I know some people do.<br/>
<br/>
People in some of the Atlantic seaboard states say that fancy pre-schools are <br/>
so expected there in certain social strata that if they don&#39;t send a two or <br/>
three year old to private school, relatives and neighbors get all up in arms, <br/>
and so they will say &quot;we&#39;re homeschooling.&quot;   I think they should take some <br/>
courage and say &quot;We&#39;re not sending him to pre-school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Later a woman whispered to me that <br/>
<br/>
she was interested in learning more about unschooling.  It was <br/>
<br/>
obvious that she didn&#39;t want anyone to hear us!  .&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is so sad.  But I totally understand it.   I got jumped hard on our <br/>
local announcements list by people who had been homeschooling with a <br/>
curriculum for just a year or two when I answered a new member&#39;s question <br/>
about whether people on the list used a curriculum or not and if so which <br/>
one.  I described unschooling and said I&#39;d been doing it since by 16 year old <br/>
was five.  New structured homeschoolers commenced to try to shush me.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a threat to people who are &quot;making their children do work&quot; and <br/>
telling them YES you have to do this or you&#39;ll never learn to read (or <br/>
whatever).  Then the unschoolers cruise by laughing about what they just <br/>
learned (by reading or not) and eventually read just fine, which pretty much <br/>
makes the structured parents look like liars and bullies.<br/>
<br/>
It can&#39;t be helped, and we regularly have to bear the fallout of the angry <br/>
frustration of people who WANT us to torment our children just so they will <br/>
feel better about their own decision to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Ren will find you some local contacts!  There is a website.<br/>

<br/>
But more and more parents are seeking out daycare centers with the most<br/>
&quot;advanced&quot; curriculums for six-month-olds and being a SAHM is<br/>
controversial.  I was confronted over and over by people who thought my<br/>
kids were missing out by being home with me instead of in a daycare<br/>
center with other kids, learning.  Especially when my older son didn&#39;t<br/>
learn to speak until he was three, while his cousin who is three months<br/>
younger and had been in daycare since six weeks old seemed so far<br/>
&quot;ahead&quot;.  So in a day and age when there are structured curriculums for<br/>
babies and toddlers, I can see the validity in saying you&#39;re<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; at that age.<br/>

Ah, Dreher Park. My kids love that zoo I think more so than the Metrozoo in<br/>
Miami. We were supposed to go a few weeka ago but the kids were sick. Now<br/>
it&#39;s so darn hot. The zoo is not a good place in the summer. We also missed<br/>
Lion Country and now it&#39;s too hot for that too. All the animals just don&#39;t<br/>
move in the heat!! The museum was small but cute. We haven&#39;t done the<br/>
Morikami, didn&#39;t think it would interest my kids much. I&#39;ll have to check it<br/>
out.<br/>

<br/>
I say I have unschooled from birth too. At least with the last 3 children.<br/>
Only because I know how we parent them and what it entails. It&#39;s more to me<br/>
than just the &quot;no school.&quot; I use to do things with Tara when she was 1 and 2<br/>
that I never did with the other 3. Like showing pictures and letters and<br/>
repeating words and sounds and counting. I get a headache just thinking<br/>
about it.  Poor kid!!! I know a lot of parents that do such things. And<br/>
being that Tara never came and asked me to do it, well that was pretty much<br/>
like school even though she wasn&#39;t school age. So yeah, we have been<br/>
unschooling for over 8 years now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-315056330">I guess what I mean is that we&#39;ve done everything so differently than our &quot;schooled&quot;  friends.  Our kids have really never followed any type of schedule.  I nursed them when they were hungry, they slept when they were tired, etc.  I was always being told that they needed consistency and I responded that they had consistency.   Their needs were being met but they didn&#39;t have to eat lunch because it was noon, or nap because it was 2:00 etc.<br/>
I joined a mom&#39;s club when my first was around 6 months old.  It was great at first and we made lots of friends until everyone decided it was time for the babies to potty train so they could start preschool.  I always figured my son would start using the toilet when he wanted to and guess what? he did.  But he didn&#39;t go to preschool with all his friends and then this year all of them started kindergarten....  We have recently connected with other kids that are not in school and it really helps.<br/>

<br/>
I was excited to read your email as we live right outside palm beach <br/>
(not sure how far that is from you)by Boca.  We are just beginning <br/>
our journey as our oldest is turning 5.  I am just getting out there <br/>
and trying to meet others with similar interests.  I also have a 2 <br/>
years old so it sounds like our kids could get along.   I would love <br/>
to hear more about how you do things since we are truely new to this <br/>
but really excited.  Email me if you would like to chat some about <br/>

You must go to Dreher park!! They have done a major expansion and a <br/>
brand new fountain--what do call those things where the sprinklers <br/>
come out of the ground.  It is amazing what they have done.  We just <br/>
went the other day.  If you get there by 9-10 then you can get out <br/>
around 12-1 before the worst of the heat comes in.<br/>

&lt;&lt;They just completed a great fountain at the zoo so now it&#39;s bearable to go<br/>
in this heat.  We live very close (5 min.) and last week we were there 3<br/>
times!  The kids wear their bathing suits and have a blast.  When was the<br/>
last time you were there?  The zoo has undergone some amazing changes in the<br/>
last year.  It would really be worth the drive.  I promise!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were there last year. We loved the new rain forest thing to the tiger,<br/>
you know with the mist. Cooled us down some. So the kids can wear their<br/>
bathing suits and play in the fountain? Sounds like a winner to me. Lion<br/>
Country will have to wait now until Nov. or so!!! The lions get way lazy in<br/>
this heat!<br/>

Hi Olga, sounds great. I just am not real familiar with anything north of me<br/>
past Fort Lauderdale as far as meeting. So if you can come up with a nice<br/>
park or something that would be great. Just make it easy to get to. &lt;BG&gt;<br/>
Don&#39;t want to be driving around aimlessly with 3 children! I can pick up I95<br/>
in 2 minutes.<br/>

Surely you jest! LOL!!! Us??? Get anywhere by 9-10!!!! In my dreams only.<br/>
I&#39;m lucky I can get us out of the house by 12:00. And even at that I have to<br/>
have the kids set their alarms!!<br/>
