<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801688002">I have just recently (last few months) started talking to my dh about <br/>
homeschooling our children.  I really want to go to the conference now that everyone <br/>
here has been explaining about it so much!  We talked about it last night.  He <br/>
was wondering what the kids will do at the conference.  I did explain that <br/>
it&#39;s not a conference like at work... but did suggest things like take the kids <br/>
to the pool to swim, play with other kids, etc.  I would love for us to attend <br/>
as a family but am wondering if I could get more out of it by myself or just <br/>
with dh and have the kids play with grandma for the weekend.  I do want my <br/>
husband to attend, the conference would give him a chance to meet other families <br/>
for whom this WORKS!<br/>
<br/>
Although he is not sure about just how unschooling would work, I think he has <br/>
at least come around to the idea that NOT sending them to school is the way <br/>
to go.  I give him examples from my previous life as a special ed teacher all <br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
I have asked him to at least read a few books about unschooling since I don&#39;t <br/>
think I always explain it so well.  He&#39;s thinking that the kids are still <br/>
young(3 1/2 & 1), why do we need to make this decision now?  I&#39;m <br/>
thinking...Kindergarten in ps would be  just another year away.  I want him to be on board to <br/>
this idea as much as I am because I&#39;m sure it would be very hard for a family <br/>
to unschool if only one parent is &quot;into&quot; it.<br/>
<br/>
As it&#39;s not too far to drive, I think we will go!  Also...for those of you <br/>
who are making a vacation out of it...there are tons of things to do in that <br/>
area.  For young kids, the Boston Children&#39;s Museum is great.  As well as several <br/>
other museums in Boston and of course checking out Cape Cod.<br/>

<br/>
Two thoughts on this:<br/>
<br/>
First: my dh is impossible about reading books (and he is one of the &quot;gets<br/>
it&quot; Dads) but I believe he came to it from several steps including - me<br/>
sometimes reading him a pertinent paragraph from Holt or other books; us<br/>
spending time talking about what was bad about our parents with us and what<br/>
would have been better (possibly the real key); me forwarding him a *few*<br/>
posts from this list, or the *occasional* pithy article/post from<br/>
sandradodd.com, unschooling.com or naturalchild.org. I tried highlighting<br/>
passages and book marking pages for him in the books but that is just not<br/>
him. He is far more likely to read anything if it is shining out of a<br/>
screen, or in a magazine of which he consumes many each month. I get Life<br/>
Learning delivered. If your dh likes reading books - hurrah!<br/>
<br/>
Once when I tried to give him something to look at, he said grumpily, &quot;Is<br/>
that another book for you to criticize me with?&quot; I realized that my<br/>
&quot;instructing him&quot; attitude to unschooling was not helping anyone. Now I do<br/>
more by e-mail, and tell him I have sent him something funny or really<br/>
interesting *to me* that he might enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
Secondly: I&#39;m sure you have been reading the several threads on the<br/>
frustrations people have changing from one parenting system to another, and<br/>
letting go of restrictions. It is a whole lifestyle, not just the going to<br/>
school part. Every time one these threads comes up I am so glad we started<br/>
almost from the beginning of Jayn&#39;s (4) life with these ideas, that flowed<br/>
naturally from attachment parenting for us. She is sometimes wild, and has<br/>
done what might be termed &quot;naughty&quot; things with poured liquids - her<br/>
favorite playtoy is water - but she is so much fun, and has no fear of us in<br/>
her eyes. I urge him to go to the conference because hearing people speak is<br/>
so much easier for some kinds of learners (Multiple intelligences and all<br/>
that) than reading things. My dh was already (before Jayn was born) an<br/>
anti-spanker (as was I) and anti-shouter (which I had to learn to be, from<br/>
my own reading to find the many alternatives, and from him and his support).<br/>
<br/>
Aw gee, I wish he was home, I&#39;d go give him a big hug and kiss. Jayn is<br/>
still snoozing so I don&#39;t want to wake her yet. (50 emails to go!)<br/>
