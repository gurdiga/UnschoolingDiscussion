<div id="ygrps-yiv-681311932">The following administrative message will be posted monthly or as necessary:<br/>
<br/>
The primary purpose of this list is mutual support for unschooling, which can <br/>
mean different things to different people. Because there is no one right <br/>
definition or approach, the expression and coexistence of diverse viewpoints <br/>
is encouraged and expected on this list. Posts which are primarily <br/>
argumentative, defensive, and/or focused on past grievances will not be <br/>
tolerated. Mary Broussard (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lite2yu@...">lite2yu@...</a>) and Cindy Fergerson <br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:crma@...">crma@...</a>) are co-moderators for this list. Feel free to contact <br/>
either of them at any time for information or assistance.<br/>
