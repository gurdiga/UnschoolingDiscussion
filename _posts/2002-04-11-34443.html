<div id="ygrps-yiv-11532203">I read WC Fields said, &quot;If at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again,<br/>
and then give up.  There&#39;s no sense being a damn fool about it.&quot;  I think<br/>
sometimes we do need to see something through, and even torture is<br/>
endurable if we take it one second at a time and know there will be an<br/>
end to it.  But there do come times when we need to give ourselves some<br/>
slack and allow ourselves to lighten our load of the unnecessaries.  I<br/>
think the best thing to do is to really listen to why the child wants to<br/>
quit the class and question how productive it would be to stick with it<br/>
and list the pros and cons of quitting or staying with the child.  That&#39;s<br/>
when they really surprise me with how creative and insightful they can<br/>
be, when they get all the information and weigh it in their own mind<br/>
rather than being told what they should think about it.  <br/>
