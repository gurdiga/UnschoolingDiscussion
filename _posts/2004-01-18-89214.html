<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070059190">We looked into homebirth for our second child (1995) and our insurance would<br/>
have covered it.  I think it was Massachusetts Mutual. We decided not to<br/>
have a homebirth because of the sudden and still unexplained problems our<br/>
oldest had at birth (greenish skin tone, bad smell, cord not pulsing,<br/>
hypotonic, seizures, etc.) which led to 2 weeks in the NICU.  It was the<br/>
scariest thing that has ever happened to me.  The second was big, healthy<br/>
and everything went perfectly.  The third was medium-sized, healthy and<br/>
everything went perfectly.   I still regret not having a homebirth, but I<br/>
was too scared.<br/>
