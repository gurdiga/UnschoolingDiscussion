<div id="ygrps-yiv-1875766229">I am tired, and realized I haven&#39;t recovered as emotionally as I thought I <br/>
had. I&#39;m also feeling a little anemic, so that doesn&#39;t help. I&#39;m going to <br/>
take a break from this list for a while, not going to unsub, just going on no <br/>
mail for a bit. Its my fault for not listening to myself sooner, and I let <br/>
some things get to me, shared things I normally wouldn&#39;t have, and replied to <br/>
some things I would have normally just let slide on by. &lt;g&gt; So for now, I <br/>
will see where this takes me. I&#39;ll see some of you in the quiet backroom. <br/>
<br/>
Much love to you all,<br/>
~Nancy<br/>
