<div id="ygrps-yiv-395261561">You might be interested in looking into the American Natural Hygiene<br/>
Society. They are an organization of people who eat mostly raw foods and<br/>
avoid the cooking process if at all possible. They have a magazine that<br/>
comes out bimonthly with articles and recipes. The founder of this<br/>
organization was Herbert Shelton who was an outspoken Natural Hygienist and<br/>
who wrote many books on the subject of health and diet. I even have a few.<br/>
<br/>
I tried looking for a website and it is anhs.org but it&#39;s not up yet.<br/>
Here is another website you could try that has some various information<br/>
about Natural Hygiene:<br/>
