<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111583035">My brother was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome and<br/>
for 5 years was unsuccessfully treated by doctors.  I don&#39;t<br/>
recommend anyone self treating except when all options have<br/>
been exhausted and no relief occurs.  After doing a great<br/>
deal of research, and knowing to consult a doctor who was<br/>
experienced with alternative herbal medicine, he found<br/>
relief from many of his symptoms and he is much happier. He<br/>
will always live with it but traditional medicine did not<br/>
work for him. He is now able to earn a living. I am all for<br/>
self treating for minor illnesses.  I know of one family who<br/>
are treating their son for ADHD with herbals and they love<br/>
the results without the ritalin induced state he was once<br/>
in.<br/>
