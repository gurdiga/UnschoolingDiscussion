<div id="ygrps-yiv-50972416">Hi All just had to share an aha moment of unschooling.  I was baking<br/>
chocolate chip cookies (yes from scratch) while Max is napping and Steve and<br/>
Zak are building something with a Marbleworks &quot;thing&quot;... They are showing me<br/>
how they have set the structure up to give them more challenge in getting<br/>
the ball to go down... I was awestruck to stand there and watch my 6 year<br/>
old son and my 30something hubby playing together... I had to write and<br/>
share....<br/>
<br/>
Just as I&#39;m going to write my signature reality hits and Max wakes up<br/>
screaming from his nap and looking for mummy.....as I&#39;m trying to finish<br/>
this off hubby is not sitting next to me comforting Max and Zak is laying on<br/>
the bed playing a car race game my mother gave him....<br/>
<br/>
ahhh the joys of having a home business and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
