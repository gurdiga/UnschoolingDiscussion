We aim to inspire parents, educators, and others interested in<br/>
educational policy and practice to consider diverse ways in which<br/>
children and adults can gain meaningful, integrated knowledge and<br/>
develop their own authentic potentials.<br/>

These pages explore the contributions of some of the thinkers central to<br/>
the development of the theory and practice of lifelong learning and<br/>
informal education.<br/>

begun to check out.<br/>
