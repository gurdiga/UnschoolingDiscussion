<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473713246">I don&#39;t frequent the list a lot, as I&#39;m usually to busy to <br/>
participate.  However, today I got a scare and I need to share and <br/>
get some imput.  <br/>
     My boys 6 & 7 y/o went out today to feed and water the dogs, <br/>
when they finished they came back in and asked to play outdoors.  I <br/>
had no problem with that, so out they went.  However, today they <br/>
decided to venture out the gate (without permission).  We live in <br/>
the village and own the property between 2 streets.  They went out <br/>
the back on the less traveled street and next door onto the edge of <br/>
the parking lot of a local business.  Someone at that business <br/>
called the police and the police picked the boys up and came to the <br/>
door.  For some reason the boys told the officer I wasn&#39;t home, <br/>
probably not wanting to get into trouble.  He said if he didn&#39;t find <br/>
me at home he was going to call FIA.  Then he started complaining <br/>
that they aren&#39;t in school and don&#39;t know anything, etc, etc.  I <br/>
couldn&#39;t believe what I was hearing and what was happening, as the <br/>
boys hadn&#39;t been outside more than 10 to 15 minutes.  He wanted <br/>
their names, ages, my name and phone number and how many kids I had, <br/>
I gave him the info. and told him they were privately schooled (we <br/>
live in Michigan).  I&#39;m not sure if I should have gave him that <br/>
info., as I couldn&#39;t think at the time.  He gave me and the boys a <br/>
lecture and finally let them out of his car for me to take inside.  <br/>
I kept telling him I needed to go, as I had an infant that was <br/>
sleeping inside, but he kept going on and on.<br/>
     The thing that gets me is our society expects children to be <br/>
locked up between certain hours of the day and if kids are out <br/>
during that time frame, people get up in arms about it.  I don&#39;t <br/>
want to feel like I have to lock my kids up during school hours, but <br/>
I don&#39;t like dealing with situations like what happened today either.<br/>
     There&#39;s some kids my sons age that runs all over town, all of <br/>
the time,outside of school hours and the police never pick them up.  <br/>
They walk across town to play with my kids, because I won&#39;t let my <br/>
kids outside the yard without supervision.  Here I am, the cautious <br/>
parent and I get hasseled just because my kids happened to venture <br/>
outside the gate during school hours.  My husband just happened to <br/>
be on the part of his mail route that comes near our home when he <br/>
saw the officer leaving.  He came home worried something had <br/>
happened to one of us, only to find out the above.  He wasn&#39;t only <br/>
up-set that the boys left the yard without permission, but that the <br/>
police were even called.  Why do people feel they need to meddle?  <br/>
Now, I feel like I can&#39;t let my kids outside during the day, even in <br/>
their own yard and I&#39;m worried this officer is going to watch our <br/>
place and call FIA if he see the kids out to often, so I&#39;m <br/>
frustrated!  What would you do?  I want to move now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301286208">Oh my goodness! Robin, how awful. <br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t know what to advise you. I&#39;d have been in tears, probably. <br/>
angry, afraid.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, just have some good answers prepared, in case something <br/>
happens again? such as &quot;Must I give you this information? Have I done <br/>
anything wrong? Are the boys in trouble?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
whew. I feel for you<br/>
<br/>
blessings, HeidiC<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Robin, I feel for you. It most have been a heck of a scare.<br/>
<br/>
Now, 6-7 year olds walking across town!?!? That&#39;s odd. Still, I live in <br/>
NYC and have little knowledge of the comings and goings of people in <br/>
the rest of the US. As they say, there is NYC and then there is the US <br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
I think that the best thing you can do is walkwalkwalk EVERYWHERE <br/>
EVERYDAY with your kids. Here in my little piece of the Big Apple, <br/>
everybody and their mother knows my family. They may not know our <br/>
names, but I have people recognize me in other parts of town as the mom <br/>
with the two boys that go everywhere together. In a city where nobody <br/>
knows even your face, everybody knows us. They know we homeschool, they <br/>
know we are around. They expect to see us around. We took a <br/>
mini-vacation this past week and people noticed our absence.<br/>
<br/>
It has always been important for me that my kids have a strong sense of <br/>
community and that means, knowing our postman, grocers, pharmacists, <br/>
area policemen, firemen, area nannies, building supers, etc. <br/>
Unschooling for us is an opportunity to not just be out and about in <br/>
our neighborhood but to live fully in it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Didn&#39;t John Holt, in one of his books, say something about children <br/>
&gt; &gt;staying at home alone was better than school?  I seem to remember him <br/>
&gt; &gt;talking about kids staying home alone at very young ages.  I also <br/>
&gt; &gt;remember something about a very young child going to a library alone <br/>
&gt; &gt;to occupy himself during the day if the mom had to work?  <br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it was more common when I was growing up. My mum was a single <br/>
&gt; parent of three. We often would get in from school around 4pm, eat the <br/>
&gt; sadwhiches she&#39;d left for us and then go out and play until she got home <br/>
&gt; from work about 6 or 7. That wasn&#39;t neglect. That was normal. While none <br/>
&gt; of the neighbours were particuarly keeping an eye on us we knew we could <br/>
&gt; knock on most of the doors if there was a problem and we&#39;d been taught <br/>
&gt; to use the phone box across the street to dial 999 if it was serious.<br/>
&gt; I recall times when she worked in the school,holidays so we would be <br/>
&gt; alone all day. She gave us a list of chores, shopping to fetch and left <br/>
&gt; us food. My only gripe was that, as the ledest , I was meant to be <br/>
&gt; responsible for my brother sister. So I&#39;d get into trouble :-(<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That wqas kind of our life growing up. My mom always worked, and we&#39;d come <br/>
home from school and watch tv, or play, or whatever. We played outside with <br/>
friends, and we were allowed to have friends my parents knew play at my house (if <br/>
they were allowed)  None of our friends&#39; moms worked.<br/>
<br/>
We liked it a lot. My sister and I fought a lot, but I&#39;m not sure we wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have had my mom been home. And I always needed lots of time for myself, and <br/>
that gave me good opportunities for it.<br/>
<br/>
That said...I&#39;m glad I&#39;m here for Juls.  AND one of the coolest things my mom <br/>
ever said to me before she died was that she wished they&#39;d known about <br/>
homeschooling for me.<br/>
