<div id="ygrps-yiv-880818862">Wow...thanks, Ned!  Your posts answered alot of my recent (since joining<br/>
the list) concerns (on my &#39;ability&#39; to be a REAL unschooler).  <br/>
<br/>
Before joining, and only going by reading a few HEM magazines and J.<br/>
Holt books, I&#39;d &#39;thought&#39; I wanted to unschool.  In fact, I acknowledged<br/>
to myself that we&#39;d already been unschoolers since Emma was born (she&#39;s<br/>
now three).   It felt natural to me, being a devotee to attachement<br/>
(child-led) parenting. <br/>
<br/>
After reading a few of the threads, I began to worry....I began to think<br/>
that if I was an &#39;unschooler&#39; that meant that I could never &#39;teach&#39; my<br/>
daughter things.  That word seemed to be a big NO NO here : )<br/>
Ever since, I&#39;ve had a hard time trying to wrap my brain around the<br/>
concept of unschooling.  Maybe I had it all wrong, I wondered?!<br/>
<br/>
Now, with your post, it all begins to feel natural again!  I can &#39;teach&#39;<br/>
Em to cook since she loves it!).  I can &#39;teach&#39; her how a plant can grow<br/>
from a seed (since she&#39;s curious)!  And when she asks, I can teach her<br/>
what different sounds letters make.  I really didn&#39;t like being paranoid<br/>
of using that word....teach : )<br/>
<br/>
Getting back to phonics books....Have you heard anything about Reading<br/>
Reflex?  It&#39;s a&#39;new(?) method of phonics where there are no rules to<br/>
learn...and they use terms like &#39;sound pictures&#39; (the letters that<br/>
represent the sounds in words).  I&#39;ve a friend out in CA who is tutoring<br/>
using this book/method and she claims that it is the best thing she&#39;s<br/>
ever seen (and she&#39;s beena reading tutor for 20some years).  I&#39;ve just<br/>
ordered it and haven&#39;t had a chance to read yet, so I&#39;d be very<br/>
interested in any feedback.  I&#39;m not intending to drill my dd with<br/>
it...but I am looking into finding a better way to answer some of her<br/>
&#39;reading&#39; questions than I how learned in ps....because frankly, I<br/>
cannot remember alot of what I learned (imagine that!)...but I do<br/>
remember that I had a hard time with all those rules : ).<br/>
