 Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.  My son likes not having a <br/>
 structued lesson every day but I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s learning <br/>
 anything.  I know I can teach him through everyday life but I am now <br/>
 very confused as to what I should be teaching him at this age or how <br/>
 to go about it.  I always felt that reading was the most important <br/>
 thing.  He knows how to read but not very well.  I can&#39;t seem to find <br/>
 an approach to further his skills.  One way I can get him to read is <br/>
 having a treasure hunt however, I can not supply him with a new toy <br/>
 every day so he will read.<br/>
 <br/>
 Any suggestions as to where to start or how to proceed would be <br/>
 appreciated.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well, what we do . . . so take it with a large grain of salt . . .  is a mix <br/>
of things.<br/>
<br/>
You think reading is important (who doesn&#39;t?) -- get him a library card.  Let <br/>
him pick out whatever he likes.  Don&#39;t insist that he finish everything (do <br/>
you finish everything you check out?  I don&#39;t.).  Talk about what he reads.  <br/>
If he wants to.  <br/>
<br/>
I went on line and got the standards for what the ps is suppose to teach the <br/>
kids in each grade here (not impressive but it gave me a mental health check <br/>
and guide).  I have these vaguely in the back of my mind as a rough overall <br/>
guide.  But day to day -- we do a lot of things on the computer -- from <br/>
grammar to math to games.  It all counts and it all adds to his store of <br/>
knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Also, my 7 yo is learning (still with a lot of help) how to look things up -- <br/>
in the disctionary and computer encyclopedia and on line (his favorites so <br/>
far -- Ask Jeeves).  That way he can investigate when he has a question.  <br/>
<br/>
And there are outside lessons for things he has an interest in -- it doesn&#39;t <br/>
all have to come from me -- and thank goodness.  For example, he takes Tae <br/>
Kwon Do and piano lessons.  If you saw me (typical Mom -- no athlete) you <br/>
would realize I&#39;m not going to be teaching any martial arts any time soon.  <br/>
And he passed me by on the piano end of things a long time ago!  So he needs <br/>
people who know more than I do in certain areas.  And my daughter takes dance <br/>
-- she&#39;s younger so it&#39;s sort of a social thing too because I don&#39;t know how <br/>
much she&#39;s really getting out of it but she enjoys it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you and yours will discover things you like and include what you like <br/>
and think you&#39;d like to learn about and (it&#39;s OK) what you think he should <br/>
learn about.  <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t in any way mean, at least to me, that there is any sort <br/>
of anti-academic atmosphere that is supposed to be happening.  Just that you <br/>
get to choose what the content should be.  <br/>
<br/>
But day to day structure -- what little we had -- is about to go out the <br/>
window anyway as summer quickly approaches.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.  I&#39;m sure you will get it all sorted out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772675006">HI all,<br/>
I have been lurking in the shadows for weeks now, but I thought I would step <br/>
out and say &quot;Thanks&quot; for all the post and encouragments. Nance: I enjoyed <br/>
your post!<br/>
<br/>
I have a 3yr and 1yr old, and plan to unschool (which are already REALLY <br/>
doing just by living).  It is nice to know how others live and incorporate <br/>
education in their children&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
I thought if I hang around other unschoolers, by the time my kids are <br/>
&quot;official&quot; unschoolers, I may feel confident. hee hee hee.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111822480">Hi and welcome Lorrie<br/>
<br/>
My approach to the reading is to read aloud to the children rather than be<br/>
trying to jolly them along into doing it for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I try to read all sorts of stuff to them (newspaper articles, picture books,<br/>
chapter books, National Geographics, reference books, poetry). I find they<br/>
can handle books way beyond their &quot;reading age&quot; or own reading ability but<br/>
to stop it getting too heavy I intersperse with lighter stuff. Sometimes we<br/>
read two or three chapter books at the same time, it keeps me from flagging<br/>
and keeps up the interest better (we have five kids aged 3 to 10). If they<br/>
are around when I read the newspaper and start asking questions about photos<br/>
or headlines I read bits aloud to them. I want them to know by experience<br/>
that reading is both fun and a way to find out things.<br/>
<br/>
As much as possible I let them choose what we read and because there are<br/>
five of them we cover a lot of different ground. We also have quite a lot of<br/>
books and stories on tape which are great in the car or for quiet times or<br/>
for when I&#39;m not available to read to them.<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old daughter is an avid reader but still enjoys being read to,<br/>
also she is starting to share the reading aloud job. My eight year old<br/>
daughter has the phonics basics and can sound out words but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;flow&quot; for her yet. She is starting to bring things to me more now to show<br/>
me that she can read the title or whatever. Our attitude is that it will<br/>
happen for her and not to stress about it. I am noticing differences between<br/>
the two girls in that the first is very interested in stories, the second is<br/>
more interested in finding out information that she needs for a particular<br/>
reason.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to hearing what others on this list will have to say in<br/>
answer to your questions.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Karen<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Hello.  My name is Lorrie.  I am new to the list and to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My<br/>
&gt; daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.  After one year of<br/>
&gt; ps for my 7 yo I finally had enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So this is my first year of homeschooling.  I gathered all kinds of<br/>
&gt; information and read and read.  I got the scope and sequence for<br/>
&gt; first grade and set out to meet those goals.  Well it did not take<br/>
&gt; long to see that my son hates learning from a book and doing<br/>
&gt; worksheets.  After many days of fighting I almost gave up.  Then I<br/>
&gt; remembered reading about unschooling.  So here I am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.  My son likes not having a<br/>
&gt; structued lesson every day but I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s learning<br/>
&gt; anything.  I know I can teach him through everyday life but I am now<br/>
&gt; very confused as to what I should be teaching him at this age or how<br/>
&gt; to go about it.  I always felt that reading was the most important<br/>
&gt; thing.  He knows how to read but not very well.  I can&#39;t seem to find<br/>
&gt; an approach to further his skills.  One way I can get him to read is<br/>
&gt; having a treasure hunt however, I can not supply him with a new toy<br/>
&gt; every day so he will read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; appreciated.<br/>

I used to think, and periodically still think, that my son isn&#39;t learning<br/>
anything.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the cure:  Keep a daily journal or log or notes of what he does and<br/>
learns for a week or two.  That should show you how much learning is going on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322499934">Hi everyone.  I just subbed to this list yesterday.  I am very<br/>
new to homeschooling, and don&#39;t really feel like I have a &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>
I probably have come to this in a different way from a lot of<br/>
people.  We have a son, almost 7, with a unique combination of <br/>
challenges and gifts.  We have tried to find the right placement for<br/>
him in school.  There isn&#39;t one.  He learns best on his own, in his own<br/>
time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>
he is learning.  Whenever he is under stress he acts out behaviorally,<br/>
and at school he does that a lot.<br/>
<br/>
We were having so many problems that we met with the school and had<br/>
him officially switched to half days.  Things seemed to be better for<br/>
a while, and then he couldn&#39;t make the transition back to school<br/>
after spring break.  So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>
yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My head is spinning!  I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>
next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>
get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>
where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The <br/>
thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>
to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>
a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>
get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>
haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted territories,<br/>
and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, there are lots of issues.  I was not *planning* to do this,<br/>
but it became apparent to me that it was the only choice.  I need to<br/>
find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>
determination met.  And I need a peer group.  Or something.  I also<br/>
feel like an &quot;outsider&quot; among homeschoolers because I *do* hope that <br/>
my other child can go to school, as I hoped that my son would.  It&#39;s <br/>
just that I knew when it was time to take him out for the benefit<br/>
of everyone involved.<br/>

Rambling, I guess, but also hoping that someone can relate...<br/>

I am new here too and this is my first year homeschooling.  My advice <br/>
to you is to relax.  You don&#39;t have to do this perfectly, or even <br/>
anyway that someone else thinks you should.  I just got done reading <br/>
the book the Relaxed Homeschool by Mary Hood.  It is excellent and <br/>
will help you not to panic.  Since it is so close to the end of the year, I <br/>
would jsut take the rest of the time to relax, read, play, read, and have <br/>
fun.  The part I like best about hs my girls is having gotten to know <br/>
them so much better than when they were in school.  Just spend time <br/>
together.  You might want to check out eh libraries and playgrounds <br/>
during the day to casually meet others who might be hsing.  You might <br/>
start seeing school age kids more than you realized.  <br/>
<br/>

Welcome to homeschooling!<br/>
<br/>
My son never went to school because I thought he would get into trouble for<br/>
never being able to sit still.  When it was time for him to enter<br/>
kindergarten, I looked at our public school and at a private school, but I<br/>
could not imagine him fitting in well.  I feared he would be labelled and<br/>
get into trouble.  Plus, he didn&#39;t want to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike you, I was fortunate in that I had known a homeschooling family and<br/>
had been impressed with their approach.  Hence, the idea of homeschooling<br/>
was not foreign to me.<br/>
<br/>
I am not opposed to his going to school.  My goal is to give enable him to<br/>
learn in the way that works best for him, which also seems to be your goal.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe this &quot;home instruction&quot; can be a transition period for you.  Are you<br/>
required to do anything?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this can be difficult.  And, you are on your own!  It&#39;s  lot of<br/>
responsibility, and at first it can feel overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great that you have found some support groups.  Even if you feel<br/>
different, Ihope the groups can help you with homeschooling--support,<br/>
ideas, etc.<br/>
<br/>
During the first years of homeschooling I found a support group that was<br/>
mostly &quot;school at home&quot; and very Christian.  I am an agnostic and and<br/>
unschooler, so I felt rather out of place.  But, the women were wonderful<br/>
to me--they supported me, accepted me, gave me ideas, helped me feel part<br/>
of the group.  I always felt different, but, I valued the support and love<br/>
I received.<br/>
It took several years to find a support group that more closely met my<br/>
needs.  And then, after a few years it dissolved.  But, each group served<br/>
an important purpose for me.  <br/>
<br/>
E-mail lists have also served as a support group.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find one other mom with whom you click, that would be a<br/>
wonderful support for you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is a real challenge!  I hope others on the list respond to this issue.<br/>
<br/>
The hardest part about being a parent and a homeschool mom is the<br/>
diminution of alone time.  The main way I have dealt with  this is through<br/>
my wonderful husband.  He teaches at the college level and has a degree of<br/>
flexibility in his hours.  Since our son was born 11 years ago, he has<br/>
given me one day a week free to do as I please.  This is a gift I could not<br/>
live without.  I try to use that time to do my own activities.  At the<br/>
moment--gardening. <br/>
<br/>
I also take a nap every day and have since my son was 6 years old.  It<br/>
gives me energy in the evenings when my son is going full steam ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Keep us posted on how things go with you. And, best wishes!<br/>

 Hi<br/>
  My name is LeeAnne . I am also new to this list and to HS and Unschooling. <br/>
 Where do you get the scope and sequence and what are they? I will be <br/>
starting <br/>
 this fall with my 5 yr old with Kinderg.<br/>
 <br/>
 Thanks <br/>
 LeeAnne &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Three ways I know of:<br/>
<br/>
Our state (Fla) Dept of Ed has a web page on line that lists by grade and <br/>
subject a line-by-line description of what the kids are supposed to be taught.<br/>
<br/>
The books &quot;What You X Grader Should Know&quot; by Hirsch (sp?) -- library or book <br/>
stores.<br/>
<br/>
World Book (the encyclopedia people) had a listing on line.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes these are a good starting point and sanity check -- they were for <br/>
me.  <br/>

&gt; Where do you live? Sounds idyllic. I live in Santa Maria, CA now, but<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All this talk of the amazing things you guys can see in the wild<br/>
&gt; and/or<br/>
&gt; &gt;keep<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as pets is making me extremely jealous! In New Zealand we only find<br/>
&gt; &gt;rats,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mice, rabbits, hedgehogs, possums, frogs and skinks outside.<br/>
&gt; Red-eared<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; turtles are a pet shop item and very expensive. I remember someone<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hello.  My name is Lorrie.  I am new to the list and to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My<br/>
&gt; daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.  After one year of<br/>
&gt; ps for my 7 yo I finally had enough.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So this is my first year of homeschooling.  I gathered all kinds of<br/>
&gt; information and read and read.  I got the scope and sequence for<br/>
&gt; first grade and set out to meet those goals.  Well it did not take<br/>
&gt; long to see that my son hates learning from a book and doing<br/>
&gt; worksheets.  After many days of fighting I almost gave up.  Then I<br/>
&gt; remembered reading about unschooling.  So here I am.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.  My son likes not having a<br/>
&gt; structued lesson every day but I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s learning<br/>
&gt; anything.  I know I can teach him through everyday life but I am now<br/>
&gt; very confused as to what I should be teaching him at this age or how<br/>
&gt; to go about it.  I always felt that reading was the most important<br/>
&gt; thing.  He knows how to read but not very well.  I can&#39;t seem to find<br/>
&gt; an approach to further his skills.  One way I can get him to read is<br/>
&gt; having a treasure hunt however, I can not supply him with a new toy<br/>
&gt; every day so he will read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Any suggestions as to where to start or how to proceed would be<br/>
&gt; appreciated.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, what we do . . . so take it with a large grain of salt . . .  is a mix<br/>
&gt; of things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You think reading is important (who doesn&#39;t?) -- get him a library card.  Let<br/>
&gt; him pick out whatever he likes.  Don&#39;t insist that he finish everything (do<br/>
&gt; you finish everything you check out?  I don&#39;t.).  Talk about what he reads.<br/>
&gt; If he wants to.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went on line and got the standards for what the ps is suppose to teach the<br/>
&gt; kids in each grade here (not impressive but it gave me a mental health check<br/>
&gt; and guide).  I have these vaguely in the back of my mind as a rough overall<br/>
&gt; guide.  But day to day -- we do a lot of things on the computer -- from<br/>
&gt; grammar to math to games.  It all counts and it all adds to his store of<br/>
&gt; knowledge.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Also, my 7 yo is learning (still with a lot of help) how to look things up --<br/>
&gt; in the disctionary and computer encyclopedia and on line (his favorites so<br/>
&gt; far -- Ask Jeeves).  That way he can investigate when he has a question.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And there are outside lessons for things he has an interest in -- it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; all have to come from me -- and thank goodness.  For example, he takes Tae<br/>
&gt; Kwon Do and piano lessons.  If you saw me (typical Mom -- no athlete) you<br/>
&gt; would realize I&#39;m not going to be teaching any martial arts any time soon.<br/>
&gt; And he passed me by on the piano end of things a long time ago!  So he needs<br/>
&gt; people who know more than I do in certain areas.  And my daughter takes dance<br/>
&gt; -- she&#39;s younger so it&#39;s sort of a social thing too because I don&#39;t know how<br/>
&gt; much she&#39;s really getting out of it but she enjoys it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, you and yours will discover things you like and include what you like<br/>
&gt; and think you&#39;d like to learn about and (it&#39;s OK) what you think he should<br/>
&gt; learn about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Unschooling doesn&#39;t in any way mean, at least to me, that there is any sort<br/>
&gt; of anti-academic atmosphere that is supposed to be happening.  Just that you<br/>
&gt; get to choose what the content should be.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But day to day structure -- what little we had -- is about to go out the<br/>
&gt; window anyway as summer quickly approaches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good luck.  I&#39;m sure you will get it all sorted out.<br/>

&gt; HI all,<br/>
&gt; I have been lurking in the shadows for weeks now, but I thought I would step<br/>
&gt; out and say &quot;Thanks&quot; for all the post and encouragments. Nance: I enjoyed<br/>
&gt; your post!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have a 3yr and 1yr old, and plan to unschool (which are already REALLY<br/>
&gt; doing just by living).  It is nice to know how others live and incorporate<br/>
&gt; education in their children&#39;s lives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I thought if I hang around other unschoolers, by the time my kids are<br/>
&gt; &quot;official&quot; unschoolers, I may feel confident. hee hee hee.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks again.<br/>

&gt; Hi Susan<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; BTW I&#39;m a busy mum of 5 as well!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; New Zealand does have beautiful scenery and there is some pretty special<br/>
&gt; wildlife, for example the kiwi and tuatara aren&#39;t found anywhere else. We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t have any native mammals in NZ at all, but we do have deer, pigs and so<br/>
&gt; on in the wild, they are usually seen as pests and/or are hunted/farmed.<br/>
&gt; Possums are a major pest here.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rats and mice aren&#39;t a particular problem usually. We do have two cats which<br/>
&gt; deal with any wild ones that might be around the house. We also keep two pet<br/>
&gt; rats which have been a lot of fun. I wasn&#39;t keen at all but they&#39;ve been<br/>
&gt; very responsive and interesting and interactive with our girls. We have had<br/>
&gt; guineapigs in the past but they are much more timid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What I had in mind when I posted about the lack of wildlife was the bigger<br/>
&gt; animals such as wolves, bears, lions etc as we had been watching so many<br/>
&gt; videos about these animals both in the wild and as &quot;pets&quot; or semi-tame (like<br/>
&gt; &quot;Born Free&quot;). And I have long liked the idea of keeping turtles but here you<br/>
&gt; buy teeny ones from the pet shop and they are *so* expensive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; New Zealand is a beautiful place and I certainly appreciate the lack of<br/>
&gt; *dangerous* creatures here!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Regards,<br/>
&gt; Karen<br/>

&gt; Hi and welcome Lorrie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My approach to the reading is to read aloud to the children rather than be<br/>
&gt; trying to jolly them along into doing it for themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I try to read all sorts of stuff to them (newspaper articles, picture books,<br/>
&gt; chapter books, National Geographics, reference books, poetry). I find they<br/>
&gt; can handle books way beyond their &quot;reading age&quot; or own reading ability but<br/>
&gt; to stop it getting too heavy I intersperse with lighter stuff. Sometimes we<br/>
&gt; read two or three chapter books at the same time, it keeps me from flagging<br/>
&gt; and keeps up the interest better (we have five kids aged 3 to 10). If they<br/>
&gt; are around when I read the newspaper and start asking questions about photos<br/>
&gt; or headlines I read bits aloud to them. I want them to know by experience<br/>
&gt; that reading is both fun and a way to find out things.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As much as possible I let them choose what we read and because there are<br/>
&gt; five of them we cover a lot of different ground. We also have quite a lot of<br/>
&gt; books and stories on tape which are great in the car or for quiet times or<br/>
&gt; for when I&#39;m not available to read to them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My 10 year old daughter is an avid reader but still enjoys being read to,<br/>
&gt; also she is starting to share the reading aloud job. My eight year old<br/>
&gt; daughter has the phonics basics and can sound out words but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &quot;flow&quot; for her yet. She is starting to bring things to me more now to show<br/>
&gt; me that she can read the title or whatever. Our attitude is that it will<br/>
&gt; happen for her and not to stress about it. I am noticing differences between<br/>
&gt; the two girls in that the first is very interested in stories, the second is<br/>
&gt; more interested in finding out information that she needs for a particular<br/>
&gt; reason.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am looking forward to hearing what others on this list will have to say in<br/>
&gt; answer to your questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All the best,<br/>
&gt; Karen<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello.  My name is Lorrie.  I am new to the list and to unschooling.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have three kids.  17 yo girl, 7 yo boy and a 10 month old boy.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter is unfortunately a victim of the system.  After one year of<br/>
&gt; &gt; ps for my 7 yo I finally had enough.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So this is my first year of homeschooling.  I gathered all kinds of<br/>
&gt; &gt; information and read and read.  I got the scope and sequence for<br/>
&gt; &gt; first grade and set out to meet those goals.  Well it did not take<br/>
&gt; &gt; long to see that my son hates learning from a book and doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; worksheets.  After many days of fighting I almost gave up.  Then I<br/>
&gt; &gt; remembered reading about unschooling.  So here I am.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now I don&#39;t know what I am suppose to do.  My son likes not having a<br/>
&gt; &gt; structued lesson every day but I don&#39;t feel like he&#39;s learning<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything.  I know I can teach him through everyday life but I am now<br/>
&gt; &gt; very confused as to what I should be teaching him at this age or how<br/>
&gt; &gt; to go about it.  I always felt that reading was the most important<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing.  He knows how to read but not very well.  I can&#39;t seem to find<br/>
&gt; &gt; an approach to further his skills.  One way I can get him to read is<br/>
&gt; &gt; having a treasure hunt however, I can not supply him with a new toy<br/>
&gt; &gt; every day so he will read.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any suggestions as to where to start or how to proceed would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; appreciated.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; Welcome to unschooling, Lorrie!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You will find your way as you go along.  Trial and error is a great teacher.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son didn&#39;t do much reading until age 9. But, we read to him constantly!<br/>
&gt; MOrning, noon and night, and in between.  Fiction, non-fiction, science<br/>
&gt; fiction, fantasy, etc.  He is now 11, and we still read to him, morning and<br/>
&gt; night.  We all love it! Usually my husband reads him one book, and I read<br/>
&gt; him another, and, now that he reads regularly, he reads another.  Sometimes<br/>
&gt; we even have a  fourth book going for family reading aloud time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We always read books on topics my son was interested in.  We use the<br/>
&gt; library heavily.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As a result of listening to all this reading aloud, his vocabulary is<br/>
&gt; fabulous and he has a great sense of proper grammar.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son started reading for pleasure by reading &quot;Calvin and Hobbes&quot; and<br/>
&gt; &quot;Garfield&quot; collections.  We have them all.  (I never anticipated spending<br/>
&gt; money on comic collections!)  He still likes to re-read them repeatedly at<br/>
&gt; bedtime.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How does you son learn?  Observe him and find out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My son absorbs info from PBS specials like NOVA.  Tonight he watched a<br/>
&gt; special on the Hindenbergh disaster, then came in and explained the whole<br/>
&gt; thing to us in detail.  I was impressed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; At age 7 my son loved to build with Legos, loved to pretend and tell me<br/>
&gt; stories about his pretend characters.  I think developing the imagination<br/>
&gt; is most important.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is a start.  Feel free to ask questions.  I look forward tocomments<br/>
&gt; from others.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I used to think, and periodically still think, that my son isn&#39;t learning<br/>
&gt; anything.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here is the cure:  Keep a daily journal or log or notes of what he does and<br/>
&gt; learns for a week or two.  That should show you how much learning is going on.<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone.  I just subbed to this list yesterday.  I am very<br/>
&gt; new to homeschooling, and don&#39;t really feel like I have a &quot;niche&quot;.<br/>
&gt; I probably have come to this in a different way from a lot of<br/>
&gt; people.  We have a son, almost 7, with a unique combination of<br/>
&gt; challenges and gifts.  We have tried to find the right placement for<br/>
&gt; him in school.  There isn&#39;t one.  He learns best on his own, in his own<br/>
&gt; time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>
&gt; he is learning.  Whenever he is under stress he acts out behaviorally,<br/>
&gt; and at school he does that a lot.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We were having so many problems that we met with the school and had<br/>
&gt; him officially switched to half days.  Things seemed to be better for<br/>
&gt; a while, and then he couldn&#39;t make the transition back to school<br/>
&gt; after spring break.  So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>
&gt; yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My head is spinning!  I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>
&gt; next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>
&gt; get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>
&gt; where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The<br/>
&gt; thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>
&gt; to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>
&gt; a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>
&gt; get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted territories,<br/>
&gt; and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So anyway, there are lots of issues.  I was not *planning* to do this,<br/>
&gt; but it became apparent to me that it was the only choice.  I need to<br/>
&gt; find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>
&gt; determination met.  And I need a peer group.  Or something.  I also<br/>
&gt; feel like an &quot;outsider&quot; among homeschoolers because I *do* hope that<br/>
&gt; my other child can go to school, as I hoped that my son would.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; just that I knew when it was time to take him out for the benefit<br/>
&gt; of everyone involved.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Rambling, I guess, but also hoping that someone can relate...<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m a SAHM from TX and I&#39;ve h-s&#39;d my dss (11/9) for 3 yrs ... we&#39;ve had a<br/>

&gt; ~&gt; *there&#39;s just gotta be a better way*!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; several wks ago, my sister sent me an newspaper article about an<br/>

&gt; I don&#39;t know the first thing about unschooling but I found the article to be<br/>
&gt; like a breath of fresh air; *SUCH A RELIEF*!!!   last night I was poking<br/>

&gt; Hi Renee!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Welcome to the list, and to homeschooling.  My name is Liz, and I just<br/>
&gt; started this myself as well.  I haven&#39;t even started teaching my kids yet,<br/>
&gt; that will take place next beginning in the fall.  However, I can fully<br/>
&gt; relate to you.  When a person decides to take that step to homeschool, they<br/>
&gt; ARE stepping into uncharted territory (at least for themselves).  I also<br/>
&gt; thought the same thing, that there was no &quot;welcoming&quot; committee....it would<br/>
&gt; have helped to have someone take me by the hand and &quot;show&quot; me what to do.<br/>
&gt; But, of course, there&#39;s no such thing.  However, I have found this email<br/>
&gt; list to be very beneficial, and things seem to be falling into place.  I get<br/>
&gt; bits and pieces of information to put together, but basically it&#39;s a &quot;figure<br/>
&gt; it out for yourself&quot; thing, because only you know what is best for your<br/>
&gt; individual child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have 4 children ages 4,5,10 and 12 that I will begin homeschooling next<br/>
&gt; year.  I have just decided that I&#39;ve had enough of school violence.  Also my<br/>
&gt; oldest son is ahead of his grade.  In the second grade, he could do algebra<br/>
&gt; in his head.  He is now in the sixth grade, and after 4 years of talking to<br/>
&gt; teachers (and others), I can&#39;t get anyone to advance and challenge him.  My<br/>
&gt; 5 year old is NOT ready for socialization with other kids.  She thinks<br/>
&gt; EVERYTHING should be her way.  So these are my reasons for deciding to<br/>
&gt; homeschool, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s the right choice for myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Try not to let it over-whelm you.  I&#39;ve been doing the same thing myself,<br/>
&gt; and I find it difficult to concentrate and put things together myself when I<br/>
&gt; stress out....I lose all focus, and make things worse.  And it&#39;s not that<br/>
&gt; bad at all.  If you need someone to talk to, feel free to contact me.  I<br/>
&gt; wish you all the best!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; I am new here too and this is my first year homeschooling.  My advice<br/>
&gt; to you is to relax.  You don&#39;t have to do this perfectly, or even<br/>
&gt; anyway that someone else thinks you should.  I just got done reading<br/>
&gt; the book the Relaxed Homeschool by Mary Hood.  It is excellent and<br/>
&gt; will help you not to panic.  Since it is so close to the end of the year, I<br/>
&gt; would jsut take the rest of the time to relax, read, play, read, and have<br/>
&gt; fun.  The part I like best about hs my girls is having gotten to know<br/>
&gt; them so much better than when they were in school.  Just spend time<br/>
&gt; together.  You might want to check out eh libraries and playgrounds<br/>
&gt; during the day to casually meet others who might be hsing.  You might<br/>
&gt; start seeing school age kids more than you realized.<br/>

&gt; &gt; time and way--which often involves climbing all over the place while<br/>
&gt; &gt; he is learning.  Whenever he is under stress he acts out behaviorally,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and at school he does that a lot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We were having so many problems that we met with the school and had<br/>
&gt; &gt; him officially switched to half days.  Things seemed to be better for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a while, and then he couldn&#39;t make the transition back to school<br/>
&gt; &gt; after spring break.  So actually we are not even officially homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet, we are on &quot;home instruction&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My head is spinning!  I went from thinking about maybe homeschooling him<br/>
&gt; &gt; next year, to having him home full time *now* without having time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get my bearings, develop a support network, etc.  I have found out<br/>
&gt; &gt; where the groups are and have attended a couple of meetings.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing is, when my son was starting school, it was somebody&#39;s *job*<br/>
&gt; &gt; to help me out, show me the ropes, etc.  Homeschooling by nature is<br/>
&gt; &gt; a lot of people doing their own thing for their own reasons, and they<br/>
&gt; &gt; get together and form friendships, plan activities, etc.  But there<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t seem to be a &quot;welcoming committee&quot;   I am not saying that people<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven&#39;t been nice, it is just a rough transition into uncharted territories,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I am really feeling &quot;on my own&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So anyway, there are lots of issues.  I was not *planning* to do this,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but it became apparent to me that it was the only choice.  I need to<br/>
&gt; &gt; find a way to do this and still get my own needs for solitude and self-<br/>
&gt; &gt; determination met.  And I need a peer group.  Or something.  I also<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel like an &quot;outsider&quot; among homeschoolers because I *do* hope that<br/>
&gt; &gt; my other child can go to school, as I hoped that my son would.  It&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; just that I knew when it was time to take him out for the benefit<br/>
&gt; &gt; of everyone involved.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Rambling, I guess, but also hoping that someone can relate...<br/>

&gt; &gt; ~&gt; *there&#39;s just gotta be a better way*!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; several wks ago, my sister sent me an newspaper article about an<br/>

&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know the first thing about unschooling but I found the article to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; like a breath of fresh air; *SUCH A RELIEF*!!!   last night I was poking<br/>

&gt; Hello, Susan.  Welcome to unschooling.  We live in Humboldt County, Eureka<br/>
&gt; to be exact.  Hwy 101 runs right through<br/>
&gt; the middle of town.    Speaking of wildlife, right now we have about a<br/>
&gt; half-dozen gray whales playing tourist in the bay.  Sometimes I think we<br/>
&gt; should write all the critters &quot;thank-you&quot; notes because of all the<br/>
&gt; unschooling adventures they have precipitated.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi Lynda, I enjoyed reading about all the animal and bird life near you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Where do you live? Sounds idyllic. I live in Santa Maria, CA now, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; used to live in Alaska where I saw lots of wonderful wildlife.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Take care,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1762669454">thanks for the welcome everyone ... I&#39;ve learned so much in the past day ...<br/>
thank you, thank you, thank you :)<br/>
<br/>
Tarla, it&#39;s funny you should mention Mary Hood&#39;s book b/c yesterday my<br/>
library b/g a search via interlib loan &lt;smiles&gt; ...  I sure hope they&#39;re<br/>
successful in locating this b/c I can&#39;t wait to get started reading it,<br/>
otherwise, I&#39;ll buy it from Barnes/Noble or Borders ...<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Did you read the article about the Fergeson family?   where in TX are you?<br/>
I&#39;m out in the West TX boonies - Levelland.  can&#39;t find any unschoolers in<br/>
the area  :-(  Mara &gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mara, we live outside San Antonio, in the *burbs* ...  I&#39;m native Txn but<br/>
I&#39;m not familiar w/ Levelland???  are you<br/>
near Abilene???, Lubbock???, Del Rio???, Marfa??? (naaaaahhhh, there&#39;z<br/>
nothing out Marfa way!!!  hehe)  ... SA has a # of traditional h-s groups<br/>
but I&#39;m not familiar w/ any unschoolers, so we&#39;re in the same boat as your<br/>
fm; going *solo* ... yes, my sis sent me the article about Holly Furgeson<br/>
(no relation, we spell our name correctly, haha) ... honestly, this article<br/>
*snagged* me (if that makes any sense) ... after reading it, I had such a<br/>
sense of *FREEDOM* simliar to the day I realized I could do a better job w/<br/>
my dss @ home than the ps system was doing; thanks for *nothing*... yes,<br/>
*freedom* is the only way I can describe the feeling ... NOW, to learn<br/>
exactly what *that* means is my new goal in life &lt;VBG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
lets see, wild critters???  nothing in south TX except for rattlesnakes!!!<br/>
*ACK* thankfully, I&#39;ve NEVER met up w/ any :}<br/>
<br/>
have a great day everyone ...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi everyone! I&#39;ve been lurking for a while, but thought it was time to <br/>
&gt;introduce myself. I am a full time mom, writer and web designer. We have <br/>
&gt;been learning with our kids at home for 6 years, and started unschooling <br/>
&gt;&quot;officially&quot; last year. So far, we love it, though sometimes I worry. It&#39;s <br/>
&gt;hard to let go and just trust that they will pursue their interests without <br/>
&gt;me leading them each step of the way. :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wanted to mention a website that some of you might find interesting. <br/>
&gt;It&#39;s a women&#39;s website, though a lot of men visit there as well. They have <br/>
&gt;lots of great info on just about every topic you can think of, but the best <br/>
&gt;part of the site is the discussion forums. They have several <br/>
&gt;&quot;homeschooling&quot; forums, as well as an unschooling forum.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Links are below:<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mrssurvival.com/">http://www.mrssurvival.com/</a><br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And a direct link to the discussion forums:<br/>

&gt;Date: Wed, 28 Jun 2000 17:08:12 PDT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello. My name is Cathie. I&#39;ve been lurking for almost 36 hours, and heres<br/>
&gt;my take on the current topics-quite a diverse and interesting group you <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;here!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I cannot stand Dr. Laura-can&#39;t defend my postition as I have never been <br/>
&gt;able<br/>
&gt;to listen to her for more than a few minutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do not spank, tried it when my kids were little, found it to be<br/>
&gt;ineffective. I have always gotten much better results from giving them some<br/>
&gt;extra individual attention and some hugging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been SAHM, full time working mom, worked part time, worked temporary<br/>
&gt;jobs. I have had my kids in public school, day care center(very briefly),<br/>
&gt;another womans home day care, and with sitters in my home. For a while my<br/>
&gt;husband was SAHD-although he couldn&#39;t take it for long! I cannot leave an<br/>
&gt;infant with a sitter or daycare, but I do not think it is so bad on a part<br/>
&gt;time basis for kids a bit older. Many of the kids like to go to a different<br/>
&gt;place to play, and to see the other kids, and with a secure base from us<br/>
&gt;attentive, bonded Moms and Dads they are free and confident to go off<br/>
&gt;without us for a time. For me, personally, working part time outside my <br/>
&gt;home<br/>
&gt;gives me time away, a schedule of my own that people have to pay attention<br/>
&gt;to, some actual real time adult contact, and money for a few of the things <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;need and some of the things I want. Including vices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I breast fed all 5 of my kids, although I had a rule that I would stop at<br/>
&gt;age 1 just so I wouldn&#39;t have a 5 year old pulling up my shirt later on. I<br/>
&gt;love coffee. And junk food.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After years of alienating people with a know-it-all attitude, I have <br/>
&gt;learned<br/>
&gt;that most people do not want to hear how I think they should live their<br/>
&gt;lives, so I give my opinion when it is asked for, offer my help if they <br/>
&gt;want<br/>
&gt;it, and leave it up to them. And try not to judge as I think narrow minded<br/>
&gt;judgemental people are the pits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also unschool 5 kids, ages 15, 13, 11, 9, and 3. I am convinced it is the<br/>
&gt;best way to learn, although as a product of public education it is me who<br/>
&gt;has had the hardest time de-schooling and I go through regular periods of<br/>
&gt;doubt where I think we should do school or they will never learn to spell <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;pass Jay Leno&#39;s Jaywalking segments. I am getting over these periods much<br/>
&gt;more quickly after 2 years, so now when I get the urge, I know to plan some<br/>
&gt;schooly type thing that will be done in an hour or two, cause by then I <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;be over it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My dd says this intro sounds angry-hope it doesn&#39;t come across that way to<br/>
&gt;all of you. I have had alot more fun writing this one than any other I have<br/>
&gt;ever done!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bright Blessings<br/>
&gt;Cathie<br/>

I thought your intro was, geez, I&#39;m brain dead tonight and descriptive<br/>
words have deserted me, kinda reflective of an upbeat personality, maybe???<br/>

It&#39;s definitely a diverse group here. Lots of thoughtful posts/threads,<br/>
some good  * valid  &quot;philosophical&quot; arguements/heated discussion *<br/>

&gt;Date: Wed, 28 Jun 2000 17:08:12 PDT<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hello. My name is Cathie. I&#39;ve been lurking for almost 36 hours, and heres<br/>
&gt;my take on the current topics-quite a diverse and interesting group you <br/>
&gt;have<br/>
&gt;here!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I cannot stand Dr. Laura-can&#39;t defend my postition as I have never been <br/>
&gt;able<br/>
&gt;to listen to her for more than a few minutes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I do not spank, tried it when my kids were little, found it to be<br/>
&gt;ineffective. I have always gotten much better results from giving them some<br/>
&gt;extra individual attention and some hugging.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have been SAHM, full time working mom, worked part time, worked temporary<br/>
&gt;jobs. I have had my kids in public school, day care center(very briefly),<br/>
&gt;another womans home day care, and with sitters in my home. For a while my<br/>
&gt;husband was SAHD-although he couldn&#39;t take it for long! I cannot leave an<br/>
&gt;infant with a sitter or daycare, but I do not think it is so bad on a part<br/>
&gt;time basis for kids a bit older. Many of the kids like to go to a different<br/>
&gt;place to play, and to see the other kids, and with a secure base from us<br/>
&gt;attentive, bonded Moms and Dads they are free and confident to go off<br/>
&gt;without us for a time. For me, personally, working part time outside my <br/>
&gt;home<br/>
&gt;gives me time away, a schedule of my own that people have to pay attention<br/>
&gt;to, some actual real time adult contact, and money for a few of the things <br/>
&gt;I<br/>
&gt;need and some of the things I want. Including vices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I breast fed all 5 of my kids, although I had a rule that I would stop at<br/>
&gt;age 1 just so I wouldn&#39;t have a 5 year old pulling up my shirt later on. I<br/>
&gt;love coffee. And junk food.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After years of alienating people with a know-it-all attitude, I have <br/>
&gt;learned<br/>
&gt;that most people do not want to hear how I think they should live their<br/>
&gt;lives, so I give my opinion when it is asked for, offer my help if they <br/>
&gt;want<br/>
&gt;it, and leave it up to them. And try not to judge as I think narrow minded<br/>
&gt;judgemental people are the pits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I also unschool 5 kids, ages 15, 13, 11, 9, and 3. I am convinced it is the<br/>
&gt;best way to learn, although as a product of public education it is me who<br/>
&gt;has had the hardest time de-schooling and I go through regular periods of<br/>
&gt;doubt where I think we should do school or they will never learn to spell <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;pass Jay Leno&#39;s Jaywalking segments. I am getting over these periods much<br/>
&gt;more quickly after 2 years, so now when I get the urge, I know to plan some<br/>
&gt;schooly type thing that will be done in an hour or two, cause by then I <br/>
&gt;will<br/>
&gt;be over it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My dd says this intro sounds angry-hope it doesn&#39;t come across that way to<br/>
&gt;all of you. I have had alot more fun writing this one than any other I have<br/>
&gt;ever done!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Bright Blessings<br/>
&gt;Cathie<br/>

     I thought I&#39;d add my voice of welcome.  I also unschool 5 kids, pretty <br/>
