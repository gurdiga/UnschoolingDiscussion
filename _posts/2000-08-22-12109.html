<div id="ygrps-yiv-587017007">Hey guys.<br/>
<br/>
My son, Monk, has lately been very interested in how things are spelled.<br/>
His new thing is to point into the air and say stuff like &quot;yrdq...that<br/>
spells DOG!&quot; And right now he is putting his magnetic letters on the<br/>
floor and saying &quot;That spells GO!&quot; and the letters ar like &quot;yao&quot; or<br/>
something. He knows all of his letters, but he doesn&#39;t know how to spell<br/>
yet. My question for the group is how to approach this. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
correct him, because I feel that might be discouraging, but I&#39;m afraid<br/>
if I let him continue to spell things wrong, he will think he&#39;s right.<br/>
What would you do?<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go...he just spelled the word &quot;Chair&quot; (antyooohtrszgh...that<br/>
spells CHAIR!)<br/>
<br/>
OH, another thing is that he reads the words backwords. Like when he<br/>
sees a sign, he reads the letters backwards. For instance, riding in the<br/>
cart at Target, he spelled &quot;TEGRAT...what does that spell, mama?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Should I just relax and let him do his thing? argh!<br/>
