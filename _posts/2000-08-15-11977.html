<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">&quot;Ironically, mice, gerbils, hamsters and guinea 
pigs are<br>perfectly acceptable.&nbsp; A shame, since they all of them, (with 
the<br>exception of g.p.&#39;s), bite far more often then rats and are not nearly 
as<br>smart or lovable toward their human owners.&quot;</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Just a word of caution. . . . don&#39;t be too lured by 
guinea pigs either, if you are looking for a cuddly-type pet.&nbsp; Our guinea 
pig bites and he bites *hard*.&nbsp; I belong to a guinea pig mailing list as 
well and judging from the responses I&#39;ve gotten, biting piggies are not the 
exception but the rule.&nbsp; &quot;Todd&quot; is sweet (we&#39;re a BIG animal-loving family 
here) but he&#39;s a lot of work. . . . completely washing the cage weekly (or the 
smell is atrocious!!), scooping out the &quot;soiling&quot; from the litter-stuff at the 
bottom of his cage every day (or the smell is atrocious!!. . .plus piggies can 
get liver damage if they have to smell the ammonia in their own urine all the 
time), making sure we have fresh veggies in the house because they&#39;re so 
necessary for him, making sure we have the vitamins to put in his drinking water 
too (g.pigs don&#39;t have any other source of vitamin C other than what they get in 
their water and fresh veggies, so to prevent scurvy you&#39;ve got to do the soluble 
vitamin stuff plus the veggies), making sure he has something to naw on all the 
time in order to keep his teeth worn down (they have teeth like rabbits, that 
become overgrown if not nawed down and then they are unable to eat), making sure 
his nails are trimmed. . . . .I mean, the list goes on and on.&nbsp; There&#39;s a 
whole lot of work and not a whole lot of reward with owning a pet guinea 
pig!!&nbsp; Of course, that&#39;s just my opinion!&nbsp; :-)</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">As with *any* pet you are contemplating getting, 
get on a mailing list dedicated to that pet and hang-out for awhile.&nbsp; Be 
sure you understand everything you&#39;re getting into *before* you get into 
it.&nbsp; Lots better for everything and everybody concerned that 
way.</font></div>
