<div id="ygrps-yiv-661867738">My apologies to anyone that gets this in multiples...I&#39;m seeking first hand <br/>
info quickly, so sending this message to more than one list.<br/>
<br/>
DH is applying for 3 jobs in Alaska.   (We NEED a job, I might add...almost a <br/>
year of earnestly seeking employment is getting old!)  One job is on Cook <br/>
Inlet, the other two are rotational on the north slope.  I anticipate that <br/>
both north slope jobs would have him going alone and flying home during time <br/>
off.  Having never been there or done this sort of thing, I&#39;d be interested <br/>
if anyone has info on whether that is typically how things are done and if so <br/>
(or not) any suggestions on what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the homeschool laws are quite favorable in AK.  We&#39;ve wanted to <br/>
move there for over 20 years and it appears to be a real possibility this <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
What can you tell me about actual living conditions?  What to look out for <br/>
and what to look forward to? <br/>
<br/>
I have a medical condition...FMS (fibromyalgia syndrome).  If anyone has <br/>
first hand experience on how living in very cold weather affects them or <br/>
someone they know with FMS, that would be very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Cost of living...I understand is high...?  Is housing hard to find?  I would <br/>
assume homes are pretty well insulated against the cold?  We would have to <br/>
rent, if that makes any difference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are zillions of questions I should ask, but beyond these, I <br/>
don&#39;t know where to start!  so, any information is helpful.<br/>
<br/>
TIA<br/>
