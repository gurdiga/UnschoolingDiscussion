<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240011721">We just watched Princess Bride on a really big screen yesterday.  Our<br/>
Homeschool group put on a production of Midsummer Night&#39;s Dream. The cast<br/>
was composed of  over 40 kids ages 5-17...in between shows we needed<br/>
something to keep everyone somewhat calm and contained and entertained.  The<br/>
church we did the show in has a big screen with a set-up for movies. What<br/>
was really funny was over half of the kids were reciting the movie word for<br/>
word during the whole thing. Great fun!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853308260">My partner and I are not married (well, not really--only in the eyes of <br/>
the state &lt;smile&gt;), but we talk about it sometimes. I always say, <br/>
whatever vows we come up with have to include him hissing, &quot;Skip to the <br/>
end! Skip to the end!&quot; I would love to really do it.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have such severe environmental sensitivities that I would <br/>
sometimes wear a mask at big group gatherings like conferences, to <br/>
protect myself from perfume and scented grooming products. When I got <br/>
tired of explaining why I was wearing it, if someone asked I would say, <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s just that they&#39;re so terribly comfortable. I think everyone will <br/>
be wearing them in the future.&quot; If the person got the joke, I knew i <br/>
had a new friend.<br/>
<br/>
The Princess Bride--is there anything it can&#39;t do?<br/>
