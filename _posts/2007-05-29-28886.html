  I don&#39;t know that attachment parenting is any different with an only child (I only had one, so that&#39;s my experience), but The BEST book I read on the subject was, The Continuum Concept by Jean Liedloff.  There may be newer books on the subject that I haven&#39;t come across though. My dd&#39;s now 12 (almost 13 already!) so haven&#39;t read anything pertaining to small ones lately.<br/>

My kids are really far apart in age, so I was a parent to an only child <br/>
for a lot of years.  The only difference that I can really see is that <br/>
your time as a mom is divided between 2 instead of 1.  There are easier <br/>
and more difficult things about both.  However the things that are/were <br/>
most difficult for me are still the same being a parent of more than <br/>
one because of the age difference.  That would be being your child&#39;s <br/>
playmate.  That&#39;s just me, my dh has no problem at all being a playmate <br/>
to his kids!  I&#39;m very good at other mom things, just not real good at <br/>
playing barbies!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240792703">Both Jan Hunt of Natural Child and Scott Noelle of Enjoy Parenting <br/>
are featured in my free Guiding Stars of the New Parenting Movement e-<br/>
books, if anybody here is interested in having a read of them. Not <br/>
strictly unschooling, but in the neighbourhood of that ballpark. Two <br/>
of the founders of the Alliance for Transforming the Lives of <br/>
Children that I mentioned are featured in Volume 2.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the direct links:<br/>
