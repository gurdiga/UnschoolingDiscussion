Hey Audrey, try not to worry. Writing is a small motor skill. Casey has <br/>
always been a small motor skill kind of gal. She also likes to work with <br/>
those teeny tiny seed beads, so small you use a needle to pick them up. <br/>
That&#39;s just her. Writing has been a joy for her and so she&#39;s used it, <br/>
practiced it and played with it. Like I said, it looks very schooly even <br/>
though I never pushed schooly thought on her.<br/>
<br/>
My son Conor is 13 now and still hates the physical act of writing. He can <br/>
tell stories, play online games and type slowly, but writing just tires his <br/>
hands. I often wonder if he avoids it so much because it was forced on him <br/>
so young when he was still in school. :-/ I think lots of kids, boys <br/>
especially, come to writing later rather than sooner. Playing, using those <br/>
big muscle groups, are what these kids need to be doing. When they have a <br/>
need to begin writing, it will be so much easier to help them when they&#39;re a <br/>
little older and not so intimidated by those small motor skills.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
