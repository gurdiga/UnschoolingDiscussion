Bobby Norfolk is popular here...he&#39;s so dang funny. Kids love his zany way of <br/>
storytelling. His wife Sherry is also good.<br/>
Check out the National Storytelling Festival site for more incredible <br/>
storytellers, all of which sell tapes.<br/>
This link will take you to a listing of storytellers that have been popular <br/>
at the yearly Festival (which is an incredible event).<br/>
I highly recommend Donald Davis and Bill Harley. Don tells real life stories <br/>
of his life and has a calm way of telling. Bill is hilarious and goofy, does <br/>
a lot of singing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Jay O&#39;Callahan.  He&#39;s a wonderful storyteller.  All his stories are<br/>
original, and most are hilarious.  He often uses strong female characters.<br/>
He has one tape that&#39;s more for adults.  It&#39;s the one with The Herring Shed<br/>
on it.  The others are all meant for kids, but we all love them.  He reminds<br/>
me a little bit of Robin Williams, but not quite so frenetic.<br/>
<br/>
There are also lots of great children&#39;s novels available on tape.  I get<br/>
them for myself (because I love kid lit) and listen to them in the car.<br/>
Some recent faves were:<br/>
<br/>
Thunder Cave -  about a 14 year old boy whose mother dies and his<br/>
step-father doesn&#39;t want him.  He travels to Kenya with his mountain bike to<br/>
look for his father, a field biologist.  Great adventure.<br/>
<br/>
Shiva&#39;s Dance - about a girl in the south of India, who is chosen to study<br/>
dance as a spiritual practice<br/>
<br/>
A Girl Named Disaster - about a girl in Africa who runs off after being<br/>
promised in marriage to an old creep to propitiate the spirit of the man her<br/>
father killed before she was born.<br/>
