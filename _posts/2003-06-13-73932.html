<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091803825">The kids (son 14, daughter 11), hubby and I are off to Baltimore this <br/>
coming Tuesday, the 17th to attend a Games Day at the Convention Center in <br/>
Baltimore.  My son is into Warhammer 40,000.  We expect to be there until <br/>
the following Tuesday, the 24th.  While there, I&#39;m planning on doing a day <br/>
in Annapolis and the rest of the time around the city.  If anyone on the <br/>
list has been to the Baltimore area and has any recommendations as to what <br/>
they really, really enjoyed seeing or doing, I would appreciate hearing <br/>
it!  Especially anything out of the ordinary...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
