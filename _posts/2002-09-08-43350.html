always bought things and then stashed them until a holiday.  But if the<br/>
toy/tool/whatever was important in October, it might not be in December.<br/>
She had that problem several times with us as kids.<br/>
<br/>
It also makes the holidays more fun.  Christmas becomes about the religious<br/>
part, which is important to us, and about giving to other people.  We make<br/>
gifts, when possible, which is a lot of fun for us.  Birthdays become a<br/>
celebration of family and/or friends, having fun together and being the<br/>
center of attention.  We still give gifts, but on a much, much smaller<br/>
scale.  It&#39;s not for everybody, perhaps, but we like it.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah!  We had a good example here, last night, about how being sweet to<br/>
kids makes them sweeter, not rotten.<br/>
<br/>
My son and I had had a pretty horrible day, with lots of driving in the<br/>
storm.  It was so awful and getting so close to sunset that I kept<br/>
putting off and putting off the stop at McDonald&#39;s I had promised him. <br/>
Any way, we had had some stress about food during the day, and I<br/>
explained and apologized, but didn&#39;t give my son what he wanted. (at<br/>
that time)<br/>
<br/>
At 9:55pm, as I turned off Buffy and was getting ready to go to bed, my<br/>
son told me he was hungry.  Fortunately he wanted something simple, soup<br/>
from a can.  Unfortunately some of the carrots exploded in the microwave<br/>
and when he saw the soup he said it looked yucky.  We brainstormed a bit<br/>
about him eating the soup in the dark or with his eyes closed so he<br/>
couldn&#39;t judge it by its appearance, but that didn&#39;t seem feasible. <br/>
(Danger of hot soup spills.)  I put extra effort into the problem<br/>
solving because I had our discussions here in mind.  I ended up spoon<br/>
feeding him while he kept his eyes shut.  (Moms who are opposed to<br/>
&quot;indulgence&quot; might as well let out a shriek and stop reading right here.)<br/>
<br/>
We had a really nice time.  My son really appreciated that I solved his<br/>
problem without huffing.  By about the fourth spoonful he said &quot;thanks,<br/>
mom&quot; and by the eighth, or so, &quot;I love you.&quot;  He only ate about 12<br/>
spoonfuls; it wasn&#39;t a big drain on my time.  At bedtime he was still<br/>
feeling appreciative and said &quot;You&#39;re the best mama a boy could have.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now those who feel that deprivation builds character are free to sniff<br/>
at this story.  But it works for me.<br/>
<br/>
And I want to take a minute to say &quot;thanks&quot; to the &quot;best email list a<br/>
girl could have.&quot;  I wouldn&#39;t have done it without you.<br/>

&gt;Its pretty funny to watch my kids&#39; faces when I do things like that because <br/>

&gt;It happened just yesterday with the rides at the mall,   pre-unschooling <br/>
&gt;time when we would walk by the rides I would be the parent saying no, we <br/>
&gt;don&#39;t need to do that,   yesterday Kyra, 5dd,  her little face was so <br/>
&gt;excited when she saw them and she asked to ride the horse.   I&#39;m thinking,  <br/>
&gt;a big 25 cents,  sure you can.   I swear I saw her clean out her ears!&lt;g&gt;   <br/>
&gt;    I can&#39;t believe that I would even think any other way.<br/>
