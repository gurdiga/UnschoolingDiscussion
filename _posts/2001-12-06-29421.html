&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;You know, I was going to let this go but then I<br/>
had a thought and it is nagging away . . . <br/>
<br/>
How is it that telling me I sound condescending and<br/>
patronizing is okay and just a comment on my posts but<br/>
when I said Sandra was coming across in very negative<br/>
way that was a personal insult to Sandra?<br/>
<br/>
You really can&#39;t have it both ways.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m disgusted and disappointed. I can&#39;t even believe<br/>
that your &#39;Sandra issue&#39; came up yet again. I am so<br/>
tired of waiting for this to blow over. There has<br/>
become way too much negativity and defensiveness here<br/>
for my tastes. It has reached the point of<br/>
interferring with getting and sharing unschooling<br/>
information for me. I&#39;m done. Goodbye.<br/>
