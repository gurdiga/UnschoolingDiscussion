<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749372901">Why be conflicted about the whole Santa thing? Yes, Santa may very well be a<br/>
fantasy character, a man much like Superman, Batman or Spiderman in our<br/>
fantasy world..... but if you can look behind the man into what he<br/>
represents in the eyes of children and in my eyes, you will find  something<br/>
much more real.<br/>
<br/>
To me, I love Santa. I loved Santa even when I found out he was not &quot;real&quot;.<br/>
I was not disappointed or hurt by what appeared to be my parents &quot;lies&quot;,<br/>
because I never interpreted them as &quot;lies&quot;. The only thing I was upset about<br/>
was the fact that my mother used the same wrapping paper and tags for the<br/>
presents she and my dad gave, as she did the ones from Santa. I think my<br/>
reasoning there was one of that if she was going to have made such strides<br/>
to have the gifts be from two different sets of people without us knowing it<br/>
 why use the same paper then? :)<br/>
<br/>
So, why was I not hurt or disappointed about discovering that the physical<br/>
person of Santa was being portrayed by my parents? Because for me, Santa is<br/>
and always has been since as far back as I can remember, been the belief in<br/>
what is possible. Santa is not so much of a HE but rather a what is. It is a<br/>
knowing that although we cannot always see something - faith, hope, love,<br/>
magic, fate, miracles, what can be, possibility....... we can still believe.<br/>
We can still believe in what can be, in life, no matter what logic may tell<br/>
us. <br/>
<br/>
Do we believe in love and the power of love to go beyond what we humans can<br/>
see and reason? You bet we do, and we believe in it so strongly that<br/>
sometimes it can make us blind to what is real. But we believe in it<br/>
nonetheless, and it is not something real in the sense of something we can<br/>
feel, touch, smell, taste or hear....but we believe, we believe in it&#39;s<br/>
power and in it&#39;s strength and in the essence of knowing it is what brings<br/>
us all together, no matter what race, no matter what (fill in the blank)....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Santa may not be real in the sense of we cannot feel, touch, smell, taste or<br/>
hear him BUT we can believe in what he is in our hearts - a sense of<br/>
innocence, a sense of awe and wonder at life and of life and in life. We can<br/>
believe in that all things are possible and that life is the miracle that it<br/>
is because we choose to see it for the miracle that it is. Santa is so much<br/>
more than just someone who brings children presents on Christmas while we<br/>
all go to sleep. It is a belief of something that is beyond what we can use<br/>
our five senses to see, materialize and realize - the magic of what is<br/>
possible in life beyond any reason or explanation, it just is..... and the<br/>
spirit in which that can happen, that needs to be felt and seen here. Seeing<br/>
is not believing, believing is seeing!<br/>
<br/>
That is who Santa is to me. Do I believe in Santa? You bet I do and I will<br/>
always believe in him until I draw my last breath! Do my kids believe? They<br/>
are 13, 7, (almost 8, next month) and 6 and you bet they do! :) They will<br/>
not feel betrayed when they learn of the truth that I am the one who gives<br/>
them the presents under the tree and in their stockings, instead of a<br/>
physical man who wears a red suit, because they know of what Santa truly is<br/>
in all of which I have written here and more, beyond what our minds can<br/>
reason. And THAT is what will be keep Santa alive in their hearts and keep<br/>
them believing in Santa, not for the figure of the man he is, but for what<br/>
he is and can be within their hearts.<br/>

What you wrote was beautiful and also the theme behind &quot;yes Virginia, there<br/>
is a Santa Claus&quot;, which I love and plan to share with my children at some<br/>
point.  <br/>
 <br/>
I also wanted to mention that the cousin I mentioned who felt so betrayed by<br/>
her parents also had a LOT of other issues with regards to her parent&#39;s<br/>
parenting.  So, it&#39;s not like the Santa issue was the only thing she was<br/>
lied to about.  There was both physical and mental abuse to go with it.  <br/>

I have friends who were terribly bothered by their parent&#39;s<br/>
&#39;lies&#39; about Santa.  But, then again, lots of things about their upbringing<br/>
bother them.<br/>
