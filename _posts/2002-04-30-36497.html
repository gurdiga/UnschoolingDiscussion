<div id="ygrps-yiv-131278018">Julian is now eating another bowl of ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
It is 10:57 p.m. in the Star City, and he is eating ice cream out of a <br/>
measuring spoon (&#39;cuz that&#39;s what he wanted to do).<br/>
<br/>
And the world has not yet caved in.<br/>
<br/>
And I have not rejected any ideas out of hand.<br/>
