<div id="ygrps-yiv-1839110950">maybe instead of looking to others for the info,you could take a leap of <br/>
faith (based on the fact that it is something your interested in) and try it <br/>
on your own for a year. if you decide that it isn&#39;t working,then you only <br/>
have one year worth of &quot;work&quot; to catch up on. no one here can show you how <br/>
great it is or how well it will work for you.<br/>
<br/>
when i decided to homeschool my dd, i had no idea where to start. i spent <br/>
the first year reading everything i could. then i joined a hs group and went <br/>
out to meet people. when i met the people i liked and i liked the way they <br/>
interacted with their children, then i &quot;studied&quot; them. i asked questions <br/>
about their lives. it turned out that all of the people i was drawn to were <br/>
very relaxed or unschoolers (at the time i didn&#39;t know that term). i set <br/>
goals for myself to get rid of the things in my life that felt negative or <br/>
weren&#39;t working for the family as a whole. it was a bigger learning process <br/>
for me than for my dd (even a little bigger for dh). when the process was <br/>
well under way (never complete imo) unschooling was what we were doing.<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t need other peoples stories for proof (just for enjoyment or further <br/>
learning).<br/>
i have built my own.<br/>
when i find out i am wrong or something isn&#39;t working, i change it and <br/>
apoligize if necessary. i only look to others for advice when my journey is <br/>
stuck and i know that i don&#39;t want to do &quot;this&quot; but i&#39;m not sure what else <br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
you could start today and evaluate as you go along. i don&#39;t think anyone <br/>
here ever stops thinking about what they are doing and how it is affecting <br/>
others (that&#39;s why they are here). i don&#39;t think anyone here just says &quot;i&#39;ll <br/>
do anything i want today and the hell with the consequences.&quot;<br/>
things are thought out and my choice is to do something different because i <br/>
believe that it is a better way to live.<br/>
<br/>

who has taken many leaps of faith since having my dd and has never regretted <br/>
any of them.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s where the edge blurs, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
And I don&#39;t mind that a bit, for myself, as we were doing attachment <br/>
parenting, child-led weaning, children falling asleep in parents&#39; arms or laps or on <br/>
the floor near them, or in bed with them--all that before we thought about <br/>
homeschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
So when I showed up on Prodigy and later AOL and people asked why it was <br/>
working so well for us, those factors were a real part of it at our house.  Why <br/>
did my kids trust me?  Why did I trust my kids&#39; abilities?  We had years of <br/>
trust building and confidence making before we thought &quot;Oh! Kirby might do better <br/>
just staying home.&quot;<br/>

Nice, Velvet.<br/>
<br/>
People with a better 18 years behind them are bound to have a more glorious <br/>
year #19 than those who have had 18 years of just getting more and more <br/>
frustrated, ignored, and finally shoved out.   Two families I know said &quot;When you&#39;re <br/>
18 you&#39;re out.&quot;  One boy is working right where Marty is working (he&#39;s 18, <br/>
Marty is 15, and I honestly don&#39;t think the other boy will last there because <br/>
he&#39;s not soft and happy, as Marty is; he has no gratitude, just resentments; he&#39;s <br/>
not glad to be learning).  The other boy is in air force basic training.  He <br/>
will be paid to become a man, and his mom can check it off her list. <br/>
<br/>
I think there is a better way to live.<br/>
