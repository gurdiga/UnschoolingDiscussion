2 1/2, I have a little time to make decisions on these matters, but would like 
to begin researching now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am interested in hearing from others on 
the one or two best /beginning books any of you would recommend on the 
subject.&nbsp; I am very attracted to&nbsp; the unschooling philosophy.&nbsp; 
Thank-you very much for any advice here.</font></div>
