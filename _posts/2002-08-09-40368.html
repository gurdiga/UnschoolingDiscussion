<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ned responds: (thank you, Tia, for agreeing, in part at least)...<br/>
Before 1840, there was no government school system. Homeschooling, by<br/>
various names, was the norm. Almost all parents accepted the responsibility<br/>
for their children&#39;s basic education. Local schools were open only a few<br/>
months per year. Hey, there was real life to live back then -- food to grow<br/>
and put up for the winter, hunting to do, livestock to care for, crops to<br/>
plant, tools and clothes to make, etc. -- the unschool life )  Children,<br/>
generally, got their learnin&#39; at home and in their communities. (that&#39;s<br/>
still true...one recent book, &quot;School&#39;s Out,&quot; by the past head of IBM) said<br/>
that of all adults know, less than one percent was learned in school)<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, during the 150 years since the beginning of the national system<br/>
of schools, this country has gone from Zero percent of the children going to<br/>
such schools to about 92 percent of our children attending them today. I&#39;d<br/>
say that is overwhelming success -- almost total elimination of the practice<br/>
of homeschooling, in fact. The government has done an incredible job of<br/>
removing the responsibilities of raising children from families and<br/>
communities, and has given the job to its own employees.<br/>
<br/>
In every state, the public schools are on the lookout for ways to increase<br/>
their control over those who seek or use alternatives. What I&#39;ve been saying<br/>
is that we need to be more than vigilant. We need to look for ways to regain<br/>
all the educational freedoms that the government and its agencies have taken<br/>
away from us.<br/>

paranoid.  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve lost any educational freedom, at least not <br/>
where I live.  Here in BC, the schools only get money for the kids that are <br/>
enrolled, and those are the only ones they&#39;re responsible for.  Getting <br/>
more kids into the public school just means more money to spend, etc.  I <br/>
don&#39;t see where getting any more kids is going to do them any good.  At any <br/>
rate, aside from the occasional spouting off by somebody in the teacher&#39;s <br/>
union, nobody here appears to be trying to drag homeschoolers into the <br/>
schools.<br/>

Not even a little.<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard anyone afraid of the NEA.<br/>

&lt;&lt;The concept of Unschooling IS the natural opposite of school. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So let&#39;s talk about the light, not the dark.<br/>
<br/>
Vegetarian lists don&#39;t go on and on about meat and butchers and processing <br/>
plants and that.  New vegetarians go through their revulsion phase and their <br/>
justification phase, and then they want current information and encouragement <br/>
and recipes and ideas.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps some feel that if we openly <br/>
criticize schools and it&#39;s supporters such as the government, NEA, and PTO, <br/>
that the unschoolers way of life might be regulated out of existence.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard that idea ever until now.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re DOING something, not just not-doing something else.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot of work involved with unschooling once the school is <br/>
abandoned.  If we carry school around with us we won&#39;t have the lightness and <br/>
joy we need to unschool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have found that to be true. Since I have been leaning more and more <br/>
towards unschooling(I am not there completely yet), I have found it <br/>
takes more effort on my part. Before, I could just give my kids text <br/>
books and tell them to do the assignments and come to me if they <br/>
needed help. Now, I have to pay attention to what they are doing and <br/>
look things up with them rather than just tell them to look things up <br/>
when they have questions. It is more work to enrich a child&#39;s <br/>
environment than it is to simply give him some books, &quot;teach&quot; him for <br/>
a little while, and then have the child do the work in the books by <br/>
himself. Now instead of waiting for my child to ask me questions, I <br/>
ask my child questions. Definately more work. I have to think more.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. One thing that has been easier with my child since I <br/>
quit &quot;schooling&quot; him so much is spelling. My youngest used to be a <br/>
terrible speller. I used to give him spelling assignments and drills, <br/>
etc. He hated it, and didn&#39;t improve much. Now he likes to frequent <br/>
Harry Potter message boards. Other people on the boards criticized <br/>
his bad spelling, so he has become a very good speller. He usually <br/>
will find out on his own how something is spelled, but sometimes he <br/>
asks me or his father. We ask him how he thinks it is spelled. He <br/>
usually has it right. When he really doesn&#39;t know, we will tell him, <br/>
and he usually doesn&#39;t need to ask again.</div>

<br/>

integrity. Opinions stated as facts and left unchallenged compromise that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think some here are attempting to sensor valid opinions.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To someone who agrees with Ned&#39;s particular brand of Libertarianism his<br/>

To someone who doesn&#39;t agree there&#39;s a huge gap between his &quot;evidence&quot; and<br/>

would clog up the list to the point of uselessness. (I suspect he believes<br/>
he has supported his opinions. But from my point of view I see some facts<br/>
and then wild, flying-leap conclusions.)<br/>
<br/>
Since people signed on trusting that this list was about unschooling, it<br/>
would be helpful for list members if this discussion moved to a list<br/>
specifically for politics and schooling. (There might already be one at<br/>

and political drivel.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The concept of Unschooling<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So why even discuss schooling here?<br/>
<br/>
(Unless someone wants to relate personal stories about their experiences or<br/>
their kids&#39; experiences in the context of discussing unschooling. That&#39;s<br/>
always okay.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Perhaps some feel that if we openly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is to laugh! HA!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been warning people for a long time not to trust what school officials<br/>
say about homeschooling and that the only information they should trust<br/>
about homeschooling legal issues is what&#39;s written in their state laws. (Ned<br/>
and I obviously have very different ideas about *why* you shouldn&#39;t trust<br/>
school officials to give out accurate homeschooling information.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been telling people why schools and teachers will claim the total<br/>
opposite of what unschoolers will say about children and learning. (And it<br/>
has *nothing* to do with protecting their paychecks and *everything* to do<br/>
with being concerned about kids and truly believing that school and learning<br/>
go hand in hand. Which matches every teacher I&#39;ve ever known. I don&#39;t know<br/>

majority of the teachers I&#39;ve run into *do* care and *do* believe that <br/>
their take on education is beneficial to the kids.  That same vast majority <br/>
is also ineffective in educating kids, but then we know that.  I&#39;ve run <br/>
into a very small percentage of teachers who are really good and helpful to <br/>
kids, and a similar percentage who are really awful and damaging to kids.<br/>
The reason my son isn&#39;t in school is not because of some vast government <br/>
plot to control my child&#39;s life.  It&#39;s simply because the system of <br/>
education we have here just isn&#39;t effective at producing adults who know <br/>
how to learn and think for themselves.  It isn&#39;t flexible enough to work <br/>
well for most kids.  And, not being part of the real world, it doesn&#39;t <br/>
prepare them very well for the real world.<br/>
