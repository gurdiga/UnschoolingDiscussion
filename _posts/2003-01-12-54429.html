&lt;&lt; People run their houses differently....... I will not defend that to <br/>
anyone. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most people send their kids to school.  you don&#39;t need to defend that either. <br/>
 But it is not at all uncommon for unschoolers to discover that gradually <br/>
they trust their children more and more and as they treat them more like <br/>
equal humans, the relationship changes.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t happen with every family, but it has happened with lots.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Chores are a way and fact of life for many people. If you personally chose <br/>
not to have you children do their chores or responsibilty..then that is your <br/>
choice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  It&#39;s people&#39;s choices and they&#39;re trying to explain how they came to <br/>
believe as they believe.  It has directly to do with unschooling and the <br/>
changes it brought into their lives.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need to explain to us why you believe as you do about chores.  Most <br/>
of us grew up in families where there were chores.  Many families here still <br/>
have chores.  Many used to and don&#39;t now.  You *might* want to read why <br/>
people changed, when they did, since that way will be new to you but the <br/>
traditional way isn&#39;t new to us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not because people never heard of chores that they&#39;ve chosen not to make <br/>
their children do some.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He would not appreciate working hard on the road for 6 days and see no <br/>
dishes <br/>
washed, counters nasty greasy and the stove filthy, clothes thrown about the <br/>
house , or the house looking like a tornado with through it. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even when I was laid up for over a month, my house never looked like a <br/>
tornado went through it.  Clothes are not thrown about the house here, but it <br/>
is nobody&#39;s singular job to do the laundry; yet laundry gets done.  Each <br/>
child has a pile, and there&#39;s a pile by the washer.  My stove is really <br/>
pretty clean, because that&#39;s my favorite bit of cleaning.  I&#39;d do anyone&#39;s <br/>
oven if they would mop my kitchen floor.  But the floor&#39;s been mopped this <br/>
week too.<br/>
<br/>
How could that happen without a mother forcing chores?<br/>
<br/>
It can.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What will happen to your chldren if they don&#39;t?<br/>
&lt;&lt;That is private...... but it is dealt with, but we rarely have too. They <br/>
know <br/>
that they have to pull their weight around here.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would ask &quot;they know they have to pull their weight or what?&quot; but you&#39;ve <br/>
said you don&#39;t want to discuss it.<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways to be together in a family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343088883">The whole idea of people having to do chores doesn&#39;t seem right to me. We <br/>
really don&#39;t have to. We chose to or not. Kids don&#39;t have to do chores <br/>
unless their parents make them. They would chose not to unless they learn at <br/>
an age comfortable for them why people do chose to do them that have a <br/>
choice. Then I belive they would make the choice to do what feels right for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I never had to do chores and I am now a very neat and organized person. When <br/>
I was first away from home at school, I saw tons of girls that were complete <br/>
slobs. Most of them complained that they had so many chores at home, they <br/>
wre taking advantage of not having to do any now. Now I doubt very much that <br/>
most of those girls had &quot;tons&quot; of chores, but for them it probably seemed <br/>
that way as they had no choice. Makes you wonder what happens to those <br/>
people when no one is around to see.<br/>
<br/>
And for some parents who say they don&#39;t care after their children move away <br/>
what they do with their own homes, I would think they should care. I care <br/>
about what my kids choices are when they leave this house. I may not have <br/>
any say so in it, but I still care and want them to be responsible.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of goes along with not being exposed to certain things as children and <br/>
then going wild later on. I was never exposed to swearing or nudity at all. <br/>
I couldn&#39;t wait to say fuck when I got older and wasn&#39;t afraid of getting <br/>
caught. Just to see what would happen. Went crazy with naked bodies and <br/>
flashed quite a few people myself let alone what my social life was like. <br/>
You know the whole theory about the good small town catholic schooled girl <br/>
that goes nuts in the big city? I know a lot of it has to do with other <br/>
factors, but I do believe it for the most part.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I like this statement.  I want my children to be trusted more and more to <br/>
make their own decisions.  What I&#39;ve noticed already, they&#39;re only 3 and 4 <br/>
years old, is that when I tell them to do something, they don&#39;t want to do <br/>
it.  If they think about helping me and ask if they can help, it&#39;s much <br/>
nicer.  There&#39;s no fighting.  Sometimes I&#39;ll ask them to help me or ask them <br/>
to pick up their toys.  If they don&#39;t want to, I don&#39;t force them.  Usually <br/>
when they see me cleaning up, they&#39;ll start helping me.  I talk to them about <br/>
how important it is to pick up their messes on the livingroom floor because <br/>
someone can get hurt tripping and falling, or someone can step on their toys <br/>
and break them.<br/>

Sounds familiar!<br/>
Just today, Sierra decided to take a shower AFTER I had fixed her hair (she <br/>
asked me to). So I asked her to please keep her hair dry so I wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
to fix it again.<br/>
I was in the bathroom putting makeup on while her and Jalen were in the <br/>
shower and she says &quot;you can&#39;t control my hair mom&quot;. I laughed and agreed but <br/>
said I only wanted her to keep it dry so I wouldn&#39;t have to fix it again.<br/>
So she says she doesn&#39;t want me to fix it and she&#39;s going to wash it.<br/>
What do you say to that? Hmmphf.<br/>
Thinks she&#39;s got her own mind or something, sheesh! :)<br/>
<br/>
So then I asked her if I could control HER, and she says yes. &quot;I CAN? You&#39;ll <br/>
let me?&quot; I say, she laughs and says &quot;nah&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The world&#39;s much smaller than you think.  Made up of two kinds of <br/>
people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
