<div id="ygrps-yiv-76367078">This saga of Jayn�s infection has really tested me and my commitment to<br/>
non-coercive parenting. Both James and I are feeling pretty wracked with<br/>
guilt that we allowed this decayed tooth to get as far as it did. We both<br/>
were seeking the help of people who were pretty strongly pressuring us to<br/>
abandon our ideals and philosophy in the face of medicine. We are both<br/>
extremely grateful that we didn�t, and that it never came to a place where<br/>
we thought we would have to do so to save Jayn�s life.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I believe the abundant Universe, some may think of a named Deity, sends us<br/>
messages as we need them, and if we don�t recognize them sends a more<br/>
forceful signal. I was procrastinating finding Jayn the right dentist, so I<br/>
was �sent� a more serious message to get my dumb ass moving.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My reasons for my slowness were good enough, as I *thought* then. I was<br/>
waiting for Jayn�s willingness to become more than sporadic islands in a sea<br/>
of fear and nervousness. Looking at it now, I see that I was squandering<br/>
those moments of willingness, and finding justifications for waiting, and<br/>
failing to heed the gentle messages that I was being sent, including the<br/>
kindly expressed concerns of my unschooling friends IRL. Allison, you were<br/>
right.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In researching about tooth decay and similar situations I took heart from<br/>
the stories of self-healing and nerves simply dying and the �easy stories�.<br/>
I mentally minimized or ignored the more serious tales, while still being<br/>
able to be grateful that Jayn does not have tooth problems like flaking<br/>
enamel beginning with her the first eruption. I now think that many of these<br/>
folk with less serious issues probably have the Periodontal or Periapical<br/>
abscesses, both of which can evidently be treated to a great extent with<br/>
localized drainage. (one source of info HYPERLINK<br/>
&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm&quot;http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm">http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm&quot;http://www.ncemi.org/cse/cse0418.htm</a> )<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
That is not what Jayn has anymore. She has a complication of the Periapical<br/>
abscess situation, facial cellulitis,  that if left any longer without<br/>
treatment would almost certainly have become a life threatening � rush to<br/>
the ER � situation, and even with antibiotics cannot be let alone<br/>
indefinitely without becoming a very serious illness with ramifications as<br/>
far in advance as possible heart problems in adulthood. We have gotten to it<br/>
soon enough to avoid those things, or I am convinced that the doctors would<br/>
have scheduled a sooner surgery than a week from Monday � on the 25th.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
There are a number of things that I wish I had done differently. Since the<br/>
biggest issue for me was Jayn�s willingness, I wish that I had sought ways<br/>
to help her come to a willing mindset sooner. Climbing into my time<br/>
machine�.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would have taken Jayn with me to many more, if not all, of my dental<br/>
cleaning visits rather than just when she was an infant sleeping in her<br/>
stroller, and the time I went 8 months ago. I would have brought her along<br/>
to more of James� numerous treatments, just to drop in and become familiar<br/>
with dentists, and establish the kind of routine aspect of it.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would have sought out the best, kindest full service dentist I could from<br/>
an earlier age � and I�m pretty sure we would have found this same lady<br/>
through my SIL from the get go � and visited her with Jayn just to<br/>
acclimatize. My advice would then be less helpful here (g). But the main<br/>
thing would be taking time without the pressure of urgent worry to find<br/>
someone good and kind and, I say again, full service/all procedures so that<br/>
if serious stuff is needed the bonds of trust are already there. Her cavity<br/>
would have been spotted when tiny and dealt with then, or at any rate sooner<br/>
- as soon as a willing moment manifested.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A big part of my bad justifications is that I have a lot of issues about<br/>
medical personnel � shitty experiences from my childhood and youth, that<br/>
lead me to view the nice and good doctors that I meet, and of whom we are<br/>
all patients, as being the exceptions. Maybe they really are exceptions � I<br/>
have managed to meet some distant, superior, scare mongering, uncaring or<br/>
just not good specialists (and alternative medicine practitioners) in the<br/>
last few years also � who got the sack fast. See? I have a lot of distrust<br/>
of doctors and their motives and their integrity � which is all the more<br/>
ironic as my step father is a wonderful, compassionate doctor and teacher of<br/>
medicine. (Some of his less affluent clinic patients pay him in produce from<br/>
their gardens.)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This baggage leads me to want to minimize my contact with doctors beyond the<br/>
essential � go when you are sick and get a pap smear (not Jayn!)<br/>
periodically.  To my shame, what happened here was I didn�t go when the need<br/>
first arose, and now poor Jayn had to pay the price in discomfort.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
In this specific situation over the last week, what I would have done<br/>
differently is listen to her �no, I want to go home� at once, as I said in<br/>
the last post. I tried to cajole and persuade � instead of trusting<br/>
immediately that Jayn really did know what she needed, *and* that we were<br/>
capable of finding it for her (the Universe providing). This was the worst<br/>
thing that I did in terms of possible damage to our relationship � a true<br/>
deep regret that I have already apologized to Jayn for. She assures me that<br/>
she has forgiven me. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
What I would *not* have done is handle either tooth brushing or her free<br/>
diet any differently. I am still convinced that she will continue to<br/>
spontaneously brush her teeth (once she is out of pain and sensitivity) more<br/>
often than if I were trying to force the issue, and she still instinctively<br/>
does things like drink a bottle of water after eating sweet stuff. She is<br/>
even getting more into eating cheesy things after sweets.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the grand things that has come from this experience is the renewed<br/>
gratitude and wonder that I have for my darling James (�dh� is just too<br/>
small to contain my feelings). For all of his expressed worry that we might<br/>
have to �make her�, he was just blowing off steam by saying those kind of<br/>
things to me in our �How far can we let this go� discussions. When it came<br/>
to the crunch sitting in a dentist�s office, he was splendid. His forceful<br/>
and assertive manner with the pushy docs was wonderful. His ability to<br/>
articulate the philosophy of including Jayn in the decision making process,<br/>
to their bafflement, while I just looked at them with a slack jaw or<br/>
muttered, �That won�t be happening� �.. I�m just overwhelmed to the point of<br/>
speechlessness with how fundamentally he �gets it� � and can express it to<br/>
others. <br/>

I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to write your teeth <br/>
saga-  I&#39;m in a similar situation with my 6yo (no infection but lots <br/>
of work possibly needed) and your story has given me lots of food <br/>
for thought.  This in particular resonated with me:<br/>

These are the kind of experiences that really *teach* me about the strength and deep, mental and emotional capacity a true unschooler has or needs to work towards.

wouldn&#39;t have been less comfortable.     Perhaps you&#39;re in a six of one, half a <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
But it&#39;s hard do know when you&#39;re ten seconds from the tipping point where <br/>
everything starts to get sunny and bright and good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-One of the grand things that has come from this experience is the renewed<br/>

to the crunch sitting in a dentist’s office, he was splendid.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That is so cool.<br/>
<br/>
I see Keith defend our kids from his mom in really sweet ways.   He still <br/>
hardly stands up to her himself, about himself, but he will block her when she <br/>
starts toward one of ours (philosophically or verbally).<br/>
<br/>
It probably helps some that James and Keith are both big confident guys, too. <br/>
  I&#39;ve seen doctors intimidate full grown men without blinking an eye, so any <br/>
advantage, when it comes to doctors and their recitation of &quot;how it has to <br/>
be&quot; is a good advantage.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby had a lot of dental problems, and had four steel-capped teeth when he <br/>
was little, because some of his enamel was just no good.   Neither Keith nor I <br/>
had that problem when we were little, so I have no idea what it might&#39;ve come <br/>
from.   Marty&#39;s and Holly&#39;s were both much better.   With his permanent teeth, <br/>
Kirby&#39;s seem fine.<br/>
<br/>
I used to take the extra kids to the dentist and we&#39;d watch whichever kid was <br/>
in the chair.   Another cool thing about the pediatric dentist we used to go <br/>
to (who&#39;s retired now) is that they had three chairs all in one big room, so <br/>
there was no mystery-room with big noise to make kids use their imaginations.   <br/>
They could watch other kids even without coming with siblings, and I think <br/>
that was very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
They have another dentist now, and I try to ask the receptionists to <br/>
reschedule every time I&#39;m there, at least for a cleaning, because I have a big <br/>
dentist-aversion, and would stall for years, so I ask Keith and the kids and the <br/>
schedulers to send us cards, call, make sure.   Not because I believe it&#39;s <br/>
necessary, but because I believe I would procrastinate.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, Marty and Kirby take themselves.   They&#39;ve been scheduled on the same <br/>
day twice, so they just go together.   Cool!<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted braces (and needed them) and is over halfway through treatment.  <br/>
 Marty and Kirby had said they didn&#39;t want them, but the new dentist said <br/>
that was fine for Kirby, whose teeth are symmetrically crooked (the center top <br/>
two are inside, a bit, of the next two out), but otherwise fine.   Marty&#39;s that <br/>
LOOK better, are way crowded in the back.   Keith has had precisely the same <br/>
dental problems the dentist told him Marty might have if he didn&#39;t get this <br/>
taken care of, so Marty agree, even though he&#39;s likely to have braces past his <br/>
18th birthday and he thinks that&#39;s just wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both Marty and Holly take good care of their braces, and having had the <br/>
option not to get them is very likely part of what makes it easy and sensible for <br/>
them to do that.   If we pressed against their will to host some complicated <br/>
hardware for two years or more, they might rightfully have resented the extra <br/>
care it takes, but they chose and we gave them the gift of paying for something <br/>
that they wanted to do.   It&#39;s just a whole different dynamic from when the <br/>
conversation is all between the parent and dentist, over the child&#39;s head <br/>
without a glance to see whether she&#39;d just rather have crooked teeth or get braces <br/>
as an adult or whatever.   There really ARE options.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you shared all that Robyn, but I don&#39;t think you should feel so <br/>
guilty.   <br/>

where everything starts to get sunny and bright and good.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You are being too nice to me. I knew that it was not going to get sunny and<br/>
bright because I know Jayn. I had hoped it would become calm enough for Jayn<br/>
to at least open her mouth - and the only real surprise I got was the Oral<br/>
Surgeon #3 lady. <br/>
<br/>
Now it is sunny and bright from the get go. Me: &quot;Dr. Hila wants to check out<br/>
your cheek tomorrow.&quot;  She: &quot;Yay. She loves me, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; It probably helps some that James and Keith are both big confident<br/>
guys, too. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Big, confident teddy bears.<br/>
<br/>
Big, confident chocolate covered marshmallows.<br/>
<br/>
I was watching James and Jayn playing a game where they were taking turns<br/>
playing follow the leader with silly walks. It came to me that I never need<br/>
be afraid for Jayn. If I were to get run over today, James would be able and<br/>
willing to continue with this parenting path - he would find a way to<br/>
accomplish it. I asked him and he has said so with a kind of incredulous,<br/>
&quot;Well of course I&#39;d still Unschool - what are you thinking?!!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I feel very blessed because I know that there are Moms struggling with<br/>
bringing their husbands to the paradigm shift - which has nothing to do with<br/>
the father&#39;s love of their children - but I think James was always there and<br/>
was waiting for me to catch up.<br/>
<br/>
He has a bit of bluster and way of talking himself out of his negative<br/>
feelings that I used to take as disagreement - but it&#39;s not. It&#39;s just his<br/>
way of playing devil&#39;s advocate with himself, if that makes sense. Sometimes<br/>
he just needs to verbalize the stupid, schoolish, coercive idea or solution<br/>
just to remind himself of how stupid, schoolish and coercive it is. <br/>
<br/>
It sure has taken me a long time to get that about him. We&#39;ve only been<br/>
married 8.5 years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293584886">This thread wrapped up while I was away but I just wanted to add a PS.<br/>
Thank you, Robyn, for sharing the details of this story with us.  We also<br/>
had some rather extensive pediatric dentistry done on Anika last year .  She<br/>
was 4.  She was frightened by a rather clueless receptionist in the first<br/>
office we tried but the dentist there referred us to a great Ped dds who was<br/>
also a surgeon.  He said they always refer all their young patients to him.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The second office treated Anika with respect, went very slow, on my lap for<br/>
the  initial exam and then for the surgery, the anesthesiologist came out to<br/>
give her Versed out in the waiting/play room with  me.  They waited until<br/>
she was in full twillight mode before moving her to the chair.  They did all<br/>
her dental work while she was out including her fillings, extraction,<br/>
spacer, cleaning and flouride, so she wouldn&#39;t have to go through any more<br/>
procedures till her 6mo check up.<br/>
<br/>
When we came back for the follow up 6 mo later the dentist asked if I were<br/>
brushing her teeth for her. When I said no, she does that herself he smiled<br/>
and told her what a good job she was doing.  He explained that he encourages<br/>
all his parents to let the kids take control of it themselves so they will<br/>
learn to have their own good habits.  <br/>
