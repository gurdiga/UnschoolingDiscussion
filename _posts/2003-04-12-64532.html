<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740182513">If a person goes to a public place, is it okay for one of the people there to <br/>
follow her home against her will?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want private e-mail about the discussions here unless it&#39;s friendly.  <br/>
I don&#39;t want insulting, personal harangues sent to me privately.  Honestly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like the person who is doing that to stop, please.<br/>
<br/>
I would have written that privately, but I don&#39;t want a private exchange.<br/>
<br/>
When I write about homeschooling, I want to do it in public so it can benefit <br/>
lots of people.  <br/>
<br/>
What started the whole nightmarish nonsense of the past two days on this list <br/>
was me answering someone&#39;s question honestly and lightly.   I will continue <br/>
to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, people will probably continue to overreact to little things, <br/>
take stuff personally that wasn&#39;t personal, and waste over a thousand <br/>
people&#39;s time with repetitive arguments which are NOT about unschooling, not <br/>
about natural learning, and not about what families can do to make their <br/>
lives with their children richer and more peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
I invite anyone who wants to write about unschooling to keep on doing it, <br/>
those who are still ranting about the difference between them and other <br/>
Christians to STOP, it was never helpful and it was never necessary, and <br/>
let&#39;s get back to talking about unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659629653">I&#39;m happy to have private emails if someone wants to talk more  <br/>
privately about how they might avoid spanking in their particular  <br/>
situation. That seems like something that might be useful to some  <br/>
people who might feel uncomfortable getting to the nitty-gritty on a  <br/>
big huge list like this, so I just want to make it clear that I&#39;d  <br/>
understand that.<br/>
