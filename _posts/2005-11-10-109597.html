Yes, but I think the original poster meant that there needs to be a<br/>
Rosetta Stone or a decoder ring or an adult to answer questions about<br/>
the code of written language. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, she said without &quot;formal instruction&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to remove a human from other humans and put them on<br/>
some desert island hoping they will survive, they might NOT learn to<br/>
walk like other humans. They might scuffle around on all four, or<br/>
slouch over as they forage. They wouldn&#39;t learn to talk, they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
learn things that are natural to humans in society.<br/>
So I think that ALL learning, even things that are innate, are mostly<br/>
learned by being surrounded with it.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult being present and answering questions equals &quot;formal<br/>
instruction&quot; , then my definition of instruction is a very different<br/>
thing.<br/>
