is the reason to joke to learn things? No, no it&#39;s the first one!<br/>

<br/>
You get BBC things too?  Australian?  Is there much very-local TV  <br/>
produced there?  Do you have NZ soap opera?  Cop show?  Sit coms?<br/>
<br/>
Someone from Australia tried one day to enlighten me about Bananas in  <br/>
Pajamas, explaining to me whose accent represented what region and  <br/>
socio-economic strata of Australia.  I had nothing to stick it to.  I  <br/>
know a little about Sydney and a little about Tasmania, and I&#39;ve  <br/>
watched Priscilla the Queen of the Desert a lot.  None of that  <br/>
helped. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The second season of Bananas in Pajamas we got here, they had dubbed  <br/>
the theme song with American singers.  I don&#39;t remember if they re- <br/>
did the characters&#39; voices.  My kids didn&#39;t watch it much.<br/>
<br/>
Our Brit-living American friends were here and were surprised that  <br/>
Clifford the Big Red Dog wasn&#39;t British.  It&#39;s dubbed there, they  <br/>
think.  (Holly can correct me later if I&#39;m telling this story wrong...)<br/>

a bit of cash to do Clifford in the first place.  But Arthur isn&#39;t dubbed. <br/>

Well other than the Wiggles, there are also &quot;The Koala Brothers&quot; (Disney)<br/>
and &quot;The Shapies&quot; (Animania - HD animation channel).<br/>
<br/>
If it helps you at all Sandra, I was told my accent (oft confused with<br/>
English but not by English people) is designated &quot;Educated Australian&quot;, but<br/>
I can slide into Strine if you ever want a demonstration of a more &quot;working<br/>
class&quot; (supposedly) lingo.<br/>

Try &quot;Muriel&#39;s Wedding&quot; too. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think things designed for the youngest-aged kids are hard for them  <br/>
to understand if they&#39;re foreign, even a little foreign.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ve gotten DVDs of English or Australian TV, and when it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t have subtitles I&#39;m pretty frustrated.  I&#39;m fine for long  <br/>
stretches, but then there will be some little phrase thrown off  <br/>
without them moving their lips, and between the accent, the phrase  <br/>
itself and no lip movement I am clue-free.  Frustrating.  Like  <br/>
reading a book with a big white spot over the words.<br/>
<br/>
But when they DO have subtitles, it&#39;s great, because I don&#39;t care so  <br/>
much if someone comes in and talks to me, or if I&#39;m sewing,  because  <br/>
when the noise comes, I can read the words and keep on going.   <br/>
Subtitles are a verbal, multi-tasking visual-reader&#39;s dream.<br/>
<br/>
The other day we were watching something and Holly asked me what  <br/>
someone had said, and she put it back to that place, and I said &quot;Well  <br/>
put the subtitles on.&quot;  She looked at me with the look that made me  <br/>
know I had asked for the impossible, and said, &quot;It&#39;s a tape, mom!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  I hate tapes, then. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

There&#39;s something else mysterious too about marketing foreign media  <br/>

&lt;g&gt;  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was completely revamped for the  <br/>
English market—every scrap of everything was redone, which was  <br/>
guaranteed by their changing the name and the weapon Michaelangelo  <br/>
carried.  The official simple explanation is that nunchuku were  <br/>
illegal in England, and they didn&#39;t want to encourage any &quot;ninja&quot;  <br/>
business, so they changed the name to Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles.   <br/>
We have some of the books.  But they redid the action figures and  <br/>
everything for their own market, and I don&#39;t know if that extended to  <br/>
all commonwealth countries or not.<br/>
<br/>
This reminds me to link my games pages, which I&#39;ve just worked on  <br/>
yesterday.  The chess page has some new art and links to more art,  <br/>
and there are more links to online games.  But there&#39;s a Ninja/Hero  <br/>
Turtle mention.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gameplay">http://sandradodd.com/gameplay</a><br/>

There are books unavailable for export, and some books that are  <br/>
different in Canada and the U.S.  Now, though, with international  <br/>
shipping of individual orders so common and international Paypal and  <br/>
all that, I expect some of those things might fall or soften.<br/>
<br/>
In England they have disposable fountain pens.<br/>
I thought of buying one but they&#39;re expensive (expensive by the time  <br/>
they get to New Mexico &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1295134795">I remember when I lived in Britain that the characters associated with <br/>
American breakfast cereal were different. I can&#39;t recall which cereals <br/>
in particular, but some of ones like Lucky Charms, Frosted Flakes, <br/>
Froot Loops, and the like were associated with advertising characters <br/>
that were totally unlike the characters that hawk them in the US. <br/>
<br/>
I thought it was rather odd.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211264814">Oh my.... this brings back a memory....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When my family<br/>
&gt;first arrived in the UK from the US my children then 8 + 9 had a tough time<br/>
&gt;understanding &#39;anyone&#39; here in the UK.<br/>
&gt;I hadn&#39;t expected that.  Then to make it even worse we move to Wales, were<br/>
&gt;the accent can be really really hard<br/>
&gt;to decipher sometimes.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When dh and I went to England many years ago (1975!! hell, how can that <br/>
BE??) my American penfriend came over to join us for a few weeks <br/>
travelling around. On the second day she was there we were on the top of <br/>
a double decker London bus and Christine commented on the two very <br/>
drunken men (we are talking 9 in the morning here!) who were not only <br/>
very drunk but also VERY vocal. She commented on how their English <br/>
accents were so different she couldn&#39;t understand them.<br/>
<br/>
We never did enlighten her: it was a New Zealand (but very drunkenly <br/>
slurred) accent, and their words were indeed  strange ones for a <br/>
Christian girl from Colorado ;-)<br/>
We just smiled and agreed with her.<br/>

They thought no Americans knew what &quot;the philosopher&#39;s stone&quot; was.<br/>
They had no idea how big a deal those books would be, and they were  <br/>
at the time (still, but less now that they have a best selling  <br/>
hardback) in the business of producing inexpensive paperback books  <br/>
for the school market.    Since I was a little kid, &quot;Scholastic  <br/>
Books&quot; meant books kids could buy at school, in monthly batch sales.   <br/>
The classroom gets points the teacher can use to get posters, pencil  <br/>
sharpeners, pencils, stickers, etc.  Kids earn points they can get  <br/>
free books with.<br/>
<br/>
So to make a cheap paperback version of the first book, they figured  <br/>
(I&#39;m assuming) that they should make it &quot;more accessible&quot; to an  <br/>
American market, and I guess their assumption was that Americans know  <br/>
the word &quot;sorcerer&quot; but are afraid of philosophy and never read any  <br/>
medieval history or trivia.   Probably I was a weird kid, but I read  <br/>
about alchemy from the time I was nine or ten, so I was vaguely  <br/>
familiar with what &quot;the philosopher&#39;s stone&quot; meant.<br/>
<br/>
To have changed it was SUCH a bad idea I hate to think about it.   <br/>
&quot;The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone&quot; means not one damned thing, historically or in  <br/>
the context of the book.<br/>
<br/>
They changed lots of little things in that first book, replacing  <br/>
Britishisms with American equivalents.  I haven&#39;t really followed  <br/>
more recent changes (haven&#39;t done any side-by-side comparisons except  <br/>
for the first book, which I bought but gave away), but I know the  <br/>
recent book maintained &#39;trainers,&#39; which in the U.S. is a high-priced  <br/>
personal coach, but in the U.K. is a pair of what we more commonly  <br/>
call &quot;tennis shoes&quot; or athletic shoes.<br/>

I have mixed feelings.  Jumbly feelings, really. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035129300">The philosopher&#39;s stone dates to a legend based in alchemy (the precursor to<br/>
chemistry). Many disagree on what the stone actually is. Some theorize it<br/>
has a formulae written up on, others that it is a special material. It is<br/>
the key component for transmuting base metals (lead) into gold or for<br/>
brewing healing, longevity, and life potions. Since it has been &quot;lost&quot; no<br/>
alchemist was ever able to reproduce this feat.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of sites on it.<br/>
<br/>
Trivia: Scholastic changed JK Rowlings Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s<br/>
Stone to the Sorcerer Stone as they did not think it would play as well here<br/>
and people may not know what it was (Who wants to watch a philosophy show)<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if I can be more help.<br/>
<br/>
On a hunch I checked wikipedia (quick resource)<br/>
<br/>
&lt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_stone">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosopher_stone</a> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
The philosopher&#39;s stone, in Latin lapis philosophorum, is a mythical<br/>
substance that supposedly could turn inexpensive metals into gold and/or<br/>
create an elixir that would make humans younger, thus delaying death. It was<br/>
a longtime &quot;holy grail&quot; of Western alchemy. In the mystic view of alchemy,<br/>
making the philosopher&#39;s stone would bring enlightenment upon the maker and<br/>
conclude the Great Work. It is also known by several other names, such as<br/>
materia prima.<br/>
<br/>
    Philosopher&#39;s Stone is also a modern slang term for the sclerotia of<br/>
certain hallucinogenic mushrooms, most notably that of Psilocybe mexicana.<br/>

  I admit it, I&#39;m ignorant on this...what is &quot;The Philosopher&#39;s Stone?&quot;   I<br/>
  know what a philosopher is, but what&#39;s the significance of the stone<br/>
part?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-853307889">When I at an airport bookstore we&#39;d get American parents coming through and picking up the Harry Potter books for their kids. Some knew they were &#39;Americanized&#39; and insisted on picking them up here because the Canadian editions were identical to the British. Some didn&#39;t know but after I told them they&#39;d get pissed with Scholastic and buy our version. <br/>
<br/>
  Apparently &quot;Americanizing foreign english books is a common practice. Especially with kids titles.<br/>
  Dawn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Because the people at Scholastic Books were STUPID.<br/>
  They thought no Americans knew what &quot;the philosopher&#39;s stone&quot; was.<br/>
<br/>
  Ha, that&#39;s what I thought (about Scholastic that is).<br/>
<br/>
  To have changed it was SUCH a bad idea I hate to think about it.   <br/>
  &quot;The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone&quot; means not one damned thing, historically or in  <br/>
  the context of the book.<br/>
<br/>
  It made no sense to me, either.  It was a meaningless phrase.<br/>
<br/>
  They changed lots of little things in that first book, replacing  <br/>
  Britishisms with American equivalents.  I haven&#39;t really followed  <br/>
  more recent changes (haven&#39;t done any side-by-side comparisons except  <br/>
  for the first book, which I bought but gave away), but I know the  <br/>
  recent book maintained &#39;trainers,&#39; which in the U.S. is a high-priced  <br/>
  personal coach, but in the U.K. is a pair of what we more commonly  <br/>
  call &quot;tennis shoes&quot; or athletic shoes.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve noticed it in other sort-of mass market books, like Usborne.  Stories<br/>
  that are British (you can tell by place names and the odd expression left<br/>
  in) have all the spelling changed.  What I find funny are sentences left in<br/>
  like &quot;What are you on about?&quot; which wouldn&#39;t likely be said by an American.<br/>
  Then, they carry on about something happening in Kentucky &lt;g&gt;.  <br/>
<br/>
  I have mixed feelings.  Jumbly feelings, really. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I get rumbly ones - oh, that usually means I&#39;m hungry &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminded me of a bit from a recent article in our local home ed <br/>
mag (I&#39;m in Melbourne, Australia). A mother is writing about <br/>
&quot;learning not to question children about their motives&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She writes:<br/>
&quot;She read the &quot;Babysitter books&quot; (and everyone will tell you how BAD <br/>
that is!) in both the Australian and the American editions; the same <br/>
book twice, that is. Quite a long time later she chuckled to me, <br/>
&quot;They are *hilarious* those books, they translate all the language <br/>
into metric, so when one of the characters says,&#39;I wouldn&#39;t touch <br/>
that with a ten foot pole&#39;, they rewrite it as &#39;I wouldn&#39;t touch that <br/>
with a three metre pole.&#39;&quot; -- leading to amused speculation about the <br/>
interchange, &quot;Jamie, you&#39;ve grown another foot since I saw you&quot; and <br/>
the riposte, &quot;No, I&#39;ve still only got two&quot; and it&#39;s metric <br/>
equivalent. This little game with language and mathematics absorbed <br/>
her attention for a long period of time. A stern librarian would <br/>
never have known about the jokes, and would have thoroughly irritated <br/>
her by pushing her to read &quot;better&quot; books.&quot;<br/>
