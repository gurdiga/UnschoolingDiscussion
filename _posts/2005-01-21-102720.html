<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218072381">***Curious about these acronyms. Care to share?***<br/>
<br/>
I can tell you about Charge.  My grand nephew has Charge syndrome.<br/>
<br/>
Charge is an acronym for a particular group of birth anomalies.<br/>
<br/>
C - Coloboma (ocular) A cleft which affects the globe of the eye but not<br/>
the eyelid<br/>
AND<br/>
 -Cranial nerve anomalies which may involve the olfactory nerve, the<br/>
ocular nerve, may include unilateral facial palsy, the acoustic nerve,<br/>
difficulty swallowing<br/>
<br/>
H - Heart malformations<br/>
<br/>
A- Atresia or stenosis of choanae  unilateral or bilateral<br/>
<br/>
R- retardation of growth and/or development<br/>
<br/>
G- Genitourinary anomalies <br/>
<br/>
E-Ear anomalies which may include the outer ear, middle ear and or inner<br/>
ear.<br/>
<br/>
My nephew was born with cleft palate and two esophageal tubes, one of<br/>
which connected to his lung and the other which made no connection to his<br/>
stomach, cleft eyeballs, heart abnormalities, urinary tract<br/>
abnormalities, growth hormone deficiency among other things.  <br/>
<br/>
His ears were completely sealed the canals were so constricted.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s almost nine and after many surgeries is doing fairly well.  We took<br/>
care of him for a year when he was very small and his young mother had<br/>
difficulty coping with his condition.   His name is Jacob and he loves<br/>
Dan Rather. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
