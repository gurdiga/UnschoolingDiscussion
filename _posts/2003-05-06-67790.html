Well, you could deny having said this, or say if we thought you said you were <br/>
surprised there wasn&#39;t more mail that we just can&#39;t bother to read your whole <br/>
post, that might generate some mail.   I could say &quot;Why are you calling me a <br/>
slacker?  Why are you being personal?&quot;   Then you could say Sandra ALWAYS <br/>
does that and everyone knows it and I could say an unschooler wouldn&#39;t have <br/>
said that to me  and then you can say &quot;I was on this list before and people <br/>
seemed not to understand me and here I am again and they still don&#39;t <br/>
understand me so obviously this list is never going to change.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then five people would defend one of us and three would defend the other, but <br/>
ten people would say we should all just hush because they joined this list <br/>
for peace and quiet, not to read discussions.<br/>
