<div id="ygrps-yiv-520048988">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I found this in a newsletter I get:  I thought maybe you all might be <br/>
interested.....I hope it is good.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Escape from Affluenza&quot; [by permission] -  Gary Foreman<br/>
<br/>
Your doctor examines you and asks about your symptoms. &quot;Well, Doc, I&#39;ve <br/>
got swollen expectations, shopping fever, chronic stress and <br/>
exhaustion.&quot; He looks a little more closely and then pronounces, &quot;I know <br/>
what it is. It&#39;s Affluenza!&quot; <br/>
<br/>
You, too, may be like the patient portrayed in the PBS special &quot;Escape <br/>
from Affluenza&quot; (July 7, 9 p.m. EDT). This hour-long special mixes a <br/>
light, tongue-in-cheek approach with a serious subject. Can you really <br/>
be happier living a simpler, more natural lifestyle? <br/>
<br/>
The show&#39;s hostess, Wanda Ubanska, and her husband answered that <br/>
question a few years ago by moving to the country and adopting a <br/>
slower-paced existence. <br/>
<br/>
Wanda introduces the viewer to a number of people who have come to <br/>
simple living from widely varying backgrounds. We meet a personnel <br/>
director who earned a &quot;six-figure income.&quot; His function? To tell other <br/>
employees that they were being &quot;downsized&quot; and losing their jobs. <br/>
Finally, it was his turn to join the unemployed. Today he works as a <br/>
physical therapist making one-fifth his old salary. He finds that <br/>
there&#39;s more time to spend with his family. Not only have they learned <br/>
to live on less than he makes, they&#39;re paying off bills that were <br/>
accumulated during his &quot;big income&quot; days. <br/>
<br/>
Along with interviews, the show intersperses some history and even a <br/>
light-hearted look at some ads from the 1950&#39;s. One section examines how <br/>
the frugal lifestyle of the original settlers has fared over the <br/>
centuries. Noted proponents including Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David <br/>
Thoreau and Abraham Lincoln are quoted. Attempts to foster simple living <br/>
from those first settlers to the hippies of the &#39;60&#39;s are discussed. <br/>
<br/>
Some have turned their passion for simple living into a vocation. Dick <br/>
Roy left a lucrative legal career to form the North West Earth <br/>
Institute, a private, non-profit organization that provides creative <br/>
opportunities for citizens to consider how their habits and values <br/>
affect the earth. <br/>
<br/>
Others were motivated by events to examine their lives. Evie was <br/>
climbing the career ladder when she was diagnosed with a terminal <br/>
illness. She decided that she wanted to be remembered for &quot;understanding <br/>
love, understanding service and a feeling of wholeness.&quot; Her recovery <br/>
has not shaken her conviction in her new-found, simpler life. <br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s simplicity advocates come from a variety of philosophical <br/>
backgrounds. Some are environmentalists concerned with the one ton of <br/>
solid waste the average American produces each year. Others come from a <br/>
religious view that dates back to the Puritans and Quakers. A third <br/>
group has decided to turn their backs on the &quot;rat race&quot; and embrace <br/>
anti-consumerism. <br/>
<br/>
As you might expect with a movement that&#39;s looking for a more <br/>
fulfilling, less commercial lifestyle, much of the energy comes from <br/>
grass-roots activists. We meet Cecile Andrews, the author of &quot;Circle of <br/>
Simplicity&quot;, in which she promotes small support groups for simple <br/>
living. The goal is not merely a less cluttered life, but rather <br/>
&quot;putting positive things in place of negative things&quot;. Members meet <br/>
regularly to share goals, ideas and success stories. <br/>
<br/>
Not all viewers will be ready to jump into this new way of living. Few <br/>
are likely to imitate the gentleman who uses a kayak for his daily work <br/>
commute. One 15-year-old exercises the prerogative of every teenager, <br/>
the pursuit of rebellion. She openly questions her parents&#39; frugal <br/>
lifestyle and spends less time at home because it&#39;s &quot;boring.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But, even if you&#39;re not ready to sell everything and move to the <br/>
country, you&#39;ll find this a thought provoking and entertaining hour. At <br/>
the least, you&#39;ll learn something (that there are 25 times as many <br/>
self-storage facilities as there were in 1970). You might be motivated <br/>
to change something, like the way you brew your tea (a claimed lifetime <br/>
savings of $600). Then again, you might be the one who quits your <br/>
high-tech job to pursue a career in acting, as did one gentleman <br/>
interviewed. <br/>
<br/>
The biggest problem with &quot;Escape from Affluenza&quot; is that the people who <br/>
could most benefit from watching the show won&#39;t have enough time to do <br/>
so. They&#39;ll be working a second job to keep up with their credit card <br/>
bills, or wandering the malls looking for a cure for depression. <br/>
<br/>
But if you can spare an hour, this show deserves to be on your <br/>
&quot;must-see&quot; list. In fact, you should watch it with someone who is <br/>
important in your life. Oh, and don&#39;t forget to schedule some time to <br/>
discuss it afterwards. You&#39;re bound to find some material for an <br/>
interesting conversation in &quot;Escape from Affluenza&quot;. <br/>
