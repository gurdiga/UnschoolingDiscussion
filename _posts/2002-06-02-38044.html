<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721609165">**I just have this desire to make him &quot;whole&quot; again, and I don&#39;t know if <br/>
that&#39;s a reasonable or attainable goal.**<br/>
<br/>
**Just give it time and peace and love.  Mush but true.  The rule of thumb is <br/>
one month of deschooling per one year of school.  Some recover in a minute, <br/>
some take a couple of years.**<br/>
<br/>
And some may never fully recover. Some kids are incredibly resilient, most <br/>
kids are moderately resilient, and some just aren&#39;t resilient at all. Their <br/>
wounds never quite heal true. :::shrug::::  You just have to do your best <br/>
with what you know now and not waste time regretting.<br/>
<br/>
Time and peace and love. Great prescription. :)<br/>
