That&#39;s something on Joyce&#39;s page.  It&#39;s a Question and Answer  <br/>
collection called The Unschooling Philosophy.  Some of it has been  <br/>
translated into German (and there&#39;s a link there).  Some of you have  <br/>
seen it, but it&#39;s worth a second and third look.<br/>
<br/>
People on this list (google or yahoo) are somewhat familiar with Joyce  <br/>
Fetteroll&#39;s writings, Pam Sorooshian&#39;s and mine.   In January 2010, in  <br/>
Santa Fe, the three of us (and our families) will be all in one place,  <br/>
in a leisurely fashion, for several days.   Details on that will  <br/>
appear gradually here:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s possible that Schuyler Waynforth, her husband and children will  <br/>
be there too.   Because of unschooling ideas, David Waynforth is  <br/>
studying children and food, and if they&#39;re able to be there, we can  <br/>
hear some of what he&#39;s discovered and deciphered.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s too early to make reservations, but it&#39;s not too early to think  <br/>
about it and maybe save some money.   For families interested in  <br/>
skiing or snowboarding, we&#39;ll be down the road from Ski Santa Fe.   <br/>
It&#39;s not a huge venue, but each family attending will have a condo  <br/>
with a fireplace and a kitchen with dishes and all, so restaurant  <br/>
meals won&#39;t be necessary, although we&#39;ll have communal dinners, and  <br/>
one will be a potluck.  Families can share a condo, and there&#39;s not a  <br/>
limit of people per unit.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a great gathering for beginning unschoolers, nor for families  <br/>
with very young children.   There are other things perfect for such  <br/>
families, though--the September conference in San Diego; the water  <br/>
park gathering in Ohio in February.   But for those who are interested  <br/>
in the philosophy and science of unschooling, my little symposium in  <br/>
Santa Fe could be rewarding and memorable.<br/>
<br/>
For those who receive this twice, feel free to stir up either of these  <br/>
discussion lists!  (And sorry for the duplication.)<br/>
