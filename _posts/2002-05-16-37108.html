Children are given to us, on loan, for a very short period of time. They come<br/>
to us like packets of flower seeds, with no pictures on the cover and no<br/>
guarantees. We do not know what they will look like, act like, or have the<br/>
potential to become. Our job, like the gardeners, is to meet their needs as<br/>
best we can: to give proper nourishment, love, attention, and caring, and to<br/>
hope for the best.<br/>

Unschooling-dotcom Email Discussion List<br/>
<br/>
Pointing out each thing he learns or each &quot;educational&quot; thing he does is<br/>
probably not the best approach, either.  Let it flow for a while.  If each<br/>
moment or conversation or activity is going to be reviewed for its<br/>
educational content, the whole day becomes one long test, and life&#39;s being<br/>
lived for the purpose of the review.  That makes things too self-conscious,<br/>
and he might close down some, or avoid the situations...<br/>
<br/>
...We have a bunch of pumpkins and morning glories just sprouted.  We could<br/>
thin them out and look at a few roots, but if we pull them ALL up to look we<br/>
won&#39;t have any adult plants.  Some have to be JUST watered and ignored.  And<br/>
the more we can water and ignore, the more we&#39;ll have grow to maturity.  Some<br/>
are going to spread out all over our side yard.  Some are going to grow up<br/>
into the trees and bushes and make a happy all-flowery mess, but not until<br/>
later in the year.   Some are going to die a natural death.  Some are going<br/>
to make seeds for next year, and some of those seeds (this being the desert,<br/>
and we being disorganized) won&#39;t be sprouting for four or five years.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the best learning is like that.  You can plan something, and you can<br/>
plant something, but you can&#39;t mess with it too much after that.  You just<br/>
have to let some stuff go at its own pace, and in its own season.<br/>

The Hole-in-the-Wall Experiment<br/>
<br/>
Sugata Mitra has a PhD in physics and heads research efforts at New Delhi&#39;s<br/>
NIIT, a fast-growing software and education company with sales of more than<br/>
$200 million and a market cap over $2 billion. But Mitra&#39;s passion is<br/>
computer-based education, specifically for India&#39;s poor. He believes that<br/>
children, even terribly poor kids with little education, can quickly teach<br/>
themselves the rudiments of computer literacy. The key, he contends, is for<br/>
teachers and other adults to give them free rein, so their natural curiosity<br/>
takes over and they teach themselves. He calls the concept &quot;minimally<br/>
invasive education.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To test his ideas, Mitra 13 months ago launched something he calls &quot;the hole<br/>
in the wall experiment.&quot; He took a PC connected to a high-speed data<br/>
connection and embedded it in a concrete wall next to NIIT&#39;s headquarters in<br/>
the south end of New Delhi. The wall separates the company&#39;s grounds from a<br/>
garbage-strewn empty lot used by the poor as a public bathroom. Mitra simply<br/>
left the computer on, connected to the Internet, and allowed any passerby to<br/>
play with it. He monitored activity on the PC using a remote computer and a<br/>
video camera mounted in a nearby tree.<br/>
<br/>
What he discovered was that the most avid users of the machine were ghetto<br/>
kids aged 6 to 12, most of whom have only the most rudimentary education and<br/>
little knowledge of English. Yet within days, the kids had taught themselves<br/>
to draw on the computer and to browse the Net. Some of the other things they<br/>
learned, Mitra says, astonished him.<br/>

Uncollege<br/>
<br/>
In last months newsletter I recommended Herbert Kohl&#39;s book &quot;The Question is<br/>
College&quot; for teens and parents considering the future. A reader replies<br/>
Another super great book for kids who want to do something other than<br/>
college is, &quot;The Uncollege Alternative: Your Guide to Incredible Careers and<br/>
Amazing Adventures Outside College&quot; by Danielle Kwatinetz-Wood.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ill be checking it out!<br/>

Final Thoughts<br/>
<br/>
People say, Dont we have a duty to expose children to whatever seems to us<br/>
best, most enjoyable, most significant, etc. in human life? (Or, to use a<br/>
popular cliche, The Best That Man Has Thought and Done.) Why think of it as a<br/>
duty? It is a pleasure, one of the most natural things in human life. We<br/>
constantly tell our friends about the things we like, urge them to read<br/>
books, see movies, hear music, or do this or that. The problem is that if we<br/>
urge too strongly, our friend may think that he must do what what we urge<br/>
lest he hurt our feelings. So with the gifted teacher in the open classroom,<br/>
filling it full of all kinds of wonderful things to look at, work with, do.<br/>
He must still leave the children a chance to say No. Otherwise exposure, or<br/>
call it temptation, crosses some kind of boundary and becomes seduction,<br/>
hidden coercion, do it to make me happy, do it because otherwise Ill be<br/>
unhappy and maybe even wont like you.<br/>
<br/>
