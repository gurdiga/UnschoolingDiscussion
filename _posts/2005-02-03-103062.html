Sandra, I don&#39;t know how many pages you have on your website now, but I<br/>
bet it&#39;s more than 365!  What do you think?  Would you be willing to do<br/>
this - just randomly pick a new gem each day and send it to a list (maybe<br/>
here, maybe we all want to discuss it, or to a new list with Sandra as the<br/>
only poster if we just want to receive and reflect)?  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a<br/>
way to automate something like this, but maybe that&#39;s not necessary.<br/>

I didn&#39;t write most of that, but there&#39;s some good stuff, and thanks!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know either, but what I do every day is read this list, <br/>
AlwaysLearning, and Unschooling.com     (and every few days I check unschooling.info, which <br/>
I wish would heat up better, but it will if it needs to, I guess).<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know...<br/>
What if it keeps someone from reading the live, current stuff like this?<br/>
<br/>
I have an announcement list for when there are new pages on the site, or <br/>
substantial additions to existing pages.    You can subscribe to it by going to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
or<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/announce">http://sandradodd.com/announce</a><br/>
<br/>
But it only comes once or twice a month.<br/>
<br/>
And then there&#39;s UnschoolingHighlights, that Pam Sorooshian runs, which is a <br/>
&quot;best of&quot; mailing list from which subscribers just get the coolest posts from <br/>
a few unschooling lists she&#39;s on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-466591408">If somebody is reading a website like Sandra&#39;s and finds something that <br/>
just really hits them and they have that urge to broadcast it to the <br/>
world, you could try sending it to me for the Highlights list. I just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want really lengthy stuff - the point of the highlights is to <br/>
keep things pretty short and sweet and non-demanding, but inspirational <br/>
and useful.<br/>
<br/>
If it is from Sandra&#39;s site, I&#39;d be able to easily figure out if I can <br/>
repost it on the highlights list --- but if it is from other sites, I&#39;d <br/>
appreciate having permission granted before it is sent to me.<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s not the &quot;daily dose&quot; that was being suggested - but just <br/>
another idea - to include things off websites as &quot;highlights&quot; along <br/>
with posts from the unschooling lists.<br/>
