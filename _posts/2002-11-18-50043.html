<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482900373">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
Quick questions for you guys, sorry if you&#39;ve had to answer these a thousand times already...<br/>
<br/>
What about state regulations and unschooling? Do you keep *records* through the interpretation of what your child is learning to show state officials?<br/>
<br/>
And what about college and unschooling? What if your kid wants to go to college and has been unschooled all of her life?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any comments.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
That would depend on what state you lived in. Here in FL, you can register <br/>
with a non public school and not worry about record keeping or keep a <br/>
portfolio if you are registered with the school board as a homeschooler. The <br/>
portfolio&#39;s for unschoolers are very non schooly with a lot of pictures.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And what about college and unschooling? What if your kid wants to go to <br/>
college and has been unschooled all of her life?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The unschooler&#39;s I know of that wanted to go to college took the SAT&#39;s and <br/>
were accepted into the colleges they applied to. The others I know of <br/>
started community college as dual enrollment at 16. Of coure I haven&#39;t known <br/>
very many, but enough to have me not worry at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-665380341">I don&#39;t keep the exact records that my state calls for, but from what I do keep, I could throw together something to satisfy them if I ever had to. I don&#39;t have to turn in anything each year except for a signed statement saying that I&#39;m complying with the law.<br/>

college and has been unschooled all of her life?**<br/>
<br/>
She goes. Why would being unschooled all her life be a problem?<br/>
<br/>
My unschooled all her life 17yo is &quot;dual enrolled&quot; at the local community <br/>
college this year. (She&#39;s officially a &quot;high school&quot; student because it <br/>
preserves her options better). She&#39;s doing the whole school routine for the <br/>
first time in her life and is doing better than just fine at it. :) She&#39;s <br/>
taking a freshman composition course - her instructor has used one of her <br/>
papers and a citation page for another as examples of excellence. It&#39;s the <br/>
first time she&#39;s ever been required to write anything in her life. Her <br/>
writing to this point was solely for her own purposes, on her own schedule, <br/>
with editing or critiquing by us only at her request. It seems to have worked <br/>
fine. :)<br/>
<br/>
Alison McKee has written extensively on her experiences with her always <br/>
unschooled children. See her book &quot;From Homeschool to College and Work&quot; for a <br/>
wonderfully written look at how they documented quite unconventional learning <br/>
for admission offices of 4 year universities. And don&#39;t miss &quot;Homeschooling <br/>
our Children, Unschooling Ourselves&quot; which is my newest favorite &quot;homeschool <br/>
book&quot;. She writes honestly and with courage of the doubts and fears and <br/>
mistakes, as well as the joys, of her unschooling years - it&#39;s a rare peek <br/>
into &quot;how it works&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-573211427">Once again I&#39;ve had one of those &#39;not getting anywhere&#39; discussions <br/>
with DH about unschooling.<br/>
Actually, it was more to do with maths. He is quite happy to <br/>
*unchool* everything else, mainly cos he thinks maths is the most <br/>
important thing in the galaxy and everything else isn&#39;t.<br/>
I would guess that my kids know everything taught at elementary <br/>
level for maths and have learnt this through everyday life. He now <br/>
wants them to start workbooks for the rest of it. They do not want <br/>
too.<br/>
I&#39;ve tried explaining to him that they only need higher level maths if <br/>
they wish to take an exam in the subject or want to become <br/>
scientists or mathematicians (which is what he is). He then scoffed <br/>
at my own inability to solve some problem.<br/>
It was, if a+b=1000, and a is 150 more than b, what are a and b.<br/>
I could have done it 15 years ago when I was at school and doing <br/>
maths daily. But not now.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him when in real life would I ever need that ability. To get <br/>
exams he said.<br/>
Therefore his argument is you need to study maths to pass the <br/>
exams.<br/>
Now, he has a small point in that in the UK you need GCSE maths <br/>
(taken at 16) in order to get nearly every job, even the dead-end <br/>
ones and you will be passed over in favour of another applicant if <br/>
you don&#39;t have it.<br/>
I personally think you shouldn&#39;t take exams if you don&#39;t want too, <br/>
and if the child wishes to learn maths in order to get that piece of <br/>
paper then they will do so when the motivation is there. It also <br/>
seems pointless learning things like quadratic equations. The only <br/>
use they serve is too pass that exam. That appears to be their <br/>
function!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel I can elucidate my arguments well in favour of the <br/>
children doing or not doing maths as they wish too. He turns into a <br/>
logical mathematician when I try to speak and I feel unable to <br/>
explain &#39;feeling&#39; in a way that makes sense. Which is why I&#39;m <br/>
turning to you lot for help.<br/>
Why is it necassary to learn something that you are only learning <br/>
to get a bit of paper that is irrelevant to everyday life and who they <br/>
are?<br/>
He is starting to push them, especially DD as once upon a time <br/>
she was 6 years ahead of her age group in maths and now she is <br/>
no longer. This is, of course, my fault. For Homeschooling and for <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

also,  Linear equations, quadratics, trig, Algebraic Expressions of <br/>

I&#39;ve never figured out how being able to calculate the area undera  <br/>

everybody to learn it just for the few who are going to go on and be <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1443742474">**And what about college and unschooling? What if your kid wants to go to <br/>
college and has been unschooled all of her life?**<br/>
<br/>
**She goes. Why would being unschooled all her life be a problem?**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**I never said it was a problem! That&#39;s YOUR interpretation. I was actually<br/>
asking for people&#39;s opinion on how they have managed with this (if they <br/>
always had to take an exam to be admitted, etc.). That&#39;s all.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh for gosh sakes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s MY interpretration. You didn&#39;t give us a heck of a lot to work <br/>
on to figure out what you were &quot;actually asking&quot; for. Did you want to know <br/>
about transcripts or how the heck they pass exams if they&#39;ve never done them <br/>
before or how will they handle the discipline or can they be accepted or or <br/>
or.... well. You just asked, what if? My logical interpretation was that you <br/>
felt there might be some problem, impediment, concern, something different <br/>
from regular ordinary decisions about college, caused by unschooling. So gee, <br/>
I asked a question, and then gave short answers to a few possible <br/>
interpretations of what if. Sorry. I figured it was a nicer question than <br/>
asking What do you mean, what if? but I guess should have stuck to <br/>
straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
As for your expanded question, it depends. It depends for everyone, not just <br/>
unschoolers. Most colleges do require SAT or ACT scores, but there&#39;s no <br/>
reason unschoolers can&#39;t take and do well on the them. If they don&#39;t want to <br/>
take them they can concentrate their search on colleges that don&#39;t require <br/>
them. Just like any other college applicant. Unschoolers will probably need <br/>
to work a little harder at putting together transcripts or other <br/>
documentation of learning experiences than most applicants, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be what you&#39;re asking, unless that&#39;s covered by etc.?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a long long time since I let a stranger hurt my feelings with a <br/>
response on an email list. :::sigh::: Time to go no mail and deal with the <br/>
stress. &quot;See&quot; you all later.<br/>

I can empathize, my dh&#39;s family is very academic.  So they really are having a hard time understanding our unschooling choice.  But since its our life they pretty much butt out.  Which is good.<br/>
 <br/>
But in your case, its your husband,,,I&#39;m wondering,  Is your family planning on moving back to the UK?    That would be the only reason you would need to worry about that test,  right?   If so, they can prepare for it and that would be a very attainable goal.   Lots of mathmatical brains on our help line in the unschooling.com, right?<br/>
Second,  for me with my dh,  I often have to try and put the attention off him so he doesn&#39;t get emotional about it(and stomp away).  Try and sit down with him when you both aren&#39;t emotional and just try and talk about how you feel you are doing what you think is best for your children.  And if they want to be mathematicians they still can be,  they will be able to figure out if that is for them or not.   That&#39;s what is great about unschooling, they have time to figure those things out.   <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know where he is on control,  I know if he really wants them to develop a certain way this is probably going very hard for him.  I know its hard for me when I think about certain things:  like if they don&#39;t want to be musical or if they hated certain things; but I know now, even if they don&#39;t like those things there will be other things that will fill their lives and they will probably be well adjusted adults because of this type of parenting.<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps,    is sounds like you are doing great with your kids and I hope you are able to continue your unschooling efforts!<br/>

Once again I&#39;ve had one of those &#39;not getting anywhere&#39; discussions <br/>
with DH about unschooling.<br/>
Actually, it was more to do with maths. He is quite happy to <br/>
*unchool* everything else, mainly cos he thinks maths is the most <br/>
important thing in the galaxy and everything else isn&#39;t.<br/>
I would guess that my kids know everything taught at elementary <br/>
level for maths and have learnt this through everyday life. He now <br/>
wants them to start workbooks for the rest of it. They do not want <br/>
too.<br/>
I&#39;ve tried explaining to him that they only need higher level maths if <br/>
they wish to take an exam in the subject or want to become <br/>
scientists or mathematicians (which is what he is). He then scoffed <br/>
at my own inability to solve some problem.<br/>
It was, if a+b=1000, and a is 150 more than b, what are a and b.<br/>
I could have done it 15 years ago when I was at school and doing <br/>
maths daily. But not now.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him when in real life would I ever need that ability. To get <br/>
exams he said.<br/>
Therefore his argument is you need to study maths to pass the <br/>
exams.<br/>
Now, he has a small point in that in the UK you need GCSE maths <br/>
(taken at 16) in order to get nearly every job, even the dead-end <br/>
ones and you will be passed over in favour of another applicant if <br/>
you don&#39;t have it.<br/>
I personally think you shouldn&#39;t take exams if you don&#39;t want too, <br/>
and if the child wishes to learn maths in order to get that piece of <br/>
paper then they will do so when the motivation is there. It also <br/>
seems pointless learning things like quadratic equations. The only <br/>
use they serve is too pass that exam. That appears to be their <br/>
function!!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t feel I can elucidate my arguments well in favour of the <br/>
children doing or not doing maths as they wish too. He turns into a <br/>
logical mathematician when I try to speak and I feel unable to <br/>
explain &#39;feeling&#39; in a way that makes sense. Which is why I&#39;m <br/>
turning to you lot for help.<br/>
Why is it necassary to learn something that you are only learning <br/>
to get a bit of paper that is irrelevant to everyday life and who they <br/>
are?<br/>
He is starting to push them, especially DD as once upon a time <br/>
she was 6 years ahead of her age group in maths and now she is <br/>
no longer. This is, of course, my fault. For Homeschooling and for <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
waaaaaaaah<br/>

**She goes. Why would being unschooled all her life be a problem?**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**I never said it was a problem! That&#39;s YOUR interpretation. I was actually<br/>
asking for people&#39;s opinion on how they have managed with this (if they <br/>
always had to take an exam to be admitted, etc.). That&#39;s all.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh for gosh sakes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course it&#39;s MY interpretration. You didn&#39;t give us a heck of a lot to work <br/>
on to figure out what you were &quot;actually asking&quot; for. Did you want to know <br/>
about transcripts or how the heck they pass exams if they&#39;ve never done them <br/>
before or how will they handle the discipline or can they be accepted or or <br/>
or.... well. You just asked, what if? My logical interpretation was that you <br/>
felt there might be some problem, impediment, concern, something different <br/>
from regular ordinary decisions about college, caused by unschooling. So gee, <br/>
I asked a question, and then gave short answers to a few possible <br/>
interpretations of what if. Sorry. I figured it was a nicer question than <br/>
asking What do you mean, what if? but I guess should have stuck to <br/>
straightforward.<br/>
<br/>
As for your expanded question, it depends. It depends for everyone, not just <br/>
unschoolers. Most colleges do require SAT or ACT scores, but there&#39;s no <br/>
reason unschoolers can&#39;t take and do well on the them. If they don&#39;t want to <br/>
take them they can concentrate their search on colleges that don&#39;t require <br/>
them. Just like any other college applicant. Unschoolers will probably need <br/>
to work a little harder at putting together transcripts or other <br/>
documentation of learning experiences than most applicants, but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be what you&#39;re asking, unless that&#39;s covered by etc.?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a long long time since I let a stranger hurt my feelings with a <br/>
response on an email list. :::sigh::: Time to go no mail and deal with the <br/>
stress. &quot;See&quot; you all later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>(BTW, I was curious - a would be 575, b would be 425 - I LOVE those things<br/>
lol) Could you find out exactly what is on that exam he&#39;s talking about, and<br/>
sit down and type up a list of how the kids can learn each thing in real<br/>
life? Then explain how quickly they could learn the rest on their own if<br/>
they chose to do so later, in order to take the exam?<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;ve posted this here before, just skip it.<br/>
A number of years ago, there were a couple of unschooled boys in the<br/>
Vancouver area who decided they wanted to go on to university.  They were<br/>
typical unschooled kids as far as their math knowledge went.  They hired a<br/>
tutor and had learned *all* of high school math in a matter of months.<br/>

&gt; also,  Linear equations, quadratics, trig, Algebraic Expressions of<br/>
&gt; functions, Radical equations, geomatry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, I remember learning all that stuff!  I don&#39;t remember where I forgot<br/>
it, but I definitely have.  I do get a lot of use out of algebra in real<br/>
life.  I use the 6 out of 91 = x out of 100 to find percentages pretty<br/>
regularly.  But I&#39;d be hard pressed to explain why the rest of it was<br/>
necessary.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there any way you can take this problem and put it in your husband&#39;s lap<br/>
entirely?  Maybe announce that if he, in fact, truly believes that it&#39;s<br/>
necessary, you&#39;d like *him* to work with the children on it.  Remind him<br/>
that they&#39;re used to understanding why they need things, so he&#39;ll find them<br/>
most receiptve if he can really show them all the facinating ways these<br/>
concepts are used in physics, molecular biology, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I guess that&#39;s not totally unschooling, since he&#39;d be introducing the<br/>
concepts to them without them necessarily caring, but at the very least it<br/>
moves the problem from your world to his.  Surely the kids will cheerily<br/>
tell him that he&#39;s boring the pants off them if he gets to that point...!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130900329">Hi Shyrley,<br/>
              you could explain it in terms of say another subject  say <br/>
cooking for example. You&#39;re not teaching them haute cuisine at home just in <br/>
case they want to be a chef later. You may help them with basic skills and <br/>
they&#39;ll learn that from life...you&#39;re not making them cook crown of lamb <br/>
with celeriac mash and a curuacoa (sp) mousse with flambeed raspberries  or <br/>
whatever just in case they decide to be a chef....if they want to be a chef <br/>
they&#39;ll discover the joy of cooking and have motivation to go and train <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
The same applies with mathematics. Anyway it only takes 9 months to do GCSE <br/>
maths from scratch in the UK post 16 and I haven&#39;t even taken out the time <br/>
for half terms and easter and xmas holidays. Lots of adults who haven&#39;t done <br/>
any mathematics for years and years  go and do GCSE maths at an evening <br/>
class and pass no problem. They could probably do GCSE maths postal at some <br/>
point if they wanted to and take significantly less time. If the very basic <br/>
of basics are there then they&#39;ll pass GCSE maths no problem. It&#39;s really not <br/>
a big deal, he&#39;s panicking  for nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Can you think of a subject he hates that you could apply the above to? <br/>
That&#39;d be a good example for him<br/>

they learn math for the bit of paper, so that&#39;s why your arguments aren&#39;t<br/>
reaching him. His concern is that he *knows* to the core of his being that<br/>
it takes 10+ years at 5 hours per week to acquire all the math necessary for<br/>
the exams. So, even if they don&#39;t use the higher math, it&#39;s important in<br/>
terms of time that they start learning now so they&#39;ll have it in case they<br/>
do want to use it.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s wrong, but there isn&#39;t an easy route to help him see that he&#39;s wrong. I<br/>
could not picture unschooling math until I could see it happening with my<br/>
daughter. Now I can see that natural acquisition of math is a totally<br/>
different process than how math gets taught in school. I can see huge<br/>
similarities between naturally acquiring math and English by using them and<br/>
learning math and Spanish in school. And how the first is effortless and<br/>
works without formal understanding, and the second is often a source of<br/>
frustration and people who never want to see either math or Spanish again.<br/>
<br/>
Marilyn Burns has written a few books on children acquiring math naturally.<br/>
She talks about them discovering their own algorithms. (That&#39;s math speak<br/>
for figuring out how to do something themselves ;-) So rather than teaching<br/>
them the process of borrowing and carrying, kids figure out various ways the<br/>
numbers can be manipulated in order to get the answer.<br/>
<br/>
(As an example, in school they&#39;d teach a child that to subtract 4.99 from<br/>
6.00 you need to borrow a 1 from the 6 to subtract the 99 from. Which makes<br/>
no real sense. But a child can more easily picture temporarily bumping 4.99<br/>
up to 5, subtracting 5 from 6 to get 1. And then, since 4.99 is further from<br/>
6 than 5 (or however they picture it) knowing that the extra penny we<br/>
borrowed has to be added to the 1 for 1.01. It *sounds* complex written out,<br/>
but it makes a lot of intuitive sense when you have to do arithmetic in your<br/>
head.)<br/>
<br/>
I liked Elaine&#39;s comparison to haute cuisine :-)<br/>
<br/>
And Brenda&#39;s idea of him showing them the joy in math so they can have<br/>
experience with it being fun and intriging. The problem is that he might not<br/>
care if they like math or not. He&#39;s only concerned that they get the<br/>
practice time in that he&#39;s certain is necessary. But if you express that if<br/>
they experience math through enjoyable experiences with the really cool<br/>
stuff like fractals and Fibonacci numbers and so forth then they&#39;ll be more<br/>
likely to want to know more.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps if he looks at it this way: if his primary goal is to get math into<br/>
them, enjoyment will get sacrificed for practice and they&#39;ll try to spend as<br/>
little time as possible on math. But if his goal is for them to enjoy the<br/>
time spent with him *and* math, then they all win because the number of<br/>
hours they spend willingly on math will voluntarily increase. And they&#39;ll<br/>
enjoy spending time with him too :-)<br/>

scratch. It is, after all, the exam 16 year olds take.<br/>
It&#39;s generally a required GCSE for the english jobs market so most <br/>
people make an attempt at it.<br/>
A level maths (16-18) is taken by a minority of the population. I <br/>
didn&#39;t take it, it wasn&#39;t necassary to have A level maths to do the <br/>
university course I was gonna do (BioChemistry).<br/>
Englsih kids take only 3 A levels (usually) so most of the <br/>
population finish with maths at 16.<br/>
(Admittedly GCSE maths in the UK covers what High Scool <br/>
teaches here but it still ain&#39;t hard and certainly doesn&#39;t require 10 <br/>
years of learning)<br/>

Everytime I didn&#39;t understand he accused me of being stupid <br/>
deliberately just to annoy him :-)<br/>
Nope, I said, I *am* this stupid. Unfortunately he rates somewhere <br/>
near genius level when it comes to maths and physics and can&#39;t <br/>

*normal* at maths.<br/>

&gt; Everytime I didn&#39;t understand he accused me of being stupid <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can sympathize! I remember switching from electrical engineering to <br/>
business in college and trying to understand debits and credits. It did<br/>
not make logical sense to me until something clicked and viola, I understood.<br/>
In the meantime dh was beating his head against the wall trying to help<br/>
me understand. I learned that dh is NOT who I wanted to teach me anything!<br/>
<br/>
He tends to get things on the first try and does not like it when others don&#39;t.<br/>
I remember him coming home from classes complaining about the stupid questions<br/>
everyone was asking. And my MIL says that he absolutely hated doing any kind<br/>
of drill in school and always asked why he had to do it if he understood it.<br/>
<br/>
I use these examples when I have to remind him why we are homeschooling. :o)<br/>
