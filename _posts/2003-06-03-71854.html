They aren&#39;t &quot;playing&quot; at anything, they&#39;re having a relationship.<br/>

Fortunately Tara and I still talk a lot. I think I used that term in front<br/>
of her once when I was telling her about a conversation I had with her dad.<br/>
I was trying to get him to understand her. Total waste of time but I<br/>
digress. She understands that I know how she feels about this relationship.<br/>
They are in love and I understand that. She knows that. I never downplay<br/>
what she feels or does because of her age.<br/>
<br/>
On a good note, her and her boyfriend are here tonight. I think she&#39;s trying<br/>
to break me in gently!!! LOL!!!<br/>
We finally got her title to her car today and Joe took her out driving on<br/>
the interstate and also tonight in &quot;her&quot; car. She&#39;s getting real excited and<br/>
I am so happy for her. She&#39;s been waiting so patiently for this to happen.<br/>
We&#39;re hoping the car will be done within the next month. Time for me to sort<br/>
out one of my birds flying farther.<br/>
