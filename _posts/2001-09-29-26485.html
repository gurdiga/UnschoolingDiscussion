&gt; I love some of the things you have to say, I have told you so in<br/>
&gt; personal email. . . I have said so onlist when I felt so inclined. Yet,<br/>
&gt; anytime I disagree with you, you pounce on me. Please don&#39;t insult me by<br/>
&gt; saying you aren&#39;t having a conversation with me. . . you are by posting my<br/>
&gt; words and then saying they mean something other than what I actually said.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people argue ideas, some personalities. The most recent exchange has<br/>
been an argument against ideas. If others had posted the same ideas, it<br/>
would be the same scenario.<br/>
<br/>
You should see me argue with my husband. Last time I actually said to him,<br/>
&quot;cite your sources&quot;. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has called you a boogerhead, there&#39;s just honest disagreement with an<br/>
argument. There is no need (MHO) for anybody anywhere to &quot;just agree to<br/>
disagree&quot; -- that action is accomplished, not stated, when one of the<br/>
parties quits the argument (hence, agrees to disagree).<br/>
