<div id="ygrps-yiv-1728388973">Yesterday, my 9 yos had a friend over for the day. He lives a bit <br/>
far away and I had to pick him up somewhat early in the morning. <br/>
Since I know that this family is &quot;school at home&quot; in style, I offered <br/>
to &quot;do&quot; some of the child&#39;s schoolwork with him at our house so <br/>
that she&#39;d feel comfortable letting him come for the day midweek <br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
She gave me one sheet of math word problems. :) She knew that <br/>
play was much higher on the list for these boys than lots of <br/>
books. I was grateful.<br/>
<br/>
But we did sit down after lunch to tackle those word problems.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where it got interesting. This little boy (8 yo) began <br/>
working these problems (triple digit subtraction that required <br/>
borrowing) without much need for help. My son (who had already <br/>
declared that he wasn&#39;t going to stop his day for &quot;school&quot;) joined <br/>
us at the table and looked at the math sheet. Then he got <br/>
interested. I pulled out a piece of paper and told him he was free <br/>
to do the same problems if he wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
So he wrote down the first problem... wrote three of the numbers <br/>
backwards, he put a line between the two numbers being <br/>
subtracted (instead of one line under them both) and never did <br/>
any borrowing...<br/>
<br/>
and got the right answer.<br/>
<br/>
He did the next two problems almost entirely in his head (one of <br/>
them involved subtracting the same number 7 times (what an <br/>
idiotic problem! Can you imagine a page of problems like that? <br/>
Isn&#39;t that what a calculator or the power of division is for?).<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing was that at one point, the other little boy finished <br/>
a problem really quickly while I was momentarily out of the room. <br/>
My son came dejectedly to me saying he wasn&#39;t getting it. I <br/>
followed them back to the papers and as it turned out, the first <br/>
boy didn&#39;t understand the problem... had not finished it at all. In <br/>
the meantime, my son had gotten most of the way through it and <br/>
mostly correctly. He didn&#39;t know there would be anything left over <br/>
at the end. That was it!<br/>
<br/>
My son used all kinds of strategies for subtracting I had never <br/>
taught him:<br/>
<br/>
110-34=?<br/>
<br/>
Well, mom, first you take 30 from 100 and get 70. Then you add <br/>
10 and get 80 then subtract 4 and get 76. <br/>
<br/>
Huh?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not done math with this kid. But he gets it. :) In fact, it&#39;s me <br/>
who doesn&#39;t really have a clue what we&#39;re doing. I had to check <br/>
his sound answer with paper and borrowing because I didn&#39;t <br/>
understand what he did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-117493651">Julie, this is SO COOL! I love hearing stories like this, because of <br/>
the encouragement that THEY WILL &quot;GET IT&quot; and because...there&#39;s <br/>
similar stuff going on around here.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, a human interest story on the news the other day, was about <br/>
a man who paid over $100 in parking tickets, using pennies. My mom, <br/>
the public school teacher, said &quot;How many pennies is that, Robby?&quot; <br/>
and he looked up for a half second and said &quot;Ten thousand&quot; heh heh<br/>
<br/>
without anyone teaching it to him.<br/>

Well by &quot;teaching&quot; you mean &quot;presenting.&quot;<br/>

I bet they can get kids to shut down about that too if they push and test and <br/>
shame and push and review and shame as has been going on for so many years <br/>

I can&#39;t help feeling that in a similar situation I would be discouraging<br/>
my mother from feeling she had the right to be testing Jayn. I also<br/>
notice that Jayn tends to just look at the rare people who ask her<br/>
questions dishonestly, and I sometimes don&#39;t know whether she knows the<br/>
answer or not. Often it is something I know she does understand. I<br/>
usually say immediately, &quot;Jayn won&#39;t be a performing a monkey&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I KNOW IT. It&#39;s frustrating to me, too. I&#39;m getting there, slow but <br/>
sure, but have a lifetime of weenie-ness to overcome. Actually, we&#39;re <br/>
going through it something fierce right now, from everyone, about <br/>
Abbie&#39;s high school. She is sophomore age, and I have people telling <br/>
me she HAS to learn algebra, and what about chemistry, and how will <br/>
she get into any college, and so forth, ad infinitum, ad nauseum.<br/>
<br/>
We roll our eyeballs and say &quot;if she wants to go to college, she&#39;ll <br/>
find out what the actual requirements ARE, and she&#39;ll find an algebra <br/>
class to take. If she discovers some latent passion for a major that <br/>
has chemistry as a requirement, I imagine she&#39;ll scope out a way to <br/>
get chemistry learned.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The ironic thing is, when my mom first started teaching, her angle <br/>
was much more &quot;natural learning&quot; than it is now, after 20 years in <br/>
the system. I remember a discussion about helping kids find their <br/>
passion, not forcing them to swallow factoids to spit back out onto a <br/>
test paper. Becuase &quot;There is so much information in the world. How <br/>
can you choose what is to be learned? Why not teach them how to <br/>
think, and let them learn what they want?&quot; (Btw, I was on the other <br/>
side of the fence at this time, hooked on phonics, wishing the <br/>
schools would concentrate on the basics, do more drill, memorize <br/>
history dates...barf)<br/>
<br/>
*sigh* Teach them how to think. Right. In between bells, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
anyway...thanks for the heads up, Robyn. I&#39;m getting there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587068044">Oh my!<br/>
<br/>
Do you realize just WHO those math questions, in the article you <br/>
linked here, came from? LOL I&#39;m laughing REALLY HARD at myself, here.<br/>
<br/>
wow. What a different person I am today, than I was in January, when <br/>
I was asking those questions. I was getting ready to pass this link <br/>
on to my mom, who is pressuring us (esp. my 15 year old) to get her <br/>
into algebra NOW, so she can get into college. Thinking &quot;Okay, this <br/>
would answer a lot of her questions&quot;...and then came to the one about <br/>
algebra. From there on, it&#39;s ME!<br/>
<br/>
I still might do it. &quot;Here, mom. This is our philosophy, these are <br/>
the questions I was asking at the turn of the year, and the answers.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;flavor&quot; of this list was too &quot;spicy&quot; for me at that time, so I <br/>
unsubbed for a little while, but didn&#39;t go back to &quot;making&quot; my kids <br/>
do academics. Just watched. It was during that time that Katie, age <br/>
8, took her math workbook into a little tent she had made for <br/>
herself. She wanted to work some problems. I was folding laundry, and <br/>
she called me to come help her with something. &quot;Just a sec.&quot; I was in <br/>
the middle of a bed sheet.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Never mind,&quot; came her soon reply. When I did get in there, two <br/>
minutes later, she said &quot;Mom, is this right? 6 minus 4 equals 2, <br/>
right?&quot; &quot;yep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and she explained to me, how she did it. &quot;I knew it! because, 4 plus <br/>
2 equals 6, and I just reversed it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is when I was convinced that I never need &quot;make&quot; my kids &quot;do <br/>
math&quot; EVER again. Now, with all this external pressure about algebra <br/>
and my teenaged daughter, I&#39;m more than tempted to send that article <br/>
my mom&#39;s way. Explain to her the changes in my own philosophy, and <br/>
why. *gulp*<br/>
<br/>
take the plunge? admit, we&#39;re following a natural learning path, not <br/>
an artificial construct of the system? to an apostle of the system?<br/>
<br/>
*gulp* help me! I&#39;m a weeenie!<br/>
<br/>

I went to college right after high school because my mom had decided I would.  It wasn&#39;t that I didn&#39;t want to go, it was simply a matter of believing, after years of hearing it, that I would go to college.  I did great in the classes that I didn&#39;t drop, and I dropped a bunch because they did not interest me.  I did NOT go back in the fall, because I started doing something else that summer and it was of much more interest to me.  I did go back to college many years later.  Although parts of it were drudgery and obvious &quot;jumping through hoops&quot; to get the degree, overall the experience was great because *I* had a reason to be there.  A goal of my own.  It makes all the difference in the world.<br/>
