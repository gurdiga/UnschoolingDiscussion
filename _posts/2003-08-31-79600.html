<div id="ygrps-yiv-1837558500"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Are you suggesting that I shouldn&#39;t even ASK them to help, either?  <br/>
&gt; Even if they are free to say no?  Because I say, &quot;Would you like to<br/>
&gt; help me by cleaning the cat box?  and they don&#39;t mind saying, &quot;No, I<br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t like to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it&#39;s kind of a silly question if you think about it. :)<br/>
<br/>
What happens if you say instead, &quot;I could really use some help cleaning this<br/>
living room, can one of you give me a hand when you get a moment? I&#39;d really<br/>
appreciate it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you regularly ask in such a way and regularly don&#39;t receive any help, I&#39;d<br/>
say you need to get the family together for a talk about why they don&#39;t feel<br/>
any desire to help you, and examine what you may be doing that causes them<br/>
to NOT want to help, such as:<br/>
<br/>
1. Nagging<br/>
2. Sighing in a put-upon fashion about the mess as you drag yourself<br/>
muttering through the clean-up<br/>
3. Letting the mess go for awhile and then getting sick of it and leaping to<br/>
your feet to suddenly clean and expecting everyone else to leap, too<br/>
<br/>
and get it sorted out. Dr. Phil says, &quot;relationships are managed, not cured&quot;<br/>
which means that talking these things out is an ongoing process, not a<br/>
one-off problem fixed forever.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I clean the downstairs of our house every morning. It doesn&#39;t<br/>
take long, we have a small house. &lt;g&gt; My daughters pick up their own room<br/>
now (this is new, like for the past week) every evening. This was by my<br/>
request, made kindly with a reasonable explanation about my own busy<br/>
schedule vs. falling all over toys in my quest to kiss them good night or<br/>
close their window. ;) I asked if they&#39;d be willing to do it, they were.<br/>
They asked if it got REALLY messy would I help. I assured them I would. I<br/>
also offered to organize their bins of toys by &quot;type&quot; once a week or so,<br/>
which they thought was a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
I asked what was a good time of day, and they gave this some serious thought<br/>
and came up with 7:30 p.m. I asked if I could remind them if they forgot,<br/>
and they said yes. So about half the time they&#39;ve remembered and about half<br/>
the time I&#39;ve reminded them. One night they said, &quot;Okay, after this show&quot;<br/>
and I said fine and it was fine. One night they may say, &quot;We&#39;re really<br/>
tired&quot; and I will offer to help or do it entirely or find some other<br/>
reasonable solution.<br/>
<br/>
If they come to me in a week and say, &quot;We&#39;re sick of cleaning our room&quot;<br/>
we&#39;ll figure out something else. When they get older if they want privacy or<br/>
WANT to keep their rooms in 10 inches of clothing, well, it&#39;s their room.<br/>
<br/>
What is said isn&#39;t as important as how it&#39;s said. Figuring out comfortable<br/>
ways to live with several other people is NOT always an easy matter. Turning<br/>
into a martyr or a dictator are both bad solutions to the problem. Figuring<br/>
out ways to work together toward our individual and group goals, without me<br/>
asserting that I&#39;m &quot;right&quot; and they&#39;re &quot;wrong&quot; because I like the house<br/>
neater than my children do is a good starting point.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; My older son is 18, when is this desire to help out supposed to kick<br/>
&gt; in?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d expect these things depend on the child, the family, and the dynamics of<br/>
the relationship, as well as the child&#39;s own &quot;inner neatness&quot; barometer. I<br/>
was a rare slob until I had a house of my own, in spite of chore charts,<br/>
rewards, punishments, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If you help him with what he considers important TO HIM (i.e, helping him by<br/>
washing his socks doesn&#39;t count unless he&#39;s a sock fanatic who cannot<br/>
achieve pristine whiteness on his own and is therefore truly grateful to<br/>
you) will cause him to want to help you with what is important TO YOU. Going<br/>
out of your way to aid him in his pursuits is more likely to cause him to<br/>
want to go out of HIS way to aid you in yours, including cleaning the cat<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
Karma: What goes around comes around.<br/>
The Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.<br/>
Physics: For every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all the same.<br/>
