<div id="ygrps-yiv-1222054591">Hi,<br/>
  We&#39;ve been pretty busy out of the house this week, hitting garage sales and <br/>
running errands. Trevor is really into world geography right now and has been <br/>
playing some free US and world games I downloaded at yourchildlearns.com. He <br/>
knows where many obscure (at least to me!) world landmarks are and uses the <br/>
world map on the wall a lot. <br/>
  We went to the Van Gogh exhibit at the art museum yesterday..really cool. <br/>
Our tour guide was sorta dull but she did mention the red poppies that Van <br/>
Gogh included in some of his paintings and we had fun finding them. Trevor <br/>
didn&#39;t care much about all the paintings of fields but he really like the <br/>
poster of The Starry Night we asw in the gift shop.<br/>
  We&#39;re going to dissect our owl pellets this afternoon before I go into <br/>
work. <br/>
