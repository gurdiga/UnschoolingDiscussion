<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060413723">I&#39;m glad people are able to talk about this.  I don&#39;t know how you all are <br/>
&quot;surviving&quot;.  My parents lost a 7 week old baby (31?) years ago to spinal <br/>
menigitis.  I was 5 at the time.  I remember very little about my young childhood, <br/>
but I have vivid memories of the night my dad found her in bed.  <br/>
<br/>
To this day, I MISS MY LITTLE SIS very dearly.  I&#39;m the only one (well, <br/>
besides one aunt) who knows where she is burried, exactly.  My parents didn&#39;t want <br/>
to know at the time, so we didn&#39;t (and, Catholics don&#39;t hold that tradition <br/>
anyway) go to the grave site.  And actually, she&#39;s burried on the plot of my <br/>
great grandparents.  There are 3 other babies in the grave (they used to do that, <br/>
too, but, they don&#39;t do that anymore).  We always thought there were only 2 <br/>
others in the grave, but, when I went to the Cemetary, oh, I don&#39;t know, 18 <br/>
years ago, to find exactly where she is (no grave marker & didn&#39;t know where my <br/>
great grandparents were), I was told about the 3rd.  Now we know who it is.  <br/>
The baby was the child of a neighbor friend of my grandparents.  When the baby <br/>
died, they didn&#39;t have a plot nor could they afford one at the time (same as my <br/>
parents), so my great grandma let them put the baby on their plot.  I would <br/>
love to get a tomb stone for my sister, unfortunately, I can&#39;t.  We have to <br/>
have the WRITTEN permission of ALL of the families w/babies in that plot; we can <br/>
only track down 3 (including us) of the 4 :-(.  We don&#39;t know where the <br/>
surviving family members of the neighbor are.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a little kid, I had these dreams about my little sis (Lydia Sue).  <br/>
I used to dream (almost everynight for a while up to the age of 10 or so, and <br/>
then reoccuring well past my 20&#39;s) that Mary (mother of Jesus) would be <br/>
standing there, and in her arms was my sis.  <br/>
<br/>
I know some of you are not religious, and I&#39;m not trying to throw my beliefs <br/>
at you.  Just wanted to share my story.  I really feel for all you parents.  I <br/>
know how I felt being the sister, so I KNOW it must be harder for the rest of <br/>
you.  My thoughts (prayers if you want them) to ALL OF YOU & YOUR FAMILIES!<br/>
<br/>
Tracy<br/>
PS:  I just went to visit my lil-sis a few weeks ago; it had been years. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know about anyone else but I thought that was really nice and not<br/>
religious at all. My mom had 7 premature babies in the late 50&#39;s and early<br/>
60&#39;s then she adopted my sister and I (yes I am adopted and I adopted<br/>
children). I am not sure how my mom did it because it would have killed me.<br/>
I look at Herne and I think about the son I lost and I know all is as it was<br/>
meant to be. But some days I miss Ben a great deal.<br/>
