&lt;&lt;Mary - I actually &quot;borrowed&quot; portions of that email that circulated and<br/>
put it in my own resume when I was going back to work, to explain the &quot;gaps&quot;<br/>
in employment outside the home.  : )  I got about 5 calls within 2 days<br/>
after posting my &quot;new&quot; resume on Monster.  LOL!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yeah that was the one!! Good for you!!!<br/>

Thanks you, thank you, thank you for this!!  I am planning to try to <br/>
go back to grad school next fall.  They require a letter on what you <br/>
have been doing that has relevance to the field.  Well, I do lots of <br/>
things, including working in my husbands business.  I was worried <br/>
about how to turn being at home into something positive on paper, you <br/>
just did it for me!!  IF you have no objections to copyrights..&lt;g&gt; <br/>
than I will be using this in the future!<br/>

Excellent point.  I was planning to include all the work I do with my <br/>
husband, but since it is our own business I was concerned about how <br/>
they would &quot;see&quot; that.  First, I tend to be a worrywart..LOL!  <br/>
Second, with all the school beauracracy, it certainly never gets any <br/>
better the higher up you go!  I am looking to get a degree in mental <br/>
health counseling and specialize in marriage counseling.  However, <br/>
for some odd reason (chalk it up to the practical decisions schools <br/>
make) their mental health track is in the department of Education!  I <br/>
am not sure how they will take my letter filled with references to <br/>
homeschooling LOL!  Not that I am too concerned about that, I am <br/>
proud of my choice and feel pretty good about arguing it need be.<br/>
