No one can vaccinate your baby or circumsize them without your consent. Keep <br/>
your baby with you and they won&#39;t have any choice about it! I never had any <br/>
problems with that stuff though. And I have two totally unvaccinated kids, one <br/>
that started and I stopped them, the other got the full round before I had <br/>
researched it enough. :( poor guy. <br/>
Recently our youngest had his 1 yr shots and it was cruel the way they did <br/>
it, I thought. I had a read a little about them not needing them but hadn&#39;t read <br/>
enough about it to know the risks and legalities. Several days later he came <br/>
down with a high fever and has been grumpy since :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168312507">Ok thanks.  I thought it was something like that.  I had wondered if I was having some sort of mental blip and not understanding something that was perfectly clear.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Vac thing I&#39;m sooo on the fence about it.  Didn&#39;t know anything about the controversy with the first,  gave into pressures with the second and while at the office watched as a small girl had a bad reaction to her shot.  Now I have days when I feel obligated or guilty for not vaxing the two wee ones and think it would be no big deal.  So I start hunting down the smart vax info on the net which brings me back to the &quot;no way&quot; can this be safe side and I go over my how to live without vaxing info..<br/>
<br/>
It is very hard to live with the barrage from both sides.  Each saying they are the right and good side with one major difference in the literature.  The anti vax side wants you to get informed and make your own decision based on all the info you can find.  The pro vax side will not even effectively inform the people who are in charge of administering the Vaccines about all possible complications etc.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>

three foot (very thin) metal lead was passed down her nose into her lung for a <br/>
sample for a test for whopping cough.  At that moment, I wondered if I had <br/>

<br/>
For the rest of the time, I&#39;m fully confident in my decision to not vaccinate <br/>
my children, the oldest was the only one to be vaccinated, I was an <br/>
uninformed mother then, listening to my very own mother and I should have known better.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, my goodness!<br/>
I&#39;ve just been through whooping cough and they determined it solely through <br/>
a medical history.  They asked me questions about my symptoms, etc, <br/>
diagnosed it and prescribed some meds (that they promised would probably be <br/>
ineffective if it was whooping cough (and not something else) and for the <br/>
most part, were quite ineffective... which confirmed their <br/>
diagnosis.)  (Besides, the tests for WC are notoriously inaccurate!)<br/>
<br/>
If the rest of your kids ever come down with whooping cough, you should <br/>
know that it can be (and usually is!) diagnosed through a simple medical <br/>
history and symptoms.<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry you and your daughter went through that and didn&#39;t know you <br/>
could resist!  ...But now you DO know and can protect your other kids from <br/>
such institutional-medical-insanity.<br/>
