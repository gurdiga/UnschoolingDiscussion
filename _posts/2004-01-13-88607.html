OK I am on a messege board for people with small babies. I found that there <br/>
were some homeschoolers there, so we talked about our schooling and I told <br/>
them that I unschooled. Now some of the other group members have kinda told <br/>
me that its wrong and just now one of them told me that only people with <br/>
higher education should unschool, and that you must be a very smart person <br/>
to unschool. Do all of you have higher education and are you &quot;Gifted&quot;. One <br/>
girl told me that I was limited and that I shouldnt homeschool/unschool <br/>
cause Im holding my son back.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I have my high school degree and that just barely. :) I don&#39;t know why they think what they do but they don&#39;t seem to know what they&#39;re talking about. Gifted? I doubt it it. Curious, yes. And I think that&#39;s a big plus to unschooling.<br/>
  I&#39;d  ask them why they thought we needed a higher education and share their reasons here. Could use the laugh. :)<br/>

Hi --<br/>
<br/>
I think your friend shouldn&#39;t run around giving that kind of advice <br/>
because she is holding YOU back. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is more about being willing to learn than it is about <br/>
already knowing all the right answers.  I think you&#39;ll do fine.<br/>
<br/>
Being the person in the world who cares most about your son is what will <br/>
enable you to do a great job of meeting his needs.  Schools just can&#39;t <br/>
personalize what they offer the way parents can.<br/>
