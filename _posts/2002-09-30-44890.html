pills---before the larvae have turned into actual worms. If he&#39;s horribly <br/>
infested though, the pills can kill him. Check with your vet on this one--and <br/>
one who&#39;s interested in the new info and is willing to try this. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How old? Probably not. It&#39;s a slow, miserable death. If he&#39;s already old and <br/>
debilitated, I&#39;d personally let it ride. It&#39;s an arsenic treatment---THAT can <br/>
kill them too!<br/>
<br/>
Heartworm is prevalent whereever you have water/humidity/heat=mosquitos. <br/>
You&#39;re almost guaranteed the bug, Shyrley! Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
As to the food, I can&#39;t imagine if you&#39;re diligent with what/how you feed him <br/>
that your dog would get fat. My dogs, GSD & beagle, eat whatever scraps we <br/>
have. I decrease their dry food when I add scraps. Been doing this to <br/>
different dogs/different breeds for over 30 years. NEVER a fat dog! Not even <br/>
the beagle!!! I just wish someone would do that for me! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not one has ever chosen NOT to eat in order to wait for table scraps. It goes <br/>
in their bowls with their regular kibble. Some meals they get some, some not. <br/>
It&#39;s breakfast and supper, not &quot;dessert&quot;. They don&#39;t beg because all meals <br/>
are served in their bowls. They may be a little more &quot;excited&quot; about meals <br/>
with mac & cheese or rice & gravy or steak, but it&#39;s all just food to them.<br/>
<br/>
I show my dogs, so weight is very important. I wouldn&#39;t take any chances with <br/>
a finicky eater or a fat dog. Never happens. They eat what&#39;s in front of them <br/>
in less than two minutes--no matter WHAT&#39;s in front of them!<br/>
<br/>
Chocolate IS toxic to dogs: a Chihuahua can die/be very ill if he eats a <br/>
Hershey bar---it&#39;s a weight thing. Years ago before I knew about it, my <br/>
Weimaraners would get a bag of M&M&#39;s to share for their birthdays. None ever <br/>
got sick. Would I do it again? Nope. A Bullmastiff would have to eat a LOT of <br/>
M&M&#39;s to even feel nauseous. I wouldn&#39;t purposefully give my dogs chocolate, <br/>
but I don&#39;t freak when they raid the fudge plate (I just remove the slimy <br/>
ones and place it higher!&lt;G&gt;)<br/>
