&lt;&lt; since opium is so <br/>
addictive, medicine isn&#39;t made from opium derivatives anymore.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is peregoric no longer available then?<br/>
<br/>
I got a prescription once when I had THE worst diahrhea ever.  Thought I <br/>
would die.<br/>
<br/>
But that was around 1980.<br/>
<br/>
My mom said one of her aunts used to line her children up EVERY NIGHT and <br/>
give them peregoric so they would sleep better.<br/>
<br/>
Uh huh...  That was when it was over the counter stuff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know! I looked in my most recent pharmaceutical book and couldn&#39;t <br/>
find it, so I went and found one from 1983. It is (was?) prescribed as an <br/>
analgesic and an antidiarrheal. Also given to children suffering from colic. <br/>
(news to me! WOW!) It is funny, well not funny haha funny that you got <br/>
diarrhea from it! And I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if your great-aunt didn&#39;t have <br/>
a hard time getting her kids to sleep giving her kids that every night! She <br/>
must have had to keep upping the dose. Ugh! Reminds me of the woman who came <br/>
into the ER one night with her baby, she didn&#39;t understand that you couldn&#39;t <br/>
give a baby Nyquil just to get him to sleep! Her mother had given them things <br/>
when she was a kid, what was wrong with it? <br/>
