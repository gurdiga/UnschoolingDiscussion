I have autoimmune issues, and won&#39;t get the flu shot because I didn&#39;t HAVE <br/>
autoimmune issues, until after getting my first (and only) flu shot. Of course <br/>
I&#39;m not positive that the flu shot was resonsible, but I can&#39;t help but wonder <br/>
sometimes. Anyway, my point is that my family has not had the flu in a few <br/>
years now, which is pretty considerable since (1) we live in military housing and <br/>
99% of my kids friends last year had this totally awful flu bug, nasty colds, <br/>
chicken pox, etc...and (2) we are a big family.  A few years ago we started <br/>
taking ionic minerals, then coconut oil (me especially) and other immune <br/>
boosters. There is something you can buy in a health food store called SAMBUCOL. <br/>
It&#39;s from Israel and it&#39;s wonderful! Last year I remember feeling the flu coming <br/>
on; a little fever and headache and stomach ache, took some sambucol & <br/>
minerals before going to bed, and was able to &#39;head it off at the pass&#39; and woke up <br/>
feeling wonderful the next morning. Also, one last thing that is wonderful is <br/>
this stuff called &quot;Oscillococcinum&quot;. I would also take that at the first sign <br/>
of flu. In the box it says it&#39;s the #1 OTC flu medicine in France, and the #1 <br/>
homeopathic flu medicine in the U.S. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091659584">we recently began taking Sambucol and feel its an excellent product! <br/>
elderberries work as an anti-viral (main ingredient in Sambucol). <br/>
had heard so much great news about this elderberry product. it was <br/>
develped by a Virologist. also another super product is Emer&#39;gen C. <br/>
its the best vitamin C we&#39;ve ever taken! it also has 32 mineral <br/>
complexes and B vitamins.    <br/>
