&gt; How sweet. :o) My husband was once mistaken for Jason Alexander (the <br/>
&gt; guy who played George Costanza on Seinfeld.) He was walking down the <br/>
&gt; street during the Sundance Film Festival and somebody across the <br/>
&gt; street starting yelling &quot;Hey George!&quot;<br/>

baseball cap. (She has this weird thing about Smokey-- wanted to be Smokey when <br/>
she was growing up). She&#39;s not usually a baseball cap kinda gal, but she loves <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
One day her hair had gotten a bit shaggy and she was weraing her glasses <br/>
(usually wears contacts), and she had the cap on.<br/>
<br/>
She looked exactly like Michael Moore. <br/>
