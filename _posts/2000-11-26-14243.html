&lt;&lt; We found that the older boy was generally willing to include the younger <br/>
in <br/>
 most of his projects.  In fact, the older son often taught the younger <br/>
 something about what he was doing.  I&#39;m convinced it helped the older boy <br/>
 learn even more because he was having to explain what he was doing, either <br/>
to <br/>
 convince little brother to leave him alone or to include him in the <br/>
 activities.  Either way it became teaching opportunities &gt;&gt;<br/>

Thank you Eiraul for sharing. That really encourages me. We were thinking of <br/>
looking into adoption before doing more invasive treatments, but stories like <br/>
this inspire me to be patient a bit longer. Our son is 3 and we have been <br/>
working on another one for about 15 months.  I think ben, our spirited child, <br/>
is getting a lot of the concentrated time he needs right now, so perhaps it <br/>
all fits together. I&#39;m so excited about home based learning. Thanks also <br/>
Susan, for your thoughts.<br/>
