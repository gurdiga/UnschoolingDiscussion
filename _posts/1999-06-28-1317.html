<div id="ygrps-yiv-855274521">Tomorrow we&#39;re about to go to Washington D.C. with our kids, thanks to <br/>
frequent flyer miles and friends in Maryland to stay with.   I&#39;m going to <br/>
drop off the list for a week and some so the mailbox doesn&#39;t fill up.  We&#39;re <br/>
planning days and days of Smithsonian including the new Post Office museum, <br/>
the National Zoo, the monuments, maybe FBI or Mint.   Oh--and we will brave <br/>
the mob to see the fireworks at the mall on 4th of July<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has experience and suggestions about going to Washington with kids <br/>
7, 10 and 12, I&#39;d appreciate it!  I&#39;ll probably drop off the list before we <br/>
leave.  <br/>
<br/>
Except for the cafeterias in some of the museums, I don&#39;t know where to eat <br/>
downtown Washington.  Anyone know a good air conditioned ice-tea place that <br/>
allows sitting and resting within walking distance or by a Metro station?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll check the list (maybe just for this or related subject lines) until <br/>
mid-Tuesday 6/29, and then I&#39;m going to drop off the list until I get back <br/>
from the trip so my mailbox doesn&#39;t overfill.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

We did a similar trip in &#39;97.<br/>

big exhibit on the creation of suburbs--a subject I love to hate.<br/>

one lunch we ate in the underground cafeteria between the art museums on<br/>
the Mall.  There are many eating options around Dupont Circle as well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a wonderful trip, Sandra.  I live about 50 miles from DC, my<br/>
family lives in the city, and we have spend A LOT of unschooling time doing<br/>
just those things.<br/>
<br/>
As for cafeterias that are relatively cheap and good, (although not<br/>
specifically iced-tea shops) did you know that the employee cafeterias in<br/>
the government buildings are usually open to the public?  The Department of<br/>
Agriculture, which is right across Independence Avenue from the Smithsonian<br/>
has a very nice cafeteria, as does the Department of Commerce, where the<br/>
National Aquarium is.  Also, the Supreme Court, although theirs is very<br/>
small, so best to go during off hours.  And the National Gallery has a GREAT<br/>
cafeteria.<br/>
<br/>
Union Station, right across from the Post Office Museum, has a big food<br/>
court downstairs by the Metro stop.  If you walk up First Street, to<br/>
Independence Avenue SE on the other side of the Capitol, there are a lot of<br/>
ethnic restaurants, pubs, and pizza restaurants in a few blocks.<br/>
<br/>
However, nothing is going to be really cheap.  We usually pack sandwiches<br/>
and then get drinks and ice cream in the cafeterias.<br/>
<br/>
I envy you doing the fireworks on the Mall.  We have done them almost every<br/>
year for 20 years, but this year I have to work (Boo!)<br/>

hints you pick up.  I really want to make a trip like this with my 10 yr old.<br/>

<br/>
Where is it!??<br/>
<br/>
Is this where they have a 50&#39;s tract house from the Princess Jeanne <br/>
subdivision built, whole, and furnished?  If so, we just moved out of one of <br/>
those neighborhoods a year and a half ago.  Is it with the rest of the <br/>
Smithsonian stuff?  We&#39;ve got to see our house pristine! &lt;g&gt;</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m jealous Sandra!!  I haven&#39;t been to D.C. in years, and I am dying to<br/>
take my dh, who has never been.  But we are going to wait until our babies<br/>
are a little older so that they can enjoy more that the city has to offer.<br/>
As far as suggestions, I was the 7 to 12 year old on my first couple of<br/>
trips to D.C. so I can tell you what I enjoyed doing, from that standpoint.<br/>
 I was very impressed with the Lincoln Memorial.  It is a highly familiar<br/>
landmark, and awesome in scale to a kid (or an adult, for that matter.)  It<br/>
really made Lincoln seem so special on a whole &#39;nother level for me.  It<br/>
was also a very enotional experience, and got me interested in US history,<br/>
slavery and the civil war as well as the constitution and our basic<br/>
governmental makeup in this country.<br/>
<br/>
My brother (13 months older than me) and I also had a great time at the<br/>
Smithsonian Air and Space museum.  It was really cool to see the Wright<br/>
Brothers&#39; plane, space capsule, etc....and the Star Trek exhibit was way<br/>
cool :-)!!  Try to get to some of the historical homes that are around<br/>
there that are kept up in period or original furnishings (some complete<br/>
with costumed quides) I had a lot of fun checking those out.  I was<br/>
particularly fascinated with the children&#39;s rooms, or anything that<br/>
depicted lives of children in differing historical periods.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun, and remember not to overdo it!!  :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The hands-on chemistry demonstration (you get to separate DNA strands<br/>
and other good stuff) put on by the American Chemical Society at the<br/>
Smithsonian is excellent for kids that age.  You have to sign up in<br/>
advance, and the demo takes about 40 minutes, as I remember.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep David, We have done this activity at the Smithsonian.  It is in the <br/>
American History Museum and the age is 5 and up.  We go ask for tickets when <br/>
we arrive early in the day and hope there will be some available for later in <br/>
the day.  Your ticket gives the time for your experiment.  Also besides the <br/>
DNA experiment there are three others to choose from.  Perhaps they change <br/>
these periodically?<br/>
We&#39;ll be lookin&#39; for all ya&#39;ll at the fireworks on the 4th!!<br/>
