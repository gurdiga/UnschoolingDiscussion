<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835628724">The Bob Books are published by Scholastic, not by a relgious publisher.<br/>
<br/>
They are small books that are easy for young hands to hold.  In the<br/>
beginning of each book there is an introduction to new sounds.  Each page<br/>
has a picture.  Each box comes with 8-12 books, a teaching guide and finger<br/>
puppets.<br/>
<br/>
They can be found on the veg-source board, in local bookstores, most<br/>
anywhere books are sold.  You might try www.scholastic.com  or call at<br/>
800-733-5572.<br/>
