Because of the abuse of the charter system, you are now restricted to using<br/>
one within a designated area from your home.<br/>

&gt; Hello, my name is Carla. I have been subscribed to this group for<br/>
&gt; awhile, but nervous about posting.  I am 35; have 3 kids (6,3 & 1).<br/>
&gt; My oldest is now at the age that I have to decide on a charter<br/>
&gt; school.  For my husband&#39;s comfort level, I am going to try one out<br/>
&gt; for this first year. Are there any Californians out there that can<br/>
&gt; refer me to one?  I really do not want one that imposes a curriculum<br/>
&gt; on us. </span></blockquote></div>
