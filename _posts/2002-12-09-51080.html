<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719131706"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Yep. I see that in my five kids. The ones who are always<br/>
&gt; communicating or expressing themselves in one way or another -<br/>
&gt; talking, singing, drawing, writing -  are the ones who&#39;ve taken to<br/>
&gt; writing at great length, whether writing notes, filling out forms,<br/>
&gt; making lists, writing letters, writing in journals, or, like one son,<br/>
&gt; constantly writing stories. A couple of others, who are less<br/>
&gt; interested in communicating, and more interested in doing things with<br/>
&gt; their hands (they&#39;re both really into mechanics, classic car<br/>
&gt; restoring, and construction of various types), only occasionally<br/>
&gt; bother to write anything. I know they can, they just prefer not to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So how *did* they end up learning how to write?  Lars is much like your<br/>
&quot;doing&quot; kids.  I always thought that when he learned how to read, he&#39;d<br/>
gradually become a better speller because of seeing the words correctly a<br/>
lot.  Trouble is, having learned to read (under coercion, I admit) he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like to and basically doesn&#39;t.  So he&#39;s not going to learn to spell<br/>
that way.  This is a sample of his writing.  He seems to have little trouble<br/>
getting his point across, and the stories he dictated when he was younger<br/>
were wonderful.  Will this mainly phonetic spelling ever morph into<br/>
something more like standard English?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The reson I do not like to rite<br/>
<br/>
I ges The reson that I dont do much riting is that wan I sit dun to rite I<br/>
find it boring  becus wen I look at a book or a cebord al I se is a bunch of<br/>
leters, ya wen you put them to gether you can get sumthing cool but well I<br/>
ges I wood rather espres my felings in my acshons rather then put sum woods<br/>
on a pees of paper or on a conpouter I ges wen I make<br/>
Something like a jump or sumthing, like wen I ride my bike its not becus I<br/>
wont to do sumthing that I cud hirt my self, like wen I do a drop it is not<br/>
becus I wunt to se hew menny  feet I can drop,<br/>
Words that repusent dong sumthing just don&#39;t seme the same as dong it your<br/>
self like wen<br/>
You reed sumthing in the news hew do you now that it rilly hapond are you<br/>
rilly apost to lisen to sum dum blond for a ewer abuwt sum plais wer sum<br/>
person went and got lost for a few daes or sum pirson jumpt of a brig becus<br/>
he cudent taec all the stuff that he herd in the news. Look at y2k all the<br/>
news time it got and I don&#39;t thinck that ennething even hapend more then sum<br/>
computer that wus bilt befor I wus born.<br/>
Ok that&#39;s wie I don&#39;t like nonfikshon  and fikshon well if you are gong to<br/>
lisson to sum pirsons amajinashon wie don&#39;t you go owt and hav sum<br/>
advenchers of yuor oine<br/>
Well I do rite becus I just rote this well im gong to bed and dreme sum<br/>
fikshon ....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(I guess the reason that I don&#39;t do much writing is that when I sit down to<br/>
write I find it boring because when I look at a book or a keyboard all I see<br/>
is a bunch of letters, yeah when you put them together you can get something<br/>
cool but well I guess I would rather express my feelings in my actions<br/>
rather than put some words on a piece of paper or on a computer  I guess<br/>
when I make something like a jump or something, like when I ride my bike<br/>
it&#39;s not because I want to do something that I could hurt myself, like when<br/>
I do a drop it is not because I want to see how many feet I can drop,<br/>
Words that represent doing something just don&#39;t seem the same as doing it<br/>
yourself like when you read something in the news how do you know that it<br/>
really happened are you really supposed to listen to some dumb blonde for an<br/>
hour about some place where some person went and got lost for a few days or<br/>
some person jumped off a bridge because he couldn&#39;t take all the stuff that<br/>
he heard in the news.  Look at y2k all the news time it got and I don&#39;t<br/>
think that anything even happened more than some computer that was built<br/>
before I was born.<br/>
Ok that&#39;s why I don&#39;t like nonfiction and fiction well if you are going to<br/>
listen to some person&#39;s imagination why don&#39;t you go out and have some<br/>
adventures of your own<br/>
Well I do write because I just wrote this  well I&#39;m going to bed and dream<br/>
some fiction......<br/>
<br/>
(This was written because we thought he was going to have to produce some<br/>
writing for the ps program he&#39;s registered with, in order to keep the<br/>
computer that they loan him.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-866939802">Hi, Tia --<br/>
<br/>
My cheery thought for the day is that if one had to take a skateboarding<br/>
test instead of a pencil and paper test to get a high school diploma, I<br/>
would *definitely* be a dropout.<br/>
<br/>
If the kinesthetic people ever take over and start running the world, I<br/>
would be in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
Simplistically, we might think that bad spelling is a sign of ignorance<br/>
or stupidity, but it ain&#39;t.  ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-76275990">I am curious as to how old Lars is?  He sounds a lot like my 11 yo son.. He <br/>
hates to read and write.  Now, hear and tell stories, thats great..  He is <br/>
very creative and also mechanically minded.  Ethan would probably spell a <br/>
story in a very similar fashion.   I just took my kids out of school last <br/>
week.. Ethan had been having spelling/vocabulary tests every week.. He would <br/>
ace the vocabulary ( matching) but fail the spelling test miserably. <br/>
Sometimes he would only get one or two out of 20 correct.  My feelings were ( <br/>
are) that I am glad he knows and understands what the words means.  I dont <br/>
really care if he can spell them or not.<br/>
<br/>
   To me, spelling is a big old waste of time.. Either you get it or you <br/>
dont.  My oldest son is a wonderful speller, its a natural gift to him.  He <br/>
has probably only had to &quot;look up&quot;10 words in his 16 years  He just knows <br/>
them, he visualizes them.  Yet, in school, he still had to write those dang <br/>
spelling words 5 times each every week.. UGHGHGHG.. My daughter had to study <br/>
her words for about 15 mins, maybe have me call them out to her once. She <br/>
made 100 on every spelling test she ever took.. BUT, when she writes, she <br/>
often misspells words.  She only memorized her spelling words for the test . <br/>
Ethan could study and write his words 50 times each, and on test day, he woud <br/>
still fail the test.  So, to me, in every case, spelling was a . WASTE of <br/>
time.   Sorry for the long rant,.. I do get wound up sometimes :-)<br/>

where he might have to fill out job applications and such fairly soon, it&#39;s<br/>
more of a worry.<br/>

is the only one of our kids with a high school diploma, and her spelling is<br/>
awful (not as bad as Lars&#39; though).<br/>

I&#39;m in awe of the physical / spatial intelligence required to do those<br/>
amazing skateboarding tricks.  Parking my car straight is a challenge to<br/>
me!  And I should probably enroll in a class for &quot;remedial dancing&quot;.<br/>
