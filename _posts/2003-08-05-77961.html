<div id="ygrps-yiv-9863178"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But then I thought that maybe that wasn&#39;t entirely true.  Maybe other <br/>
 </span></blockquote>unschoolers do find that unschooling has its problems, maybe even ones I would <br/>
agree with.  So, I decided to ask you all. Does unschooling have its own <br/>
problems?  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s perfect, but I do think it &lt;i&gt;works&lt;/i&gt;, while school <br/>
does not.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; <br/>
    <br/>
I think Rhonda hit the nail on the head---although it isn&#39;t true for every <br/>
family----with the grandparent/in-law/stranger issue.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is still new and radical and, well....weird for too many people. <br/>
So you sometimes have to explain a lot. The lack of understanding in the <br/>
general public (their OWN brainwashing) makes it hard to be accepted, much less <br/>
mainstream. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy in my own little unschooling world---and, at the same time, I do <br/>
what I can to publicize the GOOD of unschooling---like putting on a conference <br/>
(The Live & Learn UNschooling Conference in Columbia, SC August 22-24, 2003).<br/>
<br/>
Ben jokes that I&#39;ve brainwashed Cameron and Duncan---especially Duncan (7), <br/>
who will pipe up with how AWFUL school is and how poorly they treat kids and <br/>
why would anybody want to spend one hour there, much less 12-14 YEARS! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But I think the only &quot;negative&quot; would be the lack of understanding---and not <br/>
just understanding, but also the lack of information available. People don&#39;t <br/>
even know it EXISTS!<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking that it needs to be announced on some national tv <br/>
show---Oprah (who thinks school is the be-all-end-all) or Bill Maher (good forum, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think he LIKES kids!). Larry King? Too conservative a viewer? Phil <br/>
Donahue *might* could have pulled it off a few years ago, but....   60 Minutes, <br/>
maybe. But a bunch of old &quot;academically-minded&quot; fogies probably couldn&#39;t grasp the <br/>
concept.<br/>
<br/>
See? It&#39;s just not mainstream enough. You&#39;d think someone would WANT to stir <br/>
things up with such a radical concept! Howard Stern? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It just won&#39;t happen anytime soon! Until then, WE are the spokespeople! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>And that is the hardest part for me. Because the majority of people I <br/>
meet in Virginia do &#39;school at home&#39; it<br/>
has led to severe loneliness for me and the kids. I&#39;m a social person. <br/>
Back home neighbours were always dropping<br/>
by for coffee cos they were passing, there were lots of HE families, <br/>
most of whom unschooled and the town had<br/>
a sense of community in that we&#39;d walk to the shops most days, say Hi to <br/>
John in the Greengrocers, joke with Ian<br/>
in the Butchers etc etc<br/>
I tried really hard when we moved here, got a group going, went to <br/>
everything but people found me odd, didn&#39;t like<br/>
the questions their kids then asked about why they had to do workbooks <br/>
while mine didn&#39;t and basically, preferred<br/>
superficial meetings in parks rather than real friendship.<br/>
Unschooling, combined with soul-less suburbs and the need to go <br/>
everywhere in a metal box has made living in<br/>
Virginia an ordeal rather than an experience to be savoured :-(<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to get back and unschool in a community again.<br/>

&quot;school at home&quot; atmosphere here but we found the one other unschooling family <br/>
and that has made a big difference.  Although we do go to play group, etc., <br/>
with the larger group and have fun.  I know what you mean about &quot;friendship&quot; vs <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-218270760">WEll, Jared says unschooling is perfect. Trevor says he&#39;s missing out on some social stuff and that&#39;s it. He&#39;s 13 and really needing to be with peers more lately, but we seem unable to meet his needs entirely. Mainly because I&#39;m working a lot lately, but that will change next week.<br/>
<br/>
I find that it is difficult to balance everyone&#39;s priorities sometimes. I know the two little ones need me to read, play and do tactile stuff with them. My oldest would like to be out and about doing things with other people more. Second oldest ds would like more one on one attention. But that&#39;s not about unschooling really, in the sense that these issues would exist regardless....actually, MORE so if they were in school. Trevor would get his social needs met, but he&#39;d also deal with the BS that he has NO desire to face. So it&#39;s not worth it, even to him.<br/>
<br/>
I find that I don&#39;t get to my passions/interests nearly as often as I&#39;d like. I don&#39;t get the solitude I crave in order to be creative. But I also know that it is a short term thing...mostly has to do with having a toddler!  I think that with unschooling the parents DO have to juggle their interests a bit more, because everyone&#39;s interests are of equal value. But why would I want to change THAT? :) yk?<br/>
I could be like other parents that don&#39;t value their children&#39;s interests and STILL don&#39;t seem to have passions of their own....<br/>
So I see that any challenges faced with unschooling are actually positives when you view the other options. <br/>
I like that my children&#39;s interests are high priority. I see the genius in them flourishing and that makes everything totally worth it.<br/>
I didn&#39;t have children so I could put myself first all the time anyway, I just have to remind myself of that after a long day of go, go, go and a bed full of people and NO time to myself.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, unschooling IS perfect. The challenges have encouraged me to grow and proven that it&#39;s the ultimate environment to foster creativity and brain growth!!<br/>
<br/>

kids are really young, you could just do a playgroup same place (a park or some <br/>
public place) every week and meet more families that way.  Some might be able <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Cameron has a few friends from school still. A couple have gotten into drugs <br/>
and drinking a good bit, so he doesn&#39;t spend as much time with them---they&#39;re <br/>
too busy getting high.<br/>
<br/>
The homeschoolers we know are a bit too...&quot;conservative&quot; for his tastes, and <br/>
the two other unschoolers share no common interests.<br/>
<br/>
His new friends are co-workers at the deli where he works parttime. One is <br/>
18, the other 19. Both skate and like to be filmed. The 18 year old had a part <br/>
in a pretty big local skating film last year---both in front of and behind the <br/>
camera. Cameron&#39;s enjoying picking his brain, and he tells us how good Cameron <br/>
is at filming. Most are out of school or attending parttime college.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll have his restricted license later this month (maybe by the <br/>
conference---that&#39;ll help me loads!). The driving is a big deal; it makes it easier for <br/>
them to do and to be.<br/>
<br/>
I think the push to find others of the same age is unnecessary---better to <br/>
find those with the same interests---regardless of age. If you can get around <br/>
the age descrimination, it&#39;ll widen his horizons. But many parents wouldn&#39;t let <br/>
a 15 yo hang with a 19 yo. I think they&#39;re good for him. They&#39;re fairly <br/>
radical (skaters and all! &lt;G&gt;), but they are stable and driven and have passions. <br/>
And I trust Cameron.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron wouldn&#39;t trade his unschool lifestyle for all the friends in the <br/>
world. He&#39;s happy and he likes the friends he has. <br/>

Kirby and Marty have both younger and older friends.  It makes lots of sense. <br/>
 The more experienced gamers or athletes help those newer (regardless of <br/>
age), those who can drive provide transport, those with jobs (not always the same <br/>
as the drivers) can pay for gas money and snacks.  Those who&#39;ve been to <br/>
college or are in college can talk to those who are considering it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-205627116">Remember when you were 13? I do, barely. I did not have enough friends.. I<br/>
went to public school but did not fit in too well (I was an outspoken broad<br/>
even then, wait till I am a crazy old lady) and just had a couple close<br/>
friends. I was always whining about not having friends, what I meant was the<br/>
social experiences of the popular kids. They always looked like they were<br/>
having more fun (you should see the way some of them turned out, sort of<br/>
feel vindicated even though it is mean). Anyway all a teen really needs is a<br/>
few close friends to hang with. Around here it will be easier because there<br/>
are some really good home school groups and one bang up unschooling group<br/>
(Ann Arbor, MI) but anywhere else it would be hard, especially if you don&#39;t<br/>
go to religious meetings every week.<br/>

&gt; to find kids for my kids to play with, something that they&#39;ve been <br/>
&gt; asking for, on the other hand I could just picture these kids all <br/>
&gt; sitting around staring at each other because they don&#39;t know one <br/>
&gt; another.  I not sure if I&#39;d like it if my husband set up a mom&#39;s day <br/>
&gt; even if I wanted other mom&#39;s to talk to.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can see the point but I think it is harder for kids to form friendships if <br/>
the parent doesn&#39;t help in some way.  Unless they are 15 or 16 they can&#39;t <br/>
drive anywhere.  I know we don&#39;t go to church so there aren&#39;t any friends that <br/>
way.  We live on 12 acres not in a housing development.  We do get out to do <br/>
errands, etc., but most children are in school, not out with their parents doing <br/>
errands.  If I didn&#39;t take my child to play group they would not have developed <br/>
friendships.  And they don&#39;t develop true friendships with everyone.  The <br/>
ones that they seem to click with they say so and we arrange to do things with <br/>
them.  They do play with everyone.  Putting children together does not mean that <br/>
they have to form friendships with everyone.  <br/>
<br/>
I think for that age you could set up some sort of a bike day type of thing <br/>
so that older children, preteen, teen, could bring bikes, roller blades, etc., <br/>
and get together.  That way they wouldn&#39;t have to just sit and stare at each <br/>
other they could bike.  Maybe bring a basketball or soccer ball and see if they <br/>
want to get a game going.  That way they are playing together.  <br/>
<br/>
At the unschooling conference last year I think all the ages of children were <br/>
able to make friends and play or talk together.  Some were more quiet than <br/>
others but it was refreshing to see children that were so outgoing.  You may be <br/>
surprised.<br/>
<br/>
I think it may be easier for adults although that is not always the case.  I <br/>
know my best friend has a hard time making friends, her job provides a little <br/>
of that.  But I did get her a museum membership for Christmas which allows her <br/>
to go to the openings etc and she meets interesting people there.  I set her <br/>
up.  She was very happy and thankful.<br/>

<br/>
I hated being 13!  It was the worst time of my life.  I was in 7th grade.  I had no friends in school at all because all my friends from grammar school went to one class, I was put in another class.  Their reason was that I had gotten better grades than my friend in 6th grade.  I was put in the &quot;smart&quot; class with kids who had all come from the same school.  There were only 3 kids in that class that didn&#39;t grow up with the others and I was one of them.  I failed all the classes on purpose just to be put back in a regular class with my friends.  It worked because in 8th grade I was back in a regular class.<br/>
<br/>
To top it off, it was the year that I started my period.  It always seemed to come when I was in class.  I had the worst cramps, too.  I had to sit through an entire day of school with dirty clothes and cramps because I took the bus to school and my mother didn&#39;t drive.  My daughter will never have to go through that humiliation.<br/>

<br/>
Pam, I definately agree with this.  Where we used to live there was a game group that met at the library.  We went every week.  My daughter makes friends everywhere we go, but my son has a harder time.  He prefers the older kids to kids his own age.  I think the difference between a game/play group held in a public place and setting up a playdate in someone&#39;s house is that when you are in a public place with a group of people your kids have the opportunity to leave, while in someone&#39;s house they&#39;re kind of stuck there.  I think that&#39;s the part that&#39;s making me squeamish.  I would rather the kids meet in a public place where they don&#39;t feel forced to be friends.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thats one thing I thought of. My daughter will never have to worry about <br/>
boys tipping out her bag and finding sanitary products.<br/>
She&#39;ll never have to worry of she&#39;s leaking and will it show on her <br/>
clothes and be embaressed about asking a teacher if she can<br/>
go to the bathroom. I once had a teacher ask why I was taking my bag <br/>
with me. The whole class started to titter.<br/>

out what ya&#39;ll have written while I was gone...I drove just over 650 <br/>
miles yesterday,(about 12 1/2 hours) and it was tough, but if you <br/>
stop as many times as Alex and I did to go potty, hehehe, it&#39;s not <br/>
bad at all. <br/>
 <br/>
Beware of the feeling that you&#39;re still moving when you stop....kinda <br/>
like the feeling you get when you get off an elevator? It goes away <br/>
when you get back in the car, but it can make you wobbly when you get <br/>
out of the car!  <br/>
<br/>
My advice, if you feel tired or spacey, stop for a moment, stretch, <br/>
get a candy bar, whatever, and when you get back in the car, you&#39;ll <br/>
feel much better.  Being safe is more important than making good <br/>
time. <br/>
