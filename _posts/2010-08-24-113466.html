<div id="ygrps-yiv-881742013">I have been homeschooling my 14 yr. old son for 5 years now.He has some developmental delays but is an easy going, co-operative teen. About 3 yrs. ago I decided that unschooling was the way to go with him. I have a lot of trouble with the fact that he plays the same vidoe game hour after hour, day after day, year after year. Honestly, year after year! I have not said anything about this to him, although his brothers tease him about it. <br/>
I have tried getting involved in the game with him, but my boredom level just can&#39;t take any more!If I suggest a new game, he, ever eager to please, will play it for a short while and then revert to the old one. <br/>
Unfortunately, too, I started suggesting other activities which I thought he may enjoy, and I have slowly allowed those activities to become more and more &#39;schooly&#39;. We are almost back to where we started with &#39;School at home&#39;. This happened without me really noticing, and was also easier in view of the fact that there is some family opposition to unschooling.<br/>
My question is, now what should I do?He will do whatever I suggest, and if I ask him what HE wants to do he can&#39;t think of anything.(Except for Lego Indiana Jones!!) He likes structure, and a set schedule. He has no definite direction and we have already exhausted any interests he has had. Should I totally de-school him again, or just be more conscious of what I suggest to him? Please help, any advice will be appreciated.</div>

It hasn&#39;t been that long, in terms of a lifetime. Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
And if you are the one &quot;having trouble with&quot; it, *you* might need the  <br/>
deschooling. Read here:<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s possible that your son is playing the same game over and over  <br/>
*because* you keep trying to get him to do other stuff. He might be  <br/>
wondering just when it&#39;s going to be taken away for &quot;more worthy&quot;  <br/>
pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to offer different activities to your son or &quot;strew&quot; around  <br/>
your home (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing)">http://sandradodd.com/strewing)</a>. Those things should  <br/>
come with no expectations, though. If he wants to branch out, he will.  <br/>
In the meantime, why not find opportunities that feed his passion? Are  <br/>
there tournaments he could play in? Does he have gaming buddies? I  <br/>
Googled &quot;Lego Indiana Jones&quot; and there are countless sites, YouTube  <br/>
videos, and Lego to explore. What about the Indiana Jones movies? Does  <br/>
he like the IJ hat? The whip? So many possibilities!<br/>
<br/>
When you start relaxing about what he&#39;s passionate about, he will, too.<br/>
