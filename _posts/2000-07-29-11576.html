<br/>
I just remembered we use 3 strikes and you&#39;re out.  For this you&#39;ll need a <br/>
bargaining chip (in our house it&#39;s Nintendo).  3 strikes means no &#39;tendo for <br/>
the remainder of the day and all of the next.  If there is a fuss about it, <br/>
the time is extended.  <br/>
<br/>
The way I use it there are actually 9 opportunities to mess up before the <br/>
priveledge is taken away.  That way I can give plenty of warning and not have <br/>
to get nasty about it.  3 warnings = 1 strike.  The warnings are all in the <br/>
same day for the same type of offense that leads tp strikes  but do not have <br/>
to happen at the same time.  The strikes do not have to be for the same <br/>
offense.  (one strike could be for chore refusal, another for hitting brother <br/>
(no warnings given for hitting offenses in my house:  hitting = immediate <br/>
strike!), another for shouting at me, etc.)  Depending on the situation, all <br/>
strikes may be for the same offense, especially if there are several things <br/>
you are working on and you want to concentrate on one at a time.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, if the offense is shouting at mom; when kidlet shouts he is <br/>
told &#39;the rule is no shouting in our household, that is your first warning&#39;.  <br/>
If he stops shouting, the problem is dealt with and we move on with our day.  <br/>
If he shouts again, it&#39;s warning two and on to strike one.  Then repeat for <br/>
strikes 2 and 3 as needed.  I guarantee that within 24-48 hours of setting up <br/>
the system you&#39;ll be tested and kidlet will have 3 strikes.  So pick <br/>
something that means something to him/her and something you can live with <br/>
enforcing.  The first time is the hardest.<br/>
<br/>
Then mark it on the calendar...no &lt;fill in the blank&gt;...tell the child while <br/>
you are marking the calendar (or posting a note) what the offense was and <br/>
remind how long the consequence lasts.  (this step is essential for me, <br/>
otherwise I forget he&#39;s grounded!)<br/>
<br/>
This really works!  When my kids were 12 and 2 I started this system.  It <br/>
worked so well that when someone asks what to do, I go through a long process <br/>
of thought and examples before I remember what we do...in other words I <br/>
haven&#39;t had to impose strikes for so long I forget we do it!  I&#39;ll tell you <br/>
what, though, the kid remembers!  Now when he misbehaves we skip the warnings <br/>
and he gets a strike at the first offense (because he&#39;s already been <br/>
repeating it long enough I had to go through the whole brain wracking thing <br/>
to remember what to do!).  That is usually all it takes.  (youngest is almost <br/>
12 now)<br/>
<br/>
My oldest used it to brag what a mean mom he had.  Oldest DS is a very <br/>
stubborn person (I tell myself it will serve him well some day!  LOL).  One <br/>
particular day he was very intent on being as ornery as possible.  He was <br/>
yelling at me, refusing to do the chore he was assigned, slamming doors, etc. <br/>
 I have never seen a child being so rude to his parents as he was that <br/>
evening!  So, I told him what was expected (so proud of myself for not <br/>
raising my voice or beating the kid!), gave him the warnings, then strikes.  <br/>
He still continued.  So, we went through a round of strikes (without further <br/>
warnings) for another day with no &#39;tendo, then a third.  Then he was told he <br/>
had 5 minutes to calm down.  If he wasn&#39;t able to speak calmly and deal with <br/>
the chore by then, he&#39;d lose a day of &#39;tendo for every additional minute it <br/>
took him to get control of himself.<br/>
<br/>
He was grounded for 6 weeks!!  Apparently it got his attention, though.  When <br/>
the kids had their <br/>
you-think-your-mom&#39;s-so-bad-just-be-glad-you-don&#39;t-have-mine contests, he won <br/>
everytime.  He never got that mouthy again.  He&#39;s still stubborn, but he <br/>
learned to state his opinion in a much nicer tone and with much better <br/>
language and that he still had to take out the trash when it was his <br/>
assignment.<br/>
<br/>
Another tool is a required essay (assuming child is old enough to write or <br/>
dictate).  For this one I would tell him I wanted a one page (2, 3, 500 word, <br/>
whatever you pick) essay on something like &#39;the importance of treating each <br/>
family member with respect&#39;.  A rule, stated in a positive way.  You can be a <br/>
specific or as general as you like.  The &#39;why&#39; part seemed to be important, <br/>
though.  I guess because it gave him something to &#39;hang&#39; the essay on.  Then <br/>
he had to come up with sentence, paragraph and essay structure explaining the <br/>
subject.  <br/>
<br/>
He had me in stitches the day he decided to write a very well written essay <br/>
about not yelling at mom.  His points were something like:  yelling makes mom <br/>
made, mom is not pleasant to be around when she&#39;s mad, it isn&#39;t a good idea <br/>
to make mom mad.  Very cheeky!  After laughing out loud while I read it and <br/>
congratulating him on his creativity, I told him to re-write the essay <br/>
properly!  Scamp.  (I kept that essay.  The rest we threw away.  The problem <br/>
was dealt with, so the essay also went out with the trash.  I suppose it <br/>
could be interesting to put into portfolios if you need essays for <br/>
assessments!  heheheh)<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, he was sure this essay would get my goat.  Took away all his <br/>
sting when I laughed and pointed out what excellent sentence structure he had <br/>
used.  Plus, seeing the humor kept it from being personal enough to hurt my <br/>
feelings.  He still had to re-write it, though.<br/>
<br/>
I also tried the old practice of writing sentences over and over again...it <br/>
did not have nearly the impact essay writing did.  But when we did resort to <br/>
sentences they were wordy ones with new vocabulary words.  I figured at least <br/>
then he&#39;d have to think about it a little bit while he was copying it down!  <br/>
This might work better for younger writers than essay writing.  We progressed <br/>
from sentences to essays.  I got tired of thinking up sentences that weren&#39;t <br/>
repetitive and figured it was time for him to do the thinking.  After all, he <br/>
was the one that misbehaved.  LOL<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Your method is similar to the one in  &quot; 1, 2, 3 Magic &quot;. The only thing<br/>
is in that method there isn&#39;t a loss of a privilege. <br/>
I have to admit that for the odd extremely major offences around here<br/>
it&#39;s the TV or computer that is lost. TV is a privilege around this<br/>
house not a right.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather not have to take anything away but, there is the odd extreme<br/>
behaviour out burst(s) that requires more than talking, unfortunately it<br/>
requires action.<br/>
