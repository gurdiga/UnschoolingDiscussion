<div id="ygrps-yiv-67401150">Dear Unschoolers:<br/>
<br/>
I am asking for ideas for fun activities to do with my 15 year old son.<br/>
<br/>
Some things we already enjoy together:  listening to humorous books-on-tape<br/>
(I would love titles of funny books, especially with a political twist),<br/>
watching movies, playing Monopoly and Risk, talking, occassional outings.<br/>
<br/>
Ross is sort of an indoor/computer/Magic the Gathering or drive any fast <br/>
motorized vehicle type of guy.  I am a gardener, fiber and textile crafter, <br/>
hiker.  How can parents produce children who have such different interest!?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107583669">Hey, have you ever tried biking? My 2 boys, ages 19 years(on Monday) and 11<br/>
years, and I enjoy it. I am not the bicyclist that thay are, but we do have<br/>
fun. We bike on the c and o canal where it is relatively flat for me and we<br/>
can go off of it to explore along the way. Sometimes we even camp over night<br/>
and take bike trips: bike and camp for several days.<br/>
