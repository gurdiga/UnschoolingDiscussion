<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672593372">FOR MUSIC LESSONS:   i have been &quot;teaching&quot;<br/>
 piano for 34 years..... ID rather call it GUIDING PIANO!!!!!! i started when <br/>
i was 11 becasue i had such a neat teacher he suggested i teach the <br/>
neighborhood kids and it turned into my career~!  but i really find that my <br/>
biggest job is providing them and introducing them to all kinds of <br/>
music.......after &quot;teaching&quot; them the keys on the piano (actually.....1 or 2 <br/>
and then they see they are in order) and then a few notes.....on the 1st page <br/>
and MAGIC HAPPENS USUALLY!!!!!!!! so for the next year -20 years!!! i find <br/>
them music and play for them and with them , do computer games and homemade <br/>
games and listen to their stories.....and share life! so what i would do~ is <br/>
what i do~ if she is reluctant....just say we are going to meet a piano <br/>
teacher........this is just a meeting and then you can decide. OR sign up for <br/>
5 lessons afte r you all  meet the  teacher  and ask your child to just try 5 <br/>
for you. then they can decide if they want to continue. if the child finds it <br/>
fun and wants to continue....that is still their choice and i think that <br/>
unschooling is about choices!!!!!~Denise<br/>
