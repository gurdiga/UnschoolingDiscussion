<div id="ygrps-yiv-86972128">An alternative to coffee filters is using a french press. They&#39;re all glass<br/>
with a metal filter, and depending on how much you want to pay, the filters<br/>
are made of different metals. You just put the grounds in the bottom, pour<br/>
in the hot water, and after a few minutes you press the filter down. Here in<br/>
alterna-land we have organic coffee shops (no kidding!) so it&#39;s easy to find<br/>
body-friendly coffee and brewing mechanisms but I think these are probably<br/>
widely available as well.<br/>
