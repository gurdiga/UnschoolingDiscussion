<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055590818">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I just posted this question to another list, so I apologise to those <br/>
of you in Canada who are getting it twice.  My question is this:  <br/>
There are so many books written for children about the &#39;first day of <br/>
school&#39;.  Has anyone seen anything specifically written for children <br/>
around the ages of 5 or 6 about homeschooling as an alternative?  My <br/>
dd is only 3 and already convinced that she is &#39;supposed&#39; to go to <br/>
school.  I was thinking that a book about a child who was <br/>
home/unschooled would make her feel more &#39;normal&#39;.  (Whatever that <br/>
means!)<br/>
<br/>
Love, Tori</div>

 </span></blockquote>What a nice idea -- maybe she could write it!  (Dictate it?)<br/>
<br/>
Really.<br/>
<br/>
That would be close to what our lives are really like.<br/>
<br/>
She gets to learn what she wants to when she wants to.  Does that appeal to <br/>
her?<br/>
<br/>
Tell her right this very minute my 6 yo daughter is trying to get her <br/>
cardboard-box rocket ship to ride on the skateboard (she&#39;s just gone out to <br/>
get the 2nd one) and that is &quot;school&quot; today.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her we are going to the library later this afternnon to see the puppet <br/>
show -- something about science and puppets.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids have pen pals too.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!  She sounds wonderful.<br/>
