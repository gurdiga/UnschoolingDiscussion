<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033614724"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I had more or less shared this point of view until I met an organic farmer<br/>
&gt;and herbalist who had *really* spent time among her plants, and she came <br/>
&gt;to the<br/>
&gt;view that plants are just as alive as animals, even though they don&#39;t move.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A little anecdotal evidence (anecdotal because I don&#39;t have the written <br/>
research report in front of me and I&#39;m pulling from memory.)  It came up <br/>
when I was working in a cancer lab doing opiate studies.  Please don&#39;t ask <br/>
me to go find the study, &#39;cause I don&#39;t really want to with all that&#39;s <br/>
happening in my life and all right now.  Turn back now if you want me to <br/>
search it down for you!<br/>
********<br/>
There was a research study done where several plants in a room were hooked <br/>
up to monitors.  The monitors read the electrical &#39;state&#39; of the plant.<br/>
<br/>
Several people entered the room, sat for a while and talked nicely to the <br/>
plants.  Except for one person who entered the room and severely abused a <br/>
single plant (tearing leaves, yelling, shaking it, etc.) but left the other <br/>
neighboring plants alone.<br/>
<br/>
- Later that day -<br/>
<br/>
Each of the people were asked to walk again into the room but this time, <br/>
simply stand quietly then leave again.  As each person came and left, there <br/>
was no change in the electrical state of the plants until the abusive <br/>
person walked into the room.  When that person walked in, the abused <br/>
plant&#39;s electrical state changed dramatically.  The neighboring plants also <br/>
responded, but to a lesser degree.<br/>
They knew. It might have been chemical residue on the person from the <br/>
harmed plant, it might have been electrical energy, it might have been <br/>
something else we&#39;re not aware of yet, but the plants responded in a <br/>
markedly different manner to their abuser.<br/>
<br/>
So, plants are responsive.  Someday, they&#39;ll eat me.  Right now though, I&#39;m <br/>
gonna eat them.<br/>

Straight away I thought of one of my favourite books, The Day of the<br/>
Triffids. Love that story!<br/>

&lt;&lt; Straight away I thought of one of my favourite books, The Day of the<br/>
<br/>
Triffids. Love that story! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I thought of the musical &quot;Little Shop of Horrors.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That is one great and underrated musical. &lt;g&gt;  And the video with Rick <br/>
Moranis and Steve Martin is wonderful.  Frank Oz directed it.  Frank Oz is <br/>
wonderful.  Ellen Greene, who was the original Audrey, is perfect.  Levi Stubbs, from <br/>
the Four Tops (the one who sang lead on &quot;Bernadette&quot;--BIG clear voice) does the <br/>
plant.<br/>
<br/>
The video makes the ending happier than the stage play does.  No matter.  <br/>
Seeing Steve Martin do the dentist song is worth the price of the video (which is <br/>
already very cheap).  The &quot;dadoo&quot; Ronettes are a great joy too, the Greek <br/>
chorus of doo-wop girls who have like 20 costume changes.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  And it has Miriam Margolyes whom I just love, having finally figured out <br/>
that&#39;s her in so many different kinds of roles.  She&#39;s in a bunch of Black <br/>
Adder things (Queen Victoria in Black Adder&#39;s Christmas Carol, the crazy <br/>
religious aunt in the episode about the turnip that looks like &quot;a thingie&quot;), she was <br/>
the nurse when Claire Danes was Juliet.  Professor Sprout, at Hogwarts.<br/>
<br/>
And the music and lyrics are by the same guys who did Aladdin, Beauty and the <br/>
Beast and The Little Mermaid (Howard Ashman and Alan Menken).<br/>

the two of them. Oh, is Miriam the ugly Spanish bride-to-be brought to<br/>
England for Edmund to marry?<br/>
<br/>
Sigh, I miss Blackadder. (Just in case it wasn&#39;t that obvious. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
