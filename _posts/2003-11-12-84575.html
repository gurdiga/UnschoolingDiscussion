<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091714791">Hi all,<br/>
We recently gave our daughter a walkman for her Bday.  She also received a compact TV/VHS combo that we can use for travel. She loves to sing along to the music. She often sits and colors (most recently she is into those black velvet posters) while watching/listening.  I am looking for ideas for her for Xmas.  So far she has and enjoys Sound of Music, JC Superstar, Westside Story and a variety of Disney flicks (Lion King, Mary Poppins to name a few).  Any &quot;less common&quot; good ones you can reccommend would be apprecitated.  Sandra, she reminds me a little of your descriptions of Holly.  She is a Simpsons fan too, not reading yet, and seems theatrically bent. Right now she has her beanies doing dance routines to Veggietales Sillysongs. <br/>
Thanks for any ideas,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-482371012">Hi - I just asked my singing, dancing, theatrically VERY bent &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>
 13-year-old dd for her advice. She heartily approves of what you already <br/>
have, and suggests for soundtrack CDsyou move next to the Music Man, the Scarlet <br/>
Pimpernel (the musical soundtrack, not the old b&w movie) any of the Peter <br/>
Pans or the Cinderellas (there are many), Bye Bye Birdie, Singing in the Rain, <br/>
Annie, Oliver! and Camelot  (kings, queens and knights in shining armor!) . <br/>
<br/>
       Also there are Broadway CDs that feature kids&#39; favorite numbers such <br/>
as &quot;Anything You Can Do I Can Do Better&quot; that are fun to sing with, even <br/>
without seeing the whole show of Annie Get Your Gun.<br/>
<br/>
       Your dd at 8 may not be quite ready yet but not doubt soon will be, <br/>
for &quot;Into the Woods&quot; by Stephen Sondheim with all all the fairy tale characters <br/>
and amazing theatre music and lyrics. (Rent or buy the VHS of the whole play <br/>
with Bernadette Peters first, so she can &quot;see&quot; the soundtrack in context.)<br/>
<br/>
       There are old movie musicals with wonderful holiday classics she might <br/>
like, such as Bing Crosby in White Christmas and Holiday Inn. The newer Mrs. <br/>
Santa Clause with Angela Lansbury has catchy Christmas songs and feel-good <br/>
ensemble choreography. The animated Muppet Christmas Carol does too.<br/>
<br/>
       Also here&#39;s a thought -- Cats could be fun for Christmas gifting. To <br/>
along along with this, you could do the poetry the theatre version was based <br/>
on, by getting her TS Eliot&#39;s &quot;Old Possum&#39;s Book of Practical Cats&quot;, maybe in <br/>
illustrated form. There is a really beautiful children&#39;s picture book with three <br/>
poems excerpted from these lyrical poems that we all love (my dd went to <br/>
fetch it and is holding it as I write) -- &quot;Growltiger&#39;s Last Stand and Other <br/>
Poems.&quot; It also includes the Pekes and the Pollicles and the Song of the Jellicles, <br/>
published by Sunburst.<br/>

meaning that the are made to appear to move themselves &lt;g&gt; this is a live-action <br/>
movie, not a cartoon. Michael Caine plays Ebenezer Scrooge.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds quite like Holly for sure!<br/>
<br/>
Kids can know TONS of lyrics and plots and idiomatic English before they <br/>
read, and it just makes reading easier that they&#39;re reading things that already <br/>
make sense to them.  I feel sorry for those readers who learn to read at five or <br/>
six and are limited to just first-grade-level stuff.  When kids read later, <br/>
they can start right at harder things.  (I know some younger kids bypass <br/>
baby-readers too, but my kids all read things written for teens and adults when they <br/>
could first read, and it just seemed to make so much more sense.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry I changed the subject. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly has three Simpsons CDs.  &quot;Simpsons Sing the Blues&quot; (which we had for <br/>
years on a casette tape and she got a CD later), Songs in the Key of <br/>
Springfield, and another one.  We got them used from Amazon.   The first is not stuff <br/>
from the show.  It&#39;s fun, though.  The other two are good parts from the program, <br/>
sometimes full things, and sometimes just snippets, like special music for <br/>
the credits.   It has the things from the musicals on Simpsons, though, like the <br/>
musical Planet of the Apes, the songs from the show when they&#39;re saving the <br/>
whorehouse, when Sideshow Bob sang &quot;all ofHMS Pinafore&quot; at Bart&#39;s request, etc. <br/>
  It has the &quot;Canyonero&quot; commercial, one of the funniest things--a commercial <br/>
for a pickup truck, done as cowboy music, all intense with a bass voice... <br/>
I&#39;ll look for the lyrics.<br/>
<br/>
My kids liked Raffi (there are two videos), and Disney singalong stuff, when <br/>
they were younger than eight, and when they were eight, and ten... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes Cyndi Lauper.  There&#39;s a DVD called Twelve Deadly Cyns, with <br/>
videos and commentary.  There is &quot;adult subject matter&quot; on &quot;Sally&#39;s Pigeons,&quot; <br/>
about a teenaged girl who gets pregnant and dies from a back alley abortion, <br/>
though it&#39;s so subtly presented Holly had to ask what it was about.  Musically and <br/>
artistically, though, it&#39;s stunningly good.   Holly discovered that stuff when <br/>
she was ten and is twelve now.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian introduced us to Dar Williams, and Holly has two of her CDs.   <br/>
<br/>
All my kids like old rock&#39;n&#39;roll stuff from the 60&#39;s, and we&#39;ve made several <br/>
home-made compilations, and I bought a couple of mailorder ones where you <br/>
choose your own songs and the order of them and they make you a CD.  Some people <br/>
can do that themselves now with their computers.  I still can&#39;t.   I got Holly <br/>
a CD of stuff from the 1930&#39;s from one of those places.  She really liked Fred <br/>
Astaire.<br/>
<br/>
Beatles?<br/>

(thinking of more things Holly has liked)<br/>
<br/>
Holly thinks Man of La Mancha is a good singing along tape, she says, but the <br/>
old one was not in the order of the movie.  There&#39;s a new one that&#39;s the <br/>
current New York cast.  <br/>
<br/>
She said she liked the CD of Annie Get You Gun with Bernadette Peters before <br/>
she ever knew the story or a movie version.  It&#39;s not the same as the movie <br/>
version.<br/>
<br/>
Canyonero lyrics (though of course it&#39;s much funnier with the music and <br/>
whip-cracking background sounds and &quot;yee haws&quot;):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you name the truck with four wheel drive, <br/>
smells like a steak and seats thirty-five.. <br/>
<br/>
Canyonero! Canyonero! <br/>
<br/>
Well, it goes real slow with the hammer down, <br/>
It&#39;s the country-fried truck endorsed by a clown! <br/>
<br/>
Canyonero! (Yah!) Canyonero! <br/>
<br/>
Canyonero! <br/>
<br/>
Twelve yards long, two lanes wide, <br/>
65 tons of American Pride! <br/>
<br/>
Canyonero! Canyonero! <br/>
<br/>
Top of the line in utility sports, <br/>
Unexplained fires are a matter for the courts<br/>
<br/>
Canyonero! Canyonero! (Yah!) <br/>
<br/>
She blinds everybody with her super high beams, <br/>
She&#39;s a squirrel crushing, deer smacking, driving machine,<br/>
<br/>
Canyonero! Canyonero! <br/>
<br/>
Drive Canyonero!</div>

<br/>
We have a couple of fantastic CDs that are part story and part song that <br/>
we all love to listen to in the car.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite is called &quot;Seal Maiden: A Celtic Musical&quot; and it&#39;s folk <br/>
story about a Selkie that _The Secret of Roan Inish_ movie was based <br/>
on.  <br/>

Although there are quite a few titles that say &quot;toddler&quot; in them we have <br/>
not found them to be at all too &quot;babyish&quot;.  We haven&#39;t bought anything <br/>
with children singing the songs either though so I don&#39;t know about <br/>
those ones.<br/>

singing show tunes, my 13-year-old is totally Beatles and Grease-era, even Leslie <br/>
Gore (It&#39;s My Party) -- it&#39;s become part of her identity with her dance friends. <br/>
She is a Paul Girl. (Do and of you guys here remember when we&#39;d reveal our <br/>
favorite Beatle instead of our sign of the Zodiac, and people thought that was <br/>
all they needed to know to know us?)<br/>

That reminds me of my son learning to count past 10 when he was about <br/>
4.  For the life of me, I couldn&#39;t figure out WHY he would only count <br/>
to 39.  Then, while we were watching JC Superstar for what seemed <br/>
like the thousandth time, it clicked.  There is a scene where Pilate <br/>
is having JC flogged and he counts....you guessed it...to 39!<br/>

When my kids were little they hadn&#39;t seen that part of the movie.  That one <br/>
got paused and a forward wind while the kids were in the kitchen getting juice <br/>
or something during that scene.    And Tony and Maria used to be presumed to <br/>
have lived happily ever after, until one day I walked into the living room from <br/>
having been working on something in the bedrooms and I saw Marty and Holly <br/>
staring at the TV with an intensity I had never seen, and there was Maria, with <br/>
Chino&#39;s gun, crying, threatening the neighborhood.    DAMN IT!!!<br/>
<br/>
Later there was a Friends&#39; episode where Phoebe merrily told her friends how <br/>
many times she had seen Old Yeller and Bambi, and what happy movies they were, <br/>
all smiley.   Her mom had done what I did, only her (fictional) mom was <br/>
better at it than I had been.<br/>
<br/>
I used to let the crucifixion run because they knew about that anyway, but <br/>
the flogging was just too much for me, so I figured it would be too much for <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I really love the newer video of Jesus Christ Superstar, with <br/>
Jerome Pradon as Judas.  WOW.  <br/>
<br/>
Was Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat on that list of stuff for a <br/>
kid?  The video has the best narrator, but there&#39;s a CD which also has Donny <br/>
Osmond and it&#39;s my favorite of the three I&#39;ve heard, though the narrator is not <br/>
as glorious.   <br/>
