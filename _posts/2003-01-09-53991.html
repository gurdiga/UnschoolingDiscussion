<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643038034"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Some people are incredibly intuitive and spiritual and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;feel the need to articulate their experiences.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And those kind of people won&#39;t be much help on a list! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>UNLESS!! They learn better how to articulate.<br/>
Whoever wrote the first sentance, (sherry?) described me. I take things in, <br/>
my mind digests them, and things change. I am not so good at explaining my <br/>
beliefs to people. I&#39;m horrible at explaining unschooling in real life. I <br/>
just &quot;know&quot; it&#39;s right.<br/>
But due to many wonderful role models here, I&#39;ve been making attempts to <br/>
articulate my intuitions. I think I&#39;m getting better at it. And I&#39;m learning <br/>
more about the whys and wherefores of my beliefs.<br/>
Thanks all!<br/>
