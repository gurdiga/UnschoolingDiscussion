When I married DH, I had my life all planned out!  I was NEVER going to have kids!  I was going to become a nurse and then maybe own a business or become a doctor when I burned out of nursing.....then I accidentally became pregnant and EVERYTHING changed!  After I held that little baby in my arms, I decided that I was going to devote my whole life to her!  I quit college (just a few classes shy of a degree) and work (I did help DH from time to time in his business) and stayed home with my baby and have been here ever since!<br/>

Kim, I bet he depends on you just as much as you depend on him! :-)<br/>

depend on a man! Although I do wish I would have graduated from <br/>
college first before starting my family!<br/>
