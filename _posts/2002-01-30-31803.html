<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415293236">Our reading &quot;lessons&quot; are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; incorporated into our general read-aloud snuggle times and it&#39;s been a<br/>
&gt; good experience for us. Of course, the kid has always been a book hog so I<br/>
&gt; guess that has something to do w/it. We can literally spend the entire<br/>
&gt; day reading aloud and he never tires of it; he&#39;s just always had a<br/>
&gt; big love for books and that&#39;s why I guess he&#39;s so motivated.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 10 yr old is also a complete book lover......yet she still doesn&#39;t read<br/>
on her own- yet.  And my not allowing her freedom,  trying to impose my own<br/>
standards (with my attitude...I thought I was unschooling...I was not there<br/>
yet.)<br/>
I don&#39;t think that loving books is the influential factor.  And  I agree<br/>
with the point that some people are not necessarily &quot;academic&quot; or book<br/>
learning oriented and may never come to be the type that stays up too late<br/>
or neglects the housework to finish a good book....or even the type who<br/>
loves reading and manages to keep it in balance LOL<br/>
