<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221760523">&lt; I must own the only laid back Dalmatian in history ! Just kidding we<br/>
have a few in our neighbourhood but I&#39;ve yet to meet a hyper one. &gt;<br/>
 <br/>
My guess is that all the dalmations you&#39;re seeing were bred by reputable<br/>
breeders. I&#39;m a groomer and every single one I&#39;ve come in contact with<br/>
has been NUTS !!   My theory is that in this area there are a lot of<br/>
puppy mills, and lots of inbreeding going on.  I always recommend  that<br/>
you do your homework  before buying a puppy, and check out the breeder.</div>
