<div id="ygrps-yiv-978883869">You don&#39;t think your kids learn something watching Bart??  Wow.  Humor is<br/>
always a learning process.  To &quot;get it&quot;, you have to be willing to rearrange<br/>
the facts in your head, look at situations or words in a different light, if<br/>
that isn&#39;t learning, what is?<br/>
<br/>
My kids learn a tremendous amount from &quot;goofy&quot; shows.  The &quot;A Team&quot; is a big<br/>
hit here currently.  Almost every plot brings out questions and discussions.<br/>
When Boy George was a guest we talked most of the afternoon about sexuality<br/>
issues, prejudice, feeling different, etc..<br/>
<br/>
And even if I don&#39;t see them learning, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t happening.  I<br/>
trust my children to know what they need.<br/>
