&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;The Importance of Following a Strict School<br/>
&gt; &gt; Curriculum<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;By Jan Hunt<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;It has come to my attention that there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually some children out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;there who want to &quot;home school&quot; and don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand the value of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;following a school curriculum. Here is an open<br/>
&gt; &gt; letter to any child who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;feels that the school curriculum is not important:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;There can be no question that following a strict<br/>
&gt; &gt; curriculum helps to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;prepare you for adult life. I, for one, am<br/>
&gt; &gt; grateful to have followed a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;strict school curriculum, as the information which<br/>
&gt; &gt; I learned in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;classes has proven to be so useful in my life. For<br/>
&gt; &gt; example, I had two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;years of Latin, and although I hated it at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; time, it has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;immensely useful for solving crossword puzzles.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And such topics as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;solid geometry can come in very handy if you<br/>
&gt; &gt; decide to become a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;geometry teacher. And of course, there is always<br/>
&gt; &gt; the slight chance<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;that you will become one of the handful of<br/>
&gt; &gt; scientists who will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;actually use geometry in your career, and why wait<br/>
&gt; &gt; until college to learn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;You wouldn&#39;t want to be behind the other two guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; who made that career<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;choice.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Although curriculums have developed over many<br/>
&gt; &gt; years, and enormous<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;effort has been put into their preparation, still<br/>
&gt; &gt; there might be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;just a few skills and interests which were not<br/>
&gt; &gt; covered in your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;particular school. After all, they can only cover<br/>
&gt; &gt; so much material<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;in 11,000 hours! Don&#39;t worry about this; you can<br/>
&gt; &gt; always purchase<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;courses at your local community college in such<br/>
&gt; &gt; minor topics as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;dealing constructively with anger, responding<br/>
&gt; &gt; helpfully to a crying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;baby, performing household and auto repairs,<br/>
&gt; &gt; choosing a satisfying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;career, selecting a compatible mate, spending time<br/>
&gt; &gt; comfortably with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;those not born in your birth year, spending  time<br/>
&gt; &gt; comfortably alone,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;communicating clearly with the opposite sex,<br/>
&gt; &gt; finding information on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;topics all by yourself, balancing a budget,<br/>
&gt; &gt; filling out tax forms,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;identifying personal interests, communicating with<br/>
&gt; &gt; relatives,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;selecting a rewarding hobby, helping a frustrated<br/>
&gt; &gt; toddler, selecting a<br/>
&gt; &gt; diet<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;which meets your personal nutritional needs,<br/>
&gt; &gt; successful intervention of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;conflict situations, negotiating successfully with<br/>
&gt; &gt; those who disagree<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;with you,  and above all, finding a well-paying<br/>
&gt; &gt; job to pay for all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;these extra classes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;But you don&#39;t have to wait until you graduate to<br/>
&gt; &gt; pursue those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;interests not covered at your school; after you<br/>
&gt; &gt; get home each day and<br/>
&gt; &gt; after<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;spending two or three hours on homework, household<br/>
&gt; &gt; chores and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;competitive sports,  there will always be a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; minutes left to pursue<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;personal interests. Remember, you are really the<br/>
&gt; &gt; only one who knows<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;what interests you, and  learning  takes place<br/>
&gt; &gt; most readily when you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;are interested in the topic, so those few minutes<br/>
&gt; &gt; a day are very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;important. Just be sure to do all your homework<br/>
&gt; &gt; and sports first, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;your friends won&#39;t be jealous of how you spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; your time. Friendships<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;are important too. In fact, probably the most<br/>
&gt; &gt; important reason to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;follow a strict curriculum is that not only your<br/>
&gt; &gt; friends, but your parents<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and teachers won&#39;t feel resentful. They all had to<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow a curriculum,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;and they would feel very jealous if you don&#39;t. And<br/>
&gt; &gt; since you are just a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;child, their feelings are a lot more important<br/>
&gt; &gt; than yours. So it is really<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;fortunate that they have the power to force you to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do things the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;way they had to. Don&#39;t worry about this- you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; &gt; get your chance to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;throw your weight around with your own kids!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Perhaps you&#39;ve heard rumors that homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids who follow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;their own interests score a little higher- just a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few years- than<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;school kids on academic and social skills. Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; let this worry you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unlike<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;these spoiled kids, you&#39;ll always be able to find<br/>
&gt; &gt; work, because you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;learning the important lesson of doing what you&#39;re<br/>
&gt; &gt; told, and our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;society will always need people who are willing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; do the boring jobs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;Think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;how proud you&#39;ll feel, taking on responsibilities<br/>
&gt; &gt; that others refuse<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to do, simply because it doesn&#39;t &quot;interest&quot; them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s a good feeling to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;be needed and appreciated!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Above all, don&#39;t worry about missing a few topics.<br/>
&gt; &gt; After all, where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;else but in school can you learn the really<br/>
&gt; &gt; valuable life skills like<br/>
&gt; &gt; blind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;obedience, blending in with the crowd, fearing<br/>
&gt; &gt; authority figures,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;submerging bad feelings into the subconscious, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; understanding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;the dog-eat-dog nature of reality?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Stay in school and do what they tell you to do,<br/>
&gt; &gt; right or wrong. How<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;else can you grow up to be a solid citizen who<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t make waves?<br/>
