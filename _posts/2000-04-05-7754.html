You hit the nail on the head. I have such a difficult time explaining to my <br/>
husband and other folks . Why I didn&#39;t use a book to teach something, Im in <br/>
the closet still with unschooling because my family is completely freaked. I <br/>
was the black sheep in the family , the one who always &quot;learned the hard way&quot; <br/>
 the one who never conformed to society . So they think homeschooling is my <br/>
way of being the black sheep . Anyway even if I cant say any of that to <br/>
anyone thanks for letting me think it!! (g)<br/>

 This is another big part of unschooling, being able to recognise the ways we <br/>
learn best, being able to recognise our talents and using those talents to <br/>
get where we want to be (even to figure out where we want to be, which is <br/>
probably much more difficult :-) )   &gt;&gt;<br/>
Well said, Tracy.<br/>
