<div id="ygrps-yiv-65828377">&quot;Something has happened that I thought impossible....I have stopped trying to <br/>
force my kids to do chores (almost all the time, not perfect yet &lt;g&gt;) and <br/>
have cheerfully done these things myself instead. Now I have a tidier house, <br/>
I seem to have more time now that I am not nagging anyone else to do things <br/>
that *I* want done and, wonder of wonders, the children have started helping <br/>
spontaneously and happily agreeing to polite requests for help (I am willing <br/>
to accept a &quot;no&quot; when I ask). Now that I am treating them with true respect, <br/>
I am getting it back.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that has been my experience also Kerrin!! I&#39;ve had this lesson come home <br/>
in amazing ways all  week.<br/>
Trevor begged me to go get paint today, so after a visit to Home Depot he <br/>
spent the evening painting his room.<br/>
I was at work, I explained that I had to work tonight and wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
available to help.<br/>
He didn&#39;t care, he just really wanted to paint. So he did.<br/>
I came home to Sierra (5yo) helping him, she spent hours assisting the paint <br/>
project.<br/>
She&#39;s a very focused five year old!!<br/>
I helped finish up some edges after I got home.<br/>
His room is going to look fabulous, and it was ALL his doing.  It&#39;s so <br/>
amazing what can happen if we back off and just trust. Seems so simple now, <br/>
but the journey was bumpy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466747867">**She would have other kitchen duties if not that. Many meals I <br/>
prepare on my own, but she does help me quite often. We live in <br/>
the same apartment and as such are a team.**<br/>
<br/>
Roberta, I think the dissonance you may be feeling between <br/>
what you&#39;re writing and the responses you&#39;re getting might have <br/>
to do more with word choice than with differing ideas.<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;d like to reiterate what Sandra said. There are (basically) <br/>
two types of unschooling lists. One is for support where people <br/>
share what they do and so they can get to know each other. The <br/>
other is for discussion. People share problems they&#39;re having so <br/>
they can discuss it :-) So if there&#39;s anything you do that you don&#39;t <br/>
want people to pull out and say &quot;What do you mean by that? <br/>
Have you really examined what you&#39;re doing?&quot; it&#39;s best not to <br/>
post it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that the list doesn&#39;t accept people for who they are. It&#39;s <br/>
that this list is specifically for discussing ideas. It&#39;s *for* holding <br/>
practices and thoughts and ideas up to examination.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than a place to kick back and let it all hang out, this is a <br/>
place where people come to have their ideas challenged, to look <br/>
at life in ways they&#39;d never considered before.<br/>
<br/>
Basically on this list the filter through which ideas pass is <br/>
treating children as fellow human beings. If someone presents <br/>
an idea where it sounds like the child is being treated in a way <br/>
that an adult would be upset to be treated, the idea will raise red <br/>
flags for many people. And the idea will be discussed.<br/>
<br/>
**She would have other kitchen duties if not that.**<br/>
<br/>
This might be a word use problem.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Have&quot; suggests that your daughter has been assigned kitchen <br/>
duties by someone else. &quot;Have&quot; suggests that if she doesn&#39;t do <br/>
them then there will be punishment.<br/>
<br/>
Now that *idea* will raise red flags and people will want to <br/>
discuss the *idea* of making children -- not your child, not what <br/>
you do in your home -- but the idea of making children do chores.<br/>
<br/>
Step back for a moment and treat this as though it weren&#39;t about <br/>
what you&#39;re doing, but about broader ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Does it help build a good relationship between two humans for <br/>
one human to have the power over another to tell them what to <br/>
do and to punish them if they don&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
(Step back. This isn&#39;t about you. It&#39;s about how *people* feel.)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of parents would say no, it doesn&#39;t help build a good <br/>
relationshp. They&#39;d probably be thinking about their spouse, <br/>
saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want my husband to tell me what to do and <br/>
punish me if I don&#39;t!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And yet, without realizing it, they&#39;d be doing exactly that to their <br/>
kids! They&#39;d make their kids do something and punish them (or <br/>
make them feel bad or get mad at them or ask them over and <br/>
over and over ...) And they&#39;d say &quot;Yes, I&#39;m making her, but ___.&quot; <br/>
And they&#39;d fill in the blank with &quot;they&#39;re kids&quot;, &quot;they don&#39;t know as <br/>
much,&quot; &quot;someone has to be in charge,&quot; and so on and so on.<br/>
<br/>
But what it all boils down to, regardless of the justification, we <br/>
are tearing down a relationship when we assert our authority <br/>
over someone weaker. When we take away someone&#39;s power to <br/>
say no, we are tearing down a good relationship and creating a <br/>
relationship of adversaries: Parent vs child. And when there are <br/>
adversaries, there is a struggle for power. And when there is a <br/>
struggle for power there are winners and losers.<br/>
<br/>
But none of those words: struggle, power, winner, loser have <br/>
anything to do with building a loving relationship, do they? <br/>
They&#39;re all really yucky words to put into a relationship.<br/>
<br/>
And there are better ways to be with kids than as adversaries. <br/>
There are ways to live life together, get all the things done that <br/>
we feel we&#39;d like to get done *and* build a loving relationship <br/>
with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
So we talk about it here. A lot :-)<br/>
<br/>
**We live in the same apartment and as such are a team.**<br/>
<br/>
This is the point that most parents would love to be at :-)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that being a team doesn&#39;t just happen by existing <br/>
together. Children aren&#39;t born realizing they&#39;re part of a team so <br/>
they need to pitch in. In fact children are born believing everything <br/>
is about them ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Traditional parenting would say that kids need to be taught that <br/>
life isn&#39;t about them. Traditional parenting would say kids need <br/>
to learn to do what parents say so kids can learn that life isn&#39;t all <br/>
about them.<br/>
<br/>
But what that teaches kids is that life is all about being an adult <br/>
so you can be bigger and get your way by telling others what to <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
(Turn that idea upside down. What if an adult thinks another <br/>
adult needs to learn the lesson that others should be taken into <br/>
consideration too so starts ordering the other adult around, <br/>
making the second adult do what the first adult wants. It just <br/>
feels *wrong*. But most parents, even if they see the wrongness <br/>
of it, think that&#39;s life and kids just have to learn.)<br/>
<br/>
On this list we help people find better ways! :-) We help them see <br/>
that we can support kids in their belief that it&#39;s all about them. <br/>
While *at the same time* helping them see  it&#39;s all about mom <br/>
and big sister and dad too.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that most parents don&#39;t know how to get to a <br/>
feeling of &quot;we&#39;re a team.&quot; Or they think they know but the ways <br/>
they&#39;ll go about it -- for instance making their kids do chores <br/>
because they&#39;re a part of a team -- only work for kids who are <br/>
very compliant or desperately needing to please. Those ways <br/>
tend to have the opposite effect on kids with other personalities. <br/>
And when parents don&#39;t get the results they expect,  when the <br/>
kids act resentful of being made to do chores, act as though their <br/>
parents care more about the things they&#39;re making the kids do <br/>
than they do about the kids, the parents wonder what&#39;s wrong <br/>
with their kids. They wonder why Roberta&#39;s daughter is chopping <br/>
vegetables happily for her mom while their own kids roll their <br/>
eyes and groan and do half-assed jobs.<br/>
<br/>
On this list we help people examine what goes into building <br/>
relationship so that we become people our kids want to help :-) <br/>
It&#39;s not just luck if kids help. There are ways we can relate to kids <br/>
that will foster a great relationship.<br/>
<br/>
**Through cooking I teach her her heritage - both sides.**<br/>
<br/>
Teach is another word land mine.<br/>
<br/>
Teach, for many people who are trying to understand <br/>
unschooling, is a loaded word. It brings up pictures of a teacher <br/>
pushing information into a child.<br/>
<br/>
We try to help people drop that image. And to help them drop that <br/>
image we try to help them see how learning is different from <br/>
teaching.<br/>
<br/>
(There are ways that teaching is like learning *but* it&#39;s examining <br/>
how learning is *different* from teaching that helps people get <br/>
unschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
Teaching is about pushing information in. Learning is about <br/>
someone pulling something they want in.<br/>
<br/>
Once people can turn their thinking around from trying to get <br/>
what they want a child to learn into the child to thinking in terms <br/>
of what the child wants to pull in for himself, they&#39;re a lot closer to <br/>
understanding unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
**Surely there are some things we can learn about how to do <br/>
chores, but basically they are just something that need to be <br/>
done and if not we don&#39;t eat, have clean clothes, or a clean <br/>
home.**<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Need to&quot; is another word land mine. As you point out while there <br/>
are things that we &quot;need to do&quot; it&#39;s helpful -- freeing! -- to turn that <br/>
picture up side down so we can see it in a new way.<br/>
<br/>
IF we see everything we do as a choice, then it frees us from <br/>
some outside mysterious power that&#39;s supposedly making us <br/>
do such and such.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people get trapped thinking they &quot;have to&quot; make dinner. <br/>
The truth is that they don&#39;t. They *choose* to make dinner for <br/>
reasons that they don&#39;t think are even worth considering. But they <br/>
*are* worth considering because if they aren&#39;t considered then it <br/>
feels like we don&#39;t have a choice.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have to make dinner. We could order pizza. We could <br/>
eat frozen dinners. We could hire a chef. We could make a <br/>
month of meals on one day and put them in the freezer. (The list <br/>
could go on.)<br/>
<br/>
But someone might *choose* to make dinner because ... It&#39;s <br/>
cheaper. It&#39;s healthier. It&#39;s a way they enjoy showing someone <br/>
they care for them. (The list could go on.)<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped drive this idea home for me is that I always <br/>
felt I had to clean the toilet every x number of days. I didn&#39;t listen <br/>
to the voice ;-) but that voice was there nagging me whenever I <br/>
looked at the toilet. And that guilt making voice made me <br/>
resentful and rebellious so that I didn&#39;t clean the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
But then I stopped and said, no, I don&#39;t *have to* clean the toilet. <br/>
But sometimes it&#39;s really nice for the toilet to be clean. And from <br/>
then it became a choice. I no longer *had to* clean the toilet any <br/>
more! But sometimes I *chose to* clean the toilet because I <br/>
wanted it clean :-) And ever since then, because I know I can say <br/>
no anytime I want to, I do clean my toilet more often than when I <br/>
&quot;had to&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make any sense?<br/>
<br/>
No one *has to* think that way but it&#39;s a really helpful way if <br/>
someone finds themselves stuck with the idea of &quot;have to&quot; and <br/>
they&#39;d like to change.<br/>
<br/>
It really  really really helps on a discussion list to step back from <br/>
something you do when it&#39;s being discussed and look at it as an <br/>
abstract idea. Look at it from a distance as though it&#39;s <br/>
generalized and not about you any more. Turn it this way and <br/>
that. Turn kids into adults. Turn adults into kids. Turn ideas <br/>
upside down and inside out. Expand it. If it&#39;s a good idea then it <br/>
can cover more than one thing. For example many people come <br/>
to unschooling thinking it&#39;s just about academic learning, that <br/>
kids can learn best by learning what interests them. And then <br/>
they start thinking, hmm, if that&#39;s true, then why is it true only of <br/>
academics? Why, if I&#39;ll let my child choose when and how to <br/>
learn math concepts, am I making her sit at the table and learn <br/>
table manners? And they&#39;ll expand it more and start questioning <br/>
all sorts of things they never thought to question.<br/>
<br/>
Basically this list is for people who want the ideas of how to build <br/>
a relationship with their kids, who don&#39;t want to do things that will <br/>
tear the relationship down.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing things differently, that&#39;s okay. :-) It&#39;s just that this <br/>
isn&#39;t the list to *talk* about how we all do things differently. It&#39;s a <br/>
place to discuss how we can respect our kids and still manage <br/>
to get all the things done we want to and discuss that in ways <br/>
that will help others figure out how to make it work for them too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789907822">Thanks to everyone who challenged my thinking about chores...much food  for <br/>
thought.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Someone mentioned that it was important to figure out what helped develop  <br/>
the positive relationships in our family.  This has been interesting  to think <br/>
about.  I can&#39;t say for certain, and certainly I can&#39;t answer for  my children <br/>
(but I plan to ask them when we get together tomorrow night), but  from my <br/>
angle, what I felt with our family was that we were all in &quot;it&quot; whatever  the <br/>
&quot;it&quot; was together -- that we were a family.  I think I had developed  the sense <br/>
of the importance of this from my family of origin; I was the oldest  of nine <br/>
children, and we were poor and always on the fringe, even with  relatives, most <br/>
of whom lived close by, so that we could really feel the hurt  from lack of <br/>
inclusion.  So, we developed a sense of family because we were  isolated.  I <br/>
wanted to develop a sense of family from a positive  perspective, with shared <br/>
goals/responsibilities, fun times and such.  I  won&#39;t pretend I did this well; I <br/>
think I mostly did the best I could at the  time, building on what I knew <br/>
worked and didn&#39;t work from my family of  origin.  Now I see my daughter building <br/>
an even stronger family, and I  learn much from her, and I take comfort in <br/>
the fact that my family, as it moves  through the generations, is becoming <br/>
healthier with each generation.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again for giving me so many ideas to think about; I appreciate  this <br/>
list because so many members are willing to offer their insight and  <br/>
perspective.<br/>
