<div id="ygrps-yiv-392986715">I teach karate to a bunch of school at homer kids.  The parents think we are<br/>
nuts ( but in the nicest of ways) for unschooling.  They are always wanting<br/>
to know how you learn about such and such without curriculum.  It has become<br/>
a running joke for me to point out concepts in &quot;educationese&quot; for the<br/>
parents as they occur in class.  When discussing angles of attack, I turn<br/>
around and say &quot;See, geometry&quot;  with a big grin or when doing takedowns, I<br/>
say &quot;See centrifugal force&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
The parents have finally figured out that karate is basically physics with<br/>
attitude and, kind of sadly, are now much more supportive of their kids.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of my favorite things about the karate school where Kirby goes is (in <br/>
addition to the physics! &lt;g&gt;) the philosophy, the character building, the <br/>
ideals/concepts and the history.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t suppose any of that would impress many school-at-home families, since <br/>
the history of Okinawa isn&#39;t on their curriculum and the rest of it is too <br/>
nebulous to measure.<br/>
<br/>
Their loss!<br/>
