<div id="ygrps-yiv-672682753">I&#39;m taking off for a couple of days to go down and move my Mom to a<br/>
different care home, this one in Sequim, WA.  Last time I didn&#39;t go no mail<br/>
and came back to 879 messages after 2 days.  This time all my high-traffic<br/>
groups are going no mail.<br/>
