 <br/>
These kinds of quizzes are really popular with kids and teens, and there  are <br/>
tons of them out there.  This particular one gives a Greek goddess at  the <br/>
end and tells about her.  You can go back to the main page where  there&#39;s just <br/>
general info on Greek goddesses, or you can keep changing your  answers and see <br/>
what you get.<br/>
 <br/>
For kids, this is reading and history and vocabulary and mythology.  <br/>
(I mean if it&#39;s fun, those are the dots they might connect with it.)<br/>
 <br/>
The internet is filled with fun quizzes like this, and  <br/>
choose-your-own-adventure kinds of sites and other such things.  <br/>
 <br/>
If you ask your kids they might already know of some good ones.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1735705014">Well, I&#39;m Gaia according to the quiz. I&#39;m a  sucker for quizzes like <br/>
that. When the girls are finished playing, I&#39;ll see if they want to do <br/>
it, too.<br/>
<br/>
We just finished watching Troy, which the kids loved because it tied <br/>
into Ages of Mythology and the myths they love to read. The bonus disc <br/>
was cool, too, and it included a Temple of the Gods where one can click <br/>
on each statue to hear a description.<br/>
<br/>
The kids will laugh when I tell them I came up as Gaia--she&#39;s their <br/>
favorite Titan on Ages of Mythology. We talk about the Earth a lot, and <br/>
Sam will say very solemnly, &quot;Everything&#39;s Gaia, isn&#39;t it mom?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Well, mom?  <br/>
Is it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s been a good question to ask over the years when people say something <br/>
is &quot;not natural.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s man-made.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Aren&#39;t men natural?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yeah, but...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Honey is bee-made; is it &#39;natural&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They made plastic out of oil.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Is oil natural? Are men natural?  Maybe they make plastic like bees make <br/>
honey.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Other things besides honey to puzzle out?<br/>
amber<br/>
ambergris<br/>
salt (does it depend how it&#39;s processed or not?)<br/>
soap (what if it&#39;s from yucca root or some other such sudsy, acidic plant?)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Irritating questions, maybe, but I scored &quot;Athena&quot; and she wasn&#39;t natural her <br/>
own self, and messes with industry and sciences and nosy questions.  Marty <br/>
says she&#39;s goddess of the hunt, too.  He&#39;s usually right.<br/>

<br/>
Hmmmm...if memory serves Artemis is goddess of the hunt. Athena is <br/>
goddess of wisdom and maybe war too? She gives the cool armor and stuff. <br/>
One myth says she sprang fully formed from Zeus&#39; head. She&#39;s very strong.<br/>
<br/>
amber...<br/>
<br/>
Very cool stuff. I have a bracelet we were looking at just recently that <br/>
has a mosquito fossilized inside. We had watched the beginning of <br/>
Jurassic Park where they get the dino dna from mosquitoes trapped in <br/>
amber. Much fun. We ended up not watching the whole movie, deciding it <br/>
was probably too scary once the raptors start coming after the kids. But <br/>
the beginning was cool to see and talk about.<br/>
<br/>
See Sandra, this is why I love your house as a museum piece. *g* I <br/>
identify with it.<br/>

her maybe? The kids have really loved Age of Mythology, and it is <br/>
fun/cool to see the many different ways that they use it. My <br/>
daughter loves the animals and tends to do things like assigning <br/>
trolls and other large creatures to guard her pigs from hungry <br/>
villagers. They have one scenario where they have a saved game that <br/>
they each play at times. They each have their own island in that <br/>
game and they will send things over to each other on boats. They <br/>
also do the traditional campaigns and stuff, especially my son who&#39;s <br/>
really into the whole mythology stuff.<br/>
<br/>
 We loved Troy too. There&#39;s a good National Geographic Behind the <br/>
Movie DVD that we got on Netflix about Troy as well. We read the <br/>
Iliad and are in the middle of the Odyssey and it&#39;s been fun to see <br/>
how the movie differed from the stories in places. We haven&#39;t gotten <br/>
the bonus disk yet, but it sounds like it might be worth getting.<br/>

<br/>
I prefer Gaia, thank you. ;)<br/>
<br/>
==The kids have really loved Age of Mythology, and it is fun/cool to see <br/>

<br/>
Have they figured out yet how to create their own game? You can choose <br/>
all the different available things--from warriors to animals to <br/>
buildings--from a pull down menu, I think. You can create your own land, <br/>
water ways, etc. Sam and I had lots of fun with that one day recently <br/>
when he was showing me what he did.<br/>

<br/>
Em and I both thought the bonus disc was more interesting than the NG <br/>
Troy, which we had watched first. I didn&#39;t realize that I had to order <br/>
the bonus disc as a separate choice in my movie queue--we&#39;re new to this <br/>
online movie rental thing.  We read a couple passages from the <br/>
Iliad--enough to find out that&#39;s why Achilles calls Aggamemnon a &quot;sack <br/>
of wine,&quot; which seems like a somewhat bizarre epithet.<br/>

some English gentleman who created a floor-less ballroom under his <br/>
