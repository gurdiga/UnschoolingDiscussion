&gt; Typically, the term linguistic regsiter is used to describe the<br/>
&gt; specialized language used by people of a certain occupation, or with a<br/>
&gt; certain specialized interest... lepidopterists have a linguistic<br/>

 Registers are varieties that are distinguished by &#39;use&#39;: topic, setting,<br/>
relationship between speakers (power and solidarity/familiarity)<br/>
<br/>
Everyone has a repertoire that includes many registers<br/>
<br/>
Dialects and Registers vary at every level of linguistic structure:<br/>
phonetic/phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic<br/>
Linguistic variants take on social meaning<br/>

For example, in English we might speak of a popular youth register (my<br/>
readers will perhaps suspect that I am starting at what I regard as the<br/>
low end of the scale, and they might even sympathize with my jaundiced<br/>
judgement). Let me define this register as that level of speech which we<br/>
associate with Triple-J and other forms of media addressed to our hapless<br/>
young. Next we might consider the level of educated discourse, the kind<br/>
of speech that one would expect to hear in ordinary conversation between<br/>
educated people. Then there are technical registers: the language of<br/>
sailors, or motor mechanics, or cricketers for example. This leads on to<br/>
literary registers � the language of books � which may themselves be<br/>
classified chronologically: Johnsonian, Shakespearean, Chaucerian English<br/>
for example.<br/>

If you&#39;ve read this far you must be interested . . . <br/>
There seems to be a brewing debate among linguists who want to separate<br/>
differences based on profession or technology from differences based on<br/>
socio-economic status and situational differences.  Some want to apply<br/>
the word &quot;register&quot; ONLY to profession registers and use the word &quot;style&quot;<br/>
for the rest.  I expect this debate to get as heated (among linguists) as<br/>
the one about using &quot;their&quot; as a third person singular pronoun.<br/>
