<div id="ygrps-yiv-933492213">Samantha: I would be extremely grateful to find a 7-year-old who would be <br/>
willing and responsible [basic stuff - no playing with knives, etc!] enough <br/>
to be this mommy&#39;s helper for an hour or so, and spend some time playing with <br/>
my 3.5 year old dd!! She is an only child, and just worships &quot;older&quot; girls <br/>
right now; she would love this situation, too. [I would be home, in hearing, <br/>
if not sight, distance at all times.]<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve actually tried to find someone, without luck. Just in case, we&#39;re in <br/>
the Columbus, OH area! :)<br/>
