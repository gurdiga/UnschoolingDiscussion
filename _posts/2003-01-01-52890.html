<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274128741">I never thought to mark this as special until my daughter turned 7 on March<br/>
7th this past year.  We were away in Greenville, SC at the time, where my<br/>
husband was working on contract.  We rode horses, had a birthday dinner with<br/>
his co-workers, and learned to call women older than ourselves by the<br/>
honorific &quot;Miss&quot; before their first names.  Sure was different from her<br/>
other birthdays!<br/>
