<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372745820">=== You could offer him really fun and exciting drinks in a sippy cup <br/>
during the day when he might have wanted to nurse—milkshake, chocolate <br/>
milk, something he likes. ===<br/>
<br/>
My Husband and I do that, but he doesn&#39;t want any substitute. He refuses <br/>
everything we offer or he agrees first but does not drink/eat it later. <br/>
Then he cries for my milk and I feel bad.<br/>
I think he is not ready yet.<br/>
<br/>
=== It&#39;s not my happiest memory, but nursing him while I was nursing <br/>
Marty was VERY hard for me, physically and emotionally. It wasn&#39;t good <br/>
for Marty, either, who was six months old. ===<br/>
<br/>
I fully relate to that. I tried hard to be able to nurse my son at all <br/>
after he came home from the hospital. We had a great time but I don&#39;t <br/>
have it in me to continue (I pushed my limit for half a year now and <br/>
still try to). This is hard. I feel like I need to make a stand against <br/>
my son - this makes me unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t eat much either and when he does it&#39;s usually sweets and <br/>
sugary food. I read somewhere on your page that somebody made a list of <br/>
what her child actually ate for two days. I&#39;m doing the same now.<br/>
<br/>
So far for today he had:<br/>
1 pancake with sugar & chocolate<br/>
1 Banana-Yoghurt Icecone (lots of sugar in it)<br/>
part of a bread roll (white bread)<br/>
half of a cookie<br/>
1 hot milk with some chocolate<br/>
and some sugar cubes, sweets and a sucker (small)<br/>
(and some of my milk)<br/>
<br/>
This tells me.. he really likes sweet food. I know he likes fish and <br/>
potatoes, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=== ARE you saying yes to everything he wants? WHY?<br/>
Avoiding arbitrary and reactionary &quot;no&quot; is good.<br/>
Saying yes more than no is good.<br/>
Do you believe somehow that someone has required you to &quot;say yes to <br/>
everything he wants&quot;?<br/>
Do you think it&#39;s &quot;the rule&quot; for unschoolers? ===<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a rule at all. Sometimes I say yes to soon or without <br/>
regard to my own needs. I want to be supportive and full of yesses (I <br/>
think I read this somewhere on your site, Sandra) - I feel awful when <br/>
saying no. I don&#39;t want to feel bad and disconnected, so I go for yes.. <br/>
which regularly leads to me feeling overwhelmed and tired (which leads <br/>
to yelling and saying mean things and I don&#39;t want that but I <br/>
desperately want to rest). Nevertheless I realized i&#39;ve been saying no a <br/>
lot more lately or talking to him in a distant command-tone just telling <br/>
hin what to do. Not lovingly. Not nicely.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for providing this list and giving me the opportunity to get <br/>
things off my chest and out of my head. It helps me realize where I <br/>
could do better and how.<br/>
Today was a very good day and I&#39;m really happy about that. Even the past <br/>
few days were great, as I chose to talk to my child more, to explain <br/>
things, to give information I had and he had not. It took more time than <br/>
just saying no and it felt a whole lot better!</div>

<br/>
Don&#39;t think of it that way.<br/>
Not you vs. him.  <br/>
<br/>
Think of it as helping him move forward, and for you to focus on nursing the younger child.  You need to be a good mom to the baby, and if the older child is preventing that, and your guilt is preventing it, rearrange your thoughts.<br/>

I&#39;ve very often said &quot;Don&#39;t do what you don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You are NOT &quot;supportive and full of yesses&quot; if you&#39;re feeling bad, disonnceted, overwhelmed, tired, yelling, being mean, doing things you don&#39;t want, and desperately wanting ANYthing.  <br/>
<br/>

I like my site a lot, but you seemto be doing things because you saw them on my site.  If they don&#39;t make sense, don&#39;t do them.  If you do them and they make sense, very cool!<br/>
<br/>
If you feel like listing foods, and it&#39;s helping you, that&#39;s fine.  But it shouldn&#39;t be for this:   &quot;this tells me.. he really likes sweet food&quot;   Give him a variety and don&#39;t worry.  Let him decide for real, immediate reasons.  Be generous.  Be kind.  I don&#39;t think you should drag out the weaning.  It&#39;s not working for you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be an agreement, not a principle. It&#39;s an agreement *if* the kids feel they can renegotiate if it&#39;s not working for them. If they can&#39;t change it, then it&#39;s a rule.<br/>
<br/>
One thing is that kids aren&#39;t the same as parents. Nor should they be. Kids are dependent on us. They trust that what we will keep them safe as they explore what interests them. So when a parent says (essentially), &quot;I want you to agree to try just one bite of whatever I think you&#39;ll like,&quot; the child will feel the pressure of the parent&#39;s greater power and knowledge.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are highly sensitive to taste, texture, sight, smell. Asking such a child to agree to one bite is like your wife asking you to try just one bite when the world of food has turned into liver, beets, overcooked spinach (or whatever you find repulsive.) My daughter had a broad range of food she enjoyed. Until it started narrowing at 4. Until puberty approached, about 11ish, there were few foods that appealed to her. Then suddenly things tasted good again and she&#39;d try just about anything.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra let her kids know if they didn&#39;t like it that they could spit it into her hand. (Which is a nice touch since you don&#39;t want them spitting it onto the table at Grandma&#39;s! ;-))<br/>
<br/>
Parents can give kids information that&#39;s useful *to them*. You can let them know it&#39;s similar to something you know they like. But then let it go. Don&#39;t become emotionally invested in your child&#39;s choices. If you want to invest your emotions, invest them in creating an atmosphere where kids feel supported in trying what appeals to them AND turning down what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Second thing is, do you have such an agreement with your friends? With your own parents? Wouldn&#39;t that seem awkward and weird and controlling?<br/>
<br/>
While that&#39;s *one* test it isn&#39;t meant to be a final judgement of whether something is relationship building with kids. It is often, though, a good wake up call that an idea that sounds great in theory will feel very differently to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I like to thing of them as principles now<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A principle is an idea that applies to many situations, not one specific one. Kindness. Trustworthiness. Learning. Exploration. Support.<br/>
<br/>
A collection of principles that work together to achieve some ideal is a philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I probably wouldn&#39;t make trying a rule today, I would just talk about the principle <br/>
&gt; of trying new things and only rejecting them if they don&#39;t work for you. I would <br/>
&gt; set the example by trying things myself.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Even better: move talk down on your priority list. Instead, create an atmosphere that supports exploration. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better to be kind, to help your kids meet their needs in ways that are kind to others, to help them do things that are kind than to talk about the principle of kindness.<br/>
