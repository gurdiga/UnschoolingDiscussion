<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039726907">I feel like I am pulled in many directions lately. I have an 18 year old<br/>
who has been feeling very depressed. She is on med&#39;s and refuses<br/>
counseling. She is determined to get a highschool diploma. Nothing else<br/>
that has been offered suits her. I am supporting her wishes and watching<br/>
her struggle. I went in to her 504 meeting with her, that turned out to<br/>
not be a 504 meeting because the principle thought it wasn&#39;t one. This<br/>
principle told my daughter that there weren&#39;t any funds to help her -<br/>
that she (principle) has to go beg for money for the school. They always<br/>
say that by the way... We do have a strong ally who is assisting my<br/>
daughter. Without this person - who is constantly overstressed, having<br/>
migranes, running to the nurses office, and calling her support people -<br/>
my daughter would not be getting a diploma from public school. The<br/>
principle mentioned something like &quot;we can&#39;t have kids making up their<br/>
own schooling.&quot; My daughter had a suggestion on how she could best be<br/>
taught. I really &quot;couldn&#39;t hold it&quot; any longer and uttered &quot;heaven<br/>
forbid a child would have something to do with deciding how they are<br/>
educated.&quot; It didn&#39;t go over very well.<br/>
I feel very frustrated because this daughter has been feeling suicidal -<br/>
school knows and she is getting help - has been on a 504 for depression<br/>
for atleast 3 years, etc. School is about money, I know...<br/>
I wanted to come home and bathe in unschooling territory. For some<br/>
reason the older kids now 20 and 21 keep pestering me about &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
I feel obligated to explain to them once again what is happening as far<br/>
as unteaching their younger siblings goes. My 21 year old was very upset<br/>
about thinking the 12 year old should be writing essays to prepare for<br/>
college. I get so frustrated I don&#39;t know what to say. I told her that<br/>
if the 12 year old decides to go to a school/college he will be ready<br/>
because it will be his choice, he will be prepared, etc. She then<br/>
screamed at me. She said I don&#39;t know how to talk to people. I mentioned<br/>
the fact that he is 12 and has a while to decide about any form of<br/>
higher education he chooses. She said that is not enough structure. I<br/>
tried to explain that she is correct. There isn&#39;t a lot of structure in<br/>
the way I am unteaching. I write down everything they do - which is alot<br/>
- every day. I personally think they are learning more than ever<br/>
especially my now 15 year old who has been labeled dyslexic and bipolar.<br/>
They are right though, it doesn&#39;t look anything like public school and I<br/>
for one am very grateful for that. Michele<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are these older kids half-siblings?  Did they go to school?  I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if they&#39;re really jealous without realizing it.  They could be covering up<br/>
their jealousy by focusing on their &quot;concerns&quot;.  You can tell them why<br/>
you&#39;re doing things the way you are with the younger ones, but you may just<br/>
have to pull the, &quot;I&#39;m the parent.  When you have kids you can raise them<br/>
the way you think is best.  I wish I had unschooled you as well, but we<br/>
can&#39;t change the past.&quot;  Or something along those lines.<br/>

Meds without counselling won&#39;t help much.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe find a way for her to try two or three different counsellors to see if <br/>
she clicks with someone.<br/>

<br/>
Can she just take a few college courses so on applications she can mark &quot;some <br/>
college&quot; instead of &quot;high school&quot; as highest level of education?<br/>
<br/>
She can just bypass the whole high school thing.<br/>

home, but I&#39;ve never been asked whether I actually graduated from high<br/>
school when I put down 2 years college.<br/>
