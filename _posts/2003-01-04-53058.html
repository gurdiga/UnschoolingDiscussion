<div id="ygrps-yiv-291962613">**2. How can we ensure that the rights of the child are respected in<br/>
relation to their educational provision?**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to see them frankly admit that standardized government<br/>
education is not the best way to meet the learning needs of all children.<br/>
<br/>
And, since a government institution is self-preserving, I&#39;d like for<br/>
parents and/or children to have explicitly the decision-making power<br/>
about their schooling.  (I don&#39;t believe anyone who works for the school<br/>
can make consistently unbiased decisions in the interests of children. <br/>
I don&#39;t want to go down that road at all, if it can be avoided.)<br/>

PS  (They may be inclinded to &quot;compromise&quot; and not ever give you 100% of<br/>
what you ask for.  So, ask for the moon!  Ask for a shorter school day<br/>
and more community-based, beyond the classroom learning for ALL students.)</div>
