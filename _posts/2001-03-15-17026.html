<br/>
Turn off the TV. If that doesn&#39;t work, unplug it and lock it in a <br/>
closet for a few weeks!!!! ;o)<br/>
<br/>
My 8-year-old daughter would watch TV all day long, every day, if she <br/>
could. I&#39;ve always limited her use of it, but I recently took TV away <br/>
from her for two weeks. She hasn&#39;t asked to watch it once. I let her <br/>
watch it a few times for about 30 minutes (Ruggrats) and told her to <br/>
turn it off afterward. No problem. She&#39;s been busy rollerblading, <br/>
reading (mostly reading), writing, sewing, playing, etc. Sometimes <br/>
my kids must be forced to be &quot;bored&quot; before they&#39;ll take the<br/>
intiative <br/>
to find other things to do. <br/>
<br/>
And, although she has always liked to read, my daughter has been <br/>
walking around here shouting,  &quot;I LOVE to read&quot; and has been<br/>
devouring <br/>
books with wild abandon since the TV has been off limits.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I like watching TV. I&#39;m a nut for CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.  <br/>
I even let my kids watch Ruggrats and other nonsense programming, but <br/>
they are not allowed to watch it to the exclusion of other<br/>
activities! <br/>
I&#39;m sure my daughter will get back to more regular TV viewing in a <br/>
month or so, but this is a nice break from it. <br/>
<br/>
Marianne --- turn off the TV!<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, when asked, my daughter would STILL say TV is her <br/>
favorite thing!)<br/>

When dd was much younger she could happily occupy herself.  I suppose <br/>
she has found it hard to occupy herself since she was 5-6yrs old when <br/>
she started ps.  Even when she is with her friend, they still <br/>
compalin there is nothing to do - though the TV never goes on when <br/>
the 2 are together.<br/>
On the odd occasion when dd (or dd and friend)do get engrossed in <br/>
something - she really does get engrosed.....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to you all for your advice.  I will have to be strong and have <br/>
a TV FREE DAY and see what happens -<br/>

<br/>
I agree with the others who said, No TV. *But* remember...it&#39;s all in the<br/>
presentation. If I just don&#39;t turn the TV on, or when they&#39;re done watching<br/>
a show and walk away, turn it off...no problem. If I turn it off mid-show<br/>
and say &quot;No more TV!&quot; it&#39;s not going to go over very well.<br/>
<br/>
I notice when I leave the stupid thing off (I&#39;m a news junkie, too) and<br/>
replace it with some music then no one asks to watch it. They run off and<br/>
play.<br/>
<br/>
Boredom can be a good thing. It can force you to think about things or try<br/>
something new. I&#39;ve come up with my best ideas when I was &quot;bored&quot;. If you&#39;re<br/>
too distracted with activities you don&#39;t have the time or space to really<br/>
ponder things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350979385">looks like you will need to establish some ground rules. Like every child<br/>
when a baby, discipline is a normal part of life...the parent is there to<br/>
instruct them. Tell your daughter that her television watching is going<br/>
to be limited from now on to a couple-three hours a day, one of which<br/>
will be educational television like on the discovery channel. Have you<br/>
taken her on field trips locally around the area where you live? Is she<br/>
involved in anything like 4h, girl scouts, etc? Maybe she could use some<br/>
physical activity like riding lessons, swimming, or other sports. Get the<br/>
timberdoodle catalog from www.timberdoodle.com. They have some really<br/>
interesting things in there like sign language or other languages as a<br/>
foreign language. Have her do at least one or two  math worksheets a<br/>
week. Sewing and baking come and go in spurts...just like for the rest of<br/>
us. Take her to the library and have her pick out videos or books that<br/>
she is interested in. Maybe have her volunteer to help with storytime at<br/>
the library? IF she is going through puberty, that could also be part of<br/>
it. She is not challenging herself and has forgotten how to really<br/>
challenge herself. Are either of you artistic? Have you any hobbies? Why<br/>
not take up a new one yourself and invite her to learn along with you? I<br/>
am a rubber stamper and my daughter started at age 4, same time I did.<br/>
I&#39;m also a cross stitcher and Naomi wants to learn that...she also has<br/>
her own pony beads to make critters as well as a latch hook rug to work<br/>
on at her own pace. We discovered paper weaving and will be doing that<br/>
next week. Maybe your daughter would be interested in learning some old<br/>
time crafts like weaving, soap making, candle making, etc. Why not ask<br/>
her?<br/>
<br/>
If you need any more ideas...I&#39;m willing to help.<br/>

So she&#39;s choosing to be bored, that&#39;s fine.  As long as it&#39;s not <br/>
stopping you from doing what you want/need to do, it is <br/>
educational and she&#39;ll learn from it.  She may still be coming round <br/>
from school stuff, it does take different people different lengths of <br/>
time, and there&#39;s the whole hormonal thing, too.  I&#39;m wondering, <br/>
also, if maybe she needs to change her sleeping patterns, perhaps <br/>
she&#39;s bored because she&#39;s awake earlier than her body-clock is <br/>
telling her she needs to be.  Does she go to bed when she&#39;s ready, <br/>
or with a set bed-time?  Is she still stuck in school-hours patterns? <br/>
 And does it make a difference to her activity levels when <br/>
school&#39;s out (on hols)?  I&#39;m just getting a vibe that it&#39;s a symptom <br/>
of something else, like me atm I have very little energy for <br/>
anything but watching the telly or sitting at the &#39;puter.  But that&#39;s <br/>
cos I&#39;m preggie, and it doesn&#39;t meant that I want to be sat <br/>
watching the telly!  (The number of silly disaster and plane-crash <br/>
films I&#39;ve watched recently!  Though I do like the one with Robert <br/>
Urich and Joan Cusack...)  <br/>
<br/>
I dunno, when I was a teen and was skiving from school, I&#39;d wake <br/>
up late, maybe watch telly, usually read books (even school text-<br/>
books, unschooling myself really) mooch around basically.  I think <br/>
it&#39;s almost a teenage condition (having very little to rebel against <br/>
might have something to do with it.)  Hang in there, and <br/>
remember it&#39;s not your responsibility to ensure her happiness all <br/>
the time.<br/>

We dont have set bedtime or wake up time.  dd goes to bed when she is <br/>
ready and gets up when she is ready.   She is getting up earlier <br/>
these days than she was when she first finished school.<br/>
<br/>
I believe she is still stuck in school hours and school hols - some <br/>
times it is hard to remove yourself from ps hours when your best <br/>
friend goes to ps!<br/>
<br/>
I actually did find she did more during the christmas school hols <br/>
than she does now.........<br/>
<br/>
I get on with my own thing.  I do however ask if there is anything <br/>
she would like me to do with her - but I dont dwell on it if she says <br/>
no - which she usually does....<br/>
<br/>
Sandra - our house rules are very few and NO they are not ridged - <br/>
only the safty ones......  We have rules like, letting me know where <br/>
she is going, what time I expect her in. No going through the bush on <br/>
her own.  These are there for safty reasons, not so I can check up on <br/>
her.<br/>
Eating at the table - getting a shower daily - no swearing, well <br/>
these ones are flexible!!!!<br/>

Hm.  I might try this - but not this week.<br/>
A ps friend from dd&#39;s school days (not her best friend)was bowled <br/>
over by a bus on thursday.  She is in intensive care with brain <br/>
injury.  The girl lives at the bottom of our street and the accident <br/>
happened just outside her home (childs fault - NO fault at all of the <br/>
bus driver)On the same day a friend of mine lost her husband, and a <br/>
week ago a 13yr old who used to live next door to us hung himself - 3 <br/>
yrs almost to the day that his sister did the same thing, at the same <br/>
age.......<br/>
<br/>
 life is so precsious and can taken away at a moments notice - and I <br/>
still have lots of things I want to do and places i want to <br/>
see........ and all these things happening at the same time have <br/>
really sent me into a dark cloud.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2036294612">well, all the help I can offer is that hopefully this<br/>
too shall pass. when I was 11 I was bored like that<br/>
all the time. Though somehow content to be bored. My<br/>
little sis (2 years younger) was always trying to get<br/>
me to play a board game or ride our bikes or something<br/>
that we had done before, but it just didn&#39;t interest<br/>
me at all. I just wanted to watch tv or listen to the<br/>
radio. I don&#39;t know why, but it did eventually pass.<br/>
The only distinction I can add about that particular<br/>
time and my seeming fatigue-ish-ness and boredom<br/>
(drove my mom crazy...she was always suggesting more<br/>
and more and more things for me to do....and good<br/>
suggestions they were, but I just didn&#39;t much have the<br/>
motivation to actually DO them) was that I got my<br/>
period around that time. Maybe that&#39;s what&#39;s up with<br/>
your dd? Just a thought. But I did get over that phase<br/>
and soon liked doing other things besides tv....but<br/>
then after that I was a teenager, and very into being<br/>
one, so the interests I had just weren&#39;t quite the<br/>
same. Instead of the art projects my mom used to<br/>
suggest I was more inclined to make collages with my<br/>
favorite entertainers and what not out of my teen fan<br/>
mags, etc. that&#39;s all I can offer. I&#39;m tired and<br/>
getting sick, so sorry if this was rather incoherent. <br/>
