<div id="ygrps-yiv-852425335">I know  it&#39;s not up to me, but if it were, you would be forgiven!  Apple<br/>
cores  are biodegradable.  It&#39;s better for their energy to be returned to  the<br/>
earth than to be put into a landfill.  As long as you didn&#39;t throw  it on a<br/>
sidewalk, or at someone (!) you&#39;re  O.K.!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
Although just as a point, mice and small animals feed on the remains of  food <br/>
and raptors feed on the small animals.  That is how they get hit  by cars.  <br/>
They swoop in low with their eye on the mouse and don&#39;t see the  oncoming cars. <br/>
 We visited a raptor recovery center and learned about those  injured animals <br/>
etc.  Now my boys are real conscious about throwing banana  peels, apple <br/>
cores etc out the car window.  <br/>

I never see dead raptors on the highway.  I see lots of skunks and  possums, <br/>
though.  A turkey vulture did fly up from the road, change  direction suddenly <br/>
and knock the mirror off my car.  (He wasn&#39;t killed,  just stunned and he <br/>
flew away to eat carrion another day.)<br/>
 <br/>
Skunks and possums don&#39;t go out in the road just because of banana peels  and <br/>
apple cores.  There just can&#39;t be that many banana peels and apple  cores.  <br/>
The skunks and possums wander out on the road because it gets quiet  out there <br/>
at night and they don&#39;t know it&#39;s a road.  They&#39;re trying to get  to someplace <br/>
else, or rooting around on the shoulder.  They&#39;re following  their nose.  <br/>
It&#39;s more likely their nose is leading them to something that  grows on the side <br/>
of the road, or something else naturally occurring.<br/>

Out in the country we see dead crows who came to eat things people threw out. <br/>
 Then coyotes will come to eat the crows.   Drivers can die from trying to <br/>
avoid hitting a coyote.<br/>
<br/>
I think the worst is when people throw out sandwiches, halves of hamburgers.  <br/>
 They have food all KINDS of animals want.<br/>

Yeah, when I lived 50 miles from Memphis in the middle of nowhere last  year, <br/>
we saw coyotes and deer a lot.  You don&#39;t want to hit a deer,  ever.  But it <br/>
was skunks and possums that were killed the most.  We  lived there for 18 <br/>
months and I worked nights.  It seemed like there was a  &quot;skunk season&quot;, the <br/>
cooler weather, but not cold, where there was *always* a  skunk killed on the <br/>
highway...more than one most nights.  The turkey  vultures did go out there to eat, <br/>
but I never saw a coyote doing so.  The  cotton fields and pastures are good <br/>
enough hunting grounds for coyotes, I  guess.  Or they eat small dogs, like <br/>
what happened to my little  Ladybug.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m surprised you see dead crows.  It&#39;s really hard to hit a  bird.  Those <br/>
turkey vultures are the most &quot;brave&quot; scavengers I&#39;ve seen, and  the only reason <br/>
I hit that one is that he changed direction in midflight and  flew right into <br/>
my car mirror.  <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe in the desert it&#39;s harder for animals to distinguish between a road  <br/>
and just dirt.  Where I lived, the road was two-lane with no shoulder, with  <br/>
fields or forest on either side.  The road was harder to wander onto, when  you <br/>
consider the natural habitat is the fields or forest or  underbrush.  I guess.  <br/>
:)<br/>
 <br/>
I just think that little animals wandering on to the highway is more a  <br/>
function of the animals&#39; behavior, and not necessarily what a human  throws out the <br/>
window.   <br/>

I just hate that.<br/>
I think one of my cats has gone the way of food for the coyotes. He&#39;s <br/>
been gone since Friday night.<br/>
I miss him...which is surprising with 5 other cats and 3 dogs.<br/>
I&#39;m not surprised though. We have a vacation jinx. Animals die when we <br/>
go on vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Little critters always seem to be going somewhere when I see them <br/>
crossing the road. I do see crows eating dead stuff. I see lots of dead <br/>
snakes in early spring.<br/>

So you assumed. He could have had some brain damage. This happened to a  hawk <br/>
at the NC Wild For Life Sanctuary. She was hit by a car and can still fly,  <br/>
but she flies in circles and can&#39;t adequately hunt anymore. She&#39;s now a  <br/>
permanent resident and educational bird for Wild For Life.<br/>
 <br/>
Others have had serious wing damage. Some die after suffering for a  while.<br/>
 <br/>
All the raptor centers ask that people refrain from throwing food from  cars. <br/>
It&#39;s the number one cause of injury & death in birds of prey around  here.<br/>
 <br/>
Marjorie may be forgiving. &lt;g&gt; But the raptors probably  aren&#39;t!<br/>

The turkey vulture was eating a skunk when it hit me.  The skunk had  been <br/>
squashed in the middle of the road.  I frankly don&#39;t care if the  turkey vulture <br/>
flew loop-de-loops or died.  It cost me hundreds of dollars  to fix my mirror.<br/>
 <br/>
If you don&#39;t want anyone to hit raptors, outlaw automobiles. <br/>

Thrown out of the car is the problem. Unless you have a *really* good arm!  <br/>

Small critters come out to eat it. The raptors see them, swoop down to  catch <br/>
the mouse or bunny (or whatever), and are hit by passing cars. Not  the car <br/>

  Thanks for this conversation.  I used to tell my daughter she could throw things out of the car that were things animals could eat, but not soda cans or plastic bags, etc.  Not trash.  I&#39;ll have to talk this over with her now.  Of course, in MT and TX, you&#39;ll get a big fine for throwing anything out the window.<br/>

You must have missed my post about how animals wander into the road just  <br/>
because they&#39;re animals, and not necessarily because there&#39;s some human-created  <br/>
waste on it.<br/>
 <br/>
The number of skunks and possums I used to see killed and/or snuffing  around <br/>
the roadside on our country two-lane just couldn&#39;t be out there  *simply* <br/>
because someone threw out an apple core.  Since I stated it seems  like there was <br/>
a &quot;skunk season&quot; when the days were warmer and nights were  cooler, it seems <br/>
to me that the skunks could have been attracted to the warmed  asphalt, as <br/>
opposed to the cool underbrush.  I&#39;ve thought a lot about it,  driving home at <br/>
night, avoiding skunks and possums and holding my breath along  that 10 mile <br/>
stretch of road.  :)<br/>

They have to cross the road, but if there&#39;s food they&#39;re more likely to stay.<br/>

Yeah, but rarely something that was thrown from a car window.  Maybe  people <br/>
don&#39;t throw food out as much around here?<br/>
 <br/>
My memories are mostly of birds in parks eating a bread crust that was left  <br/>
by a picnicker.  And possoums getting into trash cans and bags left  overnight.<br/>
