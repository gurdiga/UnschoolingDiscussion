There&#39;s not really any such thing as advanced math for high school seniors.  <br/>
By the time they&#39;re looking at real math, it&#39;s just plain real math.<br/>
<br/>
And with unschooling, so is ANY math real.<br/>
<br/>
But use www.google.com and look for the real topics you&#39;re interested in.  <br/>
Not &quot;senior high school science&quot; but physics, and more likely whatever <br/>
specific topic within physics you&#39;re considering.  <br/>

<br/>
HSC, the California-wide homeschooling group that I belong to has a<br/>
website with a lot of wonderful selected educational links.<br/>
<br/>
These should be pretty easy to find from the main page:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hsc.org">http://www.hsc.org</a><br/>
<br/>
I remember that one of the links is to the Exploratorium, a fabulous<br/>
science museum in San Francisco.  From there, there are many more great<br/>
science links.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably easier to find stuff on the web if you use Google to<br/>
search for specific terms, like &quot;Trigonometry&quot; or even more specific<br/>
terms like &quot;arctangent&quot;.<br/>
