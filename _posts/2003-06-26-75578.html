&gt; Much more fun.<br/>

&gt; I think we spent a total of two hours on this throughout the day and all <br/>
&gt; ages (4 to 38) had fun. We did lots of other stuff, too, but this was a <br/>
&gt; really good dampish day for bubbles.<br/>

them and you can chase them and lick/bite them and they taste good (well, <br/>
sort of...wouldn&#39;t want a LOT of it!)  I think we got it at KB Toys.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just found this site that has what they call  &quot;Stupid Candy you can play <br/>
with.&quot; &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stupid.com/playwith.htm&quot;">http://www.stupid.com/playwith.htm&quot;</a>&gt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.stupid.com/playwith.htm&lt;/A">http://www.stupid.com/playwith.htm&lt;/A</a>&gt;<br/>
A toilet shaped plastic package with an edible plunger? Simpsons Pez <br/>
dispensers? The rubber chicken pop? Nibble note, paper you can eat? Life doesn&#39;t gett <br/>
better than this...I think I need to order.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, who can just see people shaking their heads in disgust and thinking <br/>
&quot;Well, that&#39;s where the kid gets it! She takes a sweet bubble-biting post and <br/>
turns it into something about mutant candy. No wonder the kid eats sugar all <br/>
day!&quot;<br/>
