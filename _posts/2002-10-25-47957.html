&lt;&lt; If I get that sense that it would be spanking time in another household,<br/>
 then that is definitely time to show Jayn some love &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow...that is profound you know.<br/>
My Dad wrote me a letter when my firstborn was a toddler. He told me that <br/>
when I got mad at him, to just pick up &quot;that little guy and hug him&quot;.<br/>
It took me a while longer to get it, but those words still ring in my head.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;If she had felt the way I do, she<br/>
couldn&#39;t have done it. A thousand generations of abuse and fury. Well it<br/>
stops here: the chain is broken. I am the bulwark against the teeming<br/>
rages of my family history. There is nothing that Jayn could ever do<br/>
that would cause me to spank her, or believe she deserved to be spanked.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This brought tears to my eyes.<br/>
I am hanging it up. Beautiful.<br/>
