<div id="ygrps-yiv-936074041">Listening to an interview of David McCullough &quot;1776&quot; on the Diane Rehm show, I caught a bit of his telling that he uses a typewriter to write his books.  He said that he &quot;doesn&#39;t know how&quot; to type, so does it slowly, but his typing speed is compatible with his thinking while he is writing.  He also said that he fears if he used a computer that he would push the wrong button and delete stuff by accident.<br/>
<br/>
This ties into the idea that there are certain things people &quot;have to learn&quot; in order to be successful.  McCullough is a very successful author without mastering the computer or learning &quot;correct&quot; keyboarding.<br/>

Paul McCartney couldn&#39;t read music until he learned when he was 40 or so.   <br/>
He did okay.<br/>

Oh, I just remembered.  I was at a grocery store during the most recent Superbowl.  There was a TV playing near the cash register.  I knew it was after half time, and asked a young woman working there if she had enjoyed Paul McCartney in the half-time show.  She didn&#39;t know who he was!  (gasp!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-413644425">My dad had an ancient old black typewriter that I think he had in high  <br/>
school (he&#39;s 78)...I should call him and see if he still has it!!  He typed  letter <br/>
to us for years.  He finally got a computer and now sends  emails about 4 <br/>
times a week.  He&#39;s so cute, cause he makes the letter  really big, and with <br/>
color, and a colored background...he really gets  creative!!<br/>
