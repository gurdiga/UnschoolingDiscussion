<div id="ygrps-yiv-298470013">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I am way behind on conversations. I guess spending quality kid time can do <br/>
that. I read the lastest digest and go from there. I think I have 9 other <br/>
digests left unread. Delete and get on with this life.<br/>
<br/>
Hum, how to put this idea. My oldest, 7, is involved in musical theater. She <br/>
loves her teacher, she loves to sing and dance. She rarely remembers to <br/>
practice her songs. I love her practice tapes, especially this lastest show, <br/>
old monster songs mixed with a few Shrek tunes. I truly enjoy putting her <br/>
tape on and singing around the house as I prep lunch. Every day I notice I <br/>
do this. Ashley then generally finds her script, sings, rewinds sings, tells <br/>
her brother how to dance, sings. we do this for about 1 hour almost <br/>
everyday. She does not have to participate. I decided to listen. Sometimes <br/>
she will tell me she doesn&#39;t feel like listening to this tape. Maybe she is <br/>
reading or we are doing something that would be interrupted by music. She is <br/>
practicing a ton and I never tell her, go practice your songs, we pay good <br/>
money for your class and you need to learn these things. Her practice comes <br/>
naturally. I encourage it by putting the tape on. I like when learning can <br/>
flow so easily and enjoyably.<br/>
<br/>
My question for the week: How do you encourage kids to try until they <br/>
succeed when they become easily frustrated. My 7 and 5 year old sometimes <br/>
dig their heels in and wail I can&#39;t do it? Sometimes it is as simple as <br/>
getting their own plate from the cupboard, or putting on pj&#39;s, other times <br/>
it is a real new challenge. They scream and often will not try again for a <br/>
while. I often set up a craft or start a craft then it ends in one or the <br/>
other having a sobbing tantrum and wrecked spirits. Not a fun interaction. I <br/>
want a more positive outcome when the I can&#39;tisms start up.<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; How do you encourage kids to try until they <br/>
succeed when they become easily frustrated. My 7 and 5 year old sometimes <br/>

<br/>
It might not mean &quot;can&#39;t,&quot; but might just mean &quot;Don&#39;t want to.&quot;  Why press <br/>
kids that young?  Put their pajamas on them and get them a plate.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s the same principle as younger kids needing to nurse or be held <br/>
or be with mom.  The more you push them away, the more they *need* it.  Once <br/>
they&#39;ve had all they need (which is different for each child) they walk away <br/>
happily on their own.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; They scream and often will not try again for a <br/>
while. I often set up a craft or start a craft then it ends in one or the <br/>
other having a sobbing tantrum and wrecked spirits.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like they don&#39;t like crafts.  How about just letting them play with <br/>
the materials however they want to, including not at all, if that&#39;s their <br/>
preference?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>T. Berry Brazelton has a good book called &quot;The Irreducible Needs of <br/>
Children&quot;.  In it he writes that parents need to enable children to <br/>
pursue meaningful inner-directed goals.  They need to feel a sense of <br/>
pleasure in mastery in the areas of life that are important or will <br/>
be important to them.  He goes on to say this sense of mastery does <br/>
not wait until a person is a professional athlete or a Nobel Prize-<br/>
winning scientist; it starts with the small steps involved in the <br/>
learning process itself.<br/>
<br/>
When you are naturally gifted at something, starting at a higher <br/>
level will often feel natural, satisfying, and rewarding.  When you <br/>
are not gifted at something, when you start something new, you have <br/>
to start out with very small steps or else there will be frustration. <br/>
If parents respect the needs of children to develop skills in their <br/>
own way, at their own pace, they build a sense of mastery and <br/>
pleasure rather than of frustration.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly, your daughter expects to be as good at crafts as she is at <br/>
her performing.  Either that or she feels some expectations from you <br/>
that she doesn&#39;t have for herself.<br/>
<br/>
T. Berry Brazelton&#39;s book is very good and very unschool like.  The <br/>
only problem is he doesn&#39;t believe in homeschooling.  So if you pick <br/>
the book up at the library, skip that part.  The rest is very very <br/>
good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750445827">My son is very easily frustrated.  He&#39;s a perfectionist.  When he suddenly<br/>
&#39;can&#39;t&#39; dress himself or even pick up his own socks (!) I take that as a<br/>
sign he needs me to back off in my expectations for awhile.  If I do that<br/>
instead of pushing he will leap forward in skills when I&#39;m not looking for<br/>
it.  If your kids don&#39;t like crafts (mine detests them) try and view<br/>
something they like to do as creative work.  Building a mess out of<br/>
pinecones in the backyard is really just as creative as making a cute animal<br/>
out of play clay when you think about it.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kinderart.com">http://www.kinderart.com</a> has a<br/>
ton of age or skill appropriate suggestions.<br/>
I hope I&#39;m not being too forward posting too much.  I&#39;m not only new, but my<br/>
kids are very young!  I always have $.02 to toss in though if that&#39;s ok :)<br/>

This isn&#39;t exactly what you were asking for but it came to mind... it <br/>
won&#39;t solve everything, every time however, I found it helpful when <br/>
my kids were smaller to place things in the house so they were easier <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359300965">but if I did that, Janene wouldn&#39;t miss<br/>
hauling her stool over to the cabinet,<br/>
climbing on the counter, getting her own<br/>
bowl, pooring her own cereal, getting enough<br/>
on the floor for the dogs to share, and all<br/>
over the table, etc. The only thing she can&#39;t<br/>
do is milk but her sister can.  She feels<br/>
very empowered by getting her own things from<br/>
upper cabinets, she loves to get me a glass<br/>
of ice water.  But I agree, having snacks and<br/>
things where they can reach them is good for<br/>
the kids.  Lexie was amazed when she heard<br/>
from one of her friends that the friend is<br/>
not allowed to eat anything or get a snack or<br/>
anything in the kitchen without permission<br/>
from mom, because &quot;a kitchen is in a<br/>
dangerous place.&quot;  You should have seen the<br/>
look on this child&#39;s face when Lexie told her<br/>
that not only does she get to eat anything<br/>
that she wants in the kitche but that she<br/>
(lexie) made french toast by herself for<br/>
herself and her sister yesterday.<br/>
