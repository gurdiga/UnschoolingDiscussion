<div id="ygrps-yiv-1914726138">Dear Susan, Tammy, Teresa and anyone else who wants info on CF,<br/>
         The info that i want to share with you comes from a book called <br/>
&quot;Human Condition: Critical.&quot;  It is written by a man named Dr. Luc <br/>
deSchepper.  He is an MD Ph.d,  acupuncturist and classical homeopath.  I had <br/>
the great privilege of having this man as my Dr. for a few years and I can <br/>
say he is a genius at what he does. He has written many books and teaches  <br/>
homeopathy at a medical college to traditional dr.s. In case you are <br/>
unfamiliar - homeopathy is a 200 year old medicine based on the belief that <br/>
like cures like.  If, for example, you are stung by a bee, then the venom <br/>
from a bee taken in an infinitesimal amount [called a &#39;&quot;remedy&quot;] will boost <br/>
the body&#39;s own immune system into healing itself.  I can personally attest to <br/>
the miracle of homeopathy as I have been using it for 10 years.  <br/>
     Anyway, I was rereading Dr. Luc&#39;s book the other day when I noticed all <br/>
the info on CF and other auto-immune diseases.  I knew that I had recently <br/>
&quot;met&quot; someone on the internet with CF and I really want to help.  I will <br/>
Quote some of the info to you here and if it sounds like something you would <br/>
like to know more about, I would say try to get the book.  I got it in my hf <br/>
store but I am sure B&N has it. Also the book explains the whole concept of <br/>
homeopathy which would also help.<br/>
      One of the basic philosophies of homeopathy is that the physical <br/>
symptoms often begin with some emotional trauma.  Many people will say &quot;I <br/>
have never been quite right since.&quot;------ .. In homeopathy, that incident <br/>
which preceded the beginning of an illness is very important.  I have a <br/>
friend who came down with  Lyme&#39;s disease and eventually MS - all after her <br/>
divorce.  I know  a woman who was diagnosed with breast cancer 6 months after <br/>
moving away from friends and family in Iowa to NJ.  Not everyone who <br/>
experiences emotional trauma will develop serious illness - but many people <br/>
are sensitive to begin with and these people may become ill.  When the body <br/>
is having difficulty handling grief or anger or loss, etc., they lose their <br/>
vital energy thus allowing illness in.<br/>
        Here is a quote from the book, &quot; We need to look at the patient when <br/>
he was in his beginning stage of the disease, and try to get an idea about <br/>
his simple change of  state before his health was compromised. How can we <br/>
expect to treat the disease in an intelligent way if we do not know what the <br/>
beginnings are?... In Chapter 4 I outlined many emotional factors leading to <br/>
a state of chronic exhaustion. [ hearing bad news,broken heart, nursing loved <br/>
ones, guilt feelings, business failure, lost ambition & disappointment, <br/>
loneliness, jealousy, home-sickness,etc.]   &quot;All of them are possible <br/>
causative factors of CFIDS and need to be repaired with homeopathic remedies <br/>
if we want to be successful in fighting this disease.  ...Don&#39;t forget, we <br/>
view this diseased state as a decrease in vital energy.  Once this energy has <br/>
reached a certain low level, the patient is susceptible to viruses, bacteria, <br/>
yeast and parasites, which are consequences Not causes.&quot; <br/>
           There are a few more pages on CFIDS and other illnessess after <br/>
this that you can read.  Also, dr. Luc says that he covers CFIDS in his other <br/>
book, &quot;Full of Life&quot;  which I do not have.  The main difference between <br/>
homeopathy and western medicine is that the homeopathic physician is more <br/>
interested in the symptoms of Each individual patient; not their diagnosis.  <br/>
2 people with CFIDS will probably not get the same remedy. <br/>
      I hope this helps somebody: I really feel I was led to read this book <br/>
to help someone.  It is a book that I own and I have already read, yet I was <br/>
compelled to pick it up again just a few days ago.  If anyone needs more info <br/>
I would be glad to help if I can.  I personally KNOW the power and miracle of <br/>
homeopathy and would be happy to help someone else make the same discovery!   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925875787">I got to hear<br/>
Dr. Luc<br/>
de Schepper speak, and I have a friend who studies in his school and have<br/>
read his book too. He says that homeopathy is truly effective for ADD kids<br/>
by looking at them as unique individuals and identifying physical, mental,<br/>
and especially emotional symptoms and then precribing a remedy.  I wanted to<br/>
mention that<br/>
Chronic fatigue and other illness can be caused with wheat allergy. Celiac<br/>
sprue (spelling?) disease means that those who suffer have to really cut out<br/>
all wheat and lots of other things like spices that have additives, and even<br/>
licking stamps-in order to get better.  It is often missed by medical people<br/>
as a possibility, and can be tested for.<br/>
Forgive me if it has been mentioned as I haven&#39;t been following the<br/>
discussion closely.<br/>
