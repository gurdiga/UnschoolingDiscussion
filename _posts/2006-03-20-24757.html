<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134903627"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;If, due to financial or medical necessity, you became less available to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>your unschooled children, what would you do?&lt;&lt;<br/>
I posted this message about unschooling through crisis after crisis, almost a <br/>
week ago.  This is the first chance I&#39;ve had more than five minutes to sit <br/>
back at the computer to read and respond.  I&#39;ve been working long hours and <br/>
going for medical tests and counseling, looking for an affordable place to rent <br/>
that also allows pets, and trying to sell our belongings to come up with enough <br/>
money to do so.  The life of a single mom.  Against my advice, my son went to <br/>
stay with his disabled dad for a few weeks.  I worry about his safety there.  <br/>
My daughter has been home alone, packing boxes, marking the want ads and <br/>
searching online for rentals.  With the time approaching, we have still found <br/>
nothing.  Perhaps REALLY Carschooling?<br/>
<br/>
When analyzing our situation, I do not leave my kids out of the process to <br/>
finding our next step.  Neither of them really wants to attend a school.  At <br/>
least not any of the schools we have visited. In our search for a new place to <br/>
live, we are taking schools, especially Sudbury types, into consideration. They <br/>
have come up with very divergent, and not very immediate, solutions.  My son <br/>
wants to get the best computer imaginable so that he can practice the most <br/>
complicated games, enter tournaments, and learn how to design and maintain games <br/>
and websites.  Then he will  support us with his brilliance:-)  That is pretty <br/>
much his answer to everything.  We just have to get a really good computer.  <br/>
My daughter wants to move to a cabin in the forest where she can live as a <br/>
recluse, and rescue animals. Of course, it must have cable or satellite TV, so she <br/>
can watch her favorite anime shows, of which she does beautiful drawings. She <br/>
wants to be a veterinarian and film maker, if anything.  I just want to age <br/>
gracefully/heathfully while helping their dreams come true.<br/>
  <br/>
I realize that my problems are all ordinary occurrences for many people, and <br/>
that my kids are naturally learning some of life&#39;s harsh realities.  We are <br/>
living out the consequences of the plans and choices we made or didn&#39;t make, and <br/>
of the responses we took to these various situations (earthquake, fire, <br/>
burglary, two auto accidents, terminal illnesses, death, bankruptcy, divorce).  I <br/>
assumed that each crisis would be over soon.  Instead, one crisis has followed <br/>
another, the years have flown by, and now, due to diminishing health, time, <br/>
energy and finances, we have become increasingly isolated.  At last, I am <br/>
willing to admit that I am less available to my children than I ever intended to be. <br/>
I would like to guide my children safely, but my confidence is shaken.  I <br/>
believe that love, listening, and sharing will cushion our journey. None of these <br/>
challenges really have anything to do with unschooling I guess, but as an <br/>
unschooling parent, I just feel as though I might be missing some key element, or <br/>
source of support, that other veterans of the attachment parenting, <br/>
unschooling lifestyle are aware of.<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>
