<br/>
&lt;&lt;How do you stay strong in your beliefs and committment to unschooling  in <br/>
the face of disapproval?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see what schools can do. My oldest has always gone to school and although <br/>
a &quot;good, private one&quot; it was awful in her early years. Her being in the <br/>
system actually was one very main reason for my husband and I to homeschool. <br/>
Plus I see what unschooling does and how my children are. That&#39;s definitely <br/>
proof enough for me to overcome all the disapproval I can get. And I have <br/>
gotten it from family. Not mine but my in laws. My mom is an ex school <br/>
teacher and she is very supportive. She&#39;s quick to tell all her friends <br/>
about what we do and I must admit, I get more support from them than the <br/>
younger people. My mom is 77 and all her friends are that age and older. <br/>
They are extremely supportive. Maybe they all remember the days of the one <br/>
room schoolhouse and that makes a big difference from how schools are now. <br/>
My in laws have stopped commenting. Mostly because I just stay away from <br/>
them now but my MIL keeps her mouth shut. It was a losing battle. I&#39;m fierce <br/>
when I really believe in something! Stick to your guns. Have a rehearsed <br/>
speech about unschooling if that makes you more comfortable. Be aware of all <br/>
the negatives you may get and be ready to answer them if that&#39;s important to <br/>
you. You could just walk away. Those around you hopefully will stop <br/>
eventually. But proof is in the pudding.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do you fear that your child will someday resent your descision not to put <br/>
them in school like &quot;normal&quot; kids? What do you do with that?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well hopefully my kids won&#39;t do that. All I can go by is the unschoolers I <br/>
know that are grown. They still love the idea that they were given such an <br/>
opportunity. I really don&#39;t see it ending up a negative thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I feel worried by this notion that even though I see that unschooling will <br/>
be vastly superior to public schooling, is it really ok to make such a big <br/>
decision for someone else?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At such a young age when the schools want our children, yes I think it is <br/>
okay to make such a decision. Five is way too young for a child to be sent <br/>
off with total strangers who I know nothing about to be cared for all day. <br/>
They don&#39;t have the skills yet to deal with it all and it can be <br/>
overwhelming and harmful. When they are older and more aware of what school <br/>
is, then it can be different. I&#39;m still on the fence about this one. I <br/>
thought at one time I would never say okay to my kids going to school when <br/>
they got older. Now I&#39;m not so sure that I could deny them that if that&#39;s <br/>
what they really wanted. I sure would hope if that happened, they would come <br/>
running back home. It hasn&#39;t come up though and my two middle children say <br/>
they will never ever go to school! So far so good!<br/>
