<div id="ygrps-yiv-395836398">This post didn&#39;t quote any previous post relating to the above subject <br/>
because it is my intentions to talk about the differences that _I_ see <br/>
between the unschooling and Monetssori. Let me also add that there are <br/>
many types of schooling that cross some lines... but they are all very <br/>
unique in their own right (unschooling, Waldorf, Montessori, Sudbury etc)<br/>
<br/>
A few months back I did get into this subject on another unschooling list <br/>
and I might was well repost my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
MARIE MONTESSORI&#39;S WORK:<br/>
<br/>
I wholeheartedly agree that she was ahead of her time and her theorys are <br/>
a genteel way to treat children, I see her quotes about learning by <br/>
certain ages and presenting learning opportunities (as opposed to the <br/>
child asking) to be contradictory almost to herself.<br/>
<br/>
Its POSSIBLE that the year she resided in was a major factor in some of <br/>
her writings, hence the contradicitons.<br/>
<br/>
My greatgrandmother and ggf lived in Italy at that time, and luckily for <br/>
my family, they were way ahead of their time in regards to cultural <br/>
advances.<br/>
<br/>
Maria also had a great insight of the spiritual and how children are <br/>
connected. Yet, I suppose this would fall prey to many religions and <br/>
belief systems.<br/>
<br/>
Its very sad to see that her theorys (without the age parts I will list <br/>
below), are not followed by the Montessori of today. Sadder yet is some <br/>
of the writings of Mario Montessori, Jr (I don&#39;t know the relation) that <br/>
seem to contradict Maria. Such as:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teachers must uphold the rules of the school community for the benefit <br/>
of the group as well as that of individual children. Accordingly the only <br/>
punishment in Montessori education is isolation from the group for a <br/>
temporary period&quot; (page 26, Mario Montessori, Jr., Education for Human <br/>
Development: Understanding Montessori). <br/>
<br/>
This says that making a &#39;time-out&#39; is more necessary to solving the issue <br/>
either by mediation or via a democratic process.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the age discriminations that I have found in the writing:<br/>
<br/>
Montessori drew on the studies of the &quot;Wild Boy of Aveyron&quot; who was found <br/>
in a forest in the 1800s. He had been without human interaction for about <br/>
ten years. Eighteenth century physician Jean Itard studied the child at <br/>
length, considering him raw material and prime for studies about the <br/>
relative importance of nature vs. nurture. When the boy failed to learn <br/>
to speak and do other basic functions, Itard speculated that there are <br/>
learning periods in human development when growth potential is prime. He <br/>
believed that the Wild Boy had missed the prime window for learning <br/>
speech. He believed that it was essential to observe the educational <br/>
process carefully to determine the best times to present learning <br/>
opportunities. <br/>
*Montessori agreed and this concept became the backbone of her methods.*<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If during conception, gestation, birth and the subsequent period the <br/>
child <br/>
has had scientific care, then at the age of 3 the child should be a model <br/>
ind<br/>
ividual; but this seldom happens, for the child has usually met with many <br/>
accidents. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;No one can be free unless he is independent....a weaned child...is still <br/>
dependent, since he is not yet able to walk, and cannot wash and dress <br/>
himself, and since he is not able to ask for things in a language which <br/>
is <br/>
clear and easily understood. He is still in this period to a great extent <br/>
the <br/>
slave of everyone&quot; [I&#39;ll interject here about the weaning child not being <br/>
able to walk. It imposes an age limit on nursing, not a child&#39;s decision <br/>
on when to quit]<br/>
<br/>
Enquiries into the home life follow...This questionnaire is necessary <br/>
because <br/>
almost all children come to us with strange characteristics and <br/>
naughtiness, <br/>
and these must be traced and understood in order to be cured&quot; (page 74, <br/>
Education for a New World).  [I&#39;ll concede that the  &#39;naughtiness&#39; part <br/>
could be translation difficulties, but again it shows that it needs to be <br/>
cured]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...there is an unusual demand on the part of the child to know the <br/>
reasons <br/>
of things. Knowledge can be best given where there is eagerness to learn, <br/>
so <br/>
this is the period (age 6 to 12) when the seed of everything can be sown, <br/>
the <br/>
child&#39;s mind being like a fertile field, ready to receive what will <br/>
germinate <br/>
into culture&quot; (page 4, To Educate the Human Potential).<br/>
<br/>
The history of civilization is a history of successful attempts to <br/>
organize <br/>
work and to obtain liberty. On the whole, man&#39;s goodness has also <br/>
increased, <br/>
as is shown by his progress from barbarism to civilization, and it may be <br/>
said that crime, the various forms of wickedness, cruelty and violence <br/>
have <br/>
been gradually decreasing during this passage of time.  [This is <br/>
interesting, she seems to think that cruelty and violence have decreased. <br/>
Whilst I feel it just changed form from barbaric times.]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Here lies the attraction that will polarise the will of the child. The <br/>
teacher, as part of the environment, must herself be attractive, <br/>
preferably young and beautiful, charmingly dressed, scented with <br/>
cleanliness, happy and graciously dignified. She should study her<br/>
movements, making them as gentle and graceful as possible, that the child <br/>
may unconsciously pay her the compliment of thinking her as beautiful as <br/>
his mother&quot; (page 87, Education for a New World). [Okay, it could be a <br/>
cultural thing, but I don&#39;t feel an attractive mom is going to yield <br/>
better results than one who is not beautiful in the acceptable range that <br/>
our culture calls beauty]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is essential that civilisation should produce beautiful children. An <br/>
old fashioned dictum has been that &#39;beauty is but skin-deep&#39;, and <br/>
children have been dissuaded from looking in the mirror, as smacking of <br/>
sinful vanity. But we claim that schools should be institutions to help <br/>
beauty, because beauty is an indication of healthy conditions of life. <br/>
Good conditions induce beauty of form, and it is part of the Montessori <br/>
Method to achieve such harmony&quot; (page 114-115, To Educate the Human <br/>
Potential). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The following is from a biography on her. It makes reference to her <br/>
achivements of children learning to read and math by the age of four. I <br/>
wonder what she would say if I told her the 12 year old can&#39;t read. Would <br/>
the &#39;window of learning&#39; be closed in her mind?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot; In <br/>
two years time some of her &quot;deficient&quot; students were able to pass <br/>
standard <br/>
tests for Italian School Children. She was lauded for this achievement <br/>
but <br/>
replied that public schools should be able to get far better results, <br/>
then, <br/>
with her methods, than with their traditional ones. The government didn&#39;t <br/>
allow her that chance, so she started to work with poor day care children <br/>
too <br/>
young to attend school. These children were examples of the worst poverty <br/>
can <br/>
bring out of people, and at first Montessori doubted her methods could <br/>
work <br/>
under these conditions. However, she gave them a try and her successes <br/>
were <br/>
even greater than with the retarded children. These children did not need <br/>
to <br/>
be prodded to participate as the hospitalized children did. They were <br/>
eager <br/>
to learn and begged for more. They were fascinated by numbers and were <br/>
adding <br/>
four and five digit numbers at the ages of four and five. Their <br/>
enthusiasm <br/>
was so great that Montessori spent many nights awake into the wee hours <br/>
making new learning tools for them. Her style of mathematics blocks and <br/>
tiles <br/>
are still in use today. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I keep seeing &#39;Make learning fun, and they&#39;ll learn what they need to&#39; in <br/>
the above.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Please let me reiterate that I feel she was great in her own right. I <br/>
just don&#39;t see the principles that closely knit to unschooling. I see <br/>
similarities. Just as I see them amonst all types of education. But each <br/>
type is in of itself its own method.<br/>
<br/>

My daughter Amy is 20 years old now and 16 years ago she<br/>
was locked in a closet everyday, because she didn&#39;t want to<br/>
do what the director in the Montessori class wanted her to<br/>
do. That experience has colored her whole life making her<br/>
feel &quot;worthless, dumb/stupid and that nobody likes her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Amy is our first child, she had been in Montessori for 2<br/>
years, when at the age of four she started crying everyday<br/>
when we took her to school. According to Dr. Spock, this<br/>
was separation anxiety and she would get over it. <br/>
<br/>
At this same time our family was in the process of moving<br/>
from Oak Park, IL to Helena, MT, so she did stop crying<br/>
only because we moved.<br/>
<br/>
There weren&#39;t any Montessori Schools out here, so we chose<br/>
to homeschool.  <br/>
<br/>
Amy&#39;s mind would close like a steel trap anytime I tryed to<br/>
teach her anything. Yes, I was doing &quot;school at home&quot;, this<br/>
didn&#39;t last long and we became unschooler&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
When Amy was eleven years old she told me why she cried all<br/>
those years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
To this day, she has to stick her hand in the fire more<br/>
than once to learn her lessons in life. She can&#39;t seem to<br/>
get past being that 4 year old.  <br/>
<br/>
We see our daughter as the possibility of being a dynamic,<br/>
powerful woman. I pray that one day she will be that<br/>
possibility.  <br/>

page 123,  has a complete oppisite reading  on that<br/>
issue about discipline. She describes her experience<br/>
with reward and punishments and her ending conclusion<br/>
was to give the up.  I have not read mario&#39;s book. I<br/>
really don&#39;t know what the purpose of that statement<br/>
was for, he had a different view on his mothers<br/>
conclusions maybe, but he is not maria montessori.<br/>
When I wrote that it sounded similar I meant in their<br/>
goal for peace in learning.  I have had my child in<br/>
montessori school and NEVER had my child disciplined<br/>
the way amy was.  I don&#39;t know why anyone would even<br/>
treat a child that way.  Before I decided to<br/>
homeschool my son went to public school for 4 days in<br/>
kindergarten and his teacher was awful.  He still<br/>
talks about her and its 2 years later.  I put him in<br/>
montessori for a month to show him that not all adults<br/>
were like his K teachers. He had a wonderful time.  I<br/>
just couldn&#39;t afford it.  They told me how free<br/>
spirited he was and creative for the meantime the<br/>
thepublic teacher told me how nasty because he was<br/>
always telling stories. Of course I think unschooling<br/>
is better, but for the ones that can&#39;t come home I<br/>
think there needs to be an alternative education.<br/>

&gt; everyday<br/>
&gt; when we took her to school. According to Dr. Spock,<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; was separation anxiety and she would get over it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this same time our family was in the process of<br/>
&gt; moving<br/>
&gt; from Oak Park, IL to Helena, MT, so she did stop<br/>
&gt; crying<br/>
&gt; only because we moved.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There weren&#39;t any Montessori Schools out here, so we<br/>
&gt; chose<br/>
&gt; to homeschool.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Amy&#39;s mind would close like a steel trap anytime I<br/>
&gt; tryed to<br/>
&gt; teach her anything. Yes, I was doing &quot;school at<br/>
&gt; home&quot;, this<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t last long and we became unschooler&#39;s. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When Amy was eleven years old she told me why she<br/>
&gt; cried all<br/>
&gt; those years ago.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To this day, she has to stick her hand in the fire<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; than once to learn her lessons in life. She can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to<br/>
&gt; get past being that 4 year old.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We see our daughter as the possibility of being a<br/>
&gt; dynamic,<br/>
&gt; powerful woman. I pray that one day she will be that<br/>
&gt; possibility.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
