come from. When we were driving home from Colorado last month, we listened <br/>
to the children&#39;s book &quot;A Bridge to Terabithia&quot;. I had warned my kids that <br/>
the jacket said the book had some sad things in it. Conor still wasn&#39;t <br/>
prepared for what he heard. A main character dies suddenly and it affected <br/>
Conor deeply. He sobbed in the car for a long time. Then he got mad at the <br/>
library for putting such a book in the children&#39;s section.<br/>

was about twelve when I saw that and it was the worst movie I&#39;ve ever <br/>
seen and I will never watch it again.  I don&#39;t like sad endings.<br/>

years ago.  She found it too scary and insisted they shouldn&#39;t have it in <br/>
the children&#39;s section.  I told her that the children&#39;s section was also <br/>
for older children, who wouldn&#39;t find it as scary.  I&#39;ve always thought of <br/>
Bridge to Terabithia as a young adult book.  *I* cried when I read it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358271735">For a very funny book on that subject, try &quot;No More Dead Dogs&quot;  by Gordon Korman.  It is about a boy in Junior High who has to write a book report on one of the sad-dog-dies books, and refuses to say he enjoyed it.  Gave my hsed children a new perspective on public school!   Debi<br/>
  He then would not watch any *dog* movies &#39;cause he figured they were sad. <br/>
