&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve got a question about Alan Rickman movies.  I may be mistaken, but <br/>
did someone in this group say that he was in a Robin Hood movie?  I looked at <br/>
my library for such a video to no avail.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He plays the sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, a pretty <br/>
horrible movie for which we can blame Kevin Costner.  It suggests that Robin <br/>
Hood&#39;s band of men &quot;hid&quot; in the forest by building some sort of Ewok Village <br/>
up in the trees.  Kind of hard to move your camping spot when you&#39;ve built in <br/>
that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Friends of mine who don&#39;t like it call it &quot;Dances with Saxons,&quot; but I prefer <br/>
&quot;Robin Hood in the Ewok Village.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I hate it, but here&#39;s another review (from Amazon) from someone who liked <br/>
it:<br/>

Kevin Costner&#39;s lousy English accent is a small obstacle in this often <br/>
exciting version of the Robin Hood fable. That aside, it&#39;s refreshing to have <br/>
a preface to the old story in which we meet the robber hero of Sherwood <br/>
Forest as a soldier in King Richard&#39;s Crusades, coming home to find his <br/>
people under siege from the cruelties of the Sheriff of Nottingham (Alan <br/>
Rickman). After Robin and his community of outcasts and fighters take to the <br/>
trees, director Kevin Reynolds (Fandango, 187) is on more familiar narrative <br/>
ground, and he goes for the gusto with lots of original action (Robin shoots <br/>
two arrows simultaneously from his bow in two directions). Mary Elizabeth <br/>
Mastrantonio, as Marion, makes a convincing damsel in distress, and Morgan <br/>
Freeman brings dignity to his role as Robin&#39;s Moor friend. Alan Rickman, <br/>
however, gets the most attention for his scene-chewing role as the rotten <br/>
sheriff, an almost campy performance that is highly entertaining but perhaps <br/>
a little out of sorts with the rest of the film. The DVD release includes <br/>
production notes, theatrical trailers, optional French and Spanish <br/>
soundtracks, optional English, French, and Spanish subtitles, widescreen <br/>
presentation, and Dolby sound. --Tom Keogh</div>
