&lt;&lt; A woman I worked with told me that teens give their parents a hard time, <br/>

<br/>
I think there&#39;s truth in it, though.<br/>
<br/>
The whole cultural overlay of obedience and school requirements and SAT tests <br/>
and kids&#39; inability to get jobs until they&#39;re 16 or older, and college, all <br/>
complicate what might happen naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
When people reach adulthood they DO naturally want to be out on their own.  <br/>
It happens earlier with some people than others, and never with an occasional <br/>
few.   But I think there does come a time when your teenaged boy becomes kind <br/>
of irritating and doesn&#39;t smell as sweet as he did (to his mom, I mean) when <br/>
he was younger, and even the mom starts to envision him happily living <br/>
elsewhere, and where her sewing machine might go in his room.<br/>
