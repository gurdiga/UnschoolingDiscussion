&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  I am always amazed with myself how easily I can accept, <br/>
respect and give my children what i cannot easily accept, respect and <br/>
give to myself or other adults (specifically dh).   &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
I would have to say that this issue was a real roadblock, actually <br/>
probably the biggest roadblock, for my family in the switch to <br/>
mindful parenting. I was so busy accepting, respecting, and giving to <br/>
my children that dh kinda got left out in the cold.  It was not good. <br/>
<br/>
Part of it was that I was feeling guilty for all the control we had <br/>
used when they were little.  We spanked.  We punished. We coerced.  <br/>
We imposed consequences. We gave false choices. Pretty traditional.<br/>
<br/>
Then - BAM - I see the light!<br/>
<br/>
OK - it wasn&#39;t exactly BAM.  It took a few years. . . . . <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was very impatient with dh because although we no longer <br/>
spanked or even punished, he just hadn&#39;t seen the light (yet). <br/>
<br/>
It is a big thing for anyone to wrap their head around and our <br/>
children were already big - one already gone, one almost 17 at home <br/>
with whom we were have &quot;traditional troubles&quot; and one 10yo. <br/>
The troubles we were having from dh&#39;s perspective just weren&#39;t<br/>
that big.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I am trying to say is to be very gentle with those great <br/>
husbands who go to work everyday, provide the opportunity to be home <br/>
with the children, are trying their best to be a great dad but just <br/>
don&#39;t get it (yet).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;  Sometimes it takes a conscious effort to recognize the <br/>
hypocrisy of my actions and then adjust accordingly. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was so angry that &quot;no one&quot; had told me about birthing with<br/>
a midwife, extended breastfeeding, co-sleeping, mindful parenting. A <br/>
friend of mine (a LaLeche unschooling friend who is making the change <br/>
to mindful parenting) told me I needed to grieve for the missed <br/>
opportunities in my relationships with my children.<br/>
<br/>
She was right. <br/>
<br/>

who&#39;s thinking that this is probably why I had such leaky eyes at<br/>
the conference . . . . . .</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While I didn&#39;t have many of these issues...I never spanked or punished...I <br/>
was still a very controlling mom.  Only one hour of TV, bedtimes, no eating <br/>
after a certain time...lots of rules with no rhyme or reason although at the time <br/>
it seemed like a good idea.  My kids are now 11 and 15 and I felt some sadness <br/>
at the conference as I watched all those younger children who had always been <br/>
unschooled. I felt like saying..&quot;Could I have a do over, please?&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Brenna took some pictures of Diana (HaHaMommy&#39;s kids) and she said yesterday, <br/>
&quot;I noticed all the kids at the conference had  those joyful expressions.&quot;  <br/>
She captured those images in the pictures of Hayden and Hannah (mailing them to <br/>
you today Diana). Those pictures and so many of the expresssions of the <br/>
children had such a lightness and joy.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the grieving for the opportunities missed with our children but <br/>
I&#39;m so thankful that we still have the time with them that we do.  Enough time <br/>
to make a difference in their lives and hopefully in their children&#39;s lives. <br/>
Even though we made the changes late, the important thing is that we made the <br/>
changes.<br/>

Inside every big strong hairy man is a little boy who might not have gotten <br/>
all the love and attention he wanted when he was three, or six, or nine.   Men <br/>
generally aren&#39;t as into reparenting themselves as women might be, or into <br/>
being analytical about what they could have used as children.   So while I was <br/>
reparenting myself, I tried to remember to pass some of that on to Keith.  I <br/>
would  just touch him gently sometimes as I passed, kiss him on the head and say <br/>
&quot;thanks&quot; while he was paying bills, bring him a drink or a snack where he was <br/>
working in the garage or the yard or watching a movie by himself--same kinds <br/>
of things I would do for the kids, I started trying to do for him.  It was <br/>
nice.  I didn&#39;t TELL him &quot;I know there&#39;s a hurt little boy inside you.&quot;   I just <br/>
started mothering him a little bit too, and what happened was the manly <br/>
outsides got softer and sweeter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557738622">Thank you so much for saying this.  It is very insightful and more coherent<br/>
than I could put together as my own reminder ATM, but it will definitely be<br/>
saved into my keeper folder to remind myself periodically.  My husband was<br/>
spanked, left to CIO, before his mother matured and stopped.  He is really<br/>
patient with our kids, loves to just play with them, isn&#39;t as analytical<br/>
about parenting but has great instincts.  And I&#39;m sure he could use a bit<br/>
more gentle parenting as you described.<br/>

Sometimes when I talk to Madelyn (whose major desire in life is to be <br/>
a mom) I think about how lucky her children are going to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I could come back as one of her children - hey, didn&#39;t I<br/>
read about that in the National Enquirer?  <br/>
