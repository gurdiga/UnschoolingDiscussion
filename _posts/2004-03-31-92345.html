Maybe the rest of you knew, especially people in that area, but this is cool.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the royal armory when it was in the White Tower in the late 1970&#39;s, but <br/>
last time I was in England they had moved it to Leeds.<br/>
<br/>
What will Kentucky send back?  What&#39;s some good American stuff Brits might <br/>
want to see?  <br/>

<br/>
Royal Armouries plans US exhibit<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Royal Armouries in Leeds has secured a permanent exhibition space in<br/>
<br/>
the American state of Kentucky.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Royal Armouries USA will occupy the entire third floor of the new Frazier<br/>
<br/>
Historical Arms Museum, which is due to open in Louisville in May.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The exhibition will present the history of the British Isles from 1066 to<br/>
<br/>
the early 1900s. Attractions will include audio visual and multi media<br/>
<br/>
displays, life sized tableaux and nearly 400 artefacts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is believed to be the first time a national museum in the UK has opened<br/>
<br/>
a branch in America. Museum officials are hoping the relationship between<br/>
<br/>
the two museums will flourish, leading to a possible twinning arrangement<br/>
<br/>
between Louisville and Leeds.</div>
