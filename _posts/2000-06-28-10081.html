&lt;&lt; There are some church related organizations still around that help mothers<br/>
 to get back on their feet.  Not enough, but some.  Check in to these and<br/>
 find help. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Thanks for this info... It&#39;s nearly 9pm here so too late to call tonight, but <br/>
I&#39;m going to call a couple of churches in the area tomorrow to find out if <br/>
they have any programs to help support women in these situations.  I have no <br/>
problem helping out other women when I&#39;m in a position to do so.<br/>
