want to annex it. Taxes are lower since you don&#39;t have city water, <br/>
sewer, garbage, community service, library, etc. So we have well and <br/>
septic, contract out for garbage, and pay extra for the park <br/>
district activities and pay for a library card. It&#39;s still cheaper <br/>
than city taxes. It&#39;s still a little countryish but city is right <br/>
around the corner. We always tell people we live on the edge of town <br/>
with the witches and the trolls!<br/>
