<div id="ygrps-yiv-1599232112">Well, yesterday my son and his 2 friends found a dead squirrel. So after<br/>
explaining  why they should not ever touch a dead/decomposing animal (found<br/>
out many hours later that that is exactly what they did do) my son (going on<br/>
4 in Oct) wants me to repeatedly go over and over what happens when<br/>
squirrels die (plus all other living things) and why we can&#39;t touch them. So<br/>
does anyone have any really good, preferably vivid and suitable graphic<br/>
websites on decomposition. So far I&#39;ve come up with nil on google--maybe I<br/>
don&#39;t know what to look for:(<br/>

The librarians at our library are VERY impressed over the subject material<br/>
my son likes to get out--from dinosours, to space, to asteroids to today&#39;s<br/>
topic--decomposition! Plus they&#39;re impressed that we made a volcano out of<br/>
flour earlier this summer...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838588846">For his age, Magic School Bus has a book (also a video) called &quot;The Rot Squad&quot; about decomposition.  If you Google the title it comes up with a composting activity and worksheets.  I don&#39;t know you or your curric leanings, so I am not trying to push it, but I think having a compost heap makes sense anyway, and if you allowed a little meat in it, you could give him an unforgettable experience in maggots and other kinds of recycling!  That should be graphic enough (You can make your compost heap in an old shoe box so it can be quickly disposed of once you have made your point).   Debi<br/>
   So<br/>
  does anyone have any really good, preferably vivid and suitable graphic<br/>
  websites on decomposition.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1889147561">My dd had a small picture book when she was about 4 called Log Hotel. I am not sure of the author. It was all about what happens when a tree dies and how other plants and animals use the dead tree to live in and how it eventullay turns back into soil. I know that this is probably not as intense a book as you were looking for but dd certainly enjoyed it. She still stops on nature walks to see what kinds of creatures are inhabiting a fallen tree.<br/>

Alot better than dissecting one in person, yuck!!!<br/>

How about a box of latex (nonlatex if any allergies) gloves? That way he can <br/>
touch/observe to his heart&#39;s content. Eric ds carries some in his backpack. I <br/>
can&#39;t say he always uses them, but he knows to wash his hands thoroughly <br/>
whether using gloves or not.<br/>
Eric has an entire shelf in his room dedicated to his nature collection. This <br/>
includes the head of a woodpecker, decomposed lizards and frogs, an <br/>
oppossum&#39;s skull, multiple insect exoskeletons, a hummingbird, crawfish <br/>
claws, owl pellets (found, not purchased), along with many other items. <br/>
Yesterday, I found a dead bat on the front porch. Last week, it was an entire <br/>
nest of decomposing baby birds. These are all being kept sheltered from <br/>
weather outside. When he finds something in the woods, he has to keep it <br/>
outside until it completely dries out/decomposes. That avoids the stink in <br/>
our house. <br/>
This collection is fascinating. There are ways to let his curiosity blossom <br/>
without exposing him to diseases. <br/>
Another website that he might enjoy is     <br/>
www.d91.k12.id.us/www/skyline/teachers/robertsd/skulls.htm   called Animal <br/>
Skull Collection by Deloy Roberts. Animal identification based on skeletons. <br/>
If you find a skeleton, the site helps you ID. Really cool.<br/>
Hold your breath, wear gloves, keep it outside until the stench is gone, and <br/>
let him enjoy. Take a walk in the woods with him; you never know what you&#39;ll <br/>
find. <br/>
