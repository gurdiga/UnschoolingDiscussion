<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191876819">Hi, I was wondering what unschoolers do when one of their children decides <br/>
that they plan to go into a career that will need college. And what if this <br/>
child wants a more directed education? Here is an imaginary example..... a 14 <br/>
yr. old unschooled boy decides that he wants to be a doctor. He is very <br/>
motivated and sincere. His parents totally support their son and have helped <br/>
out by paying for some items he wanted and helping find information he wanted <br/>
at the library and on the net. But the son wants a more traditional approach <br/>
to education so that he will be ready for college. He even wants tests so <br/>
that he will know how to take them. He dreams of being the best in his class. <br/>
He dreams of healing the sick. If this was your family how would you approach <br/>
this situation and still be an unschooled family. <br/>
 <br/>
This is not my son (as he wants to be the 2nd Tony Hawke) but I am just <br/>
curious and want to better understand the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

&lt;&lt;  His parents totally support their son and have helped <br/>

to education so that he will be ready for college. He even wants tests so <br/>
that he will know how to take them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He could sign up for online courses or go to the community college to take <br/>
beginning chemistry or biology, to get a headstart on college.  It might even <br/>
count for college, or help him to test out of 101 when he got to college.<br/>
<br/>
Better than any school-like stuff, though, would be to find out if he could <br/>
do some volunteer or paid work in a medical lab, a hospital, a vet&#39;s <br/>
office--anywhere where he could be around professionals.  A friend of mine <br/>
was assistant to a pathologist and kept the lab when he was in high school.   <br/>
Now he&#39;s very into Chinese medicine (is a Tai Chi and Kung Fu teacher) and <br/>
his interest in medicine didn&#39;t lead to medical school, but to MUCH about the <br/>
human body.   <br/>
<br/>
That same friend used to collect road kill.  Sometimes he would dissect, or <br/>
clean to the skeletons and mess with the bones.  Sometimes he would pose the <br/>
stuff and paint it (he&#39;s an artist, too).   I was in his bathroom  yesterday <br/>
and there&#39;s a painting in there he did when he was 22 or so, of an owl we <br/>
found on the road and gave him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would look at practical, real-life experiences before I would look at <br/>
high-school-looking &quot;coursework.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778263262">I was thinking, maybe interviewing a doctor and asking him questions<br/>
like, what would you advise me to do in order to pursue a doctor career,<br/>
why did you become a doctor, etc..<br/>
