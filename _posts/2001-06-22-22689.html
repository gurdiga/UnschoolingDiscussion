<div id="ygrps-yiv-1082947872">Ah...<br/>
If by &quot;writing&quot; you mean forming letters with a pencil, that is penmanship.  <br/>
Someone can have a gorgeous writing hand and never &quot;write&quot; a thing, in the <br/>
sense that writing is creating new combinations of words which others can <br/>
read later.  <br/>
<br/>
Penmanship, being a scribe, being a clerk, etc.--that&#39;s a whole &#39;nother <br/>
thing.  An ancient art going back to Egypt and before, where one person wrote <br/>
what other people said, or copied books, so there could be extra copies.<br/>
<br/>
I think of writing as writing--setting ideas down.  And if that is done with <br/>
a computer instead of pencil on paper, it is more useful than not.  <br/>
<br/>
Neither of my boys has penmanship worth a damn, but about a month after <br/>
either of them decides he wants some, I think he will have it.  All it takes <br/>
is goofing around, copying words, writing the same sets of letters over and <br/>
over and over.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of calligraphy hands I can do fluently.  Neither took much <br/>
learning, just doing.<br/>

<br/>
I mean putting ideas on paper.  I&#39;m not concerned<br/>
about penmanship.  When she does choose to write it is<br/>
very legible.  I just want reassurance that if I leave<br/>
her to her own devices she will be able to do it when<br/>
she wants to.  Even as I type that it sounds goofy. <br/>
Of course if she wants to do something she will learn<br/>
how.  I do know that.  The truth of the matter is that<br/>
she chose to attend a small private school for four<br/>
weeks last fall.  I came across a &quot;discovery journal&quot;<br/>
recently that was required by the school, and I was<br/>
quite shocked at the inability to write simple<br/>
sentences or even spell with much success<br/>
phonetically. I admit part of it is my own ego.  I can<br/>
just imagine the school teacher&#39;s discussing what a<br/>
lousy job of homeschooling I&#39;m doing!  So I guess the<br/>
question for parents of older homeschoolers is - am I<br/>
right or am I wrong that she will at some point<br/>
develop an interest in expressing herself?  And if she<br/>
doesn&#39;t than what?  She is not a child who easily<br/>
accepts direction so I&#39;m not even sure what to do if I<br/>
should be doing something...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone for input.<br/>
