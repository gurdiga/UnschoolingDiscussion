<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196576957">Hi...have had company here this weekend and have been unable to read all the great responses, much less think about and reply to them, but I will get to it in the next couple of days.  For now, thanks so much for the thought-provoking, helpful and sometimes downright funny advice and observations!<br/>
<br/>
I love this list!<br/>
