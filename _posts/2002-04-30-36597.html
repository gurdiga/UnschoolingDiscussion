<div id="ygrps-yiv-1557655917">You know, I really have no idea. When we lived in Ga. and had a Krispy Kreme<br/>
near us, we just went in for the fresh glazed. There was usually a LONG line<br/>
to get them too.<br/>

&gt; So maybe that&#39;s the problem, I&#39;ve never had them fresh and hot before.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like glazed donuts I general and I think of KK&#39;s as all having<br/>
&gt; glaze because that&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever seen.  Do they make a cake donut<br/>
&gt; with cinnamon sugar?  My personal favorite donut.<br/>

   The fresh baked glazed donuts are the main attraction ... no doubt, but that isn&#39;t all there is! They do have the cake donuts with cinnamon sugar, but they also have chocolate covered donuts with bavarian cream filling. I had a personal relationship with the Krispy Kream crew because of those bavarian cream filled donuts when I was pregnant! lol<br/>
