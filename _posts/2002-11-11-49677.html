<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m beginning to get a fairly good idea of what not to<br/>
&gt; do, but... how does one put this unschooling into practice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You simply jump in and do it.<br/>
<br/>
You can read here, read at Unschooling.com, read websites, books, magazines,<br/>
etc. until it all comes out your ears, and while reading is a good idea to<br/>
some extent, you won&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; until you do it.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that today is Saturday at your house.  (It isn&#39;t, of course, but so<br/>
what.)  What would you like to do this Saturday?  No commitments?  Want to<br/>
go to the zoo, a museum, or the mall?  Or maybe you&#39;re feeling stressed out<br/>
from too much &quot;do&quot; lately and want to sit on the couch and veg with the TV<br/>
all day.  Maybe you have been trying to win that durned computer game for<br/>
days now and you have a whole day to go at it!  Or maybe there&#39;s a lot of<br/>
cleaning that needs doing, or a meeting to go to, or a project you&#39;ve been<br/>
meaning to get to, or....<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do the same thing every Saturday when I worked full time, and I<br/>
certainly don&#39;t do the same thing every day now that I&#39;m home.  Don&#39;t expect<br/>
your child to, either.  Just like Saturdays, let him do what he wants.<br/>
