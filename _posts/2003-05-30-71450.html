unschooling.  So for some of us, the interesting unit study/eclectic approach <br/>
is a step towards true unschooling.<br/>
I&#39;d say you&#39;re getting closer each time you shed some schoolish layers.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we see the connections in everything. It&#39;s a natural flow that happens, <br/>
not because I&#39;m trying to make it into a unit study.<br/>
You&#39;re getting there Olga!<br/>
