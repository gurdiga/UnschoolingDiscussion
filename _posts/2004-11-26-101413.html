<div id="ygrps-yiv-41284739">This morning my 22 yo dd  Martha and I went shopping.   She is home for <br/>
Thanksgiving from her 4-yr. private college, where she is a senior.  We saw <br/>
a lady frrom our former church, whose dd just went to the same college as a <br/>
freshman this year.  The mother told us how hard the semester has been for <br/>
her dd, that (public) high school was hard enough, but that the girl is <br/>
really having a tough transition.  She wants to stay, but already needs to <br/>
pull grades up.<br/>
    Martha started telling how she had started by taking classes at the <br/>
local community college, to get used to the level of work required, and then <br/>
had made the transition to the four year school.   It had worked very well, <br/>
she had adjusted then to being away from home, she was  glad she had chosen <br/>
that route, etc.<br/>
    It was so good for me to hear that she actually liked the way she chose <br/>
to do college and isn&#39;t sorry that she hadn&#39;t gone straight to a four-year <br/>
or left home sooner.  She was homeschooled (very, very relaxed) after 2nd <br/>
grade until she began college.   My older ds had done college the same way, <br/>
and it was good to hear Martha talking about it to someone else, telling her <br/>
the benefits, even though it&#39;s too late for her dd.  It gave me a nice warm <br/>
feeling to hear one of my children affirm that she liked the way we chose to <br/>
do things in our family, both the parts we chose for her (such as trying out <br/>
homeschooling) and the parts she chose herself.:-)<br/>
<br/>
I know that both my ds 26 and dd 22 are happy that they chose community <br/>
college, first a few classes, then  full loads, then with 40+ credits, <br/>
transfer to a 4-year school.<br/>
Neither ever took SATs or ACTs.  They both did well enough at the community <br/>
college to have partial scholarships at the four-year.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, ds knew pretty much what he wanted to do since age 5, and dd <br/>
decided on her major while at community college, but is now taking a <br/>
different direction for grad school.  And dd 24 chose to go to cosmetology <br/>
school and has been working happily in that field for about 6 years.  I <br/>
really believe that all children are unique and will approach life, <br/>
learning, possible college, and employment in their own way. FWIW<br/>
