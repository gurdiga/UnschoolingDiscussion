<div id="ygrps-yiv-664905009">Sandra:  Your clever comment:   &quot;Unschooling should provide an atmosphere of inquiry and clear thinking, and if the parents can&#39;t even do that among other adults, how can they pass it on to their children?&quot;  made me smile.    Thanks for the challenge to higher standards of critical thinking.<br/>
<br/>
Elizabeth:  Thanks for your interesting points about scientific inquiry, and the insightful suggestion that inspiration and discovery can come from discussions (like cleaning metals!) that are not &quot;completely rational, linear and clear&quot;.  Well put!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group (& to homeschooling!), but have thoroughly enjoyed following &quot;threads&quot; of the past week&#39;s discussions.   Been itching to jump in with my two bits on Santa, vaccines, etc.   Sorry, I don&#39;t have much to add re: Coke!    Had no idea anyone might consider Coke to be corrosive to the stomach, but wouldn&#39;t be surprised if a doctor advised people with ulcers to stay off it!   Our family&#39;s always avoided it due to  1) overload of sugar  2) caffeine  3) carbonation  4) artificial color  5) aluminum & plastic clogging up landfills, but mostly because ~ 6) we like water best   :)<br/>

Subject: Re: cleaning metals in unusual ways<br/>
<br/>
And what is unscientific about hearing an idea and<br/>
testing it out for yourself, or asking someone if they<br/>
have and what happened, let alone with piping up about<br/>
something in a similar vein of thought, re: Coke<br/>
cleans this metal and toothpaste can another?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry your thread was hijacked, but conversations can<br/>
take on many tangents. That doesn&#39;t make it any less<br/>
informative or interesting for those interested in<br/>
following that tangent. <br/>
<br/>
As it is, yes, we should be fostering our children&#39;s<br/>
curiosity and helping them to think it through<br/>
clearly. But not all of us have that ability<br/>
ourselves, so bouncing ideas off other adults before<br/>
we bring it up to our children or our children bring<br/>
it up with us is a fully rational thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was an expression of my frustration that people<br/>
will make public recommendations about things without<br/>
really looking at what they&#39;re saying.&quot; (Sandra)<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. That can be frustrating. Not everyone thinks<br/>
before they speak, but just because it&#39;s not an idea<br/>
that grabs you doesn&#39;t mean that it&#39;s not valid. It<br/>
may be off the wall, and it may not even be right (and<br/>
the person might not be aware of that, but I doubt<br/>
their intention was not to throw out disinformation);<br/>
but it may also bring out something else that IS right<br/>
and IS valid - and something that inspires someone<br/>
else&#39;s curiosity and thinking to find out more about<br/>
it. The process isn&#39;t necessarily everything, nor is<br/>
the end. <br/>
<br/>
How many inventions have come about because someone<br/>
was thinking one thing, wanting something to happen a<br/>
certain way, and something else happened instead? <br/>
<br/>
Scientific thought isn&#39;t necessarily completely<br/>
rational linear and clear. <br/>

&gt; Any toothpaste?  What kind?<br/>

&gt; Those are NOT questions I want answers to.<br/>
&gt; Those are questions I think should&#39;ve been answered<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The purpose of this subject line was not to exchange<br/>
&gt; suggestions about coca <br/>
&gt; cola or other alternative metal cleaners.  It was an<br/>
&gt; objection to <br/>
&gt; non-scientific thought. It was an expression of my<br/>
