<div id="ygrps-yiv-57616627">Hi all,<br/>
     I&#39;ve been a member here since Nov. of 1999, but I rarely <br/>
frequent the list.  Six kiddos (2-23 y/o) and life keeps me pretty <br/>
busy.  Anyhow, my 7 y/o is having surgery for his crossed eyes in <br/>
May.  When we go to the eye doctors I&#39;ve always had to ask them to <br/>
use pictures instead of letters with the check-ups.  Sometimes I get <br/>
odd looks, but overall the docs have been pretty good about it.  <br/>
However, they sent us to an optimalogist to see about surgery and the <br/>
assistant promptly gave me a folder on dyslexia when I asked for them <br/>
to use the pictures during testing.  Even the doc recommended <br/>
contacting professionals for help.  I take everything in stride, but <br/>
of course my mother was with us and likes having a potential label <br/>
for her non-reading grandchildren (my homeschooling sister&#39;s 11 y/o <br/>
daughter doesn&#39;t read either).  She&#39;s even buying them reading helps <br/>
now, she&#39;s so concerned.  I don&#39;t let it bother me and accept that my <br/>
son has a different learning style.  He comes right out and tells us <br/>
he&#39;s not even interested in learning to read.  I think its fine and <br/>
don&#39;t let it bother me, but boy it sure bothers others.  I tell my <br/>
mother if I went to Japan I&#39;d be a non-reader too...so what.  The <br/>
info I was given says dyslexia is a language disorder and not a <br/>
visual disorder, but it&#39;ll be interesting to see what kind of <br/>
difference it&#39;ll make for my son once he gets his eyes uncrossed.  I <br/>
have no intentions to get him evaluated for dyslexia.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing this unschooling thing for to many years to get flustered about <br/>
it.  What sort of helps have any of you that have children with (so <br/>
called) dyslexia used?  I&#39;m just wondering if there is some type of <br/>
learning supplies or experiences that I haven&#39;t thought of, that I <br/>
could provide for him that he may find interesting and want to use or <br/>
take part in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234929142">I have no experience with dyslexia, but I have a 10yo son who was born with<br/>
strabismus (crossed eyes).  He had surgery at the age of 8 months.  With<br/>
many, many years of on and off patching and glasses he has just been to the<br/>
doctor who declared Ryan doesn&#39;t need glasses or patching any more.  The<br/>
doctor (he is new because we moved last year) was very impressed with our<br/>
previous doctor&#39;s efforts over the past 10 years.  Anyway, just wanted to<br/>
let you know that with proper treatment you can have a really good outcome!<br/>
We are so happy.  We were able to donate his last pair of glasses because<br/>
they had been worn only rarely and were in excellent condition.  So, good<br/>
luck to you and your son!  I hope the surgery goes well.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I wanted to say my son also has mild autism and hasn&#39;t used the<br/>
alphabetic eye charts (he is still not a reader at age 10), but he does use<br/>
the pictures and started to use the E chart recently (you know the one with<br/>
fingers up, down, right, left.).  We never had anyone emphasize the fact<br/>
that Ryan didn&#39;t reliably know his letters and couldn&#39;t read.  Perhaps it<br/>
was the autism, but 7 is pretty young for reading anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I would take the dyslexia info politely and then ignore it.  Unschooling<br/>
will be the best thing you can do for your son.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

     We&#39;re looking forward to a good outcome with this surgery too.  <br/>
I&#39;m so glad to hear that your son has done well with it and is no <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106918904">While I have several friends with dyslexia, only two have told me of things <br/>
they&#39;ve used successfully to fend it off.<br/>
<br/>
One never learned to read properly, partly from problems with the dyslexia, <br/>
until she went to Germany with her now ex-husband and learned German. <br/>
Since then, she was able to go back and re-learn English, though she admits <br/>
sometimes she kind of has to think it in German then translate it into English.<br/>
<br/>
Another friend has to read constantly (whatever, where-ever she is), or else <br/>
her ability to read just sort of... falters, and she has to work to get back up to <br/>
the level she was at before.<br/>
<br/>
- Both are fluent in 2+ languages, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never read anything about it - in fact, the stuff pushed at various people <br/>
I&#39;ve known whose kids were labeled dyslexic never mentioned either of these <br/>
techniques.  But it works, at least insofar as non-pictographic languages are <br/>
concerned.  I&#39;ll let you know if I notice anything as I continue to try to foster <br/>
Cantonese and Mandarin, with the written Chinese, in my children (so they <br/>
can communicate with all their relatives on daddy&#39;s side).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-750332624">Hi Robin<br/>
<br/>
My dh has dyslexia and had no help.He reads well but spells badly. He got a job he loves lol. It was not the end of the world for him. He is brill at maths and has engineering skills. I have two dd&#39;s with dyslexia ( some children with dyslexia find sequencing and some maths hard)- both read now - one took til she was 11 but is great now. She, at 12,  just past a diploma in homeopathy cos she wanted to do it. School wrote her off at 6. She did not read in school and only started when unschooled.  The other reads well - she is 10 and writes well when she feels like it.<br/>
<br/>
Youngest son aged 6 seems to be similar to dh and dh is also colour blind. He can read tho quite well for a 6 year old unschooler.  It is not something I have bothered with at his age. Some opthamologists here ( UK) give overlays to help reading but it is only with certain types of dyslexia. None of my children have had it.  None of them have had any special treatment.  I suppose I am saying they get there in the end.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-437948137">I find this interesting that your friend had an easier time learning <br/>
to read with another language.  What is her nationality by chance?  <br/>
It makes me wonder if our brains may be hard-wired to a particular <br/>
language inherited through our genetic make-up???  Than again, my son <br/>
came up to me yesterday and played a page from the Learning Leap Frog <br/>
that his Grandma got him.  It was in Spanish and he said he wanted to <br/>
learn it.  That&#39;s the first time he&#39;s really mentioned he wanted to <br/>
learn something related to reading and language.  I wonder if I <br/>
exposed him to other languages, if he&#39;d still pick Spanish or some <br/>
other language over it or English.  My youngest daughter (16) also <br/>
said she wanted to learn Chinese when she was very young, but of <br/>
course I was to busy making sure she could read and write in English <br/>
to accomadate her.  With that said my background is of German/French <br/>
descent and my husband is of Swiss/German/Irish.  I would think with <br/>
our backgrounds, he may prefer German like your friend.  Who knows <br/>
maybe I&#39;m off here.<br/>

I find this interesting that your friend had an easier time learning <br/>
to read with another language.  What is her nationality by chance?  <br/>
It makes me wonder if our brains may be hard-wired to a particular <br/>
language inherited through our genetic make-up??? -=-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
Naw. I don&#39;t think so. I think some people have an easier time working <br/>
with other languages. I do. It might be genetic---but not *for* a certain <br/>
language---and neither of my parents is bilingual. I&#39;m Scottish all the <br/>
way back, both sides. I&#39;m fluent in German. I can understand and read Spanish,<br/>
 but speaking is poor. I can read French, and I remember a handful of words <br/>
(animals, parts of the body, simple phrases). My Italian is limited to &quot;menu Italian&quot; &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
I still have a pretty good handle on Latin, and I still know most of the Greek <br/>
letters and sounds---but I&#39;ve forgotten almost ALL the ancient Greek I learned.<br/>
 <br/>
I have a friend, Izumi Shiraishi-Cantley, who is Japanese. She learned <br/>
English by coming to the US and studying at Randolph-Macon. Decided to learn <br/>
German and then went to Germany and Austria with me. While at the <br/>
University of Vienna with me, she learned French.<br/>
 <br/>
My friend Hugh McGlinchy did the same: German in Vienna with me, <br/>
then on to Wales to learn Welsh. Had such a good time that he went to <br/>
Japan---married a Taiwanese woman and now knows Chinese! He&#39;s <br/>
taught English to the locals in Japan and Taiwan for years.<br/>
 <br/>
So I think it&#39;s a Howard Gardner thang. Some are good, <br/>
some are not, and some have to work at it. But I really don&#39;t <br/>
think we are &quot;programmed&quot; to learn the languages of our origins! &lt;g&gt;~Kelly<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328804022">Ok, Sandra your reply makes sense, if in fact she experienced trauma <br/>
in trying to learn to read the English language.  However, if she was <br/>
born and raised in the USA she would&#39;ve been exposed to English <br/>
everywhere, even in a non-learning enviroment (i.e., outside of <br/>
school).  You simply can&#39;t get away from it, English is everywhere.  <br/>
We are immersed in it.  Yet, she has to &#39;think&#39; in German to <br/>
translate into English.  That is amazing!  She didn&#39;t grow up being <br/>
exposed to German on a daily basis and yet she has to &#39;think&#39; in <br/>
German to get English.  They say Dyslexia is a language barrier.  My <br/>
son has had zero pressure to learn to read.  The only pressure is <br/>
occasionally directed towards me from others.  He is not traumatized <br/>
by the English language whatsoever.  He is immersed in it, but yet <br/>
right now he finds Spanish more appealing.  My sister&#39;s daughter is <br/>
11 y/o and I know she has had no pressure to learn to read.  If there <br/>
is any pressure it is from my mother towards my sister to do <br/>
something.  I trust that she&#39;ll read when she is ready, just as I do <br/>
with my son.  Yet, it took her friend into her adult years until she <br/>
learned German on her own.  For some reason, whether it was trauma or <br/>
not, her brain related to German and she finally had all the elements <br/>
she needed in place to learned how to read.  On the other hand, her <br/>
other friend has to continually work at it or she regresses.  Could <br/>
it be that some element is still missing for her, even though she <br/>
knows other languages?  Sure, she is reading and knows other <br/>
languages, but even as an adult she still struggles.  She couldn&#39;t <br/>
have experienced trauma with all the languages that she knows, could <br/>
she?  I don&#39;t know if she has trouble only with English or the other <br/>
languages she knows as well.  I don&#39;t know much about dyslexia, but <br/>
it seems to me that trauma can&#39;t be the cause of it.  The other gal <br/>
from the UK who responded would probably tell you her girls were not <br/>
traumatized either.  A response from her in this regard would be <br/>
helpful.  It makes me interested in reading that book recommended <br/>
here now, because maybe I&#39;m missing something.  Like I said, I may be <br/>
off here, but I find the learning of other languages an intriguing <br/>
possibility, perhaps its finding the right one that relates to our <br/>
genetic make-up?<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It seems, though, that she just didn&#39;t have any trauma associated <br/>
with  <br/>
&gt; learning to read German.  And she was older.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Unschoolers can learn to read without trauma and when they&#39;re <br/>
older.   It <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t have to be a second language, just needs to be without the  <br/>
&gt; school-supplied deadlines by age, and shaming and pressure.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Also, unschoolers&#39; kids are reading &quot;later,&quot; perhaps, but they&#39;re <br/>
reading  <br/>
&gt; real, live, wild, honest language rather than carefully <br/>
programmed &quot;beginner&quot;  <br/>
&gt; stuff.   When first graders are told they are reading, and are <br/>
getting  A&#39;s in <br/>
&gt; reading, and bringing something home to read aloud, that seems like <br/>
a big  <br/>
&gt; deal, but hand one the current issue of Time or Newsweek, and <br/>
you&#39;ll find out he  <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t &quot;really&quot; read.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s just really different, to wait until a child has all the <br/>
elements in  <br/>
&gt; place in his own mind to figure out reading for <br/>
himself.  &quot;Properly&quot; means  <br/>
&gt; functionally for that person.  Different people read in different <br/>
ways, and  <br/>
&gt; there&#39;s no getting around that.<br/>

language or the other may strike a cord and boom that person can <br/>

that dyslexia is a language barrier.  On the other hand, perhaps <br/>
there is a recessive gene there or something?  I&#39;m taking some art <br/>

telling me of a student that was black.  However, when this student&#39;s <br/>

know that that same possibility can&#39;t be related to dyslexia?  I <br/>
know, I&#39;m throwing out far out possibilities here.  I just find it <br/>
intriguing that someone who is immersed in a language all of their <br/>
life has to think in another language learned as an adult in order to <br/>
read the language they grew up with.  I guess I need to shut up and <br/>

<br/>
I think, just like some people don&#39;t really understand math until they&#39;re<br/>

<br/>
But I read when I&#39;m driving (signs) and I read while I&#39;m eating (Silk<br/>

Sure, left-handedness (often associated with dyslexia) can come in a child of <br/>
two right-handed parents.  <br/>
<br/>
Dyslexia is discussed at GREAT length elsewhere on the internet, yahoogroups, <br/>
message boards.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful to unschoolers to worry about it <br/>
too much.   <br/>
<br/>
When children are given leeway and encouragement and resources to learn <br/>
things at their own pace in their own way, then it&#39;s not important for the parents <br/>
to label and change the type of opportunity and resource because of something <br/>
SO minor and normal as the traits schools label ADHD and dyslexia.    <br/>
<br/>
Schools get more money and hire specialists when they have labelled kids.  <br/>
Schools blame &quot;disease&quot; for their own failure when they label kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Neither of those factors plays into unschooling in the least, and the purpose <br/>
of this list is to help people move toward an understanding of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Well, part of it is that German is very regular, which makes spelling <br/>
sooo much easier. If you know how the word is pronounced, you can <br/>
spell it, unlike English. If I lived in Germany and spoke/wrote only <br/>
German for a few years, I wouldn&#39;t have the same issues with spelling <br/>
as I do on a daily basis with this English language. Like just now <br/>
when I had to check my spelling of dyslexic 3 times before I figured <br/>
out what letter was missing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was also how I learned it--in 7-10 grades, in much clearer <br/>
terms than in English grammar classes, without hearing non-standard <br/>
German speech in daily life. I think it was mostly because we had a <br/>
really crappy English grammar book that we used every year, so again, <br/>
it could be very personal reasons having nothing to do with <br/>
dyslexia...<br/>

Yes!  I&#39;ve been playing around with Spanish and the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation seems completely regular.  In comparison, the inconsistent complexity of English seems like a cruel thing to inflict on a beginner.  (Just my opinion.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-902163873">Hi, all~<br/>
<br/>
It seems my quick post needs a little clarifying, so here goes (warning, <br/>
it&#39;s long).<br/>
<br/>
I was discussing it again with my friend who has to read constantly - <br/>
and by constantly I mean all the time when she&#39;s awake, whatever she <br/>
glances at she&#39;s got to read, or at least scan, or she has to work at it <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
She confirmed what I was remembering:  dyslexia is a neurological <br/>
disorder, affecting the parts of the brain that handle language.  And <br/>
while yes, English, especially the &quot;American&quot; dialect, is a nasty thing <br/>
to inflict on younglings, it isn&#39;t the culprit here.  From what I&#39;ve <br/>
learned about how the brain works (over the last 20+ years), it would <br/>
seem to me that adding additional languages to the mix would <br/>
automatically encourage not only the continual addition of neurological <br/>
connections, but also do so across more areas of the brain - including <br/>
across both hemispheres.  This wider network would allow for more <br/>
redundancy, thus helping someone combat the neurological disorder that <br/>
is dyslexia (where the working of the neuro-network is screwy, for some <br/>
reason).<br/>
<br/>
I suspect no two cases of dyslexia are identical, so one can take heart <br/>
in another thing my friend found out, during her college years - a <br/>
professor pointed out that she consistently made the *same sets* of <br/>
mistakes, almost as if her brain had certain ciphers, or codes, that it <br/>
used.  So, adding in that another part - of her disorder? her specific <br/>
neurology? they don&#39;t know - is that, once having identified the sets of <br/>
mistakes she routinely makes (due to the disorder), she can predict <br/>
them, and also use that knowledge to edit what she writes, and even what <br/>
she says.  I&#39;ve had her do the latter in conversations with her, where <br/>
she catches herself, corrects the mistake, and we go on.<br/>
<br/>
No biggie, really.  But she does suspect that that disorder had a hand <br/>
in her only really being able to &#39;read&#39; read by around 5.5-6 yrs of <br/>
age.  (&#39;read&#39; read = complex stuff, not the &quot;See Jim run&quot; kind of stuff.)<br/>
<br/>
[Just fyi, here, but I don&#39;t know when I learned to read (I do know that <br/>
it was &quot;read&quot; reading, not just kiddie stuff, because that&#39;s what I was <br/>
interested in as well as exposed to) - but it wasn&#39;t until I was 4 that <br/>
my handwriting and knowledge of how to spell my name well enough <br/>
combined so I could sign-to-get my first library card. Gosh, that&#39;s such <br/>
a neat, and empowering, memory!]<br/>
<br/>
The other friend did speak and (with limited ability) read English as a <br/>
child.  Things just never really worked properly until her brain added <br/>
German, too.  And she doesn&#39;t *always have to* re-route into and out of <br/>
German - just when she gets stuck or &quot;stumbles&quot; in English.  I have to <br/>
say, though, it&#39;s really cute when she spouts off in German to my kids!  <br/>
They&#39;re used to English and various dialects of Chinese, even Japanese <br/>
(we&#39;re big into quality Anime, here, especially stuff from Studio <br/>
Ghibli), so they look at her like she&#39;s suddenly shown that she&#39;s an <br/>
alien from another planet - then they relax and look at her like she&#39;s a <br/>
likeable, but really  weird, person.  &lt;chuckle&gt;<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I&#39;m thinking of getting a copy of that book, myself - it sounds <br/>
really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
But as far as any type of schooling goes - whether &quot;un&quot; or not - I <br/>
suspect that it is really up to us as parents to keep close track of the <br/>
patterns our children show and share with us.  I know when I was oh, <br/>
maybe from 3-10, I had to keep track of whether I wrote a &quot;b&quot; or a &quot;d,&quot; <br/>
rather than switching them.  It was strictly a written problem, not a <br/>
verbal or reading one; but my Mom was the one who pointed it out to me, <br/>
and helped me keep track of it until I showed her that I was responsible <br/>
on this issue, too.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;d try to keep track of the problems, and see if there are any <br/>
patterns.  The brain is so complex we&#39;ll still be studying it for <br/>
centuries before there&#39;s any kind of &quot;guidebook&quot; to how it works, so <br/>
just keep track of patterns and use them for a corrective guide, I&#39;d say.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as far as I know, while they&#39;ve just &quot;discovered&quot; that humans <br/>
still add neurological connections throughout life (**explaining the <br/>
people who facilitate languages easily), the vast majority of the <br/>
language sets are hardwired into babies before they are a year old.  It <br/>
might be by 8-10 months, I can&#39;t remember exactly.  After that, they&#39;re <br/>
brains are programmed to easily work with that native language or <br/>
languages, and additional ones are going to have to be worked at.  <br/>
That&#39;s a big reason I&#39;ve been trying to expose my children to Cantonese <br/>
and Mandarin - I want them to be able to add the more difficult stuff as <br/>
I can provide it to them, knowing that they&#39;ve already gotten the early <br/>
hard-wiring done.  That&#39;s why there are so many multi-lingual baby <br/>
learning toys.  And it&#39;s supposed to add a better ability for other <br/>
skills, like math, later on.<br/>
<br/>
And this isn&#39;t the only stuff that gets hardwired early, either.  For <br/>
example: According to lots of studies done, language skills start <br/>
deteriorating between the ages of about 8-12, so if you&#39;ve not gotten it <br/>
in by then, you&#39;ve got more work to do to garner the same quality of <br/>
skill-sets.  On the other hand, learning is always interrupted by major <br/>
hormonal changes, especially around growth spurts, so that adds more <br/>
twists and turns to the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
But none of that kind of stuff is affected by racial differences.  Maybe <br/>
by cultural ones, since that&#39;s how we&#39;re raised (the whole &#39;nature vs. <br/>
nurture&#39; thing), but when it comes down to how we function, it&#39;s pretty <br/>
much that we&#39;re all just... human.<br/>
<br/>
**Oh, and the people who learn lots of languages easily as an adult?  <br/>
Beyond an individual&#39;s inherent ability to learn that kind of stuff <br/>
well, the basis of language is really all about ciphering - codes.  The <br/>
more languages you learn, the more you see how the codes work, and the <br/>
more able you are to pick up on the similarities in how the language <br/>
codes are structured.  That&#39;s why people who are good at languages are <br/>
usually also good with math and music - they&#39;re languages, too.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m pretty new to the list, and this whole thread has kind of <br/>
gotten hi-jacked, so I&#39;ll be off the board for a while.  But I&#39;ll be <br/>
happy to continue this stuff - or other stuff - via personal email, if <br/>
anybody wants to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Be Well!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Naw. I don&#39;t think so. I think some people have an easier time<br/>
&gt; working<br/>
&gt; &gt; with other languages. I do. It might be genetic---but not *for* a<br/>
&gt; certain<br/>
&gt; &gt; language---So I think it&#39;s a Howard Gardner thang. Some are good,<br/>
&gt; &gt; some are not, and some have to work at it. But I really don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; think we are &quot;programmed&quot; to learn the languages of our origins!<br/>

making that they won&#39;t self correct.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when pointing something out will be helpful and <br/>
appreciated. But I think there are far more times it&#39;s best not to say <br/>
anything and let them figure it out themselves.<br/>
<br/>
*When* to point and when to keep silent is tricky, of course. Sometimes <br/>
it helps if we ask ourselves if we&#39;d point it out to a friend. But that <br/>
assumes the friend has made a mistake and wants to correct it. A child <br/>
who is reversing letters isn&#39;t doing it because they&#39;re making <br/>
mistakes. Their brain just isn&#39;t ready to pin letters down to facing <br/>
one direction ;-) My daughter reversed several letters and numbers for <br/>
quite a while (until she was 10 maybe?) and now at 13 never does. I <br/>
could have pointed them out repeatedly to her but to what effect? What <br/>
if the pointing had corrected her reversals when she was 7? What <br/>
advantage would that have been to her? And what price would she have <br/>
paid for that?<br/>

might need so that it won&#39;t be as hard for them to acquire it if they <br/>
need it in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling advice is to give them what they want and need now and that <br/>
will prepare them to do what they want to do in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Living today as a 4 yo is what prepares someone to be a 5 yo. We don&#39;t <br/>
need to do anything special to prepare them. All we need to do is give <br/>
them what they need today and they can handle tomorrow. And it builds <br/>
day by day until they become perfectly competent 5 yos.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is interested in Chinese then an unschooling mom should do <br/>
what she can to help a child explore that.<br/>
<br/>
But it won&#39;t help someone unschool better to try expose a child to <br/>
Chinese *because* it might help them in the future.<br/>
