Probably the biggest difference you will notice is that you will be <br/>
more regular!  Remember that vegetarians can be unhealthy too, if they <br/>
are eating a lot of processed foods.  The trick is to eat things that <br/>
are as close to their original state as possible, meaning whole, raw <br/>
foods.  If there are things on the label that you cannot pronounce you <br/>
probably shouldn&#39;t be eating them either, as a general rule.  Organic <br/>
food will have more nutritional value also and less toxins.  I buy <br/>
flour free bread too and my kids can&#39;t tell the difference.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah - ok. I tried some of that one time from the grocery store now that <br/>
you jogged my memory (they had a mini-freezer in the baked goods <br/>
section there where the sprouted grain bread resided so it would stay <br/>
fresh - had a whole description on the package as to why and how they <br/>
do it the way they do, including quickly freezing it to keep it from <br/>
going bad). Toasted it wasn&#39;t bad but as a general purpose item I <br/>
personally didn&#39;t care for it - flavor was okay, texture seemed &#39;off&#39; <br/>
for my taste. DH didn&#39;t mind it so much, DS wouldn&#39;t eat it. Maybe if <br/>
we hit a whole foods store (I&#39;ve been wanting an excuse to go to the <br/>
new Trader Joe&#39;s but at a 30 minute drive through the city it hasn&#39;t <br/>
been a priority) and found a different brand that is flat out fresh <br/>
(never frozen), that would likely be different. I know many breads <br/>
(even basic may as well eat the wrapper white bread) lose a lot when <br/>
frozen then thawed. (I think the wrapper of the product even suggested <br/>
toasting it).<br/>
<br/>
I googled the brand name of the stuff we bought and this is what they <br/>
said about the sprouting:<br/>
&quot;We believe in sprouting the grains we use in our breads because <br/>
sprouting is the only way to release all of the vital nutrients stored <br/>
in whole grains.* To unlock this dormant food energy, maximize <br/>
nutrition and flavor, we add just the right amount of water to healthy <br/>
whole organically grown grains which are already bursting with <br/>
nutrients. Beneficial enzymes are activated which cause the grains to <br/>
sprout and become a living food.<br/>
&lt;company name&gt; breads, made from sprouted grains, are richer in <br/>
protein and vitamins than bread baked from dry grains ground into <br/>
flour.<br/>
Our exclusive sprouting process not only significantly increases <br/>
valuable nutrients such as vitamin A, vitamin C, B-vitamins, calcium, <br/>
iron, magnesium and potassium but also causes a natural change that <br/>
makes the protein and carbohydrates easier for the body to use. In <br/>
fact, sprouts are lower in carbohydrates and calories than the grains <br/>
from which they were sprouted.&quot;<br/>

This has been our biggest obstacle. Several times we have tried to make<br/>
dietary changes and we just couldn&#39;t afford it. It costs over twice as much<br/>
to but organic for us than to buy crap. I guess I could cook from scratch<br/>
more. I&#39;m just not a very good cook (I bake like Betty Crocker though.<br/>

I had many years of this. Kate was vegetarian for quite a while. We tend to<br/>
eat a mix of meat and vegetarian dishes anyway, so that helped.<br/>
<br/>
I usually try to make meals that can be put together since we have quite a<br/>
variety of tastes here anyway.  I just bought vegetarian alternatives to add<br/>
to the mix. So when I make spaghetti, I have noodles, sauce, cheese and<br/>
meatballs all separate and people combine whatever they want. I just add<br/>
veggie meatballs as an option. For things like chili, I don&#39;t put meat in<br/>
sometimes anyway (the beans provide plenty of protein). If I&#39;m in the mood<br/>
for meat, I just put some in another pot without meat or with a meat<br/>
alternative. It dirties an extra pot, but it&#39;s not any extra work. Chicken<br/>
patties, hotdogs, hamburgers all have veggie alternatives of course. Tacos<br/>
are easy to do this with.  If I&#39;m doing a meal like roast chicken or beef,<br/>
then I just make sure there are quick and easy veggie &quot;meats&quot; available to<br/>
heat up. Kate would do that herself.  I would make sure to do some<br/>
vegetarian meals as well since we like that anyway.  As long as I have the<br/>
alternatives handy, it wasn&#39;t&#39; much extra work. It is pricier though.  <br/>

 I really don&#39;t care if a cow cheese is officially vegetarian or<br/>
not....I&#39;m a bad vegetarian I guess. But I don&#39;t eat the stuff usually<br/>
and it&#39;s one place I can cut cost for the non-veg heads. Cow cheese<br/>
all tastes the same...veg or not.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Brenna has been vegetarian for about 4 years and I occasionally eat fish  but <br/>
no red meat.  Broc and Logan are both meat eaters and would like it  every <br/>
day.  And cooking is not high on my priortity list of enjoyable  activities &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
What works best for us is to keep the pantry and freezer stocked with  simple <br/>
things that we can all fix easily.  I keep hummus and a variety of  cheeses, <br/>
yogurt, cottage cheese,  and our staple frozen vegetarian  burgers.  We like <br/>
Gardenburger and it allows us each to make a single  burger anytime in a few <br/>
minutes.<br/>
 <br/>
We use the soy burger crumbles in place of most meat for things like chili  <br/>
and spaghetti.  I made lasagne a couple of nights ago and only put meat in  <br/>
half the sauce so one end of it was vegetarian and everyone was happy.  If  I <br/>
make something like a chicken stew in the crock pot,  I just  leave the chicken <br/>
pieces whole and she and I eat the vegies.<br/>
 <br/>
Since we&#39;ve been in New Mexico, Broc and Logan supplement by getting Blakes  <br/>
green chili hamburgers a couple of times a week...&lt;g&gt;<br/>

Not only does that remind me to mention next fall&#39;s conference again<br/>
(preliminary photo-inspiration here:   SandraDodd.com/abq )<br/>

Keith&#39;s parents will probably pass 90 and they eat very little, and <br/>
none of<br/>
that very good. Pancake mix, and the cheapest possible of whatever <br/>
they do<br/>
get.<br/>
<br/>
My mom died in her 70&#39;s though she smoke and drank and hardly ever <br/>
ate<br/>
anything that didn&#39;t come out of a can in those later years.<br/>
<br/>
Her parents had a little farm and ate okra, green beans and tomatoes <br/>
that<br/>
they grew themselves, but the okra was always rolled in cornmeal <br/>
batter and<br/>
fried, and for breakfast EVERY day they had homemade biscuits, <br/>
sausage and eggs.<br/>
<br/>
She smoked, he dipped snuff, they got old.<br/>
<br/>
Spam... Most of them ate a lot of Spam.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Darn those people that are blest with good genes!!  There is <br/>
something to quality of life too though and I know I don&#39;t feel very <br/>
good or full of life when I eat crappy.<br/>

 Except for the high fat content, the meat used is of good quality<br/>
(Shoulder Pork And haM = SPAM) and doesn&#39;t contain any &quot;weird&quot; parts<br/>
the way sausage or scrapple does.<br/>
<br/>
Twinkies on the other hand...are okay too!! (well, except for the<br/>
artifical flavors and colors..blech)  The reason they don&#39;t go bad is<br/>
because they contain no dairy products, not even in the creamy filling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah so I guess that&#39;s how to connect Spam to Hawaii - I &#39;got&#39; Hawaii to <br/>
Elvis and Elvis to Beatles but I couldn&#39;t quite figure the Spam-Hawaii <br/>
connection (Spam and pineapple?). And of course the Beatles comes back <br/>
full circle to the UK connection with Monty Python.<br/>

And also Spam as substitute/equivalent of tofu in suchlike dishes, and it&#39;s <br/>
apparently been going on for sixty years or so.   Little cubes of spam in all <br/>
kinds of local and Asian dishes.   And it DOES go nicely with pineapple.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327058939">Might have to get some SPAM in the near future just so we can have <br/>
Spam and eggs while watching Monty Python which DS has taken an <br/>
interest in lately. A lot of the strictly British humor has gone <br/>
flying past but much of the visual humor tickles his funny bone. Had <br/>
to explain what a blancmange was for him - even tracked down a recipe <br/>
so we can try to make it sometime. I can be pretty sure that when we <br/>
get to the Spam sketch (we&#39;ve been watching the video collection plus <br/>
DH and DS will often tune in during the day when BBC America <br/>
broadcasts episodes). Last night we mentioned to MIL that DS likes <br/>
Monty Python and he stuck out his arms and zoomed by saying &quot;Flying <br/>
Circus&quot;...then he came back around and asked how a circus could fly.<br/>

This is so much FUN!<br/>
