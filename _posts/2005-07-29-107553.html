<div id="ygrps-yiv-1741734799">OK OK I&#39;m not the person who posted this question but I&#39;d love to hear more<br/>
responses.  Angela&#39;s scratches the surface but, my goodness: If asking<br/>
nicely and appealing to her empathy got me anywhere with my dd I&#39;d be<br/>
thrilled.  Most of the time if she&#39;s in a mood to irritate others a<br/>
conversation won&#39;t get her back to peace or convince her to stop.  She is<br/>
feeling irritated and wishes everyone (not just me) to share her mood.  And<br/>
while we&#39;re at it.  What would you do with the child who asks to be held<br/>
then flops down on the floor with a loud &quot;you hurt me!&quot;  or lets all muscles<br/>
go slack and &quot;falls&quot; off my lap saying &quot;you threw me on the floor!&quot;  She<br/>
does this when she&#39;s tired even when she has all my attention.  This stuff<br/>
isn&#39;t constant but often enough that I would like to address it so they can<br/>
find peace and happiness instead of the misery they seem to want to wallow<br/>
in from time to time.<br/>

his brother, esp. if he is just doing it to be irritating.  If he did not<br/>
want to stop, I would ask him how he would like it if someone were doing the<br/>
same thing to him.  I always try to get my kids to think of how the other<br/>
kid would feel in the same circumstances.  It&#39;s been rare when my kids have<br/>
done something just to irritate the other.  It&#39;s only happened when the<br/>
irritating kid feels like she hasn&#39;t been listened to and heard.  If I<br/>
listen to her and validate her feelings then she doesn&#39;t feel the need to be<br/>
mean.  <br/>

Do you ask if feeling bad is more comfortable than feeling good?<br/>
<br/>
When Holly is whimpery and whiney, I help her brainstorm about what would <br/>
feel better. <br/>
<br/>
Last night she said she was hungry.   After a particularly long list of ideas <br/>
and suggestions and offers, she decided what she really wanted was a cold <br/>
bottle of water out of the fridge.   Sometimes it&#39;s something simpler than you <br/>
had imagined.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a kid who wants to be held but wants to fall would like a bubble bath.  <br/>
 It&#39;s bodily stimulation AND a nice flop.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Really?<br/>
If the child is frustrated and cranky, probably she&#39;s sleepy.<br/>
If she&#39;s being abusive to others who are trying to be nice to her, maybe her <br/>
being asleep will be best for the future of relationships.   <br/>
<br/>
If my neighbor comes over and is being horrible and I say &quot;go home&quot; is that a <br/>
punishment?   He&#39;s got a home, and he needs not to be in my home.<br/>
<br/>
If a child is being entirely oppositional because she is unable (probably <br/>
from being tired) to be courteous anymore, then she needs to clock out until she <br/>
can be nicer.   If the mom tried holding her and she complained, then she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want the mom, she wants something she doesn&#39;t identify.   <br/>
<br/>
Sleep is healing and soothing and sometimes there are better things to do <br/>
than sleep, but if the child can&#39;t think of one and is disturbing the peace of <br/>
the family, then sleep might be the best possible thing.<br/>
<br/>
When one of my kids is having the combination headache and short-tempered <br/>
meltdown that inspires me to say, &quot;When&#39;s the last time you ate?&quot; and then I find <br/>
the only thing he&#39;s had for twelve hours is a bowl of ramen or some cheerios, <br/>
if I say &quot;Eat some protein,&quot; does that sound like a punishment?<br/>
<br/>
In either case, I would probably offer to make the protein meal, or turn down <br/>
the bed and fluff the pillow and turn on favorite music.<br/>
<br/>
Eating and sleeping happen daily or more, and it&#39;s not a punishment to <br/>
suggest that someone is overdue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-255263690">** Maybe a kid who wants to be held but wants to fall would like a <br/>
bubble bath.  It&#39;s bodily stimulation AND a nice flop.**<br/>
<br/>
Bodily stimulation could be a key idea here.<br/>
<br/>
Someone in the past has posted really insightful stuff about kids whose <br/>
body stimulation needs are so intense that they literally bounce into <br/>
walls. (Please feel free to repost.) Physical outlets are very <br/>
important, and sometimes a child&#39;s need for excercise or touch can be so <br/>
extreme that it&#39;s hard for a mom to understand.  I was just reading the <br/>
beginning of The Five Love Languages of Children and it talks about <br/>
wrestling as a form of touching that is pleasurable to many kids.  (Not <br/>
a kind of touch that I personally enjoy.)<br/>
<br/>
When kids are cranky a lot one thing to consider is some kind of food <br/>
allergy or sensitivity.  Or, as Sandra points out, the need to consume <br/>
protein more frequently.  (Donuts and pancake syrup both make me feel <br/>
terrible, so this makes visceral sense to me.)<br/>

<br/>
Maybe some kind of non-verbal outlet for being miserable (for the<br/>
littlest one), if a verbal outlet isn&#39;t satisfactory?  Hitting<br/>
pillows?  Howling?  Jumping around like a gorilla or like a monster in<br/>
Where the Wild Things Are?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s natural for moms to want kids to be happy, but some moms really<br/>
go overboard in trying to smother unhappiness with distraction or<br/>
cookies.  When that is the case, then validating the feeling and<br/>
getting it out may be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t know where the unhappiness is coming from, and I<br/>
understand that it must be disappointing to see so much of it.<br/>
