<div id="ygrps-yiv-314375536">I am extremely curious about the different ways each<br/>
of you &quot;record&quot; and keep track of your child&#39;s<br/>
progress, especially those of you who live in states<br/>
with extremely &quot;strict&quot; hs laws.  All states and/or<br/>
school districts hold us accountable in one form or<br/>
another.  Unschoolers have to be creative in their<br/>
record keeping since the curriculum is child directed.<br/>
 I would love to hear how you go about &quot;charting&quot; your<br/>
child&#39;s progress and what you show to your school<br/>
districts (if it is required of you.)<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Caroline<br/>

compared his progress to that. I have since thrown that list away.  <br/>

have a private school option and private schools can operate without <br/>
informing anyone. I am keeping my fingers crossed that nothing changes.<br/>

does, and break all that down into educationese. <br/>

<br/>
No they don&#39;t.  Some do, most don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Even kids in school (if you have ever seen a &quot;permanent record&quot;) have VERY <br/>
few records kept on them, even during the schoolyear.<br/>
<br/>
The grade books secondary school teachers keep have a space about 1/3 of an <br/>
inch high and seven or eight inches wide for a six- or nine-week session, and <br/>
it will have attendance and a few grades, and at the end of the session the <br/>
grades are averaged and one grade put at the end.  <br/>
<br/>
SOME teachers also have a folder on each student, or they tell the students <br/>
to keep one.  Those aren&#39;t kept after the end of the year.<br/>
<br/>
The teachers will also have a lesson plan book, and so theoretically that&#39;s <br/>
the information each child was exposed to, and the grade in the book <br/>
supposedly reflects the percentage of that material that the child understood <br/>
well enough to pass a test, or the amount (approximately) of homework the <br/>
child successfully completed, or some combination of those two and <br/>
cooperation and participation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known very few teachers (only the most boring and chapter-assigning) <br/>
whose lesson plans were an accurate reflection of what happened in the class. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
And that is the plan for assembly line education, in which the teacher has <br/>
140 kids in five sessions, single prep repeated five times if the teacher&#39;s <br/>
lucky.  We&#39;re not doing assembly line teaching, and so we can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
expected to predict what the child is going to learn or do.  <br/>
<br/>
For elementary, there&#39;s not much more record keeping than that either.<br/>
It LOOKS recorded--assignments on the wall, and summary sheets.  But if you <br/>
were to go to a school and look at a high school child&#39;s permanent record, it <br/>
wil have shots, disciplinary notes, term grades, maybe a brief comment from a <br/>
teacher once in a while, standardized test scores (5th grade and 8th, maybe), <br/>
and that&#39;s about it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540573035"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font SIZE="2">We hosted an exchange student for a short time pre-homeschooling days. 
<br>After he went back to Germany, his parents tried to sue the organization, 
<br>saying they didn&#39;t give enough support. Well, this kid was horrible!!! I 
<br>called the school, spoke with the principal (her son and I went to school 
<br>together, so she knew me and told me things &quot;off record&quot;) and found out the 
<br>&quot;Permanent Record&quot; is destroyed at the end of the year. They keep attendance 
<br>records ... and that&#39;s about it. Even discipline records are destroyed. She 
<br>said they just don&#39;t have the room to keep everything, and no one really 
<br>looks at it, anyway. (I was the first person to EVER request someone&#39;s record 
<br>... from a school where 94% go to college.)
<br>Kind of funny (sad) that homeschoolers in some states are held to a different 
<br>standard than the government run public schools...

<div><font size="4">it took me a while to figure this one out. I spent many wasted 
hours preparing lesson plans we always ended up deviating from and keeping 
detalied grade and attendance records. Where we live, all the county school 
board requires is attendance and the tests required in fifth seventh and ninth 
grades until high school. </font></div>
