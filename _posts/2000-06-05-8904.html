<div id="ygrps-yiv-78086120">Hello! This is my first day of being on this unschooling e-mail list. I&#39;m<br/>
not familiar with e-mail lists and I know I&#39;m behind on discussions, but I<br/>
have received 14 e-mails today and none of them were related to<br/>
unschooling. Is that a typical day? I can talk about other stuff with all<br/>
the people I see in person, but I can&#39;t talk about unschooling with them. <br/>
I&#39;d love to hear what your children are doing and learning so I might not<br/>
feel all alone in this lifestyle and so that I might get some new ideas and<br/>
perspectives--especially from those of you with young children. Mine are 5,<br/>

<br/>
The problem with unschooling is that it is basically not doing <br/>
something; i.e. not schooling, so it is very difficult to spend a lot of <br/>
time talking about what we are not doing.   However to me <br/>
unschooling is more of a lifestyle than a method of education, so <br/>
this makes any topic at all relevant to an unschooling mailing list, <br/>
and pertenant to unschooling itself.<br/>
<br/>
For example my children follow no curriculum & have no <br/>
worksheets, they do nothing purely for the purpose of learning, but <br/>
after saying that I must add that nearly all of what they do <br/>
encourages and fosters learning.   Home is a 175 acre farm, with a <br/>
600&#39; hill, a valley with two trout stream, ponds, animals etc.  They <br/>
have a microscope, many books, pencils, paper, computers with <br/>
all kinds of programes and they have responsibilities.   Right now <br/>
my 11 year old daughter has gone to Chicago with a family who <br/>
visited the farm two weekends ago, their daughter ended up staying <br/>
here last week and when her Mother came back to get her Rhianon <br/>
went with them.  This is amazing to me considering that I only met <br/>
these people 11 days ago, but we meet some really great people <br/>
and strong friendships are sometimes formed.    Anyway where I <br/>
was heading was to say that with Rhianon away, Madeleine [6] has <br/>
to take the responsibility of milking the goat, Stephanie [4] is <br/>
helping her and they collect the eggs from the chicken coop <br/>
without being remended.  Milking the goat was Rhianon&#39;s descision <br/>
as she wanted to bottle feed some kids, so I told ehr that to bottle <br/>
feed kids she would have to milk a goat so they could be reared on <br/>
fresh goat milk, she took this responsibility on the first day of <br/>
February and until she went away yesterday has only missed one <br/>
milking when she was sick one day.  Nathan [15] bottle rears three <br/>
dairy calves at a time and takes care of most of the feeding of the <br/>
animals, he can drive a truck, tractor, van and is just getting the <br/>
hang of a 4 wheel drive pick-up that we bought from auction a few <br/>
weeks ago.<br/>
<br/>
Some days are too long for all of us and the children all help out <br/>
with whatever tasks they are capable of, mostly for the girls that <br/>
involves care of the chickens and chicks, assisting with candling <br/>
eggs and checking the incubators [I&#39;m guessing that we have at <br/>
least 1000 chicks that we have hatched this year].  We have 4 <br/>
cows, 5 heifers, 3 bulls, 12 steers, a boar, 2 sows, a ram, 24 <br/>
ewes, 26 lambs, a buck, 8 does, 8 kids, 6 turkeys, 6 domestic <br/>
geese, 5 Canada geese and their 9 goslings, 4 ducks and 23 <br/>
ducklings that we have incubated with 10 more due to hatch today <br/>
[along with about 230 chicks] and of course about 200 chickens & <br/>
at least 1000 chicks with around 200 more every six days.  So for <br/>
my children between the wild creatures living here and the farm <br/>
animals biology lessons take care of themselves(-;<br/>
<br/>
When the daily tasks are done the kids have the freedom to do <br/>
what they want with their time, Nathan spends a fair bit of time at <br/>
the computer on web design or designing cars for GTA, the girls <br/>
watch about 1 hour of television but prefer to spend time writing, <br/>
drawing playing legos, playing in the sandbox or out exploring.  I <br/>
am not actively teaching Maddi [6] and Steph [4] how to read, the <br/>
only reading lessons they get is having people read to them and <br/>
giving answers when asked what a word says or how to spell <br/>
something.  I am not activelty teaching math, day to day life and <br/>
expenses does that, for more advanced math if the need for it <br/>
arises such as for Nathan with work on the computer answers are <br/>
found by asking or researching.   My children who were in school <br/>
[Rhianon for 1 1/2 years and Nathan 6 years] have regained their <br/>
love of learning that school all but destroyed with it&#39;s mind <br/>
numbingly boring games, Madeleine and Stephanie will never have <br/>
to endure the hours of sitting at a desk being force fed <br/>
unnecessary information [which is mostly forgotten anyway] just to <br/>
pass some stupid test, they are free to learn at their own pace, if <br/>
they don&#39;t read fluently &#39;til they are 12 it won&#39;t matter in fact it may <br/>
be good for them as once we become literate the world changes, <br/>
yes it can be for the better as we are then able to find all the <br/>
information we need in books or on the &#39;net, but by having the <br/>
ability to find what we need from books it partly kills off the <br/>
scientist [who has to find his/her own answers] that is inate in all <br/>
new-born babies.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if a few others on the list describe their lives it may help out <br/>
any newbies who are looking for answers, we were all there once.<br/>
