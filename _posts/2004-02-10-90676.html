<div id="ygrps-yiv-785595659">Well,<br/>
we borrowed (from the library of course) the Frontier House series this <br/>
weekend are are half way done watching it...it&#39;s really good!<br/>
While there we also picked up a National Geo video about a pair of volcano <br/>
scientists...my son 3 1/2 has watched it 5 times so far I think & is now <br/>
continually telling me all about it...<br/>
he might have &quot;just&quot; been sitting and watching TV (well actually he was <br/>
jumping on the trampoline & hanging upside down off the couch while watching), but <br/>
although he hasn&#39;t been to a real volcano, I&#39;d say he still learned QUITE a <br/>
bit about volcanos and volcanologists!<br/>
Now he&#39;s watching the Bernstein Bears camping trrip, another topic he loves <br/>
(camping).  Although it does bother me sometimes when he just wants to watch <br/>
TV, I do agree that he often learns alot from it.<br/>
Next time we stop at the library we are going to get some of the Cosmos <br/>
series by Carl Sagan as he&#39;s been asking about space and meteors alot lately!<br/>
