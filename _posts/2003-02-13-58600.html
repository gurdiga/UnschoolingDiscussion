I wanted to write here again to let those interested know that I have <br/>

children) at three conferences:  in Connecticut, Maryland and South <br/>
Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
If you are in or near any of those states, and are interested in <br/>
conference details, let me know.<br/>
<br/>
I invest my computer time at the message boards at unschooling.com.  <br/>
So if anyone would like to pop over there and read the special needs <br/>
folders, we always have wonderful conversations going on.  Right now <br/>
there&#39;s a great conversation in progress about Indigo Children.  <br/>
<br/>
Be Well ~<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523214965">I would be very interested in your Maryland conference? (Would it happen to be at the MHEA Conference in Annapolis, Maryland on the 5th of April?  We&#39;re already registered for this conference, and a good friend of mine is one of the speakers)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the mom of the autistic son.  He&#39;ll be 9 in May and we&#39;re using only a math curriculum with him, but your email really gave me food for thought as to whether we even need to do that with him.  (I don&#39;t use any curriculum with my almost 12 year old daughter).<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for any help you can offer!!<br/>

<br/>
God, I hope not!!  I&#39;m not ready!!  I think it&#39;s in June.<br/>
<br/>
If you e-mail me, I&#39;ll send you the info as soon as I have it.<br/>
<br/>
The important thing to remember about unschooling math is that it&#39;s <br/>
not doing nothing.  Sometimes it&#39;s thinking out loud, talking out <br/>
loud, figuring out answsers yourself out loud.  It&#39;s conversations <br/>
about patterns, numbers.  It&#39;s doing puzzles, computer games, <br/>
blocks.  It&#39;s weighing produce at the grocery store and calculating <br/>
the cost.  It&#39;s saving for something you love, figuring tax, also.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll always remember when my son came to me and told me he had thirty-<br/>
some dollars and some cents.  I went into his room and looked at his <br/>
bed...he had piles of coins all over it.  I never sat down with him <br/>
and told him the value of the coins.  He learned from using them.  He <br/>
learned from gumball machines (well, they&#39;re not gumballs anymore, <br/>
and they&#39;re not a penny anymore either!)!  He learned from using.  <br/>
From living.  And he poured out his bank and counted all his coins <br/>
because he wanted to know if he had enough money for something he <br/>
wanted to buy. <br/>
<br/>
Think of unschooling math in those terms, and compare that in your <br/>
mind to schooling math.  Which would REALLY inspire true learning in <br/>
your child?  Sitting down to a worksheet with numbers?  Or real life <br/>
situations where the child has a need and desire to find an <br/>
answer...usually associated with something joyful.<br/>
