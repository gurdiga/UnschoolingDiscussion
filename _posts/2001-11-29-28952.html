<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267363661">I guess it just struck me today that a lot of what I am hearing here and<br/>
elsewhere sounds like parroting of certain catch phrases from prominant<br/>
books.  It bugged me a bit.  I&#39;d much rather hear about how things<br/>
applied to your specific situation, which things works and which didn&#39;t<br/>
and why they did or didn&#39;t.  But instead, it seems that anytime anyone<br/>
posts something even a little bit critical about any aspect of certain<br/>
concepts, they are pounced on in a big way.<br/>
Am I making sense?<br/>

Hi Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
Would you like to know how my family is unschooling/homeschooling? Some <br/>
specific things I did that worked for us?  How my husband and I had to <br/>
compromise on certain things,  and also, how, we have managed to <br/>
incorporate a very strict and controlling eating schedule into our <br/>
&quot;almost totally unschooling&quot; lifestyle?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would love to hear that last part!  We have an exchange student this<br/>
year and for his sake we tried to keep a normal eating pattern but it is<br/>
already breaking down.  It just is not in our nature to eat at the same<br/>
times.  Vaidas (the exchange student) seems to be taking it in stride but<br/>
I can tell he is used to regular meals.<br/>
