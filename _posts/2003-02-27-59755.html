<div id="ygrps-yiv-285758086">Hi, I have been a member of the site for awhile, just setting back <br/>
and reading.  I am a homeschooling mom of three boys 15,12,8.  I have <br/>
enjoyed reading about reading and the different views of <br/>
homeschooling vs unschooling and the various definitions of each.  I <br/>
hazard to label us, each of my sons does it different and I try to <br/>
work with each of them in their own way.  We do buy some curriculum, <br/>
but I didnt choose it, the boys did.  They had a homeschooling friend <br/>
that used ACE Paces (at the time we were unschooling)and they wanted <br/>
to try it.  So I ordered it, just a couple of paces of each subject <br/>
and they used it.  I just left them alone.  When they were finished, <br/>
they went back to just reading and living but after awhile my middle <br/>
son asked me to teach him to multiply and divide fractions.  I went <br/>
through it with him and he said he would rather just get the Pace for <br/>
it and do it that way.  We called them up and wallah!!!  he was <br/>
working on fractions.  We have continued along that path.  We do have <br/>
curriculum laying all over our house, but each of those is something <br/>
one of the boys have found. Some days they pick up something and use <br/>
it, some days they dont.  They all ask their friends what they are <br/>
working on in school and try to make sure they know it better.  This <br/>
is all of their own free will.  I have to say that still for my <br/>
younger two the day is made up mostly of playing.  They still play <br/>
war (both are Warcraft nuts) and explore outside ect.  I cant imagine <br/>
our life any other way.  I work at home, I have a small hair salon in <br/>
my basement and the boys enjoy coming down and visiting with my <br/>
customers or helping clean the tanning bed, make change or sweep <br/>
hair.  We live in a very anti homeschool community though, and we <br/>
have been labled for our &quot;different&quot; lifestyle.  Recently our public <br/>
school refused to allow my son to go to a dance with a friend, they <br/>
have now decided to close all activities to allow only children <br/>
enrolled in the district,even if they are invited and signed in <br/>
before.  This is now adding stress to our way of doing things.The <br/>
boys have never minded the questions or the lable for that matter, <br/>
but they are at the age that they want to do these things and I dont <br/>
know how to supplement or fix the problem.  I have to say that none <br/>
of my children have ever caused any problems in any way.  They have <br/>
great times with their friends at karate, youth group, ball games <br/>
ect.  Most adults comment about how well behaved they are and how <br/>
self assured they seem.  I just wonder does anyone have any feedback <br/>
on these situations?  Isnt this in some way descriminating against my <br/>
kids due to an educational choice that is perfectly legal in our <br/>
state?  It just kills me to see how hurt they are?  Any ideas?<br/>

First of all I think that&#39;s awful. Second of all, I would do whatever I <br/>
could to get your children doing what they would like without having <br/>
anything to do with the school system. Do they want to hang out with kids <br/>
and have a dance or picnic or party? Invite the kids to your house or plan a <br/>
day at a park or beach or bowling alley, etc. I&#39;m sure there are many ways <br/>
for your kids to get together with their friends without doing it on school <br/>
grounds.<br/>
