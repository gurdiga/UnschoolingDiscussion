<div id="ygrps-yiv-1401254264">In a message dated 00-09-28 07:38:20 EDT, you write:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My kids have been telling people that they do<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;  nothing for school.  You can guess the reaction by all to that!!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote> Funny, I remember that being my standard answer everyday of my 12 years of<br/>
 ps. I also think it is the standard answer of lots of kids that go to<br/>
 school. I don&#39;t know why it bothers people more to hear ir from<br/>
 homeschoolers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is SO TRUE!!!<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s just fine for kids at school to report to strangers in stores that <br/>
they don&#39;t like school, they don&#39;t like their teachers, and that gets them <br/>
some sympathy and a kind smile.  Conformity and not rocking leaky boats, I <br/>
guess...<br/>
