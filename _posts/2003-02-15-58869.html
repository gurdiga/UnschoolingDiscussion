&lt;&lt; Next pass through the area, I bring a hairbrush and desired &quot;trimmings&quot;.  <br/>
Next pass, I&#39;ll bring shoes and socks.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My 15 yo ds is very absent-minded, and also very intense so he&#39;ll get into <br/>
reading, making things, watching birds, etc., in the morning.  I have a 4 yo <br/>
ds that I&#39;m helping get ready - so I just call reminders down the hall to my <br/>
15 yo&#39;s room while I&#39;m helping the 4 yo.  The older one also doesn&#39;t care for <br/>
pajamas - so he takes a shower in the evening and puts on his clothes for the <br/>
next day - leaving us one less hurdle &lt;g&gt;.  He also will put whatever he <br/>
needs to bring in the car, either the night before or after breakfast (he <br/>
thought that one up).<br/>
<br/>
Having, possibly, just a few more years before he&#39;s out on his own, though, <br/>
I&#39;m worrying about it less.  The flip side of his being so focused on what <br/>
he&#39;s doing, rather than other things going on or coming up, is that he&#39;s very <br/>
enjoyable to do things with because he *is* focused very much in the moment.  <br/>
We were at a botanical garden on Tuesday (he wanted to go there for his <br/>
birthday), and, while I thought there wouldn&#39;t be much going on there, he <br/>
pointed out *so* many birds (and knew them all too), and he even found a <br/>
chipmunk (which I&#39;ve never seen before there). He&#39;s incredibly observant - <br/>
and enjoys everything so much.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, my 11 yo dd will be up, dressed, have all her stuff together and be <br/>
waiting in her jacket out in the car 10 minutes before we have to leave.  I <br/>
rarely have to remind her of anything - but that&#39;s because she&#39;s *so* worried <br/>
about being late or missing something.  We&#39;re trying to help her be a little <br/>
more relaxed &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

to appreciate that in him.  I guess we don&#39;t really need to be on time to <br/>
everything.<br/>
