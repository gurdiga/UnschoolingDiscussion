&gt; opera singer, with a master&#39;s degree no less.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ROFL...Makes me think &quot;DUH!&quot;  I know that for sure, but I swear its taken so <br/>
very long for my girl to understand multiplication and master the table. <br/>
Mastering the multiplication table is something I just &quot;have&quot;&#39; in my head. I <br/>
can multiply anything (within about 3 digits I think =)  Fractions, however, <br/>
were understood in days by my girl.  Each child being so different means that <br/>
there has to be the freedom of time, different approaches to &quot;getting it&quot; and <br/>
opportunities to see it in many ways (i.e. pie pieces, money, etc. for <br/>
fractions.) Multiplication is harder thought. <br/>
I think that&#39;s where I most definitely am outside the unschool method as I <br/>
understand it. I want her to learn multiplication facts, the table of <br/>
factors. She&#39;s finally got it, but its not her personal strength.  That&#39;s <br/>
okay...we aren&#39;t drill sergeants here making sure she can recite them on cue <br/>
=p<br/>
I must say this though: it was public schools (last year) that really screwed <br/>
her up in this area! They spent four or five sessions on multiplication <br/>
during the year and if you didn&#39;t get it then that&#39;s just too bad. Why the <br/>
heck they kept jumping around back and forth I will never understand. They <br/>
did it just in time so that whatever she may have learned/remembered was gone <br/>
by the time they went back to it. This was one of the reasons for h/s (among <br/>
soooooooo many =)  I do LOVE it.<br/>
Here in AZ they do this third grade AIMS standardized testing.  She <br/>
participated (we are in fourth grade and doing first year of h/s.)  She <br/>
scored in the post-high-school range of language and writing, however, she <br/>
was in the second grade level of math - and they were putting her into the <br/>
fourth grade.  How many of us remember or know others that didn&#39;t get it in <br/>
math and hated it forevermore? Blech.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Could be she hasn&#39;t had a need for speed in recalling them yet.  I know a <br/>
young man who recently graduated from university in math and computer <br/>
science.  He was unschooled through high school.  I asked him a couple of <br/>
years ago whether he had memorized the multiplication tables.  He said he <br/>
hadn&#39;t, but he could figure them out faster than most people are able to <br/>
recall them.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if trying to get her to master the tables has held up her actual <br/>
*understanding* of them.  In other words, if you don&#39;t understand what <br/>
multiplication actually is, adding the same number x number of times, then <br/>
it&#39;s going to be awfully hard to remember them.<br/>

was always way behind.  But if I had been able to get it at my own <br/>
speed?  Who knows what I might have done.  I&#39;ve always been good with logic <br/>
stuff.  It was the numbers that got to me.<br/>
<br/>
About testing at different grade levels . . . I went through the BC <br/>
learning outcomes one year for the report I had to send for my son.  I had <br/>
stuff marked off in various subjects from kindergarten to grade 8 <br/>
level.  He was all over the map.  Still is.  &lt;g&gt;  I asked the online <br/>
teacher how many kids in the average grade 4 classroom would be at the <br/>
&quot;correct&quot; grade level in every subject.  His answer was none.  Kids just <br/>
don&#39;t learn things at the same rate.<br/>
