<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717965284">I don&#39;t know much about them, but I know there are <br/>
homeopathic/holistic veterinarians who do not believe in vaccinating <br/>
pets. <br/>
<br/>
If I believed that animals and humans are equal in importance &lt;g&gt;, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t vaccinate my pets.  I don&#39;t vaccinate my kids anymore because <br/>
I believe that the risks of vaccinations are generally greater than <br/>
the benefits.  However, I do vaccinate my pets because even though I <br/>
realize there are risks, I am willing to take the chance of those <br/>
risks with an animal if it means potentially protecting a human from <br/>
rabies or even just protecting myself from a socialistic law. <br/>
