<div id="ygrps-yiv-837322010">I finally got my hubby to believe in unschooling. He<br/>
actually sat down with us tonight and played the<br/>
junior who wants to be a millionaire. And it was<br/>
great. He actually looked at me and said. Wow you<br/>
really are teaching these guys something the way your<br/>
teaching. I felt so good. Because he was wanting to<br/>
send the kids back to public school because he didn&#39;t<br/>
think they were learning anything. Im sorry guys but<br/>
that felt so great. comming from someone who faught me<br/>
on homeschooling my kids. He even agreed to play more<br/>
games with the kids.. yeppy. Does anyone have any<br/>
suggestions on what else we could do with hubby at<br/>
night with the kids. I pretty much do everything with<br/>
them. <br/>
But i am wanting him to be a part of it also. please<br/>
any suggestions would be grateful. thankyou all.<br/>
<br/>
God Bless You<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-17616473">Are you looking for more games to play? Or other activities, in <br/>
addition to games? How old are the kids? What are DH&#39;s interests as <br/>
well? A good way to sustain things is if there are things he is <br/>
interested in that he is passing along/sharing with the kids. So, if <br/>
he loves dominoes, get a nice double 12 set if you don&#39;t already <br/>
have one and play Mexican train or hand and foot or whatever. If <br/>
he&#39;s a card player, cribbage and canasta are all about number <br/>
patterns. Gardening? Old movies? Photography? Wood carving? <br/>
<br/>
Gamewise there are tons of cool games out - best picks are things <br/>
that have lots of open ended discussion possibilities - trivial <br/>
pursuit (there&#39;s a cool version for the playstation - there are 3 <br/>
variations and one goes very quickly if the length of the game is an <br/>
issue with the kids); Apples to Apples; and there&#39;s a Dr Seuss game <br/>
that is all about making rhymes - you land on a space and have to <br/>
pick from one of two piles - rhymes or poems. The rhymes pile says <br/>
things like &quot;4 words that rhyme with pig&quot; or have a few lines of <br/>
something from a Seuss book with several words/a phrase underlined <br/>
and you have to make up a new phrase that rhymes to substitute. Poem <br/>
says &quot;make a poem about clouds&quot; or &quot;make a poem using the word blue&quot; <br/>
or whatever. Lots of fun - we usually ignore the board game part and <br/>
just flips through cards at random. It&#39;s usually a pretty silly, <br/>
giggly time.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198278579">Apples to Apples is wonderful.<br/>
 <br/>
If you can find a copy of Encore (it&#39;s been reprinted recently) and if your  <br/>
family sings at all (meaning likes songs and can carry a tune and thinks <br/>
that&#39;s  fun), this game would be good.<br/>
 <br/>
Five Crowns (there&#39;s a website called setgames.com or some such) is pretty  <br/>
and fun.  Costs $10 or $12, but we&#39;ve worn out two decks and are on  our third. <br/>
 When we have guests who&#39;ve played it before, they want to play  it again <br/>
when they come over.<br/>
 <br/>
I have some games comments and ideas for things to do here:<br/>

 <br/>
Battleship is a favorite of dads, and is straight-up deductive reasoning  <br/>
(don&#39;t tell the kids) and math (not with numbers, so it&#39;s a good way for parents  <br/>
who didn&#39;t know not all math was numbers to start to see that, and I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
 talk to the kids about that either, just play it with them).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-570669443">Hi Thanks for the comments.The only DH likes is war<br/>
games on the computer. So times i can&#39;t get him off of<br/>
it until he has to go to bed. That is why i was so<br/>
excited. As far as games and stuff im open for any<br/>
suggestion. We are getting ready to make a garden but<br/>
he will end up leaving that for me to do. He likes<br/>
fishing and hunting. I really don&#39;t know much about<br/>
either. That is pretty much what he likes to do. Have<br/>
any suggestions. It really don&#39;t matter just as long<br/>
as I can get him involved. Its like pulling teeth for<br/>
him to go out and play ball or anything with them. My<br/>
kids are 15/14/13 girl and two boys. Please any<br/>
suggestions are wonderful. He does like being outside.<br/>
So if you guys can think of anything that we can do<br/>
outside would be great. He did show the kids how to<br/>
till the garden tonight. And explained where you<br/>
should plant the plants that we grew. <br/>
<br/>
God Bless You<br/>

they would be interested in pursuing, there&#39;s a whole science <br/>
curriculum just begging to be explored!  They could learn about <br/>
ecosystems, biology, the art of tying flies; there&#39;s tons of physics <br/>
involved in fly fishing, and for a literature tie-in, they could read <br/>
or watch the movie version of &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot; -- there are so <br/>
many possibilities.  And, how cool for them to relate to your dh in an <br/>
environment he loves and (I&#39;m assuming) would be enthusiastic about <br/>
sharing with them!  Even if they didn&#39;t want to participate in the <br/>
actual hunting, they could go with him to just spot animals, to look <br/>
for likely spots, etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950779549">If dh likes being outside, how about a hike / scavenger hunt.  You could make up a list of things to find on your hike (certain trees, ferns, wildlife, etc. native to your community) and then go for it.  I&#39;ve done this with my dd (almost 3) and she&#39;s had a great time.  Obviously, your kids are older, so you can look for more advanced things than rocks, flowers and sticks :o)  Try orienteering, using a compass and map.<br/>
<br/>
Why not take the kids fishing?  Does he go out on a boat, canoe or fly fish?  This would be a great way to expose the kids to something he enjoys, and they might become interested in it too.  Why not rent a canoe(s) (if you don&#39;t have one) and take a trip on a local lake (if that&#39;s feasible).  Paddling is wonderfully relaxing, and a great way to take in the local flora and fawna.  You could make a day of it, with a picnic on the shore.  You could take some lovely pictures, journal, etc.<br/>
<br/>
What about a trip to a local organic farm?  If dh knows a bit about gardening (but perhaps doesn&#39;t like the work) learning about agriculture in your community might be of interest to him.  Or even a nursery, where flowers, shrubs, etc. are grown from seed.  It might be a neat trip for everyone to learn the best types of plantlife to grow in your area.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure I could think of more,  but my dd wants milk ...  better go.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 <br/>
How do your kids feel about fishing and hunting?  If it&#39;s something  <br/>
they would be interested in pursuing, there&#39;s a whole science <br/>
curriculum  just begging to be explored! <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
That whole response sounded great before and after that &quot;science  curriculum&quot; <br/>
thing.<br/>
 <br/>
Any interest is a portal to the entire rest of the world.  One of the  first <br/>
books published in English in England was about fly fishing, I  think.  There <br/>
are songs about fishing, there are myths and Bible stories  and traditional <br/>
stories.  There is Japanese art, there are electronic  motion-activated singing <br/>
fish to mount on walls, there&#39;s the history of boats  and there&#39;s cooking!    <br/>
Some of that was getting into net-fishing  (the apostles style of fishing) and <br/>
with that you get a WHOLE lot of lore and  more songs, and with nets you get <br/>
macrame and with boats you get other important  knot-tying and rope <br/>
construction.  From boats you can go to non-fishing  boats, which leads to all commerce, <br/>
exploration and naval battle.<br/>
 <br/>
It can be the McElligott&#39;s Pool of Unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cool idea. From one web site I found--how to organize it, regulate it <br/>
and otherwise make it less fun:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For children as young as toddlers there is a special orienteering <br/>
course called the string course. The entire route is marked from <br/>
start to finish, so no one gets lost. A simple map shows the route <br/>
and the location of the markers, called controls. As children become <br/>
ready, they can learn about maps, map symbols, direction, figuring <br/>
out where they are, and so forth, all while on a well marked course <br/>
they can follow themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Geez, my little ones know about following maps from watching Dora! <br/>
They make their own maps and tell me where they are going...Strangely <br/>
enough, I don&#39;t feel the need to make it structured and competative...<br/>

 <br/>
Orienteering is generally competitive, though.  Someone sets out a  course <br/>
and the players see who can get to all the points, first.  It&#39;s a  fitness thing <br/>
for some people, as well.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, it can be done just for fun without the need for speed.  In  the <br/>
Army we did it to learn land navigation, but each team had a different route  <br/>
to the same points, which would simulate real-life troop movement  situations.  <br/>
My son in Iraq has GPS, though, which makes it much easier to  find his way <br/>
around Baghdad!  They still have to know who to navigate with  a compass, <br/>
though.<br/>
