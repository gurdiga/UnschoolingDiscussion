<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579603819">It was hot in Montana today.  We get hot here but not humid so mostly<br/>
folks can stand it.  We stand it by playing in the pool.  *The pool* is a<br/>
ten foot inflatable rim, 36&quot; deep vinyl kids pool, but oh, is it lovely<br/>
in the heat.<br/>
<br/>
However fun they are vinyl pools need to be cleaned sometimes and today<br/>
it just wasn&#39;t going to wait anymore.  So I drained it and floundered<br/>
around in there scrubbing and being hot and thinking almost anything<br/>
would be better than what I was doing.  It was an all day thing,<br/>
draining, cleaning and refilling and then mowing the lawn and what not.<br/>
  <br/>
But when I came in Dylan had made ice cream.  Not ice cream really, non<br/>
dairy frozen desert.  Last week or so we borrowed my moms old, (really<br/>
old) ice cream maker.  It&#39;s the &quot;Dolly Madison Home Ice Cream Freezer&quot;,<br/>
and says *HUSKY* on the label, and my mom got it  when my brother was<br/>
little, about fifty four years ago.  We made a batch the first day and it<br/>
was fun, but we hadn&#39;t tried it again.  <br/>
While I was squishing around in the pool he was secretly picking<br/>
strawberries, and cracking ice and measuring soy milk and sugar and<br/>
vanilla and making me the happiest mom in Deer Lodge, Montana.  Yessiree.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll remember forever how good it tasted and how pleased he looked and<br/>
how lucky I felt. How it felt to sit in our little kitchen and look out<br/>
into the back yard, with the grass freshly cut and the bright blue pool<br/>
filling up with water and see Dylan&#39;s happy face across the table.   And<br/>
I won&#39;t be grumpy next time I have to clean the pool either, because<br/>
however yucky the pool is, the kid who likes the pool is awesome. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
