home to go smoothly?<br/>
<br/>
Or do you want transaction to mean the whole unschooling thing?<br/>
<br/>
Is he having problems at school? What are his feelings about coming home?<br/>
How old is he?<br/>
<br/>
He needs to feel that the things he likes about school, like friends and<br/>
sports, are still available to him. So it&#39;s helpful to have get togethers<br/>
with friends already set up when you pull him out so he sees the connections<br/>
with friends are still in place.<br/>
<br/>
Do things with him. Go places. But give him time to veg too. He needs time<br/>
to recover from being told what, how, when to do and think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is going to seem like a quibble but the point actually reaches into the<br/>
heart and soul of unschooling. Unschooling is not a method. It is a way of<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t, as a method is, something we do to kids. It is an environment we<br/>
create around them.<br/>
<br/>
It is a philosophy of life rather than a list of dos and don&#39;t. Which makes<br/>
unschooling much more difficult to explain to people. Part of the philosophy<br/>
of unschooling is to help kids be who they are. But that doesn&#39;t tell anyone<br/>
how to do it with their particular child. So it takes a lot of discussing to<br/>
help people figure out what &quot;getting to know&quot; and &quot;being with&quot; and &quot;helping&quot;<br/>
their kids means in both a general way and specific way for their family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006966589">Yes, I did mean transition, lol. Pardon my slip of the tongue. He is <br/>
6 years old, in 1st grade and has had some behavior problems since <br/>
Kindergarten, but his father was unwilling to consider anything <br/>
besides public schooling. We are now divorced, and the behvior <br/>
problems (actually what I call boredom) are accelerating.  He likes <br/>
to read, as long as you don&#39;t tell him WHAT to read, and he enjoys <br/>
math.. such as counting money... as long as it&#39;s not written on a <br/>
worksheet.  I also have an 8 year old daughter who is doing well in <br/>
public school, and does not want to consider leaving, but I am <br/>
mentally preparing myself to take her out also just in case she <br/>
begins feeling neglected.  I understand that it&#39;s not a &quot;method&quot; in <br/>
the strict sense of the word, but it&#39;s an alternative to the core <br/>
programs and curriculum that I&#39;ve seen available, and fits our <br/>
homestyle more than anything. I&#39;m a very relaxed mom: as long as <br/>
they&#39;re good to other living creatures, and not in danger, pretty <br/>
much anything goes in my house.  I appreciate the correction :) and <br/>
the advice.  <br/>

<br/>

and following some of those links<br/>
<br/>
The younger they are, the easier it is.  And since he can already read, you <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have many problems at all.  Have fun with it!  Smile and play a lot.<br/>

unschooling info.  All of Sandra&#39;s articles and stuff at the message boards<br/>
on unschooling.com.  (I really encourage ALL here who are new to read all of<br/>
these articles and messages!)<br/>
But this comment you made Joyce is a great summary! I really like it...&quot;It<br/>
is an environment we create around them.&quot;  ...I&#39;ll be using this one! &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like he&#39;s a good candidate for unschooling.  Learning is <br/>
intrinsically interesting, if someone else hasn&#39;t flattened it into <br/>
worksheet form and foisted it off on you. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;m a very relaxed mom: as long as<br/>
they&#39;re good to other living creatures, and not in danger, pretty<br/>
much anything goes in my house.**<br/>
<br/>
That attitude will definitely help you unschool.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bit harder to have one kid still in school, as you can&#39;t go on <br/>
far away field trips, or out of town if you have to pick one kid up at <br/>
3pm every day.  The opportunity to sleep in is pretty much shot as well, <br/>
if, for example, you both need to be up and dressed to take your <br/>
daughter to school.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t force your daughter to homeschool, but I would tempt her <br/>
mightily. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
