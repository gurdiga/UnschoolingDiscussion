<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444472349">My kids are 5.5 and 7.5. Adventure Time and Regular Show deserve another<br/>
mention. My kids also love Bob&#39;s Burgers, a new animated comedy. Our whole<br/>
family loves Futurama, and my kids have just discovered The Simpsons.<br/>
Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated (the new series) is pretty great, and<br/>
that&#39;s coming from someone who never liked Scooby Doo growing up. Amazing<br/>
World of Gumball. New Dr. Who, my gals love the Weeping Angel episodes.<br/>
Star Trek TNG.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re watching almost every night before bed is America&#39;s Funniest<br/>
Videos. There&#39;s 20 years of it up on Netflix. They&#39;re both experienced<br/>
YouTubers, so I&#39;m not sure why they choose to take in their funny videos in<br/>
this format, but they just love it. My older daughter likes to read out the<br/>
date, if a video has a date stamp on it. They like to talk about what<br/>
happened, and whether it was funny or not.<br/>

<br/>
Her favourites at the moment are all UK shows, but she watches them on the internet, CBBC website - <br/>
<br/>
Tracey Beaker – set in a children’s home<br/>
Dani’s House – teen drama/sitcom<br/>
Wild Tales – follows wild animals as they grow up<br/>
Deadly 60 – deadliest 60 animals<br/>
Bear Behaving Badly – sort of children’s sitcom<br/>
<br/>
earlier ones that she’s moved on from recently are Horrid Henry, Horrible Histories.<br/>
<br/>
She also loves most cookery/food programmes, Heston’s Fantastical Food, Jamie Oliver, Man versus Food.<br/>

PBSKids website. Lots of social situations have come up that we have ended<br/>
up talking about later.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting series is The Little Travelers. Our local library has<br/>
it and you can also rent the discs on Netflix, assuming you are in a<br/>
country that you can! There are two young girls whose family took extensive<br/>
videos while they were living or traveling abroad and the girls do voice<br/>
overs. My son especially likes that they are real children and he can see<br/>
how children in other countries live. They have British Isles, Japan, Bali,<br/>
Germany, and Iran in the series and each DVD is about an hour long.<br/>

<br/>
As mentioned by someone else, they also LOVE the Backyardigans (incredibly clever music and dance work if you watch it) and Curious George.  <br/>
<br/>
We just finished Avatar: The Last Airbender, which both of them loved. They want to watch the whole series again from the start.<br/>
<br/>
Both of them also like Franklin (although it isn&#39;t on Netflix in Canada anymore, sadly, nor is Curious George, although you can get it on iTunes).<br/>
<br/>
My daughter likes Wallace and Grommit, although my son doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
They both like The Wind in the Willows...you can order the first two seasons and the two feature length films made by the BBC through Amazon.  For some reason, the remaining seasons were never issued on DVD.<br/>
<br/>
Both kids also like Babar, although probably not as much as the others I have mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
Also popular in our house are classic Looney Tunes - we have a collection on DVD which both find fun to watch.  There is so much historical context in those older cartoons it is funny the discussions we have, like, what are those little things in the corners of the drawers that look like Hershey Kisses? (Shelf paper weights, if you are wondering!)  There are lots of neat little references that need explaining too, like why would the grandmother be working swing at the factory?  Things like that.<br/>

My son (who is 14) told me a few days ago that he was a &#39;bronie&#39; and that he was strong and comfortable enough with who he is that it didn&#39;t matter that his friends knew it. I knew he had been watching some &#39;My Little Pony&#39; lately on Netflix but I also know he likes a very wide range of video genres, from Scooby-doo to Resident Evil, old Abbot & Costello to the latest Transformers, you hopefully get the picture he really likes movies and movie history as well as a lot of video game history as well. I also know that he is friends with the younger sister of one of his close friends who is age 10 and loves My Little Pony and they do cross-overs so that everyone can play together. So I didn&#39;t think that much more about it until I read your comment and watched this video on you tube: <br/>

Anyhow I guess to some guys this is a bigger deal than I thought and I wanted to share what I found with other parents who think it&#39;s weird for their older kids to like the show. Barbara<br/>
