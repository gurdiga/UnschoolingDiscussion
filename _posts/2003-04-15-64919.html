<div id="ygrps-yiv-1967239027">I was wondering, how can you tell if you have a kinesthetic learner? <br/>
I have a couple of books about multiple intelligences, but I&#39;m <br/>
unclear about how to tell. And if you do have a kinesthetic learner, <br/>
how do you help/guide them with their learning? Also, can you be more <br/>
than one type of learner. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I was wondering, how can you tell if you have a kinesthetic learner? <br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of books about multiple intelligences, but I&#39;m <br/>
<br/>
unclear about how to tell. And if you do have a kinesthetic learner, <br/>
<br/>
how do you help/guide them with their learning? Also, can you be more <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Starting at the end, anyone who doesn&#39;t have more than one way of learning is <br/>
pretty disabled.  I think  you should always provide stimuli of all kinds so <br/>
the child gets a full idea of the thing anyway.  Something you only hear <br/>
about or see in a line drawing will not be learned as well as something you <br/>
can hear, see, taste, touch and smell.<br/>
<br/>
Multiple intelligences aren&#39;t the same as learning styles.  Someone can have <br/>
a high kinesthetic intelligence, like be a jock or a dancer, but that&#39;s not a <br/>
learning style.  That&#39;s an intelligence--a facet of live which that person <br/>
understands naturally and deeply and learns more about easily (by various <br/>
methods of input).<br/>
<br/>
Instead of labelling and categorizing kids, just give them all opportunities <br/>
in all kinds of fields.  You could use Gardner&#39;s intelligences as a checklist <br/>
from time to time, for yourself to decide what kinds of activities you might <br/>
want to add to your schedule.  If it&#39;s been a while since you got into nature <br/>
(hiked, camped, hung out near water) maybe you should do that.  If you <br/>
haven&#39;t heard or played or sung much music lately, maybe try to work <br/>
something musical in, etc.<br/>
