&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;So from one home educator to all you others I say bring on the tests<br/>
&gt; any day. &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why? :-)  Tests don&#39;t prove anything - except maybe test taking ability on<br/>
&gt; that particular day..even than I am not sure...While we are new to &quot;full<br/>
&gt; unschooling&quot; ( funny term, I know), since January this year, we are not new to<br/>
&gt; relaxed homeschooling and we have never had our kids tesetd - I say try to<br/>
&gt; avoid the tests as much as possible! lol!..Leonie<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Loenie.<br/>
 Having children tested as a way of boasting to the state has many bad side<br/>
effects. It might make other homeschoolers look bad by comparison; it might<br/>
make the state raise the standards for all homeschoolers; if the children do<br/>
poorly, it can give the state reason to think it should make homeschooling<br/>
more restricted and burdensome;  it might give the state reason to believe<br/>
that you think testing is great for children, when it&#39;s not, so they might<br/>
increase their testing for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
By doing what the state wants you to do invites them to make you even MORE<br/>
<br/>
There are NO good reasons for having children tested by the state. If you<br/>
want your kids tested, or if they want to be tested, do it privately. You&#39;ll<br/>
get fair tests, and correct results, and promptly. With the government, who<br/>
knows? <br/>

There&#39;s no such thing.  There&#39;s &quot;promptly,&quot; but there are no &#39;fair&#39; tests <br/>
with &#39;correct&#39; results.</div>
