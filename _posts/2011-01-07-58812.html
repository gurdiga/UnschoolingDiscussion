<div id="ygrps-yiv-65721370">I thought this was cool. Especially cool for readers of science  <br/>
fiction and fantasy. It shows the work spaces of several renowned  <br/>
fantasy and scifi writers. Some people are neat. Some are crammed into  <br/>
tight cluttered spaces. Some write in Barcaloungers. (That would be  <br/>
instant sleep for me!) Some write fantasy on high tech computers. Some  <br/>
with pen by candle light. (Though maybe Joe Haldeman was just goofing!)<br/>
<br/>
But there&#39;s just so many different ways that work for people to be  <br/>
creative. There&#39;s no right way to explore interests. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574856130">Not about creative spaces, but about creative projects -<br/>
<br/>
About a year ago I took my daughters, then ages 11 and 13 to hear David<br/>
Macauley speak at a local art museum about how he creates his books. He was<br/>
really interesting and wonderful. He spent a lot of time talking about how<br/>
his drawings or book ideas sometimes don&#39;t work out, so he sets them aside<br/>
and starts something new.<br/>
<br/>
He said he often doesn&#39;t finish books - he loses interest or realizes it<br/>
won&#39;t work or can&#39;t figure out a problem. Sometimes they&#39;ll sit around for<br/>
years, then he&#39;ll go back and work on them again or take an idea out of them<br/>
and start a new book. Made a big impression on my oldest daughter, who has<br/>
*numerous* unfinished projects that she dips back into. That&#39;s how the<br/>
professionals work &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone in our family has writing and other projects, some of which date<br/>
back years, and our space is kind of mismatched and pack-ratty and full of<br/>
weird (and interesting!) things, but it works for us. I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
showing them this link!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>
