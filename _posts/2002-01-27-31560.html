 </span></blockquote>What a hearty laugh Pat!<br/>
<br/>
I was implying that you put yourself out there. You talk about the issues <br/>
and then take what you need from the advice and leave what you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned a lot just from reading both sides, especially when I&#39;m not <br/>
even involved in the thread!<br/>
<br/>
Its takes a courageous person to say &#39;This is what I&#39;m doing as a parent, <br/>
what other ideas do you have?&#39; Then discuss them and bring up more.<br/>
<br/>
Putting oneself out there isn&#39;t easy, hence I feel it more productive if <br/>
the responses aren&#39;t so blunt as to be critical, but thought-provoking <br/>
for all of us to question the parts that still need work.<br/>

Another beautiful sentiment, Kolleen!  It is *so* hard to share such<br/>
personal, intimate things with people....our insecurities, our fears, our<br/>
questions, our worries.  Particularly about things we feel so vulnerable<br/>
about--what we care about most--our children, our parenting.  But in an<br/>
environment where ridicule is prevalent, any slip-of-the-tongue is attacked,<br/>
and imprecise wording is jumped on, it just doesn&#39;t feel safe to share.  And<br/>
then everyone loses.<br/>
