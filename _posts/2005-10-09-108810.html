<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111138764">My dd (11 yo) has always been a grump when she wakes up (when in PS <br/>
and formal HS).  So I have learned over the past 6 months since we <br/>
have been unschooling to go in gently around noon and just lay down <br/>
next to her.  We cuddle, talk and giggle.  She wakes up in such a <br/>
great mood and the tone for the day is much more pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing your son a quick recovery.  Also, Sandra, I love your website -<br/>
 I&#39;m on it all the time.  The information there is wonderful and very <br/>
informative during our transition from schoolish life(chaos) to <br/>
unschooling (peace.  Also, THANK YOU to all of you on this discussion <br/>
for your great input.<br/>
