<div id="ygrps-yiv-480879967">Hi Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Julie and live in Bulverde, about an hour from you.  You can think of<br/>
this list as an ongoing conversation.  Someone will post a question or a<br/>
statement and others will respond, sometimes you walk in during the middle<br/>
of the conversation and it takes a while to catch on to the topic.  Just<br/>
keep reading and respond when you get the notion.  You&#39;ll soon have the hang<br/>
of it.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Julie</div>
