STUPID?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re calling integrity &quot;stupid&quot;  in the same post in  which you talked <br/>
about &quot;more damage than good&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
My child could have entered school anytime since 1991.  <br/>
My children could enter school tomorrow, and get some high school transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
The same principles on which I&#39;ve based my mothering thusfar will be <br/>
shattered if I start to lie about what I&#39;m doing now.<br/>
<br/>
Children CAN and DO and WILL get into college without a school-looking <br/>
transcript.<br/>
That being true (not maybe, but proven), then why would a parent model <br/>
dishonesty?<br/>
<br/>
-=-My child is unschooling in an eclectic way. At 4 years old . . . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not legally bound to &quot;be schooled&quot; so why be schooling her in ANY way <br/>
at this point?<br/>
She&#39;s four.  Why can&#39;t she just be living a happy &quot;preschool&quot; life?<br/>
<br/>
-=-some jobs even demading their own testing before an interview-=--<br/>
<br/>
Practicing could be accomplished with magazine surveys and trivia books.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I want my child to have good testing skills. College will demand it just <br/>
as jobs she may wish to do might. I would not harm her by not helping her <br/>
devolop those needed skills. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I have never known one parent to successfully ignore a test skill.  Lots have <br/>
said they would.  All have said &quot;I couldn&#39;t help...&quot; about knowing that their <br/>
child tested low, or average or high.  They treat their children differently.<br/>
<br/>
You could harm your child by encouraging testing if that testing involves <br/>
having her tested.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
  When the time comes her and I shall put together a transcript for her, we <br/>
shall grade her on topics she has covered honestly. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You might want to be careful about using the word &quot;shall&quot; about what you <br/>
think you&#39;ll do twelve years from now.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Tests shall be nothing more then a tool she can use to gage where she is <br/>
at in topics she is interested in.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You can brag about what you think YOU &quot;shall&quot; do in advance, but you cannot <br/>
declare what tests shall be.  They already are what they are.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do not think that is anti unschooling as I shall not be pushing her to <br/>
take them. I will show her the value of them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Before she can make an &quot;informed consent&quot; decision, she needs to know both <br/>
sides.  Otherwise, if you just show her &quot;the value,&quot; there&#39;s not much difference <br/>
between that and pushing her to take them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My job is to prepair her for life as an adult, and it does not matter if <br/>
we like it or not, tests are a part of it for now. -=-<br/>
<br/>
For now, she&#39;s four years old.   If you see your job as helping her be the <br/>
happiest four year old she could possibly be, the learning will just flow in.  <br/>
If you spend her fourth year, and fifth, and sixth, preparing for college, <br/>
you&#39;re not using your time as well as you could.<br/>
<br/>

Humble opinions don&#39;t usually include telling the other people they&#39;re stupid <br/>
and doing more harm than good, do they?  Maybe I misunderstand &quot;humble <br/>

Digest is something new to me but needed as this group is very <br/>
active. <br/>

&gt; In this group, unschooling is not the extreme, it&#39;s the topic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I am not sure if unschooling in itself is extreme. I think it is a <br/>
bad idea to not be willing to introduce knowledge to a child, as we <br/>
have been doing it for a very long time, far longer then we have had <br/>
schools. Parents would teach their children what they thought they <br/>
needed to know to be a useful. I do not know a culture that did not <br/>
ask that children do something to help the family such as chores, <br/>
watching the younger one. They needed to told how to do much of it I <br/>
think, or maybe showed closer to what I am trying to say. <br/>
<br/>
 I think it is a negative thing for a parent to not present a child <br/>
with what they think they should know. Like manners, and morals. At 4 <br/>
years old I can and feel I should teach my daughter these things. <br/>
Along with how to clean her room, not to run in the road and why. I <br/>
take the time to teach her things I know. Sometimes she is <br/>
interested, sometimes not. I am not going to stop trying to teach her <br/>
why she should not touch the stove when I am cooking just because at <br/>
that moment she does not want to hear it! <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>talk about <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Ok, lets talk about it. I have a friend with three kids. I thought I <br/>
knew her well. I knew she homeschooled. I left my child with her to <br/>
baby sit. On my way to pick up my child I was pulling into the drive <br/>
way and almost hit her 18 month old. Alone, playing in the front <br/>
yard, no mother in sight, infact no one in sight. I go in to find the <br/>
tow older boys 5 and 7 I believe watching TV with friends. Where is <br/>
your mother I ask. Neither one know. Why is the baby out side I ask. <br/>
Again neither one know. They do not seem to care either. I search the <br/>
house. No mother, and my daughter can not be found either. I find <br/>
them out side in the back yard. back yard has a 6 foot high solid <br/>
wood fence. They are spray painting something. I run and hug my <br/>
child. The mother askes me what it wrong. I hand her, her baby. I <br/>
asked how long they have been out here. About 20 minutes she says. I <br/>
aks her who was watching her baby. She says the bay was in the high <br/>
chair and the boys where watching her. I tell her what I found. She <br/>
does not seem bothered. She says the kids will learn what is safe and <br/>
what is not. <br/>
 <br/>
 I was not happy and tried to make a fast exit. She sees me upset and <br/>
takers her sons in a room to spank them for not watching thier <br/>
sister. She gives them lots of freedom but also spanks them for <br/>
things like talking back and not responding to a demand right away. <br/>
Confuses the heck out of me. (I am not one for spanking) <br/>
<br/>
 Then I learn she unschools. She tells me about it and I find that I <br/>
might like it as I do not think schools are healthy and I also do not <br/>
think a child should be pushed to learn math and reading so young, I <br/>
feel they have other things to be learning. <br/>
<br/>
 She takes things to the extreme, her sons know little other then <br/>
phrases from the bible that she does have them learn. And worse, they <br/>
do not feel like they have to be responcible for anything. <br/>
<br/>
 I am sure there are many more good then bad unschoolers. Again, I <br/>
just think extreme is bad. I do not think unschooling in itself is <br/>
bad. Just those that say it must be their way or no way. Thus many <br/>
have left this group to look for a more eclectic and free thinking <br/>
way of unschooling. They do unschool in the sence that they do not <br/>
push the classes of schooling and the bad things (Bad things <br/>
including those things found in the book dumbing us down and other <br/>
anti school books like it) and they still call them selves <br/>
unschoolers. And I think they are, but they are doing it in the way <br/>
that works best for them and their children. <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; about &quot;more damage than good&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes Stupid. I think any parent not willing to look at their childs <br/>
learning and grade them on it for the betterment of the education the <br/>
child wishes to have is being stupid. At 18 I think you and your <br/>
child would be ready to get real and take the tests needed. Do you <br/>
think you can stop them from having test in college? I do not think <br/>
so. And some colleges WILL NOT accept you without transcripts. Maybe <br/>
that will change by the time my baby is old enough to go. For now we <br/>
are dealing with it seeing both hubby and I are trying to get back to <br/>
school. It is easier for him as he is in the military, not so easy <br/>
for me as I have limited choices as to where I can go and how much I <br/>
can pay! <br/>
<br/>
 I do not think grading my child and creating a transcript would be <br/>
damaging to my integrity. I am a realist, and my daughter will know <br/>
that we are flexable about things we are not able to change. If they <br/>
want transcripts, we will make it happen for her, even if she needs <br/>
to be tested and go over all she has learned to grade herself fairly. <br/>

not that I have ever learned. Life is about being useful, about being <br/>
a good person, about makeing life woth something. Happy comes with <br/>
being useful. My child is so happy to help, she does not see work as <br/>
something negative or as something she must do before she can have <br/>
fun. Work, learning, playing, are all part of her learning and to <br/>
her, all fun! That in itself helps me think we are doing something <br/>
right. <br/>

people who do what they say they shall do. Point: I was 10 years old <br/>
and learned about surrogacy, my step mother wanted to have a child <br/>
with my father. I told her and everyone some day I would have a baby <br/>
for another couple because I knew I could. And I did. twice, 10 years <br/>
latter. So I would get to know someone before saying what they can <br/>
and can not do. Certainly things change, I might not be alive then or <br/>
we might not even need to. But that will not keep me from planning!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it would help for you to read a lot more about what unschoolers<br/>
actually do before reprimanding a list full of people for what you think<br/>
they may be doing.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t fair for you to reprimand 1500 people for how your friend is living<br/>
her life, what she&#39;s doing with her kids and what she&#39;s calling herself.<br/>
Anyone can call herself an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling children learn by doing, by living, by observation, by asking<br/>
questions, by being interested, by being with us and by us being with them.<br/>
It&#39;s the way adults learn on their own. It&#39;s the same way children learned<br/>
to speak. We didn&#39;t need to teach them. We made language available by<br/>
talking to them about what interested them and what might interest them and<br/>
answering their questions. They used English to get what they wanted and got<br/>
better as a side effect. That&#39;s how learning works.<br/>
<br/>
The best place to start is John Holt. Then the message boards at<br/>
Unschooling.com (Http://www.unschooling.com) and Sandra&#39;s site<br/>
(http://sandradodd.com)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is not unparenting. Unschooling is not neglect. We removed<br/>
school and replace it with something else. You need to read more about<br/>
unschooling to find out what we&#39;ve replaced school with. It isn&#39;t easy for<br/>
many people to get. It takes a lot of reading, patience and respectful<br/>
questioning.<br/>
<br/>
You will get more helpful answers if you ask how people are doing something<br/>
that concerns you rather than reprimanding them for what you think they&#39;re<br/>
doing or not doing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do not know a culture that did not<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter lives with me. She sees me doing things. I ask if she&#39;d like to<br/>
help. She asks if she can help. I don&#39;t need to make her do chores for her<br/>
to learn. She knows how to do basic tasks around the house and some cooking.<br/>
I&#39;ve replaced &quot;making&quot; with something else. Please do read, ask questions<br/>
and find out what that is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think it is a negative thing for a parent to not present a child<br/>

unschoolers do it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not going to stop trying to teach her<br/>
&gt; why she should not touch the stove when I am cooking just because at<br/>
&gt; that moment she does not want to hear it!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And an unschooler would know that her child is learning all the time. I<br/>
didn&#39;t need to teach my daughter the stove was hot. At some point I probably<br/>
stopped her from getting burned or said &quot;Careful, it&#39;s hot.&quot; I may have held<br/>
my hand near the stove to show her how to feel how hot it was. It only takes<br/>
a moment to learn a stove is hot!<br/>
<br/>
After that it would be my responsibility to keep her safe because even<br/>
though she had the knowledge that the stove was hot and could burn her, she<br/>
might not have the body awareness of how close she was. I don&#39;t remember her<br/>
*not* being aware, but it would still be my responsibility to be aware for<br/>
her to move her if she got too close or remind her the stove was hot.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ok, lets talk about it. I have a friend with three kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s more useful to talk unschooling as defined on this list. There are no<br/>
official membership cards that identify someone a certified unschooler. (Or<br/>
vegetarian. Or Episcopalian. Or environmentalist.) Anyone can call herself<br/>
an unschooler. That doesn&#39;t mean she knows what it is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am sure there are many more good then bad unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And there are many people who call themselves unschoolers who don&#39;t<br/>
understand the concept. It&#39;s more than not doing school. Not doing school is<br/>
the beginning point. It needs to be replaced with something else, not left<br/>
as a blank spot in kids lives.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They do unschool in the sence that they do not<br/>

&gt; unschoolers. And I think they are, but they are doing it in the way<br/>
&gt; that works best for them and their children.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You will learn more about unschooling by asking us questions about how we<br/>
unschool and how we define unschooling than by telling us what unschooling<br/>
is.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I never said unschooling is extreme,<br/>
&gt; just that in all groups there are extreme people who take things to<br/>
&gt; an extreme level.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some mothers smack their kids. Some mothers lock their kids in closets.<br/>
<br/>
I presume you call yourself a mother.<br/>
<br/>
Should the extremes who use a word define what a word means? Should they<br/>
even be included in the definition?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes Stupid. I think any parent not willing to look at their childs<br/>
&gt; learning and grade them on it for the betterment of the education the<br/>
&gt; child wishes to have is being stupid.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*If* the only way to get into college were to create a list of courses with<br/>
letter grades, it would be foolish not to.<br/>
<br/>
Most college understand about homeschooling. Many even understand about<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What would be stupid, would be to assume I already know enough about getting<br/>
an unschooled child into a college from my knowledge of how schooled kids<br/>
get into college. If my daughter were getting close, I&#39;d start reading<br/>
everything I could about how homeschoolers and unschoolers get into college.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re calling people on this list who *have* read about how unschoolers get<br/>
into colleges, who *have8 kids who have gotten into college without standard<br/>
school transcripts stupid when apparently you are the one who hasn&#39;t read<br/>
anything beyond the standard information and don&#39;t know anything beyond what<br/>
you think you know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you <br/>
&gt; think you can stop them from having test in college?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you read anything about how unschoolers have responded to college? Or<br/>
are you just guessing and then telling us your guesses to &quot;enlighten&quot; us?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And some colleges WILL NOT accept you without transcripts.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you read about unschoolers who have gotten into colleges?<br/>
<br/>
Have you read about people changing the system? Schools are really good at<br/>
teaching people to accept things the way they are. To sit down, shut up and<br/>
do what the authorities tell them is best.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is determined to get into a college there are ways. You&#39;ll learn<br/>
more by asking people who&#39;ve done it than by telling people what you think<br/>
is true.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they <br/>
&gt; want transcripts, we will make it happen for her, even if she needs<br/>
&gt; to be tested and go over all she has learned to grade herself fairly.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This list is about unschooling. If you want to know what unschoolers do, how<br/>
unschoolers get into college, then please ask.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of places for people to find out how to do things the<br/>
standard way. There are plenty of places for people to trade ignorances and<br/>
make things up to soothe their fears.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not what people signed onto *this* list for. They signed on to<br/>
find out how unschoolers approach life.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Since when is life about being happy?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Life is what we choose to make it. Is there a law against life being about<br/>
being happy? Will you get arrested? Will you be fined?<br/>
<br/>
So who is stopping you from making life about being happy?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Life is not about being happy,<br/>
&gt; not that I have ever learned.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People can learn new things their whole lives. It doesn&#39;t stop when school<br/>
stops. That would be one of the basic things an unschooling parent should<br/>
understand before starting unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Life is about being useful, about being<br/>
&gt; a good person, about makeing life woth something.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s called a philosophy of life. It isn&#39;t everyone&#39;s philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Happy comes with being useful.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s one path to happiness.<br/>
<br/>
There are many paths to happiness and we can take them all :-) Happiness can<br/>
come from doing something useful. It can come from helping people. It can<br/>
come from doing something you enjoy. It can come from learning something. It<br/>
can come from being in someone&#39;s company. We don&#39;t have to pick just one!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re choosing to make life about being useful, that&#39;s your choice. But<br/>
it doesn&#39;t make sense to tell people life can&#39;t be about being happy because<br/>
it can.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My child is so happy to help, she does not see work as<br/>
&gt; something negative or as something she must do before she can have<br/>
&gt; fun. Work, learning, playing, are all part of her learning and to<br/>
&gt; her, all fun! That in itself helps me think we are doing something<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you were to read the list (and the message board and Sandra&#39;s site) you&#39;d<br/>
read similar things.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am not talking about testing a child, I am talking about testing a<br/>
&gt; young adult getting ready to go out into the world. Like age 16ish!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you had a 16 yo ready to go out into the world? There are people on<br/>
this list who have had real 16 yos going out into the real world. You could<br/>
ask how they did it and how it turned out for them. You might find out<br/>
something you didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am one of those people that can say I shall do something and more<br/>
&gt; then likely I will do it. Even ten years latter. One of the rare<br/>
&gt; people who do what they say they shall do.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Someone promising to do something and doing it is admirable.<br/>
<br/>
Having a dream and working towards it is admirable.<br/>
<br/>
But being certain that you won&#39;t learn anything in the next 10 years that<br/>
could change your mind about something is foolish. It isn&#39;t a good thing for<br/>
life and especially not a good thing for unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Goodness, did I say they are stupid?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think any parent not willing to look at their childs<br/>
&gt; learning and grade them on it for the betterment of the education the<br/>
&gt; child wishes to have is being stupid.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think some advice should be taken here.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think some reading on your part should be taken here. You&#39;re are speaking<br/>
to people who have done what you&#39;re saying can&#39;t be done and telling us we<br/>
need to listen to your convictions about what you believe is true.<br/>
<br/>
Read. Ask questions. It&#39;s a lot more useful for learning than repeating what<br/>
you think you know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2001057429"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I am not going to stop trying to teach her <br/>
&gt; why she should not touch the stove when I am cooking just because <br/>
 </span></blockquote>at <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that moment she does not want to hear it! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If it&#39;s taking multiple attempts to &quot;teach&quot; your daughter why she <br/>
shouldn&#39;t touch the stove when you&#39;re cooking, something is seriously <br/>
wrong.  If your daughter has no interest in the stove (you say she <br/>
does not want to hear it!), then there&#39;s no need to be &quot;teaching&quot; her <br/>
anything at that moment in time.  If she HAS shown an interest in <br/>
touching the stove, then let her be near enough to feel the heat.  No <br/>
healthy child is going to do more than that, so there&#39;s no need <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; or lecture.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am sure there are many more good then bad unschoolers. Again, I <br/>
&gt; just think extreme is bad. I do not think unschooling in itself is <br/>
&gt; bad. Just those that say it must be their way or no way. Thus many <br/>
&gt; have left this group to look for a more eclectic and free thinking <br/>
&gt; way of unschooling. They do unschool in the sence that they do not <br/>
&gt; push the classes of schooling and the bad things (Bad things <br/>
&gt; including those things found in the book dumbing us down and other <br/>
&gt; anti school books like it) and they still call them selves <br/>
&gt; unschoolers. And I think they are, but they are doing it in the way <br/>
&gt; that works best for them and their children. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Using an example of how something is done poorly is not an excuse to <br/>
then do it poorly yourself.  Your friend was not an unschooler.  I&#39;ll <br/>
agree that there are &quot;degrees&quot; of unschooling in the sense that some <br/>
families are &quot;further along the journey.&quot; But spanking is not <br/>
unschooling, forcing learning of any kind is not unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes Stupid. I think any parent not willing to look at their childs <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; child wishes to have is being stupid. At 18 I think you and your <br/>
&gt; child would be ready to get real and take the tests needed. Do you <br/>
&gt; think you can stop them from having test in college? I do not think <br/>
&gt; so. And some colleges WILL NOT accept you without transcripts. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oy.  So much UN-unschooling thought in one paragraph. :(  The <br/>
emphasis here is on the parent, isn&#39;t it?  Why should the parent need <br/>
to grade the child&#39;s education?  If the child chooses to go to <br/>
college, the child will find a way.  She&#39;ll ask her parent to help <br/>
create a transcript, or she&#39;ll decide to go take a test taking <br/>
course, or read books on being a better test-taker.  She&#39;ll take <br/>
community college courses or find an on-line course.  There are many, <br/>
many options.  And the phrase &quot;get real?!&quot;  The implication is that <br/>
spending 18 yrs unschooling is not &quot;real,&quot; that 18, it&#39;s time to &quot;get <br/>
real.&quot; Unschooling is as &quot;real&quot; as it gets.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt;  I do not think grading my child and creating a transcript would be <br/>
&gt; damaging to my integrity. I am a realist, and my daughter will know <br/>
&gt; that we are flexable about things we are not able to change. If <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; want transcripts, we will make it happen for her, even if she needs <br/>
&gt; to be tested and go over all she has learned to grade herself <br/>
 </span></blockquote>fairly. <br/>
 <br/>
Good grief.  Again, it&#39;s about what YOU will do.  YOU are a realist.  <br/>
You&#39;ve already decided what things can be changed and what can&#39;t.  <br/>
You state that &quot;We will make it happen.&quot;  There are a LOT of <br/>
assumptions in that paragraph.  As an unschooler, my thoughts are <br/>
that IF my boys decide to go to college one day, THEY will decide on <br/>
what&#39;s necessary, or needed...I&#39;ll be there to help, IF they want it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am not talking about testing a child, I am talking about testing <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; young adult getting ready to go out into the world. Like age 16ish!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then that young adult is old enough to make her own decisions (not to <br/>
imply that younger children aren&#39;t...my boys make their own decisions <br/>
now). Why try to make that decision for her now? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am one of those people that can say I shall do something and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>more <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; then likely I will do it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The problem here is that you&#39;re planning what YOU SHALL do with and <br/>
for your daughter, when it should be what SHE will do.  It&#39;s not YOUR <br/>
life...it&#39;s HER life.  Trust her to make her own decisions.  Yes, <br/>
you&#39;re there to help her and support her, but it is so unfair of you <br/>
to plan her life for her.  She may decide to become the lead <br/>
guitarist in a rock band, or build a small cabin in the woods <br/>
somewhere and become a happy hermit, but you&#39;ve already decided that <br/>
to be happy, she has to be USEFUL, and that to be successful, she has <br/>
to be a good test taker. :(  Let HER decide what happy and useful <br/>
will be in HER life.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think some advice should be taken here. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Egads.  You have a 4 yr. old and you&#39;re posting to women that have <br/>
young adults and teenagers that have been unschooled...and those <br/>
young adults and teenagers are healthy and HAPPY!  Again, YOU&#39;VE made <br/>
decisions about a system that you perceive.  Let your daughter grow <br/>
up to make her own decisions about &quot;the system.&quot;  It&#39;s not up to THE <br/>
SYSTEM to make your child happy...or YOU! It&#39;s up to her.  And the <br/>
best way to help her on that journey is to give her freedom.  <br/>
