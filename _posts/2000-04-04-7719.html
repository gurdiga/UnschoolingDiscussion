<div><font size="2">Do you all unschool math as well?&nbsp; I&#39;ve read over and 
over the ways you can unschool math, and it is starting to &quot;sink in&quot;.&nbsp; 
</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">I think its interesting that you all talk about the 
relationships of numbers, patterns, etc of the universe, and how mathematics 
underlies all of it.&nbsp; This is something I never understood.&nbsp; I never 
thought of math this way at all.&nbsp; To me its abstract numbers.&nbsp; I love 
math stuff, but I have never really applied it to the &quot;patterns&quot; of life or the 
universe.</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font size="2">Is there a book that points some of this out so I can 
understand it better?</font></div>
