<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767455426"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; Also, anyone here ever start a family bed with an &gt; older child (if<br/>
 </span></blockquote>you count over 1 older!!)?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
First dd slept mostly in my arms for three weeks, then in a crib.  There<br/>
was just a thin wall between her crib and our bed.  We moved when dd #2<br/>
was 7 months old.  #2 slept with us from the beginning (in our waterbed<br/>
to boot).  When we moved, my plan was that #2 would sleep on a small mat<br/>
on the floor next to our bed, to begin the transition out of our bed. <br/>
HA!  #1 had no interest in sleeping by herself in the bedroom at the<br/>
other end of the house, so plan B was for her to sleep on the mat.  We<br/>
quickly ended up at plan C - all 4 of us in the (fortunately king size) <br/>
waterbed.  #1 was just short of 3 years then.  The hardest part for me is<br/>
that I would end up squished between dh on one side and the girls on the<br/>
other, because we have on old waterbed and everyone ends up rolling<br/>
together.  We all stayed in the bed for about a year, until we moved both<br/>
girls together into a double bed.  Dh or I lay down with them until they<br/>
fall asleep.  Most nights they sleep through, but sometimes they come to<br/>
wake us during the night.  The eldest, now 8, is more likely to wake then<br/>
the 5 yr old.  <br/>
