&gt;   QUICK!  Sign up for this conference!!<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s the first unschooling conference in the southeastern U.S. and unless <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   it&#39;s really well attended, it could be the last!  SO GO!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Really.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Sandra! I&#39;ve tried to write twice, but AOL keeps knocking me off. :-(<br/>
<br/>
Virginia and Evelyn, y&#39;all may become members of SOS, a support group for <br/>
unschoolers in SC (Myranda already is &lt;g&gt;). There&#39;s not a whole lot of <br/>
support going on there (at the site) right now because I&#39;m so busy with the <br/>
conference----real live support jammed packed into one action-filled weekend! <br/>
&lt;G&gt;  Go to the site   www.schoolsoutsupport.org   and click on &quot;about SOS&quot;. <br/>
We&#39;ll be having another couple of get-togethers before the conference in <br/>
Columbia if y&#39;all&#39;d like to join us! Email me privately if you have <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
I apologize for being late on all these discussions. I&#39;m spending WAAAY too <br/>
much time organizing the conference and I&#39;ve gone to digest, so posts are <br/>
delayed. Again, thanks, Sandra! :-)<br/>
