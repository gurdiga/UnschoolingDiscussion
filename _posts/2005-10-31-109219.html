 </span></blockquote>In New Mexico neither of those &quot;risks&quot; exists from non compliance with the <br/>
law.   The law says if a family is found not to be in compliance, they must <br/>
comply.    I don&#39;t know what it says now, but a few years back when it was worded <br/>

there would be a $25 fine.   <br/>

I doubt that the hundreds of unregistered families in New Mexico who never <br/>

people elsewhere.<br/>

(Maybe it was certified and not registered, but it was specifically one type <br/>
of U.S. Postal Service mailing option that needed to be hand-delivered and <br/>
signed for.   Classic example of a BAD, illogical and worthless law, probably <br/>
written by a professional educator.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283586763">Your very nicely worded post on store rules from the other day pretty<br/>
much addresses it: people make up laws when they feel that others have<br/>
done stuff they &quot;shouldn&#39;t.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
In WA (specifically), Chapter 28A.225 of the RCW compels children<br/>
between 8-18 to compulsory attendance, and subjects both parents and<br/>
children to state detention and fines.<br/>
In (again, specifically WA) Chapter 28A.200 of the RCW provides for<br/>
Home Based Instruction, which covers the child for compulsory<br/>
attendance, but non-compliance with the law renders the family<br/>
&quot;truant&quot; rather than &quot;homeschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ID, (which, in my opinion, has the &quot;right&quot; kind of homeschooling law<br/>
(provide a &quot;comparable education&quot; from 7-16)) has recently fended off<br/>
two attempts to make &quot;falling behind grade level&quot; for homeschoolers a<br/>
misdemeanor for the parents, complete with fines and jail time.  (Can<br/>
you imagine if failing students were a misdemeanor for teachers?)<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of people out there who would love to place a<br/>
inordinate number of requirements and state-oversight on homeschoolers<br/>
(these are generally the same people who have the most difficult time<br/>
understanding unschooling).  These same people are hardly satisfied<br/>
with the homeschooling laws in states like PA, and are horrified that<br/>
any state (like ID) would allow parents to opt out of state oversight<br/>
and education entirely.  <br/>
<br/>
Those homeschoolers who choose to be &quot;truant&quot; rather than comply with<br/>
state law fan the flames of those (ironically, public schoolers) who<br/>
would like to see homeschooling banned entirely.<br/>
<br/>
In (WA, specifically), compliance is very simple, very basic, and very<br/>
non-intrusive.  (There is no mechanism, for example, except entry or<br/>
reenrty to the school system, that allows for the state to check the<br/>
assessments or tests.  The scores are completely between the testing<br/>
folks and the family).  &quot;[A]ll decisions relating to philosophy or<br/>
doctrine, selections of books, teaching materials and curriculum, and<br/>
methods, timing, and place in the provision or evaluation of<br/>
home-based instruction shall be the responsibility of the parent&quot; in WA.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911720280">I posted earlier but I think my post got lost in cyberspace.  I was <br/>
just wondering if I could hear from a few of you who don&#39;t comply and <br/>
are, technically, unschooling illegally.  We live in Alaska, where <br/>
there are absolutely no homeschool laws, we don&#39;t even have to <br/>
register as a homeschooler, but we are getting ready to travel the US <br/>
in our motorhome for a year and then find a place (besides Alaska) to <br/>
settle down in.  One of our big concerns, in finding a state to live <br/>
in, is the homeschool laws.  We are so used to having complete freedom <br/>
and I don&#39;t know how relaxed I can be if I am not complying.  I would <br/>
just love to hear from some of you that aren&#39;t and how it works for <br/>
you.  I am very loud about unschooling, down to dozens of bumper <br/>
stickers on my van so I am afraid I would draw a lot of attention to <br/>
the fact that we do unschool.<br/>

Some people are unregistered who might not want to &quot;go on record&quot; here about <br/>
it.   <br/>

If I had hostile relatives or an ex husband, I would definitely register.   <br/>
Those without such impediments have more leeway.<br/>

be registered.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling isn&#39;t nearly as straightforward as murder or laws against <br/>
theft.<br/>
<br/>
First there&#39;s the compulsory attendance law which crept up on people <br/>
gradually over many decades.<br/>
Then there&#39;s a huge array of homeschooling laws and sometimes multiple <br/>
options even within same jurisdictions.<br/>
<br/>
Once there are private school and charter school options, homeschooling is <br/>
just one more among many ways to go.   The right of a government to dictate to <br/>
parents what they do with their children is not as straightforward as a law <br/>
against stealing a horse or a car.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Those homeschoolers who choose to be &quot;truant&quot; rather than comply with<br/>
state law fan the flames of those (ironically, public schoolers) who<br/>
would like to see homeschooling banned entirely.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This seems not to be at all the case where I live.    Some   years back when <br/>
I was more involved locally, estimates were that only from 1/3 to 1/2 of <br/>
homeschoolers are registered here.   If asolutely everyone registered, it would NOT <br/>
be to the advantage of the school system.   It&#39;s better for them NOT to have <br/>
everyone know how many families have bailed out completely.   Who would be <br/>
elected to the school board if it were clear how many homeschoolers there were <br/>
and how happy and healthy and free they are?    Why would voters vote for school <br/>
bonds and mil taxes if they knew how many homeschoolers there were?   <br/>
<br/>
People decide in their own ways what risks are worth taking.   Some feel so <br/>
strongly about avoiding tests that they won&#39;t register unless they have to. <br/>
<br/>
In cases of victimless &quot;crimes&quot; (not that failure to register is much of a <br/>
crime anyway--usually they&#39;ll just say &quot;you need to comply with the law&quot;), <br/>
usually people start to openly ignore the law, and then the law looks silly and is <br/>
changed.    Some I can think of that have changed in many jurisdictions in <br/>
recent memory are cohabitation and sodomy.    &quot;Between consenting adults&quot; is a <br/>
more common and respected term than either of those others.   Technically in <br/>
some states, still, oral sex is illegal between husband and wife (and in many <br/>
more it was illegal until very recently).   Should people in those states stick <br/>
to the missionary position because a law says to?   Should people who want to <br/>
live together without being married hop across the border to another state?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re getting further from unschooling and how learning works, though, and <br/>
people should bring the topic back if possible, please.    The philosphical end <br/>
of the responsibilities homeschoolers might have to other homeschoolers is <br/>
interesting, but where it turns to particular laws and to politics goes beyond <br/>
the focus of this discussion list.<br/>

been open about their lack of compliance for years. In Washington  <br/>
State there are the Hegeners, publishers of Home Education Magazine,  <br/>
who certainly never made any secret of the fact that they never  <br/>
complied with the state homeschool law.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure many people would have preferred that Rosa Parks just go  <br/>
ahead and comply in order not to &quot;fan the flames?&quot;<br/>

Well, I&#39;m sure because Ren is your sis that you already know that we <br/>
have unschool friendly umbrella schools in Florida. I believe that <br/>
both Texas and Michigan are super easy, neither requires registration <br/>
that I am aware of.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-791624104">Yes.  Really.<br/>
And yes, I do see non-compliance as a danger to the rest of us--as<br/>
were the actions of civil rights leaders to African Americans in the<br/>
south.  <br/>
But that&#39;s part of the beauty of unschooling, isn&#39;t it?--<br/>
That children learn from their parent&#39;s actions, and are present and<br/>
part of those same actions.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had some very interesting discussions on civil disobedience at<br/>
the dinner table in the last week, in part because of the passing of<br/>
Rosa Parks, in part how MLK Jr. and Socrates dealt with it.  Our<br/>
current conversation is over the covert breaking of laws vs. the overt<br/>
breaking of them.<br/>
<br/>
MLK says this in his Letter from a Birmingham Jail: &quot;In no sense do I<br/>
advocate evading or defying the law, as would the rabid<br/>
segregationist. That would lead to anarchy. One who breaks an unjust<br/>
law must do so openly, lovingly, and with a willingness to accept the<br/>
penalty. I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience<br/>
tells him is unjust and who willingly accepts the penalty of<br/>
imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over<br/>
its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.&quot;<br/>
