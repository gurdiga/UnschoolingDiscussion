the things i let slide (i consider them self-expression and don&#39;t <br/>

disrespectful.  If they were adults, i might think so, but i don&#39;t <br/>
demand the same language i&#39;d expect from an adult. They&#39;re not using <br/>
insults, just saying &quot;NO!&quot; and being short with me at times when <br/>
they&#39;re frustrated.  In the meantime, I&#39;m working with them to reduce <br/>
their frustration by giving them more choice.  What do people <br/>

I hear ya! The struggles of listening to &quot;those&quot; people are what has <br/>
stopped my progress as far as deschooling SO MANY TIMES! I am so iffed <br/>
when I walk away from conversations that include all of what you stated <br/>
and also many more that I end up spending the evening second guessing <br/>
my descions...not second guessing homeschooling, but unschooling. I <br/>
detest it, becuase nothing else but unschooling works for our family. <br/>
We are so free to be and see ....Its amazing. I have made the descion <br/>
though that I am not going to let people get under my skin like that. <br/>
We are doing this for our family. no one else</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385487415">Can I point something out to you as objectively and as gently as possible?<br/>
<br/>
In the fist part of your message you&#39;re lamenting the way others are judging<br/>
you for doing things differently.  But then you go on to cast judgement on<br/>
other families who do things differently than you.<br/>
<br/>
Just an observation.<br/>
<br/>
We love the Simpsons.  We have almost every season on DVD and my children<br/>
love to watch.  They don&#39;t swear at me (although Sarah did say &quot;Dammit!&quot;<br/>
rather loudly when she stubbed her toe on the doorjam last week), but they<br/>
are always allowed to talk back to me and share their feelings and thoughts.<br/>
They do it in a calm way because generaly children speak the way they&#39;re<br/>
spoken to.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s frustrating to feel judged.  One of the best things you can do<br/>
for yourself and your children is to let go of worrying about what other<br/>
people think, not just in unschooling, but in life.  Life is far too short<br/>
to live it trying to win other peoples&#39; approval.<br/>
<br/>
Let it go.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that in traditional (adversarial) parent-child <br/>
relationships, &quot;talking back&quot; refers to a child responding in kind to <br/>
nasty, patronizing, or controlling talk from his parents.  My children <br/>
don&#39;t hear me or their father speaking nastily to them, so there is no <br/>
need for that kind of &quot;talking back&quot; on their part.<br/>
<br/>
I also think the whole idea of &quot;talking back,&quot; and that being a *bad* <br/>
thing for a child to do, is related to the idea of children being seen <br/>
and not heard and of children generally being far less valuable than <br/>
the adults around them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just realizing now that my children would be pretty flabbergasted <br/>
by the whole concept, and I have to say I&#39;m proud of that. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343013738">Have you guys watched Crash? My hubby and I sat down and watched it <br/>
last weekend, and what a thought provoking movie. I am going to be <br/>
sitting down with ym son today and watching it again. Him hearing me <br/>
talk about what a great movie it was has sparked his interest.  It was <br/>
so incrediable...I highly reccomend it.<br/>
As for talking back...I didnt even look at that part of the orginal  <br/>
post..lol...I was concentrating on the whole compare our kids routine, <br/>
which I dislike BIG time. Or the woman standing in the grocery line <br/>
feels its ok to &quot;test&quot; my kids on their times tables when they ask why <br/>
their not in school and they get an answer *gag* <br/>
My kids talk back...and quite frankly I wouldnt want it any other way. <br/>
If my kids woke up every morning and were in the best moods ever, <br/>
wouldnt that mean that I would have to be in a good mood ALLLLLL the <br/>
time? lol...umm ya no. We all wake up on the wrong side of th bed for <br/>
one and for two I think sometimes people label talking back as such , <br/>
but its really just people expressing a view. I actully dont really <br/>
know what I would label as talking back now that I am thinking about <br/>
it...</div>

I agree.  In fact, I always know when I&#39;ve crossed the line to disrespectful<br/>
because I get it right back and then I have to stop and think about what I<br/>
said to cause that kind of reaction. <br/>
<br/>
I am glad my kids have the courage to stand up for themselves.  I hope they<br/>
take that lesson through the rest of their lives and never let people treat<br/>
them badly.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are some of the most pleasant kids to be around that I know. They<br/>
like the Simpsons too and they even swear sometimes, but they know that the<br/>
language they use at home isn&#39;t appropriate except at home.  (for now)<br/>
<br/>
When some of my nieces and nephews were younger and used inappropriate<br/>
language/talk, I was very judgmental of their parents who had allowed them<br/>
to watch inappropriate TV shows etc.  But now I feel differently.  It isn&#39;t<br/>
allowing the shows that is the problem, it is the lack of addressing what<br/>
they see/hear and giving them appropriate information about what is<br/>
acceptable in certain situations and not.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>===========<br/>
<br/>
I feel that way too.  Most parents around me when I was growing up  <br/>
hardly knew their kids.  Part of that was probably school.  Part of  <br/>
it, though, was the &quot;don&#39;t talk back&quot; rule which effectively  <br/>
prevented any real communications.<br/>
<br/>
Good for our situation:  When one of my kids is sharp and defensive,  <br/>
I consider that either I&#39;m being unreasonable, or that it has nothing  <br/>
much to do with me at all, but that the kid is not feeling well or is  <br/>
hungry or has something going on with friends or projects that has  <br/>
frustrated him or her.   Sometimes I respond with personal hurt, but  <br/>
those aren&#39;t the good times.  A better choice is to offer food, ask  <br/>
how he&#39;s feeling, and give him some space.<br/>
<br/>
Parents who take everything as a personal affront miss the  <br/>
opportunity to accept the clue that something is wrong with their  <br/>
children if they&#39;re being less courteous or civil than usual.  And it  <br/>
also makes the moment about the parent and the parents &quot;rights&quot; and  <br/>
feelings instead of about the child.<br/>
<br/>
Generosity breeds generosity.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a> is about the benefits of respecting  <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Forbidding a child to watch The Simpsons, or badmouthing The Simpsons  <br/>
to a child who thinks it&#39;s interesting, funny and thought-provoking,  <br/>
will do more damage to a child and to the relationship between that  <br/>
parent and child than any amount of watching the program could do.    <br/>
Maybe an adult who takes pride in resisting and rejecting popular  <br/>
culture and whose interests and talents don&#39;t lean toward  <br/>
interpersonal relationships wouldn&#39;t appreciate the richness of The  <br/>
Simpsons, but it&#39;s helpful for unschooling when parents can encourage  <br/>
their children to explore and enjoy even things the parents aren&#39;t  <br/>
drawn to, so that our children&#39;s worlds aren&#39;t limited by our own  <br/>
knowledge and interests, but can be bigger and broader.<br/>
<br/>
A child is more likely to talk back to a parent to prevents his  <br/>
choices and freedoms, or if he&#39;s forbidden to talk back he will start  <br/>
the countdown to time to get out.<br/>
<br/>
Without the choice to talk back to parents, how can a child choose  <br/>
not to?<br/>
If a child is &quot;forbidden&quot; (meaning will be punished if...) to talk  <br/>
back, that doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s more respectful of his parents or that  <br/>
he&#39;s a nicer, better kid.  It means he&#39;s a restricted and limited kid.<br/>
<br/>
My children are courteous by choice.  They&#39;re generous by choice.<br/>

For others, only rudely phrased or emotionally-charged negative  <br/>
responses are &quot;talking back,&quot; but literally, looking at the phrase  <br/>
itself, it&#39;s traditionally an offense  for children to &quot;talk&quot; in  <br/>
response to an adult.  Anything but &quot;yes sir&quot; is wrong, in some  <br/>
families.  &quot;Do what you&#39;re told.&quot;   Just like that.  Being commanded  <br/>
and directed and controlled.   It does as much harm to the  parent as  <br/>
to the child.  It makes the child small, but it makes the parent  <br/>
small too, and it robs them of the inestimable treasure of a close  <br/>
and open relationship.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1714412175">I know it&#39;s frustrating to feel judged.  One of the best things you can do<br/>
for yourself and your children is to let go of worrying about what other<br/>
people think, not just in unschooling, but in life.  Life is far too short<br/>
to live it trying to win other peoples&#39; approval.<br/>
<br/>
********************************************************<br/>
<br/>
Oh this is SOOOO hard.<br/>
<br/>
You know, I was just getting totally into unschooling last week and feeling totally confident (something I still struggle with) and I totally &quot;got it&quot; and then I hear other people talk and say stuff out of complete ignorance, and it just makes me question myself all over again, &quot;am I doing the right thing&quot;?  I&#39;m one of those persons who likes to keep all the options open...and I have to remind myself that with unschooling, all the options ARE open.  No door ever closes, ever.  The only difference is that learning is not on a schedule and the resources available are many more than just a textboook and a grade.<br/>
<br/>
I was just reminded today that my son took a college course, but didn&#39;t do well (it was a remedial english).  He actually tested into the higher remedial class (which was a boon to us!!), but then proceeded to not do all of the assignments etc.  I realize that some of it was an organization problem, and some of it was a motivation problem.  I guess thats what upsets me the most...why did he take the class if he wasn&#39;t going to do the work?  He enjoyed the class, and he really thought he *was* getting stuff done, but at the same time he admitted he was cutting corners.  He was only 16 at the time, so maybe it was a maturity issue.   And the professor seemed to think he just didn&#39;t have enough &quot;experience material&quot; to write about.   It just makes me question everything.  Not enough material?  I really must have failed.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, he learned other things from taking the class.  He learned that not all institutional learning is forced and unpleasant, such as it is at compulsary attendance schools.  He learned that he really likes college age friends.  And he loved being in class.  Everyone really loved his sense of humor.  It built his confidence that way, even if he didn&#39;t do well in the class.<br/>
<br/>
And yet, one year later, he has actually created an apprenticeship for himself by working with the next door neighbor doing siding etc.  It was through this neighbor that he also taught himself the drums, learned how to &quot;jam&quot; and goes on interesting field trips to watch &quot;trains&quot;, learned some photography, and aquired a nice camera.  And now, two of his other friends (who are in their late 20&#39;s, early 30&#39;s) are planning to start up an arcade kind of place with video games like for xbox and he is slated to be the av tech for the new place.  They even have the right connections to do it.  I hope it really happens for them, I&#39;m really excited about the idea.<br/>
<br/>
OBVIOUSLY he is doing really well, and this lifestyle is really working for him.  And I&quot;m convinced that no other lifestyle would have come close to meeting his needs.  And yet, even he says from time to time that he should have stayed in school because he would have learned more.<br/>
<br/>
And my youngest daughter has a friend who tells her she is going to grow up to be stupid because she isn&#39;t in school.  (Some friend! but my daughter likes to hang out with her, though less so since she started saying stuff like that).  This is the daughter who is only just reading more fluently this year, and the same one who likes to look through my college level Anatomy and Phyiology book...she&#39;s 10, and wants to be a doctor....but she still wonders if her friend is right sometimes.  Though, lately she has been saying that the problem is with the friend, not with our lifestyle.  Smart girl.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I just struggle with confidence sometimes.  I loved reading about Sandra&#39;s son taking the math class at college.  It just cemented for me the whole idea that learning is available at any time.  There is no need to put it on a schedule.  Its just hard to &quot;be&quot; in a world where so many others don&#39;t understand that.<br/>

because in their minds there are only two possibilities: either  <br/>
you&#39;re a fruitcake who can&#39;t see what obviously is necessary in order  <br/>
to raise kids or everything they&#39;re struggling with and everything  <br/>
they make their kids struggle with is unnecessary. So to protect  <br/>
themselves they have to assume you&#39;re a fruitcake.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to give out what people want to hear. Not lie to them. I just  <br/>
don&#39;t rock their boats unless they&#39;re asking questions that let me  <br/>
know they&#39;re interested in rocking ;-) To the grade question I&#39;ll  <br/>
answer &quot;She&#39;s homeschooled but she&#39;d be in 9th grade.&quot; And I don&#39;t  <br/>
say unschooling, just that her learning is based around her interests.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Simpson&#39;s doesn&#39;t cause swearing. We watch Simpsons and we don&#39;t swear.<br/>
<br/>
What causes disrespectful kids (which might be expressed by swearing)  <br/>
is being treated with disrespect.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids and some families use swear words because they&#39;re just  <br/>
words to them. Different values.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an important distinction if you want to see clearly causes  <br/>
and effects between swearing and being disrespectful. Not the same  <br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; they watch movies that I, as an adult, would<br/>
&gt; not watch.(r rated!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter has watched some movies and TV shows I wouldn&#39;t watch on  <br/>
my own either. They happen to be G and PG but the important part is  <br/>
that she has her own standards of what she likes, what satisfies her  <br/>
needs and I have mine. Lots overlap but much doesn&#39;t too. That&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling means giving them freedom (and support!) to explore the  <br/>
world. For some kids that freedom will be the ability to explore (R- <br/>
rated) horror movies but kids aren&#39;t going to watch adult movies just  <br/>
because they&#39;re given freedom. Why would they? Kids do pick and  <br/>
choose which kid movies they like and want to see. Why would they  <br/>
watch more adult movies indescriminately?<br/>
<br/>
When we divide the world between what they can and can&#39;t do/see, it&#39;s  <br/>
natural for them to want to do what they can&#39;t. When we say &quot;No, you  <br/>
can&#39;t do/watch that,&quot; we&#39;re saying we don&#39;t think they can handle  <br/>
it.  It&#39;s like setting up a challenge for them. They *want* to prove  <br/>
they&#39;re competent.<br/>
<br/>
When the world is divided between what they want to do and what they  <br/>
don&#39;t want to do, there&#39;s no reason to choose what they don&#39;t want to  <br/>
do! Though my daughter has seen a couple of R rated movies but she  <br/>
knows her personal limits on horror and has no  interest in sex so  <br/>
there&#39;s no reason for her to want to watch most R movies. Not because  <br/>
they&#39;re R but because they just don&#39;t interest her.<br/>
<br/>
I could make her want to see them by telling her she can&#39;t though! Or  <br/>
by telling her they&#39;re bad or junk.<br/>
<br/>
Since she does have the freedom to choose, since she knows I&#39;m on her  <br/>
side in trying to find what *she* wants to see (and trying to avoid  <br/>
what *she* doesn&#39;t want to see) she does trust me when I tell her  <br/>
there are scenes that she might not like. She knows I don&#39;t have an  <br/>
ulterior motive in trying to get her to see only quality, or get her  <br/>
to hone her judgement so she&#39;ll only choose what I would choose.<br/>
<br/>
And part of being a family is being exposed to what others like (what  <br/>
others think is &quot;quality&quot;) so she gets exposed to a lot she wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
grab off the shelf on her own.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I believe that if you bring your children up knowing quality they will<br/>
&gt; recognize &quot;ugly&quot; in an instant! So far that is true.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, what they learn to recognize is what the parents&#39; standards of  <br/>
quality are. They learn &quot;This is what Mom thinks is good and this is  <br/>
what Mom thinks is bad.&quot; But that doesn&#39;t give them an internal  <br/>
barometer to judge something new, especially if they aren&#39;t exposed  <br/>
to bad! They only have a vague impression from some external  <br/>
qualities of what constitutes &quot;bad&quot; without actually experiencing and  <br/>
deciding for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Judgement comes from trying things out, not memorizing what others  <br/>
think is good and bad. Good (and quality) and bad are relative terms.  <br/>
Lots of people would judge a lot of what I watched and read when I  <br/>
was a child as &quot;bad&quot; (though now it&#39;s classic junk ;-) but it  <br/>
satisfied something I needed at the time that more &quot;quality&quot; shows  <br/>
and books didn&#39;t meet.<br/>
<br/>
*Because* I had the freedom to choose what met my needs and what  <br/>
didn&#39;t meet them I was able to decide *for myself* what is quality  <br/>
*for me*. I can see that Lost in Space isn&#39;t &quot;quality&quot; (even knew it  <br/>
at the time). I can see that &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Still&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; are deeper but though I enjoyed them they didn&#39;t  <br/>
satisfy my needs at the time.<br/>
<br/>
No one needed to tell me what quality was. I figured it out for  <br/>
myself by watching what I liked, talking about what I liked and  <br/>
didn&#39;t, listening to others and exploring freely.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to ask yourself what is &quot;quality&quot;? Is it decided by  <br/>
experts and everyone goes along? If so what relevance does it have if  <br/>
someone doesn&#39;t like something deemed &quot;quality&quot;?<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t even know those moves&#39; names if they weren&#39;t in a song in  <br/>
Rocky Horror Picture Show (rated R).<br/>
<br/>
I know some young adults/later teens who would not attend a G rated  <br/>
movie, because they don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; or they&#39;re too old.  My kids  <br/>
choose movies without regard to their ratings, and are perfectly  <br/>
happy to watch &quot;tame&quot; movies, family movies, because they choose  <br/>
their movies by what they feel like seeing at the time, and their  <br/>
tastes are broad.   Holly suggested that I buy Marty a CD of The  <br/>
Little Mermaid when we were out shopping the other day, because he  <br/>
really likes &quot;Kiss the Girl.&quot;  How many nearly-17-year-old boys might  <br/>
be embarrassed to get that for Christmas?  But I bought him R-rated  <br/>
Kevin Smith movies three years ago.<br/>
<br/>
In the past few days my kids have watched, in various combinations,  <br/>
the new War of the Worlds (Kirby warned me about one scary part  <br/>
because I was in the room), some of the BBC series &quot;The Office,&quot;  <br/>
Holly and I watched the Talky Tina episode of Twilight Zone (&quot;Living  <br/>
Doll&quot;), PeeWee&#39;s Big Adventure, Deadwood (Marty was watching it on  <br/>
DVD while I was cutting his hair, because he just got a job that  <br/>
needs a haircut).   None of those movies will make them rude,  <br/>
paranoid or dangerous.   Thoughts and discussions born of those  <br/>
movies will make them more thoughtful, aware of art/history/ <br/>
literature/geography/theatre/moviemaking, and it strengthens their  <br/>
relationships within the family to have shared experiences.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think of all the things I&#39;ve learned from other unschoolers online  <br/>
over the years the most helpful to me of all was the concept of  <br/>
having only moments, not days.  Someone, and I wish someone would  <br/>
remember who, a dozen years ago on AOL&#39;s message boards, said that  <br/>
she never said she was &quot;having a bad day,&quot; only that she was having a  <br/>
bad moment.<br/>
<br/>
That really stuck with me and has made a difference in hundreds of  <br/>
thousands of moments.<br/>
<br/>
When a person says &quot;bad day,&quot; it condemns the hours before bedtime.   <br/>
But any bad moment can be turned around, and the NEXT moment can be  <br/>
better, and maybe even GREAT!<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, at our house people don&#39;t get up on the wrong side of the  <br/>
bed.   I think if I woke them up with chores they might, but I try to  <br/>
let them wake up naturally unless they&#39;ve requested a wake-up.   If  <br/>
they don&#39;t wake up naturally, it&#39;s either me (at their request) or an  <br/>
alarm (one they&#39;ve set), usually, and they get up cheerfully.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s possible to make moments and mornings better, and to expect  <br/>
better and to plan for better, it&#39;s worth doing.   Saying &quot;everyone  <br/>
has bad days&quot; is an Eeyore moment, I think, and though I had what  <br/>
seemed to be lots of bad days when I was a kid, and in my 20&#39;s, I  <br/>
don&#39;t anymore, and my kids don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Maslow said that learning works better (or more specifically it can&#39;t  <br/>
really happen at all) when a person feels safe and loved (and is fed  <br/>
and rested).  That&#39;s an important consideration when creating and  <br/>
maintaining an unschooling nest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1941253580">Her point was that it is hypocritical for parents to expect children  <br/>
to be in absolutely perfectly shining happy moods ALL the time and  <br/>
call it &quot;talking back&quot; when a kid expresses a negative point of view,  <br/>
gets irritated or angry, or behaves in any way less than perfectly.  <br/>
Unless parents are truly absolutely perfect and NEVER have a &quot;lesser  <br/>
moment&quot; themselves  - then it isn&#39;t fair to expect our children to  <br/>
never have a &quot;lesser moment,&quot; either.<br/>
<br/>
That isn&#39;t the same as expecting and accepting bad moments - it is  <br/>
recognizing that most of us  DO have some better and some worse  <br/>
times. We may be trying to put more positivity into the mix and we  <br/>
may be succeeding at that - but no matter how much we strive for  <br/>
perfection, most of us still have times we get overwhelmed, tired, a  <br/>
little frustrated, or a bit impatient.<br/>
<br/>
Since WE are likely to be less than perfect, it seems unreasonable to  <br/>
expect children to always BE perfect and to get annoyed with them and  <br/>
call it &quot;talking back,&quot; when they express themselves negatively in  <br/>
some way.<br/>
<br/>
Much better to consider WHY they are feeling negative - do they need  <br/>
food, attention, support, quiet, rest, etc., then to just say they&#39;re  <br/>
not &quot;allowed&quot; to &quot;talk back.&quot;<br/>

Not all options are open.  My kids didn&#39;t have the chance (chance,  <br/>
not guarantee) to do really sparkly well in school and have that on a  <br/>
college application.   It&#39;s a LOT of work to do what  has to be done  <br/>
for the usually-small advantage of having something impressive on a  <br/>
college application, and people can do the same amount of work and  <br/>
NOT be top of the class or honor roll.   But in any case, that door  <br/>
was closed for them long ago.<br/>
<br/>
Still, it&#39;s possible that they could make really good grades in  <br/>
college if they felt the making-good-grades door was closing.<br/>

I really think the damage of pressure isn&#39;t worth the *possible*  <br/>

toward money-making and get him out of the house at 18.<br/>

Deadlines on doors is way more door-closing than anything, I think.    <br/>
And those deadlines are often arbitrary or based on counting  <br/>
backwards from retirement for optimal retirement benefit.  If a  <br/>
parent acts as though a kid who isn&#39;t in college at 20 has thrown his  <br/>
life away, that&#39;s a parental claim, not a truth.  Keith graduated  <br/>
when he was nearly 30 and had many fun adventures earlier, when  <br/>
others his age were working toward retirement.  A few of them gambled  <br/>
and lost on that; they didn&#39;t live to retirement.<br/>
<br/>
All that, for me, points toward peace in the moment, and  <br/>
encouragement and acceptance and other mushy stuff. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  This is so true!<br/>
  I have four daughters, one is 23 and another just turned 18 December 1.  I am grateful that they still want to be home.  I know they are here by choice and that feels really nice.  My 23 yr old plans to graduate from college in one more year.  It took her longer because she wanted to explore different areas, and take certain classes for fun.  She didn&#39;t focus on a degree program right away.<br/>
  My 18 year old is still &#39;unschooling&#39;.  She is still doing the same stuff she was doing a couple of weeks ago when she was 17.  Just because a birthday passes doesn&#39;t mean they have to be finished being kids.  I think having an expectation of when kids are supposed to be ready to &#39;graduate&#39; or grow up is very schoolish thinking.  They should be allowed to become independent in their own time, in their own way, under circumstances that bring them joy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212607832">No one can go through all the doors in the world at the same time,  <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
We choose not to go through some doors, right?  You said your son  <br/>
sometimes says he should&#39;ve gone to school.  If he HAD gone to  <br/>
school, he&#39;d probably be saying he wished he had been home more.<br/>
<br/>
Not all options are open. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
************************<br/>
<br/>
I know that there are realistic barriers to things, like money and time, and geography.  But that doesn&#39;t mean the door is closed forever though...just at the moment.  I still think the options are open, just, as you said, not at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
And its true, we have to make choices and that limits our options too, but not because the options aren&#39;t open.  My son chose to stay home because I always said he could go to school if he wanted to. He could have changed his mind at any time.<br/>
<br/>
It bothers me though that he thinks sometimes that he would have learned more in school.  In the past he would get angry and say &quot;you don&#39;t teach us anything&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Mainly its because he (and the other 2) sometimes compare what they are doing at home with what goes on at school and they think that we&#39;re deficient because they aren&#39;t learning all the same stuff at the same time as their peers.  And then other times my youngest will say &quot;but we get to do what we want, and do it at our own pace&quot; and although she liked some aspects of school, she doesn&#39;t know if she&#39;ll ever go back.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I need to emphasize that whatever they choose is really ok with me, but it is a choice, *because* we can&#39;t do everything all at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
Often times I will offer to do stuff, like play a game, etc, and they turn me down in favor of their xanga sites, which is fine.  But then they blame me because we didn&#39;t &quot;do anything&quot; that day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just tired of being the scapegoat at times like those.<br/>

<br/>
I think that would help me if I were a kid.  My mom said &quot;you can be  <br/>
anything you want&quot; but that wasn&#39;t really true.  If she&#39;d been saying  <br/>
&quot;You can do anything you&#39;ve missed later,&quot; I would KNOW that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
true.   Anyone who never gets a tattoo will never have one.  Those  <br/>
who did will never again have the option NOT to have had one.  Minor  <br/>
example, but a little like school.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who went to school (K-12 or the compulsory equivalent in the  <br/>
country of the reader)  lost the chance to never have gone.  Those  <br/>
who didn&#39;t go lost the chance to have had a first day of school at a  <br/>
very young age, and to learn about love on the playground, and about  <br/>
sex in the bathrooms, etc.  My kids don&#39;t know how to ditch school.    <br/>
They don&#39;t know what &quot;a hallpass&quot; is or how one would get one or  <br/>
why.  Lots of doors are fine to leave closed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hallpasses and knowing how to ditch won&#39;t guarantee nor prevent  <br/>
anyone from going to grad school and becoming an astronaut/doctor/ <br/>
lawyer/whatever.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of things that can prevent a person from becoming  <br/>
president (or at least make it very VERY unlikely), for another  <br/>
example.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/president">http://sandradodd.com/president</a><br/>

Maybe emphasize that whatever they choose needs to be okay with them,  <br/>
too.<br/>

<br/>
What a perfect way to look at it.<br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;s a natural desire to leave, in kids in their later  <br/>
teens, early 20&#39;s.  They do start looking around, and the nest does  <br/>
seem to be shrinking.   But too many families exacerbate that and the  <br/>
kids are ready to leave at sixteen, or thirteen.     And for some  <br/>
kids, the clock is ticking, and they will, like ticks, jump on the  <br/>
nearest-passing other dog at that age.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the best metaphor I ever mixed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If home is not comfortable and safe, it won&#39;t take much to lure them  <br/>
out.  Parents can set the bar SO LOW that running away or leaving  <br/>
with someone the kid hardly knows seems better and safer.  YUCK!<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I have joked about how our kids will only leave for someone  <br/>
who owns a home and is REALLY nice if we keep up the way we are.  And  <br/>
that&#39;s not a bad deal in any way.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll only leave under circumstances that bring them joy.  I really  <br/>
like that.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that your husband was able to do this.<br/>
<br/>
I am still in college at 32 - (graduate school) and have taken courses of<br/>
interest here and there. My Dad especially stressed the importance of<br/>
education - and that I was brilliant and could do anything I wanted etc. -<br/>
but there were other issues and I did exactly what you were saying about the<br/>
fleas jumping to the next dog. I left the day after high school<br/>
graduation -and was married a year later. I am still married (happily...)<br/>
with three children (luckily - the next dog was a really great one! - but<br/>
that doesn&#39;t always happen). Sometimes I wonder if I would have done some<br/>
other things - before getting married. I always wanted to travel a bit and<br/>
would have liked to figure out what I wanted out of life. I still don&#39;t<br/>
really know what I want to do when I &quot;grow up&quot; . However, this is case in<br/>
point of the school system - I came out high honors and top of the class -<br/>
clueless as to what I really wanted to do with life. In college, I was sure<br/>
I was going to work on Wall street - and then came to the conclusion that I<br/>
really dislike big cities and that whole atmosphere - and I much prefer the<br/>
country. I think there are many people that follow the prescribed high<br/>
school/college/making money path and then find out that they didn&#39;t really<br/>
want to be a doctor, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I think the great thing for my kids is watching them develop their passions.<br/>
My daughter who loves cooking can spend hours watching cooking shows and<br/>
then she&#39;ll go in the kitchen and experiment with bread. I wasn&#39;t even<br/>
allowed in the kitchen when I was her age (11). She is already a great baker<br/>
and cook and won&#39;t have to wait until &quot;someday&quot; to become one - because she<br/>
can practice now. I know that if she chooses to go to college it will be<br/>
because she wants to - and not because she thinks that&#39;s the next step - the<br/>
only option.<br/>
<br/>
I will share this - my parents put so much emphasis on going to school - and<br/>
college being the whole way to make you happy and successful - that I had a<br/>
huge guilt feeling that I couldn&#39;t do anything worthwhile without the piece<br/>
of paper. Well, now I have the piece of paper - and really I am the same<br/>
person I was before - and am still waiting for the genius to set it!(just<br/>
kidding) It was talked about like it was the magic spell of security and<br/>
that if only you had that degree you can do anything. I have found that it<br/>
simply isn&#39;t true - that in some cases it will open doors - but what matters<br/>
more is doing whatever it is that you love - and being able to get in there<br/>
and muck around in life.<br/>
