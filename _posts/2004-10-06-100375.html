  Hey, I hadn&#39;t thought of that!<br/>
<br/>
  I used to eat lots of party food too.  Now I don&#39;t. <br/>
  My kids never have.<br/>

  That&#39;s all very interesting and thinking back to parties Margaux went to without me, I&#39;d always ask about the food.  At the last party she went to over labor day, she said she had some pretzels and two cups of soda.  Said the lady wouldn&#39;t let her have any more soda.  But there were all kinds of goodies there, and she just ate pretzels.  Also made me realize that I don&#39;t keep enough soda on hand for her.  Yes, that&#39;s my own thing.  I get her candy, and pretty much whatever she asks for, but I don&#39;t get soda.  She doesn&#39;t ask though.  Hmmmm... funny.  I&#39;ll have to watch her a little more when we&#39;re in the soda aisles.  I used to buy a lot of diet soda, but didn&#39;t want her to drink it, so I&#39;d split it with her.  Yeah, that doesn&#39;t make any sense at all.  Oy.  Lately, though, I&#39;ve been getting her and my husband some regular soda.  Hmm, yeah, better watch the sitch more closely.<br/>
