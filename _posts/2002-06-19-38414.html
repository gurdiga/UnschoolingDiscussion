<br/>
As far as my potty training experience went - they did it when they were ready. If I tried to force them, it never worked. It just got everyone upset and angry. The summer is the best time to just let them go natural. Supposedly this, allows them to make more of a connection between their bodily functions. Also having the diaper sometimes keeps them a little too dry - and therefore they don&#39;t tend to associate going in the potty with being dry. Now, using this method we had lots of accidents! - but most could be cleaned up pretty easily. I would add that my 3 yr. old daughter still uses a pull-up at night. I have tried stopping the drinks at 6 PM etc. but I always felt mean - when they cry for a drink - so that didn&#39;t last. A pull-up seems easier than having to change sheets in the middle of the night. My son was about 3 when he was totally potty trained. As much as we tried to get him to go in the potty he just wouldn&#39;t. Then all of the sudden we were at a friends pool party - and he decided he wanted to go to the potty. and he pretty much was potty trained from then on - even at night. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, I think that yes, children will just do it when they are ready. Someone once said to me - how many adults do you see still in diapers? (ones without incontenience of course ;) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-309943">Here is what we did.<br/>
<br/>
With our first son, we used only cloth diapers the whole time.  I think it<br/>
is better because they feel yucky and wet.  The disposables wisk away all<br/>
the moisture and maybe keep them more comfortable, thus an inscentive not<br/>
the potty train.  When he started hiding in the corners for a bowl movement,<br/>
and asking to have his diaper changed (around 3), we changed to cotton<br/>
training underpants.  Well.........he was not fully night trained until<br/>
after 5 years old.  He did fine during the day, but he slept so hard (he is<br/>
a sleepwalker) that he simply could not get up during the night.  At first,<br/>
when the training pants were new to him, when he would pee in them, we made<br/>
no big deal about it, but would say how it feels yucky to be wet, and if he<br/>
used the toilet it would not feel yucky.  We also let him go around with<br/>
nothing on from the waist down, so he could  see what was happening and use<br/>
the toilet easier.<br/>
<br/>
With our other two sons, we used disposable (cloth with three kids was not<br/>
realistic for me at the time).  Our middle guy at 2 years old said &quot;no more<br/>
diaper Mommy&quot;.  He had already been dry for a good month during the night.<br/>
We stopped using diapers, and used the cotton training pants, and he never<br/>
had any accidents, so we switched to underwear.<br/>
<br/>
Our youngest, was also potty trained close to two years old, on his own<br/>
asking, to be like big brothers and big friends.  I think that fact helped a<br/>
whole lot.<br/>
<br/>
From my own experience, and from the experience of friends, the more YOU<br/>
push, the less they feel like they want to do it.  I do highly encourage<br/>
those cotton training pants however, not the pullups that they have out.<br/>
Less convenient, but less expensive, and I believe a better way to go.<br/>

completely different animals.  My kids were all reliably using the toilet <br/>
around age 3.  My daughter still had some accidents at night until she was <br/>
6.  My boys were both wet almost every night until they were into their <br/>
early teens.   I was almost 12.<br/>
There&#39;s nothing you can do about it.  I tried restricting fluids, night <br/>
waking, even medication with the older one.  If they are deep sleepers, <br/>
they aren&#39;t going to wake up at night.  Somewhere along the way, their <br/>
sleep becomes a little less deep, and they start waking up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257908859">My first son at age of 28 months  told me he was a big<br/>
boy and he didn&#39;t wear diapers  and he never had an<br/>
accident until public school.    The second one  I<br/>
introduced a potty chair (which he picked out)  for<br/>
his 2nd birthday the potty chair was only used a<br/>
couple of times.   Finally at his 3rd birthday we made<br/>
an agreement that if he wouldn&#39;t wet his pants  he<br/>
didn&#39;t have to wear a diaper  and he got to pee on the<br/>
tree of his choice in our back yard.   I bought<br/>
several boys swimsuits  because it is easier to pull<br/>
up and down just one thing than shorts and underwear<br/>
both.   He used the tree to pee when we were home  and<br/>
peed his pants any other time  and always just did #2<br/>
in his pants.  Now he is almost four  and I realized<br/>
sometime over the winter he decided the toilet was<br/>
better then exposing himself out in the cold  and he<br/>
never has accidents.   I suppose he just was ready<br/>
finally.   From what I have heard from other people <br/>
the more you try to force kids to toilet train the<br/>
more resistance you get from them.   Anytime you can <br/>
let him use cloth training pants or underwear  that<br/>
way he gets the icky feeling of getting and staying<br/>
wet until he takes his underwear off.  Otherwise you<br/>
probably should just let him figure it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19638273">Coming out of lurkdom for this one! One of the main reasons that unschooling appeals to me is that I have seen how my son does things better and easier on his own time. Potty training was one of those things. We got the potty seat at 2. Just talked about it a bit and then left it there. Jason showed no interest. Sometime around 3 I started talking to him about using the toilet, being aware of the signs. Somewhere around 3.5 I started panicking wondering if he really would do it on his own. I thought that he was ready (he would ask me to use the bathroom at the pool but never at home). I convinced him to wear training pants (cotton) one day. He had 3 accidents within a couple of hours that morning...the funny thing is that he never goes to the bathroom that much that early normally. I took that to mean &quot;back off mom&quot;! LOL! I backed off, just kept talking about when he was ready he would do it. Just occasionally. Kept looking for what would motivate him. Then his best friend potty trained and started talking about his batman underwear. Jason said that it sounded cool (I had mentioned getting underwear to him before, but he had never shown any interest). We went shopping and bought batman, thomas the tank, bugs bunny, taz you name it. We put them on when we got home. He had one accident outside in the garden the next day and that was it. He was trained literally overnight (poop and pee). I kept him in pull-ups at night, but after a few weeks, I realized that I was not even checking to see if he was wet in the morning. Started checking and found out that he was dry and we were night time trained. Had 3 night time accidents that is it.<br/>
<br/>
He was ready and he did it. Luckily I actually felt (and feel!) that diapers were easier, so I was willing to wait. The hardest part was dealing with people who kept telling me that he would never do it on his own, that I would have to &quot;make&quot; him. The funny thing is, these same moms (whose kids were actively trained by or before 3) were still having poop issues at 4.5 (one still got a &quot;poopy&quot; prize for pooping on the toilet and the other was into major control issues and refusing to poop on the toilet). Going to the bathroom is not an issue here...never has been. I never sat and read stories. We never watched toilet training kid videos. I never made Jason try to go before we went out...if he said he did not have to go, he didn&#39;t. We never had to reward him for going. It really was incredibly easy. And as far as I can tell, he is not behind in any way because he was &quot;late&quot; to train LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Now Kyle, my 2 yo is already asking to use the toilet occasionally and actually pooped in it the other day LOL! But he has the motivation of seeing his big brother use it and wanting to be like him. I actually found myself trying to convince him that he did not want to use the toilet the other day...now I have to worry that Kyle will want to wear underwear before he is really ready. But that seems to be the story of my life...trying to convince my 5 yo that he can brush his own teeth while explaining to my 2 yo that mommy still needs to do his.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing how Jason really does have his own timetable for doing things (potty training, getting himself dressed, talking, writing his name you name it) has really led me to unschooling. He has time and time again shown me that if I let him take the lead, he will do and learn what he needs to. And if I try to impose my schedule on him, I will run into a brick wall.... now if I can just remember that...<br/>
<br/>
Good luck. It will happen. :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A wait and see approach is a great approach! ;o) The summer Jack turned 3 we <br/>
worked on it and even though everyone said that boys are harder to potty <br/>
train than girls, you will never convince me of that! Then he got sick and <br/>
had to have his appendix out that August. We spent 18 days in the hospital <br/>
and they put him in diapers since he couldn&#39;t get out of bed for a while. I <br/>
thought when we came home it was going to be so hard to get him out of <br/>
diapers, but it wasn&#39;t. He went right back to using the potty by himself. <br/>
Before the hospital, he was still not accident free at night, but when we <br/>
came home, he had really changed. People picking and poking at him really <br/>
bothered him. (understandably) He told his dad that no one was going to be <br/>
bugging him about the potty any more and he wouldn&#39;t have any more accidents <br/>
at night, because he didn&#39;t want to be touched! I felt so bad for my little <br/>
guy, it was so hard for him. But on the upside, he was so determined, he <br/>
didn&#39;t have any more accidents. <br/>
OTOH with his older sister, I had all sorts of pressure from people like my <br/>
MIL who swore all her kids were potty trained by the age of 18 months, that I <br/>
worked constantly with Moly and the result was a child who resisted using the <br/>
potty for two years. She finally did it on her own at 3 1/2 almost 4. But <br/>
still had accidents at night until she was almost 7. I learned later from <br/>
Darin&#39;s older sister that all the kids in the family might have been potty <br/>
trained at 18 months, BUT had continuos accidents until 7 or 8 and one of <br/>
Darin&#39;s older brothers had night accidents up into his teens! <br/>
I will never (if I ever have any more kids) push the potty!!! My best friend <br/>
had great success with draining her toilet, drying it with a towel and <br/>
painting a bulls eye in red fingernail polish at the back of it. Her little <br/>
boy loved &quot;aiming&quot; at the target! Jack liked it too, when we went over. They <br/>
thought it was really cool. ;o) <br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858964621">About 4 months ago I finally had had it, when I had to clean one more disgusting diarreha diaper that he had been in for over an hour without telling me he needed a change. So disgusted and frustrated withe the rashes I told him that that was it. No more diapers. As of the following morning Shawn was in regular underwear-not training pants- and has had 3 night accidents and probably 3 wet and 3 poop accidents in these last 4 months. <br/>
<br/>
I think so much of it has to do with KNOWING your child.  Apparently he was ready--which is good because I was sooooo ready. He was 3.5 yrs old when I finally put my foot down. My daughter who is now 14 months old, regularly goes to the toilet to sit on and usually pees at least once a day on it (will go to sit perhaps 3-5 times). This is purely her own initiative. We have not done potty chairs, only the inserts. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857459174">I was a year ago this next month that Davy had surgery.  He had an <br/>
undescended testicle, and is at risk even after the surgery to have <br/>
testicular cancer when he is older.  We had the surgery done because <br/>
after the age of two, the testes that aren&#39;t descended are damaged be <br/>
the body heat.  We wanted him to have a better chance at fertility when <br/>
he was older.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the things we regret about the surgery:<br/>
<br/>
They retracted his foreskin without our permission<br/>
He screamed every time we tried to take off his clothes or change his <br/>
diaper for a couple of months after the surgery<br/>
He had showed a little interest in the potty chair before, but after he <br/>
won&#39;t even touch himself.   Just now getting to where he jokes about it <br/>
being an Elephant... lol<br/>

 </span></blockquote>April, <br/>
<br/>
With our oldest (who&#39;s now almost 13), we took a real<br/>
hands-off approach to potty training. When he was<br/>
about 18 months old, I put a potty chair in each of<br/>
the bathrooms. I bought potty chairs that looked like<br/>
&quot;little toilets&quot;, because in my mind, it would make<br/>
more sense to the little guy, but I don&#39;t really know<br/>
if that made a difference or not.<br/>
<br/>
Then I just left them there. Nothing else. He saw<br/>
others using the big toilet, and eventually wanted to<br/>
do the same. He was potty trained by the time he was 2<br/>
years, 3 months (except night time, which came quite a<br/>
bit later.)<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is just my experience with one, and our<br/>
younger son, Will, is now 20 months old, so we&#39;ve<br/>
placed the potties again! We&#39;ll see if it works for<br/>
him, too. Already I&#39;ve seen him mimic<br/>
standing-and-peeing while standing in front of the<br/>
toilet, so I&#39;m hopeful!<br/>
<br/>
It was just really important to me for it NOT to be a<br/>
cause of strife or stress, but a natural progression,<br/>
so we were/are very casual about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s helpful to you, since your<br/>
child&#39;s 3 right now, but I do believe they&#39;ll catch on<br/>
eventually. I&#39;ve seen among friends of ours that<br/>
around 3, &quot;peer pressure&quot; can kick in. When all their<br/>
friends use the potty and they&#39;re still in diapers,<br/>
that seems to be good motivation for some kids!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
<br/>

beginning to wonder if our son had problems. He is 3 and a half and hasn&#39;t<br/>
worn a nappy during the day since about 2 1/2 but still wears one at<br/>
nighttime - this is no big deal as he still breastfeeds at night. However he<br/>
refuses to go to the toilet or potty. He wees and poos in the corners of the<br/>
room or he goes outside to do it. We have tried not to make a big deal out<br/>
of it but say something like - maybe next time you can go to the toilet. He<br/>
refuses to and if we ask whether there are any reasons he just says no I<br/>
just don&#39;t want to. We were wondering ourselves if may be we should be doing<br/>
something else or just wait till when he is ready.<br/>

I got to puke in a silver punchbowl held by a baroness once.  That&#39;s artsy.  <br/>
That&#39;s one thing the SCA has done for me.   A bunch of us (thousands) were <br/>
camping in Pennsylvania once and there was a plague.  A third of the people <br/>
there got sick, and when I got home I got a call from the Center for Disease <br/>
Control, not because I had been sick, but because I was the CEO of the <br/>
organization.  It was cute, really.  They asked for stats and symptoms, and <br/>
then asked where the people had gone afterward.  It was every province in <br/>
Canada, at least 40 states in the U.S., two parts of Australia, England and <br/>
Sweden.<br/>

what is the difference of pooing in a container than into a potty - however<br/>
&#39;how dare we tell him where to poo&#39; - does not like to be told where he can<br/>
do his business. I know it is our own (myself and my partner) hangups of<br/>
what is appropriate or not. I think what concerns me is his real obsession<br/>
that he must poo in a certain spot or else he becomes very distressed - and<br/>
the fact that a member of the extended family has OCD. My worries I suppose.<br/>

&lt;&lt;This sounds like a whole lot of fun - well not for the one having to clean<br/>
up the mess. Do you think that this would encourage him to ever go to the<br/>
toilet??&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well bowls wash easily, and other stuff could be put in plastic bags and into <br/>
the trash.<br/>
<br/>
But my thinking about it leading to the toilet was that if it&#39;s no longer a <br/>
personal, sneaky thing but a spotlighted project, he might prefer the privacy <br/>
of a flush toilet in a little room with a door.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a good analogy, but it just popped into my head.  What if a kid with <br/>
a really sneaky drug-experimentation project going had his mom take an <br/>
interest, and photograph and document it all, and interview his friends, and <br/>
send Polaroids to grandma of him posed with his paraphernalia, and make a <br/>
chart of which drugs he had tried, how many times, and which ones were left <br/>
to experiment with.  They could use it to teach statistics and graphing and <br/>
scientific method!<br/>
<br/>
It is my hypothesis (which I&#39;m willing not to test &lt;g&gt;) that the boy would <br/>
lose interest in his hobby pretty quickly, and perhaps even develop an <br/>
aversion.<br/>
<br/>
I did test the overload/aversion thing once, in a friendly way, with Marty <br/>
who had bugged me for French fries, French fries, FRENCH FRIES!  He wanted me <br/>
to make them for him, BUY them for him, get him some more.   So one afternoon <br/>
with a block of time and some money on me, I said &quot;Let&#39;s go get fries,&quot; and <br/>
the two of us went.  I said &quot;Let&#39;s try all the drive-through places&#39; fries <br/>
and see which are best.  I thought Blakes.  He thought maybe Wendy&#39;s.  We <br/>
went to Sonic (chile cheese fries!), Burger King, Blakes, and I forget where <br/>
else (four places, I think, though) before he was saying &quot;No more mom, let&#39;s <br/>
go home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was a long time before he said &quot;fries.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t do it out of hostility or sarcasm, but just as a goofy thing to do.  <br/>
The effect was such, though, that I would consider the method in future if I <br/>
really wanted to get someone OFF of a fixation.<br/>
