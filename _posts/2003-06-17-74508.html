Home-schooling standoff in Waltham<br/>

<br/>
WALTHAM -- A legal battle over two home-schooled children <br/>
exploded into<br/>
a seven-hour standoff yesterday, when they refused to take a<br/>
<br/>
standardized test ordered by the Department of Social Services.<br/>
<br/>
George Nicholas Bryant, <br/>
15, and Nyssa Bryant, 13, stood behind their<br/>
parents, Kim and George, as police <br/>
and DSS workers attempted to collect<br/>
the children at 7:45 a.m. DSS demanded <br/>
that the two complete a test to<br/>
determine their educational level.<br/>
<br/>
After a court <br/>
order was issued by Framingham Juvenile Court around 1<br/>
p.m., the children were <br/>
driven by their parents to a Waltham hotel.<br/>
<br/>
Again, they refused to take the test.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The court order said that the children must be here. It said nothing<br/>
about <br/>
taking the test,&quot; said George Bryant.<br/>
<br/>
The second refusal came after an <br/>
emotion-filled morning for the family,<br/>
when DSS workers sternly demanded the Bryants <br/>
comply with their orders.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have legal custody of the children and we will do with <br/>
them as we<br/>
see fit,&quot; DSS worker Susan Etscovitz told the Bryants in their Gale<br/>
<br/>
Street home. &quot;They are minors and they do what we tell them to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Four police <br/>
officers were also at the scene and attempted to coax the<br/>
Bryants to listen to <br/>
the DSS worker.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are simply here to prevent a breach of the peace,&quot; said <br/>
Waltham<br/>
Youth Officer Detective James Auld. &quot;We will will not physically remove<br/>
<br/>
the children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday&#39;s events are the continuation of a six-year legal battle<br/>
<br/>
between the family and Waltham Public Schools and the state.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants <br/>
contend that the city and state do not have the legal right<br/>
to force their children <br/>
to take standardized tests, even though DSS<br/>
workers have threatened to take <br/>
their children from them.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There have been threats all along. Most families fall to <br/>
that bullying<br/>
by the state and the legal system,&quot; said George Bryant.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But this <br/>
has been a six-year battle between the Waltham Public Schools<br/>
and our family <br/>
over who is in control of the education of our children,&quot;<br/>
Bryant continued. &quot;In <br/>
the end the law of this state will protect us.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Bryant children have never <br/>
attended public school.<br/>
<br/>
Both sides agree that the children are in no way abused <br/>
mentally,<br/>
physically, sexually or emotionally, but legal custody of the <br/>
children<br/>
was taken from Kim and George Bryant in December 2001. The children will<br/>
<br/>
remain under the legal custody of DSS until their 16th birthdays.<br/>
<br/>
The parents have <br/>
been ruled as unfit because they did not file<br/>
educational plans or determine a <br/>
grading system for the children, two<br/>
criteria of Waltham Public School&#39;s home <br/>
schooling policy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We do not believe in assessing our children based on a number <br/>
or<br/>
letter. Their education process is their personal intellectual<br/>
property,&quot; <br/>
said Bryant.<br/>
<br/>
George Bryant said he was arrested six years ago, after not <br/>
attending a<br/>
meeting that the city contends he was summoned to. The meeting was<br/>
called by <br/>
the Waltham School Department for his failure to send his<br/>
children to school.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We want these issues aired in the open, in public. The school system<br/>
and DSS <br/>
have fought to keep this behind closed doors,&quot; said Bryant.<br/>
<br/>
Superintendent of <br/>
Schools Susan Parrella said she was unaware of<br/>
yesterday&#39;s incident and that, <br/>
currently the school department approves<br/>
of the education plan filed by DSS for the <br/>
Bryant children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;An acceptable home school plan is in place right now,&quot; said <br/>
Parrella.<br/>
&quot;I was not aware of any testing occurring today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Bryant children <br/>
freely admit that they have no intention of taking a<br/>
test.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t want to <br/>
take the test. We have taken them before and I don&#39;t<br/>
think they are a fair <br/>
assessment of what we know,&quot; said Nyssa Bryant.<br/>
&quot;And no one from DSS has ever asked us <br/>
what we think.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kenneth Pontes, area director of DSS, denied that workers have <br/>
never<br/>
talked to the children privately, but admitted that this type of case<br/>
<br/>
isn&#39;t often seen by his office.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is an unusual case. Different school systems <br/>
require different<br/>
regulations for home-schooled children. Waltham requires <br/>
testing,&quot; said<br/>
Pontes.<br/>
<br/>
Pontes said that a possibility exists that the children will <br/>
be removed<br/>
from their home, but that was a last course of action.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No one wants <br/>
these children to be put in foster homes. The best course<br/>
of action would for <br/>
(the Bryants) to instruct the children to take the<br/>
test,&quot; said Etscovitz.<br/>
<br/>
The <br/>
Bryant family is due in Framingham District Court this morning, to<br/>
go before a <br/>
juvenile court judge. According to DSS, this session will<br/>
determine what their <br/>
next course of action will be and if the children<br/>
will be removed from the <br/>
Bryants&#39; home.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;These are our children and they have and always will be willing<br/>
<br/>
participants in their education,&quot; said Kim Bryant.<br/>

wonderful when people stand up for what they believe in, but SURELY there are <br/>
less damaging ways of dealing with this than having your children taken away <br/>
from you. I think it&#39;s scary that these people would rather risk losing their <br/>
children than move or invalidate the tests.<br/>
<br/>
More power to them if they succeed. But at what price?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This case isn&#39;t what it seems from the surface. They Bryants&#39;s stance isn&#39;t<br/>
about homeschooling at all. It&#39;s about whether the state has a right to make<br/>
laws beyond the state constitution. (At least as far as I&#39;m able to<br/>
understand the legal mumbo jumbo. I think the term for their beliefs is<br/>
Constitutionalists.) The Bryants have been using their homeschooling for<br/>
years as a vehicle to make a point about the constitution.<br/>
<br/>
They lost. Because they still refused to comply with Mass case law on<br/>
homeschooling, the state took over legal (but not physical) custody of their<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;We do not believe in assessing our children based on a number or letter.<br/>
&gt; Their education process is their personal intellectual property,&quot; said Bryant.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In Mass the school district can ask for some form of yearly assessment, but<br/>
the type needs to be approved by the parents. (I just send in a couple of<br/>
sentences on each subject each year.) Since the state is the children&#39;s<br/>
legal guardians the state, therefore, according to the case law, gets to<br/>
determine the form of assessment. The Bryants lost their right to make<br/>
decisions for their children when legal custody was taken away.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kenneth Pontes, area director of DSS, denied that workers have never talked to<br/>
&gt; the children privately, but admitted that this type of case isn&#39;t often seen<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;This is an unusual case. Different school systems require different<br/>
&gt; regulations for home-schooled children. Waltham requires testing,&quot; said<br/>
&gt; Pontes.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is incorrect. In Mass a school district can&#39;t require testing. The<br/>
parents (or legal guardians) get to approve the form of assessment.<br/>
<br/>
(The case law isn&#39;t totally clear on many homeschooling issues. Perhaps when<br/>
backed into a corner a school district can pull out wording that implies<br/>
they can offer a limited number of assessments and the parents get to pick<br/>
from just those.)<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing&#39;s a mess. In their determination to make other points the<br/>
Bryants could end up forcing the state to create clear -- and more difficult<br/>
-- homeschooling regulations. :-/<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-515462037">Will discussing footwear lead to a breakthrough discussion on how to<br/>
unschool or parent better? Maybe! Maybe not. But only after a high-volume<br/>
thread peters out can someone say that thread served the needs of too few at<br/>
the expense of too many.<br/>
<br/>
The average number of emails -- and members -- have been slowly rising over<br/>
the years. (I like statistics :-) 700, 800, 1300, 1700 (that last one is<br/>
discounting the anomalous &quot;Ned month&quot; ;-). But so far this year we&#39;re<br/>
averaging 3800! That&#39;s more than double the volume of last year.<br/>
<br/>
Is the list serving it&#39;s purpose at that volume? Can people get unschooling<br/>
information with 125 emails to read every day?<br/>
<br/>
For some people the answer is yes because they&#39;re connecting with other<br/>
unschoolers. By peeking into people&#39;s lives, they&#39;re gaining an<br/>
understanding of what natural learning is. For some people the answer is no.<br/>
The list isn&#39;t working for them if they pick up one piece of information<br/>
after an hour&#39;s worth of reading.<br/>
<br/>
There are things we as posters and readers can each do to help the list be<br/>
useful. (These are suggestions to judge our own behavior by, not the<br/>
behavior of others.)<br/>
<br/>
As a poster, <br/>
<br/>
1) keep in mind the purpose of the list is unschooling discussion. Ask<br/>
yourself if what you&#39;re about to send will help anyone unschool better.<br/>
<br/>
That would, of course, eliminate all the chit chat and that would be bad!<br/>
Chit chat makes the place friendly. But it would help the list be more<br/>
useful if the chit chat was a gentle friendly murmur rather than an<br/>
overwhelming roar.<br/>
<br/>
The list will appreciate it if you keep the one line posts to a minimum.<br/>
Posts with nothing more than &quot;Good idea!&quot; and &quot;Thanks!&quot; just increase the<br/>
volume without adding to anyone&#39;s understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to repeat yourself. If 3 people are making the same point, you don&#39;t<br/>
need to respond to all 3 with separate emails containing the same arguments.<br/>
Combine it into one post.<br/>
<br/>
2) It&#39;s lots easier and more fun to respond to breezy posts about life than<br/>
about unschooling. But the list isn&#39;t so useful if people spend their time<br/>
posting on the easy stuff and end up, because of lack of time, giving<br/>
cursory answers to the unschooling questions.<br/>
<br/>
As a reader, it&#39;s useful to learn how to cut down on what you pay attention<br/>
to. As in all aspects of life, we&#39;re suffering information overload. The<br/>
list is no different. Just as we can&#39;t* stop publishers from publishing too<br/>
many good books, or TV producers from making too many good TV shows, we<br/>
can&#39;t stop people from saying things on the list they feel are important.<br/>
Learning how to filter is a useful skill with the list and with life in<br/>
general.<br/>
<br/>
(*Well, actually, I can stop people. And the list can stop people but it<br/>
disrupts the usefulness of the list. When the list is useless, sometimes<br/>
further disruption to get it back on track is useful.)<br/>
<br/>
1) Learn how to filter your messages. Set up your email program to send all<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree. Admittedly, the Waltham school district and DSS has gotten <br/>
themselves into a ridiculous position. But these people lost legal custody of their <br/>
children because they refused to submit paperwork. They believe that the court <br/>
decisions regarding homeschooling are not law, and that the state Constitution <br/>
does not cover homeschooling. It didn&#39;t start out to be about testing; that&#39;s <br/>
just the latest issue.<br/>
<br/>
They can&#39;t move anymore, because they may no longer take their children out <br/>
of state until their 16th birthdays.   To me, it doesn&#39;t seem worth it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878450399">To my understanding, &#39;going underground&#39; means doing homeschooling in a <br/>
manner that one never &#39;complies&#39; with any gov&#39;t education regulations which <br/>
would identify oneself as a homeschooler AND to not draw attention to ones <br/>
(now-gov&#39;t-illicit) homeschooling activities.  In California, if we were to <br/>
homeschool underground, we would do what we always do, but not send in the <br/>
R-4 (which tells the state you own a private school.) ...and I might use a <br/>
pseudonym for my homeschooling lists if I was really wanting to stay below <br/>
radar.<br/>
<br/>
Think of it maybe like the Underground Railroad for slaves way back <br/>
when...  only now, the people tend to stay in one spot and educate their <br/>
kids instead of pursue freedom, which, in many ways, is the same thing, eh?<br/>
<br/>
Usually folks do it when they live in a state that &#39;requires&#39; they do <br/>
something against the family&#39;s philosophical understandings - like <br/>
administer standardized tests or validating the &#39;need&#39; for a <br/>
curriculum.  What are the ed-yourself rules in NH?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my understanding anyway.  Maybe someone else can expand on it?<br/>

would have seen the state homeschooling list split into 2 because the list<br/>
was overwhelmed by the court case. And had you read the legal issues list<br/>
you would *not* have read about how oppressive the laws in MA are towards<br/>
homeschooling. You would have read how the state has no right to make laws<br/>
beyond the state constitution. It wasn&#39;t about homeschooling. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
about her kids. It wasn&#39;t about her battle to do what was right for her<br/>
kids. It was all about the constitution.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to bad mouth the Bryants. They&#39;ve stuck by what they believe in<br/>
and fought a hard battle. Their kids seem to be doing well with the life<br/>
their parents have chosen for the family. But I do want to make it clear<br/>
that they weren&#39;t battling to make homeschooling easier in MA.<br/>

If you want a hero and want to raise them on a pedastal, don&#39;t erect it in<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and now that that&#39;s happened, they&#39;re continuing to safeguard<br/>
&gt; their children&#39;s right to a child-focused education.  They&#39;re making the<br/>
&gt; best they can of a seriously fubar&#39;d legal situation.  (and, the kids don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; seem to be adversely affected by what&#39;s gone on.  The quotes in the article<br/>
&gt; were from the kids, weren&#39;t they?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I admire them for having been able to balance a very time consuming project<br/>
while giving their children the attention they needed. (Or so it appears. We<br/>
can&#39;t really know.)<br/>
<br/>
But they chose the battle. They chose to take a stand on the constitution<br/>
while raising a family.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If the family does as the state wants, then they lend authenticity to the<br/>
&gt; state&#39;s current belief that the state, not the parents, have charge of each<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s education.  This can harm independent homeschoolers in the years to<br/>
&gt; follow.  (and yes, there is also the difficulty that the state may get<br/>
&gt; punative because of this dedication and demand for legal rights.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These are wonderfully rousing words.<br/>
<br/>
But how would it feel if I, as a resident of MA, using misinformation and<br/>
guesswork and wishful thinking, told you what the atmosphere was like and<br/>
what the future held for homeschoolers in California?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If I were them, I&#39;d probably have gone underground or found an out-of-state<br/>
&gt; unschooler to umbrella me instead of submitting even a few sentences of<br/>
&gt; &#39;curriculum&#39; or whatever they want to &#39;overview&#39; of my kids<br/>
&gt; education.  Thankfully, I live in California where I can do away with<br/>
&gt; intervention by declaring myself a private school.<br/>
&gt; Thank goodness for that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So you need to ask yourself why they didn&#39;t do that. They aren&#39;t stupid.<br/>
They aren&#39;t naive. They went into this with open eyes. They could have moved<br/>
to another town when they started having difficulties with Waltham. (Waltham<br/>
didn&#39;t start it. The town asked for what they believe the state says they<br/>
can ask for. (And if they were wrong, it&#39;s easy enough to point out the<br/>
relevant parts of the case law to them.) The Bryants *chose* not to submit<br/>
an education plan because they believed the state didn&#39;t have the right to<br/>
make any laws beyond the constitutuion. *Not* because the request is<br/>
burdensome. It&#39;s very easy to comply. So, again, the Bryants weren&#39;t caught<br/>
unaware.)<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants could have bailed at many points during the 4 years. The first<br/>
court case ended with them being ordered to submit an education plan. (Right<br/>
back where they started, except they had to submit retroactive education<br/>
plans. Stupid, yes, but their initial stance about the ed plans didn&#39;t have<br/>
a basis in reality either.) They chose to keep battling. Unlike the western<br/>
states which are so large, it&#39;s easy to work in MA and live in another<br/>
state. They could have done that. Why didn&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
I seem to have met a good many unschoolers in MA. Or at least relaxed<br/>
homeschoolers who claim to be unschoolers ;-) Anyway there are quite a few<br/>
of us. We&#39;re the home of John Holt and Growing Without Unschooling after<br/>
all. If it was difficult to unschool in MA and the Bryants were fighting to<br/>
make it possible, they would have had a lot of support. But they weren&#39;t<br/>
fighting for that. So they didn&#39;t get a lot of support.<br/>
<br/>
We too are not stupid. We don&#39;t need outsiders to tell us after the fact how<br/>
to interpret what was happening right in front of us. We *lived* it. We<br/>
didn&#39;t read about it in some biased alert.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239696937"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I didn&#39;t say they were wrong. I said they weren&#39;t fighting for<br/>
 &gt;homeschooling.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>(smiling gently)<br/>
Joyce, I didn&#39;t meant to imply that *you* said they were *wrong* for doing <br/>
what they are doing.  I was replying more to the general sentiment of &#39;but <br/>
at what cost&#39;.  I read very clearly that you feel that what they are doing <br/>
isn&#39;t about homeschooling so much, but is against possibly-false, <br/>
possibly-valid legal restrictions (that in this case, happen to impact <br/>
their homeschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; They&#39;re standing up for what they believe are their legal rights.  They<br/>
&gt; &gt; trusted the courts to maintain those rights<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Uh, no. They believe the constitution doesn&#39;t allow the state to create laws<br/>
&gt;beyond the constitution. The courts are there to uphold the laws the Bryants<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t believe should exist.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, so they&#39;re standing up for what they believe are their <br/>
*constitutionally* legal rights?  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They aren&#39;t wrong for holding strong beliefs. But it is wrong to<br/>
&gt;characterize them as poor naive homeschoolers being beaten up by the big bad<br/>
&gt;bureaucracy. Anyone who believes the constitution doesn&#39;t give the state the<br/>
&gt;right to create laws beyond the constitution and then chooses to take a<br/>
&gt;legal stand about it is savvy about legal matters!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe, but I (and others?) don&#39;t necessarily think they&#39;re &#39;poor naive&#39; <br/>
homeschoolers.  I happen to think they&#39;re pretty gutsy.  I also happen to <br/>
think that the situation might have gotten worse than they initially <br/>
expected it would.  Tim already spoke to the constitutional question with <br/>
one of his &#39;thots&#39;, which I thought was pretty interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; - only to find that the court<br/>
&gt; &gt; took away legal guardianship of their children (THAT must&#39;ve been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; shocker!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Not possible. The case was in and out of court for over 4 years.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, I&#39;d have been pretty shocked that they&#39;d choose to take away <br/>
guardianship of my kids because I held the belief they did not have the <br/>
legal authority to require me to send in a curriculum review of my kids <br/>
each year.  Even if it took four years.  I&#39;d have figured that eventually, <br/>
they&#39;d need to get a clue and realize that *I* am the parent.  The state is <br/>
not the parent.  (goodness, am I sounding like a libertarian?  What is the <br/>
world coming to?!!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; If the family does as the state wants, then they lend authenticity to the<br/>

&gt;But how would it feel if I, as a resident of MA, using misinformation and<br/>
&gt;guesswork and wishful thinking, told you what the atmosphere was like and<br/>
&gt;what the future held for homeschoolers in California?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does this issue have some background stuff going on for you?<br/>
I&#39;m from Cali, sure.  We basically have no homeschooling rules here (so <br/>
far) and that&#39;s the way we like it.  I find it distasteful when other <br/>
states have any sort of homeschooling-restrictive laws (like Washingtons&#39; <br/>
(or is it Oregon) where a homeschooling kid has to take a standardized test <br/>
three or four times before graduation.  Ick.)  Other states could take a <br/>
look at what&#39;s going on there and say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s do that too!  That&#39;s a <br/>
great idea!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I (or others) made any statement or implication about how <br/>
things are in MA (or any other state) for homeschoolers, nor what the <br/>
future holds for them in particular.  It is my belief that if the state <br/>
(meaning not-the-federal-gov&#39;t, and not any one state in particular) is not <br/>
in charge of ANYBODY&#39;s education, but having such a fairly-high-profile <br/>
family complying with a state request to oversee a child&#39;s education lends <br/>
legal authenticity to a states belief that they can control private/home <br/>
education.  (and yes, I do realize that at the moment the kids are &#39;wards <br/>
of the state&#39;, but refusing to comply as a family also sends a message <br/>
about that particular court decision as well!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; If I were them, I&#39;d probably have gone underground or found an out-of-state<br/>

<br/>
&gt;So you need to ask yourself why they didn&#39;t do that. They aren&#39;t stupid.<br/>
&gt;They aren&#39;t naive. They went into this with open eyes. They could have moved<br/>
&gt;to another town when they started having difficulties with Waltham. (Waltham<br/>

&gt;an education plan because they believed the state didn&#39;t have the right to<br/>
&gt;make any laws beyond the constitutuion. *Not* because the request is<br/>
&gt;burdensome. It&#39;s very easy to comply. So, again, the Bryants weren&#39;t caught<br/>
&gt;unaware.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think I implied that they were caught unaware, did I?  I was pretty <br/>
clear that they made a decision and that I respected their decision.  I <br/>
think maybe this case is bringing some stuff from other <br/>
areas/lists/previous conversations with other people, over to here and <br/>
affecting how you perceive what I wrote?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We too are not stupid. We don&#39;t need outsiders to tell us after the fact how<br/>
&gt;to interpret what was happening right in front of us. We *lived* it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anybody here is a homeschooling outsider, and I also don&#39;t <br/>
think anybody here is writing with the intention of telling someone in MA <br/>
how to homeschool or if it&#39;s a good/bad place to homeschool.  (Except for <br/>
that ANYPLACE that has ANY restrictions on homeschooling is not as nice as <br/>
a state with NO restrictions!  I think we happen to be sharing our own <br/>
impressions and thoughts on what we have read and heard here about the <br/>
situation, and even then, it&#39;s been in pretty general terms.<br/>
<br/>
In any event, I&#39;m feeling that maybe you&#39;re not much concerned by what I&#39;m <br/>
thinking, but that the whole Waltham issue brings up *bad history* for you?<br/>
I could be wrong.  It&#39;s happened before! (grin)<br/>

<br/>
Do you remember the young girl pilot who crashed and died a few years abo?<br/>
She was a homeschooler. Lots of the press wanted to make it about<br/>
homeschooling. But it wasn&#39;t. Homeschooling probably allowed her more time<br/>
to fly so she was trusted earlier. Her parents probably trusted her so<br/>
*therefore* they homeschooled. But as far as the outcome, her homeschooling<br/>
was as irrelevant to what happened as her religion.<br/>
<br/>
The Bryants used their homeschooling to make a point about the state<br/>
constitution. But, like the girl, it wasn&#39;t about homeschooling.<br/>

but that doesn&#39;t mean it needs to be on an unschooling list. Usefulness or<br/>

Usefulness in helping people unschool is the criteria. Most people aren&#39;t<br/>
using that to judge what they send, but as long as a topic isn&#39;t disrupting<br/>
the list, that&#39;s okay. But when a topic does disrupt the list, then that&#39;s<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So, I&#39;ve been reading, and reading some more about this, even on other <br/>
homeschooling/unschooling lists.<br/>
<br/>
Every list but this one finds it relevant to homeschooing/unschooling.  I&#39;m <br/>
not saying they are right.  I&#39;m still reading.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think that they would not be homeschoolers IF they were not trying to <br/>
change laws?<br/>
<br/>
So far with my reading it seems to ME anyway, that they are homeschoolers and <br/>
don&#39;t like having to have their children tested according to the law so they <br/>
want to do whatever it takes to change that law. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s gotten ugly for sure, that much isn&#39;t in dispute.  Is it sorta like <br/>
which came first, the chicken or the egg?  Did they want to challenge the <br/>
Constitution so they choose to do it by unschooling/homeschooling their children by <br/>
not meeting the laws but defying them?<br/>
<br/>
Did they unschool/homeschool and find the laws/Constitution unfair to them as <br/>
parents and to their children so they decided to challenge them?<br/>
<br/>
If they are acting on this as homeschoolers/unschoolers who want their <br/>
children not to be in the control of the State, it seems to me it has everything to <br/>
do with unschooling/homeschooling.  But then I&#39;ve been wrong before.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, on the simplest of levels it doesn&#39;t affect me personally but I <br/>
do find it interesting to hear what others think/feel about such an emotionally <br/>
charged issue, particularly since their hope in all of this is to change laws <br/>
regarding homeschool/unschool issues.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, it&#39;s all about challenging the Constitution but WHY?  Because they don&#39;t <br/>
like being told their children HAVE to be tested because they are <br/>
homeschooled.  If it were about not wanting to license their dogs or get the rabies <br/>
vaccinations and they were ALSO homeschoolers then I could understand how it is NOT <br/>
about homeschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
I also want to add that while I used homeschool/unschool in the above post I <br/>
recognize that they are very different but are sometimes used interchangeably <br/>
by someone who does not send their children to a private or public school.<br/>

to explain how much this case is not about homeschooling when, from the<br/>
outside, it seems so obviously to be about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
People expressed their opinions based on what they&#39;d been told and treated<br/>
that knowledge as though it were equal to my local knowledge. And you&#39;re<br/>
doing the same.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I find it distasteful when other<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why should what other adults choose to put up with bother you? It seems like<br/>
an issue of wanting to control something that isn&#39;t yours to control. By<br/>
being angry you imply you want to go in and help them because they obviously<br/>
can&#39;t -- or they wouldn&#39;t have the laws they do -- help themselves. I think<br/>
they&#39;d resent the implication that they are incapable of helping themselves<br/>

<br/>
What cave do you think people are living in that they wouldn&#39;t realize they<br/>
could take action and change things if they wanted to?<br/>
<br/>
When people feel the regulations are getting in their way, they will. They<br/>
don&#39;t need you to determine for them that they&#39;re suffering and should have<br/>
something better.<br/>

MA are Kathryn and me. No one else can know enough to make their opinions on<br/>
the rightness or wrongness of what happened mean anything.<br/>
<br/>
The worthwhile comments from others seemed to be respectful of the extent of<br/>
what they could and couldn&#39;t know about the case.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;re addressing the subject as though there were some universal<br/>
principles about homeschooling involved. The case is about the wording in<br/>
the state constitution of Massachusetts. The motivations of all parties<br/>
involved are based on that.<br/>
<br/>
We could discuss the principle of how far we would stand up for what we<br/>
believe in but you can&#39;t draw on what the Bryants did or didn&#39;t do or why<br/>
the did what they did because it&#39;s unknowable outside the state and only<br/>
vaguely guessable by people inside the state. And guesswork based on<br/>
woefully limited knowledge is as meaningful as gibberish.<br/>

try to get their point across.<br/>

innocent and naive means unaware, ignorant in response to your &quot;shocker&quot;<br/>
statements. Neither excludes being gutsy.<br/>
<br/>
And since the case isn&#39;t about homeschooling, the fact that they&#39;re<br/>
homeschoolers, whether gutsy or not, is irrelevant.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which implies the Bryants were naive.<br/>
<br/>
What are you basing that opinion on? On the emails flying around? On the<br/>
news reports?<br/>
<br/>
See, this is what&#39;s bothering me. You can&#39;t form valid opinions based on the<br/>
little information available to you. If you&#39;d read the state list during the<br/>
4 years the Bryants were battling this, there&#39;s no way you would conclude<br/>
that Kim Bryant was caught unaware. And you can adamantly believe she was<br/>
caught unaware all you want but it doesn&#39;t make it valid.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t recreate 4 years of 1000&#39;s of emails of heavy duty legal discussion.<br/>
And unfortunately it&#39;s all gone from the archives on the state list so no<br/>
one has access to it :-/<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oh, I&#39;d have been pretty shocked that they&#39;d choose to take away<br/>
&gt; guardianship of my kids because I held the belief they did not have the<br/>
&gt; legal authority to require me to send in a curriculum review of my kids<br/>
&gt; each year.  Even if it took four years.  I&#39;d have figured that eventually,<br/>
&gt; they&#39;d need to get a clue and realize that *I* am the parent.  The state is<br/>
&gt; not the parent.  (goodness, am I sounding like a libertarian?  What is the<br/>
&gt; world coming to?!!)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again, you&#39;re arguing from a point of ignorance. You&#39;re creating a situation<br/>
as you imagine it could be and projecting how you imagine you&#39;d behave in it<br/>
and what you imagine your motivations would be if you were in that imaginary<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
The situation you&#39;re imagining isn&#39;t what happened. You don&#39;t know MA laws<br/>
and don&#39;t know what the Bryants knew or didn&#39;t know about what would happen.<br/>
You don&#39;t have the same motivations as Kim Bryant. The scenario you&#39;re<br/>
creating is meaningless. Therefore the conclusions you&#39;re drawing from it<br/>
are even more meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m from Cali, sure.  We basically have no homeschooling rules here (so<br/>
&gt; far) and that&#39;s the way we like it. I find it distasteful when other<br/>
&gt; states have any sort of homeschooling-restrictive laws (like Washingtons&#39;<br/>
&gt; (or is it Oregon) where a homeschooling kid has to take a standardized test<br/>
&gt; three or four times before graduation.  Ick.)  Other states could take a<br/>
&gt; look at what&#39;s going on there and say, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s do that too!  That&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; great idea!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And since the case isn&#39;t about homeschooling, what does your feelings on<br/>
restrictive homeschooling laws have to do with Waltham?<br/>
<br/>
You used the word homeschool 11 times in your post. And yet the case isn&#39;t<br/>
about homeschooling. But your post is saying loudly that it is about<br/>
homeschooling and that&#39;s what&#39;s irritating my sense of logic.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think I (or others) made any statement or implication about how<br/>
&gt; things are in MA (or any other state) for homeschoolers, nor what the<br/>
&gt; future holds for them in particular.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was in your quote above what you quoted from me:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; If the family does as the state wants, then they lend authenticity to the<br/>
&gt;&gt; state&#39;s current belief that the state, not the parents, have charge of each<br/>
&gt;&gt; child&#39;s education.  This can harm independent homeschoolers in the years to<br/>
&gt;&gt; follow.  (and yes, there is also the difficulty that the state may get<br/>
&gt;&gt; punative because of this dedication and demand for legal rights.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How do you know what the state believes? How can you speculate that they&#39;d<br/>
lend authenticity to something you can&#39;t know? How can you know a case that<br/>
isn&#39;t about homeschooling will have any impact on homeschoolers in years to<br/>
come when you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to homeschool in MA right now?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think I implied that they were caught unaware, did I?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; They <br/>
&gt;&gt; trusted the courts to maintain those rights - only to find that the court<br/>
&gt;&gt; took away legal guardianship of their children (THAT must&#39;ve been a<br/>
&gt;&gt; shocker!)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think anybody here is a homeschooling outsider<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But most everyone on the list is a Massachusetts outsider. And the case is<br/>
about the MA constitution, not homeschooling. Most everyone is under<br/>
informed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In any event, I&#39;m feeling that maybe you&#39;re not much concerned by what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; thinking, but that the whole Waltham issue brings up *bad history* for you?<br/>
&gt; I could be wrong.  It&#39;s happened before! (grin)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nothing to do with Waltham and everything to do with a history of people<br/>
trying to argue points they don&#39;t realize they don&#39;t have enough knowledge<br/>
about to have informed opinions on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about logic and sound arguments and awareness and validity.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;Had you been in MA during the time they were battling this in court, you<br/>
&gt; would have seen the state homeschooling list split into 2 because the list<br/>
&gt; was overwhelmed by the court case. And had you read the legal issues list<br/>
&gt; you would *not* have read about how oppressive the laws in MA are towards<br/>
&gt; homeschooling. You would have read how the state has no right to make laws<br/>
&gt; beyond the state constitution. It wasn&#39;t about homeschooling. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; about her kids. It wasn&#39;t about her battle to do what was right for her<br/>
&gt; kids. It was all about the constitution.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am actually formerly from MA.<br/>
 A list splint in two sounds like more than a few feel differently. <br/>
Im not going to sit here an Unschool then stick a test in my kids face that <br/>
doesn&#39;t sound too Unschooly.<br/>
 Their choice to HS/Unsc and the constitution is directly related. <br/>
If they where fighting a battle over taxes then no it would not be. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to bad mouth the Bryants. They&#39;ve stuck by what they believe in<br/>
&gt; and fought a hard battle. Their kids seem to be doing well with the life<br/>
&gt; their parents have chosen for the family. But I do want to make it clear<br/>
&gt; that they weren&#39;t battling to make Homeschooling easier in MA.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you want a hero and want to raise them on a pedestal, don&#39;t erect it in<br/>
&gt; the homeschoolers hall of fame. Do it in the constitutionalists hall of<br/>
&gt; fame.Joyce<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They took a stand they stuck to it. They didn&#39;t back down because some law <br/>
says they should test because the schools test and their kids are not learning.<br/>
When laws are bad they get changed, they do not get changed unless they are <br/>
challenged.<br/>
I dont think they moved to Massachusetts with the intention of changing the <br/>
constitution.  <br/>
I do not have them on a pedestal I respect their will power. <br/>
<br/>
For those interested......  The Bryants will be on the O&#39;Reilly Factor <br/>
tonight.  <br/>
<br/>
 I dont think this is a one state issue. I for one would *not* force my child <br/>
to take a test. It&#39;s all or nothing isn&#39;t that what has been said? Not choose <br/>
which ones apply from the basket of stuff. This is where to me it looks like <br/>
ones convictions may be just as valid as another as they should be. <br/>
They are the Bryants from the US that&#39;s all that matters to me. Many states <br/>
look at other states as a model. If testing was required here I would not move <br/>
and I would not force my children to test. Certain grades test here but not <br/>
HS/UN or private schools.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And it&#39;s opinions like this that make me beat my head against my screen in<br/>
frustration.<br/>
<br/>
That sounds sensible so people will keep offering that type of opinion. But<br/>
it has no basis in MA reality. WE ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TEST. We have an end<br/>
of year assessment and parents must approve the form. If testing isn&#39;t<br/>
appropriate to the style of homeschooling, then parents would reject that<br/>
form of assessment and choose another one.<br/>
<br/>
Seems to me I&#39;ve explained the MA process about 5 times. And for some reason<br/>
people are giving more weight to opinions offered by people outside the<br/>
state and nonhomeschoolers inside the state than they are to an unschooler<br/>
in the state.<br/>
<br/>
I think people are listening to these opinions of outsiders because the made<br/>
up scenarios make more sense to people. The scenarios match what they<br/>
imagine must be true for this case to have happened and for it to be about<br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But it isn&#39;t true. The scenarios are made up. They&#39;re fiction.<br/>
<br/>
The state is choosing testing for the Bryant kids because the Bryant kids<br/>
are now in the state&#39;s legal custody. The state is serving as parents so the<br/>
state gets to choose the form of assessment.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it sorta like <br/>
&gt; which came first, the chicken or the egg?  Did they want to challenge the<br/>
&gt; Constitution so they choose to do it by unschooling/homeschooling their<br/>
&gt; children by not meeting the laws but defying them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I hope not!<br/>
<br/>
Their kids seem okay so I suspect they saw an opportunity that already<br/>
existed in their life that they could use to make a legal point.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a guess based on more knowledge, but I dont know how much it&#39;s really<br/>
worth.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Did they unschool/homeschool and find the laws/Constitution unfair to them as<br/>
&gt; parents and to their children so they decided to challenge them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would only make sense if there were no other homeschoolers in MA. Are<br/>
the laws only unfair to the Bryants? Why? And if the laws are unfair to all<br/>
homeschoolers, then why are the Bryants the only ones who care?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If they are acting on this as homeschoolers/unschoolers who want their<br/>
&gt; children not to be in the control of the State, it seems to me it has<br/>
&gt; everything to <br/>
&gt; do with unschooling/homeschooling.  But then I&#39;ve been wrong before.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>IF. HUGE &quot;IF&quot; that you&#39;re basing on what knowledge of MA homeschooling?<br/>
You&#39;re presuming there must be control in order for this case to be about<br/>
homeschooling. That&#39;s what everyone is doing. They&#39;ve concluded the case<br/>
must be about homeschooling and then they&#39;re making up what must be true in<br/>
order for it to be about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The control in MA is minimal. The case isn&#39;t about homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I <br/>
&gt; do find it interesting to hear what others think/feel about such an<br/>
&gt; emotionally <br/>

&gt; regarding homeschool/unschool issues<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>::: beating head on screen again :::<br/>
<br/>
Peaple outside of MA can only offer opinions on the scenario they&#39;ve made up<br/>
to fit the facts. Their scenario is wrong and their opinions are<br/>
meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t about homeschooling. It doesn&#39;t affect the laws in MA. And it has<br/>
even less impact on homeschooling laws outside of MA.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Yes, it&#39;s all about challenging the Constitution but WHY?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because they&#39;re constitutionalists and they&#39;re fighting for what they<br/>
believe.<br/>
<br/>
If their homeschooling has given them a different perspective on the<br/>
constitution, does it have any more meaning for homeschooling than if<br/>
someone&#39;s homeschooling gave them a different perspective on Libertarianism<br/>
and they began fighting for Libertarianism? It would be about<br/>
Libertarianism, not about homeschooling. If the results of their battle for<br/>
Libertarianism had a positive side effect on homeschooling, it&#39;s a pretty<br/>
round about chancy route if their intent was to effect homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If the Bryants wanted to fight to change homeschooling laws they would have<br/>
chosen a route that would have rallied the support of homeschoolers in MA.<br/>
The route they chose irritated more homeschoolers than it inspired.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Because they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like being told their children HAVE to be tested because they are<br/>
&gt; homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HOMESCHOOLING PARENTS DON&#39;T HAVE TO TEST.<br/>
<br/>
But the Bryants don&#39;t get to choose now because they lost the right.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If it were about not wanting to license their dogs or get the<br/>
&gt; rabies <br/>
&gt; vaccinations and they were ALSO homeschoolers then I could understand how it<br/>
&gt; is NOT <br/>
&gt; about homeschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is not about homeschooling. And you don&#39;t understand because you don&#39;t<br/>
live in MA. And you don&#39;t understand because you&#39;re giving more weight to<br/>
the undoubtedly greater number of seemingly sensible sounding opinions of<br/>
others who also don&#39;t live in MA.<br/>
