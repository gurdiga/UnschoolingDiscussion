<div id="ygrps-yiv-851341732">Just thought I&#39;d let you know that after all my complaining our baby was born <br/>
last Thursday.  Elliott William was 9 pounds, 6 ounces and the perfect <br/>
unmedicated birth!<br/>
<br/>
I was in and out of labor for DAYS.  Really.  A couple of days of <br/>
inconsistent contractions followed by days of constant but irregular contractions.  Even <br/>
in the womb, this one refused to follow a textbook pattern.  We spent a day or <br/>
so at 15 to 20 minutes apart and then he organized pretty consistently at 10 <br/>
minutes apart for a couple of hours.  Once he decided to drop from 10 minutes, <br/>
we were at 2 minutes apart in about an hour.  I hadn&#39;t intended to stay home <br/>
quite so long, but we made it to the hospital with 45 minutes to spare.<br/>
<br/>
(A funny side note - I arrived at the hospital about 9 p.m. and had to go <br/>
through the emergency room.  We scared the emergency staff with the frequency of <br/>
the contractions - and probably my screaming - so they wheeled us up really <br/>
fast to labor and delivery.  In the waiting room of the ER were a bunch of <br/>
people there for a sleep study!  I wondering later how any of them got to sleep <br/>
after witnessing my &quot;I am woman, hear me roar&quot; act.)<br/>
<br/>
My midwife was fabulous at guiding me through labor.  My first son was born <br/>
with an epidural after 10 hours of back labor, my daughter came a year later <br/>
with a c-section due to placenta preevia.  This birth was so perfect that soon <br/>
after he was born I turned to my husband and said &quot;Oh, we have to do that <br/>
again!&quot;  I didn&#39;t tear, so recovery has been fairly easy.  Elliott had the cord <br/>
wrapped around his head so his upper half of his head was badly bruised and he <br/>
had burst blood vessels in both his eyes.  His back was also bruised because he <br/>
came out so quickly, but he is recovering very nicely.  <br/>
<br/>
The hospital staff was great, for the most part.  They put the baby right in <br/>
bed with me, put a big sign on his plastic bassinet that said &quot;No formula, no <br/>
pacifier&quot; and basically left me alone.  It was below zero here and they were <br/>
very busy with new babies.  The nurses have a theory about bad weather and <br/>
birthing.  The OB who delivered my daughter stopped by and congratulated me on <br/>
vbac-ing such a large baby.  She said that staying home as long as I did <br/>
facilitated the natural birth perfectly, she enjoyed watching him on the monitor but <br/>
not coming into the room.  I guess she had to be there just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for all your advice about inducing labor.  Elliott just had to <br/>
arrive on his own schedule and I needed to respect that.  I did spend a lot <br/>
of time watching movies while contracting away - Bowling for Columbine, Freda, <br/>
the whole first season of the West Wing, lot of American Experiences.  Now <br/>
that the baby is here, I can barely remember how frustrated I was waiting for <br/>
him!<br/>
