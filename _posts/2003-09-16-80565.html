<div id="ygrps-yiv-1675157294">Hi, All!<br/>
<br/>
Good friends of mine that live far, far away are having their first baby at the end of this year.  There is a baby shower in October that I will be sending a present or two to.  They are really good people, yet are uneducated on our way of &quot;raising&quot; children.  I want to get them something that will make them think, yet be a nice gift, know what I mean?  The only thing that I can think of is maybe something like &quot;The Baby Book&quot; by William and Martha Sears.  <br/>
<br/>
Any and all ideas will be appreciated!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-542422667">One thing I have done recently is buy a new gift for the baby, from the<br/>
registry or my old stand by the Mattel Factory store, and then I have<br/>
put a couple of my beloved books in a little basket with a separate note<br/>
about how much they helped me when Jayn was a baby. Another suggestion<br/>
might be a subscription to Mothering Magazine - a monthly dose of<br/>
attachment parenting encouragement!<br/>

How about a month or a few months of a good cloth diaper service?  If <br/>
it is available, of course.  It is a real luxury, especially for a <br/>
new mother.  And then a subscription to Mothering Magazine to open <br/>
some windows and let in the fresh air of new ideas.  Both save money <br/>
on postage costs, too, and can&#39;t get lost or broken in the mail.<br/>
<br/>
Or one that I loved was to have dinner delivered every evening for <br/>
the first week after the baby was born.  What a treat!  One friend <br/>
had a catering service bring one casserole-type dish every evening.  <br/>
Talk about feeling pampered!  If you know anyone where she lives you <br/>
could probably arrange this through a catering service, or you could <br/>
ask other friends who live near her to do this for you, to bake a <br/>
casserole and deliver it, and pay them. Even if it&#39;s only pizza for a <br/>
week, or a book of pizza coupons they can use as needed, it is such a <br/>
special gift. <br/>
<br/>
This would also be a great time to send a copy of something by John <br/>
Holt, perhaps, or any other interesting book or magazine that <br/>
presents unschooling philosophy in a way you think she might accept <br/>
it, or at least read it.  What unschooling book has been most <br/>
influential for you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1560695240">The Baby Book is a good idea.  Lately I&#39;ve been weaving baby blankets and <br/>
presenting them with Under The Chinaberry Tree, An Reuthling and Patti Pitcher.  <br/>
It&#39;s about the best book about kids books and gentle child &quot;rearing&quot; advice.  <br/>
It was written by the people at the Chinaberry catalogue and I just love it.<br/>

A book that helped me see children in a good way when I had babies was Whole <br/>
Child, Whole Parent.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.health-books-web.com/Whole_Child_Whole_Parent_4e_0060928182.html">http://www.health-books-web.com/Whole_Child_Whole_Parent_4e_0060928182.html</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a newer (1997) edition, too, which is cool.   Here&#39;s the review from <br/>
that page, but if you put in <br/>

Whole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e   <br/>
by Authors:  Polly B. Berends <br/>
Released: July, 1997 <br/>
ISBN: 0060928182 <br/>
Paperback <br/>
<br/>
Whole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e &gt; Customer Review #1:   <br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
 Beautiful <br/>
<br/>
I discovered this at the discount table of a bookstore in Lexington, <br/>
Kentucky. It does not get old or outdated.<br/>
How easily this book could have drifted off into self-indulgent Freudian <br/>
psychobabble, Fundamentalist moralism or New Age narcissism--all of which Alice <br/>
Miller has warned us against--in the hands of a less gifted writer. The fact <br/>
that it doesnt at any time in 340-plus pages is nothing short of miraculous. <br/>
Polly Berends not only challenges ones view of parenting and loving, but also of <br/>
Christianity and culture and the universe itself, by bringing mysticism back to <br/>
the modern Christian mind while not alienating those of other (or no <br/>
particular) faiths. Filled with transcendent prose, quotes of everything from Buddhist <br/>
sacred text to the New Testament to e.e. cumming poetry, and the writers own <br/>
heart (the heart of a proud mother and wife who walks with God), this is a <br/>
truly beautiful work that made my mind scream what was important about my <br/>
personal relationship with my son to me, above the distractions of my ego, with <br/>
virtually every page. <br/>
Consider yourself the child, and this book will help you raise yourself. And <br/>
then imagine what kind of real parent you can be while following its lessons. <br/>
This is the ultimate holiday, Mother/Fathers Day or birthday gift for anyone <br/>
with children, bar none.<br/>
Beautiful.  <br/>
<br/>

Whole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e &gt; Customer Review #2:   <br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
 One of the Spiritual Classics of This Century <br/>
<br/>
I had the fortune to begin to read this book 10 years before our twins were <br/>
born. Whether you are a parent or not Berends statement of the perennial <br/>
spiritual wisdom is to be savored and dipped into over and over again. The book is <br/>
so rich, so moving, so poetic that frequently you will find that you need to <br/>
stop and reflect on her words after a page or two.<br/>
This book, along with Berends unfortunately out-of-print &quot;Coming To Life&quot;, is <br/>
a true spiritual classic.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Whole Child, Whole Parent, 4/e &gt; Customer Review #3:   <br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
 Spiritual Guidebook to New Parenthood <br/>
<br/>
Every now and then a rare book appears which can change your life. This is <br/>
one. <br/>
Polly Berrien Berends is wise and gentle. She brings lofty or deep spiritual <br/>
insights to the rubber-meets-the-road issues of daily parenting: how is one to <br/>
approach fears of childbirth? How should one talk to a toddler? How does one <br/>
decide which toys to buy? <br/>
I had the good fortune to read this book just prior to becoming a parent, and <br/>
if possible, you should too. It is not a quick or easy read, rather a very <br/>
meaningful one. Sometimes I had to stop and think after only three or four <br/>
pages. But this was well worth it. <br/>
If you are already a parent, or if you may never become a parent, read this <br/>
book. Although it addresses parenting issues it is really a book about <br/>
human-being-hood.</div>

(Goes along with another current thread :-)  I made do most of the time with untucked shirts or a t-shirt with a vest front sewn over it to cover slits in the shirt, but it is nice to have a nice nursing top or dress for more formal occasions.  Maybe a gift certificate to a catalog that sells them, and she can pick her own?<br/>
