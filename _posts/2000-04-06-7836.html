I, too, am concerned about a man making this kind of seriously important<br/>
decision for a woman.  In part, it (breastfeeding) is what women were<br/>
designed to do.  Anyone witholding medication from a diabetic or heart<br/>
patient would be arrested.  How is it we don&#39;t recognize the right of<br/>
babies to be breastfed?  How can anyone withold what is the elixir for<br/>
infants?  It&#39;s really quite the same.  (I am very aware that there may<br/>
be circumstances - though extrememly rare - where a breastfeeding<br/>
relationship cannot be had.  How unfortunate that is.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, for letting me have another whack at this understandably HOT<br/>
topic.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I nursed 2 out of 3 of my children. I ended up with complications and had<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; stop both times. My ex would not allow me to nurse (even express) so my dd<br/>
&gt; &gt; did not receive the benefits.<br/>

&gt; Deep Breath---I have to ask this question.  How on earth does a man allow or<br/>
&gt; not allow a woman to nurse?   Beyond the threat of violence, how could a<br/>
&gt; husband make this choice for a woman?<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m just a tad baffled by the whole concept.  :(<br/>
