Some families don&#39;t allow you to show your pain. You know the <br/>
kind &quot;big boys don&#39;t cry&quot; and all that garbage.  I think this is the <br/>
kind of crying the singer was referring to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1887038944">Oh, good, I&#39;m glad you all aren&#39;t saying that kids shouldn&#39;t cry.  I<br/>
also believe that we need to be there for our children.  Laura, I&#39;m<br/>
sorry that it was that way for you.  I&#39;m trying to do better for my<br/>
kids.<br/>

I agree  with the below.  This song just kills me because we weren&#39;t allowed <br/>
to  cry as children.  My dad&#39;s favorite expression was, &#39;I&#39;ll give you  <br/>
something to cry about.&#39;  I still have trouble crying, even when I need  to.  If my <br/>
children need to cry -- like over a broken friendship or a  lost pet, I hold <br/>
them while they do.  Until they don&#39;t need to  anymore.  I wish someone had <br/>
done the same for  me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure that&#39;s true and right of the intent of the song too, but in the  <br/>
context of our own lives, it&#39;s not our ideal to &quot;let them cry&quot; as in (what it  <br/>
sounded to me like the first time) &quot;ignore him and let him cry&quot; or babies, left  <br/>
to cry themselves to sleep.<br/>
 <br/>
I was told &quot;Stop that crying or I&#39;ll give you something to cry about&quot; or  &quot;Do <br/>
you want something to cry about?&quot;  Those are the worst, when you&#39;re  made to <br/>
agree that no, you don&#39;t want a spanking and so yes, you will stop  crying.  <br/>
It&#39;s like being forced to beg.  (Or like when a  computer program asks some <br/>
form of  &quot;We&#39;re shutting down everything  now and you&#39;re losing all your work, <br/>
ok?&quot; and the only choice is &quot;ok.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 <br/>
So there&#39;s &quot;let them cry&quot; the compassionate &quot;It&#39;s okay, I won&#39;t spank you  <br/>
for crying&quot; and then there&#39;s the next level, &quot;I&#39;m sorry you&#39;re crying, and I&#39;ll  <br/>
try to make you more comfortable and safe.&quot;<br/>
