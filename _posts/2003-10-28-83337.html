<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; tragic murder-suicide in rural North Carolina was somehow evidence of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;dark side&quot; of homeschooling, which justified further government<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of home education. The tenuous connection between this two-year-old<br/>

&gt;<br/>

the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BULLSHIT.<br/>
<br/>
A bunch of republicans co-signing a letter is not &quot;the government.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about freedom of the press, people?  Are you insane?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really offended by this stuff, honestly, and I would personally prefer <br/>
not to have it on this list.<br/>
<br/>
Threatening sponsors is blackmail.  I thought the letter from  Kraft or <br/>
whichever company it was was Right On.  I don&#39;t think companies should bend to just <br/>
numbers pressure and threats.  There are laws against cheating people out of <br/>
their livlihood.   That&#39;s what Cheryl Seelhoff won a lawsuit about, when other <br/>
Christian publishers put her out of business with threats and lies because <br/>
they didn&#39;t like the fact that she left her abusive husband.  A minister TOLD <br/>
her (as if he were God) to return to her husband and she did NOT because he was <br/>
beating her up and she wanted her kids safe and free from that, and so she was <br/>
put out of business.<br/>
<br/>
If a person gives a reasoned, intelligent argument to an advertising <br/>
executive and the executive is moved by the argument and so changes company action, <br/>
that&#39;s great!  But to go in as a mob making demands (especially when the people <br/>
didn&#39;t watch the show and didn&#39;t patronize the company ANYway) is just being a <br/>
mob.  Joining a mob for the thrill of joining a mob is a very low form of <br/>
human thought, and not one to be proud of.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers joining Christian mobs make homeschooling look bad.<br/>
CBS did a thing for a political reason.<br/>
Christian homeschooling activists made a political response.<br/>
Some of the people hooting like monkeys over the joy of mob action are <br/>
NOTpeople understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone here IS really interested in all that, could those who think <br/>
it&#39;s peachy just list some other lists where they CAN go to feel mobbish?  <br/>

<br/>
That list is a very, very small list considering all of Congress.  <br/>
<br/>
One guy from New Mexico is on there, out of five (two senators and three <br/>
representatives).   Stevan Pearce is the one who signed it.  He&#39;s new.  He&#39;s from <br/>
Hobbs, in SE New Mexico (the corner surrounded by Texas.  It&#39;s a very Baptist <br/>
town.  Pearce is Baptist.  <br/>
<br/>
I *could* ask the others why they didn&#39;t sign it, but I already know.  It <br/>
wasn&#39;t something put before the house as a vote.  It&#39;s not a bill or a proposal <br/>
of the house of representatives.   It was a petition passed around among <br/>
Baptists and similar conservatives, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
SO... if any of you want to write to New Mexico&#39;s representative from the SE <br/>
oil fields and thank him for doing you a big favor, go ahead, but I can&#39;t see <br/>
how he&#39;d care if you can&#39;t vote for him.  Every letter that goes to them will <br/>
just be one more person they&#39;ll hit up hard for money next time they&#39;re <br/>
running for office.<br/>
<br/>
And I think it would be well worth those of you who care about this checking <br/>
to see who&#39;s behind the proposed homeschooling legislation.   Are some of the <br/>
same guys who are berating CBS some of those who will vote FOR the legislation <br/>
which CBS&#39;s story is going to help?<br/>
<br/>
It has already been pointed out that it&#39;s very likely CBS ran their story to <br/>
pump up support of a federal homeschooling law.  Double check your local guy <br/>
to see whether he&#39;s involved in that or will ultimately vote in a law (aft<br/>
Pete Dominici&#39;s from New Mexico.  He&#39;s been a senator for a long time.  He&#39;s <br/>

<br/>
Do you mean what kind of response to CBS?  From homeschoolers?<br/>
<br/>
Why respond to CBS at all?   CBS doesn&#39;t give a flying fig what<br/>
homeschoolers think of their report.  <br/>
Those kids *died.*  Those cases are real and some of them at least<br/>
involved people who said they were homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
CBS said homeschooling helped those families hide abuse.   That may have<br/>
been true in the Boss&#39;s case and the Edgar&#39;s case.  But abusers hide<br/>
abuse.  That&#39;s how it continues even in families being regularly visited<br/>
by social services, like the latest case in New Jersey, the Jacksons.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is why are homeschooler more outraged over the conclusion CBS<br/>
came to after real cases of abuse, than they are at the kind of<br/>
homeschoolers who beat and &quot;discipline&quot; and punish their kids?<br/>
On a lot of lists if you were to speak out against hitting kids you&#39;d get<br/>
that &quot;judgmental&quot; word thrown at you and the &quot;everyone knows what&#39;s best<br/>
for their own families&quot; bull pucky routine.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe everyone should get involved in making spanking and time out and<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818544369">I know that most of the folk on this list seem to be on other lists<br/>
also. However, I forwarded this letter so that those who are only here<br/>
would at least have the information that this letter has been sent.<br/>
There have been many interesting posts springing from the topic,<br/>
including about the role of media bias in our lives, and the efficacy of<br/>
different types of political action. Just as we should not attempt to<br/>
deny that fundamentalist Christian extremist parents exist, it seems<br/>
important to know what has developed. There is federal legislation<br/>
coming up that is directly aimed at homeschoolers. I suspect that this<br/>
letter is part of that debate (not the right word - scheme, discussion -<br/>
ack I seem to want to write &quot;conspiracy&quot;) I know that there are a number<br/>
of other lists that are devoted to political discussions about<br/>
homeschooling, and message boards that focus on political debate also.<br/>
Perhaps this letter and the issues that Sandra has pointed out will spur<br/>
those people who are interested to check those out. (Doesn&#39;t mean you<br/>
can&#39;t be here too!)<br/>
<br/>
I have to say that I agonized a little about forwarding it, because I<br/>
knew that Sandra would disapprove. However I also felt that putting<br/>
&quot;FYI&quot; in the subject line was a mitigating action, and that if it was<br/>
truly unwelcome it would be mediated away.<br/>
<br/>
My final thought on this is that once again the theme that comes up here<br/>
repeatedly is clarity of language/clarity of thought. I thought I was<br/>
getting good with this stuff, but until Sandra pointed out that the<br/>
original subject line said &quot;Government sends&quot; completely inaccurately, I<br/>
hadn&#39;t noticed that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125442417">&lt;&lt;Maybe everyone should get involved in making spanking and time out and<br/>
go-to-bed-without-your-dinner illegal.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you remember the movie &quot;The American President&quot; with Michael<br/>
Douglas? He portrays a President who is trying desperately to keep his<br/>
personal life private by not referring to his girlfriend (Annette<br/>
Benning) at all (to the press). His ratings slide into the toilet thanks<br/>
to the inflammatory tirades of his opponent. Finally his aide, portrayed<br/>
by Michael J. Fox, tells him words to the effect of (quoting from<br/>
memory):<br/>
<br/>
                        &quot;People want leadership. They are desperate for<br/>
it. In the absence of genuine leadership they will<br/>
<br/>
                        follow the loudest voice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Last week my dh showed me how to get Google news alerts - it is really<br/>
simple. I have three: &quot;home school&quot;, &quot;homeschool&quot;, and &quot;unschool&quot;. Since<br/>
then every day - every single day - there has been at least one new<br/>
essay or press release or &quot;weekly address&quot; from HSLDA (including news<br/>
about this letter). Additionally there have been other articles from<br/>
local papers all over the country and Canada, that usually deal with<br/>
praising conservative religious school-at-homers. This mode of<br/>
homeschooling is so very much the &quot;loudest voice&quot;. It is no wonder that<br/>
other voices (such as NHEN) are almost drowned out in the public<br/>
imagination. I rarely read the articles. When I see the HSLDA tag in the<br/>
web address, I know it won&#39;t help me in my journey towards being a<br/>
better parent.<br/>
