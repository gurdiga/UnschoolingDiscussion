Subject: playing guns<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; my husband was raised around guns and he and his father think they are<br/>
&gt; responsible<br/>
&gt; I brought my son and his friend over to the in-laws for dinner and had to<br/>
&gt; ask that the pistol at the front door be put in a gun safe away from the<br/>
&gt; bullets<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; this is not respect for safety in my opinion<br/>
&gt; I think my father in law is just another one of the people that the NRA<br/>
has<br/>
&gt; brain washed for their cause<br/>
&gt; not that every member is:<br/>
&gt; some actually do research on their own and not take the magazines and<br/>
&gt; letters as gospel<br/>
&gt; in our home we have the no gun rule<br/>
&gt; our eldest son has no interest in guns<br/>
&gt; my husband got a rifle for his 10th birthday, his father received that gun<br/>
&gt; on his 10th birthday<br/>
&gt; our son who could care less about guns and chooses not to hunt animals did<br/>
&gt; not receive the gun<br/>
&gt; our other son seems some what interested in playing guns<br/>
&gt; I think that comes from our recent move to the ranch/cowboy land where<br/>
&gt; everyone carries their rifle<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We will not have guns in our home!!<br/>
&gt; my FI-L likes to think it would be good protection<br/>
&gt; HA I&#39;m a small framed weak woman with MS if a person showed up here  to<br/>
hurt<br/>
&gt; us<br/>
&gt; he/she would have my own gun in moments and use it against me<br/>
&gt; Accidents  happen in the best of homes where guns are kept<br/>
&gt; my father had a gun and I never touched it.   he also hunted and since we<br/>
&gt; did not eat the meat,<br/>
&gt; donated it to a meet processor, or the people he went hunting with.<br/>
&gt; he never forced his opinions pro or con of his views on  war, hunting, or<br/>
&gt; farm life<br/>
&gt; and respects others feelings.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; my husband and his friend once told me hunting was a way of feeding their<br/>
&gt; family<br/>
&gt; ha<br/>
&gt; imagine the amount of food I&#39;d have come home with from the store<br/>
&gt; for the amount of money they spent on licenses, camping, equipment,<br/>
&gt; ammunition, supplies ect.<br/>
&gt; and if they had brought home game there is  also storage and processing to<br/>
&gt; pay for.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; if our younger son does show interest and receives the  shotgun he will<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; to pass   safety courses, keep the gun at grandpas, properly dispose of<br/>
&gt; unused bullets each time<br/>
&gt; and I will put every effort in to finding someone to train the three of<br/>
them<br/>
&gt; as the Olympic coach, I found  that taught Saturday  workshops for archery<br/>
&gt; to  our older son..<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll just agree to disagree on the gun issue<br/>
