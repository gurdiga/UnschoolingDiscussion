<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452519523">My girls are now 11 and 15.  I remember when they were younger, I used to try everything to get them to clean their bedrooms and pick up after themselves in the house.  I tried threats;  one day I told my then 4 yo DD that if she didn&#39;t pick up her toys then I was going to pick them up and bag them and put them up high and she could not play with them any more.  Well, after about 5 minutes she came out of her bedroom and said, &quot;OK Mom, you can have them!&quot;  I have tried bribing them for money, or docking their allowances.  Nothing seemed to work until one day, I told them, this is what they have to do.   Now I am not the best of housekeepers anyway, so when my oldest found out how much nicer it was to have a clean house, she started to pitch in a lot more.  When I start to clean the house, I usually hear, &quot;Who&#39;s coming over, Mom?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, maybe the cooperation comes with age!  I still let them do extra chores for money, but they willingly (sometimes with a grumble) do their regular chores.  Last week, my 15 yo DD actually washed the windows without me ever asking!  She never asked for money, but I paid her anyway, I was so grateful!  Now, this week, I have asked them to wash my car for money, but they have yet to wash it.  So if they are intrinsically motivated, they will do it.  If they realize that it is nicer and less stressful to have a clean house, they may be more motivated to help out. Of course, this theory will not work with a younger child who thinks a messy house is fun!<br/>
<br/>
Now, as for allowances, I pay my girls $1.00 a week per year of age they are.  For example my 11 year old daughter gets $11.00 a week, or $22.00 every pay day (every 2 weeks), and my 15 yo DD gets $30.00 every pay day.  I have been doing this since they were about 5 or 6 yo.  They both get a clothes budget when we do our big shopping trip twice a year.  I must say, they are better budgeters than I am!  I should just hand over the finances to them! ha ha! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1736672140">My tact on chores might not appeal to many but this is what I did. I <br/>
didn&#39;t insist that my daughter do any chores. She helped out when she <br/>
wanted to but I didn&#39;t pay her. Keeping the house clean was important <br/>
to me, not to her. I didn&#39;t think it was fair to make her keep her <br/>
room clean because that was how I liked it. It was her room to keep <br/>
as she pleased. She did ask me to help her clean it once in awhile <br/>
and we usually had fun organizing it all. She also gave me permission <br/>
to clean it if it ever got so bad I couldn&#39;t stand it. She is now 21 <br/>
and living on her own (with a roommate) and keeps her house nice. She <br/>
does all of the cooking, laundry, cleaning and vehicle upkeep without <br/>
anyone nagging her. I am so thankful that I didn&#39;t turn chores into <br/>
an issue when she was younger. We only have great memories to look <br/>
back on now, not memories of me nagging her.<br/>
<br/>
I did give her an allowance weekly. I doubled every dollar that she <br/>
put into her savings account so she was adamant about saving. I <br/>
looked at an allowance as giving her some independence. It&#39;s not like <br/>
she could get a job. She is now very frugal with her paychecks.<br/>

&gt; oldest has other chores she does: feed the animals, help set the table and<br/>
&gt; help clear it after every meal. She does not get allowance for doing her<br/>

&gt; stuff.<br/>
&gt; Hope this helps,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t do the chores thing, rather we all work together to keep the house<br/>
under control.  Since I&#39;m the parent home all day and I care the most about<br/>
its appearance, I do much of the work, but certainly not all.<br/>
<br/>
My dh does laundry when he&#39;s around, and helps clean some on the weekends.<br/>
Tim picks up his room as needed, or I&#39;ll help if it gets beyond him.  I<br/>
almost always reshelve books, because that&#39;s a task that&#39;s hard for him yet.<br/>
Tim will do most anything upon request, and has certain things he likes to<br/>
do.  His favorite at the moment is moving all the little stuff in the house<br/>
so I can vacuum around it.  Stuff like baskets, rocking horse, etc.  He also<br/>
helps clear the table, likes to help in the kitchen (sometimes), etc.<br/>
<br/>
He gets a little over $5 a week allowance (5 euros, we&#39;re in Germany), which<br/>
he puts 50 cents in the plate at church and 50 cents into his charity jar.<br/>
Eventually we&#39;ll send that to a charity of his choice, but it isn&#39;t full yet<br/>
and that was his goal.  The other 4 euros is his to spend, save, give, etc.<br/>
I&#39;m pleased to see that he&#39;s already learning to make good savings<br/>
decisions.  I buy all sorts of stuff for him, but not toys or stuffed<br/>
animals or the little sorts of things that kids often want.  He may choose<br/>
to buy them for himself, and occasionally does, but most of his pocket money<br/>
goes into savings.  He dips into that to spend the occasional large sum on a<br/>
coin (he&#39;s a coin collector), but mainly he is a miser!  His allowance is<br/>
not based on behavior at all; it&#39;s his even if we&#39;ve had a rough week.  (I<br/>
get to buy my choice of groceries even if my dh and I have had a big<br/>
disagreement, so I figured that&#39;s only fair!)<br/>
<br/>
For the record, he&#39;s also 6 years old.  We decided on the amount of his<br/>
allowance based on the ice cream truck.  :)   Tim was asking for icecream<br/>
every day, and I didn&#39;t want to necessarily buy it ever day.  So we started<br/>
discussed it, and decided that giving him the icecream money at the<br/>
beginning of the week, for him to choose if he wanted to spend it or not, or<br/>
if he wanted something more tangible for his money than icecream was his<br/>
choice.  (We also discussed where we spend our money, and he decided he&#39;d<br/>
like to tithe the church and charity, too.)  I do occasionally buy us both<br/>
icecream, and he&#39;ll sometimes ask for one when we&#39;re out and about, and I&#39;m<br/>
happy to buy.  But having money to spend has let him figure out what he<br/>
really wants and what is less important to him.  My concept is that he&#39;ll<br/>
get significantly more money as he gets older, and likely he&#39;ll budget that<br/>
to buy more of his own stuff.  But we&#39;re not there yet, so I don&#39;t know!<br/>
