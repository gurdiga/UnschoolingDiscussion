<div id="ygrps-yiv-462658630">I sent her to sandradodd.com which she loves and unschooling.com which she <br/>
hasn&#39;t gotten into as much.<br/>
<br/>
That came while I was writing and posting why Pam H should send me some <br/>
articles for that site! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This might be a link to somewhere, since it&#39;s all underlined.  Ooooh...  a <br/>
secret link to something...  (or not)<br/>

&lt;&lt; This was supposed to go to me instead of the group, in case you were all <br/>
wondering what in the world Sandra was saying! &lt;G&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Considering that the post that it was to follow didn&#39;t show up here, that&#39;s a <br/>
damned good theory.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote something about why Pam Hartley should write more, and it hasn&#39;t <br/>
surfaced here yet.  <br/>
<br/>
So when it DOES, then you could read that and go back and the AHA will make <br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
Or not. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
