<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114038753"><p><span>I&#39;ve read through the minimalism/abundance and creativity thread. &nbsp;May I ask about gratitude in children, and whether abundance fosters gratitude? &nbsp;We are slowly removing old thought patterns and have always restricted our children&#39;s toys (no plastic, no characters, no noises and lights, etc) and now I find that no matter what we do or give with our daughter (5yo), it&#39;s never good enough or enough. &nbsp;There always is a request for more toys, more treats, more games, more, more, more. &nbsp;While I know it&#39;s not a personal affront, it hurts to hear this because we just are not financially able to provide for every whim and desire. &nbsp;</span></p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-969245418">As a one-income family with 11 kids, we have never been able to provide the amount of toys, games, etc. as their friends&#39; parents. What I have found is that our kids are not the least bit resentful of this because they understand our situation. In fact, when we are able to buy new things for them- typically at Christmas and their birthdays- I find that they are more grateful and appreciative than their friends who receive stuff all the time. In our case, minimalism has definitely contributed to their gratitude.<div><br></div><div>Shelly</div></div>

<br/>
I don’t think that will count as the aesthetic minimalism people are talking about when they decorate sparsely.  Minimalism and paucity aren’t the same.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- In fact, when we are able to buy new things for them- typically at Christmas and their birthdays- I find that they are more grateful and appreciative than their friends who receive stuff all the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are very likely other factors.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids were happy with thrift-store toys, and occasional video games.  They had friends who wore name-brand clothes and fancy shoes (schooled kids and homeschoolers), but my kids were not needy.  <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally our children has insisted that kids who get too much are spoiled and ungrateful, while kids who are deprived will appreciate what they get.  But taken to an extreme, that means desperation will make people fawn and appreciate anything at all.  That can be a dangerous, in teens, sometimes.  Not so much with unschooling families where trust and communication are great, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-528426679"><p dir="ltr">I just wanted to share about my children. We&#39;re not rich but we are not poor either. Sometimes we have to say &#39;let&#39;s put it on your birthday list&#39; and we take a photo or talk about how fab it would be to own the thing. My children do not lack for an abundance of toys and other things either. They are genuinely both grateful and generous. I didn&#39;t need to create any arbitrary scarcity in order for them to develop such empathy as is required for gratitude and generosity, only to be grateful to and generous with them ourselves.</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481053371"><div dir="ltr">My daughter is five. To a degree, she can have whatever she wants. If she expresses an interest in something, or sees something which makes her eyes light up, I find a way to get it or get her access to it. Yes there&#39;s an element of privilege here I know, but I don&#39;t think we&#39;re excessive, and often the answer is that we can put it on her wishlist, or take a photograph so we remember it.<br><br>But, I think when children know that their desires are important and you take their requests seriously - thus they can have what they want wherever possible, the desire for whatever they CAN have minimises.<br><br>What I mean is, children who usually CAN&#39;T get what they want, or have to do a lot of asking before anything is granted, I think ask for more (on the off chance that this might be a yes day), and will take what they can have just because this is a rare occurrence of them being allowed something/anything. So they&#39;ll go to a toy shop and always want something, or several somethings, because there might not be another opportunity. Same as how some people always say yes to cake even if they don&#39;t really fancy it, because it&#39;s available and you take advantage of availability (artificial scarcity).<br><br>Thus, my daughter will often turn down a visit to a toy shop, and can visit them without actually wanting anything. This is actually also true of my two year old but she&#39;s not really old enough for me to feel confident to attribute the reason to abundance! I think she just doesn&#39;t really understand the idea of shops just yet.<br><br>I don&#39;t know if this addresses what you mean by gratitude. She certainly doesn&#39;t always jump over herself with gratitude when people expect it sometimes - for example when someone offers her some sweets or chocolate they seem to expect excitement and gratitude beyond what they&#39;d expect if they offered her a cheese sandwich. They are usually disappointed. In that respect abundance doesn&#39;t create gratitude. It&#39;s just food, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m sure something similar could apply to other things? If someone gives her a toy she doesn&#39;t want, she probably doesn&#39;t feel particularly excited or grateful and is too young really to feel a social pressure to pretend.  Is this a bad thing?<br><br>~Erica</div></div>

An expression, a hug.&gt;&gt;</span><br style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">I love what Kelly wrote. &nbsp;It got me thinking. &nbsp;Not everyone *wants* to express how they feel in words, too, I think. &nbsp;Ethan said his first words at around two years old. &nbsp;Before that he didn&#39;t babble at all. &nbsp;He kind of made &quot;ah ah ah&quot; sounds. &nbsp;It was very simple vocalization--more to get my attention and to express a feeling, than to communicate. &nbsp;He had happy &quot;ah ahs&quot; and frustrated &quot;ah ahs.&quot; &nbsp;But, most of how he communicated was in gestures, in physically guiding us, in the eyes, and in facial expressions. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Yet, my husband and I understood what he was communicating so much of the time. &nbsp;When he did start talking, within a very short period of time, he was making sentences. &nbsp;That was a relief to both Doug and I because people were starting to express their concern. &nbsp;Neither one of us was particularly concerned about Ethan, because he was able to communicate effectively enough to help us know how to meet his needs. &nbsp;But it was a relief not to have other people&#39;s worry to think about on top of this new parenting gig we were (often clumsily) trying to figure out.&nbsp;<br><br>Later, after Ethan had fun practicing his new language skill, he kind of went back to gesturing instead of talking sometimes. &nbsp;I actually remember asking him one time why he wasn&#39;t telling me what he wanted with his words, and he expressed that he liked trying to get me to understand him without words. &nbsp;Interesting eh?! &nbsp;I thought it was a game, but maybe it was more than that. &nbsp;Understanding his intentions, I happily played along. &nbsp;This lasted a pretty long time. &nbsp;Even to this day, Ethan likes to challenge me to understand him without words--communicating through gesturing, eye contact, and facial expressions. &nbsp;He thought miming was really interesting for a time.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">I feel like Ethan is really good at communicating his gratitude in ways that don&#39;t include a lot of words, or any words at all. &nbsp;It&#39;s very subtle. &nbsp;He&#39;s a very subtle person. &nbsp;A person close to him knows he is grateful for them in his life, I think. &nbsp;A person watching him play, knows he is grateful for his experience. &nbsp;He doesn&#39;t often say it with words though. &nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Maybe some people want to express what they&#39;re feeling without words. &nbsp;There is an intimacy about it, especially with people we&#39;re really close to. &nbsp;Maybe we need to learn to hear gratitude a different way. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">I think learning to see gratitude in our children is affected by how much gratitude we truly feel ourselves. &nbsp;Practice feeling more gratitude yourself. &nbsp;See things to be grateful for everywhere, especially your children and those you love most. &nbsp;You might find how subtle gratitude really is, and how much it can permeate everything we do, so that we no longer need to say in words &quot;I&#39;m grateful.&quot; &nbsp;We live in gratitude. &nbsp;I think children might be better at that than we are. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">I do think it&#39;s good to help our children help others hear what they hope to communicate, of course. &nbsp;I do notice that Ethan expresses his thanks in words more with people he doesn&#39;t know well. &nbsp;I think he&#39;s learned that in time, with experience and a growing understanding of people, with practice, and with our support. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Karen James</span></div></div>
