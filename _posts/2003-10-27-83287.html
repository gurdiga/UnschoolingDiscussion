<div id="ygrps-yiv-1099359716">As I read the article (and I apologize for being so late----yahoo vs aol is <br/>
SOOO infuriating, plus we were OOT for four days. So sorry), I saw the benefits <br/>
of what he was trying to convey with the IDEA of living in the real world as <br/>
opposed to schooling at home or HOMEschooling. But I cringed throughout the <br/>
piece. It *could* be that I&#39;m an atheist in the heart of the Bible Belt. &lt;BWG&gt; <br/>
It *could* be that because of my geographical location I&#39;m just a bit more <br/>
hypersensitive to &quot;fundie-speak&quot; than the average Joe. Could be.<br/>
<br/>
But even as I read it, I knew that I could probably send it to my in-laws and <br/>
that it might strike a cord with them. I won&#39;t, though. I couldn&#39;t in good <br/>
faith promote *anything* along those lines. Remove the bigotry, the hatred, the <br/>
euphemisms, and the bold-face religious aspect, and it might work for me.  <br/>
Like I said, the overall message is good---it&#39;s the underlying CRAP that does it <br/>
in! <br/>
<br/>
But this guy has an agenda. He also leaves his website available so that <br/>
unsuspecting folks will wander in and maybe &quot;see the light&quot; (just like Sandra <br/>
does----it&#39;s not ALL evil! &lt;G&gt;). On the bright side, I guess it *could* help the <br/>
fundies see that they DON&#39;T have to worship Bob Jones and Abeka and Sonlight <br/>
and that it *could* help their children to have happier, more joyful lives. So <br/>
I&#39;ve got to give him that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe that the article was written for *US*; his audience is really <br/>
right-wing, fundamentalist Christians who (in my opinion) DO need to lighten <br/>
up and see that learning exists in the great, big, wild, wide world (although <br/>
he might argue that the world shouldn&#39;t be *that* great*, *that* big, *that* <br/>
wild, or *that* wide!). But I&#39;ll give him credit for trying to open up their <br/>
&quot;schooling&quot; world a bit!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;ll rewrite it to be more &quot;unschoolingly politically correct&quot;. &lt;g&gt; You <br/>
notice he NEVER used that word, &quot;unschooling&quot;----it would put off too many of <br/>
his audience members!  I&#39;ll work on that today and see whether it can be <br/>
fixed. Until then, I&#39;ll definitely refrain from sending it on!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225862151">What you wrote is pretty much where I was at on it. Here many HSers do follow <br/>
a religion and would benefit from relaxing and I agree this article was <br/>
saying just that to them.<br/>
I should not have forwarded it to this list and NO I dont think many if any <br/>
on this list need the sting (to relax) from a religious end. I do however think <br/>
that those who know others may benefit from some of the comments especially <br/>
the curriculum part. It would have been misleading for me to pick the post <br/>
apart and send to the list but for others sake I totally would and did.<br/>
