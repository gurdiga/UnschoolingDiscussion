<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181370889">Hello, <br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t had a chance to read or post much of what is going around <br/>
in this egroup lately. Some of yo might recognize my name here and <br/>
there.  Maybe no one will LOL.  I have been tied up with my ds, who <br/>
was due for oral surgery this past tuesday.  I had to make him aware <br/>
that it was ok and he was going to be safe.  Anyway I figure I say <br/>
hello again, and make my presence known.  <br/>
<br/>
