<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126135304">I am on an anthropological quest as I am dealing with those negative folks who worry about my kids missing out on all that &quot;socialization&quot; they get in school.<br/>
Do you guys  feel that our society over values or emphasizes this value to an extreme degree not natural for all esp. in an institutional setting?<br/>
Up here in  New England they are penalized for even being a minute late getting in the classroom. I think we may always be late to things we just don&#39;t enjoy but even getting to work on time is not something my DH is good at even though he likes going to work most days. I look forward to not having to be on time for school every morning. Am I teaching negative values or just that being on time isn&#39;t as important as sense of self? Socializing by being silent and still in a group setting as in the military is also against my core beliefs. I am sure all cultures have their peer pressures. I am happy that in this day and age we don&#39;t have to give in to any peer pressure of any kind  and really know freedom is there something wrong with this that I am missing?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851684521">The type of socialization you mentioned is valuable in my opinion, especially if the following are all you want your kids to be about:  being popular, egotisical, getting into the right college, driving an expensive car, getting a high paying yes man job, marrying into the right family, knowing all the right people, avoiding the wrong people like the plague, keeping up with the Joneses and so on and so on until they retire right before they die from the stress and then realize they don&#39;t have a clue who they are and just spend the rest of their days in front of the TV set.<br/>
<br/>
Not me, and not you guys, or you probably wouldn&#39;t be on this list  :)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, it just came out!   LOL<br/>

I feel that this study would be severely biased if you are planning to survey <br/>
this group.  Like &quot;preaching to the choir.&quot;  Of course, most of us are going <br/>
to agree with you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420408108">Was it someone on this list who gave the classic reply to the question<br/>
whether our children have a problem with socialization?<br/>
<br/>
THE ANSWER:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, at first it was a problem, but since we&#39;ve cut back on outside<br/>
activities and play dates, I think we&#39;ve gotten it under control.&quot;<br/>
