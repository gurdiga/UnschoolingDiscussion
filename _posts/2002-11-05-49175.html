dealing with a tantrum.  The article advocates remaining close during the <br/>

  I just have to get everyone who hasn&#39;t read the current issue of Mothering to <br/>
  read the article on tantrums.  It is the best thing I&#39;ve ever read, and not <br/>
  just because it reinforces what I&#39;ve always felt is the best method of <br/>
  dealing with a tantrum.  The article advocates remaining close during the <br/>
  tantrum, focusing and listening to the child in distress but letting them <br/>
  ride it out.  I wish I had seen it two years ago when tantrums first came <br/>
