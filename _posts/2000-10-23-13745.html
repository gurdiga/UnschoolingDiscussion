I was able to purchase the test and have a friend administer it at our
home. (Parents aren&#39;t allow to give the test in grades 3, 5, and 8 )&nbsp;
My friend read the questions and answers (multiple choice) and the children
filled in the dots.&nbsp; We found that the schools do the same thing for
late readers. :-)
<br>Something an evaluator and good friend told me recently was that home
educators in our state [PA] are worried about the schools trying to force
our children into school if they don&#39;t do well on the test.&nbsp; When
in fact, the schools want the children with <u>good</u> test scores to
make the schools look good.&nbsp; They DON&#39;T want the poor scorers.&nbsp;
She tells people to buy the test, turn in a blank answer sheet and the
resulting score.
<br>Since we&#39;re also required to show portfolios and logs each year along
with an evaluation for proof of progress and appropriate education, they&#39;d
have quite a battle trying to prove anything other than the child is a
poor test taker. :-)

Hi John.  I don&#39;t remember Oregon&#39;s requirements, but have you looked into<br/>
FLO? (Family Learning Organization). You can purchase standardized tests<br/>
from them. I did this with my almost 11 yo last spring. Her first test. It<br/>
was easy that way....it was mailed to me and I administered it here at home,<br/>
then just mailed it all back to FLO and they sent me the results. They have<br/>
a wide variety of tests to choose from. We used the Metropolitan and it cost<br/>
$22.<br/>
