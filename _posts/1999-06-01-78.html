<div id="ygrps-yiv-1867970058">I would have to agree with many points brought up in this post. One is the reason<br/>
I took my 5 year old daughter out of school, MAJOR frustration with the system<br/>

we get rid of this fear that we aren&#39;t &quot;teaching&quot; our children enough? <br/>

my daughter for a few months, so that is probably why it &quot;seems&quot; so difficult<br/>

(9) and Emma Rose (6).  I think one thing which helps is transitioning from <br/>
what we&#39;re teaching to what they&#39;re learning.   I was taught many things in <br/>
school, but retained those which I wanted to learn.  I think the same is true <br/>
at home -- and we waste less time and experience less aggravation when we <br/>
focus on what our children want to learn rather than what we want to or feel <br/>
we should teach.  <br/>
<br/>
We facilitate, we provide, we support, we explore, we introduce -- but they <br/>
learn or not, as they see fit.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081126909">In order to help my fears, I have to stop comparing my kids to other children.<br/>
If I do that, then I forget of wonderful and unique each one is.<br/>
My children are great, well mannered kids.  Everyone who meets them thinks they are<br/>
wonderful.  They carry on conversations with adult and children alike.  They know many<br/>
things, much of which can&#39;t be measured in any way.<br/>
I keep telling myself, that the &quot;other&quot;  stuff will be learned much more quickly and<br/>
happily, and thoroughly when they have a need and want to know it.<br/>
Yes, its hard....  There are lots of doubts, but I know in my heart they are great<br/>
very happy kids.<br/>
An if all else fails, I talk to a friend who is in our homeschool group.  She does<br/>
more structure than I, and her kids are more book smart than mine, but she still<br/>
reminds me off how wonderful they are and all the things they DO know.<br/>

&lt;&lt; e other reason I get doubtful about unschooling is because I value the <br/>
concepts<br/>
 of duty, responsibility, self-discipline and unselfishness. I guess I worry <br/>
that<br/>
 my children may become self-absorbed and undisciplined if they only have to<br/>
 please themselves. I am old-fashioned in some ways I guess. Still, it <br/>
wouldn&#39;t<br/>
 make any sense to do school-at-home as some kind of excercise in moral<br/>
 development, would it? That sounds ridiculous when I write it down.<br/>
 <br/>
 For now we are pretty unstructured (except for &#39;&#39;math time&#39;&#39; when they get my<br/>
 full attention and like it!). I hope that our rules/expectations about the <br/>
kids&#39;<br/>
 social/personal behavior and the religious influences on them are enough to <br/>
form<br/>
 good characters.<br/>
 <br/>
 Anyone else have these worries about the &quot;unschooling character?&#39;&#39;<br/>

<br/>
It is easy to get caught up in the worry of &quot;what about learning some <br/>
structure&quot;.  Here is what I have discovered.  <br/>
<br/>
My DS (16) is in Civil Air Patrol - he must be there at the appointed time, <br/>
in uniform, ready to work.  He has a job at a theatre, he must be there on <br/>
time, ready to work, in uniform.  He likes the church youth group, he must be <br/>
there on time, ready for whatever it is they are planning (He is a student <br/>
leader there).  Plenty of structure.  not to mention orthondist appointments, <br/>
time arranged with friends, etc.  He has learned about standing in line, by <br/>
standing in lines that mean something. (Grocery store, movie theatres, &quot;chow <br/>
line&quot; on camping trips)<br/>
<br/>
DD (13) has voice/piano lesson, she has to be there on time, or lose some of <br/>
the lesson time.  She babysits a lot - she must be ready to go on time, or be <br/>
deemed unreliable and lose some jobs.  <br/>
<br/>
DDs (8, 6, 3) have Spanish lessons - they must be ready to go on time, or <br/>
lose out on some of the lesson ( they learned the hard way...10 minutes late <br/>
for a 45 minute lesson eliminates one whole game they can play.!)<br/>
<br/>
There are PLENTY of real life things that help teach structure, timeliness, <br/>
courtesy, etc.  Schools manufacture these things, and are not very effective <br/>
at it.  Have you ever SEEN a line-up of kids at a school??  All pushing and <br/>
shoving and trying to be first....  That won&#39;t go over real well in the real <br/>
world....<br/>
<br/>
It takes self-discipline to get yourself ready for the things you want to do, <br/>
it takes structure sometimes.  Because our children &quot;follow their bliss&quot; in <br/>
their educational choices, because we see education in everything we do <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t have responsibilities too.  We have a large <br/>
family (7th child is on the way) - even the 1-1/2 year old is encouraged to <br/>
pick up her toys, take her dish to the sink (where mom or dad or sibling puts <br/>
it in sink/dishwasher).  These things are naturally learned as being part of <br/>
a family, and are an important part of their overall education.  Once a week <br/>
or so, the children are required to pick up their rooms, they don&#39;t have to <br/>
keep them spotless all the time, but periodically they must be &quot;company <br/>
ready&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Step into the adventure, and notice things that already teach the stuff you <br/>
are worried about, soon you will see a &quot;whole life education&quot; forming!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-114460709">Hi Mary,<br/>
<br/>
This is Catharine. Thanks for the great message about homelife structure and its<br/>
character-building power. The reminders about structure in family life really hit<br/>
home. I guess one can be an unschooler and still not be too &#39;&#39;permissive.&#39;&#39; (Or maybe<br/>
the point is that often the unschooled kids learn the consequences without even<br/>
causing the parents&#39; authority to be to taxed...)<br/>
Wow, seven kids! That&#39;s great!</div>
