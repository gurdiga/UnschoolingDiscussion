&gt; &lt;&lt;Just wondering if, regardless of tone and intent, pointing out a fact <br/>
&gt; (sound, <br/>
&gt; in this case) robs a child of the possibility of self-discovery and pure <br/>
&gt; &quot;ownership&quot; of a know... &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would that go for everything?  Patterns in nature?  Geography?  Bird <br/>
&gt; watching?  <br/>
&gt; Do you intend to never point out ANYTHING that&#39;s interesting?  A new tomato <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; on the vine?  The big gross tomato worm?  (We finally got one this year, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; Holly had never seen one, but we opted out of keeping it for <br/>
&gt; transformation.  <br/>
&gt; We thought we&#39;d leave it on the vine and watch it.  ONE DAY later a whole <br/>
&gt; plant was eaten up, so we relocated him into a vacant lot, but didn&#39;t stay <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; see the birds find him.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about the idea of the moment of silence (like a holy moment..I know I&#39;m <br/>
wierd...but to me its a holy opportunity for the child to own that <br/>
know!!!)...giving the child the chance to be the discoverer....<br/>
<br/>
I point out all the time...I don&#39;t want to be &quot;the Master Guru of Knowledge!&quot; <br/>
 Maybe my children notice enough and what they want (and that is enoiugh) <br/>
without the need for me to point out for them....i am pondering this <br/>
idea.....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Anyway...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s interesting figuring out where our threshholds are on different <br/>
&gt; things.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;We&#39;ve always played rhyming games in the car just for fun, and number <br/>
&gt; games, <br/>
&gt; and had tapes in to sing along and some of those had &quot;educational content&quot; <br/>
&gt; and we always managed to enjoy and glean coolness from the most base or <br/>
&gt; vile <br/>
&gt; or goofy stuff as well.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And my children play all kinds of computer games that all loaded with <br/>
&quot;educational content.&quot;  They love them.  They are fun!  I am just pondering <br/>
my role.....well, and just the whole idea of phonics whatever the source....I <br/>
get the idea of assisting with the grappling of a word...providing clarity <br/>
when souight/truly needed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;If a word looks like or sounds like another word, and if the kid is right <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; there anyway (looking for other words that are a lot like &quot;Holly&quot; and I <br/>
&gt; point <br/>
&gt; out &quot;jolly&quot;) that&#39;s not different from &quot;Eeyew!  A tomato worm!&quot; or &quot;Look at <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; the frost patterns on the windshield!&quot;   *if* the family is accustomed to <br/>
&gt; finding happy joy in little discoveries anyway.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m thinking that might depend, as well, on the child and how the child <br/>
perceives the pointing out....regardless of,or possibly beyond the sharing <br/>
joys and individual discoveries, of course...not seeing what that has to do <br/>
with it...perhaps I am misinterpreting what you mean here....seems to me that <br/>
family is made up of individual beings with individuals ways of wanting to <br/>
experience life and learning.  I am talking more about giving the child a <br/>
chance to discover, unearth, build her own knowledge based on her own <br/>
observations.  Not saying that no observation should ever be shared with the <br/>
child.  Not talking that black white...more the fine line.  That&#39;s what I am <br/>
pondering...that fine line.<br/>

None of my kids ever went to school, and that could be a factor.  They <br/>
haven&#39;t been &quot;educated.&quot;  So they see any sort of pointing out of interesting <br/>
details the same whether it&#39;s about a D&D character or a Jay and Silent Bob <br/>
movie or the history of English.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My dd (5.5) has never been to school either, nor has my son (2.5).  I am <br/>
going beyond talking about acceptance of another&#39;s observation/my discovery <br/>
(mine to my children).  My dd lightens up/shines with joy and pride <br/>
double/triple when the discovery is hers....I think that maybe some children <br/>
are just by nature private learners and like to make their own discoveries.  <br/>
Again, I am not talking black and white and the fine line may not even be <br/>
straight!  I am pondering, not challenging.  ALso thinking about me (The mom) <br/>
not drawing the conclusion for my children, but letting ideas sit in their <br/>
heads for them to draw conclusions on as and when they wish, if ever.  I am <br/>
unschooling myself...helps me to talk abouit it ...so thanks!<br/>
