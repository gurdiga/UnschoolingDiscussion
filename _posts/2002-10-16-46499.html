<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646242508">&lt;I think I&#39;m rambling a bit......so to summarize - I think honoringothers is a choice.  And I think honoring those who seem difficult to love<br/>
and honor is a difficult choice.  It&#39;s the example I want my children to see.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree, Susan. :-) I think I have a choice to honour and respect my parents, my dh, my children, others - and my children can observe my choice and discuss this with me. I think free will, the choice to choose how to act, is imperative ...And my children have the same free will as I, plus my example and my reasons why I choose to honour/act as I do...Leonie W. <br/>
