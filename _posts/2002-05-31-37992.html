<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; One <br/>
&gt; example is her constant need to argue, talk back, and not let things go. <br/>
&gt; She <br/>
&gt; is very persistent, and I can be very impatient. I don&#39;t want to stifle a <br/>
&gt; trait that could be an asset in adulthood under the proper circumstances. <br/>
&gt; She <br/>
&gt; would make a great lawyer. But it makes for a very tense situation when she <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; would rather argue something into the ground and become belligerent and <br/>
&gt; disrespectful over something trivial to me. So I guess I can learn to argue <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; with her(not against her) in a productive way, and try to model to her the <br/>
&gt; respectful way to do so.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You can learn to keep your cool, not get exasperated, be able to move her on <br/>
to something else smoothly, etc. You can, for example, ask very directly <br/>
sometimes, &quot;Is this worth us spending our time arguing about or do you think <br/>
it would be better to get going and go get our ice cream now?&quot; &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Or sometimes you can STOP arguing by making nonargumentative comments, <br/>
without really conceding: &quot;You know - you do make a good point.&quot; Then just <br/>
move on.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve experimented with a lot of things -- but if you&#39;re <br/>
still ending up tense and exasperated (as opposed to having perspective <br/>
enough even at the time to grin and think, to yourself, &quot;whew - one <br/>
persistent kid&quot;) then maybe people here can brainstorm a lot of different <br/>
ways to handle a very argumentative kids (my middle daughter has been known <br/>
to be like that, too, during different stages in her life).<br/>
<br/>
Also - like you said, she may be wanting your focussed attention more than <br/>
anything else. Arguing is really GOOD for getting that. Some kids don&#39;t seem <br/>
to ever be able to get enough - that can be SO hard on moms and sometimes you <br/>
have to be okay with knowing that you ARE giving a reasonable amount of <br/>
direct attention - even if the child doesn&#39;t seem to think she&#39;s getting <br/>
enough. <br/>
<br/>
Also - arguing is GOOD for developing thinking ability. I once asked David <br/>
Colfax how he&#39;d describe what their kids&#39; learning was like - or some other <br/>
lame question &lt;G&gt; - and he said that it was at dinner-table arguments that <br/>
the kids really learned to think. But you have to get her to argue bigger <br/>
more significant principles - not little petty trivial stuff that drives you <br/>
nuts. So - maybe start asking her - &quot;What do you think about .......?&quot;  Ask <br/>
things that might seem beyond her years -- let her take a stand that you <br/>
don&#39;t agree with. Don&#39;t just beat her at arguing either - give her a lot of <br/>
respect for coming up with good arguments even if you don&#39;t agree with them.<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you keep track, for a day or two, about what things she&#39;s <br/>
argumentative about? Tell us and we&#39;ll help you think of alternatives ways to <br/>
handle it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think many of us have kids whose personalities don&#39;t &quot;fit&quot; well with our <br/>
own. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not accusing you of this, Ang, but I do know someone who is CONVINCED <br/>
that her youngest child is ADHD -- SHE got a diagnosis from the pediatrician <br/>
- but it is based on HER own reports about her child&#39;s behavior.<br/>
<br/>
This mom is VERY &quot;mild&quot; -- she&#39;s reserved and introverted and is exhausted by <br/>
doing even one little activity outside the house in a day. Her husband is the <br/>
same way. She has another child like that too. But one of her kids seems to <br/>
HER to have all those ADD symptoms. In MY family this child would be seen as <br/>
quiet, calm, passive, and not very social. In THEIR family - she is seen as <br/>
explosive and wild and wanting to be with her friends &quot;all the time.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
A bad fit is hard - and it is parents who have the responsibility to let the <br/>
kids live the way they need to in order to be happy. Within reason, of <br/>
course.<br/>

&gt; I realize this is a simplistic point and the discussion has been a lot<br/>
&gt; more subtle and complicated than this.  However, in the past, in<br/>
&gt; settings that tended to be punitive or controlling, I can see how the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It well might make a TEACHER be nicer to a kid if the teacher thinks that the <br/>
kid &quot;can&#39;t help it&quot; because he/she has ADD.<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn&#39;t matter to a parent, of course, but - you know - maybe that&#39;s <br/>
wishful thinking.<br/>
