<div id="ygrps-yiv-324226560">Yesterday my 9ds big stuff fish he won from the fair split open. What<br/>
a wonderful joyous time we had, making &quot;snow&quot; angels in his room,<br/>
throwing it at the fan and watching it fly, just rolling and playing<br/>
in it. Well now comes time to clean it up. (Must all good things come<br/>
to an end :( . Well it is everywhere in the house even a few in the<br/>
fridge LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I have went through 14 vacuum cleaner bags even emptying some out to<br/>
reuse. <br/>
<br/>
My question is is ther anyone who has been thru this and knows any<br/>
secret tricks to cleaning theses up. I would appreciate any advice !!!!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well I went through this with two bean bag chairs, as I have told the story<br/>
before. After a week of playing in the &quot;snow&quot; I used a scoop and pour method<br/>
using a clean dustpan and later a small sand shovel. However it may not be<br/>
the method you will like since I only ended up with enough beans to refill<br/>
ONE chair! Tiny beans still show up periodically behind bookshelves etc<br/>
about three years later. <br/>
<br/>
But it was less work for my preferences than vacuuming - and I hate the<br/>
process of changing bags so the idea of emptying and reusing makes me think<br/>
of the labors of Hercules! <br/>

A shop vac!<br/>
Our bean bag chairs have blown open a couple times. Daily we have paper,pop  <br/>
corn and left over creations<br/>
The shop vac has been the fastest picker-upper yet. My kids especially  the 2 <br/>
& 4 yo&#39;s love to vac so I just go in and finish if there is any left.  We <br/>
have wood floors so that may make a difference..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074513189">Get a big shopvac.<br/>
<br/>
I think that would probably work the fastest.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember how we cleaned it all up when it happened to us many moons <br/>
ago :o).<br/>
