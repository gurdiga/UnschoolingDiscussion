<div>That&#39;s how I took the lack of Faith comment.&nbsp; I thought it was said 
because our group doesn&#39;t have a statement to sign.&nbsp; More like lack of a 
statement or criteria to join rather then a lack of faith.&nbsp; Because we have 
definitely grown very much from learning about the others beliefs in our 
group.&nbsp; Bonnie</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><tt>I believe the Lack of Faith statement was made in jest, like giving him 
a<br>taste of what they did to her. My experience in this group is people 
are<br>willing to&nbsp; hear others point of view and sometimes debate them, we 
are<br>entitled to be ourselves. Anyone agree?<br>Johanna<br><br></tt></div>

<div>Matter of fact a friend of mine is Catholic and she said that the priest at 
<br>her church told her to not sign it. Why would a Christian group make a 
<br>statement of Faith that a Catholic cannot sign? I do not like it and so we 
<br>have no homeschool group. <br></div>

<br/>
Having just come out of this kind of background I can tell you.  <br/>
Conservative, fundamentalist Christians often don&#39;t accept <br/>
Catholics as &quot;Christians&quot; because Catholics don&#39;t believe in being <br/>
&quot;born again.&quot;  To a fundamentalist Christian, if you&#39;re not born <br/>
again, you are not saved, and therefore not going to heaven.<br/>
<br/>
I thank my God that I finally saw that this kind of orientation is not <br/>
Christian at all, and we finally left the &quot;mainstream&quot; church to form <br/>
our own homechurch.  It&#39;s very non-traditional and probably no self-<br/>
respecting &quot;fundamentalist&quot; would be caught dead there.  We <br/>
believe that we are all God&#39;s children and that the teachings of <br/>
Jesus are for the purpose of showing us how to live better lives, and <br/>
are NOT designed to exclude people from fellowship, or from <br/>
heaven.<br/>
<br/>
For a good contrast between these two &quot;sides&quot; of Christianity, I <br/>
recommend the book &quot;Stealing Jesus:  How Fundamentalism <br/>
Betrays Christianity&quot; by Bruce Bawer.<br/>

Yes, see what I mean. One of the statements that was required to sign (I <br/>
think there was 10 ) was something that the Priest said that a Catholic in <br/>
good Faith could not sign. I am not Catholic so I do not know a lot about <br/>
their beliefs but I thought this was a bit ridicules <br/>

<br/>
***It&#39;s just splitting hairs again. There are many branches of Christianity.<br/>
Catholicism was one of the first. Some Christians are more picky about the<br/>
differences, saying because this other branch believes &quot;x&quot; and not &quot;z&quot; then<br/>
they aren&#39;t really Christian. Many more Fundamental Christians do not<br/>
believe Catholics to be real Christians because they did not come into the<br/>
faith the same way. It all depends on your personal interpretation of<br/>
scripture. Yes, Catholics believe in Christ.<br/>
