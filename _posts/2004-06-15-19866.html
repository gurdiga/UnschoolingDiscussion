<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035112558">I am wondering how you all explain sharing to your children. I have <br/>
an only child (3 years old) who doesn&#39;t have frequent opportunities <br/>
to practice sharing since my husband and I share most everything with <br/>
him it is seldom an issue. However, when children come to visit, at <br/>
his request or desire, sharing is more complicated to explain. We <br/>
have told him he doesn&#39;t have to share, but that sharing is fun and <br/>
that if he doesn&#39;t want to share his toys we can put specific ones <br/>
away in advance. However, when something is being played with by <br/>
another child it becomes so much more desirable.<br/>
<br/>
I have explained that if he doesn&#39;t want to share the toys that it <br/>
isn&#39;t fun for the other child and they may not want to stay, since <br/>
they can&#39;t play. This is usually after several attempts to redirect, <br/>
suggesting taking turns, offering to refuel with something to eat... <br/>
offering that perhaps he is done having company and prefers that he <br/>
have some space or time to play alone. He usually still wants to <br/>
play, however, it does continue to be a struggle over whichever toy <br/>
is in action. The other child of cource has the option of <br/>
disengaging, leaving, protesting. <br/>
<br/>
But what is your &quot;principle&quot; about &quot;having&quot; to share? I can imagine <br/>
how it would be necessary to share/take turns with multiple children <br/>
in the same faimly. How do you articulate it?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-996060146">Part of your issues could be his age.  I have a 3 1/2 yr old dd (out of <br/>
4 dd&#39;s) and a 3 1/2 yr old niece.  Both have issues with sharing.  I <br/>
simply ask my dd (when my niece is over) if it would be all right to go <br/>
to visit her cousin and not be allowed to play with any of the toys.  I <br/>
try to get her to imagine what it&#39;s like to be the child who is not <br/>
shared with.  I know she can relate to this because her cousin has many <br/>
times not shared toys with her and my dd was very upset by this.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck.   Heidi<br/>

I am  wondering how you all explain sharing to your children. I have <br/>
an only  child (3 years old) who doesn&#39;t have frequent opportunities <br/>
to practice  sharing since my husband and I share most everything with <br/>
him it is seldom  an issue.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think three year olds are meant to share.<br/>
 <br/>
I think that, by modeling sharing---as you&#39;re doing, he&#39;ll learn it and  <br/>
share in his own time. When he&#39;s ready.<br/>
 <br/>
And &quot;practice sharing&quot;???? You either do or you don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think  there&#39;s <br/>
any need for him to &quot;practice&quot; it!<br/>
 <br/>
I have two &quot;onlies&quot;. They&#39;re eight years apart, so neither ever *had* to  <br/>
share. Both are MUCH more generous than any of their friends or  cousins with <br/>
close siblings who were made to share. Being *made* to share  results in a person <br/>
who WON&#39;T.<br/>
 <br/>
I bet by five he&#39;ll be a sharing machine! Time and patience and modeling.  <br/>
You be generous, and he will.<br/>

non-issue! Don&#39;t make it one! <br/>

Kelly wrote that.  It&#39;s a great plan if that three year old isn&#39;t having <br/>
company over who need toys to play with.<br/>
<br/>
One way I handled sharing with kids who visited was to have toys that were <br/>
MINE, or the whole family&#39;s, and I shared.  Kirby&#39;s Ninja Turtles were never <br/>
shared unless he chose to.  If we had many kids over, they were put up and away.  <br/>
Marty&#39;s Lego, ditto.<br/>
<br/>
We had a &quot;he&#39;s company, let him choose&quot; default tie-breaker rule if they were <br/>
deciding who got to play which role, or who had first pick of swords or <br/>
whatever.  That worked well.  <br/>
<br/>
If Marty was horning in on Kirby&#39;s play and Kirby was getting grumpy, I would <br/>
extract one of them tactfully/subtly (usually Marty) to do something better.  <br/>
See a bird&#39;s nest, very quietly, or help me choose what to make for lunch, or <br/>
check the mailbox, and sit on the porch and go through the pile.   Both <br/>
calmed down.<br/>
<br/>
The most knock-down, drag-out fight I ever remember, there were three <br/>
visiting kids, when they were all in the 3-6 age range and we had all our mostly-used <br/>
Fisher Price stuff out.  Lots of people, buildings, cars.   And somehow <br/>
everybody wanted the farmer.  Whoever didn&#39;t have the farmer was screaming, and <br/>
whoever DID have the farmer was screaming to protect it from everyone else trying <br/>
to take it.  I came in, and being the tallest said &quot;Wait, let me hold the <br/>
farmer a minute!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
None of my lame suggestions were helping, and I thought &quot;Hmmm....   when did <br/>
I give them a snack?  Ooops...&quot;  I think they wanted to eat the farmer.<br/>
<br/>
So I made lunch with the farmer in my pocket and figured we&#39;d have lots of <br/>
ways to see who got the farmer first, and next...  But after lunch they took off <br/>
to do other things.  I parked the farmer in his tractor by his silo, and <br/>
nobody ever played with the poor farmer for the rest of the afternoon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936550349">I posted a couple of weeks ago about how to discuss sharing with my 3 <br/>
y/o son. Several messages suggested the positive aspects of sharing. <br/>
I had thought and said that &quot;sharing is fun&quot;, but had empathized with <br/>
him that &quot;waiting is hard&quot;. I now see that this projected a negative <br/>
attitude on the events surrounding waiting. I gleemed that I could <br/>
try to change the waiting to fun, but I felt that I had tried that  <br/>
with distractions, alternative toys, redirecting, etc. I had even <br/>
explained that we all &quot;had&quot; to wait but that we could do something <br/>
while we waited, like sing or whatever to make it fun. <br/>
<br/>
However, as my son and I were drawing together, he stopped and <br/>
watched me draw. Then, I realized that &quot;watching&quot; someone else take a <br/>
turn could be fun itself. This eliminated &quot;waiting&quot; entirely. <br/>
Watching someone take a turn could be its own activity! I also <br/>
appreciated the suggestion on line to share the person&#39;s enjoyment <br/>
while they were taking their turn. In advance of having company, I <br/>
began suggesting the idea of letting the company take a turn first so <br/>
that we could watch. THIS WORKED!<br/>
<br/>
Now, I have noticed Erik playing &quot;taking turns&quot; and &quot;watching&quot;. He <br/>
has incorporated it into his pretend play. It is amazing how I <br/>
projected this without realizing it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the ideas.<br/>
