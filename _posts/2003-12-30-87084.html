<br/>
Do you really think watching tv is &quot;doing nothing and just sitting and not <br/>
thinking&quot;?<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
If you &quot;shut the TV off&quot; against his will, would you do that to your husband? <br/>
 A guest?  Your neighbor?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t sound healthy or loving.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it still ok to shut it off and &quot;make him&quot; do other things? Should I<br/>
have a talk with him about the overuse first?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Neither.   Provide something better.  LOTS of choices better.  Not just two <br/>
choices.  Get out and about.   What you&#39;re describing isn&#39;t unschooling.  It&#39;s <br/>
still control, it&#39;s just neglectful control.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an article called &quot;Disposable Checklists for Unschoolers&quot; that should <br/>
give you lots of easy ideas to transition:<br/>

out are much more inviting than stuff that&#39;s behind cabinet doors or in a <br/>
closet. If you have a place where you can set up some nice markers, pencils <br/>
and paper, that is much more attractive an option than a bunch of stuff <br/>
hidden in a drawer somewhere. This is why I love shelves, though I realize <br/>
not everyone wants or can live this way.<br/>
<br/>
Invitations also work better than suggestions. Take out a game, start <br/>
setting it up and invite him to come and play. Same thing with art, baking, <br/>
whatever. If you can&#39;t have it out for them to see all the time, then you <br/>
pull it out. If they say no, play around with it yourself, chances are <br/>
they&#39;ll come join you. My kids are far more likely to go outside and play <br/>
if I put on my shoes and coat and invite them out than if I just suggest <br/>
they go run around outside, know what I mean?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is sooo true!  TV, Soda pop, candy, computer<br/>
time, bedtime...<br/>
<br/>
When I let go of the limits on soda, I thought I would<br/>
go crazy.  My kids were drinking like 4 cases of soda<br/>
a week (2 kids...the youngest hates soda).  <br/>
<br/>
I hung in there and every time they asked, I said<br/>
&quot;yes&quot; and meant it.  <br/>
<br/>
Last week I bought a case of soda, and it lasted until<br/>
yesterday, when my nephews came over to visit and<br/>
drank three or four a piece.  The younger one asked my<br/>
12yo if he wanted a soda and he said, &quot;Nah, I have a<br/>
glass of milk instead.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The nephews love my house, where there are no limits<br/>
on bedtime and food, and so they party hard while they<br/>
are here, unless their mom catches them, then she<br/>
makes them stop.<br/>
<br/>
My two younger kids go to bed pretty early, because<br/>
they still like to have me tuck them in and say<br/>
prayers, and I want to be in bed by 11 or so.  So when<br/>
the nephs are over and want to stay up all night, my<br/>
kids want to go to bed, and my nephs think they are<br/>
big party poopers.  My 14yo usually stays up until<br/>
about 2am.<br/>

I wonder if he would like more time with friends closer to his age for <br/>
imaginative play.  My children will play imaginative games for hours and find this a <br/>
lot more fun than TV.  I think some adults have trouble fitting into this <br/>
type of play (too controlling or get bored) and his brother may be too young.  I <br/>
also live in an urban area, and I have a steady stream of neighborhood kids in <br/>
my house.  This is probably one of the few places where they feel free to <br/>
play as they want.  Maybe you could watch for neighborhood kids with nothing to <br/>
do who might want to play indoors or out with him.  Be open to the idea that <br/>
the ideal playmate might be older or younger or not quite who you would expect.  <br/>

all the games, arts and crafts and other cool stuff.<br/>

invite either child to play a game that was in full view<br/>
each day, the answer would still be yes. Right?<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m debating what to do in our new house..open shelves or cabinets for <br/>
all the games, arts and crafts and other cool stuff.<br/>

Whatever has come out new here gets played with, and what&#39;s been out too long <br/>
becomes invisible.<br/>
<br/>
I consider that a big part of my &quot;strewing,&quot; is setting things out that <br/>
haven&#39;t been out for a while, and putting the other stuff away.<br/>

Isn&#39;t this the truth?  I found out (although it should have occurred <br/>
to me much sooner) when we moved from CA to NV.  We formaly moved to <br/>
NV in Aug but our house but our home wasn&#39;t ready to move into until <br/>
Nov.  In the mean time, we lived in a residential hotel which means <br/>
that we had to severly limit what we could take with us to the hotel <br/>
and what had to go to storage.  My daughter had very few &quot;things&quot; to <br/>
play with.  When we finally moved into our home and she had her toy <br/>
box back.....you would have thought that Santa had come early.  Toys <br/>
that she had stoped playing with even before we moved were suddenly <br/>
much more interesting and fun.  We hardly had to buy her anything <br/>
for Christmas.....she was so excited to have her &quot;old&quot; toys back <br/>
that she played with them like they were brand new.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love that word. About a year ago there was this huge debate about <br/>
strewing on this list. It just put everything into perspective for me. <br/>
As you have said many times, it takes more involvement for a parent to <br/>
unschool than to school-at-home. With strewing, I sometimes leave <br/>
things out the night before to see whether they will use them or not. <br/>
Like paper, sticker, markers, beads, puzzles, mazes, blocks. It&#39;s an <br/>
invitation to try something different in the morning. Sometimes it sits <br/>
there on the table way into the afternoon and then, all of a sudden, <br/>
they&#39;re ready to use the stuff. Sometimes, it&#39;s left completely <br/>
untouched. But it keeps me on my toes because they&#39;ll tell me what they <br/>
are really interested in doing. And if we&#39;re stuck, then it&#39;s time to <br/>
get out of the apt. and do something physical. For days, even weeks.<br/>

Plastic tub of magnets is one of our &quot;best sellers.&quot;  Then it gets put away <br/>
for a few months, but when it&#39;s first out, it draws everyone magnetically!!<br/>
<br/>
And then it gets boring after a few days.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620017212">I completely agree and have really only been learning that more <br/>
recently.  My 5yo ds is really pretty happy playing with anything <br/>
and on his own.  If I ask him if he wants to do something he usually <br/>
turns me down.  This could get pretty frustrating, for ME!  LAtely, <br/>
I just start building with the Legos and he joins in.  We got an art <br/>
table for Xmas so everything is more accessbile for him and his <br/>
brother.  I also leave our back doors open to the back yard and <br/>
patio so there is no boundary between the spaces.  They do not have <br/>
to ask to go out and I do not have to offer.  It is available at <br/>
their leisure.  The weather has been wonderful the last few months <br/>
here in south Florida so they have really been enjoying the <br/>
outside.  Also, if they are glued to the TV sometimes I will just <br/>
offer playdough or the park or something of the sort and they will <br/>
choose that.  Most kids will not choose TV in in spectrum of other <br/>
things.  My kids are usually attached to it when I am really busy <br/>
and they drift up from the playroom.  Sometimes, I just remember to <br/>
switch the TV off when they have left it.  I have learned to be <br/>
pretty free with TV time here.  I have found that sometimes they are <br/>
actively playing and then pass the TV which was left on and BOOM <br/>
they are absorbed by it.  If they want to turn it back on, that&#39;s <br/>
fine but at least that way it is a conscious choice.<br/>
