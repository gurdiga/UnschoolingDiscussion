<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029026173">At one time did someone send a URL for a book search.  I think you could<br/>
search for the best price on books.<br/>
I&#39;ve lost all my bookmarks, and of course now I would like to have it.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371180854">I like Bibliofind.com - I&#39;ve only used it for old books, but it may show <br/>
newer ones as well...<br/>
<br/>
I think Amazon does that, and ABE.com is another one. (These are off the top <br/>
of my head - if you need more, let me know and I&#39;ll look in my Fav. Places)<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
