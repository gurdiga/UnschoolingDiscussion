<div id="ygrps-yiv-261948209">Hello, all!<br/>
<br/>
Below is a post that appeared on another list I&#39;m on.  Thought some of<br/>
ya&#39;ll might be interested.  Personally, I&#39;m excited that the Christian<br/>
community is catching on to unschooling.  I say that, in light of how I&#39;ve<br/>
seen some homeschool, and how Christian unschoolers have been criticized by<br/>
the Christian homeschool community for so long.  <br/>
<br/>
Aaaaaanyhow, I have NOT checked it myself yet, and I know nothing about it.<br/>

Here is a great new website, devoted to homeschooling, unschooling and God.<br/>
(<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/8049">http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Pines/8049</a> ) The main page talks about<br/>
an<br/>
upcoming book on Christian Unschooling and also offers a monthly e-zine. At<br/>
the bottom of the main page are topical links to other pages. They include:<br/>
various homeschooling links, unschooling, state resources, special needs,<br/>
and<br/>
a page called &quot;my pile&quot;....with subject after subject of educational<br/>
links!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your time!!!!!!! I welcome any response!<br/>
