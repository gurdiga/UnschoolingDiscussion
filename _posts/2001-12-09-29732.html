<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195750366">I agree. I don&#39;t think there has to be consistency between the parents either.<br/>
My dh does, though. That&#39;s one of the ways we differ. I still think he&#39;s<br/>
pretty controlling, but he sure isn&#39;t by most standards.<br/>
<br/>
I figure I&#39;m not going to convince him all at once, and if I thought we had to<br/>
do everything the same it would be 100% his way which isn&#39;t going to happen.<br/>
;-) Besides that wouldn&#39;t allow for much learning on his part. This way, we<br/>
can both watch and see what does and doesn&#39;t work from two angles.<br/>

(although to be honest, he&#39;s 100% behind unschooling, it&#39;s just general<br/>
discipline I&#39;m talking about.)<br/>

&gt; 2 parents raise their children.  I am very unschoolish, but my husband<br/>
&gt; is not.  Thank goodness he&#39;s not nearly as controlling and conservative<br/>
&gt; as he used to be.  I credit myself.  He learns from my modeling just as<br/>
&gt; well as my boys do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK.  I&#39;ll just come right out and say it:  My boys know what they can<br/>
&gt; get away with when they are with me (almost anything!) and they know<br/>
&gt; that they can&#39;t do all those things when Papa is around.  They make the<br/>
&gt; adjustments very well and I don&#39;t particularly think it is harmful.  It<br/>
&gt; is just real life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I truly wish he had the same philosophy I have, but he doesn&#39;t.  We make<br/>
&gt; our compromises and we are happy.  The boys are very happy too.<br/>
&gt; Children are very smart, and they will adjust to different personalities<br/>
&gt; and parenting styles.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I refuse to give up my unschooling practices and my husband knows this.<br/>
&gt; I am happy to say he has made more changes than I have.  He&#39;s come more<br/>
&gt; to my side than I have come to his.  Actually, I have not moved in his<br/>
&gt; direction at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He has learned a lot.<br/>
