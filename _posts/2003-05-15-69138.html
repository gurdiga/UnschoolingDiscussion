<div id="ygrps-yiv-1628998117"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t want anyone to think it&#39;s because of the Indian in the<br/>
&gt; Cupboard discussion, because it&#39;s not, and I don&#39;t want anyone to<br/>
&gt; think I&#39;m mad because I&#39;m not.  And hopefully I didn&#39;t make too many<br/>
&gt; people mad at me.  I simply don&#39;t have a lot of time or energy right<br/>
&gt; now.  My husband is still on the road and he got held up in customs<br/>
&gt; in Canada for three days which means he won&#39;t be home as soon as I<br/>
&gt; expected, and the kids are way more needy than usual, and none of us<br/>
&gt; has been feeling well.  I just need to focus on getting the kids<br/>
&gt; through the next week or two without them beating each other up and<br/>
&gt; destroying our home, and I don&#39;t have as much time to get into<br/>
&gt; involved discussions right now.  I&#39;ll be back.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Looking forward to your return.<br/>
