<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494995185">I&#39;m looking for comments, experience, feedback, etc., on a kind of <br/>
unusual question.<br/>
<br/>
My best friend is a single working mother of an 8 yo boy.  Her son <br/>
was a preemie, and like all children, is developing at his own pace.  <br/>
He was held back for 1st grade last year & is now in second grade.  I <br/>
just received a call from his mother very, very upset about his <br/>
parent/teacher conference.<br/>
<br/>
The child is tutored in reading by the school (high school students) <br/>
and his mother spends literally hours with him at night on reading <br/>
the assigned material.  The school is telling her that her son is at <br/>
a beginning 1st grade reading level and they are planning on <br/>
administering a battery of tests including a physician&#39;s exam, <br/>
learning disability tests and a psychological evaluation.<br/>
<br/>
My friend is beside herself trying to deal with this and has, like in <br/>
the past, turned to me for some advice.  I&#39;m not sure anymore what to <br/>
say to her that could possibly help the situation; homeschooling is <br/>
not an option for them.  I am a firm believer in John Holt&#39;s advice <br/>
on learning to read on your own, when you are ready.  My hs&#39;d <br/>
children have learned how to read on their own, at their own pace, <br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in search of practical advice or websites to pass along to her.  <br/>
Her son used to excel in math but is now having trouble with the <br/>
simplest equations (6+2); he is very social, musically inclined and <br/>
has a terrific sense of humor.  In my eyes, he lacks very little for <br/>
an 8 yo boy and they are being extrememly pressured by the school to <br/>
make him a second grade reader or they are going to label him as a <br/>
learning disability.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d so much like to give her real, useful, practical and caring <br/>
advice and I hope that some of you can help out here.  It is breaking <br/>
my heart to see people I care so deeply about going through all of <br/>
the things that our family has had the good fortune to NOT experience.<br/>
<br/>
Thanking all of you in advance for any suggestions...<br/>
<br/>

March!!!)</div>

He sounds wonderful but, now don&#39;t bite my head off, does he have some sort <br/>
of disability?  Something that requires special ed of some sort?  He has a <br/>
tutor and his mom helping him a lot and he&#39;s not catching on -- so is there <br/>
some reason beyond just not being personally ready?  Maybe, maybe not.  It <br/>
sounds like they are looking for an ld, to me.  One may exist.  Or not.  <br/>
Betcha a dollar they find one -- whether it&#39;s there or not.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, even if the student is tested as ld, the parent still has to sign off <br/>
to have them included in the special ed class (or whatever service is <br/>
provided).  She can disagree with whatever their ultimate finding is.  Or she <br/>
can refuse to have her son tested in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, she will then probably be written off as &quot;diffficult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There has to be some sort of publication she can get from the school or <br/>
special ed dept at the the school baord which outlines her rights.  Or on <br/>
line.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in Florida, I might even have a copy of the one we got when my <br/>
son was tested.  (Different testing, same pages of legalese, I think.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is very likely. (as I am quickly becoming<br/>
cynical about the whole system and my kids have not<br/>
entered it nor I hope ever will). Anyway it is my<br/>
understanding that the school gets more money for kids<br/>
with learning disabilities.  The money may not be<br/>
spent for that child very wisely or for that child at<br/>
all. <br/>
<br/>
Definetly important to get informed what her rights<br/>
are as the parent. I would suggest she not let them<br/>
test him or do anything until she feels completely<br/>
informed.<br/>
<br/>
Even if one has their kids in school things can be<br/>
looked at differently if we think of the teachers as<br/>
resources rather than someone we need to &#39;obey. I<br/>
don&#39;t mean to disrespect the teacher or other<br/>
officials here I just mean to find a way as the parent<br/>
to have the teacher help you rather than someone you<br/>
have to fight.  I think its difficult because I don&#39;t<br/>
think teachers/officials are entitrely honest about<br/>
what they and the school are all about.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps...The words I want to pass on is<br/>
empower yourself.<br/>
