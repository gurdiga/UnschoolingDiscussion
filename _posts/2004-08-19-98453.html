<div id="ygrps-yiv-738805770">We made a bean box or you could use bird seed.  Ben loved his bean box.  We got bags of a variety of cheap dried beans.  I hid things inside and he loved to hunt for them, scoop them up or just sit in it.  Then, I made bean bags when he was done and we gave them out for Christmas gifts to his friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-63818501">WE have a big tub full of beans and rice that the kids play with.  Once we<br/>
play with the rice for a long, long time, we play with it a long, long time<br/>
again. LOL.  Seriously, eventually you start losing a lot of it because it<br/>
gets spilled on the floor then swept up and thrown away, or, in our case,<br/>
thrown around outside.  I think birds eat the old uncooked rice, and the<br/>
beans usually sprout. Flax seeds are great to play with, too.  They feel<br/>
very smooth and kind of slippery.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marjorie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  You can mix a few drops of food coloring with a little vinegar, put it<br/>
in a zip-lock baggie with your rice and mix.  Dump it out on a paper plate<br/>
and let dry.  It makes really pretty rice for art projects or for playing<br/>
with in a tub. <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not so sure about this.  Isn&#39;t it true that people throw bird seed at weddings instead of rice b/c uncooked rice isn&#39;t safe for birds?  It&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard in recent years but it might be some old husbands&#39; tale &lt;g&gt;; I don&#39;t have time to research it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605966546">I had my dad make us a rice box.  It was about 2 feet by 3 feet and about a<br/>
foot deep. It was made out of that white laminated wood that you see a lot<br/>
of shelves made out of.   It stood on legs so children could stand at it and<br/>
play in it comfortably.  When they tired of it we threw the rice in the<br/>
chicken pen for the hens to eat.  The rice table is now downstairs in the<br/>
basement waiting for my sister to take it home.  If you want a picture, I<br/>
could send you one.<br/>

My rice and bean tub is an under the bed storage box with cover.  We just<br/>
put it on the coffee table or other low table inside.  Outside we put it in<br/>
