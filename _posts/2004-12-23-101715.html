Hi. . . I have 3 kids ages 12, 10, and 9. Girl, boy, girl, is their <br/>
birthorder. I have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; for 3 years now and just started unschooling <br/>
about 4 months ago, (which I love and so do they, its simply wonderful). <br/>
<br/>
My problem lies not with my kids or myself but with my husband. To be frank <br/>
he is down right abusive, verbally, not physically. He hates me homeschooling. <br/>
I mean he loathes me homeschooling. If the kids dont answer his questions <br/>
right or if they do something silly by accident, he calls them &quot;homeschools&quot;. He <br/>
tells me and them that they wont make it later in life,  that they will be <br/>
flipping burgers and asking want fries with that? He says you just wait and see <br/>
they wont make anything of themselves and I am not going to support them the <br/>
rest of their lives!! I can only intervene so much, I am only one person. I need <br/>
two more people sheltering the kids from him. They have learned to ignore it <br/>
and to be honest they have lost all respect for him.  I know though that it <br/>
still hurts them to hear their dad think so poorly of them. It is affecting my <br/>
oldest daughters self esteem.  They wont do what he asks. Honestly they just <br/>
fllat out ignore him because they know it doesnt matter how they do the job, its <br/>
not going to be good enough and then he will just make fun of them. <br/>
<br/>
I have contemplated leaving him on several occasions but I am terrified that <br/>
if I did I would have a court order telling me I have to put them back in <br/>
school.  Its just not worth the risk to me, and I know my husband, he is very <br/>
vendictive and he would try and take them from me.  I dont want my kids going <br/>
through a battle like that. So I stay and fight, and fight, and fight.....its <br/>
becoming really difficult for me to continue. I have been battling him since we <br/>
first got married 11 years ago.  We married young because we had our first child <br/>
out of wedlock and I was determined to marry him no matter the consequences. <br/>
I was stuborn, controling and far to young to<br/>
 make such a big decision. I was 18 and he was 17, his mother had to sign <br/>
because he was not legal yet.   <br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  no matter the struggle I will fight him for my kids who  cant fight <br/>
him themselves. I just dont know how to handle the situation anymore. It is <br/>
getting worse, he doesnt hold his tongue at all anymore. I am at a loss. I want <br/>
to leave but I am terrified of loosing my kids. Since everything he does is <br/>
strickly verbal then there are no bruses, I cant prove it. I could video tape <br/>
him but it would have to be with his knowledge or the evidence would be <br/>
unuseable. If I ever did get permission to  videotape him, he would put on an act that <br/>
no judge would fight. I feel trapped and really need some help.  . . . .<br/>
<br/>
 Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing from you...</div>

&quot;homeschools&quot;.**<br/>
<br/>
Was he ever in favor of homeschooling?  How did this happen without his <br/>
agreement?<br/>
<br/>
I would really want to know whether this is the only &quot;issue&quot; that he is <br/>
abusive about, or whether he is abusive about many things, such as <br/>
housework, food choices, &quot;attitude&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Because distress about one issue might be resolvable, but if he is a <br/>
totally warped person, then calm discussion or counseling sessions <br/>
aren&#39;t likely to be enough to fix anything.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing that came to mind is that the father is spewing out a <br/>
lot of unhappiness.  Presumably he learned to feel terrible about <br/>
himself in school.  He may believe that he is an undeserving person <br/>
because of his own poor school performance.  (Wild guessing.)<br/>
<br/>
** I have contemplated leaving him on several occasions but I am <br/>

<br/>
&quot;Terrified&quot; is a pretty strong word.  Maybe a public school ISP would be <br/>
a workable compromise in a divorce situation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for me to understand how anyone who is very vindicitive can be <br/>
a positive role model for kids.<br/>
<br/>
My 4 cents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714613806">Let&#39;s assume that Irene&#39;s right, and her husband would seek to force her<br/>
kids to go to a public school.  Let&#39;s even assume that he would succeed in<br/>
that pursuit.<br/>
<br/>
 I don&#39;t know a great deal about divorce law, but it seems likely to me that<br/>
Irene will have little difficulty in putting together a case for custody.<br/>
In speaking with a lawyer, she might even discover a court that&#39;s friendly<br/>
to homeschoolers - not terribly likely, I realize, but also not impossible.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Too, if she can demonstrate that her kids are progressing with the<br/>
educational exuberance typical of unschoolers, she should have little<br/>
trouble convincing a judge to vacate any potential order requiring her kids<br/>
to attend school.<br/>
<br/>
So then, the question breaks down to a relatively simple one: will the kids<br/>
suffer more harm from being in an environment where one of their parents is<br/>
highly abusive of their learning, or from spending a short time in public<br/>
schools while the legal difficulties are ironed out?<br/>
<br/>
Some home- and un-schoolers I know spend a semester or two in public schools<br/>
just to gain the perspective of seeing what it&#39;s like - could Irene approach<br/>
it from that angle?  <br/>
<br/>
Another train of thought worth chasing down is whether or not this marriage<br/>
can be saved, and whether Irene&#39;s husband could perhaps be persuaded to be<br/>
more respectful of his children, never mind their educational choices.  Has<br/>
she tried to pursue marital counseling with him? <br/>
<br/>
Again, it&#39;s worth weighing whether the damage done by an abusive father is<br/>
outweighed by the damage done by the lack of a father in the picture.<br/>
Neither is a good situation, but one may be worse than the other.<br/>
<br/>
I certainly feel for Irene here - my wife and I were married at 19, and were<br/>
parents before we turned 20.  We&#39;ve had to work very hard at times on our<br/>
relationship, but it&#39;s been very well worthwhile, in the long run.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think that things ever got as bad for us as they have for Irene, but there<br/>
were certainly some pretty rough patches.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess my suggestions would break down to:<br/>
1. Irene should contact a marital counselor and see what ideas (s)he may<br/>
have for her for trying to salvage the relationship with her husband, or at<br/>
least get him to stop being abusive to the kids.<br/>
2. She should contact a divorce lawyer and get a clear read on the legal<br/>
potentials in her situation, and not just assume the doomsday scenario she&#39;s<br/>
laid out will inevitably come to pass.<br/>
<br/>
Too, I certainly wish her the very best as she tries to navigate this very<br/>
difficult challenge.  Unschooling can be tough enough to manage with the<br/>
authorities, friends and neighbors&#39; snarky comments, but I cannot imagine my<br/>
wife being able to do it with my kids if I weren&#39;t on board with it.<br/>
<br/>
Best of wishes, &quot;Irene.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Not knowing any more that what is posted here, I would offer a <br/>
couple of suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
1.  I suspect Dad might be suffering from depression.  Men usually <br/>
exhibit anger and general meaness when they are depressed.  I would <br/>
get him a complete physical, call his doctor on the sly, and beg the <br/>
doctor for some Welbutan (which would also help him quit smoking if <br/>
he smokes).  Just drug the problem.  (I do not generally support <br/>
drugging people, but this imo deserves some consideration.)<br/>
<br/>
2.  Mom and the kids need empowerment classes, if available in her <br/>
area.  Most domestic violence shelters offer these types of <br/>
workshops.  Many of them offer kids play time while mom is in group.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Mom and the kids might benefit from Co-dependecy workshops.  Is <br/>
Dad an alcoholic?  Was his Dad an alcoholic?   Maybe Al-Anon is <br/>
offered in her area?  Even if he is not an alcoholic, co-dependency <br/>
can still be an issue here.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s a simple idea.  Since it is currently the middle of the &quot;school <br/>
year&quot;, how about asking him to try refrain from saying anything bad <br/>
about homeschooling (in front of the kids) until the school year is up?  <br/>
You might have to agree to listen to his criticisms privately AND agree <br/>
that in June you will assess how well the children are doing and <br/>
open-mindedly reconsider whether homeschooling is &quot;working&quot; for your <br/>
family.   The idea is to get him to support you this year in exchange <br/>
for you involving him in the decision-making next year.  You get the <br/>
immediate benefit, and the repayment is pretty far off in the future.<br/>
<br/>
I think that IF you can get him to pretend to be supportive for the next <br/>
six months, the habit of criticism of homeschooling could be permanently <br/>
broken.<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  There is some interesting research in education that suggests that <br/>
students &quot;live down&quot; or &quot;live up&quot; to their teacher&#39;s expectations.  <br/>
Usually homeschooling parents are more impressed by their own kids that <br/>
teachers are, which is a plus.  (Kids can&#39;t always show off all of their <br/>
talents in school.)  A homeschooling dad who expects his own kids to be <br/>
stupid could be pretty harmful.</div>

<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
But in any case, I would try to move toward more cooperative than <br/>
resistent.  What doesn&#39;t bend will break, and a divorce on top of the <br/>
other problems does NOT sound productive for kids.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the idea of appealing to the doctor, making an appointment <br/>
(if the husband will go for that) for a checkup but with the doctor <br/>
knowing in advance the wife is concerned about depression.<br/>
<br/>
The reassuring ideas about counsellors and sympathetic courts sounds <br/>
like total fantasy to me.  The odds that a counsellor would support <br/>
homeschooling are miniscule.  The first thing most professionals <br/>
would say would be &quot;put the kids in school,&quot; because it has LONG been <br/>
assumed that having kids at home is stressful, and add to that the <br/>
new assumption that homeschooling is very hard work, and there&#39;s no <br/>
sense appealing to professionals.<br/>
<br/>
If the husband will agree to backing off, that&#39;s great.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the al-Anon suggestion, too.  If the mom or mom and kids <br/>
could get help from a 12 step program, then dad&#39;s anger and badness <br/>
will have a whole new perspective and less power, and maybe more <br/>
sympathy from the family.  You don&#39;t have to hang on to a dragon&#39;s <br/>
tail and let it fling you all over the place.  You can just see it <br/>
flailing but be unharmed.  It&#39;s possible to get to that place.<br/>
<br/>
When people call me for homeschooling information, I ask if they <br/>
have  hostile ex spouse, but a hostile CURRENT spouse is as great a <br/>
problem.  Unless both parents agree, homeschooling will be stress.  <br/>
Depending why the kids are out, it might or might not be worth them <br/>
going back to school so that the recalcitrant parent remembers or <br/>
realizes how bad school can be for them and appreciates the <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Both school and homeschooling will be there later.  Neither decision <br/>
is irreversible.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are now enough homeschoolers around that there are marriage, <br/>
family, child therapists who are very knowledgeable about homeschooling <br/>
and even unschooling - there are homeschooling/unschooling/attachment <br/>
parenting advocates who are now working as therapists. If anybody is in <br/>
Southern California and needs one, I can help out with a referral. <br/>
Other locations - I don&#39;t have information, but asking in local and <br/>
state homeschooling circles might turn up somebody. I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
surprised.<br/>
<br/>
Sympathetic courts are another matter - the usual procedure in custody <br/>
fights is to leave the children in their status quo - that&#39;s the <br/>
default, most often. I know that because one recommendation I&#39;ve heard <br/>
made by an attorney I know, who is a homeschooling parent, is that when <br/>
a divorce is happening, that it is a bad idea to TEMPORARILY put the <br/>
kids in school and then try to get a judge to allow them to return to <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
In California, people have had somewhat good luck with putting the kids <br/>
in a charter school independent study program at the first sign that <br/>
divorce could be a possibility. People have won the right to keep their <br/>
kids in those programs even when the other spouse is asking the judge <br/>
to order them into public school. There are charter programs that are <br/>
homeschooling programs - with varying degrees of reporting requirements <br/>
- and there are charters that even support unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who won the right to continue to homeschool her son - <br/>
it was a battle against her ex. It got to the point of going to court <br/>
(no out of court agreement, no mediators, etc.) and she presented a <br/>
&quot;case for homeschooling that particular child&quot; and she won --- she says <br/>
that one of the things that MOST impressed the judge was a handful of <br/>
photographs that she presented as evidence of his social interaction - <br/>
they were pictures of our homeschool group - and the one the judge <br/>
seemed surprised and impressed by was one of all the kids, all ages, <br/>
playing together at a Halloween party. She was very very glad she&#39;d <br/>
taken the photos, felt that made all the difference. And, in fact, the <br/>
judge said such nice things about how she&#39;d done such a good job <br/>
homeschooling him, that  the judge asked the ex if he wouldn&#39;t do <br/>
better by his son if he&#39;d help, not be a hindrance, in his education <br/>
and the ex agreed with the judge, that it would be better for his son. <br/>
A completely unexpected turn of events. She said her ex listened to the <br/>
evidence for homeschooling presented to the judge - even though he&#39;d <br/>
never even really listened to her before when she tried to talk to him <br/>
about it. It was like he was hearing it for the first time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-334124429">Obviously, this is not an alcohol/drug-related problem, or <br/>
else &quot;Irene&quot; would have surely mentioned it in her letter.  Sounds <br/>
like eleven years (or the last four) of frustration coming to a <br/>
head.  I can guess that Irene&#39;s DH was probably apprehensive and <br/>
fearful about going into unknown homeschooling territory with the <br/>
kids, and perhaps the specter of unschooling pushed him over the <br/>
edge.  The apparent lack of effective communication skills just <br/>
exacerbates the problem to the point of snide and sarcastic comments <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-133087054">Thank you for all the great suggestions it is really appreciated. I have tried counseling, which didn&#39;t work. At the time we were going to get a divorce and this was the last resort. 6 years ago, if I am not mistaken, we went to counseling to iron out some issues that had festered so long he and I both were resentful and would have killed each-other if we didn&#39;t do something. While we were in counseling the issue at hand was because I did not clean enough for him. It was a rather trivial reason to want to leave someone but I understood. He and I both came from an abusive family which would explain the early pregnancy. So with that said it is obvious why we found ourselves in counseling after 5 years of marriage. We left counseling with little to go on. I was told if I just cleaned more then he would be happier. I was incredibly mad and was totally against it at the time. It just seemed ridiculous that a cluttered house would upset someone to the point of cursing, yelling, and tossing<br/>
 things about. So for the next year I fought the suggested advice and eventually I couldn&#39;t take it anymore so I started cleaning. I got to a point that it was no longer worth the fight. To this day the house still is not clean enough. Now I am sure you all are wondering what do I mean by clean. How clean would the house have to be before he was satisfied? House beautiful, William Sonoma, and better homes and gardens are what comes to mind. Perfect homes with no dust, no clutter, nice furniture with no rips or stains, carpets so lush that you could sleep on them. These are all things that he values. These are all things that we do not have, nor could we really ever afford. The other issue is money. We never have any. Kinda funny really because who does. The bills are paid and we have food to eat and clothes to wear and that is good enough for me. He however wants thousands of dollars left over at the end of the month so he can go live a luxurious life style like the life styles of<br/>
 the rich and famous. These are all things that I have no interest in. I mean sure they would be nice, but thats not realistic. I suppose I should tell you that his father and grandmother on his moms side are both millionaires, so this is where he gets it. I could go on and on but I don&#39;t see how this will be of any good. As far as the kids go, we did put them back in school and when the teachers wouldn&#39;t let my daughter go to the bathroom and she defecated on herself, and the teacher of my son made him miss recess everyday because his work wasn&#39;t done, or because he missed to many, I had enough and took them out again swearing never to put them through it as long as I was alive. You see its not that I have not tried the things suggested its just that they haven&#39;t worked. I suppose the only thing that I have yet to do is go to a lawyer. Divorce is something that I was told I could never do. I would go to hell, God would reject me, and it is ingrained in my mind so deeply that it<br/>
 scared me. I have come to realize of course that I wont go to Hell and I can make a choice like that because I am a free person. I am still scared but believe I have no other choice. I must do what my gut has been telling me to do all these years. I know in my heart what needs to be done. Ive just been terrified of him taking my kids. But I guess talking to a lawyer cant hurt right.........This is the beginning of freedom and the start of a new stronger me....thanks again your suggestions put my life into perspective and helped me come to do what I knew I needed to do all along...<br/>

<br/>
I have very little sympathy for anyone who is abusive, but after reading your letter the one of many things that came to mind was about your husband and wife relationship.  I think it is important to be loving, mindful, and gentle to our children, but both of you need to be the same way to each other.  How can you get there?  It won&#39;t be easy, but maybe there is room for you to make some changes in how you care for him.  I think it is worth a try.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, I should add, that if he is very opposed to homeschooling, mending your own relationship probably won&#39;t help.  But then I wonder where was he when the decision was first made to homeschool? And if he did agree to it in the beginning, why has he changed his feelings on it?<br/>

<br/>
  Hi. . . I have 3 kids ages 12, 10, and 9. Girl, boy, girl, is their <br/>
  birthorder. I have been &quot;homeschooling&quot; for 3 years now and just started unschooling <br/>
  about 4 months ago, (which I love and so do they, its simply wonderful). <br/>
<br/>
  My problem lies not with my kids or myself but with my husband. To be frank <br/>
  he is down right abusive, verbally, not physically. He hates me homeschooling. <br/>
  I mean he loathes me homeschooling. If the kids dont answer his questions <br/>
  right or if they do something silly by accident, he calls them &quot;homeschools&quot;. He <br/>
  tells me and them that they wont make it later in life,  that they will be <br/>
  flipping burgers and asking want fries with that? He says you just wait and see <br/>
  they wont make anything of themselves and I am not going to support them the <br/>
  rest of their lives!! I can only intervene so much, I am only one person. I need <br/>
  two more people sheltering the kids from him. They have learned to ignore it <br/>
  and to be honest they have lost all respect for him.  I know though that it <br/>
  still hurts them to hear their dad think so poorly of them. It is affecting my <br/>
  oldest daughters self esteem.  They wont do what he asks. Honestly they just <br/>
  fllat out ignore him because they know it doesnt matter how they do the job, its <br/>
  not going to be good enough and then he will just make fun of them. <br/>
<br/>
  I have contemplated leaving him on several occasions but I am terrified that <br/>
  if I did I would have a court order telling me I have to put them back in <br/>
  school.  Its just not worth the risk to me, and I know my husband, he is very <br/>
  vendictive and he would try and take them from me.  I dont want my kids going <br/>
  through a battle like that. So I stay and fight, and fight, and fight.....its <br/>
  becoming really difficult for me to continue. I have been battling him since we <br/>
  first got married 11 years ago.  We married young because we had our first child <br/>
  out of wedlock and I was determined to marry him no matter the consequences. <br/>
  I was stuborn, controling and far to young to<br/>
  make such a big decision. I was 18 and he was 17, his mother had to sign <br/>
  because he was not legal yet.   <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway,  no matter the struggle I will fight him for my kids who  cant fight <br/>
  him themselves. I just dont know how to handle the situation anymore. It is <br/>
  getting worse, he doesnt hold his tongue at all anymore. I am at a loss. I want <br/>
  to leave but I am terrified of loosing my kids. Since everything he does is <br/>
  strickly verbal then there are no bruses, I cant prove it. I could video tape <br/>
  him but it would have to be with his knowledge or the evidence would be <br/>
  unuseable. If I ever did get permission to  videotape him, he would put on an act that <br/>
  no judge would fight. I feel trapped and really need some help.  . . . .<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you for reading this and I look forward to hearing from you...<br/>

&lt;&lt; Obviously, this is not an alcohol/drug-related problem, or <br/>
<br/>
else &quot;Irene&quot; would have surely mentioned it in her letter. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because something isn&#39;t mentioned doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a factor.<br/>
Some people who have lived with alcohol all their lives think every other <br/>
couple/family does as well.  They might think it&#39;s not worth mentioning.<br/>
<br/>
So it might not be a factor, but &quot;obviously&quot; is too strong a statement to <br/>
make.<br/>
<br/>
Dysfunctions that come from alcoholic families can be passed on in the <br/>
absence of alcohol, too.<br/>

not a whole lot you can do to change them, but alot you can do to <br/>
change how you react to them, how you feel about yourself, <br/>
etc....which i would think is very similar to how you might deal <br/>
with an addict. <br/>
<br/>
My father stopped drinking by the time i came along, but still was a <br/>
very narcissistic person. Its a little crazy-making, dealing with <br/>
someone like that, unless you realize that it has nothing to do with <br/>
you, and little you do will change him. I think giving kids in such <br/>
a family tools to deal with a father who is overly critical, or who <br/>
has negative personality traits, would be helpful. I think a group <br/>
like Al-Anon might be helpful in empowering them around their <br/>
father. <br/>

I feel trapped and really need some help. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has taken me a few days to respond to this because I wanted to think it<br/>
over, as well as see the other responses rather than be merely repetitive. <br/>
<br/>
I have snipped out the above quotes leaving out references to homeschooling<br/>
for a reason. The reason is that when I first read the plea my thought was<br/>
that it is not really homeschooling that is at the heart of this problem but<br/>
something else - the dreadful state of Irene and her husband&#39;s relationship.<br/>
Now Irene has posted a follow up telling us how counseling has been tried,<br/>
and of the apparently growing schism in life philosophies that has continued<br/>
to plague their marriage.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have been battling him since we first got married 11 years ago.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is certainly before any homeschooling began.   <br/>
<br/>
My first marriage when I was 20 was similar to this, except thankfully<br/>
without any kids. He was verbally abusive in a similarly put-down way, and I<br/>
felt very victimized, downtrodden and trapped at the time. We too fought<br/>
ostensibly about housekeeping and money, or its lack. Also he was a terrific<br/>
actor and able to charm people at least temporarily. Now, 20 years later, I<br/>
can see my part in exacerbating/enabling his negative qualities, and how my<br/>
controlling nature led me to stay in the relationship for a lot longer than<br/>
was either healthy or necessary. Trying to change or fix him was futile in<br/>
the end.<br/>
<br/>
I too had fears that he would vindictively seek revenge, although without<br/>
children to worry about, I&#39;m sure Irene&#39;s are much greater than mine were.<br/>
He did poison my dog at one point. Eventually I found a way to leave the<br/>
relationship, which was not the same way I would act to end such a situation<br/>
today. Today, or more accurately with my current self-knowledge, I would be<br/>
more direct, and act sooner.<br/>
<br/>
My fears about him were not entirely groundless, but certainly not realized<br/>
to the extent that I worried. I was able to scare him off when he came<br/>
around drunkenly with a buddy and threw rocks at my wall, with one call to<br/>
the police in the middle of the night, and he only broke into my new<br/>
apartment once when I was out, in order to leave a nasty note for me to<br/>
find. <br/>
<br/>
Someone else wrote about depression. My ex had a problem with some kind of<br/>
mental illness or emotional instability or whatever it would be called<br/>
clinically. He was a compulsive liar, and became a thief. I only realized<br/>
the extent of his problem after we split up, although the clues were always<br/>
there. For example he had spent a long time in psychiatric counseling as a<br/>
youngster (which I know many people do and get a lot of help from - it is<br/>
just part of the bigger picture). In his case I think it taught him how to<br/>
lie more effectively. His parents had a huge padlock on the door to their<br/>
bedroom, which they continued to lock whenever they left him alone in the<br/>
house, maintaining the custom they had from his childhood even when he was<br/>
grown.<br/>
<br/>
After our marriage ended, I attempted to continue with a business<br/>
relationship; that calmly civilized behavior lasted only a couple of months.<br/>
He had moved into a shared apartment. His roommates, and himself, were<br/>
having electronics &quot;stolen&quot; from the house. The lot turned up under his bed,<br/>
where he continued to express astonishment and denial. I happened to be<br/>
there when this occurred, and at one point he broke down and begged for<br/>
psychological help. His friends, from childhood, did try to help him at that<br/>
time, but when the actual time to go see someone came, he backed out<br/>
somehow. He had backed out from marriage counseling with me also.<br/>
<br/>
This was all more background than I intended to write. It is just that my<br/>
thoughts on this are inevitably colored by my horrible experience of living<br/>
with a verbal abuser. Like other kinds of abuse, it doesn&#39;t burst full blown<br/>
like Athena from Zeus&#39;s forehead. It takes a while to get the level of being<br/>
constant, and it takes a while for the recipient to be worn down to the<br/>
point of starting to believe that it is deserved or justifiable.  <br/>
<br/>
Irene talks of an eleven year long battle. Maybe her husband also feels<br/>
trapped, and has transferred his expressions of resentment from herself to<br/>
the children. Maybe Irene is a controlling personality, as I was, and makes<br/>
decisions without consensus, and has unwittingly created a situation where<br/>
the only outlet her dh feels he has is to criticize the children.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe, like my ex, he is an abusive asshole, with mental and emotional<br/>
problems that she will not be able to fix not matter how hard she and a<br/>
marriage counselor try.<br/>
<br/>
Most likely the real situation is much more complex than these simple<br/>
distillations.<br/>
<br/>
I do know that the children shouldn&#39;t have to live with and bear the burden<br/>
of a bad relationship between the parents. <br/>
<br/>
Pam suggested the reading about the legalities of the situation. There have<br/>
been suggestions ranging from visiting doctors to reading self-help books. I<br/>
think that getting more (and better) professional help may be a better<br/>
alternative than ending the marriage - provided the husband is willing, and<br/>
getting to the root of these surface issues (it ain&#39;t really cleaning) and<br/>
learning how to communicate needs without abusiveness are the goals. Does he<br/>
even realize that Irene is having these trapped feelings? OTOH is he wanting<br/>
out but doesn&#39;t know how to initiate it? <br/>
<br/>
However someone brought up the issue of whether it is better to live with a<br/>
critical father or not have one&#39;s father in the home. Is it really better to<br/>
live each day with someone who makes you feel lousy about yourself, whose<br/>
presence you must struggle to ignore, who is creating the likelihood of you<br/>
re-creating this abusive lifestyle for your future adult relationships? Is<br/>
it better for a mother to model living in fear, sticking out and enduring<br/>
abuse for her dd&#39;s? Is it better for ds to learn that this is how men treat<br/>
their wives? All this negative stuff gets absorbed no matter how much the<br/>
kids &quot;ignore&quot; what is being said to them. Neither Irene&#39;s nor her husband&#39;s<br/>
demons should be the children&#39;s responsibility to deal with.<br/>
<br/>
I stayed longer than I should have in my abusive marriage and it took me<br/>
years to restore my self esteem, and even longer to take responsibility for<br/>
my part in our disagreements (ie screaming arguments). I had learnt from my<br/>
own painful childhood that love feels like pain, loss, abandonment and<br/>
criticism. It took a lot of work as an adult to get to a place where I have<br/>
been able to welcome love that feels like kindness, generosity, fulfillment<br/>
and support. Jayn will not have to spend the years I did discovering what<br/>
real unconditional love feels like, or have to guess how two adults who love<br/>
each other behave towards each other, despite our various shortcomings.<br/>
<br/>
I truly hoped that this would turn out to be only about a disagreement<br/>
regarding homeschooling. I truly hope this turns out to be about a couple of<br/>
adults who need some help learning to communicate better. I don&#39;t usually<br/>
agree with Dr. Phil, but his idea that it takes 100 &quot;atta boys&quot; to<br/>
compensate for one nasty criticism, is useful to remember in terms of the<br/>
sense of urgency about seeking help or change, to make life better for the<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with it, Irene. Maybe seek some counseling or group therapy (as<br/>
others have noted) such as for adult survivors of child abuse, for yourself<br/>
no matter what happens with him.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just because something isn&#39;t mentioned doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>factor.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some people who have lived with alcohol all their lives think <br/>

 </span></blockquote>mentioning.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; So it might not be a factor, but &quot;obviously&quot; is too strong a <br/>
 </span></blockquote>statement to <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; make.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[PA] Thanks for pointing that out, Sandra -- I&#39;m glad for the <br/>
reminder about the importance of using this word very carefully.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Dysfunctions that come from alcoholic families can be passed on in <br/>
 </span></blockquote>the <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; absence of alcohol, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[PA] Yet, isn&#39;t this the mentality that we&#39;ve strived so hard to <br/>
overcome in unschooling -- that is, the labeling that so often <br/>
accompanies so-called &quot;dysfunctions&quot; of the times, liberally applied <br/>
to a given person or situation based on orthodox beliefs?  It&#39;s very <br/>
disheartening to me to see Irene reach out for help in the hopes of <br/>
finding a positive alternative to divorce, and end up with the <br/>
conclusion that it&#39;s basically over.  And this seemingly (but not <br/>
obviously) based on the common assumption that putting in any more <br/>
effort into reconciliation with all the unknown factors could just <br/>
end up being more of a waste of time than it already seems to have <br/>
been.  <br/>
<br/>
One round of counseling sessions with a &quot;professional&quot; who suggests <br/>
that cleaning house will solve all marital woes certainly leaves me <br/>
with a feeling of disgust (to put it mildly,) if not camaraderie in <br/>
the never-ending combat of clutter -- also a longstanding bone of <br/>
contention at our place (home of eight creative kids and a former <br/>
card-carrying member of Messies Anonymous -- no more labels for me!) <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, that reminds me of your article on the benefits of holding <br/>
on to your &quot;treasures.&quot;  If you&#39;ve got the link handy, please share <br/>
it again.  I&#39;ve let a lot of my oldies, but goodies, go in the <br/>
attempt to achieve that almighty standard of &quot;clean&quot; -- regrets, I <br/>
have a few, but then again, too few to mention...  In my experience, <br/>
there&#39;s definitely much more to it than meets the eye.<br/>
<br/>
I love Marshall Rosenberg&#39;s approach to people and life in general <br/>
in his practice of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) -- simply, that <br/>
all people have the same basic needs, just different strategies of <br/>
meeting them (from spending time on non-domestic activities while <br/>
the dishes remain undone to cluttering up the underside of our bed <br/>
with others&#39; possessions and/or engaging in self-denial about the <br/>
problem.)  One of the strongest needs to be met, in NVC theory, is <br/>
the need to give to others.  That makes all the difference in the <br/>
world when it comes to sharing our lives with others on the planet.<br/>
<br/>
With NVC, even the most &quot;dysfunctional&quot; personalities can come to <br/>
agreeable terms with no labeling, no blaming, no threats or lawsuits <br/>
necessary.  No sermon intended, but this is also in line with the <br/>
practice of Christian Science (CS), in which all people are held in <br/>
the same light and viewed with the same great potential for being a <br/>
positive force in the world.  There are no throwaways, no incurable <br/>
dis-eases, no hopelessly dysfunctional people, relationships, etc., <br/>
in this faith and I&#39;m living proof of that! (Always happy to <br/>
elaborate if anyone&#39;s interested, onlist or off.) <br/>
<br/>
Once the labels and assumptions are tossed aside, there are no more <br/>
limitations holding us back and the possibilities for improving our <br/>
life and wellbeing are endless.  I see the fear of continuing on <br/>
with a difficult situation, but have to agree with Sandra as one who <br/>
has came in to a broken home after-the-fact and lived the stepfamily <br/>
life while helping to raise my husband&#39;s and _our_ ex-wife&#39;s <br/>
firstborn for the past twenty years (and it doesn&#39;t end when they <br/>
come of age!) -- sympathetic courts and fair custodial arrangements <br/>
are a fantasy.  <br/>
<br/>
It all boils down to open communication and if that is a problem <br/>
during the marriage, it will more than likely go steadily downhill <br/>
once divorce papers are served!  If you think the kids are unhappy <br/>
now, wait till they have to split time between two homes, especially <br/>
if their relationship with their father is already strained to the <br/>
max.  Gotta be a better way, and I truly believe there is based on <br/>
what I&#39;ve heard of Irene&#39;s situation and our family&#39;s experience.<br/>
<br/>
Our oldest child had a decent, loving relationship with both parents <br/>
and step-parents, and still remembers his childhood as a tug-o-war <br/>
because of our essential lack of trust and communication with one <br/>
another.  His siblings watched what Marshall calls the &quot;jackal show&quot; <br/>
from the sidelines and tried to live their own lives around it and <br/>
despite our seemingly futile efforts to make it work.  It affected <br/>
everyone involved to one degree or another.<br/>
<br/>
Now that their brother&#39;s begun a family of his own and is already <br/>
struggling with separation issues, no one here has any doubts <br/>
whatsoever that we are all in sore need of something, if not more <br/>
effective communication skills, as the various &quot;dysfunctional&quot; <br/>
aspects of our relationships seem to have been passed down once & <br/>
again.  I can&#39;t help but wonder why the most &quot;functional&quot; parts went <br/>
by the wayside... there have been plenty of good times, after all.  <br/>
I&#39;m counting on CS and NVC to get us through this one intact!  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps put the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; label in a new perspective <br/>
and encourages others to think in more unlimited terms when advising <br/>
Irene on matters of the heart.  &#39;Tis a much happier way to celebrate <br/>
the New Year with a resolution to find a way to meet others&#39; needs <br/>
without compromising our own.  I hear it can be done, and would love <br/>
to know if anyone else thinks it&#39;s a real possibility, too.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the Faith, Hope, and most of all ~ Love,<br/>
Penne & Family<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; While we were in counseling the issue at hand was because I did not clean <br/>
enough for him. It was a rather trivial reason to want to leave someone but I <br/>
understood.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a whole reason.   <br/>
<br/>
And not all counsellors are the same.   You might find another one who has a <br/>
better suggestion than simply &quot;clean more.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But if that becomes a point of resistance, then could it be that you resist <br/>
cleaning because it would make him happy?  Because then you&#39;re not cleaning for <br/>
your kids either, and that&#39;s not good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We left counseling with little to go on. I was told if I just cleaned more <br/>
then he would be happier.-=-<br/>
<br/>
One thing won&#39;t make people happier, but half a dozen things might.  And when <br/>
people are happier they give back on the points they might&#39;ve been holding <br/>
out on too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So for the next year I fought the suggested advice and eventually I <br/>
couldn&#39;t take it anymore so I started cleaning. I got to a point that it was no <br/>
longer worth the fight. -=-<br/>
<br/>
So it does seem that non-cleaning was a tool of spite to some degree.<br/>
<br/>
Counsellors can give some bad advice.  In the 50&#39;s my mom told a marriage <br/>
counsellor that she hated the fact that my dad would light up a cigarette at the <br/>
dinner table before she had finished eating, and it made hesick and then she <br/>
couldn&#39;t finish her dinner.  He told her that it w<br/>
Zas easily solved:  she should start smoking herself.  Then they would have <br/>
something else in common, and the smell wouldn&#39;t bother her anymore.  So she <br/>
did and when she died (not young, 70&#39;s) that was one of the listed causes.<br/>
<br/>
But housecleaning isn&#39;t a lung-killing thing.  It might help for you to read <br/>
some of what&#39;s written about chores and attitudes toward them here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chores">http://sandradodd.com/chores</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-I suppose I should tell you that his father and grandmother on his moms <br/>
side are both millionaires, so this is where he gets it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
So he&#39;s maybe feeling like a relative failure for not having figured out a <br/>
way to be independently wealthy?  Understandable.   You&#39;ve probably tried, but <br/>
may he needs more positive strokes that are entirely NOT money-related.  Does <br/>
he have nice hair?  Does he smell good?  Is he good at fixing plumbing or at <br/>
shopping or fixing the car?  Are there compliments and thanks you could give him <br/>
that would make him feel appreciated?<br/>
<br/>
Inside every husband is the little boy who could&#39;ve used more mothering, and <br/>
if you give them some they can become better men even now.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I had enough and took them out again swearing never to put them through <br/>
it as long as I was alive.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not good to make promises you can&#39;t keep, not even to yourself.   <br/>
&quot;Over my dead body&quot; is only a way for someone to wish for your death, or for <br/>
YOU to hold your own life up as a plug in the dike.  It&#39;s not a healthy place <br/>
to be.  You put yourself in a position where even YOU have no choices.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an article on balance that might help.  Unless you create and continue <br/>
to work on a situation where you have choices you&#39;ve put yourself into a <br/>
helpless situation.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=-You see its not that I have not tried the things suggested its just that <br/>
they haven&#39;t worked. I suppose the only thing that I have yet to do is go to a <br/>
lawyer. -=-<br/>
<br/>
See?  I don&#39;t think you have done the suggested things from a position of <br/>
hope and determination.  (I could be wrong.)   One counsellor&#39;s suggestion was <br/>
rejected, and no other counsellors were sought.  That&#39;s not trying everything.   <br/>
And if the only thing you can see to do is go to a lawyer, you have no <br/>
choice.  <br/>
<br/>
Give yourself better choices.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Divorce is something that I was told I could never do. I would go to hell, <br/>
God would reject me, and it is ingrained in my mind so deeply that it<br/>
 scared me. I have come to realize of course that I wont go to Hell and I can <br/>
make a choice like that because I am a free person. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re making a choice for your children, too, though, and deciding you&#39;re <br/>
free to do exactly what you want instead of first thinking about what would be  <br/>
best for your kids isn&#39;t a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I am still scared but believe I have no other choice. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are other choices.<br/>
You need to change what you believe.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of people will easily say &quot;get a divorce,&quot; and they&#39;ll be there for you <br/>
for a week or two or six months, but they won&#39;t take care of you and hear your <br/>
problems for twenty years.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I must do what my gut has been telling me to do all these years. I know in <br/>
my heart what needs to be done. Ive just been terrified of him taking my <br/>
kids. But I guess talking to a lawyer cant hurt right-=-<br/>
<br/>
Talking to a lawyer could hurt because it costs money and it&#39;s an indicator <br/>
that you&#39;re giving up.  Those are possible harms.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is the beginning of freedom and the start of a new stronger me...-=-<br/>
<br/>
It could be the beginning of years of horrible custody cases, of being poorer <br/>
because the same money will have to pay for TWO homes, or you&#39;ll have to get <br/>
a job and can&#39;t be with your kids even when they are at your house.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s strength and freedom.  I think you should work on your <br/>
marriage and family SERIOUSLY hard before you give up.   <br/>

&lt;&lt; I do know that the children shouldn&#39;t have to live with and bear the burden<br/>
of a bad relationship between the parents. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t end with a divorce.  It can get much worse.  And then they can get <br/>
the addition of significant (to the parents only) others, or stepparents.  <br/>
And unless the parents really see the problems, the problems will continue in <br/>
other relationships as well.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I<br/>
think that getting more (and better) professional help may be a better<br/>
alternative than ending the marriage - provided the husband is willing, and<br/>
getting to the root of these surface issues (it ain&#39;t really cleaning) and<br/>
learning how to communicate needs without abusiveness are the goals.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree hugely with Robyn on this.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However someone brought up the issue of whether it is better to live with a<br/>
critical father or not have one&#39;s father in the home. Is it really better to<br/>
live each day with someone who makes you feel lousy about yourself, whose<br/>
presence you must struggle to ignore, who is creating the likelihood of you<br/>
re-creating this abusive lifestyle for your future adult relationships?-=-<br/>
<br/>
How about every weekday without the mother there to temper it or for you to <br/>
go to if you want to cry?<br/>
<br/>
How about just the weekends, where added to the regular criticism is <br/>
criticism of the mother and the other house/apartment?<br/>
<br/>
Divorce doesn&#39;t make the other disappear.    It removes some safeties that <br/>
marriages have.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Neither Irene&#39;s nor her husband&#39;s<br/>
demons should be the children&#39;s responsibility to deal with.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then they need to subdue the demons, not spread out so there&#39;s more air to <br/>
fan the flames.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Jayn will not have to spend the years I did discovering what<br/>
real unconditional love feels like, or have to guess how two adults who love<br/>
each other behave towards each other, despite our various shortcomings.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s because she is with two parents together.<br/>
<br/>
The situation with children won&#39;t be the same way.  Divorced childless <br/>
couples never have to interact EVER again if they don&#39;t want to.  MAYBE funerals of <br/>
mutual friends.  But parents have all kinds of child-related reasons to <br/>
interact.  And the kids are faced with either shared custody or the almost total <br/>
loss of a parent.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124477725">&quot;Irene&quot;,<br/>
<br/>
You -- and your children -- have a problem that goes well beyond the<br/>
issue of homeschooling. You describe this man as vindictive and<br/>
abusive. He insults and condemns his own children. Since you ask our<br/>
advice, I will give you this:<br/>
<br/>
You have to step back and take a look at the bigger picture.<br/>
Homeschooling is the least of your worries.<br/>
<br/>
1. YOU MUST SEEK PROFESSIONAL COUNSELING IMMEDIATELY. You are too<br/>
brainwashed by your tyrant husband to realize how bad and extreme your<br/>
situation really is. You need serious help to get a more realistic<br/>
view.<br/>
<br/>
2. YOU MUST GET YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM THIS SOUL-CRUSHING ABUSER.<br/>
Whatever it takes. Before he destroys them and any hope they have left<br/>
for an emotionally healthy future. They are 12, 10, and 9? And they<br/>
have spent all their years with someone who has it in his heart to<br/>
talk to children, his own children, like this? Get out while there is<br/>
anything left to salvage.<br/>
<br/>
If giving up homeschooling is what it takes for that to happen, then<br/>
do it. The price is well worth it. Homeschool vs. institutional<br/>
schooling, as valuable as it is, is a tiny issue compared to growing<br/>
up under the reign of an actively abusive parent. Your situation is<br/>
not normal.<br/>
<br/>
Some other posters have mentioned healing your relationship with your<br/>
husband. Your situation is well beyond that. Perhaps it&#39;s because you<br/>
have been with him all your adult life and even before, but you do not<br/>
seem to be aware that you deserve much better than this. You are<br/>
entitled to a much better life. And your children deserve much better.<br/>
<br/>
To sum up, I recommend you take your focus off homeschool and put it<br/>
on learning about abusive relationships and abuse survival. And start<br/>
planning your escape.<br/>
<br/>
Love and light, and best wishes, <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re only hearing your side, Irene. So I&#39;m going to guess that there <br/>
are two sides, too, to all of this and your husband would have a list <br/>
of complaints, as well. Marriage counseling with the intent to make <br/>
your marriage work is what I&#39;d recommend - for the sake of the <br/>
children. This means you don&#39;t go in already decided on divorce as the <br/>
only answer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; 2. YOU MUST GET YOUR CHILDREN AWAY FROM THIS SOUL-CRUSHING ABUSER.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could only do that by leaving the state and hiding. Otherwise, he <br/>
is their father and will get part or even full custody and they will <br/>
not only still be with him, they&#39;ll be with him without you there as a <br/>
buffer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Whatever it takes. Before he destroys them and any hope they have left<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Irene can leave - and leave her children with him - or she can fight in <br/>
court. The courts will not keep the children away from their own <br/>
father. I have a friend whose husband is a drug addict - he&#39;s had his <br/>
pharmacist license removed, he&#39;s been in court-ordered rehab multiple <br/>
times, the court KNOWS he is a drug addict - the court STILL gives him <br/>
half-custody, over and over. He moved away - so now she has a court <br/>
order to put her children on an airplane and send them to this man for <br/>
days and sometimes weeks at a time. Is that better? (Maybe it is for <br/>
the mom - but is it for the kids?)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Some other posters have mentioned healing your relationship with your<br/>
&gt; husband. Your situation is well beyond that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have no way of knowing that. She hasn&#39;t tried. She went to one <br/>
counselor who gave her odd advice about cleaning more - that&#39;s not much <br/>
of an attempt.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Perhaps it&#39;s because you<br/>
&gt; have been with him all your adult life and even before, but you do not<br/>
&gt; seem to be aware that you deserve much better than this. You are<br/>
&gt; entitled to a much better life. And your children deserve much better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes - the whole family deserves better. Irene - only YOU can make the <br/>
choice to divorce your husband, but YOU don&#39;t get the choice of whether <br/>
he sees or even takes the children, that will be up to a judge.<br/>
<br/>
You cannot get the children away from him through divorce. HE will <br/>
still be their father, and he&#39;ll get part or even full custody and <br/>
they&#39;ll be with him without you there.<br/>
<br/>
If he is abusing drugs or alcohol or beating the children or you - then <br/>
you may need to escape immediately. That might be a crisis. But in the <br/>
absence of an immediately crisis, it sounds like you&#39;ve truly done very <br/>
little to work on your family - avoiding divorce and the consequent <br/>
splitting up the children between yourself and your husband would be <br/>
very worth putting in a lot of effort and energy.<br/>
<br/>
And, Irene, if you&#39;re not able to find a way to live peacefully with <br/>
each other, perhaps you&#39;ll have achieved some improved level of <br/>
communication, at least, so that you&#39;ll have a wisp of a hope that you <br/>
can cooperate on raising the kids. Otherwise, you leaving him like this <br/>
is very likely to mean he&#39;ll fight you tooth and nail for custody - and <br/>
he&#39;ll at least partially win, if not completely. Yelling at kids, <br/>
criticizing them, being mean to them - none of those are going to be <br/>
held against him in court - they are standard normal parenting in this <br/>
culture. He&#39;d have to be physically abusing them a lot and you&#39;d have <br/>
to have physical evidence of that and STILL a court could send him to a <br/>
quickie anger management class and then give him access to the kids.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think anybody here can responsibly make this kind of <br/>
recommendation, not knowing Irene, having read one post from her.<br/>
<br/>
Irene - only you know everything about your situation - only you can <br/>
judge whether things will really be better if you go for a divorce. And <br/>
I think you&#39;re being realistic to consider that you can&#39;t keep him away <br/>
from the kids, even if YOU divorce him.<br/>

Sex life isn&#39;t everything.<br/>
The worst &quot;sex life&quot; advice I have ever, EVER heard is that breastfeeding is <br/>
wrong because breasts are for husbands to play with.<br/>
<br/>
Inside every woman is a little girl, and some of them like to think they&#39;re <br/>
being kept from communicating on discussion lists, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Too many women expect their husbands to be solid oaks of maturity and <br/>
understanding while they themselves throw various kinds of immature fits and blame <br/>
their periods or various biological factors, but never expect husbands to have <br/>
any emotional needs.  It&#39;s not fair or right.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851810160">Mothering is an act of nurturing -- as wives, we usually take care of many things that his mother used to take care of -- attention, cleaning, cooking, and so on.  Husband&#39;s are usually rather simple -- they like to be taken care of, not just physically, but also emotionally -- and most are more than willing to admit that.  I think that some wives just don&#39;t know that (I didn&#39;t until years into my marriage), or they just don&#39;t care.  It doesn&#39;t mean literally &quot;being their mother&quot; --  but men needs love and attention like their mother used to give them (or should have given them, if mom didn&#39;t).<br/>

How about going to yahoogroups and seeing whether your other posts are not <br/>
there.   <br/>
There hasn&#39;t been a message rejected since the 14th.<br/>
<br/>
If you think you sent something and it didn&#39;t show up, maybe it just didn&#39;t <br/>
go through from your end.<br/>

<br/>
I think a person who is blaming the other entirely hasn&#39;t yet tried to know <br/>
everything about the situation.   If one thinks divorce will get the person <br/>
away from the other parent, she doesn&#39;t know everything about her situation.<br/>
<br/>
Having a resource such as this list to help people gather ideas is wonderful, <br/>
but I think any suggestion to leave immediately is cruel and reckless.   <br/>

&lt;&lt; Some other posters have mentioned healing your relationship with your<br/>
<br/>
husband. Your situation is well beyond that. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not a known truth.<br/>
Her situation may be beyond that, or it might not be.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling IS a priority, then there are ways for the mom and children to <br/>
help themselves get to a better place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Perhaps it&#39;s because you<br/>
<br/>
have been with him all your adult life and even before, but you do not<br/>
<br/>
seem to be aware that you deserve much better than this. You are<br/>
<br/>
entitled to a much better life. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Entitled&quot;? <br/>
There is the possibility of a better life, but those who say &quot;GET OUT&quot; are <br/>
rarely in a position to provide that better life.  And murdering the ex spouse <br/>
only gets someone put in jail, so that&#39;s not a solution either.    Ex spouses <br/>
can be worse than irritating current spouses in very MANY situations.   Only <br/>
someone who has a better immediate spouse to provide and a nice house and such <br/>
should be making sweeping statements about &quot;much better.&quot;   And even if <br/>
miraculously there WERE all those things available, the mom and children could <br/>
probably use counselling or much self-examination to see how they can make <br/>
situations better with or without the dad.  <br/>
