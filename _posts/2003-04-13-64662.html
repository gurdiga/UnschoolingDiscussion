&lt;&lt; Just as I&#39;ve seen here if you don&#39;t want to read it, hit the delete key.  <br/>
I <br/>
don&#39;t care if some choose to hit delete every time they see my screen name in <br/>
an email. Won&#39;t bother me any. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But the archive will be filled up with stuff like this, you discussing your <br/>
own self and NOT discussing unschooling.  You discussing your angst and the <br/>
group and NOT discussing unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There are 1100 people here.  I know others are afraid or too intimidated to <br/>
ask something or to then follow it up with a WHY.  I&#39;ve gotten private emails <br/>
too. Doesn&#39;t bother me.  I am in charge or responding or not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The discourtesy of posting so much to all those people should be a <br/>
consideration for you.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am LEARNING, learning LOTS about unschooling and things that I can do <br/>
better. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not learning by writing before you know what you&#39;re writing about, <br/>
though, and nobody is learning anything from reading it except that you&#39;re <br/>
willing to use more than your share of resources.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It might be just my <br/>
learning style but if my child approached me about a subject I would tell <br/>
them go read and read some more, then listen but don&#39;t speak, then after you <br/>
are sure you know everything THEN I&#39;ll listen to what you have to say. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You WOULD?<br/>
Or you wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Proofread your posts better or you&#39;re REALLY wasting our time.<br/>
<br/>
And you&#39;re not a child.  You&#39;re an adult and can be expected to do your own <br/>
reading like an adult.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Use the delete key, I don&#39;t care, I really don&#39;t.  1100 people, some <br/>
questions are bound to be something someone else might want to <br/>
answer/hear/discuss.  If no one is interested, there you go...no discussion.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does &quot;read more&quot; mean NOTHING to you?<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t talk about unschooling, you have no reason to post so much.  <br/>
Please, please, stop.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I distinctly remember that there were MANY people posting about the group(s) <br/>
that threatening unschooling.  Not just me.  I responded to some that I <br/>
thought I would like to participate in the discussion with.  Not all my posts <br/>
are questions nor are anyone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we should just set a limit about how many times one can respond to any <br/>
given subject and how many questions one should ask per day per week or <br/>
month.<br/>
<br/>
When I subject is going down a path that someone might be questioning and I <br/>
can contribute I will.  If someone doesn&#39;t want to read it, then don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Like I said, I&#39;m sure I wasn&#39;t the only person who&#39;s eyes were opened to <br/>
threats being out there that are against unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I also commented about not knowing the &quot;church&quot;played such a part in <br/>
destroying others lives.  I said I know about abuse, I know it happens in <br/>
families who go to church (like mine) but it wasn&#39;t because the Church <br/>
dictated that my parents be like that.<br/>
<br/>
My thought was how maybe many abusive parents actually HIDE in a church <br/>
somehow hoping to in some sense make what they do to their kids OK.  After <br/>
all they ARE in church and isn&#39;t that the measure of a &quot;good&quot; person in the <br/>
eyes of the community.  Well, not always but on the surface, especially in <br/>
the South &quot;my but they were such a nice churchgoing family!&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Just to beg the question maybe it&#39;s really the people and not the &quot;cloak&quot; of <br/>
Christianity that they wear that is the root of the abuse.<br/>
<br/>
The question (and this is theoretical, I don&#39;t think anyone really has the <br/>
answer) is would these families that are so restrictive and abusive behave <br/>
any differently to their children if they did NOT attend church?<br/>
<br/>
I think they would be the same.  I&#39;m sure there are some instances where this <br/>
isn&#39;t true as in all things but something I wonder about...<br/>
