How does homeschooling work there.  My husband was raised in Scotland <br/>
and we have often talked of moving to Europe at some point.  Just <br/>
curious as to how popular it is there and what their guidelines <br/>
are??  Thanks if you have a chance to answer before you go.  Anyone <br/>
else know how it is handled in other countries??<br/>

military personnel from the U.S., and possibly other exceptions.  But<br/>
otherwise, it&#39;s illegal.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In the UK you just do it.<br/>
If your child has never attended school you don&#39;t have to notify anyone.<br/>
If your child is in a school you tell the Local Educatioin Authority and remove child from school. They are allowed by law to make *informal* enquiries. But thats all. Some of them get a bit<br/>
enthusiatsic however and need putting in their place.<br/>
Apparently HE is illegal in some other countries but they ignore expat foreigners so I know a few people who HE is Spain and Germany and France.<br/>
<br/>
I think the UK has the easiest laws anywhere.<br/>
