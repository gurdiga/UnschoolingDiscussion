It was coincidence, and when you said you had sent one, Liza, on  unschooling <br/>
I wrote and said &quot;Save mine, I&#39;ll write another instead because Liza already <br/>
did  unschooling,&quot; but I was told the articles seemed very complementary and <br/>
would make a good set.  And I think they do!  There are other things in the <br/>
issue which seem a part of the set.  <br/>

<br/>
I thought I said here. Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
When I fell and cut my elbow (a week before the HSC conference) that was the <br/>
only injury.<br/>
<br/>
Last Tuesday (the other day) I slipped on the stairs inside, carrying a box <br/>
of stuff, and slid down and folded my foot over in half.  Looked ugly.  <br/>
Turned colors after a couple of days, after the swelling went down.  I spent <br/>
three days on the couch, then scooted down the stairs on my butt (afraid of <br/>
crutch-walking on the same place where I fell) and spent the night in Holly&#39;s <br/>
room, in preparation for the long trek to my own shower (level floor) and <br/>
bedroom.  I made it back there yesterday, after having hurt myself Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
I can sit up a while now before it starts to hurt, and I can step on it a <br/>
little, which is how I can move around the house now.  Slowly and painfully, <br/>
with crutches.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll probably be crutch-free in three or four days.<br/>

Two falls within a few months may be an indication of<br/>
something else going on. Please ask your doc.<br/>
