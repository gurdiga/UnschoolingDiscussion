&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;It&#39;s technically &quot;antiseptic&quot; by one meaning of the word, but it&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not &quot;an<br/>
&gt; antiseptic&quot; by which people usually mean it will kill the germs on a <br/>
&gt; person, on<br/>
&gt; a wound or whatever.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You are right, it&#39;s not an antiseptic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But it is antiseptic.<br/>
&gt; I did a little googling, didn&#39;t find much, but from what I understand <br/>
&gt; salt does help kill off germs in the mouth, adds abrasive qualitys to <br/>
&gt; the baking soda, aids in whitening, and helps heal damaged gums and <br/>
&gt; other mouth sores.<br/>
<br/>

thing you do is to go to the beach. Salt water cures everything. The <br/>
salt + baking soda has something to do with the chemical reaction that <br/>
happens. I have to look in a cooking book but I seem to remember that <br/>
salt neutralizes the metallic taste of baking soda. Natrium Muriatricum <br/>
(salt) is used in homeopathy for allergies, eczema, asthma, contact <br/>
dermatitis, etc.<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Everything said not to apply salt directly to your mouth, to mix it <br/>
&gt; with baking soda or use a damp cloth to rub it gently ito your teeth <br/>
&gt; and gums<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A lot of it is due to taste issues (at first). The second issue that <br/>
does not become apparent at first is that you can wear off tooth enamel <br/>
in a short period of time with these abrasives.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why whitening toothpaste is evil.<br/>
<br/>
When I worked at Colgate-Palmolive, a lot of people would call about <br/>
sensitivity with those toothpastes. People would go to town believing <br/>
that indeed their teeth would look Vanna white when in fact it could <br/>
only remove enough build up to get them almost to their natural white <br/>
(not the unnatural bleached color that is so in vogue in Hollywood). So <br/>
we&#39;d send off many people saying, &quot;well, if you had read the box and <br/>
the instructions ...&quot; meanwhile knowing all too well that people do not <br/>
go by the box but by the commercials. Then we would get once in a while <br/>
the letter from a lawyer or a saavy customer with lots of dental <br/>
records to prove that, in effect, our tp had worn down their teeth. Its <br/>
another case of cosmeceuticals. Toothpastes are considered drugs by the <br/>
FDA. So that makes Colgate Palmolive and Procter and Gamble <br/>
pharmaceutical companies. But their business model is that of a <br/>
household and cosmetics company. So you have different interests within <br/>
the same company battling over how products are marketed and packaged. <br/>
It made for an interesting 4 years.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;If it were &quot;an antiseptic,&quot; then pouring salt into one&#39;s wounds <br/>
&gt; would be a<br/>
&gt; kindness and not a horrible torture (even if only a proverbial <br/>
&gt; torture).&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Jasons dad used to put salt in the bottom of his lower lip, he had <br/>
&gt; infected gums  and the salt helped, it cleaned the wound and he said <br/>
&gt; it got rid of the pain.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He got addicted to the salt though and couldn&#39;t stop, it ended up <br/>
&gt; eating away a bunch of his teeth and gums, but he said it didn&#39;t hurt. <br/>
&gt; :-/<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>UGH! WOW! That sounds gross. I can&#39;t imagine how much he must have <br/>
brushed for that to happen ?!?!?<br/>
