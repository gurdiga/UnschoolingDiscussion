<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393453723">I can&#39;t keep all the water.  Darn it.<br/>
Several times lately I&#39;ve been on Kirby&#39;s computer and when I wanted to save <br/>
something I couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
There were two pieces of mail here in which people said they had come to this <br/>
list (or to unschooling) because they&#39;d heard bad things about it (or me).  I <br/>
had wanted to read them more slowly and comment, but they&#39;re gone.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone was one of those people and remembers what day and subject, I can <br/>
go to the website and look or if it happens still to be in your outbox and you <br/>
remember to look, could you forward it to me on the side?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra</div>
