<div id="ygrps-yiv-608075740">&quot;There&#39;s the above reason, but there&#39;s also a sense of the continuity of<br/>
trusting a child to learn and providing a warm, supportive atmosphere that<br/>
doesn&#39;t stop just because children reach compulsory school age. So often<br/>
we&#39;ll say to new unschoolers or those thinking about it, &quot;how did your child<br/>
learn to walk, to talk, etc.&quot;. In that sense most of us do unschool our<br/>
children from birth--some just lose that sense of trust and give in to the<br/>
anxiety-producing rhetoric of experts.&quot;<br/>

I&#39;ve been thinking about your post and how it relates to my family&#39;s<br/>
evolution as unschoolers.  My daughter was in the public school system from<br/>
age 3.  She was &quot;labeled&quot; with a neurological disorder.  That label did help<br/>
me find information and learn why she experienced the world differently.<br/>
When you&#39;re in a situation like that you are so hungry for info.  I believed<br/>
the &quot;experts&quot; in the medical and school community.  I became the &quot;expert&quot;<br/>
for my daughter.  I fought school officials to make sure that she was well<br/>
cared for (and they complied, but it was always a fight).  2 years ago I<br/>
decided that I knew what was best, and that a radical change was needed<br/>
because she was so unhappy.  If I had known about homeschooling earlier, it<br/>
would have been a blessing.  She needed her family 24 hours a day.  She<br/>
needed to be close to us to help her.  She told me that in a variety of ways<br/>
and the answers I found were never enough.  She needed me, her mom, all day<br/>
long.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I homeschooled her (schooled her at home) and found that amazingly all her<br/>
coping problems and learning disabilities shrunk away.  After a year and a<br/>
half we discovered that she could learn at her own pace, on her own with<br/>
minimal support.  She had to be given permission, in a way, to think for<br/>
herself and believe in herself.  While we were doing a reading comprehension<br/>
exercise in the beginning days she said &quot;Mommy can I look around the room?&quot;<br/>
Of course, this is your house, what are you talking about?  &quot;Because I was<br/>
never allowed to look around at school.  They would get upset with me.  I<br/>
wasn&#39;t allowed.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Her brother was in Kindergarten and VERY bored with it.  He was a model<br/>
student, but told me it was KILLING him.  He could see me taking a radical<br/>
new approach with his sister, so he decided that school was not for him on<br/>
his own.  He was able to articulate why school was dampening his spirit -<br/>
for instance, he would say that if he wanted to stand and eat lunch, he<br/>
wasn&#39;t allowed to.  If he didn&#39;t want to eat, it didn&#39;t matter, he still had<br/>
to.  But he noticed that if you are sneaky and throw your unwanted lunch out<br/>
unnoticed, then you could play.  These things and many more bothered him.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Until I started unschooling, I knew NOONE who did it.  I was totally alone.<br/>
Trusting your gut is SO important.  Acting on your convictions is even MORE<br/>
important.  I&#39;m so glad that I am able to pass along what I&#39;ve recently<br/>
learned as an adult to my young children.  It is so heartwarming to hear of<br/>
others who can see situations clearly, through the rhetoric.  Children are<br/>
not small adults, pets or furniture.  They are treasures.  They belong at<br/>
home with their families, learning and laughing.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Danielle, you&#39;re right, unschooling does begin at birth.  And it can be<br/>
unschooled.  My family is proof.<br/>
