<div id="ygrps-yiv-216480825">My dh was telling me how he used to do war scenes during school art. <br/>
Pictures of soldiers with pools and pools of blood.  Says he doesn&#39;t<br/>
remember teacher making an issue of it; it was in the early 60&#39;s.  He is<br/>
one of the most gentle people I know.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;He used to draw these lovely pictures of houses. colour <br/>
 </span></blockquote>them in and then scribble all over them in red making it look as <br/>
though the house was burning down.<br/>
I am sure there is some psychologist out there some where who would <br/>
have a reason why he did this!!<br/>
My eldest is now in his 30&#39;s and has never burned down a house - well <br/>
not yet anyway!!</div>
