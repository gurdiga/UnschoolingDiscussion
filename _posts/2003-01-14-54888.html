&lt;&lt; &gt; And I just try to picture how beautiful that mess would be if one of my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children were gone. In the light of death, a mess can seem so trivial and <br/>
&gt; yet <br/>
&gt; wonderful! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that about laundry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would rather do laundry myself most of the time than to worry about who&#39;s <br/>
putting Marty&#39;s Nickelback shirt in the dryer (it would shrink too small for <br/>
him) or putting something favorite and black with towels to ruin it with <br/>
white lint forever.   Others do laundry sometimes, but I try to beat them to <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty has left some of his dirty socks balled up, I COULD yell and get <br/>
him in there to at least pull them out straight so I don&#39;t have to touch his <br/>
toe-grunge, but then I remember that I WANTED Marty, and planned him, and <br/>
have cleaned up his shit and puke (though not for many years), and that socks <br/>
are clean compared to that.  I have held him when he was feverish.<br/>
<br/>
And when I had broken my leg just five days before and it was time for us to <br/>
fly home from South Carolina to Albuquerque, and I was embarrassed and really <br/>
afraid that I would need the bathroom on the plane and not be able to manage <br/>
it, and I was afraid I would maybe cry when strangers were carrying me <br/>
strapped to a scary chair on steep, narrow stairways in and out of a Canadair <br/>
jet (too small for the tunnel jetway ramps), Marty was cheerful and <br/>
reassuring, and entirely attentive and distracting in a sweet way.   I never <br/>
had to &quot;tell&quot; him to do anything, and hardly had to ask.  When we were <br/>
waiting in Cincinatti airport, and he kept checking to see if I was <br/>
comfortable, whether I needed a drink, whether I wanted to move somewhere <br/>
else for a different view.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s his fourteenth birthday.  He&#39;s wonderful.  I will miss him when he&#39;s <br/>
grown and gone.  He&#39;s half of 28 now, and will be gone relatively soon.  I&#39;m <br/>
so glad I have photos, and little bit of video, and a lot of notes and <br/>
memories.<br/>

If you could go back and collect them all.....<br/>
