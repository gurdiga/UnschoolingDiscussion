<div id="ygrps-yiv-1583646439">Hello,<br/>
   I think a variety of educational approaches are nice to know about and<br/>
one can gain useful information from them,  but I don&#39;t like to impose any<br/>
particular method on my kids, but rather take ideas from different<br/>
approaches for reference and materials. Also, I think it is limiting when a<br/>
teacher, parent, etc. does all of the initiation.<br/>
I have even attempted to follow some formulas, but I would see what cool<br/>
things my kids would do without my input and interference. Months would go<br/>
by with no math instruction, and my daughter would know more math concepts<br/>
than before.The same goes for all subjects, and now I try not to even think<br/>
in terms of subjects.<br/>
At our house, asking nicely goes much further than demanding and following<br/>
with a threat-NOT that I don&#39;t catch myself doing that.<br/>
 No one has a specific job, if something is in my way, I will ask if they<br/>
would mind moving it, and sometimes they say, &quot;yes!&quot;. If they do say yes, I<br/>
move it myself-not usually a big deal anyway, and my alternative would be to<br/>
make a threat-&quot;move it or we are not going here, doing this, etc.&quot; The<br/>
&quot;you&#39;d better do it or else&quot; stuff seems comparable to &quot;this will go on your<br/>
permanent record!&quot; The threats start to seem meaningless . Kids begin to<br/>
think, &quot;so!&quot; and are then labeled rebellious.<br/>
My kids want to help me around the house, yard, etc more often than not<br/>
without demands. Sometimes they get such a thrill by having everything look<br/>
great, other times they could care less, so I pick up the slack. I never had<br/>
chores when I was little, but I still managed to catch on how to clean. As a<br/>
matter of fact, when I got to be 11 or 12, I really wanted to do laundry and<br/>
dishes, and it was then that I started fulfilling my great desires.<br/>

Absolutely. IMO the child needs to feel ownership of his education and where it leads him/her. To constantly be led to this or that and expect to drink it up sorta defeats the purpose of unschooling. (IMO of course.) While I think there&#39;s a role that the parent needs to fulfill in exposing the kids to various things, there&#39;s a fine line in exposure and insisting that the child respond in any way to that exposure. <br/>
