Yeah, me too.  I will call out &quot;Anyone have any black laundry?&quot; if a black <br/>
load is going in.  I make sure Holly&#39;s right &quot;uniform&quot; is ready for her <br/>
acting class and Kirby&#39;s gi is done in time for karate.  Maybe he does it, <br/>
but I make sure it&#39;s done one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sure,<br/>
you can&#39;t prevent them all but I would not stand by and<br/>
watch that bad thing happen for the sake of a lesson. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Me either.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a few times (not too many!) when Kirby would have overslept <br/>
and been late to work if I hadn&#39;t woken him up.   It would be horrible of me <br/>
to just look at the clock and let him sleep.  I wouldn&#39;t do that for ANYONE <br/>
even if was neutral about them, yet some people claim to do that for people <br/>
they&#39;re supposed to love, &quot;so they&#39;ll learn responsibility.&quot;   I think they <br/>
learn cold cruelty.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1698023844">My husband used to lay in bed until we would be late<br/>
for school.  I would literally have to put his shoes<br/>
and socks on for him to get him dressed so we could<br/>
get to class.   Finally one day I told him I was<br/>
leaving in 15 minutes  and he just laid there, Five<br/>
minutes later I warned him I was leaving  five minutes<br/>
after that I warned him one more time  and then I just<br/>
left when I said I would.   He missed school and work<br/>
that day and the next day he got up and got dressed<br/>
and got out to the car on time  and I never had a<br/>
problem after that..so sometimes a person just has to<br/>
give up and let the person take responsibility.   My<br/>
sons are the same way.  If I give an inch they take a<br/>
mile.  But one time of having to live with the<br/>
consequences  and they seem to learn whereas if there<br/>
are no consquences  if I always do everything for them<br/>
 then they just take advantage of that. <br/>

<br/>
Living with people who are always waiting to take advantage of you<br/>
doesn&#39;t sound very pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to read more about families who trust each other and aren&#39;t<br/>
worried about being taken advantage of, this is a good place. <br/>
