<div id="ygrps-yiv-32472557">Hi y&#39;all,<br/>
<br/>
I finally got a chance to write up an intro - it&#39;s been busy around here.<br/>
Two of my daughters were gone (one for a week and the other for two weeks)<br/>
and they both came home this weekend. So my family expanded from 5 to 7<br/>
overnight. I&#39;m still recovering. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m Patti - my husband and I have 5 children, ages 3 to 16,  at<br/>
home with us. I also have a son who is 26 and lives nearby. We&#39;ve been<br/>
homeschooling for about 12 years now. I&#39;ve been through a canned<br/>
curriculum, curriculum I compiled on my own, began doing Classical<br/>
Curriculum after reading Laura Berquist&#39;s book a couple of years ago.  The<br/>
3 older children (9, 13, 16) are enrolled in Westbridge Academy for gifted<br/>
and accelerated homeschoolers. Their curriculum is geared to the individual<br/>
student and is also classical. Currently, I&#39;m also writing the newsletter<br/>
for Westbridge.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the Atlanta area - out near Stone Mountain - with our newly<br/>
acquired wildlife..two guinea pigs. The girls are allergic to dog and cat<br/>
dander so these are the first pet we&#39;ve had in eons. <br/>
<br/>
Although I like the idea of classical curriculum (it looks great on paper)<br/>
we are having a hard time with the follow-through. I think we are more<br/>
unschoolers at heart than I like to think and it is like beating your head<br/>
against a brick wall sometimes. Dealing with structure is tough for us. I&#39;m<br/>
always looking for good ideas to get in the education we need but not beat<br/>
ourselves up because we burn out so easily.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has been encouraged by Oglethorpe University to start<br/>
joint enrollment this fall (she&#39;ll still be 16). They interviewed her after<br/>
she took her SAT sophomore year and got a 1270 (700 verbal, 570 math). They<br/>
actually wrote her a letter saying that they &quot;personally&quot; were inviting her<br/>
to come talk to them. Oglethorpe is very homeschool friendly and has given<br/>
top scholarships to homeschoolers the past few years. This is my daughter&#39;s<br/>
first choice in colleges anyway so we&#39;re quite happy.<br/>
<br/>
Working with the 13 year old is like pulling teeth sometimes. I don&#39;t know<br/>
if it&#39;s the age, but it is tough to get her motivated to do her school<br/>
work. This is a constant struggle. She dances 6 to 7 days a week and it&#39;s<br/>
just hard for her to make the transition from being in motion all the time<br/>
to sitting still for classwork, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s it for now. I have to herd the kids to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to being part of this group. I think listening to<br/>
unschoolers will help me a lot. I&#39;m very creative and I really think that&#39;s<br/>
half the battle of my problems with a structured curriculum. <br/>

I think that after reading the books on homeschooling and unschooling, the <br/>
above problem is one of the reasons I want to unschool.  If left to her own <br/>
devices, maybe your daughter will turn out to be the next Martha Graham!!!!!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860164496">Well Tuesday is my vaccing-up day &lt;g&gt;  as many folk know at <br/>
length...  And I&#39;ve finished that already, so now I&#39;m sitting here <br/>
emailing and napstering and trying to decide what to do next &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
Tomorrow we go swimming, Thursday I have a meeting, Friday is <br/>
whatever needs doing day.  I&#39;ve found that I have to have one day <br/>
a week when I can tidy the floor, at least, or it just gets nuts.  I <br/>
think the need to keep things &#39;regular&#39; is relative to the number of <br/>
people in the house, with other variables like personality and <br/>
children&#39;s ages thrown in, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-26827474">Bridget,<br/>
<br/>
We are now trying to put our house &quot;on schedule&quot;.  We are also trying to put <br/>
our finances &quot;on budget&quot;.  We have the tendency to have a messy house and to <br/>
overspend.  Don&#39;t know if they go hand in hand, but we&#39;ll soon see.  We have <br/>
been taking every free day on our weekends and picking one room to clean.  <br/>
So far, the kitchen, living room/dining room is done.  The basement is <br/>
almost there, we have some stuff we need to get rid of there.  We are going <br/>
to finish that this weekend and then we probably have a solid 3 days of <br/>
cleaning upstairs.  I guess you just have to get tired enough of it.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean by that.  We were in FL for a week staying with my <br/>
cousins and she is a working mom.  Her house is immaculate.  She is very <br/>
organized and yet I never noticed that she didn&#39;t have any time to relax, or <br/>
spend time with her son.  She inspired me, which is why the whirlwind tour <br/>
in our house now.  We came home to piles of stuff everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll let you know how we do.  I will probably start my cleaning schedule <br/>
within a week or two, but right now I am just making sure that I get <br/>
something done every day.  This morning I will be cleaning our powder room.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck to you and let me know how it goes.  Are you within driving <br/>
distance of Sesame Place?  We are only about 20 minutes away.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-123106665">hello bridget,<br/>
do you fancy having a email buddy system (if that is what it is<br/>
called)?<br/>
maybe we could go offlist and set ourselves little goals and see<br/>
how we go.<br/>
let me know what you think.<br/>
i managed to clear my wardrobe and took 3 large black sacks of<br/>
clothes I no longer wear to the charity shop. I also cleared the<br/>
bedroom floor and bedside cabinet. It feels so much better in the<br/>
bedroom now.<br/>
I know what you mean about moving rather than tackling the<br/>
problem.<br/>
I have a fantasy about winning the lottery and getting a new<br/>
house and just leaving this one as it is and coming back for<br/>
stuff if we need it! wouldn&#39;t want any potential buyers looking<br/>
at it! :o]<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If dealing with structure is tough... then change it.  Honest, there isn&#39;t<br/>
anyone going to come to your door and arrest you for being more free<br/>
flowing.  And you can still *do* the classical material, but in ways that<br/>
more fit your family.  And remember not every child has to be doing the same<br/>
kind of thing.  Out of 4 children I have one (only one!) very methodical<br/>
child.  She starts at the beginning and moves to the end, whatever that<br/>
means. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

work is usally busy/make work kind of stuff and we&#39;d rather be doing<br/>
something else. Add emerging adulthood to the mix and well.... you have<br/>
&quot;This is a constant struggle. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t sit still for classwork. Do it all while moving.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, by 13, I think it&#39;s important to put bookwork on the shelf for a<br/>
few years.  I&#39;d prefer to see my young teens working at real work (like her<br/>
dancing) and spending time contemplating growing up.  There isn&#39;t anything<br/>
in the middle school years that isn&#39;t presented again. Life science is just<br/>
cut down biology. You might as well wait until late teens/early college and<br/>
attack a meaty biology course  Is there anyone at the studio that could do<br/>
*physics in dance* with her? How about anatomy and other sciences related to<br/>
her body and it&#39;s work? Nutrition?<br/>
<br/>
We fight in our house about a few things, and mom fusses about a number of<br/>
other things, but academic work is very rarely one of those things. There&#39;s<br/>
just tooo much out there to learn and do and be to spend time fussing about<br/>
specific bookwork.<br/>
