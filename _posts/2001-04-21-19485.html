<div id="ygrps-yiv-252650415">Hiiiiiiiiii Bonnie :))<br/>
<br/>

ya&#39;ll so much!!! ... and *yes*, dh is a train engineer and, he&#39;s <br/>
great, too, thanks for asking :)<br/>
<br/>
since Sept, I&#39;ve had to *severely* limit my online time (just <br/>
reading/not posting) b/c we&#39;ve spent LOTS of time on the road <br/>
visiting our newest love, our 1st grandbaby (NO, I&#39;m NOT OLD, @ least <br/>
that&#39;s what I keep telling myself!!!  no haha&#39;s!) ... ohhhhhh, I <br/>
wished I could e-m pictures of Kinsey (7 mths old) but I can&#39;t since <br/>
the attachments have been disabled (which, btw, I think was *very* <br/>
necessary) ... soooooo, I guess ya&#39;ll will just have to trust me when <br/>
I say, she&#39;s just *GORGEOUS*, just like her sweet mama ... of course, <br/>
ya knew I&#39;d say that, right??? just a *glowing* Gramby and <br/>
ahhhhhhhhh, life is *GRAND* in south Tx :D<br/>
<br/>
*ack*, poor, poor Linda S. Davis, bless her heart ... I HOPE she&#39;s <br/>
able to get rid of that nasty worm and return soon???  poor thing &gt;:I<br/>
<br/>
leaping off for the moment ... <br/>
