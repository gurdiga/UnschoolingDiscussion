<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441568527"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;How long has Megan been unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is 15 now, we have been out of PS for 2 years, most of it unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Katrina has almost no internet experience, but she is beginning to show <br/>
&gt;some<br/>
&gt;interest.  One of the big results of being labeled in school was being<br/>
&gt;isolated and often scapegoated, so she has real anxiety about other kids.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had some trouble with the friends thing in the beginning. She did not <br/>
have alot of friends in school, not really good ones, anyway. When she quit <br/>
going to school they all pretty much dropped her and she was not interested <br/>
in meeting any hs kids her age for quite awhile. That did eventually change, <br/>
and she still has her best friend-a girl 6 years older, who she has known <br/>
all her life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I think it&#39;s possible that meeting others on the internet could really<br/>
&gt;help.  I will help her get her an internet address of her own in the next<br/>
&gt;week, and please, if Megan could write her that would be great.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Megan got on a teen list when she was new at it-those are some of the kids <br/>
she is camping with now. She also played a MUD with the kids from Holland <br/>
which made her alot of friends. She spent hours on the computer-sometimes <br/>
staying up all night. I know that the list they were on was called Home <br/>
Learning Teens-they may not be on it anymore, I think they got a bit tired <br/>
of it eventually. I&#39;m sure you can find a group for her-I think someone here <br/>
mentioned starting one.<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t get home til Saturday, but next week I will have her write to <br/>
Katrina-you can send me her new email addy privately if you like. I have had <br/>
her connect with other kids I found on the net. I found Adam, the boy who is <br/>
hosting the camp out, on a message board and he has become a wonderful <br/>
friend of out whole family. I eventually met his parents and he spent a week <br/>
with us last month.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, let her heal, think about what is really important for her to <br/>
learn instead of what she would be doing in school, and have some fun <br/>
together. You&#39;ll make it through this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1374047414">Cathie, it is really reassuring to hear about other kids who started after<br/>
years in the ps.<br/>
<br/>
I will send you the email address when she gets it.  Thanks for your help.<br/>
