&gt; Thanks for clarifying, that is exaclty what I was asking. I do think<br/>
&gt; excessive TV watching is quite harmful to children so yes, I would put it<br/>
&gt; in the &quot;danger&quot; category, along w/excessive partying and the like.<br/>

I&#39;m wondering...if you think TV watching is dangerous to children...do you<br/>
mean &#39;all TV viewing&#39;?  ALL children?  all ages?<br/>
    Wasn&#39;t it you who said TV is limited to weekends.  Well,  let me<br/>
respectfully disagree with you on setting this type of control.  I do not<br/>
advocate it.   In setting TV viewing apart from living...you give it a<br/>
specialness.  You risk sending some messages I imagine you do not intend to<br/>
send.  For instance,  perhaps a child will not engage in activities which<br/>
take place on the weekend,  because they&#39;d give up TV time.  Maybe they&#39;d be<br/>
less likely to do anything BUT watch TV,  except during allowable times.<br/>
    If you own a TV,  you must believe it has some value.  What about the<br/>
upcoming Olympics...no viewing their favorite sports because of the day of<br/>
the week.  What about a show that comes on a Tuesday regarding... your<br/>
child&#39;s favorite animal?  What about world changing news....let&#39;s think<br/>
positive here, :-),  perhaps a space mission,  peace treaty,  a friend<br/>
making the news.<br/>
    I understand issues of commercialism and materialism......my response to<br/>
that is,  provide videos with content you feel is appropraite. Young<br/>
children do not usually understand the concept of commercial interruptions<br/>
...my six yr old still asks if the show&#39;s over at commercial break...though<br/>
it would make no sense to end the story there.  Videos are available at most<br/>
libraries to expand your collection inexpensively.  When they are old enough<br/>
to wonder about commercial TV,  they are old enough to explore advertising<br/>
issues like *truth* in advertising,   the purpose of advertising.  It can be<br/>
quite valuable for a child to really want something from an<br/>
advertisement....get it,  and explore how different the reality is from the<br/>
idea promoted in the ad.  Boy,  that&#39;s something I want my children to pick<br/>
up on as soon as they are able.<br/>
    To try to summarize,  if you put a TV in the child&#39;s<br/>
playing/seeking/learning environment,   I think they ough to be given the<br/>
freedon to use it.  Do you only allow puzzle solving on Tuesdays and<br/>
Thursdays?  &lt;sarcasm on&gt; And,  goodness gracious,  we do want them to read<br/>
in moderation,  right?  I guess we better limit books to Mon-Wd-Fri,  in the<br/>
afternoon. &lt;sarcasm off&gt;<br/>
<br/>
    I say these things respectfully, with the hope you&#39;ll see it from<br/>
another perspective.<br/>

soon!</div>
