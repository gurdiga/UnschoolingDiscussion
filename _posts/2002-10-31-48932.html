<div id="ygrps-yiv-1651377881">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Adriane (11) has decided to no longer eat meat due to ethical considerations<br/>
(of course, she still sells her animals for slaughter.  Hhhmmm.  But she is<br/>
figuring out her morality and priorities and I want to support her.)<br/>
Anyway,  we live in the heart of cattle country and know no one who doesn&#39;t<br/>
eat meat.  I worry about her getting enough protein while we are still<br/>
learning about this kind of diet.<br/>
<br/>
I know several people on the list are vegetarian or their children are.<br/>
Would y&#39;all mind emailing me some recipes that your kids like?  For the past<br/>
week, Adriane appears to be living on a particular soy-based type of Ramen<br/>
noodles and pineapple, along with a smackeral of Halloween cookies.  She is<br/>
not averse to animal products, such as milk or eggs, that do not require the<br/>
death of the animal.<br/>
<br/>
Julie--who thanks you in advance</div>

 a couple of good books you might consider reading are &quot;Diet for a New America&quot; by John Robbins and &quot;The Mad Cowboy&quot;(I think it is) by John Lyman.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1037611090">Julie!!  I&#39;m so sorry!  I remember getting this message and thinking that I <br/>
would have to answer it and then, well, then, well.... who knows what <br/>
happened!  But what didn&#39;t happen is me answering your question!<br/>
<br/>
I do have a great book to recommend.  It&#39;s called &quot;Kids Can Cook: <br/>
Vegetarian Recipes&quot;  by Dorothy R. Bates.  There&#39;s a section for parents <br/>
called &quot;How you can be sure your child&#39;s vegetarian diet is nutritious,&quot; by <br/>
Suzanne Havala, M.S., R.D, F.A.D.A.  There are lots of great, basic recipes <br/>
that are vegetarian and can be veganized (no animal products whatsoever) <br/>
for kids who want to do that. The recipes are geared for kids to do the <br/>
cooking, but I like to use the book myself.  Here&#39;s a link to the book at <br/>
Amazon.  The ISBN is 1-57067-086-2, and it&#39;s published by the Book <br/>
Publishing Company.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570670862/qid=1036172080/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-1680947-0836858?v=glance">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1570670862/qid=1036172080/sr=1-2/ref=sr_1_2/002-1680947-0836858?v=glance</a> <br/>
(you&#39;ll probably have to paste this in since it&#39;ll probably wrap).<br/>
<br/>

&gt;I know several people on the list are vegetarian or their children <br/>
&gt;are.   Would y&#39;all mind emailing me some recipes that your kids like?  For <br/>
&gt;the past   week, Adriane appears to be living on a particular soy-based <br/>

information.  Good luck and congratulations to your daughter!  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75303224">Hello.<br/>
My family and I eat a lot of &quot;fake meat&quot;, which is soy or wheat based <br/>
but has a similar texture and flavor to different meats.  Morningstar <br/>
Farms makes a great line that should be available in the freezer <br/>
section of larger grocery stores.  You can just substitute these into <br/>
your favorite recipes, and they are high in protein.<br/>
My pediatrician also recommended that my children eat an egg a day, <br/>
which will supply plenty of protein and iron.  French toast is always <br/>
good for days when an egg just doesn&#39;t sound good.<br/>
Finally, toss some black beans in with many of your favorite dishes. <br/>
They go great in spaghetti sauce, with rice, or fried tofu.<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
-Natasha</div>
