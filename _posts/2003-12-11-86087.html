<div id="ygrps-yiv-42934958">I saw it and enjoyed it but here was my stupid moment of the week -- I was so <br/>
relieved to hear there was going to be a Part 2. I hadn&#39;t caught that -- <br/>
guess I missed the beginning, like so many shows -- and at the end of Part 1, I <br/>
wondered whaaa??-like if that was all and what it meant. I hope all will be <br/>
clarified next Sunday. At least some of it. :) <br/>

P.S. The best part imo was Roy Cohn&#39;s explanation of how he has sex with men <br/>
but is not a homosexual -- as sexual labels in DC politics and elsewhere are <br/>
about power -- with homosexuals of 1985 not having much of it. <br/>

Going off on a tangent here, but did anyone see Angels in America (part <br/>
1) on HBO on Sunday?  (Or previously on stage?)<br/>
<br/>
Very impressive and heartbreaking.<br/>
<br/>
Part 2 will be on this Sunday night, 8pm EST.<br/>
