<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s my take on this:  In the hypothetical situation you&#39;ve thrown out<br/>
&gt; here, If a kid grows to be used to hearing his mom talk to him sweetly and<br/>
&gt; with respect (but &quot;Honey, no&quot; is kind of weird, if you ask me) all the<br/>
&gt; time, and the day he or she runs out into the street and that mom shrieks<br/>
&gt; out in a most un-mom-like voice, &quot;NO!  GET BACK HERE!&quot; that kid&#39;s gonna<br/>
&gt; stop right in his/her tracks!  If only because that kid&#39;s gonna wonder<br/>
&gt; what&#39;s up with mom!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Could not agree more. In fact, this is exactly why I told all my dog<br/>
training students to talk to their dogs in calm, gentle voices in day to day<br/>
life -- in those emergency situations where they actually yelled at their<br/>
dogs, their dogs would stop in their tracks.<br/>
