<br/>
Yes.   Those are tear-jerker commercials for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Sylvan and such are expensive tutoring situations, and parents really <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have to pay money to get kids &quot;up&quot; in school, and they shouldn&#39;t be pressed <br/>
so much to live for &quot;reports.&quot;    Sylvan will report to the parents and the <br/>
kids will get better report cards at school.   Report, report, report--nothing <br/>
about understanding better or learning or liking the material more.   <br/>
<br/>
Luckily that doesn&#39;t apply to unschoolers!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27743472">And I&#39;m so overjoyed it doesn&#39;t apply to us.  I want to just tell <br/>
those people &quot;It doesn&#39;t have to be this way!&quot;  It&#39;s amazing how many <br/>
people don&#39;t know they have options where schooling is concerned.  <br/>
