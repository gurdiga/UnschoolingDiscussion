<br/>
&quot;Hi everyone,<br/>
   If you are against A4598, now is the time to act!!!<br/>
I&#39;ve been writing letters regarding this bill for<br/>
over a year now.  Today I took the time to call all of<br/>
the assemblymembers involved to say our family is<br/>
opposed.  The assemblymember assistants told me that<br/>
the majority of letters and calls they have received<br/>
are for those in favor of the bill.<br/>
   Take the time to read this and decide what is best<br/>
for your family.  If you are opposed, act now!  If<br/>
this bill passes, it will change the way we do things<br/>
as homeschoolers...and in way you may not support! &quot;<br/>

Subject: Opposing the proposed homeschooling bill--quickly!<br/>
<br/>
Well, now is the time to let our voices be heard in the NY State<br/>
Assembly, because the homeschooling bill has already passed in the<br/>
Senate<br/>
(S2060) and could come up for a vote any day now in the Assembly (as <br/>
#<br/>
A4598) because adjournment is scheduled for the 19th! So if we want <br/>
to<br/>
let our representatives know that we don&#39;t support this bill, we have<br/>
to<br/>
speak up immediately. (Basic contact information is listed below as<br/>
well<br/>
as in the latest newsletter.)<br/>
<br/>
( SNIP)  board has sent the letter printed below (similar to longer <br/>
ones<br/>
we&#39;ve sent in the past), but a letter from the group is no substitute<br/>
for<br/>
all of those quick individual calls and postal notes that can add up <br/>
to<br/>
let our representatives know that we&#39;re watching what is happening <br/>
and<br/>
we<br/>
are concerned.<br/>
<br/>
The problems that could be caused by this bill (if it passed) have <br/>
been<br/>
described in the past in the newsletter, on the loop, in issues of <br/>
Home<br/>
Free, and also on some statewide websites (like www.nyhen.org), but<br/>
there<br/>
are too many distinct points to describe all of them here.<br/>
<br/>
 Just off the top of my head, here are a few of the problems with the<br/>
proposed bill: though the bill appears at first glance to relieve us <br/>
of<br/>
many of the reporting requirements under the current regs, it is <br/>
badly<br/>
written, creates some new areas of confusion (which could lead to <br/>
messy<br/>
and dangerous legal challenges), and would put some undesirable <br/>
aspects<br/>
of the current regs into law for the first time, where the <br/>
legislature<br/>
can pretty much tinker with our rights at will. At least the current<br/>
regs<br/>
have remained stable for a very long time, which has so far protected<br/>
us,<br/>
for instance, from being swept up in the high-stakes testing craze <br/>
that<br/>
is wreaking such havoc in NY&#39;s public schools.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, most NY homeschoolers disagree with the pushing of this<br/>
bill<br/>
as the answer to our difficulties with the regs. There are a number <br/>
of<br/>
other approaches that various groups of homeschoolers feel could<br/>
produce<br/>
better and safer results; but a small group of homeschoolers, with <br/>
the<br/>
backing of (some say pressure from) HSLDA, has been pushing this bill<br/>
over the loud objections of their fellow New Yorkers. That alone <br/>
would<br/>
be<br/>
reason enough to slow down, stop this bill, and then try to reach <br/>
some<br/>
agreement across the state about how best to proceed.<br/>
<br/>
Even a quick phone call to register opposition could mean a lot. E-<br/>
mail<br/>
is said to be less effective, but a quick e-mail could be followed up<br/>
with a hard copy via the post. Contacting your own local<br/>
representatives<br/>
would be a good idea, but the two primary contacts in the Education<br/>
Committee,  are:<br/>
<br/>
(The Honorable) Steven Sanders (chair of the committee)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
( SNIP)  letter follows:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Assemblyman Sanders (or Assemblyman Weisenberg):<br/>
<br/>
On behalf of ( SNIP) ( HOMESCHOOL GROUP) , we are<br/>
writing to express our opposition to Senate Bill S2060/Assembly Bill<br/>
A4598, which provides for the imposition of certain procedures and<br/>
standards regarding home instruction.  ( SNIP) , founded in 1984, is <br/>
one of the largest and oldest independent support groups for <br/>
homeschooling<br/>
families in NYS.<br/>
<br/>
This flawed legislation would create more problems than it attempts <br/>
to<br/>
alleviate.<br/>
<br/>
On its surface, A4598 appears to lessen the reporting burden of<br/>
homeschoolers, as compared to the current regulations governing home<br/>
instruction found at NYCRR A7100.10; but its poor draftsmanship would<br/>
codify unclear mandates of questionable constitutionality.  As a<br/>
result, school districts and families would likely be forced to <br/>
expend<br/>
substantial resources to determine the new law&#39;s meaning and effects,<br/>
resources in time and expenditures that neither districts nor parents<br/>
have to spare.  While burdensome, the present regulations have been <br/>
in<br/>
place since 1988.  Local school districts and their resident families<br/>
have spent decades  establishing manageable practices under the <br/>
present<br/>
system.  This legislation undoes all that work without the certainty <br/>
of<br/>
improvement.<br/>
<br/>
There is no widespread support for this proposed legislation.  We <br/>
know<br/>
of over 35 independent local support groups for homeschooling <br/>
families<br/>
in NYS; yet, to our knowledge, only one of them has come out in <br/>
support<br/>
of this bill.  There is [in italics] widespread, statewide opposition<br/>
to<br/>
it.  We<br/>
have made repeated requests of Senator Kuhl, as the measure&#39;s <br/>
sponsor,<br/>
to open a dialogue regarding the advantages and drawbacks of<br/>
homeschooling legislation, but we are still waiting for an open<br/>
examination of this issue.  A more serious inquiry into the need, if<br/>
any, for legislation regarding home instruction, is warranted before<br/>
any such bill is brought to the floor of the legislature for<br/>
consideration.<br/>
<br/>
If you are eager to support families in pursuing educational<br/>
excellence, we urge you instead to end the imposition of high-stakes<br/>
testing on all children in NY.  Homeschooling families know first <br/>
hand<br/>
that a key component of high achievement is the freedom to determine<br/>
individually what constitutes a high quality education.  <br/>
Homeschooling<br/>
families care deeply about the fundamental freedom of all families to<br/>
choose an education for their children consistent with their <br/>
principles<br/>
and beliefs.  When a wide variety of learning and assessment methods<br/>
are accepted, then all children, including those who homeschool, will<br/>
benefit.<br/>
<br/>
We respectfully request that you oppose S2060/A4598. The inevitable<br/>
problems with this bill outweigh the difficulties that still exist <br/>
with<br/>
the present system of oversight of homeschoolers.  Thank you for your<br/>
consideration.  We look forward to learning your response.</div>
