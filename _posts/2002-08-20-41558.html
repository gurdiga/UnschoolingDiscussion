&lt;&lt; There are NO advantages to homeschoolers from taking these tests. All the<br/>
advantages (so called) are for the schools.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no advantage to the schools either, unless for them to say &quot;we need <br/>
smaller class size&quot; but they&#39;ve always said that, and for good reason.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;ALL INFORMATION THE GOVERNMENT GATHERS ABOUT<br/>
HOMESCHOOLERS WILL BE USED AGAINST HOMESCHOOLING. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is not true.  Scary for being in capital letters, but not valid.<br/>
<br/>
High test scores for homeschoolers can&#39;t be used against them.  Average test <br/>
scores for homeschoolers can&#39;t be used against them.  Low scores for <br/>
homeschoolers haven&#39;t ever happened (as those scores ARE reported in batches, <br/>
just as the scores for each school are reported in batches without being <br/>
broken out by individiuals except for the reports to the parents and for the <br/>
use of special ed teachers and placement within the school), so no telling <br/>
about that theoretical hypothetical.<br/>
