&gt;&lt;&lt; Just a hint, I&#39;ve learned from experience:  Breast-feed as long as you<br/>
&gt;  possibly can and seriously consider NOT vaccinating.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Also, be aware that while breast feeding your baby can be sensitive to what<br/>
&gt;*you* are eating. I had to give up all dairy, eggs, soy, seafood, and nuts<br/>
&gt;while I was nursing. (That was fun:-&gt;)After those things had been <br/>
&gt;eliminated<br/>
&gt;from *my* diet for a few weeks my dd was fine.<br/>
