<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910635595">I haven&#39;t posted much here lately, summer is a very busy time in our <br/>
family. But over the last few months, my son (just turned 7) went <br/>
from not-reading-much to being able to read most everything. I think <br/>
what finally tipped the cup for him was that he&#39;s spent a lot of the <br/>
summer trading and playing Pokemon cards with his friends. Most of <br/>
his older friends would read the cards to him, but sometimes he plays <br/>
with younger kids who can&#39;t. So he started figuring the stuff out on <br/>
his own. He has been gradually building reading skills over the last <br/>
few years, but it has just started to really come together for him. <br/>
He read me a 35 page book the other day, and I only had to help him <br/>
with a couple of words. No matter how many times you see the <br/>
unschooling model &quot;work&quot; in terms of a child picking up the skills to <br/>
do something new from their own interests and experiences, it&#39;s still <br/>
thrilling to watch!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share.<br/>

That&#39;s cool.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby and Marty couldn&#39;t read, they had friends who were kind enough to <br/>
just read to them (mostly during board games, I&#39;m thinking of, when there were <br/>
cards to be read on some turns) without razzing them, and so all my kids <br/>
turned that corner having been helped, and becoming patient and generous <br/>
readers-to-others.<br/>
