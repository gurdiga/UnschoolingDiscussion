<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844490797">Thanks Ned, for a post that was (mostly) about unschooling and (partly)<br/>
tactful.  <br/>
  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There&#39;s not much to unschooling, really. Until a kid is about seven, it&#39;s<br/>
 </span></blockquote>parenting, anyway, it&#39;s not even un-anything.<br/>
<br/>
I mean the following question seriously, and I&#39;m not being nasty.  But<br/>
what&#39;s so special about seven?  Why 7?  Why not 9 or 5 or 14?<br/>
<br/>
from a later post:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Mary, &quot;life is good,&quot; but it can be a whole lot better. We could be free.<br/>
&gt;Imagine that.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But Ned, we ARE free.  And your very next statement upheld that.  Your son<br/>
WAS free to educate himself.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;For all the years that my last son was educating himself in his own way at<br/>
&gt;home or wherever Luz and I went, I kept thinking what it would have been<br/>
&gt;like if we lived someplace where we were not permitted that freedom.  It<br/>
&gt;often made me cry.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And Mary, I love your tagline.  I need reminders (see Joyce&#39;s question about<br/>
changing subjects!).  Yours is a good reminder.<br/>
