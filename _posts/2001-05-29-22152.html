<div id="ygrps-yiv-149024931">I have to say that I think the salvation of public schools may be coming<br/>
(but slowly) in the form of charter schools. We live in a very &quot;alternative&quot;<br/>
community with many homeschoolers and many parents who want educational<br/>
options. I was just looking through the catalog of what is available through<br/>
our public school system and there are 20 options besides just your<br/>
traditional school classroom. They include:<br/>
<br/>
A democratic school<br/>
A Montessori school<br/>
A Waldorf-inspired school<br/>
An alternative &quot;unschooling&quot; school<br/>
A school that is a working farm<br/>
A drama school<br/>
A school that focuses on alternative transportation (they learn bicycle<br/>
creation skills and publish a statewide bicycling newspaper)<br/>
A military school<br/>
A one-room schoolhouse school<br/>
<br/>
These are all charters and publicly funded! There&#39;s also 10 or so others I<br/>
haven&#39;t<br/>
typed in.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, there&#39;s something here called &quot;HomeSource&quot;, also publicly<br/>
funded, for homeschoolers. Kids can sign up for whatever classes they want,<br/>
from algebra to foreign languages to horseback riding. They only attend what<br/>
they want to sign up for. So if there&#39;s ever a subject that we need more<br/>
outside input on, or that we can&#39;t do (like horses, obviously), we can use<br/>
this option too.<br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;s a lot of debate about whether or not to use publicly funded<br/>
homeschool support options like this. I&#39;m currently considering whether or<br/>
not to enroll my son in any of these classes when he becomes eligible this<br/>
year. On one hand, it does mean getting into &quot;the system&quot; by giving them<br/>
your name and identifying yourself as a homeschooler. OTOH, this area seems<br/>
to have a very good attitude about homeschooling, and none of my friends who<br/>
have enrolled have had any problems at all with it. The range of classes<br/>
looks really fun and I can attend with him and bring my other child with me<br/>
as well. I&#39;m thinking it would be fun to take Spanish together as that is<br/>
something we&#39;ve been trying (with limited success) to learn together at home<br/>
(per my son&#39;s wishes).<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here have any strong feelings about whether that&#39;s a good idea or<br/>
bad?<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;m really impressed with Oregon&#39;s charter school concept,<br/>
homeschooling support and the options available to us. It&#39;s nice to know<br/>
that they exist, even if we don&#39;t currently plan to avail ourselves of them!<br/>
Maybe a day is coming when all students and parents will have so many<br/>
different options available to them and the tired, sad system that is in<br/>
place now will go the way of the dinosaurs, heaving slowly out of sight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310466359">&lt;&lt;A Waldorf-inspired school&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My son went to a waldorf-inspired charter for a few months of K before I was<br/>
so horrified I pulled him. It was the worst of Waldorf combined with the<br/>
worst of PS. It was terrifying. They had children being &quot;punished&quot; in K by<br/>
having them run multiple mile-long laps at recess instead of being allowed<br/>
to play. My son was FOUR! They had more rules than I could dream ANY<br/>
kindergarten child could abide by.<br/>
<br/>
The result was that my son&#39;s passion for art disappeared when he was only<br/>
&quot;allowed&quot; to do his art at certain times, in certain places and in very<br/>
restricted ways. He was constantly getting in serious trouble, being sent to<br/>
the corner (I thought this punishment method went out years ago - I<br/>
certainly never encountered it in school), time-outs, running laps. Talk<br/>
about taking a child&#39;s love of physical exercise away from them! Oh, my<br/>
complaints are too long and drawn out to bother with. Suffice it to say you<br/>
can&#39;t truly teach in a waldorf way unless you are a waldorf fan. You can not<br/>
send your average PS teacher to a week-long Waldorf training session and<br/>
expect them to continue on the traditions of waldorf education. And,<br/>
ultimately, charters (here at least) are still PS entities - they still<br/>
require testing, grades, push competition, have bullies and bad teachers,<br/>
all the politics involved with any other PS and lots more on top of it.<br/>
<br/>
My son goes to a &quot;regular&quot; PS now with an &quot;alternative&quot; mutli-age program<br/>
instead of typical placements of first grade, second grade, etc. It is only<br/>
up through age 8. You move on to 3rd grade. You stay with the same teacher<br/>
for two years, same students as well. There is an emphasis on cooperation<br/>
and moving at your own pace and being the learner you want to be. I fell in<br/>
love with the multiage program at it&#39;s orientation but as I&#39;ve<br/>
demonstrated - it is just another PS. My son&#39;s teacher is moving on to<br/>
another school within the district so he would not even have the benefit of<br/>
2 years worth of the same teacher. Half the students move every year so even<br/>
that stability isn&#39;t really existent. As for the emphasis on cooperation and<br/>
moving at your own pace - there is TONS of competition, bragging, gloating<br/>
and emphasis on success and &quot;whose the best&quot;. The children still fall into<br/>
categories &quot;Younger&quot; and &quot;Older&quot; so what is the point of just calling them<br/>
those things instead of &quot;first grade&quot; or &quot;second grade&quot;. It&#39;s all just words<br/>
when they are not treated any differently. From my past intro you can see<br/>
that my son did not get treated as if he is in charge of his learning and he<br/>
was not allowed to learn how he is most comfortable at the level which he<br/>
prefers. It&#39;s all just talk.<br/>
<br/>
Charters are GREAT at telling parents what they want to hear. I have not yet<br/>
heard of a real charter in this area that is anything other than a typical<br/>
PS with all the same problems of other PS despite the &quot;alternative&quot; hopes. I<br/>
hate to be a downer, I am sure there are others with better experiences, but<br/>
I did want to share mine.<br/>

You would enjoy reading John Holt&#39;s _Teach Your Own_, definitely.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt used to think schools could be reformed, and he worked at it hard, <br/>
for years.  Then he came to believe that the failure wasn&#39;t in the method or <br/>
curriculum or the building or anything they had tried changing, but the <br/>
problems lay in the fact that the children were forced to be there, and in <br/>
artificial groups, and that no amount of changing what it looked like or <br/>
sounded like would remove the basic flaw.<br/>

I read it (and every other Holt book I could gobble up) five years ago. So<br/>
maybe I&#39;m just tainted going in &lt;grin&gt;. I absolutely belief the system<br/>
simply CAN NOT work. I believe it does not work because of it&#39;s very<br/>
nature - not just because of the curriculum, a few bad teachers, etc. I see<br/>
absolutely no difference in public, charter and private with the exception<br/>
being a nearby Waldorf private (big bucks) school where the children seem<br/>
genuinely to love being there and free to express themselves. But I bet it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be long, even there, before I had gripes about &quot;the system&quot;. I can<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-187177687">The bits of a thread about letting children choose their educational route<br/>
vs. choosing for them had me thinking. Dh and I talked about this a lot last<br/>
night and I&#39;d like to hear other&#39;s points of view.<br/>
<br/>
On the one hand, as an unschooler, I believe that children should have the<br/>
power to dictate their days. If they want to spend 10 hours doing math<br/>
worksheets that is their day, who am I to interfere. If they want to spend 6<br/>
months digging in the dirt I value that there must be something very<br/>
important (educationally) going on and butt out. When you take away a<br/>
child&#39;s power to learn what they want, when they want - you can easily take<br/>
away their love of learning. Resentment builds when you are told how to<br/>
learn, when to learn, what to learn. Soon learning is seen as a chore to be<br/>
done, at best, begrudgingly.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I am the parent. And although that doesn&#39;t mean, for me,<br/>
that I lord my power and control over my children I DO think there are<br/>
things I&#39;ve learned (the hard way) in life that I&#39;d like to spare my<br/>
children from. I don&#39;t subscribe to the mentality that &quot;every hard lesson in<br/>
life makes you stronger/wiser/better&quot;. I think there are plenty of hard<br/>
lessons I could have avoided and actually come out a much<br/>
stronger/wiser/better person for having avoided them. School is one of those<br/>
areas for me. I hated it and seriously searched for my own answer but did<br/>
not have any support. I learned the hard way about what was best for me, how<br/>
I learn best, what my own goals were. I could have avoided all of that had I<br/>
been &quot;allowed&quot; out of school at a much younger age. I am positive of this. I<br/>
spent ALL my spare time learning and school was simply something to resent<br/>
for taking away my learning time. I would have been much better served to<br/>
spend 12 hours a day doing what I love instead of 2 hours a day. But had you<br/>
asked me when I was 6,7.8 if I wanted to homeschool I&#39;m sure I would have<br/>
thought you crazy &lt;grin&gt;. The concept was as foreign to me then as it was<br/>
when I was 16 and wanted out of school. I was reluctant but that does not<br/>
mean it would have been the best decision for me. I feel like I needed a<br/>
parent to stand up for me and make those hard decisions for me. Sometimes,<br/>
even as adults, we can&#39;t see what would make us happiest and be in our best<br/>
interest because we are too close to the fire, so to speak. I had a hunch<br/>
but could not put the action to it to make it happen in the best way<br/>
possible. I feel the same for my child - that he has a hunch and an<br/>
inclination but does not have the maturity or the *something* - I don&#39;t know<br/>
what - to make a decision. He is a happy fence-sitter like me. He is happy<br/>
to do whatEVER he is thrown into (probably all those years or being thrown<br/>
back and forth). Yes, he says, he loves to stay home from school. Yes, he<br/>
says, he loves going to school. He is just a happy-go-lucky kid. There are<br/>
lots of underlying things that are going on with him to make him change that<br/>
don&#39;t (yet) affect his happiness.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is another factor. We are a family. What choice one person makes<br/>
has the ability to seriously impact the rest of us. Is it fair for Dalton to<br/>
decide he&#39;d prefer to go to school so he can play soccer every day for a<br/>
grand total of 1.5 hours - robbing the rest of us from 7 hours of his day?<br/>
Forcing the rest of us up much earlier than any of us feel comfortable,<br/>
interrupting naps and our day to go pick him up in the afternoon as well? Is<br/>
it fair that we have to miss out on LOTS of opportunities because Dalton has<br/>
chosen to go to public school? That we have to skip fun out of town trips,<br/>
going to museums and other longer adventures because it will run into the<br/>
time we must pick Dalton up from school?  Then it is fair that we all have<br/>
to listen to Dalton whine about how mean we are for having gone to some<br/>
great exploration without him? I honestly feel like I can&#39;t give my other<br/>
child/ren the opportunities they deserve because of this ONE child&#39;s<br/>
decision.<br/>
<br/>
Feedback appreciated...<br/>

I would be interested to hear what you may have to say about Laurel Springs School based in California. It is a private online school which also offers textbook curricula. It is a flexible program designed to the individual child&#39;s learning style and disposition. If at anytime we decide that a book or class is not working for the child, we can change it. Are you familiar with this school? It doesn&#39;t sound like most private schools, as most, from my experience, have been much less flexible. Could it be that some of the private schools are changing the way they educate our children?<br/>

<br/>
I loved school.  I look back now and see things I wish could have been <br/>
different, but much of it is my affect on others.  I wish I had been more <br/>
mature, more a champion of others (and I did often champion other kids, even <br/>
when I got in trouble for it).  But school was my door to the world, and to <br/>
adults with education and open ideas and who had travelled and who read, and <br/>
that was where I was exposed to music (besides C&W and rock&#39;n&#39;roll on a local <br/>
station that had two hours of rock per day, with Spanish rancheras almost all <br/>
the rest of the time).  <br/>
<br/>
I still have friends I made in school.  I still have things I made and wrote <br/>
in school.<br/>
<br/>
It was pointed out to me by a friend when I offered the suggestion that my <br/>
four year old firstborn, pre-school Kirby,  and her firstborn might like <br/>
school as much as I did.  She said she HATED school, and what were the odds?  <br/>
<br/>
The odds are... maybe one in 30 or 50 kids really likes school, I think, <br/>
looking back.<br/>
Maybe more.  Not many more.  NOwhere near half.  Nowhere near 1/3.<br/>
<br/>
Most hate it.  Some cry.  Some ditch.  Some kill themselves.<br/>

going to public school anytime soon, because you can&#39;t just pick and <br/>
choose to go one day and not go the next. Once you&#39;re enrolled, you <br/>
have to go every single darn day or &quot;get in trouble&quot;. Man, the hoops <br/>
they used to put me and my parents through because my folks took us <br/>
out of school to go traveling. Even though I learned *far more* on <br/>
these travels than I ever learned in school, I still had to do the <br/>
catch-up homework and lug all these books with me.<br/>
<br/>
But, I also think that when you start having options like we have <br/>
here, where homeschooled kids can take any classes they want and not <br/>
have compulsory daily attendance, that the school itself *is* <br/>
changing to meet people&#39;s needs. And if more people see that this is <br/>
available to them as homeschoolers, perhaps more people will feel <br/>
that they &quot;can do&quot; homeschooling (and yes, I know that we all know on <br/>
this list that you don&#39;t *need* all these bells and whistles to <br/>
homeschool, but the majority of people out there will feel more <br/>
comfortable doing it if they have resources available to them). <br/>
Perhaps then someday we&#39;ll have a system that offers education for <br/>
those who want it, when they want it. To a certain extent, I do <br/>
believe in the laws of economics (at least in our semi-capitalist <br/>
country, USA). If people take their kids from school, and use their <br/>
tax dollars to support an educational system in which kids have free <br/>
choice, then those choices will become more and more available. I&#39;m <br/>
still not sure if I myself will choose to do this (largely because of <br/>
the logistics of registering with the system to do so), but in <br/>
general I think it&#39;s a positive direction for schools to be heading.<br/>

Sandra, I am surprised you did not send your children to school. It always <br/>
seems like the people that loved school send their own kids, as they see in <br/>
only a positive light. What was the turning point in your life that lead you <br/>
to homeschooling and then unschooling? If I am not getting too personal. <br/>
<br/>
I can understand people who loved school sending their kids to school but I <br/>
have never understood the people who hated school defending it and then <br/>
sending their own kids! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-782199431">I agree with Robin and I think that homeschoolers (unschoolers not last nor <br/>
least) will change the way schools work, after some years of our flying next <br/>
to them (and around them) and showing that some of their truisms are not so <br/>
true.  They will want those kids back in the public education fold and if <br/>
they have to sing and dance to get them, good.  They should&#39;ve been singing <br/>
and dancing years ago.<br/>
<br/>
If schools make claims (if you can&#39;t read by eight you&#39;ll be a failure, etc., <br/>
etc.) which we ignore and say &quot;Ah--that turns out not to be so...&quot; pretty <br/>
soon their claims will sound sillier and sillier.<br/>

&lt;&lt; What was the turning point in your life that lead you <br/>
to homeschooling and then unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was a teacher!<br/>
And I went straight to unschooling, bypass school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
I had a luxury when I first homeschooled--Kirby&#39;s birthday is in late July.  <br/>
He could have been held back on parental request.  So I figured if at the end <br/>
of a year he hadn&#39;t learned what kindergartners should&#39;ve, or if he still <br/>
wasn&#39;t much more ready for formal groups stuff, I could put him in <br/>
kindergarten the following year.  And, I figured, if he went great guns and <br/>
WANTED school, and was all zippily prepared, I could say &quot;we homeschooled <br/>
kindergarten&quot; and I could put him directly into first grade.  So I had a big <br/>
field of calm about that first year.<br/>
<br/>
During that time, I got involved reading about homeschooling and <br/>
corresponding with homeschoolers, and there it was and here I am.<br/>
<br/>
I thought Marty would probably want to go to school.  We talked about it in a <br/>
positive light so if he wanted to go it would be easy for him to do so, and <br/>
he&#39;s a physical guy so I thought he&#39;d like the sports and PE and all.  I also <br/>
thought it would be a way for the two of them not to crowd one another in <br/>
life.  But when time came, Marty wanted to stay home.  Holly could have gone <br/>
to school, and used to say she wanted to.  When she explained WHY she wanted <br/>
to, though, it was very unrealistic.  She wanted to be in school with two of <br/>
the neighbors she always played with, but one was a year ahead of her and one <br/>
was two years ahead and went two blocks across the crowded thoroughfare <br/>
instead of eight blocks through the neighborhood to the &quot;real&quot; assigned <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
That was a cool period of time in our lives.  Holly spoke wistfully of it <br/>
this morning, about how many kids were in the old neighborhood.  None are <br/>
there now but one teen.  But for a while, there were five houses with kids <br/>
within an eight-house spread.  No two families went to the same school (two <br/>
different public schools, a Catholic parochial, a private protestant school, <br/>
and us homeschooling), so our kids weren&#39;t the odd ones out at all.  And we <br/>
had the coolest back yard, so they played together lots and lots.<br/>
<br/>
I went to college from 1970 to 1974 (not counting sporadic little bits <br/>
afterward--I&#39;m a three-time gradschool dropout &lt;g&gt;), and we were made to read <br/>
John Holt (against our wills!!  &lt;bwg&gt;) and other reformers and activists and <br/>
theorists.  I was a kind of radical teacher (a hippie who didn&#39;t use the <br/>
textbook).  I learned a lot getting to know kids who were NOT honors <br/>
students, who did NOT take band and art as first-choice electives.  I had <br/>
always hung out with the musicians, and figured the rest just weren&#39;t too <br/>
bright when I was a kid.  We were tracked, so I had the perspective of <br/>
hanging out with &quot;good kids&quot; (academically, anyway).  <br/>
<br/>
La Leche League friends persuaded me to consider homeschooling.<br/>

consider that they might have a choice? I was too much of a good girl to ever <br/>
question that there might be a better way. If there was a problem -- algebra, <br/>
biology -- I knew that I was the problem, not the class or the teacher or how <br/>
the material was presented. I wasn&#39;t working hard enough or I wasn&#39;t smart <br/>
enough or I was &quot;bad&quot; at math, hopeless at biology. Just never questioned <br/>
that the fault was with me. The trick then, became to hide those faults. <br/>
Every time I got an &quot;A&quot;, I knew I had succeeded in fooling someone. It wasn&#39;t <br/>
a measure of what I knew, but of what I had tricked them into thinking I <br/>
knew. There was no joy in learning, for me, as it sounds like there was for <br/>
you, Sandra. There was only fear, and relief if I could make it through <br/>
another hoop.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648029050">We thought for a long time we had to send our son to school and that we<br/>
could not live without my paycheck. Once we learned that homeschooling<br/>
was an option, and a way out of a horrible situation, we re-evaluated<br/>
the need of my paycheck. We learned that we were spending half of it on<br/>
tuition;  before and after school childcare; and other school and my<br/>
work related expenses.    We could desperately use the money right now,<br/>
but it is a matter of priorities for us. I would like to have the money.<br/>
It would make life a lot easier. We were afraid of the lifestyle. But we<br/>
have choices. It is either creature comforts or our son&#39;s welfare. Don&#39;t<br/>
misunderstand: we have a roof over our heads, a car, food in the pantry,<br/>
two computers, and money for utilities, so we are making it. We also<br/>
have a child who is much happier ; is beginning to enjoy learning ; is<br/>
learning on his terms and on his own timetable. We no longer go from one<br/>
crisis to another. We no longer have the constant power struggles with a<br/>
teacher and inept principal . We no longer have a child who is under<br/>
pressure to the extent of almost being clinically depressed. We can all<br/>
go to bed when it meets our needs, without being concerned about<br/>
homework, or tests. Our son can play on the computer as late as he<br/>
wants..He and my husband are night owls and like to stay up late.<br/>
Selfishly speaking, I am no longer in a stressful work environment ; am<br/>
getting time to rest when I need it ; and now have time to pursue some<br/>
of my own interests.<br/>
My assessment is that we are all much better off for having made the<br/>
change. When I doubt this, my husband reminds me of the positive changes<br/>
he has seen in all of us.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sigh. When Diana asked, I kind of hoped someone else would jump in to <br/>
summarize before I could reply. I&#39;m not sure how to explain how the show (PBS <br/>
Frontline: Killer at Thurston High) made me feel without sounding like I&#39;m <br/>
judging the parents or the school or the other adults in this kid&#39;s life. <br/>
<br/>
A few of things that made me cry: When he was four, his parents, high school <br/>
teachers, took a sabbatical in Spain and the kids were put in school there. <br/>
Kip couldn&#39;t speak Spanish, was bullied by the other kids, and hated it. His <br/>
older sister did quite well, as she seemed to do at everything.<br/>
<br/>
Back in the States, Kip had trouble learning to read and was &quot;held back&quot;, <br/>
despite what sounded like hours of after school reading &quot;help&quot; from his <br/>
parents (which was made to sound like a good thing, but made me cringe for <br/>
this little boy). <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m not sure anyone could summarize the reasons why this boy killed his <br/>
parents. It didn&#39;t seem to be rage as much as -- what? -- fear? Knowledge <br/>
that he wasn&#39;t &quot;measuring up&quot; again? Despair? Perhaps he felt like seeing <br/>
their disappointment in him again would just kill him. (He had just been <br/>
caught with a gun at school, and his Dad had picked him up at the police <br/>
station. They had just gotten home when Kip went up to his room and came down <br/>
with a gun and shot his father in the back of the head.)<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing is on the Frontline site. <br/>

I was hoping someone here had some words of wisdom, because I was left <br/>
feeling sad and confused by the whole thing. <br/>
