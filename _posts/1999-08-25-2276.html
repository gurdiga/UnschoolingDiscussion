<br/>
I feel that the more interesting thing is that it is just not true.  I feel<br/>
that I have benefited greatly by sharing my children&#39;s life.  I have gained<br/>
way more from being with them than I have given up.  It was very interesting<br/>
to me that when I decided to homeschool my attitude really changed toward my<br/>
children.  Before, I was on hold - when I put my kids in school I will do<br/>
this or that.  Once we started homeschooling I was no longer annoyed with<br/>
them for getting in my way.  (I hate to admit that - wisdom comes so slowly<br/>
to some of us).  I think attitude is what it is all about.  I love my life.<br/>
I no longer need &quot;time&quot; away from my kids - we each create some space for<br/>
ourselves depending on our needs.<br/>
I understand that the demands from young children are much greater and very<br/>
wearing.  However, it is just when they are emerging from this stage when<br/>
most people send them to school.  For those of us that find toddlerhood so<br/>
challenging those early school years are so much fun - if you let them be.<br/>

<br/>
I am new to the list, and my name is Rachael.  I am married to Shane, and we <br/>
homeschool together two boys and a puppy!  I liked what you said Jill, <br/>
because this is my experience too--  my husband and I are both in college, <br/>
and it is neat to see that our kids can learn to love learning as we have <br/>
learned to in college (we ahted it before then!).  Homeschooling the kids has <br/>
given me back my life, I think-- it allows us freedom to be who we are, do <br/>
what we want, and not be constricted (too much) by schedules and other <br/>
things.  Plus I get to homeschool myself along the way!<br/>
<br/>
Well, its nice to meet everyone,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364120116">I&#39;ve been lurking....things have been SO crazy here....but I just had to<br/>
ditto Jill&#39;s message.  People assume a big negative for me with HS is not<br/>
getting a break from the children.  I find I&#39;m worn out from the baby and<br/>
preschool age child....But I LOVE having my 7.5 year old around.  It&#39;s a joy<br/>
to have her be here and stay closely connected to her younger siblings<br/>
rather than being pulled into the &#39;world of school&#39;  while the little ones<br/>
are home.  And she and I have learned to give each other space and &#39;breaks.<br/>

In the midst of &quot;germ warfare&quot; and protecting the baby from &#39;residents&#39;<br/>
during her hospital stay -AAAAGH!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061402760">Jill,<br/>
You sure hit the nail on the head!!  When my kids were in public school, I<br/>
felt my life was spent driving here and there....chained to the &#39;school&#39;<br/>
schedule.<br/>
<br/>
As a family, we get so much done TOGETHER each day...it&#39;s great!!  Over this<br/>
summer, I have gotten us into a pattern of getting the kids up at 7 or so,<br/>
then the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. get dressed<br/>
2. have breakfast<br/>
3. clean up kitchen<br/>
4  do chores till 9am<br/>
5. do some &#39;school&#39;<br/>
<br/>
SInce we now get the house in order each morning, this has freed up a lot of<br/>
time for me.  I have been getting up with my dh at 5am...send him off to<br/>
work....watch a bit of news....then I exercise at 6:30am to about 7:15.   I<br/>
really need this time alone!!   Makes me prepared for the day with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
People ask me &#39;arent you sick of the kids?&#39;  Really, I am NOT.  It is like<br/>
you said, Jill, we all find our alone time.   I have also noticed the kids<br/>
get along so much better, too.  More team work, more cooperation.  Lots of<br/>
imaginative things happening.  Example...they have &#39;discovered&#39; all of our<br/>
old RECORDS and tapes....they are DANCING as we speak...making up patterns<br/>
and moves to dance too.  Guess this is our &#39;gym&#39; class!!<br/>
<br/>
I do not feel that I am sacrificing anything to be with my kids and to<br/>
homeschool them....I think this choice has made our lives so much better!!<br/>
<br/>
