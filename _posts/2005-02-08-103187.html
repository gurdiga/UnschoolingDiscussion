<div id="ygrps-yiv-774111988">I&#39;ll work on this tomorrow if I get a chance, to make it better.  But  come <br/>
to think of it, tomorrow&#39;s pretty solidly booked.  I&#39;ll poke around  Kirby&#39;s <br/>
computer for a photo editor or if someone knows a way to upload a disk  to an <br/>
online public photo site, I could try that.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>

 <br/>
P.S., that first photo is cool, and we would have had about 50% more lower,  <br/>
had that not been the last shot on that roll.  Darn!  Marty took it,  and <br/>
tried to get the clifftop in (and did), but then missed the length of hill  below <br/>
Cameron, and the little arroyo between him and that hill.  That was  taken <br/>
facing north from the trail into Echo Amphitheatre near Ghost Ranch, north  of <br/>
Abiquiu.  Cameron took his drum to play there, and is playing it in the  photo. <br/>
It sounded great, up near the amphitheatre itself.<br/>
 <br/>
I was looking for online photos of that site, since we ran out of film, but  <br/>
am afraid I&#39;ll lose this e-mail if I don&#39;t stop screwing around with too many  <br/>
windows open.  Sorry.<br/>

For those with a PC or Mac OSX it&#39;s easy to upload with a free download<br/>
program.<br/>
<br/>
For those with OS9 there&#39;s more clicking involved. You have to pick which<br/>
pictures to upload but you don&#39;t have to wait for each picture to upload to<br/>
choose the next. They all upload at once after you&#39;re done choosing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-238682221">Those are pretty much the big three parenting issues that unschoolers tell<br/>
beginners to let go of control of :-)<br/>
<br/>
I mentioned to Sandra and some others that sleep shouldn&#39;t be grouped in<br/>
with those two because sometimes people interpret let go of bedtime control<br/>
as let the kids figure out how to get to bed when they&#39;re tired and then the<br/>
kids end up staying up all night and sleeping all day.<br/>
<br/>
But now I&#39;m thinking that a similar misunderstanding happens with all three.<br/>
<br/>
With food sometimes free rein gets interpretted as supplying kids only with<br/>
what they&#39;re asking for, which, if it&#39;s been controlled, is generally &quot;junk&quot;<br/>
food.<br/>
<br/>
With TV sometimes free rein gets interpretted as sitting back and waiting<br/>
while the kids watch the now unlimited TV.<br/>
<br/>
The philosophical idea people would like to get across is becoming your<br/>
child&#39;s partner.<br/>
<br/>
But maybe part of the problem in trying to explain it is that parents who<br/>
control already think they are being, if not a partner, at least being<br/>
helpful. They&#39;re &quot;helping&quot; their kids make the right choice by preventing<br/>
them from making the wrong choices.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s much easier and more direct to say &quot;Stop controlling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is there a better way to get the concepts across?<br/>

than &quot;Stop&quot; anything. It seems to help both parents and kids from <br/>
going into the deer-in-the-headlights type shock and just freezing <br/>
up, not knowing what to do.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about &quot;doing with&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I remember Sandra said when I first asked questions about unschooling, to do everything <br/>
with my kids six hours a day. SIX HOURS a DAY!?<br/>
<br/>
I took her advice Very Seriously. :)<br/>
<br/>
And that meant that I was very in tune with my kids. They watched TV and I watched with <br/>
them, but then if I said, &quot;Hey, who wants to play cards?&quot; or &quot;bake cookies&quot; or &quot;go for a <br/>
walk,&quot; they were up for that too.<br/>
<br/>
When night came, I could see tired children and would be able to suggest sleep and slowly <br/>
move them to a sleepy routine. But I wasn&#39;t controlled by the clock any more. i was <br/>
controlled by my kids and my observations of them.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the misunderstood aspects of unschooling is the idea that kids are on their <br/>
own creating their own lives while the parent is... I don&#39;t know, in the other room?<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s this constant participation that helped me see how to let go of control because I <br/>
was with my kids and able to interact about everything in a loving, respectful way.<br/>

<br/>
For us, as our kids get older, sometimes it does mean that<br/>
I&#39;m in the other room :0)  The life we&#39;ve built though, brings<br/>
my children to me or to each other with their interests and <br/>
discoveries.  I have learned so much from my kids exploring their<br/>
own interests without me being right there. I am there for a lot<br/>
of things, but when I&#39;m not, it is fun to have them come to me<br/>
and have the experience of them genuinely caring to share what<br/>
they&#39;ve discovered.  I do like the &quot;doing with&quot; suggestion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198535739">I don&#39;t know exactly what the answer to your question is except to <br/>
say that maybe there is no way to neatly sum it all up.  &quot;Stop <br/>
controlling&quot; is difficult for someone to follow unless they know how <br/>
to set up personal boundaries, and can tell the difference between <br/>
honoring personal boundaries and selfishness.  But if you stress the <br/>
importance of personal boundaries, then people who resist doing <br/>
anything for anyone other than themselves are going to have a hard <br/>
time with that.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe a quiz set up for general unschooling advice. <br/>
Unschooling and tv<br/>
-Do your kids watch tv? <br/>
a. of course, as much as they want, and sometimes we watch it <br/>
together and discuss things we watch<br/>
b. Yeah, I hate tv because I worry that it will rot their minds but I <br/>
try not to say anything to them when they watch it. <br/>
c. They can watch it sometimes, but we consider it a privelage that <br/>
they have to earn, and we sometimes punish them by taking away their <br/>
tv viewing. <br/>
d. Oh no, do they need to be watching more tv?  Maybe I&#39;m not <br/>
exposing my kids to enough tv.  How many hours of tv should we be <br/>
watching a day in order to be good unschoolers?  Oh, I&#39;m so worried <br/>
now! <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve answered a, then read this advice about tv and <br/>
unschooling.  If you&#39;ve answered b, then read this advice about tv <br/>
and unschooling.  If you&#39;ve answered, c....etc.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-153746741">I start muttering on this topic about once a month, threaten to write <br/>
more and then never get far.<br/>
<br/>
So far I&#39;ve created a Word doc called &quot;More Than Nothing&quot; and have <br/>
pasted two old posts from UB in it and added one original thought!<br/>
<br/>
The two old posts from UB are <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/858">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/858</a> and <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/1008,">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingbasics/message/1008,</a> if you <br/>
want to take a look.<br/>
<br/>
My latest take on it is &quot;stop controling your kids and control <br/>
yourself.&quot; Meaning look for how much autonomy you have in choosing <br/>
what you do. See how enjoyable it is to choose to spend the day <br/>
connecting to your kids. Delight in choosing to find things to strew <br/>
that will spark their curiousity. If there&#39;s a repeated &quot;problem&quot; <br/>
with food or sleep, think about what help you can offer. <br/>
<br/>
We were having a little power struggle for a few days here: ds <br/>
started making lots of noise while dd was trying to go down for a <br/>
nap. I could not control what he was doing while she was nursing, so <br/>
I had no choice but to find a different way of dealing with it. In <br/>
the morning, I set aside some candy and a couple special art supplies <br/>
on a counter that the kids can&#39;t see. When dd started to go to sleep <br/>
I sent ds to climb up and found the suprises I&#39;d left for him. He was <br/>
so pleased! And then next day he happily turned the volume down on <br/>
the game he was playing and stopped yelling back at it. I wasn&#39;t <br/>
controling him, but my actions are what turned the situation around. <br/>
I didn&#39;t feel helpless that I couldn&#39;t control him, I felt powerful <br/>
that I could change my actions and that that led to a change in the <br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not recommending &quot;feeling powerful&quot; as a goal for unschooling <br/>
parents, just talking about taking a step away from controling kids <br/>
toward radical unschooling. I was not in a radical <br/>
unschooling/mindful parenting frame of mind when he was making noise, <br/>
I was in a tired, grumpy, thinking punishment was called for kind of <br/>
mood. So focusing on myself and my actions were the first step. After <br/>
that, I started thinking about our afternoons and how they&#39;ve changed <br/>
over the last month, what ds needs and wasn&#39;t getting, and we&#39;ve <br/>
talked about it together.<br/>

paper and I read books, but the vast portion of my entertainment and <br/>
informational needs are met by the news, excellent shows, <br/>
documentaries, movies.  I think I&#39;m pretty &quot;balanced&quot;.  I certainly <br/>
wouldn&#39;t deny my kids the TV experience.<br/>
<br/>
I really think that TV isn&#39;t the enemy and that kids do learn and <br/>
grow and are balanced even if they seem to watch TV ALL THE TIME.  I <br/>
say that you should order as many channels as you can afford to give <br/>
them as many options as you can!  We carry the full boat of channels <br/>
on cable here and it&#39;s like the one utility I would NEVER consider <br/>
cutting down on!  We&#39;ll start wearing sweaters before I cut down on <br/>
the movie channels.<br/>
<br/>
The computer is in our 9 yo dd&#39;s room right now and I JUST looked <br/>
over at her TV to see what she was watching...I know she WAS <br/>
watching Full House...now she is watching (unbeknownst to me till <br/>
this moment) a PBS Frontline documentary on Dubai. ???Where&#39;d that <br/>
come from?  She says it&#39;s interesting to learn about how they live <br/>
over there. I think that&#39;s a pretty cool unschooling moment right <br/>
there, one that probably wouldn&#39;t have happened if I restricted the <br/>
TV.  It&#39;s also pretty cool to hear her belly laugh over &quot;Raven&quot;, <br/>
which I&#39;ve never heard her do while reading a book!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1704629526">Okay I agree in finding the good in everything they do... but what do you do when they spend 10 hours on the computer?  My 15 yr old daughter could spend all a day and late night on the computer.  Talking to others and role playing for hours on end.  To the point that she doesn&#39;t move from that chair unless told to do something.  Now I will say that if we have something to do out of the house she will willingly go or if i ask her to do some kind of chore she does it but heads right back to the computer.  I really don&#39;t want to limit it but sometimes I just want to pull the plug so she will do anything else... The more I think about it she does do other things while on the computer... knit, watch documentaries, talk to the rest of us... anyway just need to hear all the reasons why letting her on there constantly is okay... I guess every once in awhile you just need someone else to say &quot;it&#39;s okay&quot;</div>

<br/>
Now, maybe six weeks later, he can go whole days without even turning the <br/>
computer on.<br/>
<br/>
This shows me something I thought I should point out to you.  I&#39;m just <br/>
holding a mirror up to what you wrote in a single paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
-=- she doesn&#39;t move from that chair unless told to do something.  . . .The <br/>
more I think about it she does do other things while on the computer... knit, <br/>
watch documentaries, talk to the rest of us... -=-<br/>
<br/>
All in one single paragraph, you realized you were wrong in your <br/>
characterization of your daughter&#39;s behavior.  That seems to indicate to me that you were <br/>
just parotting what others had said or what you were afraid others might say <br/>
when you first wrote, and by the end of the paragraph you were anticipating <br/>
what we might write or think, and switched to really looking at your daughter <br/>
directly.<br/>
<br/>
You could just look at your daughter directly ALL the time.  Let the initial <br/>
negative thoughts go by, maybe consider what internal voice you&#39;re hearing <br/>
(mom?  grandmother?  grumpy aunt?) and give that internal critic less access to <br/>
your immediate thoughts in the future.  Worry more about your daughter&#39;s <br/>
happiness and learning than you worry about what others will think about the clock <br/>
at your house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-anyway just need to hear all the reasons why letting her on there <br/>
constantly is okay...-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not on there constantly.  You said so yourself.<br/>
<br/>
But instead of this:<br/>
-=-she doesn&#39;t move from that chair unless told to do something. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe stop telling her to do something.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe start paying MORE attention to what she likes, what she&#39;s learning and <br/>
seeing and getting out of being online, and if something else has to be done, <br/>
YOU do it.  And bring her a drink and a snack where she is.<br/>
<br/>
She will NOT stay on forever.  And your relationship with her will improve.  <br/>
And your awareness of your daughter will improve.  And your worth as a partner <br/>
to her will be renewed if you stop being her judge and jury and the one who <br/>
makes her stop doing what she wants to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve never felt like her partner before.  Maybe you used to but have <br/>
moved away from it.  If she wants to do something, you could see it as your <br/>
job to help make sure she CAN do that.  If it&#39;s knit, you get her more yarn and <br/>
patterns, right?  If she wants to watch a documentary, you would look up the <br/>
time it&#39;s on, or rent it for her, right?  If she wants to be on the computer, <br/>
make sure the chair is comfortable, there&#39;s not a glare on the screen, and that <br/>
she is uninterrupted.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess every once in awhile you just need someone else to say &quot;it&#39;s <br/>
okay&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay!<br/>
It&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
But it will help your unschooling immeasurably if you come to know WHY it&#39;s <br/>
okay.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t let her stay on the computer because some unschoolers somewhere sent <br/>
e-mail saying it&#39;s okay.  You yourself look at it and think about it until you <br/>
KNOW it&#39;s okay, without anyone telling you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314989191">&quot; I need to deal with the whole &quot;really reluctant to go out&quot; <br/>
scenario with James.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I deal with the exact same thing.  Are you or your husband like that <br/>
too?  My kids, especially my middle child Matt, don&#39;t particularly <br/>
like to go out. <br/>
<br/>
Whenever I worry, I remember that my husband is exactly the same <br/>
way.  He doesn&#39;t enjoy vacations, he doesn&#39;t enjoy going out to eat <br/>
very often, he certainly doesn&#39;t enjoy museums or historical sites, <br/>
he doesn&#39;t enjoy crowds of people or meeting new people.  Last year <br/>
we didn&#39;t go anywhere on vacation and he was THRILLED.  I mentioned <br/>
to him that it would be nice to slowly put money aside for something <br/>
like Disney World, and he said that instead of spending money on a <br/>
trip he&#39;d rather spend money on making his home more like a vacation <br/>
resort.  His philosophy is that he has everything he needs right <br/>
here, so why should he want to leave.  My kids feel the same way.  <br/>
I do not.  I love my home, I love my family, we have lots of fun <br/>
together at home.  But sometimes I do my best to drag some of them <br/>
somewhere to get the heck out of the house sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I&#39;m usually okay with their homebodyness (is that a word? <br/>
lol) and chalk it up to personality differences and their highly <br/>
sensitive person-ness.  My son Matt doesn&#39;t even want to go trick or <br/>
treating next year because &quot;the candy smells like the person&#39;s house <br/>
that it came from&quot;.  But his own house smells just right I guess <br/>
(lol) and it&#39;s just the right temperature and has just the right <br/>
stuff and there is no discomfort here according to him.  I&#39;m <br/>
*usually* okay with it and only occasionally worry that it&#39;s a <br/>
social/emotional problem of some sort.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a gift to give a child - allowing them to do what they really want to be doing at that moment.  I would love to have 10 hours a day for even one week to spend on the computer.  There are so many things I would like to read, explore, and figure out with my computer.  All too soon she will have other responsibilities that will be important enough to her that she will spend less time on the computer.  Or she will find a way to earn money through computers, maybe!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really think it is okay. All three of my girls have gone through such <br/>
times - for months or years &lt;G&gt;. My 14 yo is into it right now. But <br/>
they do other things, are ready and willing to go out, they read, they <br/>
go to movies and watch tv. My oldest (20) talks on the phone to her <br/>
boyfriend who lives 2 hours away - but she doesn&#39;t spend much time on <br/>
the computer. She is now a full-time college student and very very busy <br/>
with school and work. My 17 yo spends a fair amount of time online, <br/>
probably several hours per day - she has friends all over the world - <br/>
she spends some time playing SIMS, but is out of the house a lot with <br/>
theater, music, and dance activities. My 14 yo plays soccer and does <br/>
karate and is in Girl Scouts - goes to movies with friends and plays <br/>
video games. They&#39;ve all had months and months where they spent lots of <br/>
time on the computer - 10 hours a day? Yes. Middle of the night - going <br/>
to bed at 1 or 2 in the morning or even later? Yes.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re fine.<br/>
