I was just saying today how much I loved being with my son, but that I was<br/>
going to need either some alone time to read a book or something or an adult<br/>
to talk to.  Adults tend to ask a lot fewer questions!  =)  My son and I<br/>
went to see Tarzan today, and on the way I got a run down of how Phil<br/>
Collins did all the music and how he came up with all the sounds.  Not to<br/>
mention all the way there and all the way back we were estimating how far we<br/>
were from &quot;our neighborhood&quot;, and why I had such a fit about ds standing up<br/>
in his seat as we went over the Buckman bridge.... ok, now I&#39;m babbling.  As<br/>
much as I need a break sometimes from his (and mine) non stop brain, I am<br/>
overjoyed with the fact that he is asking questions again, and actually<br/>
enjoying being a child... something that hasn&#39;t happened since the first<br/>
couple of weeks since kindergarten.  Anyway... that&#39;s where we were today =)<br/>

<br/>
I guess I was to, as my youngest was doing the question thing all day<br/>

everything is spinning shouldn&#39;t it be moving, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that newsletter thing went well. :)<br/>

discovered the fun of it, then she wanted to chat with me if my daughter<br/>
wasn&#39;t here!! as if I don&#39;t already have 4 kids to talk to already!!!  plus<br/>
the ones I babysit!<br/>

No, Lisa, you&#39;re NOT the only one who needs adult conversation!!!!1 I&#39;ve been <br/>
spending the week in the car--driving kids to 4H and dog practice and <br/>
Cloverbud day camp and karate and and and...  Actually I think that moms (and <br/>

today. There is a neat water park about 40 miles from me, right smack dab in<br/>
the middle of a cornfield.  It&#39;s wonderful. There is a &quot;pond&quot; that is about<br/>
3 acres in size. It&#39;s amazingly restful.  We&#39;ll stay all day and come home<br/>
tired.<br/>
<br/>
I just wish that someone would magically clean my house while I&#39;m gone. :)<br/>

We moved here in 95 so my daughter could train with a coach here in town and <br/>
I immediately started looking for unschoolers.  I was looking for a support <br/>
group, but no one knew of any....only homeschoolers.  Actually, I&#39;ve been on <br/>
the Unschoolers Circle list and the Radical Unschoolers list and they&#39;ve been <br/>
my &quot;group&quot;...nice to know there&#39;s someone else around here that thinks the <br/>
way I do about education!!!  There is one person from one of the lists (I&#39;ve <br/>
fogotten which one, though) that was moving here...haven&#39;t heard from her <br/>
lately so don&#39;t know if they&#39;re here or not.  If she is, that&#39;ll make 3 of <br/>
us!!!  Unless you know of others.......<br/>
<br/>
We live in the Baymeadows area...not *too* far from you.  The only kidlet I <br/>
have left at home is Valerie...14yo...a rhythmic gymnast who trains about 6 <br/>
hrs. a day, 6 days a week at the Riverside Y.  How old are your kid(s)?  How <br/>
did you get into unschooling?  Tell all!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318113246">My son is 6, we&#39;ve been back here for about 3 years now.  It&#39;s interesting<br/>
that with as many homeschoolers as there are in this area, that there aren&#39;t<br/>
many unschoolers.  This will be our first year homeschooling, after a very<br/>
bad kindergarten year.  I actually found out about homeschooling by trying<br/>
to find anti-homeschooling info for a case I&#39;m working on... and lo and<br/>
behold I started to really like the idea of child-led learning and the<br/>
entire unschooling theory.  As things got worse and worse for my son at<br/>
school I became more determined that this was the way to go.  Then to find<br/>
out I&#39;m all alone in this part of town!  =)  It&#39;s so nice to know there is<br/>
at least one other person out there.<br/>
