&gt;I subscribe to a post-it list which offers ideas, etc. This came<br/>
&gt;across and I<br/>
&gt;thought some of you here might be interested in it. Sarah<br/>
&gt;FREE FLIGHT FOR KIDS<br/>
&gt;If you have a child age 8-17, you can arrange for them to<br/>
&gt;have a free demonstration flight on a plane (usually small<br/>
&gt;personal prop planes). The Young Eagles Program is designed<br/>
&gt;to introduce young people to aviation. The pilot will<br/>
&gt;usually talk to the kids about the plane, aeronautical<br/>
&gt;charts/reference points, preflight inspections, instrument<br/>
&gt;panels, & the parts of the plane. While the flight is<br/>
&gt;usually a one day event, there are also summer programs<br/>
&gt;available at their headquarters. The flights can be found<br/>
&gt;all over the country. For more info on scheduling a flight<br/>
&gt;go to<br/>

&gt;or Email yeagles@e..., or call (920)426-4831. What a<br/>
&gt;great Christmas idea. POST IT...near your phone.<br/>

locations and hasn&#39;t heard back. Definitely don&#39;t wait until the last <br/>
