i agree that it&#39;s not ok to hit someone simply out of frustration. <br/>
but i am not sure about saying that it&#39;s NEVER ok to hit. if some kid <br/>
hits my daughter, i don&#39;t want her to run to me and point them out, i <br/>
want her to hit them back. maybe first give them the benefit of <br/>
yelling &#39;hey, don&#39;t hit me&#39; in case it was an accident and they might <br/>
make some gesture of apology.. <br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
There are better responses than yelling and hitting, whether it was an <br/>
accident or not.<br/>
<br/>
Our policy here when kids were little was first talk, then get a grownup to <br/>
help, and if that doesn&#39;t work *then* you can hit.  It never got to step three <br/>
(though Kirby had hope it would sometimes, I think).<br/>
<br/>
I agree that &quot;never hit&quot; would be a bad rule for someone to review in a case <br/>
in which an attack or abduction were taking place.   Being hit by another <br/>
little kid is not one of those cases.   And an apology or lack thereof isn&#39;t a <br/>
reason to decide whether to hit or not.  She could just get away from the kid who <br/>
hit her and let him calm down.  If the police stop someone for a road rage <br/>
moment, it won&#39;t matter if they say &quot;The other guy didn&#39;t apologize.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728376055">It is so hard to tell our children how to handle this stuff. Either way they can pay:<br/>
 <br/>
In VA, if a middle school student hits OR hits back, the school is mandated to call the police. A police report is filed with the childrens names on it. It is up to the discretion of the police officer whether to file a petition with the court or not. If the officer does file, the child(ren) are brought up on &quot;assault and battery&quot; charges. If the child(ren) are 14 yrs or older, they are charged as adults.<br/>
 <br/>
BTW, the &quot;assault&quot; does not have to be vicious. It can be a half hearted gesture to get a big mouth to stop his verbal abuse. Even if you have documentation that another student has been verbally attacking your child since the beginning of school, the child can be charged. Even if you have documentation that you&#39;ve reported it, the child can be charged.<br/>
 <br/>
This is the information given to me by a local In-take Officer. You haven&#39;t lived until you know what the term &quot;In-take Officer&quot; means. She showed me her case load. She is overwhelmed with B&A charges on minors. She&#39;s three months behind the petitions. This means your 12 yr old son can hit/hit back someone at school, and be asked to be accountable for it six months later. By then, the two kids in question are friends.<br/>
 <br/>
I asked her what happened to mediation. When we were in school, if two kids didn&#39;t get along, they had to spend the day together. We had to eat lunch together, clean the blackboard together, help each other with our seatwork. We were so sick of each other by the end of the day, we were willing to pledge sisterhood if need be. Now, the kids aren&#39;t allowed to talk it out. Nothing is ever resolved between the kids at all. But, the kids end up with a police record.<br/>
 <br/>
They can teach No Drugs, Sexuality, Good Touches and Bad Touches, Fire Safety in Your Home....but they aren&#39;t allowed to mediate disputes. I was angry at first, then I realized it was my fault. Ignorance of the law is no excuse. I had no idea this was mandated in my state, but it was my job to know. It&#39;s my fault because my kids had no business being taught in age-segregated classrooms with 35+ kids with one poor teacher. It&#39;s my fault because the minute they came home telling me about the weekly &quot;lock-downs&quot;, I knew better. It&#39;s my fault because the first time my boys came home speaking some sort of street-english, I was accountable. Especially when I spoke to the teachers at Open-House and it was their English the boys were learning to speak.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll quit now. I&#39;m getting off-topic. Sorry, I am really concerned about this. Take care, Mary<br/>

 <br/>
There are more options between hitting back and standing there and taking  <br/>
it.  Would you really just stand there and talk while someone is hitting  you?  <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you try to get away, at least?  If a man tried to  overpower you on <br/>
the street, and you saw someone nearby who could help, wouldn&#39;t  you call out <br/>
to them?  If you got away and he chased you, wouldn&#39;t you go  to the nearest <br/>
person who you thought could help?  <br/>
 <br/>
Wouldn&#39;t you go to your husband if he was nearby?  Sure, you&#39;ll say  your <br/>
husband will try to hit the guy.  But wouldn&#39;t it be better if he  called the <br/>
police instead, and then there was justice so it didn&#39;t happen to  anyone else?<br/>
 <br/>
Your child should have the same kind of help, no matter how old she  is.  <br/>

A person can stand up for herself with words and with the removal of herself <br/>
from a situation or getting others involved.<br/>
<br/>
A person can learn to defuse situations earlier, before any hitting starts.<br/>

A person who believes hitting is a good idea can go to prison where she will <br/>

I like Sandra&#39;s approach too. Violence should be the very last<br/>
option. But it should definately be an option. That&#39;s all I was<br/>
trying to say. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny you should mention jail time, because my husband&#39;s father<br/>
spent half his life in jail. I can see the point in what you are<br/>
saying, about other options and the confidence gained from martial<br/>
arts training. But have you ever been in a real fight? He has been in<br/>
many, and what he brings is the kind of self-confidence and attitude<br/>
that can only be gotten from real experience. He has a different<br/>
perspective than a person who has training but who has never fought<br/>
unrestricted by rules. I see it and I cannot help but respect it and<br/>
wish for my daughter to have it. As a teenager, I have been in MANY<br/>
situations where I found various alternatives to violence. But it was<br/>
because nobody ever talked to me about such things - besides saying<br/>
&#39;just ignore them&#39; and &#39;don&#39;t use violence&#39; - because I was scared to<br/>
fight, unsure of myself - not because of some noble notion that<br/>
non-violence is better. I don&#39;t want my daughter to grow up believing<br/>
herself weak and a coward. <br/>

I don&#39;t think my approach makes it &quot;definitely an option.&quot;<br/>
It makes it a possibly eventuality.  That&#39;s true even of murder, though.  A <br/>

I had an uncle who did a stint for armed robbery, got out and robbed a store <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752675001">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;maybe now that she is only 3, it seems ok for her to get an adult to <br/>
help. but if she learns to run to adults for her troubles with other <br/>
kids, when will that end? when she is 10 or 12 and talking isn&#39;t <br/>
working, and she has grown up believing in total non-violence, will <br/>
she just stand there and be hurt, and not know what to do? i did. and <br/>
i don&#39;t want her to be like that.<br/>
<br/>
on the other hand, my husband was raised to never let anybody hit him <br/>
without hitting them back. his father told him that if he was scared <br/>
that a particular person was about to hit him, he should hit them <br/>
first. he is confident that he can handle himself and knows how he <br/>
would react in a dangerous situation, because he has been there so <br/>
many times. i wish my parents had taught me how to stand up for <br/>
myself as well.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t &quot;seem&quot; OK. It *is* OK. She will know what to do later *because*<br/>
of the good help she has been given. From your own story, you were not given<br/>
good help or offered a plethora of strategies and choices, and that is why<br/>
you now feel inadequate when faced with conflict. <br/>
<br/>
These extremes of being either an abjectly fearful person or what is<br/>
effectively the bravado of a violent person who lands the first punch, are<br/>
*not* the only choices. Self-assertiveness need not be the same as<br/>
aggression. Kids who &quot;always hit&quot; are often labelled and avoided at the park<br/>
or in playgroups.<br/>
<br/>
Notice that your father-in-law was promoting a violent reaction *to fear*,<br/>
while you have grown up also living in fear of being hurt that you are now<br/>
carrying over to your child. I wonder if you are mistaking confidence for<br/>
aggression borne of a deep fear of being vulnerable. I believe that many<br/>
men, especially if they grew up in violent homes or homes without an<br/>
attentive, loving male presence, are afraid of their own softness or ability<br/>
to show gentleness, seeing it as weakness. They often find it hard to accept<br/>
or show love also.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn&#39;t it be great if you could help your child learn to recognize a<br/>
possibly dangerous situation and learn how to avoid it or escape from it, so<br/>
that either submission or violent posturing was avoidable also? One of the<br/>
great results of Unschooling is that our children usually trust us to give<br/>
them accurate and reasoned information, including about how to deal with<br/>
difficult or dangerous situations. They can come to us for help in finding<br/>
safe ways to achieve their desires or goals, instead of feeling the need to<br/>
engage in risky behaviors. It is so important to me that Jayn (5) feel that<br/>
she can *always* approach me for help with other people especially if they<br/>
are pushing her beyond her comfort level. <br/>
<br/>
Were you and your dh really in the same kind of violent situations? From<br/>
your description it is possible that your dh grew up in an abusive<br/>
household, or a terrifying locale of some violent subculture. <br/>
<br/>
It is very hard to show or model what one does not know or understand<br/>
oneself. I urge you to go to www.naturalchild.org and read some of the<br/>
articles there, most especially &quot;Helping Children Heal From Emotional Hurts&quot;<br/>
(also for your own childhood), and then explore some of Alice Miller&#39;s<br/>
writings about the nature of societal violence and its roots in childhood.<br/>
Another source of useful information might be Non-violent Communication -<br/>
but I don&#39;t have those websites at my fingertips. I&#39;m certain someone else<br/>
will be able to post them, unless you find links at Sandra&#39;s site.<br/>

Kirby, who&#39;s 18 now, has been studying karate since he was nine.  He&#39;s told <br/>
me three stories of situations in which other people might have been tempted to <br/>
fight or flee.  In each one, he used words and soothing humor.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
show fear, because he wasn&#39;t afraid, but he also didn&#39;t use agression, because he <br/>
was confident.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend martial arts, and it&#39;s something you the mom could do with <br/>
your daughter, too.  There is a philosophy that goes along with the best <br/>
schools, of peace-making and defense, of being whole and centered.<br/>
<br/>
Reading some Alice Miller, at least website summaries and discussions or <br/>
interviews (whole books aren&#39;t necessary, honestly) might give you a good idea of <br/>
how you yourself can begin to see your childhood in a way that will create <br/>
another tool in your tool box.  Understanding how you came to be the way you are <br/>
can give you a set of dos and don&#39;ts to use when deciding how to act now with <br/>
your daughter, so that you&#39;re neither blindly perpetuating the past nor living <br/>
in opposition to the past, but making each decision from a thoughtful <br/>
awareness of how things work.<br/>

<br/>
I would spend a little bit of time thinking about what you are looking<br/>
for in the experience, then call places and ask about observing a class<br/>
or two.  Definitely go and check out the vibe before you commit to<br/>
anything.  One caution, if you&#39;re primarily interested in quick self<br/>
defense skills, consider just taking a self defense class.  Any martial<br/>
art will probably improve your self defense skills in the long run, but<br/>
studying with that focus will probably not be the most rewarding way to<br/>
experience the art.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of what you&#39;re looking for... often people think of martial<br/>
arts styles being arranged on a soft -&gt; hard axis, where at the soft<br/>
extreme you might have something like tai chi (as far as I know it&#39;s<br/>
almost always non-contact), and on the hard end thinks like mui tai<br/>
(thai kick boxing), or jujitsu (in some Japanese arts there&#39;s a<br/>
distinction made between soft and hard forms using the -do or -jitsu<br/>
ending, so judo is the art studied for the throws and joint locks, while<br/>
jujitsu is the art studied for the joint breaks/more damaging forms).<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s available will usually depend on how urban an area you are in;<br/>
most places will have karate (pretty hard), judo (medium soft?) or<br/>
taekwondo (again, more hard) schools.  If you&#39;re somewhere with a higher<br/>
population density, you might find some less mainstream stuff, like<br/>
capoiera (a Brazilian form somewhere between dance and martial arts,<br/>
they do some really crazy gymnastic kind of moves).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent some time with karate (briefly, elementary school aged),<br/>
aikido (most of junior high, high school, several years worth off and on<br/>
since), and taekwondo (a year or so post college).  So far aikido has<br/>
been by far my favorite.  In aikido (at least in the dojo that I trained<br/>
at -- USAF western region affiliated) the bulk of training was done in<br/>
pairs.  The teacher would invite a student to help him demonstrate a<br/>
technique, would do it several times, at varying speeds, then the class<br/>
would pair up and practice it while the teacher would circulate and<br/>
point out problems/solutions as needed.  Techniques start with uke (the<br/>
one who is thrown) acting as the attacker, and nage (the one who throws)<br/>
recieves the attack and turns it into a throw or a joint lock.  You<br/>
spend alot of time learning how to fall ;)  It makes for very exiting<br/>
practices to watch or participate in once you have trained for awhile as<br/>
there is lots of people flying around on the mat.<br/>
<br/>
The emphasis was on seeing/feeling a technique, so there was very little<br/>
speaking/explaining done, which was great for some learning styles,<br/>
awful for others.  As students grow more skilled techniques move from<br/>
the more static variations (begining the technique where someone has<br/>
grabbed you) to active ones (the attack is a strike, with or without a<br/>
weapon).<br/>
<br/>
I feel like aikido developed my sense of physicality much more than any<br/>
of the more straight forward punch/kick/block stuff I&#39;ve been exposed<br/>
to.  I also enjoyed studying a form that focused on giving me the option<br/>
of appropriate level of response; most techniques can be executed<br/>
anywhere on the continuum of: with the protection of the attacker in<br/>
mind, through to the extremes of joint breaks/incapacitating strikes. <br/>
And training is just fun!  You really feel like you and your partner are<br/>
helping each other ride the edge of your skill levels.<br/>
<br/>
My experience with taekwondo was that class was usually less fun for me<br/>
than aikido; lots of time spent working on punches, kicks, blocks in<br/>
lines by yourself.  Some time sparring (more fun) but even the sparring<br/>
has to be at lower energy that the aikido practice to prevent serious<br/>
injury, and even at the lower energy levels you get more injuries.  I<br/>
had a friend who trained in a kung fu school through his black belt<br/>
level, and he really liked it but got sick of the level of pain you get<br/>
when practicing such aggressive techniques, even when being careful.<br/>
<br/>
Again, sorry for the rambling.  Hope it helps,<br/>

gym where our local homeschooling group had arranged a daytime class at <br/>
a substantial discount.  For the most part, we all enjoyed the classes <br/>
there... until too many kids got injured during non-TKD activities <br/>
(Hannah broke her arm during TAG!).  We discovered the teacher was <br/>
adding more PE-like activities for our /playground-deprived/ children <br/>
:::wretch::::<br/>
Recently we all moved to another gym, where the discount is not as deep, <br/>
but the Master is far more professional and has been involved in TKD <br/>
since he was a child in Korea.  The kids are all unlearning the bogus <br/>
stuff from the other gym and newly learning TKD.  This works great for <br/>
the kids who are very serious about acheiving their Black Belt goals (it <br/>
works good for my kids who go for the movement and socializing, too)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d check with the local group first -- the daytime discount is <br/>
incredible; next I&#39;d check with the &quot;Y.&quot;<br/>

My three children and I have been involved in martial arts for the <br/>
past five years.  Noah, now 14, earned his Black Belt a year ago, <br/>
and my 17 year old daughter earned her Black Belt a week ago.  My <br/>
thirteen year old daughter will likely test for Black Belt in a few <br/>
months or less, and I hope to test for Black in three weeks. My<br/>
husband passed away two months ago, and I so wish he could have <br/>
lived to see Sarah and Linnea test; he was very proud of their<br/>
accomplishments.   <br/>
<br/>
I would highly recommend observing classes.  Schools vary in the<br/>
amount of discipline they have.  Does the instructor(s) LIVE the <br/>
tenets and pledges?  Do they correct students respectfully and in a <br/>
positive fashion, or otherwise?  Take a good, long, hard look at the <br/>
instructor(s), their background, and exactly the type of martial art <br/>
they teach.  Our first instructor taught Tae Kwon Do with a little <br/>
Judo and Hapki-do, but eventually changed to Pankration (sp?) which <br/>
is far more physical and dangerous than some martial arts.  Also, <br/>
how organized are they in their teaching.  Our first instructor was <br/>
great at sparring, but teaching of techniques was very hit and miss, <br/>
and he would only test students when there were a lot ready; if you <br/>
were ready to test and no one else was, you waited quite awhile.  <br/>
Our present instructor (formerly Asst. Instructor at previous school)<br/>
also teaches Tae Kwon Do with a little Judo & Hapki-do, and is very <br/>
organized in teaching of techniques, there is some repetition at <br/>
times, but that is how skills continue to improve.    <br/>
   <br/>
Also, how many days a week do you plan to go to class.  Once a week<br/>
is really not enough to remember what you are learning; twice is<br/>
minimum at our school, to keep skills up.  More is better, especially<br/>
as the children get older.  Our family?  We are there five nights a<br/>
week.  Monday through Thursday are regular classes.  Fridays are<br/>
once a month classes such as Forms Class, monthly Testing night, <br/>
Black Belt Club, and Sparring night.  She occasionally gets a <br/>
weapons class in, too. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you find a good martial arts school that will fit your children<br/>
and family. -Jan Z., WI</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-675558813">Thank you to all who took the time to respond to my martial arts question. We visited one class tonight (Karate Jutsu) and my son LOVED it. It was like a light switched on in him! I can&#39;t tell you how grateful I am for the recommendations. <br/>
 <br/>
The school (they call it a &quot;dojo&quot;....new words for me to learn!) seems nice, but I think we&#39;re going to just have to try it and see how it goes- and be willing to look elsewhere if it doesn&#39;t work out. The class he took had a dad with his two sons and they were a homeschooling family which was kind of nice. My son most liked being in a class with older boys and the cool black uniforms they wear :) <br/>
 <br/>
The class was pretty small (maybe 6 kids) and there was a nice place for parents to watch through a glass window, and even a little toy room for younger siblings there. The place has a nice, family feel, but I&#39;ll be watching to see how the instructers interact with him as we continue.<br/>
 <br/>
Jan, I&#39;m so sorry to read of the loss of your husband. I cannot imagine what a difficult time it must be for you and your children. My thoughts go out to you as you move forward in your new life.<br/>
