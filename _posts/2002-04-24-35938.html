 </span></blockquote>Hi Jo Anna,<br/>
<br/>
How about having no plan of action? I know that can sound scary, especially<br/>
to someone who is new to homeschooling or especially unschooling. But<br/>
honestly, in our house, we have no plan of action, we have no &quot;school year&quot;,<br/>
we have no themes or child-led activities that are being planned that my 2<br/>
kids want to pursue next year.<br/>
<br/>
However, since your daughter has expressed an interest in edangered species,<br/>
it&#39;s great to pursue that interest. How about starting today or tomorrow<br/>
instead of waiting for the &quot;appropriate time&quot; to begin? Forgive me if I&#39;m<br/>
not accurately understanding your plans for unschooling your daughter, but<br/>
this is just my impression from what you&#39;ve written.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I love unschooling is because we are so free to learn about<br/>
whatever we want to, on any given day, at any given moment. There are no<br/>
plans in place to restrict us. One interest effortlessly leads into another<br/>
linked interest, and that is how we learn about things every day, all year.<br/>
It is also so natural to learn in this manner! I homeschooled my 2 boys for<br/>
5 years before unschooling, and everytime I asked my kids &quot;what would you<br/>
like to learn about?&quot;, first they would say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, then I would<br/>
press and they would give me some answer like &quot;airplanes&quot; and I tried to<br/>
follow through with some contrived thematic unit about &quot;airplanes&quot;, and it<br/>
all seemed so false and unnatural! The kids weren&#39;t really interested in it<br/>
and were quick to let me know that.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think it is good to help your child learn about what interests them,<br/>
but when they start resisting and saying they don&#39;t want to do a certain<br/>
scheduled activity, it&#39;s time to back off because the learning isn&#39;t<br/>
happening anymore, IMO. And I know that&#39;s true about how *I* learn things,<br/>
too. When my DH starts talking to me about JAVA programming, my eyes glaze<br/>
over and I want to run out of the room! But when I want to learn something<br/>
specific to help myself on the computer, I ask him about it and I learn it<br/>
immediately, and retain it.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s how we do unschooling at our house. What has your experience<br/>
been with your children?<br/>

<br/>
This sounds very much like the way I did things prior to total <br/>
unschooling. We had a lot of fun, but I do see now how I was keeping <br/>
us &quot;boxed in&quot; so to speak.<br/>
I was sending the message that learning happened at a certain time <br/>
and place and that we should plan for it.<br/>
I&#39;m not disparaging having  a &quot;plan&quot; as far as working out what <br/>
tickets you need and all....but it&#39;s the same type of planning I do <br/>
with dh really.<br/>
If it helps people transition into unschooling and if your child is <br/>
happy doing things that way, then great! I know it really helped my <br/>
transition, and the kids had fun with the things I planned based on <br/>
their interests.<br/>
I think of unschooling as very serendipitous.....moments seem to find <br/>
their way to us as we open ourselves to possibilities and seeing the <br/>
entire world as our playground!!<br/>
