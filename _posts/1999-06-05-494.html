<div id="ygrps-yiv-1234508961">&lt;Dave tells Kelly that in WA state, standardized tests must be<br/>
administered to homeschooled children, but the test results are not<br/>
required to be reported ... to anyone! Go figure. Now, Kelly wonders,<br/>
&quot;Why must we test our children if they don&#39;t want the results?&quot;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Dave and Kelly ~<br/>
<br/>
I may be *way* off here, but someone told me that school districts can<br/>
factor homeschooled children into their formula for receiving Federal<br/>
aid. I always wondered how this could be accomplished, but the situation<br/>
above might be an example.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone here shed light on this supposed fact?<br/>

call the school and find out when the tests will be administered (like I<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Naaa - they can only do this (at least in WA) if the kids are enrolled in the <br/>
district &quot;Homeschooling Program&quot;.  Actually, if the ARE enrolled in that <br/>
program, they are not considered Homeschoolers by the district. (although <br/>
THEY don&#39;t tell you that).  They collect their money from the state/fed and <br/>
go on their merry way.  The thing about testing in WA is that they want to be <br/>
sure that you have the tests, showing progress for the time when you will <br/>
re-enroll them in public school. (HA!!)  Educator&#39;s just can&#39;t understand <br/>
that kids will homeschool THROUGH High School, etc. Of course, some DO return <br/>
to school - and then they are put through a battery of tests to determine <br/>
their grade level.  &lt;sigh&gt;  We have so much to teach them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

school.  Some are far more welcoming then others.  If you DO use the school&#39;s <br/>
testing services, they get copies of the test scores too.  Personally - I <br/>
don&#39;t WANT them to have my test scores.  It isn&#39;t their business, and I would <br/>
hate for them to boost their scores with MY children&#39;s hard work...  My kids <br/>
are learning according to THEIR needs, THEIR wishes... the school is NOT <br/>
taking credit for that!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, Mary, you are right. Only one person, the principal, told me good<br/>
infrmation. Everyone else gave me the brush-off when I was trying to get<br/>
some insight into homeschooling. Of course, now I know not to go to the<br/>
school for homeschool info. When I think back on it, how dumb was I!?!?<br/>
<br/>
And no, I wouldn&#39;t want my kid&#39;s test scores with the school either. I&#39;d<br/>
rather buy the tests from FLO and administer them myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72143405">In Wa, I think you have a few options for testing.  You can do it through <br/>
your district, if you chose; you can administer it at home, yourself; or you <br/>
can do it as a group.  (I&quot;m sure there are more options).  <br/>
<br/>
In Marysville there is a gal who will administer the tests once a year.  YOu <br/>
have the option of letting her grade it; or grading it yourself.  Thats we <br/>
are doing.  <br/>
