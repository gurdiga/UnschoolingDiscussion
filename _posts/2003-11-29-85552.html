<div id="ygrps-yiv-224686808">For what it&#39;s worth, I think that people tend to right OR left brained, and so maybe the children are just literary (right) minded.  Built that way, inherited from a parent etc., rather than &quot;going to heal&quot; into math (left) minded people.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>       Sigh. I understand! This happened with my DD and arithmetic <br/>
(calculation.) I think she&#39;s finally beginning to come out of it as a teenager, but <br/>
maybe it&#39;s just my wishing or hoping.<br/>
<br/>
       I&#39;ll never know if she could have enjoyed as much astonishing success <br/>
as a self-motivated mathematical mind as she&#39;s enjoying as an unschooled <br/>
literary mind. I really do wish I could undo whatever damage my &quot;teaching&quot; attempts <br/>
caused. But OTOH, thank goodness all is not lost. :)  JJ</div>
