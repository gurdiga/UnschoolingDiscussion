<br/>
  Thank you for sharing that link, Sandra; it&#39;s one I hadn&#39;t read all the <br/>
  way through.<br/>
<br/>
  This morning was our monthly La Leche League meeting, and across the way <br/>
  in the same church was a MOMs group meeting/ playgroup for SAHMs. When <br/>
  their meeting was over, one of the coordinators came over and handed us <br/>
  her card and asked for a LLL flyer that she could pass around to her <br/>
  moms. That was really nice, and my kids (7, 5 and 4) were enjoying <br/>
  running around with her two little girls, maybe 5 and 3 or 4 and 2. The <br/>
  mom was telling me there were kids of all ages in the group, though they <br/>
  didn&#39;t come during the day, of course, because they were in school. I <br/>
  just smiled and nodded and thanked her.<br/>
<br/>
  Once we were done exchanging info and that mom was trying to get herself <br/>
  and her kids ready to go, I could hear her yelling at them in the hall <br/>
  to sit still, I&#39;m-tired-of-this kind of stuff, etc. and I was thinking <br/>
  to myself, &quot;no, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be joining those playgroups.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Well, Julia and I went to the bathroom while Sam and Em stayed in the <br/>
  foyer with one of our LLL leaders, and when I got back, the MOM&#39;s group <br/>
  mother was looking at Emily, saying &quot;Well, I don&#39;t know what you mean&quot; <br/>
  with a puzzled look on her face. I said something like oh, what did she <br/>
  say kind of thing, and the lady said, &quot;She said that you don&#39;t ground.&quot; <br/>
  I just laughed and said, &quot;No, we don&#39;t punish,&quot; leaving the astonished <br/>
  woman in my wake as I went to retrieve the rest of our stuff from the room.<br/>
<br/>
  The other LLL leader followed me in and related that the MOMs group <br/>
  woman was yelling at her daughters and telling them not to move from <br/>
  their chairs or get up again, so Emily walked over and very politely <br/>
  complimented the woman on her jacket, told her that her mommy had the <br/>
  same jacket, but that her mommy didn&#39;t ground her kids.  *roflmao*  The <br/>
  other leader and I were laughing so hard (quietly); she was just <br/>
  cracking up that Em first did the whole fashion comment and then segued <br/>
  into the whole punishment thing.<br/>
<br/>
  Em&#39;s concept of getting in trouble is when either dh or I are unhappy <br/>
  with one of them and maybe speak sharply, but she&#39;s getting the idea <br/>
  that other parents out there &quot;ground&quot; and punish their kids, including <br/>
  spanking, much of this from cartoons and such. Two neighborhood girls <br/>
  (11 and 9) have also told her all about grounding, to which Em <br/>
  supposedly responded, &quot;Well, my mom doesn&#39;t ground.&quot;  The girls told her <br/>
  that&#39;s because she was still young and that I would start soon! She and <br/>
  I had a long talk about that one and why they might tell her such a <br/>
  thing. *sigh*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612556096">Thank you so much! This email was a bright spot in a very sad day for <br/>
me, helping me wrench my perspective back to where it should be: my <br/>
precious children and our wonderful life!<br/>
<br/>
Sadly, this same gal I was talking and laughing with on Friday was flown <br/>
yesterday to a cancer center in DC because the doctors strongly believe <br/>
she has Hodgkin&#39;s Disease--cancer of the lymphatic system. She went to <br/>
Urgent Care for an incredibly swollen neck gland Friday evening, <br/>
assuming she had strep, and an x-ray showed a large mass in her lung. *sigh*<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this gift Heidi!<br/>
