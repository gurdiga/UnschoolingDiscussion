From: &quot;Ken Cooper&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ken@...">ken@...</a>&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; An issue that I am grappling with now is how to balance the self direction<br/>
&gt; and trust of my children with the needs of our family.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering about another spin-off on this basic question.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m noticing recently that I have a habit of answering requests with another <br/>
request, with my kids especially as they get older.<br/>
<br/>
Teen:  Could you make some cookies, mom?<br/>
Me:   OK.... will you bring in a couple of armfuls of firewood?<br/>
<br/>
I do it a bit with my younger kids too but not as much.   The thing is the <br/>
younger kids are usually happy and honored to be asked to help (and if they <br/>
aren&#39;t I let it drop), while the teenager.... not so much, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
From my perspective, it seems like a way not to get personally overloaded <br/>
with work.  But I&#39;m wondering if to my teen it looks like a conditional <br/>
&quot;yes&quot;.  And also thinking that it probably IS a conditional yes.  &quot;OK, I&#39;ll <br/>
do it IF you do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is this modelling a real-life principle, that we work as a team  --or just <br/>
teaching the child to see a relationship in a bargaining, mercenary way??<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, just writing it out clarifies it a bit but I&#39;d still like to know if <br/>
anyone has any comments or if there is a website resource on this <br/>
question -- I&#39;m sure it&#39;s come up before.<br/>

 <br/>
Maybe re-wording it, if you honestly need help...like<br/>
 <br/>
Teen:  Could you make some cookies mom?<br/>
Me:  Well, I really need to get some firewood into the house or we  will run <br/>
out.  Could you do that for me so I can get started on the  cookies?<br/>
 <br/>
I guess it&#39;s still conditional, but honest...there&#39;s times I would gladly  do <br/>
things for someone if I just had enough time to do it all.  Splitting  stuff <br/>
up between us sometimes gives me that time.  <br/>

I think it&#39;s fine as long as it works the other way too:<br/>
<br/>
Mom: Could you bring in a couple of armloads of firewood?<br/>
<br/>
Teen: OK, will you bake some cookies?<br/>
<br/>
If they don&#39;t have the same opportunity, it could seem manipulative.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>GOOD POINT!<br/>
<br/>
What I was thinking was that if it&#39;s a related request, or actually   <br/>
facilitates the cookie-making then it makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly says, &quot;Would you make quesadillas?&quot; I sometimes say &quot;Could  <br/>
you grate the cheese?&quot;  And while she&#39;s doing that, I do all the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Actually she  usually says &quot;Would you help me make a quesadilla?&quot; and  <br/>
I ask her what part she wants me to do.  But if she said &quot;Would you  <br/>
make quesadillas?&quot; and I said &quot;Yes, if you will mop the floor,&quot; that  <br/>
would seem kind of like a no, to me (and maybe to her), or like she  <br/>
had to earn my help.<br/>
<br/>
If she asks me to watch a movie with her, I might say &quot;Okay, but will  <br/>
you turn the water off in the yard while I switch the laundry?&quot;   <br/>
Sometimes there are preparations for sitting down for an hour and a  <br/>
half.  Sometimes there are preparations for making quesadillas.<br/>
<br/>
If you needed firewood to make cookies because you have a wood stove,  <br/>
then asking for firewood makes total sense.<br/>

Ahh, OK, that would be my motive too.<br/>
That helps.<br/>
In my family of origin, it seemed like my mom COULD do it all.... on the <br/>
other hand, I wouldn&#39;t have asked her to make cookies when I was a teenager. <br/>
I like the fact that my kids ask me for things.   On the other hand, I do <br/>
have a long checklist and so asking for their help getting through it helps <br/>
make my reaction to their requests more positive.<br/>

people in these unschooling discussions have written about doing what  <br/>
we do as gifts for their families.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get mad if I give someone a gift and they don&#39;t give me a gift.<br/>
<br/>
And another goal I have, besides peace in the family and a  <br/>
comfortable environment for my children, is to be as good a person as  <br/>
I can be, to make good decisions for the benefit of being a better  <br/>
person, a good person, of integrity.   So if I find myself feeling  <br/>
resentful I might just ask for help, but I might do some &quot;self talk&quot;  <br/>
and remind myself that that &quot;I&#39;m a martyr&quot; whining is never  <br/>
attractive, and rarely true and fair.<br/>

Joyce writes about that better than anyone, but I don&#39;t remember if  <br/>
it was Joyce&#39;s idea in the first place.  I know there&#39;s some writing  <br/>
about it linked at the chores page:<br/>
