<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786802133">So, coaching 6 and 7 year old boys soccer is like herding cats. I knew<br/>
this before I signed on. One of my spice, the SidehKitty, took over the<br/>
team for practice last Tuesday because I was sick. Now, he has voiced<br/>
his reservations about unschooling for fear our little FaeBeast won&#39;t<br/>
learn how to read. So, with that explanantion, let me explan Tuesdays<br/>
practice as lead by my dear SidheKitty.<br/>
<br/>
First thing, he asked the kids if and WHY they wanted to play soccer<br/>
this year. After getting all their answers, he told them to divide<br/>
themselves up into groups and play soceer. He&#39;d be happy to help anyone<br/>
with anything in particular. The 4 most experienced boys raced off, and<br/>
began a free-form scrimage. OUr son began to practice dribbling up and<br/>
down the field, and the other fou boys asked to be taught how to field<br/>
the ball on their chests. They all switched and swapped activites until<br/>
the last 15 minutes. My spice then said that the whle field was needed<br/>
to scrimmage on, so anyone doing something else needed to do it BESIDE<br/>
the field. Well, all nine kids joined in the scrimmage - some asking<br/>
advice as they went - and played their hearts out. TODAY was their first<br/>
game. They scored 6 goals. The other side scored one.<br/>
