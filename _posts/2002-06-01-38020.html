<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766858380">**We all know that children learn like CRAZY during their first 5 <br/>
years. Does anyone know if anyone&#39;s ever done a study that correlates the slow-down <br/>
in learning to a child&#39;s introduction into a school environment. In other words, has <br/>
anyone ever shown that NOT putting a child in a school environment, but <br/>
instead keeping a child in a natural, self-directed environment (you know, like <br/>
the one they&#39;re in BEFORE they&#39;re sent to public school!) eliminates or at <br/>
least diminishes the slow-down in learning?**<br/>
<br/>
Do we?  Isn&#39;t that an assumption (learning like crazy first 5 years)?  Don&#39;t we as unschoolers tend to agree that children/adults/everyone learns when they want to?  When their ready.  <br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t society push this early learning thing?  Are they really &quot;sponges&quot; or just normal humans? <br/>
<br/>
While I totally agree that schooling kills off any desire to continue learning - I think that saying children learn &quot;like crazy&quot; during the first 5 years also puts alot of pressure on society to make that happen.  We create that false impression.  Sure you can force kids to do things (at any age), but would they have naturally choose that timeline?  I don&#39;t honestly believe we ever &quot;slow down&quot; our learning ability.  But we will believe that if it&#39;s fed to us enough times.<br/>

at their own pace.<br/>

referring to the NATURAL learning that occurs for all<br/>
of us. And in the early years, children learn an<br/>
astonishing amount ... without anyone TEACHING them at<br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m not saying that our ability to learn<br/>
diminishes, I&#39;m merely talking about how school can<br/>
squelch the natural inclination to learn by sucking<br/>
the life out of the process. I know that&#39;s what<br/>
happened to my son during his school years. He&#39;s still<br/>
in the process of recovering from that.<br/>

<br/>
No, early learning is documented like crazy.  They go from immobility to <br/>
running and jumping.  They go from not understanding language to using <br/>
thousands of words.   With words come concepts and with concepts comes their <br/>
own categorization of things.  Knowing a dog from a cat takes a LOT of higher <br/>
thought, once you&#39;ve generalized and specified and compared and contrasted.  <br/>
And they don&#39;t need to have the least idea what those fancy thought processes <br/>
are to perform them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Doesn&#39;t society push this early learning thing?  Are they really &quot;sponges&quot; <br/>
or just normal humans? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Normal  humans are sponge-like in their desire to learn, and that desire will <br/>
continue until it&#39;s curtailed or shamed out of them or until they give up the <br/>
hope that others will help them learn, or until they get the idea that if you <br/>
learn just for fun you&#39;re a dupe.   THAT is pushed into them by other kids, <br/>
when they figure out that school rewards certain kinds of learning and <br/>
punishes other kinds.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think that saying children learn &quot;like crazy&quot; during the first 5 years <br/>
also puts alot of pressure on society to make that happen. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s nothing society invented.  It happens when babies look around, <br/>
sit up, and take off all within two years&#39; time.<br/>

There was an animal in our neighborhood when I was about twelve and lots of <br/>
us kids kept trying to catch sight of it again, because we did NOT know <br/>
whether it was a dog or a cat.   And we weren&#39;t toddlers, it was just <br/>
freakish.  It was a low-to-the-ground silky-haired skittish thing (cat-clues) <br/>
but didn&#39;t run with two feet together like cats do (dog clue).  Ears were no <br/>
help.  We couldn&#39;t get close.    Finally we asked kids who lived closer and <br/>
they said freaky looking little long-haired dog.<br/>

it&#39;s usually a good idea it go back and figure out how they&#39;re getting the<br/>
interpretation they are.<br/>
<br/>
Communication isn&#39;t as easy as some people make it seem! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Especially when we&#39;re trying to convey some complex thought, we tend to<br/>
write out the highlights while our brains silently fill in the gaps between<br/>
our words. Even more especially when we think we&#39;re talking about something<br/>
so obvious or mutually agreed on that we unconsciously feel a few words will<br/>
call up the same complex thoughts in others.<br/>
<br/>
So we think we&#39;ve said one thing and have actually said something very<br/>
different. What people end up hearing are the islands poking up when what we<br/>
thought we had been talking about was the sea floor and the mountain chains<br/>
rising up out of it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also helpful to picture when we&#39;ve written to a public forum that we&#39;ve<br/>
created an entity that&#39;s separate from us. An idea. If someone takes that<br/>
idea and examines it, they aren&#39;t examining us, just the idea.<br/>
<br/>
(Corinna, I went back through the emails. If you want some help puzzling out<br/>
what the chain was leading up to your frustration just write to me privately<br/>
off list at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:fetteroll@...">fetteroll@...</a> and I can help you figure it out.)<br/>

constantly amazes me. My son Will is 19 months old.<br/>
Yesterday, it was way too hot to be out in the sun<br/>
(well, you southerners and southwesterners probably<br/>
would think I&#39;m a wimp, but we&#39;ve got red hair,<br/>
freckles and fair skin in this family, and stay<br/>
undercover when it&#39;s too hot!) so we made finger<br/>
paints and sat on the porch and made a big gloppy mess<br/>
painting with fingers and feet and toes, etc. <br/>
<br/>
In the course of talking, I asked Will if he was going<br/>
to use the purple, and I&#39;ll be darned if later that<br/>
afternoon he wasn&#39;t pointing to flowers on the porch,<br/>
flowers in the garden, and various other things he<br/>
knows the name for and calling them purple. Wow! I was<br/>
amazed that the concept of the color purple would<br/>
stick. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, everything furry except a cow and a cat is<br/>
a DOG (including the deer that was in our front lawn<br/>
IN TOWN this morning!) but he&#39;ll get there!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a marvel to watch, isn&#39;t it?<br/>

first post was just a wondering that, left to our own<br/>
devices and not subjected to public school, perhaps<br/>
our learning abilities/desire would NOT slow down. I<br/>
can tell you that my oldest son&#39;s desire to learn<br/>
definitely did slow down after entering school. <br/>

I fear I didn&#39;t communicate that very well at all. I<br/>
hope that clears it up. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1115901926">I have to share with you folks something that happened<br/>
over the past few days on another yahoo list I belong<br/>
to (organic gardening).<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned they were starting a community<br/>
learning center, and I had just read an article about<br/>
on in Pennsylvania, so I posted information and the<br/>
link to their site. Nothing else, just stated I was<br/>
happy to meet another homeschooler, and asked how old<br/>
her children were, real innocuous stuff....<br/>
<br/>
Someone else on the group posted a scathing letter<br/>
about how ridiculous homeschooling is, and her bottom<br/>
line was that children have to learn to toe the line,<br/>
submit to authority, and people like me who think<br/>
their children don&#39;t have to follow the rules are<br/>
ruining their children, etc., etc.  .... oh, and of<br/>
course the socialization thing :)<br/>
<br/>
Wow! You know, I&#39;ve talked to lots of people who were<br/>
unaware of the insufficiencies of the school system (I<br/>
used to be one of them), but I never really thought<br/>
about people who KNEW that compulsory schooling serves<br/>
to indoctrinate children into a life of obedience and<br/>
&quot;toeing the line&quot; and actually WANT that for their<br/>
children!<br/>
<br/>
Well, a million things went through my mind about how<br/>
to respond to this person, but I really don&#39;t think<br/>
that an organic gardening list is the appropriate<br/>
place for it. So I told her I thought that it&#39;s ok for<br/>
some people to send their children to public schools<br/>
and some people to homeschool their children. I told<br/>
her that I agree that both produce a different result,<br/>
and that I&#39;m quite sure which result I want for my<br/>
children.  I also told her I&#39;d be glad to discuss it<br/>
further off-list, but she hasn&#39;t responded to that<br/>
invitation yet.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid this was my first contact with a rabid<br/>
anti-homeschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else met up with the likes of that?<br/>

&gt; W1: Hi. My name is Maggie. My kids are the three in<br/>

&gt; W2: (Smiles) I&#39;m Terri. Mine are in the pink and<br/>

&gt; W1: Usually two or three times a week, after we go<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; the library.<br/>
&gt; W2: Wow. Where do you find the time?<br/>
&gt; W1: We home school, so we do it during the day most<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; the time.<br/>
&gt; W2: Some of my neighbors home school, but I send my<br/>
&gt; kids to public school.<br/>
&gt; W1: How do you do it?<br/>
&gt; W2: It&#39;s not easy. I go to all the PTO meetings and<br/>
&gt; work with the kids every day after school and stay<br/>
&gt; real involved.<br/>
&gt; W1: But what about socialization? Aren&#39;t you worried<br/>
&gt; about them being cooped up all day with kids their<br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; ages, never getting the opportunity for natural<br/>
&gt; relationships?<br/>
&gt; W2: Well, yes. But I work hard to balance that. They<br/>
&gt; have some friends who&#39;re home schooled, and we visit<br/>
&gt; their grandparents almost every month.<br/>
&gt; W1: Sounds like you&#39;re a very dedicated mom. But<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; you worry about all the opportunities they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; missing<br/>
&gt; out on? I mean they&#39;re so isolated from real life --<br/>
&gt; how will they know what the world is like -- what<br/>
&gt; people do to make a living -- how to get along with<br/>
&gt; all different kinds of people?<br/>
&gt; W2: Oh, we discussed that at PTO, and we started a<br/>
&gt; fund to bring real people into the classrooms. Last<br/>
&gt; month, we had a policeman and a doctor come in to<br/>
&gt; talk<br/>
&gt; to every class. And next month, we&#39;re having a woman<br/>
&gt; from Japan and a man from Kenya come to speak.<br/>
&gt; W1: Oh, we met a man from Japan in the grocery store<br/>
&gt; the other week, and he got to talking about his<br/>
&gt; childhood in Tokyo. My kids were absolutely<br/>
&gt; fascinated. We invited him to dinner and got to meet<br/>
&gt; his wife and their three children.<br/>
&gt; W2: That&#39;s nice. Hmm. Maybe we should plan some<br/>
&gt; Japanese food for the lunchroom on Multicultural<br/>
&gt; Day.<br/>
&gt; W1: Maybe your Japanese guest could eat with the<br/>
&gt; children.<br/>
&gt; W2: Oh, no. She&#39;s on a very tight schedule. She has<br/>
&gt; two other schools to visit that day. It&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; system-wide thing we&#39;re doing.<br/>
&gt; W1: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Well, maybe you&#39;ll meet someone<br/>
&gt; interesting in the grocery store sometime and you&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; end up having them over for dinner.<br/>
&gt; W2: I don&#39;t think so. I never talk to people in the<br/>
&gt; store -- certainly not people who might not even<br/>
&gt; speak<br/>
&gt; my language. What if that Japanese man hadn&#39;t spoken<br/>
&gt; English?<br/>
&gt; W1: To tell you the truth, I never had time to think<br/>
&gt; about it. Before I even saw him, my six-year-old had<br/>
&gt; asked him what he was going to do with all the<br/>
&gt; oranges<br/>
&gt; he was buying.<br/>
&gt; W2: Your child talks to strangers?<br/>
&gt; W1: I was right there with him. He knows that as<br/>
&gt; long<br/>
&gt; as he&#39;s with me, he can talk to anyone he wishes.<br/>
&gt; W2: But you&#39;re developing dangerous habits in him.<br/>
&gt; My<br/>
&gt; children never talk to strangers.<br/>
&gt; W1: Not even when they&#39;re with you?<br/>
&gt; W2: They&#39;re never with me, except at home after<br/>
&gt; school. So you see why it&#39;s so important for them to<br/>
&gt; understand that talking to strangers is a big no-no.<br/>
&gt; W1: Yes, I do. But if they were with you, they could<br/>
&gt; get to meet interesting people and still be safe.<br/>
&gt; They&#39;d get a taste of the real world, in real<br/>
&gt; settings. They&#39;d also get a real feel for how to<br/>
&gt; tell<br/>
&gt; when a situation is dangerous or suspicious.<br/>
&gt; W2: They&#39;ll get that in the third and fifth grades<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; their health courses.<br/>
&gt; W1: Well, I can tell you&#39;re a very caring mom. Let<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; give you my number--if you ever want to talk, give<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; call. It was good to meet you.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have to share with you folks something that<br/>
&gt; happened<br/>
&gt; &gt; over the past few days on another yahoo list I<br/>
&gt; belong<br/>
&gt; &gt; to (organic gardening).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Someone mentioned they were starting a community<br/>
&gt; &gt; learning center, and I had just read an article<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; on in Pennsylvania, so I posted information and<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; link to their site. Nothing else, just stated I<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; happy to meet another homeschooler, and asked how<br/>
&gt; old<br/>
&gt; &gt; her children were, real innocuous stuff....<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Someone else on the group posted a scathing letter<br/>
&gt; &gt; about how ridiculous homeschooling is, and her<br/>
&gt; bottom<br/>
&gt; &gt; line was that children have to learn to toe the<br/>
&gt; line,<br/>
&gt; &gt; submit to authority, and people like me who think<br/>
&gt; &gt; their children don&#39;t have to follow the rules are<br/>
&gt; &gt; ruining their children, etc., etc.  .... oh, and<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; course the socialization thing :)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wow! You know, I&#39;ve talked to lots of people who<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; unaware of the insufficiencies of the school<br/>
&gt; system (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; used to be one of them), but I never really<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; about people who KNEW that compulsory schooling<br/>
&gt; serves<br/>
&gt; &gt; to indoctrinate children into a life of obedience<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;toeing the line&quot; and actually WANT that for their<br/>
&gt; &gt; children!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Well, a million things went through my mind about<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; to respond to this person, but I really don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that an organic gardening list is the appropriate<br/>
&gt; &gt; place for it. So I told her I thought that it&#39;s ok<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; some people to send their children to public<br/>
&gt; schools<br/>
&gt; &gt; and some people to homeschool their children. I<br/>
&gt; told<br/>
&gt; &gt; her that I agree that both produce a different<br/>
&gt; result,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and that I&#39;m quite sure which result I want for my<br/>
&gt; &gt; children.  I also told her I&#39;d be glad to discuss<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; further off-list, but she hasn&#39;t responded to that<br/>
&gt; &gt; invitation yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m afraid this was my first contact with a rabid<br/>
&gt; &gt; anti-homeschooler.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyone else met up with the likes of that?<br/>

<br/>
I have.<br/>
<br/>
It seems definitely a place people come FROM rather than go to.  I mean <br/>
that&#39;s the starting point, and seems to be a self-preservation instinct.  If <br/>
I had to suffer through school because it was good for me and kept me from <br/>
being spoiled and created all the good that is in me, then it was a good <br/>
thing.  If it&#39;s a good thing, it should be preserved.   <br/>
<br/>
Right under the surface of that is the fear that maybe school was NOT <br/>
crucial, and that either all one&#39;s teachers and relatives were flat out lying <br/>
about its importance or (maybe worse) that they were all blind and unthinking <br/>
about it.  Going to that place (as unschoolers all have to do) is a painful <br/>
review of one&#39;s own life which takes months or years.  Most people seem not <br/>
to want any probing reflection into their lives.  And some people don&#39;t have <br/>
the inter- and intra-personal skill to think that way anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But from people with the kneejerk defense of school come some who gradually <br/>
see the advantages of homeschooling and, some of them, of unschooling.  And <br/>
sometimes those who were the most adamantly against homeschooling become big <br/>
promoters out of guilt and shame over what they said earlier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that because I&#39;m one of them!<br/>

I do know what you&#39;re saying here. When I read<br/>
&quot;Teenage Liberation Handbook&quot;, on the one hand, it<br/>
made me so excited for the possibilitites for my<br/>
children, and on the other hand, it made me feel grief<br/>
for the opportunities that I could have had as an<br/>
adolescent.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but feel sorry for the children, though,<br/>
of parents whose resentments about their own<br/>
childhoods keep them from providing a better lifestyle<br/>
for their own children.<br/>
<br/>
As for my prior feelings about homeschooling, I once<br/>
thought that the only people who homeschool were<br/>
isolationist religious zealots trying to keep their<br/>
kids away from the bad elements! Boy, I sure am glad I<br/>
was wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198256655"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Neural pathways are being grown at an amazing rate the first five years. <br/>
&gt;By age 8, we are basically hard wired for life. Now how we use that &quot;hard <br/>
&gt;wiring&quot; has a lot to do with whether or not the person in question <br/>
&gt;continues with the desire to learn.<br/>
&gt;You can quit using neural pathways that grew, you can spark neural <br/>
&gt;pathways into use, but you don&#39;t grow them later.<br/>
&gt;Ren<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Although this is a very wide held theory, new research is showing otherwise.  They have viewed and recorded NEW neuron growth in adults - even seniors.  I think our view of our mind is still formed by a science which is still in its infancy.  Given the right stimulation (and researchers are also looking at enviroment/exercise) our brain is capable of growing at any age.  <br/>
<br/>
 Althougth I totally agree that I&#39;m talking about happy, healthy, childhoods, this new info could mean that a child who comes into a better life at an older age still has a chance to reach new brain capacity.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of off topic - this months Scientific American has a fascinating article about sevants.  They are saying that not only are some people born sevants due to autism, celebral palsy (sp?), and other cognitive disabilities, but some people BECOME sevants after a brain injury to the left hemisphere.  So really our brains are always capable of being &quot;re-wired&quot;<br/>

breaks my heart. <br/>
When it comes to complete strangers attacking you, IMHO it is best to just <br/>
let it be. You can turn off your computer or filter that person out of your <br/>
cyber-life. If it is at the store, you really can leave your cart in the <br/>
middle of the isle, take your kids by the hand and leave. Or in my case, <br/>
leave the cart in the check out lane while the ignorant slob, in serious need <br/>
of a bath, who was checking my groceries stands there foaming at the mouth <br/>
because my kids aren&#39;t in school at 11:30 in the morning. Don&#39;t worry when <br/>
she calls after you, don&#39;t you want your groceries and now she has to put all <br/>
the food back, it is part of her job. <br/>

&lt;&lt; Why do you call Australia Oz? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Americans say &quot;Australia&quot; there&#39;s quite an &quot;s&quot; sound, and in Aussie too, <br/>
but Australians pronounce it more as a &quot;z&quot; so their &quot;Aussie&quot; sounds like our <br/>
&quot;Ozzie.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you know &#39;Oscar&#39; pronounced in English and &#39;Oscar&#39; pronounced in Spanish, <br/>
it&#39;s like that difference.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181045855">Hi Shellie,<br/>
<br/>
just quickly as it is late here in Oz but I just wanted to forward this<br/>
story from another list that I thought was great - sorry you had to<br/>
experience unschooling bullying from a schooler at the vegie patch (my<br/>
attempt at a joke)<br/>
<br/>
And read this to get an idea of why school such a<br/>
restrictive environment to learn in<br/>
<br/>
What ABOUT socialization?<br/>
<br/>
Two women meet at a playground, where their children<br/>
are swinging and playing ball. The women are sitting<br/>
on a bench watching. Eventually, they begin to talk.<br/>
W1: Hi. My name is Maggie. My kids are the three in<br/>
red shirts -- helps me keep track of them.<br/>
W2: (Smiles) I&#39;m Terri. Mine are in the pink and<br/>
yellow shirts. Do you come here a lot?<br/>
W1: Usually two or three times a week, after we go to<br/>
the library.<br/>
W2: Wow. Where do you find the time?<br/>
W1: We home school, so we do it during the day most of<br/>
the time.<br/>
W2: Some of my neighbors home school, but I send my<br/>
kids to public school.<br/>
W1: How do you do it?<br/>
W2: It&#39;s not easy. I go to all the PTO meetings and<br/>
work with the kids every day after school and stay<br/>
real involved.<br/>
W1: But what about socialization? Aren&#39;t you worried<br/>
about them being cooped up all day with kids their own<br/>
ages, never getting the opportunity for natural<br/>
relationships?<br/>
W2: Well, yes. But I work hard to balance that. They<br/>
have some friends who&#39;re home schooled, and we visit<br/>
their grandparents almost every month.<br/>
W1: Sounds like you&#39;re a very dedicated mom. But don&#39;t<br/>
you worry about all the opportunities they&#39;re missing<br/>
out on? I mean they&#39;re so isolated from real life --<br/>
how will they know what the world is like -- what<br/>
people do to make a living -- how to get along with<br/>
all different kinds of people?<br/>
W2: Oh, we discussed that at PTO, and we started a<br/>
fund to bring real people into the classrooms. Last<br/>
month, we had a policeman and a doctor come in to talk<br/>
to every class. And next month, we&#39;re having a woman<br/>
from Japan and a man from Kenya come to speak.<br/>
W1: Oh, we met a man from Japan in the grocery store<br/>
the other week, and he got to talking about his<br/>
childhood in Tokyo. My kids were absolutely<br/>
fascinated. We invited him to dinner and got to meet<br/>
his wife and their three children.<br/>
W2: That&#39;s nice. Hmm. Maybe we should plan some<br/>
Japanese food for the lunchroom on Multicultural Day.<br/>
W1: Maybe your Japanese guest could eat with the<br/>
children.<br/>
W2: Oh, no. She&#39;s on a very tight schedule. She has<br/>
two other schools to visit that day. It&#39;s a<br/>
system-wide thing we&#39;re doing.<br/>
W1: Oh, I&#39;m sorry. Well, maybe you&#39;ll meet someone<br/>
interesting in the grocery store sometime and you&#39;ll<br/>
end up having them over for dinner.<br/>
W2: I don&#39;t think so. I never talk to people in the<br/>
store -- certainly not people who might not even speak<br/>
my language. What if that Japanese man hadn&#39;t spoken<br/>
English?<br/>
W1: To tell you the truth, I never had time to think<br/>
about it. Before I even saw him, my six-year-old had<br/>
asked him what he was going to do with all the oranges<br/>
he was buying.<br/>
W2: Your child talks to strangers?<br/>
W1: I was right there with him. He knows that as long<br/>
as he&#39;s with me, he can talk to anyone he wishes.<br/>
W2: But you&#39;re developing dangerous habits in him. My<br/>
children never talk to strangers.<br/>
W1: Not even when they&#39;re with you?<br/>
W2: They&#39;re never with me, except at home after<br/>
school. So you see why it&#39;s so important for them to<br/>
understand that talking to strangers is a big no-no.<br/>
W1: Yes, I do. But if they were with you, they could<br/>
get to meet interesting people and still be safe.<br/>
They&#39;d get a taste of the real world, in real<br/>
settings. They&#39;d also get a real feel for how to tell<br/>
when a situation is dangerous or suspicious.<br/>
W2: They&#39;ll get that in the third and fifth grades in<br/>
their health courses.<br/>
W1: Well, I can tell you&#39;re a very caring mom. Let me<br/>
give you my number--if you ever want to talk, give me<br/>
call. It was good to meet you.<br/>

Subject: Re: [Unschooling-dotcom] School mentality<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I have to share with you folks something that happened<br/>
&gt; over the past few days on another yahoo list I belong<br/>
&gt; to (organic gardening).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone mentioned they were starting a community<br/>
&gt; learning center, and I had just read an article about<br/>
&gt; on in Pennsylvania, so I posted information and the<br/>
&gt; link to their site. Nothing else, just stated I was<br/>
&gt; happy to meet another homeschooler, and asked how old<br/>
&gt; her children were, real innocuous stuff....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Someone else on the group posted a scathing letter<br/>
&gt; about how ridiculous homeschooling is, and her bottom<br/>
&gt; line was that children have to learn to toe the line,<br/>
&gt; submit to authority, and people like me who think<br/>
&gt; their children don&#39;t have to follow the rules are<br/>
&gt; ruining their children, etc., etc.  .... oh, and of<br/>
&gt; course the socialization thing :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wow! You know, I&#39;ve talked to lots of people who were<br/>
&gt; unaware of the insufficiencies of the school system (I<br/>
&gt; used to be one of them), but I never really thought<br/>
&gt; about people who KNEW that compulsory schooling serves<br/>
&gt; to indoctrinate children into a life of obedience and<br/>
&gt; &quot;toeing the line&quot; and actually WANT that for their<br/>
&gt; children!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Well, a million things went through my mind about how<br/>
&gt; to respond to this person, but I really don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; that an organic gardening list is the appropriate<br/>
&gt; place for it. So I told her I thought that it&#39;s ok for<br/>
&gt; some people to send their children to public schools<br/>
&gt; and some people to homeschool their children. I told<br/>
&gt; her that I agree that both produce a different result,<br/>
&gt; and that I&#39;m quite sure which result I want for my<br/>
&gt; children.  I also told her I&#39;d be glad to discuss it<br/>
&gt; further off-list, but she hasn&#39;t responded to that<br/>
&gt; invitation yet.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m afraid this was my first contact with a rabid<br/>
&gt; anti-homeschooler.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyone else met up with the likes of that?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
