<div id="ygrps-yiv-238677778"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Mine have to do their chores or they will have privileges taken away. Failure<br/>
&gt; to do that can also be grounds to contract the work out to other siblings and<br/>
&gt; they would have to pay them out of their allowance. I learn that one from the<br/>
&gt; famiy at timberdoddle.<br/>
&gt; They have a chore list or a set of things that they must do everyday.<br/>
&gt; We cannot afford for someone to slack off and not pull their weight around<br/>
&gt; here.<br/>
&gt; There are 9 people in this house and will be 10 in August.<br/>
&gt; What they fail not to do affects others in the house.<br/>
&gt; Energy does not flow right when things are cluttered.<br/>
&gt; Besides, I feel that it would be unfair for my hubby to come home and do<br/>
&gt; their jobs after he has been away for 6 days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Phrases like &quot;contract the work out to other siblings&quot; (not to mention &quot;they<br/>
will have privileges taken away&quot;) would seriously interrupt the energy flow<br/>
around here. Not to mention cause indigestion.<br/>
<br/>
What happens if you don&#39;t do whatever your jobs are? What privileges do you<br/>
lose?<br/>
