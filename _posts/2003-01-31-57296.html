<div id="ygrps-yiv-1821720691">&quot;If you asked me should people be studying physics, or chemistry or biology <br/>
or geology in high school, I would say it doesn&#39;t make the slightest bit of <br/>
difference. They should study some topics, of course, but the choice is wide <br/>
open â€” I&#39;m interested in depth, not breadth. I&#39;m not talking about college <br/>
education; I&#39;m just taking on K to 12. What I want when kids get through a K <br/>
to 12 education is for them to have a sense of what their society thinks is <br/>
true, beautiful and good; false, ugly and evil; how to think about it and how <br/>
to act on the basis of your thoughts.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-520151523">&lt;&lt; Anyway, my question is which book would you recommend to read first? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Frames of Mind is the one I read, but you don&#39;t really have to get that.  You <br/>
can find lots of discussions and descriptions of the eight (or nine) <br/>
intelligences online with google.  Some are geared toward educators, some toward <br/>
personnel managers, some are just general/descriptive.  If you  much prefer books <br/>
to the internet, though, Frames of Mind would be my pick.<br/>
<br/>
I think there are others who have written about his theory later that might <br/>
be easier reads, and others here might know more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I recently read &quot;In Their Own Way:  Encouraging Your Child&#39;s Multiple <br/>
Intelligences&quot; by Thomas Armstrong -- it discusses Gardner&#39;s 8 types of <br/>
intelligence, stresses that everyone possesses each one to different <br/>
degrees, and gives lots of practical suggestions for discovering (and <br/>
helping your child to discover) your child&#39;s particular makeup, and <br/>
gives ways to enhance their learning of everything based upon their <br/>
strengths.  I really liked the way he warned against pigeonholing <br/>
children by thinking of them as only 1 of the types.  The chapter on <br/>
learning disabilities was excellent -- basically, he says that schools <br/>
pathologize what are actually strengths (spatial learners are labelled <br/>
&quot;dyslexic,&quot; etc.) in order to collect government funding for special ed <br/>
programs and because schools are not set up to accommodate those who <br/>
aren&#39;t linguistic or logical/mathematical learners.  He is very <br/>
favorable to homeschooling, and mentions John Holt numerous times, <br/>
although it isn&#39;t a homeschooling book, per se.<br/>
