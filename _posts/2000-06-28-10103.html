What does institutionalizing our elders have to do with unschooling? How far<br/>
should we stray from the focus of this email list?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
IMHO, the discussion on institutionalizing our elders has everything, AND<br/>
nothing to do with unschooling.  There is no issue, IMO, that outranks<br/>
another.  Relevance of an issue depends on one&#39;s perspective.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, my dd(almost 5), out of the blue decided she needed to learn<br/>
how to tie her own shoes, Daddy showed her a couple of times, she<br/>
practiced - didn&#39;t quite get it, put it down for another day.  Today, she<br/>
picks up one of her baby shoes, and viola - she is now a shoe-tying expert.<br/>
What does this have to do with unschooling, nothing and everything all in<br/>
one.<br/>

Everything is related.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078323219">I guess I should have asked what the discussion of the institutionalization<br/>
of the elderly had to do with an unschooling list. I understand that as the<br/>
world around us is our teacher, everything is unschooling. But should this<br/>
list be for the discussion of anything? I can see discussing the elderly by<br/>
relating a story that was a learning experience or by giving resources for<br/>
learning about the plights of the elderly. But is that the same as just<br/>
carrying on a general discussion of the topic. If so, the list will lose<br/>
many lurks who simply tire of the volume of mail if there is little<br/>
substance in the posts directly related to unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Geez, institutionalization of the elderly .... social history,<br/>
humanities studies, gerontology, ethics studies, sociology, anthropology<br/>
... <br/>
Gee pick where it could be applied to and integrate it with an older<br/>
child&#39;s interests in the world at large. Not everybody is unschooling<br/>
the under 10 set.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps families are considering how they are going to accommodate the<br/>
elderly in their immediate family and this thread becomes food for<br/>
thought in their debate over what is right for their elderly family<br/>
member.<br/>
This type of family decision would colour their daily lives and affect<br/>
the atmosphere of the home etc and perhaps their unschooling efforts.<br/>
<br/>
Now do you understand how some people consider all topics as acceptable<br/>
on a list such as this.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps you understand the general mindset of a list like this.<br/>
