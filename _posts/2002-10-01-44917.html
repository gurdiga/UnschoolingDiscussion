Are you familiar with the number one Contemporary Christian recording <br/>
artist from Austrailia (sp?), Rebecca St. James?  She was <br/>
homeschooled.  Her music is very good cross over from Christian to <br/>
pop or country (contemporary).  <br/>
<br/>
Also, get John Holt&#39;s &quot;How Children Learn.&quot;  And Alphie <br/>
Cohn&#39;s &quot;Punished By Rewards.&quot;  These books can be shared with your <br/>
husband and therapist.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, the best thing to do with others outside of your group(s) <br/>
is to not discuss the unschooling style.  People simply don&#39;t <br/>
understand it.  Even other homeschoolers. Their comments may only <br/>
serve to hurt you and you may never &#39;enlighten&#39; them; besides that is <br/>
not your job anyway.  You have kids to raise and educate so how aunt <br/>
gladys feels about your homeschooling style is not a priority (unless <br/>
she tries to cause you harm by calling social services).  In this <br/>
case, the least told to her, the better.  Not that you are hiding <br/>
anything; you simply have other things better to do.  And in some <br/>
locales, social services simply discriminates against homeschoolers, <br/>
especially unschoolers.<br/>
 <br/>
A simple statement such as, &quot;My children are gifted and to meet their <br/>
intellectual and emotional needs appropriately, we are enrolling them <br/>
into a private school for gifted kids.&quot;  Then enroll them in a cover <br/>
school via the internet.  There are several available with different <br/>
styles and philosophies.  My cover school is Progressive Network <br/>
Academy and this school was created for my daughter and other kids <br/>
who deserve a better, more efficient education.  It may not be right <br/>
for you, especially if your husband is conservative philosophically.<br/>
See it at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.orgsites.com/nc/progressivenetworkacademy">http://www.orgsites.com/nc/progressivenetworkacademy</a> <br/>
There are many other cover schools and they all have their own <br/>
philosophies.  So, researching several would be best and it would <br/>
enable you to find what best suits your family.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps..<br/>
<br/>
Please make sure your therapist reads the Holt book just in case she <br/>
is talking to social services.  Especially if your children have been <br/>
labeled with any sort of disablilty even if unrelated to the school <br/>
issue as these cases tend to send more intervention by the social <br/>
services agencies (in my own research and experience).<br/>
<br/>
You are doing the right thing.  Your boys are blessed to have a <br/>
compassionate mother-advocate like yourself.  You do understand their <br/>
true nature as young learners; keep it up and be persistant.  Do not <br/>
back down, but tread gently and safely with support from your groups. <br/>
<br/>
And groups like this are a Godsend!<br/>
<br/>
Love, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785156872">Thankyou Marji, Sheree, Nancy, Rachel Ann, Myranda, Sandra, Todd, Betsy,<br/>
Deborah & Mary (and any others I haven&#39;t seen)<br/>
<br/>
It was great to get all of your ideas. Yes Todd it did/does feel a lot<br/>
better knowing I have you all to write to.<br/>
<br/>
A few of you pointed out how important it is that husband and counsellor<br/>
learn a lot more about unschooling before we can discuss it seriously.<br/>
I agree absolutely and I tried to make the point in the session but it<br/>
was dismissed. I like the way you have all said it and I&#39;m printing out<br/>
your words so I can practice the phrases to myself so I can say them<br/>
calmly and rationally.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the counsellor is interested in reading about unschooling<br/>
because if I understood her correctly she wants to avoid the details of<br/>
our decisions - just wants to stick with the interpersonal relationship<br/>
of dh & I.  I think the reason she asked me how I would feel about<br/>
compromise instead of first asking dh whether he would compromise about<br/>
learning more about unschooling, was possibly just for balance (putting<br/>
ideas to each of us equally) or possibly because we are keen to not get<br/>
into a situation of appearing to ask dh to change because that was his<br/>
problem with earlier counselling.  It was unfortunate that the<br/>
counsellor insisted on sticking with the question as she first put it<br/>
instead of taking a different angle or moving on to another issue, or<br/>
going back to helping us learn strategies to deal with issues with each<br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
After months (years really) of asking my dh to read some of the articles<br/>
I&#39;ve collected over the years so that we can actually discuss the issue<br/>
properly - I really don&#39;t think he is going to read anything.  However,<br/>
it would probably only be fair to prepare a list of the most relevant<br/>
reading items to give to them.  I&#39;ll have to look at them all again - it<br/>
isn&#39;t easy because I have five folders&#39; worth, and whenever I start to<br/>
consider I begin to think that it would be easier if I could identify<br/>
the particular issues that bother the other person (which are not<br/>
necessarily the same as my own objectives).  If I do put the list<br/>
together I might try to find a website to place the list for others&#39; to<br/>
use if it is needed.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra you wrote &quot;I&#39;m guessing the counsellor was really trying to get<br/>
to what they dynamics are between the husband and wife about the issue<br/>
of the kids.&quot;  I think there may be something in this.  If that was her<br/>
objective she wasn&#39;t going about it very well because her insistence on<br/>
repeating the same question that I had already stated could not be<br/>
answered without being clarified and/or changed led to me feeling<br/>
attacked and defensive - feelings which she identified but misapplied to<br/>
being related to our parental dynamic instead of the counsellor/client<br/>
dynamic.  In fact dh mentioned later that he had been surprised because<br/>
the angle being taken did appear to be ganging up, but that he could<br/>
guess what she was really trying to get to.  <br/>
<br/>
It will be interesting to see what direction we take on Friday. Nancy,<br/>
we see the counsellor together.  I am not averse to finding a new<br/>
counsellor if necessary (having been prepared to look hard to find<br/>
someone that dh would be comfortable with) but the expense has me<br/>
thinking that dh will be reluctant to try any others.<br/>
<br/>
Sheree suggested an umbrella programme - this has also been suggested by<br/>
a different friend to placate my dh&#39;s conservatism.  I&#39;ve tried several<br/>
times (gently) to initiate structured activities but the oldest just<br/>
doesn&#39;t like them and I am extremely uncomfortable attempting to insist.<br/>
The youngest is only 4 and hasn&#39;t shown any interest in bookwork.  My<br/>
philosophy is that the boys learn best from their chosen activities -<br/>
from engaging in their world and finding answers to their own questions<br/>
(which doesn&#39;t stop them also learning from me and others who tell them<br/>
things as they become relevant and include them in our activities).  I<br/>
can&#39;t see that philosophy meshing with setting a program before the boys<br/>
and urging them to complete this or that because someone out there<br/>
thinks it is good for them to know, with the threat hanging over us that<br/>
if they don&#39;t complete the work then we&#39;re failing at homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about asking your husband if he would be more willing to see more <br/>
*concrete* proof of the results of your unschooling? I assume your dh is away <br/>
at work most of the time? What if you kept a scrapbook of things, ticket <br/>
stubs, photos of places and things you do and see, copies of your children&#39;s <br/>
writing... I know you are in Australia, but some of the states here require a <br/>
portfolio of some sort as documentation. How would you feel about giving your <br/>
dh that documentation in scrapbook form?<br/>
 <br/>
Talk to your kids about maybe making an effort to put out more *stuff* Ask <br/>
them to draw more pictures of what they are doing so you can put these up <br/>
around the house. Ask them if they would be interested in writing down some <br/>
of their adventures. I am not talking about making them or asking them to do <br/>
more schoolish type work or book work, just more of an effort to show what <br/>
goes on during the day. Does your dh see the proof of your days? Maybe he <br/>
needs to see that to feel more comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
Also, is the word unschooling getting in the way? (it does tend to have a <br/>
negative connotation to those who don&#39;t understand what it means) Maybe, stop <br/>
using the word unschooling with your husband? Just call it homeschooling. You <br/>
will still know what you mean, he thinks better of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455146592">What about writing out a daily log of educational activities?  Make <br/>
the unschooling look like school.  Make lists of subjects covered.  <br/>
Legos are math manipulatives.  Drawing pictures is art. Making mud <br/>
pies in the back yard is science.  If they ask you why people brush <br/>
their teeth, that&#39;s health.  Run errands around town, that&#39;s social <br/>
studies.  If you read a story together, that&#39;s language arts <br/>
(reading) as well as whatever subjects the book covers. AAnd don&#39;t <br/>
forget to write down the educational content of the tv programs they <br/>
watch!  <br/>
<br/>
Tell your dh that you will cover all of the academic subjects and <br/>
then take a half our each night to write down what your children did <br/>
in each subject.  Be creative and open minded about what fits under <br/>
each &quot;subject&quot;.  Make it sound like school.  <br/>
<br/>
Just an idea...<br/>
