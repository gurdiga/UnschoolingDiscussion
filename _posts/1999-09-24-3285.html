<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081796016">Hi, just some thoughts based on my own experience.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 19 I moved about 4 hours away from my family.  I had never been<br/>
away from them or my lifelong friends.  Besides have a great time, I found<br/>
out that I was a person of worth.  My self esteem went way through the roof<br/>
just by finding out how self sufficient I could be, but more so how easy it<br/>
was to make friends.  Not friends who went to school or church with me, or<br/>
friends of my sisters, or kids of friends of my parents...know what I mean?<br/>
It was really great for my ego.<br/>
<br/>
So, I agree with your instincts, tell him to go for it.  By the way, I was a<br/>
waitress at that time too, it&#39;s a great job for anywhere in the world but<br/>
you do become part of that whole restaraunt/bar subculture.  Hope he has<br/>
fun!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; maybe when i&#39;m old, seems like older people don&#39;t need as much sleep<br/>
or<br/>
&gt; &gt;  rhtey just have insomnia. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Deborah,<br/>
&gt; &gt;      LOL   When we are old, you will probably be able to finally stay up<br/>
&gt; &gt; late, and then your husband and the rest of us will be the ones falling<br/>
&gt; &gt; asleep early!  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;My 20-year old son is *totally* unmotivated about anything in life,<br/>
&gt; &gt;especially things which involve responsibility. ...he mentioned that he<br/>
&gt; wants to move to another part of the<br/>
&gt; &gt;country. I said, &quot;Go for it!&quot; My instinct immediately told me that would<br/>
&gt; &gt;be a good thing for him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I&#39;m going to encourage him to go! He needs a wake-up call to life.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Denise<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Good for you!  It is refreshing to hear about someone with a son whom they<br/>
&gt; encourage to be independent.  In my family the boys were SOOOOOO spoiled.<br/>
&gt; My brother (27) lives with my parents still (along with his wife and two<br/>
&gt; children) because he does not know what he wants to be when he grows up<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; does not make enough money right now to support his family.  I keep<br/>
telling<br/>
&gt; them that he needs to get a different job and move away (far away) from<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; parents so he can learn how to be responsible for himself and be truly &quot;on<br/>
&gt; his own.&quot;  His wife could not agree more.  She is in school full time, has<br/>
&gt; finished her degree and has another year to complete her certification to<br/>
&gt; teach High School.  She is absolutely sick to death of being nagged and<br/>
&gt; &quot;mothered&quot; by my/his mom, who is definately the intrusive type.  I think<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; would live there happily forever if nobody pushes him.  Getting meals<br/>
&gt; cooked for him most days no matter WHAT his varying schedule might be,<br/>
&gt; having free babysitters any night of the week, Not worrying about bills or<br/>
&gt; house maintenance, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I was 17 at HS graduation.  Went to college (bc my parents thought I<br/>
should), had a blast, got A&#39;s & B&#39;s in what  liked, withdrew from classes<br/>
I didn&#39;t like.  Summer after first year of college met 2 High School<br/>
friends in Kodiak AK, the plan was to earn LOTS of $$ for college (of<br/>
course).  I Loved it & stayed nine years.  Some of what I did: babysat<br/>
for room and board, worked in canneries in town & in remote area, lied<br/>
about my age to work in pizza parlor that served beer, lied that I had<br/>
experience as a waitress to get first waitress job, took care of elderly<br/>
woman for room and board, didn&#39;t work sometimes until I ran out of money,<br/>
hiked, camped, caught salmon with my bare hands, marvelled at the<br/>
absolute beauty of Alaska, worked for the forest service, lived without<br/>
running water or electricity, played games on long winter evenings<br/>
without electricity, took a side trip to Hawaii for 3 months & lived in a<br/>
tent while waiting tables (which by now I really did have experience at),<br/>
then got a job at a small health food store & decided to get a degree in<br/>
nutrition.  (Which to some people meant I finally came to my senses and<br/>
was getting back to &quot;real life&quot;.) <br/>
