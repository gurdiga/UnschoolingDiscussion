<div id="ygrps-yiv-582724271"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Oooooh... this struck a chord of memory.  When I was around that age, my<br/>
&gt; mom says I started all my sentences with &quot;yeah-but&quot;.  (Pronounced with a<br/>
&gt; soft &quot;yeah&quot; and a very loud &quot;but&quot;, with no pause between the two words<br/>
&gt; at all.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As my husband says, &quot;Yeah, but...is that anything like a raaaabbit? :)<br/>
