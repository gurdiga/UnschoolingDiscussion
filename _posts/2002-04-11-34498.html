<div id="ygrps-yiv-1742792383">Just thinking about a discussion on a Green political list. Someone said <br/>
that left and right in politics are just different ways of acheiving the <br/>
same end (improvement of conditions for people), while Green politics is <br/>
about something else altogether - it&#39;s about caring for the earth, <br/>
(which of course includes people as well). So Green politics is actually <br/>
neither left nor right, which is a little confusing for those who have <br/>
grown up thinking that all political ideas have to fall somewhere on the <br/>
left - right continuum.<br/>
<br/>
So when we ask this about unschooling&#39;s place in homeschooling.....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Where exactly is the line <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;between unschooling and not unschooling?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Bridget<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think it&#39;s more than just a line, even for people who are on there <br/>
&gt;way there, and pretty darn close.  To me is was more like a canyon! ;-<br/>
&gt;)<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t get it, until I took the leap.<br/>
&gt;I think there is a lot of fear when it comes to being responsible for <br/>
&gt;our childrens education, and it can take a lot to overcome it.<br/>
&gt;Unschooling to me, is when you overcome it, and trust.<br/>
&gt;It&#39;s also, seeing learning for the joy, not the &quot;what if&#39;s&quot; <br/>
&gt;and &quot;needs to&#39;s&quot;<br/>
&gt;Joanna<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>....... perhaps unschooling too, could be described as somewhere else <br/>
altogether. Not on the school-at-home - eclectic - do nothing continuum, <br/>
all aiming for the child to &#39;end up&#39; &#39;successfully educated&#39;, but <br/>
rather, unschooling is in a different place altogether, aiming for the <br/>
child to &#39;continue being&#39; &#39;successfully who they are&#39;.<br/>
