&lt;&lt; To me, it&#39;s more of an <br/>
<br/>
interest in the culture of schools, and how it affects the people caught <br/>
<br/>
up in it. I look at homeschoolers, esp. unschoolers, and think how great <br/>
<br/>
it is. Then I look at public schools, and think, there must be a better <br/>
<br/>
way. But while we can, one family at a time, step away from the schools, <br/>
<br/>
how does an entire culture step away? What about all those kids there? <br/>
<br/>
But then, I guess my interest in, concern for, the schools and who&#39;s in <br/>
<br/>
them really isn&#39;t part of unschooling. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Many unschooling parents are former teachers who have dedicated a chunk of <br/>
lives to making it better.  When I quit teaching, I couldn&#39;t even stand to <br/>
watch TV reports about the sad state of the schools.  If Time or Newsweek had <br/>
an article on how bad the schools were, I wouldn&#39;t even open to that page.  <br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s a better way, it&#39;s probably been tried and failed in the midst of <br/>
school realities.  There are lists and sites to discuss that, and they might <br/>
really welcome unschoolers&#39; points of views EXCEPT that they can&#39;t implement <br/>
much freedom into such a behemoth.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt was a school reformer.  There were lots of influential school <br/>
reformers in the 1960&#39;s and 70&#39;s, and attempts were made then to institute <br/>
&quot;open classroom&quot; methods, but in public schools they fail to work.  That was <br/>
proven repeatedly and at great expense.  That&#39;s what caused  many parents to <br/>
take their kids out of school and for John Holt to write &quot;Teach Your Own,&quot; <br/>
and to found Growing Without Schooling magazine.   (Then a few years later <br/>
fundamentalist Christians somehow imagined they had invented homeschooling.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also, if you can&#39;t unschool in your state, <br/>
<br/>
then what? A few times I saw moving suggested. I do think this is an <br/>
<br/>
important issue --- why should someone in a country supposedly about <br/>
<br/>
freedom and the individual have to move?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pennsylvania has more laws than I can BELIEVE would be allowed in the United <br/>
States.  But maybe it&#39;s a good civics/poli-sci lesson that freedoms in the <br/>
U.S. seem to be greater in newer and smaller states.   Laws seem to be <br/>
created when people are thick together, or when they&#39;ve been there a long <br/>
time.   <br/>
<br/>
Also, something not often glorified:  The original colonies were NOT set up <br/>
according to what is not seen as inalienable rights.  Some of them were very <br/>
repressive.  And the creation of the U.S. didn&#39;t totally cut off their <br/>
traditions of repression. <br/>
<br/>
But one thing they didn&#39;t change is that American citizens can move freely <br/>
from one state to another without telling anybody they&#39;re gone.   So if <br/>
living in New Mexico means I have to see people wearing guns or having guns <br/>
in their pickups and I don&#39;t WANT to see that, I can move.  If living in <br/>
Texas means you have to see people wearing Texas jewelry and eating grits and <br/>
you can&#39;t stand that, you can move north or west to the green chile zone.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;There is something seriously <br/>
<br/>
wrong if the government is telling us how to raise our children, and <br/>
<br/>
even if we don&#39;t live in that state, I do think it is everyone&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
concern.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Compulsory attendance laws are old.  We can&#39;t roll back that far; all those <br/>
who voted for them are dead.  (Except those who lately extended them to 18 or <br/>
back to five or six, in some states.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;Another state could look at that and think it&#39;s a good idea, or <br/>
<br/>
no one objects, or any other excuse to further curb our freedoms.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>States don&#39;t like the federal government telling them what to do (unless <br/>
there are big bucks attached to compliance), so they absolutely won&#39;t want <br/>
people in other states telling them what to do.    I think people have enough <br/>
problems in their own states and with their own kids without trying to reform <br/>
schools or homeschooling laws in other states.  <br/>
<br/>
But people have found practical, workable ways to comply with Pennsylvania <br/>
laws, and so those would be the people to ask.<br/>

here is under a delusion.  Yes, it can be done and I do it.  But one <br/>
change of personnel in my school district could change that.  One <br/>
shift in the superintendent&#39;s attitude could change that.  A <br/>
superintendent could wake up on the wrong side of the bed one morning <br/>
and decide to make life miserable for homeschoolers--and do it.  He <br/>
has that much power. Superintendents ask for things above and beyond <br/>
the law all the time, and get away with it.  So any homeschooler in <br/>
PA who brags about how easy they have it is really just bragging that <br/>
the superintendent of their local school district is a somewhat <br/>
decent person who cooperates with homeschoolers enough to not hassle <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
Again, my point is not that we should change anything about the way <br/>
we unschool in order to comply with a law.  However, just like <br/>
someone might say, &quot;Ugh, my mother in law is coming for a visit and <br/>
she is going to make unschooling difficult for us for a few weeks&quot;, <br/>
someone from PA might say, &quot;Ugh, my superintendent just called and <br/>
said that he doesn&#39;t think my portfolio shows that my son has had an <br/>
appropriate 4th grade education&quot;.  There are practical suggestions <br/>
for getting the mother in law off someone&#39;s back and there are <br/>
practical suggestions for getting a superintendent off someone&#39;s <br/>
back.  In neither situation should a person stop unschooling, they <br/>
should just find a way to get the problem people off of their backs <br/>
so that they CAN unschool. <br/>
