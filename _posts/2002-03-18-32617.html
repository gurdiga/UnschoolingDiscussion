<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890549550">We can&#39;t and don&#39;t have the right to change anyone but ourselves. :-)<br/>
HA! I have a story.<br/>
Yesterday, Joe had on his cargo pants (khaki colored). we were going out to<br/>
the CSA farm to see the new chicks and my herbs. I started looking for mine,<br/>
(green not khaki) because they are my &quot;farm pants&quot; I ALWAYS wear them out<br/>
htere &#39;cause I don&#39;t mind them getting so dirty.<br/>
Now Joe HATES to wear similar clothes. I don&#39;t know, maybe it emasculates<br/>
him, whatever. He&#39;s afraid we&#39;ll wind up likke the retired couples we see on<br/>
their huge motor cycles with matching leathers and helmets  that are linked<br/>
by an intercom. So he says to me could you wear something different?, I<br/>
thought about it and wanted to wear them and since I don&#39;t care if we look<br/>
similar I thought it should be up to him to change his pants. So I told him<br/>
that.<br/>
Joe, if you have a problem with something, don&#39;t ask ME to change to fix<br/>
YOUR problem.<br/>
BIG FIGHT.<br/>
His response was &quot;If you really loved me, you&#39;d change.&quot;<br/>
Now I can laugh about that. (AFTER it was talked over.)<br/>
