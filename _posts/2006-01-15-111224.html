<div id="ygrps-yiv-962709506">Currently, I am catching up on my emails as I rarely get the <br/>
opportunity lately!  Before that, I was quilting.  My dh helped me <br/>
grocery shop today, took our 13yo, 15yo and a friend of theirs <br/>
to &quot;Scary movie night&quot; being hosted by some of our cousins.  Dh has <br/>
also spent some time today removing a windsheild from one of our <br/>
vehicles in hopes that tomorrow will be warm enough to glue a <br/>
different windshield on a car that will need to pass inspection <br/>
soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Dd, 15yo is currently at the aboved mentioned party, but spent her <br/>
day online, reading (Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants)and watching <br/>
cartoons and music videos.  She is also relishing some of the last <br/>
hours spent with a girlfriend that has been visiting this past week <br/>
from across the state.  This girlfriend is 16yo, got pissed at some <br/>
girls bullying her in school last year, walked out and never <br/>
returned.  She already has her GED and plans to start college in the <br/>
fall.  Thus, she is currently available to visit with us for long <br/>
periods of time, as long as we agree to meet her mom at a halfway <br/>
point 3 hours away!  <br/>
<br/>
My 13yo loves to play with and babysit my grandson, so she spent time <br/>
with him today as well as watching videos and cartoons and getting <br/>
ready for the party tonight (she primps more than the 15yo).  Oh!  <br/>
And my 23yo who is still home and the mom of the aforementioned <br/>
grandson, she hurt her neck early this morning, so by afternoon was <br/>
asking me to take her to the emergency room.  She got some great <br/>
drugs into her system (she felt much better) and offered to make <br/>
supper.  She also fussed and cussed at her fiance&#39; over a round of <br/>
Mario Cart while I bathed my grandbaby for her.  He is so CUTE!<br/>
<br/>
Well, this went all over the map, but life is hectic, and I love it!<br/>
