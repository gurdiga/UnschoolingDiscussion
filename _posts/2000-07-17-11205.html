<div id="ygrps-yiv-946774464">I have heard in from others in other states who fall<br/>
into the public schooling homeschooling programs that<br/>
eventually they end up get your kids back in PS. One<br/>
way that they do it is by their psych testing. They<br/>
beging to diagnose the HSers with ADD and then say<br/>
that they need to be in ps where the psychs. can help<br/>
them and help medicate the kids. I am sure there are<br/>
other ways they do this but this is the most common I<br/>
have heard of. Also the ps gets a certain amount of<br/>
money from the govn&#39;t for the hsers who are using<br/>
their curriculum and facilities. So even though you<br/>
are hsing the school still benefits off you as a<br/>
hs&#39;er. I personally don&#39;t like this idea. If I wanted<br/>
to support ps I would enroll my children in ps. <br/>

&gt; Hey guys -- cut it out!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would just delete all of you, but there is another<br/>
&gt; thread I am reading <br/>
&gt; called Definitions and it is really good.  All about<br/>
&gt; identifiying kids for <br/>
&gt; g/t programs and how some school distrcts are<br/>
&gt; interfacing with and reaching <br/>
&gt; out to hsers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That one I am actually learning something from.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I delete all the emails called Definitions I will<br/>
&gt; lose that thread.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Time to move on -- my vote!  (You didn&#39;t even know I<br/>
&gt; got a vote, did ya?!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What does anyone here know about this &quot;reaching out&quot;<br/>
&gt; of the school districts <br/>
&gt; to hsers.  Obviously, they are getting their $$ back<br/>
&gt; if I bring my kid back <br/>
&gt; but I am looking at one now (Wichita) that looks<br/>
&gt; like they are actually <br/>
&gt; trying to be relatively hands off.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any personal experiences with any of these blended<br/>
&gt; programs?<br/>

LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean -- we recently checked into a new charter school opening <br/>
by us.  Aside from answering yes to every single question I could think of <br/>
(which made me completely suspicious), the main interest seemed to be in how <br/>
many hours I could volunteer!<br/>
<br/>
But, otoh, if something might help my kids I want to know about it.  Heck, I <br/>
want to know about it anyway.  That&#39;s why I went to the charter school <br/>
meeting.  I&#39;m just plain nosey!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

charter school in our community is almost souly run by parents. I&#39;m not<br/>
saying that this is the case with you or not (for I don&#39;t know you) but I<br/>
personally would want to be that closely involved in my child&#39;s education<br/>
should it not be coming from home. When my daughter was in school, I was<br/>
there constantly.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I understand.  It was just the balance of things that upset me.  I went in <br/>
very hard -- to the point -- this is what I have, what I want, can you do it? <br/>
 Yes.  To everything and anything.  They had not yet reached the headcount <br/>
they needed.  The last day for signing kids up and when they must have X kids <br/>
to stay open is tomorrow.  I have not heard back on my last set of questions. <br/>
 I think if they really wanted me and mine the prin would have gotten back to <br/>
me with more info.  And I think that they made their headcount.  My 2 are no <br/>
longer so vital.  And I am a big pain.  A difficult customer.  So they let it <br/>
slide.  Easier.  That&#39;s just my take.  But, I get how they need/depend on <br/>
volunteers and I would want to be there too -- I just felt like the volunteer <br/>
thing was part of an overall snow job.<br/>
<br/>
Just my take.<br/>
