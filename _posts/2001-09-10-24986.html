&gt; homeschooling my 11 year old son this year. His mother is a Waldorf <br/>
&gt; School teacher, and he&#39;s been in the school since Kindergarten. His <br/>
&gt; class no longer has a teacher, so I am pursuing my ideal of <br/>
&gt; homeschooling. His mother is stuck on the Waldorf thing, and I value a <br/>
&gt; lot of what it has given to him. But I&#39;m curious about the unschooling <br/>
&gt; concept. Does anyone out there have any experience with Waldorf <br/>
&gt; Education, and the comparison between the two approaches?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Welcome Mark:<br/>
<br/>
I just took Zak out of Waldorf.  He was only there 5 days.  The things I <br/>
liked about the Waldorf is that they are gentle spirits, it&#39;s very &quot;granola&quot;, <br/>
lots of love and attention and affection., only 10 in Zak&#39;s class with 2 <br/>
teachers.  The things are don&#39;t like about Waldorf are the same as I don&#39;t <br/>
like about any school.  (1) It&#39;s not a real environment - kids together of <br/>
the same age.  (2) Teacher driven not child led - Zak didn&#39;t get to determine <br/>
when he played outside, it was determined by the teacher.  (3) Control - lots <br/>
of control in Waldorf, although they don&#39;t appear to be that way.  Example.  <br/>
Zak would not each salad for a snack or soup for a snack so I packed him a <br/>
Health Valley Tart Bar and explained to the teacher that I didn&#39;t want him <br/>
going hungry.  At the end of the day she gave it back to me and said &quot;we <br/>
couldn&#39;t give it to him because then everyone would want to do this&quot;... My <br/>
response was &quot;so what let them?&quot; she said &quot;well then we would have chaos over <br/>
eating&quot;... I said &quot;maybe you&#39;d learn something from the children about what <br/>
they really want to eat and when rather than on your schedule. I insist that <br/>
Zak has the opportunity to eat something else&quot;.... She said &quot;I&#39;ll have to <br/>
talk about it with my peers, but I don&#39;t think we can do that&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I actually think the above scenario was the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back <br/>
about putting him in any kind of school and bringing him home.  I suddenly <br/>
realized that it was all about adults having control over children, just <br/>
because they were bigger and thought that the adult ideas were better than <br/>
the kids could come up with.<br/>
<br/>
Plus it would have cost $600 a month.  We are taking that $600 and bought a <br/>
playsystem for our backgarden for the kids for $3500.  So in a few months <br/>
we&#39;ll have something that will last them all their childhood and not scar <br/>
them as opposed to paying for something to potentially do them harm (the <br/>
being in school).<br/>
<br/>
As for convincing your ex... I wouldn&#39;t bother... that&#39;s the reason she&#39;s <br/>
your ex... Just start doing the unschooling thing (if that&#39;s the way you want <br/>
to go) and once she sees the rewards maybe she&#39;ll come around.<br/>
<br/>
Read as much as you can as well... I just finished reading Linda Dobson&#39;s The <br/>
First Year of Homeschooling and it was a wonderful help to me and my husband. <br/>
 Good luck.<br/>
