&lt;&lt; Hey!  Hasn&#39;t anyone but Pris been reading my thread on adoption?  We are <br/>
ecstatic about it.  I don&#39;t think we could get any &quot;Happier&quot; or be more <br/>
excited about what will happen on Monday and whether this one will be the one.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I have been, Nanci!  Congratulations!!!  We adopted our oldest son who <br/>
will be 6 in Sept.  Our circumstance was different in that we went through <br/>
the pregnancy with the birth mom, and were in the delivery room.  But, we <br/>
still had to go through the preliminary workup: the  home study, meeting with <br/>
the lawyer, etc...In our neck of the woods, we had to wait 1 yr before <br/>
finalizing the adoption, even though our son was with us from day 1.  He did <br/>
not have to go to foster care or anything like that, but instead, came home <br/>
from the hospital with us, which was beyond great!  After a year, we went to <br/>
the juvenile court, and became finalized and permanently legalized adoptive <br/>
parents!  Then we had a reception!  It was a great event!  Best of luck to <br/>
you!  I know you must be SO excited!!!  I wouldn&#39;t mind adopting again one <br/>
day down the road... we&#39;ll see!  :)  ~Karen</div>

                     No one, no body, no powers that be<br/>
