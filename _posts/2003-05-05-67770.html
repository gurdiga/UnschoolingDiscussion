<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377365392">hours, that&#39;s what I&#39;ve spent at this computer today, and in the past <br/>
few days. It feels like a complete waste of time, and I&#39;m so thankful <br/>
that my kids have each other to play with and interact with, <br/>
because...I have been mostly ignoring them.<br/>
<br/>
Do I just go with this flow, and let myself burn out on <br/>
computerizing? do I go on hiatus and get away from it? Computer isn&#39;t <br/>
the only thing i did today: laundry, bread baking, cookie making <br/>
(w/Katie), vacuuming, reading, teaching our neighbor&#39;s dog to sit, <br/>
making breakfast...whoop-de-doo...<br/>
<br/>
but in between these other things, every time, I&#39;d beeline to the <br/>
computer. Discussion boards (this and one other, predominantly) and a <br/>
few blogs, more than information gathering or games or anything. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not happy with this, but it&#39;s like that&#39;s all I really want to <br/>
do. My hubby doesn&#39;t like me spending this much time online, but... <br/>
but... but... <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-802889770">Heidi, I&#39;ve been doing exactly the same things. &lt;g&gt;  Moms and Dads have to<br/>
de-school, too, and I think it is just part of the process.  The kids used<br/>
to make themselves scarce at &quot;school&quot; time..poor things.. they hated it..in<br/>
the end, I was doing all the school-work, just so we would have something to<br/>
show anyone that asked. I felt so ridiculous as it&#39;s not even required! <br/>
Finally I just quit, and went to un-schooling.com and looked at the message<br/>
board, articles, etc.  It has been such a weight lifted.  I do get antsy<br/>
sometimes, but then I just come here and it&#39;s all better.  &lt;bg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1829313438">Funny, I was just *justifying* our unschooling to a family member the other <br/>
night.  We&#39;ve got waaaaay too many *educators* in the family, they tend to <br/>
take it as a personal affront that I do not choose school for my kids.  I was <br/>
IMing with my pseudo-brother [cousin-I&#39;m an honorary member of his family], <br/>
who lives 5 hours away and sees my kids an average of 2-3 times a year.  1.5 <br/>
years ago, he wanted to be a doctor, so he immediately diagnosed my ds with <br/>
ADHD to which I responded, IF his daddy didn&#39;t die last year and IF he didn&#39;t <br/>
have me for a mom, I may give your advice some credibility... <br/>
So now, he asks &quot;How&#39;s homeschooling?&quot;<br/>
me: homeschooling ROCKS!<br/>
him: Is Hannah doing better with her numbers? <br/>
my instinct: What the *beep* are you talking about, you *beeping* <br/>
*beeeeeeeeep*? <br/>
my mouth: Hannah knows all the math required to be 6.5, though I&#39;m sure she <br/>
doesn&#39;t know enough to withstand grilling by family members.  <br/>
him: just consider us your school board<br/>
me: which is what I&#39;m avoiding by homeschooling, she doesn&#39;t have to answer <br/>
to them, via testing, until fall of 2005<br/>
him: Oh good! I&#39;m glad they hold you accountable.  They need to do something <br/>
about the deadbeat parents who consider themselves homeschoolers.  <br/>
me: Some would consider unschooling *deadbeat parenting* only because they <br/>
don&#39;t understand it<br/>
him: NO, I mean the parent who keeps their kid out of school, not wanting <br/>
outside influences on their child, then doesn&#39;t influence the child himself <br/>
and allows the child to do what they want.  It&#39;s just an excuse to sleep in.  <br/>
<br/>
me: Wow Jare, you just described my goal!! My kids can learn by living... <br/>
as luck would have it, bath time arrived and I had to get off the computer &lt;<br/>
bg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I swear sometimes the only reasons kids learn the crap they do at school is <br/>
to impress relatives!!  *I* don&#39;t go around quizzing small children ~ it&#39;s, <br/>
it&#39;s, it&#39;s icky and rude and pompous and and and... <br/>
<br/>
Whew! thanks for being here guys!  I&#39;m glad I&#39;ve got *some* answers for those <br/>
who cannot *live and let live* <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353440982">WOW!<br/>
Some people just think they can say anything! That was so not nice of him to <br/>
say that to you. <br/>
Sorry you had to deal with that, that is really a HS family needs to hear.<br/>
I have a few anal family members also. They even grill my son when I am not <br/>
around. If people only knew how many of us there are around them.<br/>
<br/>
Any one know of a good Unschooling bumper stick slogan?<br/>

ANYWAY &lt;bg&gt; they&#39;re talking about homeschooling and how boring school is, <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1781302225">Diana,<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand!  My sister in law is a special education <br/>
teacher and very into her career!  She is one of those people who <br/>
thinks that any mention of your choices, children&#39;s actions, etc. are <br/>
somehow requests for her advice.  She drives me batty.  I say &quot;Oh, <br/>
the baby isnt talking yet&quot; in passing converstion, no worries here.  <br/>
And she replies, &quot;Well that is developmentaly <br/>
appropriate..blah..blah..blah.  ARGGGHHHHH!  I KNOW!!  Anyway, we <br/>
have mentioned homeschooling in the past and got the &quot;Just so you <br/>
know...I knew some kids...blah..blah..&quot;  I am not looking forward to <br/>
her passive aggressive behavior once she finds out Keiran is home and <br/>
not going on to school...&lt;G&gt;.   It will drive her mad.  Especially <br/>
since she is one of those people who always has to make the &quot;right&quot; <br/>
choice.  This type of decision will just completely throw her!  Oh, <br/>
well I told my husband it was his sister, he could deal with her.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I cannot understand people who say homeschoolers are slackers.  <br/>
Do they not realize how much easier it would be to send my children <br/>
away all day while I made a nice secondary income?  If I wanted to be <br/>
a slacker, and I have seen many who are, I would just shut my kids in <br/>
preschool all day, pick them up as late as possible and then dinner <br/>
and bed.  Now that is being a slacker!  Having my children with me <br/>
all day, entertaining them when need be, giving up my income, etc. <br/>
makes me and all of us very devoted to this decision.  People assume <br/>
we are missing some piece of information, and it is just the <br/>
opposite.  I have read more about schooling than any of <br/>
my &quot;schooling&quot; friends.  It was the same attitude when I did not want <br/>
to vaccinate my kids. I had read more and was more knowledable, yet <br/>
somehow those that never questioned their doctors advice are more <br/>
advised than me??  Oh, well there is my tirade for the day!<br/>
<br/>
COngratulations to you for sticking to it,especially with your <br/>
situation!  You deserve praise and support!<br/>
<br/>
Olga :)<br/>

  &lt;&lt;I swear sometimes the only reasons kids learn the crap they do at school is <br/>
  to impress relatives!!  *I* don&#39;t go around quizzing small children ~ it&#39;s, <br/>
  it&#39;s, it&#39;s icky and rude and pompous and and and...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Boy Diana I know what you mean. My husbands mom was visiting last fall. We met and the kids took turn driving home with her. Big mistake but I had no clue that she would quiz them .My poor 10 year old. She quizzed him in math and of course by her standards he failed. She hardly knows him so did not understand that he does the math in his head and needs time, lots of time. Fortunately he did not get hung up about her stuff.He seemed to let it go completely.<br/>
  In the end she suffers because they don&#39;t wish to spend time with her so I guess it all rights itself in the end. What a shame they can&#39;t see how easy it would be to have a meaningful relationship with my kids. And who is socially deprived here anyway???? <br/>

  &lt;&lt;&lt;  People assume <br/>
  we are missing some piece of information, and it is just the <br/>
  opposite.  I have read more about schooling than any of <br/>
  my &quot;schooling&quot; friends.  It was the same attitude when I did not want <br/>
  to vaccinate my kids. I had read more and was more knowledable, yet <br/>
  somehow those that never questioned their doctors advice are more <br/>
  advised than me??  Oh, well there is my tirade for the day!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  Truer words were never spoken.

Do I know what I am doing. Have I thought of their social needs...<br/>

schooling, it&#39;s effectiveness, what it does to kids, the whole hierarchy <br/>
behind it and the money tied to it, they **would** take their kids out of <br/>
school, or seek out better ones, or something.  I often wonder if many of <br/>
these folks have an &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; sort of denial, and don&#39;t want to <br/>
know.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe part of it&#39;s a huge entangled mess.  People get sucked into <br/>
materialism, wanting the latest gadget, newest car, bigger house.  They have <br/>
to pay for it somehow, can&#39;t do that AND school the kids at home, so they <br/>
just believe what the schools tell them so they&#39;ll feel their kids are <br/>
getting all they need at George Washington Elementary.  &quot;Let&#39;s not read any <br/>
of those articles or books explaining why the schools are failing, let&#39;s just <br/>
vote for the next school levy and give them more money...let&#39;s send the kids <br/>
door to door selling the 5th fundraiser this year.  And hey, let&#39;s be sure <br/>
and let all those homeschoolers know how they&#39;re ruining their children, just <br/>
to make ourselves feel MUCH better about our decisions.&quot;  <br/>

I&#39;ve found this list and the articles available online to be very <br/>
helpful. It&#39;s like giving myself permission to sit and soak it all <br/>
up. <br/>
<br/>
However!!! Just this morning, I caught myself wondering what I&#39;m <br/>
going to say when Katie&#39;s little girlfriend comes to Idaho for a week <br/>
or so (as every summer) Same age, and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll be comparing <br/>
the friend&#39;s skills and abilities to my Katie&#39;s and what will I say <br/>
etc. I&#39;ll continue absorbing this stuff, just to hang on to the bit <br/>
of confidence I have. Confident that their brains work! L and there&#39;s <br/>
a natural way of learning, and they&#39;re DOING IT.<br/>

that ALL homeschoolers deal with that pressure and igorance, but unschoolers <br/>
get another round of it from the structured homeschoolers.  We have to defend <br/>
our decisions and understandings from people who get as far as homeschooling <br/>

  I hear you Sandra and agree heartily. I for one admire the idea of keeping the unschooling philosophy andthis <br/>
<br/>
  list clean and pure and not getting mixed up in believes and definitions. I think it is important to have a clear firm <br/>
<br/>
  definition of what unschooling is .We have so many obstacles out there that being sure here is very helpful to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-956758012">This is going to be a specifically American response; sorry to other <br/>
nationals reading.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; so they <br/>
just believe what the schools tell them so they&#39;ll feel their kids are <br/>
getting all they need at George Washington Elementary.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another social aspect which affects all manner of parents whose kids <br/>
are in government school.  It has been considered unpatriotic in many ways to <br/>
have children in private schools.  And homeschooling is seen in some ways as <br/>
the ultimate privacy.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;All men are created equal&quot; has never been true in an objective-truth way, <br/>
but it&#39;s a central myth and the pretence and appearance of it are enhanced by <br/>
the idea that all children would receive the same education, and rub elbows <br/>
with other Americans as they grow up.<br/>
<br/>
Kids in rich prep schools are living in a much older tradition, pre-dating <br/>
public schooling and pre-dating compulsory education.   Kids in parochial <br/>
schools are in a hybrid situation, but there are still people who don&#39;t think <br/>
parochial education should have ever been legal in the U.S.  And lately <br/>
(lately twenty years) lots of lamer &quot;Christian&quot; equivalent schools have <br/>
sprung up, many of them run in church basements or Sunday school rooms during <br/>
the week, and are just A Beka done at the church table instead of the kitchen <br/>
table at home.  Some of those &quot;schools&quot; are just an extension of the church <br/>
daycare system through 8th or 12th grade.<br/>
<br/>
So the turmoil of protecting the monolithic and central public school system <br/>
in the U.S. is not even of our doing at all, yet we&#39;re easier targets because <br/>
we didn&#39;t even stay to participate in the fight.  We &quot;abandoned the schools,&quot; <br/>
and (they will say) don&#39;t even care what happens to other people&#39;s kids.  We <br/>
took some of the best kids out (teachers have said many times) and that makes <br/>
their job harder, and the student body averages are lower (? socially?  for <br/>
testing purposes? as far as who was sparkly and interesting? whose moms would <br/>
bring cupcakes?  some or all of that).<br/>
<br/>
Too bad the class sizes aren&#39;t lower!  THAT is what I wish would happen.   <br/>
That funding would change so that each of our kids left &quot;an empty desk&quot; and <br/>
the student teacher ratio would finally be closer to manageable and <br/>
personable.   But the school just shrinks like an evaporating puddle so that <br/>
they&#39;re still just as crowded and just as outnumbered, because they get a <br/>
per-head count of who&#39;s there, not a per-head of who&#39;s in the the community.  <br/>
And that&#39;s too bad.  If half the kids are out in other places, they should <br/>
have twice as much money and teachers and room for the kids who are left.  <br/>
Then we&#39;d be a benefit to the schools directly.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I was always amused that the only she things she ever claimed about <br/>
missing <br/>
about school were a prom (which she attended with a younger friend as an <br/>
adult) and riding the school bus (so she bought one to ride around in.) I <br/>
guess you can even do THAT kind of stuff later. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am doomed here to seem a bubbly bullshitter, because people read Holly&#39;s <br/>
mind and set me up.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s going to a prom this Saturday.  He would have been to one last <br/>
weekend too, but he got to cancel the tux because his girlfriend broke up <br/>
with him.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, on the weekend at a grocery store, said she had never ridden a <br/>
schoolbus and would really like to.    My first husband and I owned one, and <br/>
we had repainted the name as an SCA bus and took it on SCA road trips.  Keith <br/>
and I had it for a while after, but Keith isn&#39;t an automechanic, so it ended <br/>
up being a shed on a farm somewhere.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly said she told Keith he should buy another one and he said no, it was a <br/>
really bad idea to own a bus. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So Holly&#39;s next suggestion was that the homeschooling group here that does <br/>
field trips should organize a school field trip, where a yellow schoolbus <br/>
picks all the kids up in front of their houses, and takes them to a school <br/>
which is not in session and a teacher gives them a tour so they can see <br/>
what&#39;s on the walls and in the rooms and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Marty got to ride a schoolbus once when Honeywell did a park&#39;n&#39;ride <br/>
to a company picnic at the zoo.  The rode about six blocks and it was full of <br/>
adults, but they can say they&#39;ve ridden one.  Holly missed it.<br/>
<br/>
We used to vote at a school, in a classroom, and Kirby and Marty got to go <br/>
there several times, and see the kids&#39; art and papers in the hallway, and <br/>
peek into the other classrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Holly missed it.<br/>
<br/>
She watches Dharma and Greg, too, though, so it might have been copy-cat <br/>
regret, and then we come full circle.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616680856">&lt;&lt;&lt;However!!! Just this morning, I caught myself wondering what I&#39;m<br/>
going to say when Katie&#39;s little girlfriend comes to Idaho for a week<br/>
or so (as every summer) Same age, and I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll be comparing<br/>
the friend&#39;s skills and abilities to my Katie&#39;s and what will I say<br/>
etc. I&#39;ll continue absorbing this stuff, just to hang on to the bit<br/>
of confidence I have. Confident that their brains work! L and there&#39;s<br/>
a natural way of learning, and they&#39;re DOING IT.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why say anything???  Most likely, they will just want to play and have fun <br/>
together.  I doubt they will be sitting around trying to solve complicated <br/>
math problems! &lt;bg&gt;  I know it&#39;s hard not to compare sometimes.  Ridding <br/>
myself of comparisons was a HUGE step towards unschooling for me.  There are <br/>
days when I still have doubts.  (Usually when I&#39;ve been hounded by my <br/>
husband or some other family member.)  What clinched it for me was my <br/>
daughter&#39;s handwriting.  For YEARS, I pushes and prodded with her illegible <br/>
handwriting.  We tried everything.  I put off cursive until 5th grade <br/>
because I figured it she couldn&#39;t even write decently in print, how would <br/>
she ever write in cursive???  So dumb!  When I threw out *my* need for <br/>
curriculum and schedules and embraced unschooling, Haleigh stopped writing <br/>
for what seemed like forever.  Then, on Valentine&#39;s Day, she presented me <br/>
with the most beautifully written letter...in cursive!!!!  Evidently, she <br/>
had been practicing (without me even being aware of the fact) in her Italics <br/>
workbook.  I dare say her cursive is even better than the book!!!  It was at <br/>
that moment that I realized that she *may* never print legibly.  So what!  <br/>
It still looks like chicken scratch to me.  Then there is my husband who&#39;s <br/>
cursive is chicken scratch and his printing looks perfect!  To each his own!<br/>
<br/>
There will always be weak and strong areas for every human being on earth.  <br/>
Everyone is their own worst critic, would you agree?   If Katie feels &#39;less <br/>
than&#39; compared to her friend, trust that SHE will do something about it for <br/>
her own pleasure, peace of mind, personal challenge, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
You are doing a great job!!  If you have a doubts or the need to compare <br/>
comes up, RUN to your room, write in on a piece of paper and rip it to <br/>
shreads!  Then go back and joyfully watch the girls having a good time <br/>
together!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just unschooling growing pains you are going through...I think we&#39;ve <br/>
all had them! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537369077">&lt;&lt;  I wonder how many people who send there kids to school have<br/>
researched <br/>
education, why it is done, where it began, philosophy, etc...I have never<br/>
<br/>
read so much on one topic as with schooling, unschooling, homeschooling, <br/>
children,etc..And yet what am I thinking of. Do I know what I am doing.<br/>
Have <br/>
I thought of their social needs...<br/>
  Do I sound a little cynical. I guess somedays it gets tiring more than <br/>
others. In the morning it will look different again.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have two sisters in law who used to caution me and question me about<br/>
Dylan&#39;s &quot;education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
One doesn&#39;t have kids and she liked to send things about the benefits of<br/>
public school and wonderful school programs, etc.    She&#39;s stopped doing<br/>
that.   When she would send something to me I&#39;d send information about<br/>
unschooling to her.   I don&#39;t think she ever read or researched it, I<br/>
think she just came to understand for every pro school article she could<br/>
come up with I&#39;d cheerfully send ten articles, web sites, studies,<br/>
testimonials, supporting unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The other has three girls, all in public school.   When she would start<br/>
with the &quot;aren&#39;t you afraid he won&#39;t know how to talk to kids his own<br/>
age&quot;  stuff I would say, in a most sympathetic and concerned way, that<br/>
I&#39;d just seen where two kids killed a classmate and a teacher was<br/>
arrested for sexual abuse of a student and a school had slime mold<br/>
contamination and how about that head lice out break and how sad her<br/>
middle daughter was being teased for being heavy and that must make her<br/>
feel sad as a parent, sending her off to school to be tortured and<br/>
humiliated everyday... and now I don&#39;t hear so much about what Dylan is<br/>
missing in public school.   Now I hear about what a happy kid I have and<br/>
how curious he is and how interested he seems in everything. <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need to take other people&#39;s crap.   They don&#39;t need to deliver<br/>
it to us unsolicited.  We don&#39;t need to be afraid to speak our minds to<br/>
people so intent on speaking theirs.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not rude to tell a rude person to zip it.<br/>

where the REALLY dangerous stuff starts to happen (and that&#39;s 5th grade <br/>
here). The public schools are jam-packed through 4th. There&#39;s a trickle into <br/>
the private schools and homeschooling in 5th. And DROVES in 6th. The few <br/>
children whose parents are willing to stick it out until 7th or 8th are often <br/>
out of luck unless they have enough $$ to buy their way in. The &quot;better&quot; <br/>
private schools here don&#39;t take high schoool kids---unless they&#39;re <br/>
EXCEPTIONAL students and can raise the school&#39;s averages and practically <br/>
guarantee Ivy League admittance.<br/>

  This is going to be a specifically American response; sorry to other <br/>
  nationals reading.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; so they <br/>
  just believe what the schools tell them so they&#39;ll feel their kids are <br/>
  getting all they need at George Washington Elementary.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  There&#39;s another social aspect which affects all manner of parents whose kids <br/>
  are in government school.  It has been considered unpatriotic in many ways to <br/>
  have children in private schools.  And homeschooling is seen in some ways as <br/>
  the ultimate privacy.  <br/>
<br/>
  &quot;All men are created equal&quot; has never been true in an objective-truth way, <br/>
  but it&#39;s a central myth and the pretence and appearance of it are enhanced by <br/>
  the idea that all children would receive the same education, and rub elbows <br/>
  with other Americans as they grow up.<br/>
<br/>
  Kids in rich prep schools are living in a much older tradition, pre-dating <br/>
  public schooling and pre-dating compulsory education.   Kids in parochial <br/>
  schools are in a hybrid situation, but there are still people who don&#39;t think <br/>
  parochial education should have ever been legal in the U.S.  And lately <br/>
  (lately twenty years) lots of lamer &quot;Christian&quot; equivalent schools have <br/>
  sprung up, many of them run in church basements or Sunday school rooms during <br/>
  the week, and are just A Beka done at the church table instead of the kitchen <br/>
  table at home.  Some of those &quot;schools&quot; are just an extension of the church <br/>
  daycare system through 8th or 12th grade.<br/>
<br/>
  So the turmoil of protecting the monolithic and central public school system <br/>
  in the U.S. is not even of our doing at all, yet we&#39;re easier targets because <br/>
  we didn&#39;t even stay to participate in the fight.  We &quot;abandoned the schools,&quot; <br/>
  and (they will say) don&#39;t even care what happens to other people&#39;s kids.  We <br/>
  took some of the best kids out (teachers have said many times) and that makes <br/>
  their job harder, and the student body averages are lower (? socially?  for <br/>
  testing purposes? as far as who was sparkly and interesting? whose moms would <br/>
  bring cupcakes?  some or all of that).<br/>
<br/>
  Too bad the class sizes aren&#39;t lower!  THAT is what I wish would happen.   <br/>
  That funding would change so that each of our kids left &quot;an empty desk&quot; and <br/>
  the student teacher ratio would finally be closer to manageable and <br/>
  personable.   But the school just shrinks like an evaporating puddle so that <br/>
  they&#39;re still just as crowded and just as outnumbered, because they get a <br/>
  per-head count of who&#39;s there, not a per-head of who&#39;s in the the community.  <br/>
  And that&#39;s too bad.  If half the kids are out in other places, they should <br/>
  have twice as much money and teachers and room for the kids who are left.  <br/>
  Then we&#39;d be a benefit to the schools directly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268908867">**My friend wouldn&#39;t be coming to the area if she <br/>
didn&#39;t have strange estate matters to deal with. So it won&#39;t come up <br/>
at all, I&#39;m thinking. <br/>
**<br/>
<br/>
I think you are right.  But if it *does* come up, you can sweetly brush<br/>
it off, like you planned.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, we&#39;re fine!  Don&#39;t worry about us.  How are *you* doing?  Can I help?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll have a hard time keeping the conversation away from<br/>
your life, with your friend having so much to deal with in her life.<br/>

&lt;&lt; This is about the best idea I have ssen as far as public school goes - <br/>
maybe you should run for public office ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I&#39;ve already tried being a teacher to change the system from the inside. <br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s enough futile sacrifice and frustration for one lifetime without <br/>
trying to change the state&#39;s financial policies from the inside! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d have to have my hair done and wear heels and dress to get votes.  <br/>
I&#39;d have to hobnob with power-hungry school-worshippers.  I&#39;d rather stay <br/>
here and watch movies with my kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-950482176">&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;m just gonna say &quot;she&#39;s doing great. Learning at her own<br/>
pace has been so good for Katie.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a plan to me!  Beautiful response!  The nice thing about this <br/>
response is it opens the door to sharing what Katie enjoys, rather than <br/>
comparative comments.  I&#39;m so sorry to hear of their loss.  I agree, I doubt <br/>
schooling will even come up.  It sounds like you are a wonderful friend.  <br/>
I&#39;m sure it will be very healing for them both to be near their best buddies <br/>
during such a stressful time. :)<br/>
