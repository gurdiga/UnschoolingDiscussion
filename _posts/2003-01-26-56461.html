OT each week of the 3 years, for a total of 156 weeks.  We miss large<br/>
chunks, but do cover things from each book.<br/>
<br/>
No, that doesn&#39;t get the entire Old Testament, but it&#39;s at least a decent<br/>
survey.  There is another part to the common lectionary, the readings<br/>
prescribed for every day.  These are used a weekday services or for person<br/>
study and devotion.  Every 2 years (these are creatively named Year 1 and<br/>
2!), it covers every word of the standard Bible, excluding the Apocrypha.<br/>
There are alternate readings that include the apocryphal books, for those<br/>
faiths that use them.<br/>
<br/>
More obscure information you&#39;ll never use, right!  ;)   Hey, someday,<br/>
somebody from this list will be on Jeopardy and they&#39;ll thank us for all the<br/>
